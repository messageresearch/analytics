[22:18] Amen. Our heavenly father, Lord, we deem
[22:21] it a privilege to come into your house
[22:23] today. Father,
[22:25] come into your presence, Lord, to know,
[22:27] Father, that wherever two or three or
[22:29] more are gathered, Father, in your name,
[22:32] there would you be in the midst, Father.
[22:34] So, we believe it today, Father, that
[22:36] you're here, Lord, to answer prayer, to
[22:38] meet the needs of the people, Father,
[22:40] and Lord, to lift burdens, Father, from
[22:43] the shoulders of your children. So Lord
[22:45] we pray forgive us of our sins and our
[22:47] mistakes Lord as we just sang. Lord cast
[22:51] me not away from thy presence oh Lord
[22:53] but renew a right spirit and restore the
[22:55] joy of your salvation into every heart
[22:58] lord and to know that you've been with
[23:00] us and that you will be with us right
[23:02] until the end father. And we pray Lord
[23:05] that you would just guide us through
[23:07] this world of sin and evil father. It's
[23:10] just not getting any better Lord but
[23:12] Father we're looking for a change. We're
[23:14] looking for a new body and we're just
[23:16] praying, Lord, that that day will be
[23:18] soon. Lord, we pray you'd minister to
[23:21] each one. Father, remember Sister Nadine
[23:23] today, Lord, and pray you meet her need,
[23:26] Father. And for those that mourn, Lord,
[23:28] the loss of a loved one, Lord, we just
[23:30] pray that you'd just be with them,
[23:32] Father, and in some way show yourself to
[23:34] them that a soul might be saved. We ask
[23:37] your blessing, Lord, upon all the needs
[23:39] that were mentioned in the prayer
[23:41] service last night as well, Father.
[23:43] Lord, so many needs, but Father, so many
[23:46] promises, Lord, and a God, Lord, that's
[23:48] greater than the need. So help us to
[23:50] trust you, to believe you, Father. And
[23:52] Lord, we just pray your blessing upon
[23:54] the song service, Father, upon the
[23:56] musicians, upon Brother Joseph, Lord,
[23:59] that you'd be with him, Lord, and help
[24:01] him to hear the still small voice,
[24:03] guiding him to sing that [music] which
[24:04] you would have sown. So be with him, we
[24:06] pray, and with brother John as he brings
[24:08] the word. May grace, Lord, be with us.
[24:11] Be with him, Lord. And May, Father, the
[24:13] Holy Spirit, Lord, just draw an eye to
[24:16] each and every one to pull the word,
[24:18] Father, that that we might have our
[24:20] faith increase. So bless us, we pray as
[24:22] we commit to service to you in Jesus
[24:24] Christ's name. Amen.

[40:27] to First John chapter 5. I sure enjoyed
[40:30] the song service this morning. Brother
[40:31] Joe took a number of my songs that I had
[40:33] for the end. So, I look at that always
[40:35] as a good thing. I've told the song
[40:37] leaders, you don't have to be in the
[40:39] same channel of thought as the preacher.
[40:41] You're there to set an atmosphere, but
[40:42] it's always very, very special when it
[40:44] comes out that way. And I the song
[40:46] service was just perfect this morning
[40:47] for the the message the Lord has laid on
[40:49] my heart. So, I'm thankful for that.
[40:51] Amen. Just a couple of announcements. Uh
[40:54] I'll be traveling this week, Lord
[40:55] willing. I had planned to leave tomorrow
[40:56] and come back Tuesday from Cornerbrook
[40:58] to pick up a vehicle, but with the
[41:00] weather uh patterns that are kind of
[41:02] evolving, I think I'll probably go
[41:03] Wednesday, th or Thursday, Friday,
[41:05] sorry. So keep me in prayer for that.
[41:07] Brother Garfield will take the service
[41:08] on Wednesday. You're still good, Brother
[41:10] Garfield. Amen. So keep him in prayer
[41:12] for that. Come expecting. Amen. Come
[41:14] pulling on the gift of God. Amen. It's
[41:16] good to see Sister Moren back with us
[41:18] again as well this morning. God bless
[41:19] you. Good to see you. Amen. I was
[41:22] talking to Sister Beverly in there this
[41:23] morning. She said they've just been
[41:24] hammered by the snow and and Brother
[41:26] Doug's out there almost every day with
[41:27] his snowblower, but it got so bad and
[41:30] and so built up and they just she was
[41:32] saying, "Lord, could somebody just come
[41:33] with a plow?" when a brother came or a
[41:34] man came by and offered to just clear
[41:36] away the big windowross that were there
[41:38] and that and spared him a bunch of work.
[41:39] So, she said, "God always takes care of
[41:41] us." And so, we're thankful for that.
[41:43] Always keep them in prayer. Amen. 1 John
[41:46] chapter 5, turn in your Bibles if you
[41:47] would because I'm going to read more
[41:48] than what's here. 1 John 5 and 4 says,
[41:51] "For whatsoever is born of God
[41:53] overcometh the world, and this is the
[41:56] victory that overcomemeth the world,
[41:58] even our faith." And let's go to verse
[42:01] 10. He that believeth on the son of God
[42:03] hath had the witness in himself. He that
[42:06] believeth not God hath made him a liar
[42:08] because he believed not the record that
[42:10] God gave of his son. And this is the
[42:13] record that God hath given to us eternal
[42:15] life and this life is in his son. He
[42:18] that had the son had life and he that
[42:21] had not the son of God hath not life.
[42:24] Amen. God bless you. You can have your
[42:26] seats this morning. We're continuing our
[42:28] series on a position of dominion. And I
[42:30] want to take a title this morning of the
[42:32] prevailing revelation of our victory.
[42:35] Now, you know me, I'm not one for big
[42:37] grand titles, and that's a bit of a
[42:39] mouthful this this morning. I'm not one
[42:41] to usually make it too fancy, but I
[42:43] thought it summarized my inspiration for
[42:45] this service this morning as best that I
[42:47] could make it. Amen. And I just want to
[42:48] dwell on that a little bit. When we
[42:50] preached on Sunday, we preached on the
[42:52] effectual fervent prayer of a righteous
[42:55] man avaleth much. And we we focused on
[42:57] that word avail. And the word there is
[42:59] really prevail. And that word prevail
[43:01] means to be able, can do, to have
[43:05] strength, to be potent, to have force or
[43:08] power with the effect of getting
[43:11] something done. So we're talking about
[43:13] prayer that gets things done. And it
[43:15] comes from a position of finding the
[43:16] will of God. But here's the thing about
[43:18] prevailing. It says it embodies strength
[43:22] that is active in the fight. In other
[43:25] words, amen. When you prevail, it's not
[43:27] just that you fought. It's that you
[43:29] fought and achieved the victory. It's
[43:31] that you got what you got came to get.
[43:33] It's that you won what you came to want.
[43:35] It's that you walked where you came to
[43:36] walk. It's that you went through the
[43:38] door you came to go through. That you
[43:39] knocked down the walls that you came to
[43:41] knock down. Whatever it is that needed
[43:43] to be achieved, when you prevail, you
[43:44] finish the job. You didn't just try. You
[43:47] didn't just give it your best effort.
[43:48] Amen. But you are the overcomer. You're
[43:50] the victor. You're the winner of that
[43:52] situation when you prevail. Amen. But
[43:55] notice what it says. Prevailing embody
[43:57] strength. When we say that that someone
[44:00] embodies something, it means that you
[44:01] take a thought or a concept or an idea
[44:04] or a characteristic and that person
[44:06] becomes it.
[44:09] Amen. An embodiment means you are it.
[44:12] You're not just now thinking about it or
[44:14] you're just not believing it, but you
[44:16] are it. Amen. If I could pick an example
[44:19] this morning, take something like
[44:21] faithfulness. Faithful means that uh
[44:23] you're loyal. you're steadfast, that
[44:25] you're unwaving, unwavering and
[44:27] unswerving in your commitment. If I was
[44:29] to say, who embodies faithfulness? I
[44:30] would say we'd pick Brother Gerald
[44:33] because for 43 years, he pastored this
[44:36] church with minimal support from other
[44:38] ministry. He preached three services a
[44:40] week for 30 of those 43 years. Uh, week
[44:42] in and week out, whether the weather was
[44:44] bad or not, how many remembering having
[44:46] church in the snowstorms? I remember
[44:47] living in in Kilbride. We had to make
[44:49] three runs to get up the hill to our
[44:51] house cuz brother Gerald had us in
[44:52] church no matter what. Faithful.
[44:55] Faithful. That's what we would say. So,
[44:57] so faithful is not just a concept. Now
[44:59] we can look at brother Gerald. We can
[45:00] say faithful is a person. Amen. And
[45:03] that's our example. Is not the idea. Now
[45:05] we can look at the man and we can say
[45:07] that is faithfulness.
[45:09] It's no longer a concept. It's not just
[45:11] a characteristic. It has become a
[45:13] person. Amen. And so when we talk about
[45:15] prevailing the purpose is that it comes
[45:17] to a place where we become what we
[45:21] believe. Amen. Where we experience where
[45:24] we have where we project where we
[45:25] produce the very thing that we are
[45:28] claiming. Amen. So I'm preaching this
[45:29] morning on the prevailing revelation of
[45:31] our victory. And what I'm preaching on
[45:33] now is a revelation that changes from
[45:36] something that we just believe to
[45:38] something that we are. Amen. It becomes
[45:41] not something that's in our mind or just
[45:42] something that's in our soul, but it
[45:44] becomes the literal expression of our
[45:46] life. Amen. I'm talking about changing
[45:48] us from I believe to I am. That's what
[45:52] we're talking about here. Amen. Look at
[45:54] what Jesus would say. It was so
[45:56] interesting. Last night we had a
[45:57] wonderful, wonderful prayer meeting and
[45:59] there were things that people were
[46:00] saying in their prayers and I just
[46:02] thought, "Oh my Lord, they're they're
[46:03] they're in the channel. They're in the
[46:05] channel of what's coming for us this
[46:07] weekend." And listen to this. It says
[46:08] Jesus said, "Ye are the salt of the
[46:11] earth, but if the salt has lost his
[46:14] savor, wherewith shall it be salted?" He
[46:17] says, "It is thenforth
[46:19] good for nothing." That word good means
[46:22] prevail.
[46:23] He says, in other words, it is no longer
[46:26] prevailing. He says, "So it's good. It's
[46:28] good for nothing. It doesn't win. It
[46:30] doesn't do its job. So it'll be cast out
[46:32] and betrodden under the foot of men." So
[46:34] that word good is that same word avail.
[46:37] It's the same word prevail. And Jesus is
[46:39] saying when you lose the characteristics
[46:41] of salt, you can't be salt. You won't be
[46:44] used as salt because you can't do what
[46:46] salt does. Salt enhances flavor. Salt
[46:49] preserves. And so if salt has it loses
[46:52] the characteristic of its purpose, he
[46:54] says it's no good for anything except to
[46:56] be thrown out on the ground. There's no
[46:58] purpose behind it. Amen. And Jesus is
[47:01] saying when you stop being what you are,
[47:05] you don't prevail.
[47:07] When you don't have and express the
[47:09] characteristics of what you're supposed
[47:11] to be, you're good for nothing.
[47:14] Amen. That's a that's a hard statement
[47:15] to make, but he's saying, listen, you
[47:17] have purpose. You are something, so be
[47:20] it. Amen. Don't let anything take away
[47:23] that thing. Amen. Jesus is pointing to
[47:26] an embodiment rather than just a belief.
[47:28] You can say, "I believe I'm salt." But
[47:30] guess what? If you can't flavor
[47:32] something, and if you can't preserve
[47:33] something, I'm sorry, you're not salt.
[47:36] And Jesus is saying, listen, as sons and
[47:38] daughters of God, there's things that
[47:40] you have to be. There's things that you
[47:41] are, and you got to let that be the
[47:43] expression of your life. Amen. And so,
[47:45] he's pointing to an embodiment, a
[47:47] prevailing because of what we are, not
[47:50] just because of what we believe. Amen.
[47:53] Let me take it a step further. Jesus
[47:54] said in Mark 21:17, "When Jesus heard
[47:57] it, he said unto them, they that are
[47:59] whole." And that word whole is prevail.
[48:02] Those that prevail, those that have
[48:05] strength, have no need of a physician,
[48:07] but they that are sick. He says, "I came
[48:09] not to call the righteous, but sinners
[48:11] to repentance." Notice his words there.
[48:14] He says, "Those that are prevailing,
[48:15] those that have strength, those that
[48:17] have health, those that are in the
[48:19] condition they're supposed to be in,
[48:21] they don't need doctors." Listen, we're
[48:24] not all going to a doctor every week,
[48:25] are we? Or every day. Why? Because
[48:27] dayto-day generally we're healthy. But
[48:29] Jesus said, "Listen, there are those
[48:31] that are sick." In other words, there
[48:33] are those that are struggling. There are
[48:35] those that are weak. There are those
[48:36] that are not where they're supposed to
[48:38] be. And he says, "That's why I'm coming.
[48:40] It's for those that aren't prevailing.
[48:43] I'm there for those that need a victory,
[48:45] but they can't get the victory. I'm
[48:47] there for those that keep trying, but
[48:48] just can't seem to cross the line. I'm
[48:50] there for those that are trying to open
[48:52] a door, but they can't get through it."
[48:54] He says, "That's why I came." So the
[48:56] answer to prevailing questions is you've
[48:58] got to have Christ. That's the only
[49:01] thing that will prevail. Amen. He's
[49:03] saying I came to take people that are
[49:05] losing and bring them to a place where
[49:07] they are prevailing day by day. Church,
[49:12] what is our natural state or condition
[49:14] supposed to be in our body? Is it
[49:15] supposed to be health or sickness?
[49:18] Health. We're supposed to be healthy
[49:21] daytoday. So, what Christ is saying here
[49:23] is, I've come to take you to your
[49:26] natural position. I've come to take you
[49:29] to the condition you're supposed to be
[49:30] in all the time. That's the reason why I
[49:33] came. And that's the foundation that I
[49:35] have for this message this morning. And
[49:37] I want to bring it down to where we
[49:38] live. So, if you go back to Genesis 22,
[49:40] and we're going to read some of it this
[49:42] morning. Genesis 22 is the story of
[49:44] Abraham and Isaac, where Abraham has
[49:47] received the promised child. He's had
[49:49] Isaac and he's born and and God says
[49:51] through Isaac is is is going to be this
[49:53] grand promise of a great nation. But if
[49:55] you look at Genesis 22:1, it says that
[49:58] God tested Abraham. So what happens in
[50:02] this chapter is a test from start to
[50:04] finish. And God tells Abraham to go and
[50:06] take Isaac and sacrifice him as an
[50:09] offering to God.
[50:11] Now church, that makes no sense to the
[50:13] human mind.
[50:15] Now, today, if I said, "God told me to
[50:18] sacrifice my son." You'd say, "Brother
[50:20] John, you're off the word." And you'd be
[50:21] correct.
[50:23] But this is a test for Abraham. It is
[50:26] not a real request. It is never meant to
[50:28] go through all the way. But it is a test
[50:30] of Abraham's faith to see what Abraham
[50:33] would do. And if we look at Abraham's
[50:36] soul in this moment, Paul by the the
[50:38] revelation of the Holy Spirit would show
[50:40] what was going on inside of Abraham that
[50:42] was bringing him to a place where he
[50:43] could prevail. And he says in Hebrews
[50:45] 11, by faith Abraham, when he was tried,
[50:49] when he had a test, when he was put
[50:51] through the ringer, Amen. If you're
[50:53] going to prevail, you've got to be in a
[50:55] test. There is no prevailing if there's
[50:57] no challenge. There is no prevailing if
[50:59] there's not a battle. He says, when he
[51:01] was tried, he offered up, excuse me,
[51:03] Isaac, and he that had received the
[51:06] promises offered up his only begotten
[51:09] son. Now, notice the phrasing there. He
[51:11] says it is his only begotten son that he
[51:14] offered. Why? Because it was a type of
[51:17] what was going to happen for us that God
[51:20] would offer his only begotten son
[51:23] and that would save us from our sins.
[51:25] But Abraham had to do it in type because
[51:27] he's the seed of God. He's a He's a son
[51:30] of God. He's a He's a type of what God
[51:32] was trying to do. So what was happening
[51:34] here was a representation of what God
[51:36] would do. But God said, "Listen, I I I
[51:39] love that you're faithful to do it, but
[51:40] this isn't your job. This is my job."
[51:43] But he wanted to see if he would do it.
[51:44] And he says, "Of whom it was said that
[51:46] in Isaac shall thy seed be called." So
[51:49] Abraham made Isa made God made Abraham
[51:52] take his promise and put it on the line.
[51:55] It meant he had to he had to he had
[51:56] received the promised son. Now God told
[51:58] him to give it up. And and look at
[52:00] Abraham's attitude here and look at why
[52:03] he did it in faith. It says that he was
[52:05] accounting that God was able to raise
[52:08] him up. In other words, Abraham was
[52:10] willing to put the knife to Isaac
[52:13] believing that God had to raise him up.
[52:16] He said, "Even from the dead, from
[52:18] whence also he received him as in a
[52:21] figure." So in other words, Abraham
[52:23] figured that God had bound himself to
[52:26] his own promise and therefore God could
[52:28] not fail. God had given him the promised
[52:31] son as from a dead person. Anyways,
[52:33] Sarah's womb was dead. Abraham's seed
[52:36] was dried out. They weren't having
[52:38] relationship. So, Abraham or Isaac had
[52:40] already come out of death once.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, God had made a promise to
[52:45] Abraham. Isaac's going to be the one
[52:47] that produces the great nation. You're
[52:49] going to have one. He's going to have
[52:51] multiple. And then from there, it's
[52:52] going to spread out. So, if God could do
[52:54] it supernaturally once, God can do it
[52:57] supernaturally again. That's where he
[52:59] was holding to. Amen. And so God that
[53:01] gave life the first time could be the
[53:04] God that gave life the second time. Now
[53:06] we opened up with this scripture. We're
[53:08] going to read it multiple times in
[53:09] multiple ways of service. Remember what
[53:11] John said. He says, "For whatsoever is
[53:13] born of God overcometh the world." He
[53:17] says, "And this is the victory that
[53:19] overcomemeth the world, even our faith."
[53:22] What is it that overcomes the world? Our
[53:24] faith. What is faith? Faith is a
[53:26] revelation of the will of God. Amen.
[53:29] Faith is when you take what God says and
[53:31] you say that is mine. He's talking about
[53:34] me that's for me. You confess it. You
[53:37] walk forward and you receive it. And
[53:39] whether you receive it in the first step
[53:41] or you receive it 10 miles down the road
[53:43] or 100 miles down the road, it doesn't
[53:45] matter because your faith keeps you
[53:47] walking because you have a revelation.
[53:49] He was talking about me there. Amen.
[53:52] That's what faith is. Amen. And so John
[53:55] says the the key to our victory is that
[53:57] we receive a revelation, a personal
[54:00] revelation of the will of God for our
[54:03] life and we go forward and we believe it
[54:05] until we get it. That's our victory.
[54:08] Amen. I'm building some key principles
[54:10] this morning as we move forward in this
[54:12] message. Now, let's look at this scene
[54:14] as we try and see what happened. Just
[54:16] build a bit of a drama here. It says,
[54:17] "And Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[54:19] offering." So in Genesis 22 it says that
[54:21] Abraham took two young men, two servants
[54:23] and he took Isaac and and himself
[54:25] obviously and a donkey and they took it
[54:26] all and they went to the mountain that
[54:28] God had said. But from there, watch what
[54:30] happens. Abraham took the wood of the
[54:32] burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac
[54:34] his son.
[54:36] Who carried the cross? The son.
[54:40] Christ carried the cross for a while.
[54:44] Now Isaac's carrying the wood. It says,
[54:46] "And he took the fire in his hand and a
[54:48] knife, and they went both of them
[54:50] together. Everything they needed for a
[54:52] sacrifice is there.
[54:55] And Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father,
[54:57] and said, "My father." In other words,
[54:59] dad. He said, "Here am I, my son?" "Yes,
[55:02] son. What do you want?" He said, "Behold
[55:03] the fire and the wood." Dad, we've got
[55:05] fire. We've got wood. He says, "But
[55:07] where's the lamb for a burnt offering?"
[55:10] And Abraham said, "My son, God will
[55:13] provide himself a lamb for a burnt
[55:16] offering." So they went both of them
[55:18] together. Church, your confession is so
[55:20] critical. Your confession is so
[55:22] critical. Abraham was not dodging the
[55:25] question. Abraham was in faith saying,
[55:28] "God provides."
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham was prevailing in the
[55:32] test. He would not give a negative
[55:34] confession. It says, "And they came to
[55:35] the place which God had told him of. And
[55:37] Abraham built an altar there, and laid
[55:39] the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
[55:42] son, and laid him on the altar upon the
[55:44] wood. And Abraham stretched forth his
[55:46] hand, and took the knife to slay his
[55:49] son. And the angel of the Lord called
[55:51] unto him out of heaven, and
[55:53] said,"Abraham, Abraham." And he said,
[55:54] "Here am I." And he said, "Lay not thy
[55:57] hand upon the land, neither do thou
[55:59] anything unto him. For now I know that
[56:01] thou fearest God, seeing that thou hast
[56:03] not withheld thy son, thine only son,
[56:05] for me." So Abraham passed the test. He
[56:08] got to the point where he's about to
[56:09] drive the knife into downward and God
[56:12] stopped him and Abraham had prevailed.
[56:15] Amen. I want you to consider that scene
[56:17] this morning. Samuel, come on up this
[56:19] morning. [snorts] Amen.
[56:21] I want you to consider that this
[56:23] morning. And I'm doing this by type and
[56:25] shadow. Now, I I I've gone through this
[56:27] with Samuel yesterday, but Abraham comes
[56:29] and he takes Isaac and he lays him down
[56:33] upon the altar and he binds his hand so
[56:36] he can't move.
[56:38] And can you imagine? You're looking
[56:40] down. This is your hope. This is your
[56:43] promise.
[56:46] And he's laying there
[56:48] and you're about to do something to him
[56:50] that you can't ever imagine doing to
[56:52] your child. I don't know if you've ever
[56:54] killed anything. If you've ever killed
[56:56] an animal, if you've hunted in that,
[56:58] it's not it's not clean. And he's
[57:00] looking down at his promised son, and he
[57:03] knows in a second that son is going to
[57:04] be bleeding everything out.
[57:07] We look at this. I I'm faithful Abraham.
[57:12] But who's committed here?
[57:15] This is the one that's committed. I
[57:16] don't mean to be light, but you remember
[57:18] what they say about a bacon and egg
[57:20] sandwich. The chicken is faithful,
[57:24] but the pig is committed.
[57:28] Isaac's the one that's got to have the
[57:29] faith here. Abraham loses a promise, but
[57:33] he's got to lose his life. And you can
[57:35] imagine, they're sitting there and and
[57:37] Isaac's looking up and Abraham has told
[57:39] him, Isaac, the Lord has told me to
[57:42] sacrifice you to him.
[57:46] But he's saying, Isaac, but he also said
[57:50] that a great nation is going to come
[57:53] through you,
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Isaac. You came out of the dead once.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; You were a supernatural being from the
[58:00] beginning. You're a living promise.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to take your life.
[58:07] But the same God that raised you up the
[58:09] first time
[58:10] &gt;&gt; is going to raise you up the second
[58:12] time. Cuz God is faithful. He cannot
[58:15] tell a lie. And I can imagine, this is
[58:17] just me. I don't know. I can imagine
[58:19] Isaac's laying there and tears are
[58:21] streaming down his face. And he's
[58:23] saying, and Abraham saying, "Isaac, I
[58:26] love you. I love you. I would never do
[58:28] anything to hurt you, but God told me to
[58:30] do it, and I've got to do what God
[58:32] says." And Isaac's saying, "Daddy, I
[58:34] trust you. I trust you. Daddy, do what
[58:38] you want to do." And Abraham would take
[58:40] that knife and hold him. And you can
[58:43] imagine that knife coming up. If you've
[58:45] ever had to kill something, you hold it
[58:48] down and that knife comes and you tense
[58:50] because you got to drive with all your
[58:52] weight. You got to make sure the knife
[58:55] goes true. And as he's there and his
[58:57] body tenses and that knife just like
[59:00] that,
[59:02] God says, "Stop.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hold your hand. Hold your hand. Don't
[59:08] move."
[59:10] And can you imagine the relief that
[59:11] swept over Isaac? Did you see him flinch
[59:14] as I went down?
[59:17] And I didn't even hold a knife.
[59:20] I didn't even hold a knife. But
[59:22] something says, "Stop." And Abraham, his
[59:25] hand is stayed. And God says, "Listen, I
[59:27] know. Listen to what the prophet of God
[59:29] says." He says, "Now sometimes it's when
[59:32] you're absolutely at the end of the rope
[59:35] when he speaks to you."
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Now listen to this.
[59:40] And Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[59:42] looked, and behold, behind him a ram
[59:45] caught in a thicket by his horns. And
[59:47] Abraham went and took the ram and
[59:49] offered it up for a burnt offering in
[59:51] thestead of his son. And Abraham called
[59:54] the name of that place Jehovah Gyra, as
[59:56] it is said to this day, in the mount of
[59:59] the Lord that it shall be seen." Now
[1:00:01] Jehovah Gyra, we we interpret it as the
[1:00:03] Lord will provide. But there are there
[1:00:06] are different ways to to interpret it.
[1:00:07] said, Abraham puts it here very clearly.
[1:00:10] The Lord who will appear, the Lord who
[1:00:12] will be seen. In other words, when God
[1:00:15] gives an answer, you're going to see it.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; It's not just going to be an ethereal
[1:00:19] thing. It's not just going to be a
[1:00:20] thought or an idea. Amen. Where is it
[1:00:23] going to be seen? In the mount of the
[1:00:25] Lord. Where is the mount of the Lord?
[1:00:27] Mount Zion. Who is Mount Zion?
[1:00:30] Hallelujah. That's the bride is Mount
[1:00:32] Zion. In the bride will be seen the
[1:00:35] Lord, the answer of the Lord, the
[1:00:37] provision of the Lord. Did Abraham see
[1:00:39] the Lord?
[1:00:41] No. But he saw his provision.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Abraham saw in type
[1:00:47] the total redemption of his seed. He saw
[1:00:51] the total redemption of the children of
[1:00:53] God. He saw the answer. He saw the
[1:00:54] remedy to restore us back to God. And
[1:00:57] Abraham had nothing to do with it. He
[1:01:00] had nothing to do it. It was God's
[1:01:02] provision from start to finish. Says
[1:01:04] this in Psalms 27. It says, "I would
[1:01:07] have despared
[1:01:09] had I not believed that I would see the
[1:01:11] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:01:14] living."
[1:01:17] Amen. Can you imagine?
[1:01:20] [snorts]
[1:01:22] He holds the knight. He holds his hand
[1:01:24] and he lays it down and he quickly
[1:01:26] unties it and he says, "Get up, Isaac.
[1:01:28] Get up, Isaac." And he says, "Look,
[1:01:31] there's a lamb right there. There's a
[1:01:33] ram right there. Come with me. We'll go
[1:01:35] get it. You can go sit down." And he
[1:01:38] goes and there's a ram caught in the
[1:01:40] thicket.
[1:01:42] Now, church, do you think that ram was
[1:01:45] there all along?
[1:01:47] I have a feeling Abraham would have
[1:01:49] noticed a ram caught in the thicket
[1:01:51] behind him. They make noises when
[1:01:54] they're caught. You're looking around.
[1:01:56] You don't know what's going to happen in
[1:01:57] these things. Amen. It says, "About that
[1:01:59] time, Abraham heard something behind him
[1:02:02] bleet and he looked around and there was
[1:02:04] a ram, a male sheep, caught by its horns
[1:02:06] in the thicket." He says, "Where did
[1:02:08] that ram come from?" Think of it. He was
[1:02:11] a 100 miles from civilization and he was
[1:02:13] up on top of the mountain where there's
[1:02:15] no water or nothing for the ram. How'd
[1:02:17] he get there? He says, "No, it wasn't a
[1:02:19] vision. It was a real ram." He picked
[1:02:21] him up and he was kicking and bleeding.
[1:02:23] Laid him up and cut his throat and blood
[1:02:25] ran out. He says, "Where did that ram
[1:02:28] come from?" No wonder he called it
[1:02:31] Jehovah Gyra. The Lord provided almighty
[1:02:34] God who can speak himself into a body,
[1:02:36] speak angels into a body, spoke that ram
[1:02:40] into existence. It came into existence
[1:02:43] one minute and five minutes later it
[1:02:46] went out of existence. He says, "For God
[1:02:48] is Jehovah Gyra. No matter what the
[1:02:50] conditions are, he will provide for
[1:02:53] himself a sacrifice." church. Last
[1:02:55] Sunday we spoke about people that are in
[1:02:57] a place where there is no way out. They
[1:02:59] can't go up. They can't go down. They
[1:03:01] can't go through. They can't go around.
[1:03:03] But yet God provides a way. We talked
[1:03:05] about people that are under burdens that
[1:03:07] seem so heavy that it would destroy
[1:03:08] them. But yet we are not crushed. We're
[1:03:11] in places where it seems like there is
[1:03:13] nothing can happen and yet we are not in
[1:03:15] despair. I'm here to tell you this
[1:03:17] morning the answer of Jehovah Gyra does
[1:03:20] not have to be according to the laws of
[1:03:22] man. It doesn't have to be according to
[1:03:23] the laws of nature. Doesn't have to be
[1:03:25] according to the laws of time. But
[1:03:28] almighty God can speak and move from
[1:03:31] eternity and in a moment he can give you
[1:03:34] what you have need of this morning.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Haven't we seen it in our midst so many
[1:03:38] times?
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; That's the way that God works in these
[1:03:41] situations. Amen. God can bring the
[1:03:43] answer, the solution, the healing, the
[1:03:46] deliverance, the salvation, whatever it
[1:03:48] might be in an instant by his spoken
[1:03:51] word from eternity.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; He says, "Atheists may rise, skeptics
[1:03:56] may stand, ages may turn, but God
[1:03:58] Almighty is still Jehovah Gyra." He
[1:04:02] said, "He can provide a sacrifice
[1:04:05] regardless of how deep you stooped in
[1:04:07] sin. He's still Jehovah Gyra. The Lord
[1:04:10] will provide a sacrifice. No matter how
[1:04:12] sick you are, how bad off you off you
[1:04:14] are, he's Jehovah Gyra. No matter what
[1:04:17] the doctor said, no matter what the
[1:04:19] people said, he's Jehovah Gyra. The Lord
[1:04:22] will provide in an instant of time the
[1:04:26] sacrifice needed.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Church, can you imagine the jubilee that
[1:04:30] Abraham and Isaac had when he realized
[1:04:32] he didn't have to kill his son? When
[1:04:33] Isaac realized, I don't have to get my
[1:04:35] throat cut.
[1:04:37] I imagine they had a hooping and a
[1:04:39] hollering and a dancing time as they
[1:04:41] went and got that ram and prepared it
[1:04:42] together for sacrifice. Amen. And as
[1:04:45] they did that, can you imagine just the
[1:04:47] relief rolling through their minds?
[1:04:50] The absolute
[1:04:52] total joy
[1:04:54] that comes with knowing he provides.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; He abides. He cares. He knows. He sees.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; He's with me.
[1:05:06] church. But you know what I love? God
[1:05:09] wasn't done yet. Hallelujah. See, so
[1:05:12] often we're so we're so caught up in the
[1:05:15] idea of, "Oh, oh, he's healed me. He's
[1:05:17] saved me. He's delivered me." Church,
[1:05:19] he's got so much more than that. That's
[1:05:21] just the start. You eye hasn't seen nor
[1:05:24] ear heard the things that God has
[1:05:26] prepared for those that love him. He's
[1:05:28] got so much more than what we're we're
[1:05:30] focused on in this life. Because God is
[1:05:32] working from the eternal, not just from
[1:05:34] the present. God's got a plan that's got
[1:05:36] to play its way out in our life. And
[1:05:38] he's got so much more that he's wanting
[1:05:40] to do through his children. He's got
[1:05:42] more victories that are coming our way.
[1:05:44] Amen. Abraham's already had a
[1:05:46] conversation with God. They killed the
[1:05:47] lamb. And then God speaks again.
[1:05:50] He says, "And the angel of the Lord
[1:05:52] called unto Abraham out of heaven, out
[1:05:54] of heaven the second time and said, by
[1:05:56] myself have I sworn, sayeth the Lord."
[1:05:58] This is a onesided unconditional
[1:06:02] covenant.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; God said, "I swore it by myself. I
[1:06:05] didn't swear it based on your actions,
[1:06:06] based on your ideas, based on your
[1:06:08] faithfulness, based on how you walk,
[1:06:10] based on how you talk, based on what you
[1:06:12] do." [snorts] He said, "I made you a
[1:06:14] promise by myself.
[1:06:17] It's on the basis of who he is that we
[1:06:20] receive.
[1:06:22] He says, "For thou, because thou hast
[1:06:24] done this thing and has not withheld thy
[1:06:26] son, thine only son, that in blessing I
[1:06:29] will bless thee, and in multiplying I
[1:06:31] will multiply thy seed as the stars of
[1:06:33] the heaven, and as the sand which is
[1:06:35] upon the seashore." Now catch this. This
[1:06:38] is new. And thy seed shall possess the
[1:06:42] gate of his enemies. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:06:45] Now look at this. He didn't say he did
[1:06:48] not say that Abraham would possess the
[1:06:50] gates of his enemies. He said thy seed
[1:06:54] future tense will possess the gate of
[1:06:57] his singular enemies plural.
[1:07:01] One person in the future will possess
[1:07:04] the gate of his enemies.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is that? Who is the one that's
[1:07:08] going to do that? We just have to go
[1:07:10] back to the scriptures. And Paul would
[1:07:13] say this. He says, "Now to Abraham and
[1:07:14] his seed were the promises made."
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "Sir,
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; he saith not and to seeds,
[1:07:23] but he says as of many." He says, "But
[1:07:25] as of one, and to thy seed, which is
[1:07:29] Christ." Amen. So, who is the overcoming
[1:07:32] seed? Who's the overcoming one that will
[1:07:34] possess the gate of his enemies? It's
[1:07:36] got to be Jesus Christ. That is the
[1:07:39] overcomer. Amen. There is one overcomer.
[1:07:41] There is one victor. There is one mighty
[1:07:44] conqueror. And it is the Lord Jesus
[1:07:46] Christ. Amen. That's where we're at this
[1:07:48] morning. Amen. He is the one that
[1:07:50] possesses the gate of his enemies. Now,
[1:07:52] see, we don't understand this thought of
[1:07:54] possessing the gates of his enemies
[1:07:55] because we don't have gates anymore. You
[1:07:58] go overseas. Jamaica, they probably have
[1:08:00] gates. In in South Africa, they have
[1:08:02] gates on their houses. But in the old
[1:08:04] days, when you had a a city, you had to
[1:08:06] go through a gate to get into that city
[1:08:08] because it was surrounded by thick
[1:08:10] walls. We look at St. John's today. If
[1:08:12] you wanted to take St. John's today, if
[1:08:14] you're trying to to conquer it, you
[1:08:15] could pick your road. Many roads into
[1:08:18] St. John's, none of them guarded by a
[1:08:20] gate. But in the old days, what they
[1:08:22] would do is when they built a city, when
[1:08:24] they wanted a place to live securely,
[1:08:26] they'd build the city. And the city was
[1:08:28] defined by the exterior walls. And they
[1:08:30] built them as thick and as high as they
[1:08:32] could afford or they could do. And that
[1:08:34] was their protection. That was their
[1:08:36] security. Amen. And so I went and I
[1:08:38] looked some up. And these are these are
[1:08:39] at Jerusalem. This is the Damascus gate
[1:08:42] in Jerusalem. So this faces the outside.
[1:08:44] And so if an army came to Jerusalem,
[1:08:46] they would have to face these walls. And
[1:08:48] you look at them, they're huge. They're
[1:08:50] massive. Very difficult to get through.
[1:08:52] But also, you have gates within the
[1:08:54] city. And this is the Zion gate. This is
[1:08:57] the gate that guards Mount Zion. So you
[1:08:59] have outer gates and you have inner
[1:09:00] gates. You have layers of defense built
[1:09:03] within the city. And what would happen
[1:09:04] is if they lost the outer walls, they'd
[1:09:06] go back to the inner walls and try and
[1:09:08] hold it off there. Amen. But the thing
[1:09:10] is, you couldn't have a wall without a
[1:09:13] gate because people have to come in,
[1:09:15] people have to go out, you have to bring
[1:09:17] supplies in, you have to bring goods for
[1:09:19] commerce and trade and these different
[1:09:21] things. And so these gates were
[1:09:24] necessary, but they were also the weak
[1:09:26] point in every city because you can't
[1:09:29] build a gate as heavy as you can build a
[1:09:31] wall. Some of these walls, I mean, uh,
[1:09:33] Jericho, they could race two chariots
[1:09:35] around them all the way around. You're
[1:09:37] talking at probably 12, 15 feet thick.
[1:09:41] You can't build a gate that's made of
[1:09:42] stone 12 ft thick. You wouldn't be able
[1:09:45] to move it. You don't have hinges that
[1:09:46] would hold it. Certainly not in those
[1:09:47] days. You wouldn't. And so the the these
[1:09:50] gates were the weak points because they
[1:09:52] provided access to the city without the
[1:09:55] hard work of knocking down walls. And
[1:09:57] so, we're preach we're going to be
[1:09:58] preaching on gates very soon, Lord
[1:10:00] willing. But the point is this. If you
[1:10:02] can control the gate, you control the
[1:10:05] city. If you possess the gate, you
[1:10:08] possess the city because you control who
[1:10:10] comes in and out. They can hold the wall
[1:10:13] all day long, but if you can go in
[1:10:14] through the gate, they can't stop you.
[1:10:16] If you possess the gate, you have the
[1:10:18] victory. That was the guarantee of this.
[1:10:20] So God says there's coming one. There's
[1:10:22] coming one who will control the gate of
[1:10:25] the enemy. There's the enemy is going to
[1:10:27] have all sorts of big walls.
[1:10:29] He's going to he's going to make it look
[1:10:31] impossible. The the the the the uh the
[1:10:33] weapons he has, the thickness of the
[1:10:35] walls, the height of the walls, the the
[1:10:37] the task that you're facing is going to
[1:10:39] seem monumental. But there's a weakness,
[1:10:41] and the weakness is a gate. And there's
[1:10:42] someone coming that's going to control
[1:10:44] the gate. Amen.
[1:10:47] [snorts] Didn't we see that happen when
[1:10:49] Jesus Christ walked the earth?
[1:10:51] He cast out devils. He healed the sick.
[1:10:54] He raised the dead. He walked on water.
[1:10:55] He controlled nature itself. And then at
[1:10:58] the end of it all, he died. And it would
[1:11:01] think that he had lost the battle, but
[1:11:03] he died and he went down to hell. And
[1:11:05] from there, he took the keys to death
[1:11:08] and hell to the gate.
[1:11:12] The lowest low was his greatest victory.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Cuz he went down and he took it. Amen.
[1:11:18] In Revelation 1, it says this, "I am he
[1:11:20] that liveth and was dead. And behold,
[1:11:24] I'm alive forever more. Amen. and I have
[1:11:27] the keys of hell and death. Amen. Every
[1:11:29] gate had a means of locking it, of
[1:11:31] securing it. And traditionally, what
[1:11:33] they'd have is they would have uh they
[1:11:35] would have iron bars that they could
[1:11:36] drive down into the ground, and then
[1:11:38] they would have wooden bars that they
[1:11:39] would place along the inside. So, the
[1:11:41] iron bars on the ground would keep it
[1:11:42] from moving at the center, which is
[1:11:44] where it was weakest. And then the
[1:11:45] wooden bars that drop down would
[1:11:47] reinforce the center to try and make it
[1:11:49] impervious to attack. And so if you have
[1:11:52] a key, you can get in there. And the
[1:11:56] idea is that if you've got a key, it
[1:11:58] doesn't matter what they're doing on the
[1:11:59] inside, you can always unlock the door.
[1:12:02] [snorts] Now, I don't know. I'm sure
[1:12:03] nobody here has ever fought with a
[1:12:05] sibling
[1:12:07] where they had a door that was locked.
[1:12:10] But you know, these interior doors,
[1:12:11] they've got the little hole in the
[1:12:12] middle that you can go and you if you
[1:12:14] can poke in. We used to use like the the
[1:12:15] little tube from a from a a pen or
[1:12:18] something like that. Obviously, they
[1:12:19] have an actual thing that you do it with
[1:12:20] and you can just take and you just poke
[1:12:22] it in. They'd lock that door and think
[1:12:23] they're safe and then you just go pop it
[1:12:25] open. Then you go in, you thrash the
[1:12:26] living daylights out of them for even
[1:12:27] trying to lock you out in the first
[1:12:28] place. Paul knows what I'm talking
[1:12:29] about. Amen. [snorts]
[1:12:33] The thing is, you can be behind a locked
[1:12:35] door all you want. If somebody has the
[1:12:37] key, they're getting in.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, what he's saying is, I
[1:12:43] control access
[1:12:46] to your house, Satan.
[1:12:48] I know. I let him in. I let them out. I
[1:12:52] can defeat you at any time. Your
[1:12:54] vulnerability is in my hands. I do with
[1:12:57] it what I will. Are you hearing me this
[1:13:00] morning, church? Their power is still
[1:13:02] under his domain.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Satan can do nothing. He can't touch you
[1:13:07] unless God allows it. And all God's
[1:13:10] doing when he allows it is he's training
[1:13:12] you to overcome.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; He's training you to prevail. Amen.
[1:13:15] Their continued existence is only
[1:13:18] because God allows it. But there's
[1:13:19] coming a day where he says enough is
[1:13:21] enough. And they'll go into the pit and
[1:13:23] they'll be cast into fire and there'll
[1:13:25] be nothing left of them. There's coming
[1:13:27] an end to it. Amen. But for the
[1:13:29] meantime, guess what? We're in the
[1:13:31] middle of it. We're in the battle. We're
[1:13:33] the prize. But I'll tell you this,
[1:13:34] church. We are the victory as well.
[1:13:36] Brother Brown would say the church is
[1:13:37] Christ's victory today. But I want us to
[1:13:40] bring this home to our own our own lives
[1:13:42] this morning. We're preaching on the
[1:13:44] prevailing revelation of our victory,
[1:13:47] not somebody else's, of ours. Amen. And
[1:13:49] I want us to see to come to the place
[1:13:50] where we can look at these scriptures
[1:13:52] and we can see that we're in them, not
[1:13:53] out of them. Amen. That it's not an
[1:13:56] external thing, that it's not for
[1:13:57] somebody else or it was only for Christ,
[1:13:59] but it's for us. Amen. God told Abraham,
[1:14:02] "Thy seed shall possess the gate of his
[1:14:04] enemies." And that was Christ overcoming
[1:14:06] for us. But watch what Jesus says now to
[1:14:08] his disciples just before he's ready to
[1:14:10] go away. [snorts] It says when Jesus
[1:14:12] came to the coast of Cesaria Philippi,
[1:14:14] he asked his disciples saying, "Who do
[1:14:16] men say that I, the son of man, am?" And
[1:14:18] they said, "Some that say you are John
[1:14:19] the Baptist, some Elisha, some Jeremiah
[1:14:21] or one of the prophets?" And he said
[1:14:23] unto them, "But who say you that I am?"
[1:14:27] Church, that's the greatest question you
[1:14:28] have to answer this morning, whether you
[1:14:30] believe it, whether you realize it or
[1:14:31] not. Who is Jesus Christ
[1:14:34] today?
[1:14:37] Who is Jesus Christ? And how do you know
[1:14:39] who he is? It says, "And Simon Peter
[1:14:42] answered and said, Thou art the Christ,
[1:14:44] the Son of the living God. And Jesus
[1:14:46] answered and said unto him, blessed art
[1:14:48] thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and
[1:14:50] blood had not revealed it unto thee, but
[1:14:53] my father which is in heaven." So Peter
[1:14:55] absolutely has a a supernatural, a
[1:14:58] heavenly revelation of who Christ is
[1:15:00] standing in front of him. Amen. We can't
[1:15:03] say anything but what Jesus said. And
[1:15:05] Jesus said, "Listen, this is a
[1:15:06] revelation that came from above." Amen.
[1:15:10] But he says, "And I say unto thee,"
[1:15:12] watch what this revelation will do. "I
[1:15:14] say unto thee that thou art Peter, and
[1:15:17] upon this rock will I build my church,
[1:15:20] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:15:24] against it." In other words, there's
[1:15:26] something coming against the gates of
[1:15:27] hell that will prevail where hell used
[1:15:30] to prevail.
[1:15:34] And he's not just talking about himself
[1:15:36] because he says on this rock will I
[1:15:38] build my church
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:15:42] against what? The church that is built
[1:15:45] on the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:15:50] God told Abraham, "Your seed will
[1:15:52] possess."
[1:15:54] And then God Jesus comes to Peter and
[1:15:56] his disciples and he says, "You're going
[1:15:58] to possess."
[1:15:59] There's a transference that's got to
[1:16:01] happen here. Amen. The gates of hell
[1:16:03] can't prevail against one thing, the
[1:16:05] revelation of who Jesus Christ is. Amen.
[1:16:08] The church is not built on Peter. That's
[1:16:10] a Catholic dogma that's taught. If we
[1:16:13] build it on Peter, Peter fails right
[1:16:14] after this. So, we're building on a
[1:16:16] cracked and broken foundation.
[1:16:19] But the church is built on one
[1:16:21] revelation who is Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:16:24] It's the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:26] Now, Christ went and proved who he was
[1:16:28] when he went to hell and hell couldn't
[1:16:30] hold him.
[1:16:31] That's when he proved who he was. He
[1:16:33] took the keys of death and hell as we
[1:16:34] read in Revelation 1. And then he
[1:16:36] ascended back to heaven. Church, that's
[1:16:38] total victory. When you can go to the
[1:16:40] lowest possible region of of the the the
[1:16:43] the different layers of this this earth
[1:16:46] and this cosmos, go to where the powers
[1:16:48] of hell are greatest. You walk into
[1:16:50] there. They think they've won. And all
[1:16:51] you do is you go in and you take the
[1:16:53] keys to their house. That's total
[1:16:55] victory. Not only do you have the keys
[1:16:57] to death and hell in the grave, but now
[1:16:59] you go back to the highest levels
[1:17:03] and you rule and reign.
[1:17:06] That's a total victory when you can go
[1:17:09] from the lowest to the highest.
[1:17:12] That's what prevailing looks like,
[1:17:14] church. But he says, listen, I'm not the
[1:17:16] only one that's going to do it. You're
[1:17:18] going to do it as well. You may come
[1:17:20] from the lowest, but you'll go back to
[1:17:21] the highest. There will be a prevailing
[1:17:23] revelation inside of your life. And
[1:17:25] that's what we're talking about. Christ
[1:17:27] possessed the gate of his enemies. He
[1:17:29] came away with the keys. He proved that
[1:17:30] he was the word. Proved that the word
[1:17:32] was true. And he was the present day
[1:17:35] revelation of the word of God. That's
[1:17:37] what the Jesus Christ is. Scripture says
[1:17:39] the word was God. The word was with God.
[1:17:42] The word was God. And the word was made
[1:17:44] flesh and dwelt among us. Jesus Christ
[1:17:46] was the revelation of the word of God
[1:17:48] for that day in flesh. Amen. But Jesus
[1:17:52] isn't just talking about himself here.
[1:17:54] Amen. And he says, "Look, the church is
[1:17:56] built on the revelation of who I am. And
[1:17:58] when they get that revelation, hell will
[1:18:01] not be able to prevail against them.
[1:18:03] They'll possess the gates of their
[1:18:04] enemies." Jesus put that in the future
[1:18:07] with Peter and every other true son and
[1:18:10] daughter of God. Amen. Peter had a
[1:18:13] revelation here, but I want you to catch
[1:18:16] something. The revelation Peter had here
[1:18:19] did not hold him.
[1:18:22] Peter didn't prevail with this
[1:18:23] revelation.
[1:18:25] You know when Peter prevailed with this
[1:18:27] revelation? When it was present with
[1:18:29] him.
[1:18:31] When Peter knew that Jesus was there,
[1:18:33] Peter prevailed. When Peter remembered
[1:18:36] where Jesus was and that he was with
[1:18:37] them, he prevailed. Remember Peter as
[1:18:41] soon as he realized Jesus on the water,
[1:18:43] oh Lord, call me. I'll come to you. And
[1:18:45] he's looking at the word and that
[1:18:47] revelation allows him to walk on the
[1:18:49] water. But then he looks at
[1:18:50] circumstances, forgets that the present
[1:18:53] word is there, and he starts to fall
[1:18:54] down, starts to sink, and then he pulls
[1:18:57] him back up, and he walks on the water
[1:18:58] back. He prevailed over the water twice.
[1:19:00] Why? Because he had a revelation of the
[1:19:03] word of God in their midst. Amen. Peter
[1:19:06] was strong when he was there. Peter had
[1:19:07] the victory when Jesus was there. But
[1:19:09] Peter was weak whenever he forgot that
[1:19:11] Jesus was there. Peter was weak when
[1:19:14] Jesus wasn't present. Peter failed when
[1:19:16] the present word was absent.
[1:19:19] That was his failing. Peter's revelation
[1:19:22] of Jesus Christ was external to him. And
[1:19:25] because of that, as real as it was, that
[1:19:27] revelation would not hold him all the
[1:19:29] time unless Christ was there in person.
[1:19:32] He needed the revelation of the word
[1:19:34] right there. That's why Peter kept
[1:19:36] defaulting back to his own ways.
[1:19:40] When Jesus wasn't there, Peter went back
[1:19:42] to his old way of living. He went back
[1:19:44] to fishing. He went back to cursing. He
[1:19:46] went back to trying to do things on his
[1:19:48] own. Peter went back to disappointing
[1:19:49] himself.
[1:19:51] Why? Because the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:53] Christ wasn't there with him.
[1:19:56] It had gone away. It had died. It had
[1:19:58] passed away. It wasn't present, whatever
[1:20:00] it was. And so, he went back to saving
[1:20:02] his own skin was what he did. And just
[1:20:04] making a general mess of his life
[1:20:05] because the word wasn't there with him.
[1:20:08] But remember, he says, he said, "Flesh
[1:20:10] and blood never revealed this to you,
[1:20:11] but my father which is in heaven has
[1:20:13] revealed this to you. Upon this rock,
[1:20:15] I'll build my church." the revelation of
[1:20:18] the word in its season. [snorts]
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll build my church and the gates
[1:20:24] of hell cannot prevail against it. Jesus
[1:20:27] gave this great revelation, this great
[1:20:29] promise to Peter that when he got the
[1:20:32] true revelation of who Christ was
[1:20:34] personally to him, the gates of hell
[1:20:36] would not prevail against it. Peter had
[1:20:39] lots of little failings before that,
[1:20:40] some big failings, too. But when he
[1:20:42] comes into the present truth revelation
[1:20:45] of who Christ is, that's when Peter gets
[1:20:47] set settled down. He says, "Peter,
[1:20:48] listen. You're going to get settled
[1:20:51] and you're going to live in a place
[1:20:53] where the gates of hell can't can't
[1:20:55] prevail against you." He says, "Listen,
[1:20:58] Satan is he's going to try and sift you
[1:21:00] as wheat."
[1:21:03] He says, "But I prayed for you."
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when you're converted,
[1:21:07] strengthen your brothers."
[1:21:10] Peter, there's a time coming. You think
[1:21:12] you've got it all now. You think you'd
[1:21:13] go with me to death. You won't. He says,
[1:21:14] "But listen, there's a revelation coming
[1:21:16] that'll hold you and hell won't prevail
[1:21:18] against you anymore. You will conquer
[1:21:21] it." Amen. That's the undefeable
[1:21:24] revelation that we have to have. Who is
[1:21:27] Jesus Christ today? Amen. That's our
[1:21:30] strength. That's our power. That's our
[1:21:33] holding uh uh
[1:21:36] anchor is who Christ is. And that's got
[1:21:40] to be personal to us. this morning. It's
[1:21:42] got to be a personal revelation. Peter's
[1:21:44] revelation was true,
[1:21:47] but it wasn't personal in him.
[1:21:51] It was personal outside of him.
[1:21:54] You are it. You prevail. You have the
[1:21:58] power. You have the strength. You can
[1:22:01] hold. Everything was in something
[1:22:03] outside of him. And so when Christ was
[1:22:05] gone, Peter didn't have it. Peter
[1:22:07] believed to a point. Peter preached to a
[1:22:12] point. Peter confessed to a point. Peter
[1:22:15] held on to a point. Peter got the
[1:22:17] victory to a point. But Peter needed
[1:22:19] something greater so he could go beyond
[1:22:21] that point and go all the way to total
[1:22:23] victory. Amen. And it was going to take
[1:22:25] a personal revelation. Peter needed a a
[1:22:27] revelation of the prevailing faith of
[1:22:30] the present Christ in him.
[1:22:33] Not just a man that was standing before
[1:22:35] him. Amen. a place where he could know
[1:22:37] the will of God for him and he could
[1:22:38] walk with total faith knowing that he
[1:22:41] would prevail. That's what Peter needed.
[1:22:43] Jesus was telling Peter and the rest of
[1:22:45] the true church. Remember, church is not
[1:22:48] people that gather in a building. Church
[1:22:50] means called out ones. God called you
[1:22:53] out of where you were into what he has
[1:22:55] for you. We are not the church because
[1:22:58] we go to church. We are the church
[1:23:00] because he has called us out. Amen.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; He says, 'Look, you're in the promise
[1:23:05] with me. We're all part of the seed.
[1:23:07] That's what he was trying to get them to
[1:23:08] see. You're in me and I'm in you. Paul
[1:23:11] would say this in Ephesians. He says,
[1:23:12] 'Grace be to you and peace from God our
[1:23:15] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:23:16] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[1:23:18] Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us
[1:23:21] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:23:23] places where in Christ. According as he
[1:23:27] has chosen us where?
[1:23:30] Who chose?
[1:23:32] He chose us in him
[1:23:37] before the foundation of the world that
[1:23:39] we should be holy and without blame
[1:23:41] before him in love, having predestinated
[1:23:44] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:23:46] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:23:48] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:23:51] of the glory of one thing,
[1:23:54] his grace,
[1:23:56] his unmmerited favor. He says, "Wherein
[1:24:00] he had made us accepted in the beloved."
[1:24:03] Church, that ought to make a shout this
[1:24:04] morning to know that he chose us in him
[1:24:08] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:24:09] world. We didn't pick it. We didn't
[1:24:11] choose it. We don't determine it. We
[1:24:13] don't deserve it. It has nothing to do
[1:24:14] with us. It is the grace of God. And
[1:24:17] therefore, what comes out of our lives
[1:24:18] is to the praise of the glory of one
[1:24:21] thing and one thing alone, the grace of
[1:24:23] almighty God.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; That's what we are there where we are
[1:24:26] this morning. So when Christ but he says
[1:24:28] we were chosen in him. So when Christ
[1:24:30] went and Christ overcame if we are in
[1:24:33] him then where is our position this
[1:24:35] morning?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Where are we standing this morning? If
[1:24:38] it was through him if we were in Christ
[1:24:40] from before the beginning
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; and Christ went and overcame. Then guess
[1:24:46] who got overcoming when Christ overcame?
[1:24:50] This guy. This group of people. Amen.
[1:24:53] When Christ went down to hell and took
[1:24:54] the keys of death and hell and the
[1:24:56] grave, guess who got them, too? You and
[1:24:59] I. Because we were in him before the
[1:25:01] foundation of the world. So, when we're
[1:25:03] in him, we get the characteristics. We
[1:25:05] get the attributes. We get the
[1:25:06] inheritance. We get the blessings. We
[1:25:08] get the overcoming power. We get the
[1:25:10] everpresent mighty God in our midst.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; That's where we are. Amen. Listen to
[1:25:16] what Paul says again. He says, "If ye be
[1:25:18] Christs,
[1:25:21] are you Christs? He says, "Then are you
[1:25:24] Abraham's seed?"
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; And if you're Abraham's seed, then you
[1:25:28] are heirs according to the promise.
[1:25:30] What's the promise? You will possess the
[1:25:33] gates of your enemies. That's the
[1:25:36] promise. Amen. What is an heir, church?
[1:25:41] An heir is somebody that receives the
[1:25:44] the the things the that somebody has
[1:25:46] already built up and owns. Amen. They
[1:25:50] It's a transferral of benefits and
[1:25:52] property. An heir does nothing to
[1:25:55] deserve what they get. They get it
[1:25:58] because they are a part of the one that
[1:26:00] gave it to them.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] Are you hearing me this morning?
[1:26:07] You are an heir in Christ by his grace.
[1:26:11] You didn't deserve it. You can't do
[1:26:13] anything to deserve it.
[1:26:16] Don't try and earn your healing.
[1:26:18] Don't try and earn your forgiveness.
[1:26:21] Don't try and earn your deliverance,
[1:26:23] church. You can't earn Jehovah Gyra. He
[1:26:28] is Jehovah Gyra. You don't earn it. That
[1:26:32] is just who he is. Amen. And we are
[1:26:34] heirs of his nature and of his blessing.
[1:26:36] I say hallelujah this morning. Amen. You
[1:26:39] can't earn Jehovah Gyra. That is just
[1:26:41] who and what he is. Let's tie it
[1:26:44] together as we start to close this
[1:26:45] morning. He says, he said, 'Abraham,
[1:26:47] because you've done this, I will bless
[1:26:49] the nations by you and your seat after
[1:26:50] you. He says, here you are, sick people,
[1:26:53] listen.
[1:26:55] Do we have any sick this morning? And
[1:26:58] sinner friend of mine, listen to this.
[1:27:00] He said to the seed, who is Abraham's
[1:27:02] seed? He says, you who are born of the
[1:27:04] spirit of God, you take on Abraham's
[1:27:06] seed and are hes according to the
[1:27:08] promise. He says, is that right? That's
[1:27:10] what the Bible said. And he
[1:27:11] said,"Abraham, because you've done this,
[1:27:13] I sorry, Abraham, because you made this
[1:27:16] act, I will bless you and your seed, and
[1:27:19] your seed shall possess his enemy's
[1:27:21] gate." He says, "Hallelujah. If sickness
[1:27:23] is in your road, you're the boss." He
[1:27:26] says, "Your seed will possess the gate
[1:27:28] of his enemy." Hallelujah. He says,
[1:27:29] "When I think that is God's eternal
[1:27:32] promise, I possess the gate of the
[1:27:35] enemy." He says, "Hallelujah." He says,
[1:27:37] "I've got what? a Lord Jesus who died
[1:27:41] for me. I'm no good. Never was, never
[1:27:44] will be, and you're not either. But
[1:27:46] Jesus Christ was God's perfect
[1:27:49] sacrifice. And through his shed blood
[1:27:51] and obedience to the father, we can
[1:27:54] possess any enemy's gate and triumph. He
[1:27:57] says, "Your seed shall possess the gates
[1:27:59] of the enemy." He says, "Hallelujah.
[1:28:01] Through Jesus, I'm safe ever more."
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord this morning. Praise the
[1:28:07] Lord this morning that you can possess
[1:28:10] the gate of your enemy. I know we've
[1:28:12] read it twice. We're going to read it
[1:28:13] again in John 5:4. This is such a
[1:28:15] beautiful scripture. It encapsulates our
[1:28:17] entire walk. He says, "For whatsoever is
[1:28:21] born of God overcometh the world." And
[1:28:26] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:28:28] world, even our faith. It is our new
[1:28:30] birth that gives us the revelation that
[1:28:33] we are a part of God.
[1:28:37] And that gives us faith to overcome.
[1:28:41] Your new birth gives you faith to
[1:28:44] overcome. Amen. When God puts his holy
[1:28:47] spirit inside of you, his own life into
[1:28:50] our soul. That is the new birth. The new
[1:28:52] birth is not water baptism. It's not a
[1:28:54] confession. It's not repentance. The new
[1:28:56] birth is when you die to yourself and
[1:28:59] Christ lives inside of you by his spirit
[1:29:02] and you come out a new creation and you
[1:29:04] start to grow in Christ and you start to
[1:29:06] mature in Christ and you start to
[1:29:08] produce the life of Christ because
[1:29:10] that's the life that's in you now. It's
[1:29:12] not the life of mommy and daddy. It's
[1:29:14] not the life of past decisions and
[1:29:15] mistakes. It's the life of almighty God
[1:29:17] that's now coming up through human
[1:29:19] flesh. Amen. We grow in Christ by the
[1:29:22] spirit, not by joining church. Remember
[1:29:25] what Paul said in 1 Corinthians 12? By
[1:29:28] one spirit we're baptized into one body.
[1:29:32] You can't get into the church. You can't
[1:29:33] into can't get into Christ by coming
[1:29:35] here and having a confession. You can't
[1:29:37] sign a a a church book. We don't have
[1:29:39] one anyways. But it's by the Holy Spirit
[1:29:42] entering into your soul and dwelling in
[1:29:44] human flesh. That's how you are born
[1:29:46] again. Amen.
[1:29:49] It's the indwelling spirit of God that
[1:29:51] makes you a part of the church of God.
[1:29:53] Listen to what Paul says again. And he
[1:29:55] says, "And because you are sons,
[1:29:59] you always were. You always will be. He
[1:30:03] chose us in him before the foundation of
[1:30:05] the world. And because you are sons, God
[1:30:08] has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:30:10] into your hearts crying, "Aba, Father."
[1:30:14] The reason you can receive the Holy
[1:30:15] Ghost is because you always were a child
[1:30:18] of God.
[1:30:21] Only sons can receive the spirit of the
[1:30:24] father.
[1:30:26] That's it. So when you receive the Holy
[1:30:29] Spirit, you know why you have to have a
[1:30:31] revelation that you've been born again?
[1:30:33] Cuz until you do, you can't go into
[1:30:35] adoption.
[1:30:36] You can't grow in Christ. You'll only go
[1:30:39] so far and then you'll stagnate because
[1:30:41] you don't know who you are
[1:30:44] and you don't know who he is truly.
[1:30:47] [snorts]
[1:30:48] He says, "Because you are sons, God has
[1:30:50] sent forth the spirit of his son into
[1:30:52] your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." Now,
[1:30:54] what happens when he does that, church?
[1:30:56] Wherefore, thou art no more,
[1:31:01] no more a servant, but a son. And if a
[1:31:04] son, then you are an heir of God through
[1:31:07] Christ. He says, you used to be a
[1:31:09] servant.
[1:31:10] You were never a servant, but you
[1:31:12] thought you were a servant because you
[1:31:14] were bound. You were under somebody's
[1:31:16] authority. something else made you do
[1:31:18] things. You didn't have a choice.
[1:31:21] Servants don't have choices. They just
[1:31:22] do what they're told to do. You had no
[1:31:24] freedom. You didn't know you were a
[1:31:26] child of God. But when God gave you his
[1:31:28] spirit, the first revelation that comes
[1:31:31] is I'm no longer a slave. I'm no longer
[1:31:33] a servant. I am a child of God.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He says, "And when you realize you're a
[1:31:37] child, then you realize you've got an
[1:31:39] inheritance coming your way because all
[1:31:42] the children of God are heirs of God.
[1:31:45] You got something that he set aside for
[1:31:46] you. Amen. It let you know that you
[1:31:48] didn't have to be bound.
[1:31:51] You got choices. We're going to get into
[1:31:52] it as we get into gates. You can be
[1:31:54] bound if you want to be bound, but you
[1:31:55] don't have to stay bound this morning.
[1:31:56] Amen. Are you catching it this morning?
[1:31:59] What is the prevailing revelation of our
[1:32:01] victory? It's Christ in you.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; It's not Christ 2,000 years ago. It's
[1:32:07] not Christ on a cross. It's not Christ
[1:32:09] in heaven. It's Christ right here. Amen.
[1:32:11] It is God telling you, "You are a part
[1:32:14] of me. You always have been. You always
[1:32:17] will be. And because my spirit is within
[1:32:20] you, you do not have to bow down before
[1:32:22] anyone that tries to take mastery over
[1:32:24] you.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; You are not a servant. You are not a
[1:32:27] slave. You are a child of God."
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:31] You don't have to bow to anyone this
[1:32:32] morning, church.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; No power, no influence, no circumstance,
[1:32:36] no sickness.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do it. Amen. He says,
[1:32:40] "And because of that, you will prevail
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; because the same spirit that was in
[1:32:45] Christ dwells inside of you. And that is
[1:32:48] a conquering spirit. That is a ruling
[1:32:51] spirit." Amen. That is a spirit of
[1:32:54] liberty.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it cannot do anything
[1:32:58] but produce what it produced the first
[1:33:01] time.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts]
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Church, it's already chosen and
[1:33:06] declared.
[1:33:08] It's already finished from an eternal
[1:33:10] standpoint. Amen. You couldn't stop it
[1:33:12] if you tried. Satan can't stop it though
[1:33:15] he tries. It's already to determine you
[1:33:19] shall possess the gate of your enemies.
[1:33:22] That's the promise of a child of God.
[1:33:25] That's the promise of a seed of Abraham.
[1:33:27] Hallelujah. Sickness can't stop it. This
[1:33:29] world can't stop it. The finances of
[1:33:31] your life can't stop it. The decree of
[1:33:33] your parents can't stop it. Your bad
[1:33:36] decisions you've made can't stop it. You
[1:33:39] will prevail.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he said you would.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; That's all I'm resting on this morning.
[1:33:47] Not that I can do it, but because he
[1:33:49] said I will. And all I've got today,
[1:33:52] this morning, is a revelation. I'm a
[1:33:54] child of God. And so all that lays
[1:33:57] before me is prevail.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Prevail. Prevail.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; That's the cry of my heart. I will not
[1:34:05] back down.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Don't give back the ground you've won so
[1:34:10] hard.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Hold fast that which thou hast declared.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Stick with it. Amen. It's already done.
[1:34:17] Why? Because you came from God.
[1:34:19] Hallelujah. And you go back to God.
[1:34:21] Christ said it. And you've got to be
[1:34:23] able to recognize the same thing. If you
[1:34:25] were in Christ before the foundation of
[1:34:27] the world, then you've got to go back to
[1:34:29] where you came from.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Origin is destiny.
[1:34:34] Nothing can stop it. The most
[1:34:36] frustrating thing for Satan to see is
[1:34:38] people that won't give up.
[1:34:41] Because every day brings us closer to
[1:34:43] total victory. And he knows it. He knows
[1:34:45] it. Talk about a position of dominion.
[1:34:50] Talk about a prevailing revelation. You
[1:34:52] are an expression of God today.
[1:34:57] Paul says this in Ephesians that the God
[1:34:59] of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of
[1:35:01] glory may give unto you the spirit of
[1:35:03] two things wisdom and revelation.
[1:35:07] Wisdom is how revelation is what? Wisdom
[1:35:12] is how to apply the revelation. He says
[1:35:15] in the knowledge of him he says the eyes
[1:35:18] of your understanding been enlightened
[1:35:20] that you may what? Believe,
[1:35:24] think, presume that you may know.
[1:35:31] That you may know what is the hope of
[1:35:33] his calling and what the riches of the
[1:35:36] glory of his inheritance in the saints.
[1:35:38] In other words, Paul's saying, listen,
[1:35:39] this will go from being a thought or a
[1:35:42] belief. It'll take you into the reality
[1:35:43] of the word of God. It'll take you into
[1:35:46] the reality of the riches of God. It'll
[1:35:48] take you to the inheritance that he has
[1:35:49] for you. He says, "And in that you will
[1:35:51] know what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:35:54] whose power?" His power
[1:35:58] according to the working to us word who
[1:36:01] do what? Believe.
[1:36:04] What's he asking us to do, church?
[1:36:06] Believe
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; the exceeding greatness. In other words,
[1:36:10] if you think something is super
[1:36:12] powerful, take that and what he has is
[1:36:14] beyond what you can even think.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Exceeding greatness. Have [snorts] you
[1:36:18] ever had a I'm sure brother Matt can
[1:36:21] identify with this. Maybe brother Chad,
[1:36:23] anybody that's worked on heavy
[1:36:24] equipment. You ever get to something
[1:36:26] where you think you're going to need a
[1:36:27] whole lot of strength and so you get
[1:36:29] there, maybe you take a big crowbar or
[1:36:31] something and you just give it
[1:36:33] everything you got cuz you know it's not
[1:36:35] going to come off easy and it just goes
[1:36:37] and you almost kill yourself because
[1:36:38] this thing pops off in your face or hits
[1:36:40] your shin or your foot or something like
[1:36:42] that. You're like, I'm going to have to
[1:36:44] give this everything I got to get it off
[1:36:45] and then just it's like it it wasn't
[1:36:47] even attached. Comes off so easy. That's
[1:36:50] what it's like when God gets a hold of
[1:36:51] things. The exceeding greatness.
[1:36:55] Ever have something I can [snorts]
[1:36:57] testify of this. You're doing a job and
[1:36:59] you're trying to use your own power
[1:37:02] and then you stop and you think there's
[1:37:04] a tool that they build for this.
[1:37:06] [laughter]
[1:37:07] Matt knows this and brother Chad
[1:37:08] definitely knows this. There's a tool
[1:37:10] that's built for this. And that tool
[1:37:12] takes what seems impossible with your
[1:37:15] own strength and it makes it so easy
[1:37:18] because it's built for the job. Well,
[1:37:20] let me tell you this church. God is
[1:37:22] built for the job. Whatever job you have
[1:37:24] this morning, whatever the
[1:37:25] circumstances, whatever the sickness,
[1:37:27] whatever the hardship, whatever it might
[1:37:29] be, his exceeding greatness of his power
[1:37:32] is directed one place, you and I.
[1:37:37] He says, according to the working of his
[1:37:39] mighty power. So, where's the power?
[1:37:44] Is the power up there?
[1:37:47] No.
[1:37:49] It's in here.
[1:37:51] That's where the power rests. It's not a
[1:37:54] person sitting up in heaven. It's not a
[1:37:57] man sitting there laying on a cross
[1:37:59] 2,000 years ago.
[1:38:01] It is a personal inddwelling of Almighty
[1:38:05] God in the believer that's working
[1:38:08] towards us. that's working through us,
[1:38:10] that's working for our benefit. Amen. He
[1:38:13] says, "Which he wrought in Christ when
[1:38:15] he raised him from the dead and set him
[1:38:17] at his own right hand in heavenly
[1:38:18] places." That was the expression of the
[1:38:19] full power of God, that he took one that
[1:38:21] was dead, went down to hell, and brought
[1:38:23] him all the way back up to heaven again.
[1:38:26] He says, "Far above all principality and
[1:38:29] power and might and dominion, and every
[1:38:32] name that is named, not only in this
[1:38:33] world, but also which is to come."
[1:38:36] That's the position and authority of
[1:38:37] Christ. That's the power that's given to
[1:38:39] him. But let's keep going. He says, "And
[1:38:41] he hath put all things under his feet
[1:38:44] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:38:46] things to the church, which is his
[1:38:50] body." Now, we preached on this. I'm not
[1:38:52] going to preach on it again. But if he's
[1:38:53] put everything under his feet, and you
[1:38:55] are the body, which includes the feet,
[1:38:57] then that puts you in what position?
[1:39:00] Above all.
[1:39:02] Not just above all, far above. all
[1:39:06] principality, power, might, and
[1:39:07] dominion. That's your position. But
[1:39:11] you've got to have a revelation that
[1:39:12] that's where you are.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; That you're a part of the body of
[1:39:15] Christ. Not that you're a church member,
[1:39:20] not that you're a faithful tithe payer,
[1:39:23] not that you're a faithful devotions
[1:39:24] person, but that you have received the
[1:39:27] very life of God inside of you. And
[1:39:30] because of that, you're baptized into
[1:39:32] his body. Young people, that is the only
[1:39:36] revelation you need this morning. I'm a
[1:39:38] child of God and I know it because he's
[1:39:40] given me his spirit and he's changed my
[1:39:43] life. He says, which is his body, the
[1:39:46] fullness of him that fillth all in all.
[1:39:48] The fullness of Christ is passed down
[1:39:50] into the entire bride. And together
[1:39:54] we're the complete expression of Christ.
[1:39:56] That's your prevailing revelation for
[1:39:58] your victory. This morning we read the
[1:40:00] scripture on Wednesday where Paul said,
[1:40:02] "Listen, I I I've experienced being
[1:40:04] humiliated. I've experienced abounding
[1:40:06] and having more than I ever needed, but
[1:40:08] I've learned in every state that I'm in
[1:40:10] to be content."
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us to do that. But then
[1:40:13] he would say these words. He says, "I
[1:40:15] can do."
[1:40:18] That word there is the same word avail.
[1:40:20] It's the same word prevail.
[1:40:22] Paul's saying, "I prevail. I always
[1:40:25] prevail
[1:40:27] over what?
[1:40:31] All things
[1:40:35] I can do. I prevail over all things.
[1:40:40] How? Through Christ which strengthens
[1:40:44] me. Paul's not speaking of an outside
[1:40:47] force that comes and goes. Paul's
[1:40:50] talking about an abiding presence.
[1:40:54] Amen. When you know that you know that
[1:40:57] you know he abides
[1:41:00] that he has called me to him. He has
[1:41:03] poured himself into me. And because of
[1:41:05] that I can run through a troop. I can
[1:41:09] leap over a wall. I can go through
[1:41:11] sickness. I can go through hardship. I
[1:41:13] can go through pain. I can go through
[1:41:15] suffering. And I can go through healing.
[1:41:17] I can go through provision. I can go
[1:41:19] through great times. I can go through
[1:41:20] bad times. It matters not because
[1:41:22] there's something living on the inside
[1:41:23] that takes me through. As we sang this
[1:41:25] morning, something keeps holding me.
[1:41:27] That's what Paul says. I can prevail
[1:41:29] over all things. Amen. Paul would go
[1:41:32] through things that would have crushed a
[1:41:33] mere mortal.
[1:41:36] Paul was whipped multiple times. Paul
[1:41:39] was stoned multiple times. Paul was cast
[1:41:42] in prison multiple times. He was
[1:41:44] shipwrecked. He was bitten by a
[1:41:45] poisonous snake.
[1:41:47] And nothing killed him. Church, I'm
[1:41:50] trying to tell you this morning, you are
[1:41:51] not a mere mortal. You are supernatural
[1:41:54] beings having a natural experience.
[1:41:57] Amen. And we wonder sometimes, why is it
[1:42:01] that these things happen to us? Well,
[1:42:04] look at what happens at the end and say,
[1:42:05] why does that happen to me and not
[1:42:06] everybody else as well? Because not
[1:42:09] everybody gets at the end what we get,
[1:42:11] which is I can do all things through
[1:42:13] Christ which strengthens me. In the good
[1:42:15] times, in the bad times, the up times,
[1:42:18] the down times, something holds us.
[1:42:22] Something takes us through.
[1:42:24] Paul would say this, "For this cause I
[1:42:26] bow my knees unto the father of our Lord
[1:42:28] Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family
[1:42:30] in heaven and earth is named, that
[1:42:33] [snorts] he would grant you according to
[1:42:35] the riches of his glory
[1:42:38] to be strengthened with might by his
[1:42:42] spirit in the inner man."
[1:42:45] Hallelujah.
[1:42:49] That's the holding power.
[1:42:51] He says that Christ might dwell in your
[1:42:53] hearts by one thing, faith. What is
[1:42:57] faith? Faith is a revelation of the will
[1:43:00] of God. Faith is a revelation of who he
[1:43:03] is today.
[1:43:05] That's the faith you need for today. He
[1:43:07] says that ye being rooted and grounded
[1:43:09] in love. What? That whatever comes my
[1:43:12] way, he loves me. He says that you may
[1:43:15] be able to comprehend. That you may
[1:43:18] grasp. that you would know the reality
[1:43:20] with all saints. What is the breadth,
[1:43:24] the length, the depth, and the height?
[1:43:29] What of this great strength?
[1:43:33] How far can you go and break that
[1:43:35] strength? You can't.
[1:43:38] How far can you go and he's not there?
[1:43:41] David [snorts] said, "If I if I uh
[1:43:43] spread the wings, if I go to the wings
[1:43:45] of the morning, dwell in the depths of
[1:43:46] the sea,
[1:43:49] even in the darkness, doesn't matter
[1:43:51] where I go, you you find me. You're
[1:43:53] there."
[1:43:56] He says, "To know the love of Christ,
[1:43:58] which passes knowledge, that you may be
[1:44:00] filled with all the fullness of God."
[1:44:05] Now unto him,
[1:44:07] catch this. Now unto him that is able to
[1:44:12] do exceeding abundantly above all that
[1:44:15] we ask or think according to the power
[1:44:19] that workketh in one place church
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; in us.
[1:44:25] Can we read that? And I want you to say
[1:44:27] in me according to the power that
[1:44:30] workketh in me. Unto him be glory in the
[1:44:35] church of G Christ Jesus throughout all
[1:44:37] ages, the world without end. Amen.
[1:44:43] What gave Peter power to overcome?
[1:44:45] [snorts]
[1:44:46] Peter got a revelation of Christ in me.
[1:44:50] That's what it took.
[1:44:53] He's never left me. He's never failed
[1:44:55] me. He's always with me. Didn't matter
[1:44:58] if they put him in prison. Didn't matter
[1:45:00] if they beat him. Didn't matter if they
[1:45:02] pressured him. It didn't matter. He's
[1:45:03] always with me. He says, "Listen, we can
[1:45:05] only do what we've been told to do. And
[1:45:07] we've been told to go preach the gospel,
[1:45:09] so I'm going to preach the gospel no
[1:45:10] matter what." And he did. And he did it
[1:45:12] all the way to his death. Amen. Peter
[1:45:14] prevailed when he got a revelation of
[1:45:16] Christ in him. That was a victory that
[1:45:18] he needed. The scripture says that the
[1:45:20] priest looked at Peter and John and saw
[1:45:23] that they were ignorant and unlearned
[1:45:25] men. But it says, "But they took note
[1:45:28] that they had been with Jesus."
[1:45:30] I'm asking you this morning, do people
[1:45:32] know you've been with Jesus?
[1:45:34] Do people know you're with Jesus? That
[1:45:37] he's with you and you're with him. Amen,
[1:45:39] church. They were the present revelation
[1:45:42] of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:45] They were not the Christ, but they were
[1:45:48] anointed. That's what Christ means, the
[1:45:50] anointed ones. Christ poured himself
[1:45:52] into them, and he's done it for you and
[1:45:54] I. Amen. And through that they were
[1:45:57] strengthened with might by his spirit to
[1:46:00] prevail. And that's what they did. I'm
[1:46:03] going to read [snorts] two quotes as we
[1:46:04] close. The musicians can come. He says,
[1:46:06] "On the day of Pentecost, he sent down
[1:46:08] the Holy Ghost to continue through the
[1:46:11] Gentiles to take out a seed of promise
[1:46:13] to give to the Gentiles
[1:46:16] the offcasts to give to them the baptism
[1:46:19] of the Holy Ghost to bring them into the
[1:46:23] promise." What promise? Thy seed shall
[1:46:27] possess the gate of his enemies. He
[1:46:30] says, now we have a right to conquer all
[1:46:34] sickness.
[1:46:36] We don't have to conquer it. He says
[1:46:38] it's already conquered. We just have to
[1:46:41] claim the promise and go take it. He
[1:46:44] says it's already conquered. Death is
[1:46:47] conquered. Hell is conquered. Sickness
[1:46:49] is conquered. Temptation is conquered.
[1:46:51] All devils are conquered. Death is
[1:46:53] conquered. The grave is conquered. He
[1:46:55] says, "We stand in the gate taking it.
[1:46:58] We don't have to fire a shot. It's
[1:47:02] already been paid for." Hallelujah.
[1:47:04] Let's stand together. [snorts]
[1:47:08] Amen. When you realize
[1:47:11] he conquered,
[1:47:13] he possessed the gates,
[1:47:16] all you have to do is take that key of
[1:47:19] faith and walk up and say, "This is
[1:47:22] mine." That's it. It's already
[1:47:25] conquered. You say, "Brother John, the
[1:47:27] key isn't turning very easily.
[1:47:30] It's rusted up by years of lack of use."
[1:47:35] Maybe it's a key that's been sitting in
[1:47:36] Newfoundland for a while.
[1:47:39] I don't care how good your keyholes are
[1:47:40] here. They get rusted up eventually.
[1:47:43] But the hand of faith will turn that key
[1:47:45] and say, "This belongs to me.
[1:47:48] You can't stay here. You're a conquered
[1:47:51] enemy."
[1:47:54] Cuz greater is he that's in me
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; than he that's waiting behind those
[1:47:58] gates. You're a conquer. You're facing a
[1:48:00] conquered enemy this morning, church.
[1:48:02] We'll preach on it later, the Lord
[1:48:04] willing. Amen. But you've got to turn
[1:48:06] the key. your inheritance. You have an
[1:48:08] inheritance of everything that he's
[1:48:10] taken.
[1:48:11] Every redemptive blessing, every bit of
[1:48:14] authority that he has is given to the
[1:48:16] church to produce the word in her
[1:48:19] season.
[1:48:22] And all he's waiting for us to do say,
[1:48:24] "It's mine. I accept it." And then you
[1:48:27] walk forward and that gate's going to
[1:48:29] open because the master of all
[1:48:31] circumstances has the key that opens the
[1:48:33] gate to your enemy. Amen. God bless you.
[1:48:36] Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:48:39] Lord, thank you for your encouragement
[1:48:41] this morning. Lord, thank you for a word
[1:48:43] that shows us our position, Lord, that
[1:48:45] we're facing an enemy that does not even
[1:48:47] control his own vulnerabilities, Lord.
[1:48:50] That we're facing a defeated enemy,
[1:48:52] Lord, and that when we receive you into
[1:48:54] our souls, Lord, by the presence of your
[1:48:56] Holy Spirit, Lord, we are made more than
[1:48:59] conquerors, Lord. We're made overcomers,
[1:49:02] Lord. We've moved beyond the flesh and
[1:49:04] we moved into the supernatural, Lord, by
[1:49:06] your dwelling spirit inside of us, Lord.
[1:49:08] How thankful we are that you did the
[1:49:10] work, Lord. That you won the victory,
[1:49:12] Lord. That we're facing a defeated enemy
[1:49:14] this morning, Lord. And all we have to
[1:49:16] do is by faith walk forward and
[1:49:18] accepted, Lord. I pray you help us to
[1:49:20] hold the ground that we've won, Lord. It
[1:49:22] was so wonderful hearing the testimonies
[1:49:24] at prayer service last night, Lord, of
[1:49:26] many gates that have been opened up and
[1:49:28] possessed, Lord. But I pray you help us
[1:49:30] to hold, knowing the enemy always pushes
[1:49:32] back. Lord, let us hold fast that which
[1:49:34] we've received. Lord, let us hold to
[1:49:36] that which we've claimed. Lord, let us
[1:49:39] hold the gates of our enemies against
[1:49:40] all comers this morning. Lord, bless
[1:49:42] your people, Lord. May you just minister
[1:49:45] in our hearts and souls, Lord. You see
[1:49:46] the the cry of our hearts, Lord. Lord,
[1:49:49] you see the travail of our souls this
[1:49:51] morning, Lord. for lost souls. Lord, for
[1:49:53] those that are struggling, for those
[1:49:55] that are weary, Lord, for those that are
[1:49:57] overwhelmed by the enemy, Lord, we pray
[1:49:59] that your spirit would raise up a
[1:50:00] standard in souls and lives this
[1:50:02] morning, Lord God. Lord, let us be
[1:50:04] overcomers, Lord. Let us intercede for
[1:50:06] others, Lord. Let us not hold this just
[1:50:08] to ourselves, Lord, but may we offer it
[1:50:10] to everyone that has need this morning,
[1:50:12] Lord God. Lord, as we stand together in
[1:50:14] faith, Lord, claiming, Lord, possession
[1:50:16] of the enemy's gates. Lord, when we wake
[1:50:19] up tomorrow morning, Lord, may you
[1:50:21] remind us we're a child of God. Lord,
[1:50:24] when the enemy comes in, may we stand up
[1:50:26] and say, "I'm a child of God." Lord, not
[1:50:29] because of anything we've done, but
[1:50:30] because you chose us and you've ordained
[1:50:32] us to possess the gates of our enemies,
[1:50:35] Lord God. Lord, what a wonderful place
[1:50:37] you you've given us.
[1:50:40] Lord, help us not leave it, Lord, rusted
[1:50:44] by lack of use, Lord. Let us not forget,
[1:50:48] Lord. Let us not live below, Lord, our
[1:50:51] privileges that you've won so hard for
[1:50:53] us this morning, Lord. But let us stand
[1:50:55] in faith, Lord, claiming every promise
[1:50:57] this morning, Lord. We ask these things
[1:50:59] this morning, committing this
[1:51:01] congregation to you. In Jesus Christ's
[1:51:03] name we ask it. Amen. [snorts]
[1:51:08] No longer a slave to fear. 12:19.

[2:04:23] All right, we're going to sing this, but

[2:04:44] [music] to get behind.
[2:04:47] Victory today is mine.
[2:04:53] Oh, when I woke this morning, I didn't
[2:04:57] [music and singing] have a doubt. I knew
[2:05:00] that the Lord would bring me out.
[2:05:05] So I got down on my knees and I said,
[2:05:09] "Lord, if you please." I got up,
[2:05:13] singing, and shouting, "The victory."
[2:05:18] Oh, victory is mine. [music]
[2:05:21] Victory is mine.
[2:05:25] Victory today is mine.
[2:05:30] Oh, I told Satan to get me high.

[2:06:11] happiness is mine. [singing]
[2:06:14] Happiness today is mine.
[2:06:20] I [singing and music] told Satan to get

[2:06:32] Oh, victory is mine. [music and singing]
[2:06:36] Victory is mine.

[2:06:44] Well, I told [music] Satan to get
[2:06:49] behind.
[2:06:51] Victory today is mine. [music]
[2:06:57] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. I've got a
[2:06:59] note here that says all the offices and
[2:07:02] officers have been voted in as we're on
[2:07:03] the ballot. So, we thank the Lord for
[2:07:06] that. God bless you for your faithful
[2:07:08] service. God be with us each one as we
[2:07:11] continue to serve him. Amen. I'm sorry I
[2:07:14] didn't preach too long this morning. Can
[2:07:15] we sing one more song before we give it
[2:07:17] over to brother Mark? I want to sing
[2:07:18] Bloodbot Church again. Amen. I feel like
[2:07:21] we only save that for the special
[2:07:22] meetings, but we need to remind
[2:07:24] ourselves we are brought with a price
[2:07:27] and that price gave us victory. Amen.
[2:07:29] So, I want to sing this this morning as
[2:07:30] we finish up. Brother Mark, you can come
[2:07:32] and give the the financial update for
[2:07:34] the for the last year. If you would do
[2:07:36] that and then we'll be closed. Amen. You
[2:07:38] don't have to stay for this if you don't
[2:07:39] want to churches. Technically, you can
[2:07:42] go whenever you want, I guess, really.
