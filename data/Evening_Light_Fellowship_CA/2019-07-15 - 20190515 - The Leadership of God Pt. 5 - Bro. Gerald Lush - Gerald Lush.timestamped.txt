[37:50] [Applause]
[37:54] [Music]
[38:43] praise the Lord everything comes back to
[38:47] love the man because this was God's plan
[38:51] purpose and pattern is to bring forth
[38:54] the love of God in his sons and
[38:56] daughters he may that's why he allowed
[38:59] that he allowed to happen what happened
[39:01] a man to cause us to be tested to we
[39:04] were testing a man and to bring hurt our
[39:07] love for him and see he wants someone to
[39:10] love him not because they're created to
[39:11] love you but because they know him and
[39:14] they love you amen
[39:16] the Angels the angels were there to talk
[39:18] God they were created with that with
[39:21] that nature and they and they love God
[39:24] but God wanted his sons and daughters to
[39:26] love him for who he is
[39:28] amen and as I said to know the mister
[39:32] love it and then oh god he's so loving
[39:34] by the grace of God so brother game like
[39:37] Sanders is the reason why God permitted
[39:41] what he permitted and brother thank God
[39:43] for the for the profit of the hour thank
[39:46] God for the promise to reveal the
[39:48] mystery of God so that we would know why
[39:51] why what was God's purpose was God's
[39:54] reason that he would he would allow
[39:56] these things to happen in the Garden of
[39:59] Eden not only that but going back to
[40:01] heaven that he would a lot even allow
[40:03] those things to happen with the devil
[40:05] and his angels
[40:06] amen and then he got lifted up with
[40:08] pride and fall and we're living in an
[40:11] hour to this day in this age brothers
[40:13] started with pride it's ending with
[40:15] pride oh yeah it's a generation now
[40:18] that's being lifted up with pride
[40:19] whether they're politicians or with no
[40:22] matter I won so he I was going to
[40:24] mention a certain profession but
[40:27] regardless of the profession they're
[40:29] looking for pride pride in what they do
[40:31] pride in how they do it but brother
[40:34] they're gonna they're gonna they're not
[40:35] going to give the glory to God
[40:37] they're gonna take the glory unto
[40:38] themselves and brother that's not what
[40:41] God is looking for in his sons and
[40:43] daughters they're gonna give the glory
[40:44] to you
[40:45] man whether it's you in your school with
[40:48] her shoe in your job with a shoe in your
[40:50] home and then they feel this is good
[40:53] this is good that's good well thank the
[40:55] Lord praise the Lord amen
[40:57] as I said as I said everybody told the
[41:00] story of our sister burns how she said
[41:03] that the devil had spent two hours
[41:06] discouraging her two hours making the
[41:08] picture Luke black and after a couple of
[41:12] hours she was she was washing clothes
[41:14] after a couple of hours the Holy Spirit
[41:17] came on the scene a man and she turned
[41:20] around and she said all right Satan
[41:21] you've been talking to me for the last
[41:23] whatever 2 or 3 or 4 hours now she said
[41:26] I'm gonna talk to you and she rebuked
[41:29] the devil and she gave the glory to God
[41:31] amen her brother and she loved the Lord
[41:35] amen and the devil is there to get us to
[41:37] question the love of God amen
[41:40] brother when we consider what he's done
[41:42] and what he's doing and what he will do
[41:45] we don't question the love of God he
[41:48] proved is love a man and it's an
[41:51] absolutely genuine love you just sink
[41:55] when he was on the cross and he looked
[41:57] down and all that he gave already
[41:59] endured absolutely completely and
[42:02] totally rejected amen and even the day
[42:05] even Peter he said you're going your hey
[42:07] see you'll deny me three times
[42:09] a man he and airy was a disciple for
[42:12] three and a half years with Jesus and he
[42:15] declared Jesus to be the Son of God a
[42:17] man
[42:18] oh yeah Jesus who do you say that I am
[42:20] there are the Christ the Son of the
[42:22] Living God and yet when when the test
[42:25] came eat an item oh yeah three times he
[42:29] denied him the others walked away but
[42:31] Peter followed and denied him and denied
[42:34] him and denied him amen brother
[42:36] but God was going to give him what he
[42:39] needed and that was the baptism of law
[42:42] so he would see God the way that God
[42:45] wanted him to see him amen
[42:47] that he would recognize God's character
[42:49] the way that God wanted him to see it
[42:51] and wreck
[42:52] nice a man and the results would be long
[42:55] a man so much love that when he laid
[42:58] down his life he wouldn't he didn't want
[43:01] to be crucified upright he said turn me
[43:04] upside down he said I'm not worth Oh
[43:06] what the law they love the Lord when the
[43:10] Holy Ghost came and they got the whole
[43:12] revelation of Jesus brother love they
[43:16] loved him
[43:17] when they saw what he did and what he
[43:19] could have done oh yeah what he could
[43:22] have done what even Nissa Nissa don't
[43:24] you think he said I could call on the
[43:26] father and he will send me twelve
[43:27] legions of angels a man and destroy the
[43:30] world and set me free but he wouldn't do
[43:33] it he could would you oh I can do this
[43:37] and I can do that but there's sometimes
[43:39] God wants you to endure either a that
[43:42] endureth unto the end the same shall be
[43:44] saved a man it's not God has given us
[43:47] power over all the part of the enemy but
[43:49] sometimes you have to endure what the
[43:51] enemy is doing he that endureth under
[43:54] the end the same shall be saved
[43:57] endure what persecution tribulation oh
[43:59] yeah all these things that the enemy was
[44:02] going to bring upon us amen for the
[44:05] Gospels sake and because Jesus did it
[44:08] for you you're going to do it for him
[44:10] amen
[44:11] as he laid down his life for us we lay
[44:14] down our lives for him amen we're gonna
[44:16] bear the reproach praise the Lord for
[44:19] the glory of God because why because we
[44:22] recognize he loved us now we're gonna
[44:24] love him

[57:17] Oh
[57:38] amen praise the name of the Lord
[57:41] god bless you amen turn with me dudes
[57:44] First Samuel Chapter eight first time
[57:48] you Chapter eight
[57:50] amen the grace of God be with us as we
[57:58] go to his word God wants to lead us by
[58:04] His Word and in 1st Samuel Chapter eight
[58:09] and beginning to read at verse 1 and it
[58:14] came to pass when Samuel was old that he
[58:19] made his sons judges over Israel now the
[58:23] name of his firstborn was Joel the name
[58:27] of his second Abhaya and they were
[58:31] judges in Beersheba and his sons walked
[58:36] not in his ways but turned aside after
[58:40] lucre or money and took bribes and
[58:44] perverted judgment unlike Samuel they
[58:48] were not led by the spirit a man they
[58:52] were led by human flesh free desires and
[58:56] it says then all the elders of Israel
[59:00] gathered themselves together and came to
[59:03] Samuel onto Rama and said unto Him
[59:07] behold thou art old and thy sons walk
[59:11] not in thy ways now make us a king to
[59:17] judge us like all the nations a man
[59:22] regardless of Samuel Zeze should have
[59:25] remained under his leadership a man but
[59:29] the thing displeased Samuel when they
[59:32] said give us a king to judge us and
[59:37] Samuel prayed unto the Lord a man and
[59:41] the Lord said unto Samuel arkin unto the
[59:46] voice of the people in all that they say
[59:50] unto thee for they have not rejected
[59:55] thee but they have rejected me a man not
[1:00:02] rejecting Samuel it was rejecting God
[1:00:05] not rejecting the ministry as rejecting
[1:00:09] the Lord a man and in verse 10 and
[1:00:13] Samuel told all the words of the Lord
[1:00:17] unto the people that asked of him a king
[1:00:20] a man and he said this will be the
[1:00:26] manner of the king that shall reign over
[1:00:30] you he will take your sons and appoint
[1:00:34] them for himself a man and for his
[1:00:40] chariots and to be his horsemen and some
[1:00:45] shall run before his chariots that
[1:00:50] things would be required of them under a
[1:00:53] king that wasn't required to them under
[1:00:56] the prophet or the leadership of God a
[1:01:01] man and on down to verse 19 nevertheless
[1:01:08] the people refused to obey the voice of
[1:01:13] Samuel and they say nay but we will have
[1:01:19] a king over us a man that we also may be
[1:01:27] like all the nations but there are those
[1:01:32] again that our believers they want to be
[1:01:34] like the denomination's a man the spirit
[1:01:39] of the attitude the motives the
[1:01:43] objectives as it was with Israel so that
[1:01:48] we also may be like all the
[1:01:50] nations and that our King may judge us
[1:01:53] and go out before us and fight our
[1:01:56] battles well didn't the Lord do it a man
[1:02:00] he did and that's why they were free
[1:02:03] that's why they had the Liberty that
[1:02:05] they had that's why they had the
[1:02:06] blessings that they had is because they
[1:02:09] follow God's leadership through his
[1:02:10] servant Samuel amen and Samuel heard all
[1:02:15] the words of the people and he rehearsed
[1:02:19] them in the ears of the Lord well God
[1:02:22] knew what they said God knew what they
[1:02:25] were thinking a man and God knew it
[1:02:27] before he told Samuel to go ahead and
[1:02:29] listen to them do what they want a man
[1:02:32] because God a man God permitted it it
[1:02:35] was a permissive will of God Amen
[1:02:38] because God was going to punish Israel
[1:02:40] God was going to chase them Israel
[1:02:42] Israel is going to pay a price for
[1:02:44] failure for failing to follow his
[1:02:46] leadership a man brother/sister and the
[1:02:50] same thing with you and me we don't
[1:02:52] follow God's leadership we pay a price
[1:02:54] Amen God Elvis andus and you heard all
[1:02:57] the words of the people and he rehearsed
[1:03:00] them in the ears of the Lord and the
[1:03:02] Lord said to Samuel arkin unto their
[1:03:06] voice and make them a king amen and
[1:03:11] Samuel said unto the men of Israel go ye
[1:03:14] every man in unto rather is City amen
[1:03:22] go ye every man unto his city god bless
[1:03:26] to work the reading of the word you may
[1:03:27] be seated and this was a text that the
[1:03:33] prophet of God used in the Ministry of a
[1:03:37] message that he preached again in 1960
[1:03:42] and it was entitled the rejected King
[1:03:47] amen
[1:03:49] they read they rejected a king so that
[1:03:52] they could have another king they
[1:03:54] rejected their heavenly king and their
[1:03:57] spiritual king so that they could have a
[1:03:59] natural king like you like the nations
[1:04:02] that were around
[1:04:03] they wanted to refuse the leadership of
[1:04:06] the King of Kings and the Lord of lords
[1:04:08] but they wanted the leadership of the
[1:04:11] King legged like was over the other
[1:04:13] nations and natural king not a spiritual
[1:04:16] King now the one that samuel was
[1:04:19] representing not the one that Sammy was
[1:04:21] taking a stand for a million but he
[1:04:23] wanted a political king a man whether we
[1:04:27] want a spiritual king and not a
[1:04:29] political one by the grace of Almighty
[1:04:32] God and you a new one and you want a
[1:04:34] spiritual ministry and not a not a
[1:04:36] religious ministry a man it's got to be
[1:04:39] the leadership of the Holy Ghost and
[1:04:41] what they're refusing was Samuel but
[1:04:44] they're refusing the leadership of the
[1:04:46] holy ghost in Samuel they're refusing
[1:04:48] the leadership of God in Samuel amen and
[1:04:52] they refused to be led by the Lord amen
[1:04:56] to them they were rejecting Samuel but
[1:04:59] to God they were rejecting him amen
[1:05:03] because it was not Samuel it was God in
[1:05:05] Samuel and they tried to use this as an
[1:05:08] excuse concerning the sons of Samuel a
[1:05:11] man and there are many that will walk
[1:05:13] away from the word today and the message
[1:05:16] today because there are ministries in
[1:05:19] there that are out there that are not
[1:05:21] walking as the Prophet walk then they
[1:05:23] are not talking as the Prophet are they
[1:05:26] they are not living as the privately if
[1:05:28] they do not have the attitude or the
[1:05:30] motives of the objections with the
[1:05:32] spirit that the Prophet had a man that's
[1:05:35] right there they go there because they
[1:05:38] wanted this kind of a spirit or that
[1:05:40] kind of history they're looking maybe
[1:05:41] more for more somebody like our brother
[1:05:43] Oral Roberts and all due respect to
[1:05:45] brother Roberts looking for somebody
[1:05:47] more like maybe Billy Graham yelling and
[1:05:50] other evangelists that would do this and
[1:05:52] would do this and would do that amen
[1:05:55] but it didn't want because boy with the
[1:05:57] Prophet was moving away from that to the
[1:06:00] word amen
[1:06:01] because why because that was that's what
[1:06:03] he was ordained to do therefore when the
[1:06:06] angel made him in the cane and the angel
[1:06:09] said he should heed now it's easy buddy
[1:06:10] I have the three phases as it were in
[1:06:13] your ministry and he said you're going
[1:06:15] to have this
[1:06:16] saying he'd sit in your hand and again
[1:06:19] as I explained it was his left hand and
[1:06:21] he would take their or their left hands
[1:06:24] a man and it was and it was going as to
[1:06:26] where from heart to heart and he would
[1:06:29] just he would know what what sickness
[1:06:31] they had he would know what their
[1:06:33] problem was a man he was deserted and
[1:06:35] speak the name of the Lord for their
[1:06:38] healing and then he said then he should
[1:06:40] after that he says you're going to have
[1:06:42] the discernment to know their thoughts
[1:06:45] and the intents of their heart not just
[1:06:48] the present tense led like reading
[1:06:49] somebody's mind but he said the past the
[1:06:52] present and the future
[1:06:53] amen and it was only a matter of a few
[1:06:56] months that he that he was using the
[1:06:59] first sign and he was he was telling
[1:07:02] them what was wrong with him and
[1:07:03] preachers would come up and they would
[1:07:05] stand there and they would look at his
[1:07:07] aim yeah they would stand there look at
[1:07:10] his hand and they were amazed because
[1:07:13] when they took the hand of that sick
[1:07:14] person then all of a sudden things begin
[1:07:17] to happen in in in the prophets and and
[1:07:19] just begin the movement that begin to
[1:07:21] move and the Prophet Rose looked at it
[1:07:24] and he said oh he said this is your
[1:07:25] problem amen and he said and they when
[1:07:29] they would agree and they oh yeah they
[1:07:31] said I said that you're right make sure
[1:07:33] with us say the Lord he should you're
[1:07:35] healed
[1:07:35] maybe you were praying or even just
[1:07:37] speak the word amen and then a Zain
[1:07:40] would go back to normal but then he said
[1:07:43] within within I think it might have been
[1:07:45] four months that a when he was using
[1:07:47] this sign and it happened in Canada I
[1:07:50] believe it was in the first time in this
[1:07:52] came to pass in Canada and he was he was
[1:07:55] doing that and all of a sudden he said
[1:07:58] he when he was in the prayer line using
[1:07:59] that first sign and he said then he said
[1:08:02] oh he looked and he saw vision and when
[1:08:06] this person stood before him a man any
[1:08:09] and he saw the past the present and the
[1:08:11] future
[1:08:12] oh that person that he that was there
[1:08:14] and he said always said this happened to
[1:08:16] you and this is what your problem is now
[1:08:19] and he would look to the future he said
[1:08:21] but the saved the Lord you're healed a
[1:08:23] man he said go your way and praise the
[1:08:26] Lord Amen and of course he would usually
[1:08:29] ask now
[1:08:30] is that right and he would tell them
[1:08:32] they're nice and now he's your name is
[1:08:33] this your name is that and you're you
[1:08:35] and you live in this certain city and
[1:08:38] then you come from here you come from
[1:08:40] there yes that's right sir you're right
[1:08:42] amen and he said this is your problem
[1:08:45] and so on so he discerned that within a
[1:08:47] matter of four months but it took a
[1:08:50] number of years he went on with those
[1:08:51] signs those first two gifts and those
[1:08:55] search through signs II when I'm with
[1:08:56] him for about seven years
[1:08:58] a man seven years and in 1953 seven
[1:09:04] years after he was commissioned to do it
[1:09:06] he said he said knowledge so we've had
[1:09:09] seven years he said of signs and wonders
[1:09:12] we've had seven years of divine healing
[1:09:15] and he and he says the memorial to
[1:09:17] divine healing amen and what was what
[1:09:21] was going on
[1:09:22] God was beginning the change is ministry
[1:09:24] a man from the first sign to the stand a
[1:09:27] second sign and he was beginning to move
[1:09:29] in the into the third which was the
[1:09:31] opening of the word and it was after 19
[1:09:34] and 53 that brother Brennan because my
[1:09:37] brother round began to get more and more
[1:09:39] and more into the word and little by
[1:09:41] little by little at this revelation that
[1:09:43] revelation other revelation under they
[1:09:46] got into the church changers he got into
[1:09:48] the end of the series of Daniel a man
[1:09:50] and Israel and so on in 1980 19 and 60
[1:09:54] and but still God was moving him on more
[1:09:57] and more and more into the word under

[1:13:21] brothers to get us back home we need to
[1:13:23] get back home this is not do it this is
[1:13:26] not the home that we came from a million
[1:13:28] because why ain't million brothers
[1:13:30] sister God created the heaven and the
[1:13:32] earth but he said I'm going to have a
[1:13:33] new heaven and a new earth and the
[1:13:35] father God said exactly and he said he
[1:13:38] said we were born in sin shaped in
[1:13:40] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:13:42] and we needed to be born again amen and
[1:13:46] that's what the Jews did not recognize
[1:13:48] in the Messiah to the end of Messiah was
[1:13:51] the curb and to deliver them from the
[1:13:53] power the political power of the Romans
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:57] so that Israel is going to be a nation
[1:13:58] like it was in the Old Testament hey man
[1:14:01] when a quitter came out of Egypt and we
[1:14:04] didn't and eventually went into the
[1:14:05] Promised Land
[1:14:06] this was the nation of Israel amen and
[1:14:09] all the other nations subject to it hey
[1:14:11] man they they thought well and they lost
[1:14:14] it and they figured that the Messiah is
[1:14:16] going to come and restore the natural
[1:14:18] political nation of Israel but the
[1:14:21] Messiah first brother had to come and
[1:14:23] redeem them he to pay the price for
[1:14:26] their Redemption
[1:14:27] amen and the salvation of their souls
[1:14:30] anybody so they make them new creatures
[1:14:33] then he wasn't even restore to them the
[1:14:35] kingdom then they then they didn't have
[1:14:37] not just a Jerusalem that ever New
[1:14:39] Jerusalem praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:42] hallelujah because the Bible speaks in
[1:14:44] revelation of the New Jerusalem praise
[1:14:47] the Lord and they they were they were
[1:14:49] satisfied with the old Jerusalem but
[1:14:52] brother God wanted to get him there born
[1:14:53] to gain and into a New Jerusalem hey you
[1:14:56] know hallelujah and there would be no
[1:14:58] sin there be no politics he-man and
[1:15:02] and the atmosphere be governed by divine
[1:15:05] law amen
[1:15:07] sir brother and the Bible tells us that
[1:15:09] God went from the Jews to the Gentiles
[1:15:12] hallelujah it's there in the book of
[1:15:14] Acts where Paul said he did it according
[1:15:16] to the Word of God and he said now so
[1:15:19] I'm going to go from the Jews and he son
[1:15:21] taking this to the Gentiles
[1:15:23] amen any any other correct I believe it
[1:15:26] was might have been Peter there because
[1:15:28] there were Gentiles that that God has
[1:15:31] sent Peter to and they believe that the
[1:15:35] preaching of the Messiah has the word to
[1:15:38] them and they went got baptized and
[1:15:41] Peter was going to get him circumcised
[1:15:43] and applause in no way he said he said
[1:15:47] they are already circumcised they but
[1:15:50] Peter thought they should be circumcised
[1:15:51] naturally but God had circumcised him
[1:15:54] spiritually amen brother sister they got
[1:15:58] there naturally and physically and
[1:16:00] humanly they got religion but God wants
[1:16:02] us to have have it spiritually was the
[1:16:05] Holy Ghost
[1:16:05] hey man it may not not the notic read
[1:16:08] not the dead of the word but the spirit
[1:16:11] of the word amen this is what God wants
[1:16:14] in you and in me he brings us out of
[1:16:17] that so we're not into religion we're
[1:16:19] not into the word naturally without into
[1:16:21] the word intellectually that we have
[1:16:23] come into the spiritual revelation of
[1:16:25] the word and we are seeing God and we
[1:16:28] are seeing the plan of God and the
[1:16:29] purpose of God and the pattern of God
[1:16:31] amen brother never seen the end of God's
[1:16:36] plan and purpose and pattern we're
[1:16:38] seeing the end of God dealing with the
[1:16:40] Gentiles are going back to the Jews amen
[1:16:43] I think I got getting right Waseda and
[1:16:46] recognizing that God wants us to come
[1:16:48] back under his leadership now the
[1:16:51] leadership of a church not the
[1:16:52] leadership of man but the leadership of
[1:16:54] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:16:56] and again as the leadership of the Holy
[1:16:58] Ghost in in our Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:17:01] leadership of our Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:17:03] his ministry because he said he ascended
[1:17:07] up on I and in Shawn but he said any and
[1:17:10] he said the age that he s set in the
[1:17:12] church the five full ministry

[1:17:18] of Almighty God a man and show you a man
[1:17:22] to be led by a by the by the Holy Ghost
[1:17:24] you are led by the Ministry but again
[1:17:26] now you got to pray over that and be led
[1:17:28] by the Spirit to make sure you're under
[1:17:30] you're under a ministry that's led by
[1:17:32] the Holy Ghost amen because there are
[1:17:35] millions and millions and millions are
[1:17:37] there that are under ministries brother
[1:17:39] but they're they're not led by the Holy
[1:17:41] Ghost are led by religion - led by
[1:17:43] denomination and denominational spirits

[1:17:46] but we want to be led by the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] and brother are we going to judge your
[1:17:51] judgment right or wrong by the Word of
[1:17:53] God what is the Word of God what is the
[1:17:56] will of God for this day for this hour
[1:17:59] so we're not living we're not living in
[1:18:01] what God did yesterday we're living in
[1:18:03] what God is doing the day anybody we're
[1:18:06] not living according to what God did
[1:18:07] yesterday we're living according to what
[1:18:09] God is doing now and we're moving on to
[1:18:12] my god wants to do tomorrow
[1:18:14] hey man by the grace of Almighty God
[1:18:17] brothers sister that's why there's going
[1:18:19] to be so few that are going into the end
[1:18:22] of that resurrection and into that
[1:18:23] rapture and I decoded area they had this
[1:18:27] message on leadership somewhere and
[1:18:29] where he mention it
[1:18:31] amen excuse me because the father got
[1:18:37] highlight of the fact of any and what
[1:18:40] did he do he mentioned about the number
[1:18:42] of those that would go into that wake of
[1:18:44] the Living saints that would go in the
[1:18:46] rapture and it's not very many I'm not
[1:18:49] sure if it said 200 or 500 now you
[1:18:51] consider what that is around the world
[1:18:53] considering maybe one seven six or seven
[1:18:57] billion population
[1:18:59] and there's so many a thousands and
[1:19:02] thousands and thousands out so in
[1:19:04] million Christians so you consider how
[1:19:07] many it's going to go in a rapture 200
[1:19:10] how many is that for every country if it
[1:19:13] is 500 how many is that for every
[1:19:15] country it may that's not very many and
[1:19:19] it is 500 many is that for all the
[1:19:22] churches around the world everything is
[1:19:25] that for all the message churches around
[1:19:27] the world
[1:19:28] but again ladies Reno brothers going to

[1:20:29] man it is the word whether it's in the
[1:20:33] Old Testament whether it's in the New
[1:20:34] Testament it is it is God giving his
[1:20:37] word like a to eat where did Eve get the
[1:20:39] Word of God Eve got it from Adam because
[1:20:42] God told Adam and I know that I don't
[1:20:45] totally and then and then I know doctors
[1:20:47] were asked were able God okay and came
[1:20:50] to it the brother/sister he knoweth
[1:20:53] anybody because even outside the garden
[1:20:56] they offered their sacrifices and eeny
[1:20:59] Meeny and he knew the like hey hey that
[1:21:01] was offering and and he got into an
[1:21:03] argument with Abel and he kill evil just
[1:21:06] think of that and then God come down and
[1:21:09] talk to him God come down and talk to
[1:21:11] him and still he refused God brothers
[1:21:15] the same thing in this day an hour and
[1:21:17] down through the church ages brother

[1:21:22] that killed her they killed their the
[1:21:24] previous generation and then what they
[1:21:27] wanted and how they wanted it and so on
[1:21:29] and what they stood for and how they
[1:21:30] stood for it amen
[1:21:32] they were speaking out against
[1:21:33] denominationalism and church the church
[1:21:37] Hannity and so on

[1:21:46] they were they were worshippers they
[1:21:48] worship oh yeah they worship and I've
[1:21:52] gone through this years ago years ago
[1:21:54] how that you can trace churches you can
[1:21:57] trace your trail you know all
[1:21:58] denominations back to Rome you know or
[1:22:00] this one goes to that church that church
[1:22:02] that church then to the Roman Church and
[1:22:05] then you can trace it all down through
[1:22:06] history and you can go run out far come
[1:22:09] back can you trace it when it comes to
[1:22:11] the denominations and organized religion
[1:22:14] you can trace it right back to change
[1:22:16] leanings amen
[1:22:19] because after Cain left off talking with

[1:22:44] to trace organized religion back your
[1:22:46] trailer right back to Cain amen
[1:22:48] if you want to trace the Holy Ghost
[1:22:50] religion back you're going to trace it
[1:22:52] back to Abel a man brother because his
[1:22:56] faith was in the blood was it was in the
[1:22:58] blood sacrifice on our front and our
[1:23:00] faith is in the blood sacrifice a man
[1:23:03] paid on we know they can able fate was
[1:23:06] in the land that he slowed and the blood
[1:23:08] that was shed but our faith is in the
[1:23:10] Lamb of God that was slain before the
[1:23:12] foundation of the world
[1:23:14] amen amen amen praise the name of the
[1:23:18] Lord not just two thousand years ago
[1:23:20] that was when it was all made fresh but
[1:23:23] it was in the mind of God before Adam
[1:23:26] before they knew every before they
[1:23:28] either rather than having in the earth
[1:23:30] that God created it was in the mind of
[1:23:32] God hallelujah that is not saying the
[1:23:36] Lord and brother brothers see how
[1:23:38] important it is to be led by the Spirit

[1:23:50] word a man yeah

[1:23:54] see an age but then we're gonna trace it
[1:23:56] right on back to the Ephesians and we'll
[1:23:59] go right on back beyond the Ephesian age
[1:24:01] we'll go right on back to in the
[1:24:03] beginning God created the heaven in the
[1:24:05] Europe not even to Eternity amen and
[1:24:08] when we will comprehend the plan of God
[1:24:11] the purpose of God and the parent of God
[1:24:13] and to know that it wasn't just after
[1:24:16] this half that God decided this then God
[1:24:18] decided that then God was going to do
[1:24:20] this then no it was all finished in the
[1:24:23] mind of God anybody thought ago that it
[1:24:27] was all past tense in the mind of God is
[1:24:30] not that I will be saved I am saved is
[1:24:34] not I will be changed I am a man but we
[1:24:39] but but what it is is by faith we're
[1:24:41] moving into what the past tense that God
[1:24:43] sees praise the Oh glory
[1:24:47] no wonder that says that the cast our
[1:24:50] sins into the sea of this forgetfulness
[1:24:53] oh brother not 2000 years ago before the
[1:24:57] foundation of the world because the lamb
[1:24:59] was slain in the mind of God before the
[1:25:01] foundation of the world hallelujah

[1:28:02] amen yeah and when we're witnessing
[1:28:05] being we will see it's not what God has
[1:28:08] done is what he's done he's doing a man
[1:28:12] see the thing of it is all other
[1:28:14] generations all day
[1:28:15] all they were living on was what God had
[1:28:17] done what God had done Shree Luther what
[1:28:19] God had done Sir John Wesley what God
[1:28:22] had done Sir William Booth what God had
[1:28:24] done through the per day the
[1:28:25] Pentecostals a hundred years ago but the
[1:28:27] bride is entering into what God is doing
[1:28:32] hey man it is the finish of the mystery
[1:28:36] of God where we've entered the
[1:28:38] revelation that is finished and God know
[1:28:40] anybody and God is bringing it to pass
[1:28:43] God and God is bringing it to a finish
[1:28:45] he finished it
[1:28:46] and what's what's involved in the finish
[1:28:49] the finish brother is the resurrection
[1:28:52] the rapture the Farish he made his give
[1:28:56] is to give us the faith that's gonna
[1:28:58] take us back there's one thing to come
[1:29:01] there's another thing to go back brother
[1:29:04] he like I said he'd give Luther that
[1:29:06] faith and for four generations and he'd
[1:29:10] give Wesley that faith and he give the
[1:29:11] Pentecostals that faith I know and and
[1:29:13] there are other churches came up and
[1:29:15] moved on with it because there was the
[1:29:18] Pentecostal church and three and a half
[1:29:20] years after the Pentecostal church what
[1:29:22] what it what happened there was a split
[1:29:24] and and the United Pentecostal church
[1:29:27] started why because they wanted to go on
[1:29:30] with their are their ideas of the
[1:29:32] Trinity they wanted to go on with their
[1:29:34] ideas of Rome baptism in the name of the
[1:29:37] Lord Jesus Christ but they never had the
[1:29:39] complete revelation of it amen well they
[1:29:42] they and sometimes some of their
[1:29:44] thoughts were right but not all of it
[1:29:46] amen because they are hadn't come yet
[1:29:49] for the minister for the end time
[1:29:50] prophet in the days of the voice of the
[1:29:53] seventh angel
[1:29:54] amen and remember that angel that
[1:29:56] descended to give him the mystery was
[1:29:59] Christ
[1:30:00] remember that mighty angel came down
[1:30:02] with the cloud or with the rainbow over
[1:30:04] his head and that that brother that
[1:30:07] wasn't William Branham that was Jesus
[1:30:08] Christ amen
[1:30:11] because the rainbow represent of the
[1:30:12] covenant Amen praise the name of the
[1:30:15] Lord hallelujah with the rainbow over
[1:30:17] his head and knowing that as it was in
[1:30:19] the days of Noah cuz they had a rainbow
[1:30:22] - that's right by the grace of God
[1:30:27] and God said this is a sign to you well
[1:30:30] brother was assigned to us everybody
[1:30:33] that he was here that he had come down
[1:30:36] he that made the promise was here to
[1:30:38] make to break the word to pass
[1:30:40] concerning the endtime concerning the
[1:30:43] resurrection concerning the rapture
[1:30:44] brother it's in the Word of God when it
[1:30:48] when wind and wind will that generation
[1:30:50] rise who believes in the resurrection of
[1:30:52] rapture when with that generation rise
[1:30:55] they were who's gonna fulfill the
[1:30:59] scriptures oh my I show you a mystery

[1:31:19] pass where is that generation you know
[1:31:23] God is gonna vote fulfill that mystery
[1:31:25] we shall not all sleep but we shall all
[1:31:28] be changed see again I will get into
[1:31:32] that some other time where were the
[1:31:33] Prophet is saying that the living Saints
[1:31:37] are going to go into that dimension and
[1:31:38] meet the living that the dead in Christ
[1:31:40] in theirs theophany bodies and we're
[1:31:43] going all going to be changed into
[1:31:45] glorified bodies anybody not in this
[1:31:48] dimension in that dimension there will
[1:31:50] be change and avoid five bodies and then
[1:31:53] after a while we look up and there's
[1:31:54] Jesus coming down in the in his
[1:31:56] glorified body that's right
[1:31:59] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:32:01] brother sister we've come to that our
[1:32:03] trauma and world where where where is
[1:32:05] that generation who is believing that
[1:32:07] where is that generation who is
[1:32:09] preaching that where's that remember
[1:32:11] generation who is living for it morning
[1:32:13] noon and night that's all you're living
[1:32:17] for but brother where were that were
[1:32:19] ministering to a generation around the
[1:32:21] world professing this word and profess
[1:32:24] to believe this message but they're
[1:32:26] really living for themselves they're
[1:32:27] living for this world they want this
[1:32:29] they want this they want that and and
[1:32:32] they're getting more attention to the to
[1:32:34] the natural things to their to the
[1:32:35] spiritual but I tell you you know Noah
[1:32:38] was given more attention to the spear
[1:32:40] the natural yeah the RET spiritual
[1:32:45] revelation that he yet that's what he
[1:32:47] was living for just think well he well I
[1:32:49] took him 120 years to go there yeah but
[1:32:51] he didn't he didn't you're thinking but
[1:32:53] he didn't have the tools they have here
[1:32:55] today can you imagine how he build that
[1:32:58] art can you imagine how he did this an
[1:33:01] area today a man brother to say the same
[1:33:05] way with with our brother Enoch a man he
[1:33:10] was with God and was not but he walkin
[1:33:13] in the revelation of the word and the
[1:33:15] spiritual was more important to him than
[1:33:17] the natural oh no brother praise the
[1:33:23] name of the Lord
[1:33:24] and and then remember that was that was
[1:33:26] a seven for the Bible mentions it the
[1:33:29] seven from the first half of the seventh
[1:33:30] from the second Adam
[1:33:32] Amen even our Lord Jesus Christ praise
[1:33:37] the Lord he was the second Adam
[1:33:38] the prophet of God I lighted it now he
[1:33:41] said he went to rapture
[1:33:43] now we're gonna be raptured cuz with us
[1:33:45] have in the seventh age from the second
[1:33:47] item our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:50] brother I'll tell you this loser got
[1:33:53] more interested in their spiritual
[1:33:56] revelation than he did in natural things
[1:33:58] of life amen before the revelation the
[1:34:01] faith struck him he was caught up with
[1:34:04] the natural things of life because he
[1:34:06] felt he would he would be justified if
[1:34:08] he did just did just did this know God
[1:34:10] wants you to believe God wants should I
[1:34:14] believe it's worth God why should I
[1:34:15] believe what he has done hey man that's
[1:34:20] it brother not what is not did you you
[1:34:22] did you did this you did that no no
[1:34:25] brother God wants you to want you to do
[1:34:28] it wants you to believe what he has done
[1:34:29] the finished work it's finished before
[1:34:33] the foundation of the world but now it's
[1:34:35] most definitely finished because the
[1:34:38] Lamb that was slain before the
[1:34:39] foundation of the world came in flesh
[1:34:40] and he was slain and he went back and he
[1:34:44] said oh they're just where you come from
[1:34:47] that's Ryan as where he was butter what
[1:34:50] a mystery what a revelation
[1:34:52] god help us to believe that we
[1:34:54] are there in that dimension a man jesus
[1:35:00] said no man has ascended up only he that
[1:35:02] came down even the son of man knew
[1:35:04] now who is now in heaven now what is
[1:35:11] hard the Lord you your ear your flesh
[1:35:17] and you're up there he he was up there
[1:35:20] why because he came he came any to his
[1:35:25] to his theophany and he came from his
[1:35:27] theophany flesh but because of sin we
[1:35:30] fight past not the afternoon that's
[1:35:33] right but he came down supposed to pull
[1:35:37] us back into our theophanies he came
[1:35:39] down first to put us in contact with our
[1:35:41] theophany and then when we go on from
[1:35:44] time to time from at a time physically
[1:35:47] of this body was going to our theophany
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:51] we bypassed it because of sin and we
[1:35:54] needed jesus to come to put us in
[1:35:57] contact with our theophany so that when
[1:35:59] we died physically were right back there
[1:36:02] in in our theophany body but jesus came
[1:36:05] from eternity to his theophany at the
[1:36:08] opening into flesh and brother that was
[1:36:13] him he was among those three angels that
[1:36:16] came to talk to a brain amen praise the
[1:36:20] Lord
[1:36:21] he went from Fiat even from a theophany
[1:36:23] into that fleshy body and Abraham saw
[1:36:26] three men coming but they were three
[1:36:28] angels and he recognized one of them as
[1:36:30] Lord he bowed they recognized one as
[1:36:34] Lord and of course didn't there was the
[1:36:36] other two messengers that went down to
[1:36:37] life and we know that was that was
[1:36:40] William Branham the Lord glory was
[1:36:43] represented in written Brown his
[1:36:45] ministry a man but then there was all
[1:36:48] Roberts and there was Billy Graham they
[1:36:51] went down to Sodom and Gomorrah in where
[1:36:53] where lot was to preach repentance
[1:36:56] that's right one angel one angel was
[1:37:00] preaching repentance the other age or
[1:37:02] did a sign oh yeah like Oral Roberts the
[1:37:05] other sign yeah
[1:37:07] then there was the there was the other
[1:37:09] one they gave the promise of the word to
[1:37:13] Abram he said Abraham and hey I got a
[1:37:17] promised it years before years before he
[1:37:21] says Sarah's gonna have the son a man
[1:37:26] Abram recognized him as drawing Abram
[1:37:30] went out and got a sacrifice and brought
[1:37:32] in a sacrifice - yeah
[1:37:35] while those Angels win and listen praise
[1:37:40] the Lord thank God for grace amen
[1:37:43] I pray we're not gonna be left here when
[1:37:47] the fire falls it is falling but it's
[1:37:51] going to get worse
[1:38:00] I don't know you're aware of this but
[1:38:03] since January there was 250 people
[1:38:09] killed in churches and we know that even
[1:38:16] not long ago they went in attack even
[1:38:18] there a priest in the Catholic Church
[1:38:21] they've attacked others and then Moslems
[1:38:24] and so on 250 people have been killed if
[1:38:30] someone want to come through that door
[1:38:32] where a gun if they know what we believe
[1:38:37] and what we're preaching and what we're
[1:38:39] teaching it better be in prayer and we
[1:38:44] better be on that guy oh yes most
[1:38:49] definitely is you know it where it were
[1:38:54] heard about it constantly and this that
[1:38:58] this was since Ghent just since January
[1:38:59] this is 250 people and just not long ago
[1:39:03] Dewar's just a couple of days ago and
[1:39:05] Sri Lanka they attacked a church again
[1:39:10] and kill people
[1:39:18] are we taking it that serious
[1:39:23] I pray gracefully listen that that that
[1:39:25] I was going to come during the Great
[1:39:27] Tribulation
[1:39:27] because millions a number that no man
[1:39:30] could number said that came out of the
[1:39:32] Great Tribulation they laid down their
[1:39:34] lives for the gospel they're not Brian
[1:39:41] God has given the bride a higher
[1:39:43] revelation to give her the faith to take
[1:39:45] her higher and they take her out of time
[1:39:48] into eternity
[1:39:54] but I pray in the name of Jesus that you
[1:39:59] do recognize the seriousness of the hour
[1:40:00] that this is just not going to church
[1:40:05] this is laying down your life it's
[1:40:10] laying down your life many have laid
[1:40:13] down their lives over the years as I
[1:40:15] said sixty-eight Minden laid down their
[1:40:18] lives as martyrs for the Christian for
[1:40:21] Christ 68 in the oh yeah that was
[1:40:25] history

[1:40:28] living in an insane war we're living in
[1:40:32] a crazy world and brother even even
[1:40:34] though reporters or whatever they are
[1:40:38] out there in the world around the world

[1:40:42] not normal anymore because of what's
[1:40:47] happening because of what's going on
[1:40:49] they know it's insane people kill people
[1:40:54] for no reason from you know just just
[1:40:57] just to do it
[1:40:58] just cut they want to do brother sister
[1:41:02] see you know what I proved it proves the
[1:41:07] scripture that the devil has come down
[1:41:09] with great wrath knowing is time is
[1:41:13] short and this time is short how short
[1:41:16] is our you need to take serious I start
[1:41:22] living for Jesus yes die for him too

[1:41:38] increasing your faith and you're getting
[1:41:40] more and more and more rapturing faith
[1:41:43] resurrection paid by the grace of God
[1:41:45] more and more conscious of eternity see
[1:41:49] as you see with oh my praise the Lord
[1:41:51] Jesus was getting in his ministry he was
[1:41:54] getting more and more and more conscious
[1:41:56] of that other dimension
[1:41:58] that's what he said no man has ascended
[1:42:00] up when he that came down even new EU is
[1:42:03] in heaven the son of a hey man he was
[1:42:08] more conscious on he was getting closer
[1:42:10] to Eternity and that's what I said I am
[1:42:13] no more in the world
[1:42:16] he knew his faith to face it in the
[1:42:21] flesh we're getting more and more real
[1:42:23] with more more conscious of eternity and
[1:42:25] less conscious of time I pray God in the
[1:42:31] name of Jesus Lord take away time
[1:42:34] promise so that we're not governed by
[1:42:37] time we're not controlled by time we're
[1:42:40] not led by Terry we're led by the Holy
[1:42:42] Ghost were led by the revelation of the
[1:42:45] Word of God they may and it's God
[1:42:50] through his servants he's like a man
[1:42:53] told brother branham one time he said I
[1:42:54] don't need a teacher Oh father God so
[1:42:59] you don't why not he said the Holy Ghost

[1:43:22] grace of God brought a God Elvis that
[1:43:26] we're gonna be led by God and how
[1:43:29] desires to be led by God not my name
[1:43:31] and we read right here Samuel they were
[1:43:35] led by God through Samuel but then they
[1:43:38] got to the place where they wanted to be
[1:43:39] led by a man a human thing not a
[1:43:43] spiritual thing not the king of kings
[1:43:45] that samuel was testifying about now
[1:43:50] they were getting ahead of the Spirit
[1:43:52] and they were getting more and more into
[1:43:53] the flesh

[1:44:00] mystery there with me we shall not all

[1:46:04] thought they're all there in the
[1:46:05] cemetery
[1:46:06] yeah dust but that's the dust that's the

[1:46:55] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:46:56] with them in the clouds to meet the lord
[1:46:59] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[1:47:01] the Lord
[1:47:03] comfort one another with these words my

[1:47:17] God's leadership of the Prophet I gotta
[1:47:19] come under God's leadership of these
[1:47:20] five for ministry

[1:47:24] saints grace amen
[1:47:35] hey five scriptures and only got to
[1:47:37] really want
[1:47:43] after reading the scripture we read in
[1:47:46] Samuel concerning those that rejected
[1:47:50] the Samuel and rejected God brother
[1:47:55] Brown said I'd like to choose a text of
[1:47:59] the rejected King don't be found guilty
[1:48:07] of rejecting God Elvis he said it was a
[1:48:14] time that as in all times their people
[1:48:17] as never wanted God to lead them amen he
[1:48:24] said they never wanted God to lead them
[1:48:27] he said they want their own way of
[1:48:30] leadership no God's Way not why my will
[1:48:36] dinah be done and he said they won their
[1:48:41] own way of leadership and this story
[1:48:43] this morning when you go and he said it
[1:48:47] was during the time of the days of
[1:48:49] Samuel the man of God the prophet and he
[1:48:52] had been a just man and a good man
[1:48:55] honorable reputable true honest with his
[1:48:58] people and he said with the people he
[1:49:01] should never deceiving them
[1:49:03] he said telling them nothing but the
[1:49:05] straight thus saith the Lord amen
[1:49:10] just give him the word just kill him
[1:49:14] daughter Amy God's not interested in our
[1:49:18] ideas
[1:49:20] no no whatever God does he wants you to
[1:49:23] respond with the world yeah brother
[1:49:27] Brown says God longs to be reminded of
[1:49:30] his words I like that yeah God loved
[1:49:36] right because he shows shows your
[1:49:39] consciousness of the word and that
[1:49:41] nature and that you're sensitive to the
[1:49:43] word so he said God loves to be reminded
[1:49:47] of his room
[1:49:48] Nord it is written not we don't have
[1:49:52] just said to the devil
[1:49:54] Jesus had to say it to believers too it
[1:49:57] is written it is written thus saith the
[1:50:00] Lord amen brother
[1:50:03] so he said during the days of Sandia the
[1:50:06] man of God the prophet he had been a
[1:50:08] just man and he said telling them
[1:50:10] nothing but the straight thus saith the
[1:50:14] Lord but the people that come to a place
[1:50:17] he said where they wanted to change this
[1:50:20] program and it said they had looked upon
[1:50:22] the Philistines the Amalekites the
[1:50:25] amorite the Hittites and the other
[1:50:27] nations of the world and they had seen
[1:50:31] that they had Kings that rule them and
[1:50:34] govern them and guided them and fought
[1:50:38] their battles and this seemed to be that
[1:50:41] Israel wanted to pattern themselves like
[1:50:44] these kings like these people no we want
[1:50:48] a pattern in ourselves like the Lord
[1:50:50] like Jesus amen through his word so that
[1:50:55] we're going to be resurrected and
[1:50:56] raptured like Jesus he was resurrected
[1:51:00] he was raptured now he's come back to
[1:51:03] resurrect the rapture wonderful he said
[1:51:11] but it has never been in any age he said
[1:51:14] God's intention for his people to act
[1:51:18] like the people of the world never God's
[1:51:21] intention easier to be for his people to
[1:51:24] be governed or controlled like the
[1:51:27] people of the world God's people as
[1:51:30] always has been a peculiar people God's
[1:51:33] people has always been a different
[1:51:35] people now called out separated

[1:56:24] spirit and you'll fight it did you want
[1:56:26] you don't want it so god help my prayer
[1:56:33] he said their appetites for things and
[1:56:36] all their makeup is has always been men
[1:56:41] always contrary to the things that the
[1:56:43] people of the world desire amen and the
[1:56:48] people of Israel came to Samuel and said
[1:56:51] now you're getting old and your sons do
[1:56:54] not walk in your way and because they
[1:56:56] wasn't like true true like Samuel they
[1:56:59] were bribers and takers of money yeah
[1:57:01] and so on
[1:57:04] and Samuel tried to tell them and hold
[1:57:08] him in place but it would not work and
[1:57:10] he said if you do that and he said the
[1:57:14] first thing you know you'll find out he
[1:57:16] said he called you your sons from your
[1:57:18] home and they'll do this they'll make
[1:57:20] you soldiers chosen but God wasn't done
[1:57:23] do they know and he said yeah run run
[1:57:29] before a chariot you'll bear armors and
[1:57:31] spears no God fought for them he
[1:57:37] wouldn't he didn't expect them to fight
[1:57:39] for themselves no and he said besides
[1:57:42] all that he'd take a certain tax off yet
[1:57:45] so he said it's going to cost you God
[1:57:48] just asked for his tithes and offerings
[1:57:49] but it's you come under that natural
[1:57:52] king it's going to cost you a lot more
[1:57:57] but the people said we still want to be
[1:58:02] like the rest of the people and there's
[1:58:05] something about men and women that they
[1:58:07] longed to be like one another and there
[1:58:10] has only been one man ever lived on
[1:58:13] earth there was our example and that was
[1:58:16] the one that died for all our Lord and
[1:58:19] Savior Jesus Christ he was the perfect
[1:58:23] example of what we should be always
[1:58:26] about the father's business and doing
[1:58:30] that which is right
[1:58:32] God help us to be willing to be led by
[1:58:36] God by his word by his servants amen in
[1:58:41] the word
[1:58:43] that we will have the faith that pleases
[1:58:45] him and without without that leadership
[1:58:49] you will never have the faith that
[1:58:51] pleases God never so I pray the grace of
[1:58:58] God to control us thought word and deed
[1:59:03] so that we all know by by faith that
[1:59:07] were under God leadership why because it
[1:59:10] keeps bringing me back to the word it
[1:59:12] keeps reminding me of the word it keeps
[1:59:15] convicting me of the word 98 with the
[1:59:18] word amen
[1:59:19] it is evidence of the leadership of God
[1:59:22] amen
[1:59:23] so that it's the word the word the word
[1:59:25] that's all that's that's the main thing
[1:59:28] in your heart and soul is the revelation
[1:59:31] of the word amen
[1:59:44] see
[1:59:48] he said Jesus alone can lead you to
[1:59:52] eternal life amen
[1:59:56] but it's by His Word that's right he
[2:00:02] said could you imagine him leading you
[2:00:04] out of his word which that's him and if
[2:00:08] he is the word and you're a part of him
[2:00:10] won't you be part of the word he said
[2:00:14] you have a choice
[2:00:15] a young man whether you're going to have
[2:00:18] an education or not you have a choice of
[2:00:20] your conduct and he said are you women
[2:00:24] he so you can look a decent being or you
[2:00:27] can be one of these weird creatures that
[2:00:30] have out there with them blurred blue

[2:12:39] of God and the Word of God that you are
[2:12:42] recognizing the insanity of the world
[2:12:44] and that you are concerned about it and
[2:12:48] that you are hungry in person to get
[2:12:50] back to God to get out of this old
[2:12:54] heaven and earth and getting the glory
[2:12:57] with him and to come back to a new
[2:12:59] heaven and a new way and the Prophet
[2:13:03] said well what is the new evident worth
[2:13:04] he said well ISA what is the new
[2:13:07] creature in Christ Jesus

[2:16:40] things cuz he he walked he had the faith
[2:16:43] that face God he walked with God he was
