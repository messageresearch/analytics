incredible you know I tried it every now and then you sit back can think about it and you lose count and you think well I'm having a hard time I got this burden and I got that burden and this problem

again this evening Lord as we go into your word Lord may we just rest on a solid foundation of your scriptures Lord to know where we are to know who we are Lord to know what you're doing in our lives each one Lord bless us each one we pray Lord grant us Grace for this service now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Galatians chapter 4 Galatians chapter 4 amen want to welcome brother Bob back from his momentary sickness it's good to see him back he certainly bounced back faster than the rest of us I think so we thank the Lord for that good to have sister Selena back as well from BC and then suddenly the Mac coffees just sprouted so many young women and last service we had two and now we've got like 93 in the two front rows so God bless you each one it's good to have all of our visitors and then trust that you'll be blessed in your in your time with us each one amen God bless you Galatians chapter 4 says this now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ amen God bless you you can have your seats and I'm sure some of you are sitting there in some confusion and saying brother John you said we were done with adoption and you open up with an adoption scripture and the simple fact is we are done with the series on adoption but but there's so many things in Scripture that tie into it that you can't get away from these things so this will be much more of a teaching service tonight and probably Sunday if the Lord would will because I'm setting a foundation for a new series that we're starting tonight on the Holy Ghost and I want to call it the token life and I want a subtopic tonight of how the mighty have fallen and you'll see as we get into this you know we we we we started with this scripture in in Galatians because I want us to see we're in a process amen we don't as soon as we get the Holy Ghost that not it that's not doesn't mean we're done but as soon as we are born there's a process that starts if we're children of God and God is in a process of redeeming us back to himself redeeming us back to our original condition redeeming us back to our original position our original inheritance our original place under his leadership and so everything that we're going through is pointing us back to Redemption amen and we know that Redemption is only for those that are in the family bloodline you remember we preached on this I'm not going to preach it all over again tonight but the law of redemption says only someone that's related to you can redeem you and we know what happened in those times was everyone got got an inheritance that's a beautiful thing as a child of God to think tonight you have an inheritance I don't care who you are I don't care what your gender is if you're married if you're old you're young you have an inheritance that God has ordained for you before the foundation of the world now here's the thing we've lost it and in Israel's day maybe they had a drinking problem and they lost their land maybe they fell on Hard Times maybe the enemy came in and took it from them maybe they just H made some unwise decisions and they lost the Family Farm they lost the family inheritance but what could happen was somebody else who had stayed in the way that God had told them to stay that still had their the means and their inheritance with them they could take their money they could take what they had and they could go back and they could buy back what belonged to you and they could give it back to you but that took somebody that was certainly trusting of who you were and that that loved you and appreciated you but as soon as they gave it back to you you had the right to go in and kick off everybody that was on that land as soon as that title deed came back into your hand you had the right to go in and say this this land belongs to me now and they had to leave right then church I'm telling you this evening if you've been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ and you recognize it and you know where your inheritance lies you can go to anybody that comes on your property and say this belongs to me amen it belongs to me and if they choose to stay there you say and you have the right to say in the name of Jesus Christ you must leave this property because he's given it back to me and it belongs to me and I'm taking possession see they don't have to leave if we don't take possession but if we come in to take possession brother Braham says we've got the Holy Ghost as a sheriff to kick it off of our property and to give us back what he said belong to us amen the property comes back to us under Redemption and God said it belonged to them forever it could never go away and that's why he said don't remove the ancient landmarks the ancient Landmark showed where your property started where it ended and everything inside of that belong to you amen and so what happened in this last day they had all of these ancient landmarks when we look at the New Testament Church they had them in the original Church they had signs and wonders they had healings they had the gifts of the Spirit they had all of these things and now we've got people coming in and saying we don't need those now because we've got the word that's part and parcel of the word of God that's part and parcel of the inheritance of Jesus Christ to the bride to today amen it's all a part of ours whatever is in the word brother Bram says I can show you where he put it in you got to show me where he took it out amen every portion of it belongs to us this this evening but I want to take us to our original scripture this evening and I I don't mean to preach I'm hoping to teach tonight but we'll see where it goes amen but it says when God when the fullness of time was come literally this means when God decided it was time God has a time for everything and we can't rush it and we can't stop it we can't slow it down the goal for us is to catch it as he's doing it and that's what a true son and daughter of God does that's what an adopted son and daughter of do God does is they catch the timing of Jesus Christ they catch the timing of the word for their day and so when the time was come when God says it's time God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons so Paul saying here look we're in a fallen condition we're not how we used to be and we're not how we ought to be but we're in the this process that's bringing us back and that process is bringing us back to a place called adoption a place where we are true Sons and Daughters of God but for now we're in bondage we're in bondage to these natural bodies we're in bondage to these different things and we knew we didn't live perfect lives we knew we couldn't fulfill the law and so God came in Jesus Christ and he fulfilled the law to give by give living a sinless life amen so what's the benefit now that the law is fulfilled because remember the law had a hold on us excuse me sin had a right to us Satan had a right to us death had a right to us all these things had a right to us under the law because we transgress the law and the penalty for breaking the law is death it's always death and so Satan had a write all of these attributes of Satan and the Fallen condition had a right to us because the law was coming over us and it had a right to us but now Christ comes and he lives a sinless life and he fulfills the law and so what's left now whatever he decides and what does he offer he offers us Mercy he offers us Grace but what happens is when the law is fulfilled that means the price has been paid and now Redemption can proceed because until the price is paid Redemption can't move forward but once the price is paid now everything that has a claim against us has no rights anymore and so the bride is allowed to go the redeemed are allowed to go and they're allowed to take those chains off they're allowed to remove those things from the property that God's given them amen so now Satan doesn't have a claim on us as children of God you got Satan bugging you with something you got demons bothering you you've got sickness it has no right in the life and in the body of a child of God so you've got a right to push it back but this is where overcoming comes in because overcoming means there's a battle there's a battle and that means there's a time and there's an effort amen so now Satan has no right to access so if you've got Satan knocking on your door you've got Satan on your property there's only two reasons one you let him in or two you don't you refuse to kick him out cuz he has no right to be there he's a squad he's a squatter and so the bride of Christ has the authority of Jesus Christ to kick those things off amen but what did Calvary do because that's where that's where the law was fulfilled it was the price was paid at Calvary Christ lived a perfect life and that was him fulfilling the law but now Redemption requires a price and so he goes to Calvary and he pays a price amen and what is it that Calvary means to the believer now we're doing a bible study this morning it'll be 100% scriptures but I'm setting us up with a few things here brother Bram says this he says finally one day that's that day of Calvary he says there was one came down from Glory one by the name of Jesus Christ the son of God who came from glory glory and Calvary was formed that was the day that the price was paid and the sin question was settled forever amen that means that you don't have to wonder am I going or not going because of what I did you're going in because of what he did not because of what you did or didn't do amen it's his perfection that pays the price he says and it opened up the way into this thing that we're hungering and thirsting for it brought a place of satisfaction he says there's no man that's ever visited Calvary and seen it the way it is that can ever be the same everything that he ever desired or longed for is meant when he reaches that place he says it's a place of satisfaction it satisfies the hunger of your heart the hunger of your soul the very hunger of your body it's all men in Calvary if you're a true son or daughter of God but now what happens after the price is paid at Calvary it opens up a way for something what Paul said adoption full Redemption full restoration satisfaction there's something that goes on and he continues in Galatians 4 and he says now because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father God only sends the holy spirit for his children that's the only ones that can ever get the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean that you can't feel its its presence its atmosphere its power that doesn't mean it can't come on you but to go into your life you have to be a son or a daughter of God because it comes to the children of God that's the proof that you're a child of God as the Holy Ghost comes to you and it resides in you if you'll accept it he says now if that happens then wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ so Calvary opens up a way for for us to come back to our our original condition and the means of this or the mechanism for this is the spirit of God it's the Holy Spirit In Our Lives that's the power that's the Dynamics that's what makes all of this possible for us is when the Holy Spirit comes back to the believer and it puts a cry in our hearts amen if you've ever gotten the Holy Ghost you know it puts a cry in your heart to take you out of where you are and put you into what God says you're supposed to be and do in a place you're supposed to rest amen that's why he said you can never truly come to Cal and walk away the same is because if you truly come to Calvary then his Spirit goes from that blood and it comes in and it rests on us amen and then what happens when we realize who we are then it puts that cry and we say father father and we start going to him and saying I'm looking for you to do what you do to Sons I'm looking for you to do what you do to daughters I'm looking for you to change me I'm looking for you to grow me to mature me to to to change me into the image of Christ that we're supposed to be and it starts us on a journey of redemption it's a journey young people it's a journey do not think you have to be perfect from the day you get the Holy Ghost the Perfection is always in Christ it is not in you it is not in me getting the Holy Ghost doesn't mean you are perfect in and of yourself that you'll never make a mistake it has nothing to do with it the Perfection is under the blood of Christ don't ever get it in your head otherwise you turn into a performance-minded Christian and you'll fall and you'll fall and you'll fall and you'll never get up because you're you're beating yourself up up all the time but I want us to look this evening about how did we fall so far so fast because we look at the original and we see that they were Sons and Daughters of God Adam and Eve were a son and a daughter of God and they were in a a perfect place and yet we look at where we are today and I'll tell you one thing we're not in a perfect place by no means are we there so what brought us and that's why we're talking about how the mighty have fallen this evening and I want to talk about the original sin and walk us through these scriptures and and it'll be scriptures from here on out we we preach out of the Bible Church if I can't preach it out of here then I can't preach it from anywhere this is the only source of our inspiration we have a prophet that came and he showed us and he brought us back to the original truth of that scripture but he preached out of this and so I've got to preach out of this the same way so when we come to this original sin we see there's a great deal of confusion and I hope brother Kingsley doesn't mind me mentioning this but we are doing Bible studies with them you know we started a couple years ago and I asked him about what do you think the original sin was and he he just looked at me for a bit and he says you know I really don't know he says I've Heard lots of things but none of it's ever made sense but it's the original sin that caused us to fall and we're talking about the Holy Ghost in this series and the question is why do we need the Holy Ghost why is it the Holy Ghost why is it the Holy Spirit why do we need a new birth what's wrong with our birth that we have why did Eve get to mess it all up for all of us why didn't she just fall by her own decision and I get to be born and and live by my decisions what is it that's caused us to be in this Fallen condition amen now obviously you if you talk to most people in the denominations they'll say well Eve ate a fruit of some sort and then she gave that fruit to Adam and so it was a literal fruit and that's and that was what God told them not to do and so it was sin and so that caused the downfall and and we are where we are today but that's not the case and we ought to know this but I know our young people haven't maybe heard this and this is really the foundation for why we need a new birth why we need the holy ghost in the first place so if we we look in Genesis chap 2 it says this and the Lord planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground out of the ground the Lord God made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now somebody would say aha brother John you see he says right there it's a literal tree it's literal fruit it's growing out of the ground but I want you to reread that again because that's not what it says you got to pay close attention to the way that those words are put together because it says and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree every tree that is Pleasant for the sight and good for food and then he puts a semico in there that's a pause that's a break because he says every tree came out of that ground that was good to look at so everything that's beautiful has beautiful flowers and then everything that's good for food so everything you would ever want to eat and that you would want to look at from a plant from a tree all of that was out of the ground and God made it to grow and then he puts a separation here he puts that semicolon there it's a separation of thought it's a separation of species it's a separation of type and then he says and the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so there are trees with with flowers and fruits and these different things all beautiful made for f food made for us to enjoy but but then there's two other trees that are completely separate for those and they're in the midst of the garden it says in the midst of the garden we'll see we want to take note of where they're located in the middle of the garden so I want to ask this evening what are those two trees what are those two trees he says there's a tree of life and he says there's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and I and we'll we'll look at that just a moment here as we go through this tonight because we see that after the fall God does something with only one of those trees it says and the Lord God said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to tell the ground from once he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubs and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so God only guarded one of those trees so what happened to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil because if trees do what trees do then trees reproduce themselves don't they so we see that he guarded the tree of life but nowhere does it say he guarded the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so if life continued after that and it did because we have all the other trees today where is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil because if there was one back then then there ought to be hundreds and thousands and millions of them today if they continue to grow because God never protected them God never moved them away God never destroyed them God didn't do anything he left the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil completely untouched so where is it today where can we go and have a bite of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we ought to be able to do it if it was a literal tree but we can't why because they weren't literal trees they are representations of something else if we go to Revelation 2:7 we're going from the beginning to the end here now we're going all the way through it says he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God so now we come to the Ephesian Church age the very first church age this is the one where Paul and the apostles would have been and the promise to the Overcomer is that they get to eat of the Tree of Life how many people do we know that God picked up in that age and transported to Eden past the cherubs and gave them to eat of that tree of life and they never died because that's what Adam and Eve were doing if we believe it it was all literal fruit Adam and Eve were going every day and they were taking a bite of the fruit of eternal life and that would give them life for that day and they would go day by day by day eating this fruit off the tree so who in the Ephesian Church age got to do that no one nobody's been living since the Ephesian Church age but he says that's their promise that's the reward for the Overcomer their age is over where are they they're all everyone buried and dead in the ground waiting for a resurrection they're in another place don't get me wrong but they do not have eternal life in the sense of that they've they've lived for thousands of years but it says in Revelations 2 that they got to eat of the tree of eternal life so what is it they've already received their reward they've got it but nobody got to eat anything from a tree let's go back to Genesis 2 it says and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat every tree every tree of the garden that he's talking about that grew out of the ground amen there's a distinction be being given here and it's between the literal trees and then these other two trees the tree of knowledge and the tree of life he says but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die this other tree of knowledge it's not allowed to be eaten at all but he says you can eat of every tree of the garden that came out of the ground but this is a different type of tree it's not a part of the garden at all it's not planted it's something completely different so we have to be really careful here because God's saying you can't eat of the fruit of that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and we think that's a literal fruit but if we look to what the scripture says about eating fruit then we'll start to understand what this means and we have to see what the result of the eating of this fruit is to know what that fruit was because we ought to see that the effect match is the action whatever the effect is will tell you what the action was of eating this fruit you can know what's what something is see some this is so often what happens in things like medicine is they can't see the problem but they can see the effect of the problem and so they know what happens right they don't know that you have a cold but they can see if you've got your sinuses all clogged up or or if you got uh your tonsil swollen they can see the effect of the virus that they can't see so we look in the scriptures the same way and we say what was the eating of the fruit well if we look at the effect of eating the fruit we'll know what the fruit eating really was and from there we can find out what the tree of life is and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen we've got to match the effect to the action and if they don't match up then something's wrong it's like brother Bram said you know if if if it was eating an apple then we need to pass the apples because the Apple that they ate brought them a realization that they were naked and now everybody's running around naked so let's just pass the apples and maybe they'll go back to putting some clothes on Amen listen to what Jesus said in Matthew 15 Jesus said are ye yet also without understanding do you not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the drought but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false Witnesses and blasphemies the inner man is the problem not what you put in and what you put out the the eating of food does not separate us from from God that's not what puts us out and it never has been under the law they had rules for their diet but up to here they don't have any dietary laws whatever they want to eat they can eat amen so we need to know what this was and if we don't understand what happened here then we don't understand why we need a new birth why does why does the scripture even say that we're born again why does it talk about birth why why can't we just say it's a new page it's a rejuvenation it's a new beginning it's a new chapter why can't we just call it a cleansing or a cleaning why does it say we have to have a new birth why do we have to become a new creation a new creature why can't he just fix what this is It's All Tied together let's start where we're at now and then we'll build up from there David said this in Psalms 51 he says behold I was shapen that means I was produced I was brought into existence in iniquity what's iniquity doing what you know you ought not to do and he says and in sin did my mother conceive me now was David born out of wedlock no were his parents married yes was his mother a divorced and remarried woman no there is nothing wrong with David's mother in terms of her marriage in terms of her marital vows nothing like that and yet David says I was brought into existence doing something that was wrong and he says and in sin the sin was in my conception the sin was in the the initial start of this the action that brought him into existence amen Paul would come and say in Romans he says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God now when the scripture uses superlatives like that it means it every single one of us has sinned and come short of the glory of God just by being born we are in sin but the question is why why babies are innocent aren't they they are innocent in in that they haven't made a decision for or against God but they are born in sin they are born sinful in their nature why there's something inherit inherent about our birth that makes us unacceptable before God and the question is what is it if we want to see how we're supposed to be born then we need to go to how the first person was born and then we can see the correct pattern the original pattern and then we can see how we fell out of that way so we see it on the sixth day when God created man it says so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him so at that moment Adam is in God's image he's just like God and all the attributes of Adam are in him right there in his Spirit form the masculine the feminine side because remember a wife's going to be taken a woman's going to be taken taken out of him but in that original form every attribute that Adam has is going to be in there now that's key to understand as we move through this series the full attributes of Adam and his wife were in Adam as a spirit man from the start that's how we're supposed to come into existence it's just God producing another image of himself it's God producing another portion of himself it's God producing an attribute of himself and then what happened was Adam was supposed to continue on and on and on Amen but what is God doing here he's reproducing himself that's what Sons and Daughters of God are amen Gods produce Gods amen it says now he says so so in the image of God created he him semicolon break then he says male and female created he them this is a separation between the the original Adam and the future when God is going to now separate Adam out into two portions and he's going to give a male body in a male version and a female body with a female spirit all taken outside of Adam it'll be two separate bodies it says and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and God saw that everything that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day so God creates Adam in Genesis 1:27 in his image which is Spirit form amen and this is God's finished work that's God's finished work that's our original condition is a portion just like him remember what what what what it said in John it says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth so Adam is originally in spirit form he's a spirit but he has attributes he has a personality he has all of the elements of a person but he does not have a physical body in which to express those yet church we ought to be able to see ourselves in that story right there because remember you'll if you see this you'll never Wonder again why you are the way you are why you can't be like everybody else why you think different why you praise different why you worship different why you believe different is because you come from a different source and Adam has all of these things every attribute of Adam and his wife was in existence right there in that Spirit form and God finished his creation and rested the very next day this is it it's done but then what happened because remember the word has a purpose and God has created all of these things and the intention is that man is going to interact with God's creation it's all part and parcel and so the word of God the purpose of God comes into effect because remember God has his own body remember the logos went out from God at the very beginning in the beginning there was a there was a great light came out the scripture says that was the logos out of God that was a form that God could dwell in and so he looks at Adam and Adam's a spirit but he has no form so what does Adam have to do to be in the image of God he has to now come from a spirit into a form that can interact with his own creation and so God's got a body Adam needs a body and so in Genesis 2 it says this and thus the heavens and the Earth were finished and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all of his work which he had made jumping to verse 7 it says and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul so in Genesis 1:27 God creates Man In His Image in a spirit form but he's not tangible or or nor does he have a physical body and there is no man to till the ground the scripture says so God forms a physical body for that Spirit to dwell in Hallelujah God has the scripture says remember Jesus says a body hast thou prepared me and then I look around today and I see a body hast thou prepared me for me to dwell in to interact with my own creation so if we look at these two passages between Genesis 1:27 and Genesis 2 we see that God created the man Spirit first and then he placed the spirit of the man into a body of dust into a natural body into a fleshly body but notice God told Adam to to to to to reproduce himself to replenish the Earth as a spirit man he didn't tell him to do it when he came into his physical body he told him to do it when he was still in spirit form man was not told to reprod reproduce through physical intimacy through sex he was told to reproduced before he ever had a body amen now people would look at us today and they'd say well impossible obviously we were supposed to do it the way we do it because all the Plumbing's there all the parts are there no that was free moral AG geny and we'll see that God has a way of producing life and then he gives another option where you can inject yourself into it and you can produce life that way and that's really the choice that Adam and Eve had to make in the desert in in the garden amen the body was always meant to produce children and we'll see that because you see the woman's she's going to be her her pain is going to be multiplied there was always going to be a struggle for birth there's always going to be something that that happened with this body but the conception of a child was meant to be a a holy thing not a sensual thing amen if we look in the beginning remember the man and the woman were completely innocent in the garden the scripture says and we've got it right here it says they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed that means they weren't embarrassed now physically perfect specimens why would you ever be embarrassed we'd say but no they were not embarrassed because there was no understanding or knowledge that came with seeing somebody naked it meant nothing to them clothes no clothes it meant nothing to them they were completely innocent they they there was no need for to cover up they weren't self-conscious they weren't embarrassed by these things it wasn't built into them they had no understanding of why nakedness would ever be a problem and we see that because we see later on after they eat the fruit what do they do they become aware of their nakedness we know it's tied all together so if Adam and his wife have been true to the word of God every Son of God every offspring of God would have been born by the creative work just like Adam was that's the way it should have happened amen remember David said my mother conceived me in sin she did it the wrong way it's the only way that she could but it was still the wrong way so the sin is in the conceiving not in the birthing so look at this there's only one perfect birth Beyond Adam that we know of and we find it in Luke chapter 1 it says and the angel came in unto her to Mary and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what matter of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name Jesus Remember the sin is in the conception and he said he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give him the Throne of his father David he'll be the Son of God it says and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then Mary said unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man she's saying there's only one way I know how to produce a child and that's with a man and I haven't known a man I don't plan on knowing a man and yet you're telling me I'm going to get pregnant now catch this it says the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and so Christ was brought forth exactly the same way Adam was by the spoken word God says Let There Be and there was and so what happens now is the Holy Ghost overshadows Jesus Mary she doesn't have sex she doesn't have physical intimacy God creates a blood cell both an egg and sperm places it in a virgin takes her completely out of the equation Hallelujah takes her completely out she she has no DNA contribution to this baby it is perfect because it is a spoken word baby and it's the power of the Holy Ghost comes in here and it was a creative act it was not a sensual act it was a creation act Mary wouldn't have known she was pregnant or getting pregnant in that moment and the only way she knew was that her she started to change that's why brother Brandon would say that here we today we have the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation it is the it is the real New Birth where all you know is something has changed you may shout you may dance that ain't it you may shout you may dance you may just sit there and cry you may just get up and just have that complete weight lifted and you just know that you're a new creation you may feel everything and you may feel nothing it matters not what happens is are you impregnated with the word of God Amen that's what happened with Mary Mary had the word of God inside of her without sensation she didn't feel a thing but things started to change real quick and she knew amen so what happens now is that flesh forms around that blood cell it's a holy blood cell it's a Heavenly blood cell and now it produces a body that's called Jesus and now he's sinless flesh because there's nothing of our bloodline in him there's nothing of Mary in him it's God God God Amen there was no Act of s ual conception by Fallen Humanity with Jesus that's why he had to be born of a virgin so that she didn't have a part to play nor did any other man a man couldn't have a part why because the man and the woman are tainted there's a problem with the bloodline and the question is how is it tainted like I said before why is it that we have to suffer for Eve's decision and then Adam's decision on top of Eve's decision that's not fair it's not fair why do we have to get uh put into this horrible condition because Eve couldn't make the right decision why do we need to be born again why can't we just be born and make our own decision and God deal with us individually that way well we do get to make our own decision but this bloodline that we have this human bloodline is completely tainted and that's why we need a new birth we need a new birth because our natural birth is broken it is not of God it's Unholy we need to be born again by the holy spirit because that's how children of God are born that's how Jesus was born that's how Adam was born and that's how people are supposed to be born we need to be born by the word of God by the spoken word of God rather than the desire of men rather than the desire of women and that means we need to birth God's way instead of our way amen that's why a denominational birth won't won't happen and I'm telling you we can have denominational births in the message and we have it all the times because we say we believe the message therefore I have the Holy Ghost no the message is Christ and you've got to re receive him the person of him not the doctrine of him you've got to receive the person of him and be born again so that you're a new creation in Christ amen otherwise it's tainted to start with it's of it's of the desire and the will of men and women Paul calls it this way he says in 1 Corinthians and so it is written the first Adam was made a living soul and the last Adam was made a quickening spirit so who is the second Adam Christ what is he he's a quickening spirit it's a spirit that gives life that's what a quickening spirit is it's a life Spirit he's the Holy Spirit and we're going to get into godhead soon to explain that but the second adom is Christ and he's giving Life The Way We Were Meant to receive it amen by the spirit and power of God that's why you can't say the new birth is anything less than the than than receiving the Holy Ghost because that's a new birth it's the only part that gives you your a scriptural birth and pro a proper birth process he says how be it that was not first which is spiritual but that was it which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual see now we're born naturally and then we are born spiritually but Adam was born spiritually and then he came naturally see we're all twisted up we've got it backwards now sin inverted the plan of God we are supposed to be born of spirit and then we were supposed to be born of flesh but now we're born of Flesh completely wrong and then our spirit birth comes after that it's the New Birth by the Holy Spirit should have been spiritual first then second amen right now we're born first by the choosing of Mommy and Daddy and then second born by the choosing of God it was supposed to be by the choosing of God first and then through your parents he says the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven Adam came first he messed up but now it's the Lord of Heaven it's Jesus Christ himself and he's the one that makes all things new so when we're born of the second Adam when we're born of Christ we're born of the Spirit by the word in the manner that we were supposed to have been born in the first place so that's all that's happened here is when somebody says I'm receiving Christ I'm giving my heart to Christ and he confirms their their their their repentance and their baptism by the holy spirit all that's happening is the birth that you were supposed to have in the first place first place but the problem is now you got to deal with this tainted flesh why is it tainted we'll get into it maybe a little bit this service but certainly on Sunday Lord willing because Peter comes Beyond he says now he says we're being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever Peter says we've been born a corruptible seed why is it corruptible like I said eve made her mistake why do we have to pay for it but somehow our entire seed our entire uh human elements are corruptible there is nothing of God in them there's something that's broken amen he says but we are uh born of Incorruptible seed by the word of God Adam was born by the word of God Christ was born by the word of God you've got to be born by the word of God and it's the spirit that does it now we know our first birth is wrong because Peter says we've got to be born again our first birth is completely messed up we're born into the pain the sorrow the death the suffering but by the second birth now we're born into eternal life because we live and abide forever because it's a word birth so now we come back to the original question then what are the two trees in the garden the two trees in the garden are not literal trees they can't be they can't be but they are the principles of God regarding the production of life if I can put it that way they're placed in the midst of the garden of the human body brother Brown would say this he says they said we don't know you talking to Jesus we know you're a devil our fathers a Mana in the wilderness for the space of 40 years and Jesus said they're everyone dead but I am the bread of life that came from God out of Heaven if a man eats this bread he shall never die they said will this man give his body to eat they said now he's mad sure enough he says the bread of life was from the Tree of Life where they were eating from the Garden of Eden he was the Tree of Life Christ is the Tree of Life why because if you eat of Christ if you eat from Christ the word then you will have eternal life amen so that's your your first one who the question is not what was the tree of life it's who is the tree of life and it is Christ it is Christ but then he says now if the tree of life was a person then the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he says was also a person it's an embodiment if we want to put it that way it's an embodiment of the principle you have the principle of uh of Life by the word of God by the spirit of God then you have the principle of Life by knowledge and it comes with good and it comes with evil see Christ the word was supposed to be our source of Life his spoken word was what created the the the earth and the heavens and the humans and that was supposed to continue like I said Gods produced Gods when Adam was put on the Earth you go to Luke 3:38 and it says that Adam was the son of God so God's produced sons of gods who produce sons of gods who produce sons of gods we were supposed to be a race of gods of many gods of Sons and Daughters of God on this Earth and Adam was supposed to continue the work of producing life but what's the other option now Adam can produce Life by the spoken word in God's season because life comes by INSP pration not by choose not by choice God would have ordained it God would have had a time but now Adam has a second option for life he has it by the spoken word or he has it by his own body amen now Adam couldn't be tempted by choice in spirit form but when he's put into physical form he still can't be tempted by choice until the second attribute of Adam's brought out and now a woman is placed in his life now he's got a choice but God says do it my way and just ignore this other option God doesn't tell him what it's about God doesn't tell him what it's for God just says leave that alone don't do anything with that and you just wait on me and do it my way amen So within Adam it's physically possible to produce life he had a literal ability to produce life like any other man would he has seed but he needs a garden if I can put it that way and then I'm using the terms of scripture now okay I'll use the word words of scripture Adam has seed Adam has a tree he needs a garden right and we're talking about trees and fruit we're talking about seed as we'll get into in the next service so God says to Adam don't touch anything about the tree in the midst of the garden don't do anything with anything that's in the middle of it all what's the garden what's the danger listen to Eve's own words now she says she's talking to the serpent worst mistake ever but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it but catch what she says here neither shall you touch it don't it's not just about the eating it's about the touching young people there's a reason why we tell you don't touch before marriage because we'll see what happens is when you touch things happen and you can't help it and it leads down a certain path and so we teach you to keep yourself separate so that you don't awaken something that was innocent otherwise Adam and Eve were innocent until touch then when they touched when things were touched that's when things happened amen he said she said now you're not supposed to eat it we're not supposed to touch it l we die what is death separation from God says and then we know that he goes through and he says no no that's not the way it is and we'll cover this more on Sunday as we we really talk about what happened during the in the scene in the original scene but it says but when the woman saw okay she she started looking when the woman saw that the tree was good for food food her interest was quickened her curiosity was peaked she saw potential right and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise catches she is completely convinced of what the serpent said she's convinced that what he's talking about what he shared with her about her body about his body about her husband's body whatever she's completely convinced that this is a good thing it says she took of the fruit fruit thereof did eat so she partook of this fruit without her husband and then gave also so she gave once and then she gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat so she partook of the fruit once and then she went and she partook of it with her husband two separate events amen we'll get into this on Sunday and talk about what that was so what's they're talking about this woman's eating fruit This Woman's eating fruit and then she takes it to her husband and her husband eats fruit what is this all about well beautifully the scripture gives us our answers Song of Solomon says this such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickness no wickedness an adulterous woman notice it doesn't say fornication adulterous a married woman eats and then she wipes her mouth and says I didn't do anything what is it the physical act of intimacy is described in the scripture as eating amen adultery is called out not fornication fornications premarital in intimacy this is somebody a woman that's married having relations with somebody who's not her husband and it's called eating okay why not fornication because it's a married woman Solomon new what was talking about here he continues in Solomon in chapter 4 he says a garden enclosed is my sister not his actual sister Solomon wasn't a pervert that's just the way they talked about a woman that's the way they named it back then my sister my spouse she is a spring shut up a fountain sealed notice his wife is Clos to everyone else she's not to be touched by anyone else then he says thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with Pleasant fruits what is an orchard a group of trees and he says now to this woman you're a group of trees you have pleasant fruits camper with with spikenard spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrr and allows with all the chief spices he says you're a fountain of Gardens and a well of Living Waters and streams from Lebanon awake Oh north wind and Come Thou s blow upon my garden that the spices thereof May flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his Pleasant fruits this is all speaking of marital relations between a man and a woman between a husband and his wife so what is a garden Church a garden is a place where you plant seeds a garden is a place where fruit is grown amen it's a place that produces life in these scriptures the bride refers to herself as her husband's garden and when the act that they they perform together is called eating and her body parts are referred to as fruits I'm trying not to be too explicit this evening but you understand what I'm saying certainly the the more mature amongst us will understand then T of Solomon continues he says I come into my garden my sister my spouse I've gathered my myrrh with my spice I've eaten my honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my wine with th my milk eat oh friends drink yay drink abundantly oh beloved he says and then she says she responds my beloved has gone down into his garden to the bed of spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lies I am my beloveds my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lies all of the physical acts that are supposed to be within marriage are described as feeding on fruits on things that are from trees amen over and over Solomon refers to the woman as a garden a place for feeding a place for eating and it's all a reference to physical intimacy so then what is the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it is physical intimacy between a male and a female that's what it is that's all it is for the intention of producing life it is producing life by physical Choice rather than by the spoken word so the tree of knowledge is the ability to produce Life by your choosing rather than God's choosing amen it's taking matters into your own hands is what it is rather than waiting on God's timing God's season and that's really the root of the problem here is that they've been given an order they've been given a commission from God and he's told them don't do it this way and she gets completely turned around to where she does it the way God says don't do it and what did she do she took the matters into her own hands instead of doing it the way God said and she thought well he told me to produce life so I'm going to produce life I'm going to try it this way it hasn't happened any other way that's the way we try and do it isn't it we try and do things by wisdom we try and do it by knowledge we do it by Logic we do it by reason we do it by experience we do it by education and all we've produced Humanity I'm talking of is the death and destruction we see around us we think we're doing good and what comes out is we make it worse we get better on one side and we make it worse there and all we're doing is going higher and higher and higher in our levels of understanding and we're getting deeper and deeper deeper in our levels of Destruction you look at what we've done with with nuclear power we've made amazing weapons we've we've produced some of the cleanest possible energy but when things go wrong or it's put into the wrong hands or used incorrectly you got a power that can destroy this world many many many times over it can pollute every stream of water every ocean every Lake the the the potential for Destruction is so high with something so simple everything we do it it touches it remember it says it's a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and usually what it is is we think we're doing good and evil comes out of it because why we are convinced of our own rightness and that's the Human Condition we're convinced that because we think right because we believe it's right it is right and it's not the word of God is right and everything else is wrong that's what a Believer believes amen that's the Trap that he fell into she listened to the servant serpent long enough that he convinced her that this way that God said do not do this no matter what do not touch it she was convinced this is good and he completely Twisted her around in the word and what happened total separation from God and every bit of pain and suffering and sorrow that we have today is because she decided I'm going to try and do it but here's the thing she thought she was doing well remember brother Bram says you can be sincerely wrong sincerely wrong people are the hardest ones to correct because they did it with good intentions but this is how we know if we're right or wrong not by our sincerity by lining up with the word of God every single time what did she do she lost the authority of Sons and Daughters of God Paul would references Paul always amazes me the depth of scriptures that he had he says would to God you have bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me he says I know you think I'm foolish sometimes the things I tell you the things I write to you you go on and on about this stuff what are we children and he says for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband he says I I I have engaged you to one person one husband he says that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ notice he says i' I've engaged you to Christ there's only one person you're supposed to marry there's only one bride and there's only one bridegroom and that's Christ and his bride he says and I've engaged you to him as a Chase virgin nobody else is supposed to touch you before you get to him no religion no men's ideas no denominational thinking but here's his concern he says here's why I act the way I act here's why I write the way I write why I do the things I do he says but I fear I'm worried lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety that word beguile means to Holy seduced holy not h o l y w h l l y to completely seduce he says as the serpent completely seduced Eve through his subtlety what happened she wasn't a chased virgin when she came to Adam speaking frankly she lost her innocence she lost her virtue because she got tricked and Paul says I'm worried that you're going to get tricked and you're going to lose the innocence that comes with being a bride of Christ he says that how he he beguiled Eve how he completely seduced Eve through his subtlety we said before Satan's not coming across your your lawn and saying here I'm going to show you a way that's going to make you miserable and it's going to destroy your life and it's going to destroy your body and it's going to destroy your family it's going to destroy your walk with Christ Satan never does that he comes in nice and easy just one little bit of at a time one footstep one habit one door at a time just a little bit little bit little bit little bit and then 3 months down the road we wonder where we lost the victory it was in the first little bit and we're just realizing it now he says that your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ notice he worried about our minds cuz that's what Eve got she got beaten in her mind she got seduced in her mind he so wrapped her mind up in reason and logic and explanation and his understanding and her wow I never thought about it that way Church you don't have to think about it just take this the Simplicity of the word the Simplicity of Christ and believe it and God will show you the reality of it God will show you what it really means we don't have to understand everything but Satan comes to us and he says I understand it let me show you and he takes us down a path of death and destruction but he says so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that's in Christ because once the mind is convinced the body will follow you look at men that get seduced by women or women that get seduced by men it starts up here and when you give permission up here the body follows that's it I don't care what's your addiction what's your habit what your problem is you lose it here the body follows every single time it's a mind battle first and that's why we need a a holy ghost in our soul that we've got somebody fighting to push back on these things because otherwise the mind is completely Satan's we've got to have something inside of us that pushes back and what Up Is Us in Disobedience to God and His word because we've lost the battle of the Mind Paul saying I'm trying to keep you from from having what happened to Eve she got she talked too long with the wrong person she listened to the wrong thing she watched the wrong thing she listened to the wrong podcasts she hung around the wrong people and pretty soon her mind got corrupted from the Simplicity of only belief that's the only thing he asked her to do believe it and act on what you believe and she stayed around it too long and he says if you don't go and hide behind that word they'll get you with their arguments they'll get you with their reasons they'll get you with their education they'll get you with their experiences they'll get you with their victories and solutions absolutely and we end up in a place where we'll do exactly the wrong thing and think that we're going to please God with it because we've lost a mind battle let me finish with this thought and we'll finish the rest on Sunday Lord willing they're talking to Jesus and they're trying to catch him they're trying to trip him up fool him in the same day came to him the Sadducees which say there's no resurrection and asked him saying master master uh Master Moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother now there were with us seven Brethren there weren't and the first which he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother likewise the second also and the third under the seventh so they said and the last of all the woman died also so remember in the in the Old Testament days if your if your brother's if your brother died and he had a wife and he didn't have any any any sons then you had to go in and try impregnate his wife for him so that the family name could continue and so they said this woman she married the first brother he didn't produce an air she went into the second brother and then he couldn't produce one and they all died off one by one having tried to impregnate her having taken her to wife and then finally she dies having no Heir at all no children by any of them it says now therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her they said we've got a conundrum here Jesus over there she's going to have seven husbands who gets to say that's my wife Jesus answered and said unto them ye do Heir he says you're making a mistake not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God for in the Resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven Church we're in a process of redemption and we're being brought back to our original position our original bodies the way of being and Jesus says look when redemption's over you aren't going to be married the way you are here there is no marrying and giving in marriage over there there are no feelings associated with it there is no hold on somebody the way that you have on them here there was companionship in the garden but there was not marital intimacy so the question is how did we all get here if that wasn't there in the first place somebody had to break the intimacy barrier but he says listen when we get over when they get over there there is no wives like that there's only companions there's help meets remember people that are suited to you to be with you but brother Mark and sister Moren will not be husband and wife they'll be companions as long as they were the right ones we trust you are amen Jesus says you guys are you're so wrapped up in your own self you don't understand you're so Fallen you can't even understand over there there is no such thing as marriage why because there's only one bride and one bridegroom and that's Christ and the bride we're married to him and he is our life and he is our satisfaction and he is our love and he's all the feelings and emotions and things that we want with one another we're just a part of the same body look at it this way this is real simple okay that does nothing for me cuz I'm hugging myself over there Blanc and I will hug each other and all it is is me hugging myself we're part of the same body there is no sensuality when I touch myself and over there she will just be a part of me because we're all a part of the body of Christ there's no filth there there's no perversion there's no sensuality in those ways remember when brother brandham went over you don't believe me listen to our Prophet brother brandham goes over beyond the curtain of time and he says there's people coming up him men and women alike and the sisters sisters don't ever do this they run up to the to the prophet and they say our precious brother and they're giving him big hugs and he's like whoa but he says I didn't feel a thing why because it's Perfection Beyond perfection Beyond Perfection he's gone into a glor not in a glorified body but he's in a Heavenly condition now he's experiencing what we will experience in heaven there's no sensation for these things and his own wives too came up to him and hugged him and he felt no sensation and he said it was the best place he'd ever been and all he wanted to do was go back he says how could I be scared of going across crossing over beyond the curtain of time it was the greatest thing ever no sensation this is what Adam and Eve had in the beginning they were just companions just Companions and it's later that they cleave unto one another and they come into a certain relationship as we close on this David said oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him you know what e did she saw and she tasted what she wasn't supposed to and you know what it might have felt good it might have tasted good but what It produced was bitter in her belly amen it pays to wait on God we're in the season of adoption we're in the season of Resurrection we're in the season of rapture and it feels sometimes like we've got to make it happen we don't have to do a thing Church except only believe stay with the word of God and trust that in his perfect timing the life will come forth exactly the way it was planted amen God said you can eat all of the Trees of life you want out of the tree of life you can eat that all day every day but don't touch it and if they'd only listened church we wouldn't be where we are today but they did they tasted and they saw the wrong things you know what that's so often our problem is we're tasting and seeing far too many things that don't line up with the word of God and then we wonder where's the life where's the life where's the life what are you tasting and seeing amen if the musicians would come we can all stand together you know one of the hardest things a Believer has to do is wait wait on the Lord wait on his timing trust him to do the work I was talking with uh someone the other day and they were talking about Boaz remember when Ruth comes back the last state of Ruth is rest the last thing that she's doing is resting she's been she's been leave she's had to leave her her home she's had to leave her family she's had to leave her country she's had to leave her religion now she comes in and she comes into Israel and she and she's working and she's working and then she gets a promise and then she's supposed to go home and she's wondering and she's fretting and Nai says Ruth take your rest I know this guy and he won't rest until he does exactly what he's promised you he's going to do we're in the resting phase now that doesn't mean we're sitting on our couches but it means that we're trusting God to do the work that he said he was going to do he says he's going to give us rapturing faith I believe he's going to give us rapturing faith Faith he said he's going to heal our bodies I believe he's healing our bodies he said he's going to save our souls I believe he's saving Souls anden that he's filling with the Holy Ghost that he's producing his own life over again and producing images of Christ all over again amen God told Adam then God told Eve he says be fruitful and multiply and you know what she was the right person in the right place in the right season and all she did wrong was she got out of the time of God she forced the issue Don't force the issue Don't force the issue don't get so desperate that you take matters into your own hands Abraham and Sarah they forced the issue and we've had no rest in the Middle East ever since Moses forced the issue and all he got was one dead Egyptian brother Bram said wasn't in God's timing it pays to do what the L what the Lord says by the word taste and see that the Lord is good wait on the Lord and be of good courage and he'll strengthen your heart the scripture says amen that's what we're learning every day isn't it to wait on the Lord to trust him it's a waiting game Church scripture says it seems like he's going to keep waiting and waiting he's not going to come but then he's going to come and it'll be in a moment and you'll wonder how did it all happen so fast I believe there's people that are going to see it all happening and they'll be outside of it and they'll wonder I didn't see that coming how did I not see that coming because when God moves he moves in a Split Second and it's a quick short work and then it's all done people are like wait I thought I thought I thought I had time no be faithful now taste and see stay with the word of God and then when that time comes we won't be disappointed amen we'll be praising the Lord As We rise through the air amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord It's sobering to look at these things but Lord we know the scripture is given for our admonition Lord that we can learn Lord and we see here that Eve's problem was she stopped and listened to the wrong person Lord she didn't listen to your word she didn't feed on your word she didn't feed on on on the husband that you've given her to protect her and help her Lord she got out of place Lord Adam got out of place he didn't guard her either and Lord I pray you help us to stay in our place at our post of Duty heavenly father that we not look to the right nor the left Lord that we'd not look for answers outside of your word Lord that we'd not look for affirmation for satisfaction for Joy or peace or any of these things but Lord that we go to the fountain that you provided Lord The Living Word of God lord and that your presence by the Holy Spirit Lord would Quicken these things in our life Lord that we be impregnated by your word that we produce Christ all over again in our lives and our bodies Lord in our families in this very Church Lord help us to wait on you help us to have faith lord lord your word says the trial of our faith produces patience Lord I pray we be a patient people Lord that's built on faith in your word Lord you see our struggles you see mine Lord you see my failures Lord I pray you help me to keep it before you Lord not to try and take things into my own hands Lord but to rest in your word always Lord to trust that the work you started is the work you're going to finish Lord and it'll be perfect in each and every one of us grant us Grace we pray now in Jesus Christ's name amen bu land 10:27 I'm kind of homesick anybody homesick this evening y I'll tell you you spend some time out around this world you get homesick in a hurry amen it's good to come
