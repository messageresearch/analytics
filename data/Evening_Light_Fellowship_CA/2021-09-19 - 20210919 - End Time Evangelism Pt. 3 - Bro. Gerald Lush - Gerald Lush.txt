coming for my portion and he said and he wasn't he was determined not to leave without his portion i mean it was just a great attitude that always stuck with me that's how we want to come to church right coming looking for a portion and it's like uh brother brother just said recently that i heard he said church doesn't start when you get here church starts at home and you bring that attitude right into right into the to the sanctuary praise the lord let's sing five seven two here we are in your presence amen thanks sister priscilla for stepping up here amen praise the lord no that's 573.

[Applause] [Music] [Music] is the lord amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen i trusted in our souls all as well amen and brothers all depended on our faith brother we got rest we got peace we got joy it's according to your faith amen by the grace of god and brother all down through the ages god has come to give his elect to give his sons and daughters what they needed amen to encourage them amen to give them strength to keep pressing on keep pressing on oh brother it had to be a reality for sure oh yes to the seed of god that even endured this endure this experience this experience that amen to many they just stop and forget it but no because of what god had given because of god what god had revealed they get pressing on oh no they didn't want to stop amen because they could look down and see the promise of god they could see the end result by the grace of god so brother and it encourages the believers this is where i come from and this is where i'm going amen i'll tell you there's not there's not many that are that are believing that today there's not many that are hearing that preach today concerning where we come from why we're here and where we're going oh no to most that are being preached today is always this this happened and oh yeah god let the devil do this let the devil do that oh now oh now you got to come back and redeem us yeah but we got we got a revelation of who we are amen as the sons and daughters of god amen brother sister amen yeah we're sinners saved by grace but understand he came to save his sons and his daughters praise the name of the lord to god be the glory oh there are others out there too that he that he's going to save amen but they're they're we're focusing on the bride amen that's him the prophet was focusing on the bride and it got to the place where he yeah even brother branham was becoming critical of others he was critical of those outside the message he was critical of this critical that until the angel came down said brother roman don't you do that he said because some of them are my children amen so the problem was ordained with the word to focus on the bride amen he would leave the rest with god amen so brother sister god help us to keep that right attitude and they keep their right spirit understand this then all that god has allowed to happen there's a reason almost definitely to bring out what's in you and in me to bring up what's in is sons and daughters praise the lord is nature his character amen his actions his reactions amen how would god react in this i would what would god do in this situation amen well that's what he what he would do he's required of you and me amen when i just dared to condemn we're not just here to kill we're not just here to do that no no we're there amen to encourage faith to encourage hope amen in the plan of redemption praise the name of the lord so we're challenging even those outside to keep a right attitude and a right spirit amen by the grace of almighty god just think if the problem of god was convicted condemning that woman that was walking down the street maybe because she had slacks on she had this on she had that on and the angel said don't you do that he said they said some of their she said some of them are my children amen brother i guess it was surprising for the prophet to think that amen because we focus on the bride amen the bride is in the city but again you've got to understand there's going to be many outside the city that's right that's right praise the name of the lord because the bible does say when it comes to the bride is you're going to sit with me in my throne and those outside the city are going to come and bow before you amen in the book of revelation so brother we've got to understand that and keep up keep our attitude right keep our spirit right by the grace of god praise the name of the lord so brother i pray grace god help us with that anointing and brother i tell you god's going to require it more and more and more closer we get to the rapture amen because that's the only attitude that's the only spirit that's going to be raptured is a right attitude and a right spirit right motives right objectives amen that the mind that was in god is in you amen oh yeah the plan and purpose and love that was that is in god is in the bright amen the prophet god said as long as the bride is here he said there's grace amen so i pray grace that we have grace i pray grace that we're reflecting grace amen grace for me is grace for them most definitely amen brother oh but but they're not they're not bright no but they again maybe they're going to be outside the city amen and they'll bring their glory and their honor into the city to visit the bride oh my let's let's respect them as god would respect him amen by the grace of god and brother god has given us the word to give us the faith to recognize who we are why we're here where we're going and how to get there let's focus on that we're not here just to condemn this one condemn that one here to encourage the word faith in god amen and brother the faith that we got the revelation we got is far from the from the revelation that luther wesley and the pentecostal said oh amazing oh yeah that is pointing to what god was doing in their day amen what they needed what they hungered for what brother god god gave him the hunger god gave him the thirst amen because he knew there's coming a generation that would need it all amen they only needed this they only needed that but you and i need that plus amen to get us out of time and into eternity amen amen god god making an end of it what he promised and remember he's the alpha but he's also the omega amen the alpha of revealing himself in christ the omega christ repeating himself in the bright praise the name of the lord so brother we need to really really get more and more into the revelation of who we are get more and more and under the control of the revelation of where we come from amen do you know where you come from oh well i was a sinner i'm saved well good i'll see you outside the city oh no brother i'm the son of god the situation i'm the daughter of god amen amen i was with him in be before sin amen my name was on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world praise the name of the lord hallelujah and that is his bride that is his chosen the elect of god to god be the glory into the jews of course it comes on into the gentiles but going back to the what a plan oh my what a purpose that god has got in his word amen this is not just the bible that that oh man that luther saw brother because he knew they read it not all luther's come to the revelation of was justification amen other sanctification well the pentecostals thought they had it all the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but you know what some pentecostals realize oh my this must be getting us ready for the coming of the lord oh yeah it's pointing to the coming of the lord amen because god justified him sanctified him the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit oh lord what are you going to do now lord this is the end surely now lord we're going to the resurrection and rapture but they never recognized the way that god was doing it amen through malachi 4. thank god for the revelation in our hearts amen thank god that we we understand what we are who we are why we are here and not out there with pentecost as i said brother i was born and raised in the salvation army and brother went on from there and went on into the pentecostal church and i stayed there stayed there stayed there yeah because i knew that they were the ones that got the last ones that god had used and i was waiting for the next move of god amen and as i said it was 1965 december that i was baptized in the pentecostal church yeah eat them to eat tabernacle amen yeah and then six months later i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ in bishop falls river amen brother bill lackett baptized me amen because when i went back to gamble for the holidays oh because i was going to school and holidays i go back to gamble amen because that was our hometown and i always have fellowship with brother and sister barnes amen and other brothers and sisters amen when i got back why because they were non-denominational and they preached this they believed this they believed that amen they listen to oral roberts say hey allen amen yeah t.l osborne and other ministering brethren on on tapes or on records oh yeah records back that far amen but when i got back in 1966 they said we got news for you i said what is it she said god instead of prophet amen someone had brought to them the revelation of the message and the messenger amen and from there we stepped into the light of the revealed word amen thank god oh hallelujah brother he did what he wanted to do luther wesley pentecost amen and what we needed was the revelation of the word to give us rapturing faith amen resurrection faith not just justification not just signification and not just the faith the baptism of the holy ghost gifts of the spirit brother now we need to go on amen into eternity sons and daughters of god and the bride of the lord jesus christ this is tremendous thank god for the word and thank god for oh yes for the seed that's in you and me amen the seed that was planted before the foundation of the world amen so that we would we would recognize what god was doing and what god would do amen are we recognizing what god's doing now amen do we know what's going on not just 40 years ago not 50 years ago not a hundred years ago do we know what god is doing now amen or we can look back to history but what about the present tense now amen because even the prophet is come and gone amen but the message of the revealed word is still here amen yes sir but what is our attitude toward that revealed word amen amen what is their attitude toward what god is doing that's right amen unfortunately too many recognize what god did in malachi 4 but when he left the scene that was it and then we just went back oh well we believe this doctrine we believe that doctrine yeah but they're now they're no more than just a denomination out there that's the truth but the bride is getting into the word into the word into the word amen right what word what's it going to do what effect is it going to have on us amen what's going to be the results of the word the message in you and me now since the prophet has come the prophet is gone amen the mystery of god's revealed what is it ordained for to give us rapturing faith now it's amen what god did and what god's doing in the word in the message of the hour is to give us the faith to get out of here by the grace of god brothers one thing to come out of egypt is another thing to go into to go into the promised land amen that the power of god has said he said god has delivered us out of denominational egyptian bondage that's right amen yes praise the lord but no brother sister yeah the prophet is gone amen where's joshua amen where's the joshua ministry amen we got joshua here amen praise the lord reminding us of the joshua ministry amen ordained to take us in that's right come on they said oh but you know before they say oh we can't do this we can't do this we can't do that yeah he's but he said if god be for us who can be against us amen amen the hour come to get in they are come to possess the land the hours come to possess eternity amen back where we come from and when we feel uncomfortable in this world we just don't feel well brother lord where am i what's going on here i don't understand all this this isn't this is not where i come from not where i'm going amen this is our attitude toward the world we're living in amen so why because god has given us the revelation of who we are amen where we come from and where we're going amen and i tell you more and more that goes on in this world we're getting discontented here oh yeah we're getting just oh you're not at peace here we're not at rest here comes that the peace and the rest that we have is pulling us into another dimension it's putting us in the glory pulling us into the kingdom of god is pulling us hallelujah into the new jerusalem amen oh yes we got to be more than willing to let go let god have his way how many really want to get out of here how many got such an experience amen with god with the word and such a revelation that oh they're not caught up with what's going on this whole world no no or you're not interested in it no i'm not interested in that i you live here you do this you do that you're surely you're interested in what's going on you want to help here and help them no i said i want to get out of here get out where you going where are you going i'm going to the kingdom of god i'm going to the new jerusalem amen i'm i'm amen i'm looking for to get into a new heaven and a new earth by the grace of god understand this you young people too understand it maybe that you don't be deceived by what's going on in this whole world and think oh yes everything is good everything's good we got no worries man can do this man can do that brother but man can't do anything spiritual oh it's got to be god amen any anything that we need to do and the revelation we got considering what's going on all over the world lord we need to get out of here lord if this goes on much longer oh where lord lord where will you be amen because i'll tell you this brother it it always really really causing a burden in me because there was a time oh yes and i see those pictures sometimes coming up on the my computer's responding regarding screensaver and oh i see this brother sister back years ago and i said oh lord i said the atmosphere now it's not like the atmosphere then that's right no siree because if you were in your house if you were outdoors you were shopping no matter what it was there was an anointing that you felt you was anointing that you experienced amen and you met your brothers and sisters in christ here or there oh what anointing it was in the atmosphere but it's not like that now no no brother is in the atmosphere is in the bride now it's in the bride amen it's not in the atmosphere it's in the bright amen amen praise the lord it is amen because god because that god has god's been turned down they don't want god they're not into god they're not into the spiritual religious but not spiritual amen amen but the bride is spiritual that's right i trust you are spiritual amen we're going and we're living a spiritual life our actions and reactions are spiritual amen as as was able amen in in genesis and as was the the prophets and through the old testament amen their spiritual revelation of god what god amen noah spiritual revelation went and enoch oh yeah enoch walk with god amen and brother god's looking for anything in the bride is that do you walk with god that's right amen if we want to be raptured like enoch we have to walk like enoch walk with god amen but i don't care where you are i don't care what you're doing you're walking with god that's right amen there's no way you leave him and you don't leave him behind i don't care what you're doing how you do it when you do it where do you do it amen he's with you amen you can't forget him amen if there's any conscience you're in any any presence you're more conscious of it's jesus yes that's right grace in the name of jesus to our young brothers and sisters yes even mom and dad grandma and grandpa amen grace of god that you're more conscious of jesus than you are of what's going on in the world oh that's the only way you're going to get into the rapture that's the only way you're getting into the resurrection you've got to be more conscious of jesus you've got to be in a closer fellowship more personal relationship with jesus by the grace of god amen so the grace of god be with us as we go again into his word amen and consider what god yes what god has done but what's god doing amen he did this he did that what's he doing amen do you know what he's doing are you experiencing what he's doing amen are you a part of what he's doing amen we can look back and say oh yeah he did this he did this he did that we identified with luther and wesley pentecostals amen with him brethren well what's he doing william brabham's gone amen and many of the andy and he as i said the problem of god told our brother level that the older generation would go on before the rapture oh yes he said they're not they're not going to be here for the rapture he said drug would they be here for the resurrection but not the rapture amen there's another generation rising and he did say he said you young ministers are going to take this message on to the coming of the lord take it on to the resurrection take it on to the rapture o brother grace i pray grace that the ministry father our brothers earl the minister of our brother jonathan heir amen is laying in the word to give us resurrection rapturing faith to keep us focused on what god's doing that's right amen and brother the only oh well god's doing this out in the world yes it's judgment amen it's judgment but he's calling the bride unto himself amen because amen the marriage of the lamb is come and his bride has made herself ready amen oh she made ready yes that's why god gave said the prophet that's why god opened the revelation of the seals and all that what for it was what the bride needed to get ready amen to increase our faith to encourage our faith amen that it is the faith that we're believing now oh we're not going back there to that church or that church and yet there's many gone back there to just william branham william branham william branham god sent a prophet god set a prophecy yes thank god let's get let's get move on amen and as i said i preached it in in in [Music] indiana not indiana no in virginia many years ago 1995 i think i said listen i said after the bride's gone they'll still be preaching god has sent a prophet i said so i says be on our guard to recognize why he said the prophet what he's doing now amen through the promised ministry ordained to give us the faith that he wants to save give us the faith amen to cause us to live this life live that life add this attitude that attitude amen that we're going to act and react this way amen not like they do there religious no but as the spiritual sons and daughters of god amen in i've been ministering on end time evangelism end time evangelism is getting your bride ready for the rapture amen brother sister it's not the evangelism that oh we preached 40 years ago 50 years ago no the evangelist now is focusing on the bride by the grace of god amen let's get let's get out of the desert and into the promised land amen chair of israel came out of egypt into the desert amen oh yeah and they did this and they did that no and god blessed them god brought food down from heaven and so on because they they were hungry and they needed this need of that amen boy but then there came a time to move on amen so where's our faith in what god as is doing in the sense oh he's given us this he's blessed with us blessing with that or is he giving you the faith for the resurrection are you getting more serious amen concerning the resurrection more serious amen you can't get oh i listen saints the closer we get to the resurrection the closer we get to the rapture brother it's going to be very very difficult for us to get it out of our minds whatever you're focusing on i got to do this i got to do that you can't get it out of your mind you're thinking about it oh well i should do this i should do this oh yeah oh yeah it becomes a burden but brother that's natural things what about spiritual now the spirituals to take preeminence over the natural amen again it's not me lives as christ living in me and if christ is living in you he's there alleluia to bring the word to pass he's there to fulfill the word he's there to make it flesh in you and me amen what's he going to make flesh now oh the resurrection the rapture amen god help us amen that oh praise the lord oh the saints that are going out they're right here amen the red air oh are you waiting for them no i'm not waiting for them they're waiting on me oh they are yeah again let me repeat it the bible god said god is waiting on us and he said the dead in christ are waiting on us amen amen amen why because we're the generation that's ordained to move on into the faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture amen and it's going to bring them out of where they are into that dimension and they're going to appear to us and the power of god says oh praise the lord amen always like i said one time i was going to a mall and i saw somebody walking i said who's that i said lord is that sister zonzo they were younger and i said oh lord and this is not the resurrection yet this is not the rapture amen but when it does come oh yeah that one will appear to you this will appear to you amen what if sister coffee comes to a pair back to us will you recognize her are you looking for her she's going to be young by the grace of god amen oh yeah they're going to appear to us amen because what is going to be our faith that's right it's going to be our faith it's going to bring them on the scene amen and then we're going to step with them into eternity take with them into another dimension into a glorified body by the grace of god amen let's be more conscious please amen in the name of jesus be more conscious of what god is focusing on oh my brother sister this evangelism focused on on justification this evangelion sanctification oh yeah the event pentecostal evangelism and evangelistic ministry the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but now we're focusing on the bright rapture amen oh i understand he saw that god has done and what god is doing now in these last days he said is to give the bride righteousness faith amen they get us to focus on the rapture amen do we really really believe in the rapture are we really really looking for the rapture and you young people and i know sometimes it's so much there to get caught up with are you looking for the rapture amen are you discontent in this world amen are you are you praying lord we need the world changed we need to get out of this go get away from this lord look what's going on in the world look what's going on in in education look what's going on in in jobs and so on oh my god help us brother is getting more and more and more antichrist antichrist influence and brother again the problem of god remind us remember the false anointing he said that that's up on the earth in the last days he said it's not a false anointing the anointing is right but he's the false teaching amen the teaching is false brother make sure we're under the right teaching amen oh yeah because he said the anointing is going to be so close it would deceive the very elect if possible oh yeah what well i'll tell you this if it would deceive the very elect they're possible it has to be around the message around what god has done and what god is doing and the enemy is there to deceive us yes oh yes definitely the enemy is there or for to enter our faith god help us amen brother we're going to go on with the faith that god has revealed and god is revealing and brother like i said he focused on it focused on it in in luther's day focused on justification justification justification sanctification on down to the pentecostal baptism of the holy ghost gift of despair amen but now it is the resurrection rapture god did that god did this god did that but brother what about the resurrection rapture and brother now he brothers the hour and he sent the prophet he sent the ministry of a prophet to prove to us amen because the dead was raised so many times in that ministry to show us this is the hour of the resurrection oh praise the lord thank god so bro and not only yeah and god raised the humans that had died and god raised even animals that had died amen well it's come to the place for the amen new heaven and new earth humans and and animals amen that god created praise the lord not just you and me but all by grace to god be the glory amen amen praise the lord god bless you not meaning to take so long because our brother joshua wants it once sometime after i finish here and we'll see but i wanted to want to share with you again some thoughts concerning end time evangelism amen it's not going out there and all sharing the message with this one of the world that in the world get more people into the message no no it's for the people in the message to get out of here and into the resurrection this is end time evangelism to give us that faith by the grace of god amen the bible god emphasized it he highlighted it amen oh what are we to do what do we have it always says the faith to get out of here amen grace god bless you this stand yes brothers sister saying only believe oh my only believe what god's done what god doing grace amen so that amen so that your life is a reflection of what god's doing by the grace amen that's a tremendous challenge look at look at yourself in the mirror of the revealer by the grace of god as i said brother perry green when he was wondering no who crucified the lord look who's about jesus [Music] and he walked in off a platform or something there was a mirror there looked in the mirror oh he said that's a crucified jesus he said i did forgive me lord it was for your sin it's for your redemption for our redemption that he laid down his life amen it was for you it was for those whose names were on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world he knew you amen and brother when in the revelation of what he was doing we would know him amen beyond the bible says oh we can cry father hallelujah oh yeah sin took away the revelation but the grace of god by the holy ghost brings it back so that why when we see this we see oh oh praise the lord yes no i can cry father father i know him and he knows me i'm his son i'm you're his daughter amen you know him now we know him as our father grace let's sing only believe all things are possible [Music] yes all things [Music] amen

because constantly morning noon and night father the spirit is reminding us to look up look up father for the change look up for the redemption of our bodies to look up for the resurrection and the

brother chad's prayer today amen i believe it was god amen the anointing of the spirit interceding on our behalf praise the lord and also to bring greetings from uh frank we know him as frankie frankie green that is sister greene's son and uh of course when i first met him and knew him he was only just maybe a teenager i remember being in sister green's home and frankie was just on the floor kicking things amen he was just a young boy and that was when i first came to into contact with his mother and she came to the message amen and also brother and sister smith at this at that same time and it was it was in in burn and uh where they live and frank uh frankie uh called me yes or he was yesterday the day before and apparently he was at the cemetery our cemetery in down around the buren area that our brother eber sister eileen reeves husband he's been looking after the cemetery for us and the cemetery oh frankie was uh very impressed with it and he said thank you thank you thank you for what you've done and what you're doing and he said and you you you realize we're using hebrew and hebrew was right there to do whatever we wanted done with the cemetery and even when frankie was there at the time he said oh he said the lights just come on and uh because even had installed lights over the poles around the cemetery and at a certain hour the lights come come on and uh and frankie looked and he saw the lights he said this is amazing he said just want to call you and let you know i appreciate it and to thank you and and to thank the church he said in st john's so he said pass my greetings on to them amen i don't know if anybody else there met sister green's son frankie amen so uh and again of course the house that that they lived in with his mother and father that that's not theirs now others have got that house but frankie does have a house just on the opposite side of the of that road just up from what used to be sister green's home amen but on the other side of the road maybe three or four hours is up is uh is frankie so we pray the grace of god to bless frankie amen amen and pray the grace of god to deal with our brother amen and i understand he has son and daughter but there in western canada right now alberta and british columbia so he wanted me to pass on greetings to to the church here amen so so receive the greetings from frankie green amen and presently as i said he is 65 years old and it's hard for me to believe amen so uh but again he was really pleased in in the fellowship we had over the phone so the lord bless him amen and also again i did pass on these thoughts that regarding our brother ed cater in grand falls and it's tremendous and uh to to believe that after all these years our brothers come back to the word amen after all these years our brother come back to the message because brother because i remember when he was even pastoring that church that brother cater had in grand falls yeah he was pastoring there preaching there ministering there and he doesn't remember what i remember there the last time i preached there and i just laid in the word late in the world i think some of the saints from here was out there then and it's a long time ago and i remember i said uh when i was preaching and brother ed was sitting in a seat front seat there and two of his young boys were on the floor lying on the floor and i preached and i don't know exactly what i said now and i laid it in laid it in and all of a sudden brother ed screamed oh he raised his eyes he raised his hands and he screamed and screamed praising the lord for the word thank you jesus and god was dealing with our brother amen so and after and i don't know how long after that he sort of just went on doing what he wanted to do what he used to do i think in the world for a number of years yeah and now the lord dealt with him and he's been and i understand that he's been watching us online so i pray god's grace to our brother ed cater amen it's a wonderful blessing amen maybe the lord might bring him into our fellowship with us sometime and sister rose be his wife amen so god bless him brother i pray grace that he that he's not missing the resurrection that he's not missing the rapture praise the name of the lord and of course we're familiar with his brother alec alec was there for a few months and i understand now that ellicott's in halifax i think and of course his brother alan cater and alan did minister for us the last time he was there two or three years ago and brother allen of course is in uh brother danny olsen's church in ontario so the grace of god be with us brother it's the last it's the late hour oh yeah brother what's god doing oh my the movie of the spirit in this this brother that brother this sister that sister brother i pray grace that we're not going to miss the resurrection grace that will not miss the rapture amen so god bless our brother ed cater and sister green's son frankie amen so and uh again to thank the lord for brother chad's prayer i pray god answer prayer and yes as brother bobby referenced i think the church doesn't start here the church starts in your heart at home you're not coming to church you come with the church amen to represent the church by the grace of god amen and also be in prayer for myself sister betty that the lord willing on wednesday that we'll be journeying to central newfoundland and i intend to go visit our brother ellsworth and sister ellsworth and our brother and sister our brother clarence stride and his stepdaughter linda peckford so and so god bless them so and again like i said i've known them for many many years maybe 50 years so i pray the grace of god to bless our fellowship and also of course with the brothers and sisters in central newfoundland and uh lord willing our brother doug sister beverly in western newfoundland and sister and gayle brother claude's wife she's still in the home in dearly amen so we pray the grace of god to bless us as we continue on with the word and again brother in a sense end time evangelism evangelism for what we knew what was it what was evangelism it was just it was just getting sinners to come to church you know come to church come to church believe on the lord believe on the lord and so on well brother that was evangelism down through the ages but not now the the the evangelism that we're cut out with is amen is turning our hearts from time to eternity oh yes praise the lord on the the other evangelism is focusing on time time but now we're getting out of time into eternity and god is focusing not on time but on eternity there comes a generation that god wants to have that faith for eternity amen the faith of the resurrection the faith of the rapture brother he gave the others the faith to lead them on to another church age lead them onto it to another ministry but now we're in the last days amen so there is no other ministry brother amen he's come down in the bride it's christ in the bride brother he was the alpha and the prophet said now christ in the bride is the omega amen do god be the glory so end time evangelism for the bride is not getting all believers come and join the message come and join the message no now it's the goal is to go out of time into eternity that is end time evangelism amen it's again the problem god said it's giving the bride rapturing faith and he said what god has done what god is doing he said it's been focusing on on the rapture and to give us the faith we need amen it's not just a faith god has sent a prophet it's not just a faith that god has revealed this mystery this mystery that mystery amen concerning these doctrines no no now brother it is the faith for the rapture it is the end of time and going back to eternity amen so god help us we're all what about being a witness oh yeah the life you live is going to be a witness amen and there's going to be a generation stabili there's going to be left behind and when and when they're going they're going to see this happen this happened in the world that happened in the world then they realized oh my oh my i thought there should be a rapture i thought it would rapture where's the rapture yeah and it'll strike them it already happened and you didn't know it is the rapture going on are you aware of it there's going to be a generation that's going to be past and they never they didn't know what god was doing amen you want to be in the rapture you got to be conscious of the rapture you want to be in the rapture you're going to counsel what god's doing god help us amen that we're not living for ourselves not living for this one or that we're living for jesus we're living for the resurrection living for the rapture brother he wants to get us out of time into eternity he wants to get us to sit with him at the marriage supper of the lamb by the grace some believe oh lord that that's just now that's the message we're protecting the merits of the lamb i trust we are spiritually by trust we're going to sit with him amen in glory by the grace of god amen as is bride amen and brother it's only the bride is going to sit with them in his throne the others say oh yes there's going to be many others say but they're going to be outside the city brother conduct yourself as a bride amen not just those outside the city as the bride by the grace of god amen and again i'll try not to be too long and after i'm finished our brother joseph will come and speak and he wanted to take a few minutes to uh advise concerning kobe 19 yeah so again brother sister when it comes to colbert 19 i know there are believers that won't bother to wear a mask or do this or do that and well you should you know it's like the father of god traveling overseas he had to take certain uh injections and so on now he said i i don't need it but he said i'll take it and so he took it every time he go overseas he get those injections yeah and and uh so brother sister in this hour in this age if you've got resurrection rapturing faith that's fine well if they want you to do this once you're dead go do it amen and move on but your faith is still in jesus your faith is still in the rapture your faith is still in the resurrection keep your attitude right and keep your spirit right by the grace of god amen it is the end and there's going to be a lot of things happening but brother the world's not going to recognize what god's doing to give the bright rapture in faith amen they won't know that but the bride only the bride will know it grace amen in deuteronomy chapter 11 and verse 16 [Music] and to give you some thoughts concerning end time evangelism and again it is a couple of sermons that i preached some maybe four or five years ago so i don't share some stuff with you again so be with me in prayer amen in verse 16 he said take eid to yourselves that your heart be not deceived amen and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them amazing and then the lord's wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not earth fruit lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you amen therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart amen and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes the word having preeminence in our lives amen it's not you living it's the word living in you oh brother it's an hour when the word is is it's going to have absolute control of the bride you're not living the word living in you amen brother the word made flesh the word made flesh in you that's right amen you're the you're of the bible praise the lord it's getting to an hour now where even in education they're not allowed to have bibles in in schools not allowed to read bibles in schools publicly and so on brother grace of god be with us rather they won't be allowed to read you they won't be allowed to do to see your reflection oh no let's get into the place they'll stop that they're stopping this then they'll stop you and your testimony amen god help us and it says and you shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou set us in thine house and when they walk us by the way and when they lie us down and when thou rises up brother the word the message in control morning noon and night and thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thine house and upon thy gates amen god in control god bless you may be seated and turn with me to the book of joel chapter 2. amen the book of joel chapter 2 and beginning to read verse 11 and the lord shall utter his voice before his army for his camp is very great for he is strong that executeth his word for the day of the lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it amen therefore also now saith their your heart saith the lord turn ye even to me with all your heart amen and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning amen and rend your heart and not your garments yes amen you can rent your garments but not your heart amen there's many that that are over there really sincere religiously but what about spiritually amen and is anything god's looking for is your spiritual experience amen and that is not necessarily physical but it's in your heart by the grace of god and he says and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil amen brother is god revealing himself to us and to turn again to the familiar scripture of malachi 4. amen and these are the scriptures i read during the message on end time evangelist about five years ago amen and in malachi chapter 4 and verse 5 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children amen and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse amen there is a couple other scriptures i've written down here let's see matthew chapter 17. matthew 17 praise the lord and beginning to read at verse 9 and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead and his disciples ask him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things amen praise the lord but i say unto you that elias has come already that's during his first coming but he prophesied elias said the second coming to restore all things amen and they knew him not but they have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them and even as he suffereth so we're going to suffer we take our stand for the truth take our stand for the word you're going to pay a price amen stay with the word don't compromise god help us we're living in a very compromising generation a very compromising age amen but brother i pray the grace of god that as the bride of christ we're not going to compromise i tell you if you are bright you want amen no way will you compromise you'll stay with the word you're going to take your stand for the truth i don't care where it is whether it's at your home or in your school with your family with your friends your neighbors you're going to stay with the word amen god help us oh yes it's going to take the holy ghost the anointing of the holy ghost can take a greater anointing amen and brother we need to have the spiritual anointing not a religious one or you can have a religious anointing oh yeah a compromise here compromise there amen but if you've got a spiritual indicting there's no compromise you stay with the word you give jesus preeminence amen praise the lord hallelujah i pray the grace of god that we have that spiritual igniting and brother what we believe is so real to us amen concerning the kingdom of god concerning the new heaven and the new earth oh brother sister that is not fairy tales it's just not all that the bible said this and you know prophecy prophecy that many a generation has taken lightly amen but no brother now we're coming to the place where god wants to bring it to pass amen god wants to make it pleasure in you and me concerning the resurrection concerning the rapture amen oh luther look for this blessing look for that amen then they praise god for this praise god for that and the pentecostals but now you and me brother sister god's given us a revelation that he never give them concerning the resurrection and the rapture amen and brother god went and he lived out in flesh what he give them now he wants to live out in you and in your flesh what he's given us amen by the grace of god see the prophet of god came and in three pulls of his ministry amen god revealed the word revealed the word revealed the word amen until after the third point oh yeah he kept pointing to the third bull first full second poll then he complained to the third one the third pole the third pillar amen and the angel and the angel instructed the prophet of god get the people to believe amen because anything that we need to do now is to believe the message amen we need to believe what god has done and we need to believe what god is doing amen i tell you if we're bright we believe amen we believe in the resurrection we believe in the rapture and not only that it's it's going to happen up the future we believe that's what's going on right now amen that the anointing that the bride is experiencing that the anointing that's bringing us together the anointing that's causing us amen to fellowship is the resurrection rapture oh my brother sister back back in those years or the the lutheran fellowship the methodist fellowship the pentecostals fellowship amen why because they had this in common and they had that in common and for years and years and years they got together thank god for what he had done and what he was doing in their lives amen so now brother amen when we move beyond all of that so what do we have in common praise the name of the lord amen what is what is it that god has revealed to us and what is it that god is requiring of us in these last days by the grace of god what is it what revelation is there brother sister that is giving us faith what revelations are giving us hope amen the method or the lutherans rather they had that faith for them for justification and wesley for sanctification and the pentecostals they had the faith for the gifts of the spirit and the baptism of the holy ghost amen all the emphasis was on speaking in tongues the emphasis was on this oh my wherever you went with pentecostals you could feel it in the atmosphere oh yeah only there was there was an anointing there was a the atmosphere was different and as i was talking to the lord just a few days ago and i said lord i said oh my what an hour we're living i said because the atmosphere is dead amen there was an atmosphere in luther's day wesley's day the pentecostal day amen i remember the pentecostal age i remember the pentecostal revival i remember the anointing amen and the spirit of the revival oh my brother sister you get up in the morning and the anointing was there amen because i and then my family you're going to remember me even when we lived in saint john's and then i would get up in the morning and i would go to the window and look at the sun rising and and praise the lord amen because the anointing was in the atmosphere when i go to bed at night and lay down the anointing was in the atmosphere in the home that i lived in if i walked it on the street you know he was there amen but now where's the anointing oh brother it's not there like it used to be not by any means brother because back then if i about years and years ago if i'm at pentecostals praise the lord hallelujah you know he was on them the anointing was on me we have fellowship amen the anointing of what pulled us together the anointing is what made us to fellowship amen and the same thing with believers back back years and years ago when we first came to the message oh yes definitely amen we get together believers hell praise the lord hallelujah god bless your brother god bless you sister thank god for the prophet amen oh but that anointing is gone amen and even even even now i said lord i said where's the anointing now the anointing is in the heart of the bride amen oh it's gone it's where it's been rejected so much the anointing is not in the atmosphere like it used to be the united states not even in churches like it used to be you know it is not not in believer's homes like it used to be brother it's going to come back back back back to the anointing in our hearts amen the anointing is in your soul you know it's in your spirit amen but brother it's getting to the place where jesus said when the son of man comes will he find faith that's right on the earth amen amen oh yeah why where's the word the faith for the resurrection where's the faith for the rapture brother people are caught up too much with this world they're caught up too much with what the devil's doing and they're cut out less and less and less with what god's doing amen god did this god did that but what's he doing in your life what's he doing in your heart what's he doing in your soul amen what do you feel on the inside of the inside by the grace of god and so god have mercy on us amen because as time goes on we say we we feel the anointing less and less and less and less in the atmosphere so why because it's come down down down to just in you in your heart amen oh my brother no wonder that he questioned when the son of mankind will he find faith amen because i remember about years ago when my family lived in here amen and we get up on a sunday morning oh we look out and we see or even even in in our hometown in gamble look out and see people going walk going to go in the church oh yeah you you sense that atmosphere especially you knew you knew it was sunday oh yeah because if you went outside all the atmosphere was different or you sensed it you felt it amen and we look outside and we see people going to church amen oh yeah they're going to church oh they're dressed to go to church and and you see them while i remember seeing them walk up the road and they walk and walk and walk into the church and they have their bible in their hand oh yeah they have their bible there and then they'd be hugging their bible men going to church not now neither take the bible the church will leave it there or don't take it there at all yeah why because back then they gave the word preeminence amen brother i tell you the bread that's going in the rapture she's given the word preeminence in her heart and soul she's giving god preeminence to giving jesus preeminence amen she can truly say is not me that lives as christ that liveth in me amen so i pray grace brother that we'll continue on in the spirit amen by the grace of god and the spirit in us the holy spirit in us by the grace of god that we're not oh i pray grace lord that we're going to be spiritual and not religious amen oh this is sunday we got to do this we got to do that no you got to do it there's a time brother when when christians even even denominations oh yeah and i i remember even even in the anakin church there in my hometown oh yeah there's people walking up the street going to the salvation army people walking up the street going to the ancient church and oh yeah not now oh one time you walked by this church wacked out of church and you could sense you could sense there was a different anointing there oh yeah but now now church a lot of churches are torn down now i remember back some years a few years ago i remember driving in certain places and there was this church there was this church there was that church oh now the church are torn down yeah and as i talked to another lady about a certain denomination there and we were discussing about the condition of churches in these days and she said pastor i gotta agree with you she said i go to this church and and she said one time she said i used to teach sunday school and she's oh my she said every sunday she said there'd be a lot of young people there and but now she said there's hardly anyone under 40. i said what oh yes she said we had i had to stop we stopped the sunday school we stopped this teaching that teaching because there's so few there that want it amen and that's that's in what we would consider to be a very a very denominational church a very you know spiritually cold church amen but yet she felt the anointing in herself to teach the young people she wanted to teach them about the lord she wanted teaching about god she wanted to teach them about the word about the bible but now it's to the place where there's hardly any young people going to church thank god for the young people we have here i'll tell you this because i i i have to i have mentioned and talked to even even do message believers message preachers and they have they oh yeah you know what you know one thing strikes them here is the young people is you young brothers and sisters men yeah and they have mentioned to me they said oh brother this is amazing because he said i i've been to messy churches and you know here and there and here and there and there and there and he said there's hardly any young people now they go to church so i thank god for the anointing that all praise the lord hallelujah for the anointing on our young people to bring the peace keep them coming to church amen i thank god for the anointing that i that i see when i when i've been sitting here and brother jonathan we're going to minister amen and i see our young brothers and sisters raising their hands praising the lord amen worshiping amen i pray god continue to control you yes sir i pray the holy ghost continue to have control in your heart and in your soul amen whoa praise the lord amen oh and uh sometimes yes i know that uh as i i said it years ago and i i tell the moms and dads there now i said don't forget i said what i told your mother and father about years ago amen because they used to i remember some of you parents young parents amen and back then and you sit in the church and you lie down next to your father and you go to sleep and then you lie down maybe someone on the on the floor and go to sleep and i said listen i said they're watching tv i said they wouldn't go to sleep and i said if they're home watching tv they wouldn't do this and they wouldn't do that and so on and so i said please i said put them on their guard i said if they want to go to sleep them i said i got no no nothing against if they want to sit next to you and go to sleep but i said don't let them lie down amen amen i should never stay set up amen oh yeah and and and uh well they're grandmothers and grandmas and grandpa's here now but amen they put that emphasis on their children back then amen amen because i remember brother back in pentecost i remember back in the old fashioned salvation army amen we went to church with moms and dads well we just sat in the seats and that was it amen and the service went on oh no nobody was bothered to all lie down or slave you were dead no back then and maybe even some of them maybe they they weren't considered christian or whatever but they just knew they were in church and they wanted to respect god they want to respect mom and dad and so on amen so brother i pray grace that mom and dad now is going to put that for that that anointing amen on their their sons and daughters at home amen by the grace of almighty god oh brother what a world we're living in brother the world's changed but don't let us change jesus is the same yesterday today forever the bride is the same yesterday

give the glory to jesus amen and tell of his love by the grace of almighty god amen so is jesus having preeminence in your life is jesus having preeminence in your home is jesus having preeminence in your job by the grace of god amen brother grace that when we're not religious we're not denominational oh yeah i'm going to go to church so i go to this church because we believe this i go to that church because we believe that no amen it's the holy ghost in you and you're there to worship jesus you're there to worship god you're there to come and worship and thank you jesus for what you've done thank you jesus for what you're doing amen lord we're still looking for the resurrection lord we're still giving the rapture amen we want to be with you lord oh my my my god give us that anger and that thirst morning noon and night amen let's give the glory to jesus amen end time evangelism brother by the grace of god is keeping us more and more and more under the anointing of what god is doing amen not brother there is a generation there there are those are there in evangelism they're going out there to get more believers in get believers in get believers in no anytime evangelism is get believers ready amen amen to go oh brother it's not getting you in getting you ready to go by the grace of god because there comes a time when god stops bringing them in when the last one is in that's right and brother when they're in what a guy got to do you got to get you ready to go are you ready to go amen do you want now to step from time to eternity amen do you want now to get out of

what god's revealing to us amen oh my brother more and more that god reveals is to give us a greater and greater revelation of who we are and why we're here and what god's doing through us and what god wants in us amen please in the name of jesus make your calling and your election sure just think bear with me they want to know lord when is this going to happen concerning the temple in jerusalem and when what about design of your coming and of the end of the world and so on and jesus answered and said unto them take heed oh be on your guard why oh if we're looking for the kind of the lord lord oh praise the lord we don't have to be that's serious we just praise the lord amen thank you jesus he said take heed and be and that no man deceive you what oh yeah they're gonna they'll preach the message in such a way that oh yeah it'll deceive this one deceive that one they'll add a word here take away word there god help us amen jesus is warning us jesus is warning the bride he said take heed that no man deceive you for many listen many shall come in my name brother i'm not worried about denominations out there i'm not worried about this called that law and that called that cult no no the deception brother is not going to be out there but god has brought us away separated from that oh no and the devil is going to be right with us amen in the message oh yeah he when it comes to the days of abel and cain the devil knew the word they had god said amen the devil knew the word the devil knows the word amen anyone that recognizes what god has done and what god's doing is satan anyone recognizing what god's going to do it's the devil why because the bible says the devil has come down with great wrath why knowing his time is short he knows his time is short how do you know that he know that by what god has done and for what god's doing do you know do you know your time is short when it comes to time amen amen brother if the ministry of the hour signifies anything it's the end of time amen the bride's going from time to eternity amen grace amen so brother sister god help us take heed that no man deceive you amen oh brother but we're believing the message oh yeah but there's a lot of deception around the message yes indeed amen brother so you better be on your guard just to say oh i believe the message so does the devil oh yeah satan does oh yes he knows that's why he knows this time short amen but do we know what effect does the message have on us look at the fact that that on the devil come on put it put satan on his guard was satan on his toes oh can he oh my it's over i better move quickly because my time is short oh so brother i trust that we we we've got a greater revelation than the devil amen brother for he said many shall come in my name many many in his name saying i am christ i am the anointed one and shall deceive many amen amen and that's not just out there in denominations there's going to be around the message oh yeah god help us and he said now you're going to hear this this and this and this and he said listen there shall arise false christ and the power of god said oh is there a false christ he said it's not a false anointing it's a false teaching he said the audience is true anointing but he said they're going to add to the word and take away from the word amen so there shall arise false christ oh yes even around the message false annoying ones oh they're preaching the message yeah you better make sure it is exactly what the prophet said don't head to it don't take from it father god said he said leave it the way it is he said don't add to it don't take from it amen amen sweezer there will arise false christs amen just think false almighty ones they're anointed he said true anointing but deliver false teaching god help us and false prophets prophets are they prophets if they're they've got a false teaching oh yeah because even even the prophets are going to add to the word take away from the word and oh yeah this is oh i asked the lord this and i can't i won't express this to you i said lord you said right there you said they shall show great signs and great wonders in so much that ever were possible they shall deceive the very elect what lord what signs and wonders are they going to perform what signs and wonders are they going to show that it were possible they would deceive the elect brother's pretty that's pretty deceptive we better be on our guard we better be on our toes amen because brother it's not what's out there is going to deceive us it's what's going on in around the message amen amen they're going to add to the word add to the message take away from the message say it's this say it's that and so brother be on your guard stay as the proud of god said leave it the way it is amen brother what has god done and what is god doing what was the significance of the prophetic ministry for running the second coming of christ to bring the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride together amen yes sir grace oh brother there's something else i could tell you but i won't say it right now but i am encouraging you beyond your guard amen because the bible says they shall show great signs i said lord great signs and wonders and i said that if it were possible they would deceive the very leg and so one morning just this past week i would i walk around five or six o'clock in the morning i was thinking lord i said what is it how can they do that how can they do this and i said that it were possible to see the very elect and the lord says son they're going to do this oh oh that yes he said son oh i said yes i see it i know that you're doing it god help us god help us there's many there's many ministries out there professing the message but they're deceivers keep your be on your toes be on your guard oh i like this one i like that one make your calling an election sure amen brother just think again like i said the lord has revealed to me i was wondering i said lord all these false christs and the prophet of god did say they got the right anointing false teachings and he said false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders this is amazing what i said great signs and wonders that if it were possible they should deceive the very leg they're doing this around the message that's right amen it's not out there it we got to deal with it around the message satan has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short so i tell you this one of the biggest preachers of the message is the devil always he's anointed this one to preach the message not only that when he preached the message and he oh yeah but he's going to all 99.9 right and then that point one percent whatever you you change there change the area or you'll put the answers on this but not on that not denying it but he won't put the emphasis on it brother what does god want us to put the emphasis on that's what the ministry is supposed to do sort of put you on your guard so i said lord this is this is amazing i said i pray in the name of jesus give them the revelation they need amen so that they're going to recognize these great signs and these wonders that these preachers these preachers are doing see what it well what is it brother i'll tell you this the word is god hidden and god revealed in simplicity don't add to it don't take from it leave it the way it is amen brother are you content with god in simplicity in the ministry amen god help us their brother that end time evangelism is there to deceive us yet they're going to preach the message and and they might change it a little here or not not change it at all but not put the emphasis on this they won't put the emphasis on that they're just putting emphasis on this here and they say oh yeah that's the message that's the message yeah but that's not giving you the faith that god wants in you that's not giving you the faith for the resurrection that's not giving you the faith for the rapture no no that's all that's all right this is all right that's all right yeah god help us brother brown said after the opening seals he was wondering lord what have i got to do now he preached this message that message said now that's another revelation of the seals that's another revelation of the seals and then it was finished and what did he say he said here i go he said back into evangelism that's right amen brother the evangelism for us is getting their bride ready for the rapture amen is to emphasize what god has given us through the ministry of the prophet to give us rapturing faith get out of here that's what god wants us to do get out of here lord you want us to leave yes i want you to leave how are we going to leave well he said i've given you i've given you the word to give you the faith to focus on leaving to focus on resurrection focus on the rapture by the grace of god listen sufficient has been said to help us distinguish between beginning evangelism middle of the day evangelism and end time evangelism amen back then with the beginning evangelism then there was the middle of the day evangelism down through the church ages now it's endtime evangelism it's not just to get out there and get people to believe the message get people believe the message no no it's getting the bride ready for the rapture to get out of here amen it has progressed from prophets into the god prophet for the redemption of our souls and since the day of pentecost it has progressed from god prophet to the church age messengers forming into the body of the word bride amen for the redemption of our bodies praise the lord remember was the alpha redemption of our physical redemption of our souls now is jesus in the bride redeeming our bodies praise the lord yes sir amen and this isn't my idea this is the pattern of the bible this is the teaching of the prophet of malachi 4 especially in his messages on end time evangelism and the evening messenger the recognizing your day and its message amen and he preached on what is the attraction on the mountain that's right amen it's not just recognizing god did this god did this god did that amen is recognizing what god has revealed and why he has revealed it what is god doing amen brother do we recognize the day we're living do we recognize the message to give us rapturing faith amen what is the attraction on the mountain what is spiritual food in due season amen amen to give us rapturing faith praise the lord amen it's hard to get the people to change from the old expectations to the new expectations and we're not ordained to have lutheran methodist pentecostal expectations brother god has given us bright expectations amen the lutherans look for this the methodists look for that the pentecostal look for that but the bride is looking for this amen amen brother to the lutherans jesus was their justifier and to the others he was their sanctifier he was the baptizer with the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but to the bride he's the resurrection and the rapture amen they wanted god to do this they said thank you lord thank you thank you thank you for what you did now brother are we thanking god for the resurrection and the rapture amen amen and really believe that we're living in the hour of that physical resurrection and that physical rapture yes sir amen amen what is your expectation what are you looking for morning noon and night amen come to the end of the day still looking for it rise in the morning still looking for it still praying grace for the resurrection grace lord for the rapture lord we can't wait lord to get to get back in fellowship with the saints that are going on as the power of god beyond the curtain of time amen when he went beyond the curtain of time he saw these believers fellowshipping there these believers there these believers there amen and then down the other way it was the believers that oh yeah believe the message of the hour yeah and again like i said probably god the angel highlighted that one woman there she was you look young and the father god and the angel says brother branham see that woman you didn't know her he said oh the angel said she was 95 years old when you let her to the lord 95 years old and she's just a young woman yeah you want to know what they're going to look like i don't think you're going to see much change in sister selena and sister justine no no and the others here no one must change no you want to know what you look like look in the mirror that's what you're going to look like in eternity amen just maybe two or three years you're older that's all there give you no birthdays but our but our fact the fact we're there is a testimony of our new birth amen brother as the bride we don't come to the table looking for a good meal on justification we're not here to find a good meal on sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and spiritual gifts amen but brother sister we might reach out to get a little handful of that amen i appreciate that and that but because of the type of evangelism we're hearing our expectations are greater amen so you're sitting at the table of god oh thank you lord justification thank you that was good tastes good sanctification tastes good gifts of the spirit oh wonderful lord praise the lord oh but now he's going to service resurrection rapturing faith wonderful brother sisters our expectations center on nothing less than the second coming of our lord jesus christ and our union with him the resurrection of the dead and the rapture of the living saints if we fail to focus on the mystery of these revelations then we're not hearing the voice of evening time evangelism if we're really hearing the evening time evangelism in the message the word of the hour amen we are focusing on the resurrection and the rapture thank god for luther thank god for the others well thank god for william branham amen remember it is written unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto full salvation with full salvation the redemption of our souls and the redemption of our bodies amen but what you got to be looking for if you're not looking for him you're not expecting it you're not going to experience it amen but if you're baptized with the holy ghost and the life of christ is in you amen you're looking for the resurrection looking for the rabbis you're expecting it lord you said this you promised this you promised that amen lord we're still looking for it amen amen amen he will appear the second time without sin unto salvation that's a promise he will with full salvation soul and body appear to those who are eagerly and constantly looking for him amen how do we look for him to appear we look in the word and watch as god interprets the promise of his appearing and coming by bringing it to pass in our day the days of the voice of the seventh angel declares is appearing and is coming for the bride anything that the problem of god was putting the emphasis on was the second coming of christ for the bride and the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen again it is written that the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready and before she can make herself ready she's got to recognize by the scriptures that she's the bride spoken of in the scriptures amen evening time evangelism is showing the bride who she is amen you are the bride of the lord jesus christ you are making yourself ready by time lining up with the word amen and you are personally uniting in an intimate relationship with jesus you are looking with great expectation to gather with the saints of all ages for the marriage supper of the lamb amen you are living for jesus you are living for our lord jesus christ not your wife not your husband not your children not your job you're living for jesus amen so brother put the empty oh well the lord needs lord wants us to look after our wives our husbands our families yes but to to look after them right you got to look after jesus first give jesus preeminence amen we are living in a changing time and more so now than it was 40 years ago in 1962 the prophet said he said in malachi of the third chapter of the first verse six verse he said i want to take a reading for i am the lord i change not i want to take a little subject he said it would be pleasing to the lord he said the unchangeable god works in an unexpected way and he says we are living in a changing time everything is changing that's true and it's just everything that you can look and see with your eyes come out of the earth and it's material and it starts changing amen and he said now he said now he said that this place he's a phoenix has changed and it goes to show that it goes right with the times it changes just as time changes amen other places are changing he says so the roads has changed the city's changed politics change he said they are constantly changing year after year he said politics changed nations change and he said that he said year by year and he said there they they changed their attitude and they changed their program he said it's got so that people today are not friendly like they used to be and that's true he said i don't know whether you noticed it or not but he said we noticed it back he sit in the south and cast and he said people are changing year by year and he said there's too much of a hurry where they're going naturally but not spiritually the more caught up we're going here going there doing this doing that but what about spiritual god help us amen and he said you notice most of the women today they have washing machines they have electrical irons and push-button dishwashers and everything like that and yet they got less time to pray than they ever had but things are changing and we could go a little further issa to the people and to bring it in the church he said the church is changing yeah the atmosphere in churches today is not like it was back years ago they're religious but not spiritual god help us to be spiritual amen whether you're coming to hear brother journal come in here brother jonathan oh be spiritual not to hear me brother jonathan oh yes they hear jesus lord what are you what are you going to say to us through our brothers today lord what did you want me to hear today please in the name of jesus anoint anoint the brother to say what you want me to hear amen anoint the brother to say what we need amen in 1965 in the message called leadership he said i have a message i feel from god and he said i don't mean to be different but he said it's just that i'm living in a changing time and as long as you're building the wall one straight way it's all fine and bricklayers can go right down the road but he said when you have to turn the corner and he said we're not building a wall we're building a house amen so he said these turns has to come amen not just a wall we're building a house so these turns have to come in your life in my life in the brother the sister amen oh yeah oh we got the message so that's it we don't have to worry and that's why a lot of a lot of so-called believers don't even go to church oh they just say oh i'll just listen to the prophet on tape yes but the prophet on tape said amen he says you young brothers new young ministers he's ordained to take this message on to the coming of the lord amen so brother you can't just stay at home and listen to a tape amen brother you've got to come and hear the word amen hear god ministering the word what was on the tape that's right amen that's right and not only that the prophet god said you were going to go deeper oh yeah he said that and and he said you're going to see things that even he didn't see he said and he said oh yeah he said i know you don't see this he said because i don't see it yeah he said that amen but he's coming to minister he's going to bring it out bring it out bring it out bring it out amen the things that the prophet didn't see but again he knew what was coming amen and god in the last days in the ministry of the year of the ministry the the younger preachers back then coming up they're going to give the revelation that you need to give you the faith that god's looking for amen and there's any faith that god's looking for now it's not just faith that oh god a set of prophet god's not a prophet no it's the faith for the resurrection looking for the faith of the rapture now to get out of here amen so he said turn these corners so it's hard to turn corners yeah people just want to go on and say god said a prophet god's underground wait wait turn the corner why did you send the prophet turn the corner what was it there for you what's there for you turn the corner amen he said it's the in the temporal realm everything changes but he said in the spiritual realm the bride has changed from the church age to the bright age amen hallelujah and in this bright age under evening time evangelism by the prophet of the faithful ministry the bride is receiving the change of our physical body the old is giving way to the new amen the change that took place in the prophet on the platform is the change that's taking place in the bride amen amen in the message patriarch 1964. he said if we can just relax be settled and sure in this revelation believing with all of our hearts that it is the absolute truth that we can just rest like ruth knowing that there's a change come coming on she would experience boaz's redemption that's what we want and that's what we need as well as is redemption of our bodies amen we he's redeemed us spiritually but how many are looking for the redemption of your body thank god lord you redeem them spiritually spiritually and in my soul i am redeemed but god is now looking for us to have the faith to redeem our bodies amen believe us thou this oh lord we believe in the resurrection we believe there but he said i am the resurrection again do i like that my brother did email me some scriptures there and it was there where lazarus was in the grave and jesus came oh no he oh and they said lord if you come before you would he wouldn't have died you would have raised him jesus said what he said i am the resurrection yeah and then he went on to the grave of lazarus and and oh yeah his friends were there weeping and mary and martha was weeping and then it says jesus wept and they said jesus went because lazarus was dead no i said no as that wasn't it brother i said jesus went because they were weeping jesus went because of their unbelief jesus went because of their doubt jesus said why he said he said because i am the resurrection amen he told he told martha oh he said he'll rise again oh yes she said he'll rise in the last day yeah no he said i am the resurrection amen why would jesus weep if he was going to raise him from the dead so i said no i said are you weeping because of their unbelief he was weeping because of their doubt amen i said he when it comes to raising lazarus i said he was the resurrection and i said he said lazarus come forth and lazarus that was dead for was it four days came forth amen amen amen brother i pray grace that god's not gonna that we're not gonna cause god to weep because of our unbelief but rejoice because of our faith amen by the grace of god remember the bride cherishes this as luther cherished the revelation of justification wesley sanctification the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit the bride cherishes the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture how many are really really really putting the emphasis on resurrection and rapture how many i really believe what god has done what god's doing god help us amen listen in the end time evangelism the prophet said i was thinking about going into the message but i don't have that time right now i want to turn to our brother joseph eventually to say what he he feels to say but in the message end time evangelism on page eight the prophet said now he said we are thinking of evangelism at the end time and anyone can read a newspaper and see the conditions of the nation realize that something is fixing to happen and when you see one with a chip on his shoulder and them arguing with all kinds of weapons and so forth to fight with and he's in kicking off their shoes beating desks and everything he said you know something is fixing to happen and he said that brings upon the people it's a kind of a feeling that something is fixing to happen the world as we would call it cosmos the outside world feels that there is coming destruction amen say like an atomic age is fixing the blast forth and the christians knows it's the coming of the lord and he said see there's an atmosphere and it depends on what you're looking at for our lord has strictly told us just what was going to happen at that time and we don't know the middle of the hour but we know we are nearing something now amen definitely and he said we know redemption is nigh and something is fixing to take place the world doesn't see that that's true but the bride sees it he said they laugh at it because they did it in other days but we know that it's coming near and that's the reason i chose this subject today amen end time evangelism he chose that to preach on to show that the emphasis is put on the resurrection and the rapture is not getting people to come and just be christians come in and be and receive christ come and do this come on that no it's to recognize the hour for the resurrection the rapture brother now is to leave and be with jesus grace the prophet was commissioned to get a bride ready and he don't want us to miss what's happening and like ruth we have to go beyond just coming into the land we have to find boaz in the field lay at his feet and pull the battle of his word and shekinah glory over us amen the grace of god recognize who he is and our need for him by the grace of god end time evangelism is bringing the bride into a greater and greater awareness of what he has done and what he is doing amen praise the lord that we are experiencing amen the resurrection and the rapture god bless you we have to turn to our brother joseph let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe amen and be in prayer as i said that myself such a baby leaving on wednesday for a few days and we'll leave it turn the pulpit back to our brother joseph or brother jonathan rather not joshua he can have it for a few minutes he said amen to talk about kobe 19 i think and our brother jonathan is going to talk with the word of god amen so the lord bless us amen let's sing it and our brother joseph only believed [Music] yes amen only believe praise the name of the lord hallelujah thank you jesus thank you hallelujah [Music] all things are possible oh let's believe jesus is here jesus said brother joseph amen [Music] amen [Music] amen praise the lord hallelujah [Music] is here all things are possible jesus [Music] you can be seated real quick it won't be long so i just felt uh paul and i paul's not here today but um just some conversation between myself and and by the john and him uh just felt like it was a good time to just to have a quick update on on cover 19. uh unfortunately it's still with us and um you know for example as you know i believe it was yesterday um they they put the mask mandate in place um so it's one of the things that we uh emailed the church about yesterday which i'm sure you all saw but we're kind of taking a step back now again uh asking that uh we refrain from handshakes and hugs and that sort of thing outside okay we're just going to go back to that and hopefully you know the mask mandate will be lifted again soon and we can go back to uh that being okay so um the other thing i just wanted to uh just talk about real quick is that um because of the vaccine and uh you know different countries and provinces opening up we're now able to travel with a bit more freedom and so uh you know some some families have been traveling uh others have plans for example my in-laws are planning to come october 10th and they're going to be here for i believe five weeks um four or five weeks um bichol is is planning to travel to india at the end of the month maybe there's other travel plans i'm not sure but with that we just felt like it's important to um just talk about that real quick um if you are planning to travel we ask that you let myself or paul know uh just your your travel dates okay uh just so we know who's coming and going and the reason for that is we just want to make sure that when folks return that we know when they're coming back and paul or myself would be following up uh with anyone who travels like yourself i shall when when you get back just to talk about okay what what are the quarantine requirements now uh for you uh when do you expect to be back in church um any of those details like that i think it's important that that we have that conversation and uh that we're not we're not here to uh enforce uh a quarantine uh we're not quarantining experts uh if anything uh the details it seems of of what's required and what's not required at a macro level seems to be saying relatively the same for the province you know 14 days and all those things but the details of that i'm learning are are seem to be evolving and and that conversation with an individual or family is i think is really important uh just so we can get educated myself and paul on kind of what what you've been told um and so we know what to expect and ultimately our goal there is not to get into your business obviously it's it's really just about the church here and uh so that everyone here can be comfortable coming to church and knowing that for example if i shall use your voice as example but if he goes to india comes back and a week later he's sitting in church i just want everyone to be comfortable to know that if he's here it's because he's spoken with the deacons and he's allowed to be here and he's followed all the rules and and no one needs to be concerned okay in that regard the reason i'm i'm bringing this up is like there there hasn't been anything done wrong okay um it's really if i'm being honest um the fact that uh we the deacons didn't have this thought through uh in the last few weeks is is really why i'm up here um there was some some confusion that was created with the colombo family um because we didn't have this in place and i take responsibility for that okay and i've been talking with the family about that so i just want to make that clear that that's why i'm up here is really it's it's on us and to make it clear going forward as best we can just looking through my notes here yeah the last thing is just with with this you know brother john um i believe has been through one or two quarantinings i think uh so far and uh i just want everybody to know that we really are doing our best to be impartial to the objective uh to treat every individual every family the same uh when it comes to holding them to the health orders of the day okay uh the guidelines are we've said from the beginning as a church there's orders there's guidelines we kind of put those in two different categories the health orders are the health orders um even if they seem foolish even if we think there's a very low probability of kova being spread among us because of our unique you know social uh activity and our kind of close circle all of that is a material it it's really just when it comes to health orders we are going to um try to adhere to them as best we can as a church and just know that we we are really you know there isn't uh individual treatment going on it's it's uh we're being as as impartial as we can be and uh and just really just taking the lead of the province uh of the in terms of their guidelines the the orders uh that they've set out we're just going to line up with those as best we can um you know for the duration of this so is there any questions about any of that so would it be easy to say that if you have traveled you should not come back to church yes yeah yeah and if you you know you don't want to tell us you're leaving that's fine it's more so when you come back you know that that's it's not important that we know you're you're gone as such it's more so when you return just to let us know you know before before you come back to church uh we'd really appreciate that um if for some reason that doesn't happen it'll just end up being a conversation uh in the parking lot you know to to understand uh what's happening which which we would like to avoid that i think that would be uncomfortable any other questions okay brother bob thank you what can i stand if i could just add one thing it's it's nice to know if you are going and it's a little bit self-serving on my part but uh i would put you on the prayer request list until you come back and then everybody will know and everybody will be praying for you while you're while you go because
