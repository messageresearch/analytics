[45:37] the Lord
[45:38] tonight praise God I'm truly indeed
[45:41] happy you know to be standing another
[45:44] time I'm humbled to be standing before
[45:47] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and you
[45:50] know I thank brother John for you know
[45:54] for the confidence that he has in me you
[45:57] know to have me here standing amen
[46:00] praise God I feel happy you know to
[46:02] serve the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[46:05] praise God so I would like to continue
[46:09] the thought that we were
[46:12] on
[46:14] tonight and I ask for you just continue
[46:17] to pray for me as we go through it
[46:21] amen hallelujah we'll be reading from
[46:24] the our Bibles from Hebrews chapter 9
[46:28] verse
[46:35] 13 and it read
[46:39] thus for if the blood of bulls and of
[46:43] goats and the ashes of efor sprinkling
[46:46] the
[46:47] unclean sanctifies to the purifying of
[46:50] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[46:54] of Christ who through the eternal Spirit
[46:57] offer himself without spot to God Purge
[47:01] your conscience from dead Works to serve
[47:06] the Living God and so tonight we like to
[47:10] look on the purging of our
[47:14] conscience uh that's the a part that I
[47:19] had intentionally wanted to bring across
[47:21] so I think we can get to the main topic
[47:24] tonight amen amen you may be
[47:28] seated amen praise God so the last time
[47:32] we were talking about
[47:34] this and we say that you know to bring
[47:39] the bride into her Perfection
[47:42] really it will take God on the scene to
[47:46] bring us to
[47:49] Perfection it will take him on the scene
[47:52] you know to take us into that stage of
[47:55] perfection really
[47:57] and we see also and that's a wonderful
[48:00] thing church because he didn't entrust
[48:03] that with anything else but himself in
[48:07] other word we are in safe hands because
[48:09] we are trusting the mighty hands of
[48:12] God and so we also see Jesus you know
[48:16] that abam spoke of you know his ministry
[48:20] having three p we find that in St John
[48:24] 5: 19 you know before before he bring
[48:28] the turple that turple is God himself
[48:32] coming on the scene amen you know he he
[48:36] he he wanted his disciples to understand
[48:38] that it wasn't him Jesus that was doing
[48:42] the work it was his father which was God
[48:46] himself that was dwelling inside of him
[48:49] it was God himself that was doing the
[48:51] work so in other word he took it off
[48:54] completely off his Humanity
[48:57] Hallelujah which is very important to
[48:59] understanding because we cannot do this
[49:01] by ourself in our Humanity we have to
[49:04] depend on God and so he knows that
[49:07] church he knows that we can't do it by
[49:10] ourself and so it takes the mighty hands
[49:13] of God really Amen to bring forth a
[49:16] Total Restoration of all things and so
[49:19] in s John 5 and verse 19 he says then
[49:23] answered Jesus and said unto them ver
[49:26] verely I say unto you the son can do
[49:30] nothing of himself but what he said the
[49:33] father doeth for what things soever he
[49:35] doth these things also doth the son
[49:39] likewise Hallelujah so J Jesus took it
[49:42] completely off himself and say
[49:44] hallelujah the father that dwelleth in
[49:47] me he's the one that is doing the work
[49:49] Hallelujah so just before he bring in
[49:52] that Temple as we mentioned earlier
[49:55] which was his Ministry you see brother
[49:58] Bram spoke of the ministry of Christ and
[50:00] he he said that e Ministry has three
[50:03] poles really you know and the first pull
[50:07] the second pull and the third pole and
[50:09] you know we see that under the first
[50:12] pull really it was the works of God it
[50:15] was the works of the Holy Spirit
[50:18] Hallelujah and we saw great works that
[50:20] was done under the first pool we see
[50:23] under the second we see great works I
[50:25] used to God what are you you saying what
[50:27] where are you going with all of this
[50:28] because of what Paul said Hallelujah in
[50:31] Hebrews 9 and verse4 he said H that your
[50:35] consciences will be purged from dead
[50:38] Works to serve the Living God so the
[50:42] works Hallelujah under the first poll
[50:45] did not bring Perfection it could not
[50:47] bring Perfection Church Hallelujah we
[50:49] saw the and there were Mighty works
[50:51] really you know we see dead raised we
[50:54] saw great healing Revival in all of
[50:57] H but it could not bring the Perfection
[51:00] Hallelujah and so to bring the
[51:01] Perfection it took God himself on the
[51:05] seene hallelujah praise God to do what
[51:08] to do the works of perfection in other
[51:11] word it's going to it have to come a
[51:14] time when God himself comes on the scene
[51:16] again in this day to do the works of
[51:19] perfection in his
[51:21] bride Hallelujah and so what he did
[51:24] there he was telling them that it was
[51:26] his father father that will come on the
[51:28] scene and his father will do the works
[51:32] Hallelujah and so you know but explain
[51:35] the the tree pools and all of that
[51:38] Hallelujah and we saw all the good works
[51:39] that was done hallelujah but we saw also
[51:43] that you know as we mentioned earlier in
[51:45] St John 14 and verse uh St John 9 and
[51:48] verse1 14 it said how much more shall
[51:51] the blood of Christ to the eternal
[51:54] spirit offer himself without spot God H
[51:57] to purge your conscience from dead Works
[52:00] to serve the Living God so to bring this
[52:04] work it's God and the scene again
[52:08] hallelujah praise God are you there with
[52:11] me church
[52:14] amen so your conscience have to be
[52:18] purged in other words our conscience as
[52:22] you know I think the first service I did
[52:24] mention it but it's
[52:27] it correlates with your soul in other
[52:30] words how do I know if your soul is made
[52:33] alive is when your conscience is
[52:35] awaiting to the righteousness of God by
[52:38] the word and so if your conscience is
[52:41] alive to God it will produce the works
[52:44] of God it's not just a fabrication of or
[52:49] of or something that someone Force upon
[52:51] you are you coming in and you take on
[52:53] the spirit of the church or the spirit
[52:55] of an EnV enironment but it is God in
[52:58] your soul operating God bringing forth a
[53:02] life conscience Hallelujah making the
[53:05] world know but the reason why you're
[53:07] dressed the way you dress because Christ
[53:09] is alive and so Christ in your house is
[53:13] expressing himself your conscience is
[53:15] bearing record that Christ is living in
[53:18] your
[53:19] house and because he's living there is
[53:22] showing that you are you are being made
[53:24] alive from dead works to serve the
[53:27] Living God so it takes him in your in
[53:30] your soul really to bring that
[53:32] conscience to life to produce that work
[53:35] it takes Christ on the inside and Paul
[53:38] said it's Christ in us the hope of glory
[53:42] so when the anointing come Hallelujah
[53:46] I'm it's not an anointing to anoint your
[53:49] flesh to produce the works of God no sir
[53:52] it's a it's an anointing upon your
[53:54] spirit but God comes on the scene to
[53:57] anoint your soul to bring your soul
[54:00] alive H to produce the perfect work of
[54:04] God hallelujah praise God and in other
[54:07] words church it's not a pressure to be a
[54:09] Christian it's not a hard thing really
[54:12] it's a surrendered heart but God can
[54:14] have his own
[54:15] way hallelujah praise
[54:18] God so so the the anointing we say it
[54:22] was meant to purge our soul you know to
[54:26] to bring it alive to the things of God
[54:29] you know we saw also in St John 14 you
[54:33] and verse you know 10 the Bible
[54:36] said believe thou not that I am in the
[54:41] father and the father in me the words
[54:44] that I speak unto you I speak not of
[54:47] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[54:50] me he doeth The Works believe me that I
[54:53] am in the father and the father in me or
[54:57] HSE believe me for the very Works sake
[55:00] verely verely I say unto you he that
[55:03] believe on me the works that I do he
[55:07] shall do it also Hallelujah if that same
[55:10] spirit that Rose Christ from the dead if
[55:14] he's dwelling inside of us tonight he
[55:16] will produce the same works you see
[55:19] today the the concept of work is when
[55:22] you get into that spiritual mode and
[55:24] someone can identify work works by
[55:27] spiritualism but this work is a work by
[55:30] faith it's a work of accepting Christ in
[55:32] your heart and allow Christ from the
[55:34] heart to express thems so the life you
[55:37] live the way you conduct yourself the
[55:40] way you speak your Association where you
[55:42] go your acquaintances is based on the
[55:45] Christ that is living on the
[55:47] inside hallelujah praise God that's the
[55:51] work we are speaking of so Jesus was
[55:54] saying that it was the father Hallelujah
[55:57] that was on the scene Hallelujah even
[56:00] was the one that was doing the work
[56:03] through
[56:04] him and it wasn't dead works it was
[56:07] living Works hallelujah praise
[56:11] God St John
[56:13] 6 have we turn
[56:17] there so we see in St John 6 when God
[56:21] was getting ready for that move God was
[56:25] getting ready
[56:26] for Perfection to get his church into a
[56:30] position where God can produce that work
[56:32] because remember no church except that
[56:35] work is except that work being produced
[56:39] Hallelujah then we cannot enter into the
[56:41] Perfection State and so when he comes
[56:44] when we saw in St John 6 he came on the
[56:47] scene and when he came on the scene on
[56:50] St John 6 in St John 6 he was getting
[56:53] ready to do something Hallelujah not
[56:55] just to the unbeliever
[56:56] adate believer but he was getting ready
[56:59] to do something for the genuine believer
[57:02] the call out one and so in St John 6 and
[57:05] verse 35 the Bible said and Jesus
[57:07] answered and said unto them I am the
[57:10] bread of life either that cometh to me
[57:13] shall never hunger and he that believeth
[57:16] on me shall never thirst but I say unto
[57:20] you that he also have seen me and
[57:23] believe not all that the father has
[57:27] given me Hallelujah shall come to
[57:30] me and him that come to me I will I will
[57:34] in no wise cast them out verse 38 for
[57:38] I'm come down from heaven not to do my
[57:41] own will Hallelujah but the will of him
[57:45] that sent me let's start at verse 3 a
[57:47] little bit the will of the Father the
[57:51] will of God Jesus said it's not I am not
[57:54] here to do my own will
[57:56] I'm not here in other word hallelujah
[57:59] you put yourself in that same position
[58:01] if Christ is dwelling on the inside
[58:04] tonight it's not your will but it is his
[58:08] will it is not your thought but it's his
[58:11] thought are you there me because now God
[58:15] want to lead his children in a
[58:17] particular direction and so in order to
[58:20] do that he got to take your will out of
[58:22] the picture and he got to put inside of
[58:25] you his will and so when he comes it's
[58:28] not your will anymore it's the will of
[58:31] your
[58:32] father hallelujah praise God so he said
[58:35] I come down from heaven not to do my own
[58:39] will but the will of him that sent me
[58:43] and this is the will and this is the
[58:46] Father's will which he which has let me
[58:50] read that again and this is the Father's
[58:52] will which has sent me and all that he
[58:56] has given me I shall lose nothing but
[59:00] shall raise him up again at the last day
[59:04] and this is the will of him that sent me
[59:07] Hallelujah that everyone which seeth the
[59:10] son and believeth on him may have
[59:14] everlasting life and I will raise him up
[59:18] at the last day Hallelujah in other word
[59:21] what I'm saying to you Church Hallelujah
[59:23] you see the scripture was written before
[59:25] Jes Jesus came the prophets prophesy
[59:28] about him and so he came down to take
[59:32] the will of the father of the word of
[59:34] God and to make every word live to
[59:38] materialize the word hallelujah and in
[59:41] that we find the church in that we find
[59:44] redemption in in that we find Hallelujah
[59:48] him paying the price for Redemption he
[59:51] had to die why because it's he said it's
[59:54] not my will but the will of the father
[59:57] and so that which was on the pages
[1:00:00] Church which was the will of God he came
[1:00:03] to magnify to make the word become alive
[1:00:05] so the works of Jesus was to take the
[1:00:08] word and make the word
[1:00:11] live hallelujah praise God what am I
[1:00:13] going what am I saying to you I I want
[1:00:15] to as as we go we we we break it down
[1:00:18] and you can see exactly Hallelujah the
[1:00:21] works of God is the will of God
[1:00:24] hallelujah it's not just to live a life
[1:00:27] of of of of heartly domain and all of
[1:00:30] this but it's just it's a life uh to
[1:00:32] recognize God's word and to step into
[1:00:35] the word of God and allow that word of
[1:00:37] God to unveil and to manifest from your
[1:00:41] life so if you if you believe God if you
[1:00:45] if you are chosen by God you're chosen
[1:00:48] by God for one purpose the make the word
[1:00:50] of God live in your
[1:00:52] day Hallelujah and so Jesus said The
[1:00:56] Works must be performed again in other
[1:00:58] word the will of the father must be done
[1:01:01] again Hallelujah and so what he did he
[1:01:03] comes he came down on the seal to ensure
[1:01:07] H that this the predestinated seal
[1:01:09] perform the perfect will of God
[1:01:14] hallelujah praise God in verse 40 he
[1:01:17] said and this is the the will of him
[1:01:20] that sent me that everyone that seeth
[1:01:23] the son and believeth on him may have
[1:01:27] everlasting life and high will raise him
[1:01:30] up on the last day praise God
[1:01:36] Amen Hallelujah you see Church the
[1:01:40] spirit of God only operate by the word
[1:01:42] of
[1:01:43] God
[1:01:45] hallelujah we we want to present a God
[1:01:48] that you know like this God we can he
[1:01:52] will he will do exactly any and anything
[1:01:54] no God's spirit works by his word and so
[1:01:59] all that he that was said has to be made
[1:02:03] fulfill and so if we can take over
[1:02:06] thought from just living a life of of of
[1:02:09] of of a moral life but to to keep our
[1:02:12] minds on the perfect will of God the
[1:02:15] perfect word of God and walk in that
[1:02:18] word as a if you can take
[1:02:20] the word and let the word become your
[1:02:22] your daily confession Hallelujah then
[1:02:25] listen Church God by the spirit of God
[1:02:28] we take the word that you're confessing
[1:02:30] providing it's God's word and make that
[1:02:33] word
[1:02:34] live we were told Hallelujah that he's
[1:02:37] going to take us he's going to purge us
[1:02:40] he's going to purge our lives he is
[1:02:42] going to take us out of a life of of of
[1:02:45] works that does that produce God into a
[1:02:48] life that produces God Hallelujah in
[1:02:51] other words Church your lives are under
[1:02:54] prophecy Hallelujah what God say about
[1:02:57] you H if you can believe it and walk
[1:03:00] into it what you're doing you produce
[1:03:02] God on the scene Again by the perfect
[1:03:05] will of
[1:03:06] God hallelujah praise God so the spirit
[1:03:10] of God only
[1:03:12] operate by the word of God the will of
[1:03:15] God is to fulfill the word of God oh my
[1:03:20] amen praise God I like that church
[1:03:23] because the Bible said he was wounded
[1:03:25] for
[1:03:26] transgression he was bruised for our
[1:03:28] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:03:31] was upon him and by his stripe we to
[1:03:35] heal that is his word and so H there got
[1:03:38] to be a bride to produce that it got to
[1:03:42] be a living reality Hallelujah it cannot
[1:03:45] stand the page if you see it as God's
[1:03:47] perfect
[1:03:49] will hallelujah praise God hallelujah so
[1:03:53] we are looking Hallelujah and God
[1:03:56] setting the stage but when he comes on
[1:03:58] the scene he comes Hallelujah to bring
[1:04:02] the believer to his perfect will Hal to
[1:04:06] make your conscience that within your
[1:04:08] soul not just an anointing Hallelujah up
[1:04:11] of of shaking and speaking in tongues
[1:04:13] and all of that but but an anointing of
[1:04:17] believing thus say the Lord hallelujah
[1:04:21] and listen what I'm saying to you and an
[1:04:23] anointing Hallelujah that caus you to
[1:04:25] walk in your daily confession in other
[1:04:27] word if God says so you just keep on
[1:04:30] confessing it and believing it even
[1:04:33] though it's not there in full
[1:04:34] manifestation but as a Believer from
[1:04:37] your heart you know it's God's word and
[1:04:39] you're going to walk in it and believe
[1:04:41] in it
[1:04:42] any hallelujah praise God
[1:04:46] hallelujah and so we find in the book of
[1:04:49] Acts Acts chapter
[1:04:52] 2 Hallelujah
[1:04:55] chapter 2 let me tell brother Mark also
[1:04:59] he gave me some real good
[1:05:03] stuff I actually meant to say that you
[1:05:05] know um uh brother Mark has another son
[1:05:08] from Jamaica I I you don't mind saying
[1:05:12] that
[1:05:13] brother praise God Amen he brother Mark
[1:05:18] is such a wonderful
[1:05:20] person amen so Acts chapter 2 now this
[1:05:25] was
[1:05:26] the day the anointing came not upon the
[1:05:31] flesh not upon the spirit but a new
[1:05:35] birth within the soul but we find
[1:05:39] something happen that Peter May mention
[1:05:42] of that spoke of the Redemption of God
[1:05:47] that will bring us back to the true path
[1:05:50] of eternal life you see when Adam let
[1:05:53] let me before I go to this hold the
[1:05:55] script scure there and let me show you
[1:05:57] exactly where where I'm going with this
[1:05:59] you see it was one word that caused us
[1:06:02] to be where we are Hallelujah and so we
[1:06:06] are we are subjected to a life of sin
[1:06:09] because of one word one word hallelujah
[1:06:13] praise God but now remember when when
[1:06:16] when when man was cast out of the garden
[1:06:20] and the Bible said and God put up CH to
[1:06:23] God the way to the Tree of Life
[1:06:26] listen there is a way back to God
[1:06:30] hallelujah there's a way to access the
[1:06:33] things of God but listen it is guarded
[1:06:37] Hallelujah by what by the the those CH
[1:06:40] beams they accept as God to to to
[1:06:43] prevent Hallelujah us in our sinle
[1:06:46] condition to access that way and so he
[1:06:50] said H in this end time God is going to
[1:06:53] restore the way back to the tree of life
[1:06:57] we are going to get that access to God
[1:07:00] and so Peter on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:03] Hallelujah in verse 22 Peter said he man
[1:07:06] of Israel hear these words Jesus of
[1:07:10] Nazareth and man approve of God among
[1:07:13] you by Miracles and wonders and signs
[1:07:17] which God did by him in the in the midst
[1:07:20] of you as he yourself also know him

[1:13:43] Lord it has to it had got to he said
[1:13:47] what all the years that the Conqueror

[1:14:09] it but I will restore for the root and
[1:14:14] The Offspring of David I will restore
[1:14:16] say the Lord said what it is he said so
[1:14:21] he predestinated it his word let there
[1:14:26] he said therefore look just exactly the
[1:14:29] way he he done it the first time he said
[1:14:32] he took John justification Jesus
[1:14:35] sanctification the church with his own
[1:14:38] blood and then the Holy Ghost come then
[1:14:41] Along come the church he said and it
[1:14:44] begin to grow oh my hallelujah oh church
[1:14:50] I believe that this is the end time I
[1:14:52] know it's the end time Church that God
[1:14:55] has given us a word a predestinated word
[1:14:59] hallelujah to bring this bride to life
[1:15:03] hallelujah praise God Amen and so in in
[1:15:07] in the book uh St John 6 and verse
[1:15:11] 43 the Bible said therefore answered and
[1:15:14] said unto them murm not among yourselves
[1:15:19] no man can come to me except the Father
[1:15:22] which has sent me draw in
[1:15:25] and I will raise him up on the last day
[1:15:28] so it is written in the prophets that
[1:15:31] they shall be all thought of God Heaven
[1:15:33] man therefore that has heard and have
[1:15:36] learned of the father cometh unto me oh
[1:15:39] my it said not not that any man has seen
[1:15:43] the father save he which is of god he
[1:15:46] has seen the father ver ver I say unto
[1:15:49] you he that believeth on me has
[1:15:53] everlasting life and he said and I am
[1:15:58] the bread of
[1:15:59] life they won't
[1:16:02] come unless if you first US you're drawn
[1:16:05] by God there's something I want to say
[1:16:08] to us
[1:16:11] tonight
[1:16:12] the this time is very
[1:16:15] pecul because it's not for everybody but
[1:16:18] I'm said some of the things that you
[1:16:20] hear and you know we hear it so often
[1:16:23] that we take it for granted really
[1:16:25] but some of the things that is that he
[1:16:27] said you know brother John he preached
[1:16:30] you know so so so many times a lot of
[1:16:33] these things really on the outside they
[1:16:36] wish they had somebody who could tell
[1:16:39] them what you're
[1:16:43] hearing I I make it habitual to say to
[1:16:48] them and they just can't
[1:16:52] hear but my one of my favorite vers in
[1:16:55] Revelation 1 and verse3 he said blessed
[1:16:57] is he that readeth and heareth the word
[1:17:01] of this prophecy you know just to be in
[1:17:03] church hearing it you're
[1:17:05] blessed yeah we are blessed to hear and
[1:17:08] and if you can't read it and you can't
[1:17:10] hear it you're
[1:17:11] blessed you know just to hear it right
[1:17:16] so it's not for
[1:17:17] everybody and you know I I probably will
[1:17:20] get you know I I I I know I send the
[1:17:23] link probably to some person I know they
[1:17:24] proba will ask me questions tomorrow
[1:17:27] this is the time of the
[1:17:30] Bride because when he when he comes down
[1:17:33] church he comes to do one thing he comes
[1:17:36] to separate the bride from the church
[1:17:39] what what is what is it what he is he
[1:17:41] using to doing that he's using the very
[1:17:46] word and so when they hear it to some
[1:17:49] it's an hard
[1:17:50] thing it's
[1:17:53] rough but to the
[1:17:56] elected they said to whom shall we
[1:18:00] go for you have Hallelujah the word of
[1:18:03] eternal
[1:18:05] life
[1:18:07] Hallelujah so when the anointing come
[1:18:10] church and I'm zoning into that a little
[1:18:12] bit because I want us to understand that
[1:18:15] this anointing when it comes it comes
[1:18:17] not to allow uh to make us speak in
[1:18:20] tongues and prophesy all of that is an
[1:18:22] attribute or a part of it but the
[1:18:25] anointing comes to wake up the
[1:18:28] soul to let us know that God by the word
[1:18:32] hallelujah is
[1:18:34] alive Hallelujah so under that turple
[1:18:38] anointing when he comes and the SE and
[1:18:42] we know brother bam spoke of that that
[1:18:44] he came Christ the angel the Covenant
[1:18:47] angel had
[1:18:48] descended but when he comes on the seen
[1:18:51] church and he start unveil it what it
[1:18:54] did it separated the
[1:18:57] crowd Hallelujah and only those to whom
[1:19:00] it is it is written will get the
[1:19:03] predestinated
[1:19:05] word that's one of the characteristic
[1:19:08] about this same time that is so
[1:19:11] hard that when God comes know I was
[1:19:14] talking brother Mark the day brother
[1:19:16] Mark was said sister Marina had a family
[1:19:18] for about 300 something like that and
[1:19:21] it's just she alone just one just one in
[1:19:25] my family my family is Big just one my
[1:19:28] wife we have a large family we have a
[1:19:31] large Church community just
[1:19:35] one he comes to separate the house
[1:19:39] mother from father Hallelujah daughter
[1:19:43] from son why because the word the
[1:19:46] revealed word goes in and he
[1:19:50] separate Hallelujah and when he separate
[1:19:53] Hallelujah he pulls out the
[1:19:55] predestinated
[1:19:56] seed those who are destined to hear the
[1:20:00] word of
[1:20:01] God
[1:20:02] hallelujah why is he doing that church
[1:20:05] because brother bam said because the
[1:20:08] bride in this end time got to be
[1:20:12] identified Hallelujah the church has
[1:20:15] their identity but the bride got to be
[1:20:18] identified brother bam said in the face
[1:20:21] of
[1:20:22] trumpet P 64
[1:20:25] he said what is the true evidence Jesus
[1:20:28] said that you should believe that I am
[1:20:31] he and he isar the word it said go into
[1:20:36] the prophet's chamber you know jumping
[1:20:38] on to paragraph 112 he said and watch
[1:20:42] them seven steps that where did where
[1:20:45] did the god meet the challenge to bring
[1:20:47] the commer into the presence of the king
[1:20:50] he said at the top of the step he said
[1:20:53] was in the seventh step there he show
[1:20:57] that we got to come again with that same
[1:21:01] spirit that was on John to introduce the
[1:21:05] Messiah he said he was greater than all
[1:21:08] the prophets he introduced it and he
[1:21:11] said and he got to and we have got to
[1:21:15] come to a place again to something got
[1:21:18] to introduce the
[1:21:21] Messiah he said now
[1:21:25] how shall we oh shallot he shall appear
[1:21:28] in the last day is to bring the people
[1:21:31] back to the world so that the bride will
[1:21:35] know her
[1:21:36] husband he said to know her mate the
[1:21:40] reveal word he said why this has to
[1:21:43] happen he
[1:21:44] said going on to paragraph uh 114 he
[1:21:48] said it it wasn't in the reformer it
[1:21:51] wasn't in Luther Wesley and the
[1:21:53] Pentecost p Castor and then the
[1:21:56] scripture said it wasn't it said but it
[1:21:58] will come
[1:22:00] that that is is promise for this age we
[1:22:05] are living in the age of his coming will
[1:22:08] be in he said she must be identified in
[1:22:12] him and said any man must be identified
[1:22:15] with her husband for the two are one
[1:22:19] Christ bride has to be identified with
[1:22:23] him for the who are one and he is the
[1:22:27] word not the denomination the word is
[1:22:30] that we are to be Children of the light
[1:22:34] and the light is the word which is made
[1:22:36] manifested for this age said how do we
[1:22:39] know light except it comes from the word
[1:22:42] is it all right the word made flesh is
[1:22:45] the light of the H when and you can see
[1:22:48] it and the Bible says so Hallelujah she
[1:22:52] must be identified
[1:22:55] and so listen Church Hallelujah in the
[1:22:57] midst of all of this in all of this
[1:23:00] chaos in all of this darkness in all of
[1:23:03] this Pentecostal age where where there's
[1:23:05] so much prophet and all of that
[1:23:07] Hallelujah and so much prophesying and
[1:23:09] all of that but God said there got to be
[1:23:12] a bride and she must be identified how
[1:23:16] by the
[1:23:17] word hallelujah so he gave her his word
[1:23:23] when when he comes to her he comes to
[1:23:27] her in the secret of theah to do what to
[1:23:30] put in her his word and so Hallelujah
[1:23:33] and so she and him become one by the
[1:23:37] word hallelujah and so we saw the in in
[1:23:40] in Jesus time he fulfilled the word
[1:23:42] concerning his day what about our day
[1:23:45] church we are called to make the word
[1:23:48] live and to produce God again Hallelujah
[1:23:52] behind skin hallelujah how will that be
[1:23:55] done it will be done by the word by the
[1:23:59] scripture she hears the word because he
[1:24:02] is the
[1:24:04] word hallelujah praise God and so church
[1:24:07] this is a season of
[1:24:10] identification all are being identified
[1:24:13] with their se but the bride is
[1:24:15] identified with the word of God
[1:24:18] hallelujah praise God
[1:24:21] hallelujah and so the word through her
[1:24:24] must produce the perfect work of God our
[1:24:27] conscience must produce H the perfect
[1:24:30] work of God by the word Hal and it takes
[1:24:34] God on the scene to do
[1:24:37] that hallelujah praise God Amen brother
[1:24:41] Ram said in the message the Third Exodus
[1:24:45] PRI
[1:24:46] 1963 he said under the organization live
[1:24:50] lously live as a grafted Branch into the
[1:24:53] real Vine of
[1:24:55] Christianity but it's still bearing its
[1:24:59] original Fruit women off dressed men
[1:25:02] intellectual denying the power of the
[1:25:05] spirit but it live under the name of
[1:25:09] Christian Church it's a it's grafted
[1:25:12] Vine but the husband man is coming by
[1:25:15] now to pume the vine oh God he's working
[1:25:19] on me
[1:25:21] church is is work is trans transform the
[1:25:25] man that I am how is he doing that is
[1:25:29] revealing himself to me by the word and
[1:25:32] so when I see that word I take Faith in
[1:25:35] that word believing that that's God's
[1:25:37] word and I believe that I can live it
[1:25:40] how you doing me Church Hallelujah
[1:25:42] probably not in its full manifestation
[1:25:45] but I identify that that's God word and
[1:25:48] if that's God's word it got to be made
[1:25:51] manifested Hallelujah are you there the
[1:25:53] church that's the bride identity is to
[1:25:57] take what he say and believe it and walk
[1:26:00] into it as our daily
[1:26:02] confession believing that it is his
[1:26:06] word hallelujah praise
[1:26:09] God so the fruit Hallelujah from the
[1:26:14] vine
[1:26:15] hallelujah oh the fruit was from you
[1:26:18] know was was to bring uh the life of God
[1:26:21] was to produce that fruit Hal
[1:26:24] by the
[1:26:25] word hallelujah praise God which you
[1:26:29] know it was showing that the soul is
[1:26:31] converted you know the soul has made
[1:26:34] contact with the Eternal the soul is
[1:26:36] made Alive by the scripture hallelujah
[1:26:40] praise God and so he's puning in the
[1:26:43] Lord he's changing he's working on me
[1:26:45] how it it it brings you into situation
[1:26:48] sometimes to see how your faith how
[1:26:51] would you deal with it concerning what
[1:26:53] he say and so sometime in the M sickness
[1:26:55] comes on the picture what do you do do
[1:26:58] you walk away do do you say Lord I
[1:27:01] cannot walk Hallelujah but Peter said
[1:27:03] Hallelujah Lord to whom shall we go when
[1:27:07] situation arises do you mean does that
[1:27:10] mean that I'm not going to go church and
[1:27:12] I'm no you keep on walking because you
[1:27:15] know we we always say this brother John
[1:27:17] like Sunday morning you know we we we we
[1:27:19] decid that I I'm not going to church
[1:27:21] anymore but you know what suay morning
[1:27:24] you know I asked myself the question
[1:27:27] what do I do Sunday morning I used to be
[1:27:30] in church Sunday morning so if I decided
[1:27:32] I'm not no longer going to
[1:27:34] walk my Sunday morning will be
[1:27:37] empty so I have to be here because being
[1:27:41] here it's my fulfill my fulfillment it's
[1:27:44] my joy to be here in the presence of the
[1:27:46] Lord so I can't go anywhere there's
[1:27:49] nowhere else to go this is my joy this
[1:27:52] this is where we sing and we we we dance
[1:27:54] and we we we shout and we say
[1:27:56] hallelujah hallelujah praise
[1:27:59] God Amen praise God but he's working
[1:28:04] he's bringing my faith Hallelujah and
[1:28:07] we're going to look on that a little bit
[1:28:08] tonight to see how he's working on me
[1:28:12] how he's bringing my faith by the
[1:28:14] perfect work Hallelujah into the full
[1:28:18] manifestation of his presence you see we
[1:28:21] are under prophecy church we are called
[1:28:23] to do do something that it it has never
[1:28:26] been done to this magnitude before but
[1:28:29] we are called to do it and God comes on
[1:28:33] the scene and he working behind the
[1:28:37] scene not just an anointing upon the
[1:28:39] flesh or anointing upon the the spirit
[1:28:43] but he's anointing the soul he's
[1:28:45] bringing the soul alive to his word and
[1:28:48] so he brings you in situation sometime
[1:28:51] to see what you will do really accepting
[1:28:54] you believing we you keep on walking no
[1:28:56] matter what let me say this no matter
[1:29:00] what keep your faith in God one of your
[1:29:04] greatest
[1:29:06] achievement is not the big houses is not
[1:29:08] the money in the banket there not
[1:29:09] nothing like but really it is your faith
[1:29:12] in God Hallelujah the greatest
[1:29:16] accomplishment and so we are called to
[1:29:19] to to fulfill that really and so in St
[1:29:21] John 15 and verse 16 the Bible said
[1:29:24] he have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:29:28] you and ordain you that you should go
[1:29:31] and bring forth fruit and that your
[1:29:33] fruit should remain that your fruit
[1:29:37] shall remain in other word hallelujah
[1:29:40] The Works that is produced H remember
[1:29:44] let me take it back again Hallelujah to
[1:29:46] what the Bible said uh Peter 1 Peter one
[1:29:49] the Bible said Hallelujah we are born
[1:29:51] again not by corruptible seed the Bible
[1:29:54] said the grass withth the flower fadeth
[1:29:58] in other word hallelujah only the word
[1:30:00] of God hallelujah last stands
[1:30:04] forever and so everything else fail
[1:30:06] Church everything else will go but only
[1:30:09] the word of God will stand
[1:30:12] forever and so if your fruits are being
[1:30:16] remained it means that H the only thing
[1:30:19] that can remain is the word of God why
[1:30:24] because the word of God is
[1:30:27] eternal Hallelujah and so if you have
[1:30:30] the Eternal Word it means that the
[1:30:33] fruits that produces as a result of that
[1:30:36] Hallelujah of that word inside of you it
[1:30:39] will not diminish or perish but it
[1:30:41] remains Str it lasts forever The Works
[1:30:46] Hallelujah will last forever it will not
[1:30:51] diminish that your fruit should remain
[1:30:54] but whatsoever you ask the father in my
[1:30:56] name Hallelujah he may give it to you
[1:31:01] also jump quickly and this is these are
[1:31:04] like some of my favorite scriptures you
[1:31:06] know Psalms 1 Hallelujah this is brother
[1:31:10] brother you know he spoke of this when
[1:31:13] he and he preached on the restoration of
[1:31:15] the brid
[1:31:16] tree Psalms 1 he said blessed is the man
[1:31:20] that walth not in the Council of the
[1:31:22] ungodly that's standeth in the way of
[1:31:25] The Sinner nor sth in the seat of the
[1:31:28] scornful but his Delight is in the law
[1:31:30] of the Lord and in his law does he
[1:31:33] meditate day and
[1:31:35] night
[1:31:37] hallelujah amen get
[1:31:41] myself
[1:31:43] right he said and he shall be like a
[1:31:46] tree planted by the rivers of water and
[1:31:51] that bring forth his fruit
[1:31:54] Hallelujah in his season Hallelujah
[1:31:57] brother said it's not our fruit but if
[1:32:01] you're planted by the rivers of water if
[1:32:03] Christ is living there he said you're
[1:32:06] going to produce fruit uh but not your
[1:32:08] fruit uh it's not your works but him
[1:32:11] that dwelleth in you and brother said he
[1:32:13] Hallelujah you will produce the works of
[1:32:15] God his works his fruit in his season
[1:32:20] you know brother B went as far as saying
[1:32:22] this I don't have the quote here
[1:32:24] better said that the season when the
[1:32:26] prophet is here in know word there's
[1:32:28] going to come a a time again when the
[1:32:31] perfect fruits of God the perfect work
[1:32:34] of God will be produced again you see
[1:32:37] church we have lived in this Mortal life
[1:32:39] so long we we accept the Mortal
[1:32:42] condition and we believe and we see it
[1:32:44] and we accept it but now in this
[1:32:46] transition God made known to us the
[1:32:49] perfect word and so little by little as
[1:32:52] you hear it bit by bit as you believe it
[1:32:55] we are being changed hallelujah it's
[1:32:58] like you're being resurrected again to
[1:33:00] the word of God and he said hey I didn't
[1:33:03] know I could do this but here am I I'm
[1:33:05] standing here Hallelujah by the grace of
[1:33:08] God are you there my church and you see
[1:33:11] more and more of God it's like you're
[1:33:13] being changed into the image little by
[1:33:16] little the Bible said from Glory unto
[1:33:19] Glory he's changing you what he's doing
[1:33:22] he's working on your faith is changing
[1:33:25] the works by your faith and he's
[1:33:27] bringing your faith into the perfect
[1:33:30] fate of
[1:33:31] God to reflect God again by his perfect
[1:33:35] work by the
[1:33:38] scripture
[1:33:40] Hallelujah B
[1:33:42] said from the
[1:33:44] message uh from that time preached
[1:33:47] 1960 he said and when the church come
[1:33:50] together in the Resurrection The Same
[1:33:52] Spirit
[1:33:54] Hallelujah was in Jesus Christ that was
[1:33:58] torn out of him will come will have to
[1:34:01] be in the church you can't copy anything
[1:34:05] like it you can't make nothing different
[1:34:08] from it it got to be the same holy
[1:34:11] spirit that dwell in Christ and when the
[1:34:14] Rapture comes when the body comes is
[1:34:17] bride he said that was tored from him oh
[1:34:22] the Holy Ghost will bring the the bride
[1:34:25] just exactly D tail right into the body
[1:34:28] of Jesus Christ and said and and can you
[1:34:32] see from the days of Luther to Wesley to
[1:34:36] Pentecost it said and now at the end
[1:34:39] time oh that spirit is shaping up
[1:34:43] Hallelujah it said the same sign and
[1:34:46] wonders that he got on the hurt is being
[1:34:49] done in the church
[1:34:51] today said it's that Covenant that God
[1:34:55] made with Abraham and we are Abraham's
[1:34:58] children being dead in Christ he said we
[1:35:02] take on Abraham's seed and we are here
[1:35:05] according to the promise he said and
[1:35:07] from that time Hallelujah the church had
[1:35:10] a covenant say yes it was a it was
[1:35:15] different Hallelujah now in referencing
[1:35:18] the Covenant brother bam said
[1:35:21] Hallelujah we are a covenanted
[1:35:24] people because God is a covenanted
[1:35:28] God and so the works the promise of
[1:35:34] perfection the promise of God coming and
[1:35:37] living on the inside is by A Perfect
[1:35:40] promise Hallelujah It Is by The Covenant
[1:35:44] that that he gave to Abraham now I like
[1:35:47] to quickly brushing that a little bit
[1:35:49] the Covenant that he gave to Abraham
[1:35:52] because if if it is by the Covenant God
[1:35:55] is bringing Perfection then it means
[1:35:58] that that Covenant got to be perfect
[1:36:01] Hallelujah it got to be a perfect
[1:36:02] Covenant Church so we saw under the
[1:36:05] first we know this under the first
[1:36:07] Covenant when God gave it you know to to
[1:36:10] the the human race Hallelujah God set it
[1:36:13] on a on a condition the condition was
[1:36:16] that if you do this then I will do this
[1:36:18] in other word God was requiring work but
[1:36:22] the work was not the work of God is just
[1:36:24] your work upon your own morality because
[1:36:27] we were made free moral agency but we
[1:36:30] find one thing not no matter what church
[1:36:34] once the works is been done by our
[1:36:37] Humanity it brings
[1:36:39] imperfection are you there me church and
[1:36:42] so God knows that church God knows that
[1:36:45] we can't do it by ourself and so he
[1:36:49] comes to Abraham and gave him a new
[1:36:52] covenant
[1:36:54] and the New Covenant is it's not
[1:36:56] Hallelujah but if you do this and and I
[1:36:59] will do but no no no God said I have
[1:37:02] already done
[1:37:03] it Hallelujah in other word church by
[1:37:06] this New Covenant God take the empasis
[1:37:09] of what you can do for yourself and God
[1:37:12] is saying that I have already done it
[1:37:15] Hallelujah I've already done it for you
[1:37:18] and I'm come down to do it through
[1:37:21] you can I tell you something beautiful
[1:37:23] beautiful tonight and the Bible said and
[1:37:25] The Works were already done before the
[1:37:28] foundation of the
[1:37:29] world before we got here The Works was
[1:37:32] already done there's not there's no new
[1:37:35] works there's nothing there's no
[1:37:37] sickness there's nothing there in other
[1:37:39] world when God see you Hallelujah he
[1:37:43] seeing you through the Covenant and the
[1:37:46] Covenant is perfect what is the Covenant
[1:37:49] it is the blood he's seeing it through
[1:37:51] the blood and so when he seed you to the
[1:37:54] blood is seeing his predestinated part
[1:37:57] oh my oh my Len what I'm saying to you
[1:38:01] Church you
[1:38:03] see on the Eternal side Hallelujah all
[1:38:07] is
[1:38:08] perfect there's no weakness there's no
[1:38:11] sugar diabetes there's no high blood
[1:38:14] pressure how you there church God is
[1:38:17] seeing a perfect reflection of
[1:38:19] you it's perfect on his side the works
[1:38:23] is already done it's perfect oh my it's
[1:38:27] already done hallelujah and so in order
[1:38:31] to to transfer that it takes it that's
[1:38:34] why he came himself to take the work of
[1:38:38] us and bring it on to himself so we say
[1:38:42] it is his life it's his death it's his
[1:38:47] healing his
[1:38:49] resurrection his power his love his
[1:38:53] saving grace everything that we have
[1:38:57] belongs to him is what he had done for
[1:39:00] me while I'm standing here I'm rejoicing
[1:39:04] because of what he has done it's not my
[1:39:08] works but his Works in other word
[1:39:11] hallelujah oh my can I show you church
[1:39:15] that the works that he's revealing to
[1:39:17] you is the works Hallelujah that was
[1:39:20] already
[1:39:21] done he's revealing to you perfect work
[1:39:26] Hallelujah and so the Covenant is to
[1:39:28] take it off over humanity and bring it
[1:39:31] unto God
[1:39:33] himself there can be no failure in this
[1:39:37] there can be no DET there can be no Heil
[1:39:39] there can be nothing Hallelujah because
[1:39:42] God himself is saying hallelujah but I
[1:39:46] have done it for you and through you
[1:39:51] Hallelujah
[1:39:53] Hallelujah so the Covenant is God
[1:39:59] hallelujah praise God is is is the one
[1:40:01] that is doing the doing it for us so
[1:40:04] Ence we saw under this New Covenant he
[1:40:07] gave his own blood he became that
[1:40:09] perfect
[1:40:11] sacrifice Hallelujah you see all that
[1:40:14] God has been doing have been doing
[1:40:16] really to purge our
[1:40:18] conscience by its own blood what's the
[1:40:22] blood brother said the blood is the word
[1:40:24] and so what he's doing he's revealing
[1:40:27] his word to us that by faith we will see
[1:40:31] and and believe that word and step into
[1:40:33] it but it's not just words of
[1:40:36] time in other word church there got to
[1:40:39] come a time where we move out of this
[1:40:42] time domain
[1:40:44] boundary and we step into a Heavenly
[1:40:47] atmosphere where where our faith catches
[1:40:51] the Heavenly things and so it changed
[1:40:54] our walk it changed the manner of our
[1:40:57] dress
[1:40:59] sisters we we we we we we live lives
[1:41:02] unhe hurt but reflecting another do
[1:41:06] Dominion we are here in this life but
[1:41:08] we're we're we're producing works from
[1:41:11] Another Life From Another
[1:41:14] Dimension hallelujah praise God oh
[1:41:18] my so the the Covenant brought us back
[1:41:21] to the Eternal world
[1:41:23] where there's no sin there's no fault it
[1:41:28] took us back to the Eternal thoughts of
[1:41:31] God and in those thoughts God is seeing
[1:41:34] his children
[1:41:37] perfect so when you look upon us
[1:41:39] tonight's CH he only see us through the
[1:41:42] perfect blood of Christ Hallelujah and
[1:41:45] The Works according to his word are
[1:41:47] already completed perfect hallelujah
[1:41:52] we're getting there and so you know
[1:41:55] brother Mark sent me this I had actually
[1:41:57] asked him for an extract from uh from
[1:42:01] Divine Healing I think uh this was one
[1:42:05] of interview by
[1:42:08] sister I don't remember her name yes but
[1:42:12] this was an interview done by Brother
[1:42:15] Bron you know um while she was in in in
[1:42:19] the hospital and gam said some things to
[1:42:22] her you know I'm going to read
[1:42:24] it
[1:42:26] here brother bam said I'm fixing to pray
[1:42:29] for you I am not worthy of that I think
[1:42:34] he said what what would I do if Jesus
[1:42:37] Christ was sitting here now he said and
[1:42:41] what would he do if he was sitting here
[1:42:44] he lay his hands upon you and with his
[1:42:47] great fith see you you get well so well
[1:42:51] I think well I am I am a sinner I'm not
[1:42:55] him but I come to represent him he said
[1:43:00] but
[1:43:00] remember me being a
[1:43:03] sinner and before God I'm he said I'm
[1:43:06] not a
[1:43:11] sinner I am not a sinner neither are you
[1:43:15] he said we got a blood sacrifice laying
[1:43:18] there that God don't even see
[1:43:21] us wow
[1:43:24] he said he hears our voice but he sees
[1:43:27] the blood of of Christ he said that's it
[1:43:30] he saids see he sees the blood of his
[1:43:33] own son it's our voice Christ blood then
[1:43:37] it's Christ that talk through us to God
[1:43:41] so therefore we are not Sinners no
[1:43:45] more Hallelujah we are he said we are
[1:43:49] Christian I believe you to be a genine
[1:43:53] Christian
[1:43:55] woman it's through the
[1:43:57] blood the blood the sacrifice is perfect
[1:44:01] in other word
[1:44:03] hallelujah you see one of us struggle
[1:44:06] and I'm going on the contrast because
[1:44:08] there's something I need to show you
[1:44:10] before I close
[1:44:12] right on the contrast is that there is a
[1:44:16] perfect blood that speaks perfectly for
[1:44:20] our perfect atonement
[1:44:23] but you know what church I find that
[1:44:25] while we live in these mortal bodies we
[1:44:30] struggle we we we get sick we find
[1:44:34] ourselves struggling and we said Lord
[1:44:38] how what what is happening because the
[1:44:41] sacrifice is
[1:44:43] perfect there's not one sick person here
[1:44:45] tonight not
[1:44:47] one if we accept the word that Jesus
[1:44:50] said that 2,000 years ago every sickness
[1:44:54] was
[1:44:55] healed every dead was raised everything
[1:44:58] that needed to be accomplished was
[1:45:00] accomplished in other word the atonement
[1:45:02] speak perfectly for
[1:45:04] Perfection but here we
[1:45:07] are some of us have to go to the doctor
[1:45:10] some of us feel pain all
[1:45:14] over does that mean that the sacrifice
[1:45:17] has
[1:45:19] imperfection
[1:45:21] no let me show you something and I I
[1:45:24] never saw this until you know I started
[1:45:26] studying you see to wake up your
[1:45:30] conscience to
[1:45:32] bring really God already knows the end
[1:45:37] he sees the end but he knows where
[1:45:39] you're at right
[1:45:41] now so while in our soul we we are not
[1:45:45] from this realm we're in another world
[1:45:48] but in our bodies we are still
[1:45:50] here and so God had to made provision
[1:45:53] for that but while in our mortal state
[1:45:57] in our mortal weakness Hallelujah God
[1:46:01] can give us a petition of
[1:46:03] overcoming so
[1:46:05] God I'm going to quote it but uh Genesis
[1:46:09] 15 and verse 8 the Bible said and God
[1:46:13] said and he said Lord God where by shall
[1:46:17] I know that I shall inherit it and he
[1:46:20] said unto him take me in effer
[1:46:24] that's a perfect atonement Now take me
[1:46:26] an eer of threey old and a she go threey
[1:46:29] old and a around 3 years old and he said
[1:46:33] and a turtle above hallelujah what was
[1:46:37] that Turtle love brother bam said it was
[1:46:40] for
[1:46:42] healing oh my brother Mark
[1:46:46] healing the Covenant is perfect but God
[1:46:50] put healing in that perfect
[1:46:54] Covenant because he knows hallelujah our
[1:46:58] mortal State why we live in these bodies
[1:47:01] of
[1:47:02] humiliation there will be instances that
[1:47:05] hallah our faith will not be fully
[1:47:08] surrendered to God's perfect
[1:47:11] word and do you know that if in one
[1:47:14] instance if you fail to believe it bring
[1:47:16] us right back to where you are in the
[1:47:18] first place
[1:47:20] debt Hallelujah sin will produce
[1:47:23] unbelief will produce thatt but he knows
[1:47:26] that
[1:47:27] church and so what did he do he put
[1:47:30] healing in the
[1:47:32] Covenant hallelujah praise
[1:47:35] God but when you find
[1:47:38] yourself in a
[1:47:40] situation when your life begins
[1:47:44] struggling when you start find yourself
[1:47:47] Hallelujah in a state with a sickness or
[1:47:49] whatever remember this that God God
[1:47:53] placed healing in the
[1:47:56] Covenant he took in consideration your
[1:48:00] sickness Hallelujah he take in
[1:48:02] consideration that there are times you
[1:48:04] will not obey the word he knows that is
[1:48:09] go where you get it from listen Jonah
[1:48:12] God gave him the perfect word and he
[1:48:15] should have gone to nineve and speak
[1:48:19] it that was God's perfect will but what
[1:48:23] did he do he took a ship and went the
[1:48:26] total opposite
[1:48:28] direction that was total SC
[1:48:33] disregard and because of that he should
[1:48:35] have
[1:48:36] died the consequence to his action
[1:48:39] should have produced
[1:48:41] that but God in his Sovereign Grace
[1:48:45] Hallelujah God would have wanted his son
[1:48:48] his children to obey him by his perfect
[1:48:51] will but but God saw Hallelujah his
[1:48:55] servant stepping into his permissive
[1:48:58] well but brother said but even him
[1:49:01] Hallelujah his own permissive well God
[1:49:04] will bring forth his perfect will who
[1:49:08] did know that there was a whale waiting
[1:49:10] there to swallow
[1:49:12] Jonah Hallelujah you know the Bible said
[1:49:15] the Bible said God prepare a special
[1:49:19] fish God knew until God make provision
[1:49:22] for for it did not stop or prevent the
[1:49:26] word from going forth no
[1:49:29] way do you know when when Abraham lied
[1:49:33] he should have died right
[1:49:35] there do you know when Sarah Li she
[1:49:38] should have died right there but the
[1:49:41] grace of God stepped in because God made
[1:49:45] provision for his church
[1:49:47] hallelujah
[1:49:49] hallelujah God make provision for our
[1:49:51] lives he make provision for a situation
[1:49:55] he
[1:49:56] knows and so he put the turn of Love
[1:49:59] butam said what he did the priest would
[1:50:02] have would have had like two turtled up
[1:50:04] and he would pull the head off one and
[1:50:07] and turn it upside down and and the
[1:50:08] blood from that one will drip on the
[1:50:10] other one and he baath that one with the
[1:50:12] blood and then he released it and
[1:50:15] wherever it goes it take the blood
[1:50:18] Hallelujah church God has given us
[1:50:21] eternal love
[1:50:23] Hallelujah of Divine Healing hallelujah
[1:50:26] what am I saying Church you see
[1:50:29] Hallelujah God through the position of
[1:50:32] Divine Healing you see brother Mark when
[1:50:35] we speak of healing you know we say that
[1:50:38] Hallelujah when you're sick you're
[1:50:39] healed but remember now that's why we
[1:50:41] say under the tpol it must produce
[1:50:45] healing in abundance in a way that we
[1:50:48] have never experienced before because we
[1:50:51] saw the first anointing What It Did It
[1:50:53] produced healing by the works but it
[1:50:57] could not bring Perfection no sir the
[1:51:01] second brought forth healing but it
[1:51:03] could not produce Perfection it's the
[1:51:06] brother gospel where did you get that
[1:51:08] Lazarus was healed from Death he died
[1:51:13] and he was
[1:51:14] healed but he was healed to die
[1:51:18] again oh my Hallelujah and so Hallelujah
[1:51:23] the production or this healing that God
[1:51:26] is producing Hallelujah the works it's
[1:51:30] it's transforming us from The Works
[1:51:33] Hallelujah of of from God's Own Works
[1:51:35] inside of us and it's producing
[1:51:38] Hallelujah healing in a way Hallelujah
[1:51:41] in abundance into
[1:51:43] Perfection church is changing us is
[1:51:48] transforming us and so in this age
[1:51:51] hallelujah praise is God he's producing
[1:51:55] that healing brother bam let me quote
[1:51:57] here
[1:51:58] quickly brother bam said um the message
[1:52:01] Abraham preached 1956 he said no Divine
[1:52:05] Healing is not on the same basis as
[1:52:08] salvation the Divine Healing was
[1:52:10] included in the atonement truly is that
[1:52:13] the all atonement had Divine
[1:52:16] Healing and the new one is much better
[1:52:20] than the old one so if it is better
[1:52:22] better it got to be better in every way
[1:52:25] but Divine Healing
[1:52:28] salvation of the soul and you're
[1:52:30] becoming a new creature it's a eternal
[1:52:33] life you don't have eternal Health by
[1:52:37] healing but he said but it's an
[1:52:40] attribute it's he said it's an Earnest
[1:52:43] of your
[1:52:44] Resurrection it's a it's a if there is
[1:52:47] no Divine Healing then there is no
[1:52:51] Resurrection he says see but now he said
[1:52:54] what is it it said it's your personal
[1:52:56] faith I'm going to end with this part
[1:52:59] tonight he said it is your personal
[1:53:01] faith in the finished work of
[1:53:05] Calvary oh my church Hallelujah you see
[1:53:09] there's a part that we still got to do
[1:53:13] Hallelujah and all God is requiring to
[1:53:16] bring us there is to accept his word by
[1:53:21] faith
[1:53:23] Hallelujah accept his word by faith it
[1:53:27] produces Church it makes alive it it
[1:53:30] brings us why because when your faith is
[1:53:32] anchored on the Eternal Word it
[1:53:35] produces it changes the atmosphere it
[1:53:39] changes our body it changes our
[1:53:42] experience it Chang Our Lives it brings
[1:53:46] us from our mortal condition Hallelujah
[1:53:49] into God's True Divine Healing
[1:53:52] Hallelujah and he changing me it's
[1:53:54] producing the work he raising me up
[1:53:57] again my conscience is being resurrected
[1:54:00] from dead Works to serve the Living God
[1:54:04] Hallelujah the word is producing itself
[1:54:07] Hallelujah but all is asking to the
[1:54:10] process of healing is not to walk away
[1:54:14] but to accept what he says and no matter
[1:54:18] what but believe it and watch God brings
[1:54:21] it to pass
[1:54:23] you know I while I Was preparing I I
[1:54:27] thought you know something came to
[1:54:28] Brother John you know I remember the the
[1:54:30] other day when you were preaching and
[1:54:32] you mentioning of sister Justine you
[1:54:35] know when she had that condition and she
[1:54:37] walked up you know if a medical doctor
[1:54:40] was there they would have called us
[1:54:44] cuckoo there's no medical referal
[1:54:47] there's no there's no reference there's
[1:54:49] nothing there you can use to explain
[1:54:51] what happened
[1:54:53] you know all she did that something in
[1:54:55] our heart come on church was calling her
[1:54:59] back to the Eternal things to an eternal
[1:55:03] condition where she's being raised from
[1:55:05] her dead work hallelujah what is calling
[1:55:08] her her conscience is calling her back
[1:55:10] to the Eternal world to bring her back
[1:55:13] to her Eternal estate H she listen when
[1:55:18] when it happened Church the resurrecting
[1:55:20] power of God hallelujah was was calling
[1:55:23] her to bring a
[1:55:24] change you know I think I was here the
[1:55:26] day when she came and she held her hand
[1:55:28] up and she was prayed for listen church
[1:55:32] I can't explain to you the mechanics I
[1:55:35] can't really Hallelujah but I know this
[1:55:38] that if God put something on your heart
[1:55:41] and you walk up Hallelujah and believe
[1:55:44] that Hallelujah Church it
[1:55:48] produces I'm saying to you when I was
[1:55:50] younger I I I was
[1:55:53] you know when I was about AG
[1:55:55] 13 medically but there was no cure we
[1:55:59] did everything everything possible there
[1:56:02] was nothing I mean for I here a half I
[1:56:05] was I was sick I couldn't walk on the
[1:56:07] road I could not go to school every
[1:56:09] Saturday every weekend we were at the
[1:56:11] doctor trying to get some help and my
[1:56:14] mom she was totally frustrated because
[1:56:17] you know we were living kind of real
[1:56:18] rough life back home and all of that and
[1:56:21] and and so man I just and but I knew
[1:56:24] that God could do this church and so at
[1:56:27] age3 hallelujah praise God you know I I
[1:56:31] I had a little bible a little New

[1:56:45] under my clothes and I open the Bible I
[1:56:48] don't remember which Psalms I had it to
[1:56:50] but I had the word under my and my skin
[1:56:54] and so when I feel sick I squeeze the
