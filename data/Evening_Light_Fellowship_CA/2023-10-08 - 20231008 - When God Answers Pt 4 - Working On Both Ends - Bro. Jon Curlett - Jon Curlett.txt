time of storm Lord in a world that is in chaos that is Lord spiraling Lord into the gutter Lord You're a shelter Lord You're a place where we can go Lord You're a a firm foundation Lord You're a steady anchor that holds Lord Jesus and Lord we're so thankful to have that this morning Lord that when all around us seems chaos and nothing seems to be working right Lord we know that yet you are the God in the midst of the storm Lord and that you hold your children in your hand Lord and nothing can pluck you from it Lord we're praying you'll just settle our hearts Lord our minds our souls this morning once again Lord as your word is preached Lord may it just reach into our lives Lord may it give us that settled feeling Lord regardless of how the circumstance looks Lord may we trust that you are in it all we pray Lord bless your people we ask Lord Just Have Your Way this morning we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Jeremiah chapter 10 Jeremiah chapter 10 want to welcome again sister Kimberly's Father Anthony all the way up from the United States just got a chance to spend some time with them at our house on Friday night so God bless you good to see you here amen we've got brother Kingsley who's headed to Nigeria Lord willing to bring his wife home so we want to be praying for that we want to be trusting that the scripture says that God looked at man and said it's not good for man to dwell Alone brother the Kingsley has a a perfectly acceptable wife I say that the Lord needs to bring her home so we trust that we trust that God will do that so keep praying that her immigration paperwork will go through and just resolve it beautifully so he can bring sister Melody home with him as well amen want to welcome our visitor as well this morning God bless you just trusting that uh God will touch your soul this morning amen Jeremiah 10:23 says this l oh Lord I know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps I took that to the Amplified it says Lord I know that the determination of the way of a man is not in himself it is not in man even in a strong man or in a man at his best to direct his own steps amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're taking a a final service on this thought of when God answers and I'm I'm taking a subtitle this morning of working on both ends and I was talking to someone after last service and I said I don't know what I'm going to preach on Sunday I've got one quote left and this is the one quote service so this is what happens when God does it and I was just dwelling on it and and just it seemed to open up to me and and I just wanted to to bring it this morning to the church so trusting it'll be a blessing but I opened up with this this scripture in Jer Jeremiah for a very particular reason because we're talking about when God answers and and if we look at the Scriptures it says that there's nothing in us that is capable of leading Us in the way that we ought to go and we look around and we see many of us and and maybe some of us are gifted intellectually some of us are gifted physically we've got genetic things on our side maybe we're born into wealth we're born into a family that is very successful and I'll tell you what we can do okay for a while but in the end what happens is we always go overboard in some area and that's what what takes us over and and you can go overboard in what is nominally a good area and it'll be too far and it'll get you out of balance and you'll run all the way down and all of a sudden you're out in the middle of nowhere and things have fallen apart and you say what happened I was only doing what I ought to do no you went too far because there's nothing in you the checks and balances of a Christian the the checks and balances of a word are not there to keep us amen but we we're speaking on when God answers and I believe as Christians as Believers we know that there's nothing in us that can get us through the way that God can amen that we go to him for answers because we know that we've tried our answers and our answers just don't work they just don't take us to that to that place amen and you look even around this world and you look at the richest and the the wealthiest and the most famous and they are usually the most miserable people on the world the most gifted ones that are out there and what happens is they have such great gifts but because they can't control it they go overboard and they're the ones that are usually in the greatest addictions because they can't manage themselves they can't manage manage the wealth they can't manage the fame and these different things and you know you know we talk about Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and usually they end up truly famous for all the wrong reasons you look at Elvis Presley one of the most gifted singers ever he came from a Pentecostal background he was gifted to to to sing the gospel and he turned it into rock and roll and what did he do he ended up dying on a toilet with a drug overdose that's where he ended up a gift given to him by God and he couldn't handle it and Satan took it and turned him into a drug addict in the end bloated heavy all these different things amen but we know that even as Believers we know that things sometimes seem to take a turn and they go sideways and they spiral and it seems like things are out of control seems like God hasn't answered that God hasn't provided but I want to take a just this thought as I said this morning on working on both ends because I want to show you how God is working sometimes and and how our need is often the answer to somebody else's that God can be doing something to you for the benefit of somebody else but before he comes back around to meet your need or he'll meet your need in meeting their need even as the case may be let me say this this morning there's nothing so beautifully crafted as the plan of God for your life you know we've got Hollywood today and they're trying to always write a new a new script and we've got authors are trying to write a new book that can somehow give a Twist that nobody has seen coming but I'll tell you God knows how to put twists into our life that we don't see coming and that's where we have to believe and trust by faith that God is in it even when we don't see the twist coming when we can't see a way out when we can't see a way through when we can't see a way over or under And yet when it all happens all we do as we look back and we can only say How Great Thou Art Lord you had your hand in it all the time you knew what you were doing and I just had to trust you all the way through God knows how to write a script amen the beautiful thing is he's given us the CO's notes he's given us the the the the Junctions he's given us the pivot Points all of it is in here if we'll only take it and trust it and believe it amen but I want to take this thought of working on both ends and I'm going to start in the book of First Kings chapter 17 very familiar story we know and it says and Elijah the tishbite who is of the inhabitants of Gilead said to Ahab this is the king he said as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall be no do or rain these years but according to my word in other words it's not going to rain you're not even going to get due on the ground until I say so and the word of the Lord came to him saying get you hence and turn Eastward and hide Yourself by the Brook Cher that's before Jordan and it shall be that you shall drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed you there so God has gotten him to pronounce judgment and then he says I've prepared a place of Refuge where you can have food and you can have water he says go there and so Elisha did exactly that he went to where God said he says and he went and did according to the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by The Rook Chariot that's before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook so God told him I'll provide and then God provided it says and it came to pass though after a while Supernatural provision the Ravens are bringing him food every day it says that the brook dried up because there have been no gra no rain in the land you can live without food for a while you can't live without water and it's the water that dries up and so now Elijah's in a pinch this is the plot twist we didn't see coming God said go here I'll provide for you you get there and then God pulls the provision prophet of God has done exactly what God has told him to and yet now God has yanked his provision away it says and the word of the Lord came to him saying arise get thee to zarap which belongeth to ziden and dwell there in other words go to zarap and stay there he says behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee now let's stop for a second because Elijah's in a tight spot here the land's had no rain in years he's leaving what was a source of water he's going out into the land there's a price on his head no nobody likes this judgment that he's called down from God on them he's a he's a man that is unpopular and now God says leave here go to zarapa and go to a widow woman God's not catering to his needs God has put him in a tight spot and now he's out of God's favor it would seem and God saying now go to a widow woman God no doubt Elijah is thinking God you've stopped providing for me and it was all of a sudden we don't see this idea that the brook dried up gradually one day it was there and the next it wasn't he had it and then he didn't so this thing just happens in a in a moment and and it would seem that God is pull back his hand of favor from Elisha or Elijah rather and then he says now go to a widow woman you you want to you want to go you know go into somebody's house you want to take their food and water a widow woman seems the wrong choice you know Lord why don't you send me to a wealthy family that has a nice air conditioned home they've got plenty of money in the bank they've been able to survive real well I won't be a burden on them but he says no I have commanded a widow woman let me tell you that widow woman had no idea a prophet was coming her way but God says I've commanded because when it's in the heart of a child to obey God whatever God tells him to do they're going to do when it comes their way amen it it made no sense but this is only Elijah's side of things now Elijah has all Faith Elijah's not worried don't get me wrong but he's sitting there and it looks like he's done everything right and then God pulls back his hand of favor now let's go to the other side and listen to this quote he says now there was a woman in the land now neither one of these people know each other he says but she must have been an honorable woman she must have been the type of woman that Elijah was a man because God chose that woman out of all the woman that there was in Israel to entertain his prophet he never would have chosen an immoral woman to entertain his prophet and that woman was a widow woman the drought was in the land and she started out after death of her husband she had a little baby rais she was struggling to try and make a living for the little fellow and finally the bread begin to cease she sees the the the Slow Hand of Death coming into her home cuz she can see that she's getting less and less oil she's getting less and less flour every day and it's dwindling bit by bit and she can see the end coming it's this agonizing death that's creeping towards her and her little boy it says and it came to pass to a place one day when she went to look at her little fellow she saw saw his little sleeves out torn up she must have looked at herself in the mirror seen how she'd left the table with something on it for the baby and her own cheekbones was sticking out her little frail looking arms she didn't mind it for herself but the little boy she was trying she just didn't want to see him die so finally one day she went to the meal barrel and there was just one handful of meal left she goes over to the cruise to see how much oil and just about a good tablespoon that stood between her and death he said I suppose that night there was an allnight prayer meeting he says isn't it strange how God lets us get right down to the end of the road no doubt but she checked up said Lord God I've served you I've done all I know how to do I've met your requirements and here I've got one handful of meal a spoonful of oil between death for my child and myself all night long she must have prayed and when the little fellow would wake up and turn over and say mama would you just go to the cupboard and see if there's just a little bit of that bread left she'd go back cry a little then she would come back give him a little little water to drink for she knew she had just this little bit and it and it had to maybe make the next day and the little fellow would couldn't sleep good because of hunger what a place this is the provision of God for his Prophet coming her way he says and the woman as she seen those that crucial hour coming no doubt she checked up and said Lord I've done all I know how to do he says when you've done everything you know how to do and met every requirement that God has required that that's where Faith takes a hold that's where faith comes in if you've met every requirement that God required you to do then sometimes God tests your faith to see what kind of a reaction you'll have on your action oh he's good at that it just proves whether you really believe what you think you believe he says you know he does that many times but she was certain she'd walked upright before God and God proved it by inviting his Prophet to live with her see God confirms things so the morning was breaking the birds begin to sing as Dawn began to break she looked at that little fellow again she patted him she knelt down and said Lord God he'll be getting up in a few minutes I'll go prepare the last thing I've got and give it to him and then I'll take him in my arms and we'll die together he says she went out and got a handful of meal he says now meal the meal offering which means Christ the word and when they ground that meal offering in the days of the Bible they used a certain bur that ground every little bit of bit every little bit of meal just exactly the same there's no difference in it it was all the same size it was very fine he says that types this that means Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and when God ground his life out of him at Calvary he gave it to the church that he be the same yesterday today and forever we don't believe in just a historical Christ but we believe that he's alive and well today that he's working in his church that he still heals that he still delivers that he still provides he does all of these things the way he did Back Then he said and then she goes and gets the oil the oil represents the spirit that's why we anoint with oil it represents the spirit she put the oil and the meal together and began to prepare it he says and when the spirit and the word gets together something's going to take place she was at the end so she got the word and the spirit and began to mix it together now it's ready for baking now we got a story the plot thickens amen the prophet has no food because God has turned off his Supply why now Elijah doesn't know why all he knows is God's going to provide for me but God has turned off Elijah's provision so that he can go and provide for a widow the need of the Widow has turned off Elijah's Supply cuz she needs Elijah she needs the god of Elijah to come into her life and without it her and her child are going to die so God puts his profit in hardship so that he can go and help a woman amen what is it she had a heart for God he says he commanded her she had a heart for God and whatever God would tell her to do she would obey it whatever it was amen her willingness to believe God was the same as him commanding her to do it wasn't optional to her she's a Believer she's a Christian and so she's going to take God at his word it says so he arose and went to zarap and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water in a vessel that I might drink now we go back to the story it says she goes out in the yard to pick up two sticks did you notice the Bible said two sticks if you notice the two sticks represented the cross and he says now self sacrifice now she'd mixed the word and the spirit together and was ready to put it to the fire and she goes to pick up those sticks and perhaps she got the last one in her hand and was starting back to the house and she looked at the gate and there was this gentle looking old man perhaps baldheaded Whiskers hanging down standing leaning across the gate and he said would you just fetch me just a little drink of water she looked at him and thought well I've got about a half a gallon in the house that the poor old fell looks so thirsty I'd be willing to divide it with him and she might have said yes kind sir I'll get you a little of the water cuz the Springs have dried up and everything all the water's dried up and she started to get the water and he knew so her actions her response to his request told him this is the woman you're looking for all right he he says you see God answers on both ends of the line now listen now he's putting a timeline on this two hours before we're coming right down to the wire Church she's at the last of her flour and oil she's going to die after she eats this and Elijah has everything he needs and then God turns off the Taps two hours before everything was good until it wasn't good right Elijah's need comes on suddenly she's had this long slow agonizing March towards hunger but they both have the same need she needs food he needs water she's got water he's got food but neither one knows it neither one knows it all right he says he says two hours before that the brook had dried up on top of the mountain where Elijah was and he said Elijah go down to the city keep walking till you find a woman with two sticks in her hand she's going to find you he says God does things real church we believe that that God does things real I'm going to share with you some real things that God has done in the last couple weeks in this church but God does things real he is not just a god of The Ether he's a God that's interested in our everyday needs and lives the scripture says that he's a high priest that can be touched by our infirmities by the struggles by The Pain by the suffering by the difficulties we go through he says I've sent you down there and she's going to feed you she hasn't got nothing in the house but I'm going to feed you and he walked down the street till he seen that woman packing those two sticks and that must be her so he had to catch her attention he said would you fetch me a little water and she said I will now catch the twist here because why did she say I will cuz she has lots to share water's not her problem right her her Christianity hasn't left her in this trial that she's going through and so she has lots of water relative to her need and so she's willing to do the water but what's her weak spot what's the pain Point what's the difficult part of her life food she got plenty of water no food so what does God do goes to a pain point he says and as she was going to fetch it he knows she's the one he says and he he just adds on to it he twists a knife just a little bit more he called to her and said bring me I pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand you know what a morsel is a little bit you know how much she had church a little bit he didn't know it he asked for a bit but he was asking for every bit that she had in her house he was saying give me your last give me your all and she said as the Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruise behold I'm gathering 26 that I may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die the Last Supper he says this and as she turned and started he said and just bring me a little morsel of bread in your hand Elijah seeing that Vision already knew what the conditions were he didn't ask for more than she had he asked for only what she had and she said as the Lord liveth Elijah knew she was a Christian than a Believer as the Lord liveth I've got just a handful of meal a spoonful of oil that I've already prepared I've dressed it and got it ready and I'm taking these two sticks to make a little cake for my son and I and we're going to eat it and die and Elijah said to her fear not go and do as thou Hast said but make me thereof a little cake first bring it unto me and after make for thee and thy son he tells her to do the impossible go use everything you've got give it to me first and then after I I've eaten then you guys can go and you can make another one for yourself he says now here comes a great lesson Elijah said bake me one first oh what is it there what lesson do we learn seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness bake me one first and she looked and she said I wonder who that is there's something about that man that seems to be different and he said make me one first and bring it and she started in to do what he said and then he said for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth now H catch what happens here Elijah is speaking the creative word of God this ain't just a promise this is a creative work because he says if you'll do it then you'll never run out of flour and you'll never run out of oil every time you pour it out there'll be some in there the next time every time you use it up there's going to be more provided for you that's thus sayith the Lord who's speaking it Elijah but she's got to believe who's speaking is behind that is the Lord God and then he says then she heard the comforting word that always Comforts for thus sayeth the Lord the barrel will not be empty nor the cruise run dry until the day that God sends rain on the earth what was it that very dark crucial moment come but God's always on the scene he says if if you're sure that it's God if you've repented of your sins if you've met God's requirement then be sure that God will keep his promise when things go wrong the first thing we do is we check up we say Lord am I living right am I doing your will you can be living right and be out of the will of God you can have a clean life and not be obedient to God's will for your life he may be telling you to do something go somewhere let something go add something in that's all that's what he's looking for is full of obedience not just in your conduct but will you obey the voice of the Lord in your life he said if you've done all that then be sure that God keeps his promise if when men and women could only realize that God's obligated to his promise and if you've met his requirements if you've confessed your sins you've made your wrongs right you've done everything God has required then do what hold on to God he says you've got to see daylight It's always darkest just Before Dawn remember he says he's got to bring it through just be certain that it's God and he will take care of the rest of it if you're sure that it's God now watch her response now what a woman what a woman of faith it says and she went and did according to the saying of Elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days it was what fellowship with spirit and Truth with the word and the spirit brought them what food for many days she sustained him for many days she didn't die her child didn't die Elijah eventually leaves and the Miracle stays cuz she obeyed God it says the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord that he spake by Elijah Elijah spake by inspiration and God backed him up to the hilt and he blessed that woman until the drought went away and she could she could receive what she had need of we're going to take a look at a second small event it seems in insignificant in scripture but I'm setting us up for a grand finale today this is in Luke 21 and this is Jesus and it says he looked up and he saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury and he saw also a certain poor Widow casting in thether two mites so there's a widow comes up she's declared as poor and she puts in two mites two mites is worth 12 minutes of work new land's uh minimum wage says $15 an hour so she put $3 in she gave an offering to the Church of $3 it says and he said of a truth I say unto you that this poor Widow has cast in more than they all she gave three bucks they were perhaps giving hundreds thousands tens of thousands of dollars into the temple and he says she gave more than all of them he says for all of these have of their abundance cast into the offerings of God he says they have a lot and so they gave a lot but she of her penury had cast in all the living she had her in her in her lack has given every cent she had now Church she had $3 to her name three measly bucks I think Samuel my three-year-old has more money than that woman had and she gave every penny to it I'm not calling for money I said before this church out gives churches two and three times at size I don't pull for money we've never have in the ministry you give of your own Hearts but there's a I'll tell you there's been times where I know how tight things are and I see what people give into the church and I say in my heart they ought not to do that we don't need it that bad but you know what that's between you and God that's between you and God we never pull for money you know it you're witness and a testimony to it but you do it why do you do it because God puts it on your heart not cuz I ever talk about it not because brother Gerald ever talked about it but we just lay it out there and the people respond as they want to but you look at this Jesus looks on this and he Praises her for her sacrifice but he doesn't do a thing for her life he doesn't stop he doesn't come up and say ma'am we don't need that money nearly as much as you do he didn't stop her he let her do it you know and scripture's Silent about this we have no clue what happened to this woman later but listen to what the the prophet of God says he says for one day we read in the Bible where Jesus was watching the rich put lots of money in the offering but a poor Widow came by and put in about three pennies he says Lord guess if if I'd have been standing there I'd have run up and grabbed her hand and said don't do that sister we got enough in here but you were standing there and you didn't stop her for you knew what laid just ahead he says you knew you'd return it to her H hundredfold we're speaking about when God answers and when he's working on both ends and I was curious about this scripture because we don't hear anything but you know what it does say in Malachi 3 it says bring ye all the ties into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith sayith the Lord of hosts he says prove me with this he says if I will not open to you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it he didn't say he give you all this money we don't preach this this ridiculous uh you know uh wealth Doctrine this this Prosperity Gospel but the scripture says Paul said I've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread his children begging bread he said he'd always meet our need always meet our need that's the richness that he pours out and we've seen it we've seen it when the world goes into a an economic depression we hold on to our jobs by God's grace when we lose our jobs miraculously we make it through the year don't we brother Matt brother Matt lost his job for a year and he came out on the other side basically the same as he went in without a job how do you do that Jehovah Gyra he provides right he sees the needs and he provides for it brother would say this he says and you have to forsake everything that's right to follow him but that he that will forsake all and follow him God pays off in the Bountiful blessings of richness his richness not as the world sees it but as God sees it he says there's nothing to compare with it now I've taken a story from from Elijah's time I've taken a story from Jesus time and you know we look at these stories and this is the problem so often with religion today is that it's all in the past it's all in a time that's way before us it's people and situations perhaps that that we can't identify with but the scripture is not there for us to just hear about but the scripture is there so that we'll experience the same things that it does so that we'll recognize God doing the same thing in our lives as he did then and so we've got a right in fact we've got an obligation to look into the word and expect God to do what he says there today remember Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now I want to talk about that story remember brother Brandon was up in those Hills and he was thinking on this scripture it was this Mark 11 it says for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that these things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith brother bams preaching about this in that message my new ministry and he says the presence of the Lord comes down and God starts to talk to him about what this really looks like okay we've got the fourth Elijah anointing right we had Elijah Elisha John the Baptist then we have William brandham and then we've got the Elijah going to the Jews the fourth one okay this is the Elijah anointing coming down and God tells him he says I'm going to show you what this means and he's out there squirrel hunting remember and he's in a place and there was no squirrels around they've been hunting and hunting and there was nothing to be found and he couldn't see any and and and God said he said I'm going to show you what it means for this scripture and he says what do you want to happen and brother Braham said I want three squirrels and God said then you tell me where to put them and I'll put them there and remember what brother Braham did is he said I want them in three places where no self-respecting squirrel would be and he called for the first one and he called for it and as soon as he did it stepped out and he shot it then he called for the second one the second one stepped out and he shot that but he called for three and remember he's waiting waiting for the third one and the third one took hours to come out what was God doing he was developing faith in the word of God as spoken through his own lips God was teaching him there's a new stage of your ministry coming and I've got to train you into it you know on on Saturday I think it was there yeah it was Saturday I was out with Samuel and he we were in the garage and he picked up a pedal bike so he's got one of those Strider bikes you know that you just go with your legs and you push on well he's seing all the kids riding their pedal bikes including the neighbor boy that the same age as him and so he picked it up and he he he he sat on the bike and he stood there and put his feet on the pedals he's got amazing balance he stayed up for about six or seven seconds without tipping over but then he tipped over tipped it up again got on tried to balance and it wouldn't go so he said Daddy can you help me so I said sure so I took him out and I I grabbed him by the back of his coat to hold him up and then I said you just have to pedal and so he's trying to Pedal but he's pedaling backwards so he's hitting the brakes instead of the forward so I said no you got to put the pedal at the top and so showed him all these things well as soon as he gets going I'm holding an up by his jacket so he can do whatever and it doesn't matter it doesn't matter how he steers how hard he pedals whatever I've got him held up so he can do anything but as he started to get the hang of it the grip started coming off and I started letting him do more and me do less what was I doing I was teaching him faith in his own gift so for the first bit I've got a firm grasp then as he goes within 5 minutes he could do it on his own but slowly slowly slowly that hand's coming off until now he's got to trust that he can do it I've showed him he can do it then he's got to trust that he can do it guess what eventually I went in the house he stayed up for two hours and just went biking around and around and around and I watched him and he' come to a stop and he sure enough he' kick the pedal up and put it in position move himself forward power down and off youd go again then pretty soon he's saying Daddy watch me wheelie which just means bumping over things right that's his wheelie but what is it he's getting he's having faith in his ability to operate the gift of riding a b bicycle God's doing this with brother Bram he's saying brother brandom I'm giving you Authority here and the first time he does it God makes it happen immediately second time he does it immediately third time God makes him wait and he's got to sit there and have faith that that squirrel is going to appear and sure enough it doesn't he kills it the next day he comes back and God says God the presence of God comes down he says what do you want today he said well I had 114 squirrels I got three yesterday 117 120 is a nice round number I want to get three more squirrels and so he does and what happens is he asks for Three Squirrels the first one comes out and he shoots it immediately Waits a little while the second one comes out brother Ram says I've only missed five times this year and he misses three or four shots in a roll bang bang bang bang he keeps missing the squirrel and he can't understand it and then God says that's not where you said it was going to come out so brother Brandon waits till it goes to where he said it was going to be boom shoots it and it drops so he's got two he's sitting there all day nothing else appears it's getting dark he's got a little tiny Target scope on doesn't let the light in he says I'm I'm headed home and God says what about the third one you ask for a third one don't you believe there's a third one he said yes Lord I do but this is I can't see anything now and God said well where did you say it was he said right there and he looked up and he said and I saw what I thought was a squirrel just a lump there so I shot it it dropped he says but I don't actually know if it did or not he said so I saw another one right there so boom shot that went over grabbed that one he's got his three goes get back to get the fourth and he can't find it and he says I'm reaching all around and he said I saw a hole in a stump and I put my hand down in the stump and I thought maybe it was in there he says I thought I could feel it but I couldn't get my hand all the way the hole was too tight so he says I just left it so he goes back to the hunting lodge and he tells the brothers what's been going on including the seventh one that he believes he he shot and so brother Tony's there and he prays over the meal and they says Lord if brother bram's telling the truth help us find that squirrel tomorrow right so now brother bram's in a pickle because he didn't call for four he called for three and now we got a brother saying we'll find the fourth or let us find the fourth to prove that it's true here's what he said he says I never said I'd find the squirrel in the stump under that anointing I said I shot the squirrel this is in his story to the brothers of course I couldn't get the squirrel cuz if I did that that would have been more than I had said he called for three he got three he says I couldn't even get the fourth cuz I didn't call for the fourth he says just exactly what I had said under that anointing that's what God produced so I didn't say nothing about that so brother rah's all worried and he he he says he's thinking I got to tell brother Tony that squirrel may not be there because that's not what I asked for and that's not what God promised he says and I said brother Tony I never said the squirrel was in there I said I could feel it I when it raised up it would drop he says but brother Tony said it'll be there it'll be right there in the stump so now catch this thing brother Tony is saying I believe your story and now brother Tony's faith is embroiled in the story it's TW it's entwined with brother brandom's story brother Tony says I believe it I believe we're going to find it he says and so I went up on that we went on up and I left the car and I started to to turn back and say there's something wrong I better tell Tony now CU if that squirrel isn't in that hole or in that stump I come back with no squirrel at all then according to the way he prayed last night he'll still believe I told the lie I said God you know with my Bible I've told honest truth and God knows that's the truth it's just the truth he says and I went on and something just drove me on and I went walking up through the woods hunting I kept thinking what if that squirrel isn't there and he gave me his hunting knife so I could cut the whole bigger to reach in and get it and something said to me if it isn't there if it isn't there what makes the difference now God's saying to him he's saying it's your experience not brother Tony's experience what does it matter if brother Tony believes I did that for you I didn't do that for brother Tony so now you're trying to get it it to work out the way to brother Tony wants and and brother BR says I said he wouldn't believe me he prayed and said if we find the squirrel we'll know that our brothers told the truth and that great anointing come and said just say the squirrel will be up there and you'll get him now he's been told to speak for whose sake brother Tony's he said I thought surely Lord that surely this will be seven time straight while this anointing is on me I said is that you he said say what you will I said I shall find that world and then what happens he had a Glory Hallelujah shouting the anointing left me that's the trial Now isn't it we have great Services we have great moments we have great experience with God and then when that anointing lifts off you're left with stinking flesh Fallen mind and Satan trying to beat it all out of you again he says I hunted till 9:30 what we were supposed to do I went up out the hill at 9:30 looked in the hole felt around and cut and there was no squirrel there at all in the hole I felt all around he says now what I was picking up was little fine Grassroots or roots of trees I was picking up and feeling it fall off the stick when I run the stick in and pull it up like that so he thought it was fur but it was just little bits of of tree and and and lint and stuff he says and I was pick I thought I was picking up the squirrel and it was sliding off the stick but it was little roots and Things No squirrel in there I thought now what will I do I said here it is 9:30 I got to go back I P picked up my rifle and started down the hill and something said did you not say you would find the squirrel I said where would I find him he says now God being my solemn judge with his word here I'm a man of 50 years old a preacher of the Gospel standing in the Pulpit something said look under that little piece of bark I said Lord I wouldn't doubt you for nothing I walked up and picked up the bark and there was no squirrel there he said just before I did it something said what if he's not there what if you've been fooling yourself what if this is just a mental conception what if this is just something in your head Church Satan is always there to try and knock us off of our faith to knock us off of our confession to knock us off of our profession to knock us off of the experience we've had with God he's always there God's talking to him and Satan's right there as well what did he say I said oh he'll be there I picked it up and there was no squirrel there he says I looked down with amazement and I saw a little bitty piece of graay sticking out from under a leaf I pulled it up and there laid the squirrel making it just exactly right what he said to do he says down the hill I went and told them about it and we rejoiced and when I come to the car Charlie standing there in Banks they were talking and said wasn't it strange that Tony would say a thing like that in his prayer as well as he loves brother brandham and why would he doubt his word and say that brother Bram says this see he just had to say it that way for God knew that I would stand in the Pulpit this morning and claim the same thing cuz what would have happened is he would have told the story exactly right and people would have said you've only got six squirrels where's the seventh he said brother Tony had to cut get me to go back and get that seventh one so that when I stood here I'd have a witness that all seven were there he says you've got to watch what man says and then what God says because what God says is true now here's the thing brother baham is going through this whole experience right this is creative word coming out of his lips and he he says to God he says God is this my new ministry is this a change in my Ministry now remember what is Ministry serving serving this is not a new gift for brother Bram to prop himself up to create some new wave amongst the people to build himself a huge Church to get massive donations or draw people to him this is to serve with that gift so God is doing this for somebody else's sake not for his right now I want to go to the story of sister Hatty Wright now we know this story I know but I don't think that everybody recognizes the full story and so I want to talk about her sacrifice this morning as we're finishing this thought I'm working on both ends because it just it just ties it together so beautifully now he says that poor Widow so he's talking about sister hadti right now he he's comparing her to the Widow that Jesus saw that gave everything to God Amen by way of an offering he says that poor Widow sister hady Wright who had just told me she had tried to give to this church $50 on a pledge to help build a new church and brother Robert Roberson wouldn't take it and only let her give 20 of it and I said to myself when she was speaking I'll give her back the 20 that's what we think isn't it I got it she doesn't I'll give it back to her he says but God said to me in my heart now not by Vision in my heart so this is just a thought from God drops down and says what when Jesus was standing watching the Widow put in three pennies where were those thousands of dollars were laying what would you have done I saidwell I would have if I would have been standing there I would have said we don't need it sister we got plenty of money but Jesus never said it he let her go on and do it because he knew what was down the road so he's speaking of the woman in jesus' time Jesus knew what was down the road now he flips it back he says so help me God is my solemn judge God knew what was down the road for her had he Wright who had give the $20 and I rub my hand in my pocket to get my pocketbook to give her $20 back and say sister hadie but he said don't do it and then just a few minutes when the question is brought up about Jehovah Gyra she said that's nothing but the truth he says it come from a poor widow woman's heart God knowing she'd ask future tense the greatest thing that could be done so she makes this sacrifice she does something for God unnecessary nobody asks her to do it she offers 50 they only take 20 20 bucks then will be about $200 now and brother Bram says I was going to give her back the money and God says don't do it why she'd done her part under inspiration God said don't do it I'm working don't mess this up he knew that he had something greater for her down the road you I like I said before I can see where brother brandom's coming from sometimes we see people that make the least give the most and we say they ought not to do that but God sees what's coming down the road God leaves no debts unpaid God leaves no debts unpaid amen and don't think that God doesn't see it he sees every penny he sees every penny now let's go back to the main story of had Wright because remember what happens is brother bram's sitting at the table and he's working from both ends now okay brother Ram says is this my new ministry is this what's going on and now she has a need in her life and he says he says when I was sitting at the table eating dinner I've been explaining what faith was he's explaining about that scripture we talked about and sister Hattie was sitting way back out towards another room she didn't have much to say never does it's not always about who's talking he says and while we were talking I'd say if the Lord showed me a vision that something was to take place then I would could say it and that's what raises my faith I said when the Lord shows me what will take place then I've Got Confidence it's going to be that way but remember under this new ministry he's not getting Visions God's telling him what to say and then he does it he speaks it he said I've been telling them about these this experience about the speaking the squirrels into existence and I said do you know know what I want to ask you something brother Banks Woods was sitting next to me at the table and then sister hadie sitting way back the boys were sitting there Mrs Right Mr Right and shall be sitting back to my left he says now listen don't miss this I'm going to show you the sovereignty of God and while we were talking they said I want to ask you something what put those squirrels there there's no squirrels in the woods I'd hunted and hunted I'm not the best of Hunter but I've hunted since I was a little boy I had hunted close and they were in the most ridiculous places and in the most ridiculous way I could call them I said what put them there I said I wonder if it is that my Ministry is fixing to take a change that the god of Abraham is confirming his promise as he did to Abraham when he was up on top of the mountain and he needed a sacrifice instead of his son he says Jehovah Gyra God my provider he says performed a miracle and placed a ram a 100 miles back he was three days journey an ordinary man can walk 25 miles a day he says then he lifted up his eyes and saw the mountain a far off and then went to the mountain and up on top of the mountain and he says a a whole Ram back in there he says while a ram back in there a sheep wild animals would have killed it and then up on top of the mountain there's no water how did that Ram get up there what happened remember Abraham's on top of Mount Mariah and he's going to sacrifice his son by God's command and God's testing him he doesn't ever want you to sacrifice your children that's why he destroyed the Canaanites but he was testing Abraham's faith and then as Abraham raises the knife God says hold Abraham I know that that you believe me now and then he looked in the thicket and there was a ram a male sheep caught in the thicket by his horns and brother BR saying how does a sheep get caught in the horns and not get torn apart by some animal he says God spoke that Ram into existence he says God needed a sacrifice to prove to Abraham that he was Jehovah Gyra so this was a proving to Abraham of who God was he says the very God of creation spoke a ram into existence now it wasn't a vision the ram wasn't a vision he said he killed the ram blood came out of that animal it wasn't a vision it was a ram and I said that same God hallelujah that Jehovah Gyra he's just as much Jehovah Gyra today as he was on the mount with Abraham he can still produce an animal to his glory those squirrels were not a vision I shot them blood came out of them I dressed them and ate them they weren't Visions they were squirrels I said that same Jehovah Gyra now watch what he says this is all about he says trying to get his promise over to me number one in my thickness and dullness of mind he could speak my need into existence the same as he could speak Abraham's need into existence now let's stop here when those scrs appeared who spoke the word did God speak it no he said you pick it you speak it you choose where they go how many all these things and so brother bradam speaks it and like he said I put him in the most ridiculous places where no squirrels would ever be now God tells him to speak he speaks and whatever he says happens God does It On The Backs side of the Wilderness in private just like he did with Abraham but notice brother Braham says he's speaking my need into existence did Brother random need squirrels he had 107 114 that year is he going to die of hunger if he doesn't get those squirrels no the squirrels are not brother bram's need what he needs is faith in the oper Iration of the gift that God's given him he's got to have faith that when God tells him to do something and speak something it will happen if he speaks it according to inspiration right so what is it this is the literal creative word of God flowing through the lips of a man and it is the same power as if Christ himself spoke it brother says the need I have is the faith what he's saying is the faith to speak and believe what he tells me to speak what is it it's the Elijah anointing this is Malachi 4:5 stepping into maturity this is where I started with the widow woman is because that's the Elijah anointing it goes to someone in need it's not for itself it goes to someone that's in need God's preparing for brother Brandon for something far greater than squirrels squirrels is where he starts to prove it but God wasn't showing off to brother brandham God doesn't clown around brother brandham said he's not showing off just saying hey look what I can do he's saying no there's a purpose behind this and he's speaking a need into he's meeting the need that's in brother braham's Ministry in brother braham's life because he's about to step into his greatest role which is what Revelation 10:7 he's about to open the seals under the inspiration of the holy spirit with the angel standing there he's about to step into that fullness of the son of man Ministry the revealing of God in this age and he's got to have faith that as God tells him to move and speak that whatever he says is going to happen and he's tying it to scripture all the way through there and brother Ram says I had no more than said that that sister hadie sitting there crying now hadn't said a word and she said that's nothing but the truth he says she said the right thing you know what that tells me it matters what we say and it matters that we say it in the first place you sit in church and say the amens don't matter the amens matter when you say praise the Lord when you give him worship and praise it matters because when you say the right thing then God comes right behind it and he works in your life amen he said she said just like Banks said down there I heard her voice he says as it what that anointing swept from my ears like up into the woods Mrs Wright sitting back there with her little girl was trying to interpret what EAS said I couldn't hear Mrs Wright that super anointing swept over me and said tell Hattie that she's found Grace in the sight of God who would have thought who would have thought you say that's nothing but the truth and God comes down and says you tell her she can have he says who would have thought said tell her to ask whatever she will now what does he say God says then you speak it by this gift into existence there's the need he says whatever she askthe it into existence I looked at sister Hattie he says this is the first time it was ever performed on a human being and I said sister Hattie ask what you will God's going to give it to you what do you think he said does it get into you seven times he had confirmed it by an animal seven is God's complete number and now here's the first time on a human being and he what did he choose some great Aristocrat a great noted Minister he said a poor little widow woman that could hardly write her name he says God knows what he's doing what is it Elijah's back to the Widow again he said ask what you will and had he said to me brother Brandon what do you mean I said ask anything your heart desires and it shall be produced right here that you'll know that the Lord God Of Heaven answers and his scriptures are true not that you'll know that I'm his Prophet not that you'll know I have a great ministry he's saying that you'll know that God's real remember he said God does things real he says my first time with the new gift he says my first anointing he said I could hardly hear her she looked around we had been talking about her little crippled sister and I said oh no doubt in my heart within a few minutes little Edith will be jumping to the glor glory of God a little crippled girl there he said surely she's going to ask for that Hade looked around all around and she said brother Bill my greatest desire is for the Salvation of my two boys he says why there couldn't have been a greater thing she could have asked for $10,000 she would have got it what if it would have been some millionaire would have asked her for another million he says but God knew what she was going to ask for now brother B in the service he has all eight Witnesses stand up they're all in the service he says is this true or not and all eight of them stand up and say this is true this is what happened he said I ask he said ask anything you want to cuz God has given it to me to give it to you some great man no God had to work and give him his need so that he could work for somebody else's he said God has give it to me to give it to you whatever you want she said her boys was beginning to go off on the teenage tantrums and she said the salvation of my two boys I said by the will of God by by the power of God I give you in the name of Jesus Christ your desire he said and her two boys shook under the power of God that whole building trembled Banks fell into his plate brother Banks Woods fell into his plate he said shall be grabbed and Hade screamed till you could hear her for two blocks and them two boys with tears rolling down their cheeks rece received exactly what she asked for right then he said the first time it was ever used on a human being ask what you will and it shall be given unto you her boy sitting there with her this morning what would she have asked what if she would have asked for the healing of her little sister what if she would have asked that that little girl would have been healed but there two boys lost he says what if he says but then a few minutes when the question is brought up about Jehovah Gyra she said that's nothing but the truth and it came from a poor widow woman's heart God knowing she'd ask the greatest thing that could be done here's the end of that quote I read it earlier he said as long as there is a heaven when the stars is gone when there's no more moon no more Earth no more sea then boys shall live on through eternity with the same Jehovah Gyra who gave them the immortal promise he says his promises cannot fail God was working on both ends church he gave brother Braham the desire of his heart six squirrels out in the backs side of the desert and he was doing he was preparing for him a greater way to meet the needs of the people in the expansion of his ministry and then God sees sister Hattie now he sees her need and he says give and she gives $200 in today's dollars tries to give 500 they don't take it she gives $200 that she really didn't need to do but God put it on her heart what to put her in the same frame of mind as that widow woman in zarap and that widow woman in Jesus day puts her in the same position and then what does he do he's working with his Prophet he's working with his daughter and now there's a junction that happens remember brother bradam said when the word and the spirit meet something happens and he sends his Spirit their way and brother brandham starts to what speak into her life and he says you say it it'll happen and he does and those two boys are saved remember brother BR would have this happened five times in his life and the last time remember what happened he says it's five he says it's F Ai and g a c e Grace what happened remember was he was talking to his wife and one of his sons needed a spank and he said I just can't do it and she said yeah but you don't have to put up with it and she slammed the door in his face remember and the Holy Spirit came down and he said and the Holy Spirit said to brother Braham she should not have done that he says now go tell her and he went and he told sister ma about it she said he said honey I love you he says but the Holy Spirit didn't like that and he says he's going to judge you and she' had a little cyst on her ovary for years 15 years and it started to grow it had been dormant it had been nothing going on with it and it started to grow and it grew and it grew and it grew and by the time it got to the end she said I can't even bear to have clothes rubbing up against it cuz it was so big and hanging off her side remember brother Bram goes to God it's not for him now it's for her and he says Lord she's been faithful faithful faithful everything that I do he says she washes my clothes she puts food on the table she doesn't complain when I'm gone all these different times he said and then I come home and I go off on a hunting trip and She lays out my hunting clothes for me to leave he said she's been faithful and he said Lord would you touch her let it not be malignant and the Holy Spirit comes down and he says you say and it'll happen and brother ramam said before the doctor touches it it will be gone and he's not even there in the hospital when it happens and they're prepping her for surgery remember and it's hanging off of her side down to the the operating table and they've got it draped and the doctor reaches for it and when he pulls it back there's nothing there and so he goes to look at the other side CU in surgery they always Mark and it's marked where it's supposed to be but there's nothing there so we missed it went to the other side nothing there they didn't operate on her God immediately spoke it out of existence he can bring it in church he can take it out Jehovah Gyra The God Who answers working on both sides to prepare a prophet to speak a word of faith to where he would trust that when he spoke it would happen amen brother Bram would say this as we're closing this morning he he's talking about all the events of of speaking these squirrels into existence and he's thinking on that scripture we read in Matthew and this was what God said he says and it God after I was speaking there for a while just inside myself just thinking till I became so conscious of something near till I was talking to someone he felt the presence and then he it started speaking and something said to me that's in the atonement everything that that he's talking about in Matthew 11 speak to the mountain he says is in the atonement under the blood of Jesus Christ this is your right he says for if a man or a woman is so consecrated and surrendered to God that God just moves in and uses their voice it isn't the man speaking it's God that speak God that's in him speaking I thought that's right and something said to me what do you he says who do you think he says how do you see those Visions on the platform how do you see those Visions out there what is it do you think it's your own wisdom that you could predict something that would happen every time to the letter do you think it's you speaking would you think sometime when the Holy Spirit gets into a message and you don't know what to say what is it speaking then he says what is it when a man will speak with a tongue he doesn't know nothing about what is it that will interpret that same tongue neither one of them knowing anything about it he says is it the individual or is it the spirit of the Living God I said that's true I see it it's God that's speaking he says all the church needs is a step closer to him more of a consecrated life to live with him church I say Lord help me live closer help me to live more consecrated help me to sanctify my life a new amen not for power but to meet a need oh to meet a need we talk about third pull third PLL is not us going and doing it's him telling us and then not speaking every single time brother brandham never used that third pole anointing unless God told him to do it and he only did it five times in those last six years of his life five times that's it we're not going to be running around but I tell you when he moves and he inspires and he anoints when you speak it's the same as him speaking because it's his voice working through you but I would say this as we start to close he's speaking of Abraham now when Abraham sitting in the door of his tent PLS of mammory and God comes to him he says while that old aged Saint was sitting there with his head down praying no doubt it was then when he lifted up his head and he saw three men coming towards the tent oh he jumped quickly it must have been the spirit that said go to them he says you know there's something about Spirit-filled people that recognizes the presence of God I don't know why it is but it must be that they have something in them that magnetized them to that spirit of God he says and he recognized that there was something while Abraham went to meet them he turned them aside and said come in and sit down sit under the oak a little while let me fetch a wa little water and wash your feet I'll give you a morsel of bread and just rest a little bit then you may go on your way oh when he set him down there though they didn't look any different from any other men because they were dressed dust on their clothes and come from some other country probably their feet Dusty their clothes ragged but Abraham knew inside there there was something real the spirit declared it he he says why why did Abraham how did he notice it he says he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time that he could recognize right from wrong all the time he says that's the way the Christian ought to do today is keep yourself prayed up under a spiritual atmosphere what does that look like brother John I'm glad you asked always never seeing the bad side looking to the good side side he says you are children of God expecting His blessings God if anything I want him to do for me this a prophet speaking 1960 anything God could do for him he says is open my spiritual eyes that I might recognize him and look around and see him for he's everywhere I want to see him and be so acquainted with him that I'll know him on the very first sight I'll recognize that it's God that's my heart's desire is to be be as Abraham was what is it the atmosphere of expectation brings a revelation of the presence of God remember we we read that quote where brother Braham says as they were walking on the road to am he appeared he says he says don't you notice how when you dwell on God he shows up you think on the things of God and he shows up you dwell on the Supernatural Supernatural happens why because you're in an atmosphere of expectation and then God can move right into that if the musicians would come amen I pray that we recognize his presence but I want to say this this morning you can't give anything to God that he won't take and give it back to you a h hundredfold scripture says pressed down shaken together overflowing but it's his Blessing not the one that you want but it'll be his and it'll meet the need every time I look at our sisters and we give you give sisters give mothers and you get up in the morning and you you've had poor sleep and maybe you can't do your hair the way you want and your clothes aren't exactly the way you'd like and patience is giving out and all these things God sees it because you're not doing it because your husband said so or because you're bound by a Doctrine but you're doing it because you know God has called you to that place and US Brothers we go and some of us work from morning till Dusk and even past some of us are doing two jobs and we get to the end of the day and we're tired and we're worn out and then we go and we come to church and we worship or we come to church and we work as the case may be and you think is is he in it all does he see it all I say he does he recognizes every sacrifice you make but recognize that sometimes your sacrifice is going to meet the need of somebody else and God will let you go through something just to help somebody else and sometimes he'll put you through something so that as your faith Rises somebody else can get the the same thing brother Matt was sharing with me actually brother Chad we'll start with brother Chad brother Chad was sitting down at the table the other day so you know this isn't about the ministry and Mary Beth's been having trouble with her eyes she not being able to see at school and she said dad I'm going to have to go to the doctor and I'm going to have to get glasses you know what he said no no no you don't we don't have to do that because his other daughter Haley had had this happen before and he prayed and her eyes were made perfect ly whole so you know what they did around the family altar at the table they prayed and they said Lord Mary Beth's eyes will be perfect you know what she did she went to the optometrist you know what Mary Beth's eyesight is 20 over two hallelujah thank you Lord like that Jehovah Gyra it's not about me it's not even about you it's about he came to me Jehovah Gyra is about you recognizing why he's coming to you because he comes to his children every single time last service I preached on brother brandham stomach issue or a couple Services you ago you know I'm brother Brandon and he had that stomach trouble for decades decades and it was only healed in the last few months of his life brother Matt came up to be prayed for he said I've suffered with a sour stomach for 15 years and he'd wake up in the middle of the night and he'd have a bottle of Tums next to his bed because he couldn't get back to sleep unless he took Tums we prayed the prayer of faith and he hasn't touched a Tums since Jehovah Gyra God who answers you know why so that when your need arises you can say he did it for brother Chad he did it for sister Elsa he did it for brother Matthew he can do it for me you look at Justine and and Rebecca in their eyesight slowly getting better after what accepting the prayer of faith some is this some is this but he's faithful amen let's stand if we would sometimes we've got to get a testimony to give somebody else faith for their testimony amen Elijah didn't whine and complain Lord I've been so comfortable next to the brook Cher Just sitting here on in the shade as I get served day in and day out no he's a minister a minister is supposed to be serving not just be served and God moved him out of his comfort put him in a place of hunger so that he could go to a woman and give her food that would last her until the drought was over and then sometimes he's working in our life the exact same way he'll pull things back just so that he can move us into a place where we can help somebody else out we can give him that boost we can give him that support sometimes he's saying you got to sacrifice first just to prove you trust me and then watch what I come around and do on the other side amen he's working on both ends to bring us to a place where what we can step into that manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God Amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I say hallelujah this morning Lord I Thank You for Your goodness Lord I Thank You for Your Presence I thank you for your healing power I thank you for your provision
