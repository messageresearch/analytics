[41:26] second samuel
[41:27] chapter 23
[41:29] ii samuel 23
[41:32] and just by way of a brief update i
[41:33] haven't talked about brother ron spencer
[41:35] very much lately but i spoke to him
[41:37] yesterday and he gave me an update
[41:39] personally and he said i could share
[41:40] this with the church so he said they've
[41:42] they he just had a ct scan that showed
[41:44] that he has a small brain bleed and
[41:46] evidence of a recent stroke
[41:48] so that what they're doing is the
[41:49] medications they're giving them to help
[41:51] treat his cancer causing other problems
[41:53] in his body so they still they see him
[41:56] as a miracle
[41:57] that he's still alive stage four cancer
[41:59] after more than two years at this point
[42:02] um
[42:03] but obviously there's complications
[42:05] with all that's going on and these
[42:06] things so um he's in a battle still amen
[42:09] he needs our prayers but uh he's by no
[42:11] means given up
[42:12] um if he'd given up it had been over
[42:14] years ago but we're years into a stage
[42:17] four cancer patient and yet he's still
[42:18] there he's still preaching this morning
[42:20] amen so we pray that god will be with
[42:22] them and bless them and keep them amen
[42:25] god bless you second samuel 23 and verse
[42:27] 14 says and david was then and unhold
[42:30] and the garrison of the philistines was
[42:32] then in bethlehem
[42:33] and david longed and said oh that one
[42:35] would give me drink of the water of the
[42:37] well of bethlehem which is by the gate
[42:39] and the three mighty men break through
[42:41] the host of the philistines and drew
[42:42] water out of the well of bethlehem that
[42:44] was by the gate and took it and brought
[42:46] it to david
[42:48] nevertheless he would not drink thereof
[42:50] but poured it out unto the lord
[42:52] and he said be it far from me o lord
[42:54] that i should do this is not this the
[42:56] blood of the men that went in jeopardy
[42:57] of their lives therefore he would not
[42:59] drink it these things did these three
[43:03] mighty men and then god bless you may be
[43:05] seated this morning
[43:07] and then this morning we're deviating
[43:08] from a regular regularly scheduled
[43:10] program and i want to take a title this
[43:12] morning of knowing where to satisfy your
[43:15] thirst amen and we see here a story of
[43:17] david it's a very well known one brother
[43:19] branham covers it ex you know
[43:21] extensively in the message and he talks
[43:23] about this thirst that david had and
[43:25] it's interesting that david's thirst
[43:27] comes up for a specific place and a
[43:29] specific thing in a time of desperation
[43:31] when he's got the philistines on one
[43:32] side when he has saul on the other he's
[43:34] he's running for his life and he's been
[43:36] running for years now and it seems like
[43:38] everything is aligned against him
[43:40] everybody's out to get him he has no
[43:41] place of rest he has no place of peace
[43:43] everyone's trying to separate his head
[43:45] from his shoulders and he gets to a
[43:47] place where he sits down on a rock and
[43:49] he says i just want to drink
[43:52] from a well that i know of
[43:55] i want to drink from a specific well
[43:58] there's a place i've been before and
[44:00] there's a drink that i want from that
[44:02] place and no other place will do it this
[44:04] morning for him and then he wanted to go
[44:06] to a place that he had an experience
[44:08] with that it was a place that was known
[44:10] to him he did not know this well because
[44:13] he'd read a story about it in the in the
[44:15] local scrolls he had not heard a sermon
[44:17] about the great well of bethlehem he had
[44:19] not had a friend tell him about this but
[44:21] this was a place where david had been
[44:23] where he had been raised where he had
[44:25] found his rest where he had found his
[44:27] thirst quenched before and then it was a
[44:29] place where he knew that it was going to
[44:31] do something for him and he'd never
[44:33] found anything else like it in all of
[44:35] his travels and all of his wandering and
[44:37] all of his worrying and all of his
[44:38] running away from things he had never
[44:40] found a well like that well of bethlehem
[44:42] amen he'd had a personal experience with
[44:45] the well at bethlehem and there were
[44:46] many wells in bethlehem but there was
[44:48] one outside the gate that he knew was
[44:50] the place that he could find the
[44:52] greatest refreshment amen
[44:54] david had drunk from that well before
[44:55] until his thirst was quenched he had
[44:57] drunk until he didn't need anything more
[45:00] amen he had been at that well and there
[45:01] was something about that well that in a
[45:03] time of need he said i want the water
[45:05] from that well and somebody was there to
[45:08] listen to him it meant three men that
[45:10] could take the thought of david and turn
[45:12] it into their will and their action and
[45:14] they went and they fought for 25 miles
[45:17] back to back to back three of them
[45:19] together
[45:20] and what did they do they went and they
[45:22] fought their way all the way there and
[45:23] they fought the way all the way back and
[45:25] on the way back they had to held what
[45:27] that bucket with water in it while
[45:29] holding a sword on the other end and
[45:30] cover each other's backs while they
[45:32] fought another 25 miles back
[45:34] amen they put their lives on the line
[45:36] they put their blood on the line and
[45:38] they come up to david and they give him
[45:40] something that he's been wandering that
[45:42] he's been he's been wanting so badly
[45:44] brother branham said this he says there
[45:46] was no water like bethlehem had
[45:48] david used to think when i take my sheep
[45:51] and start out on a morning i go by that
[45:53] old well and drink oh how cool and how
[45:55] sweet and how it quenched the thirst he
[45:58] says now his throat isn't going yet
[46:00] anointed
[46:01] why it's anointed to call for something
[46:04] there's a thirst there that's anointed
[46:06] it's an anointed thirst sometimes we
[46:08] have thirst and they're not an anointing
[46:10] that we want but there is a thirst that
[46:12] is anointed to cause you to call for an
[46:14] experience that you've already had that
[46:16] there is something to pull from that's
[46:18] known in your life to bring you to a
[46:20] place where your thirst can be quenched
[46:22] this morning amen
[46:23] he says oh if i only had a drink of
[46:26] water and he screamed out in despair oh
[46:28] if somebody would bring me a drink again
[46:31] from that old well yonder at bethlehem
[46:33] oh after dreaming of all his childhood
[46:36] days and the victories and seeing him in
[46:38] the place where he's sitting here beside
[46:40] the fires he screamed oh somebody could
[46:43] bring me
[46:44] water from bethlehem and he wasn't
[46:46] satisfied with the little desert streams
[46:48] and the little springs that he ran
[46:50] across from he wasn't satisfied with the
[46:52] warm brackish water in the waterskins
[46:54] that they were carrying around
[46:56] he needed something from a place that he
[46:58] knew was clean and pure
[47:00] that well of bethlehem fed the rest of
[47:02] the city fed the rest of israel even
[47:05] beneath it it was a seep it was a it was
[47:07] a source of water for everyone beneath
[47:09] it
[47:10] it was a place where everything else
[47:12] flowed from amen
[47:14] somebody might have come up to him and
[47:15] said david i took this from the last
[47:17] well we passed take that drink that
[47:20] and david would take one sip and he'd
[47:22] say but it's not the same as the water
[47:24] from bethlehem's well outside the gate
[47:26] it might be water and it might keep me
[47:28] alive for a while but it doesn't satisfy
[47:30] the thirst that i have inside of me
[47:32] hallelujah
[47:33] what did he say there's a water i need
[47:36] and i won't stop until i get it
[47:38] amen
[47:39] and yet when those men put their lives
[47:41] on the line it's so humbled david that
[47:43] he poured it out on the ground and he
[47:45] said this is a sacrifice to the lord
[47:47] because my need would never should never
[47:49] put somebody's life in danger
[47:52] but there was still a longing there that
[47:53] wouldn't be quenched amen
[47:55] even when it was brought to him he
[47:57] wouldn't do it he gave it as a sacrifice
[47:58] to god amen it's no matter nobody writes
[48:01] of thirst the way david does in the
[48:03] scriptures nobody writes about how how
[48:05] hungry and how thirsty is and what is it
[48:07] always about it is always about being in
[48:09] the presence of god amen he's always
[48:12] seeking he said there's one thing have i
[48:14] desired amen that i would dwell in the
[48:16] house of the lord his desires always to
[48:19] go back to what god had for him amen
[48:22] god takes us to places of dryness god
[48:24] takes us to places of trial god takes us
[48:27] to places where we have a need or a
[48:29] hunger and then what does he do is he
[48:31] sits back and he sees where we're going
[48:33] to go to satisfy it right he sees where
[48:35] you're going to run he sees what you're
[48:37] going to pray for he sees what you're
[48:38] going to lean towards he sees what
[48:40] you're going to be drawn to to see if
[48:42] you have an experience that is going to
[48:43] pull you back to him or if you've just
[48:45] been flighty and you've just been
[48:47] flirting with things and you'll go to
[48:48] anything that you think will make you
[48:50] feel better
[48:52] david said in psalm 63 1 he says oh god
[48:54] thou art my god
[48:56] david had a god that was personal to him
[48:59] he says early will i seek thee let me
[49:01] put it this way the first place i'm
[49:03] gonna go is you god i'm not gonna wake
[49:06] up and go to somebody else something
[49:08] else i'm not gonna wake up in the
[49:09] morning and go to my phone or go to this
[49:11] but early will i seek you god i'm gonna
[49:14] seek you first thing in the morning
[49:15] first thing when trials come first thing
[49:18] when tribulations come first thing when
[49:20] sickness comes i'm going to come to you
[49:21] god i'm going to seek you first
[49:23] my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh
[49:26] longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty
[49:28] land where no water is
[49:31] who takes them here it's god
[49:34] satan doesn't take david here it's god
[49:36] testing and trying improving his servant
[49:38] so he can be king leader
[49:40] what is he seeking he says to see thy
[49:42] power and thy glory so as i have seen
[49:45] thee in the sanctuary david had seen
[49:48] god's power and glory this was not just
[49:50] a theory this was not just an idea to
[49:52] david he knew that god was real and he
[49:54] says god i'm seeking that god not a god
[49:58] on the scrolls not god in the bible but
[50:00] god that is real in the sanctuary where
[50:02] he is present in my life today
[50:05] why because thy loving kindness is
[50:07] better than life my lips shall praise
[50:10] thee amen he is not praising a
[50:12] theoretical god he's not looking for a
[50:14] god that somebody else spoke of he's not
[50:16] looking for the god of william branham
[50:18] but he's looking for the god that he has
[50:20] experienced in his own life in his own
[50:22] church services in his own family in his
[50:24] own relationships and his own trials and
[50:26] tribulations he's looking for the god
[50:28] that has always been there and he's
[50:30] saying i'm going to find that thing that
[50:32] i know is real and i won't stop until
[50:34] until i get exactly what i'm looking for
[50:36] amen he's experienced a place where god
[50:39] is god
[50:40] right not just a god on pages but he's a
[50:43] god that moves and acts in our lives
[50:45] that leads us and guides us and provides
[50:47] and heals and delivers
[50:49] and man he's looking for a reality
[50:52] but we read here how david's thirsty
[50:54] it's okay to thirst sometimes satan
[50:57] takes us and we we say i want more i
[50:59] don't have enough and he turns that into
[51:01] a guilt trip in our lives where we think
[51:03] that we've done something wrong but the
[51:05] thirst just shows that there's something
[51:06] waiting to satisfy it you cannot thirst
[51:09] for something that doesn't exist
[51:11] thirst is a survival mechanism to let
[51:13] you know that you're lacking something
[51:15] and you need to get it filled up again
[51:17] right so don't let the devil beat you
[51:19] down if you're thirsty just make sure
[51:21] that he doesn't drive you to something
[51:23] that won't satisfy your thirst in the
[51:24] long term amen it's okay to say god i
[51:27] need more of you it's a it's good to say
[51:29] god i don't have enough of you we don't
[51:31] have enough of him do we we're still
[51:33] here we're still here we're still
[51:35] fighting a fight we're still in a battle
[51:37] so we need more of him every single day
[51:39] amen
[51:41] he says thus will i bless thee while i
[51:43] live i will lift up my hands in thy name
[51:46] my soul shall be satisfied as with
[51:48] marrow and fatness and my mouth shall
[51:50] praise thee with joyful lips
[51:52] when i remember thee upon my bed and
[51:55] meditate on thee in the night watches
[51:58] you can't remember something you've
[51:59] never had
[52:01] you've got to have something to remember
[52:03] when you're laying down at night you
[52:04] ought to have something to remember of
[52:06] god's goodness and grace to you that
[52:08] makes him a reality in your life amen he
[52:10] had events in his life that he could
[52:12] meditate on to know that god was a
[52:14] reality to him and to his family and to
[52:16] the little army in the little gathering
[52:18] that he had around him amen he wasn't
[52:20] flying by theory when he talked about
[52:22] this but he was looking back to a place
[52:24] where his thirst had been quenched by
[52:26] the reality of a living god in his life
[52:28] he says what because thou has been my
[52:31] help my help
[52:33] not aberchy's help not anybody else's
[52:36] help but my help lord you've been my
[52:38] help and i'm gonna meditate and dwell on
[52:40] that that's what i'm gonna focus on is
[52:42] god when you have answered my prayers
[52:44] when you have come on the scene when you
[52:45] have proved yourself to be real in my
[52:47] life he says therefore in the shadow of
[52:49] thy wings will i rejoice my soul
[52:51] followeth hard after thee thy right hand
[52:53] upholdeth me but those that seek my soul
[52:56] to destroy it shall go into the lower
[52:58] parts of the earth they shall fall by
[53:00] the sword there shall be a portion for
[53:02] foxes but the king shall rejoice in god
[53:06] amen are you going to rejoice in god it
[53:08] will be because he has made himself real
[53:11] and your thirst has been quenched that
[53:12] which you have seek sought after that
[53:14] which you have meditated on has become a
[53:16] reality yet again in your life
[53:19] everyone that swears by him shall glory
[53:21] but the mouth of them that speak lies
[53:24] shall be stopped
[53:25] and then david had a longing i have a
[53:28] longing
[53:29] longing for jesus amen
[53:31] just to be near him to feel his presence
[53:33] i have a longing in my heart for him
[53:35] that's what david's expressing here
[53:37] but he knows it can be satisfied that's
[53:40] the thing we have to know is that it can
[53:41] be satisfied and not because somebody
[53:43] told us but because we've been satisfied
[53:45] before
[53:46] and we're looking for that same
[53:48] satisfaction in our life
[53:50] listen to what brother brown says he
[53:51] says
[53:52] and david surrendered himself
[53:56] and said my soul is thirsting like i was
[53:59] in a dry land where there's no water i
[54:01] thirst for the oh god he had to humble
[54:04] himself to say that i need more that
[54:06] there is a feeling of lack in my life
[54:09] and there's something that's got to come
[54:10] forth
[54:11] right something has to be satisfied in
[54:14] my life he surrendered himself he
[54:16] humbled himself
[54:19] there you are david said i seen thee in
[54:21] thy sanctuary and my soul thirst for
[54:22] that power there you are that's the
[54:25] difference that's what makes things
[54:27] different is this thirst that god give
[54:29] you if you satisfy it with the capital w
[54:33] water
[54:34] count unto me all you that are thirsty
[54:36] come and drink from the fountains of
[54:37] life freely without money without price
[54:40] there's a fountain open in the house of
[54:42] god in the city of david
[54:44] there is the fountain that you're
[54:46] thirsting for
[54:48] there is the fountain he's not saying
[54:51] there is a fountain he says there's the
[54:53] fountain that you're thirsting for
[54:55] certainly it is don't try to pervert it
[54:57] by trying to say i'll satisfy it by
[55:00] drinking i'll satisfy it by having a
[55:02] date with this girl i'll slip out a
[55:03] little on my husband i'll go out a
[55:05] little on my wife that shouldn't apply
[55:07] to any of us by god's grace but pick
[55:09] your poison you know what you're doing
[55:11] in your life you know where you're at
[55:12] you know what you fall to when things
[55:14] get a little dry
[55:16] put your own thing there
[55:18] right
[55:19] what he says you're only heaping
[55:21] judgment you say i'm not satisfied
[55:23] brother branham no wonder he says it's
[55:25] god dealing with you god trying to bring
[55:28] you to something and you take the
[55:29] devil's suggestion and go off with it so
[55:32] we have a godly thirst but a devil's
[55:34] suggestion that comes right behind it to
[55:36] try and pervert you off of what god's
[55:37] trying to do in your life
[55:39] that's the way sorrow come that's how
[55:41] death come and that life is not life
[55:43] capital l it's death for the wages of
[55:47] sin is death but the god of it the gift
[55:49] of god is eternal life to them that
[55:51] receive it he says oh do not be deceived
[55:54] amen now we've been talking about david
[55:56] but i want to bring this down to our
[55:58] doorsteps this morning if god will help
[56:00] me to preach it because if there's one
[56:02] thing i know is that if you have a
[56:03] thirst then satan has something to try
[56:05] and make you satisfy that thirst amen no
[56:08] matter how weird how strange how unusual
[56:10] your thirst might be satan has a massive
[56:13] menu of things for you to try to satisfy
[56:15] his the thirst that you have in your
[56:16] life amen when you look around the world
[56:18] you can see all the weirdness that's out
[56:20] there from the from the from the normal
[56:22] to the completely weird it's all out
[56:24] there and what is it it is people that
[56:26] are thirsting after something and
[56:27] satan's putting the strangest things in
[56:29] front of them to try and get them there
[56:31] amen
[56:32] but as believers we're built with a
[56:34] thirst inside of us
[56:35] amen from from our very birth we're born
[56:38] with a thirst because there's an
[56:39] emptiness that needs to be filled by
[56:41] something amen as satan will try and
[56:43] pervert it it means god always has a way
[56:45] to satisfy our thirst amen
[56:47] right satan's menu is long and varied
[56:50] god's has won
[56:52] that's why we don't try god so often is
[56:54] because it's not nearly as interesting
[56:55] as satan's if you walked into a
[56:57] restaurant and they only have one thing
[56:59] on the menu who wants to eat at that
[57:00] restaurant
[57:02] but if you ever tasted that one thing
[57:04] you know why they only have one thing
[57:06] because that's the thing that you need
[57:08] that's the only thing you'll ever want
[57:09] to taste because they perfected that one
[57:11] dish to such a high level that you'll
[57:13] never think anything else is good again
[57:15] that's what god's like when you taste
[57:17] god just once when you have an
[57:19] experience with god when you have a
[57:20] satisfaction to your thirst you'll never
[57:22] go for something else again
[57:27] what is it satan's menu is long and
[57:29] buried and what happens is we get to the
[57:30] end of the day the end of the week the
[57:32] end of the year the end of your life the
[57:33] end of your marriage and you wonder how
[57:35] did i get here and it was by sampling
[57:37] everything on satan's menu
[57:40] braham says this he says how dare some
[57:41] of you it would be so little as to try
[57:43] and quench that blessed thing of thirst
[57:45] by trying to satisfy that with drinking
[57:47] smoking television running and carrying
[57:50] on and reveling around trying to satisfy
[57:52] that godly thing that god put in you to
[57:54] thirst for him you're polluting the
[57:57] fountain that god has placed in you to
[57:58] receive his spirit and you're drowning
[58:01] it
[58:02] drowning it with the things of the world
[58:04] and they do not satisfy they never will
[58:07] satisfy notice he says drowning there
[58:10] what is it you've got so much you've got
[58:12] to deluge from satan's kingdom pouring
[58:14] into your life that it drowns out
[58:16] anything good that god might happen to
[58:17] stick in there
[58:19] he says there's something in you that
[58:21] calls out there's something in you that
[58:23] longs for god and you try to satisfy
[58:25] that thirst that's in you as david said
[58:27] as the heart thirsts after the water
[58:29] broke so my soul thirsts after thee o
[58:31] god and you try to satisfy that blessed
[58:34] holy thirst that god put in you to
[58:36] thirst after him and you try to satisfy
[58:38] it with the things of the world the
[58:40] devil is trying to make you quench that
[58:42] thirst by serving him when you're an
[58:44] eagle
[58:45] you was born to be an eagle you have no
[58:47] right to try and quench that thirst with
[58:49] the things of the world god gave you
[58:51] that holy thirst to thirst after him
[58:54] blessed are they that do hunger and
[58:55] thirst for righteousness for they shall
[58:57] be filled
[58:58] what is it we allow our lives to be
[59:00] flooded with things that are not of god
[59:02] amen things that are of unbelief things
[59:04] that are of fear things that are of
[59:06] despair and then we turn to what
[59:08] entertainment and these mindless things
[59:11] and then the things of god are
[59:12] completely overwhelmed in our life
[59:14] because we're seeking such a place of
[59:16] rest and relaxation to back away from
[59:18] everything that's going on and what it
[59:20] does is it allows satan to come in like
[59:21] a flood that's what a deluge is it's a
[59:23] flood that's what causes drowning a
[59:25] flood
[59:26] right that's right
[59:28] but now you say you look at this and you
[59:30] say well brother john i'm not smoking
[59:31] i'm not drinking i'm not doing this i'm
[59:33] a believer i'm a good christian that's
[59:35] not what i do listen to the prophet's
[59:37] warning here okay he says the devil has
[59:40] another way to pervert besides saying
[59:42] well i don't drink brother brahm i don't
[59:44] smoke i don't gamble i wouldn't run out
[59:45] on my husband or my wife i live a good
[59:47] life amen
[59:49] he says but the devil has perverted that
[59:52] he lets you think to satisfy your guilty
[59:55] conscience that you go join a church and
[59:57] you're all right that's wrong that's
[1:00:00] perverting you can't get satisfaction by
[1:00:02] joining a church you only become mental
[1:00:05] why it's an intellectual affair
[1:00:09] he says you'll never be satisfied until
[1:00:11] you know him as the forgiveness of your
[1:00:14] sins where the same question is settled
[1:00:17] and you have that lovely peaceful quiet
[1:00:20] eternal everlasting fellowship with him
[1:00:23] what you've got to have peace in your
[1:00:24] soul you've got to know that the same
[1:00:26] question is set settled forever you've
[1:00:27] got to know that god is working in your
[1:00:29] life he says when the peace of god that
[1:00:32] passes all understanding has sanctified
[1:00:34] your soul and has made you a new
[1:00:36] creature in christ jesus joining church
[1:00:38] won't do it no sir that's only
[1:00:41] perverting the real cause if the devil
[1:00:43] can't get you out on those things he'll
[1:00:45] take you to this other he'll bring you
[1:00:48] right into this church sit you in those
[1:00:49] pews day by day week by week year by
[1:00:52] year and try and get that to satisfy the
[1:00:54] thirst that's in your soul
[1:00:56] he says but don't settle for nothing
[1:00:59] less
[1:01:00] than an old-fashioned experience of the
[1:01:02] new birth to be born again of the spirit
[1:01:05] of the eternal god when your soul and
[1:01:07] god unites together and you become one
[1:01:12] amen it's so late
[1:01:13] we're so close to the end of all things
[1:01:15] amen there's a hell to shun into heaven
[1:01:17] to gain as this song says it's rapture
[1:01:19] season it's resurrection season and the
[1:01:21] prophet says don't let attending church
[1:01:24] be your satisfying portion
[1:01:26] it's a part of being a believer i'm
[1:01:28] satisfied when i come to church and that
[1:01:30] i want to be in church it does something
[1:01:32] for me but he says don't let that be the
[1:01:34] thing that defines your relationship
[1:01:35] with god is the fact that you come to
[1:01:37] church and have a good time
[1:01:39] or that you come to church and have a
[1:01:40] bad time
[1:01:42] that you come to church at all don't let
[1:01:43] that be the satisfying portion but let
[1:01:45] it only be a portion of what god is
[1:01:47] doing in your life amen
[1:01:48] amen don't let satan he says dull your
[1:01:50] thirst with these things but seek what
[1:01:52] the peace and quiet and satisfaction of
[1:01:54] a new creature in christ baptized in the
[1:01:56] holy spirit
[1:01:57] he says you're trying to satisfy a
[1:01:59] hunger you're trying to satisfy a thirst
[1:02:02] with the things of the world and that
[1:02:03] thirst was not given you to be quenched
[1:02:05] by the things of the world but by christ
[1:02:07] the inexhaustible fountain of life
[1:02:10] listen to this when you try to satisfy
[1:02:12] with that perverted way tomorrow you
[1:02:15] wake up with a headache and with a
[1:02:17] heartache
[1:02:19] now he's speaking i believe of alcohol
[1:02:20] there many times but what happens is you
[1:02:23] try one thing and you wake up the next
[1:02:24] morning what is it you still have the
[1:02:26] worry you still have the fear you still
[1:02:28] have the thirst you still have the
[1:02:29] problems
[1:02:30] and then you got a couple more because
[1:02:32] you did the wrong thing in the first
[1:02:33] place right you tried to satisfy it with
[1:02:35] something else and what is it you drunk
[1:02:37] all you can drink and maybe not it's
[1:02:38] alcohol maybe it's movies maybe it's
[1:02:40] books maybe it's sports social media
[1:02:42] clothes fashion maybe you're just
[1:02:44] drinking and eating
[1:02:46] guess what when i get unhappy i tend to
[1:02:49] eat
[1:02:50] nanaimo bars
[1:02:53] i've eaten three boxes since christmas
[1:02:56] not because i'm unhappy but the problem
[1:02:58] is you eat a couple because you're
[1:02:59] unhappy and pretty soon you're eating
[1:03:00] them because you're addicted to them
[1:03:02] right
[1:03:03] right what is it we're trying to deal
[1:03:05] with something in our lives and we're
[1:03:07] going the the way except the way of god
[1:03:09] amen
[1:03:10] amen we've got a hunger you know how you
[1:03:12] know you're thirsty
[1:03:14] you keep trying something different
[1:03:17] because what if you were satisfied in
[1:03:19] your thirst you wouldn't be looking for
[1:03:21] the next great thing you wouldn't be
[1:03:22] looking for the next opportunity you
[1:03:23] wouldn't be looking for the next open
[1:03:25] window the next open door you won't be
[1:03:26] trying to kick the walls down what would
[1:03:28] you be doing you'd be satisfied because
[1:03:30] your thirst has been quenched
[1:03:32] you know you're satisfied when you're
[1:03:34] not seeking anything else but the thing
[1:03:36] that satisfied your thirst in the first
[1:03:38] place amen
[1:03:39] what is it everybody else is running
[1:03:41] around trying to find it and you're
[1:03:42] sitting there happy little humble
[1:03:44] victorious christian drinking from the
[1:03:46] word of life the fountain of life amen
[1:03:49] philippians 4 paul says this he says not
[1:03:51] that i speak in respect of want for i
[1:03:53] have learned in whatsoever state i am
[1:03:55] therewith to be content in other words
[1:03:58] he's not thirsty for anything else but
[1:04:00] what god gives him
[1:04:02] he's happy to sit there he says i've had
[1:04:04] it well he says i know both how to be a
[1:04:06] based and how to abound he says i've
[1:04:08] been humbled i've been put down and i've
[1:04:10] been raised up
[1:04:12] everywhere and in all things i am
[1:04:14] instructed both to be full and to be
[1:04:16] hungry both to abound and suffer need
[1:04:18] that's the description of a christian
[1:04:20] walk is to be satisfied with what god
[1:04:22] has given you but to always be wanting
[1:04:24] more of god
[1:04:25] right that's what we're looking for is
[1:04:27] not to seek what a greater paycheck a
[1:04:29] bigger job a greater career more
[1:04:30] influence more power more authority but
[1:04:32] to what be happy with what he has given
[1:04:34] us and keep looking for more of him and
[1:04:36] to do more for him
[1:04:38] and then he says what i can do all
[1:04:40] things through christ which strengthens
[1:04:42] me
[1:04:44] brother brown says this listen brother
[1:04:46] don't desire the big things of this
[1:04:48] world but be satisfied with what god's
[1:04:50] given you the only thing is to be now
[1:04:53] watch this
[1:04:54] be sure
[1:04:56] you're in
[1:04:57] the will of god
[1:04:59] be sure you're in the will of god
[1:05:02] amen what is it when you're not you're
[1:05:04] not satisfied if you keep trying one
[1:05:06] thing and then another and then another
[1:05:08] and then another guess what god's will
[1:05:10] doesn't lead you through 14 things
[1:05:12] god's will will take you to what you
[1:05:14] need
[1:05:15] but you got to sit and wait so many
[1:05:17] times don't you you've got to rest and
[1:05:18] say lord there's a hunger there's a
[1:05:20] thirst i'm going to you i'm not going to
[1:05:21] try anything else lord i'm coming to you
[1:05:24] and i'm going to rest and i'm going to
[1:05:25] wait until you satisfy the thirst that's
[1:05:27] in the soul of mine amen
[1:05:28] amen so the thing is though you've got
[1:05:31] to recognize
[1:05:32] that you're thirsty
[1:05:34] because we all know when we're thirsty
[1:05:36] for a natural drink don't we what
[1:05:38] happens our tongue gets thick
[1:05:41] we get little bits of spittle on the
[1:05:42] side of our mouth right brother mark
[1:05:45] right what is it our mouth feels like
[1:05:47] cotton
[1:05:48] we're going
[1:05:49] what is it we know what that thirst is
[1:05:51] but when we talk about our spiritual
[1:05:53] walk when we talk about our life how do
[1:05:55] we know what that thirst is
[1:05:56] do you recognize thirst in your life
[1:05:58] because if you don't recognize thirst
[1:06:00] you won't realize you're trying to
[1:06:01] satisfy it
[1:06:02] amen so what is it if if you don't
[1:06:04] realize that thirst looks like what
[1:06:07] sadness feeling alone depression boredom
[1:06:10] feeling unimportant on love disconnected
[1:06:12] unworthy dissatisfied that's all thirst
[1:06:16] because what if you're sad it means
[1:06:17] you're looking for what joy
[1:06:20] you're thirsty for joy but you don't
[1:06:21] have it so you're sad
[1:06:23] if you're feeling alone it's because
[1:06:24] what you don't feel a part of god
[1:06:28] so you're thirsting for what communion
[1:06:30] for fellowship that's what thirst looks
[1:06:32] like amen right what is depression
[1:06:35] depression is thirsting for what a
[1:06:37] confirmation that god has the answer
[1:06:40] right it's looking for jehovah gyra
[1:06:42] depression is when you forget that
[1:06:44] jehovah jair is there that's what these
[1:06:46] things are these are all thirsts in our
[1:06:49] lives but the thing is how many of us go
[1:06:51] to god when we're in those situations
[1:06:53] but what do we do we'll go seek
[1:06:55] something else that we can go pick up
[1:06:58] to satisfy what's going on inside of our
[1:07:00] lives amen what is it other times we're
[1:07:02] just wound up intense worried unsure
[1:07:04] feel for wondering all of these
[1:07:06] different things and what is it god is
[1:07:08] love god is peace god is joy god is rest
[1:07:11] god is satisfaction all of these things
[1:07:14] and you've got to go to that
[1:07:15] inexhaustible fountain to resolve that
[1:07:17] you're not going to get it from the book
[1:07:18] you pick up you're not going to get it
[1:07:19] from the movie you watch amen you're not
[1:07:21] going to get that from a new business
[1:07:23] opportunity you're not going to get it
[1:07:24] from a career upgrade you're not going
[1:07:26] to get it from a spouse upgrade
[1:07:28] right what is it satan's going to keep
[1:07:31] throwing sister maureen laughs
[1:07:35] brother johnny funk
[1:07:38] one of the few things on social media
[1:07:40] that i felt was worth reading brother
[1:07:41] johnny funk posts the thing he says if
[1:07:43] you want to know god's will
[1:07:45] for the mate that you had that that you
[1:07:47] should marry he says read the name on
[1:07:49] the marriage certificate that's god's
[1:07:51] will for your life whether you like him
[1:07:53] or don't like him whether you made the
[1:07:54] right decision wrong decision he says
[1:07:56] that's how you know who the right one is
[1:07:57] whoever's name is on the marriage
[1:07:58] certificate that's the right one you'll
[1:08:00] be amazed how many message brothers have
[1:08:02] gone looking for an upgrade
[1:08:04] why because they think they're allowed
[1:08:05] to do it
[1:08:07] what is it they were searching for
[1:08:08] something
[1:08:10] right
[1:08:12] listen before we moved to edmonton
[1:08:15] i was feeling led to move to edmonton
[1:08:18] and the reason to move to edmonton had
[1:08:19] nothing to do with career i had a great
[1:08:20] career i was on a high trajectory i was
[1:08:23] the youngest of a lot of things that had
[1:08:24] ever happened in that company
[1:08:26] and i made the decision to move and you
[1:08:28] know why i needed to move to edmonton
[1:08:30] i needed to be a better father and i
[1:08:32] need to be a better husband
[1:08:33] okay so there's a thirst there there's a
[1:08:35] need there and so god's pulling me to a
[1:08:38] place that will work on that right now
[1:08:40] what does satan do as soon as i make
[1:08:42] that decision
[1:08:44] now i haven't moved yet
[1:08:45] but i've decided that's what's going to
[1:08:47] happen and what is the first thing satan
[1:08:49] does
[1:08:50] gives me a new opportunity in my career
[1:08:53] i get a call from my boss on a friday
[1:08:54] afternoon he's in houston he says john
[1:08:57] don't leave the office i know it's a
[1:08:59] friday afternoon don't leave the office
[1:09:01] until i get there i've got something to
[1:09:03] talk to you about
[1:09:04] so he gets there and he sits me down he
[1:09:06] says we've just acquired so and so
[1:09:08] we want you to move to houston and run
[1:09:10] it
[1:09:11] i'd have been the youngest guy ever in
[1:09:13] the history of the company to do that
[1:09:16] what do you do satan offered me what a
[1:09:18] career upgrade to what offset the growth
[1:09:21] that i knew i needed
[1:09:23] right so i could move to edmonton and
[1:09:24] grow as a husband and father and as a
[1:09:26] christian or i could move to houston and
[1:09:29] get myself that first porsche i've been
[1:09:30] all i've been wanting
[1:09:32] right and be the big shot
[1:09:35] right be the big shot
[1:09:37] and guess what getting worse and worse
[1:09:39] as a father and husband in all
[1:09:40] probability what is it there was a
[1:09:42] thirst there and satan gave me a drink
[1:09:45] opportunity and god gave me a drink
[1:09:46] opportunity and he said you gotta pick
[1:09:49] what'd i do i told him i said sorry my
[1:09:51] family and i are gonna be moving to
[1:09:52] edmonton
[1:09:53] so you better find somebody else
[1:09:55] like that i didn't have to think about
[1:09:57] it
[1:09:57] right i didn't have to go home and pray
[1:09:59] about it why because i knew where i
[1:10:01] needed to go and so it was easy to turn
[1:10:03] down the drink that satan offered
[1:10:05] what that wasn't going to satisfy the
[1:10:06] thirst and it would have destroyed my
[1:10:08] marriage and my family in all
[1:10:09] probability right
[1:10:12] watch what the prophet says about how
[1:10:13] these things come into our lives amen
[1:10:16] he says so now how satan tries to
[1:10:18] pervert the satisfying of the soul
[1:10:20] that thirsts for the soul he tries to
[1:10:22] give you everything to satisfy and he is
[1:10:25] so deceitful in these days of perversion
[1:10:27] this is a perverted world it's a
[1:10:29] perverted race it's a perverted people
[1:10:32] so if it's anything from out of the
[1:10:34] world it's perverted can i put it that
[1:10:35] simply there's nothing out there that's
[1:10:37] sanctified and holy
[1:10:39] but watch this he says everything is
[1:10:41] perverted and as perverted so gradually
[1:10:45] until it becomes the most deceitful age
[1:10:47] that we or any human
[1:10:50] being ever lived in it's more deceitful
[1:10:52] than it ever was but watch see how he
[1:10:54] says the perversion is gradual
[1:10:56] it's not just gradual out there but it's
[1:10:58] gradual how it comes into your life
[1:11:00] because satan won't throw a bald-faced
[1:11:02] bad thing into your life will he but
[1:11:04] what does he do is he opens up the door
[1:11:06] just to crack and he sticks something
[1:11:08] through to see if you'll recognize
[1:11:10] what's really standing behind that door
[1:11:12] and if you don't then he'll open the
[1:11:13] door a little bit more and so this thing
[1:11:15] is slowly creeping into your life
[1:11:17] right and what used to be watching
[1:11:19] something on youtube has turned into
[1:11:21] what a full-blown addiction three months
[1:11:23] later where every spare moment what are
[1:11:25] you doing you're opening your phone and
[1:11:26] you're going straight to youtube
[1:11:28] why because satan brought it in
[1:11:30] gradually
[1:11:32] and all of a sudden now it's fully in
[1:11:33] your life and it's as if you have a
[1:11:35] television
[1:11:37] but you never see it why because he
[1:11:39] brought it in so gradually
[1:11:41] that you don't realize that he's now got
[1:11:43] an influence in your life
[1:11:45] and he's taken away every bit of spare
[1:11:46] time that you've got and he's directed
[1:11:48] your attention to something that will
[1:11:49] never satisfy you it's a gradual thing
[1:11:52] that's coming in it's a slow appearing
[1:11:54] in hopes that you won't recognize the
[1:11:56] big picture what's happening amen
[1:11:58] so what's the antidote to this what's
[1:12:00] the antidote to satan's plan what did
[1:12:02] david do how did david correct it how
[1:12:04] did david respond
[1:12:06] david what went back to his experience
[1:12:10] if you don't have an experience you
[1:12:11] don't have anything to fall back on do
[1:12:12] you but david had an experience of
[1:12:14] thirst being quenched so he went to the
[1:12:16] place that third quest quenched his
[1:12:18] thirst didn't he
[1:12:19] we've got to have the same thing what
[1:12:21] we've got to have an experience we can
[1:12:22] rely on so that when things get thirsty
[1:12:25] we go to the place that thirst is
[1:12:27] quenched at amen
[1:12:30] brother brown mentioned this earlier
[1:12:31] it's matthew 5 6 he says blessed are
[1:12:33] they which do hunger and thirst after
[1:12:35] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:12:38] do you notice it doesn't say that if you
[1:12:39] thirst for anything else you'll be
[1:12:41] filled
[1:12:42] you can thirst after everything that
[1:12:44] satan's got after there but no matter
[1:12:46] how much you drink you'll never be
[1:12:47] satisfied with what satan's got but if
[1:12:49] you thirst after and hunger after
[1:12:51] righteousness you're going to be filled
[1:12:53] if you'll seek the things of god if
[1:12:54] you'll seek to satisfy your things with
[1:12:56] the things of god then what god can do
[1:12:59] something for you and god has promised
[1:13:00] to meet that feeling need
[1:13:02] that's the only thing that can do it so
[1:13:04] thirst is not the problem
[1:13:06] blessed are they which hunger and thirst
[1:13:09] you're blessed if you've got a hunger
[1:13:10] you're blessed if you've got a thirst
[1:13:12] but what are you thirsting for and how
[1:13:14] do you treat your thirst
[1:13:15] that's what he's getting at bless it if
[1:13:17] you thirst but you gotta thirst for the
[1:13:19] right things because god can only answer
[1:13:20] with certain things amen
[1:13:22] amen i remember when i was in edmonton
[1:13:25] and then we moved to bc and well i was
[1:13:27] in edmonton i guess and and that was at
[1:13:29] the peak of my career really and things
[1:13:32] are great and you're making good money
[1:13:33] and you got a house and you got a sports
[1:13:35] car and you got a trucks and you're
[1:13:37] hunting and you got quads and this you
[1:13:38] got every toy
[1:13:40] you got everything that you could want
[1:13:43] and my wife and i are sitting there and
[1:13:44] we're saying there's got to be something
[1:13:46] more
[1:13:48] we think don't we brothers oh if i can
[1:13:50] make 100 grand a year i'll be happy
[1:13:52] guess what when you get to 100 then it
[1:13:54] moves to 120. when you get to 120 moves
[1:13:56] to 140 when you get to 140 it moves to
[1:13:58] 160 when you get to 160 it moves to 180.
[1:14:00] the line keeps moving why because
[1:14:02] there's nothing that says you're going
[1:14:04] to be satisfied in the word with that
[1:14:06] right so we sat there and i'm i'm again
[1:14:08] the youngest in company history in my
[1:14:10] role
[1:14:11] right i'm at the peak of my career i'm
[1:14:13] making good money i have virtually no
[1:14:15] debt things are going great and my wife
[1:14:17] and i are sitting there and we're saying
[1:14:18] is this all there is
[1:14:21] we're holy ghost-filled believers
[1:14:23] but there was a thirst for something
[1:14:24] that wasn't being satisfied with a great
[1:14:26] career
[1:14:28] and then what happened i got called to
[1:14:30] the ministry
[1:14:31] and guess what
[1:14:33] now i make
[1:14:34] less money
[1:14:35] now i'm busier than ever now i deal with
[1:14:38] more problems than i ever had to deal
[1:14:40] with and i couldn't be happier why
[1:14:42] because there is a place to satisfy a
[1:14:45] thirst that god has put in your life and
[1:14:46] where is it it is in the will and the
[1:14:48] word of god every single time no matter
[1:14:51] how much of a downgrade it might look
[1:14:53] like
[1:14:55] it often looks like a downgrade but
[1:14:57] satisfaction is worth a lot
[1:15:00] in my my first job in in bc i made the
[1:15:03] most money i'd ever made in my life and
[1:15:05] i call that job the golden handcuffs
[1:15:06] because i was miserable while making the
[1:15:08] most money i'd ever made why
[1:15:10] satisfaction counts
[1:15:12] right
[1:15:13] you've got to have that thirst satisfied
[1:15:15] and you can tell yourself all day long
[1:15:16] it's satisfied but if you're miserable
[1:15:18] guess what your thirst hasn't been
[1:15:20] satisfied amen
[1:15:22] brother brown says if you're hungry if
[1:15:24] you're thirsty god has a way to satisfy
[1:15:28] that thirst there's nothing in your life
[1:15:30] that can't be satisfied with god
[1:15:32] david said when the deep calls to the
[1:15:34] deep there's a deep to respond to it he
[1:15:37] says there's a little place in the heart
[1:15:39] that nothing will fill it but god and
[1:15:41] men are thirsting for something and that
[1:15:43] real thirst is for god and nobody's got
[1:15:45] a right to try and quench that holy
[1:15:47] thirst with giving it to the devil for
[1:15:49] the things of the world got no right
[1:15:51] trying to hide that thirst by joining a
[1:15:53] church god is the only thing that will
[1:15:55] fill it up god the holy spirit is the
[1:15:57] only thing that can satisfy that thirst
[1:15:59] jesus said blessed are they that do
[1:16:01] hunger and thirst for righteousness and
[1:16:03] it's god trying to get to the human
[1:16:05] heart
[1:16:07] and the devil tries to quench that by
[1:16:08] letting them drink their self to death
[1:16:10] or run themselves to death or do
[1:16:12] something else those that run themselves
[1:16:14] to death what
[1:16:15] going from one thing to the next thing
[1:16:17] to the next thing to the next thing and
[1:16:18] in the end you just flop down exhausted
[1:16:20] because you've tried everything except
[1:16:21] what god has offered you
[1:16:24] what is it you lay there and you die
[1:16:27] but god created man to have that holy
[1:16:29] thirst and if you won't take god then
[1:16:31] you'll have to take something else to
[1:16:33] kind of appease that calling if you're a
[1:16:36] believer you're never never going to be
[1:16:37] satisfied with what satan offers
[1:16:40] right
[1:16:41] that's what makes a man that way notice
[1:16:43] this sermon thirsting for life
[1:16:46] the the three major sermons in this
[1:16:48] thirsting for life thirst and life
[1:16:52] you got life problems
[1:16:54] this sermon's for you you got thirst
[1:16:56] problems this sermon's for you if you're
[1:16:58] thirsty for life this sermon's for you
[1:17:00] this is life this is the believer's walk
[1:17:02] here thirsting for life isn't that what
[1:17:04] we're doing we're seeking what a kingdom
[1:17:06] that is to come we're not satisfied here
[1:17:08] we're thirsting for something else
[1:17:10] but does our life reflect it amen how do
[1:17:13] we get in trouble why do we get into
[1:17:15] trouble so often
[1:17:17] because we're so far removed from a
[1:17:19] thirst quenching experience that we've
[1:17:20] forgotten that we can go there in the
[1:17:21] first place or we've never had one
[1:17:25] that's why we get into trouble we've
[1:17:27] forgotten that we were once satisfied or
[1:17:29] we've never been satisfied yet and so
[1:17:31] we're trying something in something in
[1:17:32] something in something until we can get
[1:17:34] to a place where we're satisfied why do
[1:17:36] you thirst after righteousness
[1:17:38] because when you knelt at the foot of
[1:17:39] calvary you got a taste of what his
[1:17:41] righteousness because he gave you his
[1:17:44] why do you thirst for more of the holy
[1:17:45] ghost because you got it in the first
[1:17:47] place but you're seeking more and more
[1:17:50] and more because what
[1:17:51] the road is long the hill is steep the
[1:17:54] battle is tough
[1:17:56] and you need more and more and more of
[1:17:57] him amen
[1:17:59] what is it why do you thirst for rest
[1:18:00] and peace
[1:18:02] because the day you gave your life to
[1:18:03] him that's what you experienced didn't
[1:18:04] you it's what i experienced
[1:18:06] there was a rest and a peace the day i
[1:18:08] gave my life to god that i've never had
[1:18:10] prior to that
[1:18:12] you thirst for something because you've
[1:18:14] experienced hopefully
[1:18:15] he says there's a response when you
[1:18:17] thirst there's something to quench that
[1:18:18] thirst our creeds our denomination will
[1:18:21] never satisfy that thirst let me say
[1:18:22] that in our ranks
[1:18:24] our doctrines and our creeds of the
[1:18:26] message if we want to put it that way
[1:18:28] our denomination of the message will
[1:18:30] never satisfy that though it be right it
[1:18:32] doesn't satisfied in and of itself
[1:18:35] because what the message is not at books
[1:18:37] it's not sermons but it's christ the
[1:18:39] living word and that's what you've got
[1:18:40] to meet amen he says you've got to find
[1:18:43] the reality of a living god and the only
[1:18:45] way you'll ever do it is to be filled
[1:18:47] with his spirit that is the quenching of
[1:18:50] that thirst he is the satisfying portion
[1:18:52] to his church the all-sufficient one the
[1:18:55] all-sufficient one
[1:18:58] you don't add to it and you don't take
[1:18:59] away from it why because it's all
[1:19:01] sufficient
[1:19:02] that satisfies every longing
[1:19:05] every longing
[1:19:07] sometimes the satisfaction of your
[1:19:09] longing is that he takes it away from
[1:19:11] you because it's for the things of the
[1:19:12] world
[1:19:13] right sometimes it's deliverance that's
[1:19:15] going to be satisfied he's not going to
[1:19:16] give you something to satisfy but he'll
[1:19:18] remove it completely out of your life if
[1:19:20] you love the world or the things of the
[1:19:22] world the love of god is not in you the
[1:19:23] scripture says what he's got to do
[1:19:25] surgery sometimes doesn't he
[1:19:28] he's the all-sufficient one that
[1:19:30] satisfies every longing when a man
[1:19:31] leaves the things of the world and comes
[1:19:33] to christ he finds that all sufficiency
[1:19:36] in christ when he finds christ
[1:19:39] what does the word say taste and see
[1:19:42] that the lord is good
[1:19:44] you gotta see it and you gotta taste it
[1:19:46] you gotta eat the book like john was
[1:19:48] told to right yes sir got to make it a
[1:19:50] part of you
[1:19:51] amen you've got to satisfy your thirst
[1:19:53] once
[1:19:54] that's all it's going to take and if you
[1:19:55] ever get satisfied once you'll never
[1:19:57] seek anything else again oh we move
[1:19:59] around
[1:20:00] don't we we get off the road from time
[1:20:03] to time we get our eyes off the promise
[1:20:05] we let situations creep up
[1:20:07] right what is it satan's a good good
[1:20:08] adversary
[1:20:10] brethren says we should say good things
[1:20:11] about everyone he says i'll say this
[1:20:12] about satan he's a good adversary he
[1:20:14] fights well he's a smart fighter
[1:20:17] but what do we got to do when we
[1:20:18] recognize we're off what do we do go
[1:20:20] back to that place where our thirst was
[1:20:21] satisfied amen i've seen the way people
[1:20:23] run what do they do they start with a
[1:20:25] church and it's full of what
[1:20:28] pentecost it's full of the gifts of the
[1:20:30] spirit and they go into every service
[1:20:32] and they love it because why the service
[1:20:33] is so unpredictable you never know
[1:20:35] what's going to happen and it's exciting
[1:20:37] and this one's popping up and speaking
[1:20:38] in tongues and this one's interpreting
[1:20:40] and this one's dancing around in the
[1:20:42] spirit and you just go and you have a
[1:20:43] great time
[1:20:44] but what happens is after a while you
[1:20:46] get what worn out because you gave
[1:20:48] everything you had in the service and
[1:20:49] you got nothing out of the word because
[1:20:51] they were so focused on the gifts and
[1:20:52] the moving of the spirit you had no
[1:20:54] substance and so you end up and you're
[1:20:56] worn out on the side of the road you
[1:20:57] can't win a victory church is awesome
[1:20:59] but life is horrible
[1:21:01] so when they say what well i'm missing
[1:21:02] something so what do they do they go to
[1:21:03] signs and wonders or sorry they go to
[1:21:05] mysteries don't they they go to a church
[1:21:07] where there's a deep preaching of the
[1:21:08] word and they get into the deep things
[1:21:09] of god
[1:21:11] and they stay there and it's great for a
[1:21:12] while because it's giving them some
[1:21:13] things they've been lacking the
[1:21:14] structure of the word
[1:21:16] but what happens eventually is what it's
[1:21:18] all teaching no preaching and they get
[1:21:20] dried out
[1:21:22] and all of a sudden everything's formal
[1:21:23] and they have no relationship with god
[1:21:25] it used to be a stormy romance now it's
[1:21:28] cold and formal
[1:21:29] it's a partnership not a marriage right
[1:21:31] and then what do they do they go
[1:21:33] someplace else and they find signs and
[1:21:35] wonders
[1:21:36] right they go to a church where there's
[1:21:37] great healings taking place
[1:21:40] right they're going where somebody sees
[1:21:41] visions
[1:21:43] and they get in there
[1:21:44] and again all they're doing is they're
[1:21:46] focused on everything but the god
[1:21:48] what is they're looking at the gifts of
[1:21:50] god not god himself and so they keep
[1:21:52] moving from pillar to post pillar to
[1:21:53] post trying to find something and guess
[1:21:55] what in every one of those churches god
[1:21:56] was there
[1:21:57] if they could have found him
[1:21:59] but they're so looking at what is around
[1:22:01] it rather than the one that's in the
[1:22:02] midst of it that they keep going here
[1:22:04] and there and here and there
[1:22:06] brother brown says this he says oh if
[1:22:08] the pentecostal church would only
[1:22:10] satisfy thirst in god
[1:22:12] let's put our church there
[1:22:14] forget about the pentecostals i'm not
[1:22:16] preaching to pentecostals this morning
[1:22:17] original pentecostals maybe
[1:22:19] amen right oh if
[1:22:22] evening light fellowship
[1:22:24] would only satisfy thirst in god instead
[1:22:27] of trying to follow some evangelist or
[1:22:29] some emotion or some little ism or
[1:22:31] little sensation how much better off it
[1:22:34] would be he says you'd follow the holy
[1:22:36] spirit in design in divine love instead
[1:22:38] of sensations little gifts and things
[1:22:40] like that how much better off you be god
[1:22:42] don't want you to run after gifts he
[1:22:44] wants you to thirst after him
[1:22:48] amen he's not a sugar daddy
[1:22:50] we're not gold diggers
[1:22:51] we're not going to him for what he has
[1:22:53] we're going for him for who he is that's
[1:22:54] what we're supposed to be doing we love
[1:22:56] him amen
[1:22:58] gifts take on different appearances some
[1:23:00] are gifts by the working of the spirit
[1:23:01] tongues interpretation these different
[1:23:03] things others are gifts of preaching and
[1:23:05] teaching some are get some are gifts of
[1:23:07] revelation and understanding they're all
[1:23:09] part and parcel of god but that's not
[1:23:10] god it's just an element of god it's an
[1:23:13] attribute of god as these things but
[1:23:14] it's not god himself amen your thirst is
[1:23:17] satisfied in god not in the gifts of god
[1:23:20] he said satan perverts the true nature
[1:23:22] of god and the true thirst of god of the
[1:23:25] body and soul by a lust for sin sin a
[1:23:28] perversion now we find out a person
[1:23:30] today the way they took that perversion
[1:23:32] thirst for god the thirst to be pretty
[1:23:35] sisters and all these thirsts for water
[1:23:37] they've turned that into satisfying that
[1:23:39] with drinking the thirst for joy
[1:23:41] everybody wants to have joy the thirst
[1:23:43] for fellowship all these great thirsts
[1:23:45] that god put into us that we might
[1:23:47] thirst after him
[1:23:48] god made you to thirst after him and we
[1:23:50] try to satisfy with some other kind of a
[1:23:52] thirst with some other kind of a
[1:23:53] perversion of the correct thirst see how
[1:23:55] that's in the natural
[1:23:57] he says see how it is in the spiritual
[1:23:59] we think as long as we join church that
[1:24:01] settles that's all we have to do well
[1:24:04] that is absolutely wrong no god wants
[1:24:07] you to thirst for him as the heart
[1:24:09] pantheth for the water brook my soul
[1:24:11] longs thirsts after thee oh god see now
[1:24:13] that deer was panting for the water
[1:24:15] brook what if somebody come along
[1:24:17] another buddy deer come down here and
[1:24:19] said well i'll tell you what i could do
[1:24:20] i know where there's a good mud hole or
[1:24:22] down here
[1:24:24] well the deer wouldn't want that
[1:24:26] he wouldn't that wouldn't do him any
[1:24:28] good what are people what are we
[1:24:31] pointing each other to for satisfaction
[1:24:34] are we pointing to mud holes or are we
[1:24:35] talking to the pure running word of god
[1:24:37] amen he says
[1:24:40] and there is nothing
[1:24:41] nothing
[1:24:42] i capitalize it all there is nothing can
[1:24:45] satisfy that thirst that's in the human
[1:24:47] being
[1:24:48] until god comes in
[1:24:52] god comes in
[1:24:53] you know what often happens we come into
[1:24:55] our holy ghost service we come into an
[1:24:57] anointed service we come into a service
[1:24:58] with great songs maybe we actually get
[1:25:00] some great preaching
[1:25:02] and then we have a great after service
[1:25:04] and then we have a prayer line
[1:25:06] and we say that was amazing i'm
[1:25:08] satisfied
[1:25:10] you're just in the presence of god
[1:25:14] the wheats and the tares both rejoice
[1:25:17] in the falling of the reign of the holy
[1:25:19] spirit
[1:25:20] they're both satisfied but only one
[1:25:22] walks away with the life that is being
[1:25:24] looked sought after amen
[1:25:27] what is it i'm telling you that coming
[1:25:29] into a great church coming into a great
[1:25:30] service is not what we're looking for
[1:25:33] we love it we praise god for it
[1:25:36] hallelujah i'm glad that i want to be in
[1:25:38] church
[1:25:40] but if i don't have the same experience
[1:25:41] of the holy ghost when i'm driving in my
[1:25:43] car when i'm in my prayer closet when
[1:25:45] i'm reading the message when i'm
[1:25:47] listening to another service then
[1:25:48] there's something wrong with my walk
[1:25:52] why because i'm supposed to be in a
[1:25:54] personal relationship with god not one
[1:25:56] that's dependent on everybody else in
[1:25:58] the body being around
[1:26:00] right amen
[1:26:04] spouses don't make love in public
[1:26:07] you've got to have a private
[1:26:08] relationship with god where he makes
[1:26:10] himself known to you
[1:26:11] where he can break down your defenses
[1:26:13] where he can reveal more of himself
[1:26:15] where he can have more what authority
[1:26:17] and control in your life
[1:26:19] in private not just here
[1:26:21] but the thing is you have a great
[1:26:22] service and you think that's it that'll
[1:26:24] keep me going to wednesday that won't
[1:26:26] keep us going until wednesday satan's
[1:26:28] going to keep pushing in and we're going
[1:26:30] to come up to wednesday and we're going
[1:26:31] to be trying to catch up to where sunday
[1:26:32] took us
[1:26:34] we got to keep pressing the battle every
[1:26:35] single day right
[1:26:37] there's nothing can satisfy that thirst
[1:26:39] that's in the human being until god
[1:26:41] comes in he must have it
[1:26:44] or die
[1:26:46] and no person has a right to try to hush
[1:26:48] or satisfy that holy thirst that's in
[1:26:50] him by the things of the world no sir
[1:26:52] it's ungodly to do so and if you're
[1:26:54] thirsting for god don't shake hands with
[1:26:56] the preacher and put your name on the
[1:26:57] book if you're thirsting for god there's
[1:26:59] only one thing can satisfy it and that
[1:27:01] is meet god amen if you're thirsting for
[1:27:04] god that's the only thing you can meet
[1:27:06] him is to do that
[1:27:08] now watch this
[1:27:11] and then there is a great danger also if
[1:27:13] you don't watch what you're doing in
[1:27:14] that time
[1:27:16] if you're thirsty for god be sure it's
[1:27:18] god you find amen see be sure that it's
[1:27:22] your thirst is satisfied but if satan
[1:27:25] has been able to pervert you here's the
[1:27:27] sign here's the symptom
[1:27:28] from these natural appetites that he'll
[1:27:30] do it if he can he'll simply make you
[1:27:33] try
[1:27:35] to be satisfied you've got to sit there
[1:27:37] and try and convince yourself you're
[1:27:39] satisfied
[1:27:40] that's how you know you haven't been
[1:27:41] satisfied is because you're trying to
[1:27:42] tell yourself you're satisfied while
[1:27:44] your body's screaming out i'm still
[1:27:45] thirsty
[1:27:46] and you might say no you're not no
[1:27:47] you're not
[1:27:48] why because i just had a can of cold
[1:27:50] pepsi straight out of the fridge
[1:27:53] right
[1:27:54] pepsi doesn't satisfy thirst
[1:27:56] it feels like it's satisfying as it goes
[1:27:58] down but 10 minutes later what are you
[1:28:00] doing you're going back for water
[1:28:02] because though it feels like water it's
[1:28:04] liquid though it's cold like refreshing
[1:28:06] water yet it's not water and your body
[1:28:08] is going to start screaming for
[1:28:10] something satisfying very quickly
[1:28:12] because it's not the thing that's meant
[1:28:13] to satisfy the thirst but satan will
[1:28:15] tell you drink another pepsi
[1:28:18] it'll work this time
[1:28:19] doesn't it isn't that what he does try
[1:28:21] it again
[1:28:22] take another one
[1:28:24] again and again and again and we keep
[1:28:25] going down that path over and over and
[1:28:27] over again we're not learning the lesson
[1:28:28] because we haven't what gone back to the
[1:28:30] source of our thirst quenching
[1:28:32] experience yet
[1:28:34] says the only way you can have life is
[1:28:36] to take that thirst and satisfy it by
[1:28:38] the drinking at the fountain that never
[1:28:40] runs dry that beautiful holy spirit that
[1:28:42] reigns from god out of heaven that's the
[1:28:45] way you find life is to know him
[1:28:48] listen up
[1:28:49] not know his book
[1:28:50] but to know him
[1:28:52] not to know your church but to know him
[1:28:55] not to thirst to satisfy the pastor but
[1:28:57] to satisfy the lord that's holy thirst
[1:29:01] that's what sits in you for and would
[1:29:03] you quench that thing with things of the
[1:29:05] world he says it's death it's perverted
[1:29:07] you can attend this message church you
[1:29:09] can listen to every great sermon you can
[1:29:11] go on to tim pruitt's website you can go
[1:29:13] to vindyle's site you can go to ron
[1:29:14] spencer's site donnie reagan's site at
[1:29:16] biscle site listen to every sermon
[1:29:17] they've ever heard
[1:29:19] you can read every message you can pay
[1:29:20] your tithes and offerings you can be
[1:29:21] faithful in your attendance but if you
[1:29:24] don't meet god you're lost as lost can
[1:29:26] be
[1:29:27] though you've done everything a
[1:29:28] christian should do
[1:29:29] yet if you haven't met him
[1:29:31] you're not christ-like
[1:29:33] why because you need him in you to be
[1:29:34] christ-like
[1:29:38] here's another system of unquenched
[1:29:39] thirst
[1:29:40] this one's stung
[1:29:42] i'm going to read it anyways let me tell
[1:29:44] you something
[1:29:47] when you're worshiping god in the spirit
[1:29:49] and in truth
[1:29:50] when it becomes a custom for you to do
[1:29:52] it
[1:29:53] because you think you ought to do it
[1:29:56] because you think if you don't shout or
[1:29:58] jump up and down or dance with the music
[1:30:01] your neighbor is going to think you're
[1:30:02] backslid you are drinking from a
[1:30:05] stagnated stream
[1:30:07] if the things we do in service
[1:30:09] are based on what other people are going
[1:30:11] to think about us in our spiritual walk
[1:30:13] he says you're already stagnant and you
[1:30:15] don't even know it we do not worship
[1:30:18] based on what other people think we do
[1:30:20] not worship based on the expectation
[1:30:23] right a service is not wonderful because
[1:30:25] somebody sings
[1:30:26] loudly because somebody dances because
[1:30:28] somebody shouts because somebody stands
[1:30:30] up and just starts work no no no that is
[1:30:33] not what makes a service good what makes
[1:30:35] a service good is when the word of god
[1:30:37] drops into your life and shows you what
[1:30:39] you need to do in your situation and
[1:30:41] gives you the power to step into the
[1:30:43] word and take him at it amen that's
[1:30:46] what's a good service is when he steps
[1:30:47] into our lives not when he makes us
[1:30:49] dance
[1:30:50] because why so often the dancing's
[1:30:52] supposed to come after the victory and
[1:30:53] we're dancing without it
[1:30:55] because why because the presence of god
[1:30:57] is here
[1:30:58] right it's an emotional response
[1:31:01] he says what you're worshiping god in
[1:31:03] spirit and truth he's not saying you're
[1:31:04] doing it wrong but he's saying you're
[1:31:06] doing it in the wrong way with the wrong
[1:31:08] emotive right he says right
[1:31:11] until it fills every fiber until the
[1:31:13] holy ghost holy spirit itself is
[1:31:15] bubbling in you i don't care whether the
[1:31:17] music is plain
[1:31:19] whether they're playing near my god to
[1:31:20] thee or whatever it is the holy spirit
[1:31:22] is still ringing the glory bells in your
[1:31:24] heart that satisfies that's god's
[1:31:26] satisfying portion anything less than
[1:31:29] that you're done
[1:31:31] amen do we have to have fast songs to
[1:31:33] worship
[1:31:35] do we have to have slow songs to worship
[1:31:38] do we have to have old songs to worship
[1:31:40] do we have to have new songs to worship
[1:31:42] he says it shouldn't matter what they're
[1:31:44] playing
[1:31:45] who's playing it how good the musicians
[1:31:47] are how bad the musicians are how good
[1:31:49] whether it's your favorite song leader
[1:31:51] in a church that has multiples or your
[1:31:53] least favorite what he says if the
[1:31:55] spirit of god is in there filling every
[1:31:56] fiber of your being it won't matter what
[1:31:58] they're doing up there you'll want to
[1:32:00] worship and worship him in spirit and in
[1:32:02] truth
[1:32:03] you might speak with tongues like men
[1:32:05] and angels you might give all your goods
[1:32:07] to the feed the poor you might prophesy
[1:32:09] and you might have knowledge and
[1:32:10] understand all the mysteries and all
[1:32:12] these things and you still become
[1:32:14] nothing first corinthians 13 until that
[1:32:16] satisfying something can only quench
[1:32:18] that thirst
[1:32:20] my soul thirsts for the living god like
[1:32:21] the heart panting for the water brook
[1:32:23] unless i can find it i'll perish
[1:32:26] when you get to hungering for god like
[1:32:28] that something is going to take place
[1:32:31] the holy spirit is to lead you to those
[1:32:33] great fountains of god
[1:32:36] amen what's secure brother john how do i
[1:32:39] satisfy that thirst
[1:32:41] satisfy it once
[1:32:43] you've got to get it satisfied once
[1:32:46] brother brown already told us what that
[1:32:47] was he says you've got to get the new
[1:32:49] birth
[1:32:50] the real new birth
[1:32:52] not that i agree with what's coming over
[1:32:53] the pulpit
[1:32:54] not that i like being in church
[1:32:57] but the real new birth which is the life
[1:32:58] of christ in you and you've become a new
[1:33:00] creature in him and the old one has died
[1:33:03] that's what you've got to do what you've
[1:33:04] got to get truly satisfied once
[1:33:07] and once you get that you're set for
[1:33:09] life
[1:33:10] because you'll always have something to
[1:33:11] come back to but otherwise what are we
[1:33:14] we're going to be a pilgrim and a
[1:33:15] stranger seeking for something that's
[1:33:16] going to satisfy our thirst amen
[1:33:19] what is it it's a satisfaction that
[1:33:21] doesn't require money in the bank
[1:33:23] doesn't require health in our body amen
[1:33:25] doesn't require recognition or
[1:33:27] acknowledgement from the church body
[1:33:29] but what it's a deep-seated sense of
[1:33:31] satisfaction and comfort because you
[1:33:33] know that he abides in me
[1:33:35] amen you need to have that experience
[1:33:37] and then what is it every day after that
[1:33:40] you keep seeking what a new experience
[1:33:42] with god more of him less of you more of
[1:33:44] him less of you more of him less of you
[1:33:47] and what happens is all of a sudden you
[1:33:49] start to rise to what higher heights
[1:33:52] deeper depths
[1:33:53] stable life
[1:33:56] you're not going up and down in your
[1:33:57] relationship you're getting into more
[1:33:59] and more of god while staying right in
[1:34:00] the middle
[1:34:01] satan throws something at you your
[1:34:03] health falters what do you do praise the
[1:34:05] lord ron spencer two years and two
[1:34:07] months afterwards praise the lord i'm
[1:34:09] going to preach this morning right
[1:34:11] takes your job
[1:34:12] what do you do the lord give the lord
[1:34:15] takes away blessed be the name of the
[1:34:17] lord then he gives you a great job
[1:34:19] it doesn't suddenly ramp up your
[1:34:21] experience with god why because it's
[1:34:23] always there day by day by day why he is
[1:34:25] your satisfying portion
[1:34:28] but when that thirst comes back
[1:34:30] when you are sad when you are depressed
[1:34:33] when you are angry when you are offended
[1:34:36] when you are hurt what do you do
[1:34:38] you go back now to that place that
[1:34:40] satisfied you before because you know in
[1:34:42] that place you weren't sad you weren't
[1:34:44] depressed you weren't angry you weren't
[1:34:46] offended because why that can't stand in
[1:34:48] god's presence can it
[1:34:50] brother brahms said no man staying in
[1:34:52] the presence of god can even accuse
[1:34:53] another that's how great that presence
[1:34:55] is you want to get out of your offense
[1:34:57] get in the presence of god because there
[1:34:59] he's going to focus everything on you
[1:35:00] and him and everybody else is outside
[1:35:02] why into the chamber be free holy spirit
[1:35:05] speak to me gently as i close the door
[1:35:08] it's just you and him
[1:35:10] everybody else is out
[1:35:11] when he's talking to you
[1:35:14] brown says you've got to find the person
[1:35:16] god himself
[1:35:18] which is the word and interpretation of
[1:35:20] himself today
[1:35:22] the promises that he made today how many
[1:35:25] times did he say we don't have noah's
[1:35:26] message we don't have moses message
[1:35:29] what do we have we have a message for
[1:35:30] our day and it's what as brother brother
[1:35:32] jail keeps saying it's a rapture and
[1:35:34] resurrection message this is the message
[1:35:36] of the resurrection and the rapture
[1:35:38] that's the only thing that we're here
[1:35:39] for is to get out of here we're restored
[1:35:41] back to pentecost and then we move
[1:35:43] beyond it because we're getting out of
[1:35:45] here amen this is a message that's going
[1:35:47] to take us all the way out of this world
[1:35:50] the people that he was going to have in
[1:35:51] this day the church without spot or
[1:35:53] wrinkle it doesn't mean a denomination
[1:35:55] it means the persons the individuals
[1:35:58] without spot or wrinkle there'll be two
[1:36:00] in the bed i'll take one and leave one
[1:36:02] two in the field i'll take one and leave
[1:36:04] one but when god that holy thirst to be
[1:36:06] like him and when you see that his word
[1:36:08] is in you vindicating itself that you
[1:36:10] are god's servant whatever god says you
[1:36:13] just toe right up to it then you're
[1:36:15] coming through the right process then to
[1:36:18] satisfy that's holy thirst that's in you
[1:36:21] amen i want to close with one scripture
[1:36:23] and it's a long one turn to acts chapter
[1:36:25] 4 if you would
[1:36:27] acts chapter 4.
[1:36:34] now this struck me as i was reading it
[1:36:36] because of the timing acts 4 is just a
[1:36:38] few days after the holy ghost fell on
[1:36:39] pentecost so keep that in mind as we're
[1:36:41] reading this
[1:36:43] so it's a wonderful event
[1:36:46] acts 4 says this verse 6 and anna's the
[1:36:48] high priest and caiaphas and john and
[1:36:50] alexander and as many as were of the
[1:36:52] kindred of the high priest were gathered
[1:36:53] together at jerusalem and when they had
[1:36:55] set them in the midst they asked by what
[1:36:57] power or by what name have you done this
[1:36:59] so peter and john have been brought into
[1:37:01] the midst of these these priests and
[1:37:03] after they healed the lame man at the
[1:37:04] gate beautiful remember now they're
[1:37:06] brought before them to answer for it
[1:37:09] then peter filled with the holy ghost
[1:37:11] he's filled with the holy ghost okay he
[1:37:13] got filled on the day of pentecost he's
[1:37:15] still filled with the holy ghost
[1:37:17] said unto them ye rulers are the people
[1:37:19] and elders of israel
[1:37:21] if we this day be examined of the good
[1:37:23] deed done to the impotent man by what
[1:37:25] means he is made whole be it known unto
[1:37:28] you all and to all the people of israel
[1:37:30] that by the name of jesus christ of
[1:37:32] nazareth whom he crucified whom god
[1:37:34] raised from the dead even by him does
[1:37:36] this man stand here before you whole
[1:37:38] peter never said it was me
[1:37:40] they never said it was anything i did
[1:37:42] they said it was in the name of jesus
[1:37:44] christ and it's by his power that we did
[1:37:45] this
[1:37:46] drop to verse 13 says now when they saw
[1:37:49] the boldness of peter and jonah
[1:37:50] perceived that they were unlearned and
[1:37:52] ignorant men they marveled and they took
[1:37:54] knowledge of them that they had been
[1:37:56] with jesus
[1:37:58] do people know you've been with jesus
[1:38:00] and beholding the man which was healed
[1:38:02] standing with them they could say
[1:38:04] nothing against it the miracle the proof
[1:38:06] is standing in front of them that that
[1:38:07] god is in their midst and they can't say
[1:38:09] well it didn't happen because he's
[1:38:10] standing right there
[1:38:13] but when they had commanded them to go
[1:38:14] outside of the council they conferred
[1:38:16] among themselves saying what shall we do
[1:38:18] to these men for that indeed a notable
[1:38:20] miracle had been done by them is
[1:38:22] manifest to all that dwell in jerusalem
[1:38:24] we can't deny it they said listen we
[1:38:26] can't go say this didn't happen
[1:38:28] it happened
[1:38:30] what are we going to do about it guys
[1:38:32] what do people say about our lives
[1:38:35] can they look at our lives and say
[1:38:38] say what you want about them
[1:38:40] you can't say they're not a christian
[1:38:42] you can't say that they don't things do
[1:38:44] things a different way
[1:38:45] and you can't say that they're not
[1:38:46] blessed in it
[1:38:48] because they've got a peace and they've
[1:38:50] got a rest and they've got a joy when
[1:38:52] everything is locked down amen
[1:38:54] they go through covet and they're happy
[1:38:56] while the rest of us are huddled in our
[1:38:57] basements trying not to get sick
[1:39:00] what is it we talk to our neighbors and
[1:39:02] and we talk to friends and they're
[1:39:04] they're so unhappy
[1:39:07] and what do we have we have a joy in the
[1:39:08] holy ghost we have a body that we're a
[1:39:11] part of that's right
[1:39:13] and what is it we go through life
[1:39:15] and we don't worry about the things
[1:39:17] people worry
[1:39:18] because why we've got a satisfying
[1:39:20] experience that goes on whether we make
[1:39:22] it to church or not
[1:39:23] right whether we have covet 19
[1:39:25] restrictions or not
[1:39:27] it's frustrating but what god is always
[1:39:29] with us
[1:39:30] and we've got people praying for us and
[1:39:31] we've got people holding us up and we've
[1:39:32] got people that love us and we've got
[1:39:34] people that are connected to us no
[1:39:35] matter what what is it it's the life of
[1:39:37] christ that's spread throughout the body
[1:39:39] and then we've got something that people
[1:39:40] don't know about
[1:39:42] but they see it
[1:39:43] they don't know what causes it but they
[1:39:44] see it it said it but it's that it
[1:39:47] spread no further among the people let
[1:39:48] us straightly threaten them that they
[1:39:51] speak henceforth to no man in this name
[1:39:54] and they called them and commanded them
[1:39:55] not to speak at all nor teach in the
[1:39:57] name of jesus now that's completely
[1:39:59] against their commission isn't it
[1:40:02] so now we've got a now we've got a line
[1:40:03] draw on the sand the priests are saying
[1:40:05] you can't preach or teach
[1:40:07] and jesus said go ye into all the world
[1:40:09] and preach and teach
[1:40:11] what are they going to do
[1:40:13] and peter and john answered and said
[1:40:14] unto them whether it be right in the
[1:40:15] sight of god to hearken unto you more
[1:40:17] than god judge ye
[1:40:20] for we cannot but speak the things which
[1:40:22] we have seen and heard
[1:40:23] let me take this back to our lives
[1:40:26] david
[1:40:27] would what remember and meditate on the
[1:40:29] things that he had seen and heard he
[1:40:32] went back to experience
[1:40:34] you know what our testimony ought to be
[1:40:37] things we've seen and heard
[1:40:39] if we're going to go to people if we're
[1:40:40] going to be a witness if we're going to
[1:40:41] be something talk about what god's doing
[1:40:43] in us
[1:40:44] talk about what god's doing in our local
[1:40:46] body perhaps but if you don't have
[1:40:48] something to share with people then
[1:40:49] there's a problem there because it means
[1:40:51] you don't have anything you've seen and
[1:40:52] heard to share
[1:40:53] right you need to have something in your
[1:40:55] life that you can bring to somebody else
[1:40:56] to let them know this is what you get if
[1:40:58] you come to do what i do if you come to
[1:41:00] the god i serve this is what you get but
[1:41:02] if everything is pointing to somebody
[1:41:04] else then we've got a problem don't we
[1:41:07] he says but we cannot but speak the
[1:41:08] things which we have seen and heard so
[1:41:10] when they have further threatened them
[1:41:13] not a fun day for peter and john
[1:41:16] they let them go finding nothing how
[1:41:17] they might punish them because of the
[1:41:19] people for all men glorified god for
[1:41:21] that which was done hallelujah
[1:41:24] the miracles
[1:41:25] was what kept them from being
[1:41:27] made any harm being done to them right
[1:41:30] for the man was above 40 years old on
[1:41:32] whom this miracle of healing was shown
[1:41:33] he'd been crippled a long time this
[1:41:36] wasn't some quack you know we've been
[1:41:37] faking it for a while just to make him
[1:41:39] look good this was a man that had been
[1:41:40] crippled a long time
[1:41:42] and being let go they went to their own
[1:41:44] company and reported all that the chief
[1:41:46] priests and elders had said to them they
[1:41:48] went back to the to the church group and
[1:41:50] they said here's what we've been told
[1:41:52] they've said you're not allowed to
[1:41:53] preach and teach in the name of jesus
[1:41:55] and we've been told to preach in the
[1:41:56] name of jesus what are we going to do
[1:41:58] now i want you to remember this is just
[1:42:00] days after pentecost this is days after
[1:42:02] the original indwelling of the holy
[1:42:04] spirit they've been endued with power
[1:42:05] from on high they have signs and wonders
[1:42:07] following they've got boldness they've
[1:42:09] got strength they've got everything they
[1:42:11] need to take the gospel into the world
[1:42:13] they got it right there on the day of
[1:42:14] pentecost this is just mere days
[1:42:16] afterwards
[1:42:17] they're expressing the very nature and
[1:42:19] power of christ
[1:42:21] right this is god in flesh walking the
[1:42:22] earth all over again and then they come
[1:42:24] in and they have a meeting with the with
[1:42:26] the church body
[1:42:27] it says and when they heard that they
[1:42:28] lifted up their voice to god with one
[1:42:30] accord and said lord thou art god which
[1:42:33] has made heaven and earth and the sea
[1:42:35] and all that in them is
[1:42:37] who by the mouth of thy servant david
[1:42:38] has said why did the heathen rage and
[1:42:40] the people imagine vain things the kings
[1:42:43] of the earth stood up and the rulers
[1:42:44] were gathered together against the lord
[1:42:46] and against his christ
[1:42:47] for of a truth against thy holy child
[1:42:49] jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod
[1:42:52] and pontius pilate with the gentiles
[1:42:54] gentiles and the people of israel were
[1:42:56] gathered together for to do whatsoever
[1:42:58] thy hand and thou thy counsel determined
[1:43:00] before to be done i love how peter says
[1:43:03] everything that's happened was because
[1:43:04] you ordained it that way
[1:43:06] what's he saying so whatever is
[1:43:08] happening now is
[1:43:10] ordained
[1:43:12] it's tough
[1:43:13] we could lose our lives we could be
[1:43:14] thrown in jail he says it's for it was
[1:43:16] for ordained for you it's for ordained
[1:43:18] for us
[1:43:19] and now lord behold their threatenings
[1:43:22] and grant unto thy servants with that
[1:43:24] with all boldness they may speak thy
[1:43:26] word
[1:43:28] by stretching forth thy hand to heal and
[1:43:30] that signs and wonders may be done by
[1:43:33] the name of thy holy child jesus
[1:43:36] what is it
[1:43:37] they're facing a situation there's an
[1:43:39] incoming storm
[1:43:41] and they say
[1:43:43] we need more
[1:43:44] he's had great boldness they've had
[1:43:46] great signs and wonders but they said
[1:43:48] this is about to get real
[1:43:50] this is about to get tough we're going
[1:43:52] to be going against what they've told us
[1:43:53] to do and we know there are going to be
[1:43:55] repercussions if we fulfill the
[1:43:57] commission
[1:43:58] right so he says what
[1:44:00] we need more
[1:44:02] they've just gotten the holy ghost a
[1:44:04] couple days earlier and yet they're
[1:44:05] thirsting for more there's a need in
[1:44:07] their life and so they're coming to god
[1:44:09] and they're saying you've told us to do
[1:44:10] it
[1:44:11] now do it
[1:44:14] amen
[1:44:17] what is it
[1:44:18] they're going back to the well that
[1:44:20] satisfied them the first time aren't
[1:44:21] they
[1:44:22] they're going back to the great source
[1:44:25] amend the satisfying portion they didn't
[1:44:26] have a strategy session they didn't sit
[1:44:28] down and hold a church vote on what we
[1:44:30] should do
[1:44:31] you know should we just go out as a mass
[1:44:32] crowd and we'll put people peter in the
[1:44:34] middle and he'll preach from there and
[1:44:36] we'll just surround with people so that
[1:44:37] they can't get to him easily and he can
[1:44:39] slip away if they try and grab them
[1:44:40] maybe we can hire some mercenaries to
[1:44:42] protect us no they didn't do anything
[1:44:44] they went back to the great source of
[1:44:45] life the great source of satisfaction
[1:44:47] the fountain of everything that they had
[1:44:49] need of and they said lord we're coming
[1:44:51] to you because we're trying to do your
[1:44:52] work
[1:44:53] amen
[1:44:55] they just had a prayer meeting
[1:44:57] that's what they did they had a prayer
[1:44:58] meeting
[1:45:01] what they say god we're coming back to
[1:45:02] you
[1:45:04] we're doing what you needed us to do
[1:45:06] but we need more to get it done
[1:45:09] it's our joshua moment isn't it
[1:45:11] god we need more than what you've given
[1:45:13] us
[1:45:14] what you've given us feels insufficient
[1:45:16] lord so we're coming for more from you
[1:45:18] now listen to this
[1:45:20] and when they had prayed the place was
[1:45:23] shaken where they were assembled
[1:45:24] together and they were all filled with
[1:45:26] the holy ghost and they spake the word
[1:45:29] of god with boldness amen what do you
[1:45:31] mean they were filled with the holy
[1:45:32] ghost i thought they were already filled
[1:45:33] with the holy ghost they were filled
[1:45:35] with the holy ghost again and more
[1:45:38] amen what brother branham said one new
[1:45:41] birth many fillings
[1:45:43] one in filling many refillings right
[1:45:46] you don't have to say i got the holy
[1:45:48] ghost when i got saved i'm done
[1:45:50] we see here what three four days maybe
[1:45:53] after they got the holy ghost they went
[1:45:54] back and they were asking god we need
[1:45:56] more from you
[1:45:58] we need more from the fountain of life
[1:46:00] we need more from your kingdom we need
[1:46:02] to be what and do with more power to
[1:46:05] push through on this and what did it do
[1:46:07] and immediately it says and they spoke
[1:46:08] the word of god with boldness he gave
[1:46:10] them exactly what they were thirsting
[1:46:12] for
[1:46:13] what to do his business not theirs
[1:46:15] and the multitude of them that believed
[1:46:17] were of one heart and one soul remember
[1:46:19] they were in one accord on the day of
[1:46:20] pentecost weren't they
[1:46:22] and what did it do it says they're in
[1:46:23] the same one accord again
[1:46:25] neither said any of them any that
[1:46:27] of them that ought of the things that he
[1:46:29] possessed was his own but they had all
[1:46:31] things common and with great power gave
[1:46:33] the apostles witness of the resurrection
[1:46:35] of the lord jesus and great grace was
[1:46:38] upon them listen when you're satisfied
[1:46:41] grace follows doesn't it
[1:46:43] because when you're satisfied nothing
[1:46:45] can knock you out
[1:46:46] if i'm satisfied seeing what my brother
[1:46:48] has that i don't have seen what my
[1:46:50] sister has that i don't have that
[1:46:52] doesn't bother me because why i'm
[1:46:54] satisfied it is grace in my life and it
[1:46:56] gives grace to others as well when i'm
[1:46:58] walking through this world amen can you
[1:47:00] imagine if they tried to take this on
[1:47:02] their own shoulders
[1:47:04] what would have happened they'd have
[1:47:05] made a mess of it and we always make a
[1:47:07] mess of it when we try and take it on
[1:47:09] our own shoulders but all they did is
[1:47:10] they went back and said god you
[1:47:11] commissioned us that means you've got
[1:47:13] the remedy for our need right here
[1:47:15] there's a place that i can go to quench
[1:47:18] the thirst that's in my soul
[1:47:20] amen
[1:47:21] what is it we try other things because
[1:47:23] we've forgotten what worked or else it's
[1:47:25] never worked in our life and so we keep
[1:47:27] looking
[1:47:28] amen
[1:47:29] like i said once you meet that
[1:47:30] satisfying portion you're never going to
[1:47:32] thirst again
[1:47:34] lebron said this and we're closing he
[1:47:35] says let me tell you friend i don't care
[1:47:37] how many churches you join
[1:47:39] how many names you put on which way you
[1:47:41] go whether you're sprinkled baptized or
[1:47:43] whatever you are until you meet that
[1:47:45] person jesus christ that that's the only
[1:47:48] thing that will really satisfy emotion
[1:47:50] won't do it
[1:47:51] you might jump up and down and shout as
[1:47:53] long as you want to you might run up and
[1:47:55] down the floor you might speak in
[1:47:56] tongues as much as you want to and then
[1:47:58] things are holy and good i don't see
[1:48:00] nothing against that but until you meet
[1:48:02] that person that satisfying portion that
[1:48:05] something that takes every fiber in your
[1:48:07] body not by emotion but by a
[1:48:10] satisfaction
[1:48:12] god gave man that thirst to worship him
[1:48:15] to love to seek after him but man
[1:48:17] perverted it by the call of the devil
[1:48:19] and he goes and lusts after women and
[1:48:21] pleasures and things of the world trying
[1:48:22] to satisfy that holy creation that god
[1:48:24] has put in to love him he places it upon
[1:48:27] the things of the world but brother when
[1:48:30] once he's when he's once changed that's
[1:48:33] why i said you only have to change once
[1:48:35] you only have to what recognize this
[1:48:37] once you only have to experience it once
[1:48:39] and that fountain with wiggle tails in
[1:48:41] it all kinds of disorders of the cistern
[1:48:43] has been cleansed out and sterilized and
[1:48:45] the pure water of god is put in there
[1:48:47] sin can never touch it amen
[1:48:50] amen stand together if we would and the
[1:48:52] musicians can come
[1:48:58] i'm going to read one more quote it's
[1:49:00] not in the slides i
[1:49:01] had it on my phone
[1:49:04] he says let me say this tonight
[1:49:06] in the name of the lord jesus this is
[1:49:08] thus saith the lord
[1:49:11] there's nothing will satisfy like the
[1:49:13] coming of the power of the holy ghost
[1:49:15] that will change your life
[1:49:17] and your attitudes and give you comfort
[1:49:20] and eternal life
[1:49:22] i'm going to read it again let me say
[1:49:24] this tonight in the name of the lord
[1:49:26] jesus there's nothing will satisfy like
[1:49:29] the coming of the power of the holy
[1:49:31] ghost that will change your life and
[1:49:33] your attitudes and give you comfort and
[1:49:36] eternal life that's he cares for you in
[1:49:37] 1960 amen i want to ask you this morning
[1:49:41] do you feel like something's missing
[1:49:44] do you feel like you're hungry
[1:49:47] do you feel unsatisfied
[1:49:50] amen is there a thirst unquenched
[1:49:53] is there something that's drawing you
[1:49:54] and yet you know it's not god
[1:49:57] you know what that means
[1:49:58] it means that there's a thirst somewhere
[1:50:00] that needs to be satisfied
[1:50:02] and it's not going to be with what
[1:50:03] you're looking at it's got to be through
[1:50:05] the way that god has called it to be
[1:50:06] amen needing something isn't wrong we're
[1:50:09] all needy this morning
[1:50:10] amen when a preacher says if you have a
[1:50:12] knee this morning raise your hands we
[1:50:13] ought to do it every time because we
[1:50:14] always have needs being needs is not
[1:50:16] what makes us bad doesn't makes us
[1:50:18] backslidden it's what we do when the
[1:50:21] need is recognized that determines who
[1:50:22] and what we are amen because what a
[1:50:24] christian will always go towards christ
[1:50:26] he'll always go towards word he'll
[1:50:27] always go towards the what the moving of
[1:50:30] the holy spirit in his life rather than
[1:50:31] the things of this world amen
[1:50:33] what is it trying to satisfy what the
[1:50:35] wrong thing is what really does us in
[1:50:38] when you need water and you drink pepsi
[1:50:39] doesn't do you any good
[1:50:41] that's what does us in is when we try
[1:50:42] and satisfy it with something else amen
[1:50:44] but can you recognize that you're
[1:50:46] thirsty
[1:50:47] can you look at your life can you look
[1:50:48] at where you are can you look at where
[1:50:50] you are in your job and your families
[1:50:51] and your marriages maybe in your church
[1:50:53] situation
[1:50:54] maybe in the ministry that you have
[1:50:56] whatever it might be can you look there
[1:50:57] and say there's a dissatisfaction
[1:51:00] and what's causing that dissatisfaction
[1:51:02] and what am i doing to satisfy the
[1:51:04] thirst that's there because any
[1:51:05] dissatisfaction any fear any pain any
[1:51:08] suffering what is it it's pointing to
[1:51:10] something that's deeper than what you
[1:51:11] think and you've got to get there and
[1:51:12] say lord satisfy that thirst
[1:51:15] so that i'll follow you in the right way
[1:51:16] instead of trying to satisfy with
[1:51:18] something else amen
[1:51:20] amen let's bow our heads if we would i
[1:51:23] want you to think on your lives now
[1:51:25] i want you to think and say lord
[1:51:27] there are thirsts there
[1:51:30] and as the word was coming this morning
[1:51:32] i realized there's a thirst i'm trying
[1:51:34] to satisfy
[1:51:36] there's something going on and lord it's
[1:51:37] not satisfied
[1:51:39] and i want you to satisfy it this
[1:51:40] morning
[1:51:42] amen
[1:51:43] let's bow heavenly father
[1:51:46] lord we're coming to you this morning

[1:51:50] lord of every blessing
[1:51:52] of every need
[1:51:54] supplied heavenly father
[1:51:56] lord and we're bowing our heads in
[1:51:57] humility

[1:52:01] wrong things
[1:52:02] lord we pick the easy things we pick the
[1:52:04] quick things
[1:52:05] but lord your word doesn't work that way
[1:52:08] but lord if we'll come to it and we'll
[1:52:09] stay to it lord that there's a great
[1:52:10] satisfaction that comes into our lives

[1:52:15] saying lord would you be our satisfying
[1:52:18] portion
[1:52:19] nor will you highlight those thirsts in
[1:52:21] our life
[1:52:22] where we just thought it was something
[1:52:24] but now we realize there's a thirst
[1:52:26] there that needs to be satisfied and
[1:52:27] that's why we're doing these things lord
[1:52:29] god would you grant us grace this
[1:52:31] morning lord my hand is up

[1:52:44] accessible things lord but may i go to
[1:52:46] your word may i go to your presence
[1:52:48] heavenly father lord that it would draw
[1:52:50] me ever closer to you and ever further
[1:52:52] away from those things that so easily
[1:52:54] beset us

[1:55:40] lord hear my prayer
[1:55:43] for
[1:55:44] more you
[1:55:50] you know when somebody
[1:55:51] has an addiction
[1:55:53] what's an addiction
[1:55:55] it's a thirst that's dominated a person
[1:55:57] it's all it is
[1:55:59] right
[1:56:00] they say the first step
[1:56:02] is admitting you've got it
[1:56:05] we're going to sing
[1:56:07] fill my cup lord
[1:56:09] but this morning you don't have to i'm
[1:56:11] not inviting anyone to come up for
[1:56:12] prayer if you want to you're always
[1:56:13] welcome to do it
[1:56:15] but the first step is always saying
[1:56:18] i've got a thirst that i'm quenching
[1:56:19] another way
[1:56:20] you've got to be humble before god
[1:56:22] you've got to repent before god and say
[1:56:23] god i'm doing something i ought not to
[1:56:26] and there's a way to get around it but
[1:56:27] i've got to admit it's a problem in the
[1:56:29] first place amen it's the hardest thing
[1:56:31] for us sometimes especially as mature
[1:56:33] believers is we've got to say i've been
[1:56:35] trapped i've been fooled i've been
[1:56:38] sucking on a straw that went into
[1:56:39] something other than pure water amen but
[1:56:41] if we'll repent if we'll go to him and
[1:56:43] say lord there's a thirst there and i
[1:56:45] want to satisfy it the right way that's
[1:56:47] when we can get the victory but as long
[1:56:49] as we keep patting it
[1:56:50] right soothing our demon nothing's going
[1:56:53] to happen but if we can say lord there's
[1:56:55] a problem and i want you to resolve it
[1:56:57] this morning and i want you to satisfy
[1:56:59] my thirst with something else then he's
[1:57:01] got something to work with amen i want
[1:57:03] us to just sing this this morning for a
[1:57:05] little bit we'll let brother bob come up
[1:57:07] fill my cup lord
[1:57:09] if you got it full there's nothing to
[1:57:10] fill
[1:57:11] and then if you've got no needs there's
[1:57:12] nothing to fill
[1:57:14] but if you can say to them lord there's
[1:57:15] a need in my life there's a thirst in my
[1:57:17] life there's a feeling that i'm looking
[1:57:18] for then guess what a feeling is what
[1:57:20] you're going to get if you don't need
[1:57:21] anything you won't get anything but if
[1:57:23] you can say lord there's something that
[1:57:24] i desire in my life there's a thirst in
[1:57:26] my life you can have it this morning
[1:57:29] amen if you need the baptism of the holy
[1:57:30] spirit you can get it if you need
[1:57:32] deliverance if you need cleansing if you
[1:57:33] need joy if you need love if you need
[1:57:35] rest you need peace you need financial
[1:57:37] blessing

[2:18:39] [Music]

[2:18:54] [Music]
[2:19:04] now
[2:19:09] is
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:24] and there are streams of grace that's
[2:19:28] falling down
[2:19:31] from calvary
[2:19:35] [Music]
[2:19:39] amen amen amen praise the lord let's uh
[2:19:44] before we go let's sing
[2:19:46] i need i need you lord i need you right
[2:19:48] now it's 11 20 11 29 i think
[2:19:53] you know let's uh let's sing that and uh
[2:19:56] i'm gonna ask for david to close in
[2:19:58] prayer today and just pray one for
[2:20:00] another because
[2:20:01] more and more i see the need
[2:20:03] to pray one for another more and more
[2:20:06] uh you know
[2:20:08] i've often heard it said in prayer we
[2:20:10] see the world falling apart around us
[2:20:12] and
[2:20:13] and and it's absolutely true the world
[2:20:15] is falling apart
[2:20:17] all around us and the only thing that
[2:20:19] makes any sense is what
[2:20:22] is jesus christ it's his word and what
[2:20:24] it means to us
[2:20:26] and so i think that's that's where we
[2:20:28] had to focus and and
[2:20:30] our focus has to be
[2:20:33] to acknowledge our need of god
[2:20:36] when i was in uh
[2:20:38] we were in edmonton a couple years ago
[2:20:42] i was asked to lead the song service and
[2:20:43] i
[2:20:44] i do that when when brother jerry asked
[2:20:46] me to and
[2:20:48] um
[2:20:49] normally what what
[2:20:51] what they do in that church is they'll
[2:20:52] say is there a need to put up your hand
[2:20:54] as you're approaching the uh the opening
[2:20:57] prayer and uh so i i did that and it was
[2:21:01] probably two or three hands went up and
[2:21:03] that was it
[2:21:04] and then i said this
[2:21:06] i said
[2:21:07] if you have if you feel you have need of
[2:21:09] nothing you have need of at least one
[2:21:10] thing and i said it's more of christ
[2:21:13] and every hand just about went up
[2:21:15] because people realize that that
[2:21:17] our need is really of christ it's it's
[2:21:20] in need of more and more of him if john
[2:21:23] said it you know we're still here so we
[2:21:25] need more of him right
[2:21:27] and we won't be satisfied until we're
[2:21:29] over on the other side
[2:21:31] amen so
[2:21:32] let's pray that way
[2:21:34] god give us more and more of you
[2:21:37] more and more and more and more it's
[2:21:39] okay to be greedy on that point
[2:21:41] okay
[2:21:42] so let's be greedy let's ask god for
[2:21:45] more and more and pray
[2:21:47] and pray for each other that god gives
[2:21:48] every one of us more and more
[2:21:52] remember remember you might say well i'm
[2:21:54] weak but
[2:21:56] at the same time the devils tremble when
[2:21:58] the weakest one gets down on our knees
[2:22:00] and praise right brother brandon told us
[2:22:02] that
[2:22:03] so let's sing this
[2:22:05] and uh a few times and then brother
[2:22:07] david
[2:22:08] calls in prayer
[2:22:09] amen
[2:22:12] i need you lord
