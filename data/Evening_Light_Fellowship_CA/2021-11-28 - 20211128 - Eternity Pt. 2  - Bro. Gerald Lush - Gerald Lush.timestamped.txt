[1:04:51] of the resurrection i believe we're in
[1:04:53] the hour of the rapture lord i believe
[1:04:55] oh yeah that your judgment has come down
[1:04:58] now oh yeah and not only that we believe
[1:05:00] also lord the devil has come down with
[1:05:02] great wrath
[1:05:04] amen knowing his time is short
[1:05:07] amen now brother sister considering
[1:05:09] considering what god has done and
[1:05:11] considering what god is doing look at
[1:05:13] the faith that it has given the devil
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] faith yes satan got that faith so satan
[1:05:20] got that revelation that his time is
[1:05:22] short oh yeah he knows amen oh yeah he
[1:05:26] knows the word
[1:05:27] he knows this he knows that oh god yeah
[1:05:29] god said right from the very beginning
[1:05:32] in genesis he quoted the word
[1:05:35] huh
[1:05:36] and all the way down through satan is
[1:05:37] quoting the word
[1:05:38] and he's going to get you to head to the
[1:05:40] word or take away from the word amen
[1:05:42] because he knows it's the truth
[1:05:45] amen and that's why concerning the last
[1:05:48] days the bible says oh yeah the bible
[1:05:50] says satan knows the word and he's come
[1:05:52] down and when he sees all that's going
[1:05:54] on oh
[1:05:56] oh well oh yeah yes lord oh yeah that's
[1:06:00] this is what you said you're going to do
[1:06:01] in the end
[1:06:02] amen so he knows his time is short and
[1:06:05] he's come down with great wrath oh yeah
[1:06:07] and our childhood brother
[1:06:09] in this hour and this age we got we got
[1:06:11] more to face with the devil's deception
[1:06:13] than they did in any any other age oh
[1:06:16] yeah he just did a little here a little
[1:06:18] there a little there a little there but
[1:06:19] brother now it's getting worse and worse
[1:06:21] and worse oh yeah to finally of course
[1:06:24] in the last stage it is absolutely false
[1:06:26] religion
[1:06:27] oh yeah or he might he might have
[1:06:29] impersonated a little here a little
[1:06:31] revelation there a little revelation
[1:06:33] there amen but in this hour he's
[1:06:34] impersonating the truth the whole truth
[1:06:37] oh yeah and he's going to add to a
[1:06:39] little here and a little there to this
[1:06:41] oh yeah and there's many a so-called
[1:06:43] bride many a so-called believer that are
[1:06:45] deceived because the enemy has added to
[1:06:48] the revelation of the word
[1:06:49] amen and the devil is adding to it amen
[1:06:52] to get us oh yeah they're going back to
[1:06:54] just just theology what did he do in all
[1:06:56] the other ages they went back and made a
[1:06:58] denomination at the denomination and and
[1:07:00] it became all that god revealed became a
[1:07:03] creed oh yeah oh yeah this is what we
[1:07:05] believe this we we are this church and
[1:07:07] we are the these believers and we
[1:07:09] believe this this and this amen i trust
[1:07:12] by the grace of god that what god has
[1:07:13] done in this hour and what god has
[1:07:15] revealed in these last days is is not a
[1:07:18] creed

[1:24:30] of william branham and they said out in
[1:24:32] the world can we they said explain the
[1:24:34] ministry of william branham how can we
[1:24:37] how can we understand this they said
[1:24:39] here he was this man he said they went
[1:24:41] forth and he said his ministry was like
[1:24:43] the ministry of jesus
[1:24:45] yeah he was deserting the thoughts and
[1:24:47] intentions of the heart and he spoke the
[1:24:49] word they spoke the word and this one
[1:24:50] was healed and that was evil oh my and
[1:24:53] they said yet let's consider what he

[1:25:00] that
[1:25:01] here is this man with this ministry and
[1:25:02] there's this man with this teaching
[1:25:05] oh they they recognize the ministry oh
[1:25:07] it's reflecting jesus amen but they
[1:25:10] didn't reflect they didn't recognize the
[1:25:11] teaching
[1:25:13] oh yeah they didn't agree with his
[1:25:14] teaching
[1:25:15] amen but brothers the same thing 2000
[1:25:17] years ago

[1:25:20] jesus amen but they didn't they didn't
[1:25:23] recognize his teaching
[1:25:25] no same thing today
[1:25:27] oh this was jesus he did this deserting
[1:25:29] the thoughts engines of the heart these
[1:25:30] signs these wonders oh made amazing the
[1:25:33] miracles that were done
[1:25:35] and they recognized it now but not not
[1:25:37] his teaching
[1:25:38] yeah and that's why that that for years
[1:25:41] they wanted william branham they wanted
[1:25:43] william branham to did
[1:25:45] denominations and and and these these
[1:25:48] brothers these sisters they wanted
[1:25:49] william branham but they didn't want him
[1:25:51] to teach
[1:25:53] oh yeah do the signs and wonders but
[1:25:55] don't teach
[1:25:56] amen and it went again it was the
[1:25:59] evangelist said that most of us all knew
[1:26:01] the world knew he was a he was a world
[1:26:03] famous evangelist back then amen and he
[1:26:06] was the one that
[1:26:08] that spoke to brother branham and of
[1:26:10] course brother brown said that there's
[1:26:11] three witnesses
[1:26:13] and he said william brandon was to the
[1:26:15] bride and he said then there was a
[1:26:17] another evangelist which was oral
[1:26:19] roberts and another evangelist which is
[1:26:21] a or billy graham amen and they they
[1:26:25] were god had chosen them god had
[1:26:26] ordained them got to predestinate them
[1:26:28] to be the witness
[1:26:30] to the world
[1:26:31] yeah
[1:26:32] amen oh yeah and it was it was oral
[1:26:34] roberts that that uh approached brother
[1:26:37] branham and he said brother adam he said
[1:26:39] uh he said
[1:26:41] we we want your t we want your your your
[1:26:43] signs and your wonders and go forth and
[1:26:45] pray for the sake and do this and do
[1:26:46] this but he said brother brown you've
[1:26:48] got to stop teaching
[1:26:50] he did yes
[1:26:52] he tried to get brother around and stop
[1:26:54] teaching the word
[1:26:55] amen they wanted the signs of wonders
[1:26:58] but they didn't want the word
[1:27:00] when jesus was there they wanted the
[1:27:02] signs and wonders but they didn't want
[1:27:03] his word
[1:27:05] amen because the word was going to
[1:27:07] line them up
[1:27:09] with the will of god
[1:27:11] amen they wanted their will but not the
[1:27:13] will of god amen but i tell you this
[1:27:16] william continued with the word and
[1:27:18] that's why eventually they just they
[1:27:19] they turned against him amen they
[1:27:22] rejected him amen that after a while
[1:27:24] they wouldn't have william branham come
[1:27:26] preach for them anymore after a while
[1:27:27] they wouldn't have come william round
[1:27:29] come not even for the signs and wonders
[1:27:31] because he knew they knew he was going
[1:27:33] to preach they knew he was going to
[1:27:34] teach this and teach that and they
[1:27:36] didn't agree with it this is amazing
[1:27:38] this is amazing that god that the man
[1:27:41] would have such a ministry amen but they
[1:27:43] would they wouldn't they wouldn't accept
[1:27:45] his teaching amen but we're here because
[1:27:48] we accept his teaching
[1:27:50] we're here we're not looking for signs
[1:27:51] and wonders we believe the signs and
[1:27:53] wonders that was only pointing to the
[1:27:55] word
[1:27:56] amen brother it's not it's not pointing
[1:27:59] to signs and wonders it's pointing to
[1:28:01] the word
[1:28:02] so that we're not going to put our
[1:28:03] emphasis on the sign but we're going to
[1:28:05] put our answers on the word
[1:28:06] amen brother again it's like i said it's
[1:28:09] like oh
[1:28:10] drive driving through a certain area and
[1:28:12] you're looking for a sign how far away
[1:28:14] are we oh it says this this is oh also
[1:28:17] we'll soon be there
[1:28:18] oh yeah well i'll tell you this
[1:28:21] we were brought there
[1:28:22] by the by the messenger amen the signs
[1:28:26] are pointing to this point into this
[1:28:27] pointing to this amen the word and the
[1:28:29] bride believed the word
[1:28:31] amen but but the majority of the people
[1:28:34] out there they didn't believe the
[1:28:36] message but they believed the signs and
[1:28:37] wonders
[1:28:38] oh yeah that william branham was doing
[1:28:41] but thank god we believe the word
[1:28:43] amen because the ministry is gone and
[1:28:46] god took it off the earth why he oh yeah
[1:28:49] why because
[1:28:51] the more he would go out and do this and
[1:28:52] do that the more they were cut out with
[1:28:54] the signs and wonders not the word
[1:28:57] amen but again like jesus said to peter
[1:29:00] believeth thou this
[1:29:02] believe us now the word
[1:29:03] amen what god has said and what god is
[1:29:06] doing
[1:29:07] amen believe it's not what god requires
[1:29:10] of you
[1:29:11] and requires of me
[1:29:13] oh they couldn't take the teaching can
[1:29:15] you take the teaching of the word
[1:29:17] amen brother amen the real teaching of
[1:29:21] the word is ordained to give us the
[1:29:23] faith that we need
[1:29:25] amen oh brother and it's not just faith
[1:29:27] for the heal my body it's the faith to
[1:29:30] change my body

[1:29:34] bradham just for the healing of the body
[1:29:36] just to heal this and heal that neilson
[1:29:38] but the bride was looking for the word
[1:29:39] to give us the faith that would change
[1:29:41] our body
[1:29:42] from the inside out
[1:29:45] for the why because we knew we didn't
[1:29:47] just knew it just it wasn't just
[1:29:49] physical healing we needed here or there
[1:29:51] we needed a change
[1:29:53] we needed a rapture
[1:29:55] amen to get out of time and into
[1:29:57] eternity we need rapturing faith that's
[1:30:00] right
[1:30:01] amen and the continuation of the

[1:47:16] going back we're going back home now
[1:47:20] grace
[1:47:21] no wonder that when jesus raised the old
[1:47:23] testament saints raised with him and
[1:47:25] they went on
[1:47:26] oh yeah they they fellowship with the
[1:47:28] saints you know or the bible says the
[1:47:30] oldest message went into the city and
[1:47:32] appeared unto many
[1:47:34] oh yeah
[1:47:35] they did yeah they did
[1:47:37] but when jesus went up they went up with
[1:47:39] him
[1:47:40] amen
[1:47:41] yeah and and when they got up to a
[1:47:43] certain area there and they said open
[1:47:45] the gates

[1:47:50] jesus
[1:47:52] amen just open the gates let him in
[1:47:55] amen
[1:47:56] so

[1:47:59] went up with him and they were screaming
[1:48:00] over the gates open the gates amen
[1:48:03] hallelujah they laid down their lives
[1:48:05] believing for the mess the the
[1:48:08] the messiah

[1:48:19] going to be proud of the gentile
[1:48:21] right
[1:48:22] amen
[1:48:27] he said now he said this time he said is
[1:48:29] this little loop
[1:48:31] that loops down and jesus was from
[1:48:34] eternity to eternity but he stepped into
[1:48:36] the time space and was made flesh and he
[1:48:40] came through here in order to sanctify
[1:48:42] to put a streak of blood all across this
[1:48:45] place to redeem it and connect it back
[1:48:47] with god
[1:48:49] again for all eternity hallelujah
[1:48:53] and remember he said that's all that's
[1:48:55] all that time is
[1:48:57] he said is
[1:48:58] really is is to get us into a closer
[1:49:00] relationship with god and then of course
[1:49:02] we get over here and that's it goodbye
[1:49:05] we don't need no time
[1:49:07] god
[1:49:08] amen
[1:49:11] he said the bible said that jesus was
[1:49:13] the lamb slain before or from the
[1:49:16] beginning of the link
[1:49:18] and he said the beginning of the world
[1:49:20] he said christ was slain at the
[1:49:22] beginning
[1:49:23] now he said really
[1:49:25] was he really wasn't slain until four
[1:49:27] thousand years later but the reason he
[1:49:29] was slain then is because in the
[1:49:32] beginning was the word
[1:49:34] and the word was with god and the word
[1:49:36] was god amen
[1:49:38] see he said
[1:49:40] satan did not create this little loop
[1:49:43] this little hickey he didn't create that
[1:49:47] he said satan only can only pervert what
[1:49:50] god has created
[1:49:52] amen
[1:49:55] yeah whatever god does the devil is
[1:49:56] there to pervert it
[1:49:58] and brother even to the hour that we're
[1:50:00] living now and and the message of the
[1:50:02] hour satan is there to pervert it amen
[1:50:05] god help us to stay with the truth
[1:50:12] he said he went down into the very
[1:50:14] lowest depths of the lowest hell bearing
[1:50:16] our sins and he got to the end of the
[1:50:19] string or the end of the rope and he
[1:50:21] said there lifted it up in resurrection
[1:50:24] and connected it with the other part of
[1:50:26] eternity and made
[1:50:30] made a highway
[1:50:32] of holiness

[1:50:45] back to eternity
[1:50:48] hallelujah praise the name of the lord
[1:50:51] amen
[1:50:53] and he said to the fountain filled with
[1:50:55] blood he said drawn from emmanuel's
[1:50:57] veins he said where sinners plunged
[1:50:59] beneath that flood
[1:51:01] lose all their guilty state thank god
[1:51:04] brother
[1:51:05] it is grace
[1:51:06] certainly not your works
[1:51:08] it's your faith
[1:51:10] in the finished work of calvary it's
[1:51:12] your faith in what jesus did
[1:51:15] lord not me is you
[1:51:17] thank you jesus for what you did
[1:51:20] amen
[1:51:22] he said come on to the highway and
[1:51:24] someday he was at the beginning of time
[1:51:28] shall stand as the ancient of time
[1:51:30] and will pull the great gospel cord amen
[1:51:34] and all that's on that highway from the
[1:51:37] beginning of time to the ancient time he
[1:51:39] said the end of time
[1:51:41] he said all shall be lifted up
[1:51:44] as he draws time out of existence and
[1:51:46] into an eternity
[1:51:48] amen he said we are now in eternity
[1:51:53] and he said eternity just dropped down
[1:51:56] into a time limit but it moves on
[1:52:00] by grace
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:08] how valuable he said is your soul
[1:52:12] amen nothing is like being saved but he
[1:52:16] says you don't realize it friends i'm
[1:52:18] sure that the devil keeps that away from
[1:52:20] you as much as he can
[1:52:23] he said to realize what the value of a
[1:52:25] soul is
[1:52:27] he said did you ever just imagine what
[1:52:29] it is and what eternity means and how
[1:52:32] long he said you're going to be that way
[1:52:34] he said do you realize this is the time
[1:52:36] when you make your decision for eternity
[1:52:41] grace please
[1:52:45] the the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:48] put you in contact with eternity

[1:52:54] anointing and baptise the holy ghost to

[1:53:02] a beginning has an end and it is things
[1:53:05] that had no beginning have no end
[1:53:08] and there's only one eternal life that's
[1:53:10] in god
[1:53:12] all of their life has an end but god has
[1:53:15] no end
[1:53:17] because he had no beginning and we being
[1:53:20] parts of god have eternal life with god

[1:53:26] and he said we being partial of god have
[1:53:28] eternal life with god but everything

[1:53:32] beginning
[1:53:33] amen

[1:57:29] your dead works of sin
[1:57:31] and i said enter into god's sabbath

[1:59:16] this world
[1:59:18] i said but they're very conscious of the
[1:59:20] world they've gone into
[1:59:22] i said where did they where did the the
[1:59:24] moses and elijah come from i said when
[1:59:26] jesus went up on the mountain and
[1:59:28] and there was moses and elijah
[1:59:30] came came and talked to him
[1:59:33] i said
[1:59:34] you said they were dead
[1:59:36] they didn't seem to be very dead there
[1:59:40] i said they were talking to jesus
[1:59:41] jesus was talking to them knowing that
[1:59:43] they're looking down at jerusalem and
[1:59:45] concerning all that was going to go on
[1:59:47] in jerusalem
[1:59:48] so i said brother
[1:59:51] i said you need to get an experience
[1:59:52] like they did
[1:59:54] you need to get a relationship with god
[1:59:55] that they had
[1:59:57] amen because i said when it comes to the
[1:59:59] dead i said yes your physical body goes
[2:00:01] down when you go into a theophany body
[2:00:04] amen there's another body hallelujah
[2:00:08] hallelujah praise the lord amen so
[2:00:11] brother the moses elijah they their
[2:00:13] physical body went down and died and
[2:00:15] they'd gone back to ashes amen but i
[2:00:18] said god said ashes to ashes you can't
[2:00:21] you came from asia you're going to go
[2:00:22] back to ashes when it comes to the
[2:00:24] physical body but you go out of it out
[2:00:26] of that into a theophany body
[2:00:28] amen a glorified body
[2:00:31] amen
[2:00:32] you're not going to get you don't want
[2:00:33] that one no more
[2:00:35] if we get out of this one we don't want
[2:00:37] this one no more
[2:00:38] no we want to get out of this one and do
[2:00:41] that glorified body
[2:00:42] praise the lord hallelujah
[2:00:44] so he said we were made in the image of
[2:00:46] god before the world ever made and when
[2:00:49] that theophany has been made flesh and
[2:00:50] dwelt among us then through his death we
[2:00:53] ourselves receive is spirit and we have
[2:00:56] no end we have eternal life
[2:00:59] he said not angels but men and women
[2:01:02] oh he said if i could only get it in a
[2:01:05] way that my audience would catch it amen
[2:01:09] he says you will never be an angel
[2:01:11] god made angels but god made man
[2:01:16] and what god does is off
[2:01:19] of god
[2:01:20] which is as eternal as god is and then
[2:01:22] and a man is just as eternal as his
[2:01:25] creator because he was made from
[2:01:27] eternity
[2:01:29] amen amen amen
[2:01:32] oh god help us to believe
[2:01:34] praise the name of the lord
[2:01:38] again
[2:01:41] this was the message he preached in 1961
[2:01:44] he must be born again
[2:01:47] he said if you were born again you are
[2:01:49] alive with christ
[2:01:51] and your affections are on things above
[2:01:53] and not on things of the world
[2:01:56] if you're born again
[2:01:58] of the spirit of god you become part of
[2:02:01] god and are eternal with god
[2:02:04] then death cannot touch you when you're
[2:02:07] born again
[2:02:09] you are eternal
[2:02:11] you have changed from a creature of time
[2:02:13] to a creature of eternity
[2:02:16] hallelujah
[2:02:18] and he said you have changed from death
[2:02:20] onto life i am talking about eternal
[2:02:24] he said from eternal death to eternal
[2:02:26] life if you're of the world you die with
[2:02:28] it
[2:02:29] but if not you live
[2:02:33] hallelujah
[2:02:35] he said good morning friends
[2:02:37] he said i can't tell what time it is but
[2:02:39] besides he said we are living in
[2:02:42] eternity
[2:02:43] we have no time
[2:02:45] he's a time limit stop when jesus gave
[2:02:47] me his life inside of me
[2:02:50] to live by his life
[2:02:52] amen
[2:02:53] so we are eternal creatures right now
[2:02:55] and he said we are sitting together in
[2:02:57] heavenly places in christ jesus what a
[2:02:59] time
[2:03:00] and he said we see this age that we are
[2:03:02] living in and it's one of the grandest
[2:03:05] ages of all ages this the loudest in
[2:03:09] church age is the grandest of the church
[2:03:11] ages because it's the ending of time
[2:03:14] and the blending of eternity
[2:03:17] amen
[2:03:18] so by the grace of god we're going from
[2:03:20] time to eternity
[2:03:24] hallelujah and god by the revealed word
[2:03:26] is giving us that faith
[2:03:29] oh yeah they gave them that faith down
[2:03:30] through the ages
[2:03:34] but they they laid down their physical
[2:03:36] bodies and went on into the glory into
[2:03:38] it into a theophany body the scriptures
[2:03:40] referred to as theophany
[2:03:42] a spirit body amen
[2:03:44] and oh yeah because like when the
[2:03:46] prophet of god was caught beyond the
[2:03:47] curtain of time
[2:03:49] oh yeah and he was he was he met those
[2:03:53] from this age and they were they were
[2:03:55] all fellowshipping with one another then
[2:03:57] then he saw the others from other ages
[2:04:00] and they were fellowshipping one another
[2:04:02] and on down on down on down and so on by
[2:04:05] the grace of god yeah
[2:04:08] so but waiting for the waiting for the
[2:04:11] coming of the lord and the fullness of
[2:04:13] the coming of the lord we will bring us
[2:04:15] all together by the grace of god amen
[2:04:19] so to god be the glory brother
[2:04:24] the saints of all ages
[2:04:26] they're not dead
[2:04:27] physically their physical bodies are
[2:04:29] gone but they have a glorified they have
[2:04:32] a body that they've gone into the bible
[2:04:34] refers to it's theophany body
[2:04:36] amen and and it's right here
[2:04:40] your theophany as the prophet says not
[2:04:42] 12 feet from you at any given time
[2:04:46] no
[2:04:47] and when when you die and if life goes
[2:04:48] out of this body you go into that
[2:04:50] theophany body amen
[2:04:53] praise the lord that's where moses and
[2:04:55] elijah went
[2:04:57] and that's why they could come back and
[2:04:58] appear to jesus
[2:05:00] by the grace of god amen but i believe
[2:05:04] that when jesus laid down his life
[2:05:06] picked it up again i believe moses and
[2:05:07] elijah went with him and ascended in the
[2:05:10] resurrection in in in their real bodies
[2:05:13] by the grace of god to god be the glory
[2:05:17] brother
[2:05:19] god help us
[2:05:21] to believe
[2:05:22] god's real
[2:05:24] god is real
[2:05:26] in the beginning was the word
[2:05:28] the word with god the word was god and
[2:05:30] the word was made flesh
[2:05:32] and dull among us and the word is made
[2:05:35] flesh
[2:05:36] in you and in me
[2:05:38] see
[2:05:39] to to too many people god is just
[2:05:42] everything is spiritual spiritual
[2:05:43] spiritual no no
[2:05:47] brother the spirit is made flesh
[2:05:50] in us
[2:05:51] grace
[2:05:54] he that hath an ear let him hear with
[2:05:55] the spirit sayeth to the churches
[2:05:59] the spirit as spoken
[2:06:01] the setting sun is about to fade into
[2:06:04] eternity
[2:06:05] for the church ages
[2:06:07] and then it will be all over
[2:06:10] then it will be too late to come but if
[2:06:12] somewhere in this series god has dealt
[2:06:15] with you by his spirit may you even now
[2:06:18] turn to him in repentance and give your
[2:06:20] life to him
[2:06:22] that by the holy spirit he may give you
[2:06:25] eternal life
[2:06:27] amen praise the lord
[2:06:31] just a couple of quotes here
[2:06:39] praise the lord
[2:06:41] i owe my oh my
[2:06:43] brother sister how many ammonias really
[2:06:46] believe in eternity
[2:06:50] we're living in a world that's more and
[2:06:52] more conscious of time
[2:06:54] they're more and more conscious of
[2:06:56] of what's going on in the world and and
[2:06:58] and more and more conscious of what
[2:06:59] what's going to affect them in this
[2:07:01] world or we want to do this we want to
[2:07:02] do that uh i think we need i would like
[2:07:05] to have this and i'd like to have that
[2:07:06] now
[2:07:07] i'll tell you it's getting to the place
[2:07:09] now where the elect of god the bride of
[2:07:11] christ if there's anything she like
[2:07:13] knows it's eternity
[2:07:15] why because she's so fed up with what's
[2:07:17] going on in this whole world enough lord
[2:07:20] let's go home
[2:07:22] let's go home lord
[2:07:23] oh yeah
[2:07:24] i tell you if uh the generations that
[2:07:26] are gone on
[2:07:28] if they came back
[2:07:31] they wouldn't want to stay
[2:07:34] if my grandfather grandmother came back

[2:07:37] back and in this world all that's going
[2:07:39] on oh no let me go back i'm going i'm
[2:07:42] going going back with the lord oh yeah
[2:07:44] they wouldn't want to stay

[2:14:48] he said coming to this one little
[2:14:50] tabernacle 1500 miles square from the
[2:14:52] same dimension yeah so the bible speaks
[2:14:55] of 1500 miles
[2:14:58] but right in there is where the temple
[2:15:00] is set
[2:15:01] and that's where the new jerusalem will
[2:15:03] break up

[2:15:22] of all things

[2:15:30] couple of quotes

[2:16:15] we're going into eternity we are fading
[2:16:18] into eternity
[2:16:20] by the grace of god
[2:16:22] oh my lord help us
[2:16:24] to believe
[2:16:32] he said god made the world in six
[2:16:34] thousand years
[2:16:36] and the seven thousand he rested
[2:16:40] and he said a man will live never live
[2:16:42] that time out
[2:16:47] and he spoke of the days of adam
[2:16:49] methuselah was the oldest man that ever
[2:16:52] lived in the bible and he was
[2:16:54] 969 years old he never lived that
[2:16:57] thousand years but the man that's going
[2:16:59] to live through the millennium
[2:17:01] 1 000 years to show that the penalty has
[2:17:05] been paid
[2:17:06] man lives forever the day is finished
[2:17:09] the time is finished
[2:17:11] they are in eternity
[2:17:13] yeah the millennial reign
[2:17:15] of a thousand years
[2:17:17] yeah

[2:18:19] that god is starting to move back to
[2:18:21] israel
[2:18:22] away from the gentile world to the
[2:18:24] jewish world
[2:18:26] amen because the gentile world is
[2:18:27] finished
[2:18:28] amen and we we have seen the last thing
[2:18:31] that god promised to the gentiles
[2:18:35] before the rapture
[2:18:37] he said i believe he said the rain is
[2:18:39] over

[2:19:00] that's when moses and elijah there's
[2:19:02] where the miracles take place the things
[2:19:04] that the people's been looking for

[2:19:26] waiting on the coming of the lord he
[2:19:28] said keep your lamps trimmed

[2:19:43] amen bear with me again
[2:19:50] he said i believe brother and sister
[2:19:53] the revival is over
[2:19:56] amen i believe that's why you can't pray
[2:19:59] and feel in the spirit like you used to
[2:20:01] it's because the revival fires have gone
[2:20:04] out
[2:20:05] and i've been dealing with that with the
[2:20:07] lord last few days again
[2:20:09] trying you know in it trying to pray
[2:20:11] whereas one time the atmosphere oh my
[2:20:14] praise the lord you when you rose in the
[2:20:16] morning you could sense that atmosphere
[2:20:18] was different
[2:20:19] spiritually it was different oh praise
[2:20:21] the lord hallelujah thank you jesus but
[2:20:23] now
[2:20:24] the atmosphere is different
[2:20:27] it's dead
[2:20:29] it's totally dead
[2:20:31] that you don't feel that spirit there
[2:20:33] that anointing is not there why it's
[2:20:34] just gathering into the little bride to
[2:20:36] rapture
[2:20:38] and there's not going to be very many go
[2:20:39] into rapture
[2:20:42] most of our gone on according to the
[2:20:44] scripture
[2:20:46] most are gone on and there's gonna be
[2:20:48] very very few living saints raptured
[2:20:59] he said the bride when she's taken from
[2:21:01] the church
[2:21:02] then the church age will cease
[2:21:05] laodicea goes into the chaos the bride
[2:21:08] goes to glory the tribulation period
[2:21:10] sits it upon the sleeping virgin for
[2:21:13] three and a half years while israel is
[2:21:15] getting to its getting its prophecy
[2:21:18] then the tribulation sets in upon israel
[2:21:21] and then comes the battle of armageddon
[2:21:24] which destroys all things and then the
[2:21:26] bride returns back with the groom for a
[2:21:28] thousand years
[2:21:29] the millennial reign and after that
[2:21:32] comes to white throne judgment after
[2:21:34] that comes the new heavens and new earth
[2:21:36] and the new city coming down from god
[2:21:39] out of heaven
