what it is and that we are yes we got the living water of the word praise the name of the lord oh oh thank god for revelation thank god for understanding it and there's anything that gives us understanding it's revelation amen amen by the holy ghost the spirit is there to give us understanding amen but no wonder you'll say well believe us all this if you're going to believe it to a certain extent you're going to understand it i believe it amen i believe that well if there's anything we got to believe it's god it is the word of god amen it is thus saith the lord it is written praise the name of the lord brothers through the scriptures god has been encouraging us giving us this faith amen to believe what to believe it is written to believe thus saith the lord amen not to don't add to it don't take from it amen see that's what the devil did in the beginning yea as god said you know he didn't deny the word oh no he just wanted to add to it or he wanted to take from it oh yeah but i say i just forget the butts as i think our brother oh vulture years ago brought it out he said oh he said butts he said that's just goats amen goat's butt he said but we're not goats he said we're sheep amen and and we're lambs the lamb of god amen so the the devil is there with with the goat nature oh yeah yeah god said but yeah as god said but don't know god didn't say that god said thus saith the lord it is written amen leave it don't add to it don't take from it but oh my i pray grace to us brother sister that we believe the word i pray grace amen that we're not adding to it in our own thoughts in our own failings no would you live with god move on amen and believe it lord i believe the word oh brother sister god give us the faith even that abel had right from the beginning amen yay as god said amen praise the name of the lord o brother sister i pray grace that we have that faith amen that right from the beginning god acknowledged it oh and god oh yes he reverenced he respected abel for what he said oh praise the lord he didn't have this bible he started it amen oh yes he started it amen and when it comes to the revelation of faith he started it oh yeah he came forth and smoke amen and oh yes he he paid for it oh yeah he did yes he laid down his life amen exactly amen representing what jesus would do amen because because why because cain killed him oh yeah oh god said okay where's your brother abel god knew where he was but he wanted cain to confess it amen amen he wanted to bring it out amen what was in cain and again like i said cain offered a good sacrifice oh it's excellent excellent oh yeah it was what do you mean the bible explained that yes because it says that abel offered the more excellent well if abel offered the more excellent cocaine offered was excellent when you consider all that he had laid on the altar when you consider there there are canes today when you consider all that they're doing all their lane you know for for for religion and for church and for this and for that amen but still it's not what god wants not what god asks not what god requires well yes there's there's many a day like cain and they think god would have got to be pleased that i do this got to be pleased if i do that god will be pleased if my act this way or say this or talk this way no god god wants you to come according to his word amen brother did did i say this did i say that amen amen where is that in the word of god amen and oh yeah god god might say well that's that's fine but but i said god got a butt but i say unto you amen brother amy he's not he's not going to question it he's not going to cause you to doubt it he's trying to get you to believe it amen but the enemy is there with his butts to get you to doubt it or to add to it oh yeah and there's too many today that are adding to the revelation in their minds and again again it's the influence of the devil amen because again remember what the prophet of god highlighted he said this is the devil's watchtower right here he said in in in the brain in the head and what it comes down he says and how does he deal with us through our feelings and through our intellect and so on but he said god is in the heart he said god deals out of the heart by faith it is written thus saith the lord amen and brother what what what abel did brother it was out of his heart what cain did it was out of his head oh yeah oh he figured oh yeah this will please god i'll i'll give him all of this yeah god wanted something more he wanted you amen praise the name of the lord and brother oh did abel do that well he didn't realize that he was going to do it that way amen but brother he went by faith amen amen for faith they what who told him it was revealed to him in his heart oh it had to be he was out there oh they were lost they were they were cut off you know they were outside the garden of eden and having maybe heard the testimony of adam and eve oh this is what the garden is this is what's like it in the garden this is how we lived in the garden this is this is how we dealt with god in the garden oh yeah oh yeah the old mother sister they they were in contact with eternity amen but pushed out of the garden and put into time amen and cain and abel oh what's going on here what's going on here here's the garden we can't go in the garden there's angels out there keeping us not allowed in oh brother sister but again it came went out and felt that i if i do this if i do that if i do something else it'll please god amen brother brother's got to be what god wants amen now what you feel no no it's what you what what's revealed to you in your heart amen but abel offered unto god the more excellent sacrifice more excellent amen so are you offering the more excellent anointing in your life amen the more excellent amen actions reactions in your heart and soul by the grace of god god help us but we'll have that same anointing that was unable but there's too many brothers still under the anointing of cain they'll do this they'll do this they'll do this for god give you all god guess this give god that oh but no you god wants you amen god wants you and he wants what's in your heart amen brother by the grace of almighty god in your flesh you can do a lot of things but brother is it out of the heart is it by faith is it by faith or is it by your feelings oh a lot of people act by feelings but i tell you god's looking for faith amen said by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain amen and abel obtained a witness oh yeah praise the lord and it says by which he obtained witness that he was he was righteous what yeah he was righteous praise the lord but cain wasn't cain the lord look what he did oh he had to write more the right objective lord look what he did yes but it it is by his intellect not his not not the spirit amen no doubt oh yeah but abel was there to give him a witness and what did he do he killed abel he didn't respect what abel did amen and he said lord he said and god said he's king where's evil god knew but he wanted able to see if cain would or he knew he wouldn't but he'd bring it out confession amen god wants your confession i'm a sinner saved by grace amen brother that's right god wants to see you really humbled yourself to acknowledge what he what he has revealed to you by the grace of god amen and so it is it says that he offered under god a more excellent sacrifice than cain are we offering unto god more excellent sacrifice than what the kings in this hour is doing me cain what else it's king's in this hour too and not only that when it comes to even around the message and all the message believers there's there's a there's a lot of judases theirs yes there's cain's they're judases because the power of god said he said they are pretended brothers judastarians he called them pretended brothers he said that are there to betray you amen god help us amen so he said brother and he said the again by faith it was revealed to abel six thousand years ago oh there wasn't a five whole ministry able we didn't go out to an evangelistic service they wouldn't go to this church or that church it was the church amen he was the church praise the lord and god was in that church and god was revealing himself amen and oh by faith brother he never read this he never had no bibles no it's just i i would say all that he had was the testimony of adam and eve that's right that's all what they what they let them know what happened in the garden and let them know this live and all that amen and then it struck abel that now we're outside and not we're not eternal no we're subject to death oh yeah time oh yeah oh my brother it really struck oh grace brother it really struck abel i trust by grace what god's doing today is dragging us amen the reality of what god did then struck abel the reality of what god's doing now strikes the bride that's right amen amen do we believe what god is doing now as much as abel believed what god did back then and what and what he was experiencing back then being cut off from god amen being put out of the garden but it says he offered the more excellent and again let me say it again you can offer an excellent sacrifice but what god's looking for is the more excellent amen amen and it says by a wit by which he obtained witness he said that he was righteous oh praise the lord he was god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh amen praise the lord and it goes on of course by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death yeah abel experienced it enoch came to testify of resurrection amen and a rapture praise the lord hallelujah brother is right there in the beginning it's for a reason so that at the end we believe it amen amen they i just want to bring it out again shortly the alpha and the omega amen praise the name of the lord god have mercy on us brother i oh brother again understand without faith it is impossible to please him amen amen amen god will you oh brother well faith faith they faith oh yes but don't don't don't blame god if you don't have it because he's there to give it to you amen oh they think well i don't have faith i don't have if you don't have the faith you don't have god because you know god you got a relationship with god you got faith amen because he's there to give you faith amen the faith that pleases him that he wants and you can read that in hebrews 11 or by faith by faith by faith by faith where'd they get it to god gave it to them but they had a choice to accept it or reject it and we got a choice to accept it or reject it god help us amen to believe god help us amen to make our calling election sure by faith amen amen by faith to know that it is god it is christ in me the hope of glory praise the lord god bless you let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe amen [Music] yes [Music] oh

[Music] [Music] all in the name of jesus all things are possible that god has spoken that god has promised hallelujah the resurrection the rapture the change hallelujah the new heaven and the new earth amen hallelujah glory hallelujah all things are possible because now i believe amen god bless you turn with me to ephesians chapter one we've heard the tapes on redemption by power and redemption in completeness and in joy just want to share some thoughts with you concerning again redemption hey praise the lord not only spiritually but physically the promise is there for full complete redemption and in ephesians chapter 1 and beginning to read at verse 9. and it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will praise the lord not religion but it's the revelation of the word so he has truly absolutely made known to you made known to me amen the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself amen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ praise the lord both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will oh praise the name thank god for revelation thank god for understanding amen that he has spoken it and he has revealed it amen that he said we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in him he also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise praise the name of the lord which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory hallelujah it is the the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession praise the lord he paid the price for us now he had to redeem us back amen and he said unto the praise of his glory alleluia wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory hallelujah god help us amen that we are in a very personal way united with him amen that we know him he knows us we know him now he has revealed himself and he is revealing himself to us thank god amen and again verse 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory and says may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation the spirit of wisdom good but we need to understand god's understanding amen see it the way that god sees it knoweth the way that god knows it amen they give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him our lord jesus christ amen the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints praise the lord and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe he said according to the work or working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead amen and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places god bless the rheem his word you may be seated i want to highlight verse 14 which is concerning what he did to the seed of god in verse 13 he said in whom we ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth we trusted god amen after we heard the word of truth in this hour we our trust is in god our faith is in god it is not in the church it's not in man it's in god amen there are too many that are still putting they're putting their faith in a church they're putting their faith in a man no no you've got to put your faith in god because god removes the the man god removes the church so that it's you and god amen says you and the word praise the name of the lord and again he was separating peter peter just why there was a reason why because he had predestinated he had four deemed that peter was going to be the ministry on the day of pentecost amen so brother when he when when he returned there and he and he was talking to peter love without me loveth thou me amen and he talked and talked and talked but until peter got the understanding that that jesus wanted him to get amen peter wanted so he's going to get peter in under the right anointing amen so that brother on that day of pentecost he had the right anointing hallelujah so brother said the holy ghost would would anoint peter and he would say this and he would say that amen he wasn't going to question it it wasn't going to be his intellect no it was going to be the spiritual revelation of the holy ghost amen it wasn't peter it was the holy ghost amen it wasn't peter it was christ in peter praise the lord hallelujah so i pray the grace of god it's not you amen it's not me when it comes to saying oh we're going to give we're witnessing this or witnessing that we're saying this saying that no no hallelujah brother we're dead amen and now it's christ living in us praise the lord it is christ living in you as christ revealing himself in you is right christ revealing himself through you amen so it's not me that lives it's christ that liveth in me and brother if his christ living in me is christ talking in me it's christ living in me is christ witnessing to others through me oh brother let's let go and let god have his way oh in the name of jesus brother i pray in the name of jesus that it's the anointing of the holy ghost in us it's the name of the holy ghost it's the life of christ in control amen so it's not me thinking this it's christ in me it's not me saying this is christ in me amen oh brother this is tremendous oh brother and i pray the grace of god that we we truly have the anointing of christ in us amen that we truly have the true baptism of the holy ghost in our souls brother not not an experience in our flesh but brother it's a revelation on the inside of the inside amen there are too many going out there with just intellectual knowledge and feelings amen and then they're going to they'll they'll give their witness intellectually amen and based on what they're feeling this feeling this no brother if you're if you're a true seed of god brother it's not what you feel in your head not what you're feeling your flesh is what you reveal what you believe in your heart amen brother because god is not doing not working on our feelings he's working in our in our spirit he's working in our soul amen so he's not to get you to say this and say this and do this and do this and and all based on your feelings no it's based on your revelation amen regardless of what you feel is what you believe amen not do do you feel this no do you believe this amen brother but again even with christ within the flesh he was dealing too much with feelings and not with revelation oh yeah his disciples were walking by sight not by faith amen martha mary they were going by sight they were not by faith amen but jesus was there amen to exercise faith amen that's why when he said this said this said this he said believe us now this amen oh we we believe this we believe that well but but no not in the present tense it was future tense amen brother if god is doing anything and has been doing anything right from the beginning it's present tense amen brother the revelation that abel had praised the name of the lord it was a present tense revelation and brother oh hallelujah it was oh yes it was it was testifying of redemption praise the name of the lord hallelujah i trust by the grace of god that our witness uh uh what that we're giving you know brother is a testimony of our redemption amen praise the name of the lord brother that the whole thing right from genesis to revelation right from abel right on down to the last predestinated elected seat of god brother our testimony is a testimony of redemption amen abel in the beginning was testified of redemption oh abel what about this what about that oh yeah and he and like i said cain went out and and and he planted this and planted that and he grew this and grew that in a farm and he brought all this to to give to god but what did abel do abel he didn't do that he went out he went out and got he got this sheep what he went and his shot cain able what in the world why in the world would they would able do that amo why did you go out and kill the sheep why do you go ahead and kill that lamb he didn't do anything why didn't you do this why didn't you do that but he went out and he killed the lamb and then when he brought it in and he took the blood and he put it over over the altar amen why it was by faith brother what was cain's faith and what was abel's faith amen what was it what what sort of redemption the the king that believed and what kind of a redemption did abel believe amen what was able looking for why did abel do this brother this is this was rate the first sacrifice after the fall the first sacrifice amen that after after god had closed the eden amen but adam i put eve out amen and they did this and they did that and so on amen and here come and and there comes abel oh they they oh yeah they want to put their sacrifices here for the lord and then and lay this down lay that down oh this will please god that it please god and what what in the world gave abel the feeling or the or the faith what if the world gave abel the idea that he would have to go out and kill this lamb that he would have to bring it back as it were and he would have to shed the blood around the altar what you mean to tell me that that's the kind of god i serve that's what god wants me to do amen brother i tell you this oh my really religion it's like cane out there and they'll they'll leave you with the impression that you got to do this you got to do this oh yeah and this will please god that'll please god amen brothers it goes more serious than that amen brother god required a greater sacrifice amen that is as it were as he laid down his life now he wants you to lay down your life amen brother he wants you to make this sacrifice and that sacrifice amen amen where what kind of a sacrifice is it you're paying a price yes a man brother k kane when it comes to he wasn't exactly it wasn't he wasn't losing much because he he had grown a lot and he didn't really need a lot so all the extra that he had he could bring that and lay down the altar and he said well i'm going to give that to god uh lord lord forgive forgive us of our sin am i going to offer this amen offer that as a covering for sin off of that for redemption amen and yet here comes abel absolutely amen um brother he's not bringing to this he didn't need that great big altar that cain had he didn't need all of that amen but here comes abel with this with this sheep what are you going to do evil oh and he kills it sheds the blood amen well cain didn't catch that brother's name that's like us in this hour concerning what we believe amen and concerning the the the life that god is looking for in you and anybody amen in the believers and yet there are churches oh they they think you're crazy oh god don't want you to do this god don't want you to do that god wants you to die to yourself amen oh they think oh well god have blessed me with this and god have blessed me with that and the prophet of god did say he said that's the problem you do with man he said all they want from god is there is good things they want god to do this for them they want god to do that they want god to do that amen oh yeah but it's all physical and it's not it's not it's not a revelation of redemption to think that that oh well lord i want you to redeem me i want you to bless me that was that's their feeling oh lord i want you to do this i'll do this i'll give you this lord and if you bless me with more of it i'll give more to you oh yeah well brother god god wanted something more than more than more than that oh yes amen so abel went out there and abel came back amen with a rev brother had a revelation in his heart oh yeah it was amen brother he had a he had a revelation and he knew i i believe with all my heart he knew that that this is what this is what they're going to need for redemption they're going to need a more perfect sacrifice amen and this one was going to represent the sacrifice that that god was going to bring in christ amen amen oh yeah my brother and what cain offered didn't represent jesus no no not by any means no but what evil offered did it was redemption amen so brother sister i pray grace amen that we got we got the revelation that abel had amen of why he was doing this and why he was doing that amen brother what a revelation that he had that would have caused him a man and him and inspire him amen and anoint him to do what he did oh yeah what kind of anointing would did did what was there uh unable or what kind of anointing did cain have well look at look at the anointing that canada look what it did look what he did oh that was good cain you you you're you're really good you're really generous and so on yeah no brother i tell you this that that all that was all sin that represented a dead in a dying world amen that's right but brother what what abel offered oh hallelujah it was representing eternal life representing absolute complete redemption amen restoration back into fellowship with god again amen brother cain never had to fellowship with god god cut him off and god kicked him out yeah now he said cain if you do well won't you also be accepted what if you're going to do like abel did oh you wouldn't do that and people are not going to take the stand that we take people are not going to stay they will take the stand for the word that you and i are taking in this hour and this age no not by any means what we got to do we do it for jesus we're doing it for god we're done because we love the lord amen and lord you did this for us lord we're going to do this for you thank you lord amen and lord you did this for us and lord this we consider this to be small we'll do more for you lord amen by the grace of almighty god redemption god give us the revelation that we need of redemption amen brother redemption of our souls good praise the lord but we also need redemption of our bodies amen it's not only a spiritual redemption it's a physical redemption amen we have believed for the spiritual now we're encouraged to believe for the physical amen praise the name of the lord if this tabernacle be dissolved we got one already waiting eternal in the heavens amen he's redeemed us spiritually now he's redeeming us physically praise the name of the lord brother for four thousand years they were believing and and preaching concerning redemption redemption redemption amen through the sacrifices that abel had through the sacrifices that the others had and this one and lamb after lamb after lamb after lamb amen amen it was redemption till finally jesus came and again i i i know brother john was there then but i was preaching that way back years ago oh yes jonathan was there and and were the groups that were fighting killing out there in the ocean what were they called greenpeace yeah back then they were greenpeace they wouldn't they'd try to stop the fishermen from doing this don't do this don't do this don't kill them they'll kill this and and then i was preaching on uh uh about the sacrifices that solomon was making in the new temp in the temple when he was at all restoring the temple and everything all the thousands and thousands of sacrifice that were made i said it's a good job greenpeace wasn't there amen and i did notice that brother lanny was there at the time in the church and he had i think it was three three gentlemen with him and i know when i when i ministered on that and i highlighted that oh they thought that was tremendous oh yeah and they all they all started to laugh amen because oh greenpeace yeah that's right i said greenpeace greenpeace wouldn't like it i said if if they were back there when solomon was doing the temple i said why i said all these thousands of sacrifices yeah thousands they killed them yeah amen so brother what are we willing to do in this hour amen what sacrifices are we willing to make you know for oh yeah well but brother i don't know you really gotta make oh yes i believed all my heart the closer we're going to get to it the more the greater and greater sacrifice god's going to require oh yeah the greater greater separation from the world and the things of the world the greater greater separation from the foolishness of this whole world it's getting worse and worse and worse and it's going to get worse amen and concerning again all that's going on concerning copenhagen 19 and and these other issues concerning the the diseases amen brother i prophesied of it or rather the prophet of god prophesied of it amen and it's a germ warfare and i did i i did sure share that prophecy with with ministering brethren uh message people and all and i noticed that one of the brethren he didn't like it well it's a brother that most of us we all know here but he's in the states amen oh yeah and he sort of made light of it and joked about it and and and to to his church and trying to say that i was wrong in in in giving them this quote it was a quote of the prophet in 1954 concerning the german warfare he said there's coming a german warfare amen and this and this and this and so on oh he said that's just to the jews that got nothing to do with us oh well i'll tell you this brother they're going to be surprised amen because the problem of god did say it's coming even to the gentiles amen because he said it in 54 but he also said it in 1964. i am so i pray the grace of god be with us be on our guard brother let's stay with the word let's be more sincere let's be spiritual not religious let's be spiritual amen and keep focusing on the word keep focusing on what god has done and focus on what god is doing and what is it it's redemption it's redemption brother what god started after the fall and he continued right on down in into our lord jesus christ amen that redemption of our souls and father with any and and and he moved on giving us the promise of redeeming our bodies yeah to look up that's right for the change so brother i pray grace that we'll not lose the revelation of redemption we heard two messages as i said one is redemption by power and the other one was redemption incompleteness and so on father there's a redemption of our souls but what god's working on now is the redemption of our bodies amen he gave he gave us that word to believe this and he did it and he did it and he did it and and pointed back to what he did to redeem our souls now brother hallelujah now he's pointing us to the redemption of our bodies now amen and there's still a lot can't won't do it they believe that oh yeah well that's our that's uh i i've tried to talk to certain believers and they say brother brother lush they said oh that that's in the future no i said it's now they didn't believe it i said god's doing that now i said he has redeemed us spiritually and we are redeemed we're brought back into fellowship with god amen see what happened sin in the beginning took us away from the fellowship with god and now god wants to redeem us to bring back us bring us back into that fellowship amen but now not only spiritually but physically amen amen praise the name of the lord again the lord willing and not tonight but another time i'll draw it out again and show you as the prophet of god drew that circle and then he said now here he said we went down into time and we go back he said back up here to eternity amen so what is god doing down here it is redemption he's redeeming our souls and he's redeeming our bodies amen to bring us back to eternity and brother once when it's all finished then god removes the time time is gone we're back to eternity again amen amen brother this uh grace to us amen to really really believe that we have been redeemed spiritually and by the grace of god we are being redeemed physically amen praise the name of the lord i tell you this amen the spiritual redemption is leading to the physical redemption amen amen the prophet said he said remember he said without this without the spiritual redemption there'd be no healing no he said because we've been redeemed in our souls he said there's god is there to heal us amen hallelujah brother let's believe brother and i tell you this we're believing for healing amen and not not just because i'm sick i gotta be healed of this kneel to that no brother it's to complete healing amen are being changed from time to eternity hallelujah hallelujah they're going out of this body into a glorified body by the grace of almighty god amen brother oh my i pray god help us to take it serious amen brother abel brother back there six thousand years ago he took a serious amen cain went and took what he had serious but he just felt now oh well i don't mind doing this i don't mind doing that yeah well thank the lord and so on but but abel he took us serious to the extent that he had to go out all mind just think i pray the grace of god whether that was with abel that would be with us amen oh he had to make that sacrifice i pray grace we're there to make that sacrifice amen we that we're going to lay ourselves down amen amen jesus is going to lift us up amen by the grace of god brother believing for redemption spiritually our souls back into fellowship with god amen but now we're believing for redemption physical so we're going back into a glorified body to have fellowship with god again not just spiritual it's going to be a physical redemption amen hallelujah brother there's too many focusing just focusing on the spiritual redemption spiritual redemption spiritual redemption yeah he's done that but what about the physical redemption amen amen grace to us because brother that's what he wants that's what he started out that's what he's going to finish amen he started out he redeems us spiritually but then he's working on physical redemption praise the lord hallelujah again we could draw it out and show you what god was doing down to the church ages and it was spiritual redemption spiritual redemption but hallelujah they all laid down their lives believing for the physical redemption oh yeah they did amen hallelujah believing that they're going to come forth in glorified bodies praise the lord so brother god god wants to focus our attention now on the resurrection and rapture praise the lord hallelujah brother that's the faith that god's working on amen by faith abel offered this sacrifice by faith the bride is offering this sacrifice grace grace in the name of jesus there's some other scriptures that i had here let's see revelation turn with me to revelation why revelation chapter one i want to leave you that understanding there's a spiritual redemption and but now god is working on a physical redemption to get us back to eternity to get us back into fellowship with him that's right as we were before the fall amen in the glorified bodies amen hallelujah that it that was a man that was in eternity even before the foundation of the world praise the lord brother it was god re with the revelation of redemption from abel to jesus and his god with the revelation of redemption from peter pontius to a physical redemption praise the lord thank god for the spiritual but praise god for the revelation of the physical amen brother we got the spiritual i'll tell you as much as we were hungry and thirsting for the spiritual redemption god wants you to hunger and thirst for the physical amen we wanted to get back into that fellowship with god amen spiritually but brother if there if we really love the lord we want to get back in fellowship with god physically amen amen and in revelation chapter 1 and let's begin to read it verse let's see verse i got verse 3. blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is that end amen brother they went 4 000 years yes from the time of abel and we've only been 2 000 years now says peter and jesus brother how much longer it's been 67 years since the prophet has gone unbelievable i'll tell you this when we first came to this message maybe in 1965 we thought maybe all well by 1977 everything will be over with oh yeah we thought or even sometimes we said oh maybe two or three years after the prophet left we've taken off the earth after two or three years all of their bid rapture no 1968 we're still here went on i said well maybe 1970. no after 97 they still here well we were looking through until 1973 and then on to 1977 yeah until finally we stopped we stopped looking at the calendar amen and we left it with the lord amen amen to believe what while lord is in your hands we we believe that what you've done you've done to get us to focus on the resurrection to get us to focus on the rapture by the grace of god amen so god help us to believe not to doubt for the time is at hand oh yeah grace of god and john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come amen and from the seven spirits which are before his throne hallelujah and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood brother help us look what he did in redemption we've been redeemed spiritually what about our faith to be redeemed physically as we were believing for this we got to believe for this you know we believe for god to save us bring us back into fellowship with him and our souls now lord we want to get back into fellowship with you in our bodies god help us and he had made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds yeah and he did and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen and verse 8 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end saith the lord which is which was and which is to come the almighty amen praise the lord but god is the eternal god amen no beginning no end but he says i am alpha and omega i am the beginning and the end amen praise the lord because he's the beginning and the end of time praise the lord he's beginning in the end of redemption praise the lord spiritual redemption physical redemption amen he give us the revelation as he get able amen and he's given us the revelation that he is the yes as he gave john oh yeah because john when john saw him oh praise the lord john fell at his feet and worshiped him amen because he wasn't he wasn't going just by faith oh it was by sight his faith was come that becomes sight and jesus was real yeah oh he was well yes and and they did he did lay his life down but he ascended up and he came back and revealed himself to john amen to the extent that john or john recognized him and john fell and worshiped him yeah and he always and when john saw him brother that's the way you and i are going to see him in that body grace amen brother that our revelation of jesus will move beyond spirit into physical revelation of jesus hallelujah amen the prophet of god saw jesus in body form he did and that's why he did say that our brother brown he said he looked he looked a lot like jesus he did yeah amen our brother david was looking at the picture of brother brown and he oh him i said that's him the prophet said i said oh he when he looked at when he saw our brother brown he said oh you remind the name of jesus that he saw it was that real god help us brother i pray grace i tell you if he's real to us spiritually he'll be real to us physically so let's let's make sure that we're into a oneness with that revelation of jesus i know him and he knows me amen i fellowship with him he fellowship with me i talk to him he talks to me amen grace if you don't know him now you won't know him then grace he said i am alpha and omega why is the if the alpha and the omega of redemption praise the lord the beginning and the end and then he's taking us back to eternity amen we're going beyond the revelation of alpha and omega amen into the revelation of god eternal amen but brother he's revealed as alpha and omega in the revelation of redemption getting back to eternity when redemption is done redemption is finished redemption is over with amen finished thank you jesus we're redeemed we've we fell but now you brought us back amen but we won't fall tomorrow hallelujah because the devil is going to be going to be cast out praise the lord we won't have to deal with no devil no not by any means amen praise the name of the lord let's go to revelation chapter 21. praise the name of the lord he is revealed as the alpha omega is revealed as our redeemer amen in revelation 21 and again let's begin at verse 3 and i heard a great voice head of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god amen and praise the lord and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying and neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away thank god oh my grace grace grace to get in to that dimension grace to get into that place with our lord amen just think we won't even remember we won't remember pain we won't remember an age we won't remember nothing no we'll be back into eternity grace there'll be no more pain and for the former things are passed away praise the lord and he that said upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of water of life freely amen praise the lord in the revelation of him as our alpha and omega it is finished it's done praise the lord he was the beginning of it redemption he was the end of it amen bringing us back into eternal life and he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son amen but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderer murderers and or mongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death amen so they're going to have their part or their time in the lake amen but eventually they're gone amen they'll they'll be destroyed totally completely yeah grace grace god's grace to us amen and revelation chapter 22. praise the lord and verse 8 and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things and then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god some have indicated that this was brother branham in in the ministry of that angel that that prophet for the last days amen to introduce jesus to the bridegroom that's right and that that's that's entire i'm not going to doubt it or say no it's not but they say this is this is this was william branham that angel represented william branham and he said he oh yeah because he was the one that revealed these things we're showing john these things showing this showing this and well he was the prophet to whom the mystery of god was revealed yeah amen and then saith thee unto me see thou do it not because john was going to worship him oh yeah yeah and there's there's many today that still worship william branham there are certain countries i could mention where we we've had the deal with brethren in those countries over the years we had to deal with brethren that are worshiping william branham yeah and there was one one of those countries that someone took pictures there and and there was believers marching oh yeah and they had big big pictures and and they were marching with those holding them up william branham is lord yeah william brown is jesus oh yeah yeah that's what they felt but he wasn't he was the prophet introducing jesus amen so he said and then john was going to worship worshiping right here and he said no no no don't worship me he said i'm just one of your brethren the prophets amen he said said unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god and i've had to deal with those brethren i've had to deal with those spirits trying to encourage them no no no that he was not god god was in him god was with him but revealing himself to us amen so i said he was just a prophet so the grace of god brother oh yeah and that's maybe one of the reasons why the lord had to take him as soon as he did at such a young age yeah oh yeah because there are people no not only in those those overseas countries there's also people even in america and canada that worship brother brown they did we've had to deal with that over the years grace to us well again the scripture because john was going to worship him the prophet amen because of what he was showing john because of what he was doing this this and this and john i guess he felt that he really was it was a deity of some there with the lord amen and he said unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at end and he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy lit and be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still what an hour we're living please let's stay with the word amen brother let's become more and more spiritual please not let's get beyond just being religious amen be spiritual sons and daughters of god amen and he said let him be righteous and he that is holy let him be holy still and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be again i am alpha and omega it is the revelation of god in redemption the beginning amen praise the lord god stepping down from eternity into time it is the eternal god revealing himself as the alpha of redemption and the omega he began it he finished it amen god help us brother what an hour we're living what a tremendous hour we're living my brother it's not going on and on and on and for generations and for generations for generations they've all came up come up and believed and went on believed and went on believed and went on pressing on pointing on pointing on but brother it comes to a generation where we don't look forward we gotta look up oh yeah there's a generation and there was there was these revivals this revival look forward look forward looking for another one looking for another one looking for this amen but then there comes come a revelation to come a generation no look up because jesus said the bible said when you see this when you see this look up because your redemption draws near your redemption draws near look up amen uh in every generation they were pointed on to the next generation they went from one messenger to another messenger to another messenger amen to finally the last messenger and he's not pointing to another one look up he's pointing us to the resurrection he's pointing us to the rapture amen god help us to understand god have us to believe it is finished god help our young people here to really be sincere and humble yourself receiving him as your lord and savior to give your life to him look up or god that's going to require a tremendous sacrifice among the young oh yeah because god's going to get is calling for them to turn away from the world the things of the world become spiritual like mom paul like grandma and grandpa yeah she's not it's not loving the world no no it's not loving the things of the world is loving god oh yeah i tell you this it's a separated walk for the for for mom and dad grandma and grandpa but god is calling for a greater and it's going to get a be a greater and greater separation for our young people well yeah because you want you're going to live for god oh for well for for mom and dad well well they're getting older so you know not attracted to this not attracted to that because they get older that's right thank god but again as the young the enemy is there to attract you more and more and more but god is there to give you the revelation you need to focus on him and to focus on eternity to focus on jesus amen to focus on heaven amen to focus on a new body eternity does our young people here do do you really want to do you want to go and to be with the lord as much as mom and dad does are you going to put your focus and attention on heaven and on jesus as much as mom and dad is or grandma and grandpa oh well they're old and you know so you know they could be going to die anytime so they they need to be ready spiritually yes but our young people needs to be ready spiritually considering considering the hour we're living considering the world we're living in oh yes and all that's going on in the world you know it's finished don't don't stop and think well i'm just young and so i don't have to worry about this and i i can live on for another so many years no no no don't think that it is finished and brother that's yes for us as the older ones and for our brothers and sisters ears the young ones it is finished god help us and i pray the grace of god to mom and dad he has to be the right witness yeah grandma and grandpa be a witness amen to your children amen let them be spiritual by the grace of god amen and brother we come down to the final revelation and he said i am the alpha and the omega at the beginning of this redemption i'm the end of it it's finished now amen the beginning and the end the first and the last grace and blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life see where we come to let's make sure we're partaking of the tree of life eternal life and it says i may enter in through the gates into the city for without our dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh the lie yeah yeah see we're back again to genesis yea as god said but don't let the devil put any buts into the word amen you face the reality of the word the truth of the word amen that it is the end it's finished the enemy will say yes but yes but no get thee behind me satan amen and he said i jesus has sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches and i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star amen and the spirit look at how close look at where we are at the end it's finished the spirit and the brights they come not just the spirit the spirit and the bride amen the spirit and the bride say come and let him that earth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely the word it is the word amen for i testify unto every man that heared the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in the book this book again the enemy is there as i said to add yes but yes but and there's oh yeah there's ministering brethren and believers around the message even in this hour they're saying yes but yes but this but they spot this oh yes i've heard those ministries god help us to believe it we don't need no buts we need to believe it the way it is amen and he said if any man shall take away the words of the book of the this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book might as well finish it and he which testified these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen we need the grace revelation of our lord jesus christ to believe yes for the redemption of our souls but to believe for the redemption of our bodies and brother if god is focusing on anything down through the ages he was focusing on that spiritual redemption to get us back into fellowship with him but naturally or spirit or spiritually but now he's focusing on physical redemption to get us to back into physical fellowship with him by the grace of god amen and brother grace grace grace yes we believe the message we believe what god has done but do we believe what god's doing yeah that was that was oh yes that was jesus yeah you know it's jesus in the clouds jesus and the pillar of fire amen praise the lord it was christ on the prophet's shoulder outside the church yeah and as i said that the gentleman that took that picture did contact me and wanted to know if i could provide him with a copy of the picture because he said brother he said i he said i took that picture and he said i did give it to i think he gave it to brother billy paul and so on and he said i'd like to be able to get a copy he said it's because he said he didn't he gave them the negatives he gave them everything that that that involved the picture so i did i did do it yes and got got a copy of the picture for him amen so he would recognize what god had done because i was explaining to him what it what who's who it was on brother ram's shoulder and shared with them other pictures amen concerning the prophet so again that's quite a while ago since he took that picture you know but he but at that time a few years ago he might be going on now but he was he was still around for a number of years so brother sister it is it is god that is jesus in the cloud
