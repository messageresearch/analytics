Lord complications Lord praying you'd also be with brother Chad especially today Lord and his workers Lord just toiling away Lord may you keep them safe Lord grant them Grace each one we ask Lord Just Have Your Way in this service we ask now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you prepared for the evening for we ask it in his name and for his glory amen there's many people who coming to the service likes to always mark down what a minister has to say or read from the scripture and if you do that I want you to turn with me tonight for just a little reading found over in the book of St Matthew's gospel the 15th chapter the 21st to the 28th verse I would read this then Jesus went thin and departed into the coast of thyra of cyan sidon and behold a woman of canaa came out of the same coast and Cried unto him have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us but he answered and said I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat for me to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wil and her daughter was made whole from that very hour if I would call this a text I would like to speak just a moment or for a few minutes rather upon the subject of perseverance I thought being that Mrs mcferson and the churches all always stood so gallantly for Divine Healing and we cannot preach the Full Gospel without preaching Divine Healing because it is part of the Gospel I remember as a little boy reading an article in one of the magazines life or look or some of those magazines I was justed a young l a of them making a light of Mrs mcferson of preaching Divine Healing and they said that she had a a trick that she did said women that had garer she put a pen under her finger and the women put a balloon under her garment then Mrs M to lay hands on the woman would stick the pen into the the balloon and would deflate the balloon I was a sinner but I had better sense than that to think such a thing if the pen stuck the balloon it would burst so I said no doubt but what that woman is suffering uh persecution and then since I have become a worker in the vineyard I realized what she had to stand standing for truths you're always hated of the enemy the word perseverant means to be I think according to Webster persistent to be perseverant persistent in making a goal and every person on Earth or it's every been on Earth that ever achieved anything had it amounted to anything had to be perseverant you've got to be sure first what you've got your faith anchored in now Faith is just not a thing that's so easily floated around it at some kind of a we would call it in the street expression a Hocus Pocus faith can only have its its right position when it's placed upon uh something that's steadfast if I told you to go out and put your hand on that tree and be healed you could doubt that so why we have no background to anything youd only have my word and if I told you that washing in a certain water out here in the in the valley would bring healing to you it would depend on how much confidence you had in me and Faith cometh by hearing hearing what the word of God therefore if this be the word of God and it is what it teaches we can rest upon it God cannot change God must far ever remain God his word must be just as true and this age as it ever was in any age now we are finite we can say something this year and maybe even tomorrow have to alter it because we're not too sure because we're finite we're just presuming and presume means to Adventure without Authority but When God says anything it's perfect he don't have to alter Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but with strong giving praise to God because he know that he was able to perform or to keep or to do that what he had promised then if God's ever called on the scene for a decision and the decision that God makes first it has to Forever remain the same it can never change it cannot be altered because he's infinite and anything that's infinite never had a beginning or an end so he cannot take it back next year and say I was wrong and then if that was his decision then every man that makes that same uh comes to that same decision that God made for one man upon the basis of his faith to believe it he's got to meet that same thing every time a man believes it God's got to act every time the way he acted the first time or he acted wrong the first time and who can ACC God of acting wrong God's got to ever remain with his decision if thou can't believe now to achieve anything you've got to set a goal and say this I I believe and tie yourself to it and keep drawing moving up closer to it knowing that you it's there knowing that there's something there that you're coming to like it was said the little boy with a kite holding the string in his hand he said the man said what are you holding son he said my kite he said I don't see nothing but a string he said but there's a kite on the end of it the man looked up said' I don't see the kite the little boy said neither do I he saidwell how do you know you got a kite he said I can feel it tugging at the end that's the way faith is Faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence of things not seen as long as you set your faith on it and then anchor to it you're coming to it no matter if you can't see it or not you know it's there anyhow you're tugging at it and it's pulling you and any man that's ever done anything worthwhile has set a goal and then been persistent perseverant to make that great man George Washington the father of our nation is called when he come to Valley Forge after all night in prayer until he was wet with the snow up above his hips kneeling in the snow the next morning he crossed Delaware full of ice why he was persevering he had the answer nothing's going to stand in his way although three or four bus musket bullets went through his coat but it never hurt him he tried wanted to achieve something and he had prayed through on it and he was perseverant nothing stood in his way could you imagine Noah in his days how perseverant Noah was now he was just a farmer and they lived in a greater day of scientific research perhaps than we have today because in those days they built pyramids and if any of you had the privilege of being at the big Egyptian pyramid and seeing the Sphinx and so forth why it's amazing to see how they ever did get those Boulders up there in the air almost a city block high that weighed thousands of tons today we could not reproduce it we don't understand they had something they had a die they had something they could embomb a body with that would make it look quite natural for thousands of years we don't have those Arts colorings and so forth that they had a great scientific age but one day while Noah was out in the the field maybe uh fixing his crop God appeared to him and told him make ready for the saving of your household and build an ark and it's going to rain now we all know that the anian world it had not rained and now that didn't cope with the scientific uh thinkers of that day his message was contrary no doubt that smart scientists could have come to him and said now look here Mr Noah now we got instruments that we can shoot the moon and we can uh do all these scientific researches and there is no water up there and how is there going to come any water down from there when there's no water up there to come down you're a foolish you're doing something that there's nothing to there's no water up there but Noah could say God said that it would rain and that settles it God said so 120 years he was persistent in the face of the scientific world of his day still claiming his message was right because it come from God he had a goal to make he had a message to take care of and he was persistent in doing so no matter what the rest of the world said Noah heard from God Amen that's all it mattered to him he had heard heard the voice he was sure it was God and he was making ready something that seemed very silly to the world but yet Noah knew that God would keep his word should that not be a lesson for us today hour as Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man a message that's silly to the world they don't understand it but yet those who contacted the Holy Spirit knows that he will return again I can see the people as they pitted poor old Noah about how much fun he was missing and of the world and the things was going on but Noah still persistant held right on one day God said to Noah all right you've done your part now now come into the ark you and your household and the notice the the birds begin to fly in and and the Animals begin to go in by two by two Noah and his family went in and there's always borderline Believers I call them people that'll come to church they'll enjoy a message maybe from the choir or from the singers from the minister or a testimony they'll enjoy it but to come in and be part of it they just won't do it they like to listen but they won't be part of it they do not want to be identified with them they want to stay off to one side that's always been and no doubt there was in that day then when the ark door was closed many of those people said well let's go up and stand around now if it comes to pass that for instance the old man was right we all kind of thought that the old fell was a little bit off but I I I enjoyed listening that he preach standing there in the door and now we know that something closed that door now he's a good old man and if it would happen to be some water come down up there why well he'd take us in you see you don't want to trust you don't want to strain God's goodness you want to be sure that you just come in while you got a chance to come in then the first thing you know the first day look at how God puts a strain on his people sometime I imagine the first day Noah said to his family all right now we're climb up into the upstairs now in the morning the skies are going to be dark never was dark before we've never seen it rains go to fall lightning will sweep across the skies and the next morning up comes the sun no sign all day long knowing his family look well than went on just exactly the way they did I imagine the borderline Believers said oh the old fell was wrong they went on back downtown eating drinking and being married imagine his family what a strain it must have been on the man but he didn't give up and start knocking on the door and saying people pry the door open I was wrong why he knew he had the truth and he held on to it if it didn't rain today it will tomorrow that's it Hallelujah all right then the second day come and we notice the sun came up and crossed over just like it did the every day no sign of rain still he was persistent on to seven days Noah was sitting right there said if it didn't rain today it will tomorrow see he was anchored he was persistent perseverant because he know that God said so and it had to be that way now finally on the seventh day when he looked out the window the skies were blackening the wind was blowing across the hills the trees were bending over people were screaming not knowing what to do and after a while great big drops of rain begin to break down for the first time striking up on the streets the sewers filled up all the Springs broke up the water began to rise people got into their boats and they sank the winds were rough and it got deeper and deeper and deeper after a while been come up on the ship he watched out the window finally the people screaming there's no way for him to reach out and get them he was way up in the upper story they' send way their day of Grace the there was no more left for them it's too late then finally what a feeling it must have been to Noah when he watched out on the street and seen all the little uh boats whether they were God constructed or not you see people think that today they can construct their own arc they can make their own salvation you can't do it that's right God made the salvation for us and we've got to accept it just the manc constructed AR will not stand anything that man can achieve it's contrary to the will and the word of God it will not stand but how it must have been when Mrs Noah and her daughter-in-laws and and son Sons and so forth when they seen this water coming up on the ark and yet the ark was still sitting flat but after a while they fell it cut loose she was floating oh Noah knew that all of his what he had tried to achieve what he had done his message is paying off then it was cut loose he was leaving the Earth like it is when a man will stay not come up and shake hands with a pastor put his name on a book but when he'll stay there until he feels something Cut Loose inside of him and he begins to float out y by faith knowing that his sins are passed and he's anchored his soul in Christ and there's something raising him higher and higher persistent perseverant Moses was very perseverant after he had went down in Egypt and killed a man and with all of his education and his training and yet he done the thing wrong be because he trusted and what he could achieve by his education and by his own uh we're told that he was a military man and what he had been trained to do we find out that it failed and when it failed he wasn't persevering on that he run to the Wilderness for 40 years but one time he met God in a burning bush took off his shoes he saw the glory of God he seen a dry stick turn into a serpent and go back to his stick again he saw a Le hand be healed by the power of God and he heard the voice of God speak to him nothing's going to stop him man hallu I've often described him I hope it's not a sacrilegious way an old man 80 years old with his wife sitting straddling mu with a A young and on her hip the next day and a beard hanging down the sticking his hand going just eyes set up in and towards the skies a white beard up blowing and somebody say where you going Moses I'm going down to Egypt to take over a oneman Invasion hallu hallu it looked kind of ridiculous but God's ways to the carnal mind is ridiculous but it's precious to those who's anchored in it they know what they're talking about they press on oh what a thing that must have been Noah or Moses rather going down to Egypt a nation that had the world scared about like Russia Today a oneman Invasion an old man 80 years old with his wife sitting on a mule and a crooked stick in his hand going down to take over the things strange about it to the world he did do it he tuck over God only has to have one man one person somewhere that's tied to him someone who knows where they're standing and persevering the persecution and difference doesn't bother him at all going down to take over and he did it it looked very ridiculous and there stood a man some 14t tall or more I believe his finger 14 in long with a spear in his hand like a Weaver's needle probably half from here at the door out there standing over and challenging Israel there was Saul on the other side Head and Shoulders above his army a trained man all of them well trained and bluffed that's right and the devil wanted to proposition with them that's the way the devil does it when he thinks he's got the best sign come over let's not have no Bloodshed just two of us if I whip your man then we'll you'll serve us if he kills me then there'll only be one of us die instead of armies of us what a proposition he can make everybody was scared to death and it looked ridiculous to see a little stoop shouldered kid come up with a little sheep skin wrapped around him a slingshot on his side with some raisin cakes in his hand to see his brothers that devil made his boast in the front of a man of God one time and he called his hand on it why he knowed who God was said uh you mean to tell me that you'll let the armies of the Living God let that uncircumcised Philistine defy the armies of the Living God I'll go fight him oh my why he was persistent his brother said oh we know you're naughty go on back home with them sheep dad told you watch you just come up here to see the battle you can't out talk a man of God when something's done happen to him so he goes up to Saul Saul I imagine scratch his head and look down he said I admire your courage son but that man is a warrior that man is a Warrior from his Youth and you're nothing buddy Youth and don't know nothing about a sling or about a spear or how to doel oh but watch him in doce something your servant kept the sheep for his father and he said one day a bear came in and he took one of my father's lambs and I went after him and I slew him and then a lion come in he got one I took him out and I went after him and I slew him now he said the god that give me the victory over the bear and Over The Line how much more will he give me the victory over that uncircumcised Philistine that's defying the armies of the Living God Saul said but you're just a kid he said you haven't got nothing on just a little sheep skin wait I I'll put my armor on you so he tuck him and put his armor on him could you imagine the Bible said he was Ruddy a little bitty maybe 110 lb man putting on a great big armor of a man we about 250 about 7 foot and something tall his all mashed down could you imagine that David looked around the shoulders about that much too far out and it looked like a skirt on him hanging way down like that his breastplate he he found out that the ecclesiastical vest didn't fit a man of God said take the thing off of me I don't know nothing about it but let me go with what I knows right there you are went the power of the spirit I believe it's Hudson Taylor once said to a Chinese missionary this Chinese boy said Mr Taylor I have felt my call in Christ he said shall I go now and study to get my bachelor of Art and then for my PhD and all I have to have my doctor's degree Mr Taylor said go now son go now don't wait till that time comes you'll waste away too much of your life I think that's right I agree with Mr Taylor go now I'm not trying to support my ignorance Now by trying to say we don't need educ education that might have its place but Education Without salvation has no anchor it's all sails and no anchor go when the candle's lit don't wait till it's half burn up go when you light it if you don't know nothing no more than how it got lit tell others how it got lit maybe they'll get lit too so just as soon as the candles lit go tell everybody how you got your candle lit and maybe they'll get lit off of you see notice certainly David was persistent because he knew Samson was met on the field one day with a thousand Philistines around him and he looked all around there he wasn't a trained man but know how to doel but when he turned his head he felt that Covenant them locks strike his shoulders that's all he had to feel he got the first thing in his hand was a Jawbone of a mule and he beat down a thousand Philistines why he was persistent because he know that God made a covenant with him of those Seven Locks long as they hung in their place nothing was going to bother him oh brother sister how the Church of the Living God ought to stand tonight persistent as long as we can feel the Covenant of the Holy Spirit the blood of Jesus Christ cleansing us from all sin you should never let nothing stand in our way persistent certainly John the great prophet that was spoke of to raise up when he was in the wilderness he was told by God there's looking for a messiah of course 400 years before that had a prophet but God told him in the wilderness he said now they'll try to tell you uh doctor so and so is a guy ought to be the Messiah if you to announce him why he's the best person in our congregation and they're going to say well the the high priest's grandson up here he's a he's the Gody should have it and so forth but look John this is a real job you've got to be sure so I'm going to give you a sign upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining upon that'll be the one that'll baptize with the Holy Ghost in fire John stood there watched over the congregations as they come and he everybody coming this that and the other but he couldn't see him one day while standing debating with the priest saying you mean to tell me the time will come and the daily sacrifice will be taken away he said there come a man and he looked there it was he said behold there's a lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world he knew it because God had told him upon whom thou shallal see the spirit descending he knew it he was persistent back to this little woman we just got many things we can say about different ones that was perseverant persistent holding on to achieve I've got a little slogan that I say quite a bit it might be good for you to take it a winner never quits and a quitter never wins just think of it a winner never quits and a quitter can't win you must hold on and before you even start be dead sure you're right and then be persistent let nothing move you go on I've had quite a bit of experience of that and you know it I know this one thing when you're dead dead sure that you're in the will of God when you're dead sure you're centered in Calvary nothing's going to move you you're there this little woman she was a Greek and serel and she had heard about the fame of Jesus now how does faith come by hearing hearing of the word she had heard of him and you know she might have had a lot of things to hinder by her being a Greek Faith cometh by hearing we know that and she had a a lot of things to hinder but Faith finds a source no other knows anything about faith finds this source that no one can explain it it's something that you know others can't see it but Faith sees it Faith sees that where the natural eye doesn't see it but the inside eye sees that thing now she had a need of Jesus she first thing you have to do if you're go to find Christ you've got to know that you've got a need of him when you think that you just don't need him then you'll never find him because you won't search him diligently did you notice that scripture where it says seek and you shall find not and it'll be open actually that's just not knock like and it'll be open E that not just say well I went out Lord here I am you want me no that's not it he that seeketh he that knth continuation it has to compare with the rest of the scriptures like the unjust judge and the widow she constantly knocked on his door she was persistent if if he turned her away today the marsh is on his hands again that's the way you want to get God be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking just don't knock a little while and get tired and go away just keep standing there Lord I'm here and I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now I'm going to stay right here getting tired listening I'm having a great time knocking go I know you're coming that's when something happens he has to get you off of his hands so he comes out to answer you now F Faith finds this his word is a a sword the Bible says in Hebrews 4:12 that the word of God sharper than a two- aged sword now there's only one thing can hold this sword that's a hand of Faith the hand of faith is the only thing that can yield this sword of Faith uh sword of the word now you might have a weak arm just enough to pick it up for justification you're so weak maybe that's all you can cut through but this sword of the word will cut free every promise that God made in it if they got a good strong armed of Faith holding it there I believe God for my healing I believe God for my baptism God made the promise and Faith holds his sword it'll cut out of the rock on her every promise of God can be cut free by the word of God for it is a sword she had many hindrances but her faith didn't have any you might have a lot of hindrances every a person starts out to meet Christ well fine you got a lot of hindrances but your faith don't have any faith don't have no hindrance faith has hairs on his chest great big muscles reasons raised up and said you know it's reasonable Faith pulls his muscles back sticks out his big chest and said shut up sit down and reason jumps over a corner and takes his stool right Faith's got muscles and he he means what he says that's what we need tonight that's what the Four Square Church needs that's what the Pentecostal group needs that's what the whole world needs that's what I need that's what you need and we ought to be ashamed to admit it but we need a faith that'll hold God's word and say it's true meet the devil say thus sayith the Lord I was reading the other day where a man said the devil got before him and said he's just a little bitty old devil and he said boo said I'll jump back and said he said boo I jump back every time he'd holler Boo and i' jump back he'd get bigger and i' get ler and said he kept saying boo said I get smaller each time I'm going to jump back and he' get bigger said I know they had to fight him after a while said I looked around thought what I found the word of God said I rolled it in my hand and the devil said boo and I said boo back and said when I said boo back every time I said boo he got smaller and I got bigger that's it you got to fight him sooner or later am you know that people don't believe there's a devil I run into him all the time head into him every day any other believer does yes you got to fight him sooner or later so you might as well start right now he's only one thing he's afraid of is that blood and that word faith holds it it's strong Marches On Now find out this little greek woman as I said she had many hands hindrances but her faith didn't have any faith don't have any hindrances they might have said to her do you know you're a Greek you're you're you're a Greek uh you know you don't belong to his denomination don't go down there that Bunch now that's one of the hindrances see but if you got faith you're going anyhow I don't make any what denominations he's in just so is there she had a need she had a daughter that was dying with epilepsy and she had to get to him because the doctors couldn't do nothing for can't do it yet so she had to get to Jesus she had heard it he'd heal those kind of cases well they said he's not he's not he never come with his Revival to your denominations that didn't hinder that little woman had Faith she is persistent she just passed that group her faith pulled her away from it oh if it could just do that today somebody says it's a meeting T night down at the Four Square Church well it don't belong to your denomination you better stay away from down there just press right on through your faith takes you right on see faith has no hindrance it goes anyhow nothing's going to stop it I said it's bronny big muscles it's got the floor rest up and scared of it yes sir they'll run from it like small pox they just get from away ain't got nothing to do with that when big Faith raises up say I know who I believe I'm persuaded that's it there might been another group that come along say the D Days of Miracles has passed there is no such a thing is that that's a bunch of Holy Rollers down there I'm Jews we're Greeks we're smart we're intelligent group of people we give the world art music and religion and there's no such a thing as that but she was persistent days of Miracles wasn't pass for her because because something done told her down here that it wasn't and that Jesus had what she was looking for and she was determined to get to him regardless of her denomination sponsored it or not she's going anyhow she's going to get down there she was persistent still persistent days of Miracles might be passed for them but it wasn't for her that's the way it is with every believer that people say the days of Miracles a man told me some time ago that I don't care what you'd say Mr Brandon that that I don't believe there is such a thing is Divine Healing I said certainly not to you it wasn't for our unbelievers just for those who believe that's right it wasn't sent to unbelievers it was sent to Believers you can't enjoy it because you know nothing about it he won't tell me there was no such a thing as the Holy Ghost I said you're just about 33 years too late for that I said I know better I've done received it ah nonsense that's it might be to you but not to me it's real to me it's life something anchored you come too late to tell me that they've come too late to tell us about Divine Healing we done been healed we done been filled with the Holy Ghost we done got Rapture and Grace amen it's too late for any of those things it might as well shut up we done got it our faith can say sound I know what I'm talking about well doctors I don't care what doctors so and so say the Bible said it and I've got faith in that book in my hand and my faith holds it out there Jesus is coming I believe that I receive the Holy Ghost because I see him living in my life amen it's according to the word nothing a manifested revelation a perfect Vindication of the Bible being right in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever let them laugh that way they can laugh all they want to would just be as persistent as it was when Noah was Moses was all the rest of the impersonators raising up jambes and jambes threw their rod down turned into a snake there was those man just as honorable as they could be did exactly what God told him to do there come a bunch of impersonation up throw down their rods the only thing they could do just stand still and see the glory of God Amen God will stand by it if he's sensing you're sure of it you're going to achieve the work that God predestinated for you to do you'll stand there and God will take every carnal impersonator away from you right stand there you can be persistent because you know who you have believed and what's right examine your Revelation with the word if it's contrary to the word leave it alone if it's with the word God's bound Duty bound to keep his word now now there might have been a bunch of ladies Stand Down in the corner uh you know and they said here she comes now she's got that kid up there it's got epilepsy and and doctor so and so said that that there's no cure for epilepsy and here she is going down to that offbrand denomination down there for that fanatic Prophet to come up here and heal at child so they said we are to stop Susie I hope there's not a Susie here but we are to stop Susie and tell her because she's been a good woman there's nothing against her life but we are to stop her and the only thing that I know to do is she's passed by everybody else so she won't break this barrier you know what Susie your husband will leave you because he's a trustee or Deacon on the board and he'll leave you short a world if you go down there she was still persistent she went right on see Faith don't know no hindrance it must skip there then she passed another group and said you know what when you return back defeated and find out there's nothing to it everybody in the neighborhood will laugh at you that didn't even make her ears turn red she was persistent she went right on I like that I like that persistence then here stood one of the deacons and said if you go down there you know what they're going to do put you out of your church cuz you've Associated yourself with them holy or people I said you know excuse me oh maybe I said you associating yourself with them you'll get put out of your church she was still persistent Faith knows no defeat she had one thing to achieve and that was get to Jesus she had a need and he was the only one had that need I'm saying this tonight brother and sister I'm 53 years old I've been serving him since I about 20 he's met everything that I hadn't need of and when it comes to the hour of my death I'm sure what I need right then two Wings to reach across the river he'll be there don't you worry I know he'll be there I'll just stick the old sword back in the sheath and take off the helmet lay it down up on the river when I Bank when I hear the Dashers and I'll scream send out the life I'm coming home this morning it'll be there yes sir the Morning Star will come down and light up the way AC cross the river we'll go yes sir amen she was persistent she had an achievement she knew that she had to be persevering in order get to Jesus so she had to pass by everything finally she arrived now finally got here everything's fine now and then here come another hindrance the very man that should profess to have confidence in the man she tried to get to Jesus he said I'm not sent to your race oh my would that not made us Pentecost will blow up I'm not sent to your race that was a shock but you know what faith knows no shock and then again he turns around after all these things she' pass through and her Faith holding that she knew that Jesus could give her her desire and she went through every one of these barriers and when she got to him then turned down flatly I'm not even sent to your race I can imagine standing her eyes gleaming she she was in front of him then that's all she had to be and said besides that your race ain't nothing but a bunch of dogs oh my what if it said that to you You' said I'll take my papers from this four square and go over to somewhere else I'll never go back there again I'll take it from so and so oh yes yes sir but still she held on oh see Faith knows no defeat ain't nothing go to stop it though Jesus said to her the very one she come to said I'm not sent to your race and they're nothing but a bunch of dogs but what she had had a hold of real faith faith knows no defeat I don't care where it comes from knows no defeat because she had Faith still she held on oh I love that she was not a hot bed plant a hybrid like some of them today these high-bred religions we got today you know ain't no good everything now is highbrid hybrid even they got hybrid churches hybrid Christians talk in but shaking their hands oh they can dress better and maybe use better English and so forth like that ain't got no life in it you take a big fine ear corn High bread maybe it's twice as pretty as the other one plant it it'll die ain't got no life in it that's right we don't want nothing hybrid we want the genuine thing you haven't got it stay there till it comes why except the substitute when the Pentecostal skies are full of the Reel nothing hybrid it won't stand you have to always spray a hbrd plant keep the bugs off of it that's why some of these hbrd Christians you have to Baby them and pet them promising they'll be Deacon or something else keep some of the worldly bugs from them of unbelief they get out of the church kick them out anyhow never was in you can't join a church you might join a lodge you can join the Methodist Lodge Baptist Lodge or Pentecostal Lodge but if you ever come to Christ you'll be bned into the church right the mystical Body of Christ others are lodes right it's all right nothing against them but you're borned into the Church of the Living God by the spirit of God you can't journ it at all and when you're borned in there you got a birth you're not a hbd no more a hand jarner a hitchhiker know hitchhiker is always thumbing that's why well I know but doctor so and so no no that's it that's it exactly she was assistant she wasn't a hybrid you didn't have to spray her over with perfume make her right she stood there part of our crop today too many of them's hybrids just compan like David Dees I believe once said God has no grandchildren trouble with our Pentecostal movement we're getting Pentecostal grandchildren they come in because our fathers and mothers were Pentecostal we take them in on the Cradle roll and they come up without the experience and there they say they're Pentecostal too no sir God don't have grandchildren he ain't Grandpa he's father right if you ever get to heaven you'll pay the price like your mother did your daddy [Applause] did amen that might sound crude but it's truth it's crude way of making a point but you understand that kind of English I'm sure it isn't very good English it gets a point what I'm trying to say just listen to it yes she wasn't a hybrid she didn't have to be sprayed over and baby well now sister dear I I I tell you oh no no sir and no matter what knocked her down she said it's truth we're nothing but a bunch of dogs it's true that we're not worthy of it oh my she admitted that he was right I'm going to say a great big mouthful get ready every time genuine faith will admit the words right and anytime that something says that the days of Miracles has passed or something against the Bible it's not genuine Faith the faith will always admit truth stay with the word no matter what anything else says what anybody else says it's a word's right let every man's word be a lie and mine true every who will add to or take away from the same will be Tak this part out of the book of life God's going to judge the World by a church which one Catholic 660 some OD different denominations how's he going to do that God's going to judge the World by Jesus Christ and Christ in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us God and the word is the same this is God on print you've got the you've got the Holy Spirit plant that seed in there it brings it to life breaks that life forth and manifested and vindicates Jesus said in St John 12 he that believeth on me uh St John 1412 rather The Works that I do shall he do also so it always admits to the truth oh my but you know she said that's true we ain't nothing but a bunch of dogs and we're not you really wasn't sent to us but Lord I'm not looking for all the bread the children had I'm only searching for crumbs oh my how' you notice people they want to get this get healed and get the Holy Spirit the way they think they ought to have it now I'll come down brother if you'll bring me up and take me into the room where nobody will see me and um you lay your hands up on me and bless me and put the Holy Ghost In Me I'll accept it oh no non wanted to accept his healing like that one time but Elijah told him get out there in the old muddy jarden and dipped seven times how can just see him get off his Chariot oh great man hold his nose here he comes out the water tip toing like a cat molasses know coming out like this getting out like that get out the water he said oh I hate to do this on top down some people comes to the altar like it is sickening a fair farm yeah I don't want to do that he duck one I said I still got leprosy the prophet said seven times right until he obeyed the word completely until you obey it completely Had A Good Man Standing on the bank said the prophet said seven times father just keep on dipping that's it you don't get it the first night just dip again the next night just keep on till you get get him now remember she was like Rahab the Harlot this little woman was she had never seen a miracle she'd only heard about a miracle what would she day in the doing the day of judgment to us she had never seen a miracle she's a gentile she had never seen but she had heard and we both seen and heard and still out oh my she was like Rahab the Harlot when the spies come over she didn't have to say uh I tell you you bring Joshua over and let him hold a service to me and I see way rooms his hair and the way he talks and the adequat he uses at the P pit I'll see whether I can accept him or not she said I have heard that the god of heaven was with you the only thing I asked is to be spared there you are that little woman was really persistent she helped right on just spare me I'll do anything that you want me to do oh there you are that's it this little woman no matter what the difficult was she was persistent oh she had the right approach to the gift of God she had the right approach humility she fell down at his feet and she had humility she didn't stand said now you wait just a minute you know we people agree you said we were dogs just a minute here sir do you realize that we we're the masters of Art and we're the masters of so and so and such and such she never thought of that at all she just admitted that he was right and fell down at his feet and said help me Lord I'll just eat the crumbs if my daughter can't have a whole slice of bread will you just let her have the crumbs if she's a dog oh my there you are would we be satisfied with just the crumbs if the Holy Spirit should reveal to somebody tonight you're healed would you be ready this to take the crumbs or would do you want God to walk over and raise you up and give you some kind of a feeling if he'd just say in your heart my sickness is over you haven't got it no more I believe that I'm going to be healed from theight on would you take the crumbs or would you want uh everybody come up and lay hands on you and pour all and go through the regular ritual like that or are you just looking for crumbs God will honor that you know many of disciples is SE him after his resurrection Thomas said no uhuh I won't believe it I I got to put my hands in the prince of his F Nails in his hands and in his side then I'll believe it he said come here Thomas said touch me and he did he said my Lord and my God he said Thomas because you have seen and felt and everything you believe yes Lord said how much greater is their reward who has never seen and yet will believe are we ready are we Gentiles like that Gentile woman was she in example to all of us just give me the crumbs Lord just let me hear some man I've never read the word but tell me that you heal the sick uh that Crum will be enough for me I believe it let me hear somebody say and read it from the word that the Holy Ghost Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise isn't to you and to your children and to them it's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Lord I feel it that's right that's a crumb come on that's all you have to do come are we ready to take the crumbs are we ready to Humble ourselves she was she was ready to Humble herself Faith always admits the word right faith is always humble Faith humbles itself out now she was just looking for the crumbs watch what Jesus said for this saying for this saying I'm willing to take the crumbs Lord for this saying thy child is whole you have your request because you believe it Faith admits that the word of God Is Right Faith admits all these things Martha Mary down through the Bible we could call many the shunamite woman many things and cases that we could call we haven't got time to of this I got about five pages here written of people now who approach for our crumbs but let's bypass that just a minute and I feel the Holy Spirit closed I don't think it's necessary let me just give you one little experience the business man wrote the little thing up in their the little article not long ago in their magazine and remember when you make a printed matter you better be able to back it up we have it documented statement from the doctor I noticed in the church tonight quite a few Spanish people I was in Mexico City and we were having a glorious meeting I've been there about three nights and there was a man that I call Manana he's supposed to get me at 6:00 would get me about 9: and I always caus you to slow I said he was tomorrow and when we got out to this big ring where I was preaching they had take me up on a ladder up here and let me down on ropes on the platform the night before there had been a a Mexican man that had come to the meeting and the old fell raining as it was and he come to the platform blind and he came down I looked I had good good shoes on a good suit and the poor old man is barefooted his trousers all ragged and I'll tell you who my interpreter was you people know him brother esposas up here in Sacramento California Pentecostal brother he was interpreting we had about in the two nights I think around about 30 40,000 converts from Catholicism to Christianity the Holy Spirit and this old blind man come across the platform and if you don't feel for the people you're praying for there's no need of praying for them you got to field yourself in their plates and I thought if my old daddy would have lived he' have been about the age of that old man here he is he's got no shoes and he had no shirt on an old coat ragging Dusty an old hat in his hand solded up with cards probably the old fell never had a decent meal in his life and then how cruel fate had been to him here he staggered in blindness and his eyes was white I look at the old fell and I I just put my arms around him and brother espinos wouldn't interpret the prayer and I I said heavenly father if I could give him my shoes I'd just slip out of them so nobody see them give him a coat send him on the road but he's much larger than I but God have mercy on him give him back his sight glor I looked around he can see as good as I could the next night there was a rack or Rick as far as this building is long about this high with nothing but just old Shaws and old ragged clothes the economics of Mexico is poorly balanced maybe Pedro gets he's a brick mason he might get 16 pesos a day but it'll take four days work to buy him a pair of shoes but he'll have to save enough out of that to pay a several pesos for a grease candle to burn on a million dollar gold alar for his sins that's what borrows me seeing those precious people they come there at 9:00 at morning no seats to sit down they leaned against one another like sheep and a pastor raining and women stand their hair streaking down soaking wet wait all day in a hot sun or rain just to hear the word of God oh what will they do when Phoenix rises in the day of the Judgment with them and find churches everywhere and you can't even heard a in there she stood or he stood rather with his sight that night when I got in it was raining hard brother Jack Moore many of you know him brother espinos several of the brethen was on the platform and Billy my son he usually gives our prayer cards and he couldn't speak Spanish to those people so he had to let Manana do it but he just went around to see Manana and didn't sell a prayer card so that's where we had to watch him selling a prayer card so he just watched him and they walk up and watched and see that he just hand the prayer card to so and so like that so he said come to me I got preaching great big pile of of clothes laying up there how they ever know which belonged to who I don't know so they were I was just got to speaking and Billy tapped me on the shoulder he said Daddy you're going to have to do something that little woman out there said I've got almost 300 ushers and they can't even hold her a little bitty Spanish girl about so high beautiful little thing she had a dead baby in her hands under her blanket and he said Manana give out every prayer card and said she has no prayer card and there's the Lion's been standing F there for the last two hours waiting for you to come and said she wants to bring that dead baby up here and we can't hold her all she'd come right over top of that musers run on her feet or anything she was persistent she wanted to get there she had seen that blind man heal the night before she is persistent and I said Brother Moore she don't know who I am she don't know which is which you just go down there and pray for the baby that'll settle it she he said all right brother Bram so Billy got him with the arm like it be me so when on down across the platform I turn around I said I am very happy to be here tonight and the meetings are not strange to you people here in Phoenix right before me I seen a little Mexican baby no teeth laughing in a vision sitting out here I said wait a minute wait a minute brother esposas get to the what's what's matter I said get to the microphone I said tell her to come here he said Daddy bil he said you can't bring her roll on prayer cards I said get her here I just saw a vision so he called her and they get back here she come with a quilt in her hand like this and a little baby laying in there had been dead since early that morning died with pneumonia a little bitty fellow about that long and here she come the tears running down her cheeks her little black eyes her hair hanging down very Charming little lady she run to the platform and fell on her knees and begin to cry at padra I said stand up just a minute I thought Lord what if it ain't that what if that wasn't that I don't know I just seen a little Mexican baby little gold teeth his little gums and it was laughing at me sitting right out there and she was crying and I put my hand up on the wet blanket and it rained in then and I said Heavenly Father this little woman no doubt in my mind but what you're answering her I said I saw the vision that you know to be truth of a little baby I'm only accepting it by faith that it's this baby I don't know the woman nor the baby but something you're work on both ends of the line and I laid my hands up on it and when it did it kicked and screamed just as loud as it could scream a mother jerked the blanket off and there it was alive in her arms I said brother espinos don't Mark that down but send some good loyal person and she was telling it in Mexican that the doctor pronounced her baby dead with pneumonia that morning about 8 or 9:00 and here it was after 10: that night and I said sand and get a written documented statement from the doctor that pronounced the dead and the Mexican doctor wrote a statement and signed it I pronounce the baby dead no respiration or nothing in my office this morning at 9:00 and here it is 10:00 that night and the next morning the baby was in the doctor's office to be examined normally again why because the little woman was persistent Faith knows no defeat if there's 5,000 standing there in Place nothing takes a place her church to turn her out her neighbors could laugh but a God that could open the blind eyes of a man the night before could raise her baby because he's the same God yester did hand forever and if this group of people here tonight crumb Searchers if you are the very God that brought you here it could lead you to a place like this the god that saved you the god that could fill you with the Holy Ghost that same God can wipe away every bit of the sickness and sorrow whatever it is in your hearts tonight you believe that persistent persevering reach and grab that little crumb of Faith now Lord thank you for it here I come a neighbor will say to Mar you're not healed say oh but I am I am I found a crumb last night down at the War Square Church something anchored Within Me nothing's going to stop me anymore I have it let us bow our heads just a minute are you needing a crumb tonight could you take the crumb and be persistent with it the little crumb of faith that come to a a little Gentile Greek woman never seen a miracle in her life a heathen idolator but she heard that it been worked on someone else she never seen it but she believed it and all the disappointment she had yet upon the bases of something in her heart telling her that her child could be healed you know when she got home she found her daughter laying up on a bed the a spell had gone from her not only for herself but for her a daughter who wasn't present do you need a crumb tonight if you do would you just raise up your hand and say Lord just a crumb is all I asked oh heavenly father look at those crumbs seeking Gentiles times hasn't changed yet Lord they've heard they've heard that you heal the sick they've heard that you fill with the Holy Spirit you give rest to the weary oh God grant that these that tonight is crying like that precious little lady of many days ago Lord truly we're not worthy to receive the blessings like Thy People Israel but we only seek a crumb that falls from the master's table and tonight we have showed the great food that you fed your church and tonight we have not only crumbs but we're invited to the table we don't really have to take the crumbs but we're glad to get them but we're invited to the table tonight Jesus has this table spread for all the saints of God are fed he invites his chosen people to come and die Grant tonight father that each one who has a need that need will be met and while we have our heads bowed musicians oh there's one okay amen praise the Lord I believe that the the group that goes into Rapture will be a persevering group I I really do and even if we know we all I know we we all have needs and burdens and it is going to take persistence on our part to hold on in faith and to believe God and just like Jacob I'll not let you go except th bless me amen and that's what we we want that
