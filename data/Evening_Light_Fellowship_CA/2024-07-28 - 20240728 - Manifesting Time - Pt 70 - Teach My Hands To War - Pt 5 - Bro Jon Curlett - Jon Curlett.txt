Lord our joy is in you our faith is in you Lord we're trusting you this morning once again Heavenly Father Lord asking you to be real Lord that you would move in our lives again this morning Heavenly Father you see each life here each soul lord those online many sick today Lord we pray a special Grace to them Lord that healing virtue would flow through your word Lord that it would raise us up Lord that we'd have a testimony of your goodness and Grace Lord bless your people now now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians 3 certainly not feeling very well we've got a house of pestilence back at my place there Blanca has been very sick and I said last night I said Lord just preserve my voice I'll preach if I can preach so I'm here this morning I have a voice I don't have much else but I have a voice so I say praise the Lord for that I'm thankful that he kept that amen Blanca had virtually lost her voice just a day or two ago and if I on the same trajectory I shouldn't have a voice now but I do and so I'm here and I want to be faithful to my calling amen certainly appreciate that song service amen our hope is in the Lord very much lines up with the the word we have this morning certainly want to uh thank the trustees the deacons the the uh musicians the Sunday School people the youth leaders the audiovisual people the cleaners I know we're going to have a business meeting at the end of the service but I just wanted to say over the pulpit and publicly how much I appreciate each one that does these things and it takes time and it takes effort and I know a lot of us are busy and yet we do it as a sacrifice as a part of our role in the body and so I just appreciate each one of you the faithful tithe payers the attendees each and every one amen God bless you richly Ephesians 3 verse 14 says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing our adoption series on manifesting time and I want to we're continuing again our thought on teach My Hands to War and I want to take a a subtitle this morning of strength and due season and we just read what Paul said and he said we'd be strengthened with might by the holy spirit in the Inner Man and we've spoken already over many of these Services how the battle is in the inside amen the the battle we Face the greatest battle going on now is for the minds of men men Lord the Lord takes the heart he takes the soul and Satan takes the mind and the mind is that Gateway between your soul and the rest of your body to your spirit to your emotions to your very flesh and these different things so that battle is to open that up from the soul side so that faith can come out so that the word can come out and so when it does that then we can win the battle amen but there's a reason we have to guard our thoughts so closely and it takes real commitment to do that you know we have to be real real real intent on what we're thinking about because when we just sit down guess what thoughts start to come to us pretty easily and we have to stop and say where are these thoughts coming from and if they're not coming from a place that is based on the word then we need to stop it and say okay I need to change my thoughts and I need to be intentional about these things because everything we see and hear today is intent on dragging away our Focus From the things of God Amen it's out there to to seduce us it's there to entice us it's to bury us under a load of commitments it's to stress us out amen and the the Overcomer has to be able to push those things away and focus on what the word of God says about about him amen it's to stay centered on the word of God for our day and its purpose for our day if you look in Revelation 3 what is the condition of the of the unbeliever of the almost Overcomer it's a lukewarm condition half in half out half committed half not committed am me half Christian half not Christian lukewarm being pulled in two directions at one time and and no way to make a a a clear Road or a clear path in what they're going in their life but I want you to take this thought this morning anden I don't ever want to preach a sermon that beats us down amen I want to challenge us every day I want to challenge us to see where we're at and and to see what God would have for our lives as we read that quote a couple Services ago to come in and see those little things that we do and those areas of our life where we need to be bolstered but I want to give us some a shot of Faith this morning and Isaiah said this he says Thou will keep him in perfect peace now if you look in the original Hebrew That Word Perfect is not even there the word that is there is Shalom thou will keep him in Shalom that word is completeness soundness the literal translation is all as well so you will keep this person in this in the in a state of mind that says all is well what whose mind is stayed on thee it's not one way one day one day the next and one day here and one moment here and there but if we can keep our mind stayed on him then Shalom comes down amen all is well there is a place of perfect peace and perfect rest for the bride amen she will keep him in Shalom perfect peace whose mind is stayed on the why because he trusteth in thee trusty in the Lord forever for in the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength this world is completely intent on taking away our peace and our rest that's why we have to have a promise for it is because the world is trying to take it away you look at the politics today you look at the financial systems you look at the cost of living the filth the sensuality the perversion the intent the focus of this world I was telling my wife I watched just a a short portion of the Olympic opening ceremony in France and I should have known better I should have known better because typically they do these great Majestic things with performers and and and massive fireworks and Feats of Strength and just something to really wow you but it's remember what Paris is it's it's Satan's seed of power in Europe remember what the prophet of God said he said he came from Paris and he says he came and he made Hollywood his headquarters in America but it was full of Filth they they they they were showing uh you know they they Blended all of the perversion that is here today not here but in this world and they put it into an opening ceremony to the point where they recreated the last supper with drag queens trans people and children and you say what does that have to do with anything see Satan is trying to get us distracted he's trying to get us up in arms that's half the battle that Christians are facing today is they're getting up in arms about trying to fix what's here rather than getting up in arms and saying I want to get out of here cuz what did that make me realize church I am not here I'm not from here I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger this world is not my home I'm just a passing through as the song says there's nothing about this world that draws me you know there I I think maybe when we're younger before we give our hearts to the Lord this can seem like a bit of an Eden it can seem like a place where we can make it work but the further you go in life the further you go in the word the more you mature you realize I cannot live here I cannot work here I cannot be here and identify with anything that's here hallelujah amen we're here to get out we are not here to fight the system we're not here to correct the man we are here to go in a resurrection and Rapture and every thought we have every day ought to be focused on what does he have for me in his word what is my word for my season what is it that he's trying to do in my life today amen there's a bride that's getting ready to leave amen there's a a bride that has recognized this is not her home and she's getting herself ready the bride had made herself ready she's preparing to go in a resurrection in the Rapture so the question is not will there be struggles there are will there be battles there are will we face opposition we will every single day but the question is how will we face those things how will we go through them that's what we want to answer as we go through this today I want to share a quote with you just to set us up because with all the distractions we Face there's a battle to be fought and there's a battle to be won to keep the mind in the right place prophet of God says this he says if you want angels to appear to you keep your mind on on God and off the things of the world th this is very simple Church there's nothing hard about what I'm preaching this morning keep your mind on God and off the things of the world go about your business go to your church go to your washing of dishes wherever you are keep your mind on him all day and all night long then God will do something you're drawing close to him you got the world shut out it's just you and he together I've said it so many times but it Bears repeating the more you think on him the more he draws near remember what happened on the road to emus they said and as they spoke dwelt on these things as they spoke on these things Jesus himself Drew near well when you think on him when you dwell on him when you you show him appreciation when you show him love what happens is he comes into the room he comes into the situation but here's the thing if I've been focused on the things of the world it's that much harder to draw close to him and think on the things of God because remember what that story is that of that Indian that came to brother brand and he said I've got two dogs inside of me inside of me fighting one of them's a white dog and one of them's a black dog one of them's good and one of them's bad and he says which one wins he says whichever one I feed the most and we can sit here and we say where is God where is God and God is saying when's the last time you try to talk to me when's the last time you spend time with me what is your focus day by day because if it's all about this world guess what then your heart is not close to God and you're going to fight more and more to try and get him back whereas if we can keep our mind stayed on him he draws closer so much more easily anden our mind goes naturally to those things sometimes we're so focused on the situation and the problems that we want him to deal with that we don't actually start talking to him about anything else and all we are is is going to him for our needs rather than encouraging our relationship with him you know for me I found and this is just me that when I leave those things behind when I take my needs and I just say I'm going to put them away and Lord I'm just going to thank you for what you've done in my life I'm thanking you for what you're doing I'm thanking you for the answers you've given I'm thanking you for the leadership I'm thanking you for the days of sun that we've had here for the last couple of weeks whatever it is a heart of appreciation what it does is it allows us to lay those things aside and now God come in and do something about it rather than us sitting there and trying to force the answer and trying to force the situation sometimes we're trying to get so we're trying so hard to get somewhere with God in the conversation that he's locked out of the conversation completely I'm speaking from experience where we want to do all the talking and then we just want him to move God wants to talk God wants to have a relationship he wants a back and forth you know they they say that women that are trying to get pregnant that are really struggling with it what happens is they they they try and get pregnant and they go through these treatments and hormones and fertility things and all these different things and then in the end a lot of them can't even get pregnant and so what they do is they say well that's it and I'm going to either not have a child or I'm going to go look at adoption and they stop trying and then they get pregnant because what happens they're trying so hard to make it happen that it stresses the body out and they can't actually get pregnant their own works are locking down the reaction that their body's supposed to have and as soon as that stress goes away as soon as they have no expectation of themselves they get pregnant why it's that stress it's that trying these different things we can get to that place with God where we're trying so hard to make him do it that we don't give him any room any latitude to do it the way he wants to do it we're in a we're in a right now Society aren't we I want to pray and I want it to happen right now I want to have a need and then I want him to meet it right then and that's not the God that he promised us he's Jehovah Gyra he sees the need and he meets the need but he does it always in his own time with his perfect will he continues he says just keep him on your mind keep thinking about him how lovely he is how sweet he is of his promises see don't focus on your need start thinking about the attributes of God that you need think about what it is that makes him God because that's what you're coming to him for in the first place if you're sick get this on your mind he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him and with his stripes I was healed he says keep your mind centered like that something will happen to you all of a sudden there'll be something drawn nigh to you catch this an anointing will come on you and out of that chair you'll go he says draw nigh unto the Lord and He will draw nigh unto you what what happens is the anointing of God comes down to make his word live that's why you dwell on the word because in the word there is power and there's a holy ghost that comes behind it to make it live amen and it's in each and every one of us that it does this that's why you need to have it so it'll work in you to produce the word you listening to the sick seal yesterday and I came across this beautiful quote and you know we know we're in a mind battle and and the only way to overcome in every age is to catch the anointing for your age it's the only way to overcome you cannot do it by works you can't do it by discipline you've got to come under the anointing for your age because that's what the Overcomer does is it takes the word under that anointing and it produces it amen we're talking about teach My Hands to War and we see these great mind battles but today we're facing battles that they've never faced before before we have similarities sure but today we're facing battles that have never been failed faced before and I know that because we've got a different anointing than anyone's had before it's a different struggle it's a different trial remember what it was there was four beasts there was four powers that were spread across seven Church ages one under each of the first four seals to counteract what Satan was doing and that anointing comes on the Overcomer on the True Believer for that day and you cannot fail with that anointing that anointing is there to make sure we don't fail praise the Lord this morning but brother I would say this he says today we stand here by your grace I am here by his grace church but he says and it's not because it's a special people we are special in that he chose us we are not special in of ourselves he says but it's because just like the day of the lion or the ox or the man it's the eagle time it's the anointing of the hour it's the time that we're living in it's the working of the holy spirit for this particular time to prove that Jesus is not dead that's what we're under right now they had a line anointing in Paul's day then they moved into the ox anointing under the the Dark Ages and then they came under the man anointing under Martin Luther to bring them out through the wisdom of man but now it's the eagle time and it's where we fly above all the situations where we see the truth for what it is where the book is completely open and it takes us completely from here into glory and Eternity amen what's our battle our battle is to catch the anointed for this age to come under the word for our age and let it carry us through the trials take us through the battles that we're facing and so our battle is to catch it and then yield to it amen surrender ourselves to it to let it do the work amen that that's why a modern Pentecostal anointing won't work because they're all about the gifts they're all about speaking in tongues they're all about signs and wonders that is not the overcoming for this age the overcoming for this age is get out of your lukewarm condition and you can be all on fire in the service but then you can't go out and live it why you're in a lukewarm condition even under the gifts and the signs and the Wonders the anointing for this age takes us out of it it does not leave us where we are amen signs and wonders didn't work for Israel on the way to Canaan signs and wonders didn't work for Judas and it won't work today it's a part and parcel of the Christian experience but it is not the end point the end point is a resurrection and Rapture today that's where we're at amen our our purpose is to fulfill the word for our day that's why we're here to fulfill the word for our day and that's what overcoming is overcoming is to fulfill the word for your day and what is the word for our day don't be lukewarm be quick to repent be quick to align yourself with what God's revealing in his word get back to the full word and he'll do the rest under the anointing of the Holy Ghost for this age let's come back to our opening scripture Paul says this that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts how by faith faith means believing is required even when there's evidence that says it's not true Faith believes regardless of evidence so what's happening here is by faith and he says that ye been rooted and grounded in love amen the basis for our faith is that he first loved us amen that he gave his life for us that he made a way through Calvary that he has a Redemptive work ongoing he says that he may dwell in Your Heart by faith and that ye been rooted and grounded in love brother says this he says now don't fear have faith wait just a moment see so your spirit can be in the right position to catch the anointing of God faith he say faith triumphs it knows no defeat it'll walk right over everything remember faith is a revelation of God's will for you personally amen faith is when God shows you something that it's yours it's for you you're part of it and because you know that you know that you know that you know that it's for you there's something Rises up in you and it says okay I'll take it and you walk forward in that Faith amen and you say it's mine and from that moment nothing nothing can can move you from that when it's a true personal revelation from God now we spent a lot of time on that in this series that adoption is based on finding the will of God for your life that means a lot of waiting it means a lot of prayer it's a daily thing that we do it takes work and effort it takes commitment it takes it it takes us setting aside things that we think are important to focus on the thing that's most important which is what does he want me to do with my day amen but when we found it and you know you found it then nothing can shake that Revelation from your life he continues he says that we may be able to comprehend with all saints that word comprehend means to know by experience not head knowledge anden you don't know Christ by head knowledge you know Christ by experience you know a living God by a living God experience that we may be able to comprehend that we may know by experience with All Saints what is the breadth the length and depth and height and to know know the love of Christ which passeth that word is surpasses which exceeds knowledge see head knowledge the love that we experience is not just up here but it's a day-by-day thing that we experience in Christ that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God that's what an anointed one is is one that is filled with the fullness of God he says now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think exceeding abundantly there's not a better phrase for the believer exceeding that means greater than everything and abundantly means greater than greater than anything it's a superlative it's far above whatever we could imagine he says that he could do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think how according to the power that worketh in us what's the power that works in us it's the anointed word by the Holy Ghost that's what's inside of each and every one of us amen it's added to us we never had it we don't have this power in ourselves that's why he had to come back on the day of Pentecost and give it to us to make the word live amen he gave a power inside of us now he says why why did he have to give us power because we needed more than we had that's for sure amen we needed more than we had it's added to us we didn't have it from the start but I want to circle around and really spend this service on this idea of catching the anointing for your age and for your life because we are all under the same anointing if we're true Born Again Sons and Daughters of God we by one Spirit by one Spirit we're all baptized into the body of Christ Paul said and so we're under the Same Spirit we under the same anointing and that anointing is here to make the word of God for this day live it's to make it a reality for our day it's not here to build Ministries it's not here to build men it's not here to build churches or programs none of these things but it's here to make the word live that's all it's here to do amen now Paul says unto him that's able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh Us in other words he's saying there's more available that's a wonderful thing you know if I if you went to the bank and you drew out $110,000 and they said there's more available what would you do I'll take some more then what if somebody told you there is no limit how much would we take out Church mortgages would be paid off new vehicles all around we'd stop working praise the Lord Brother Grant praise the Lord he says there's more available than what you've asked there's more available than what you've thought there's more available than what you've imagined Hallelujah this morning there's more available than we've ever experienced yet church then you can ask or think but that doesn't mean don't ask and that doesn't mean don't think just don't limit God by your asking or limit him by your thinking amen you can ask badly you can ask WR ly but you can never ask too much you cannot outspend God you can't wear him out amen don't ever let the size of your need or your request stop you from asking he says there's way more here than you ever have need of church every need supplied Jesus said hitherto you have asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full you know as I was thinking on this I think if we're honest maybe this is me being honest sometimes we get in the mindset of if he'll just do what he said that's more than we could ask or think because what we're asking for is Supernatural when we we we're looking at situations when we're looking at people when we're looking at problems we think if he'd only do what he promised I would be mind blown but that's a guarantee he already promise that there's a Beyond his promise that is available to us amen well what happens we get beaten down we get depressed we and what do we do we forget everything that God has done we forget everything he's doing we forget the good reports we forget the healings the provision all of those things and so the great battle comes up and we say here we go again got to face another one on my own just one more thing to deal with and we completely forget that he's done abundantly and exceedingly above what we've asked or thought before and he can do it again and he will do it again if we ask Satan loves to magnify the situation he loves to magnify our flaws and our faults and he raises doubts and he makes us think it's not for us why because it hasn't happened yet that's the that's the greatest weapon Satan has is time because you haven't received what you've asked for yet he says it's not for you that's a lie from the pits of hell and so what happens is we get to the point where we say I won't ask or I'm not worthy to ask and Satan's defeated us that's not how we're supposed to be we're not supped supped be crestfallen depressed oh woe is me I'm a little nothing no you're an ordained elected child of God Amen and you have access to the abundantly to the exceeding abundantly that he talked about amen church if we're feeling that way we need a f fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm just being honest this morning if we're in that place we need a fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost we need to get to the Altar and cry out to God we need to put aside our commitments we need to put aside our chores go into our room and get down on our face before God and say God I need more than what I've got amen I need an exceedingly abundantly above what I've had listen if they did it right after the day of Pentecost we can do it today say Lord there's more of you available I'm definitely standing in a need this morning amen that there's more of you amen I don't care how long it's been I don't care if God hasn't answered be certain of God his word Can't Fail his promises can't fail but the believer believes and stays there until he does it now I want to take this to the Bible this morning as we ought to Amen to because so often what happens is the reality of the anointing comes in a way that we're not expecting it comes by the word but so often it doesn't come the way that we're expecting and so often what happens then is we build a box around God's answer and it hinders Us in receiving or recognizing what God's trying to do amen and as we talked about Satan's weapon so often is time and he he he leverages time to make us think that God's not going to answer but we know God's got his timing and his timing is perfect he's an ontime God he does it perfectly every single time time amen but let's walk through this today to see what it looks like to receive the anointing for your day to receive the strength of the anointed word now this is speaking of Jesus and he's back in Nazareth his hometown it says and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the Lord is upon me because Heath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at Liberty them that are bruised he says to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears now those words were written by Isaiah hundreds and hundreds of years of ago and Jesus comes to his own Hometown and he says this scripture is fulfilled here today right now it's no longer prophecy it's reality the word when it came out of Isaiah's mouth was not for Isaiah it was for the Messiah to come and do and Jesus now comes in and what is he he's the anointed word made flesh it takes the anointed word off the page and now it comes in flesh and he says the anointed word is here today what was spoken of is now a reality in my flesh today the anointed word is being fulfilled in your midst what the people in that synagogue do tried to kill him they rejected the word but here's the thing Church there were people that were crying out for that anointed one no matter what there were brokenhearted people there were people that were in captivity there were people that were blind there were people that were bruised that were hurt that were offended that were cast out and they were crying out for this Messiah however he might come they did not put a box around the word they said whatever the word for my day is I want to receive it I don't want to miss it and so these religious people are pushing it all away but these other ones in their condition in their bruised Fallen sinful hurt sick condition were crying out for this anointed word to come their way so that this word will become a reality in their life in their fallen condition in their needy condition they're crying out for him and we see this picture of a man by the pool of salom and the prophet of God puts it this way he says a little old fellow laying down there laying by the pool of Bethesda been laying there for 30 28 years with an infirmity in his body praying with all of his heart how long oh Lord how long how long's it going to take what's the delay he says and Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit right down to where he was and healed him says when the rest of them were thinking about their diseases and things and he went away from them and never said a word what is it the anointed word came to somebody who would receive it the way it came the others he says were focused on their diseases they were focused on the pool but this one caught a hold of something else and the spirit of God leads Jesus there now catch this man catch this scene because he's in a scene of Divine Healing his entire life and he's got no healing he's seen Miracle after Miracle person after person gets in that pool and gets healed and he's sitting there and he has none of it he kept missing it he didn't have the strength he didn't have the speed to be first he couldn't see that Ripple in the water and jump in before anybody else did and everyone that would help him had forsaken him it's just him there but Church he's staying where healing is that's the faith that he had he kept praying and even though he's impotent the scripture says though he has no strength of his own he had no way of getting to where he needed to be what happened when you can't go to him he comes to you Hallelujah and the anointed word comes to one man one faithful person that was looking for it not just the anointing the anointed one the Christ the anointed word for his day see here's the thing Church the pool had Miracles when the angel came down Miracles would happen but it was only one at a time and it was random and it was based on who could get there first and he had no opportunity but he stayed there per Adventure one day he might be able to get in there and do it what's he doing his faith never left him out of that place of healing he stayed where healing was even though he never got it never leave the word never leave the place of your healing never leave the place of your promise if you stay there then the anointing will come to that word and it'll meet you right there amen that man never lost hope he never lost faith decade after decade after decade of pain no healing perhaps he wondered if he'd never if he'd ever get healed but then one day what happened his faith drew the anointed word to him amen and then the anointed one for his age simply said rise take up your bed and walk and all he was left with was to make the attempt based on what he said and strength came to his legs and he stood up picked up his bed and walked away Hallelujah when you can't do it it'll come to you and it'll give you the strength that you have need of he says you want to S God to send the power upon you go to praying and believing we do a lot of praying how much believing do we do he says the Holy Ghost will bring it to you healing salvation whatever you have need of God will bring it to you you I'm reminded of that woman that that came to the well in Samaria and it was the middle of the day when things get hot it was the sixth hour that's that's noon and all the women would come early in the morning because that's when it was cool but she wasn't allowed to walk with them she was an adulterous she was a fornicator she was an outcast she messed up her life badly five different marriages five different divorces and now she sh shacked up common law with a man and so she can't walk with the good women she can't walk with The Godly women she can't walk with the ones that are received by everyone else she's completely broken her life is a mess she has bad decision after bad decision stacked up on another and her life is so Twisted now like spaghetti that nobody can untie it no man no woman no Ministry can untie it she's completely overtaken not only that she's a Samaritan she's half Jew she's half Gentile she's an outcast from those that the word is coming to we think and now after Decades of bad living perhaps she's now an outcast from her own people she's someone to be shunned but she comes here that day now notice here's the thing church this woman is under a burden but in that burden there's a call because what's happened here and is there's a cry in her for that Messiah to come and somehow in her past she learned that there's a messiah coming and yet in her great teaching in her proper raising she has come out of it and she's completely messed up her life but yet there's a cry inside that says if the Messiah could come my way he'd get it all figured out all my mistakes all my failures all my flaws he'd fix it all for me in her condition there's a cry that's there Amen in her absolute inability to get out of her own way she says there's somebody that can make a way for me out of this day after day week after week year after year she trudges on that walk of shame where everybody sees her and they say There She Goes Again children don't ever talk to her husband what are you looking at day after day hot sweaty frustrated annoyed the Walk of Shame to get her water what was it it was Jacob's Well if you remember it was deep it never went dry but here's the thing Jacob's experience wasn't enough for her she had to have the experience Jacob had which is to meet a living God she needed to meet the god of her day amen can you imagine her mindset as she's walking up to this well hot sweaty her hair is clinging to her you sisters know that you know when you get sweaty and it's just tendel of hair I'll lie to you the back of your neck is just so hot you got these heavy jars on your in your hands and you're walking up and you're just frustrated you're tired you're sick of doing this walk and we'll see as we get into the scriptures she hates this walk to get water every day but she has to do it to live but we see Church One day things were different at the well that she'd walk to every day one day Jesus is waiting for her there now the scripture says and I love this the scripture says Jesus said he must needs go through Samaria now here's the thing I cried when I read this that word needs we say it means necessary but if you look a little deeper it says it was inevitable that he would go there that a child of God in a fallen condition but yet ready to receive the word it was inevitable that God would come her way with the anointed word for her day it was inevitable there was nothing could stop it she couldn't stop it he was coming whether she was ready for him or not Hallelujah when you're a child of God there is an inevitability that he will come your way with the word that'll take you out of your current condition amen hallelujah he can't lose a one of us Church we're engraved in the palms of his hands we're talking about strength and due season today because this is so critical about where we're at we're looking for we're expecting rapturing Faith below that would be healing Faith below that would be provisional faith and and these different things but this woman in all of her frustrations her despair her shame and all of her disappointments she can't get away from herself and yet God Has Come her way to meet her exactly where she's at God has to come her way because that's the only way that's ever going to get her out of where she's at amen so many people in that day received his gifts received his healing received his kind words but they always missed out on the Great greatest thing was to receive he himself they took everything he gave but they didn't receive him and in the end they crucified him they missed out on that greatest blessing they didn't receive the anointed word for their day and yet here's a little prostitute a messed up woman and the anointed word comes to her let's read this as we go together this morning watch the progression of this conversation I just love it it's so beautiful one of my favorite portions of the entire scripture is this story says now Jacob's Well was there Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the six hour he's tired he's tired but he's still there and there came a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus saith unto her give me a drink for his disciples were gone away into the city to buy meat then saith the woman of Samaria unto him how is it that thou being a Jew askest drink of me which am a woman of Samaria for the Jews have no dealings with Samaritans now catch this lesson one the word of God is not bound by our traditions we need to get off of our high horses sometimes we're not here to poke we're not here to point fingers we're here to serve we're here to spread the gospel we're here to show there's a way out of this mess amen Jesus is Anointed to speak to this woman and that's why he's there and he's going to talk to her no matter what she thinks but catch the start of this conversation what is it social issues segregation world affairs perhaps as it would matter to them but Jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that sayth to thee give me a drink thou wouldest as have asked of him and he would have given thee Living Water see watch Jesus now okay he's connected with her I'm a little different but she has no clue how different then he brings up the word he says there's a gift that's here and you don't recognize it I'm a gift to you you think I'm a Jew I'm not a Jew I'm a gift to you if you can only recognize it it says and the woman saith unto him sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that Living Water she's saying listen you can't even get water yourself and you're telling me you're going to give me Living Water art thou greater than our father Jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle see she doesn't have a clue what's going on doesn't stop the word says Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto Everlasting Life Church if people don't get it the first time that's okay just keep talking just keep sharing just keep opening up and see if they'll get it eventually the woman said unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw church God knows how to get our attention he has a conversation with her that he would never have had with anyone else he can only have it with her cuz she's the only one coming in the middle of the day what happened Jesus goes straight to her desire he goes straight to her problem what is it now the anointed word is Discerning the life she's still has no clue what's going on but there's something about this that's keeping her engaged long enough for for her to get what she needs right the word is Discerning her life and she doesn't even know it yet then it says Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come here see now the word's going to the source of the problem he's discerned her need but now he's digging down to what's really causing it and she has a choice here she can get offended she can walk away in a huff because he has no business talking to her about that or she can respond truthfully you know what think I think made the difference Jesus attitude he has nothing to prove no acts to grind he's not trying to pin her down he's just having a calm collected conversation with her catching her spirit and just letting it go where it's going to go he knows what's coming now catch what happens now Jesus says it the right way the woman answered and said I have no husband Jesus said unto her thou has said well I have no husband what she said was true but it was incomplete he said for the thou Hast had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in that said thou truly he says you're right what you said was technically correct but here's the real answer you've had five and now you're living with somebody that isn't your husband so you're right you don't have a husband as far as you're there and now she's got another decision does she crumble in embarrassment does she again go away in a huff in a tantrum or does she admit the truth that shows the character of a true son and daughter of God is when they can admit the truth even when it's hurting the woman said unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet she didn't say you don't understand how hard my life's been she doesn't say you don't understand I was abused as a child you don't understand my daddy left when I was four this is a classic woman with classic daddy issues something in all probability had happened in her life earlier that helped drive her down this road but she doesn't have any of this when it comes out she instantly recognizes now aha there's more happening here than I thought and what does she see Church she sees the opportunity she sees the potential that if there's a man of God that's talking to me there's a purpose why he's talking to me amen what happens now her faith and her hope Collide she says you're a prophet prophets do things with women like me and not the things that everyone else wants to do with me prophets come to women that need help to help them Hallelujah she said now watch this she says you're a prophet answer me something I've got a word question our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where a man ought to worship see she's saying there's she sees there's discernment here and that means that she can get some answers that have been Str bothering her for a while so she latches on to this man this Prophet she wants to know what options she has she wants to know how to worship God properly it says and Jesus saith unto Heroman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father ye worship ye know not what and we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is the truth will set you free when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him see church he has completely dismantled everything that held her back well you say I've got to go to your church you got to sit under this ministry you got to go to this Temple you got to do this he says lady you're completely missing it there's coming a time and it is right now where you can worship Him in spirit and in truth wherever you are he's setting her free he says God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now catch this the woman saith unto him I know that Messiah cometh which is called Christ when he is come he will tell us all things church that ought to make a shout this morning that a woman in her condition completely covered in sin completely covered in shame completely covered in Fallen nature can latch on to the word and say when the anointed word comes my way he'll tell me what you're telling me right now she's Bound in bad decisions Bound by a past she can't undo and yet she latches on she says the Messiah will do what you're doing right now all the Pharisees missed it and this little Fallen woman hot sweaty frustrated catches sight of something and says Messiah will do what you're doing right here what is a church there was still something in her soul I didn't have it in my notes I had it I took it out but there was something in her soul and when that light flashed across it we'll read it in a second that light flashed across it something that was buried so deep under filth and sin and mistakes and bad decisions came to life and that was something she didn't know was there but yet it was always there along and as soon as the anointed word came her way she said this is for me I recognize something here this is different than anything I've ever heard before she knew the sign of the Messiah she knew the message he would bring she knew how to identify him and so despite this looking like any other man she says the Messiah the anointed one has he just walked into my life says and Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto thee am he everybody else is asking him that question and he almost never answers it but when there's one that will receive it he'll tell you right away I'm him this is it you've got it it says and the woman left her water pot and she went her way into the City and sayth to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ is this not the anointed word is it this what we've been looking for In the Flesh isn't it here isn't this the day of our visitation it says then they went out of the city and came onto him and we see if we contined Jesus stayed for two more days and many believed on him and they said we came out because of what you said but we believe because of what he said to us we can't go by somebody else's experience but it brings us in so we can listen and get our own experience with the anointed word ourselves he says watch that woman watch these Pharisees trained up and up you see they said that man is be this man is be elub he's a devil but look when the light flashed across that little predestinated seed there when it struck that real seed of God that was before the foundation of the world probably her name was put on the Lamb's Book of light when it struck that quickly she recognized it in her condition she recognized it Hallelujah in that Fallen condition in the difficulty she was facing in the sweatiness in the tired in all of these things in that yet it came to life under that anointed word hallelujah that's what we're looking for is for God to anoint his word so that we can latch on to it in whatever condition we're in this morning why he says she was ordained before the foundation of the world Church it does not matter where you are this morning to those that are listening to those that were praying for whether it's kids whether it's loved ones whether it's spouses whether it's people in other churches it does not matter how sick we are doesn't matter how tired we are doesn't matter how depressed we are how broken we are how unsure we are he will find you in your condition and he will give you the word that'll take you all the way through it amen that doesn't matter a single bit what we're like right now what matters is will we recognize and receive that anointed word when it comes our way we're in the final Gentile age we're in the Le ofan age in Revelation 3 all that's left now is resurrection and Rapture and we say can we do do it I say we can do it because he said we're going to do it he said there's going to be an overcomer there's going to be a reward there's going to be a people that leave this earth without seeing death amen that's not an event the Rapture is not an event it's a process we see it with Enoch scripture says that Enoch got a body change but it was a process because he walked with God he didn't just walk with God he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and he walked and then one day he got a rapturing revelation I please him he's had happy with where I am I've wrapped myself in his righteousness I'm under his blood and he's ready to take me to rule and reign with him all he's doing brother Braham said what happened is he that foot came up and it didn't touch the ground and he said I might as well just take the next one and he just started walking up and he went right into Glory it's a process the Rapture is a process of building up our character and our faith so that we're fit to rule and reign with him and then we get a glorified body that takes away every of the last vestiges of sin that we have in our life I want to take one more example this morning are we good because we're talking about receiving a body change and I want us to see the progression here because we we we focus on the anointed word but you've got to you've got to see that the word is Anointed from start to finish you have an anointed word promise then you have an anointed word season and then you have the anointed word itself coming to you now we look in in Abraham and Sarah's life here and in Genesis 12 it says the Lord said unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shal be a blessing so here's the word promised now his family will be a great nation now church is this an anointed word is this the anointed word When God says it it's anointed right then the anointing doesn't come later it's anointed from the start amen because it's a word that's given with power to produce it the scripture says that my word will not return to me void that means it's anointed from the start to go out and produce what God Said Amen there is as much anointing on that right there in Genesis 12 as there ever would be there's no difference see what is is we catch it and we think that it's bigger and it's better and it's greater but it's always been there we're just catching it when it comes to us so Abraham leaves his family mostly in he country and he walks around a while and he finally separates from lot and does exactly what God asked him to do and so God comes down in Genesis 15 and he confirms the promise and he says now Abraham said behold thou Hast given me no seed and L one born in my house is my air he says God you said I was going to have I was going to be a great nation and you haven't given me a kid and now I've got a servant that's going to inherit everything if I die right now elazar will get it and behold the word of the Lord came unto him okay word promise Word season and an anointed word in flesh the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine air so here we have the anointed word has come forth said you're going to be a father of many nations you're going to be a blessing to all these people now he says you will father this child yourself see we have a generic word promise now he's making it personal to Abraham Abraham you're going to have a part to play in this right it's totally personal it's truly personal to Abraham now he's got a part to play the word is revealing his portion the word is revealing what he's supposed to do and then in Genesis 17 God said to Abraham as for Sarah thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarah but th but Sarah shall her name be and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yay I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her so now there's a further revealing of the word of the bride's portion not just Abraham now now his family now his wife now his spouse is being lumped in with it see the revealing of the word word is getting more and more personal then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is 100 years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear so Abraham's doubt is based on what the passage of time they're at 24 years and so and some change here he's about to be 100 and he says God this is crazy I'm going to be 100 Sarah's 90 the promise of God has gotten stale that's what he's saying Lord we've gone too long we've gone too far but God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him he says but my Covenant will I establish with Isaac which sh Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year Sarah will produce a child at 90 years old we have the word promise we have the word promis personal and now we have a Word season he says this time next year you'll have a son then we come to Genesis 18 word promise Word season now it's got to be anointed word in flesh says then the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day what is it Church it says the Lord the anointed one amen it's God veiled in flesh and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord he only talks to one he says now if I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant and so they come in and he he he's preparing a meal it says and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold she's in the tent and he said they're wondering but there's only one here and it says and he said I personal pronoun promise Giver anointed word I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself she did not laugh out loud she chuckled inside and said after I'm waxed old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also she's like this ain't happening yeah and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I have shy Bear Child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee now we've got the anointed word The promis Giver is right there and he says now the word's going to be made flesh in you it's not just outside of you now it's got to come into you and you're going to produce the promised word for your time for your age for your season for you personally is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed Church there's a time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid she knew who that was then he's talking like that she realizes uhoh the anointed word just discerned what was going on inside of me what she said was truthful from an outside perspective but see God goes straight to the heart and he sees what's in there he says no she laughed for she was afraid but he said nay but thou did laugh now catch what happened remember the woman at the well said Messiah will tell us these things it's not that he's telling her Doctrine on where to worship it's that Messiah will come and discern the thoughts and the intents of the heart for the purpose of setting the people free and so what happens is when Christ comes by way of that woman at the well what is it he comes and he gives the secrets of the heart and he tells her the truth of the matter and she says I'm just like Sarah he's doing what he did to Sarah and that's what made her recognize it it wasn't his doctrine that did it it was when he went into her life and he showed her what needed to be done there God's with Abraham and he he perceived Abraham's lack of belief earlier on and then he perceived it with Sarah even though she said nothing he says why did Sarah laugh and Sarah says I didn't laugh and she didn't laugh out loud but she laughed in her heart and the word you see is a discerner then of what's going on on the inside and if the anointed word comes our way Church it will surely do the same thing and the only question we have to ask is will we be honest or will we say no I didn't no I'm not that way no that's not my problem or will we say I know Jehovah's here I know the discerner is here I know the anointed word is here I love reading these things because as I said the word cannot return to God void Sarah laughed and she had doubt Abraham laughed and he had doubt they tried so many ways to make it happen on their own and all they did was make a big mess but that word promise was given that God said the season for the Fulfillment of the word is here then the anointed word came in flesh to her and he says Abraham it's time for you to get the reality of what we've been talking about all this time God's saying now is the time and Abraham and Sarah say we got nothing every opportunity we had is behind us and now you're saying it's the time why because the power is in the word not in me power is in the word it's not in you that's my rest is on what he said not on what I am not on what I do Sarah never could have children if you look in the scriptures her body just wasn't built for it it wasn't right she was always incapable of having a child and so God didn't fix her body God gave her a new body and here's the thing I would imagine with Sarah here's a thing God knows how to do a work you think you don't have faith when God's done you'll have faith because Sarah and I don't know if it happened overnight for her and for Abraham I genuinely don't know the scripture doesn't tell us but all we know is Sarah went from an old woman that couldn't have children to the point where the king of guar aimc chooses a 90-year-old woman as the most beautiful woman he's ever seen women if that wouldn't give you faith I don't know what is amen they did a poll on what attracts men to women and women to men based on age and for women they're attracted to men roughly at the same age they are you know what women men are attracted to women 21 to 23 their entire life Sarah got a 21y old body as a 90-year-old and the King took her and tried to make her his wife until God stopped him amen I'm guessing that gave Sarah a little bit of confidence that God was going to do a work can you imagine she went to bed wrinkled and old maybe chubby completely out of shape nothing where it was supposed to be and she wakes up the next morning and Abraham's left the tent because he's convinced that another woman has come into his bed what will the anointed word do for us church if it can change Sarah's body it can take us out of this pest house amen hallelujah her experience with the Living God is what gave her faith look at what the scripture says as we start to close through faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed her experience with God gave her faith to prod produce the word promise God never said I'm going to give you a new body God said I'm going to give you a son and that included the new body with it though he never told her and she wakes up one day maybe it took days who knows I like to think it happened in in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's the type but regardless something changed and all of a sudden she realized this is really going to happen she received strength in due season to conceive seed she never could before and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who have promised you might say what does this have to do with teach My Hands to War we're learning how to wait we're learning how to trust we're learning how to keep our mind centered on the things of God we've got to find our word our our word promise we've got to find our Word season and then we've got to say I need that word to be anointed in my life amen scripture says every bit of the word of God is given by inspiration it's profitable for Doctrine for reprove for correction and instruction and righteousness but there's a portion that's just for us and nobody else can fulfill it we're in the end of the church ages we're in Revelation 3 and the lean Church age we've got to overcome lukewarmness get in or get out that's really what he's saying I want you to get in or I want you to get out but I don't want you to stay in the middle there where you're not any good to me we're in Revelation 10 in the open book we're not in Revelation 10:7 Church we're in Revelation 108 and he said unto John take the book and eat it and thou must prophesy you must speak the word and it has to come into effect in your life it can't stay with the mighty angel now it's got to come down into the bride it's got to come down into the people of of an end time rapturing message amen we're in Malachi 4 where our h hearts are being turned back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers not a Pentecostal move not Pentecostal signs and wonders but the original faith that kept them in tune with the Holy Ghost we're in 1 Thessalonians 4 at the time of the Resurrection The Rapture amen we're in Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we see all these people we see Sarah and Abraham and many Heroes of the faith and they held on that portion of the word and they just kept walking scripture says Abraham called those things that were not as though they were and those things that were as though they were not his confession was the word is true and he just walked day by day and we see the faults we see the flaws we see the Disobedience we see the trying to make it happen but not a single thing stopped that word from coming to pass in their life and that word was settled sometimes I think it showed their faith that they tried to make it happen cuz they believed it was going to happen and they thought maybe I can make it happen we can't make it happen we can't make it happen but if we'll yield to it and trust God he brings it to pass in our life amen scripture says this as we close the musicians can come wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait on the Lord that's the trial of our faith the scripture says the trial of faith worketh it produces patience be of good courage and he shall there's a certainty with the word shall it means it's going to happen it's inevitable he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord he says and I'll say this my brother he'd come from Glory this afternoon to set any one of you free that's right he will come down through every church and every critic and everything else and every fanatic and everything else to you to heal you this morning to make you right that's not just your body that's your mind remember Jesus came to heal the brokenhearted those that were bruised it's not just the physical it's the mental it's the it's the emotional side it's the entire thing he's here with healing in his wings he says he'll come to heal you this afternoon to make you right just let him find one sincere heart that he can get into he will come any time any hour of the night I'm so thankful we have a doctor that'll come anytime he says oh I'm so happy for that to know that he's my refuge and strength the very present help in the time of trouble amen God bless you let's stand together if we would wait on the Lord be of good courage and he will strengthen thine heart wait I say on the lord it's a trial of our faith it's a hardest thing for the Believers the waiting the uncertainty the not seeing the not knowing except that something in your heart tells you but this is what believers do they believe amen that's what Overcomers do is they overcome and they do it by faith that he's going to do the work amen that he's got a redeeming work he's got a healing work he's got a leading work he's got a rapturing work that's going on whether we see it or not and sometimes the only thing we can have is that cry in our heart but I'm thankful it's there that when it looks so far beyond anything I've ever experienced so far beyond anything I've ever preached when it's so far beyond anything that I've seen anybody else do yet there's a cry there there's a longing in my heart to be with him and there's a cry that's going to take us there and it brings that anointed word to us and it brings it into our bodies it brings it into our flesh it brings our our our very nature subject to what's going to happen by that anointed word amen I pray God help us keep our minds seted on him amen that we'd spend our days and we have so much Satan is a master of filling our days but I'll tell you if we take stock of how we're spending our time I believe we can do a little more for him I believe we can do a lot more for him amen that we can we can have that tension day by day I love how brother R said to the he said to the sisters he said whether you're washing your dishes Brothers whether you're about your work it doesn't matter keep your mind centered on him and he'll draw near to you and he'll give you strength to face your day he'll give you strength for your heart to hold on to those things that you're you're holding before the throne of grace amen amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord you are our God lord your scripture says that in
