wonderful that Jesus is our solid rock all right got your Bible this morning let's stand to our feet if you would we're gonna go to Joshua chapter one this morning and then get right to the Word of God starting at verse one if you will baby take this right here and just lay this right over there if you will sweetheart thank you thank you thank you so much appreciate it all right darlin thank you and good singing this morning saying that's why I keep you around so all that good singing amen good cooking good singing amen and she's not bad to look at - she kind of look pretty to me amen but that's that's all right but anyhow now we're gonna look here Joshua chapter one and one down to verse 6 now I I want to take for a subject this morning we've been speaking the last couple days on because your sons and and I've thrown a lot of little titles and thoughts and things out there to you but I want to keep with the same theme this morning so for the recording this morning from brother Matt in them that is this would be because you are sons again this morning but I want to take kindly for a subject and and and I want to look at no shortcuts to adoption no shortcuts to adoption and what we're going to look at and as we've been studying this weekend about adoption and what it means to be an adopted son of God remember daughters that includes you as well and and what it means to be an adopted son we saw last night that when the inspector is looking for something in order to inspect or looking at something in our lives he's not looking for great miraculous power he's not looking for some supernatural output some supernatural workup and all that comes with the Christian life of course but what we have to understand is that the inspector God himself is looking for he's looking for the character of Jesus Christ and that doesn't always have maybe a display to the whole world it's just maybe your spirit of influence your school your work or wherever you might be your family but we want to look at this adoption part what I want to do this morning I want to take the children of Israel as a pattern for what we want to try to talk about for a little while alright verse 1 now after the of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses ministers saying Moses my servant is dead now and just to bring this in right quickly you you understand this was probably a difficult thing for these people to really comprehend and no doubt the man that had brought them out of Egypt now if you can picture in your mind being slaves and in servitude and now this great prophet of God has wrought miracles left and right there's been all kinds of great things done plagues and everything has fallen he's taking you through 40 years of this wilderness and now they they punctuate this man's life by letting the people know Moses my servant is dead now that's that's quite a remark and they knew the potentials that lay within the Ministry of this prophet now but what's the command of God did not stop at Moses death just the same as it didn't stop with brother branham's death there was a greater purpose that the message brought after Moses left us after brother Branham left us there's a greater purpose there here's the purpose now therefore arise go now that's the message today if you want to talk about what is the opening of the seals what is the message of the hour what is the evening light that's the message to you and I now arise and go go over this Jordan Dow and all this people under the land which I do give them and even to the children of Israel every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said to Moses for the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and under the Great Sea toward their going down at the Sun shall be your coast there should not be any man able to stand before the all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage for unto this people shout thou divided for inheritance to the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them now of course Lord speaking to Joshua and these words and these verses but now once this message is communicated to the children of Israel you imagine what they must have thought they had no experience with Joshua they had no background with Joshua as far as him taking a stick in dividing waters and calling plagues down and getting in the face of Pharaoh and standing there and confronting Pharaoh they had no experience like this with Joshua so they imagined the people were probably a little you know kindly awkward maybe feeling about the whole situation and as it always is with the changing of a leader there's always an awkwardness there and and people of course brother brems said one time about natural shepherds he said how hard it was to train sheep to the voice of another Shepherd it's the same way in the spiritual as well but the changing of a guard or the changing of a leader it's quite difficult but God is telling Joshua you go do the work you take the ministry on and you take these people over and as I was with Moses I'll be with thee now once you notice something Joshua doesn't call down one plague Joshua doesn't challenge not one Pharaoh Joshua doesn't open not one Red Sea so in contrast to the Ministry of Moses what Joshua was gonna do is a whole lot smaller in a way just by the outside look of it then what we see out of Moses the death angel may pass through Egypt and and then the Passover is established and all these other things are happening now Joshua does great things no doubt he's a great warrior of God but in comparison visibly speaking to the things that God did with Moses it doesn't look as big coming to Joshua as it did with Moses when the angel of the Lord meets him there at the foot of Jericho and tells him to march around it's just Joshua and the Lord there and and many of the experiences that Joshua had the people simply had to trust that Joshua was being obedient to the Lord and that was a hard thing to do because the visibility of it wasn't as clear with Joshua perhaps as it was with Moses every time they looked at Moses he was up there on the mountain the pillar of fire was hanging on him his face was glowing with the glory of God and then they look at Joshua standing there with a sword in his hand no glory no no cloud no pillar of fire hanging over him he doesn't have a stick in his hand he's got a sword in his hand and now they're being asked to trust this man to do the same job as I was with Moses as I'll be with you so this was a difficult thing for these people but now remember as they are progressing in their maturity what you would say was visible is beginning to diminish a little bit more and God is beginning to focus upon the character of these people the position of these people all right let's pray over the word and I'll let you be seated father thank you for the reading of the word today Lord Jesus we know that as we read the Bible we know that the Holy Spirit is here right now this morning as we're gathered here in 2 and 3 to be able to take this word and break it to our heart so I ask you to do so father as you bless both speaker and listener and the remainder of this service and all that's been accomplished for that glory in the name of Jesus Christ and the church said amen and greetings to everybody online the invisible audience as well as the visible thank you to brother Gerald in the church body for receiving us good to see everybody this morning and and Jenna and Leah and Priscilla sister Berta just everybody just not see everybody this morning I sure wish I could be there and and I don't see Chad I guess chatty ain't there this morning no well I was hoping to hear that big Amen before this weekend expired so maybe he'll holler loud enough on Facebook or one of them maybe I'll hear you plumb over here amen amen but anyhow we're so thankful to be a part of the great program of God now you could be seated if you'd like to be seated for a little while and I got you a good stretch of your legs there because we go to buckle in take your time this morning and go through a couple things and I want to try if the Lord will help us to look at this no shortcuts now and just hold your place there and Joshua now I want to read you just a spot here from you must be borned again and this is what I'm going to kindly base my thought on just for a little bit and and brother branham is speaking about shortcuts in this if you'd like to look at this it's you must be born again it's paragraph 146 and 147 if you if you like to go back in and I don't know but the matter you're recording these messages aren't you like this all right well then the people you guys you folks can get these and listen to them later if you don't remember all the text and you can go back over them if you need to or if you want to and and and and listen at some of the statements here from brother Branham but if you listen to this now brother bream starts out by saying shortcuts he said tonight they're out here today and they're going on and tomorrow they want to preach he said Pentecostal people letting him do that he said yeah they want a shortcut to heaven he said hallelujah all I have to do is get down here just don't think of nothing at all and say hallelujah hallelujah I got an Elijah's garment I'm gonna go out tomorrow and cast Devils hallelujah hallelujah I got it praise God here I go he said they want the shortcut to heaven taking as much of the world as they can take he said you can't take any of it there's no shortcuts you come the way of Calvary you come the way of the brass altar you come the way of the brazen serpent you die you said you actually die oh god why can't I say it right you die literally die to yourself die to the things of the world and are born to do a man who says no world the things of the world is dead there's no shortcuts see they want to come right quick now watch this carefully they don't want to grow we grow in the Lord it takes growth and experience now think of that for just a moment it takes growth and experience people are told out on the west coast now oh we've got the immortal baptism we baptize you in water you turn back to a young man right here young woman yes sir they got Elijah's garments they've got manifested sons of God he said yes sir brother God's getting manifested sons right now manifested tell them all about this now watch what he says tonight you're a sinner and tomorrow you're a manifested son of God what do y'all reckon brother brems says to this maybe I could get it up here where you can see it I'll just let you see the word if you can if I can get my my picture in there can you see it nonsense he says nonsense today you're a son of God tomorrow you're a manifested son of God nonsense where did you get that in the word babies are not born men they're born babies and grow to men all right now you remember last night I was speaking to you a little while about what it would take to get us there remember I talked about the tree being planted by the rivers of water and we took David and how that David was anointed the King positionally placed the seed was placed by the rivers of water and all of that was established as it needed to be established but it took time to grow there now if we take our Bible and go to Galatians chapter five let's just I don't have it wrote down here but I want to just grab this verse for just a little bit because I think there's a beautiful thing in here that we could talk about for just a moment to kind of get kind of get the understanding of it down now Galatians chapter 5 let's just grab that right quick and then I want to look at some of these fruits of the spirit for just a moment and see and and and and just just I want to just add to your understanding a little bit about where these fruits come in at now if you will just just read just one verse with me here at the top then we're gonna skip down verse well let's just pick up verse 16 how about that he said this I say then walk in the spirit fifth chapter sorry fifth this chapter help you know if you were the chapters that would fifth chapter and then verse 16 then I say then this I say walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh all right now dropping down you will notice as you read down through there that he speaks of what all of the fruit if we could call it this way the fruit of wickedness is in a person's life now I just want you all to think of this if a person is bearing forth from the tree of knowledge of good and evil then everything in 17 18 19 20 and 21 is what they're going to produce out of their life so until the individual is eating from a different seed eating from a different tree manifesting and bearing from a different life source they will always produce this alright listen close Church it doesn't matter if the person you're talking about is even religious if they're not born again all of this in this part right here and these verses here no matter how religious they might be no matter how many books they might quote from no matter how many times they pay ties or worship the Lord or sing or play a preach or whatever they do if they're not born again this is going to manifest out of their life in some way or another they're gonna have things such as ambient adulteries fornications lasciviousness witchcraft see hatred emulation revel ins you know in other words reveling as others rioted 'no sin other words you know cause and havoc stirring up problems creating issues and and and all such like this now all that do these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God now those are those that are born these are those that are born off of that tree of knowledge and good and evil all right everybody with me so far say Amen all right so then the knowledge of good and evil then no matter how religious they might be on the outside remember the devil last night standing for that religious white cloak on in that first horse he's just as religious as he can be and don't forget this church for the Living God bride never let this escape your mind the devil is not a drunk laying in a gutter somewhere neither the devil is religious amen don't ever forget that he is a religious creature he is a religious being always has been from the very beginning so then these things that are produced out of somebody's life these are the fruit of this wicked tree of this wicked life this is what people were produced out of their life now you say brother band I see a couple of these things Conley working from you well that's right your flesh will produce these things however if you are born again then as Peter said we've been kind of touching on it you can catch it in first Peter there he said we are born of incorruptible seed all right incorruptible seed has been birthed on the inside of us while we're still living in a corruptible body see corruptible seed on the outside incorruptible on the inside so what does that do puts you in a war then you have the outside desires fighting against the inside desires we know all this but it's just a just a review just to kind of get down to a point here but then once that once that spirit then takes root and then begins to produce the life of Christ then idolatry witchcraft hatred wrath strife seditions heresies all of these things then become subject hallelujah and praise the Lord a man subject to the word that is birthed on the inside of you Amen do you see that Amen in other words a Christian might fight and wrestle with sedition they might wrestle with heresy they might be trapped up in seducing spirits they might get trapped up in different things witchcraft and other things you say how in the world could a Christian get trapped up in witchcraft well the Bible said rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft so you could get trapped up in having a rebellious spirit on you and things of that nature but if the life of Jesus Christ amen and I'm trying to find a place to put my Bible because I'm feeling awful Pentecostal right now amen but if the life of Christ is on the inside of you then it will bring all of those things subject to the word that is laying on the inside of you and where there was witchcraft and rebellion and all these other things then the Holy Spirit will grab that and bring it subject to the word so you're not doing that no more those things are over that's all relevance said how do you know you work wicked he said your desires changed a man that's the one best way to figure out whether or not the tree has been birthed if it's been produced all right now if we pick up the in Galatians chapter 22 now I want you to really take this carefully you've read it a million times but let's read it deeper today than what we've ever read it but I like that word but because it gives a change of direction and now if I like what Scofield says here if you've got a little Scofield Bible there's a mark there number one next to but he said that Christian character is not mere moral or legal correctness but possession and manifestation of nine Grace's which is right these these fruits of the spirit these nine fruits of the spirit are the manifestation and like what Scofield said here he said it is the character in expression toward man so all of these things are not moral and legal correctness let's just take for example these these works of darkness and things on the bad side you know a person could teach them self train themselves they could you know discipline their mind to not commit adultery all right the Pharisees were such people they could train them so to live a more moral correctness or they could live according to the law a legal as Schofield said here a legal correctness all right but that doesn't mean that by doing so by by squashing and quashing some of these these actions that doesn't mean that the fruit of life the fruit of the Spirit is growing on the inside of the heart oh I hope you get that church I hope you understand you visible and invisible I want you to listen to rather been carefully it doesn't matter if a person even learns how not to manifest these works of darkness and all they put on is a legal correctness without the birth of the spirit that is a manufactured holiness and not a holiness that comes from a birthing of the Holy Spirit amen does everybody get that all right if you do say man now now the fruit then of what capital SPI RIT of the spirit so the fruit we're referring to now remember this is the fruit of the Spirit not the fruit of your training not the fruit of your discipline not the fruit of your teaching not the fruit of what my mama told me not to do it so I don't do it or I'm told to love so I do so because that's what I'm supposed to do but these and I want you to think now I want you to think real deep about the scripture because this is a real blessing to you if you can if you can get a hold of this if you can latch onto this this will change your life the fruit of the Spirit then is not a mental or moral legal discipline or legal discipline but the fruit of the Spirit is the actual birthing out from the nature of God to interrupt your own nature did you get that the fruit of the Spirit hallelujah I got glory bumps all the way down my back I hope you got that the fruit of the Spirit is actually something that interrupts is the birthing of God in you that interrupts your human nature it disrupts your life I want you to think about that just a minute now you think what Jesus said when he talked about coming in and doing things and all of that remember what he said I come to bring a sword division in other words I come to interrupt things I come to interrupt families I come to interrupt churches I come to enter that's what Jesus's purpose was when he came to the world you said I come to bring division and separate and so on and so forth in other words interrupt I come to interrupt stuff alright now once you realize every person preacher and all set right here produces and manifest these evil works out of their way in some way well you say I've never committed adultery I'll be careful remember what Jesus said when a man looks on a woman to lust he's already been there see he's already went to that place fornication and so forth uncleanliness well we could go a hundred of different ways with that remember the Lord Jesus and the Beatitudes he brought these things down to more than just a moral or an actionable something something we do physically or with our bodies or something like that but Jesus brought these down to even hating hatred you say I've never had hatred but if you're angry with your brother without a cause jesus said in doing so it's hatred you just same as killed him you don't have to take a gun shoot somebody just speak against their influence I was saying it the other day I said that's the thing about leaders and preachers and people like that we have to put up with people falsely accusing us of things all the time that's one of the greatest battle that a preachers got nearly if you could if you could overcome everything everybody says about you and what everybody talks about you if you can get people to believe you beyond all that nonsense what you're doing pretty good as a leader because the minute you start doing good and helping people I guarantee somebody's got some critic about it well I don't he don't say it the way I like it and you don't do it the way I like it and all that well that's the beautiful thing about preaching they didn't hire me they can't fire me and I'm not put on this earth to please them and say it the way they want it I'm here to preach the gospel and that's the way it's being preached amen amen that's right and said well but I wish they wouldn't yell at us all that hollering we don't like that stuff well if you felt like I felt the anointing on me like I feel you might do a little hollering too and then on the other side I wish they'd holler and more and then I feel like well if you were settled and grounded in the word you might settle down a little bit instead of running here and there and jumping without any kind of a real message of God we're seeking for balance friends oh you got people you know and probably not in y'all's church but you know how it goes well I don't know why Bob sings that song all the songs so you could sing as a song there why does he pick that song well you see everybody got a critic about something everybody got something they got to say about some another well why does sister Myrna Playa get why don't she play a flute I think she'd be better with a flute instead of a guitar some little old thing like that they've always got some critics somehow another so if we can learn to overcome all of the hubbub and all the hearsay and all that stuff that goes on around us and focus on what the Holy Spirit wants for our lives that's the main objective of this last day because if the devil can confuse you and get your eyes off on every other thing in the world yes see because you're not fooling me I know how we are as humans we gauge whether we're doing well or not by based on what we hear from other people you know somebody comes and tells you hey you're pretty good Christian well you walk a little taller that day and you know and and and you pray a little bit deeper and you might even say some thees and thous in your prayer closet amen we have a tendency to gauge yourself based upon what the external is seeing out of our lives but I want to encourage you this way I want you to think of this way it is not that is not the way we gauge whether or not the Holy Spirit is acting how we know the Holy Spirit is growing and acting is there is an absolute interruption of your nature when you want to do something and then sup on the inside of you goes well you ought to be thankful for that little because that is interrupting your human nature it's bringing and producing a result out of you that wouldn't normally have been there why do y'all reckon that people do these things so much the bad stuff now why do I reckon people do you think they feel bad after they cussed you a blue street because what about for nanoseconds after the light turned green you didn't mash on your gas pedal and go oh I'm screaming up the road and they're blowing their horn and sticking their fingers up at you in all that you make a feel bad about that they get on the internet and they fuss other people about it they said this dummy got in my way I couldn't believe it I honked at him shot there for four nanoseconds like I had to take a breath before he started moving you see that's people that's the way they are they don't feel bad about none of that stuff but what makes you feel bad Church something's there to interrupt you oh yeah come on don't look at me that way now every one of us every one of us we've got the same potentials as everything that I read right here all of us have had that temptation to blow the horn and a holler get out of the way you dummy get out of the way what's the matter with you gas pedals on the right don't you know how to drive who give that guy his license on and on and on and on and on but what interrupts you and makes you feel like you know maybe I should be a little sweeter about this yeah he might not be too bright you might know where the gas pedal is but bless his heart at least he's in a car driving he could be walking no legs or some kind of thing I mean what makes you think of things in a manner in which that you you try to you try to give the guy little rope huh are you with me huh what makes you do that what are up ssin causes that change in you it's the fruit of the Spirit that's living down inside that born-again heart raise the Lord and that borned again is producing an interruption that changes the whole scheme of the things alright just look at the contrast to this the fruit of the Spirit is what what's that first word somebody tell me love well that's the exact contrast to hatred all right now I don't know if you I don't know if some of you Eagles are gonna be chickens this morning and not be brave enough to admit this but have you ever battled hatred anybody want to be courageous today alright see a few heads nodding and hand it going there you go alright well what makes you sister Leah what makes you keep going and getting a gun and just blowing their brains out just say done with them huh or running over them with one of your with a quad or some kind of thing like that what makes you just what makes you just keep from going out there and just just I mean just waylaying them huh what makes you all stop that brother Matt what is it inside of you that keeps you from going and getting your moose hunter your big Moose gun and just blowing their big toes off to take that huh what causes the difference in you that not now I'm making it kindly ridiculous in other words so you can make it a little bit clearer picture to you because you could say specific things but I just want I just want to get you a general picture of it what makes you do it what interrupts your thoughts whatever she's took your hairbrush for the 400th time and you'd like to commit murder right there on the scene losing your hairbrush Sam's always taking mine I got three girls in the house four girls captain Sam I haven't had a hairbrush since 1998 amen they're always stealing my work amen and it makes me feel bad because I want to comb what hair I got left you understand what makes you what makes that something that comes up you said boy I'd like to get them man I'd like to get them oh the angel halos are just aglow in this morning look at you folks you so sainted I thought that was just a blur on the computer no that's the holy aura of Christ coming off you little angels this morning I'm sure ain't none of you ever had these things in your mind have you ah words a man Church but what stops you what makes it different for you than for everybody else very simply put what makes it different is the interruption of love contrasts and fights and battles that hatred that lays in the human flesh you see it something raises up on the inside of you that says uh uh don't you think you should pray for that fella oh it's just a hairbrush bin you'll be all right what is it that stalks you out of your tree don't say psychology because some people make they've used human psychology that's true but listen no matter how good your psychology is it cannot contrast genuine hatred that lays inside the human being it cannot do it takes the love of God the absolute love of God to contrast and fight that other part of it now remember what we're talking about no shortcuts to adoption we got to get right to the meat of this all right then joy I just did I don't know if some of you been seeing the little minute clips I've been doing on Facebook a little minute videos and I just did one on happiness and and it's hard to condense all that down in just a few moments time but I did a little clip and I was sharing with some folks that some of the premiere studies on the science of happiness the one thing they found out of tens of thousands of people plumb down in elementary school children was that there was no way that a person seeking for fame or money or being better looking or some kind of thing like that that every time a person in that condition even an elementary kid seeking for being some sports star was more unhappy than the person that worked on stuff from the inside Family Values and committing to the Lord and and and relationships and friendship those were people that were genuinely happy folks that sought for more money you understand not just making money but always seeking for more money trying to get that next level financially and hit the big time those people were genuinely unhappy all the time so what makes a Christian happy which is the question I asked that a day in my little one-minute clip what's what makes us genuinely happy and the Bible said the joy of the Lord and the book of Habakkuk said the joy of the Lord is where I get my my happiness from so this joy now I want you to think about this this joy can be manifesting itself in you even when emulation strife rav-4 negation idolatry hatred variance emulations and all that is going on around you even though your life is influenced by all of that the joy of the Lord can manifest itself in the midst of all of that nonsense Amen that should have got a great big hallelujah praise the Lord because the joy of the Lord isn't necessarily something you feel the joy of the Lord is something that keeps you positive keeps you striving keeps you pushing on even though everything else around you is not that way you know what give that woman when that man walked in there and said you want to see a Christian come home drunk staggering around brought his buddies in there and said you want to see Christian I'll show you one took him eggs and slammed him against the wall and you know I don't like my eggs that way woman now she didn't start laughing uh god bless you honey god bless you it's not that kind of joy but she's meekly bowed her head swept up them eggs singing must Jesus bear the cross alone what done that for the joy of the Lord was her strength she had a joy knowing that God was on her side and if God was for her who could be against her somebody say hey man I don't know yet the joy the Lord gave her a positivity that even a negativity the joy that come from this the positivity that come from this type of joy gave her positivity in the midst of negativity hi friend this ain't mind over matter mind you this is something a whole lot deeper than mind over matter it is the word being birthed out now we'll just take one more here just quickly and that is faith all right faith is a long-range vision it sees way on down the road faith is a burly man with muscles and holds the sword of the word and faith is a powerful is a powerhouse and powerful and all that all right but faith is a contrast to everything else you are in your human nature that's why no matter how much you try to believe it up here it must eventually make that journey from here down to your heart to where faith takes a whole but you realize faith here isn't just necessarily believing God but faith could be interpreted it could also be used as faithfulness being loyal being faithful to God all right now with all of that said now now let's revisit for just a moment the quote I was reading to you here where brother Branham said these things take time he said that's the problem with the church they get down hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said in the next day they want to be out casting out Devils he said they want to be doing this or that or the other now what he's trying to tell us is these things are a process all right so love doesn't come out of your heart automatically it may take some time for that kind of love to grow into you this is one thing I'm so thankful about the Holy Ghost watching over our lives and being mindful of us because there's many times that works of the flesh would have overcome us but the Holy Ghost come in and chopped it off and said no way no way you're not going that far when I was in Mexico number of years ago there was a brother and he was a little ragged looking fella I mean just just terrible didn't even have a tie and I give me my title to my neck and I hand put it on him and I said he was an older man I said there you go Padre acid the father in other words the Padre I said here you go Padre and he he just started smiling and crying he gripped that tied he said that you great servant of God would gift this tie to me we'll come to find out that this man was somebody that had such a prayer life that God would give him visions and so he was down praying and and and all at once he sees this man and he doesn't recognize this man but he sees the street he sees the area he's at and in this vision the Lord showed him that another man had molested his girl and this man with a gun in his hand was walking down the street was gonna go blow that man away and so here he goes down and the brother recognizes the street he charges in this whole little almost dilapidated the poor little thank you barely walk and he's charged it in you imagine is just quick as he could go and he sees this man almost reaching the house with his pistol in his pocket he walks up and gets him by the arm puts his hand on that pistol and he said and his horse in Spanish and he grabbed a hold of his arm in that pistol laid his hand kind of over the pocket like and said don't do what you're gonna do jesus loves you and the man stopped for a moment and he said I told the Lord if God loved me at all and God cared about me and almost mindful of this situation somehow the Holy Spirit would intervene and interrupt this situation and that's exactly what God did laid his hand right on in the pit pistols in his pockets you couldn't have saw it you know walk around big old coat on something like that he put his hand right where the pistols at put his hand on his arm like that and said don't do what you're going to do the man fell on his face before God repented right there on the street now I said that to say this now that when I first heard that story as a Christian I said to myself brother man I said oh I am as short as sure can be man I need to get down to business with God because these are experiences that bride needs to have these experiences and then the Holy Spirit showed me something those things don't always happen right away now you ever stop to think why do we fast why do we pray more than one time about things why don't we continue fighting and wrestling in prayer about issues it's the same reason when you're looking at your garden out there and you know it's gonna produce fruit you know it will as you can see the leaves everything is healthy the grounds right the water content the nutrients the Sun everything is just exact right spot and you're looking at that plan and you're saying to that little plan I know you're gonna produce tomatoes this year I know you're gonna produce beans squash whatever it may be I know you're gonna bring forth but it takes time and you can stand there and scream at it you could annoy no ever top of that that plant so all right now do it but it doesn't happen until it grows into that plants life now many years later the experiences like that as I grew in the Lord experience is not exactly but similar things we can say equal or lesser value perhaps I don't know similar things in ministry stuff would happen while I'm preaching and praying for people and different things God would do and all that and and and I would think to myself years ago I thought something but the Bible I thought something's got to be wrong with me because if I'm the Christian I'm supposed to be all of this supernatural stuff would be happening around me do you understand that the greatest supernatural thing that could be happening is happening right now would you like to know what it is you're growing it doesn't get any bigger than that now all that will produce out of your life you know it'll eventually show up just like Elizabeth my oldest daughter she bought up I call it a chrysanthemum and it's not a criminai it's liable to be a daffodil I don't know what it is it's a pretty flower but anyhow I say it wrong every time I said I've been calling it a petunia for a week but I know that ain't that it's not even a flowers a petunia don't think but anyhow I looked down up the thing and it had buds all over you know and I told her I said hey that petunias gonna grow out of course she rolls her eyes at me daddy don't do do nothing right and I I looked at it and I thought nah man it's about ready to burst open a week and a half later I was still looking at the same buds and I mean it looked like it was on the verge of just now I know y'all have still got 14 foot of snow out there you probably haven't seen the flower as of yet but but I know it's coming there it does exist even a new burl and you do get some good weather every now and then I know that man but I looked at that thing two weeks two weeks I looked it looked like him flowers just swelling out like they're getting ready just pop open at any moment two weeks I watch for that plant to start growing I waited and waited and waited I got look at it I started talking to it I said petunia what's the matter with you horse first thing he told me is my name ain't petunia hallelujah but as I was studying it and I was looking at it I recognized I recognized the greatest thing that could be happening for that plant was taking place it was growing and in a matter of days all of a sudden from one night to the next I walked out there in this great big beautiful flower it opened up and it was laying right out there and just a just a matter of moments from one night to the next morning the second that Sun come out in the morning it already bloomed out and I could have got frustrated looking at it and you know where I'm Adam I walk with God I should be casted out Devils give it a little time the bud might be ready to open up and it might be on the verge of opening but never ever ever ever ever rush nature allow it to do what it's supposed to do because if you don't you'll stop and kill the growth of that thing altogether you have to allow it to move at the right moment I wonder if that's what Solomon was thanking when he wrote those words God makes all things beautiful in his time now you look down at your lives you know I've got all kinds of faith I believe God sure you do you might be like that little flower get ready to burst open but just give it time just allow the Holy Spirit to come in there and allow it to just grab all the nutrients it's need it needs because remember while it's in that little budding state it's protected the second it opens up it's got to have that vulnerability to not only be able to take an assault you understand the weather's going to beat on it the sun's gonna hit on it and all that so it's got to be ready to open up not to mention it's got to be ready to give because bees and what more I got carpenter bees all over my my front porch and they come over there and they've got the little yellow on their legs where they're taking pollen from that flower it's got to have enough inside of it to not only give but take the beating on the outside you would not want to rush that prematurely in other words you can't take a shortcut now it's been easy to reach down and start peeling that little flower open say come on I want to see your bud get out here and in some cases you might have been able to open it up and see the bud but if you took a shortcut you would have heard it you'd have heard it but I said they want to take a shortcut to heaven he said there's no shortcuts he said you literally die to yourself he said they don't want to grow and that's right they don't want to grow he said they want to come right quick how many times have you seen that even in message preaching sometimes I'm not being critical or preachers but I'm just I think we need to straighten out and address some of these issues we hear even message preaching sometimes year where the bride we're ready for the rapture we're gonna take maybe 4 1 how does that preacher know that he don't know Jesus didn't know the day nor the hour and I'm certainly not gonna be silly enough to look at the people of God and say we're ready I don't know you might we might be like that little budding flower and if I'm not careful I might rush it all we're manifested sons of God we're ready to take on the devil better be careful brother because whenever the tide turns and it's time for this bride to come to the final showdown of this final hour and her stand out before the world I'm talking about mark of the beast the squeeze church is shutting Evert you can't buy nor sell when that hour comes when we start kind of crossing into that little time period for that short quick work when the elect of God has got to stand on this earth and perhaps speak food by creative power on her table you better believe she better be ready for that moment because if you're Russian she won't be able to take the pressure and she won't be able to give what it takes remember but I've been talk about the third pole and spoken word he said when the farmer needs water for his crops I give you your water your rain in Jesus Christ name and there will come an hour when the bride will face a great persecution now I don't believe the bride goes through tribulation by no means not at all I think a lot of the stuff that people are carrying on about I think it's because they've got a doomsday mentality I don't believe we're gonna be living in in our basements eating k-rations and you know and having to save up jugs of water and in you know neat freeze-dried fruit for six months and stuff like I don't believe the brides that are gonna see things like that now there's no doubt there'll be a cross over time where there'll be a persecution there'll be a squeeze they'll be all of that but most of what people are thinking is what the food is purged and they're gonna see the church is gonna see it we won't see it anybody ever try to squeeze a bar or soap in the shower anybody ever squeeze it really hard got a idea what happens to that bar or soap when you squeeze it really hard and so is there gonna be a squeeze sure this gonna be a squeeze they gonna probably shut churches sure that gonna shut them down show there's gonna be a lot of persecution come on but the harder they squeeze this where the Brad ago Luke should is pop right out of here and wraps the resurrection to be all over with all right now no shortcuts we cannot take a shortcut in our new birth experience we cannot shortcut our way to adoption because again when that hour arrives that the bride is going to have to stand there in a fight on Showtime remember the final showdown is between Jesus and denominations and if you are God walking in shoe leather if you are Jesus Christ and shoe leather you understand if you are the manifestation of these sons and these daughters when that hour comes that the world turns against you the little Fowler that little flower better be ready to open up and take the pressure so we can't rush it just like in the new birth I hear people make altar calls come on down here and get born again you don't know but what it may take months for that person to get things out of their life and get situations straight now where the Lord can even deal with them in the right way and I've got to where anymore that when I make an altar call I don't try to make it absolute I say to them come get a start come get it start start out somewhere start out serving the Lord start out getting your faith right get some things you know moved around we try to shortcut it well glory to God you come down here I'm gonna lay my hands on you and I'm gonna pray for you and the moment I touch you that things going to disappear maybe not maybe not there might be things and there are things let me just say it this way there are things attached to our trials that are for our character development I I know that's that's a cheap way out of it that's a cheap way out of it I know that's a but that's easy to say sure but we're going by the Bible now the Bible tells us that all these things are working together for the good of them that love God you believe it say Amen yes absolutely they work together for the good of them that love the Lord so there's no shortcuts in this now when Joshua kind of coming on down in the message now and when Joshua was told now to arise and go over this Jordan I'm looking back again Joshua 1 and verse 2 and now when Moses my servant now is declared dead he tells them to rise and go over now if you'll watch there God tells him in verse 2 as we've read it many times as Bible readers he's going to give him the land but look there in verses three four and five the second he promises them that land there's Hittites Jebusites and all kinds of other I'd sitting right in it now it looked like if God wanted to make this easy for them just take a big broom and sweep all that trouble out of there and that way the people go in and get to land that's the shortcut you you understand what fast food is right fast food is the ability to get your car and get it drive down to a drive-through and have a hamburger and a french fry in a matter of about ten minutes rather than get the meat out make some good pork in there with its shape at hamburger and season it up well you done halfway through your burger from a drive-thru by the time you get rid the burgers ready to grill drive-throughs are essentially a shortcut to cook it I don't I don't doubt that every now and then a shortcut needs to be taken believe me when I tell you when I'm on the road the last thing I want to do is have to pull over the side of the road get my grill out of the back of my car and and try to cook it up I kind of enjoy McDonald's drive-through in those situations so we can't take shortcuts well you're the bride you're the bride you're the bride yes but if you are the bride there's no shortcuts to your manifestation you are going to have to fight the battles you are going to have to go through the hard times you are going to have to face adversity because remember what we said in Galatians love is a contrast to hatred faith is a contrast to doubt joy is a contrast to all these other things there's a direct opposite that has to be manifested out of your heart to fight that other side so these aren't things that just and then there it is that's right you should be a much better Christian than what I am you can't be any more than what God has allowed you to grow to this very point right here and even in revelation and understanding of the Word of God something I want you to keep in your mind friends is as you're learning and growing and developing as a Christian always remember that no matter how many scriptures you read of a day no matter how much of the Bible you read or how much of the message you listen to no matter how much you press to understand it if God is not ready to reveal it to you it'll set right there on that shelf until God stands ready to say okay now you can see it see there's no shortcuts to it we get the cart before the horse and we get to get it all mixed up and and the fact of the matter is there may be things that God is placing within our lives that will lead up to that climax but we have to go through these other little things in order to get there to it see and then in verse 5 he tells them there should not be any man able to stand before thee all the days of thy life but that's up to you that's on conditions because when you look at this Joshua and then they lost some battles remember one akin stole the wedge of gold in the garment Babylonian garment all that and they lost man I said they lost battles but they was able to win ultimately because they didn't take the shortcut and they stayed right with what God told him to do and man is always wanting his shortcuts Elijah's garments manifested sons of God and now today the shortcut is oh we believe the message oh we believe the prophet oh we're the bride we're the bride were the elect we're the bride that's true but that's like standing there that tomato plant and screaming you're a tomato you're a tomato you're tomato yes but I must feed it I must allow it to grow until it can manifest what's on the inside of it now brother Bram called that nonsense to say you're born again tonight manifest the Son of God tomorrow nonsense where do you get that in the word now let's look at the overcoming promise for a little bit Revelation chapter 2 and verse 7 and want to look just a moment at what the overcomer is now I'm gonna start digging into some reading here for just a little bit and and and I'm not even looking at the clock and I'm not gonna go pay attention to it and and if you're smart you shouldn't either because you just get discouraged if you think I'm going too long amen amen but I'm just going to go on anyhow and and and now let's pick up revolution 2 & 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God alright now in the ephesian church age now this is not the church age book but the ephesian church age message is pretty good up to 39 brother BAM said now look friends here's the way you overcome first you have to overcome then you can eat the fruit simple isn't it is that's pretty easy but how hard is it to get that sunk deep into your heart when it comes to this preaching we're over comers we're the bride we're gonna we we've got promises oh gods give us great promises uh-huh he has every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse leave a line that's true that's true come on now church that's true but there's no shortcuts to get them there's no shortcuts to receive it they're all right listen close to my words there is going to be a fight sure there is there's got to be overcoming before there can be eating that's laying right there in the scripture all right so what do we do with a lot of the preaching we hear you can cast out devils you can raise the dead you can speak the word you we know that like we read in Galatians chapter 5 you'll have love you'll have faith you'll have patience you have all these other things that's true but there is a process that will take you there now what troubles me so much when I hear a lot of the preaching going on now is it is it seems like seemingly ministers have focused on the eating of the Tree of Life and they're not focused on okay how do I overcome to get there and brother this is the kind of preaching that we need to get us ready to eat in the Tree of Life I love to hear somebody encourage me and tell me I'm an overcomer I'm a Victor nothing could stand before me just like Joshua he said no man can stand before you but don't forget before he said that in verse five he tells him in verse four the land is full of Hittites same parallel right here in Joshua's shown right up in Revelation you've got to overcome first before you can eat of the Tree of Life now what we need help with is the overcoming part all right let's be a little bit plain for a moment you look at people in this day and age that claim the message of the other claim they believe this property to claim they believe it's truth they struggle with drugs and I don't mean like heroin and things like that they struggle with recreational drugs they're hipped up on uppers and downers and left errs and riders and enters and outers they're depressed 90% of their days huh come on somebody talk to me huh they struggle with this they struggle with that they struggle with the other but now it'd be easy as a preacher and y'all might like me a little bit better I guess maybe if I jumped on here and said you're the bride glory going to rapture glory hallelujah well you'd be shot your shoe heels off but the minute you walked out them back doors back there and you got yourself in that old world out there I'm the bride okay how do I love that guy who hates me how do I pray for that one that's despitefully using me you see it's wonderful to preach the Tree of Life but we've got to understand how do I overcome you understand us that title brother branham's message how can i overcome how how do i do it you wanted the people to understand it now Revelation chapter 2 verse 11 all right he's a half an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death well what about the first one let me Alden you want to look up from your Bible you heard me going I don't make eye contact maybe here to notice that got me he shall not be hurt of the second death well what about the person what about them Christians being hung out there on the gun burn at the stake covered in oil fed to lions never promise that about the first I said the second death wouldn't hurt you but what about the first one see to handle to him that overcometh will I give to eat of hidden manna see and I'll give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it all right now you you recognize that this hidden manna comes to those that overcome it now remember the white stone was taken they seemed to think they seemed to think that the that the white stone is I just try to simplify this but the Romans would pass that to another one as a symbol of victory after the battle was over with they take a white stone and often put a name on that stone of the one that they had overcome some kind of victorious name would be wrote upon that stone and they would keep it almost as a memento or a memorial of the battle now again proving that the battle alright then verse 26 now revelation 2:26 he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's oh so we're gonna have power over the nation's huh but the nation's have got to be out of control before you can have power over them sit him Sam Revelation chapter 3 verse 5 he that overcometh chapter 3 and 5 the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my angels and before my father see he'll be clothed alright revelation 3:12 he that overcometh will I make him a pillar and the temple of my god and he shall go no more out I will write upon him the name of my god in the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name all right now verse 21 3 and 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne all right now all of these promises all of these promises that they represent the inheritance of the believer so for you and I in this last age every one of these overcoming promises we read are going to be given to you and I every single one of them we won't lack in any of these blessings but notice in every single verse who was the promise to to him that overcometh so no shortcuts you got to go straight through and cut through now revelation 21 and 7 all right if I'm moving too fast just write them down and and catch them because III know sometimes I move a little quick and I don't mean to but that's Pentecost makes me move that quick Amen Alleluia that Holy Ghost is it surges right revelation 21:7 he that overcometh shall inherit what all things that's right and I'll be his God and he shall be my son now in all things that we inherit remember the message hidden light been said now only believers only the elect comes into that God have chosen you he said revelation 2 he that overcometh its promise to overcomers alright now listen close he said you said I overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about there's a whole lot more that goes to Christianity besides not smoking cigarettes or drinking whiskey he that overcometh shall inherit all things and he's reading from revelation 21 we read through there he said he will be my son I will be his God and he said listen I will give him a hidden manna I'll hide him away I'll give him the hit part made the hidden things of the world of the outside curtain that they don't know nothing about hallelujah he says though they eat manna but they don't know nothing about this I'll give them the hidden manna give him a stone with the name in it you said you get what I mean entering into the adoption or the hidden place with God amen so it's more than just saying well I controlled my temper a little bit I guess I'm doing pretty good no in order for Joshua and them to inherit everything God said they had to fully displace every hittite III there was out all circled out through those lands they had to displace dis possess every single one of them in order for them to go in there and get the full inheritance they had to run everyone I'm out well you know I got saved and I quit listening at worldly music good for you but there's no shortcuts to this you cannot jump from that all the way to manifest as sons of God you got to keep growing look at all these promises we got to grow into hidden manon white stones white raiment he's writing his name upon us the name of the city of my god being his son all of that has got to be manifested in the child entering into the adoption or that hidden place with God so in order to come into that there has to be a lot of work that goes in to manifest in that Christian way now in adoption for the remm said here in part 1 now Canaan does not represent the age of the millennium it only represents the age of the overcomer the dispensation of overcoming because in Canaan they killed they burned and they took cities now you'll notice that God told Joshua arise and go over this Jordan remember that all right now do you realize that in April which is about we're just a little bit past April now but during that time Jordan was 5 times its normal size that brother brems says here it looked like any good military leader would have known different than that and at that time there was no possibility of being able to cross that Jordan but remember God was there opening up the Red Sea with Moses and he said as I was with Moses I'll be there with you he calls upon God with great power God comes down and in their present crisis he opened up Jordan and they crossed over all right I remember Jordan in the month of April when the hills of snow was melting up in Judea up on that mountain up there Mount Hermon and so forth its icy snow water gushing through that muddy twisting river down there see that water coming down the mighty general Joshua and when Jehovah moved back they said that powder dry land glory walked him right across it in the month of April all right now remember the type here is Jordan representing death but represents separation that's where the believer must come he must first recognize that he's a sinner now taste some in our message churches we need a little bit of that kind of preaching going on amongst our pews because being born and the message has nothing to do with whether you got saved or not you got to get saved first you got to recognize you're a sinner and you need a Savior I noticed in Sister Jennison I'm so happy to see her still going for the Lord and a man and got a Bible in our lap just so happy about that see that's what salvation does for a person nobody has to lay hands on your shake you this way or grab your job makes a hallelujah speak in tongues just get saved and watch the Holy Ghost take over from there he knows how to do all this we just have to be obedient to it and God blessed his sister Jen I'm so happy to see the Lord moving in your life that and and and grateful that God's got some young people that can really represent Christ in this terrible age this terrible age and he made you redheaded that's good that's a good thing that little fire fire the Holy Ghost - there - amen how do you amen they go have to be some redheads in the rapture brother em said so he said to be redheads brown heads and whatever force there had to be some redheads there that's right alright so come down to Jordan the washing of the water the separation of the water by the blood all right being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to omit him or permit him into the journey see but now remember the Jordan River now I'm giving you just a little bit of what this is all about now the Jordan River is a source of fertility all right upon a large plane called kick origin which is a little spot right in through there with its like called the Garden of God right in that area where they have real luxurious big beautiful vegetation growing out there all right but in Genesis now the Bible just kind of gives scattered references to about this Jordan but now Jacob crossed the Jordan and it's tributary in order to reach her on that's in Genesis 32 and it is noted as the line of demarcation between the two-and-a-half tribes that was settled to the east there and numbers 34 15 all right in the ninth ribes in the half Manasseh the tribe Manasseh that led Joshua was settled to the west that's Joshua 13 and now in Bible history Jordan appears as a scene for several miracles the first taking place Jordan near Jericho when the Israelites under Joshua this is Joshua 3 15 through 17 and then the later of the two-and-a-half tribes settled east of Jordan and built a large altar on its banks as a witness now watch this now as a witness between them and them other tribes remember they piled up stones Jordan was also the spot that Elijah and Elijah crossed over on dry ground so even Elijah to perform that other miracle and it's also the spot when the axe head floated in the water were the children of the prophets threw that piece of wood in the water and so forth amen and the axe had floated right there in Jordan alright the Jordan was also cross the scene of a battle in which representing death representing separation is seen in many battles okay now now now you you take this type alright just just pull this all together in your mind and you realize that God in the very beginning they're just getting started and God places them up against an absolute impossibility now friends they're not even ready for this they've not been trained how to cross tributaries they have not been trained and how to fuel it across these places all they've got is a little experience in a little faith and just a little let me just put it that way just a little that's all they've got and now here's the great mighty general Joshua stand after this River could coursing down tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of gallons of water coming down right in front of Moore he go and do hell I don't know well I know what Moses would do if he was here then Joshua Milo oh but as I was with Moses so he said he'd be with me now you see what I'm trying to show you friends is the Jordan River was a scene where many great miracles took place and this little spot right here God took his children right to that river again and again and again and again well I hope you get what I'm saying we won't just experience a Jordan just one time in our life and go Kru thank god that's over with you may have to repeat it again and again and again if you want to say this way generations of your life you may have to come right back up against this you may have an axe head experience you may have an elijan elijah elijah knowledge experience you may have Jacob crossing with this tributary of trust in the tributary with this group you might have all these different experiences they just keep wrapping around again and again and again and again and again how many times does the sunlight in the water rain down and beat down on that flower before it starts manifesting again and again and again and again all right then here in 1st Corinthians chapter 10 it said they were baptized under the Red Sea they were baptized under the Red Sea which Moses means drawn out his very name drawn out now then and that's Exodus chapter 2 verse 10 if you'd like to look at that where the child brought unto Pharaoh's daughter and became her son she called him Moses because I drew him out of the water and then he said they were baptized under that Red Sea all right now from the time they left Egypt going through the Red Sea now they go into the wilderness and there's a 40-year journey there and from forty years they come to the river and as they come to the river now they've got to cross over and Moses dies and maybe somebody might have said we ain't never going to make it you know and Moses got aggravated Adam don't you remember the story whenever they was going through the wilderness and you know how it is with kids in the car are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet are we there yet that's pretty much the way they've done Moses for about 40 years every time I'm sure I'll be there yet they about run him crazy but they were baptized sure under the Red Sea they were baptized what I've been baptized praise the Lord but remember there's going to be many more stages that's going to come to this adoption you cannot take the shortcut you must cross Jordan some things are going to go away some things are going to remain in other words Moses could type out in many different ways in our own life Moses could be a direct type of the help that God would allow us to have for a season you realize the Lord allows little helps and things in our life till we get strong enough to fight the battle ourselves we get discoursing I think in our mind well ten years ago when I was serving the Lord boy people prayed for me and I had friends I had this now I got nothing Moses my servant is dead now it's time for you to stand on your own two feet now it's time for you to go not depending upon the prayers of a Moses or somebody else like that to get you out of trouble when you get in it now God's gonna make you face the issue Alleluia oh you're getting quiet and they got nothing to do it being long-winded you just I know I'm writing the Tator patch that's right see all right now he tells us added option part one again is forgot forty-six he said now believers Caleb and that Caleb and Joshua outfit going on to the promised they moved over into the land took the land settled down in the land as a possession we never stopped at justification we never stopped at sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing on the Lord Jesus being baptized let's not stop at that because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we pressed on into a position to the promise of the baptism of the Holy Spirit for this promise unto you them that are far off all right so the impressing on not just being cleaned up by the Holy Spirit but pressing on until when we come into our true position with Jesus Christ now let me skip for just a little bit and I'm coming to the end now and and and praise the Lord and hallelujah thank you Jesus for all of these great notes but if I if I try to go through every little scripture I got down here you'd be here this time tomorrow and and and and I don't know if Skype will let us stay on here this long in fact they might start charging this room and board if we keep this up for a little while I think all right now remember when Jesus calls his disciples let me just hit the highlight of this and then let's quit all right if when Jesus calls his disciples don't forget many of them didn't know what their position was how many remembers that Matthew was a tax collector now Peter was a fisherman all right and even afterwards even after Jesus calls Simon Peter the swatching with a second that Jesus is gone the moment Jesus is gone you know him and John rest I'm done they said I go fishing they didn't even recognize their position I mind you Jesus had already told Simon Peter I've give you the keys there he's standing with the keys to open up heaven close heaven he's got the keys in his hand to offer the baptism of the Holy Ghost to anybody that wanted it as many as the Lord our God shall call Jesus goes off to see him what Pete well I got let's go fishing what do you want to do pee I don't know I hear they're bitin pretty good down there on the Sea of Galilee they didn't recognize her position but I remember Jesus had already renamed him Simon son of Jonas I call you Petra Peter which is a little stone he had already positioned him remember the sons of thunder called him banan juries some of these people these disciples were the very ones that in the beginning never recognized their potential even though Jesus had placed him and positioned them and gave it to him how did Peter ever get to the spot to preach acts 2 and 38 he had to deny the Lord he had to be a cussin preacher he had to weep bitterly he had to go hide himself in shame he had to sit in the upper room scared to death they're gonna drag him off to prison he went through that whole process now all of a sudden they're sitting there reading their Bible maybe and he comes across Joel's prophecy this is that and with him he's in his hand he sticks the key in the lock opens it up and he realizes oh I got it now Holy Ghost comes at once this is that that was promised for this promise is unto you to your children as many as the Lord our God shall call it was a process but even Peter himself was the one that said in other words let me paraphrase it we love Paul but sometimes Paul is hard to understand now what I'm trying to show you friends is what brother Bram is teaching us what the Bible teaches us there's no shortcuts in this and don't shortchange yourself to say oh I'm a believer sure you are but take your time allow the Holy Spirit to develop things in you don't get it that's a hurry to be a manifested son of God this is the way you should pray Lord let me be ready for the things I need to be ready for and let me make myself ready for the things that you want to make me ready for because if we get in a big push and we're trying to push past something we're get in trouble no shortcuts through this we have to go the long hard road and it is it's challenging it's a hard way sometimes but if God be for us who can be against us all right standing your feet with me god bless you you've been patient you've been lovely you've been wonderful and I didn't preach too long now from start to finish it says two hours 27 minutes which means including the half hour silence I only kept you from start to finish about maybe an hour and a half give or take something like that all right you ain't gonna die you're still living everybody put your hands on your pulse you'll feel your heart is still beating a man it's still there all right you're in good shape now and and if your heart is still beating then that means you've got an opportunity to come a little higher move a little further I love you friends god bless you let's pray together can we Lord Jesus with the many knees that's no doubt associated with this little audience of people those that are visible those that are invisible I would be foolish to say within myself God come down and do supernatural great things we want that Lord but the longer I serve you the more I realize that things have to work according to your plan and your will and Lord Jesus if things just aren't associated with your plan if there's other reasons behind things we don't want to rush it Lord the second we get into trouble our instinct is get out of the trouble Lord sometimes you just let us sit right there because we have to learn we have to grow we have to develop from the things that we go through the Father I pray for your children strengthen every one of them give them your confidence your courage give them faith in their heart to stand there on the promise of God and grow until everything begins coming together just like I said they're about Jordan Lord we have to cross this area many times in our life again and again and again the Lord Jesus may the Holy Spirit take us in your great care wrap your great arms around us and make us one with thy Holy Spirit hallelujah that we might be able to step forward in march forward in the newness of life bless everyone visible and invisible may the Holy Ghost heal bodies touch minds encourage the discouraged save the lost do great things bring and restore the backslider every what it might be Lord may the Holy Ghost bless blessing and and move on the lives of your children we love them Lord we

the ministry of her brother being the ministry of the word and beneath your brothers sister that if the revelations that we need it the revelation that amen that that you need that i need that that the bride needs whether it's you here in this assembly or those at home so we give God the glory for our brother band he's been a blessing in the past he's been a blessing today and we believe the Lord to the Lord I receive a blessing to us again in the future so the invitation is there for our brother band to still come and to fellowship with us we would be wonderful if we could go to brother Bob's or paula marks and have fellowship with brother bin today a man but we look forward to that again the Lord willing and if the Lord tarries when it comes to the resurrection and the rapture so we thank the Lord for the further revelation of the word again I trust by grace that what God has brought brought us through our brother bin will put us on our toes amen to make our calling and election sure and to do it God's Way amen now I know that if I could I got three or four pages of notes here I could go on for another hour and a half or two hours but I won't do that so we think I was trusting that our brother bed would go on for at least another hour and I wasn't conscious of the time I just felt you know go on and on and on and on so god bless your brother Ben and we look forward to hearing your ministry again maybe the next time dude you'll be in the pulpit not brother journal so the Lord will bless you and our sisters Samantha yes Samantha god bless you for your singing as well so to God be the glory and again I appreciated the ministry on Friday Saturday Sunday and I felt it was a confirmation of many things that I've already preached a man a confirmation of many things that I have I have I lighted when it comes to not just coming in and saying I'm a believer again what is the prophecy the Prophet said he said oh you say you're really your believer you're in the message yes he said what the message is not in you and he was saying that to his two believers in his own church that's the truth and rather we can say that to a lot of believers around the message today they're in the message but the message is not in them they may it and we could to prove it we could go back to what our brother being ministered on that his last three services amen let's just make her call the election shortlist let's take it serious what God has brought us through our brother amen you will live when you're gonna make your call and election short base it on what you heard today racing on what you heard from our brother man these last three services Amen praise the Lord thank God he wasn't there just to say oh you're a believer so don't worry you're going into the rapture no no a man he was bringing out the word and what God is going to require of his sons and daughters amen where God is going to expect to be sons and daughters and again as the prophet of god has said he said the daily christ's are waiting on us they veil what are they waiting for for us to come through the revelation of who we are and he said God is waiting on us don't we don't go he's waiting on you praise the name of the Lord and brother it's been a long time now and God has been trading us amen God has been teaching us encouraging us a man to come to the position of sonship amen so that oh it's like like the folks or maybe it used to be on the Pope on the out there in the in the porch and it said that your name on the check is just as good as this amen amen amen why because we got the same authority because we are the sons and daughters of God by the grace of God amen so the devil the devil knows it as he said the devil is religious and we believe I've highlighted that a number of times in the service that God has laid on our hearts here so again thank the Lord for the word because we are sons a man and daughters please in the name of Jesus don't ignore your your position don't ignore what you are a new you are we got to have that faith amen oh definitely you're going to talk to the Lord you're going to talk to your father is it be old what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us now we thought why because now we got the revelation of father father father a man a man don't think about your natural father or your natural mother thing with your spiritual one but the natural passes away but the spiritual goes on to eternity praise the name of the Lord so God blesses a man will turn it to brother bow but let's sing the song o come and go with me to my father's house and God bless our sister Ida avancez the seer and again it was it's a blessing to have her with us and it was a blessing for us a couple of days ago to meet with our sister Kordell a man oh yeah we it was wonderful we were in the in the car outside the driveway as she was in the driveway he met just the middle of the driveway talking to us a man it was wonderful so god bless sister Cardella and also to say that our brother john Kadesh i feel that he has moved to quebec and his new address is Quebec but he's very close wherever it is in Quebec is very close to Ottawa apparently I think that's where he works and what things are going on and with regards to his education I'm not sure I'm waiting to hear from him again but he yesterday he said his greetings to all the Saints here and he expresses its appreciation for the brother Ben's ministry a man and because apparently he must but areas online and it was a real blessing to him a man so let's keep our brother John in prayer amen again to those who are not familiar he's originally of course from from the Congo and his father is a pastor in the Congo so we pray the grace of God to here we pray the grace of God to his father a man and of course greetings also from brother Leo from Uganda as he we remember brother Leo that he ministered for us here and we and we were blessed amen but yesterday sent an email to send these to the Saints here and He loves us he said and even any-any he was blessed by our fellowship and also brother Jacob Jonah from Ghana he says his Greece for the Saints again because they're having a hard time said there as we are here a man and apparently they're not they're not allowed to I don't think to meet as a poor Church the same as we're not allowed to meet here they're under the same rules the same regulations and so on and again as the things are closed their things are closed here and so on but again I pray grace don't let it affect your faith keep pressing on by the grace of God so God bless our brother Jonah and God bless our brother Leo amen so receive their greetings in the name of the Lord Christ and keep them in prayer amen so let's say he'll come and go with me to my father's house and we're going to turn to our brother Bob praise the name of the Lord God bless brother bit amen and I'm sure the Lord will keep using his ministry for the bride amen oh come and go with me - my father's out to my father's where there's be King Jesus will be [Music] please [Music] there [Music] [Applause] [Music] there'll be nobody [Music]
