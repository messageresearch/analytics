[15:42] Your word says, Lord, the more we give,
[15:45] the more we receive.
[15:48] So grace told us, Lord, abandon
[15:49] ourselves into your hands, Lord.
[15:52] And Lord, if you cannot have control,
[15:54] Lord, in this fault, Lord, we're not
[15:56] giving it to you.
[15:58] So help us, Lord, to surrender, Lord,
[16:00] unto thee that you may have control.
[16:04] Bless you Lord is a holy calling you're
[16:06] given us Lord.

[17:50] you. We want to better ourselves, Lord.
[17:53] Your word says your bra makes herself
[17:55] ready, but Lord, she needs your word to

[34:27] Lord, you revealed yourself in old times
[34:30] as Jehovah
[34:31] as I am. But Lord, you came now in a
[34:36] time of flesh and you said, "I'm God
[34:37] with you,
[34:40] Lord." And then you said, "I'll never
[34:41] leave you and I'll never forsake you.
[34:42] I'll be with you. I'll even be in you to
[34:45] the end of the age, Lord." And that's
[34:46] our comfort this evening, Lord. It's our
[34:49] rest. It's our strength. It's our joy.
[34:50] It's our peace. It's our everything.
[34:52] It's our all in all, Heavenly Father, is
[34:54] that you are with us, Lord. Not by
[34:56] anything we've done, not by anything we
[34:58] can lay hold of or claim of ourselves,
[35:00] Lord, but it's by your covenant one-way
[35:02] promise, Lord, that you said, "I will be
[35:04] with you. I have chosen you. I have
[35:06] elected you. You are my bride. You are
[35:09] spotless. You are perfect. You're
[35:11] justified, sanctified,
[35:14] and I'm living in you. You're my temple
[35:16] now, Lord. What a rest we have this
[35:18] morning, Lord, because of your goodness
[35:20] to us, Lord, because of your inddwelling
[35:22] spirit, Lord God. Lord, I pray you help
[35:25] us to catch a little greater vision.
[35:27] Lord, open our eyes a little more
[35:28] tonight, Lord, to what that means in our
[35:30] lives, Lord. That we'd not just say,
[35:32] "I'm a child of God," or, "I'm filled
[35:34] with the spirit of God." Lord, but that
[35:35] we'd understand what it means to take
[35:37] that and put it into action. Lord,
[35:39] quicken our faith, Lord. Raise it this
[35:41] evening. We pray, Lord, touch your
[35:43] people once again now. We ask in Jesus
[35:46] Christ's name we pray it. Amen. Amen.
[35:48] God bless you. Turn, if you would, to
[35:50] Joshua chapter 1. Joshua chapter 1.

[36:04] Amen. Remember Jensen? I don't know if
[36:06] it was mentioned, but uh he's home with
[36:08] a fever tonight. He's been struggling
[36:09] for the last few days and just
[36:11] struggling to regulate his temperature.
[36:13] So, we've just got him home watching the
[36:15] service tonight. So, praying God's grace
[36:17] to be with him. Amen. I'm stepping into
[36:20] the shoes of Brother Paul Lafontaine
[36:22] here. This was his uh his scripture that
[36:25] he read when he came here the the first
[36:28] time. But it's such a wonderful
[36:29] scripture and we're going to preach out
[36:30] of here this evening. Amen. It says,
[36:33] "Now after the death of Moses, the
[36:34] servant of the Lord, it came to pass
[36:36] that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[36:38] of Nun, Moses minister, saying, Moses,
[36:42] my servant is dead. Now therefore arise,
[36:45] go over this Jordan, thou and all this
[36:47] people unto the land which I do give to
[36:49] them, even to the children of Israel.
[36:52] Notice now he's speaking to a man. But
[36:54] the message is for who? The children of
[36:57] the promise. He says, "Every place that
[36:59] the soul of your foot shall tread upon,
[37:01] that have I given unto you, as I said
[37:04] unto Moses." And then he says, "It's
[37:06] from the wilderness of this Lebanon,
[37:08] even under the great river, the river
[37:10] Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,
[37:12] and under the great sea toward the going
[37:14] down of the sun shall be your coast.
[37:17] There shall not any man be able to stand
[37:19] before thee all the days of thy life. As
[37:22] I was with Moses, so I will be with
[37:25] thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake
[37:28] thee." Amen. God bless you. You can have
[37:29] your seats this evening. Amen. What a
[37:32] wonderful scripture to open with. And I
[37:33] want to continue this thought. We've
[37:35] been taking on absolute power.
[37:38] Excuse me. Been dealing with allergies
[37:40] and it usually sticks for about a month.
[37:42] So I'm just struggling a bit with my
[37:44] nose and my throat and my eyes a bit.
[37:45] But I want to take this thought on
[37:46] absolute power. And last service we
[37:48] preached on a commission. And I want to
[37:50] take that a little further this evening
[37:52] again on the the the thought of
[37:54] recognizing and accepting our
[37:56] commission. And last service we spoke
[37:57] about Moses a lot. And Moses was a God
[38:00] prophet. Remember Moses was was really
[38:03] the type of Christ that was coming
[38:04] because God the scripture said, "I'll
[38:06] raise up unto you a prophet like unto
[38:08] Moses." Moses was the God prophet.
[38:10] Remember what happened was the people
[38:12] came to Sinai and God tried to reveal
[38:14] himself. God tried to start a
[38:15] relationship with them and he just
[38:17] scared them. And they said, "Moses, we
[38:19] don't want to talk to God. You talk to
[38:20] God and then you can come to us and tell
[38:23] us what we what we need to hear." And so
[38:25] God said, "Moses, listen. They don't
[38:26] want a relationship with me. So I'm
[38:28] going to speak to you and then you speak
[38:29] to Aaron. You can be God to the people.
[38:31] You speak to Aaron. Aaron will be your
[38:33] prophet and then he'll relay it to them.
[38:36] And brother Ram said that that that that
[38:38] was a thing that God could not look past
[38:40] for the rest of their lives. This thing
[38:43] that they came and they turned him down
[38:44] and they took the law. They turned down
[38:46] grace and they said, "You go get a law
[38:48] for us, Moses. We won't let you lead us
[38:50] and guide us." Because remember, when
[38:51] you look at Abraham, Abraham was not
[38:53] under law. Abraham was under the
[38:54] leadership of God. He was under the
[38:56] covenant of God. It was a one-sided
[38:57] promise. And they turned down that
[38:59] one-sided covenant and they said, "We'll
[39:01] take the law and said instead and it led
[39:03] them to their death and their
[39:04] destruction." We see that. Amen. But we
[39:06] notice once they said, "God, you got to
[39:08] use a prophet." God never changed the
[39:09] pattern. And ever since then, when it
[39:11] comes to junctions of time, when it
[39:13] comes to a people that need to return to
[39:14] God, when it comes to people that need
[39:16] to turn a corner, God always has a man
[39:18] available. God always has somebody
[39:20] available to help the people. And
[39:22] sometimes it's just to get them back to
[39:23] God. So many times that's what the
[39:25] prophets did. And that's why they killed
[39:26] them was because they told the people,
[39:28] "You got to change." And the people
[39:29] didn't want to change. And they killed
[39:31] those men. Amen. But the the point of a
[39:33] prophet, the point of a messenger is not
[39:35] just to be a messenger. The messenger is
[39:38] not there for the sake of the speaker,
[39:39] but he's there for the sake of the
[39:41] hearer. Amen. The the prophet is there
[39:43] to bring something to the people, for
[39:45] the people. It is not just to hear the
[39:48] sound of his voice. It's not just so he
[39:49] can puff up his chest and say, "Look at
[39:51] me. I'm the mighty man of God. I'm a
[39:53] prophet. I speak lift here with God."
[39:55] That's not his purpose. His prop pro his
[39:57] his purpose is to come to a people and
[39:59] give them something that's meant for
[40:01] them. And it's for their benefit if
[40:03] they'll receive it. And it's for their
[40:04] judgment if they'll turn it down. Amen.
[40:06] So Noah's message was not for Noah,
[40:09] though he had to receive it. But it was
[40:11] meant for everybody else. The problem is
[40:13] only seven other people received it. And
[40:15] what did they receive? They received
[40:16] life. Moses' message wasn't for him.
[40:18] Moses was already out of Egypt,
[40:21] but he went back to a place he had been
[40:23] exiled from. and that he was in danger
[40:25] of going back to of losing his life. And
[40:27] he went back why? To bring a message to
[40:29] the people that they were going to be
[40:31] delivered out of Egypt, that God was
[40:33] going to finally do what his word said
[40:35] was going to do. Amen. God sent them a
[40:37] messenger for their benefit. Why do we
[40:40] have a messenger in this age? The
[40:42] scripture says, "Behold, I said unto
[40:43] who? You." There's got to be a you to
[40:46] receive Elijah the prophet to receive
[40:49] the benefit of that message. And so
[40:51] Moses came with a message for the
[40:53] benefit of the people. Let me put it
[40:55] this way. I'm not here for me tonight.
[40:57] I'm here for you. I get benefit from it.
[40:59] I'm I believe the message that I'm
[41:01] preaching tonight. But the reason I
[41:03] labor and study and pray and wait on the
[41:05] Lord is for your benefit because the
[41:08] point of the foolishness of preaching is
[41:10] to get you to unify with the word. Is to
[41:13] get you to a place where what we're
[41:14] talking about becomes a part of you and
[41:16] you can get the reality of it. That's
[41:19] why we come to church. It's definitely
[41:20] not to hear me. You'd be of all people
[41:23] most miserable if you just came to hear
[41:24] me cuz I'm not much of a speaker. But if
[41:27] you can catch what's being spoken by the
[41:29] spirit of God, it'll change your life.
[41:31] It'll change your situation. It'll
[41:33] change your body. It'll change your
[41:34] attitude. It'll change your family.
[41:36] It'll change your marriage. It'll change
[41:38] your home if you can catch it. Because
[41:39] it's meant to come in and become a part
[41:41] of you. It's meant to quicken what was
[41:44] always in there from the start and
[41:45] overcome that which was not supposed to
[41:47] be there in your body, in your mind, in
[41:49] your spirit. Amen. So Moses came down
[41:52] and he had a a message for them. God
[41:54] gave Moses a commission to take them out
[41:56] of Egypt to take them to the mountain to
[41:58] serve God and then from there to go into
[42:00] the land of Canaan. Remember as they
[42:02] came to Canaan, they were still under a
[42:04] message of grace. It was God's grace
[42:06] that sustained them. It was God's grace
[42:08] that kept them. It was God's mercy. It
[42:10] was God's provision. They had mana every
[42:12] day. They had water when they needed it.
[42:14] Their clothes didn't wear out. Their
[42:16] shoes didn't wear out. They were in good
[42:17] health. It was all under a message of
[42:20] grace. But when they came to Canaan,
[42:22] grace was supposed to turn into faith.
[42:25] All that they had experienced under
[42:27] grace was supposed to raise their faith
[42:29] so that when God said, "It's time to
[42:31] take what I've been talking about,"
[42:32] they'd say, "Lord, you're with us. We're
[42:34] good to go." But they didn't. They got
[42:36] caught up in the ease of grace and it
[42:39] didn't do anything in their souls
[42:40] because they were unbelievers. And there
[42:43] was only a couple that believed and
[42:45] those were the ones that God had to use.
[42:46] Amen. See, church, we've got to realize
[42:49] something. They had come out. And as
[42:51] hard as coming out is, it's still the
[42:53] easy part. It's still the easy part cuz
[42:57] a bunch of people came out with them. It
[42:59] was a mixed multitude, the scripture
[43:00] says, that came out of Egypt. As hard as
[43:03] it is, it's still the easiest part. But
[43:06] when it comes now to the journey, that's
[43:09] where people started losing. That's
[43:11] where people started falling by the way.
[43:14] Look at Dayathan and Kora. They fell by
[43:16] the way. They elevated themselves. They
[43:18] did all these things. And then when it
[43:20] came time to go into the land, that's
[43:22] where everybody but two people failed.
[43:25] Because when it's time to put your faith
[43:26] into action, that's when we find out, am
[43:28] I really a believer? Because the the the
[43:30] the identification of a believer is they
[43:33] have faith in God's word. you believe.
[43:35] You can't believe if you don't have
[43:36] faith. And so they came to a place now
[43:38] where their faith had to be put into
[43:40] action and they backed down. And we see
[43:42] that time and time again in scripture.
[43:44] People will go as far as it feels good.
[43:46] But the moment their life is on the
[43:48] line, their career is on the line, their
[43:50] finances are on the line, their health
[43:52] is on the line, their reputation's on
[43:53] the line, they say no more. And the
[43:56] minute we stop moving forward, we're
[43:57] dead. We're backsliding at best. We're
[44:01] backsliding at best because God keeps
[44:03] moving. And if we don't keep moving with
[44:05] him, we're falling behind. We've got to
[44:07] keep moving with him. We've got to keep
[44:09] walking with him. Abraham said this way.
[44:12] He says, "Ahab was a borderline
[44:14] believer. Just a fellow that believed
[44:16] enough to make him miserable." He says,
[44:20] "Did you ever see people like that?
[44:22] Well, they have a conception that they
[44:23] would like to go to church and do right.
[44:26] They feel like it would make them a
[44:27] better person in their social lives. And
[44:30] maybe for the sakes of their children,
[44:32] they think they ought to maybe belong to
[44:34] church. See, it's people that have an
[44:36] idea of the benefits of the gospel
[44:38] without a call in their heart to
[44:40] actually respond.
[44:42] Listen, there are people that come to
[44:44] church because they see your life and
[44:46] they say, "That's a good family life.
[44:48] That's a good good way of raising your
[44:50] children. I like the benefits." church.
[44:52] I've talked to people at work about this
[44:53] all across the country and they love
[44:55] what we're doing, but they don't like
[44:58] the way that it comes.
[45:00] But some of them have said and some of
[45:01] them have come to church here and in
[45:03] other places and they come once and or
[45:05] maybe twice and then what do they do?
[45:06] They walk away. It's not for me. But
[45:09] then you got people that linger
[45:12] because the church has turned into a
[45:15] community
[45:17] and we're literally here because of the
[45:18] benefits of community. Guess what? We
[45:21] have friends whether we want them or not
[45:23] because we go to church. We have options
[45:25] for good people to marry because we come
[45:27] to church. We have support when things
[45:30] go sideways. We have a baby. Then what
[45:32] do we have? We've got people that'll
[45:33] bring us food. We've got a wonderful
[45:35] community here. It's a great lifestyle.
[45:38] And lifestyle believers are the most
[45:40] miserable ones out there because they
[45:42] know there's more, but they never get
[45:44] there. They see there's more, but they
[45:47] never experience it. That's a borderline
[45:50] believer. He says, "If dad isn't the
[45:52] most miserable person I know of," he
[45:54] says, "I tell you that the best to do is
[45:57] cut loose all shorelines and launch out
[46:00] into the deep or don't go at all." He
[46:03] says, "Just simply stay home or go all
[46:06] the way for Christ." He says, "God wants
[46:09] somebody who will really go all the way.
[46:12] Give all you have, body, soul, and
[46:15] spirit, in the service of the Lord." I
[46:18] was reading on Monday in my devotions in
[46:19] Matthew 6 where Jesus said no man can
[46:21] serve two masters. He says either he'll
[46:24] love one and hate the other or he'll
[46:26] prioritize one over the other because
[46:27] you can't put two things in first place.
[46:29] It doesn't work. Somebody's got to be
[46:32] first. Amen. We can't be a halfway
[46:34] Christian. We can't serve God on Sundays
[46:36] and Wednesday nights and then the rest
[46:38] of the time we just do whatever we want.
[46:41] That's not the way this is going to
[46:42] work. That's not an overcomer.
[46:45] That's a wishywashy halfway compromised
[46:47] Christian is what that is. And that's a
[46:49] miserable place to be in because you're
[46:51] elevated when you come to church and
[46:53] then you walk out and you realize you
[46:54] don't have anything you just listen to.
[46:56] You feel wonderful in service maybe, but
[46:59] then you walk out and you lose the
[47:00] victory time and time again. Why?
[47:01] Because we're halfway.
[47:04] I hope I'm not preaching to anyone
[47:05] tonight.
[47:07] But if you are, there's a way to do it.
[47:09] Cut loose. Get rid of everything else
[47:11] and put Christ in the center of your
[47:13] life. That's the only way it's ever
[47:14] going to work. Amen. We've got to make
[47:16] up our mind at some point, church.
[47:17] Either we're a believer or we're not.
[47:19] Either we trust God or not. Either we
[47:21] want all that he has or we don't. I was
[47:24] listening to a brother the other day.
[47:26] This was hard.
[47:28] He said, he says, "If you're not living
[47:31] as if you're ready for the rapture," he
[47:33] says, "I doubt if you'll go in the
[47:34] rapture at all."
[47:37] I thought, "That's pretty hard." But the
[47:40] simple truth is if we're not growing
[47:42] continually, there's a problem. That's
[47:45] what he's pointing to. If we aren't
[47:46] laying more and more of the world aside,
[47:48] if we're not on our way to glory, why
[47:51] would we think that suddenly we're going
[47:52] to start going to glory? There's a path
[47:55] of holiness. There's a path of
[47:56] sanctification. There's a path of
[47:58] commitment that is in the life of a true
[48:00] believer. And if we're not walking it
[48:02] out, church, we better start getting
[48:03] going cuz I'm telling you, it's closer
[48:05] than you think. We're way further along
[48:08] than we think. It could happen tomorrow.
[48:10] We see what's happening with Israel,
[48:11] brother Bam. How many times do you say
[48:13] Israel is God's time peace and church,
[48:15] they are one event away from the entire
[48:18] world turning against them. The US is
[48:20] the only ally they have now. Canada, the
[48:22] UK, France has all turned against them
[48:24] now. The US is the only one that's
[48:26] backing Israel right now. Think of that.
[48:30] The last ally is about to turn their
[48:31] back on Israel. That's how close we are.
[48:35] I'm not trying to scare you. I'm telling
[48:36] you it's later than you think. It's
[48:38] later than we think. Amen.
[48:42] But what I'm trying to anchor this
[48:43] evening is the absolute power that comes
[48:46] with the commission. And it'll come from
[48:48] accepting it as an absolute. And we'll
[48:49] get into that perhaps, the Lord willing,
[48:51] on Sunday. But we spoke about Moses last
[48:53] service and Caleb last service. But I
[48:55] want to take us down the roads of a few
[48:57] other believers this evening before we
[48:59] get to Sunday's service. But I want to
[49:01] give you a spoiler alert. We have the
[49:02] greatest commission ever. We have the
[49:05] greatest commission ever. Because when
[49:06] you look when brother Brandham preached
[49:07] the church ages he say we get everything
[49:09] that they get plus
[49:12] which means we've got a portion of their
[49:13] commission in every one of those. But
[49:16] we've got one commission nobody else has
[49:17] ever had and that's that we get to take
[49:18] a rapture. Our commission is to overcome
[49:22] and death can't touch us. That's the
[49:24] kind of commission we have. It's a
[49:26] wonderful time to be a believer. It's a
[49:28] hard time to be a believer but it's a
[49:30] wonderful time to be a believer this
[49:32] evening. I'm so happy I'm a part of it.
[49:34] I'm so happy that I've received this
[49:35] message. Amen. But I want to come back
[49:37] to Joshua quickly because I want to see
[49:39] you to see how this plays out. Cuz I I'm
[49:42] not preaching Joshua for Joshua's sake.
[49:43] I'm preaching Joshua for our sake
[49:45] because I want to see how does Joshua
[49:46] relate to me. What does it do in my
[49:48] life? If I do what Joshua does then do I
[49:50] get Joshua's results. So let's go back
[49:52] to that opening scripture because
[49:54] remember Moses had the commission to
[49:56] take them in. Then Moses lost his temper
[49:58] and God said Moses because of that you
[49:59] can't go in but it's okay. Joshua will
[50:01] take them in instead. The plan of God
[50:03] doesn't stop because we make mistakes.
[50:06] God's always got a way to take us
[50:07] through. He says, "Now after the death
[50:10] of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it
[50:12] came to pass that the Lord spake unto
[50:13] Joshua, the son of Mo Nun, Moses'
[50:15] minister, saying, now catch this thing
[50:18] now because I think it bears saying here
[50:20] that before Joshua could lead, he had to
[50:23] serve."
[50:25] See, Joshua served Moses and Moses
[50:27] served the people. Before you can lead,
[50:29] you've got to serve. Because when you
[50:31] get into leadership, if you're doing it
[50:32] right, you'll realize that's greater
[50:34] service than all. Cuz I'm here for you.
[50:36] I'm not here for me. The ministry is
[50:38] here for you. That's what a minister is.
[50:40] It's a servant. And you cannot serve at
[50:42] the a as the chief of servants unless
[50:45] you first learn to serve. That's what
[50:48] Joshua had to do here. He served Moses
[50:50] before he led and served the people. But
[50:52] notice the Lord came to Joshua. He says,
[50:54] "Moses, my servant, is dead. Now
[50:56] therefore, arise and go over this
[50:58] Jordan." Moses died. And what did they
[50:59] do? They stopped and they mourned.
[51:02] And what did they do? They didn't move
[51:04] forward. Now Joshua is a good leader. He
[51:07] doesn't move until God tells him to. But
[51:09] when God says move, then Joshua starts
[51:11] to move. He says, "Go over this Jordan
[51:13] thou and all this people under the land
[51:15] which I do give to them, even to the
[51:17] children of Israel." Now notice the
[51:19] commission is not just for Joshua. The
[51:21] commission is for the people of the
[51:23] promise. That's what I want you to catch
[51:25] tonight. The commission is not just to
[51:27] the ministry. It's not just to the men.
[51:29] It's not just to the fathers. It's not
[51:31] just to the deacons. It's not just to
[51:33] the gifted. It's for every single person
[51:35] that is there to receive the promise.
[51:37] The commission is there to get you to
[51:39] your promise. Okay? He says this, "Every
[51:44] every place that the sole of your foot
[51:47] shall tread upon, that have I given unto
[51:49] you, as I said unto Moses." Every place
[51:52] that you can walk in the boundaries of
[51:55] God's word belongs to you. every
[51:59] and then he says
[52:01] where from the wilderness of this
[52:03] Lebanon even under the great river the
[52:05] river Euphrates all the land of the
[52:06] Hittites and under the great sea toward
[52:08] the going down of the sun shall be your
[52:10] coast. They had defined boundaries and
[52:12] they were not supposed to leave it. God
[52:15] did not say if you head back to Egypt
[52:16] I'll give it to you. No, you left that
[52:19] behind. That's not for you to go
[52:20] conquer. That's not your land. Stay in
[52:23] your land and anywhere in that land if
[52:24] you walk on it belongs to you. All you
[52:26] got to do is walk there.
[52:29] He says, "If you do that, there shall
[52:31] not any man be able to stand before thee
[52:33] all the days of thy life. As I was with
[52:36] Moses, so I will be with thee." He says,
[52:39] "I will not fail thee, nor forsake
[52:42] thee." We're into the absolutes again.
[52:44] And he says, "What? Every place."
[52:47] There's no ifs, there's no ands, there's
[52:49] no buts, there's no exceptions, church.
[52:51] If there's an exception, God will let
[52:52] you know like he did Paul. Otherwise,
[52:55] it's yours. Why would we believe healing
[52:58] is not for us? Why would we believe
[52:59] deliverance is not for us? Why would we
[53:01] believe leadership's not for us? Why
[53:03] would we believe gifts aren't for us?
[53:05] No, they're for you as a child of God.
[53:07] They're part of the redemptive blessings
[53:08] that he died at Calvary to give to you
[53:10] and I. And he didn't die on Calvary so
[53:13] that we could say, "I guess they're not
[53:14] for us." They're meant for us. They're
[53:16] meant for every single child of God.
[53:18] Remember, he didn't say, "Everywhere you
[53:20] walk will be flat, dry, easy.
[53:25] uninhabited.
[53:27] But he did say every place you walk
[53:28] belongs to you. God never said the
[53:31] condition was going to be easy. But he
[53:32] said, "If you can walk there, I'll give
[53:34] it to you. If you will walk there, then
[53:36] I'll give it to you." And then he
[53:38] addressed the 40-year-old question that
[53:40] had failed them so long ago was, "How
[53:42] are we going to defeat bigger than
[53:43] people that are bigger than us?" He
[53:45] said, "Listen, every He says, "There
[53:47] shall not any man.
[53:50] No one.
[53:52] There shall nobody can stand before you
[53:55] in this land." Cuz that's what caused
[53:57] them to back away before was they looked
[53:59] at the size of the people there and
[54:01] said, "There's no way we're going to be
[54:02] able to defeat them." God comes back and
[54:04] says, "I'm reminding you of the
[54:06] testimony of Joshua and Caleb. Joshua,
[54:08] I'm telling you what you said before,
[54:10] and I'm telling you it's true. You're
[54:12] able to go up. Don't look at the
[54:14] situation.
[54:17] Look at the promise. That's always what
[54:19] we're supposed to keep our eyes on,
[54:20] church, is the promise, not on ourselves
[54:22] because we fail day in and day out in
[54:24] and of ourselves. God's telling Joshua,
[54:27] Joshua, don't look at yourself, buddy.
[54:29] You're not going to do this. Cuz what
[54:32] does he say? He says, "Not any man shall
[54:35] be able to stand." That word says, "Set
[54:36] up a station to remain in position or to
[54:40] withstand you." He didn't say people
[54:41] weren't going to stand in front of you.
[54:43] He said they won't be able to stay
[54:45] there. Something comes up, you have a
[54:47] right to say you have to move because
[54:50] every Satan's job is to bluff you out.
[54:52] It's to stand in your way and get you to
[54:55] back around, get you to go around, get
[54:57] you to give up the position. But he
[54:59] says, listen, they're going to stand,
[55:00] but they won't be able to stay there if
[55:03] you'll just keep walking. They will have
[55:05] to run or they will have to fall. That's
[55:08] the way this is going to work. Joshua,
[55:09] amen. Listen, church. He never said they
[55:12] weren't going to present themselves. But
[55:13] he said he never said they weren't going
[55:14] to puff themselves up. Didn't say they
[55:16] weren't going to try and scare you.
[55:17] Didn't say they weren't going to try and
[55:19] harass you. Didn't say they weren't
[55:20] going to try and push you out of the
[55:21] way. But he says, "If you'll keep
[55:23] walking, they'll have to give way." See,
[55:25] too often we think resistance means it
[55:28] doesn't belong to us. We've got to stop
[55:29] thinking that that's outside of our
[55:31] rights. Church, when we face resistance,
[55:33] we've got to say, "Satan, not today.
[55:37] Not this daughter, not this son, not
[55:39] this place, not this time.
[55:42] Remember, it's not that we get to skip
[55:44] the trials, but he has no right to
[55:46] torment. He has no right for anxiety,
[55:50] for worry, for sleepless nights. That
[55:52] has to go. We've got to go through
[55:55] trials. They purify us. They they do
[55:57] more for us than we we could ever
[55:59] imagine. But we don't have to go through
[56:01] it with fear. We don't have to go
[56:03] through it losing our sleep, losing our
[56:05] hair, gaining weight. We don't have to
[56:08] go through it broken down where we come
[56:11] out the other side and we're barely
[56:12] alive. We can come through and say, "The
[56:15] Lord was with me. The Lord gave me
[56:17] peace. The Lord gave me rest. We don't
[56:20] have to lose sleep at night." Satan's a
[56:23] tormentor, and you got a right to say,
[56:25] "You can't torment me." Listen, you're
[56:27] here to do a job, but that job does not
[56:30] mean that I've got to lose my peace and
[56:32] my rest. Get thee behind me, Satan.
[56:35] Amen.
[56:37] Listen, God knows how to set our mind
[56:39] just where it needs to be. And he says,
[56:41] listen, no man can stand before you all
[56:43] the days of your life. Exactly as I was
[56:46] with Moses, I'll be with you.
[56:50] What a promise that is. That means I'll
[56:52] talk to you. I'll show you my way. I'll
[56:56] be with you. you. I'll take care of you.
[56:57] I'll feed you. I'll clothe you. I'll
[56:59] protect you. I'll give you victories.
[57:03] Everything that I did with Moses, I'll
[57:04] be with you. And then he didn't say,
[57:06] "Now Joshua, you're never going to make
[57:08] mistakes.
[57:10] Joshua, you're never going to fall down
[57:11] in battle. Joshua, you're never going to
[57:13] have a near miss." He never said that.
[57:15] What he did say was, "I will not fail
[57:17] thee, and I will not forsake thee."
[57:19] That's the mindset we have to go in,
[57:21] church, is not that I'm going to win or
[57:23] lose. It's that the Christ inside of me
[57:25] will never fail, will never fall, and
[57:27] will never forsake me. That's where our
[57:30] rest is this morning. It's his word.
[57:32] It's his promise. It's his power. It's
[57:34] his very dwelling inside of us that
[57:36] brings us through these things. That's
[57:39] the That's the promise that we have.
[57:41] Amen. Moses had faith in his commission
[57:44] and he acted on it. thing. Now, God's
[57:46] saying to Joshua, Joshua, you got to
[57:48] step in Moses shoes because just as I
[57:50] was with him, I'll be with you and you
[57:51] got to finish the job. He asked Joshua
[57:54] to have the same faith in his commission
[57:56] that Moses has had all those years.
[58:01] He's saying, "Look, Joshua, I've picked
[58:03] you. I've chosen you. Doesn't matter
[58:04] what you think of yourself. I'm with
[58:07] you. You're my man. Let's go. Let's take
[58:09] it through." Now remember when they
[58:11] crossed over Jordan, they had a dedic
[58:13] rededication of their lives to God.
[58:15] Remember what happened is they were not
[58:17] circumcised because many of them were
[58:18] born on the 40-year death march or they
[58:20] were too young coming out of Egypt that
[58:22] they weren't circumcised. And so when
[58:24] they crossed over Jordan, they died to
[58:26] self. That's what crossing over Jordan
[58:28] is. And then they went and remember the
[58:30] men were circumcised which was a type of
[58:32] the Holy Ghost. Remember Paul says we
[58:33] have a circumcision of the heart which
[58:35] is the indwelling of the spirit inside
[58:37] of us. Amen. But the the the promise was
[58:39] always there. But when they died out to
[58:41] self and they came into Canaan land, God
[58:44] had to get them in a condition to
[58:46] receive the promise.
[58:48] Church, it's God's work from start to
[58:50] finish. We're not here preparing
[58:52] ourselves. All we've got to do is take
[58:55] the word and wrap us in it. But he puts
[58:57] us in a condition to receive it. And
[58:59] remember, if you didn't have the sign of
[59:01] circumcision, you could not be counted
[59:03] as a child of Israel. And you were put
[59:05] outside the camp. You had no opportunity
[59:07] to worship. You couldn't do anything.
[59:09] You had to have the circumcision because
[59:11] that was the sign of the covenant in
[59:14] your body. It was a personal witness
[59:16] that you were a child of Abraham because
[59:18] the promise was to Abraham and his seed.
[59:21] Amen.
[59:23] Until they were circumcised, God
[59:25] couldn't even receive their faith.
[59:28] God couldn't back them up. They had to
[59:29] be tied back to him by a promise as a
[59:31] sign that they were children of Abraham.
[59:33] And then once they said that, once they
[59:34] had that, God says, "All right, you're
[59:36] good to go forward." Why? Because they
[59:37] have received the sign. They've received
[59:40] the seal of their life and they were
[59:42] ready to go forward. Amen. It's in our
[59:44] It's just a type of the the new birth
[59:46] for the believer. First, there has to be
[59:47] a dying out and then there has to be a
[59:49] circumcision. There has to be a sign, a
[59:51] seal in our body. Amen. Now, they had
[59:53] all sorts of experiences for 40 years
[59:55] before that, supernatural experiences
[59:58] and provision for the people. But now
[1:00:00] they were coming into the great reality
[1:00:01] of their promise. God had kept them. But
[1:00:04] his promise was not just a keeping
[1:00:06] power. It was to take them into the
[1:00:08] promise of the word for their time. And
[1:00:10] God had to get them ready to receive it.
[1:00:12] So Joshua gets his instructions from
[1:00:14] God. He heads towards Jericho. Now
[1:00:16] remember Joshua is led by the captain of
[1:00:18] the host. Joshua is not being led by
[1:00:20] himself. Remember how God said it. He
[1:00:23] says, "Now Joshua," he says, "You've got
[1:00:24] to let the priests go before you with
[1:00:26] the word because you've never been here.
[1:00:29] You got to let the word go before you.
[1:00:31] What he was telling Joshua is Joshua,
[1:00:33] you can't lead this people. You have to
[1:00:35] be led to lead this people. And when
[1:00:38] Joshua did that, church, things always
[1:00:40] worked out. So Joshua now he's coming to
[1:00:42] Jericho, but he doesn't immediately go
[1:00:44] and attack it. But what does he do? He
[1:00:46] sends two spies over there. Why? Because
[1:00:49] sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:00:51] God.
[1:00:52] Joshua doesn't need to know what the
[1:00:54] condition is in Jericho, but he's led to
[1:00:57] send those two spies in there. And they
[1:00:59] go in there and what do they do? They
[1:01:01] find a child of God because God always
[1:01:04] makes a provision. God always knows his
[1:01:06] own. He's not going to lose any of
[1:01:08] those. And he said this, brother Abraham
[1:01:09] says, Joshua had faith in his own
[1:01:11] commission as Moses had faith. Things
[1:01:14] went wrong for Moses. Looked like he
[1:01:16] failed many times, but he rolled through
[1:01:18] it triumphantly and died on the rock.
[1:01:20] Take some take heart this evening. We
[1:01:23] fail, don't we? He says, "Looks like he
[1:01:27] failed many times, but he rode through
[1:01:29] it triumphantly." God always brought him
[1:01:31] through. He says the angels packed him
[1:01:33] away. He said, "God, let me go like
[1:01:35] that. Let me hold my commission till
[1:01:38] someday when I get ready to die, I'll
[1:01:39] see the rock laying there by me." He
[1:01:41] said, Joshua is keeping his commission.
[1:01:45] God will hold it sacredly because he
[1:01:48] stayed right with the word.
[1:01:52] That's our direction this evening. He
[1:01:54] says, "Now Rahab knew that Joshua had
[1:01:58] his this commission." He says, "Now,
[1:02:00] don't miss it. Hold these things in your
[1:02:01] heart. Joshua had the commission, but
[1:02:04] Rahab recognized it before she saw
[1:02:07] anything." He said, "She knew Joshua had
[1:02:10] this." Church, we're preaching on an
[1:02:12] absolute power. Joshua had the power of
[1:02:16] God that was going to take the land. She
[1:02:19] asked for mercy.
[1:02:22] We preached on it many times how that
[1:02:24] someone's eternal destination so often
[1:02:26] rests in our hands. Not because they're
[1:02:28] a member of the bride, but because they
[1:02:30] are not necessarily a member of the
[1:02:32] bride. Now, Rahab was a child of God.
[1:02:34] She was a daughter of God. She was a a
[1:02:37] member of the bride, we could put it
[1:02:38] that way, of the elect.
[1:02:40] But there are people we deal with day in
[1:02:42] and day out. And what happened here was
[1:02:44] that Rahab showed mercy to those spies
[1:02:47] and she hid them away from the king and
[1:02:49] then she lied to the king. She put her
[1:02:51] life and her family's life and all of
[1:02:52] her possessions on the line to save
[1:02:55] these two spies of an enemy. And then
[1:02:58] she went up and she said, "Listen,
[1:02:59] they've gone. You're going to have to go
[1:03:00] over the wall." But she said, "Look, I
[1:03:02] know that God has given you this land."
[1:03:05] She's never met Joshua. She's never seen
[1:03:07] anything, but she's heard of this God.
[1:03:09] And she says,"I know that God has given
[1:03:11] you the land. I know God is with you."
[1:03:13] She says, "And all I'm asking is that
[1:03:15] this God that is the real God would show
[1:03:17] me mercy."
[1:03:19] And they said, "Listen, hang this cord
[1:03:21] in your window and we promise you'll
[1:03:22] have mercy."
[1:03:24] People don't know that they're asking
[1:03:25] for mercy sometimes.
[1:03:28] And they may hand us a cup of water.
[1:03:29] They may stand up for us at work. They
[1:03:31] may help us out in our home. They may
[1:03:33] give us a pat on the back. They may
[1:03:35] encourage us somehow. And we can stand
[1:03:37] there on that day and say, "Lord, they
[1:03:39] asked for mercy. They didn't know it,
[1:03:40] but I want to stand and ask for mercy
[1:03:41] for them." Let me tell you, our attitude
[1:03:44] matters so much, church. There's a
[1:03:46] reason why we need to get sweet in the
[1:03:48] spirit every morning. That we don't go
[1:03:50] out all grumpy. Amen.
[1:03:52] Sometimes I go out grumpy.
[1:03:55] Sometimes I go out grumpy and it never
[1:03:58] works out well for me or anybody else.
[1:04:00] We need to sweeten our lives with
[1:04:02] prayer. Amen. to go into the presence of
[1:04:05] God and dedicate every day to him and
[1:04:07] say, "Lord, let me be a hand of mercy
[1:04:11] rather than cause somebody to be the
[1:04:12] carnal beast that they are. Lord, let me
[1:04:14] pull mercy out of somebody else that I
[1:04:16] could be your hands and feet and your
[1:04:18] mouth today."
[1:04:21] But I want you to catch this thought.
[1:04:22] Brother Bram says, "What is it that
[1:04:24] caught Rahab's attention?
[1:04:27] It was a child of God following his
[1:04:30] commission.
[1:04:31] Not being swayed, not being moved, not
[1:04:34] trying to inject himself. Amen. It was a
[1:04:36] child of God doing what God told him to
[1:04:38] do. It was a child of God crossing
[1:04:40] Jordan the way God had told him to. Put
[1:04:42] the word before you. And then what
[1:04:44] happened then, church? When you put the
[1:04:45] word in front of you, the supernatural
[1:04:47] always follows. And what did it do? It
[1:04:50] stood a flooded river on its head and it
[1:04:52] backed it up for kilometer after
[1:04:54] kilometer while those people crossed
[1:04:56] over. Not only did they cross over, but
[1:04:58] it held it up while they went into the
[1:04:59] middle and pulled out 12 stones as a
[1:05:01] memorial of the supernatural power of
[1:05:04] the word going before the people.
[1:05:06] It was a child of God under supreme
[1:05:09] authority by the word of God that Ra
[1:05:13] Rahab saw.
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:18] You say, "Well, that's Joshua." Caleb
[1:05:20] had the same commission, church. It's
[1:05:22] for, that's why I said at the beginning,
[1:05:24] it's for everyone that's a part of the
[1:05:26] covenant. We want to put the commission
[1:05:28] on the leadership. No. Behold, I send
[1:05:31] unto you. It's your commission. It's
[1:05:34] your message. It's your inheritance.
[1:05:37] It's your promise. It's your word. It's
[1:05:40] given to you to take it. Caleb was just
[1:05:42] another He was He was just a person.
[1:05:45] Caleb wasn't some great guy in and of
[1:05:47] himself. He was just a a lay member if
[1:05:49] we could put it that way. But if you
[1:05:51] look at Caleb's story in Joshua 15, he
[1:05:54] come remember he said Joshua give me my
[1:05:56] mountain in Joshua 14. And so Caleb went
[1:05:58] up and he defeated the father the the
[1:06:01] the chief of the giants and then he
[1:06:04] defeated his three sons one after
[1:06:05] another. So he's killed four giants now.
[1:06:08] But then Caleb starts to think because
[1:06:09] remember he's 85.
[1:06:12] He knows what happened to Joshua. As
[1:06:13] soon as Joshua stopped fighting, he got
[1:06:15] old and died. Caleb sees, he says, "My
[1:06:18] battle's almost over, but this is going
[1:06:20] to take a strong believer to hold the
[1:06:22] the kingdom." And so what does he do? He
[1:06:25] leaves the fifth one and he says,
[1:06:27] "Whoever can kill this giant and take
[1:06:30] this city, they can become my inheritor.
[1:06:34] They can marry my daughter and they'll
[1:06:36] get it all." And so what happened? A
[1:06:39] young man rose up, took the city,
[1:06:40] married his daughter, and he inherited
[1:06:42] all of Caleb, all of his inheritance,
[1:06:46] church. God's looking for young people
[1:06:48] that'll continue in the covenant.
[1:06:51] That's what he's looking for. Young
[1:06:52] people that'll pick up right where mom
[1:06:54] and dad left off. You know what? We're
[1:06:56] better off than we were because we've
[1:06:58] had people like Brother Mark and Sister
[1:07:00] Moren and Brother Bob and Sister Brenda
[1:07:02] and Brother Gerald and Sister Betty and
[1:07:03] our parents that have raised us up in
[1:07:05] the message of the hour. We don't have
[1:07:07] to start from ground zero. There's a
[1:07:09] foundation that's built. There's a
[1:07:11] character that's been shown to us.
[1:07:13] There's a there's a way of living that
[1:07:15] we've seen that works and we've seen the
[1:07:16] results of it. So, we don't have to make
[1:07:18] mistakes. We start further ahead. I've
[1:07:21] said before that there's, you know, I've
[1:07:22] talked about brother Paul. I admire
[1:07:24] brother Paul as a young man. He's not so
[1:07:26] old anymore, but I believe he's further
[1:07:29] ahead than I was at his age. Why?
[1:07:31] Because he picked up where others left
[1:07:33] off. He learned from their mistakes. He
[1:07:36] took their wisdom and he applied it so
[1:07:38] that he could start out faster and he's
[1:07:40] moving faster and faster. I've said this
[1:07:41] about some senior ministers around the
[1:07:43] message. They say the young ministers
[1:07:44] are catching things faster and faster.
[1:07:47] Things that took us 30 years, they're
[1:07:48] getting so fast because why? They're not
[1:07:51] trying to build it up again, but they're
[1:07:52] stepping on the foundation that was
[1:07:54] already laid and they're building from
[1:07:56] there. Amen.
[1:07:59] God's looking for a generation of young
[1:08:00] people that'll take him at his word,
[1:08:04] that'll stay with it, that know that
[1:08:06] it's proven, and they'll put their lives
[1:08:08] on the line, and they'll start out the
[1:08:09] right way. And that puts them so far
[1:08:11] ahead. Church, we're not getting out of
[1:08:13] here unless all of us have rapturing
[1:08:14] faith. Do you know that? We all got to
[1:08:17] catch up at some point. Listen, Brother
[1:08:19] Bob and Brother Mark and their their
[1:08:21] their spouses, they might have rapturing
[1:08:22] faith tonight. I don't know. But listen,
[1:08:24] they don't get to go until you and I
[1:08:25] have it. from the youngest to the
[1:08:28] oldest. We've all got to be in that
[1:08:29] unity with Christ. We've all got to know
[1:08:31] who we are and we've all got to know
[1:08:33] what our time and our commission is.
[1:08:35] We've all got to get out of here at the
[1:08:37] same time. Amen. In this age of rights
[1:08:39] and offenses and self-entitlement and
[1:08:42] all these things that are rolling
[1:08:43] around, there's going to there is a
[1:08:44] there's not going to come. There is a
[1:08:46] generation that will overcome that'll
[1:08:48] take God at his word and will walk out
[1:08:50] of this without seeing death.
[1:08:53] You might not have known your Moses.
[1:08:55] Listen, I wasn't around to see all the
[1:08:57] things Brother Brandham did. And they're
[1:08:59] fast dying out the ones that did.
[1:09:03] But listen, we've got to know God's
[1:09:06] still alive. What was God saying to
[1:09:08] Joshua? He's saying, Joshua, the God of
[1:09:10] Moses is the God of Joshua.
[1:09:13] The God of William Brandom is the God of
[1:09:16] you. He's not dead. He's still alive. He
[1:09:19] still wants to have the same
[1:09:20] relationship. He still wants to do the
[1:09:21] same things. Remember what brother Brham
[1:09:23] said? He says when the when the bride or
[1:09:25] the church recognizes who she is and
[1:09:29] that she can do the greater works.
[1:09:32] See, it's not just about knowing who you
[1:09:34] are, but to know what he wants you to
[1:09:36] do. Now,
[1:09:38] when we do that, he says the rapture
[1:09:39] will go. It's a bride that recognizes
[1:09:42] who she is from the young to the old,
[1:09:44] from the toes to the top of the head.
[1:09:46] Amen.
[1:09:48] God's looking for people that'll take up
[1:09:49] their commission. I was reading in my
[1:09:51] devotions again on Monday. Monday was a
[1:09:53] very good devotions morning and I read
[1:09:55] the scripture and I'd read it before and
[1:09:57] I didn't have a single thing underlined
[1:09:58] in it.
[1:10:00] It's just the way things work sometimes,
[1:10:02] you know. But I it really struck me as I
[1:10:05] was reading it just with these things on
[1:10:07] my heart knowing what I would be
[1:10:08] preaching. And watch how God speaks now
[1:10:10] through David. It says when Israel went
[1:10:12] out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
[1:10:16] people of strange language, it says
[1:10:18] Judah was his sanctuary and Israel was
[1:10:22] his dominion. Now that word sanctuary
[1:10:24] means a place that is set apart. It is
[1:10:27] the consecrated and holy dwelling place.
[1:10:30] So Judah was the consecrated holy
[1:10:32] dwelling place of God. And then he said
[1:10:34] Israel was his dominion. And that word
[1:10:36] dominion means his government, his rule,
[1:10:39] his realm or his kingdom. So I want you
[1:10:42] to notice something, church. When God is
[1:10:44] with you, when God is in you, you are
[1:10:47] identified with God. Now that seems like
[1:10:50] an obvious thing to say perhaps, but so
[1:10:52] often we forget what it means to be a
[1:10:54] Holy Ghostfilled child of God. I think
[1:10:57] you're not just a child of God. You're
[1:10:58] not just a son of God. You're not just a
[1:11:01] a daughter of God. You're not just a
[1:11:02] Christian, but you are you are
[1:11:04] identified as he says here as the
[1:11:07] consecrated kingdom from which God rules
[1:11:10] and reigns.
[1:11:12] Now, that puts a whole different spin on
[1:11:14] it, doesn't it? It's not just God
[1:11:15] dwelling on me, but God rules and reigns
[1:11:18] and expresses his dominion through his
[1:11:21] people.
[1:11:23] And the sea saw it.
[1:11:27] What
[1:11:28] the sea saw? Judah his sanctuary
[1:11:32] and Israel his dominion and fled and
[1:11:35] Jordan was driven back. Church, what
[1:11:38] caused the Red Sea to separate? God and
[1:11:40] his people. What caused Jordan to roll
[1:11:43] back? God and his people.
[1:11:47] Paul said, "You are the temple of the
[1:11:49] living God."
[1:11:52] Jesus said, "Greater works than this
[1:11:53] shall you do." God is literally ruling
[1:11:56] and reigning from inside you tonight.
[1:11:59] And it says it caused the sea to fall
[1:12:01] back. Jordan was driven back. He says
[1:12:05] the mountains skipped like rams and the
[1:12:07] little hills like lambs. In other words,
[1:12:09] an earthquake shook them all. It moved
[1:12:12] them because of the presence of God with
[1:12:14] his people. He says, "What hailed thee,
[1:12:16] oh thou sea?" We sing. We we talk about
[1:12:19] the mighty oceans. And in Newfoundland,
[1:12:20] we know a lot about mighty oceans.
[1:12:22] Remember we had that storm a couple
[1:12:23] years ago on CBS where it took stones
[1:12:26] that were were dozens of tons and threw
[1:12:28] them up on the bank and pulled them off.
[1:12:30] That's what a mighty ocean does. And he
[1:12:32] says, "What do you a thou sea? Oh mighty
[1:12:36] ocean, what happened to you, buddy?
[1:12:39] You thought you were so strong and then
[1:12:41] all of a sudden
[1:12:45] you fled."
[1:12:48] He says, "What a thou see that thou
[1:12:50] fledest? Thou Jordan, you flooded river
[1:12:52] that nobody could cross. What happened
[1:12:55] that thou was driven back? What was it,
[1:12:58] church? Was it the people?
[1:13:00] Did they see brother Joshua and say,
[1:13:02] "Wow, what a man."
[1:13:04] No, it was God and his people that
[1:13:06] caused that to happen.
[1:13:09] He says, "Ye skip like rams and ye
[1:13:12] little hills like lambs." He says,
[1:13:14] "Tremble thou earth what? at the
[1:13:16] presence of the Lord and at the presence
[1:13:19] of the God of Jacob. David wrote that
[1:13:22] under inspiration of the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:25] But he wrote it by personal revelation
[1:13:27] cuz David had seen mountains dance and
[1:13:31] rivers pass away and giants fall before
[1:13:33] him and the supernatural take place in
[1:13:36] his life. Why? Not because of David, but
[1:13:38] because God had identified himself with
[1:13:41] a piece of flesh called David and done
[1:13:43] signs and wonders through his life.
[1:13:46] I want to remind us this evening how
[1:13:49] David got this victory, how David got
[1:13:52] this revelation, how David got this
[1:13:54] testimony because I want us to see that
[1:13:56] we have the exact same thing. When you
[1:13:58] look at David, David lived about 300
[1:14:00] years after Judah or sorry after Joshua.
[1:14:03] So David was not alive to see the great
[1:14:05] conquest of Canaan. David was not around
[1:14:07] to see all the giants killed. David was
[1:14:09] not alive to see Jericho fall flat on
[1:14:11] its face without being touched by any uh
[1:14:13] battering rams or or anything like that.
[1:14:16] David was not alive to see Caleb take
[1:14:18] hein from the giants of Anch. David only
[1:14:22] had his Bible to tell him about that.
[1:14:25] And yet David writes about this.
[1:14:28] David had no personal knowledge of God
[1:14:31] killing a giant with a common man.
[1:14:35] But David had two things, church. He had
[1:14:37] a commission and he had an anointing.
[1:14:42] He had a commission and anointing.
[1:14:45] David didn't have sword lessons. He
[1:14:46] didn't have military training. He didn't
[1:14:48] have armor or great weapons. Church,
[1:14:50] what I'm trying to say is you've got
[1:14:52] what it takes if you've got the word and
[1:14:53] you've got the spirit to anoint it. You
[1:14:56] don't have to be some big shot. You
[1:14:57] don't have to have all this training.
[1:15:00] I was reading in my office there.
[1:15:01] Brother Bram said, "The weakest
[1:15:04] Christian," this is a direct quote, "the
[1:15:06] weakest Christian causes the devil to
[1:15:08] tremble."
[1:15:11] Brother Bram says, "If you will take him
[1:15:13] at his word." That's it. That's it.
[1:15:18] Once you what? You've received the
[1:15:20] spirit and you recognize that the word
[1:15:23] is meant for you,
[1:15:25] that's it. Hell starts to tremble
[1:15:28] because they know their time is short.
[1:15:30] They know there's a battle coming and
[1:15:32] they've got to lose. Amen. But the B
[1:15:34] says it this way. He says, "Look at
[1:15:35] David. Little David. David's about 15,
[1:15:39] remember? When he's out with the when
[1:15:40] he's out with the sheep, he's we between
[1:15:42] 12 and 15.
[1:15:45] So younger than my son. More like uh
[1:15:48] Levi, I guess, maybe. Or or Gabe. Gabe
[1:15:50] would be a good one. Gabe is David. this
[1:15:53] this evening if we want to think about
[1:15:54] this. Okay, we we we ascribe so much
[1:15:57] greatness to David. But let's put Gab's
[1:15:59] name in there tonight. Okay, Gabe. Gabe
[1:16:01] is David. Little Gabe, no doubt raised
[1:16:05] in a lovely believing home. His father
[1:16:07] Joseph, a great man of God, no doubt
[1:16:09] gathered all those boys around that
[1:16:11] night and had family prayer before they
[1:16:13] went to bed. probably read the scrolls,
[1:16:16] talked about great Jehovah that had
[1:16:17] opened up the Red Sea, and a great
[1:16:19] prophet, William Brandham, had brought
[1:16:21] them out following the pillar of fire.
[1:16:23] All these things. Why am I saying it,
[1:16:25] church? Because you've got to do the
[1:16:27] same things to get the same results.
[1:16:30] Fathers and mothers, we've got an
[1:16:32] obligation to raise our children in the
[1:16:34] fear and admonition of the Lord.
[1:16:38] He says, what happened that created
[1:16:41] faith? Faith cometh by hearing, hearing
[1:16:44] of the word of God. He says, little
[1:16:46] David got to thinking of that. Little
[1:16:48] Gabe, start thinking, buddy.
[1:16:51] Church, too often we're waiting for us
[1:16:53] to get old, to have faith, to take God
[1:16:55] at his word. I'm using David for purpose
[1:16:57] this morning because David started at a
[1:16:59] young age and it carried him all the way
[1:17:00] to his death. We don't have to wait to
[1:17:03] get the Holy Ghost. We don't have to
[1:17:04] wait to take God at his word. We don't
[1:17:06] have to wait to have the supernatural in
[1:17:08] our life. We don't have to wait to hear
[1:17:09] from God. We don't have to wait to
[1:17:11] worship, to praise, to lift our hands.
[1:17:14] We don't have to wait to experience the
[1:17:16] reality of a living God in our life. If
[1:17:19] you want it, you can have it. It's that
[1:17:21] simple. He says, "Oh, of course, he was
[1:17:24] kind of the smallest one of the family."
[1:17:26] That's not Gabe.
[1:17:28] He says, "So they put him out to watch a
[1:17:30] few sheep and he was responsible for
[1:17:32] those sheep. And one day a lion came in
[1:17:34] and got one. And he thought, now what am
[1:17:35] I going to say to my father about the
[1:17:37] sheep being missing?" And he happened to
[1:17:40] remember that my father read from the
[1:17:43] scrolls and told me that God was a great
[1:17:45] God to deliver his people and that he
[1:17:48] would bless Israel and he was with
[1:17:50] Israel and all that circumcised are in
[1:17:52] that covenant. God's blessing is upon
[1:17:55] them. Now watch this. He says, "And I'm
[1:17:58] one of them.
[1:18:00] I'm circumcised and God's blessing is
[1:18:03] upon me. I have a right." He says, "One
[1:18:08] of my father sheep's gone, so I'm going
[1:18:10] after that sheep." Church, we've got to
[1:18:13] get out of this mentality that we're
[1:18:14] getting out of our rights if we insist
[1:18:16] on something.
[1:18:19] Not something that makes life easier.
[1:18:21] Something that he promised belonged to
[1:18:23] you and I. It ain't wrong to claim your
[1:18:26] promise. Like I said, we've got to go
[1:18:28] through trials. We've got to go through
[1:18:29] temptations. We've got to go through
[1:18:30] difficult times. But the way we go
[1:18:32] through it is not up to Satan. We've got
[1:18:35] a choice if we go through God's way or
[1:18:37] we go through a different way. And there
[1:18:39] are things that we have an absolute
[1:18:41] redemptive right to say you have no
[1:18:42] place in my life, in my body, in my
[1:18:45] family. Amen. Watch when we get in the
[1:18:49] book of Acts church. Nothing stood
[1:18:50] before the disciples. Nothing. Death,
[1:18:54] disease, demons, ministry,
[1:18:57] self-righteous people.
[1:19:00] None of it. None of it stood before
[1:19:02] them. fakers,
[1:19:04] pretended brothers, it doesn't matter.
[1:19:07] All bowed before the power of the
[1:19:10] disciples because it wasn't them. It was
[1:19:11] almighty God working through them. Amen.
[1:19:18] David was commissioned to be king of
[1:19:19] Israel and he was anointed by Samuel.
[1:19:21] And from that day, the scripture says
[1:19:23] the spirit of a king, the spirit of God
[1:19:25] came on him, left Saul, went to him and
[1:19:27] that spirit of God was there to guide
[1:19:29] him into the fullness of his commission.
[1:19:31] Remember, powers given with purpose. And
[1:19:33] God poured out his spirit on David to
[1:19:35] get him ready to be king. But what's the
[1:19:38] first thing God does to a believer,
[1:19:39] church? He always brings them to the
[1:19:42] word. God doesn't fill you with his
[1:19:45] spirit and then take you to his word. He
[1:19:46] gives you his word and then he brings
[1:19:47] his spirit to make it live. And we see
[1:19:50] that in the scriptures in Acts in
[1:19:52] particular where Peter comes down and he
[1:19:54] preaches and what does he do? He gives
[1:19:55] them the word. They receive it. They see
[1:19:58] themselves in it. and they receive the
[1:19:59] power now to go and do it. Then Peter
[1:20:02] goes to uh the house of Cornelius and
[1:20:04] while he's speaking it, they're eating
[1:20:06] what he's laying down. They're picking
[1:20:07] up what he's laying down. And God gave
[1:20:09] them the spirit then. Why? Because they
[1:20:10] had received their word. They recognized
[1:20:13] it was for them. And so God filled them
[1:20:14] with the spirit. Why? So they could go
[1:20:16] out and be his witnesses and testify of
[1:20:18] the living grace of Jesus Christ in
[1:20:20] their life. Amen. So God gives you the
[1:20:22] word and then when you receive it, he
[1:20:24] anoints you to step into the reality of
[1:20:25] it. That's the way that God's working in
[1:20:27] us. Amen. That's what the Holy Spirit is
[1:20:29] given for is to bring the reality of the
[1:20:31] word of God. And so David now, he's
[1:20:33] anointed to be king. And he goes out
[1:20:36] back to being a shepherd. Now, that's
[1:20:38] great for the sheep when you got a king
[1:20:40] that's watching over you.
[1:20:42] And David goes out, he has all these
[1:20:44] supernatural experiences. And what was
[1:20:46] it? It was God teaching David that if
[1:20:49] you believe in your commission and you
[1:20:50] take me at your word, nothing can stand
[1:20:52] before you. That's it. It's that simple.
[1:20:55] Now, it wasn't that simple.
[1:20:58] But it is that simple because the first
[1:21:00] thing he gets is a lion.
[1:21:02] Now, I don't know if you know anything
[1:21:04] about lions, but one thing's for sure.
[1:21:05] You don't want to mess with a lion when
[1:21:06] you're a 13 or 14 or 15 year old. Even
[1:21:09] with a rifle or a spear, you don't want
[1:21:11] to do it. But guess what? David learned
[1:21:13] to tango with a lion and win. And then
[1:21:16] he learned with a bear and he had the
[1:21:17] exact same experience. Amen. God was
[1:21:19] showing David what? I'm with you. You
[1:21:22] don't have to fear. And when you're in
[1:21:24] the line of duty, as humble as it may
[1:21:27] be, come on, as humble as it may be. Too
[1:21:30] often we think what we're doing is just
[1:21:31] our life. It's too humble. No. If you're
[1:21:34] in the line of duty, you have a
[1:21:36] commission that backs you up with the
[1:21:38] power of God. If you can remember, you
[1:21:40] have a commission. From our mothers at
[1:21:43] home to our fathers at work and
[1:21:45] everything in between, the young people,
[1:21:47] if you are walking in the line of duty,
[1:21:49] there's a commission for you in the word
[1:21:50] of God.
[1:21:51] Daniel had a commission.
[1:21:54] Look what it did for him in a land of
[1:21:56] slavery, in a land where they tried to
[1:21:58] force him to do things. And he says,
[1:21:59] "No, I'm going to keep myself clean."
[1:22:01] And he did. And God blessed him for it.
[1:22:05] David was being prepared for greater and
[1:22:07] greater things. And how many times have
[1:22:09] I said it? The things we face today are
[1:22:11] to prepare us for things tomorrow. And
[1:22:13] we're going to preach on this in a
[1:22:14] couple services. But the faith that we
[1:22:16] have today, the experiences we have
[1:22:18] today are imperfect. there in part. But
[1:22:21] there's coming a day where we walk into
[1:22:23] perfect faith and perfect and absolute
[1:22:25] power. And it'll take us right off of
[1:22:26] this planet.
[1:22:28] What we're doing today will transition
[1:22:29] us into eternity. It's here for time,
[1:22:31] but it's going to take us into eternity
[1:22:33] as we step into it. As Christ comes
[1:22:35] down, that's really the absolute. When
[1:22:37] Christ himself unites with the body,
[1:22:39] then nothing will stop us. We'll walk
[1:22:41] out of this without seeing death under
[1:22:42] the perfect headship of Christ. But
[1:22:45] remember, David is sent. David doesn't
[1:22:48] go find the battle. He's under headship.
[1:22:52] And headship sends him to where he's
[1:22:54] needed. Amen. David was not, as his
[1:22:57] brother accused him of, going out to try
[1:22:59] and get in the battle or or or be just a
[1:23:01] sly little kid or or whatever. David
[1:23:04] went because his father told him, and he
[1:23:05] did exactly what his father told him to
[1:23:07] do.
[1:23:09] David comes up just as the as Goliath
[1:23:12] walks out and he hears his challenge.
[1:23:14] And David spake to the men that stood by
[1:23:15] him, saying, "What shall be done to the
[1:23:17] man that kleth this Philistine and
[1:23:18] taketh away the reproach from Israel?
[1:23:21] For who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:23:24] that he should defy the armies of the
[1:23:26] living God?" I've preached on this
[1:23:27] before. Why is David talking about
[1:23:29] circumcision?
[1:23:32] Because David has received his
[1:23:34] commission and he understands that
[1:23:36] there's a requirement to receive that
[1:23:37] commission. David's saying, "I've got
[1:23:40] the evidence of being a part of the
[1:23:42] covenant of Almighty God, and this guy
[1:23:45] doesn't. So why is he still alive?"
[1:23:49] He's he's putting himself in Joshua's
[1:23:51] shoes, and he's saying, "No man shall
[1:23:54] stand before thee everywhere that the
[1:23:57] soul of your foot shall tread." So he's
[1:23:59] saying, "How is this guy still alive? We
[1:24:01] got an army of circumcised sons of God
[1:24:05] standing here and we've got an
[1:24:06] uncircumcised guy standing there. Why is
[1:24:08] he still alive, guys?
[1:24:12] He's trying to wake them up to who they
[1:24:14] were.
[1:24:15] Trying to remind them.
[1:24:18] David's saying, "We're children of the
[1:24:19] promise. We're the seed of Abraham.
[1:24:22] We've already killed these guys before.
[1:24:24] What are we waiting for?" Abraham has
[1:24:27] this beautiful quote. He says, "David
[1:24:29] said, 'You mean to tell me that
[1:24:30] uncircumcised Philistine?" He says,
[1:24:32] "Otherwise, that uncchristianized, that
[1:24:35] man who doesn't." He says, "What is
[1:24:36] circumcision?" He says, "That man out
[1:24:39] there with the Holy Ghost." He says,
[1:24:41] "That uncir that uncchristianized man
[1:24:43] with all of his deities can stand and
[1:24:45] defy the living God." He says, "Oh my,
[1:24:48] how can he do it?" Said, "He's
[1:24:49] uncircumcised."
[1:24:51] See, David's David doesn't have to do
[1:24:53] this. I love how Brother Bram says this
[1:24:54] about David. He says, "David didn't have
[1:24:56] to get prayed up, David was already
[1:24:59] prayed up." See, when David was sitting
[1:25:01] there with the sheep, he was sitting
[1:25:03] around and he's reading his word and
[1:25:04] he's singing his songs and he's sitting
[1:25:06] there and he's got a checklist in his
[1:25:08] hand and he's saying, "Okay, this is
[1:25:09] what God said to Joshua." God said,
[1:25:11] "This is the land that I've given you."
[1:25:14] Okay, where's that land? It's here.
[1:25:15] Okay, check. I'm in the right land. Now,
[1:25:17] who is this for? It's for the seed of
[1:25:18] Abraham. Am I a seed of Abraham? Yes.
[1:25:21] How do I know it? I've got the
[1:25:22] circumcision in my body. Check.
[1:25:25] So when David comes up on the
[1:25:26] Philistine, he's got who he is all
[1:25:28] checked off on his list of the covenant.
[1:25:31] So when he comes up and he sees this,
[1:25:33] David is saying, "Guys, you got to wake
[1:25:35] up. Look on the side of the covenant
[1:25:37] this guy is on. We're on the winning
[1:25:40] side. He's on the losing side. He's a
[1:25:43] Philistine. God named them by name to
[1:25:46] say that we can kill him."
[1:25:48] David's coming in prepared. He's read
[1:25:51] his word. He knows his commission. He
[1:25:54] knows which side of the word he's on.
[1:25:56] And everything that's contrary to him
[1:25:58] has to be on the losing side. He doesn't
[1:26:01] have to go prayed up because he already
[1:26:03] knows who he is. He knows who's with
[1:26:06] him. He knows what he's doing. He knows
[1:26:07] God is with him. And so when the
[1:26:09] situation presents itself, he says, "All
[1:26:11] right, let's deal with this once and for
[1:26:15] all." and he shames them because grown
[1:26:19] men bigger than him, remember his his
[1:26:21] brother was big and strong.
[1:26:25] But his brother didn't believe God was
[1:26:26] still alive. And that's one thing David
[1:26:29] knew was God was still alive and he's
[1:26:31] with me.
[1:26:34] David says he's a defeated enemy. He's
[1:26:38] literally named in our scriptures, guys,
[1:26:40] as a defeated enemy.
[1:26:43] Brother Ramwood tells time and time
[1:26:45] again, "You're facing a defeated enemy.
[1:26:49] You're facing a defeated enemy."
[1:26:52] But all he's trying to do is make
[1:26:54] himself look bigger and bigger and
[1:26:56] bigger so that you don't even try and
[1:26:58] fight him. Cuz the minute you start
[1:27:01] fighting, church, he's going down. He's
[1:27:03] going down. Remember, Brother Bram talks
[1:27:06] about that, I think it was that dream
[1:27:08] where the devil came up and the devil
[1:27:10] kept saying, "Boo, boo, boo." He says,
[1:27:12] "And as he said boo," I it pushed me
[1:27:14] back and I got smaller and smaller. But
[1:27:15] then something struck and I said, "Boo
[1:27:17] back and he started to take a step back
[1:27:19] and he got smaller and smaller and
[1:27:21] smaller until I could defeat him."
[1:27:24] Sometimes we need to remind ourselves
[1:27:26] who we are. Listen, when David went to
[1:27:28] Ziglag, remember David was all messed
[1:27:30] up, church, he was backsliding. He was
[1:27:32] with the Philistines. And remember the
[1:27:34] the the king's captain said, "Listen,
[1:27:36] don't take this guy out against the
[1:27:37] Israelites cuz he'll turn on us and
[1:27:40] we'll definitely lose." So the king sent
[1:27:42] him back, but while he was gone, the
[1:27:43] enemy had come in and they' taken his
[1:27:45] family and his friends families and
[1:27:47] everything. They burned Zigleg. And the
[1:27:49] scripture says David what? He
[1:27:51] strengthened himself in the Lord.
[1:27:55] Listen, we make mistakes.
[1:27:59] Sometimes we're not where we ought to
[1:28:00] be, but it doesn't change the fact that
[1:28:02] we're a child of God and that we can
[1:28:05] come back to him and say, "Lord, help me
[1:28:08] out. I'm sorry. I messed up. I made a
[1:28:12] mistake. And then David said, 'Lord,
[1:28:14] what do I do? And God said, what?
[1:28:16] Pursue, for thou shalt recover all. All
[1:28:20] backslid in David, living where he ought
[1:28:22] not to live.
[1:28:25] And God said, "Pursue and recover all."
[1:28:28] But David encouraged himself in the
[1:28:30] Lord. He reminded himself of his
[1:28:32] anointing, of his commission, of his
[1:28:35] promise, and of his purpose. And then he
[1:28:37] said, "God, what do you want your
[1:28:38] servant to do?" and God led him back to
[1:28:40] victory.
[1:28:42] Amen.
[1:28:46] You're meant to defeat Satan.
[1:28:49] You're meant to defeat anything and
[1:28:51] everything that stands before you
[1:28:54] without exception. You know what I love?
[1:28:57] I was thinking about this before
[1:28:58] service. God is so confident we're going
[1:29:01] to overcome that he's already got a
[1:29:02] prize for us.
[1:29:04] You know how they have these things
[1:29:06] where they they have a prize and um
[1:29:08] there's a guy in the Olympics, I don't
[1:29:09] know if you know this, a little sidebar.
[1:29:11] He's the world's greatest high jumper.
[1:29:13] And the way it works with high jumping
[1:29:15] is if you have to beat it by um I think
[1:29:18] 1 centimeter to break the record. That's
[1:29:20] the only increments they go in is one
[1:29:22] centimeter. And so he knows he can jump
[1:29:25] higher, but every time he breaks the
[1:29:27] record, he gets $100,000.
[1:29:30] So he always every meet he raises it by
[1:29:32] one centimeter at a time because he gets
[1:29:34] 100 grand every single time. Even though
[1:29:36] he knows he can jump 10 centimeters
[1:29:38] higher, he only goes a centimeter at a
[1:29:40] time. Why? Because there's a prize for
[1:29:42] those that can pass the bar.
[1:29:45] Brilliant. And he's making a lot of
[1:29:46] money
[1:29:48] doing it bit by bit, gaming the system,
[1:29:50] right? But what am I saying? God doesn't
[1:29:53] have prizes for things that aren't going
[1:29:55] to be won. To him that overcomemeth. To
[1:29:59] him that overcomemeth. To him that
[1:30:01] overcomemeth. To him that overcomemeth.
[1:30:03] He's got a commission and he's got a
[1:30:04] power because he's know there's
[1:30:05] something he's going to take it.
[1:30:07] Somebody's going to stand up and move
[1:30:08] with it. Amen.
[1:30:10] We look at David. We say, "Well, he's a
[1:30:12] giant killer." We look at Caleb, he's a
[1:30:13] giant killer. We look at all these
[1:30:15] things. Listen, church, we're all giant
[1:30:17] killers. That's where we'll finish this
[1:30:19] evening. Look at this. David said to
[1:30:21] Saul, "Let no man's heart fail because
[1:30:23] of him. Thy servant shall go and fight
[1:30:26] with this Philistine. And Saul said to
[1:30:27] David, thou are not able to go up
[1:30:29] against this Philistine. Church, this is
[1:30:31] the same anointing that was on the 10
[1:30:33] spies and the children of Israel. We're
[1:30:36] not able
[1:30:37] to go up against this Philistine to
[1:30:39] fight with him, for thou art but a
[1:30:40] youth, and he is a man of war from his
[1:30:42] youth. Listen, Saul had forgotten
[1:30:44] rookies beat him last time. And old men,
[1:30:48] old men and rookies had beaten the the
[1:30:50] Giants the last time because Saul's
[1:30:52] under an evil spirit.
[1:30:54] an unbelieving spirit. There's no faith
[1:30:58] there.
[1:31:00] Says, "And David said unto Saul, thy
[1:31:02] servant kept his father's sheep, and
[1:31:03] there came a lion and a bear, and took a
[1:31:05] lamb out of the flock, and I went out
[1:31:07] after him, and smokeote him, and
[1:31:09] delivered it out of his mouth, and when
[1:31:11] he arose against me, I caught him by his
[1:31:12] beard, and smokeote him, and slew him.
[1:31:14] Thy servants slew both the lion and the
[1:31:16] bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:31:19] shall be as one of them, seeing he had
[1:31:21] defied the armies of
[1:31:24] the living God. See, Saul had forgotten
[1:31:27] his position.
[1:31:29] David's saying, "Listen, we're all
[1:31:30] children of Abraham. We're all
[1:31:33] circumcised. We're all under the
[1:31:35] covenant." And this guy's standing here
[1:31:37] laughing at us because we've forgotten
[1:31:39] who we are. He says, "I know who I am. I
[1:31:42] know God's with me. and I know God's
[1:31:44] alive and well. He says, "David said,
[1:31:46] moreover, the Lord that delivered me out
[1:31:48] of the paw of the lion and the paw of
[1:31:50] the bear, he will deliver me out of the
[1:31:51] hand of this Philistine." And Saul said
[1:31:53] unto David, "Go, and the Lord be with
[1:31:55] thee." David had three things. He had a
[1:31:58] sign of the covenant in his body. He
[1:32:00] knew he was in the land, and he knew he
[1:32:03] was commissioned and anointed to destroy
[1:32:04] Israel's enemies. Remember, power comes
[1:32:08] with purpose. And David's anointed.
[1:32:10] Everything that David's experienced thus
[1:32:12] far is to take him to Goliath. And then
[1:32:15] after Goliath, he's got a bunch of
[1:32:16] things. And we see that David's
[1:32:18] character is already welldeveloped here.
[1:32:20] But his character will stand him there.
[1:32:21] He doesn't put everyone down. He doesn't
[1:32:23] say, "King,
[1:32:26] how are you king and you don't even
[1:32:27] believe? How are you leading it?" No,
[1:32:28] no. He just says, "Listen, I'll take
[1:32:30] care of it."
[1:32:32] And then he walks out. Listen to this
[1:32:35] quote. I love this. I'm trying to
[1:32:36] encourage you tonight. Amen. I'm trying
[1:32:38] to let you see where you are. That
[1:32:40] you've got power in the commission of
[1:32:41] the word as a believer that's received
[1:32:43] it. Brother says, "I like David." He
[1:32:46] knew that Samuel the prophet had poured
[1:32:47] the oil on his head. He had a
[1:32:50] commission. He came up there to the army
[1:32:52] that day and there stood big old Goliath
[1:32:53] over there making his boast and the
[1:32:55] armies of God all backed up with their
[1:32:57] theology. They were Israelites and
[1:33:00] circumcised and so forth, but scared. He
[1:33:03] says, "Oh, that reminds me of the church
[1:33:05] today. Scared to make a move." Notice
[1:33:08] they had everything they needed. They
[1:33:10] were everything they were supposed to be
[1:33:12] except one thing. They didn't remember
[1:33:14] who they were. They had no revelation.
[1:33:18] And so fear dominated. He said he came
[1:33:20] out and made a boast. But the wrong man
[1:33:22] heard it. I love that. A little old
[1:33:25] scrawny runy looking boy with a piece of
[1:33:27] sheepkin wrapped around him said, "You
[1:33:29] mean to tell me you cowards will stand
[1:33:31] there and let that uncircumcised
[1:33:32] Philistine defy the armies of the living
[1:33:34] God?" He said he was ready to put what
[1:33:37] he had to action. Now, I want you to
[1:33:40] realize what did David have to put into
[1:33:43] action
[1:33:44] physically. I'm talking about
[1:33:47] he had a shepherd's staff and a
[1:33:50] shepherd's sling.
[1:33:51] That's it. Brother Abraham said, "What?
[1:33:53] An inch of armor on on Goliath and
[1:33:57] you're going to go up with him with
[1:33:58] sticks and stones." Which is why Goliath
[1:34:00] laughed when he came up. He says, "You
[1:34:02] come to me with sticks and stones like a
[1:34:03] dog." Really?
[1:34:06] But church, remember, God had used that
[1:34:09] before.
[1:34:11] It's not about what you have. It's is
[1:34:13] God behind it. That's the lesson we're
[1:34:16] trying to get here. It's not what you
[1:34:17] have, it's will you put it into action?
[1:34:20] Will you put it into action? He says,
[1:34:22] "Hallelujah. That's what we need tonight
[1:34:24] is to get somebody who will take what
[1:34:26] you got and put it into action." He
[1:34:28] says, "Let your faith go." Why? He told
[1:34:30] Saw, "Your servant was hurting his
[1:34:32] father's sheep. A lion came up to get a
[1:34:33] lamb, and I took a slingshot, knocked
[1:34:35] him down. He rose up against me. I took
[1:34:37] my knife and killed him." He said, "A
[1:34:38] bear went after another one. I took it
[1:34:40] out of his mouth." He said, "God, help
[1:34:42] me to do that. How much more will he,
[1:34:43] that uncircumcised Philistine who's
[1:34:45] defined the armies of the living God."
[1:34:47] Church, we've got to build on our
[1:34:48] experiences.
[1:34:51] Amen. Let's let God be God today, not
[1:34:53] just God yesterday, and not put him off
[1:34:55] till tomorrow. Let God be God today.
[1:34:57] He's the I am. He's the everpresent help
[1:35:00] in time of trouble. He says, "Now I
[1:35:02] don't see where any great big names and
[1:35:04] so forth, but it's a real man of God.
[1:35:06] The Holy Ghost saved me. The Holy Ghost
[1:35:08] gave me this. The Holy Ghost is good
[1:35:11] enough for me to trust." He says, "I
[1:35:13] know if I just put him to action, it's
[1:35:17] his word. God will bring it to pass.
[1:35:20] Certainly, if you only knew what you
[1:35:23] know and put your faith to work, God
[1:35:26] will do the same thing for you. The God
[1:35:30] of Moses is not dead. The God of David's
[1:35:33] not dead. He says, "This God still
[1:35:35] alive." Amen. I'm preaching to you that
[1:35:38] the God of J Joshua, the God of David,
[1:35:41] the God of Brother Brandham is still
[1:35:43] alive tonight.
[1:35:45] We've seen him move.
[1:35:47] We've seen him heal. We've seen him
[1:35:50] deliver. We've seen him provide. We've
[1:35:52] seen him change hearts. We've seen him
[1:35:55] restore.
[1:35:57] We've got testimonies in every family
[1:35:59] here of these things. I know cuz I've
[1:36:00] talked to all of you.
[1:36:03] God's not dead.
[1:36:05] Amen. Notice David under this
[1:36:08] revelation,
[1:36:09] he did not stop to consider, but having
[1:36:12] given his testimony of who he was and
[1:36:15] that God was with him, he ran toward
[1:36:17] Goliath.
[1:36:19] He did not walk, tread, or tread
[1:36:21] carefully. He did not skullk, you know,
[1:36:23] just trying to duck, make sure that
[1:36:24] spear didn't get him before he could get
[1:36:26] in range. David ran towards Goliath.
[1:36:28] Church, that's what faith does. We don't
[1:36:32] have to stand back, treat it with kid
[1:36:34] gloves.
[1:36:36] We can say, "I'm a child of God."
[1:36:40] You're going down.
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:44] David said, "Everything you've said to
[1:36:46] me, Goliath, you said you're going to
[1:36:48] feed me to the birds and this one and
[1:36:49] that one." He says, "Everything you said
[1:36:51] to me, I'm going to do to you."
[1:36:55] He says, "Why? Because you've defied
[1:36:57] God.
[1:36:58] This ain't about me. It's about God."
[1:37:02] Amen. He went into action. He killed
[1:37:04] that giant. Church, David called his
[1:37:06] shot. I like what brother Grant was
[1:37:07] saying on Wednesday night. You know what
[1:37:09] David did? David prophesied.
[1:37:14] David called a shot. We know what it
[1:37:15] means to call your shot, right? Remember
[1:37:17] Babe Ruth? He's standing there and he
[1:37:18] take he takes his bat and he points at
[1:37:20] center field and then he comes back and
[1:37:22] he hits the monster homer, right? He
[1:37:24] called his shot. Mark Messier did it in
[1:37:26] in one of the playoffs or one of the
[1:37:27] games that was critical for them. I
[1:37:29] think it was a game six and then they
[1:37:30] went on to win game seven and he called
[1:37:32] his shot. He said he was going to score
[1:37:33] and he went and he scored. David called
[1:37:36] his shot standing and facing a 10-ft
[1:37:38] giant as a 15-year-old with a shepherd's
[1:37:40] sling and a stick. That's faith, church.
[1:37:43] That's knowing your commission. That's
[1:37:45] accepting your commission. That's
[1:37:47] trusting the power of the word of God.
[1:37:49] Amen. David doesn't God didn't come down
[1:37:52] to David and say, "Now, David, here's
[1:37:54] what I want you to say to Goliath." See,
[1:37:56] we think prophecy has to come lip to
[1:37:59] ear. Church, if you're repeating this,
[1:38:02] you're prophesying. Remember what the
[1:38:04] what the angel said to to John in the in
[1:38:06] Revelation 10. He says, "You must
[1:38:08] prophesy again."
[1:38:11] Same thing. The message doesn't change,
[1:38:13] but you got to put it on your lips. You
[1:38:15] got to take it in your life. When we
[1:38:17] take this on our lips, and it is
[1:38:18] anointed by God because it's the right
[1:38:20] time and the right season, we prophesy
[1:38:23] just by taking the word and repeating
[1:38:25] back what God has already said. Amen.
[1:38:27] David knew who he was. He knew his
[1:38:29] anointing. He knew his commission. He
[1:38:30] knew all these things. So all he did was
[1:38:32] say out loud what he already knew about
[1:38:34] himself.
[1:38:36] That's all God's asking us to do.
[1:38:38] Church, I've said it before. We have to
[1:38:40] speak to the mountain, not think about
[1:38:43] the mountain. Speak to the mountain. Say
[1:38:45] what you know about the situation. Say
[1:38:47] what you know about yourself. And when
[1:38:49] you speak it out loud, it allows the
[1:38:51] word to go forth. Because until then,
[1:38:53] it's a thought, not a word. But when you
[1:38:56] speak it, it becomes word. And what did
[1:38:58] go what did David say to Goliath? He
[1:38:59] says, "Goliath, you're a dead man
[1:39:00] standing and you don't know it. You
[1:39:02] don't know it." And what did he do? He
[1:39:05] ran towards Goliath. And Goliath got a
[1:39:06] taste of what prophecy felt like.
[1:39:09] He didn't feel much.
[1:39:12] Hit him in the head, knocked him down,
[1:39:13] chopped his head off. That's what
[1:39:15] prophecy feels like for Satan. That's
[1:39:17] why he's up in a tizzy because he knows
[1:39:19] his time is short.
[1:39:22] But I, if you notice something, and
[1:39:23] we're closing here tonight.
[1:39:26] As soon as Goliath gets knocked down,
[1:39:29] what happens to the rest of the
[1:39:30] Israelites?
[1:39:32] Right?
[1:39:35] All of a sudden, they're like, "I'm a
[1:39:36] child of God.
[1:39:38] I've got weapons. I got skills." No, you
[1:39:41] don't. But you're a child of God, and
[1:39:43] that's what matters.
[1:39:45] Enthusiasm will get you killed. Faith,
[1:39:48] on the other hand, will keep you alive.
[1:39:51] But notice, David knows who he is. He
[1:39:54] kills the the the giant and all of a
[1:39:57] sudden everybody's like, "Hey, I'm a
[1:39:58] great warrior, too." And they chased
[1:39:59] them all the way back to Gaza. They
[1:40:01] chased him all the way back to their
[1:40:02] capital city, killing them all along the
[1:40:04] way. Took all their stuff and then came
[1:40:05] back. Look at us. Yeah, you stood there
[1:40:09] for day after day after day letting this
[1:40:11] guy mock you. But church, all it took
[1:40:13] was one son of God reminding them of who
[1:40:17] they were and showing it by his actions
[1:40:20] that it was a reality in his life.
[1:40:24] I've said it before. Sometimes the
[1:40:26] reason you're going through this is
[1:40:27] because you've got faith to go through
[1:40:29] it and the person next to you doesn't.
[1:40:31] So, you're going first so they can get
[1:40:32] faith for theirs.
[1:40:35] That's why God picks us cuz he knows
[1:40:37] we'll go through it with grace. And
[1:40:40] we'll come out victorious on the other
[1:40:41] side. Amen. David didn't just recognize
[1:40:44] he was a child of God. He knew he was a
[1:40:46] child of God. Big difference. Why? He
[1:40:49] acted on it. when we look down at
[1:40:51] David's life and as far as we know he
[1:40:53] never killed another giant but what we
[1:40:55] see is that when you kill a giant other
[1:40:57] people realize that giants can be killed
[1:41:01] you know we see this in the sports world
[1:41:03] especially
[1:41:06] that there are records that people think
[1:41:08] will never be broken and then what
[1:41:10] happens is somebody breaks them and
[1:41:12] usually what happens is right after that
[1:41:14] a couple more people will continue and
[1:41:16] extend that record even further because
[1:41:18] nobody thought it was possible posible
[1:41:20] until somebody did it. And once somebody
[1:41:22] does, they realize if I just train that
[1:41:23] little bit harder, if I just go that
[1:41:25] little bit more, I can break it, too.
[1:41:27] And they just start to fall like
[1:41:28] dominoes. And you'll see records that
[1:41:30] people thought could never fail, never
[1:41:32] fall, get broken.
[1:41:36] Why? They realize you can do it. And
[1:41:39] when David killed a man that nobody
[1:41:41] thought could be killed, they realized,
[1:41:42] guess what? There's more giants out
[1:41:44] there. And if Goliath can be killed, the
[1:41:46] rest of them can be killed. You look
[1:41:49] through and and you know, we look at
[1:41:51] this and David, like I said, we look at
[1:41:53] him, we say, "Well, he's a king. He's
[1:41:55] got the spirit of God on him. He's got a
[1:41:56] special commission. He's a great hero.
[1:41:58] He's got, you know, he's a a man like
[1:42:00] unto God's own heart.
[1:42:03] That's the one that killed the first
[1:42:04] one." But I want you to look at the men
[1:42:06] that killed him, the rest of them.
[1:42:09] Because David didn't kill. There's four
[1:42:10] more coming. David didn't kill any of
[1:42:13] them. In fact, one of them almost killed
[1:42:14] David.
[1:42:16] But what I'm trying to show you is that
[1:42:18] it's not not many mighty,
[1:42:21] not many wise,
[1:42:23] right? The way the world looks at it,
[1:42:25] church, we're nothing.
[1:42:27] But when God calls us, it doesn't matter
[1:42:31] what we look like. Doesn't matter how
[1:42:34] strong or how weak we think we are. Some
[1:42:37] are called to more, but all are called
[1:42:40] to overcome.
[1:42:42] You look at this. These men start to
[1:42:44] realize they can kill giants. And 1st
[1:42:46] Samuel 17, David gets to goes to war and
[1:42:49] he gets knocked down by a giant, but
[1:42:51] Abashai jumps in and kills him. Kills
[1:42:54] the giant and saves David. And that's
[1:42:55] when they said to David, "David, you're
[1:42:56] not going to war anymore cuz you're the
[1:42:58] light of Israel. And if we lose you,
[1:42:59] we've lost everything."
[1:43:02] But you know what? That got David in
[1:43:03] trouble. You're not allowed to stop
[1:43:05] fighting, Brother Bob. Sister Brenda,
[1:43:08] you're not allowed to stop fighting.
[1:43:09] Sister Morin, Brother Mark, Brother
[1:43:10] David, you're not allowed to stop
[1:43:11] fighting, Brother David.
[1:43:13] Because when you stop fighting, you get
[1:43:15] in trouble.
[1:43:17] Amen.
[1:43:18] But what happened is Abashai, now you
[1:43:20] look at Abashai. Abashai is one of
[1:43:22] David's top. He's listed in the top 30.
[1:43:24] He might have even been in top three. I
[1:43:25] didn't look it up. But he's one of the
[1:43:27] mighty men of David. You say, "Well,
[1:43:28] there you go, brother John. Let's look
[1:43:30] at the next one." A while later, they go
[1:43:32] out to war again. They were they had a
[1:43:33] great giant as a champion, and now an
[1:43:35] Israelite captain kills him. Not one of
[1:43:37] the top 30. Maybe one of the top 100
[1:43:40] kills him. You say, 'Well, those are
[1:43:42] great warriors. I'm not. Look at the
[1:43:44] next one. In another battle, Goliath's
[1:43:46] brother comes out and now he's killed by
[1:43:49] a common foot soldier,
[1:43:52] just a regular grunt,
[1:43:55] not some big shot. He's only mentioned
[1:43:57] once in the Bible, and that's for
[1:43:58] killing a giant. He doesn't have any big
[1:44:01] rank. He's not a big leader in the army.
[1:44:03] He's just a soldier.
[1:44:06] And then lastly, this sixf figured,
[1:44:09] six-fingered, six-toed giant comes out,
[1:44:11] and he's the last of all of them. And
[1:44:14] then a nephew of David walks out and
[1:44:15] kills him. And look at what it says
[1:44:18] here. It says, "These four were born to
[1:44:20] the giant in Gath and fell by the hand
[1:44:23] of David and by the hand of his
[1:44:27] servants." Amen.
[1:44:30] What happened, church?
[1:44:33] someone got the victory and everyone
[1:44:35] else realized if they can get the
[1:44:37] victory, I can get the victory. And it
[1:44:39] just started to spread through the ranks
[1:44:40] until the lowliest of the lowest
[1:44:42] soldiers realized I'm a giant killer.
[1:44:46] I'm a son of God.
[1:44:48] I'm a sinkilling daughter of God.
[1:44:52] Amen. I'm a child of God.
[1:44:59] These men had the same commission David
[1:45:01] did. They just didn't know it.
[1:45:04] The common people have the same
[1:45:05] commission the prophet has. The ministry
[1:45:08] has. There's no difference. You're all a
[1:45:11] part of the same promise. We're all a
[1:45:14] part of the same promise. There's no
[1:45:16] difference between me and my wife in the
[1:45:18] eyes of God in terms of the power that
[1:45:20] is behind us to take God at his word.
[1:45:23] Because his power is behind his word,
[1:45:24] not just behind you. That's what really
[1:45:26] matters in these things. Amen. Like
[1:45:29] brother Bram said, the weakest of saints
[1:45:32] cause sat causes Satan to tremble.
[1:45:37] How long do you think those giants
[1:45:38] terrorize that land?
[1:45:41] Cuz this is 20, 30 years later and
[1:45:43] they're just still fighting and causing
[1:45:45] issues.
[1:45:48] How long did they let them live?
[1:45:53] How long do we let things go, church,
[1:45:56] before we say, "Not today, Satan.
[1:46:00] You've taken your last breath. You've
[1:46:01] had your last moment. You've been
[1:46:04] walking around my mind long enough.
[1:46:05] You've been walking around my body long
[1:46:06] enough.
[1:46:08] Time for you to get out. Time for you to
[1:46:10] die." Amen.
[1:46:13] Once one fell, the rest started falling
[1:46:16] like dominoes. Now 30 years doesn't seem
[1:46:18] like much
[1:46:20] but when they had been there for decades
[1:46:22] for centuries breeding and terrorizing
[1:46:26] the people and then in an end all of
[1:46:28] them taken down in one one one span of
[1:46:31] time it's a wonderful thing.
[1:46:34] The people took courage
[1:46:36] as somebody stood up and said
[1:46:39] we are more than able to take the
[1:46:41] country. Amen. God bless you. Let's
[1:46:44] stand.
[1:46:46] Brother Bram says God's just looking for
[1:46:48] one person. Just one person that'll
[1:46:52] surrender, that'll put themselves in his
[1:46:54] hands, that'll take him at his word,
[1:46:55] that'll let their faith go to work.
[1:46:58] Brother B says that's the way revival
[1:47:00] happens. He says one person gets their
[1:47:02] fire lit, and it goes to the next
[1:47:04] person, the next person, the next
[1:47:06] person, and you'll find it's not all
[1:47:09] these special people.
[1:47:12] I'm amazed at the ones that stand out in
[1:47:14] scripture, their names memorialized. You
[1:47:17] look at Mary of Bethany, a woman that
[1:47:20] was of ill ill fame. You look like a you
[1:47:23] look at the woman that had a blood
[1:47:25] issue, known for disease or known for a
[1:47:29] condition, and then she says, "I got to
[1:47:31] get to Jesus." And she touches the hem
[1:47:33] of his garment and she's healed and
[1:47:35] she's memorialized in scripture for the
[1:47:37] rest of time. Amen. You got a Roman
[1:47:40] centurion that comes up and says, "Just
[1:47:42] speak the word."
[1:47:44] He's just a centurion. He's just a
[1:47:46] soldier.
[1:47:47] It's just common people, church. It's
[1:47:49] not big eyes and little U's. It's not
[1:47:52] anointed men only. You're all anointed.
[1:47:56] You're all commissioned. You're all
[1:47:58] authorized. Remember what a commission
[1:48:00] is? Permission with full power. You've
[1:48:03] got permission with full power to beat
[1:48:06] up on Satan every single day. Yo, we try
[1:48:09] and teach our boys, don't fight. I'm
[1:48:11] here to tell you, we're taking we're
[1:48:12] taking the cuffs off this evening.
[1:48:15] Fight. Fight. Don't let them walk around
[1:48:18] on your land. Don't let them walk around
[1:48:20] in your mind. Don't let him walk around
[1:48:21] in your home. Stand up and say, "I'm a
[1:48:24] child of God. I'm a daughter of God. I'm
[1:48:26] a son of God." Satan, time for you to
[1:48:29] get out. And then start praising God.
[1:48:31] Start worshiping God. Start repeating
[1:48:32] the word back to him. That's what
[1:48:34] defeats him. Remember what brother Ram
[1:48:36] said when Jesus was tempted. He said he
[1:48:38] didn't use any of his power. He used the
[1:48:41] word and the word alone because the word
[1:48:42] has the power to defeat Satan anywhere,
[1:48:45] anytime.
[1:48:47] You got to know your Bible and you got
[1:48:49] to know that it's yours. Amen. You do
[1:48:53] that, Satan starts to tremble. Amen. God
[1:48:57] bless you. Let's bow our heads. Lord
[1:48:59] God, Lord, how thankful I am.
[1:49:03] How thankful we are, Lord,
[1:49:05] that from the least to the greatest,
[1:49:08] Lord. From the weakest to the strongest,
[1:49:10] from the least gifted to the most
[1:49:12] gifted, Lord, the only thing you're
[1:49:14] asking us to do is take you at your
[1:49:16] word, Lord. To just believe what you've
[1:49:18] said, believe what you've offered, Lord,
[1:49:21] and to act on it. So, Lord, I pray
[1:49:24] through this little service we've had,
[1:49:26] Lord, this humble thought, Lord, that
[1:49:28] you'd just inspire our faith. Lord, you
[1:49:31] see the battles we face. Lord, you see
[1:49:34] the things that keep us up at night. You
[1:49:35] see the things that cause our heart to
[1:49:38] just kind of clench and tighten at
[1:49:40] times. Lord, that takes away our
[1:49:41] appetite.
[1:49:43] Lord, you see these things that take
[1:49:44] away our peace and our rest. Lord, you
[1:49:47] see the giants that have been walking
[1:49:49] around our properties.
[1:49:51] Lord, I pray tonight, Lord, these days,
[1:49:54] these weeks as we move forward, Lord, we
[1:49:56] see the dominoes start to fall.
[1:49:59] Lord, that chains would be broken,
[1:50:02] Lord. That people would see the reality
[1:50:04] of you in their lives, Lord. The things
[1:50:06] that they've sought and prayed for,
[1:50:08] Lord. The things that they've looked
[1:50:09] for, the things that they have testified
[1:50:11] that they believe. Lord, Lord, I pray
[1:50:13] that you bring them to a reality of
[1:50:15] that. Lord, be with us, Lord. We need
[1:50:17] your help day by day. Lord, lift up our
[1:50:20] courage and our faith, Lord. Help us to
[1:50:22] just encourage oursel in the Lord to
[1:50:24] keep ourselves Lord in a right
[1:50:25] atmosphere Lord to dwell on the right
[1:50:27] things to feed on the right things Lord
[1:50:30] to look to the right things to
[1:50:31] fellowship on the right things
[1:50:34] Lord and just watch you come and move
[1:50:37] back up your word in our lives Lord we
[1:50:40] thank you for these things in Jesus
[1:50:42] Christ's name amen
[1:50:46] shout to the Lord 7:25 Five.
[1:50:54] My Jesus,
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:50:58] my savior.
[1:51:01] Lord, there is none like you.
[1:51:07] All of my days
[1:51:11] I want to praise
[1:51:14] the wonders of your might. Mighty
[1:51:20] love,
[1:51:25] my comfort,
[1:51:29] my shelter,
[1:51:32] tower of reuge and strength.
[1:51:38] Let every breath
[1:51:41] and all that I am
[1:51:45] never cease to worship
[1:51:50] you.
[1:51:53] Oh, shout to the Lord all the earth. Let
[1:51:59] us sing.
[1:52:01] Power and majesty,
[1:52:05] praise to the King.
[1:52:09] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[1:52:14] roar at the sound
[1:52:18] of your name.
[1:52:23] I sing for joy at the work of your
[1:52:28] hands.
[1:52:30] Forever I'll love you. Forever
[1:52:35] I'll stand.
[1:52:38] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[1:52:44] in you.
[1:52:50] My Jesus,
[1:52:53] my savior.
[1:52:56] Lord, there is none like you.
[1:53:02] All of my days.
[1:53:05] I want to praise
[1:53:09] the wonders of your mighty
[1:53:14] love. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:53:19] My comfort,
[1:53:23] my shelter,
[1:53:25] town ofu
[1:53:28] and strength.
[1:53:30] Amen.
[1:53:33] Hallelujah.
[1:53:34] All that I am
[1:53:38] never cease to worship
[1:53:43] you.
[1:53:47] Shout to the Lord.
[1:53:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:53] Amen.
[1:53:54] Power and majesty,
[1:53:57] praise to the King.
[1:54:02] Mountains bow down and the seas
[1:54:06] will roar at the sound
[1:54:11] of your name.
[1:54:16] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.

[2:08:19] Lord, is is ours, Father, to be able to

[2:08:31] just look at our lives, Lord, to examine

[2:08:36] hinder us, Lord. And Father, we just
[2:08:39] want those things to be burned away,
[2:08:41] Lord, by your spirit.
[2:08:43] And we're asking, Lord, that you just
[2:08:45] help us each day, Lord, to be more and
[2:08:47] more of a a reflection of you, Father.
[2:08:50] Lord, to just each day, Father, to ask
[2:08:53] you what you would have us to do, Lord.
[2:08:55] And knowing, Lord, we're just not here,

[2:09:00] here to just uh sit to the side, Lord,
[2:09:02] but you have something for each of us to
[2:09:04] do, Lord. And Lord, that's our our

[2:09:08] hallmark, Lord, of the children of God
[2:09:10] is that they're led by the spirit of

[2:09:16] to to seek that out, Lord. And I know
[2:09:19] you'll you'll speak to us, Lord, and
