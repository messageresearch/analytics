[41:17] [Music]
[41:32] here's
[41:33] my
[41:39] [Music]
[41:46] [Music]
[42:13] amen
[42:15] god bless you and then maybe see them
[42:19] for just a moment
[42:22] well it's really nice to be here with
[42:24] you and Newfoundland or
[42:27] Newfoundland
[42:30] depending on how you want to say it but
[42:32] it all means the same thing
[42:34] and
[42:36] it's really an honor and a privilege to
[42:38] be here and appreciate the invitation by
[42:42] but your pastor brother Geralyn and
[42:45] brother Mark and just been having some
[42:47] good fellowship in the last couple days
[42:48] and
[42:50] I guess this is my first time in this
[42:54] area I didn't even know you as part of
[42:57] Canada until I went to my
[43:01] weather map and was looking up the
[43:04] weather and it I was trying to put in
[43:06] st. John that kept coming up kept coming
[43:09] up Canada wouldn't say Newfoundland I
[43:11] couldn't figure out what was going on so
[43:14] I don't know if you're part of Canada or
[43:16] of Canada's part of you because I think
[43:20] y'all were in existence before they ever
[43:22] got civilized so then I got a little
[43:26] history lesson by brother Gerald today
[43:28] and and I found out y'all was the first
[43:30] this and the first that and the first
[43:33] this and the first that and so I guess
[43:35] this is the first place that that some
[43:38] of the explorers trying to find the
[43:41] other side of the world came to first
[43:43] and and I think this was a
[43:47] stopping off place for there for the
[43:50] early pilgrims and and those that were
[43:53] migrating over to the United States and
[43:56] and I understand you even got on a
[44:00] little
[44:01] settlement of the
[44:04] Vikings so you got a little bit of
[44:07] everything here
[44:09] but I
[44:12] pray the Lord will bless our services
[44:14] and it'll be something that'll
[44:17] be helpful to you
[44:20] because the time that we're
[44:23] we're living and we need you know I
[44:26] thought about Peter when he wrote second
[44:28] Peter and
[44:30] and he knew it wasn't going to be very
[44:33] long before he was going to leave the
[44:35] scene and he was looking how when the
[44:39] Lord had prayed over him and how that he
[44:42] knew that he was going to be bound and
[44:44] even knew the death that laid ahead of
[44:46] him and he said there was one thing that
[44:49] he he wanted to make sure that the
[44:51] people were established in the
[44:54] present-day truth and
[44:56] we want to be established in this truth
[44:59] we want to
[45:01] we don't want to be insecure
[45:04] we want to know who we are or come from
[45:09] we don't have to worry about where we're
[45:12] going because if you know where you come
[45:13] from you know where are you going Jesus
[45:16] never said you all are going to hell he
[45:19] said I know where you come from your
[45:20] daddy's the devil so if you knew where
[45:23] you come from then you know where you're
[45:24] going and so we came from God and and he
[45:28] said I come from God and I'm going back
[45:30] to God so then we that's what this
[45:34] message came to do because Paul said in
[45:37] he said there will come a day that
[45:39] you'll know even as you're known and I
[45:42] remember years ago brother Bisco was
[45:44] preaching and he said that were known
[45:46] he's talking about that it was to be a
[45:50] like a like a professor and he was
[45:53] teaching us students and then one day
[45:56] the students knowledge comes to the same
[45:59] level as the as the teacher that
[46:01] knowledge becomes the same
[46:03] and so and how that God knew us down
[46:07] through the church ages they could never
[46:09] they could never know how that they were
[46:13] known as God knew them they had a
[46:16] partial reach into that
[46:18] but under the opening of the word and
[46:21] and under the endtime message we found
[46:25] out now
[46:27] how that we were in him an attribute
[46:29] before
[46:31] before creation was he didn't create us
[46:35] we we came out of him
[46:38] because anything that's created has a
[46:41] has an end and so we weren't really
[46:44] created but we we were in a sense of
[46:47] creation but we came out of him because
[46:49] we were part of him because that's his
[46:52] eternal life and
[46:54] eternal life never has a beginning and
[46:56] an end
[47:00] sometimes you have to get you know I
[47:03] know that you've had some videos and so
[47:05] sometimes when you preach the first time
[47:06] someplace people have to kind of get
[47:09] adjusted to you and you know they want
[47:11] to see how you part you here we're kind
[47:14] of built buckle you got on what kind of
[47:16] shoes you wear and what kind of hubcaps
[47:19] you got and what your wife looked like
[47:21] you know usually that has a lot to do
[47:24] with what you are you know and they
[47:27] won't everybody get settled down and
[47:29] kind of get used to you then he can you
[47:31] can kind of preach but I'm 72 years old
[47:35] and I guess it was nineteen
[47:39] nineteen seventy three
[47:41] I was an atheist and
[47:45] my mother-in-law was a backslidden
[47:47] Pentecostal and she had come into the
[47:50] message just knew and the friend of hers
[47:53] that come out of Pentecost into the
[47:55] message and they'd been talking and
[47:57] she's rededicated her life and and so
[48:00] the Lord spoke to her and told her to
[48:02] come over to to our house and to talk to
[48:05] me and enter her daughter which my wife
[48:08] and dream is Janet and
[48:11] and so in two weeks I was saved in my in
[48:16] my home and from that day Lars never
[48:20] been it's never been the same
[48:23] you know we have our ups and downs as
[48:25] Christians and sometimes we get into the
[48:28] dark valleys and depression and and but
[48:32] you know there's one thing I find when
[48:34] you've had a true experience with God
[48:36] you might you might get disappointed
[48:39] and you know a preacher he always when
[48:42] he gets disappointed he he's gonna quit
[48:46] preaching and go find a bench someplace
[48:47] and said he never thinks about quit
[48:49] going to church but he just gonna the
[48:51] thread is I'm gonna quit preaching and
[48:53] I'm gonna find me a bench to sit down in
[48:56] the back somewhere and let off the
[48:58] pressure you know
[48:59] but I can't I can't think of one time in
[49:02] my life
[49:04] since I was saved that I ever desire to
[49:07] go back out in the world
[49:09] there there's nothing there's nothing
[49:13] there
[49:14] there's nothing but vanity and emptiness
[49:18] and sadness and disappointments
[49:21] and and so in
[49:26] 1973 when it was converted there in my
[49:29] dining room with my wife me and her both
[49:32] and
[49:34] we were baptized and come into the
[49:37] message and so this is the only thing
[49:40] I've known as a Christian and I've
[49:43] explored other things I've not lived in
[49:46] a box and I'm not I'm not a an ostrich
[49:50] type that when I would hide my head in
[49:53] the sand and be afraid of the be afraid
[49:56] of science and be afraid of other
[49:57] religions that I might see something
[50:00] real and
[50:02] but you know I've looked at other things
[50:05] and there's just nothing there
[50:07] there's nothing there every every
[50:10] religion every
[50:11] religion has a founder
[50:15] even even Buddha at the founder of
[50:19] of the Buddhists and and then when you
[50:23] have a founder they they they live off
[50:27] the experiences of that founder and then
[50:31] they they build supernatural tales
[50:34] around the experience that they that
[50:37] that founder had
[50:38] my boot in he said under a tree and and
[50:42] then they they build and fabricate
[50:44] things around that and then the founder
[50:47] dies and and they live off of that
[50:50] experience that that founder had with
[50:53] God and they never really have their own
[50:55] and I was reading that out of HG Wells
[50:59] outline of history and but he said you
[51:02] know Christ was not a founder
[51:05] he was the seed of Christianity
[51:08] [Music]
[51:09] so brother branham is not the founder of
[51:12] the gospel he was a prophet that Christ
[51:16] that God sent to you and I a mouthpiece
[51:19] we're not following a founder
[51:22] we are we are part of the scene
[51:26] we're not we're not following anything
[51:30] in that aspect we are that life made
[51:33] manifest
[51:35] and Jesus great power when he defeated
[51:40] Satan
[51:40] here when he came out of the wilderness
[51:43] and and Satan came and challenged him
[51:46] he defeated him because he knew who he
[51:50] was
[51:50] because it had been revealed to him
[51:54] but Brown said one day that he was
[51:56] reading in the scriptures and he read
[51:58] I'll not suffer my Holy One to see
[52:00] corruption nor a soul to stay in hell
[52:02] and it was revealed he knew that was him
[52:05] it spoke of him
[52:07] and that's where he defeated Satan
[52:09] because he wasn't insecure a person
[52:12] that's insecure when you're challenged
[52:14] by the enemy you feel that you have to
[52:17] prove something sometimes as young
[52:18] Christians when we go back to work we
[52:20] try to prove her a Christian and so when
[52:24] sank and challenged Jesus
[52:26] to prove who he was he didn't have to
[52:29] prove who he was because he knew who he
[52:31] was
[52:32] and as soon as you accept the challenge
[52:35] of the enemy and you step one foot
[52:36] forward to try to prove who you are he's
[52:39] already got you right there because when
[52:42] you're trying to prove who you are to
[52:44] somebody
[52:46] there's a there's a there's a there's an
[52:49] insecurity in there you're not only
[52:51] trying to prove it to them but you're
[52:52] trying to prove it yourself
[52:54] so we don't have to prove to anybody
[52:58] that were Christians we don't have to
[53:00] prove to anybody that we're born again
[53:02] so what God is wanting to do through
[53:05] this message is to establish you
[53:09] that you know who you are and not just
[53:11] by revelation but you know experience
[53:16] experience has a way of making the word
[53:20] real in your life
[53:22] when you hear he's a healer and you see
[53:25] people let her heal that's that's one
[53:27] thing you can believe that but when you
[53:30] experience it experience makes the word
[53:33] alive it's a it's an inner woman fabric
[53:37] of your Christian experience your whole
[53:38] life
[53:40] so brother Brown said you can receive
[53:42] the Holy Ghost without sensation but he
[53:44] never said you could receive without an
[53:46] experience
[53:48] there has to be an experience in your
[53:51] life
[53:52] some kind of an experience between you
[53:55] and God alone
[53:58] you don't have to prove to anybody who
[54:01] you are and God wants us to know because
[54:03] this is the time this is the time more
[54:07] than any other time in the history of
[54:09] Christianity or mankind that it says
[54:13] that we will know even as we are known
[54:16] so then the knowledge of God and the
[54:19] knowledge of the sons of God come up to
[54:21] an equal basis in that knowledge
[54:24] when Jesus said if you two know me you
[54:27] know known the father that's a
[54:28] progressive understanding as they as
[54:31] they walked with Christ and listened to
[54:33] his teachings and and then watched how
[54:37] the dead were raised in the sick were
[54:39] healed and if if their knowledge would
[54:42] have progressed their experience with
[54:44] him they were to realize to recognize
[54:46] that he was God in flesh
[54:48] he said if you don't know me you'd have
[54:51] known the father and that knowledge was
[54:53] a progressive knowledge so it all spoke
[54:56] of this in time because brother Branham
[54:59] and talking about st. John 1420 he said
[55:02] in that day
[55:04] you know that I'm in the father and the
[55:07] father and me I
[55:09] anoon you and I
[55:11] well down through the church ages the
[55:14] first part of st. John 14 why if you
[55:17] didn't know me you don't know him the
[55:18] father that was the deity of Christ
[55:21] that's been released and its fullness
[55:23] down through the church ages
[55:25] but Saint John 14:21 released in its
[55:29] fullness until the evening time he said
[55:32] that's this day so they had a partial
[55:34] revelation but by the opening of the
[55:37] word and then because it's time God
[55:39] anointing that word in your heart now
[55:42] it's it's not just recognizing the deity
[55:46] of Christ it's not just only recognizing
[55:49] the the the Godhead and being able to
[55:52] place that but this is the day of a
[55:55] manifestation of the sons of God we're
[55:59] not waiting for sons of God because John
[56:02] said now are we the sons of God but
[56:05] we're waiting for the unveiling and in
[56:09] that unveiling that's not just to the
[56:11] world but it's unveiling to you
[56:13] and it could only come through the
[56:16] opening of the word and god of inspiring
[56:21] that word into your hearts and I think a
[56:25] lot of what we're waiting for right now
[56:27] is the inspiration to strike the word
[56:30] and God controls that
[56:34] however much God leads your soul to
[56:37] believe that's how much that's how much
[56:39] faith that you can have and that's how
[56:41] much power that you can have and so
[56:44] there's things that we know he says when
[56:46] when she recognizes her position then
[56:48] she'll be gone well we recognize it in
[56:52] the word itself but there's something
[56:54] that God is not release to uni through
[56:58] faith he said we'd have accepted the
[57:00] great truths of the Bible but too many
[57:02] it's not made real because it hasn't
[57:04] been quickened so faith is the substance
[57:08] of things hoped for and hope is an
[57:12] intellectual faith an intellectual is
[57:15] not in a negative sense but intellectual
[57:19] faith means that you've seen something
[57:21] you've read something and you believe it
[57:24] you hold it in faith but that's not the
[57:26] faith of God it's when God quickens that
[57:29] hope and it becomes a substance it
[57:31] becomes a reality now there's no
[57:33] question there's no wrestling it's
[57:36] actually just put away and now you're
[57:38] moving on to something else you didn't
[57:40] actually forgot about it because it's
[57:42] real it's something that you hold on to
[57:45] so there's there's things that God has
[57:48] brought to us through the whole in other
[57:50] word but he hasn't quickened it into us
[57:53] yet because he waits for that time to
[57:57] bring the inspiration on the word that
[57:59] sent us now that we believe that we're
[58:00] walking into
[58:02] and we know that we're standing right on
[58:06] the on the threshold you open that door
[58:09] and there's a threshold right there and
[58:11] we're standing right at the threshold of
[58:14] the changing of time into eternity you
[58:19] know the judgments falling into this
[58:20] world
[58:22] our desires is as Peter to be
[58:25] established in this present day truth
[58:28] not in a dogmatism and not like an
[58:32] ostriches I just believe what the
[58:34] Prophet tells but by the inspiration of
[58:36] God into our hearts that this word is
[58:39] made real and life to you and me right
[58:43] in the reality of the quickening of the
[58:47] word
[58:48] and
[58:51] may we just stand together and we would
[58:54] just want to open up our Bibles I want
[58:56] to start and Mark or Matthew
[58:58] chapter 5
[59:00] [Music]
[59:09] this microphone
[59:12] it's got a green light
[59:17] is it did is it just not on
[59:25] and on my microphone you got a kickstart
[59:28] - Lord we'll get started
[59:41] okay
[59:48] but we're going to start in Matthew
[59:51] we're gonna start in Matthew 25 are 25
[59:55] in Matthew 5 in verse 17 through 20 and
[1:00:02] then what I would like to do if it's the
[1:00:04] Lord's will we want to
[1:00:06] I want I want to take Enoch as
[1:00:10] the as the bride that is to be
[1:00:13] translated not to resurrected bride but
[1:00:17] bride to be translated and then I want
[1:00:21] to I would like to take know in and to
[1:00:25] show the connection between the two
[1:00:26] ministries and then if the Lord permit
[1:00:30] then we can we can bring into that two
[1:00:33] third pull if we if the Lord permits
[1:00:37] that and so I want to start out here in
[1:00:40] Matthew 5 and the reason why is I want
[1:00:42] to minister just a little bit on
[1:00:44] righteousness and kind of get us all in
[1:00:47] the on the same page and you may have
[1:00:50] played this before but I'm not going to
[1:00:53] take a series on unrighteousness but I
[1:00:56] would like to just to speak because it's
[1:00:58] very it's very pertinent to Enoch and to
[1:01:02] Noah and really to all the things but
[1:01:05] but it'll tie in and so once that we
[1:01:08] build up a
[1:01:10] basis of language so to speak then we
[1:01:14] can refer back to that and it makes it
[1:01:16] makes sense to us without having to take
[1:01:18] so much time later on to build up on
[1:01:21] these words so in in Matthew chapter 5
[1:01:25] and this is probably just pretty basic
[1:01:28] in verse 17
[1:01:30] think not that I am come to destroy the
[1:01:33] law or the prophets I am not come to
[1:01:37] destroy but to fulfill
[1:01:41] for verily I say unto you
[1:01:44] till heaven and earth pass away one jot
[1:01:47] or one tittle shall in no wise pass from
[1:01:52] the law till all be fulfilled
[1:01:56] so I want you to know that grace
[1:01:59] did not come at the expense of the law
[1:02:05] because Christ came to fulfill the law
[1:02:08] that grace might take effect into our
[1:02:11] lives
[1:02:12] but the way that some people preach and
[1:02:14] believe grace today it come at the
[1:02:16] expense of the law but it didn't because
[1:02:19] the law had to be fulfilled and we know
[1:02:21] it's a law of redemption of what taking
[1:02:24] place in the Garden of Eden law
[1:02:26] so Christ didn't come to pronounce some
[1:02:30] kind of special blessing and and that
[1:02:33] we'd escaped in him but he come to
[1:02:35] fulfill the judgments and to pay the
[1:02:38] penalty and not to destroy the law
[1:02:43] verse 19
[1:02:45] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[1:02:48] these least Commandments and shall teach
[1:02:51] men so he shall be called the least in
[1:02:54] the kingdom of heaven but whosoever
[1:02:57] shall but whosoever shall do and teach
[1:03:00] them the same shall be called great in
[1:03:03] the kingdom of heaven for I say unto you
[1:03:06] that except your righteousness shall
[1:03:08] exceed the righteousness
[1:03:10] of the scribes and the Pharisees he
[1:03:13] shall in no case enter into the kingdom
[1:03:16] of heaven as we bow our heads Heavenly
[1:03:20] Father
[1:03:22] lord I thank you for your mercy and
[1:03:24] grace and and for your children your
[1:03:27] people that's gathered here together
[1:03:30] Lord as they gather at different times
[1:03:33] all over the world your living body your
[1:03:37] living organism that
[1:03:39] you've that you even more feed yourself
[1:03:42] that you have Tabernacle yourself into
[1:03:44] the hearts of your children and Lord
[1:03:49] together we make up a the temple of God
[1:03:52] individually we make up the house of God
[1:03:55] in the temple of God and we offer up
[1:03:59] sacrifices this evening of praising and
[1:04:02] worship and Thanksgiving and my prayer
[1:04:06] is Lord that you'd bless each one i
[1:04:09] bless these services if time goes on and
[1:04:13] you delay your coming and till the time
[1:04:16] that you have chosen yes Lord may we
[1:04:20] worship you until you come and may we be
[1:04:23] we be found Lord that when your desire
[1:04:27] was that when the Son of Man would
[1:04:29] return would he find faith and and Lord
[1:04:33] we want to have the faith as that that
[1:04:35] little little woman Lord that was
[1:04:37] contending continuing for an inheritance
[1:04:41] with that unjust judge
[1:04:42] the Lord we are contending for our
[1:04:46] inheritance as the children of God
[1:04:48] not contending with you but with the
[1:04:51] world it would try to withhold it from
[1:04:53] us
[1:04:54] but we've become we've become heirs of
[1:04:57] the world through the righteousness of
[1:04:59] faith
[1:05:00] Lord may you feed your your sheep
[1:05:04] tonight yes
[1:05:06] Lord as only you can feed on the meat
[1:05:08] without you we can do nothing and
[1:05:11] anything that we can do without you is
[1:05:14] nothing and you promised us in your word
[1:05:17] that wherever two or three would gather
[1:05:21] together to be in our presence so you're
[1:05:24] the center of our gathering tonight
[1:05:26] so father may you
[1:05:29] take this take this this evening in each
[1:05:32] heart each soul and and the voice and
[1:05:35] the ears may you take it into your
[1:05:38] control and may you
[1:05:41] establish us in this present day truth
[1:05:43] as only you can do we ask this in the
[1:05:47] precious name of thy Son Jesus Christ
[1:05:49] amen
[1:05:51] you may be seated
[1:05:56] you know we're we're gonna talk on
[1:05:59] unrighteousness tonight if we can and
[1:06:01] just kind of go over it a little bit and
[1:06:05] I know that you probably know a lot
[1:06:08] about it I and fellowshipping with
[1:06:12] with brother Mark and and brother Gerald
[1:06:15] I know that that this church is not
[1:06:19] probably liked the church that was an
[1:06:21] auntie you know that was an established
[1:06:24] church
[1:06:26] and
[1:06:28] and when when the church you know the
[1:06:32] first missionaries
[1:06:35] was the church
[1:06:37] so God ever writes another book of Acts
[1:06:40] you know who the last missionaries are
[1:06:42] gonna be it's gonna be the church
[1:06:45] because it says in in acts the eighth
[1:06:48] chapter
[1:06:49] that talking about when Paul went
[1:06:52] through there
[1:06:53] was really going house to house every
[1:06:56] house I mean he they must have had a
[1:06:58] good spy system you know they must have
[1:07:00] had some Judas's because he knew where
[1:07:02] to go they knew where to find him and
[1:07:04] hunt him up and it said in the church
[1:07:07] was scattered abroad all except the
[1:07:09] apostles they they stayed there in
[1:07:11] Jerusalem and it said the church went
[1:07:14] everywhere preaching the word and then
[1:07:18] Philip went down to some areas so the
[1:07:22] church
[1:07:22] you know preaching does not always stand
[1:07:25] behind a pulpit but he said preaching
[1:07:28] the gospel is to make the word work it's
[1:07:31] to demonstrate the power of the Holy
[1:07:33] Ghost
[1:07:34] so they they went out
[1:07:36] you know and the and the pastor and all
[1:07:40] the evangelists everybody stayed there
[1:07:42] in Jerusalem and they didn't run down to
[1:07:45] the store and start buying modern
[1:07:47] fashions and
[1:07:49] electronic gimmicks and games and
[1:07:51] televisions and computers you know
[1:07:55] sometimes you're afraid what might
[1:07:57] happen if the pastor passes away to some
[1:08:00] churches they just my goodness they
[1:08:02] start fighting fussing fuming scattered
[1:08:05] all over the world but but this this the
[1:08:08] original church when everywhere
[1:08:10] preaching work because it was a reality
[1:08:12] it wasn't it wasn't some kind of a
[1:08:14] social gathering
[1:08:16] under under a pastor that they had they
[1:08:20] were looking to in a place their
[1:08:22] absolute him you know it's good to have
[1:08:25] true leadership men and women that are
[1:08:28] borned again of the Holy Spirit and and
[1:08:31] the life of Christ God working in them
[1:08:34] but we each we each are offered by God
[1:08:38] to have our own experience and but it
[1:08:42] was at that time the church at Antioch
[1:08:44] was established
[1:08:46] and then we find that that Barnabas
[1:08:50] which was a prophet amongst the the
[1:08:53] early church and he must have been a he
[1:08:57] must have been recognized as a teacher
[1:09:00] because they sent him up to Antioch to
[1:09:03] instruct the church and to bring them
[1:09:05] deeper into the word and when he went up
[1:09:09] he went and we know the story he went
[1:09:12] and got Paul and come over and and and
[1:09:15] they together they they pastored that
[1:09:17] church so
[1:09:18] that church was established
[1:09:21] that was an established church and it
[1:09:25] had been established by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:27] and now Paul and Barnabas had come
[1:09:31] inspired ministers called of God and
[1:09:34] they were teaching that church for
[1:09:37] several years
[1:09:39] but you know when when Paul and Barnabas
[1:09:41] took their first missionary journey
[1:09:43] there was some there were some brothers
[1:09:46] that come in from headquarters ministers
[1:09:48] you know and they'd been you know how it
[1:09:51] is they were they didn't sit under John
[1:09:54] and Peter and James and and they had
[1:09:57] credentials they come from headquarters
[1:10:00] and they'd said under
[1:10:01] under real men but somehow they didn't
[1:10:05] have the message just exactly right and
[1:10:08] when they came down to Antioch and they
[1:10:12] were preaching and they were anointed
[1:10:13] and and they had a handle on that word
[1:10:16] and they'd set they had set up there
[1:10:18] under under those Holy Ghost filled men
[1:10:21] and they started teaching you couldn't
[1:10:24] even get saved till you got the Holy
[1:10:25] Ghost
[1:10:27] you know it turned that church upside
[1:10:29] down here it was men it already had the
[1:10:31] Holy Ghost already saved
[1:10:33] but you know this just doctrine come
[1:10:35] along and all of a sudden they didn't
[1:10:37] have nothing and that was an established
[1:10:40] church so we're never so established
[1:10:43] that Satan can't come in
[1:10:46] and if he comes in a lot of times you
[1:10:48] know you'll come in through
[1:10:50] personalities and and credentials
[1:10:53] but but we need to look to Christ and to
[1:10:57] the revealed Word and then if that
[1:11:00] person speaks he said they knew the
[1:11:02] early church was not was not a deceived
[1:11:05] Church they took those apostles that
[1:11:08] claim to be apostles and they they
[1:11:11] weren't like like Antioch they tried it
[1:11:13] with the word and they knew they were
[1:11:16] false prophets false apostles but they
[1:11:19] did leave their first love
[1:11:21] so we don't we don't want to be a church
[1:11:24] that's not deceived
[1:11:26] but we've left our love we want the love
[1:11:29] and the word
[1:11:32] because we've been promised everything
[1:11:35] so we in here that at Christ is is
[1:11:40] speaking and and we notice that first
[1:11:42] thing is he says that except your
[1:11:45] righteousness
[1:11:46] shall exceed the righteousness of the
[1:11:50] scribes and Pharisees these shall in no
[1:11:53] case enter into the kingdom of God so
[1:11:56] now one thing that we find here that in
[1:11:59] order to enter into the kingdom of God
[1:12:01] and the kingdom of God doesn't come with
[1:12:04] observation and it's not word early but
[1:12:07] it's in Word and power
[1:12:09] and the kingdom of God is the word made
[1:12:12] manifest
[1:12:14] because Jesus was standing
[1:12:17] amongst those Pharisees and they came in
[1:12:21] it said they demanded that he should
[1:12:23] tell him when the kingdom of God was to
[1:12:25] come he says well he said you know the
[1:12:30] kingdom of God doesn't come with
[1:12:31] observation you can't see it with the
[1:12:34] carnal of the natural mind or the
[1:12:36] natural spirit and he said the kingdom
[1:12:39] of God is is is among you and he said
[1:12:44] it's within you but he was talking and
[1:12:46] it was twofold because the kingdom of
[1:12:48] God was right in the middle of that
[1:12:50] group it was among them but the kingdom
[1:12:53] of God was in Christ because he was that
[1:12:56] word made first
[1:12:58] and so the kingdom of God is the word
[1:13:02] made manifest in every age
[1:13:06] but it's not recognized by man even
[1:13:10] though that they can see this now it's
[1:13:13] me on Jesus if my side comes would he do
[1:13:16] any more miracles in him
[1:13:18] well no but you know he breaks the law
[1:13:22] and so there was a contention they were
[1:13:24] kind of trying to figure this thing out
[1:13:26] he says it doesn't come with observation
[1:13:29] or worldly wisdom
[1:13:31] but it comes it comes by inspiration
[1:13:34] so he says you can enter in the kingdom
[1:13:37] of God without righteousness and now I
[1:13:40] find that there was a righteousness of
[1:13:42] the Pharisees and we're not talking
[1:13:45] about the righteousness of the Pharisees
[1:13:47] so much in a negative way because we
[1:13:50] know at that time that they'd been 400
[1:13:52] years without the voice of God without a
[1:13:54] prophet and so they had they had had
[1:13:57] great champions of faith they'd had two
[1:14:00] Maccabees they had fought they had they
[1:14:03] had delivered
[1:14:04] Jerusalem and they rebuilt a Temple and
[1:14:07] established the temple worship and we
[1:14:09] know it wasn't a dead time it was a time
[1:14:12] of activity and there was a time of
[1:14:15] great champions of faith but it was 400
[1:14:18] years without the voice of God
[1:14:20] so 400 years without the voice of God
[1:14:23] and when that time was closing the
[1:14:26] the priesthood was already in a bad
[1:14:29] condition because we find Malachi
[1:14:32] rebuking them and and teaching things to
[1:14:35] the church that they shouldn't have been
[1:14:37] teaching
[1:14:39] so we now we had 400 years without a
[1:14:43] prophet and we knew it gone it come to a
[1:14:45] condition that they were they were
[1:14:47] teaching the Bible and things but but
[1:14:49] because that they had they had
[1:14:51] introduced their traditions into it and
[1:14:53] traditions is is is supposed to be what
[1:14:57] they thought was spiritual inspiration
[1:15:00] there was the written law that was given
[1:15:04] to Moses that he wrote down and then
[1:15:06] they said that there was an oral law
[1:15:08] that there was things that God revealed
[1:15:10] to that he spoke to Aaron so we had a
[1:15:13] written law and we had an oral law and
[1:15:16] that oral law was he handed them through
[1:15:21] the through the high priesthood and
[1:15:22] through their priesthood and so then
[1:15:24] then the the ministry or the priesthood
[1:15:26] had a had a special access to what they
[1:15:29] called the oral law and then they had
[1:15:32] the written law now the written law
[1:15:34] never changed and the problem with the
[1:15:37] world law it had come to a time that
[1:15:39] that oral law which was supposed to be
[1:15:42] inspiration that came from God was
[1:15:44] contradictory to the written law
[1:15:47] but the people because it was a time at
[1:15:50] the after coming to Christ the people
[1:15:52] valued the Word of God and they were
[1:15:54] they were they were really applying
[1:15:57] themselves to the word and because they
[1:15:58] were they had a lot of questions and the
[1:16:01] Pharisees couldn't answer all that
[1:16:03] because they were so busy with their
[1:16:05] outward showing her prayers and things
[1:16:08] and not really digging into that word so
[1:16:10] it that's where the scribes and the
[1:16:12] lawyers rose up because they were trying
[1:16:15] to study that word and break it down and
[1:16:17] look at it and and they devoted their
[1:16:20] whole life to that to bring the answers
[1:16:22] to the people and so it had come to a
[1:16:26] time now that the oral law or or these
[1:16:31] interpretations of the law now held more
[1:16:35] weight with the people than the actual
[1:16:38] written word did but when Christ came he
[1:16:41] didn't go to oral law or spiritual
[1:16:44] inspiration he went to the word because
[1:16:47] the word is the absolute
[1:16:51] and if God sends anything to anybody
[1:16:55] it'll be his word because he sent his
[1:16:59] word to heal him and the saving from
[1:17:01] their instructor their destruction and
[1:17:04] so when Antioch had that that infectious
[1:17:08] disease coming in
[1:17:10] then they all gave their testimony video
[1:17:13] it was when James stood up and said and
[1:17:15] so agrees the prophets I
[1:17:18] will build again the tabernacle of David
[1:17:22] referring to the calling to the Gentiles
[1:17:24] so he said there so we're leaving off
[1:17:28] they don't have to speak in Qatar they
[1:17:31] don't have to be circumcised because the
[1:17:34] question was over the token so God sent
[1:17:37] the word by inspiration to James and by
[1:17:41] that word that was the absolute that all
[1:17:43] the testimony had been confirmed and
[1:17:45] judged by so if God sends anything he'll
[1:17:48] send his word
[1:17:50] and that's what he's sent in his last
[1:17:53] days he sent his word if he sends
[1:17:56] anything tonight or tomorrow the next
[1:17:59] day he'll send his word and when he
[1:18:02] sends his word he sends it to his
[1:18:05] children he'll quicken that
[1:18:08] so now we've got unless that your
[1:18:11] righteousness would exceed so now and I
[1:18:14] preached a little message and I call it
[1:18:16] progressive righteousness or
[1:18:19] dispensational righteousness because if
[1:18:22] I go back to Jeremiah 31 and in verse 31
[1:18:27] of Jeremiah 31 it says behold the days
[1:18:30] come saith the Lord that I will make a
[1:18:33] new covenant with the house of Israel
[1:18:35] and with the house of Judah
[1:18:38] see now right here that those that
[1:18:41] believed in circumcision the Judaizers
[1:18:44] that had come into Christianity could
[1:18:46] come right back here and point to this
[1:18:47] say that promise is to the Jews it's not
[1:18:51] to the Gentiles so they had had hundreds
[1:18:54] of years of
[1:18:56] Gentiles coming in being proselyte 'add
[1:18:59] and and and swearing that they would
[1:19:02] believe the law of Moses and then they'd
[1:19:05] be circumcised they came in as
[1:19:07] proselytes
[1:19:09] and so they had hundred years of this so
[1:19:12] they said in order now to be partakers
[1:19:14] of this of this new covenant it's given
[1:19:17] to two Judah it's given to the Jews not
[1:19:21] to you Gentile so if you want to be
[1:19:22] partakers of they had they had good word
[1:19:25] they could go back to I mean they were
[1:19:28] just not grabbing things out of the air
[1:19:31] because the Antioch Church was was a was
[1:19:33] an established church but when they
[1:19:36] brought those scriptures they could make
[1:19:38] those things look so real
[1:19:40] but it distorted what God was doing at
[1:19:43] that time
[1:19:44] I've heard people say well you couldn't
[1:19:47] get the Holy Ghost till you come into
[1:19:48] this message
[1:19:49] the Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[1:19:52] Pentecost and it ain't never left
[1:19:56] but how much how much power that you
[1:19:59] have you know the Holy Ghost is not
[1:20:00] waiting pounds is not measured in pounds
[1:20:03] and ounces and leaders and gallons it's
[1:20:07] measured in how much revelation has been
[1:20:10] released in your life and God controls
[1:20:13] that however much he leads your soul to
[1:20:15] believe that's how much faith that you
[1:20:17] can have that's how much power so
[1:20:20] truly we have
[1:20:22] more Holy Spirit by the measure
[1:20:25] revelation that's been released to us
[1:20:28] but but Luther had a hundred percent for
[1:20:32] his day
[1:20:33] because he's bribed when he died he was
[1:20:36] bribed he he can't be converted on the
[1:20:38] other side like the Mormons or somebody
[1:20:40] and he's not going to get the Holy Ghost
[1:20:43] become bright at a resurrection he's
[1:20:45] coming up in the resurrection because he
[1:20:47] is part of that bride so then he had to
[1:20:50] be bride when he went down or he'll
[1:20:52] never come up in the bride in that in
[1:20:55] that resurrection that second coming to
[1:20:58] Christ so
[1:21:02] he goes on to say here not according to
[1:21:05] the covenant that i made with your
[1:21:07] father's father's in that day and the
[1:21:09] day that I took them by the hand to
[1:21:11] bring them out of the land of Egypt he's
[1:21:13] referring to the to the to the ten
[1:21:16] commandments and the law of Moses also
[1:21:19] included the moral law the Civic law but
[1:21:23] are the civil law all of the law that
[1:21:25] was given to Moses was considered the
[1:21:27] law of Moses it wasn't just the Ten
[1:21:30] Commandments it was it was all that
[1:21:32] revelation that God had given to them
[1:21:38] which my covenant they break though I
[1:21:41] was a husband onto them saith the Lord
[1:21:43] but this shall be the Covenant that I
[1:21:46] will make with the house of Israel after
[1:21:50] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[1:21:53] law in their inward parts and write it
[1:21:56] in their hearts and will be their God
[1:21:59] and they shall be my people
[1:22:02] so now we've got a promise for a what we
[1:22:06] called a New Testament or our second
[1:22:08] covenant the first covenant is based on
[1:22:12] your ability
[1:22:13] to perform
[1:22:16] he's going to Road it out and now you
[1:22:20] live according to that standard
[1:22:23] and then he said now that the New
[1:22:26] Covenant is what I'm gonna do
[1:22:29] I'm gonna put it in your hearts I'm
[1:22:32] gonna write it in there
[1:22:34] so then the New Covenant was not what
[1:22:37] you were gonna do is what God was gonna
[1:22:38] do in you
[1:22:41] God is not calling you to a life tonight
[1:22:44] that's what the law did that's what the
[1:22:47] church does it calls you to a life it
[1:22:50] demands that you live a certain way it
[1:22:52] calls you to a religious life but God is
[1:22:55] calling to a life that's in you there's
[1:22:58] a seed that lays in there and he
[1:23:01] quickens that and brings it to life and
[1:23:04] he's calling to a life he doesn't cut he
[1:23:07] doesn't deal with his outer man
[1:23:10] he doesn't deal with the spirit he
[1:23:13] doesn't deal with the second man he
[1:23:14] comes through that but he's dealing with
[1:23:17] that inner man because once he has the
[1:23:19] inner man he's got the whole vessel
[1:23:21] because that soul that's been born again
[1:23:25] it brings that whole unit under
[1:23:28] subjection
[1:23:30] but man deals with the outside
[1:23:34] he tries to protocol you know but the
[1:23:39] gift lays within take a man that's
[1:23:42] called to ministry well the old school
[1:23:45] says now you sit down and and you sit
[1:23:48] under my ministry for a while until you
[1:23:50] get your doctrine and thing straight and
[1:23:53] that's fine it says let a novice you
[1:23:55] know wait on it's gift and then you
[1:23:59] learn certain protocols
[1:24:01] how to stand you know how to minister
[1:24:03] and those things and you start you start
[1:24:06] with the outside of that vessel
[1:24:09] but God doesn't do that he's made each
[1:24:13] of you different
[1:24:15] we come from different nations so then
[1:24:17] we with different nationalities and
[1:24:20] we've got different social upbringing
[1:24:23] and and God knew word that she was going
[1:24:28] to be born he know you're the language
[1:24:30] that you'd speaking he knew the color of
[1:24:32] your skin he knew all that he knew
[1:24:35] whether you'd be an introvert or an
[1:24:37] extrovert
[1:24:37] he knew whether you'd be a
[1:24:40] procrastinator or ax or a now person he
[1:24:43] knew everything about you and he's not
[1:24:46] trying to change the outer man
[1:24:49] God reaches past the outer man and he
[1:24:53] reaches down inside and cultivates the
[1:24:56] gift
[1:24:59] so it's not shaping the man on the
[1:25:01] outside
[1:25:04] its cultivating and bringing to life
[1:25:06] that man that's on the inside he said
[1:25:10] clean the inside of the pack clatter
[1:25:12] platter first so the laughlin cleans the
[1:25:16] outside right but it never touched the
[1:25:18] inside
[1:25:20] so Paul if we go over to Philippians
[1:25:24] in Philippians chapter three and just to
[1:25:29] save a little time Paul goes down as a
[1:25:32] as a Jew in Philippians chapter three
[1:25:35] and talks about being born to the tribe
[1:25:38] of Benjamin and and how that he was
[1:25:40] circumcised and
[1:25:42] Pharisee of Pharisees II he goes through
[1:25:45] he goes through his religious
[1:25:48] credentials as part of the the
[1:25:52] original Church we'll say part of Israel
[1:25:55] because she became to the
[1:25:58] the treasure chest of God's Word that he
[1:26:02] called them to be a priest in other
[1:26:05] words they were to be a priesthood to
[1:26:07] all the other nations and he poured he
[1:26:09] poured his word into them and they were
[1:26:12] to minister his word to all the other
[1:26:13] nations I
[1:26:15] think it's called a repository that's
[1:26:18] where you you deposit something you put
[1:26:20] your treasure things and so god they
[1:26:24] were the repository of god's revelation
[1:26:26] of who he was well he is here's the
[1:26:29] approach to him and the very ones that
[1:26:32] held it they were so meticulous in
[1:26:34] protecting that word and they could copy
[1:26:37] that word and they could write for
[1:26:39] Bibles and no air in there they were
[1:26:42] meticulous
[1:26:44] but they didn't know what the author had
[1:26:46] said
[1:26:47] so when it came time the very people
[1:26:50] that God had appointed to be the very
[1:26:53] treasure chest of his revelation
[1:26:55] rejected him
[1:26:57] and so it's repeated to get in the end
[1:27:00] time the church was the repository not
[1:27:03] just at the revelation but of his own
[1:27:04] life and when it came down to Laodicea
[1:27:07] the very ones
[1:27:09] that was to contain that life put that
[1:27:13] life from him Paul said to the Jews he
[1:27:16] said you judged yourself unworthy of
[1:27:18] eternal life because you put this from
[1:27:21] you God don't judge man man judges
[1:27:24] himself by putting forth or receiving
[1:27:29] sotol now
[1:27:31] he talks about his life under the law
[1:27:35] and in verse 7 we pick it up and he says
[1:27:39] but what things were gain to me those
[1:27:42] I counted loss for Christ
[1:27:45] they doubtless and I count all things
[1:27:48] but loss
[1:27:50] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[1:27:53] Christ Jesus my Lord
[1:27:55] for whom I've suffered the loss of all
[1:27:58] things
[1:27:59] and and that doesn't mean that things
[1:28:03] was taken from him like it was during
[1:28:05] the martyrs age he wasn't talking about
[1:28:06] things that had been taken from him
[1:28:09] he was talking about things that didn't
[1:28:12] mean anything to him
[1:28:14] the loss of all things not what would
[1:28:16] been taken from him well the church says
[1:28:19] I can't do this anymore and I can't do
[1:28:21] that anymore it was it was things that
[1:28:25] that he lost interest in things that
[1:28:27] that he once strove for
[1:28:30] now it meant nothing to him because
[1:28:32] because Christ had been revealed to him
[1:28:37] now the first part of Paul's life was
[1:28:39] striving for righteousness under that
[1:28:42] law
[1:28:43] because in Paul was a seed
[1:28:46] and that seed thirsted for God just as
[1:28:49] David thirsted for God and Paul thirsted
[1:28:52] for God and and he taken the avenue of
[1:28:56] that date to approach God he went to the
[1:28:59] the repository he went to the vault he
[1:29:02] went to the bank he he he went to the
[1:29:05] Pharisees the strictest of the sexes
[1:29:08] they their whole their whole ministry
[1:29:11] was to keep the church separated from
[1:29:13] the world the Sadducees they were
[1:29:16] Hellenized as they were they were
[1:29:18] modernizers they were mixing in with the
[1:29:20] church and been given political favor by
[1:29:23] the Romans that that it was the
[1:29:25] Sadducees that became the high priest
[1:29:27] but but the Pharisees we could call the
[1:29:30] fundamentalist
[1:29:32] but yet there was corruption in there
[1:29:34] but Paul didn't look at the corruption
[1:29:37] he taken that word and and they say back
[1:29:41] in those days there was a there was a
[1:29:43] tradition or a saying that if a man
[1:29:46] could keep all of the commandments one
[1:29:49] day for 24 hours that he would bring
[1:29:52] them aside and Paul longed to see that
[1:29:56] Messiah because in him was a thirst for
[1:29:59] God so he sought he sought the presence
[1:30:02] of God and without righteousness no man
[1:30:05] could come into his presence and so with
[1:30:08] all of his heart and all of his strength
[1:30:10] all the fiber of his body he he pursued
[1:30:14] God and that righteousness it would
[1:30:17] bring him into his presence
[1:30:20] but the closer he got the further away
[1:30:23] he got he was a driven man and when he
[1:30:27] found Christ in that Damascus Road and
[1:30:30] so how wrong that he was
[1:30:33] it was not what he could do it what God
[1:30:36] was going to do
[1:30:40] then he began a journey to set the
[1:30:43] captives free because he was in prison
[1:30:46] with him and now he had been loosed now
[1:30:49] he was going back into the prisons to
[1:30:51] loose them out of the prison house of
[1:30:54] religious dogma and Aaron
[1:30:59] only he could separate the law because
[1:31:01] he sought that righteousness with all of
[1:31:04] his heart all of his strength he wasn't
[1:31:07] a church member
[1:31:08] he was seeking him many times Luther's
[1:31:11] parallel to Paul's life
[1:31:14] the Paul sought him with all his heart
[1:31:17] and all of his strength and when he saw
[1:31:19] that he was wrong he was a can you
[1:31:22] imagine how crushed he was because he
[1:31:23] loved God so much and saw how so wrong
[1:31:27] that he was in his approach for that
[1:31:30] righteousness
[1:31:32] so he said I counted all those things
[1:31:35] dung and everything's a loss for Christ
[1:31:40] because now nothing meant anything but
[1:31:42] Christ and because that he was a sinner
[1:31:46] of his life he wanted to bring Christ to
[1:31:49] the rest of the people that there might
[1:31:51] be the center of their lives not him he
[1:31:54] knew that he was an instrument and God
[1:31:56] was going to use him to sow seed but
[1:32:00] only God could bring life to that scene
[1:32:02] but there were sores and there was
[1:32:04] waters but without God there could be no
[1:32:07] life just a church member with a new
[1:32:10] idea of new thought a new revelation
[1:32:13] the Christianity was more than 9
[1:32:17] it was a life of the seed
[1:32:20] Jesus said
[1:32:22] if this seed doesn't fall to the ground
[1:32:25] it remains alone
[1:32:27] but if it falls to the ground
[1:32:30] and it fell to the ground what was that
[1:32:34] scene it was deity wrapped in flesh and
[1:32:38] on the day of Pentecost that seed came
[1:32:41] forth in a multiplied form now deity was
[1:32:45] wrapped in in flesh in a hundred and
[1:32:48] twenty people in a church
[1:32:50] that was the seed that went down that
[1:32:53] came up sons of God made manifest on
[1:32:56] earth that had been lost down through
[1:32:58] time and he come to redeem that which
[1:33:02] was lost
[1:33:03] now to save
[1:33:05] if I have if I have something sitting
[1:33:08] here a glass of water or something in it
[1:33:11] and it falls and I reach down here while
[1:33:14] it's falling because if it falls and
[1:33:16] hits the ground it's going to break bust
[1:33:18] up so I reach and I stop it I've saved
[1:33:23] it
[1:33:24] but I haven't redeemed it I haven't
[1:33:26] restored it until I place it back from
[1:33:30] whence it fell
[1:33:31] that's Redemption this is salvation but
[1:33:36] it's got to be restored back to its
[1:33:38] original position to be redeemed
[1:33:41] God didn't come just to save us he came
[1:33:44] to redeem us he didn't come to create a
[1:33:47] new atom race he came to redeem a fallen
[1:33:50] race
[1:33:51] Christianity is not built on replacement
[1:33:54] it's built on resurrection that's where
[1:33:57] his great power was he said Israel I
[1:33:59] have created you for my glory now what
[1:34:04] is his rayul done as a nation as a
[1:34:06] people for his glory nothing but his
[1:34:09] great glory was manifested that he
[1:34:11] scattered into the graves to the nations
[1:34:14] of the world and he gathered him back in
[1:34:17] by his own power let it sound to those
[1:34:20] trumpets and bringing him back he
[1:34:23] glorified himself by doing what man
[1:34:25] could not do what a nation couldn't do
[1:34:27] they couldn't restore themselves they
[1:34:30] couldn't get their homeland they
[1:34:32] couldn't get the temple they were in
[1:34:34] bondage in you and I we're in graves
[1:34:36] dead in our sins and trespasses and he
[1:34:40] has created us to glorify himself now
[1:34:43] what the church can do not what you can
[1:34:45] do but what he is done in your life
[1:34:50] because he is a power and resurrection
[1:34:53] in life
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:34:57] it's not what you're gonna do it's what
[1:35:00] he's done in you
[1:35:01] he's not calling you to a life he's not
[1:35:04] calling you to a message he's calling to
[1:35:07] the life that's in you
[1:35:14] so he goes on to say verse
[1:35:18] 9
[1:35:20] and be found in him
[1:35:24] not having mine own righteousness
[1:35:27] which is of the law
[1:35:30] but that which is through the faith of
[1:35:33] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[1:35:37] by faith
[1:35:39] and then he goes on to say that now that
[1:35:43] word that
[1:35:44] refers back to what he's already said
[1:35:48] that is a conclusion I
[1:35:51] took this car I over hauled the engine I
[1:35:57] restore dit back
[1:35:59] new seats new radio back to the original
[1:36:04] I painted it I put windows sure that I
[1:36:07] might be able to drive it I did all that
[1:36:10] that that I might be able to drive it so
[1:36:14] he says and to be found in him not
[1:36:17] having my own righteousness
[1:36:18] which is of the law in other words the
[1:36:22] law was based on his performance
[1:36:25] he said unless your righteousness would
[1:36:28] exceed the righteousness of the law you
[1:36:31] can't enter into the kingdom now
[1:36:35] his life was blameless
[1:36:38] if I'd had taken the law and I would
[1:36:40] have examined his life by the by the law
[1:36:44] he would have been perfect but have been
[1:36:47] blameless
[1:36:48] but he still couldn't enter into the
[1:36:51] holiest of holies he still could not
[1:36:53] come into the presence of God with that
[1:36:55] righteousness
[1:36:57] but there had to be a righteousness that
[1:37:00] would exceed
[1:37:01] and he said it's the righteousness of
[1:37:04] God that which comes from God
[1:37:07] by the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:37:11] so then that righteousness comes from
[1:37:14] God it's not a man it's not of the
[1:37:17] church it's not of any earthly source
[1:37:21] but that righteousness comes from God
[1:37:25] which is the faith of Jesus Christ
[1:37:29] that
[1:37:30] why did he want that righteousness why
[1:37:33] why didn't he just want the cloak of the
[1:37:35] outside covering of the law why did he
[1:37:38] want that true license that I
[1:37:41] may know him and the power of his
[1:37:46] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[1:37:49] suffering and being made conformable
[1:37:51] unto his death being made conformable
[1:37:55] unto his death
[1:37:58] in Philippians 2 you read
[1:38:02] verse 7 of chapter t says but made faint
[1:38:07] itself of no reputation and took upon
[1:38:11] him the form of a servant and was made
[1:38:15] in the likeness of men and being found
[1:38:18] in the fashion as a man he humbled
[1:38:21] himself and
[1:38:23] became obedient unto death even
[1:38:27] the death of the cross
[1:38:30] so now if the scripture tells me to take
[1:38:34] up the cross and follow him and Paul
[1:38:38] says that I might be made conformable on
[1:38:41] his death to be conformed to his death
[1:38:43] not to be crucified not nailed
[1:38:47] but he humbled himself you know what
[1:38:49] humility means to submit yourself not in
[1:38:52] timidity but not my will I will that was
[1:38:57] the true humility of Christ is that he
[1:39:00] humbled his will to the will of God in
[1:39:03] his life he wanted to have children he
[1:39:05] wanted to have a family because the
[1:39:07] Indian was the attributes of God and God
[1:39:09] wanted to have children
[1:39:11] but he he suffered those things because
[1:39:15] he knew what is calling he knew is a
[1:39:17] creature of time he knew what he was
[1:39:19] called he knew what the finish was and
[1:39:22] he humbled himself he submitted himself
[1:39:26] to the will of God not my will but thy
[1:39:30] will even to the cross that he submitted
[1:39:32] his own life into the hands of God
[1:39:35] so what is true humility is not how
[1:39:38] humble and timid that you can be in all
[1:39:41] holy let me open the door for you true
[1:39:45] humility is to give God the preeminence
[1:39:49] his word preeminence even when it's
[1:39:52] contrary to your own will and desires
[1:39:55] that's the cross
[1:39:57] and he said that my life might be made
[1:40:01] conformable
[1:40:02] to the life of his death to the cross
[1:40:06] that I might submit my will to his will
[1:40:11] that's true humility
[1:40:13] and humility doesn't come without a
[1:40:16] crushing
[1:40:21] doesn't come without chastisement
[1:40:24] doesn't come without experience
[1:40:27] it comes from knowing him in a
[1:40:30] relationship not knowing about him
[1:40:34] but falling sick falling down and him
[1:40:38] coming and picking you up and delivering
[1:40:41] you from a prison house of unbelief and
[1:40:43] doubt that many have fell into the
[1:40:46] snares of Satan and fell away from the
[1:40:50] way of truth
[1:40:52] trying to find truth trying to find
[1:40:54] peace
[1:40:55] they didn't have an absolute
[1:40:58] they didn't have an experience
[1:41:01] so they went back looking for something
[1:41:03] else
[1:41:04] but the scripture says there ain't
[1:41:06] nothing else there's no other sacrifice
[1:41:09] there's no other hope and to turn him
[1:41:13] down and go for another sacrifice there
[1:41:15] is no other sacrifice there's no other
[1:41:18] blood that pays Redemption there's no
[1:41:21] other way into heaven except through
[1:41:22] Christ
[1:41:24] there's no accepting accepting his life
[1:41:26] in his death in his resurrection and God
[1:41:29] has accepted him
[1:41:32] so now we find that there's to
[1:41:34] righteousness one which is of God and
[1:41:36] one which is a man
[1:41:40] in Christ that unless that your
[1:41:43] righteousness exceeds the righteousness
[1:41:45] then he goes on he says you know the law
[1:41:48] said don't commit adultery and
[1:41:51] Paul did blameless
[1:41:54] but he says I say unto you if you looked
[1:41:57] upon a woman and lusted after her in
[1:41:59] your own heart you already committed
[1:42:01] adultery
[1:42:02] so now he was bringing it to a higher
[1:42:05] order of righteousness because now there
[1:42:09] was something that caused you to sin and
[1:42:11] you can harness that person you can
[1:42:14] harness your temper but when the right
[1:42:16] circumstances come and it's Unleashed
[1:42:18] what you need to do is be rid of it and
[1:42:21] only God can take that
[1:42:24] you can harness your impatience
[1:42:27] you can sit there inside tapping but you
[1:42:30] can come to the place that you sit and
[1:42:32] and you look also patient on the outside
[1:42:34] but on the inside
[1:42:36] you're running up and down and you're
[1:42:39] stomping your feet
[1:42:41] you know I've watched people that live
[1:42:44] in sin sometimes and they come into the
[1:42:46] church and the Holy Spirit comes through
[1:42:49] the ministry and strikes that and they
[1:42:50] come out they get mad
[1:42:52] but you know after a while they can sit
[1:42:55] there and they look at him and he can
[1:42:57] come right to their house right to their
[1:42:59] doorstep and you know man especially in
[1:43:02] this message just come under so much
[1:43:04] self-control you can just look that
[1:43:05] preacher right now I'd never never bad
[1:43:08] as I
[1:43:10] it's kind of like a child when he tells
[1:43:12] the first lie oh my that poor thing you
[1:43:16] know it's written from his head just
[1:43:18] told
[1:43:19] but after he's been caught he begins to
[1:43:22] learn he learned how he got caught so
[1:43:25] then when he starts to grow after a
[1:43:27] while you can't tell when he's lying and
[1:43:29] when he's
[1:43:31] you know it's like it's like the AIDS
[1:43:34] virus
[1:43:35] they've come up now with with uh not so
[1:43:39] much an antidote but they come up with a
[1:43:41] concoction that you can you can drink
[1:43:43] this and so it puts the AIDS virus kind
[1:43:46] of in submission not that it's dead or
[1:43:48] or dormant but then the outside activity
[1:43:51] of the body now you look healthy so in
[1:43:54] these areas where you used to go where
[1:43:56] they were where that AIDS virus was they
[1:43:58] look like zombies dark eyes and skinny
[1:44:01] and losing weight and just look horrible
[1:44:03] but now you go in those communities they
[1:44:05] look healthy but now the virus is
[1:44:08] spreading three times faster so
[1:44:10] when that opening of the word
[1:44:14] then they learned don't cut your hair
[1:44:16] you
[1:44:17] need to wear dresses man don't go to the
[1:44:21] bar don't go to pool hall and they begin
[1:44:24] to outwardly late look healthy but
[1:44:27] inwardly they have been converted its a
[1:44:32] deceiving age
[1:44:33] and that that virus is it's very smart
[1:44:37] you know where it goes to it goes to the
[1:44:39] white blood cells and the white blood
[1:44:41] cells is the immune system that's the
[1:44:43] Holy Ghost the immune system of the body
[1:44:46] is the Holy Spirit the body of Christ
[1:44:48] and it doesn't just go to the immune
[1:44:51] system
[1:44:52] it doesn't just go to the white blood
[1:44:54] cells but it goes to the memory system
[1:44:56] that that white blood cell is made up of
[1:44:59] a memory system from what I understand
[1:45:01] and and the white blood cells so you got
[1:45:03] the soldiers and you got the commander
[1:45:06] now the longevity the life of the of the
[1:45:10] memory system is longer than the
[1:45:12] soldiers but in that memory system that
[1:45:16] it tells the soldiers there's an
[1:45:18] invasion and it sends the soldiers out
[1:45:20] to fight that infection
[1:45:23] and the way that that AIDS virus works
[1:45:26] from what I understand it doesn't attack
[1:45:29] that it doesn't attack the white blood
[1:45:31] cells it it permeates it it goes inside
[1:45:35] of it and it kills it from the inside
[1:45:38] so when they tried to find the headship
[1:45:42] or the all that they could kill that
[1:45:45] virus he was in it was in the memory
[1:45:48] system and if they if they if they
[1:45:51] destroyed that then they destroyed the
[1:45:53] whole mewn system so it hit it it's just
[1:45:55] like the Palestinians in them and the is
[1:45:58] today whether they do they go into the
[1:46:00] hospitals and they hide their armor they
[1:46:02] they fire from houses and that's what
[1:46:04] the aid system did he went in there they
[1:46:08] went into Judas it's coming into the
[1:46:11] message and we're right on the pre
[1:46:14] pitiless in an age once at the last
[1:46:16] virus conquers the highest order of
[1:46:19] penicillin or antibiotic we got were
[1:46:21] right back to the pre pill and sealing
[1:46:23] agent were right on the brink of it
[1:46:25] this was God's strongest antibiotic
[1:46:30] they'll open another word to finish all
[1:46:33] sin that Christ that had to intercede
[1:46:36] for down to the church ages no more
[1:46:39] intercession because of all God's
[1:46:42] Fuller's of his antibiotic his truth his
[1:46:44] gospel has been unleashed
[1:46:49] and people are conquering it
[1:46:52] but they're dying inside
[1:46:55] they look healthy but they're full of
[1:46:58] adultery
[1:47:00] they're full of gossip and greed and
[1:47:03] envy and hatred but on the outside they
[1:47:07] can really mask that thing good because
[1:47:10] now they got the the word to dress that
[1:47:12] outer man with and to harness it but
[1:47:16] it's only harness sin sin is still in
[1:47:18] there God's not come to judge the outer
[1:47:21] life he's come to judge that soul and
[1:47:24] it's a soul that he came to redeem
[1:47:26] that's where he places his life and the
[1:47:30] memory system is the ministry by the
[1:47:34] Holy Spirit bringing back to your memory
[1:47:37] what God has spoken and he's invaded the
[1:47:41] pulpits like he did it Antioch he come
[1:47:44] and he invaded the ministry that came
[1:47:47] and spoke and took and took away their
[1:47:51] their immune system the Holy Spirit by
[1:47:55] losing their confidence and going back
[1:47:57] to an old system
[1:47:59] hybridize into that system
[1:48:01] [Applause]
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:08] to righteousness
[1:48:12] in Romans nine well just let's see let's
[1:48:16] move along here because we we want to
[1:48:18] use is that really as a platform to
[1:48:20] preach what we want to say
[1:48:22] Romans 9 and verse 31 we want to read
[1:48:27] Romans 9 and verse 31 but
[1:48:33] Israel which followed after the law of
[1:48:36] righteousness now the law of
[1:48:39] righteousness meant exactly the the
[1:48:41] pursuit that Paul had in his life
[1:48:43] the law of righteousness means that they
[1:48:47] were they were trying to attain to God's
[1:48:49] righteousness through the obedience of
[1:48:52] the law
[1:48:53] through their performance but we find
[1:48:56] that no matter how much blood was shed
[1:48:59] no matter how much they had a spotless
[1:49:02] life they could still not go into the
[1:49:06] holiest of Holies and Paul said what we
[1:49:09] saw the earth was only a picture of what
[1:49:12] was really in heaven
[1:49:13] because when Abraham and them died in
[1:49:16] the Old Testament they could not go to
[1:49:18] that sixth dimension
[1:49:20] they went into paradise which was in the
[1:49:23] fifth dimension because that gate had
[1:49:26] not been opened into the sixth dimension
[1:49:29] because there was no blood
[1:49:34] so what we saw on the earth
[1:49:37] was what being reflected in heaven and
[1:49:40] Paul said it was evident that the Holy
[1:49:43] Ghost hadn't made away into the holiest
[1:49:46] of Holies
[1:49:50] so Neil now Paul is writing here he says
[1:49:55] but Israel would and he's talking about
[1:49:57] himself because he knew what his life
[1:49:59] was but but Israel which followed after
[1:50:03] the law of righteousness
[1:50:04] hath not attained to the law of
[1:50:07] righteousness
[1:50:09] we're for because they sought it not by
[1:50:12] faith now I want you to notice here that
[1:50:15] it wasn't what they were seeking that
[1:50:18] was wrong
[1:50:20] it was how that they were seeking it
[1:50:23] the seeked of baptism of the holy spirit
[1:50:27] is not wrong it's how you seek it
[1:50:31] what they thought was good but how they
[1:50:35] sought it was wrong
[1:50:40] wherefore because they sought it not by
[1:50:43] faith
[1:50:44] but as it were by the works of the law
[1:50:49] for they stumbled at the stumbling stone
[1:50:51] as it is written behold I lay in Zion a
[1:50:56] stumbling stone and a rock of offense
[1:50:58] and whosoever believeth on him shall not
[1:51:01] be ashamed
[1:51:02] brethren my heart's desire and prayer to
[1:51:05] God for Israel is that they might be
[1:51:08] saved
[1:51:09] for I bear them record that they have a
[1:51:13] zeal of God but not according to
[1:51:16] knowledge revelation man's knowledge but
[1:51:20] not revelation
[1:51:22] for they be an ignorant of God's
[1:51:25] righteousness ignorant of his revelation
[1:51:28] and
[1:51:29] going about to establish their own
[1:51:31] righteousness
[1:51:33] not having submitted themselves there's
[1:51:37] that humbleness
[1:51:39] recognizing God the presence of God
[1:51:41] recognizes werden submitting yourself
[1:51:44] having not submitted themselves unto the
[1:51:46] righteousness of God so they be an
[1:51:49] ignorant of God's revealed truth had
[1:51:53] went out trying to find it and so under
[1:51:56] the power of man's reasoning they came
[1:51:59] up with their own answer but it was the
[1:52:02] wrong answer
[1:52:03] because they were ignorant of God's
[1:52:06] revealed word and so trying to find that
[1:52:09] revealed word they came up with their
[1:52:11] own revealed word
[1:52:16] but Jesus Christ is the end of the law
[1:52:20] for righteousness
[1:52:21] man's performance
[1:52:25] brother Brennan said if you repent and
[1:52:29] are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:52:33] then God is obligated to give you the
[1:52:36] Holy Ghost and if he doesn't it means
[1:52:40] you didn't come to a true confession
[1:52:43] so people that are seeking the Holy
[1:52:46] Ghost and could have it but because
[1:52:50] their own preconceived ideas of what the
[1:52:53] Holy Ghost is they don't believe they
[1:52:55] have it and some don't have it and
[1:52:59] because of their preconceived ideas they
[1:53:02] believe they have it I
[1:53:07] spoke in tongues
[1:53:09] yeah but you're wearing shorts and you
[1:53:11] go out here in bathing suits I've got
[1:53:13] the Holy Ghost and then a woman comes to
[1:53:17] brother Branson crying and I just I
[1:53:19] don't know if I got to hold he goes now
[1:53:21] he said here was a woman that had the
[1:53:22] Holy Spirit and didn't know it
[1:53:27] preconceived ID ideas
[1:53:34] so Christ is the end of
[1:53:37] the law for righteousness to
[1:53:40] everyone that believeth
[1:53:45] so now it has nothing to do with our
[1:53:48] performance so
[1:53:50] people that are seeking the Holy Ghost
[1:53:52] and he says you haven't come to a true
[1:53:53] confession they go back and I say okay
[1:53:55] just see I've repented of this and that
[1:53:59] I
[1:54:00] left that out
[1:54:03] in other words they're trying to come to
[1:54:05] a true confession or complete confession
[1:54:08] as the Catholic Church says right and
[1:54:12] after you confess and they probe into
[1:54:14] your mind in your heart and try to come
[1:54:17] up with secret things that they actually
[1:54:19] plant the seeds in your own heart to
[1:54:21] bring out so yeah that whoa yeah I guess
[1:54:23] that's right a true confession
[1:54:27] is in your heart
[1:54:31] it's not how many things it's not how
[1:54:34] many rocks you turn over because when
[1:54:37] you come to the end of that road and
[1:54:39] desperation and you say there ain't no
[1:54:42] other way but Christ that's a true
[1:54:44] confession
[1:54:45] till you become broken
[1:54:47] it's not it's not it's not like it's not
[1:54:52] like joining the church and apologizing
[1:54:55] but being crushed like Paul was crushed
[1:54:59] like you and I when we comin and it was
[1:55:02] snot and tears and crying maybe we
[1:55:05] didn't understand everything but down in
[1:55:07] the heart
[1:55:09] you know I always think of Abigail
[1:55:11] how she was married to neh ball and when
[1:55:16] you look that name up it means
[1:55:17] everything evil to call him it was a
[1:55:19] blockhead it was hatred jealousy
[1:55:22] overbearing everything that you look up
[1:55:24] that name she said his name was a fool
[1:55:27] and
[1:55:28] we were married to the law she was
[1:55:31] married to neh ball and the Bible said
[1:55:34] that she was a woman of a good at
[1:55:36] understanding and a ball said I don't
[1:55:39] know who this guy is she said David
[1:55:43] there's a man that's hunting and seeking
[1:55:45] your life but God has wrapped your life
[1:55:47] up in his name and when you come to the
[1:55:50] throne well she knew a lot about David
[1:55:54] because in her was a seed
[1:55:57] but her first marriage kept her from
[1:55:59] David they couldn't have a relationship
[1:56:01] they couldn't have a courtship and she
[1:56:05] was a woman of integrity and she wasn't
[1:56:07] gonna flirt with she come and she said
[1:56:09] let the guilt fall on me David I
[1:56:12] wasn't there when they told my husband
[1:56:14] these things but they came to me and
[1:56:16] told me and and I come repenting I'd
[1:56:19] take the guilt upon myself forgive me
[1:56:22] and she offered that offering up of the
[1:56:24] other sheep and the and the bread and
[1:56:27] those things and
[1:56:29] she went back
[1:56:31] and when they've all heard about it
[1:56:35] he turned his heart turned to stone and
[1:56:38] after about ten days God struck him and
[1:56:41] she was freed from the law of her first
[1:56:43] husband but
[1:56:46] she came to that repentance and when God
[1:56:50] brought you to that place of repentance
[1:56:52] there was a law in God's Word that Satan
[1:56:55] had to loose this hold on you and when a
[1:56:59] ball died and David heard now they could
[1:57:04] marry because she wasn't under the law
[1:57:05] the first husband and the Bible said
[1:57:09] that
[1:57:10] we're dead in Him
[1:57:13] the husband didn't die the law didn't
[1:57:15] die we died and so that law that first
[1:57:19] husband had no control over
[1:57:21] you can't walk up to him grave and said
[1:57:23] now you can't get married
[1:57:26] she's dead she's not under that vow no
[1:57:29] more and it said that we were dead in
[1:57:31] our lives are hid in Christ and he has
[1:57:34] hid us from the law
[1:57:37] because we died and now were married to
[1:57:41] him
[1:57:43] and the law has no power over us now
[1:57:47] because he taken all that was written
[1:57:49] against us that husband and everything
[1:57:51] and he nailed it to the cross
[1:57:55] because we actually died in him
[1:57:58] because we're part of him
[1:58:03] so Paul goes on down to save
[1:58:06] and it's good to go back and study it
[1:58:09] verse 10 he says for with the heart man
[1:58:12] believeth unto righteousness and with
[1:58:15] the mouth confession is made unto
[1:58:17] salvation
[1:58:18] for the scripture says whosoever
[1:58:21] believeth on him shall not be ashamed
[1:58:24] so it goes down and down in it in it
[1:58:27] well let me read it
[1:58:30] first 13 for whosoever shall call upon
[1:58:33] the name of the Lord shall be saved
[1:58:35] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:58:38] they have not believed and how shall
[1:58:40] they believe in him whom they have not
[1:58:42] heard and how shall they hear without a
[1:58:45] cheat without a preacher and how shall
[1:58:48] they preach except they be sent as it is
[1:58:52] written how beautiful are the feet of
[1:58:53] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[1:58:55] bring glad tidings of good things
[1:58:58] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[1:59:03] for Isaiah saith Lord who has believed
[1:59:07] our report
[1:59:08] so then faith cometh by hearing and
[1:59:12] hearing by the word of God
[1:59:15] so then Paul also writes in Hebrews 4 he
[1:59:20] said they all heard the gospel under
[1:59:22] Moses right
[1:59:24] but he said but it didn't profit many of
[1:59:27] them it didn't benefit them
[1:59:29] because it wasn't mixed with faith and
[1:59:32] that word mixed is like married to it it
[1:59:35] becomes one it's not two elements like
[1:59:38] oil and water and you mix it up but it's
[1:59:41] two elements that become one element a
[1:59:44] marriage becomes one
[1:59:46] and when faith faith is married to that
[1:59:50] word it becomes one it becomes the
[1:59:52] inspired word he comes reality so you go
[1:59:57] back to Deuteronomy 29 and he says he
[2:00:00] said look he said go back and look what
[2:00:02] I did to the Egyptians look back what I
[2:00:04] did there in Egypt look at your shoes
[2:00:07] all of you Nathan look at your shoes
[2:00:09] Cara Moses Joshua everyone you look at
[2:00:13] your shoes they haven't wore out you
[2:00:15] ever thought about that and wore out
[2:00:16] honey hey you know he's right we've been
[2:00:19] a lot of miles didn't work so look at
[2:00:21] your clothes he said well you're right
[2:00:23] he said remember when you're hungry and
[2:00:26] I fed you when he was thirsty I i
[2:00:28] watered you but yet I
[2:00:32] God speaking I have not given you a
[2:00:35] heart to perceive and that word precede
[2:00:39] means to be understand a heart but the
[2:00:42] heart man believeth
[2:00:44] but Josh when Caleb they believed
[2:00:47] because they had been inspired by God
[2:00:50] back down there in Egypt but to the rest
[2:00:54] they weren't inspired they walked in the
[2:00:56] message they looked at the message they
[2:00:58] per took the blessings of the message
[2:01:00] they said under the inspired preaching
[2:01:02] of the messenger but because it was not
[2:01:05] inspired when they came to Katie's
[2:01:07] Bardia they could not trust God with
[2:01:10] their lives he said I did all this that
[2:01:14] you might know that I am the Lord your
[2:01:16] God
[2:01:18] but they couldn't recognize it they
[2:01:20] couldn't believe it
[2:01:23] and they fell away
[2:01:30] so then hearing the word
[2:01:34] is not faith
[2:01:38] hearing of the word is not faith but you
[2:01:41] can't have faith without hearing the
[2:01:42] word
[2:01:44] because faith cometh by hearing
[2:01:48] but hearing is not faith
[2:01:51] everybody that hears the word doesn't
[2:01:54] walk out of here with faith
[2:01:56] but those that it's inspired to by the
[2:01:59] Holy Spirit
[2:02:00] it becomes married to them it becomes
[2:02:03] faith it's the substance of things
[2:02:06] learned it's the substance of things
[2:02:08] it's the reality of God's presence and
[2:02:11] power
[2:02:13] so hearing the word is not faith
[2:02:16] but you can't have faith without hearing
[2:02:19] now wait a minute you can't hear unless
[2:02:23] there be a preacher and he can't preach
[2:02:27] unless he's sent of God because faith
[2:02:32] cometh by the hearing and hearing that
[2:02:35] word hearing he says that means hearing
[2:02:38] the word of God it doesn't mean just
[2:02:39] hearing but hearing the word then God
[2:02:42] has to supply that word that you might
[2:02:47] have faith but even if he supplies that
[2:02:49] word to you you can't have faith until
[2:02:53] he inspires it to you
[2:02:54] [Applause]
[2:02:57] until he inspires it quickens it to you
[2:03:01] by the Holy Spirit it's not faith
[2:03:05] so then God has to first supply that
[2:03:08] word before that you can even have faith
[2:03:11] and
[2:03:13] because that he supplies that word
[2:03:15] doesn't mean that you have faith because
[2:03:17] all it heard didn't obey they didn't
[2:03:20] believe
[2:03:22] when they came to caters Bardia they
[2:03:24] said let's see if we go across we die if
[2:03:29] we stay here we live we going across
[2:03:35] Joshua said Caleb said God deliver us
[2:03:39] out of Egypt look at his power look he
[2:03:42] destroyed the enemy at the Red Sea he's
[2:03:45] God we're his children
[2:03:46] we're in a time of inheritance and it's
[2:03:50] a fulfillment of his promise and we're
[2:03:52] the children of that promise and he is
[2:03:55] our defense he'll deliver the enemy and
[2:03:58] my inspiration they said we can take it
[2:04:03] because they were looking at God's power
[2:04:06] that had been revealed to them but to
[2:04:09] the rest it was only a hope it wasn't
[2:04:11] faith
[2:04:12] it wasn't a substance it was a thing
[2:04:15] they fed off until they came to the
[2:04:17] crossing and when it came to the
[2:04:19] crossing they couldn't believe they
[2:04:21] couldn't they couldn't humble themselves
[2:04:23] they couldn't take up the cross they
[2:04:25] couldn't if a man seeks to save his life
[2:04:27] you'll lose it
[2:04:29] but if he's willing to lose it he'll
[2:04:32] save it
[2:04:33] because Christ is the one that holds
[2:04:36] that life it's not me it's not you it's
[2:04:39] not the doctor God uses doctors he uses
[2:04:42] you and me for one another but it's God
[2:04:45] that brings life it's God that heals
[2:04:48] and the only allowed man to break into
[2:04:50] his laboratory of healing
[2:04:53] been merciful upon the people
[2:04:57] I'm the LORD thy God that heal all thy
[2:04:59] diseases
[2:05:03] now let's look at a couple examples and
[2:05:05] then we'll just we'll close but let's
[2:05:08] let's go to Hebrews 11 and
[2:05:11] in Hebrews 11
[2:05:18] we're trying to build so that we can
[2:05:21] that we can come back now and
[2:05:24] take a look at at Enoch and Noah
[2:05:28] but in Hebrews 11
[2:05:31] it says now faith is the substance of
[2:05:37] those things hope for and it's the
[2:05:40] evidence of those things not seen
[2:05:43] so then those things that are not seen
[2:05:46] faith looks at it and it receives that
[2:05:49] he goes on to to go through the through
[2:05:52] the heroes of faith this old chapters on
[2:05:54] faith and faith is a revelation from God
[2:05:57] and righteousness comes through faith
[2:06:00] and that's what we're talking about
[2:06:03] tonight
[2:06:06] for by it the elders obtained a good
[2:06:08] report through faith we understand that
[2:06:11] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[2:06:13] God and so that things which are seen
[2:06:15] were not made of things which do appear
[2:06:18] now look by faith Abel offered up on to
[2:06:22] God a more excellent sacrifice and Cain
[2:06:25] so that tells me that Cain had an
[2:06:29] excellent sacrifice
[2:06:31] because he had a more excellent
[2:06:33] sacrifice
[2:06:34] so we could put it this way as an
[2:06:37] example
[2:06:38] Cain came with the firstfruits and he
[2:06:42] was testifying that there would come a
[2:06:44] resurrection that was an excellent
[2:06:47] revelation firstfruits testifying of a
[2:06:50] resurrection
[2:06:51] but now Abel came with blood
[2:06:54] because without blood that resurrection
[2:06:58] brings us to a judgment
[2:06:59] so then he came with the blood that
[2:07:02] applies in atonement that when we come
[2:07:05] in that resurrection we have an advocate
[2:07:08] so his was more excellent
[2:07:15] so Abel
[2:07:18] by faith
[2:07:21] so now for able to have faith God had to
[2:07:25] supply some word
[2:07:27] because you can't have faith no matter
[2:07:29] where we go in the scriptures now we
[2:07:31] know that faith cometh by the hearing of
[2:07:33] the word of God and God has to supply
[2:07:36] that word
[2:07:38] he has to supply that to man that he
[2:07:41] might have faith and yet he can't have
[2:07:43] faith unless he inspires him so
[2:07:46] somewhere god supplied that word to Abel
[2:07:50] and inspired it to him
[2:07:53] and he taken a lamb and he offered it up
[2:07:56] as a sacrifice that blood of that lamb
[2:07:59] didn't do nothing for him
[2:08:02] there was no righteousness in that blood
[2:08:06] of that lamb that he shed
[2:08:09] it said that that sacrifice gave
[2:08:13] testimony
[2:08:15] that he was righteous
[2:08:18] it was only a testimony of his
[2:08:21] revelation
[2:08:23] the faith is what gave him the
[2:08:25] righteousness because remember that Adam
[2:08:29] in in Chapter in chapter 5 of
[2:08:33] Genesis you read it it says an Adam was
[2:08:37] created in the image of God and after
[2:08:40] the image of God or likeness of God Adam
[2:08:42] was created
[2:08:44] so eNOS
[2:08:47] his daddy was was Seth eNOS Seth and his
[2:08:53] daddy
[2:08:55] was Adam and
[2:08:58] his daddy was gone
[2:09:02] but it said that when Adam brought forth
[2:09:05] Seth
[2:09:07] he brought forth his son in his own
[2:09:10] image oh now something's happened
[2:09:13] because Adam was created in the image of
[2:09:16] God but when the Adam brought forth a
[2:09:17] child it was in his image
[2:09:22] now if he hadn't sinned and he would
[2:09:27] have retained the power of the spoken
[2:09:29] word
[2:09:30] then when the inspiration struck him he
[2:09:33] would have spoke that germ and that egg
[2:09:35] in the womb of Eve and she would have
[2:09:38] had a child because that's the way
[2:09:41] Christ came
[2:09:42] and that would have been what it
[2:09:45] wouldn't have been the son of Adam it
[2:09:47] would have been the son of God the
[2:09:49] spoken word
[2:09:50] and Adam would have come forth a baby
[2:09:52] and he would have groped till he got to
[2:09:54] about 24 that's all the older he would
[2:09:58] ever gone
[2:09:59] because the seed would come to its
[2:10:01] maturity and there was no downhill ride
[2:10:05] on death
[2:10:07] but he lost the power spoken word
[2:10:11] so he began to multiply like animal life
[2:10:15] and it brought forth human beings that
[2:10:18] were dominated by the second dream and
[2:10:20] not the first rim not the soul but the
[2:10:22] spirit and so every man that was born
[2:10:26] was born in the image of
[2:10:29] Adam a fallen son of God because
[2:10:33] everyone came forth in His image in all
[2:10:35] we all died in Adam
[2:10:38] so we know that when Abel came for he
[2:10:43] was in the image of Adam a fallen man
[2:10:46] if he had been a son of God he wouldn't
[2:10:49] have needed a sacrifice he could have
[2:10:51] walked right into the holiest of holies
[2:10:54] but he did not have the righteousness to
[2:10:57] go through that veil it would have been
[2:10:59] death and so Cain had a revelation it
[2:11:04] would take a sacrifice and there had to
[2:11:05] be an altar but it was it was own
[2:11:09] interpretation it was his old I did it
[2:11:12] wasn't completely wrong but there was a
[2:11:14] secret element that God didn't reveal to
[2:11:17] him
[2:11:18] he knew there was a resurrection he knew
[2:11:20] there was an altar but he offered up the
[2:11:23] law he offered up his own ability but
[2:11:26] God had a secret and he revealed that
[2:11:29] secret to Abel that it wouldn't be man
[2:11:32] but every God that would deliver man in
[2:11:34] a man
[2:11:39] and so by faith
[2:11:42] not by the sacrifice
[2:11:45] he obtained righteousness before God
[2:11:49] Joel we went on to read about Jobe he
[2:11:52] was perfect upright the word upright
[2:11:54] means righteous and he was just like
[2:11:57] every man born in sin where did he get
[2:11:59] his righteousness from
[2:12:00] where did he get his perfection from
[2:12:03] where did he get his sinlessness tongue
[2:12:05] from his unblemished God said he's
[2:12:07] righteous before me where did he get it
[2:12:10] from
[2:12:11] brother Brent said he was a prophet
[2:12:14] so he looked up into the word because
[2:12:17] the first Bible is there's a creation
[2:12:19] god expressing himself in creation
[2:12:23] when you write there's people can take a
[2:12:26] letter that you write they can tell you
[2:12:28] everything about you
[2:12:30] because there's something the way you
[2:12:32] write you're expressing part of your
[2:12:34] character
[2:12:34] there's people that study how you dress
[2:12:37] the shoes that you wear colors that you
[2:12:39] wear clothes that you wear and they they
[2:12:42] can tell you everything about you
[2:12:44] there's people they say well what's done
[2:12:47] what what what day were you born what
[2:12:48] time of the morning even in afternoon I
[2:12:51] tell you everything about you why
[2:12:52] because everything that we personify
[2:12:55] everything we expresses is an expression
[2:12:57] of our character the way we talk they
[2:13:01] listen to you how the hundreds of the
[2:13:03] heart the mouth speaketh and so God when
[2:13:06] he created he was expressed and he could
[2:13:08] not create without expressing himself
[2:13:10] attributes of himself so job looked up
[2:13:14] into that Bible as complicated as it was
[2:13:17] as many stars
[2:13:19] but God inspired him and focused him on
[2:13:22] something and he and he caught a
[2:13:24] revelation that
[2:13:25] it was through the shedding of blood
[2:13:28] that would be the forgiveness of sins
[2:13:29] and we know that because when he offered
[2:13:33] up the sacrifice for himself and then he
[2:13:36] offered it up for his children just in
[2:13:38] case they committed some secret sin so
[2:13:41] the sacrifice pertained to sin but there
[2:13:44] was a secret element that he didn't know
[2:13:46] yet what happens when man
[2:13:50] sure enough God forgives sins and he was
[2:13:53] tested and tried
[2:13:55] because the church the Deacons when they
[2:13:58] come down the church theology and it was
[2:14:01] true that when men sinned God judges man
[2:14:05] but they didn't have the elevation of
[2:14:09] Revelation a job had that there was a
[2:14:11] forgiveness of sin and if God forgives
[2:14:14] sin he does not judge men according to
[2:14:17] that
[2:14:18] but yet it looked like he was being
[2:14:20] judged they came with the church
[2:14:23] doctrine they said look at your sons can
[2:14:26] you done either did no your daughter's
[2:14:29] can you deny your fences your cattle
[2:14:31] look at all they pointed gods judging
[2:14:34] you because God judges sin and they came
[2:14:39] and they had all our theology and all
[2:14:41] our scriptures and joke looked at it and
[2:14:44] his wife come
[2:14:46] showed him all the things around the
[2:14:48] house he hadn't done how come you never
[2:14:50] run the crime ruling you you say you
[2:14:51] don't finish this bedroom but Jane even
[2:14:53] painted the walls yet and the fences are
[2:14:56] tore down and and look at this and look
[2:14:58] at that and by turn she got through with
[2:15:01] him she says
[2:15:02] now
[2:15:05] do you maintain your integrity and that
[2:15:07] word means innocent see you know she
[2:15:09] knows all the secrets of his life
[2:15:12] those when the pastor comes home said oh
[2:15:14] I just don't know what to do Bunnie o
[2:15:17] church you know and you know she knows
[2:15:20] all his frustrations she knows when he
[2:15:23] loses this temper when he gets angry she
[2:15:26] knows everything about him and then when
[2:15:28] she got through she says now do you
[2:15:32] maintain your innocence e your integrity
[2:15:35] and he was sitting there and after all
[2:15:37] what the church told him what she told
[2:15:39] him he's hot hold man you know he's
[2:15:41] probably about that high he probably
[2:15:43] could have crawled under a rock like
[2:15:45] they say and he just looked over at that
[2:15:48] sacrifice and that revelation he had he
[2:15:52] said yes I do
[2:15:54] because before God he revealed to me
[2:15:57] that through that sack I know the
[2:15:59] evidence doesn't look like it but I
[2:16:02] believe what he revealed to me
[2:16:04] that that blood didn't do nothing for
[2:16:08] job it didn't give him no righteousness
[2:16:10] it was only the testimony what the heart
[2:16:12] man believeth what the mouth he speaketh
[2:16:16] on the salvation with a hearty believes
[2:16:19] and with that expression of that
[2:16:21] sacrifice of that revelation but the
[2:16:24] righteousness came because God chose him
[2:16:26] and revealed to him his word that had
[2:16:30] taken it taken the shedding of blood
[2:16:33] but there was an element he didn't know
[2:16:35] there was yet a further opening of the
[2:16:38] word 1/7 feel sort of the speak
[2:16:41] because now you come down to the place
[2:16:43] that he had boils and he now it was not
[2:16:47] only his children but now it was him had
[2:16:49] come down to the front door and
[2:16:52] he thought
[2:16:53] he said oh if I just knew where his seat
[2:16:56] was if I knew where throne was I'd go
[2:16:59] knock on his door I want to talk to him
[2:17:02] and he was that real that he said if I
[2:17:04] just know what trees behind if I know
[2:17:06] where his seed is this tone is I would
[2:17:09] knock he was real to joke he was so real
[2:17:13] to him he said if I could just find him
[2:17:15] I'd want to speak to him
[2:17:19] and God didn't reveal his presence so
[2:17:22] you know what he did
[2:17:23] he walked over there to those ashes
[2:17:26] where he offered up that sacrifice
[2:17:28] because that sacrifice spoke of the
[2:17:31] presence of God to him and he sat down
[2:17:34] on those Sascha's and waited for him and
[2:17:36] he scraped visible
[2:17:39] he got in the middle of the ashes of his
[2:17:42] revelation
[2:17:44] said I'll wait till my change come and
[2:17:48] he was he was looking he was looking in
[2:17:50] the mirror of death
[2:17:52] and he thought a man dies
[2:17:55] shall he live again
[2:17:57] and right in the middle of that of that
[2:18:01] great turmoil and rage and seeing
[2:18:04] tsunami and earthquake in his life God
[2:18:07] coming yield to him he's a tall he said
[2:18:10] I wish that I could write this
[2:18:12] revelation down in stone that he would
[2:18:14] live forever
[2:18:15] but if I die and the skin worms eat this
[2:18:18] flesh I'll stand in this flesh and I'll
[2:18:22] see my Redeemer and not another not as a
[2:18:25] stranger but I don't know him and he'll
[2:18:27] know me
[2:18:29] and the see of him seventh seal broke
[2:18:33] open
[2:18:34] [Applause]
[2:18:41] let me let me read something here
[2:18:50] just the word just means righteous
[2:18:54] upright
[2:18:55] to justify means to free from blame
[2:18:59] declare guiltless to absolve from
[2:19:03] charges
[2:19:05] justification is a justifying or being
[2:19:09] justified
[2:19:10] righteousness is just and upright so we
[2:19:14] see that righteousness and just spoke
[2:19:16] speak of the same thing but because of
[2:19:19] the way that we came into the world we
[2:19:21] don't come into the world just we have
[2:19:24] to be justified to become just
[2:19:29] now a pardon a
[2:19:32] pardon does away with the penalty
[2:19:36] but leaves the person
[2:19:39] still guilty back in the old days out in
[2:19:43] the West and in America they had the
[2:19:46] outlaws and they just could not catch
[2:19:47] him they were robbing banks and
[2:19:50] stagecoaches so they said look if you
[2:19:53] stop all this and and give up your
[2:19:56] weapons
[2:19:58] will pardon you and if they did that
[2:20:02] then they gave them a pardon now the
[2:20:05] pardon does away with the penalty
[2:20:09] but you're still guilty it never
[2:20:12] declares you innocent and all he puts
[2:20:15] away the penalty under the Old Testament
[2:20:18] there was a forgiveness but there was
[2:20:21] not a true justification there was a
[2:20:24] justification that man might become
[2:20:26] righteous like a Abraham it was imputed
[2:20:29] to him
[2:20:31] so if I take a court system in the
[2:20:34] purity of a court system that this man
[2:20:37] is charged or a woman this person is
[2:20:40] charged with a crime and we have the
[2:20:44] prosecutor and we have the defense and
[2:20:47] they come up before the court system and
[2:20:50] would you say the judges the court
[2:20:53] there there's no jury but just this is
[2:20:56] the judge and the prosecution comes up
[2:20:59] and it presents its case
[2:21:02] and the defense they come up and they
[2:21:06] present their case
[2:21:08] now if the judge says he's innocent then
[2:21:13] he has been justified by that court
[2:21:16] system now under the perfect system
[2:21:20] than in the eyes of that court that man
[2:21:24] has never been guilty
[2:21:27] he has never been guilty because he's
[2:21:30] there to judge whether he's guilty or
[2:21:32] not
[2:21:33] and if he judges an innocent no matter
[2:21:37] what the prosecution said this man has
[2:21:39] always been innocent because the
[2:21:41] declared innocent is declare he was not
[2:21:44] guilty
[2:21:46] so in the eyes of the court he never was
[2:21:49] guilty
[2:21:50] so then true justification doesn't have
[2:21:54] anything to do with the sentence of
[2:21:56] penalty it has to do with the verdict
[2:22:01] justification is not a divine work it's
[2:22:06] a divine verdict and God is the
[2:22:10] justifier
[2:22:12] but if the only looks at you as a sudden
[2:22:15] says I forgive you you're justified
[2:22:18] you're only pardoned
[2:22:21] because you're not innocent but you
[2:22:24] cannot be penalized because you're
[2:22:27] innocent and because you're innocent
[2:22:29] there is no penalty so god declare you
[2:22:33] just threw justification and the only
[2:22:38] way that he can do it that a pardon
[2:22:40] comes at the expense of the law
[2:22:42] because the law is not carried out
[2:22:46] so then Christ
[2:22:49] lived a life for you and I and he gave
[2:22:54] his life
[2:22:55] freely for you and I and paid the
[2:22:58] penalty of sin that he did not deserve
[2:23:02] and when he arose again on the third day
[2:23:06] and was received up into heaven and the
[2:23:09] perpetuation was when he sprinkled the
[2:23:12] blood on the mercy seat and the Holy
[2:23:14] Spirit came back as a witness that God
[2:23:18] had received him
[2:23:20] [Applause]
[2:23:23] so then we are justified in Christ and
[2:23:29] in him were innocent and in the eyes of
[2:23:33] God we never was guilty
[2:23:35] yes you did it but Christ your sacrifice
[2:23:40] he is justified he hadn't pardoned you
[2:23:44] he has declared you innocent there
[2:23:47] cannot be no penalty
[2:23:49] but if you're pardoned and a new
[2:23:53] governor comes in and decides to do away
[2:23:55] with those pardons then they can bring
[2:23:57] you back up and send you because you're
[2:23:59] still guilty but if you're innocent
[2:24:02] there is no pardon
[2:24:04] so we haven't been just forgiven he says
[2:24:09] the people forgiven he says you still
[2:24:10] remember it because why you're still
[2:24:12] guilty
[2:24:14] but when Christ descended into the lower
[2:24:17] parts and preached to the souls it was
[2:24:20] in prison and he stopped by paradise
[2:24:24] because now there was a blood atonement
[2:24:26] and they were part of the sheathe wave
[2:24:30] if it had only been Christ and
[2:24:33] resurrected there would have been no
[2:24:35] evidence of Redemption but when he taken
[2:24:38] Abraham and all those it was in paradise
[2:24:41] and rose up to that dimension and
[2:24:44] hell of a happy again and they said
[2:24:47] who's out there say the lord of glory
[2:24:50] and he came with the blood and they rose
[2:24:53] with him and went into that sick
[2:24:55] dimension he said I go to prepare a
[2:24:58] place for you
[2:25:00] what he did he went in there and
[2:25:02] sprinkled blood
[2:25:03] that when you died you would go into
[2:25:06] that 6th dimension
[2:25:10] not forgiven
[2:25:13] but justified and not justified because
[2:25:18] you're just children of God
[2:25:19] not justified just because he loved you
[2:25:22] he loved Abraham they'll remember
[2:25:25] Melchizedek had no blood for him he had
[2:25:29] to become a man and crucified and
[2:25:32] descended down into hell and stop by
[2:25:34] paradise and God all those who died in
[2:25:37] faith embracing the promise for all
[2:25:39] because they had representation because
[2:25:43] God had inspired him and by faith they
[2:25:46] died embracing the promise
[2:25:51] [Music]
[2:25:53] we don't have a hope that we're gonna be
[2:25:56] saved we are saved
[2:25:57] our hope is in the second coming we're
[2:26:00] looking to that second coming
[2:26:03] we're not hoping to get saved
[2:26:06] we're saved if we accept that sacrifice
[2:26:13] one more example and then we'll close
[2:26:15] for the night
[2:26:17] locked
[2:26:20] 2nd Peter chapter 2 I read about lot
[2:26:25] and it says a lot
[2:26:29] it said it fixes he was a just man I
[2:26:35] think that's 2nd Peter 5
[2:26:48] second Peter five
[2:26:52] second Peter six second Peter chapter
[2:26:55] two verse six and
[2:26:58] turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:27:01] into ashes
[2:27:03] condemned them with an overflow making
[2:27:06] making them an example
[2:27:09] upon to those that after should live
[2:27:12] ungodly
[2:27:14] and delivered just lot
[2:27:17] he's just
[2:27:19] vexed with the filthy conversation of
[2:27:22] the wicked
[2:27:23] for the righteous man
[2:27:26] called him a righteous man for that
[2:27:28] righteous man dwelling
[2:27:30] among them in seeing and hearing
[2:27:35] vexed his his righteous soul from day to
[2:27:40] day with their unlawful deeds and the
[2:27:43] Lord knowing how to deliver or can I say
[2:27:47] separate
[2:27:50] to deliver
[2:27:52] the ungodly let me find my place
[2:27:56] for the Lord north how to deliver the
[2:27:59] godly out of the temptations and to
[2:28:03] reserve the unjust
[2:28:04] on to the day of judgment to be punished
[2:28:08] so jesus said father he said sanctify
[2:28:10] them chapter 17 John
[2:28:14] and that word sanctify means to set
[2:28:18] apart the word holy means set apart when
[2:28:22] you read that word sanctifying the Old
[2:28:23] Testament New Testament you read that
[2:28:25] word holy it means set apart
[2:28:28] set apart for God sanctify them Father
[2:28:31] through thy truth and thy Word is truth
[2:28:35] so how does God separate the godly from
[2:28:38] the unjust by faith
[2:28:43] but wait a minute
[2:28:45] how could luck be just he never heard
[2:28:48] from God
[2:28:49] well if I go to Matthew 10 there's the
[2:28:51] answer
[2:28:54] Matthew 10
[2:29:03] and look toward the end of the chapter
[2:29:04] the last two or three verses last two
[2:29:07] verses
[2:29:08] verse 40 Matthew Tim he that receiveth
[2:29:13] you receiveth me he that receiveth me
[2:29:16] receiveth him that sent me he that
[2:29:19] receiveth the prophet in the name of a
[2:29:23] prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward
[2:29:27] he that recognizes a prophet to be a
[2:29:32] prophet of the Living God and accepts
[2:29:35] that believes it in his heart that he is
[2:29:37] the mouthpiece the voice of God he
[2:29:40] receives a reward now
[2:29:42] what is that reward
[2:29:44] its righteousness because now it says
[2:29:48] what does it say
[2:29:50] receives a prop and he that receiveth
[2:29:54] the righteous man
[2:29:56] so now he that believes God
[2:29:59] receives the voice of God or the
[2:30:02] revelation of God he receives his
[2:30:05] righteousness by believing that prophet
[2:30:07] is sin of God he's not believing the
[2:30:09] Prophet he's believing the voice of God
[2:30:11] through that prophet and he recognizes
[2:30:13] him to be the voice of God and God is
[2:30:16] supplying that word to that individual
[2:30:18] through that prophet and if he believes
[2:30:21] that
[2:30:22] recognizes him to be the source and
[2:30:24] voice of God and he believes it in his
[2:30:26] heart he's righteous now you take that
[2:30:30] righteous man that has received the word
[2:30:32] of that prophet and
[2:30:34] he and he that receiveth a righteous man
[2:30:37] in the name of a righteous man shall
[2:30:40] receive a righteous man's reward and
[2:30:43] what is that look at the next and
[2:30:46] whosoever shall give to drink on to one
[2:30:49] of these least ones a cup of cold water
[2:30:52] the least ones that believes the
[2:30:55] testimony of that righteous man
[2:30:59] not the righteous man but the least one
[2:31:02] of these that believes the righteous man
[2:31:05] to give them a drink of water chilling
[2:31:08] no wise loser reward
[2:31:13] it's a lot
[2:31:16] his daddy dies
[2:31:19] and his daddy's brother his uncle
[2:31:21] Abraham
[2:31:22] never had no children
[2:31:25] but he longed to have children you know
[2:31:28] some people they want children so bad
[2:31:30] they can't have children so they adopt
[2:31:32] children and they pour all her love
[2:31:34] under that child as that child's our own
[2:31:36] child and Abraham didn't have no
[2:31:39] children now his brother dies and here's
[2:31:41] a boy a son and he takes him as his only
[2:31:45] son and
[2:31:46] he raises him and he nurtures him and
[2:31:49] they travel together they walk down that
[2:31:52] dusty road together and he tells him
[2:31:55] about God and his experience with God
[2:31:57] and God is revealed to him things he
[2:32:00] talks about his visitations he talks
[2:32:02] about the revelation that God had given
[2:32:04] him and you know what
[2:32:07] lot believed him
[2:32:13] even though the promise didn't pertain
[2:32:15] to him it pertained to his step daddy
[2:32:18] but he believed him and because he
[2:32:22] believed him God imputed that to him for
[2:32:25] righteousness because see he was a
[2:32:27] prophet
[2:32:28] the only problem was is that Abraham had
[2:32:32] an experience and lot didn't he
[2:32:36] never had a personal experience
[2:32:39] so when the angels came down he believed
[2:32:42] but brother Branham said he didn't see
[2:32:44] the fire hanging over Sodom it wasn't a
[2:32:47] reality it was real enough that he
[2:32:50] preached it but he could not separate
[2:32:52] himself from that destruction showing
[2:32:54] that he doubted whether it might would
[2:32:56] come or not one place brother Brown said
[2:32:58] he didn't really believe that God would
[2:32:59] destroy that life around him
[2:33:02] and yet he believed a message but there
[2:33:05] was no powers faith was paralyzed it
[2:33:08] wasn't dead it was in a straitjacket he
[2:33:11] was paralyzed and kaneto straight he
[2:33:13] couldn't do nothing
[2:33:15] and in an in Genesis 19 in about verse
[2:33:21] 29
[2:33:22] it said and God looked down
[2:33:26] and the fire was falling was falling
[2:33:31] down on Sodom and God looked down
[2:33:34] and you know what it said he saw a lot
[2:33:38] down there
[2:33:39] and when he saw a lot you know what that
[2:33:41] scripture said it said and he remembered
[2:33:44] Abraham
[2:33:49] he looked down the fire was falling then
[2:33:52] there was lot and he remembered Abraham
[2:33:57] and he delivered lot out of Sodom
[2:34:02] and your prayers for
[2:34:05] your loved one he said Lord would you
[2:34:09] destroy the righteous
[2:34:11] well he might not have really believed
[2:34:15] the message but he did believe it
[2:34:17] we're not creating loopholes I'm just
[2:34:19] telling you what the scripture said
[2:34:22] he accepted a profit as a profit and he
[2:34:28] believed what he said
[2:34:30] even though he didn't have the faith
[2:34:32] that took him out of the danger god
[2:34:34] looked down
[2:34:36] and he remembered his bride he
[2:34:38] remembered either
[2:34:41] any delivered law
[2:34:47] so
[2:34:48] lot got his righteousness
[2:34:51] from Abraham which caught this
[2:34:54] inspiration of God on the word that came
[2:34:56] to him and he believed him it was
[2:34:58] imputed to him to righteousness and he
[2:35:00] that receives a righteous man in a name
[2:35:02] of a righteous man or prophet in the
[2:35:05] name of the Prophet receives that reward
[2:35:07] and God loved him
[2:35:09] and they remembered Abraham any delivery
[2:35:17] as we bow our heads Heavenly Father
[2:35:21] Lord we thank you so much for your word
[2:35:24] and your word is real it's true it's
[2:35:27] unchangeable it's unalterable
[2:35:30] and you never change your revelation you
[2:35:33] add information you make it clearer you
[2:35:36] never change your Bible you only open up
[2:35:39] the word that it would become clear to
[2:35:40] us
[2:35:41] where man becomes questionable about it
[2:35:44] he doesn't understand it
[2:35:47] but without being born again he cannot
[2:35:49] see the kingdom of God he cannot
[2:35:51] understand it and the kingdom of God is
[2:35:55] within you
[2:35:56] you are the kingdom of God
[2:35:58] because you are the Word made flesh for
[2:36:01] this day
[2:36:03] it doesn't come with observation and you
[2:36:07] just can't enter into it you can't join
[2:36:09] it but you must be born again
[2:36:14] Heavenly Father may you bless
[2:36:17] your people tonight for their patience
[2:36:19] and their long-suffering
[2:36:22] and through the multitude of words as
[2:36:25] one man said
[2:36:29] man does a little with much and God
[2:36:32] doesn't much with a little a little
[2:36:35] sometimes father we spend a lot of time
[2:36:37] speaking
[2:36:39] but only you can bring the inspiration
[2:36:42] one word one phrase and the inspiration
[2:36:45] from the Holy Spirit from you on that
[2:36:48] individual opens up a whole flood of
[2:36:51] vision and view of thy presence in thy
[2:36:54] word so father may you on the law
[2:36:58] the hearts tonight
[2:37:01] Lord that they might be established in
[2:37:04] the presence of God and to know you in
[2:37:09] the power of your resurrection father I
[2:37:12] ask that tonight in Jesus Christ's name
[2:37:14] Amen amen
[2:37:17] brother Gerald if you come
[2:37:27] god bless you god bless you brother
[2:37:30] hey man
[2:37:32] our brother Mike and brother drill has
[2:37:35] something in common and brother of
[2:37:36] Macondo
[2:37:38] we can't read the clock
[2:37:52] hey men
[2:37:55] and we are long winded a man but now
[2:38:00] it's the depth of the revelation of the
[2:38:02] eighth of the revelation by the grace of
[2:38:03] God as
[2:38:06] we almost do it maybe one day we will as
[2:38:11] Paul did when he preached and preached
[2:38:14] and preached and preached right on
[2:38:17] through the midnight and that young man
[2:38:18] fell and was killed but I tell you the
[2:38:22] preaching did produce something a man
[2:38:26] they were in the spirit and Paul was in
[2:38:29] the spirit favor in the revelation and
[2:38:32] and the righteousness of God was present
[2:38:35] a man the rightness was there and
[2:38:40] people did I guess were up startled and
[2:38:44] upset but Paul just went down and made
[2:38:48] all remedy student he's not dead he's
[2:38:50] alive
[2:38:52] so brother I tend to this why it
[2:38:55] produces faith you know and he if your
[2:38:59] heart is into it you become one with the
[2:39:01] word that that's mean that's going over
[2:39:03] the pulpit then then faith is going to
[2:39:06] going to be there God is going to be
[2:39:08] there God is going to honor your your
[2:39:10] faith you know your your hunger and your
[2:39:13] thirst for the word a man by the grace
[2:39:16] of God so has it got it honored it right
[2:39:19] there when when Paul preached and he
[2:39:21] went back it he didn't stop preaching
[2:39:25] you think you know well they're looking
[2:39:29] at their watch and they're looking at
[2:39:32] the clock and
[2:39:34] you're yawning and so on and they're
[2:39:37] stretching and oh well I I think I
[2:39:40] preached long enough now that poor young
[2:39:41] man fell out and and this have no
[2:39:45] it brought God on the scene
[2:39:48] in resurrection power and Paul got up
[2:39:52] and went back preached to them and
[2:39:54] preached the sunrise
[2:39:56] yeah you know maybe they thought oh well
[2:39:59] now I guess I guess our brother's going
[2:40:02] to going to bring him to a close now no
[2:40:04] he went on to sunrise they may have
[2:40:07] brother and that's the way we got a
[2:40:09] preach that's right as I said before you
[2:40:12] know forsake not the assembling of
[2:40:14] yourselves together and much more as you
[2:40:16] see the Day approaching and somewhere as
[2:40:18] I said I have a poundage yet but I did
[2:40:21] see it somewhere the prophet of God said
[2:40:23] that the time is coming when he said
[2:40:25] what I want he said when you want her to
[2:40:27] meet every night just not one not two or
[2:40:30] three nights a week but every night they
[2:40:32] met and
[2:40:34] and another time he said were mentioned
[2:40:38] today with our brother Mike and now that
[2:40:40] he said that oh well preached 45 minutes
[2:40:44] and
[2:40:45] people have taken that out of context
[2:40:47] they take this out of context they've
[2:40:50] take the message out of context they
[2:40:52] take doctrine out of context and they
[2:40:54] took that out of context I just got to
[2:40:56] preach 45 minutes well what else did he
[2:40:59] say he said if there are sinners in the
[2:41:03] middlee preached 45 minutes make an
[2:41:05] altar call base it is all believers he
[2:41:08] says you can stay all night
[2:41:11] amen but we're more conscious of our
[2:41:15] natural things than we are our spiritual
[2:41:18] amen let just leave the natural outside
[2:41:22] and let's dwell on the spiritual God
[2:41:25] look after that oh but I might have to
[2:41:28] do this and I might have to do that well
[2:41:30] he'll give you the strength for it you
[2:41:32] give you the wisdom for it it'll give
[2:41:33] you the leadership for it if you give
[2:41:36] him first place Amen by the grace of God
[2:41:39] so appreciated our brother's ministry
[2:41:41] tonight on true righteousness a man true
[2:41:46] righteousness and not by the letter of
[2:41:48] the word but by the spirit
[2:41:51] the Jews did have they did have and
[2:41:54] there are many that you know that Jews
[2:41:55] had that righteousness by the letter of
[2:41:57] the word the message the law as it were
[2:42:00] but and many have a righteousness by the
[2:42:02] letter of the message but how many have
[2:42:05] righteousness by the spirit of the
[2:42:06] message the Holy Ghost amen
[2:42:09] true righteousness or a true rightness
[2:42:11] you can have it outside but do you have
[2:42:14] an insight
[2:42:15] remember again what he said in Hebrews
[2:42:17] the Hebrews series he said you can go
[2:42:20] out and you can have long hair you can
[2:42:22] have this kind of clothing and all of
[2:42:23] that and you can be baptized in the name
[2:42:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ but if it's not
[2:42:27] my faith out of the heart he said his
[2:42:29] dead works
[2:42:31] it is all good works it is and not it
[2:42:35] and our brother was bringing it out this
[2:42:37] is and is this not true righteousness it
[2:42:41] is not the righteousness of God amen it
[2:42:44] is of the flesh by the letter of the
[2:42:47] word a man and so forbid that we are
[2:42:51] only carnal believers not spiritual and
[2:42:54] King was carnal as our brother brought
[2:42:56] out Ava was spiritual
[2:42:59] Isaac was spiritual his meal was carnal
[2:43:02] a man he saw was carnal and Jacob was
[2:43:06] spiritual so you got you got this side
[2:43:09] you got that side so god help us to make
[2:43:12] sure you're on the right side
[2:43:13] make your calling and election sure sir
[2:43:17] brother it's without a doubt the Lord
[2:43:20] has made it clear to us tonight
[2:43:21] regarding the righteousness of God the
[2:43:25] true righteousness of God from the
[2:43:26] inside versus the righteousness from the
[2:43:29] outside you can have it outside but the
[2:43:33] greater the condemnation
[2:43:35] amen so Greece we need it from the
[2:43:38] inside out
[2:43:40] to be led by the spirit a male and he
[2:43:46] brought it all out in his past tense
[2:43:51] it's not what I've done or can do or
[2:43:53] will do is what he's already done a man
[2:43:57] and I thought he was going to read it
[2:44:02] because he went to Hebrews 11 and
[2:44:05] I eastern Hebrews the eleventh I said
[2:44:09] well maybe he needs e Bruce chapter 10
[2:44:11] and if he was going to make a series out
[2:44:13] of it and go another our ego you get to
[2:44:16] he was after 10 and it struck me this
[2:44:21] week and just let me just read just five
[2:44:24] verses here six verses and he said by
[2:44:27] which will we are sanctified
[2:44:29] the will of Christ
[2:44:31] God in Christ by the which will we are
[2:44:35] sanctified through the offering of the
[2:44:37] body of Jesus Christ once for all
[2:44:41] but this man after he had offered
[2:44:44] one sacrifice for sins forever sat down
[2:44:48] on the right hand of God for by one
[2:44:52] offering he has perfected forever them
[2:44:55] that are sanctified
[2:44:59] as says where of the Holy Ghost also is
[2:45:03] a witness to us for the after that he
[2:45:06] had said before this is the Covenant
[2:45:10] that I will make with them and he
[2:45:13] referred to that in Jeremiah bleagh and
[2:45:15] this is the Covenant that I will make
[2:45:18] with them that after those days saith
[2:45:20] the Lord I will put my laws I'm glad he
[2:45:24] brought that out God don't do away with
[2:45:25] the laws
[2:45:27] he magnified them because sometimes were
[2:45:30] accused of doing away with the law
[2:45:32] because we don't keep Saturday Sabbath
[2:45:34] yeah but as I said to that
[2:45:38] Adventists brother I said he magnified
[2:45:40] the law going from natural adultery - I
[2:45:43] said just thoughts the thought about it
[2:45:46] and the lusting in your mind your or
[2:45:49] your feelings I said he magnified it and
[2:45:51] I said
[2:45:53] now I should have no other gods before
[2:45:56] me and it could be you know well not
[2:45:59] just to being of a Trinity but it could
[2:46:01] be anything because your your your house
[2:46:04] can become your God your vehicle can
[2:46:06] become your God your children come
[2:46:08] become your God but those and you get
[2:46:11] more priam anything you get more
[2:46:12] preeminence to
[2:46:13] and it enters your relationship with the
[2:46:16] Lord that's a God that is a God and thou
[2:46:20] shall have no other gods before me and I
[2:46:22] said brother
[2:46:24] concerning what you're saying about the
[2:46:26] seventh day and say I must see some you
[2:46:29] know labor on Saturday and and go to
[2:46:32] church once on Saturday and that's it
[2:46:34] for the week I said no my brother I said
[2:46:37] you see some your did work so since
[2:46:39] seven days a week I I said an enter into
[2:46:42] God's Sabbath that
[2:46:47] was the what the reaction I got
[2:46:53] he had nothing to answer because he knew
[2:46:57] it was the truth I so remember the Jews
[2:47:00] did not enter into God's Sabbath because
[2:47:02] of unbelief they
[2:47:04] refused him I
[2:47:06] said that natural day only takes the
[2:47:09] spiritual God magnified it from one day
[2:47:11] to 70s and I just sees him from natural
[2:47:14] where labor and work I said you cease
[2:47:16] from your dead works of sin seven days a
[2:47:18] week an injury and of God Sabbath praise
[2:47:22] the Lord God's Sabbath rest and he said
[2:47:26] I will put my laws into their hearts and
[2:47:29] into their into their minds when I write
[2:47:31] them good and their sins and
[2:47:36] iniquities will I remember no more
[2:47:47] why can't we believe
[2:47:51] why can't we Billy
[2:47:54] our brothers brought it out it's not our
[2:47:57] righteousness as he is we have none
[2:48:00] except what he computes to us
[2:48:03] why can't we believe
[2:48:07] from the heart
[2:48:09] what was preached tonight let it be
[2:48:12] forever settled in your soul
[2:48:16] Lord your servant smoke it
[2:48:20] this it's and and again it's not the
[2:48:23] saying brother Mike it is thus saith the
[2:48:25] Lord
[2:48:27] it had not us and brother Mike in to
[2:48:30] threaten and remember that's how Jesus
[2:48:32] overcome the devil it is written it is
[2:48:35] written it is written II he could have
[2:48:37] exercised power he could have done this
[2:48:40] to the devil done that to the devil yeah
[2:48:42] do you know anyone that measure
[2:48:44] but he didn't he just came back to the
[2:48:47] wind with the word
[2:48:48] Amen because everything comes back to
[2:48:51] the word
[2:48:54] then the Alpha and the Omega of these
[2:48:57] plans and his purpose and his pattern by
[2:49:02] the grace of God wonderful Oh

[2:49:25] and I'm wondering about this and that
[2:49:28] and trust me
[2:49:30] take my word it is forever settled
[2:49:34] why
[2:49:37] their sins and iniquities will I

[2:50:38] Lord was was was was bringing forth the
[2:50:41] truth again
[2:50:43] emphasizing it again
[2:50:45] that the baptism did it didn't just come
[2:50:48] this this age the policy has been
[2:50:52] pouring himself into the church ever
[2:50:53] since the day of Pentecost now finally
[2:50:56] he's the fullness of him in his image in
[2:50:57] the church in the end the bright the
[2:51:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man god

[2:51:05] recognize who we are a
[2:51:09] man we need and he said you know the
[2:51:12] problem
[2:51:14] after all God's done
[2:51:16] you know the problem
[2:51:19] he said the bride has got to come to the
[2:51:22] place to recognize who she is
[2:51:26] and he said when she does he said then
[2:51:30] the rapture will go
[2:51:33] it's like I said told you that when I
[2:51:35] was in the parking lot and at a
[2:51:37] supermarket summer one night and I'm
[2:51:39] looking at the closet and what what are

[2:52:23] promises to what for he said to give you
[2:52:26] strength like a charge gonna do a
[2:52:27] battery

[2:52:32] the rapture when the resurrection comes
[2:52:33] he said we're just gonna go right into
[2:52:36] our theophany and into a glorified state
[2:52:38] instantly praise the Lord brother but
[2:52:42] you got to believe what you heard
[2:52:43] tonight you got to accept what you heard
[2:52:46] tonight that
[2:52:49] the righteousness of God is not past
[2:52:53] tamps our present tense future tense it
[2:52:57] it's just done for or it forever it was
[2:53:01] eternal in the mind of God then he's
[2:53:03] before the foundation of the world
[2:53:06] thought Elvis
[2:53:10] to Billy
[2:53:22] there is a righteousness as our brother
[2:53:24] brighto can adjust to remind you of this
[2:53:27] of the law the flesh for the letter of
[2:53:30] the word seeming the message and there's
[2:53:33] the righteousness of God in the soul by
[2:53:35] the Holy Ghost
[2:53:42] he brought out of a job
[2:53:46] to it
[2:53:52] good experience a good example Joe
[2:53:59] did one job judge job by his personal
[2:54:03] own personal experience
[2:54:05] another judge him by tradition and
[2:54:08] another one judged him by his knowledge
[2:54:10] that he had see me like he knew more
[2:54:14] than Joel
[2:54:16] and as I preached some time ago that's
[2:54:20] the three approaches to the message and
[2:54:22] they all had their judge you that way
[2:54:24] but
[2:54:27] God pointed the job
[2:54:31] God where the him God turned around now
[2:54:36] he said to those three
[2:54:39] he said the last job to pray for you
[2:54:43] that's good
[2:54:45] as he said he saw Joel oh yeah that was
[2:54:48] hit that's good he looked down I saw
[2:54:50] Joel it's encouraging I mean he looks
[2:54:53] down and sees you
[2:54:56] pleading the token for your family your
[2:54:58] children your family some friend or
[2:55:00] somebody got laid out in your heart it's
[2:55:02] good
[2:55:03] god looked down and saw what abraham
[2:55:07] that's good thank the Lord
[2:55:10] that is good
[2:55:13] god help us
[2:55:17] but God's going to see when he sees you
[2:55:20] hey man as the Bible tells us God
[2:55:25] said I'll do this and I'll do that now
[2:55:28] do this now do that and he said only the
[2:55:31] prophets have delivered their own Souls
[2:55:33] by their own faith it's their own
[2:55:35] righteousness
[2:55:38] but he said I will bring their sons and
[2:55:42] their daughters
[2:55:45] that's encouraging
[2:55:47] please
[2:55:49] believe God
[2:55:51] accept what he has said tonight a
[2:55:55] man so that when he looks down had this
[2:55:58] one or that one he sees you

[2:56:06] the Lord
[2:56:07] see what's he looking for faith
[2:56:10] and that one was under that that token
[2:56:13] that Abraham had praised
[2:56:17] God bless your brother Mike

[2:56:25] just before we have him because we want
[2:56:29] to there's a couple of brethren we want
[2:56:31] that time so I have some fellowship with

[2:56:38] so but just will I have a ham before we
[2:56:42] go and God bless sister baguette

[2:57:16] time and also brother Phillip and power

[2:57:50] so we pray God to help them and he
[2:57:53] somebody elite him need a stool to put

[2:59:21] prophet of God of course did confess
[2:59:23] that he himself was guilty of
[2:59:26] some profane and vain babblings
[2:59:29] so but he said Christians should avoid
[2:59:32] it because it leads to ungodliness more
[2:59:35] ungodliness be careful of your
[2:59:37] conversation because one thing to lead
[2:59:39] to another and that's the devil that's
