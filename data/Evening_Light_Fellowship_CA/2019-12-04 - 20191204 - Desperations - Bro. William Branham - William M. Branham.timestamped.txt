[43:48] [Music]
[43:54] amen praise the Lord God blesses amen
[43:58] the grace of God amen to us all the
[44:03] grace of God to again the sink and the
[44:07] gentleman Terry that brother Bob was
[44:10] mentioning and I understand he's in just
[44:13] in his 50s around there and we pray the
[44:16] grace of God to him for the salvation of
[44:19] his soul
[44:20] God knows a man maybe he's not conscious
[44:24] of much when it comes to we don't know
[44:25] when it comes to the natural but again
[44:29] God is conscious of him and goddess
[44:32] conscious of his heart
[44:33] amen maybe to the to the to the family
[44:37] or friends that he's he's out of it and
[44:40] he's not aware of them a man and really
[44:44] there's nothing that they can this point
[44:47] to but as far as God is concerned
[44:51] there's life there a man so we pray the
[44:55] grace of God to Terry a man and again I
[44:58] don't know what is the will of God why
[45:01] did God allow it why did God permit it a
[45:04] man so and I understand he's not he's
[45:07] not married he doesn't have a family I
[45:10] don't think so what but again there's
[45:12] somebody that that he's that he I'm sure
[45:15] he's aware of or that they're aware of
[45:17] him and friends but again we pray that
[45:20] he's between time and eternity that's
[45:24] right he's between he's between death
[45:27] and life so we pray the grace of God
[45:29] some other God will see something in his
[45:32] soul a man that pleases the Lord some
[45:36] there's kind of like good again the
[45:38] Prophet said we trust that he's there
[45:41] that the Prophet says you're going to be
[45:43] surprised who made it who didn't make it
[45:44] and that's the truth and I'm referring
[45:47] to the bride but those those mainly
[45:50] those outside the city so maybe he'll be
[45:53] there we don't know well as the Bride of
[45:57] Christ we are pleading the token life of
[45:59] the blood a man for Terry we're pleading
[46:02] the grace of God brother is grace for me
[46:05] it's grace for him
[46:07] grace for you grace for him a man so I
[46:11] pray the grace of God to him and to
[46:14] family and friends to God be the glory
[46:17] and brother there's a lot going on and
[46:19] there's a lot more going going to take
[46:21] place because it's going to get worse
[46:23] and worse and worse the closer we get to
[46:26] eternity the closer we get to the end
[46:28] the closer we get to the resurrection
[46:30] and the rapture a man and there were
[46:33] some quotes that I was going to share
[46:34] with you concerning the rapture tonight
[46:36] but we'll leave that for another service
[46:38] and tonight and I I was going to
[46:42] minister on another subject but I
[46:45] decided when I got here that we maybe
[46:47] will listen to a tape by the prophet
[46:50] it'll be just over an hour but there
[46:54] were things that I want to share with
[46:55] you concerning grace they met so that we
[47:00] would understand grace and have a
[47:02] greater honor with a revelation of grace
[47:04] and the extent of grace but again
[47:08] there's there's things that I did I
[47:10] discovered when I was just checking some
[47:12] quotes with a prophet I said Oh grace I
[47:15] I never thought about that
[47:18] never thought in those terms I said Lord
[47:20] so we'll share that with you too maybe
[47:22] next Wednesday we'll see as Lord leads
[47:25] us amen grace I said Lord we most don't
[47:28] understand that that thought of grace or
[47:31] that revelation of grace either to us I
[47:34] said the most that we know about grace
[47:35] is Ephesians 2:8 by grace are you saved
[47:38] through faith and that not of yourselves
[47:40] it is the gift of God so we thank God
[47:43] for grace for the salvation of our souls
[47:45] we thank God for grace and a redeemed
[47:48] redemption of our of our bodies and so
[47:50] on but grace it goes beyond that
[47:53] oh yeah oh yes there's an alpha and
[47:56] there's an Omega it's amazing that the
[47:59] first revelation of grace is is in
[48:02] Genesis Noah found grace in the eyes of
[48:05] the Lord and you go right on through the
[48:08] last the last revelation of grace it's
[48:10] revelation 20:2 the grace of our Lord
[48:14] Jesus Christ be with you all amen
[48:16] a man begins with grace it ends with
[48:19] grace and
[48:20] and knowing that the book of Revelation
[48:22] itself begins with grace and ends with
[48:25] grace amen
[48:26] oh yes it's tremendous see without grace
[48:29] we're not going to make it without grace
[48:32] no no and not just from time to eternity
[48:35] but we need grace to make it through
[48:38] this life that's the truth
[48:40] it is my grace I'm sane but it's my
[48:42] grace that I go one step at a time it's
[48:45] grace that takes me a day at a time the
[48:47] grace it takes you a day at a time how
[48:50] do I get through this day grace a man
[48:52] and it's grace that's enabling us and
[48:55] with us to get us through the the issues
[48:57] regarding the selling of our home
[48:58] because as I said that we thought it was
[49:01] sold but all that was cancelled so we're
[49:06] committing it to the Lord again and
[49:08] asking for grace and for the leadership
[49:11] of the Holy Ghost amen
[49:13] so keep it in prayer by the grace of God
[49:16] amen so it's it's it's a difficult time
[49:20] for myself as too many to deal with
[49:22] these issues and we pray the grace of
[49:25] God to provide what is will is a man
[49:31] also to remember in prayer again we were
[49:38] there last night to visit them they
[49:39] invited us out for supper and that was
[49:42] sister Goulding's daughter Joyce and her
[49:46] husband Cecil they invited us out to I
[49:48] think his opera gullies and to share
[49:51] supper with them and they did express
[49:54] that they would like to have more
[49:56] fellowship with us and so on so if my
[49:59] self sister Betty of course and my older
[50:01] brother Melvin and his wife and of
[50:03] course Ivan and his wife so it was we
[50:06] had a wonderful time of fellowship a man
[50:08] and it's not just natural things there
[50:11] were times when the Lord allowed
[50:13] spiritual to come into it and so we
[50:15] thank the Lord for that amen to God be
[50:17] the glory amen
[50:19] so god bless Joyce and Cecil they are
[50:24] professing Christians and they do
[50:27] ordinarily and understand attend the
[50:30] Salvation Army
[50:32] somewhere out in this
[50:34] in CVS area so we and I did here the the
[50:38] path the clergy the the officer that
[50:41] preached there I did here in one time
[50:43] not long ago I was had a brother's house
[50:46] and and he put on he put it put on the
[50:49] Salvation Army's service and this
[50:51] officer does the same Church they go to
[50:54] and this officer preached and I
[50:56] mentioned it after I've told he told you
[50:59] about it and he preached on the subject
[51:02] of being thankful and he said not just
[51:05] for this that but for all he said even
[51:08] some of the things that we we looked out
[51:09] we think is his heart and so on it's
[51:13] discouraged disappointing he's to be
[51:15] thankful he said because God has
[51:17] ordained it for a reason God has allowed
[51:20] it for a reason so he said be thankful
[51:22] not just for the good and not just for
[51:24] this not just for that
[51:25] I prefer everything he said the bible
[51:28] encourages us to do that and he of
[51:31] course he was given scripture a man so i
[51:34] pray the lord bless that officer he was
[51:36] it was the word he was into the word he
[51:39] wasn't denying it a man so to God be the
[51:42] glory and that it that is their their
[51:44] clergy so God's good God blessed them
[51:47] aim at and again he might be one of
[51:50] that's gonna be there outside the city
[51:51] as well we know it's not the bride but
[51:55] again and I've been preaching that for
[51:57] years you know I like I said I started
[51:59] that my sermon was rebuking this
[52:02] believers because they had a wrong
[52:04] attitude and they had a wrong spirit
[52:06] towards those people they did and my
[52:10] first sermon was to rebuke them and say
[52:12] don't do that any because as I said if
[52:15] you love them which love you what reward
[52:16] have you you know and so on do not even
[52:19] the publicans the same and the believers
[52:21] think oh we just live gotta love
[52:23] believers no no you got to love
[52:24] everybody any man show the law by the
[52:28] grace of God so I said don't don't you
[52:30] put your fingers down there or your
[52:32] nosed out I said on those out there
[52:34] because they're in that church there in
[52:36] that church as I says grace for you is
[52:38] grace for them because there goes you
[52:41] but for the grace of God a man so the
[52:44] the grace have brought you out there's
[52:45] grace to bring them
[52:47] a man so I pray greatest Elpis mother
[52:49] keep a right attitude and a right spirit
[52:53] amen because Italy Italy
[52:56] take you in or put you out a man so
[53:01] thank God Jesus kept the right attitude
[53:03] and a right spirit prays and also to
[53:09] keep our brother John condition prayer
[53:11] understand that he's been in contact now
[53:14] with our brother Neville I understand
[53:16] that he passes the church maybe in
[53:18] Washington United States but he also
[53:20] ministers in the church in Ottawa so our
[53:24] brother John is hoping to be able to get
[53:26] to the church somewhere in Ottawa and
[53:28] and to fellowship and here our brother
[53:32] Neville preached you understand if you
[53:34] remember he preached there too for us
[53:36] and God bless brother Neville and also
[53:39] to remember in prayer our brother John
[53:43] Dan quoi I got an email from him today I
[53:50] understand that easy in Ghana he does
[53:53] have the church in Ontario I believe
[53:55] that's where our brother makandal goes
[53:59] to and right now brother Dan cause in
[54:02] Ghana and he is there for a funeral
[54:05] service and it was surprising that not
[54:08] for one person but for two and it's for
[54:11] a ministering brother understand and his
[54:15] wife and I I don't understand how that
[54:18] they both went at the same time so he
[54:21] said he was there for the funeral of the
[54:23] brother and his wife so I prayed the
[54:26] grace of God to brother Dan call in
[54:28] Ghana amen and there's another brother
[54:31] at all so that's emailed me concerning
[54:33] some needs that he had and he's
[54:34] requesting prayer and it's her brother
[54:36] Samuel and that's the English version
[54:40] what the other version is I don't know
[54:42] and where he lives on not sure exactly
[54:44] brother Samuel and so he's requesting
[54:47] prayer for his needs God's grace to him
[54:50] amen
[54:51] so there's there's many needs so I pray
[54:53] the grace of God were sensitive to it
[54:55] man
[54:56] turn with me just before we turn to
[54:59] brother branham turn with me to Ezekiel
[55:02] chapter 22 God's grace our sister
[55:08] Kimberly is she home oh she's out there
[55:10] god bless her and brother Joshua it was
[55:15] his working he's home okay
[55:22] our brother Weiser will be hadn't gone
[55:24] for at least another couple of weeks of
[55:26] grace to him and he's also looking for a
[55:29] church in Ottawa or in the area nor
[55:31] Mississauga and I did provide him with
[55:33] the name and address of a church and the
[55:36] phone number so god bless brother vital
[55:40] in Ezekiel chapter 22 and beginning to
[55:45] read at verse 23 and the word of the
[55:50] Lord came unto me saying son of man say
[55:54] unto her thou art the land that is not
[55:58] cleansed nor rained upon in the day of
[56:01] indignation there is a conspiracy of our
[56:06] prophets in the midst thereof like a
[56:09] roaring lion ravening the prey they have
[56:14] devoured souls they have taken the
[56:18] treasure and precious things they have
[56:21] made or many widows in the midst thereof
[56:24] this is the reef response the results of
[56:29] the ministry of the prophets to Israel
[56:33] brother we're going to witness a lot of
[56:37] the same things in these last days
[56:39] around the message because it said it
[56:47] says there is a conspiracy of our
[56:49] prophets in the midst thereof like a
[56:53] roaring lion ravening the prey they have
[56:56] devoured souls and there's many a
[56:59] ministry that's devouring souls not
[57:02] really feeding souls they're feeding on
[57:03] souls a man so we pray the grace of God
[57:07] to us to give us wisdom and revel
[57:09] nation and understanding a man take heed
[57:12] what you hear and it's just devoured
[57:15] Souls and they have taken the treasure
[57:17] and precious things and they have made
[57:20] her many widows in the midst thereof
[57:22] over an hour for desperation it was an
[57:25] hour then and if an hour an hour for
[57:27] desperation it's an hour now a man and
[57:30] her priests have violated my law and
[57:33] have propane my holy things they have
[57:37] put no difference between the holy and
[57:39] the profane they mad but there is a
[57:42] difference between right and wrong
[57:43] between that which pleases God and that
[57:46] was don't please God and it says neither
[57:49] have they show difference between the
[57:51] clay unclean and the clean because why
[57:55] because they're there to get the favor
[57:58] of the people but brother God is here to
[58:00] put it through the Ministry to correct
[58:03] the people a man to get the line up with
[58:06] a word by the grace of God but again
[58:09] most don't want that kind of a rebel
[58:11] ministry they wanted ministry that's
[58:13] Genesis teach on Revelation revelation
[58:15] yeah you know they had this doctrine
[58:17] this time this I just understanding that
[58:20] understanding no brother once we get
[58:22] into it God wants us to line up with the
[58:24] word when we get into the word when we
[58:26] get into the message God wants us to God
[58:29] wants us to die to ourselves so that the
[58:31] message can live in us amen
[58:33] so it's not you the lives it's the
[58:35] message it's the word living in you but
[58:39] Ezekiel was discovering the promise to
[58:42] priesthood just never had the right
[58:44] anointing and it says again her priests
[58:49] have violated my law a profane might
[58:53] only things they have put no difference
[58:56] between the holy and profane and neither
[59:00] had they show difference between the
[59:01] unclean and the clean and have heed
[59:04] their eyes from my Sabbath's and I am
[59:07] profaned among them amazing or princess
[59:13] in the midst thereof are like wolves
[59:16] revenue prey he said to shed blood and
[59:20] to destroy souls
[59:22] to get dishonest gain this is amazing
[59:27] from the profits to the priesthood to
[59:32] the leaders it says to shed blood to
[59:38] destroy souls and to get dishonest gain
[59:40] that's the world we're living in
[59:43] and her prophets have dubbed them with
[59:49] on tempered mortar seeing vanity and
[59:53] divining lies unto them saying thus
[59:58] saith the Lord God when the Lord hath
[1:00:01] not spoken
[1:00:03] make sure it's God speaking through the
[1:00:05] ministry they met sometimes you can you
[1:00:09] can think that it's God's or that
[1:00:10] brother gone through that brother when
[1:00:12] it's not might be the devil a man could
[1:00:15] be a false anointing so he said when the
[1:00:19] Lord has not spoken they're saying the
[1:00:21] Lord said but he didn't forceful but he
[1:00:24] didn't the people of the land have used
[1:00:28] oppression and exercised robbery and
[1:00:31] have mixed the poor and needy yay they
[1:00:35] oppress the stranger wrongfully amazing
[1:00:40] wrongfully never had the right attitude
[1:00:43] and the right spirit and I sought for a
[1:00:48] man among them that should make up the
[1:00:51] hedge and stand in the gap before me for
[1:00:55] the land that I should not destroy it
[1:00:58] but I found none and is coming down to
[1:01:02] that place where he said if he didn't
[1:01:04] shorten time to be no flesh saved but
[1:01:07] for the elects sake thank God
[1:01:12] therefore he said have I poured out mine
[1:01:14] indignation upon them and I have
[1:01:16] consumed them with the fire of my wrath
[1:01:18] their own way am i recompense
[1:01:22] upon their heads saith the Lord God a
[1:01:25] man what a place what a position that
[1:01:29] Israel came to a man and what a position
[1:01:32] and a place that the Gentile churches
[1:01:36] and even among that it's not just out
[1:01:40] there it's even around the message oh
[1:01:42] yeah I witnessed that over the years and
[1:01:45] I've seen it come over the years little
[1:01:48] by little by little a man you'll find a
[1:01:50] lot of people not living for the Lord
[1:01:52] they're not living for the for the
[1:01:54] gospel they're not living for the
[1:01:56] resurrection that I live in for the
[1:01:57] rapture no no we're just living for
[1:01:59] themselves or they're living for family
[1:02:01] they're caught up with this to kind of
[1:02:03] with that but to not caught up with the
[1:02:05] Lord do not cut out with the word
[1:02:07] they're not caught up with the body of
[1:02:09] Christ no no no oh yeah I see it more
[1:02:13] and more of that now because why because
[1:02:17] they're getting away from the spiritual
[1:02:18] getting into a religious spirit and if
[1:02:20] you got a religious spirit you're going
[1:02:22] to focus on just natural things I'd like
[1:02:24] to do this and I'd like to do that well
[1:02:26] the bride likes to get out of here a man
[1:02:29] she got a spiritual a man she's
[1:02:32] spiritual but a lot of believers today
[1:02:34] are just religious and they're
[1:02:36] concentrating on natural life natural
[1:02:38] things that's the devil oh oh no well
[1:02:42] God is love yeah easily love all right
[1:02:44] prophet of God brought of that how that
[1:02:48] people knew they blow that out of
[1:02:50] proportion about God bought know he's
[1:02:52] God being good God is good god is good
[1:02:54] or he is good probably saying he's good
[1:02:57] all right he said but he said he's also
[1:02:59] a God of judgment and he said he got to
[1:03:02] come to judge you for this judging for
[1:03:04] that
[1:03:04] Oh is he good people think he's good
[1:03:07] this is what the problems were I
[1:03:08] lighting did people think God is good so
[1:03:10] god they he won't judge them for this he
[1:03:12] won't judge him for that brother he's
[1:03:14] gonna judge her for what he's revealed
[1:03:15] the word he's given you god help us
[1:03:19] brother please must be on our toes so
[1:03:23] that were not left out Anthony really
[1:03:27] members how many are really on the earth
[1:03:30] today that are bright material there's
[1:03:34] not many and they're getting less and
[1:03:36] less and less you know so the grace of
[1:03:40] God brother just consider the scripture
[1:03:42] we just read the position that Israel
[1:03:45] came to the position now that the church
[1:03:47] has come to amen
[1:03:49] God promised her stories real again
[1:03:51] he said I'm forever married to backs
[1:03:53] lady in Israel a man my brother when it
[1:03:56] come to the church no he was shorten
[1:04:02] time only for the elect and for the rest
[1:04:04] his judgment God's grace to us is my
[1:04:07] prayer so we're going to hear the
[1:04:09] prophet of God Minister on the subject
[1:04:11] of desperation amen and afters anything
[1:04:15] that the revelation of the word and
[1:04:18] prophecy in this hour
[1:04:20] produces in the bright it is desperation
[1:04:23] amen and are you desperate for the
[1:04:26] resurrection are you desperate for them
[1:04:29] considering what's going on and what's
[1:04:31] happening are you desperate to make it
[1:04:33] by the grace of God and God a respond to
[1:04:37] that desperation that's grace amen oh
[1:04:41] yeah no no I don't have to get desperate
[1:04:43] this grace oh yes you do God come down
[1:04:47] through Grace or two to those different
[1:04:50] disparate souls that's grace amen
[1:04:53] not because of yours the stairs I
[1:04:55] believe Lord in your head no no gods
[1:04:58] believe it in your heart and if you got
[1:05:00] it in your heart you're desperate
[1:05:02] amen you're desperate for the law Taylor
[1:05:05] Luther was desperate for justification
[1:05:07] Wesley was desperate desperate for
[1:05:09] sanctification the Pentecostals were
[1:05:11] desperate for the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:13] Ghost morning noon and night
[1:05:14] Oh were they desperate a male by the
[1:05:18] grace of God and God responded by grace
[1:05:20] he responded to that desperation
[1:05:23] and God it can respond to the blood
[1:05:25] desperation for the resurrection and the
[1:05:27] rapture God's grace to us as I rather
[1:05:30] Matthew brings the Prophet to minister
[1:05:32] to us amen
[1:05:34] God blesses and also
[1:05:40] he preached desperation p.m. amazing he
[1:05:46] preached the message he preached in the
[1:05:48] morning the token the token message and
[1:05:56] he says I'll give you the boat he says
[1:06:00] he said this message is the highlight of
[1:06:03] the entire ministry it's the highlight
[1:06:06] of his entire his ministry and the
[1:06:09] message of the hour what the token amen
[1:06:14] it's it's so now let's be desperate for
[1:06:16] the token amen god bless you
[1:07:28] and now we're going to read from
[1:07:31] Jeremiah the 29th chapter the 10th first
[1:07:35] what us saith the Lord that after
[1:07:39] seventy years be accomplished at babban
[1:07:43] I will visit you and perform my good
[1:07:46] word towards you in causing you to turn
[1:07:50] to this place for I know the thoughts
[1:07:53] that I think toward you is this we saith
[1:07:59] the Lord though thoughts of peace and
[1:08:04] not of evil to give you accepted in then
[1:08:11] shall you fall upon me and ye shall go
[1:08:15] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto
[1:08:19] you and ye shall seek me and find me
[1:08:24] when ye shall search for me with all
[1:08:28] your heart and I will be bounded you
[1:08:34] saith the Lord and I will turn away your
[1:08:38] captive and I will gather you from all
[1:08:41] nations and from all the places where I
[1:08:45] have drove you saith the Lord and will
[1:08:47] bring you again anton unto the place
[1:08:51] which i calls you to be carried away
[1:08:55] captive back to pinnacles i put that in
[1:09:00] myself it doesn't say that's what I was
[1:09:03] meeting to nature
[1:09:04] Luke 16 again 15 first
[1:09:11] our 61st the law and the prophets were
[1:09:16] until child since that time the kingdom
[1:09:19] of God is preached and presses into
[1:09:28] every man presses into it not just
[1:09:34] simply walks into it easy but it's got
[1:09:36] to be pressed into thing now when you
[1:09:41] seek me with all your heart then I'll be
[1:09:46] found and you promised that he would
[1:09:48] return and bring the people from
[1:09:51] scattered all the earth actually was
[1:09:53] seven years back into Jerusalem more
[1:09:56] than that from and he did it just that
[1:09:58] way that's right now we're going to talk
[1:10:01] on on desperations for a few minutes now
[1:10:05] usually it takes a state of emergency to
[1:10:10] throw us into desperation it's too bad
[1:10:14] it has to do this but human bees are so
[1:10:18] slothful in their lives their tastes an
[1:10:21] emergency something arises and when they
[1:10:25] do then it throws them into that
[1:10:27] desperation and really in doing that
[1:10:32] in desperation it brings out that real
[1:10:36] thing that you are it shows what you're
[1:10:40] made out of in the time of desperation
[1:10:44] it usually pulls out all the good things
[1:10:48] that's in the time of death other people
[1:10:53] when they know what they were dying the
[1:10:56] things that they kept secret all the
[1:10:58] right things the desperation they were
[1:11:01] trying to confess it see that time I
[1:11:04] take this and make it right go please go
[1:11:07] dude see and desperation y'all have done
[1:11:11] that before he they
[1:11:13] not wait till the time of emergency
[1:11:16] would you do so and so for me the
[1:11:19] emergency calls his desperation when we
[1:11:22] ought to do it without the emergency now
[1:11:26] we know it's tonight that we're taking
[1:11:30] symbols of the Passover and the Passover
[1:11:35] was taking in emergency in times of
[1:11:40] desperation you know in Exodus the trial
[1:11:46] chapter and the eleventh first of the
[1:11:48] truck chapter I believe it is it says
[1:11:50] eat this passover with the shoes on your
[1:11:54] feet with your loins Girt it up and with
[1:11:58] the staff in your hand see you're eating
[1:12:02] and desperation they had seen the great
[1:12:05] hand of God then I saw all these
[1:12:08] miracles the sign of their token and
[1:12:15] while they were under the sign of the
[1:12:17] tokens they'd taken their communion in
[1:12:21] desperation for they knew at that time
[1:12:24] God was fixing to strike with judgment
[1:12:28] and it was a shaking time it was a time
[1:12:33] where every man was examining himself
[1:12:36] because the word of the Prophet had not
[1:12:40] failed one time it had been proven to be
[1:12:44] true whatever he said it captain just
[1:12:47] exactly he said the fire was still there
[1:12:51] and then the Prophet a torn out that God
[1:12:55] only passed over when he saw the token
[1:13:00] at the door and it was a desperation I'd
[1:13:04] imagine the children when they saw was
[1:13:07] big black wings drop down from the sky
[1:13:09] like a smoke sailing over the city the
[1:13:13] screams coming from every house the Chu
[1:13:15] Romano
[1:13:16] daddy are you sure that we're under that
[1:13:20] token and he could go to the door look
[1:13:22] upon the poster little thing stop
[1:13:24] that's according to his word remember
[1:13:28] I'm your oldest child daddy are you
[1:13:30] positive I am positive that's according
[1:13:33] to what the Prophet told us and he has a
[1:13:35] word of the Lord say when I see the
[1:13:38] blood off heads over you take a lamp for
[1:13:41] the house I brought all you children in
[1:13:43] your firstborn
[1:13:45] that's the ones dying on the net but
[1:13:47] there is a brother that swap thus saith
[1:13:50] the Lord buzz so that's my son rest at
[1:13:55] ease because God made the promise think
[1:13:58] what daddy why you got your shoes off
[1:14:01] why you got the staff in your hand
[1:14:03] well you got a piece of bread in one
[1:14:06] hand and a lamb in the other hand why is
[1:14:08] that bitter herbs and days why are you
[1:14:11] eating lots of sweat round off your face
[1:14:13] about son yes he's gonna strike see it
[1:14:17] was in a time of desperation I believe
[1:14:24] that we're living in the days that we're
[1:14:27] otherwise the days that we're living in
[1:14:30] should cause the church to go completely
[1:14:33] into desperation
[1:14:36] I'll release since the message this
[1:14:39] morning from God not me I believe that
[1:14:42] order Joel this is our congregation into
[1:14:44] this Friesian we have played home enough
[1:14:50] we went to church long enough we got to
[1:14:54] do something how is it that we could see
[1:14:59] other great signs and wonders done on
[1:15:01] others and what about us this is called
[1:15:05] a state of desperation that we are
[1:15:09] determined before God the sides of his
[1:15:14] coming should bring this entire
[1:15:16] congregation when we've read it from the
[1:15:19] word the Holy Spirit tourists go has
[1:15:22] certain place such as such a thing what
[1:15:25] happened not tell us what it was but it
[1:15:27] would happen we'd go there it happens
[1:15:30] that way the newspapers packet the
[1:15:32] magazines package show the picture of it
[1:15:35] come back here and see those great
[1:15:38] mysteries hidden the Bible opens up to
[1:15:40] us on a field that we never know before
[1:15:42] and perfectly blends into the coming of
[1:15:46] the Lord Jesus and at the end of the map
[1:15:50] did you see the action of the great holy
[1:15:53] spirit seemed calm down visible before
[1:15:55] people even take pictures of it see if
[1:15:58] working and showing that is not a man
[1:16:01] it's not just a preacher it's not a
[1:16:04] certain congregation it's a holy
[1:16:07] experience showing the same thing it did
[1:16:10] when it was invited in the body of Jesus
[1:16:12] Christ it's embodied in the body of his
[1:16:15] bride it should thoughts in the
[1:16:19] desperation though Steve had seen the
[1:16:22] hand of God and the communion they took
[1:16:26] it with desperation because they know
[1:16:29] that something was fixing to happen and
[1:16:31] we know something fixed to heaven
[1:16:34] I remember the coming of the Lord will
[1:16:36] be a sudden secret going away you come
[1:16:40] and take her like a thief in the night
[1:16:42] and I think that if somebody all of a
[1:16:45] sudden or members of our family gone and
[1:16:48] you're left behind it should draw us
[1:16:51] into desperation by the grace of God
[1:16:55] will not be let back behind because
[1:16:58] anything not don't we don't leave these
[1:17:00] are they a few days to go away i sharing
[1:17:04] meadow thompson sang that song remember
[1:17:07] me when tears are falling down
[1:17:09] yes remember media when friends are not
[1:17:12] around
[1:17:13] well I've crossed over this river joy
[1:17:16] when you're calling your role remember
[1:17:18] me no the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:17:22] I want my name bro how do you remember
[1:17:25] me on the roll call
[1:17:27] I chose me in the desperation that is I
[1:17:33] pause it after I have preached the
[1:17:35] gospel should obvious a stowaway Slavia
[1:17:38] a cast off it could happen so shows me
[1:17:43] into desperate stage desperation to
[1:17:46] think of enter all these years of
[1:17:48] preaching when I could I a place karma
[1:17:52] rocket Bailey what's the next move what
[1:17:56] must I do next and throws me into a
[1:17:58] nervous stage now what can I do George
[1:18:01] Lee to the mountains into the valleys
[1:18:03] that's hard because while wizard people
[1:18:10] I've got to be all things to all man
[1:18:12] that I might win some of the Christ yes
[1:18:15] but that tokens always before me things
[1:18:19] see things is cutting up and you can't
[1:18:22] tell the people you see different things
[1:18:25] and your opinion then visions that they
[1:18:28] caught on and something to be sorry you
[1:18:30] did tell and you know better to do it
[1:18:34] and then you go so far visions to
[1:18:36] everything becomes a vision and
[1:18:38] Georgians are nervous stage you your let
[1:18:41] me take out my divisions back then the
[1:18:43] right
[1:18:43] is this official what about really
[1:18:45] standing at do you overwork yourself
[1:18:48] your ratash yourself and you find out
[1:18:50] things about people it's your wish you
[1:18:52] didn't know that people have desires
[1:18:54] these things and all these things they
[1:18:56] don't realize what that type of ministry
[1:18:59] cost you don't know what goes with it
[1:19:05] then it throws at the desperation Lord
[1:19:08] God no would have to answer jack more
[1:19:11] said to me one time I hate that answer
[1:19:13] like you have kids a day of the
[1:19:15] judgement said God has put these people
[1:19:19] into your hands and you're going to give
[1:19:21] it a count for every one of them you're
[1:19:23] going to answer for your ministry that's
[1:19:26] been about 15 years ago or maybe 18 in a
[1:19:31] desperation what will I do let me say
[1:19:34] only what you say Lord let me tell them
[1:19:37] what's the truth oh don't say nothing it
[1:19:40] throws the in desperation then see these
[1:19:42] signs coming seeing the Holy Spirit take
[1:19:44] us out there and bring these seals and
[1:19:46] lay them in like that bring the church
[1:19:48] age just lay down in they come down on a
[1:19:51] great big pillar fire backer to reveal
[1:19:53] himself they come down Olynyk bang all
[1:19:55] the seven seals and reveal it even put
[1:19:58] the papers and magazines they come in
[1:20:00] and take the angels of God that 7yz over
[1:20:03] the seven messages and confirmed it
[1:20:05] exactly what the Bible said then during
[1:20:09] that time come up and breaking the wood
[1:20:11] see you one of those signs flashes of
[1:20:14] the in time and bring it up to the beef
[1:20:16] will tell them how it was all about it
[1:20:18] the Lord working out there showing
[1:20:19] himself present and then got it down
[1:20:21] like this might calm and require that
[1:20:24] token on every person
[1:20:26] then you're like people you're the ones
[1:20:30] that all love these and them's listen to
[1:20:33] the tapes and so forth then you see what
[1:20:36] desperation puts me in a bad desperation
[1:20:39] sighs oh it's time to throw every member
[1:20:43] of Christ into desperation now about our
[1:20:47] souls about our our welfare for your
[1:20:51] actor well what are we going to mouth to
[1:20:53] if we gain the whole world what are we
[1:20:55] what are we living for what do you want
[1:20:58] for what are you eating for what is
[1:21:00] starving for to live what are you living
[1:21:03] for to die and you're not fit to live
[1:21:06] until you're fit to die true and we see
[1:21:12] some pain miracles of healing it should
[1:21:15] cut us into desperation Paul are you the
[1:21:25] boy here somewhere well here's a woman
[1:21:27] sitting on your ass talking about I just
[1:21:29] have to look over here if God can do
[1:21:32] that for that little boy Tori in the
[1:21:36] desperation a man from New Albany may be
[1:21:40] here tonight he's a friend of my brother
[1:21:43] roars I think his wife had cancer once
[1:21:48] and was healed and now the little boys
[1:21:51] got was so bad he's just in bad shape
[1:21:55] look I'm almost answer thrown himself
[1:21:58] and then he brought the little boy
[1:22:03] yes his hand up in the back back there
[1:22:05] it's pretty far the small you see
[1:22:08] desperation when the wife was about to
[1:22:11] die with cancer you know that God could
[1:22:14] heal her then God could heal alive God
[1:22:17] can heal along
[1:22:19] and throws it into a state of
[1:22:21] desperation see you must come and what
[1:22:24] you're desperate then God to listen to
[1:22:26] you you don't care where there does or
[1:22:29] not then that's different you say you do
[1:22:31] but it takes desperation to do it I
[1:22:34] believe that the reason we don't have
[1:22:37] desperation is because it's a lack of
[1:22:40] love God the love of God I think that
[1:22:43] the love of God causes desperation if
[1:22:47] God is in you the token inside of you
[1:22:51] and you see the conditions of times and
[1:22:54] people waiting in sin the way they are
[1:22:57] it'll throw you into desperation I
[1:22:59] believe it will
[1:23:01] now the word plainly states you don't
[1:23:03] put this down in Galatians five and six
[1:23:06] that faith workers ball of the feet
[1:23:10] workers below and the only one that you
[1:23:14] can have faith is heavy love first
[1:23:17] because after all faith is Laskin city
[1:23:21] you city that's exactly what my faith in
[1:23:24] get something cities your level if you
[1:23:28] don't have drugs you can't have faith
[1:23:30] see how can you have faith in your wife
[1:23:33] if you don't love her that's in delial
[1:23:36] the gospel to God how can it be if you
[1:23:41] don't love God if you said you love your
[1:23:44] wife and never tell her about it never
[1:23:46] make love to her express her to kiss her
[1:23:49] hug her and tell her she's the best cook
[1:23:52] in the country the things that you know
[1:23:53] how pretty she is and how much you love
[1:23:56] her if you don't do that she'll ever
[1:23:57] know it that's the way if you do not
[1:24:00] express it that's the way we do to gone
[1:24:04] when we sobbing we tell him about it
[1:24:07] we
[1:24:07] [Applause]
[1:24:08] worshipping teeth love promises today
[1:24:12] that all what if something's got to be
[1:24:15] done for your life
[1:24:16] wanna show you the desperation to get it
[1:24:19] done what somebody says your wife's got
[1:24:22] cancer
[1:24:22] what if somebody says your your wife's
[1:24:25] got TVs she's fixing diet you're doing
[1:24:28] anything see it'll throw you into
[1:24:30] desperation that's the same thing that
[1:24:33] it is we must have love before we can
[1:24:37] have faith in faith when we have genuine
[1:24:41] love what them to do it pushes our faith
[1:24:44] on the battlefront for all genuine godly
[1:24:51] love for God and for his word and for
[1:24:53] his people or pushed fades out there
[1:24:56] that just takes over faith and it's home
[1:24:59] let's go how'd it go
[1:25:02] oh that's what love does John 14:23
[1:25:06] jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep
[1:25:10] my words now you can't keep his word to
[1:25:14] hide and faith and I say see if he loves
[1:25:18] God then he keeps God's Word if he said
[1:25:22] out the Lord healed me he believes that
[1:25:24] love XE believe it because love
[1:25:27] dominates all you want to speak with Tom
[1:25:30] angels have not love it nothing see
[1:25:32] though I have faith to move mountains
[1:25:34] and have not laugh it's nothing
[1:25:36] love dominates all cause God is love a
[1:25:39] God of love now dead center if Jesus
[1:25:44] said if a man loves me he will keep my
[1:25:46] words we know it is true that God will
[1:25:50] meet a desperate soul now we don't know
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:55] but it usually takes something to drive
[1:25:57] us into that to despair to the
[1:26:02] desperation it takes something to do it
[1:26:04] we find out and change 5:15 I will say
[1:26:10] that the affectional that's desperation
[1:26:14] in factional righteous man availeth much
[1:26:21] what a righteous man a good man gets in
[1:26:25] travail our soul travel travail UI optic
[1:26:32] travels a better word for video Bailey
[1:26:51] course what the Bible said you're also
[1:26:54] and change 16 560 said if confessing our
[1:26:58] faults getting right make it ready far
[1:27:03] confess our faults one to know Foster
[1:27:10] ask people to pray confessing our faults
[1:27:12] walk together and praying one part of
[1:27:15] the other there you are with love love
[1:27:18] it I got comedies I can confess to you
[1:27:21] my wrong you can confess to me your own
[1:27:26] pray for you you pray for me almost stay
[1:27:29] with it with a macho thing that's
[1:27:34] desperation that's what we should have
[1:27:36] all the time let's take some scripture
[1:27:40] examples of that what happened now for
[1:27:43] another about 15 minutes allure buddy
[1:27:46] Jacob he was the man your first time
[1:27:50] every boy he thought his own line that
[1:27:55] he knew that the birthright and
[1:27:57] everything to him and he didn't care how
[1:28:00] I had to get it just so he got and after
[1:28:02] he got he thought everything was alright
[1:28:05] because he had the birthright he thought
[1:28:08] the thing was settled talked to his
[1:28:11] brother when he was hungry coming in
[1:28:13] from the field from working with the
[1:28:15] cattle and hunting the deer his brother
[1:28:18] yeah
[1:28:18] leaving a big part of punished Wow
[1:28:22] PZ the things together might have been
[1:28:25] very tempting when a man's hungry actual
[1:28:27] walking all day and his brother said I'm
[1:28:30] just about ready to feet give me some of
[1:28:32] this he said fella he conspired to me I
[1:28:34] get the birthright see he didn't care hi
[1:28:37] done it just so he got and he thought
[1:28:39] when he got the bread thought that soon
[1:28:41] Pentecost you thought because you were
[1:28:48] born of the Spirit harm to the Spirit of
[1:28:52] God the birthright that selling but it
[1:28:55] only starts you remember in the message
[1:28:58] of of hearing him oh that's a child
[1:29:02] after his bar in the bank of the Kama
[1:29:04] Sun it had rights to the first time but
[1:29:08] it had to be proven
[1:29:09] China tree and then if it did not prove
[1:29:14] out the piano pedia child to the
[1:29:16] father's will then it must be did not
[1:29:20] get these done because air in error
[1:29:25] nothing yet it was a son but he had
[1:29:28] nothing if he wasn't interested in the
[1:29:31] father's worth and so when the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost fell of all the Pentecostal people
[1:29:36] and they began to restore back the gifts
[1:29:39] and things that was in the church they
[1:29:40] thought because they were born to the
[1:29:42] spirit that settling but you see there's
[1:29:44] a place the other son and Exodus son
[1:29:47] proved to be a real son then he was
[1:29:50] taking a public place and then was set
[1:29:53] up and changed robes and set up there
[1:29:55] and then there was a placing of a son
[1:29:57] that he had and of everything the father
[1:29:59] had God did the same thing to his son
[1:30:01] oh man transfiguration it was over
[1:30:04] sheddeth but the cloud
[1:30:07] that was transfigured and his raiment
[1:30:09] shine like the Sun and a boy said this
[1:30:12] is my beloved Son in whom I'm well
[1:30:14] pleased Moses in the law and failed this
[1:30:18] is him yeah he was place dig now Jacob
[1:30:24] thought because that he had the
[1:30:26] birthright that everything was made so
[1:30:29] did the Pentecostal people and they were
[1:30:31] gonna organize it the one of the
[1:30:33] sweetest and Trinitarian of all kinds of
[1:30:35] organizations and to the point
[1:30:37] water prude if the token wasn't showing
[1:30:42] medalist simply strike see that's what I
[1:30:46] got you
[1:30:46] Oh see Jacob thought the same thing but
[1:30:51] in fear one night of his own life
[1:30:54] desperation took ahold of him what he
[1:30:57] thought the test across that river in
[1:31:00] her my brother's waiting to kill me he's
[1:31:03] going to see the bread right that he had
[1:31:05] gotten was the thing was going to cause
[1:31:07] his death and sometimes that third thing
[1:31:11] that you received as the Holy Spirit it
[1:31:15] is hard to get on the spirit if you
[1:31:18] don't want that same thing we'll
[1:31:20] continue with it right
[1:31:23] the very deep waters that saved or
[1:31:25] condemned the world the pain that that
[1:31:29] you would call fanaticism might be the
[1:31:32] very thing that condemns you at the end
[1:31:34] of the room ah Jacob knew that his life
[1:31:38] was cloaked at the end yeah a mess
[1:31:42] you're come told me that his brother
[1:31:44] with $400 man what's coming to me t
[1:31:47] notice it was on his room here
[1:31:52] he sent man on a head with oxen cattle
[1:31:55] and sheep to make a peace offering with
[1:31:57] Esau then after that he started for the
[1:32:00] nether older stuff then he started
[1:32:02] another group with another lorry stuff
[1:32:04] coming to mediate British guitar
[1:32:06] attorneys right
[1:32:07] then you got the thing is that won't
[1:32:09] stop in the ecology totally rich you're
[1:32:11] not he doesn't need it
[1:32:13] then he touches wives his little
[1:32:15] children and set them across and Esau
[1:32:17] would see that little children and his
[1:32:19] wife as it surely all these all known
[1:32:21] nieces and nephews
[1:32:22] he would not slam jacob cross the road
[1:32:31] these needs you know we have time in a
[1:32:34] car loan shyster before that their
[1:32:37] excuse expression but have a little
[1:32:39] maybe was to take up Jacob needs a
[1:32:42] deceiver and that's what he loved but to
[1:32:45] some happen to you desperation there may
[1:32:53] be men and women sitting in a place
[1:32:57] right before you and the only way you're
[1:33:00] gonna be able to achieve the thing that
[1:33:02] you're wanting is to desperately come
[1:33:13] when you pay for a back to the Holy
[1:33:16] Spirit their token don't say when I work
[1:33:19] John Lord o mercy pay your seat don't
[1:33:25] need it don't need to make it in if he
[1:33:27] comes it out pass through the prayer but
[1:33:29] the wall away I'll see if it doesn't be
[1:33:31] any good runs where you're at
[1:33:44] then God will move on
[1:33:46] that takes desperation to rain god of
[1:33:49] the sea Paul until he got ahold of God
[1:33:58] and when he did he wrestled not for 15
[1:34:02] minutes here at so cheap even his soul
[1:34:06] hold on
[1:34:08] it's still he knew he didn't have the
[1:34:11] bussy and he was able here at so

[2:15:47] grace Lord to help us that we will be
[2:15:50] desperate concerning what God has
[2:15:53] revealed to us oh yeah all down to the
[2:15:56] scriptures you go from Genesis to
[2:15:57] Revelation you'll find that that those
[2:16:00] that God dealt with they had a
[2:16:02] desperation that a spirit of desperation
[2:16:04] hunger and thirst for God for the things
[2:16:07] of God or for something they wander from
[2:16:09] God is not just casual you know not by
[2:16:12] any means they really showed an interest
[2:16:14] show God that you're really serious so
[2:16:17] show God that you're really sincere show
[2:16:19] God that you really mean it you know
[2:16:21] that's that's what God is looking at and
[2:16:23] there are those that are so casual with
[2:16:25] it that the Lord just goes on and
[2:16:27] pasture by but then there's others that
[2:16:29] are really desperate even if he's
[2:16:31] looking for desperation in any he's
[2:16:32] looking for desperation he and his sons
[2:16:35] and daughters you looking for
[2:16:36] desperation in the bride amen brother by
[2:16:40] the grace of God she says she wants to
[2:16:42] be desperate and she's focusing on the
[2:16:44] spiritual not on the natural and again
[2:16:48] the brother brought it out a brother
[2:16:50] brown-butter but concerning Ruth and so
[2:16:53] on and Naomi Ruth had a choice
[2:16:55] Naomi give her a choice Naomi give or
[2:16:59] pas that was her two daughters-in-law
[2:17:02] you know and she and she focuses she
[2:17:05] Naomi just was challenging their faith
[2:17:07] really it was God challenging their
[2:17:09] faith now Naomi and and God's gods
[2:17:13] through Naomi said to the stretch for
[2:17:14] them oh that's all right you don't have
[2:17:16] to come with me I'm going back to where
[2:17:19] my people are and so on and but you can
[2:17:21] go back to where your people are
[2:17:23] well Orpah kissed Naomi and went on
[2:17:27] but not Ruth the but the Bible says that
[2:17:31] Ruth cleave unto her all she did she it
[2:17:35] wasn't casual with her he was serious
[2:17:38] with with with Ruth a man Ruth had some
[2:17:41] revelation concerning Naomi that that
[2:17:43] open never had a man Ruth had some
[2:17:46] revelation concerning Jehovah that open
[2:17:48] ever had because the Bible says that
[2:17:50] Ruth went back onto her people and onto
[2:17:54] her gods and so on and they only was was
[2:17:57] encouraging
[2:17:59] Ruth now Ruth you go on back with her
[2:18:01] Ruth didn't know she's I'm going to go
[2:18:04] where your people are I'm gonna go where
[2:18:06] they die I'll die where they buried all
[2:18:08] be buried a man said she had a
[2:18:11] revelation there was something in her
[2:18:13] there's a desperation oh yeah she had to
[2:18:16] be a desperation for for Ruth to make
[2:18:19] the sacrifice that she made a man she
[2:18:22] was a widow or / was a widow Harper went
[2:18:25] back to her people don't find a husband
[2:18:27] back there another one but not Ruth no
[2:18:30] no no she didn't know what God had in
[2:18:33] mind for her but he wanted to go with
[2:18:36] Naomi she wanted to be with the children
[2:18:38] of Israel a man so brother was a
[2:18:41] tremendous witness or a testimony that
[2:18:43] that Ruth does Naomi's husband maybe was
[2:18:46] to Ruth that maybe Ruth Naomi's son was
[2:18:50] to Ruth a man the one that married her
[2:18:53] and the one to die but brother again we
[2:18:57] think oh why in the world did Naomi and
[2:18:59] her husband leave Israel during a famine
[2:19:01] and go down to this place and so on
[2:19:04] you know I'm David they were they were
[2:19:06] idolaters and so on pagan but a man but
[2:19:13] God saw Ruth God knew Ruth was there and
[2:19:16] Ruth was a predestinated seed of God
[2:19:20] hallelujah that maybe we would say that
[2:19:24] her name was on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:19:25] before the foundation of the world a man
[2:19:28] and but this is God's way of doing
[2:19:30] things a man and God sent said Naomi and
[2:19:34] and her husband down there and her and
[2:19:36] their two sons and they married those
[2:19:38] those two women a man but yet God knew
[2:19:42] that one of them was his child was his
[2:19:46] daughter in their souls praise the name
[2:19:49] of the Lord
[2:19:50] this is tremendous brother sister Oh
[2:19:53] again there's no book like this one
[2:19:55] you got religions and that around the
[2:19:58] world they got their books but I cheered
[2:20:00] it it's not like this one the story in
[2:20:02] their books is not like this one the
[2:20:04] plan the purpose the pattern in their
[2:20:06] books is not like this one and I was
[2:20:08] thinking about I said oh my lord my lord
[2:20:10] I said we got this book and there's are
[2:20:12] thousands and thousands and thousands
[2:20:15] and thousands of preachers around the
[2:20:17] world
[2:20:17] I said preaching out of this book a man
[2:20:20] they got this revelation this revelation
[2:20:22] that revelation but again that's not
[2:20:25] like the other religions the other
[2:20:26] religions are just gonna just going to
[2:20:28] read a form I saw just just a religious
[2:20:32] book and they'll read this read that and
[2:20:33] so on but when it comes to the Word of
[2:20:36] God and when it comes to the Bible a man
[2:20:38] the god that anointed them in the
[2:20:40] beginning he anoints them down through
[2:20:41] the ages the prophets he had nights of
[2:20:43] doubts for the ages the messengers and
[2:20:45] the fivefold ministry oh my they're all
[2:20:47] preaching this is absolutely amazing
[2:20:49] most words that mostest on fortunately
[2:20:52] there are some that just stick to or
[2:20:53] just they'll read the letter of the word
[2:20:55] letter of the Bible but most just
[2:20:57] consider how many preachers that God has
[2:21:01] ordained how many prophets that God has
[2:21:03] used down through the last almost six
[2:21:06] thousand years hey man brother
[2:21:09] it shows the brother is not man it's God
[2:21:13] absolutely
[2:21:15] so brother again when it comes to Ruth
[2:21:17] that God saw Ruth Naomi and her husband
[2:21:21] maybe didn't didn't know her sons didn't
[2:21:23] realize it a man but God took took me on
[2:21:27] his husband God took her sons that's
[2:21:32] right why did God do that why because it
[2:21:36] had to come to this place right here
[2:21:38] that they had to make a decision
[2:21:41] amen God was going to reach bring Naomi
[2:21:45] back to Israel praise the Lord
[2:21:48] all types of examples but God knew what
[2:21:51] he was doing
[2:21:51] a man and Orpah and a Ruth had to make
[2:21:56] their choice make their decision oh
[2:21:58] brother
[2:21:59] but brother in the plan of God was a
[2:22:03] Ruth and Boaz praise the name of the
[2:22:07] Lord
[2:22:07] oh just think of that it may be boy a
[2:22:11] thought or he would have a wife in in in
[2:22:13] Israel he or she would be a Jew no she
[2:22:17] was a Gentile hallelujah God's
[2:22:21] predestinated plan God's purpose gods
[2:22:25] types of examples to God be the glory
[2:22:28] hallelujah brother this is not some
[2:22:31] religion out there in Europe somewhere
[2:22:33] in Asia not not some religion other some
[2:22:36] other country no this is God's plan
[2:22:38] purpose and pattern brother see oh it
[2:22:43] just highlights so much but Ruth at a
[2:22:46] desperation that Orpah never had that's
[2:22:49] right she wanted she know I'm not going
[2:22:52] back there she said I'm going with you
[2:22:54] I'm gonna stay with you we're not going
[2:22:57] back there we're going to stay with the
[2:22:58] word we're gonna stay with the promise
[2:23:00] amen God has said in her heart a
[2:23:04] desperation oh yeah yeah sure yeah if
[2:23:07] you read the Book of Ruth if not much
[2:23:08] they're the only two or three pages you
[2:23:12] read it when roofing back Oh what did
[2:23:16] she do she felt she felt led to led to
[2:23:20] boy I believe his name is and so on and
[2:23:25] she felt led to do this do this Naomi
[2:23:28] said well just do this they were looking
[2:23:31] for looking for the Lord to meet their
[2:23:33] physical needs their natural needs for
[2:23:37] food and so on
[2:23:38] but God had a greater plan for Ruth and
[2:23:42] boys oh yes oh I thank God for that
[2:23:47] revelation I thank God for His Word
[2:23:50] Alleluia
[2:23:51] thank God for his plan and his purpose
[2:23:53] and his pattern praise the name of the
[2:23:56] Lord so brother let's be desperate for
[2:23:58] God and for this
[2:24:01] revelation of God what God wants to do
[2:24:04] in us spiritually not naturally by the
[2:24:07] grace of God there was a spiritual plane
[2:24:09] that God wanted to fulfill a man in Ruth
[2:24:13] and Boaz is a spiritual plan that God
[2:24:16] wants to fulfill in us by the grace of
[2:24:18] God God help us to be desperate a man as
[2:24:25] I said Ruth Luther was destined holy was
[2:24:27] desperate Wesley was desperate and I
[2:24:30] know others like the old fashioned
[2:24:32] Salvation Army they were desperate
[2:24:34] weren't they desperate for God and the
[2:24:37] things of God the blessings of the
[2:24:39] Pentecostals I know they were desperate
[2:24:42] they were brother didn't matter with the
[2:24:44] rain his brother Ben was bringing out
[2:24:46] there a man they stood in the rain
[2:24:49] praise the name of the Lord
[2:24:51] didn't matter we thought the weather was
[2:24:53] like they didn't hinder them from going
[2:24:55] to church or going to for a cottage
[2:24:57] meeting or fellowship or or a open-air
[2:25:01] service out there and as I said I've
[2:25:03] been experienced a number of open-air
[2:25:06] services around Newfoundland and so on
[2:25:09] and I believe thank the Lord for that
[2:25:11] grace I believe I preached the last
[2:25:14] open-air service in Newfoundland amen
[2:25:17] and as I said it was in Grand Falls and
[2:25:21] I think brother and brother cater there
[2:25:25] was was it was taking was add to control
[2:25:29] of it but I've ministered the word oh
[2:25:32] yes we got complaints and told us to
[2:25:34] turn down our PA system and there was a
[2:25:37] man sitting about three or four feet
[2:25:40] from me I was stood up with the
[2:25:42] microphone and two or three or four feet
[2:25:45] from me was a was a man that was drunk
[2:25:46] oh yeah he was drunk but he was in
[2:25:50] judgment against a lot of others because
[2:25:53] he stayed right there to hear the word
[2:25:56] and hear the message yeah and as I said
[2:25:59] I didn't know what was going on or what
[2:26:01] happened when I turned around and saw
[2:26:03] the police the police car was parked
[2:26:05] behind us and and I brother Aiden Kater
[2:26:08] at the time he he was he had to go over
[2:26:11] and and talk to the police because why
[2:26:14] they were trying to get us to bring it
[2:26:16] to a close and to turn everything down
[2:26:19] now so I said well Lord it's in your
[2:26:23] hands now hey man
[2:26:25] see it's desperation desperation I
[2:26:29] preached a preach to preach to preach
[2:26:30] and laid in the word for the glory of
[2:26:33] God Amen sir brother were witnesses of
[2:26:36] the truth we're not going to we're not
[2:26:38] going to change or be afraid or you know
[2:26:41] no no we're going to be a witness
[2:26:42] concerning what God has done and what
[2:26:45] God is doing by the grace of God amen he
[2:26:51] said again it was in the message
[2:26:53] desperation he said now watch what come
[2:26:58] after the seven seals
[2:27:01] he said the Uniting of the people he
[2:27:05] said United signs the red light flashing
[2:27:07] in the last days he said the sign of
[2:27:11] woman getting prettier man what they
[2:27:13] would do all these signs the Holy Ghost
[2:27:16] he said leading up and then he said come
[2:27:19] right back here to the capping off of
[2:27:21] all those messages since the seven seals
[2:27:26] what message is he referring to the
[2:27:29] token he preached that in the morning
[2:27:33] this in the evening he said the token
[2:27:36] message was the capping off of all those
[2:27:37] messages since the seven seals it's
[2:27:40] capped off in this one thing the token
[2:27:43] that we are all right just check
[2:27:47] ourselves and see if we are in the faith
[2:27:52] amen check ourselves and see if we are
[2:27:55] truly in the revealed Word of God by the
[2:27:59] grace of God and he said you can't be
[2:28:04] desperate he said till God speaks to you
[2:28:07] Oh Church rise shake yourself pinch your
[2:28:12] conscience wake yourself up in this hour
[2:28:15] we must be desperate or perish he said
[2:28:18] there's coming for something from the
[2:28:20] Lord I know it as thus saith the Lord
[2:28:23] there's coming for something and we
[2:28:25] better
[2:28:26] desperate a mint d'etre for the
[2:28:33] Resurrection desperate for the rapture
[2:28:35] and if you're desperate
[2:28:36] concerning it you're thinking about it
[2:28:38] morning noon and night yeah as us
[2:28:43] concerning the same of our house there
[2:28:45] and we're thinking about it morning noon
[2:28:47] and night but by the grace of God a man
[2:28:53] in our hearts were thinking about him in
[2:28:56] our souls we think about him a man and a
[2:28:59] brother Bob did mention at the beginning
[2:29:01] that sometimes we go through the day and
[2:29:03] we and we forget God we forget Jesus is
[2:29:05] there that's right
[2:29:07] but let's get desperate in our souls so
[2:29:09] that we don't forget it
[2:29:10] no matter what it is we're going to
[2:29:12] remember Jesus we're going to a man
[2:29:14] we're going to experience Jesus amen we
[2:29:18] love Jesus we want more for fellowship
[2:29:20] with him by the grace of God concerning
[2:29:22] what he's done for us what do you want
[2:29:25] to do for you he said it's between life
[2:29:31] and death and it is the resurrection the
[2:29:36] rapture is between life and death
[2:29:38] he said it'll pass through us and we
[2:29:42] won't see it let's get desperate so that
[2:29:46] we're not going to miss what God is
[2:29:48] doing
[2:29:49] amen but what God's doing he'll do it in
[2:29:54] you and through you he's going to bring
[2:29:56] the resurrection and the rapture to pass
[2:29:59] in us by the grace of God hey man where
[2:30:04] is the resurrection rapture seeing you
[2:30:06] see me grace as I said there were some
[2:30:12] thoughts on the rapture that I want to
[2:30:15] express again thoughts that I didn't
[2:30:18] know about before I never noticed before
[2:30:20] in the message amen I did I lied I
[2:30:24] preached on the rapture quite awhile but
[2:30:27] and that the opening of the seals brings
[2:30:31] us and gives us rapturing faith that's
[2:30:33] right but the problem of God highlights
[2:30:36] it in another way as well he
[2:30:38] and grace he said we must have love
[2:30:48] before we can have faith when we have a
[2:30:51] genuine love it pushes our faith out on
[2:30:54] the battlefront for God
[2:30:56] genuine godly love for God for His Word
[2:30:59] and for his people will push faith out
[2:31:02] there amen and again he highlighted to
[2:31:06] the scripture that I've also showed you
[2:31:09] first Corinthians 13 you can have all of
[2:31:12] this all of this all of that but if you
[2:31:14] don't have divine law it's all in vain
[2:31:17] just saying you can have the
[2:31:19] understanding of the mysteries of God
[2:31:20] the scripture and this one this one this
[2:31:22] and that know this and know that have
[2:31:24] this gift this gift but even if it's not
[2:31:26] motivated by divine love it's all in
[2:31:29] pain how many have believed this word in
[2:31:35] vain
[2:31:39] believe this message in vain he said we
[2:31:44] know it's true that God will meet a
[2:31:46] desperate soul but it usually takes
[2:31:50] something to drive us to that despair to
[2:31:53] the desperation it takes something to do
[2:31:55] it and we find out in James he said the
[2:31:59] effectual fervent prayer desperation he
[2:32:03] said fervent prayer of a righteous man
[2:32:05] availeth much yeah not casual a form of
[2:32:10] godliness prayer but a heartfelt Holy
[2:32:14] Ghost desperate prayer it's God crying
[2:32:17] out for what he wants to do amen
[2:32:21] it's God calling for what he wants to do
[2:32:23] in and through us he's the winner
[2:32:27] righteous man he said a good man gets in
[2:32:29] travail or soul travel
[2:32:32] he said travail or travel either which
[2:32:35] one you want to call it he said when the
[2:32:38] soul gets in desperation in travailing
[2:32:40] and effectual fervent prayer of a man
[2:32:43] that can show the token it does
[2:32:45] something praise the name of the Lord
[2:32:51] we'll stay with it with an effectual
[2:32:54] fervent prayer until it's answered
[2:32:56] that's desperation that's what we should
[2:32:59] have all the time amen
[2:33:03] grace god bless his word to our hearts
[2:33:07] and grace that the Holy Ghost will take
[2:33:09] control to bring us to desperation amen
[2:33:14] to God be the glory amen god bless you
[2:33:20] let's stand praise the Lord
[2:33:26] let's be desperate for those that were
[2:33:28] praying for a man God's grace again to

[2:33:40] different or to jury your son your
[2:33:43] daughter your husband your way you'll be
[2:33:44] different but what about that that other
[2:33:46] one there you should have the same
[2:33:48] desperation by the grace of God amen the
[2:33:53] same victory ahead when the host of
[2:33:56] Israel led by God round the walls of
[2:33:59] Jericho softly trot trusting in the Lord
[2:34:02] they felt the conquerors tread it was by
[2:34:05] faith desperation they saw the victory
[2:34:08] ahead a man desperation faith you've got
[2:34:13] a real genuine thing it'll lead to

[2:34:24] have gone before to that land by debts
[2:34:27] River cold and dark I shall stand
