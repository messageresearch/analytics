Lord, we praise your name this morning. Lord, we lift our voices. We lift our hands.

You are worthy of the glory and the honor that goes with it, heavenly father. Lord, we're so thankful this morning for your presence. Lord, we're thankful for your blessings. We're thankful for your joy. We're thankful for your peace. Lord, we're thankful, Lord, for a desire in our hearts to come and worship a living God. Lord, we just want to give you this service. Lord, we want to give you your time, Lord. We want to give you the opportunity to speak into our lives, Lord. That you would peer into our souls, Lord. That every door of our hearts would be open this morning, Lord. That you would speak, Lord. Not a man, but the spirit speaking through him, heavenly father. Lord, have mercy and grace on us this morning. Lord, touch us once again. We pray. Lord, we commit it into your hands now, trusting you in all these things. [music] In Jesus Christ's name we ask and pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would to Psalm chapter 8 this morning. [snorts] Amen. Certainly enjoyed the song service in there. Wished I could be out here enjoying it, but it was good to hear the worship and the praise. Amen. God bless you each one for coming this morning and putting your shoulder to the wheel. Amen. A few uh a few announcements this morning. Remember, we have communion next Sunday. So, please remember that. Come prepared for that. We've got special meetings coming up the Sunday afterwards, Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday morning as usual. Then, we'll have a fellowship on Sunday afternoon as well. We've got Brother Bill Puy coming from Dallas. So, we certainly encourage you to come and and participate in those if you can. We want to welcome the Wiffin family here this morning. God bless you. Good to see Jody and Karen with us and the boys. Amen. Always wonderful to have them with us. Good to have brother Matt back with us. Uh I think he's taken the title of great white hunter from me from my first hunt alone. Amen. The Lord granted him two moose up there through uh through a week's worth of hunting. So we're thankful for that. Good to have him back as well. Also remember the Christmas program is now December the 14th, not December 7th. That didn't really matter to anyone else, but allowed Sister Nikki to be a part of that and we certainly appreciate that. So we move that to December 14th as well. Amen. God bless you. Let's uh read Psalm chapter 8 this morning. And it says, 'When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained. What is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor. Thou mst him to have dominion over the works of thy hands. Thou hast put all things under his feet. Amen. And God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. And we're starting a new chapter, a new series this morning. And this has been a burden on my heart for a while. I look around and I see what we're facing. I see in particular what our young people are facing these days. And I know what I used to deal with as a young person. And I'm I'm that special generation that came out of a more traditional way of doing things into the more technologically driven way of doing things. And so I kind of have a foot in the past and I have a a foot in the present, so to speak. And I know how hard it was as a young man, as a teenager, even the things that were offered to me, the things that were given to me, the things that were placed in front of me. And yet, I look today at what young people face, and I say, "Lord, how can they make it through? How can they make it through? It's so difficult. It seems unbearable the onslaught that they face from what Satan's trying to present to them. And it's not just the young people that are dealing with it. It's the middle-aged. And guess what? It's the older folks as well." Amen. Satan's working on all of us. And we're facing an enemy with thousands of years of experience. And we have but a few. You know, the best of us might get 70 or 80 out of it, maybe even 90. But he's got thousands of years of experience. He's got devils with thousands of years of experience. And he studied humanity. And it seems so often when we look around this world, there's more on his side than ours. But, you know, we've got to be able to see beyond the the the realm of the scene and the natural. And we've got to be able to see what is the unseen. Because remember when the prophet and his servant were in that city that was surrounded by chariots and horsemen and he said there's more with us than there are with them and he said Lord open his eyes and he saw the hills were surrounded with flaming horses and chariots. Amen. Only a third of the of the angels got kicked out of heaven. There's twothirds that are on our side and there's a whole lot less people that those angels have to cover. So there's more with us than them. But we've got to realize who it is that's with us when we fight these things. But the Satan's trying so hard to get our attention, to bombard us with things, to to get us frustrated, to get us annoyed, to to take away our peace and our joy and our love, and to fill our time and to fill ju just to to to completely overwhelm us. That's what he's trying to do, to get us to break. Amen. And so many times it seems like he's just sapping the life out of us. Anyone ever get to the end of a day, get to the end of a week, and you just feel like there's nothing left to give. Amen. And that's why we need to come to church. Amen. It reminds us who's Sybron. It reminds us who's fighting with us. It reminds us of our position in Christ. But I wanted to open with this scripture today because I want to start with who we are and what our position is. Amen. If we can keep our eyes focused on where God has placed us, what God has made us to do, then that'll set our footsteps properly day by day if we remember what we're built for. Amen. We were made to have dominion over everything that God created. Everything. Everything. Can you say it with me this morning? Everything. Everything that he created. The works of thy hands. Everything that he created. Thou hast put all things under whose feet? &gt;&gt; Yours. &gt;&gt; Mine. Amen. That's what we want to talk about. So, I want to take a a new series and I want to call it a position of dominion. Amen. And we're going to be on this a while. It's going to be a real rubber meets the road type of series. I'm going to be getting into the things we face, the battles we face, how Satan comes at us, how we defeat him, how he's already defeated. Amen. How that God works through us, how the Holy Spirit works through us. And so, I want to start with a a subtitle for this first service of the first battle. And if you know me well enough by now, you know where we're going. You know, we always have to start in the book of Genesis because that's the seed chapter. And anything you see in the Bible, it started in Genesis and it's reaped in in Revelation. You see the seed planted in Genesis and you see the full harvest of it in Revelation. And through the middle, yes, we get glimpses and we get we get a view of what's been going on. But in the book of Revelation, that's when the big picture is revealed. That's when we see what was really right, what was really wrong, what was really true, and what was really false as well. And so we go to Genesis 1 and it says, "So God created man in his image. In the image of God created he him. Male and female created he them." He only made them two genders. If anybody's wondering, he said, "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it. subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. So, I want you to see your position. Now, this is the seed. This is the origin. This is the perfect placing of mankind. Is that you are meant to have dominion over everything you see, everything you face on this earth is under your feet. Absolutely. Every part of it. Amen. You are created to rule on earth. You are created to have dominion on earth. You are created to have authority on earth. You are created to control all things on earth. That's the that's the position, church. And this is by creation, not by works. Your created purpose is to have dominion. Amen. Catch that thought. You're created to do this. It's not that you deserved it. It's the way that God made it. But God put a boundary around that dominion. And that dei that boundary was based on relationship to God. And relationship to God was based on obedience to the word of God. So the boundary of dominion is found by the word of God. Remember we preached on this recently on our Wednesday night service that there were three things that mankind had at the beginning. They had dominion. They had eternal life. And they had relationship with God. And the dominion and eternal life were conditional on relationship with God which was found through the word of God. Amen. All of it came back to the word of God. Without access to God, with the a failure to obey the word, they would lose access to God. They'd lose eternal life and they'd lose their dominion. So, watch what God said. Watch the boundaries God puts on it. He says, "And the Lord God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. God gives them total liberty to do whatever they want except one thing. There's only one exception. God says you can do whatever you want. Whatever is in your heart, do it except for one thing. Amen. Church, the principle is this. The word is the key to your dominion. The word is the key to your dominion. They'll rule and reign. They'll have dominion as long as they don't do what he said. As long as they do what he said in verse 17, don't eat the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Amen. So their power does not come from themselves. Their power comes from the word. I want you to catch that today. Amen. Your power is not of yourself. That means your dominion is not of yourself. Your overcoming is not of yourself. But it comes through obedience to the word of God. Your power is in the word of God because God is not backing you up. God is backing his word up. I don't know if anybody's noticed recently, we're fickle. We change. We have our ups. We have our downs. We have our ins. We have our outs. We have our days of great joy. And then the next day, we're in depression. We are not stable. But the word of God is unchanging. And when we take the word of God into our hearts, put it upon our lips, that's what God is backing up is his word. because his word is the thing that does not change. He doesn't change. His word doesn't change. Amen. And it's because we're in obedience to the word that God backs us up. Amen. The word of God is what upheld Adam and Eve and kept them in dominion. But we saw as we preached on Wednesday night in our other series, what is the result of the disobedience to the word? Death. It's always death. And it's not just natural death. It's not loss of life. But we saw that death is separation from God. And we see that's what happened. He said, "The day you eat thereof is the day you'll die." And that day they did not lose breath, but they were separated from God. They were separated from the tree of life. That was Christ. They no longer had relationship with him. They no longer had access by their own uh request or by their own needs. But it would only be by his sovereign will that he would do it. Amen. God said, "The day you do something contrary to my word, that's the day you're separated from me." And that's exactly what happened. Amen. And it took the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary to pay those sins so that we could have instant access back to God. And we preached on that. He opened up the veil to the Holy of Holies where his shikina glory dwelt. And he was showing the way back is open. The way to fellowship with God is back open. Now, we've preached on the original sin. We're not going to do that this morning. so much. And we're not talking so much about what happened this morning, but how it happened. And the reason for that is because the when it comes to preaching about the trials that we face and the battles we face, I can't fathom everything you're going to face. I can't predict. I can't prepare you for everything on a specific basis that you're going to face. But if I can show you how Satan works and I can show you how God works, you'll learn to discern which is which. and you'll learn how to respond when you're facing a battle, when you're facing a a circumstance in your life. Amen. So, we want to reveal what Satan does and we want to reveal what God does and it'll give us overcoming power if we can do that. Now, we look at this first battle in Genesis 3 and the scripture says, "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, yay hath God said, ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden." We're going to be preaching a lot on overcoming and how do I overcome in this series, but I want to start out with this thought of recognizing our enemy and his tactics. Amen. Recognizing our enemy and his tactics. The scripture says that the serpent was more subtle. That word means he was more cunning, more crafty, more shrewd than any creature. He could speak. He could hold a conversation. And remember, he wasn't in the form of a snake like we see today. That's his cursed form. But in his original form, he was upright like a man. He could talk. He could reason. He was beautiful to look at. We see the beauty today. The beauty carried over, but the form got lost. They keep looking for the missing link between animal and human. The serpent's it. And you can't find it because God changed him in a moment. That's why they can't find it is because it's no longer there. But Satan in or this serpent was was so appealing to the natural senses in every way. He said the right part thing. He looked the the right part. His He he he he appealed to the outer five senses very well. He appealed to the inner five senses very well. Amen. He was a a whole service being. He could attract every part of your natural body. Amen. And even this church, he was religious. He liked to talk about the word of God. Amen. But he's subtle. And the point that I'm making here is that Satan is not obvious. He's not obvious. And the thing is, when you're well taught by the word, he can't approach you with the obvious. You would think he can't do it because we'll notice that. But if he can do something subtly, that's just a little bit off. If he can get us to move just a little bit off, that's all he's looking because a foot off today is a mile off next year. All he's looking is for one footstep a day. An inch a day will add up over the course of time. But what Satan does is always done in shadows. He's trying to hide the real effect. So he's never going to give you that upfront. Amen. And so Satan's not easy to pin down. It's not easy for us to say about a person or situation. Well, that's Satan. Or there's something wrong here. There's something wrong there. But we've got to be able to sit back sometimes and just say, Lord, let's wait on you. Judge all things. Amen. Give it time. We don't have to be in a hurry about everything. But Satan doesn't generally be he isn't generally blatant with believers because it doesn't tend to work. But what he tries to do is get you to have a conversation. He wants to get you responding to his questions, to his comments rather than feeding the word. He doesn't want you saying the word. He wants you to get to think about it. He wants to get into your head. He tries to get you to consider something for a while. That's all he wants you to do. In short, he's trying to get you to doubt an absolute so that he can get you onto something else. Paul would say it like this. He says, "Lest Satan should get an advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices." The Common English Bible says it this way. He says, "This is so that we won't be taken advantage of by Satan because we are well aware of his schemes." The purpose of this series is to reveal how Satan works and to show us how we can fight against him. Now listen to this quote. He says, "Overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks." He says, "A lot of people say there is no devil. It's just the thought." Do you catch what he's saying right there? Because people say, "Well, I just had a thought and it wasn't good, but it was just the thought. That's just something in my head." He's saying, "No, that's not a thought. That's Satan trying to talk to you. That's cha Satan trying to plant a seed in your head. That's Satan trying to lodge something that will stick and cause doubt." Okay? People think, "No, I developed that thought. I created that." Church, if you've been a Christian long enough, you know you can be sitting there doing nothing but good and a bad thought will come into your mind out of the blue. You can be focused on the right thing, doing the right thing, and the wrong thought will drop in. Church, we do not create thoughts, we receive thoughts. There's two spheres of influence. There's God, and there's Satan, and they're both trying to press in. And when God's trying to do something, we'll see this in a moment. Satan's always trying to dump something else in your mind. He's always trying to get in there. We are not. We are receptors. We think we're creators. We're not. We're receptors for these things. He says, "That's not there is no devil. It's just a thought." He says, "Don't you believe it? There's a real devil. He's just as real as you are are or anybody, a real devil, and you must recognize him real. You must know that he's a devil." Now, we saw we saw what Paul said that we're not ignorant of Satan's schemes and tricks and methods. And we shouldn't be. But sometimes we go along with them because we think we're more than a match. We think because we see where he's trying to take us and we know he's trying to take us there. We can go a little ways and not go all the way. We can do something without being the way everybody else always goes. He won't get me the way he's gotten everybody else. I can control it is what we say. I know this probably isn't in my best interest. I know this isn't really according to the word of God, but because I know upfront that I'm not supposed to do it or it's not good for me, I'm going to keep it in moderation. Church, we're going to see this as we go through this series. We're going to see it from people in the Bible. And if it happens to them, it happens to us. That sin will take you further than you ever meant to go. And knowing upfront that it is sin does not make it right. It doesn't make it controllable. And it doesn't give you overcoming power to know what it is. That's just the first step to recognize it upfront. Okay? Amen. A move away from the word of God is still a move away from the word of God whether you recognize it or not. And recognizing it doesn't change what it is. But you overcome when you refuse him upfront. You overcome when you walk away up front knowing what's going to happen and going along with it anyways. That's insanity. That's delusion, church. That's not the way that God works. And somehow we do that. Amen. And thinking that you're not going to go as far as somebody else is a root of pride in you. It's a delusion of your own power. And Satan dwells in pride. And we'll see that as we go. That people that thought they were something and they played with fire and they got judged by it. They got burnt by it. Somebody paid a price because they thought they could handle it. So he says you got to know he's a devil. But he says then the same time that you recognize him and know he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the God that is where in you in you has he says is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has what already overcome him. You say, you know, I I opened up with we're facing such an onslaught. We're facing such uh struggles in our lives. Our young people are completely overwhelmed. And and we say, who can defeat him? He's already defeated. But the source of power to defeat him has to be a God that's inside of you, not a God that's outside. Not mama's dad, not dad's dad. He's got to be my God dwelling inside of me because he's the mighty conqueror. I'm not the mighty conqueror. He's the mighty conqueror. And we're facing a defeated foe. And all we got to do is recognize our position and recognize that the God that's greater in us is greater and mightier than he is. That the one that's in you has already overcome him. Amen. He says, "And by his grace, not by wisdom, not by discipline, not by teaching, not by self-will, by his grace, you who? You are more than a match for him." Amen. That's real overcoming. When who recognizes? When you recognize, you've got to recognize that you have overcome because greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. That's when you realize I can win because I've got God inside of me. That's the only way you can win. A change of mind won't do it. It's a start. He does that. A change of heart won't do it. Change of mind, that's all good. change of spirit. That's great. But there's got to be something on the inside. There's got to be a new birth that has to happen there. This is the whole intention of this series is to sharpen your discernment so you see Satan up front for what he is. Amen. So that you can recognize him up front rather than halfway down the path he's led you. Amen. How many wants to recognize him up front? I don't want to walk down any roads that he's leading me. I want to recognize him upfront. Amen. The goal is not to battle him. The goal is to refuse him. &gt;&gt; The more you fight, the more he wins. But to refuse him. To refuse him. Resist and walk away. That's the tactic of the believer. Amen. We see Jesus did it. And that's our goal for it as well. But remember, Satan is subtle. He's not going to be obvious. Satan will play the long game. Okay? Satan is patient with his tactics. He's always looking for that perfect opportunity and he'll look for it. You'll watch it in hockey or any sport really. The best players, they're just playing for that one mistake. That's all they do. And I know these brothers that have played sports, all you do, you make one mistake and the good players will score on you every time. They'll make you pay for it, won't they? They're just looking for a mistake and they're only playing for your mistakes. Satan's the same way. He's looking for the day when you're down. He's looking for the day when you're tired. He's looking for the day when you got no more to give. He's looking for the day when you've got a hunger. And he'll wait for that day and then he'll give you the opportunity. He's very patient. We know that this this thing with Eve did not happen overnight. This was not a 30-se secondond conversation. This was over days and weeks and months and maybe years. The scriptur is not going to detail every conversation they had, but it culminated in this one. Okay? But I think the idea of of Satan putting bait on a hook is a good analogy because he waits till you desire something, till you've got a hunger for something and then he slips you what? Bait big enough to cover the hook that ties you to him for a season. That takes you down a pad. Takes you to someplace that you don't want to go. Now, watch what this woman says. He says, "Has God said you can't eat you can eat of all the trees?" She says, "The woman said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest she die." So, is Eve's doctrine sound? Yes, she's saying exactly what God said. She's standing on the word. She's repeating what God said. Is she secure in her knowledge of the word? Absolutely. She's saying what God said, church. That's the starting place. Say what God said. She's done nothing wrong here in and of itself. Now, I'd argue she has a problem cuz she's having a conversation with something under her dominion. We preached on that before, but let's leave that aside. We're going to have conversations, but let's watch what happens. It says, "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die." What did God say? you shall surely die. He said, "You shall not surely die." But he didn't stop there. He never stops there. He has contradicted the word. But watch what he does now. He says, "For God do know that in the day that you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." So here's the bait. The hook is you shall not surely die. the bait that he said. Well, one, that's part of the bait, but he's he's contradicting the word, but he doesn't stop at contradicting, but rather he gives a reason for the contradiction, and he says, "You won't die. God's just guarding his own superior position and trying to keep you from being just like him. He knows things you don't know. He experiences things you don't know. And he wants it all for himself." And God's just trying to bluff you with his word to keep you from going to a level that he's at. So the bait is be like God. And it's based on the premise that the word of God is a lie, church. But you see what Satan's done here? He's made God out to be what he is. He's telling her, God is what Satan really is. But he's presenting himself as the good guy, as the the guy that's going to set her free, the guy that's going to level her up. He's presenting himself he's presenting her with great enlightenment enlightenment. And he's saying God's trying to limit you and I'm trying to raise you up. And what he doesn't say is God has already placed you as high as you need to be in a perfect place of blessing. And if you do it my way, you're going to fall. Satan's trying to offer her a higher place or give her more by going against the word. And he puts God as the bad guy. And he paints himself as the good guy. And it's based on an inner desire within Eve for more. See, he's seen a desire. He's seen a hunger there. And he's starting to feed that. Amen. You'll see that Satan's seduction appeals to me. It elevates me. It's fun for me. It's good for me. It benefits me, but the kingdom of God is not addressed. And God is certainly not addressed. Satan's feeding on what do you want? What will make you feel better? What will make you greater? It's the Mi monster all over again. Satan feeds the Mi monster. Listen to this. He says, "The prince of the power of the air, Satan, is always near to try to get something fumbled up in your mind. He's trying to get you to think about it. He's trying to reason with you. He's trying to get you to dwell on it. He's bombarding you with these things so that you'll get jumbled up so that you can't put it straight. So you can't determine what's right and what's wrong, what's up and what's down, what's black and what's white. He's trying to blend it so everything is gray, everything is allowable, everything is right, everything is good. We're going to preach on mind battles, which is the greatest battle that we fight. But I want you to see here that Eve has a choice to make. That's all this is, church. It's a choice. And for the believer, there's only two choices. There's a right one and there's a wrong one. I don't care what your situation is. There are never two right choices and there are never all wrong choice. Some are always wrong. Sometimes it's the wrong question being asked. And that's why we don't answer Satan according to his questions. Sometimes he gives us a question that you can't answer, right? And that's when you walk away. But watch this. We have two ways that we can respond. The first choice, stay there. Keep talking. See where it goes. That's the first choice. Continue the conversation. Dig deeper. Try to understand to make a rational decision. In other words, encourage doubt in the word of God. And the second choice is this. Repeat the word and walk away. That's it. You can continue the conversation or you can end the conversation. And if you repeat the word and walk away, what do you do, church? You enforce faith. You encourage faith. So you can encourage doubt in the word or you can apply and encourage faith in the word. There's no other choice. It's either doubt the word or believe the word. And if you stay and try to listen to something contrary to the word, eventually you will turn that staying and listening into acting contrary to the word. Because you are what you eat. You listen to something contrary to the word, it'll turn you against the word. in that area. Amen. But if you repeat the word and walk away, what does it do? It establishes your foundation and it builds you higher up in your faith. Amen. And you don't waste your time fighting a battle you're not supposed to fight. The idea is to always keep the word in front of you. Always keep the word in front of you. Watch this. He says, "Don't you realize that Eve was seeking new life when new light when the devil talked to her and it caused every graveyard to be out here? caused every insane institution, every penal farm, caused every death, every soul, every starving baby, every dying mother. She was searching for something new. She was looking for something she could do and find new. Church, can I say it this way? Stick with what has been proven to work. Eve was perfectly satisfied until Satan came and started talking to her. She was happy. She was at peace. She was at rest. But somebody comes and tries to paint a better picture. What does it do? It can ignite a desire that was never there before. Why? Because you listen to it. Because you listen to it. I was talking with someone this week and and they were saying, "We always want to try to find something different that works for us. We want to find something that's special to us. We want to find something that's easier for us, something that appeals to us. And we never want to do what works. And that's the human nature. That's the human nature. Amen. We don't want to do the hard work of just doing what is proven to work. We want to do it some other way. There are no shortcuts without consequences. That's what Satan offered Jesus. Short shortcuts supposedly without consequence. In fact, skip the consequences and go straight to reward. Well, see, that's what Satan does. You know, if it's health related, you want to be healthy, church. There's only three things you really need to do. Eat healthy in moderation, exercise semi-regularly, and get a good night's sleep. That's generally it. Stress plays in there as well. That's a big part of it. But if you want to be healthy, eat healthy in moderation, exercise in moderation, and get a good night's rest. But what do people do? They go on extreme diets. They go on extreme health diets. They go on no food diets. They go on all liquid diets. And what happens is inevitably they fall off the wagon before they complete the journey or they're sick cuz the body's not meant to live that way. God didn't put us here to hold us back from everything. But in moderation, our health is. I know a brother that got lap band surgery on his stomach. Do you know what that is? They take the stomach and they put uh they they basically cinch it down like it's a little tiny balloon and all you it's the size of your fist when they're done. That's as much food as you can have. Not even that big. He was over 300 lb. And you know what? For a while he lost weight. But what happened was he wasn't changed. Only his stomach was changed. And eventually he just kept eating and eating and eating and he lost some weight. And then he went back and he's bigger than ever now. Why? Because he didn't do the harder work of doing what works. He took a shortcut and nothing changed inside of him. You know, on our Christian walks, people want to come have a a great ministry come. They want to have special services. They want to have camps. And they believe, well, if we can just get into that atmosphere, then I can be changed. I'm not saying you can't. People want to to to to have some some great man come in and lay hands on them. And and if he'll lay hands on me, then he'll fix my my my marriage. He'll he'll fix my body. He'll fix my financial woes. He'll fix my ups and downs. He'll fix my in and-outs. Church, that's not the way it works. Some ministry ain't going to save you. It's going to take the Holy Ghost. It's going to take an experience with a living God to change us. Amen. And a simple fact is this. If you want to be close to God, first you've got to get close to God. You need a new birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that changes you from the inside out and makes you accept the word of God. And then from that moment, you have to feed that relationship. You have to read your Bible every day. You have to pray to God every day. That means have a conversation with God every day. And you need to regularly attend the preaching of the word of God. There is no shortcut to a good relationship with God. You need to talk to him. You need to read his word. You need to hear his word. That's it. Supernatural events won't change that. Gifts and signs and wonders and miracles and healing won't change that. Israel had all those things and all but two died in the wilderness. You need a personal relationship that you're feeding every single day. Otherwise, we get a camp mentality. We get a special meeting mentality. And all we do is we bounce from camp to camp, from meeting to meeting. And in between, you know what we are? failures. And I'll tell you this, we come into camp, we think we won the victory. You didn't win anything. All you did was you had an emotional high. And you walk out and nothing changes. And within a week or two, you're back where you were before. Why? Because Satan's fooled you into looking for an emotional experience rather than a dayby-day harder work. Success looks a lot like hard work. They say that's what it is. That's what it is. It goes for everything. Eve didn't stick with the proven word. Amen. She made the wrong decision. She stuck around. She let herself be convinced. She stepped out from behind the protection of the word to listen to something that she thought was better. And she took the reasoning of Satan. Church, reasoning is not our friend. For the believer, reasoning is not where it's at. You know, there's only one person God ever said to reason with. Who? Him. He said, "Come, let us reason together, saith the Lord." He said, "Watch what happens when you reason with him, church. Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they'll be as wool." And then he follows that up and he says, "If you be willing and obedient to follow my word, then you'll be blessed." So the reasoning that God's looking for is to take us into his presence and let him reason with us. You know what Job's problem was? People were trying to reason with him through their experience. And three men, religious men, gave him bad advice. And finally, the young guy had to stand up and say, "I I've sat and I've listened. I've been respectful, but I can sit still no more and hear what the Lord would have to say. And then after that, we see after Eli who sits down, God starts to talk with Job. And God starts to reason with Job. And pretty soon, Job says, "I have spoken twice, yay, three times. I will be silent." That's the reasoning we need to get to. Not up here. Up here. That's the only reasoning we're looking for is to reason with God through his word. Not try and argue, not try and fight, not try and persuade. Let him show us his truth. Let him show us his way and from there we'll come out just right. Amen. The only reasoning we should say is what does the word say? What does the full word say? Because Satan will give you one scripture and he'll ignore the other 14 that aren't quite in line. He'll interpret it for you. Amen. But watch what happens with Eve. She made the wrong decision. It says, ' And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eye, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also under her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sowed fig leaves together, and made themselves e aprons. Church, I want to ask you a question. Who got Eve out of position? Did the serpent get Eve out of position for the Garfield? Did they even Who got Eve out of position? Was it the serpent? Eve got Eve out of position. Who pulled her out from behind the word? Did anyone pull her or did she step out? She stepped out. Amen. She made a choice. Satan didn't get her out of position. She chose to move out of position. She was convinced that what she was hearing was better than what she had. And by choice, she stepped out from behind to the protection of the word. Why am I saying that, church? Because Satan has no power to make you do anything. He has no power over you. He has no control over you. He has no say in your life. Who does? You do. You do. Amen. He has no power to make you do something. He has no power to keep you from doing something. He can place roadblocks in your way. And we'll use those as excuses because that's what he does. He gives us excuses. He gives us reasons. But in the end, there is never a reason to disobey the word of God. None. Zero. Amen. He has no power over you, church. You are not bound to him in any way. What Satan has is an opportunity to present you with a choice. And that's exactly what he does. He's presenting you with a choice that is contrary to the full word, to the open word. Listen, if you look at the ministers that are around this world professing to be Christians, they're preaching a lot of things that the Bible doesn't agree with because they'll take one scripture. And Satan will give you permission by one scripture. He tried to do it with Jesus. He tried to get Jesus to do things by the word. You've got to take the full word when it comes to your choice in your battle. Amen. But the simple fact is this. Today, people are making choices without realizing that it was a choice or without acknowledging that it was their choice. And they have to own the consequences, good or bad. Watch how Eve responds. says, "And the Lord God said unto the woman, what is this that thouast done? What did you do?" And the woman said, "The servant begiled me and I did eat." Eve blades a serpent. She said, "Servant or the serpent?" And she says, "The the serpent begiled me." And that word begile means he deceived me. He seduced me. And the root of this word comes from the idea of false optimism. In other words, you're presented with something that seems really good, that seems better than what you have, but in reality, it is not. Okay? It's a better way. It's a greater way. That's what he's offering there. But what's the problem, church? Cuz I have no doubt in my mind that he did seduce her. He said all the right things. He was a good-looking guy. But the point is to recognize the seduction when it starts. That's what we're talking about in this series is to recognize what's happening before it can ever happen. That is the seduction stops before it can ever turn into action. Before words can ever move into action. Amen. And the first way that the serpent responded when he gave when Eve gave him the word was he contradicted it. He contradicted it. That was blatant. And right then and there, she should have said, "I'm out of here. We are not on the same page. How can two walk together except we agree? You obviously don't believe. I'm out of here. That should have been what happened. But the seduction was in the reasoning that he quickly fed her after he disagreed with the word of God. He said, "I can make you like God. If you do this, you'll be just like God." And she decided to stick around and talk about that contradiction rather than walking away. And pretty soon talking led to action which was disobedience which led to death. You know this happened this this scripture is twice in the Bible. That's how important it is. And it says there's a way that seemth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death. Amen. Eve couldn't see her own fault in this. She blamed it all on the servant. Servant. Serpent. Boy. I'm struggling with the serpent this morning. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Eve couldn't acknowledge, I made a decision. She couldn't see that she had done this of her own free will. She could only point her finger at the serpent church. And too many times today, people are blaming Satan for their own choices. People are blaming Satan for their own consequences and results. Amen. Well, Eve didn't eat an actual fruit. We know that. But let's pretend for a second that she did. Eve did not have the serpent standing there and he took her hand and he put it on the tree and he pulled the apple off and he put it here and he forced her mouth open. He shoved the apple in and then he pushed her jaw up and down and made her eat it. Again, we know that's not what happened. But let's pretend it does for a minute. He didn't make her do that. He offered her the opportunity. And the scripture says she took, she saw, [snorts] she perceived, she acted. The action is all hers. It's not the serpents to blame. Amen. We have to own our decisions and we have to own the results. What I find so often is people blaming bad results on supposed good decisions. And that can't be true. It violates the law of the harvest that's in scripture. You can't plant good seed and get bad crops. You can't do it. If you plant good seed, you'll get good crops. you plant bad seed, you'll get bad crops. Amen. That doesn't mean that every good decision you make feels good. That doesn't mean that every good decision you make feels or or produces good things on this earth. By no means is that the case. But what it means is that a wordbased decision produces word results. Look at the decisions that the disciples had to make. Because when you stand for the word, you're going to face persecution, misunderstanding, ignorance, shame, slander, separation, loss of relationship, loss of opportunity. Church, you can lose your job. You can limit your career. You can lose your career. You can be limited in this life by living by the word. Absolutely you can. Absolutely you can. Amen. But if the fruit of the word is produced in your life, in the long run, you're better off than anything Satan would have offered. Okay? What will happen when you make a word-based decision is you'll produce the fruit of the spirit. You'll reflect Christ in a greater way and you'll be closer to God. A word-based decision always takes you closer to God. Always. Too many people are trying to see how close can I get to the world and still serve God. No, no, no. We're supposed to be as tight to him as possible. Hold close to him. Amen. Listen, we look around this church. We're not rich. We don't have big lifestyles. We don't all drive big brand new vehicles. We don't all have big big houses. It's tough, isn't it, Brother Matt? Sometimes most of us are single- inome homes because we've got our wives staying at home to raise the kids and teach the kids and all these things. It's hard. It wears on us. We pay a price by living by the word. Absolutely we do. But what do we have out of that, brothers and sisters? We have unshakable families. We have wonderful marriages. We have a way to enjoy life by the simpler things. And we don't need everything that this world has. We don't need alcohol to have a good time. We don't need drugs. We don't need sensuality. We don't need rock and roll. We don't need to dance and grind on each other to have a good time. And when we have a good time, we can remember it. Praise the Lord. I remember when I was in high school and you ask people, "How'd your week weekend go?" or university. I don't know. We just got smashed. It was a great time. What did you do? I don't know. It was just great. How you feeling today? Not great. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; See, because it's a long game with Christ. It's a long game. What we sacrifice today produces a big result down the road. Amen. See, God plays the long game, too. Satan's patient, but when it comes to his offering, his offering is almost instant. Satan's always offering instant gratification. He's offering shortcuts. Amen. So his he's all about the instant rewards and God is about the eternal rewards. Right? That's one way to judge a decision is is it immediate or is it long-term? Because if it's immediate, it will almost always almost always now be Satan offering it because God is about sewing and harvesting. Satan's about giving you what you did not sow. That's the way that he works. Amen. Instant rewards are rarely of God. Satan's desperately trying to keep you from looking down the road and get you to look right here and now. And what God's trying to do is desperately trying to get you look down the road so you can see what's of greatest value. Satan's trying to get you to look right here. What feels good? What would be good today? What would make life more enjoyable? What would make life easier? What is it that I really, really, really want? Can I have it today? and in other but God's there trying to say can you look at what I have for you because when you get it my way you'll have character to handle it but if you do it Satan's way you'll have no character and it won't last and there'll be a price to pay down the road. Amen. So God's trying to get you to look further down the road to see the impact of it. And Satan's saying look what I can give you today. And God's saying look what I can give you forever. Church, if you could have a million dollars today or a billion dollars forever, what would you take? Let me say this. Too often our decision, the million dollars today because it's Satan. Satan's good at what he does. We pick those things that are so immediate. Amen. You don't see the long-term benefit from having daily devotions in one week. That's like saying, "I'm going to have a great marriage based on one week of close relationship." No, it takes years to develop a close relationship with God. Amen. But you'll absolutely see the benefit of picking up your phone for 30 minutes and doom scrolling. What's the benefit? Mindless entertainment. But what's going to happen when you put that phone down? You'll forget everything you looked at. It has no lasting or eternal value except that you filled your mind to take up space of things that should have been filled with God. Come on right in the moment. How many people [clears throat] don't raise your hands? How many people stay up on their phone or their laptop or their iPad or whatever you have, your tablet, longer than you should, so you go to bed late and then get up the next morning and say, "I'm really glad I stayed up and did that." How many have done that? How many say that was that was a wonderful use of my time. I'm really glad I did that. None of us, right? But what did Satan offer in the moment? He said, "Let's have some fun before we go to bed. Let's entertain ourselves before bed. Let's relax before we go to bed." You know what we really need to do, church? We need to go to bed. That's what will relax us is go to bed. But he presents us with an opportunity. And I'll tell you this, it never takes you anywhere good. I speak by experience. Never takes you anywhere good. Total waste of your time. If you would take that 30 minutes, don't lay down, sit up, pray, read your Bible, listen to a sermon, talk to your spouse, god forbid, you'll be better off. It'll have eternal value. It'll have lasting value. But see, remember what Satan does. He seduces. Amen. I don't want to get too explicit today, but remember what a sed what a seduction is. A seduction is temporary pleasure followed by lasting regret. That's my words. Temporary pleasure followed by lasting regret. A seduction seems to be good. It seems to have benefits, but really there's only one person that walks away after a seduction happy, and it's never you. In the moment, you might feel real happy, but when it's all said and done, only one walks away happy because they got what they really wanted. And you didn't get what you wanted because it was a seduction. It was a lie from the beginning so the other person could get what they really wanted. He says, "Satan tries to show you something better, an easier way, a more sensible plan. But there's no more sensible plan than that God laid down at the beginning, his word." He says, "Hold that word. Get a grip on it. Let it get a grip on you and stay there with it." That's the thing. The battle raged when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning. She in her soul reasoned and her eyes were sight. Now catch what he's saying there. He's saying she re because she reasoned now her natural senses are confirming what she reasoned. Her natural eyes confirmed a lie. Okay? Before this, when she saw this, she was repulsed by it because the word said, "Don't do it. It'll cause you death. It'll cause you bad things." And so, before this time, before reasoning, before seduction, when she saw the fruit of the tree, it repulsed her. She turned her eyes away. She didn't dwell on it. But now that reasoning has crept in, her five senses go to work and her eyes confirm what her mind and soul have reasoned, which is this is good. See how Satan uses your five senses? He says, "She saw the serpent. He was beautiful, handsome, far better than her own husband. He was the most subtle of all the beasts of the field. He was probably a fairer man than her husband. He looked like a great masculine beast standing there. How great he was. And he was trying to tell her what a great thing it was. And the first thing she did, she opened up what? Her mind. And when she did, human reasonings caught it. Why wouldn't that be a thrill, church? Who got the great thrill that day? It was good for a moment. The serpent got a thrill. Eve got a thrill. Adam got a thrill. But after the thrill wore off, who still had a thrill? Only the serpent. Adam and Eve are the ones that are now now with fear, with doubt, with guilt, with self-loathing, hiding from the presence of God. Only one person gets the thrill in the seduction that lasts, and that's the one that got what they wanted. And I'll tell you this, in a seduction, the believer never gets the thrill for long. It never works out that way. They were the ones paying the price and the serpent just went on being a beast because that's what beasts do. He was just in it for himself. The thrill didn't last that long. And that's the way it works with the believer. When Satan's seduction's over, the thrill wears off and all you're left with is brokenness, guilt, and regret. I speak by experience, church. We've all been fooled. We've all been fooled. and all you're left with is brokenness. And usually what happens is you don't want to come back to God and and confess it. And we lose that relationship. Amen. But we say, "Well, brother John, that was Eve. That was a different day, different situation, different test. She failed. That's that. But we're living in a different day." That's not how he does it with me. That's exactly how he does it with us. He does it exactly the way that he did it with her. Listen to what Paul said now. And he's going to say this to the Corinthian church. Second Corinthians, the church that is the written epistle seen and read of all men, the living proof of his gospel. Here's what he says to that church. This is an overcoming church. Now, he says, "For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear, I'm concerned, I worry, lest by any means as a serpent beguiled, as a serpent seduced Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. So as he did it with Eve, so he'll do it with you. Same process, same argument, same attack, same approach, same presentation. No difference. The way he does it is the same every time. It's a seduction. It's subtle. It's not obvious. Amen. And we're going to close shortly, but I want to point a few things here before we we close for this afternoon. His approach is always seduction. It's to make what is contrary to the word appeal to your flesh, appeal to your mind, appeal to your human nature. Amen. It's shortterm gain for long-term pain. Okay? Seduction is short-term gain for long-term pain. But they never tell you about the pain part. Okay? Satan's approach is s his is seduction is through our minds. That's where it starts. Amen. There's gateways he uses. We'll get into that as we go through this series. Five outer senses, five inner senses. But the ultimate battle is in our minds. And that's means that it's a choice every day. A mind is just choices. That's what's in our mind is choices day by day. We might not want to admit it, but that battle is conscious. It's conscious. It should be conscious. So many times we think we're just going through our days, church. We're not. We're in a battle. And every choice matters. Every choice matters. It's real. It's going on constantly. And our actions, the way we live, the way we talk, the way we respond is merely a result of who won the battle in our mind for that moment. Okay. But I like how he finishes. He says that it should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. Christ the word is simple. It is straightforward. That word simplicity means single-mindedness, bountifulness, simpleness, and catch this. Liberality. There's a freedom in the spirit. There's a freedom in the word. Church, when you look at what God has offered us, you talk about liberality. There's nothing that he withholds from us that is good for us. That's the liberality of the word of God. Amen. It's But it it points this idea of simplicity, the the root of it is that it's a a piece of cloth that isn't folded up. Now, if you've ever seen something, take a garment, take a shirt, uh take a a shawl or something like that. You wrap it up, you can't see what's all in it. You could have a shirt that it's folded up and it looks white and plain on the outside, but when you open it up, it's got some nasty thing written on the front of it. The point here is that everything God offers you is open and plain. His promises are clear. His path is clear. God shows you upfront. He shows you the pain and he shows you the reward. It's all there. God is not trying to hide it from us. More to the point, God's trying to reveal it to us. Satan's the one that's trying to hide it. Amen. So, Satan's try God's trying to reveal his goodness, not just to us, but in us. And Satan's trying to hide his badness from us, but present it as if it's something good. Christ is simple. Satan is subtle. Satan's trying to hide. God's trying to reveal. So, let me say it this way. Overcoming comes through the mind. Now, the real battle's won in the soul. Because if your soul is sealed by the Holy Ghost, you've already won. But you can live in failure in this life if that doesn't translate into your mind. Okay, we have to make a choice. It starts in the soul, but it activates in the mind. Amen. That choice is your part and it's my part. That's the part that we play. We choose the word or we choose seduction. And I'm closing. But I've never been seduced by a woman outside of marriage. [snorts] Now, my wife laughs at me because she says, "You're clueless about what women are trying to do sometimes. I remember I was on the bus one time. I think I've told the story and I always I'd read read a book a day in university pretty much. And I get on the bus and I was reading a book and this girl taps me on the shoulder. She says, 'Hey, didn't I see you on George Street last night? This was a Friday, Thursday night's a big drinking night. George Street's the bar where all the bars are if you don't know it in [snorts] St. John's. Didn't I see you on George Street last night? I look, no. She said, I'm sure I saw you. Weren't you down on George Street last night? I said, no, I don't drink. And I went back to my book and looked down. I told my wife cuz we were dating at the time. She said, "John, she was hitting on you. She's trying to strike a conversation." I said, "I okay, whatever." I didn't notice. But I'll tell you this, when I gave my heart to the Lord, the door to a woman's seduction closed because I already had somebody that I was interested in. But more to the point, I'm not interested in somebody that can't be my wife. So if she ain't a believer, there's no point in having anything more than a basic conversation that you would with anybody being polite. But there's no friendship. There's no closeness. There's no opportunity for seduction. But I've been seduced many other ways, church. I've been seduced many other ways. I've been offered multiple times opportunities to run companies. In Texas, when I was first offered this opportunity, they offered me they had a brand new acquisition and my boss called me up and it this was on a Friday afternoon. He called me up. He says, "Do not leave work. I'm on my way back from Houston. I need to talk to you about an opportunity and it can't wait." So, I stayed and I stuck around and he comes up and he comes into my office and he's just glowing. He's happy for me. He's he's got good news. He sits down. He says, "Hey, we just bought such and such a company down in Houston." And I talked with with Mark, who's the VP of our division. He said, I talked with Mark, Mark, and I think you're the one to run it. Multi-million dollar company. He says, "You, if you're willing to move to Houston, we'll let you take over. It'll be your baby. We want you to grow it. We want you to expand it." Now, church, it was flattering. So flattering to be considered flattering to be considered capable. There are lots of people I would have leaprogged multiple people in my organization to take that role. I had won I was the first one to win an employee of the year at that at that at that company when they did that award. I'd done so well there. God had blessed me so much. And you know what the temptation was? God's blessing me again. God's giving me a great promotion. Okay, church. We're talking about seductions now. Okay, keep this in your mind as we close. Now, let me tell you, as soon as he said that, remember we're receptors of thoughts. You know, the first thing that came to my mind, I can finally buy that Porsche 911 I always wanted. Second thing, I can get a much nicer house than this broken down piece we've got. Three, I can live a better lifestyle. I can make more money. I can get stock options. I'll get a bonus every year. I will be the youngest executive in company history. And this was a company that was been around for over a hundred years. Church, you talk about seducing. I was making $82,000 a year. You don't want to know what I could have made. Massive multi-billion dollar company. Okay, talk about seduction. But here's the thing. I didn't go home and consider it. I didn't go home and talk to my wife about it. I didn't go home and pray about it. You know what I did right then and there? I said, "I'm sorry. I'm not interested. And by the way, I'm resigning and I'm moving back to Canada." You know why? Because if I moved to Houston, it was too far away to make church on Wednesday night. And it was a long drive for Sundays. So, you know what happens when it's a long drive, right? You make excuses. You choose excuses. I was going to miss every Wednesday night service. I was one of two deacons, so I wasn't going to be at my post of duty half the time. Now, church, let me say this. Your post of duty is here regardless of whether you have a position. But I wasn't going to make Wednesday nights. Sundays were going to be a long haul. There's no fellowship there. No other church there at the time. We would have been completely isolated from believers day in and day out. We'd miss half the church services and probably more at times. Why did I turn it down, church? Because I kept the word in front of me. And the word says, "Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together, and all the more as you see the day approaching." You know what that means, church? Wednesdays aren't optional. For me, that's the way I took it. There was an absolute that was secured in my heart. I go to church when the church doors open. That is my place of duty is to be in church when the doors open. That meant that job was never an option. So, you know what, church? When did the seduction stop? Immediately. And my boss looked at me. He couldn't believe it. He had driven in a and he was a fast driver, too. He had driven up in a hurry to catch me so as not to intrude into my weekend to give me this wonderful news. And I not only turned him down, but I resigned and moved to Canada a month or two later because that's where God had told us to go. And what did Satan do? He seduced me with an offer to stay. But here's the thing, church. What was the bait? The bait was, I can give you the car you want. I can give you the house you deserve. I can give you a company that you can attach your success to. Leverage it to be bigger and better. Maybe I could have been CEO of Lufkin Industries if I stayed there. Multi-billion dollar company. You know what I used to do? I used to track the straight the the stock trades of all the executives. These guys every year cashing in a million dollars in stock, million dollars in stock, million dollars in stock, $10 million in stock. You talk about a seduction, but the thing is this, what matters? What do you value? What do you value? That's what comes out when you make those decisions. And Satan said, you can have a great career. You can make lots of money. You won't have to struggle in life. You can have lots of fun. You can have the vehicle vehicles you always wanted. But the reality was you will sacrifice your family for it. But he didn't say that. He never says that because you never tell the result of a seduction beforehand. Paul looks at our minds, points to our minds. And I want to close with this thought. The battle we face is not physical. The battle we face is spiritual. The battle we face did not start here. It started up there. And when God defeated Satan and kicked him out, he came down here. And now the battle's for us. So that's what we're fighting every day. Amen. It's a battle for our mind, seeking control of our body, seeking control of our souls. We're not fighting a battle through our five senses. We're not fighting fighting a battle through our inner five senses. Amen. We're not swinging swords. We're not shooting guns. We're not dropping bombs. We're not flying planes. That would make it simpler. Hard but simple. But this is a daybyday, momentby-moment battle and there's no relief. There's no relief. Church, you can be reading your Bible and Satan will come in and try and do something. Absolutely. When When do the children always want to fight? When you're having devotions, when you're studying for service, when does the dog always want to bark? When nobody's home to shut him up, and you have to get out from your office where you're studying faithfully for service and run up and tell them to shut up. That's the way he works. He's always working. He's always trying to frustrate. He's always trying to fill. He's always trying to overwhelm. He's always trying to distract. And it's up here that he starts it. And what happens is we act on it and we blame our actions on that. But we lost the battle here. We didn't recognize we were in a battle and therefore we lost it. You can't win a battle you don't know you're fighting. You can't do that. Amen. This is not a natural war. It's a supernatural war. I There's a song that I heard a long time ago and and there's one line that struck me and it said, "Every choice is an act of war." Every choice is an act of war. And it is because you're either supporting him or you're supporting him. That's it. Remember that Indian that got saved and he said, you know, he asked him, "How you doing?" He says, "Someday's good, some days not so good." He says, "What makes the difference?" He says, "I have two dogs fighting inside me. A black one and a white one." He says, "They're white. They're fighting every day. One's good, one's bad." He says, "Which one wins?" He says, "The one I feed the most." That's the way it is. Every choice is an act of war. Every choice feeds either Satan's power in your life, influence, or God's. And it's very simple. It's very simple. Amen. What's Satan's trick? seduce to try and make us think he has more for us than God does. Better, more, more immediate, easier to try and get today what was meant for tomorrow. That's what he offered Jesus. He said, "Bow down, worship me. I'll give you all the kingdoms. You don't have to die for them. I'll give them to you." We're going to get through this. You'll see when Jesus did that, he he he fought all three of the lusts that Paul talks about and he overcame all of them. Amen. To try. What is Satan's seduction, church? to try and make it about us rather than about God. Make it about us rather than about the word. To make us feel good rather than make the word have the preeminence in our life. Amen. Let's stand together if we would. [snorts] What's our response? Anybody else in a battle? Amen. Brother Grant's got two hands up. We're in a battle. We're in a battle. I I had a long day yesterday. I got up and because it's a new series, I studied and I studied and I studied. I came up, I ate supper, we got ready and we came in for a prayer meeting. Like, it was a long, long day. And at the end of it, you just think, I'm wore out. I'm wore out. But you know what? I came into church this morning and everybody started singing. It's like, I'm not so tired anymore. Praise the Lord. This is good. It's good to be here. It's good to be here. What is our response, church? It's the word. It's faith in the word. It is written. It is written. It is written. And then we walk away. We walk away. Leave him standing. You know the most frustrating thing? I say this as a person that likes to win arguments. When somebody refuses to argue. When someone refuses to let me beat them up. Because Satan's law is reason. He's better at reasoning than you and I. Our only weapon. Our only weapon. it is written. That's it. And then we walk away because he can take it or leave it. The point is, I've taken it and I'm staying with the word. That's our response. That's how you respond to a seduction. It is written and you walk away. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly [snorts] Father, Lord, how thankful I am this morning. Lord, I'm thankful for your word. I'm thankful for your presence, your anointing. Lord, I'm thankful for the direction you've given, heavenly father. Lord, I'm just asking as we start another series, Lord, trusting this is your leadership, Lord, that you will use it to sharpen our discernment, Lord, with the intent that we will overcome, Lord, that we'll recognize our position. We'll recognize every trick of Satan, Lord, and we'll recognize your personal presence in our lives is what gives us overcoming power, Lord. I pray you help us stay with your word, Lord. Let it be in our mind. Let it be on our lips, Lord. May we dwell on it. May we meditate on it day by day, heavenly father. Lord, may we feed, Lord, the power of God that is within us. We pray, Lord, your spirit feeds on your word. We know that, Lord. I pray you help us to feed on the right things, Lord. Let us recognize we're in a battle every single moment of every single day, Lord. Help us to make those right choices, Lord. Let us see things for what they are, Lord. And having done all to stand, Lord, let us stand, Lord, so you can pour in more of your spirit, Lord. Your word says resist the devil and he will flee from you. Lord, let us push back. Lord, let us hold fast to what you've given us. I pray, Lord, I pray you help us to choose a life rather than a lifestyle. Lord, that rich young ruler came and he wanted eternal life, but he turned it down because he wanted a lifestyle that pleased himself. Lord, I pray you help us to see, Lord, we're not here for lifestyle. We're here for eternal life. Lord, help us to choose the things that matter eternally. Lord, may we not sacrifice ourselves, our children, our families, Lord, on the altar of lifestyle. Lord, I pray you help us to make the right decision, Lord, to be in fellowship with you constantly. Grant us grace, Lord. Give us strength day by day, Lord. It is your strength that's going to get us through, Lord, and we're trusting in you. Bless your people now. We pray, Lord God, in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Lord, I give you my heart. This is my desire. 10:19. This is my desire to honor you. Lord, [singing] with all my heart I worship you. [music] And all I have within [singing] me, [music] I give you praise. [music] All that I adore, [music] it is [singing] in you. So Lord, [singing] I give you my heart. [music] I give you my soul.

Hey Jesus, [music and singing] draw me close [music] closer Lord to you. [music] Let the world around me fade away. [music] Jesus, [singing and music] draw me close, closer, Lord, [music] to you, for I desire [music] to worship and obey. One more time.

[music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus [singing] draw me close [music] closer Lord to [singing] you [music] for I desire [music] to worship and [singing] obey. Amen. Before we close, I got a testimony here from Sister Kim. She said, "Thank you for praying for my sister last night at the prayer meeting. She went into the ER today for an X-ray and her foot is not broken, just badly bruised." Amen. So, we're thankful for that. Amen. Praise the Lord. We're going to we're going to sing um Holy Spirit rain down 7:17. Amen. Remember all the prayer requests. I don't always hear them in the office. so well. But whatever's been brought, amen, remember the saints in Jamaica especially. Um, amen, that the Lord would just be with them. Remember Sister Cassandra, remember the services coming up. Amen. Amen. We're just looking for God to move in a special way. Amen. Let's remember these things. I'm going to going to ask Brother Kingsley to close in prayer if we would after we sing this a few times. Holy Spirit, rain down. Won't you [singing and music] rain down? Oh, [music] comforter and pray. How we need [music] your touch again. [singing] Holy [music] Spirit rain down. [music] Rain down.

Um and I also want to take the opportunity to announce that um sister Mel and I are expecting another baby soon. So just keep us in prayer. Uh those who have babies understand why I would ask for prayer. [laughter] So let us pray. Our heavenly father, we thank you for the greatness of your word. We thank you for washing us clean with your word today. Listening to that word just purifies our hearts and bless our soul. It gives us more than enough reassurance that you are God and you're with us all the way. You've shown us times and times and number again that clinging on to you, holding on to you is the only sure path to our redemption. We thank you for using a pastor to teach us more in depth, bringing [music] out more information, more things that we ought to know and hold on to. showing us a clearer path to worshiping you true, staying closer to the word, staying closer to you, oh Lord, and keeping your word true in our hearts. We thank you for the testimonies that fill this place. Every week there's something to testify about. We thank you for the testimonies, Sister Kimberly. We thank you, Lord, for you are watching over those in Jamaica. You are touching the hearts of many that are here today. We everyone has a desire, have their challenges and their struggles. But thank you oh Lord for you have conquered already. You said you have already overcame the devil. You have overcome for us. We do not need to fight another battle. We just have to hold on to your word and we are victorious as you have made us from the very beginning. We ask that this word continue to resonate in our hearts all week long day in day out morning to night.
