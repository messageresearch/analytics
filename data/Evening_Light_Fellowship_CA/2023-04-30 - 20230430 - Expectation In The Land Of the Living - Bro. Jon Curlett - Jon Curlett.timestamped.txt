[35:51] and amen
[35:53] amen God bless you
[35:55] 'll turn the scriptures to Psalm 27
[35:58] and then certainly wants to be in prayer
[36:00] for the special meetings coming up next
[36:02] week it's been a long time and I'm
[36:04] certainly an expectation for those
[36:05] things so remember brother Dwayne and
[36:07] they'll be coming and having a bit of an
[36:09] anniversary time and then he's going to
[36:11] be preaching right after that so we want
[36:13] to remember him and his wife sister
[36:14] Connie Rhonda remember Sister Betty of
[36:17] course as well she's going to be
[36:18] starting her radiation treatments this
[36:20] week and then her surgery has been moved
[36:22] up to May 11th so we we definitely want
[36:25] to remember her in prayer over the
[36:26] coming days that the Lord would just
[36:28] settle her heart and settle her her soul
[36:30] and he would heal her body amen that's
[36:32] what we're looking for
[36:33] amen God bless you it's good to see
[36:35] brother and sister cater here this
[36:36] morning amen good to have each one
[36:39] that's with us
[36:40] Psalm 27 and verse 13 says I had fainted
[36:43] unless I have believed to see the
[36:45] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[36:48] living
[36:48] wait on the Lord
[36:50] be of good courage and he shall
[36:52] strengthen thine heart wait I say
[36:55] on the Lord amen God bless you you can
[36:58] have your seats this morning
[37:00] amen I had read this scripture I believe
[37:02] in the in the last service and and I've
[37:04] had
[37:05] I've had this on my heart for quite some
[37:07] time and I wasn't sure where I was going
[37:09] to kind of fit it or when it would be
[37:11] ministered and I thought perhaps I just
[37:13] tied into Redemption and kind of stick
[37:15] with our our series that we've been
[37:17] doing on but just as I've been
[37:19] going through this week and dealing with
[37:21] some things and it's been a bit of a
[37:23] rough week for me and and I was just
[37:24] asking the Lord for kind of a word to
[37:26] help me in a word to help the church and
[37:28] and and so this is this is what he's
[37:30] laid on my heart this morning so so it's
[37:33] it's for all of us I believe this
[37:34] morning I want to preach on this and
[37:36] it's expectation in the land of the
[37:38] living amen David's words in Psalm 27
[37:42] are are used to preach that message the
[37:44] Rapture if you know this was brother
[37:45] branham's scripture for when he preached
[37:47] the Rapture and and we tend to go there
[37:49] because we've been given a rapturing
[37:51] message and that's where we focus on it
[37:52] but but David wasn't looking for a
[37:54] rapture that was not for David's day and
[37:57] that's what not what David was speaking
[37:59] about we know he did it and he does
[38:00] these things prophetically and he's
[38:02] under inspiration to do it but there's
[38:03] an inspiration for for where he was at
[38:06] that day and there's an inspiration for
[38:08] where we're at today amen and we can
[38:10] take inspiration for his situation for
[38:12] our situation and then take it all the
[38:14] way but the brother Branham took it to
[38:16] the Rapture but David wasn't looking for
[38:18] a Rapture that day David was looking for
[38:20] God to be real that day in his situation
[38:23] and in his life amen David was dealing
[38:25] with things in his everyday life and
[38:27] that's what psalms 27 was about for
[38:29] David was David was seeking a God that
[38:31] was going to deliver him and preserve
[38:33] him and do all of these different things
[38:35] and David was looking for God to be real
[38:37] to him that day
[38:39] David wasn't just looking for a god of
[38:41] tomorrow and he wasn't just dwelling on
[38:42] a god of yesterday but he was looking
[38:44] for a God that was with him today
[38:46] present in his need present in his trial
[38:48] present in his battle amen
[38:51] listen David needed peace that day
[38:54] David needed protection that day because
[38:56] people were trying to kill him people
[38:58] were seeking his life people were trying
[39:00] to take what he had in that day amen and
[39:02] David didn't need peace for the sunny
[39:04] days David needed peace for the storm
[39:06] that he was in and that's what we
[39:08] sometimes forget is is we can put God
[39:09] for the always in the forward and always
[39:12] in the future and not recognize that he
[39:14] has promised to be here with us in the
[39:16] midst of our trial in the midst of our
[39:17] everyday lives and the situations we're
[39:19] going through and the difficulties we
[39:21] face and and in in the persecution even
[39:23] that we face he's promised to be here in
[39:26] the midst of it and David was saying
[39:27] Lord I need you right now
[39:29] Lord I need you in my situation right
[39:31] now but I want you to look at how David
[39:33] starts Psalms 27 and we'll read a
[39:36] portion of it this morning
[39:38] but he said because if you can start the
[39:41] way David starts then you'll finish the
[39:42] way David finished can I put it that way
[39:44] amen if you can catch the inspiration if
[39:47] you can catch the drive of David's life
[39:49] in this moment then you're going to get
[39:51] the same results that David did and
[39:53] David says the Lord is my light and my
[39:55] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[39:58] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[40:01] be afraid now it's easy to say he's the
[40:03] Lord of your light and he's the Lord of
[40:05] your salvation but then David says he's
[40:07] the strength of my life not just the
[40:10] strength of my trouble not just the
[40:11] strength of my battle but he says he is
[40:13] the Lord of my life and he's what keeps
[40:15] me going
[40:16] he's got to be Lord he can't just be
[40:19] savior he's got to be Lord he's got to
[40:21] be in the middle of everything he's got
[40:23] to be welcome in every room of your life
[40:25] and when he's welcome in every room then
[40:27] he is Lord he's not just savior but he's
[40:30] working in the midst of it David knew
[40:32] who kept him alive David knew who
[40:34] allowed him to wake up in the morning
[40:36] and go to bed in the evening David knew
[40:38] who had anointed him David knew who was
[40:40] leading him David knew who was guiding
[40:42] him David knew who was protecting him
[40:43] and he said it is the Lord
[40:46] not just God but he said the Lord he is
[40:48] in my life and he is controlling my life
[40:50] and these different things
[40:52] I want to ask you who is your light
[40:55] who is your salvation
[40:58] who is your strength this morning
[41:00] because is it you every day and then
[41:02] when the battle comes up it becomes the
[41:04] Lord or is it the Lord all day every day
[41:07] in every situation in every aspect in
[41:10] everything you come up to is he Lord
[41:13] or is he just the god of the time when
[41:15] you need him because of his only Lord
[41:17] some of the times he's not Lord at all
[41:20] he's got to be in every aspect of Our
[41:21] Lives amen where do you go you say I he
[41:25] is my Lord Brother brother John if he's
[41:27] your lord then where do you go when
[41:29] you're maxed out do you go to him or do
[41:33] you go to something else
[41:35] do you go to some other thing do you go
[41:38] to entertainment do you go to old
[41:40] relationships do you go to Old Friends
[41:41] do you go to the world and the things of
[41:43] the world or do you go to your Lord
[41:45] because he's been with you all along and
[41:46] say I need you now Lord I need you now
[41:49] Lord
[41:51] where do you go and it seems like you're
[41:52] surrounded and you can't get a break
[41:55] is he with you in that moment because
[41:57] he's been with you all along or do you
[41:59] have to go seek him
[42:00] because he's not a part of your life
[42:02] every single day
[42:04] David would say in Psalm 61 he would say
[42:06] Hear My Cry Oh God attend unto my prayer
[42:09] from the end of the Earth will I cry
[42:12] unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed
[42:14] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[42:17] I for thou Hast
[42:22] David speaking from experience here he's
[42:24] not saying I believe you will be or I
[42:27] believe that you could be but he says
[42:28] you have been
[42:30] you have been a shelter for me you've
[42:32] been a strong tower from the enemy and
[42:35] he says I will abide in thy Tabernacle
[42:38] forever I will trust in the covert of
[42:40] thy wings
[42:41] what is the Tabernacle it's the dwelling
[42:44] place of God it's where God has put his
[42:46] name it is his word
[42:48] but not just his word this way but it's
[42:51] got to be his word this way as well it's
[42:53] his word and his flesh amen it's the
[42:55] word in you and I that is the Tabernacle
[42:58] of God that's when he's your lord is
[42:59] when he is tabernacled inside of you
[43:02] amen David want to be where God was
[43:06] not just where the word was in terms of
[43:08] of the scripture or these things but he
[43:10] wanted to go to the person of his
[43:13] protection the person of his strength
[43:15] the person of his life David wanted
[43:18] Above All Else relationship
[43:20] he wanted to be with God and he said
[43:23] that's where I'm going I want to be in
[43:25] your Tabernacle forever I want to be
[43:28] where you are
[43:29] and that was his Guiding Light his
[43:31] guiding principle
[43:33] when you're overwhelmed where do you go
[43:36] do you know that he has been a shelter
[43:38] and therefore he will be a shelter
[43:40] or is it just an experiment you're
[43:42] trying for the first time or that you
[43:44] run to occasionally when things get so
[43:46] bad that you don't think you can go
[43:47] anywhere else David said there's there's
[43:49] a place that's higher than me there's a
[43:52] place that's stronger than me there's a
[43:53] place that's more deeply founded than I
[43:55] am there's a place where I can go and I
[43:57] can rest and it doesn't move
[44:00] it doesn't move come hell or high water
[44:02] come storm or rain or wind whether it's
[44:05] an enemy whether it's situations
[44:07] whatever it might be when I go to that
[44:09] place I know I'm safe
[44:11] he said he hides me in the cleft of The
[44:13] Rock
[44:14] amen
[44:15] is that what he is to you amen is he a
[44:18] rock and a weary land is he a water is
[44:21] he a source of water in a dry land
[44:23] is he a foundation in the storm amen is
[44:26] he peace when all around you is Raging
[44:28] that's what David said he was David knew
[44:31] what it was like to be in trials and
[44:33] battles and he knew that there was a
[44:35] place of peace and rest in all of those
[44:37] situations amen I think David knew
[44:39] better than anyone else in the scripture
[44:41] what it meant to be run around run
[44:43] ragged we would say today
[44:45] for 15 years David was run ragged
[44:49] through no Faults of his own
[44:51] through no fault of his own
[44:53] and then when he ever did run into an
[44:55] enemy he had to what
[44:57] be able to not kill him because Saul was
[45:00] his enemy not of David's choosing but if
[45:02] Saul's choosing but every time Saul came
[45:04] after him all David could do is try and
[45:06] disengage and keep from hurting that man
[45:08] talk about a tricky task talk about a
[45:11] tricky task when you're trying not to
[45:13] hurt somebody that's intent on
[45:14] destroying you
[45:15] that was David's life for 15 years
[45:18] trying not to hurt what he considered to
[45:20] be God's anointed
[45:22] what a place but watch how David talks
[45:25] I'm trying to encourage you this morning
[45:26] I want you to see the pattern of a
[45:28] person that has rest and peace and also
[45:31] the overcomer
[45:32] so if we look back in Psalms 27 he said
[45:35] when the wicked even mine enemies in my
[45:37] phone Came Upon me to eat my flesh so
[45:40] he's pointing to his past
[45:42] David has a testimony
[45:45] David has a testimony that people tried
[45:47] to do bad stuff to him he says they
[45:49] tried to eat up my flesh this isn't just
[45:51] an enemy that's content on killing you
[45:52] but they want to destroy and remove
[45:54] every evidence that you were ever there
[45:56] in the first place
[45:58] as if out in the in in the wilderness
[46:00] you know maybe a bear would kill you and
[46:02] then eat you completely and they don't
[46:03] know what happened to you he says that's
[46:04] the kind of enemies that came upon me
[46:07] they tried to remove me from this Earth
[46:10] but I want you to see
[46:12] because listen we're in a fight
[46:16] it's not wrong to say you've got enemies
[46:18] it's not wrong to say that you've got
[46:21] battles it's not wrong to say I'm in a
[46:23] struggle for my health I'm in a struggle
[46:24] for my marriage I'm in a struggle for my
[46:26] finances I'm in a struggle for my kids
[46:29] I'm in a struggle for a relationship I'm
[46:31] in a struggle inwardly and nobody knows
[46:34] about it it's okay to say you've got
[46:35] enemies but listen to what David said he
[46:38] said they stumbled and fell
[46:40] I did just fine
[46:43] I made it through
[46:45] not because of me because he's pointing
[46:47] to a rock he's pointing to a place of
[46:50] rest
[46:51] now he comes to verse three because he's
[46:52] letting his past shape his future in
[46:55] terms of his faith in God he says though
[46:57] and hosts should encamp against me
[46:59] so he says if they come
[47:03] I'm not going to worry about it
[47:05] God God help me in the past God's going
[47:07] to help me in the future
[47:09] amen ever feel like you're surrounded
[47:11] ever feel like there's a battle no
[47:13] matter wherever you face this is your
[47:15] scripture he says though a whole should
[47:17] against me a camp about me though an
[47:19] army surrounds me he says my heart shall
[47:22] not fear
[47:24] the war should rise against me in this
[47:27] will I be confident
[47:29] listen you're going to be in a war if
[47:32] you're not in it today you're going to
[47:33] be in it tomorrow and if not tomorrow
[47:34] the next day we're in a battle and we
[47:37] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[47:38] against principalities and Powers you're
[47:41] in a struggle
[47:42] so guess what if you're not encamped
[47:44] about today you are going to be tomorrow
[47:46] or the next day so this is for you
[47:49] he says in this will I be confident
[47:52] brother Brown says this he says all we
[47:54] say we have faith we have love
[47:56] but if we had love we'd have faith for
[47:59] he says that is perfect love casteth out
[48:01] fear all fear all fear and when fear is
[48:06] gone faith is perfect
[48:09] you're scared he won't keep his word he
[48:12] says but I believe he does he would go
[48:15] on in the message faith is a substance
[48:16] and say now love one another
[48:19] above everything
[48:22] that you do love one another
[48:25] remember they asked Jesus what is the
[48:27] first what are the what is the main
[48:28] command he says love the Lord thy God
[48:29] with all their hearts soul mind and
[48:30] strength and he said the second is just
[48:33] like it love your neighbor as yourself
[48:34] he said by this shall all men know you
[48:36] that you are my disciples if you have
[48:38] loved one for another
[48:40] he says above everything you do love one
[48:42] another and as you love one another
[48:44] you'll love God for God is love
[48:47] listen to this and a man that walks in
[48:51] Love Walks In life
[48:53] and perfect love casteth out all fear
[48:56] then if you can take him at his word and
[48:59] not fear a bit about it he says say Lord
[49:01] I love you
[49:03] I know you're going to answer because
[49:05] you promised me you would and I just
[49:08] know you're going to do it he says see
[49:10] and it takes away all fear what David
[49:13] was saying in this scripture and what
[49:15] this quote is saying is if you're
[49:16] assured of God's love towards you you
[49:19] can go through anything
[49:20] because you know that he is with you and
[49:23] that nothing can touch you and nothing
[49:25] can get into your life and nothing can
[49:27] come against you except he allows it
[49:29] he said if you're assured that God loves
[49:32] you then you can face anything he says
[49:34] in your walk in life then because you
[49:35] are sure of that perfect love husbands
[49:38] let me talk to you this morning
[49:40] if you can love your wife that way
[49:42] she'll trust you the way we ought to
[49:43] trust God but if she ever thinks that
[49:46] your love is selfish in any way it draws
[49:48] her trust away from you and she can't
[49:51] trust your motives and she'll struggle
[49:52] to obey
[49:53] she'll struggle to catch the vision
[49:54] she'll struggle to do those things if
[49:56] she feels your love for yourself is
[49:58] overshadowed by overshadows your love
[50:00] for her then she's not going to trust
[50:02] anything you do
[50:03] so we've got to what we've got to bring
[50:05] her to a place where she believes that
[50:07] our love
[50:08] is for her is our greatest motive
[50:12] is our great is our driving force in the
[50:14] things that we do listen I've had to
[50:15] deal with this myself in my own marriage
[50:17] I've had to I've had to stand up and say
[50:19] you've got to buckle down
[50:21] you've got to be less selfish you've got
[50:23] to step up to the plate and start
[50:25] showing her that you're in it for her
[50:27] and not just for you
[50:29] and that's what David's saying is if you
[50:31] don't believe God's in it for you you're
[50:33] never going to have faith
[50:35] but he's in it for you
[50:37] he is in it for you
[50:39] we've got to know that but he's saying
[50:40] if you can trust his love if you can
[50:42] catch a revelation of his love he says
[50:44] faith will follow right behind it
[50:46] because he says faith and love go
[50:48] together
[50:49] that's what he's looking at amen listen
[50:52] whether you've got a a sickness in your
[50:54] life an addiction you got Financial
[50:55] issues you've got relationship issues
[50:57] you've got to be convinced first of all
[50:59] that Christ loves you and then you'll
[51:02] have faith that he's going to move in
[51:03] the situation amen listen we fight shame
[51:06] we fight shame
[51:08] we've got besetting sins in our lives
[51:10] and we've got little habits that we have
[51:11] and we've got these little things that
[51:13] get into our life and maybe they've been
[51:15] there for a very long time but we what
[51:17] we don't want to bring those things out
[51:19] and we don't even want to bring them to
[51:20] God because we're ashamed but listen
[51:22] while we were yet sinners he loved us
[51:25] God doesn't care about that God doesn't
[51:27] care about that what he cares is will
[51:29] you come back to him will you go talk to
[51:31] him The Prodigal Son remember brother
[51:33] John and he's talked about it he said
[51:34] when he came to himself he came home and
[51:36] where was the father the father saw him
[51:39] a far way off he was looking for him to
[51:42] come back not to judge him but to
[51:44] welcome him to wrap him in the robe and
[51:47] put on a ring of a merited Grace on his
[51:49] hand and welcome him back into the home
[51:52] yes he had lost something yes that son
[51:55] never got the inheritance that he should
[51:57] have gotten he burned it all he'd wasted
[51:59] it but he was back in the family and the
[52:01] father was waiting to welcome him home
[52:03] listen you're in his life you're in his
[52:05] presence you're you're sitting under the
[52:07] preaching of the word you're committed
[52:09] to Christ
[52:10] and yet we hold back due to shame we
[52:12] hold back due to embarrassment about
[52:13] these things go to him
[52:15] that's what he's there to Deliver Us
[52:17] from look at that woman at the well
[52:19] what did he do to the woman at the well
[52:21] you talk about a woman that could be
[52:23] embarrassed
[52:24] and all he did was he turned it around
[52:26] and he gave her the husband that she had
[52:27] really needed all along what was it it
[52:29] was Christ the word and she was changed
[52:31] from that day forward he didn't focus on
[52:33] her shame he focused on I've got
[52:35] something to take away your shame
[52:37] I've got a drink that'll satisfy your
[52:39] thirst for your life amen
[52:42] listen the question that comes up often
[52:44] though is why are you seeking God's help
[52:46] in the first place
[52:48] brother Brown says it matters
[52:50] it matters why you want your healing it
[52:52] matters why you want Deliverance because
[52:54] the human nature is always to avoid pain
[52:56] and so what we want is our pain taken
[52:59] away
[53:00] but we don't want to do what God wants
[53:02] us to do so many times
[53:04] we can't come to God and say take away
[53:06] my pain God's not there to take away
[53:08] your pain he's there to root out the
[53:09] issue and that will resolve the pain we
[53:12] take painkillers don't we
[53:13] you know you go for surgery you you have
[53:16] a toothache you do those things and they
[53:17] give you a painkiller to take you
[53:19] through it but the thing is what you
[53:20] need is you need to get that tooth out
[53:22] you need to have that surgery to deal
[53:24] with it and until that is resolved
[53:26] you'll always have that toothache
[53:28] you can take the painkiller and it will
[53:30] take away the pain for a while but
[53:32] that's going to keep coming back and
[53:33] it's going to keep getting worse and
[53:34] worse until the painkillers won't work
[53:36] anymore and then you're gonna have to
[53:37] get desperate and say Lord I need this
[53:38] tooth taken out I need this issue taken
[53:40] out of my life and that's when he starts
[53:42] to come in is when you say Lord I need
[53:44] the resolution to the problem not just a
[53:47] bandage I need to really get down into
[53:49] my life and have you do these things
[53:51] look at look at David's motive for this
[53:54] he says one thing
[53:57] one thing have I desired of the Lord and
[54:00] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[54:02] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[54:04] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[54:06] and to inquire in his Temple David had
[54:09] one desire one motive one purpose and
[54:12] that was to be in the presence of God
[54:13] and that is his greatest desire and he
[54:15] says everything I'm asking you the Lord
[54:17] is so that I can be in your presence
[54:19] that I can worship you that I can
[54:21] glorify you that was his passion
[54:23] David was in it for God not in it for
[54:25] David listen David's early reputation if
[54:28] you read in the Scripture it says that
[54:29] David he grew in stature and he grew in
[54:32] favor with men and these things and it
[54:33] was because he of his going in and is
[54:35] coming out and what it meant was David
[54:37] could go into the presence of God and he
[54:40] would stay there till he found the will
[54:41] of God for the people and for the Army
[54:43] and then he'd go out and he would do it
[54:45] and God would always bless him in it
[54:47] because he had stayed and he had gotten
[54:49] in God's presence and found God's Will
[54:51] and so David developed a reputation for
[54:53] perfect leadership
[54:56] why because David wasn't in it for David
[54:58] David was in it to deliver the people
[55:00] from their enemies he wasn't in it to
[55:03] develop a reputation he was in it to to
[55:05] to take the Philistines out of the land
[55:07] and these different things so David was
[55:09] used because he would go in and find the
[55:10] will of God and submit to that no matter
[55:12] what it looked like and that's what
[55:14] built David's reputation was not that he
[55:16] was the world's best warrior though he
[55:17] was a great warrior but that he could
[55:19] find the will of God every single time
[55:21] without fail
[55:23] that was David's passion he says one
[55:24] thing of our desire that I may dwell in
[55:27] the house of the Lord
[55:29] but I'm going to jump to our opening
[55:30] scripture just for the sake of time so
[55:32] we can get into this whole thing more
[55:33] deeply and he says I had fainted unless
[55:38] I would have fainted
[55:40] unless I have believed to see the
[55:42] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[55:43] living He says wait on the Lord be of
[55:46] good courage and he shall strengthen
[55:47] thine heart wait I say on the Lord you
[55:50] take it to the Amplified and it says
[55:52] what would have become of me had I not
[55:54] believed
[55:55] you know what
[55:56] God still would have saved David if he
[55:58] hadn't believed God still would have
[56:00] delivered David except unless if he
[56:02] hadn't believed but you know what David
[56:04] would have been miserable the entire
[56:05] time
[56:06] because God's going to take care of his
[56:08] children but you can arrive at the end
[56:10] with a peace that passes all
[56:11] understanding or you can arrive they're
[56:13] stressed out and worn out and fractured
[56:15] and brittle you're going to get there no
[56:17] matter what God's going to get you
[56:19] across the Finish Line it's already a
[56:21] done deal
[56:22] but you can get there in his place or
[56:24] you can get there in your mind and in
[56:26] your failures and in your flaws and in
[56:28] your nature
[56:30] David said if I hadn't believed what
[56:32] would have happened to me
[56:36] he'd have been a wreck
[56:38] it was tough enough as it was but he
[56:40] says had I not believed that I would see
[56:42] the Lord's goodness in the land of the
[56:44] living wait and hope for and expect the
[56:47] Lord be brave and of good courage and
[56:50] let your heart be Stout and enduring yes
[56:53] wait for and hope for and expect the
[56:57] Lord
[56:58] listen David's Faith was that there was
[57:00] a supernatural God there's a
[57:01] supernatural Lord in his life that could
[57:03] help him today
[57:06] and that if it wasn't going to be then
[57:08] it was going to be tomorrow
[57:09] and if it wasn't tomorrow is the next
[57:11] day David had an expectation that God
[57:14] would move in the land of the living
[57:15] that means here that means where we are
[57:17] now that doesn't mean that David was
[57:19] putting everything off till heaven or
[57:21] David was putting everything off to the
[57:22] marriage supper of the Lamb or the
[57:23] resurrection or the Rapture but he said
[57:25] he is a god of the living and he's in my
[57:27] life and I have an expectation that he's
[57:29] going to move where I've asked them to
[57:31] because my motive is to be with him
[57:34] because my desire is to be with him
[57:37] amen he does he says it's it's not that
[57:39] that David says it's not that we won't
[57:41] overcome it doesn't mean we won't see
[57:43] God move he says I'm expecting God to
[57:45] move here and now
[57:47] that he is a God right now he's an
[57:49] on-time God in these things
[57:51] yes I believe in a resurrection yes I
[57:53] believe in a Rapture but I believe he's
[57:55] given us something to have while we're
[57:56] here as well
[57:57] that he's given us something to take us
[57:59] through this day-to-day life amen I
[58:01] don't want to put it off to be on the
[58:02] curtain of time if he's promised it for
[58:04] here let's not be so spiritual that we
[58:07] can't apply the word and expect it in
[58:08] our natural lives today amen listen God
[58:11] hasn't promised us a bed of ease but he
[58:14] has promised us he'd take us through and
[58:17] he give us something that would take us
[58:18] through our lives and we could come
[58:20] through with a sane mind and a sound
[58:22] body and with a healthy relationship
[58:24] with our spouse and with kids that are
[58:26] saved with new generations in our church
[58:29] that we can be fed by the word of God
[58:31] that we can see the supernatural in our
[58:33] midst that's what he has promised us not
[58:36] all for the future but he gave us a word
[58:38] for this journey
[58:39] the word is for here the word is for now
[58:42] amen I was reading in Hebrews 11 and
[58:45] brother Kingsley was talking to me about
[58:46] this brother Kings it was so funny after
[58:48] Thursday I went there and Friday morning
[58:50] my devotions it was Hebrews 11 right
[58:52] where you've been talking to me about so
[58:53] I'm preaching out of Hebrews 11 this
[58:55] morning we know this is the faith
[58:56] chapter but this is what this looks like
[58:59] because we're looking for big things
[59:01] but big things happen in small steps
[59:04] and you've got to be able to see the
[59:06] small steps you've got to be able to
[59:08] recognize the small steps you've got to
[59:09] be able to say that's God
[59:12] even though it's not the full picture
[59:14] you can see that's God moving and I want
[59:17] you to us to see what this looks like
[59:18] because it's so small so many times
[59:22] listen it says by faith
[59:24] faith is what we need
[59:27] we've got to believe we've got to have a
[59:29] revelation that what we are resting on
[59:31] today is truth and it is life and it
[59:34] will take us all the way across he says
[59:36] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[59:39] go out into a place which he should
[59:41] after receive for an inheritance obeyed
[59:43] and he went out not knowing whether we
[59:45] went now I preached extensively on
[59:47] Abraham's Covenant so I'm not going to
[59:49] go into it but his Covenant was that God
[59:50] said is I'm going to take you and I'm
[59:52] going to make you a great nation I'm
[59:54] going to give you a land for that Nation
[59:56] but then he also said I'm going to be
[59:59] your God
[1:00:00] and you're going to be my people
[1:00:02] so there was a natural and there was a
[1:00:05] supernatural now it was going to take
[1:00:07] the supernatural to get the natural but
[1:00:09] then there's a supernatural to get the
[1:00:11] supernatural as well if I could put it
[1:00:12] that way
[1:00:13] but then he says by faith he sojourned
[1:00:16] in the land of promise as in a strange
[1:00:18] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[1:00:20] Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of
[1:00:22] the same promise so he's walking around
[1:00:24] in something that will belong to them
[1:00:26] but doesn't yet belong to them so he's
[1:00:29] it's theirs by promise but it's not
[1:00:31] theirs by possession yet but they're
[1:00:33] walking around in it they can literally
[1:00:35] see the land of promise
[1:00:38] but they don't possess it they're in it
[1:00:40] and they're blessed in it but they don't
[1:00:41] possess it yet
[1:00:42] why it says for he looked for a city
[1:00:45] which hath foundations whose Builder
[1:00:48] maker is god listen this really sets the
[1:00:50] tone for our expectation for this life
[1:00:51] because we expect God to do things here
[1:00:54] because he promised to do things here
[1:00:55] but our great expectation is in glory
[1:00:58] our great expectation is in a body
[1:01:00] change our great expectation is in a
[1:01:02] Rapture it's not just here
[1:01:04] so he said Abraham was not consumed with
[1:01:07] a natural land but he was looking for a
[1:01:09] land that would not fade away whose
[1:01:11] foundations were built by God who's
[1:01:12] whose maker was God his Focus was on the
[1:01:15] Eternal but he was still in the natural
[1:01:17] believing in the promise of God
[1:01:20] we've got to be able to hold those two
[1:01:21] things in our mind and in our lives and
[1:01:23] say Lord I'm believing for you here and
[1:01:25] I'm believing for you there
[1:01:29] he says through faith also Sarah herself
[1:01:32] received strength to conceive seed and
[1:01:34] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:01:36] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:01:38] who had promised Sarah was 90 years old
[1:01:40] when she had Isaac
[1:01:43] and Sarah had to have a body change
[1:01:45] before she could have him she went from
[1:01:47] old and wrinkly to a 20-something year
[1:01:49] old she went from old and Haggard to
[1:01:52] Young and the prettiest woman in the
[1:01:54] Kingdom
[1:01:55] listen plastic surgery has got nothing
[1:01:57] on God
[1:01:58] when God wants to make a change he makes
[1:02:00] a change in not only that but he fixed
[1:02:03] her problem in the meantime because the
[1:02:05] scripture says Sarah could not conceive
[1:02:06] a child her body couldn't do it she
[1:02:09] lacked strength something was wrong in
[1:02:10] it and when God gave her the promise he
[1:02:13] gave her the means to produce that
[1:02:14] Promise by fixing her body
[1:02:18] that's the supernatural
[1:02:20] God when he's bringing forth a promise
[1:02:22] he'll fix the thing in you that's
[1:02:23] holding that held it up in the natural
[1:02:25] and he'll produce the supernatural out
[1:02:27] of you and these things
[1:02:30] what was it it was God working in the
[1:02:31] land of the living
[1:02:33] the baby had to be Supernatural and so
[1:02:36] the supernatural had to come into her
[1:02:37] land of the living it had to come in her
[1:02:39] everyday life in her natural body
[1:02:42] it says therefore spring there even of
[1:02:44] one and him as good as dead so many as
[1:02:47] the stars of the sky and multitude and
[1:02:49] as the sand which is by the seashore
[1:02:50] numerable listen Paul's writing this and
[1:02:53] we often have this this ability to go in
[1:02:55] hindsight and have great faith
[1:02:58] faith in hindsight is not faith
[1:03:00] Paul can look and Paul is a part Paul is
[1:03:03] a part of the Fulfillment of God's
[1:03:05] promise to Abraham both naturally and
[1:03:07] spiritually and he's saying listen out
[1:03:09] of that one came everything a multitude
[1:03:12] as much as the Sands of the sea or the
[1:03:14] or the stars of the heavens but Abraham
[1:03:17] couldn't see any of this all he had was
[1:03:20] a promise to come out and I'll do it
[1:03:23] that's all he had
[1:03:24] listen and it says there these all died
[1:03:27] in faith not having received the
[1:03:30] promises
[1:03:31] but having seen them afar off and were
[1:03:34] persuaded of them and embraced them and
[1:03:37] confessed that they were strangers and
[1:03:39] pilgrims on the earth notice now Church
[1:03:41] they were convinced they believed that
[1:03:43] they were persuaded they embraced it
[1:03:45] that means they acted on it
[1:03:48] that means they moved with it and it
[1:03:50] moved with them it was a part of their
[1:03:51] everyday life and they confessed God's
[1:03:53] promise and yet the scripture says they
[1:03:55] died without receiving all of their
[1:03:57] promises
[1:03:58] not only that they died in faith still
[1:04:02] believing
[1:04:04] nothing wavering amen listen Abraham and
[1:04:07] his son and his grandson only saw a
[1:04:09] portion of the promise
[1:04:11] that's it
[1:04:13] but each one had their portion of the
[1:04:15] promise each one had their part to play
[1:04:18] and their part was Supernatural each and
[1:04:20] every one of them
[1:04:22] but they only saw a portion of it listen
[1:04:25] and Abraham had one child
[1:04:28] you look at Abraham's life and you say
[1:04:30] that's an awfully interesting
[1:04:32] interpretation of a promise of a people
[1:04:35] that's innumerable that is as many as
[1:04:36] the stars of the of the heavens or the
[1:04:38] Sands of the sea Abraham you've got one
[1:04:40] kid
[1:04:42] one kid this is really the promise
[1:04:45] but listen that one was a miracle
[1:04:48] and out of one Miracle came what two
[1:04:51] miracles
[1:04:53] because we come to Isaac and guess what
[1:04:55] God told Isaac out of you is going to be
[1:04:57] the promise you're the one that
[1:04:59] everything's going to come out of and
[1:05:00] Isaac goes and Rebecca his wife cannot
[1:05:03] conceive children
[1:05:05] she can't conceive they're under the
[1:05:08] promise and she can't conceive a child
[1:05:10] what did Isaac do church he prayed
[1:05:14] he prayed and he went to God and he said
[1:05:17] God you said
[1:05:19] you said
[1:05:21] that we were going to have children
[1:05:23] so he had to go and he had to pray to
[1:05:25] get God moving on the situation
[1:05:27] sometimes the only thing that's holding
[1:05:29] us back is the fact that we haven't gone
[1:05:31] to God and prayerfully confessed that
[1:05:34] we're believing him and we're expecting
[1:05:36] him to move in our lives that's it and
[1:05:38] as soon as soon as Isaac prays they get
[1:05:41] pregnant
[1:05:42] that's all it took was Isaac to go to
[1:05:45] God and remind him you told me
[1:05:47] I don't deserve it
[1:05:49] but you told me you told me we were
[1:05:51] going to have a child and he went to God
[1:05:53] and he prayed about it and all of a
[1:05:54] sudden she gets pregnant amen so then we
[1:05:57] go through Isaac and and he has two
[1:05:59] children and only one of them's good
[1:06:01] only one of them's good this is a really
[1:06:04] weird way to have a multitude of people
[1:06:07] one and then one bad and one good at
[1:06:10] each other's throats you're you're it's
[1:06:12] amazing that Jacob and Esau didn't kill
[1:06:14] each other and Jacob really would have
[1:06:16] died if he would have stuck around
[1:06:17] because Esau would have killed him you
[1:06:19] look at a church and you see it's only
[1:06:21] one it's only one thing it's only one
[1:06:24] step it's only one movement but if you
[1:06:26] can understand that it's inside of the
[1:06:28] promise then you can understand the
[1:06:29] Supernatural is moving
[1:06:31] that's the faith we have to see is that
[1:06:34] something's moving amen
[1:06:36] listen in the end
[1:06:38] when the Lord came to Abraham he said
[1:06:40] this he said is anything too hard for
[1:06:42] the Lord
[1:06:43] that's got to be our it's got to be our
[1:06:45] confession like that is though we only
[1:06:47] see one thing happening though we only
[1:06:48] see little baby steps yet we believe
[1:06:50] this that God is moving if we could only
[1:06:53] recognize when God starts moving it
[1:06:56] would settle us for the rest of it if
[1:06:58] you can see God making the change if you
[1:07:00] can see God making the move if you can
[1:07:02] see God opening the door opening the
[1:07:04] window or knocking down that first
[1:07:06] little bit of that wall that's been
[1:07:07] blocking you for years then you'll say
[1:07:09] praise the Lord we're going through
[1:07:11] praise the lord it's happening
[1:07:13] and you can have faith then for the rest
[1:07:15] of it and you'll get to the end in
[1:07:17] better shape than you started because
[1:07:18] your faith has been quickened because
[1:07:20] you recognize the hand of God moving in
[1:07:22] your life for that situation or whatever
[1:07:23] it might be
[1:07:25] I've been looking at things lately in
[1:07:27] within this church and I I see things
[1:07:29] and I say Lord that looks a lot like
[1:07:31] your handiwork
[1:07:33] and and my attitude frankly sometimes is
[1:07:35] could it be
[1:07:36] could it be is that really you Lord
[1:07:40] but if we have been praying then we
[1:07:42] ought to be expecting and our attitude
[1:07:44] should not be could it be it ought to be
[1:07:46] that's you that's you Lord you're moving
[1:07:49] you're doing it it's starting listen you
[1:07:51] got a a stone at the top of a hill and
[1:07:54] it's huge and it's big and it's heavy
[1:07:56] how many of you have ever been been on
[1:07:58] the edge of a cliff and there's a stone
[1:07:59] there and you were you had to rock it a
[1:08:01] while
[1:08:03] sometimes the rock doesn't move but all
[1:08:05] you got to get it is rocking a little
[1:08:07] bit
[1:08:08] and sometimes God's just rocking the
[1:08:10] situation
[1:08:11] and you see it start to move a bit it
[1:08:14] hasn't started tumbling
[1:08:16] but you're just getting some momentum to
[1:08:18] move
[1:08:19] back and forth back and forth and then
[1:08:21] the it gets wider and wider and deeper
[1:08:23] and deeper and then all of a sudden you
[1:08:25] give that last thing and
[1:08:27] and that last step is the quickest isn't
[1:08:29] it
[1:08:30] and it just decides to flop over and
[1:08:32] then it starts picking up speed down
[1:08:33] that hill and that bowler just goes and
[1:08:35] goes and goes and it's picking up speed
[1:08:37] and nothing can stop it once it goes if
[1:08:39] you can see that God's starting to rock
[1:08:40] the situation
[1:08:42] and say it's about to move
[1:08:45] it's about to open it's about to go down
[1:08:48] amen it's about to leave
[1:08:53] then
[1:08:54] you can have faith and you'll get to the
[1:08:57] end and you'll say I saw it from the
[1:08:59] start and it quickened my faith and look
[1:09:01] at what God has done amen
[1:09:03] listen our approach ought to be he's on
[1:09:05] the move
[1:09:07] God's in the situation
[1:09:09] he doesn't sleep he doesn't Slumber the
[1:09:10] scripture says he's moving in our midst
[1:09:12] and he's got a plan he's got a purpose
[1:09:14] and all these things amen listen
[1:09:15] sometimes what we see is not the final
[1:09:17] step it's only the first step
[1:09:19] maybe it's only an intermediate step and
[1:09:21] it's not all the way but it means it's
[1:09:23] moving
[1:09:24] the prophet of God would say this I
[1:09:27] don't care what it is if you say to the
[1:09:29] mountain be moved and maybe if you've
[1:09:31] got to go over the mountain for a
[1:09:32] purpose
[1:09:34] don't tempt God
[1:09:36] he's saying you got a reason to go then
[1:09:37] you speak
[1:09:39] somebody would say oh I'm a great man of
[1:09:41] faith I move that mountain he says it
[1:09:43] will never move
[1:09:45] but if there's something over the
[1:09:47] mountain that you've got to get over
[1:09:48] there for to do the will of God and you
[1:09:51] can't get over it you can't get under it
[1:09:53] you can't get around it and yet
[1:09:54] something in your heart is telling you
[1:09:56] to go you speak the word
[1:09:58] don't you doubt and maybe when you speak
[1:10:00] the word only one little grain of sand
[1:10:04] will fall
[1:10:06] you speak to that mountain are you going
[1:10:07] to see the sand of the grain of sandfall
[1:10:09] no
[1:10:11] you couldn't even see it if you're
[1:10:13] looking for it but he says you speak it
[1:10:14] and one grain of sand will fall but it's
[1:10:17] on the road it's on its Road the next
[1:10:20] day A Spoonful may drop
[1:10:22] who's going to notice a spoonful out of
[1:10:24] a mountain
[1:10:27] the next day a teacup full
[1:10:30] you will never notice it
[1:10:33] but if you will just hold steady knowing
[1:10:36] that it's being done after a while the
[1:10:40] whole thing will fall in
[1:10:45] That's the Way It Is by Divine Healing
[1:10:47] when you're seeing the working of the
[1:10:49] Holy Spirit the word laid on and the
[1:10:51] Holy Spirit anointing that word and
[1:10:52] proving it that he is here in our midst
[1:10:54] to vindicate himself and to give you the
[1:10:57] promise then you accept your healing if
[1:11:00] there's sin in your life get it out
[1:11:03] if there's condemnation get it out
[1:11:06] remember we spoke last service
[1:11:07] condemnation is of Satan because it
[1:11:09] points to your fault and it doesn't give
[1:11:11] you the remedy
[1:11:12] he says get rid of the fault get rid of
[1:11:14] the the shame get rid of the
[1:11:16] embarrassment and get rid of this idea
[1:11:17] that you can't overcome he says get rid
[1:11:19] of that and get to the remedy that
[1:11:21] Christ is
[1:11:22] he says get rid of that if there's
[1:11:24] condemnation get it out if there's doubt
[1:11:26] get it out until you can see perfectly
[1:11:29] that it's God's will it's God's plan and
[1:11:33] you're included in that
[1:11:35] you've got to see yourself in that word
[1:11:37] then he says say sickness in the name of
[1:11:40] Jesus Christ get away from me
[1:11:43] whether it's depression whether it's an
[1:11:45] it's a it's a becoming sin whether it's
[1:11:47] a habit whether it's a relationship
[1:11:49] whatever it is say Satan you've got to
[1:11:51] go
[1:11:53] and you expect the mountain to fall
[1:11:57] and remember you might not feel any
[1:12:00] better for a week you may not think any
[1:12:02] different you may not see a difference
[1:12:04] in your looks in your mentality
[1:12:06] doesn't have anything to do with it it
[1:12:09] may be breaking down one grain at a time
[1:12:12] he says but as soon as you said that
[1:12:14] word something happened
[1:12:17] God has to keep his word that sickness
[1:12:19] shakes and he begins to turn loose he
[1:12:22] will go if you'll just believe it don't
[1:12:24] doubt like Peter walking on the water he
[1:12:27] said why did you doubt oh ye of little
[1:12:29] faith just because he was thinking that
[1:12:33] had nothing to do with it
[1:12:36] you say I'm sinking how can I be in the
[1:12:38] Supernatural Brother John
[1:12:40] listen to this he said Christ had
[1:12:42] commanded him and his word was enough
[1:12:44] that's the way we should think too
[1:12:47] sometimes it seems like you get worse
[1:12:49] before you get better not just
[1:12:51] physically in sickness
[1:12:52] mentally emotionally relationally
[1:12:55] whatever it is sometimes your finances
[1:12:57] keep going downhill
[1:12:59] before they turn up he says as soon as
[1:13:01] you said the word something happened
[1:13:03] listen there cannot be a promise of
[1:13:05] healing without a day of healing there
[1:13:08] can't be a promise of Deliverance
[1:13:09] without a day of Deliverance there can't
[1:13:11] be a promise a provision without a day
[1:13:13] of provision it has to come in the land
[1:13:15] of the living it has to come in this
[1:13:17] life because that's what he promised it
[1:13:19] for amen if he has promised Grace or
[1:13:21] peace or rest or love there's got to be
[1:13:23] a day that has all of those things in it
[1:13:25] as you have need he will provide amen
[1:13:29] listen he said in Isaiah 53 so shall my
[1:13:32] word be that goeth forth out of my mouth
[1:13:34] it shall not return unto me void
[1:13:38] in other words it will not go out and
[1:13:40] have no effect it is not useless it goes
[1:13:43] out and it it has an effect it says but
[1:13:46] it shall accomplish that which I please
[1:13:48] and it shall prosper in the thing where
[1:13:52] unto I sent it listen the word was given
[1:13:54] for us here
[1:13:56] right now
[1:13:58] right here right now
[1:14:00] that's what it was given for amen we can
[1:14:02] be an expectation of God working in our
[1:14:04] lives today
[1:14:06] just not always at the rate we want
[1:14:11] you hear of people that were you know in
[1:14:13] in a in a prison they do a prison break
[1:14:15] and they tunnel out you know when they
[1:14:17] Allied in the war camps in Germany and
[1:14:19] that do you know how slow they had to do
[1:14:21] those things they built tunnels 300 feet
[1:14:23] long and they dig it with spoons
[1:14:26] dig it with spoons
[1:14:28] but they got out
[1:14:30] listen don't hinder God by saying it's
[1:14:33] taking too long
[1:14:34] say Lord you'll get it done in your time
[1:14:37] and look for the little clumps of dirt
[1:14:39] that show that the tunnel's being built
[1:14:41] look for evidence of change don't look
[1:14:44] for evidence of no change
[1:14:46] look through eyes of faith not eyes of
[1:14:48] doubt
[1:14:48] amen and then you'll start to be like
[1:14:50] Abraham I will call that which is not as
[1:14:53] if it is and I will ignore everything
[1:14:55] contrary to it in my life that's the
[1:14:57] faith that we're looking for amen
[1:15:00] back in Hebrews 11 it says for they that
[1:15:02] say such things declare plainly that
[1:15:04] they seek a country
[1:15:06] what not the land of Israel
[1:15:09] that was a promise but he was looking
[1:15:10] for the promise the kingdom of God where
[1:15:13] he says I will be your God and you will
[1:15:14] be my people amen there's a real promise
[1:15:16] and it lays in Redemption not in the
[1:15:18] natural here
[1:15:19] this is just a foreshadow of things to
[1:15:21] come it's a taste it's a spoonful
[1:15:24] of what we've been promised
[1:15:26] he says and truly if they had been
[1:15:28] mindful of that country from once they
[1:15:30] came out they might have had opportunity
[1:15:32] to return so in other words if you keep
[1:15:34] looking back at where you were what you
[1:15:36] had all these different things all the
[1:15:37] benefits the garlics and leaks of Egypt
[1:15:40] as the scripture talks about you keep
[1:15:41] looking at that you're never going to
[1:15:43] move forward
[1:15:44] Jesus said there are no man having put
[1:15:46] his hand to the plow and looking back is
[1:15:48] fit for the kingdom of God there's a
[1:15:50] drive there's a saying that says you
[1:15:52] can't drive looking in your rearview
[1:15:53] mirror you'll never go straight you'll
[1:15:55] never get to your destination safe
[1:15:56] because you're so concerned or you're so
[1:15:58] tied in to what you came out of Amen
[1:16:01] you've got to let go those things Paul
[1:16:02] said forgetting those things which are
[1:16:04] behind I press toward the mark for the
[1:16:06] prize of the high calling in Christ
[1:16:07] Jesus
[1:16:09] Let It Go
[1:16:11] it's done
[1:16:13] press forward
[1:16:15] for now they desire a better country
[1:16:18] that is and Heavenly wherefore God is
[1:16:21] not ashamed to be called their God for
[1:16:23] he hath prepared for them a city by
[1:16:25] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[1:16:27] up Isaac and he have received the
[1:16:28] promises offered up his only begotten
[1:16:31] son
[1:16:32] accounting sorry of whom it was said
[1:16:34] that in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:16:37] accounting that God was able to raise
[1:16:39] him up what faith
[1:16:42] God was able to raise him up even from
[1:16:44] the dead in a situation listen we're not
[1:16:48] even talking about situations of people
[1:16:49] have gone too far we're talking about
[1:16:51] dead knife in the heart dead
[1:16:54] okay this isn't figurative this is
[1:16:56] literally saying accounting believing
[1:16:58] that God was able to raise that son up
[1:17:00] that he had just killed
[1:17:02] he says from whence also he received in
[1:17:04] him a figure listen Abraham knew that
[1:17:06] Isaac was a miracle baby
[1:17:08] from a miracle wife and from a miracle
[1:17:10] husband
[1:17:10] so he said listen he's Supernatural all
[1:17:12] the way so the supernatural will have to
[1:17:14] continue because there's a promise
[1:17:15] that's over Isaac and it's got to happen
[1:17:17] that's the faith that he had that God
[1:17:19] would raise him up if Abraham actually
[1:17:21] was required to kill him
[1:17:22] it says now watch this
[1:17:25] by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
[1:17:28] concerning things to come so Abraham had
[1:17:30] the promise of a land
[1:17:33] and he passes it on to Isaac
[1:17:35] now Isaac's in the same situation as
[1:17:37] Abraham he sees no more
[1:17:39] but he has two kids instead of one
[1:17:42] so I he has a personal portion of the
[1:17:44] promise but he's not really seen
[1:17:45] anything so Isaac now blesses Jacob and
[1:17:48] Esau concerning what things to come he's
[1:17:51] sharing the word he's passing on the
[1:17:52] promise he's passing on the word to them
[1:17:54] and he's saying you keep pressing now
[1:17:56] you keep believing you keep acting on
[1:17:58] these things don't let it fall don't let
[1:18:00] it fail but keep believing and God will
[1:18:02] do it
[1:18:03] and now in verse 21 it says by faith
[1:18:05] Jacob when he was dying bless both the
[1:18:07] sons of Joseph and worship leaning upon
[1:18:09] the the top of his staff Jacob's now not
[1:18:12] even in the land of promise he's in a
[1:18:13] Strange Land he's dying
[1:18:16] but now we went from one kid to two kids
[1:18:18] now Jacob's got 12 kids
[1:18:20] God's moving and then those kids now
[1:18:23] have grandchildren so he's seen that God
[1:18:25] is starting to multiply so they've got a
[1:18:28] a path maybe you would see the growth in
[1:18:30] the people but they still don't have a
[1:18:31] land and that he's there and he's
[1:18:33] worshiping while dying saying I believe
[1:18:35] God's going to take you to it
[1:18:38] the word the promise just coming from
[1:18:40] generation to generation and they see it
[1:18:42] afar off and they're looking they say
[1:18:44] stick with it stick with it because it's
[1:18:46] going to happen
[1:18:48] by faith Joseph when he died made
[1:18:50] mention of the departing of the children
[1:18:52] of Israel and gave commandment
[1:18:54] concerning his bones Joseph was a
[1:18:56] prophet he was the the closest type of
[1:18:58] Christ that we have in the scripture and
[1:19:00] now he's there and he never gets to
[1:19:02] experience the reality of the promised
[1:19:03] land but he sees the growth again
[1:19:05] but they're still not innumerable maybe
[1:19:08] they've got hundreds
[1:19:10] not innumerable he doesn't have a land
[1:19:12] and yet he says it's going to happen and
[1:19:14] take me with you I don't want to rest in
[1:19:16] a Strange Land I want to rest where you
[1:19:18] guys are
[1:19:20] by faith Moses now we're 400 years down
[1:19:23] the road by faith Moses when he was born
[1:19:25] was hit three months of his parents
[1:19:27] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:19:29] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:19:31] commandment so the same promise that
[1:19:33] Abraham now has had is now driving Moses
[1:19:35] parents to act on the promise believing
[1:19:38] that now it is the time of Deliverance
[1:19:40] they protect the deliverer
[1:19:42] they act by faith they go against the
[1:19:45] king Commandments and and This Promise
[1:19:46] that's been passed from generation to
[1:19:48] generation they're quickened that this
[1:19:50] is now the time for it and they keep
[1:19:51] their son from dying
[1:19:53] what is it they were making sure that
[1:19:55] every generation was in expectation
[1:19:58] that every generation knew that the
[1:20:00] promise was there waiting to be
[1:20:01] fulfilled
[1:20:02] and now it goes to Moses and it says by
[1:20:05] faith Moses when he was come to years
[1:20:08] listen Moses laid hold of the promise
[1:20:10] himself
[1:20:12] young people that's what you've got to
[1:20:13] do you've got to lay hold of this
[1:20:15] promise this word for yourself
[1:20:18] you've got to say this is for me and I
[1:20:20] believe it and I'm going to act on it
[1:20:21] that's what you've got to do
[1:20:24] by Moses when he was by faith Moses when
[1:20:26] he was come to yours refused to be
[1:20:28] called the son of Pharaoh's daughter
[1:20:30] choosing rather to suffer Affliction
[1:20:32] with the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:20:35] pleasures of sin for a season it says
[1:20:37] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[1:20:41] the reproach of that was of greater
[1:20:43] value to him than the treasures of then
[1:20:46] greater riches than the treasures in
[1:20:48] Egypt for he had respect under the
[1:20:50] recompense of the war he made a
[1:20:52] conscious decision to walk away
[1:20:55] he made a conscious decision to forsake
[1:20:57] power and influence and money and women
[1:21:00] and all of these things he made a
[1:21:02] conscious decision to walk away from all
[1:21:04] of it deeming believing that what God
[1:21:07] had told him was worth more than what he
[1:21:09] had right here right now
[1:21:11] that's the kind of Faith Moses had
[1:21:15] it says by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:21:17] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:21:19] endured
[1:21:21] endurance is required
[1:21:24] that means God doesn't always move right
[1:21:27] now he's the god of right now but that
[1:21:29] means you don't always see it he endured
[1:21:31] as seeing him who was invisible and
[1:21:34] through faith he kept the Passover and
[1:21:35] the sprinkling of blood lest that he
[1:21:37] that destroyed the firstborn should
[1:21:39] touch them this is where the reality of
[1:21:41] The Exodus is starting to come in and
[1:21:43] they're saying we're going to go
[1:21:45] because Moses said we're about to go get
[1:21:47] in your houses get under the atonement
[1:21:49] there's a provision made for you get
[1:21:51] under the provision because the promise
[1:21:53] is about to be made made real
[1:21:55] it says by faith they pass through the
[1:21:57] Red Sea as by dry land which the
[1:22:00] Egyptians are saying to do were drowned
[1:22:02] can you imagine the excitement now they
[1:22:04] get out around the Exodus and then
[1:22:06] there's of course the the great worry
[1:22:08] and concern as the Egyptians come up and
[1:22:10] they Rebel and they they cry out and
[1:22:13] they complain but then they go through
[1:22:14] the Red Sea supernaturally and then they
[1:22:16] watch somebody try and copy them and die
[1:22:19] doing it
[1:22:20] because the Supernatural is only for
[1:22:22] Supernatural people
[1:22:24] and somebody tried to copy them and they
[1:22:25] die doing it so now they realize we're
[1:22:27] free we're really free they can't come
[1:22:30] after us they've just been destroyed
[1:22:31] completely now all we got to do is walk
[1:22:33] to the promised land
[1:22:35] they're in the middle of the promise and
[1:22:37] yet what happened we know they step back
[1:22:39] and their faith wavered and they got
[1:22:41] into doubt and they got into complaining
[1:22:42] in these different things but even in
[1:22:45] that God raised up a group who would
[1:22:47] believe
[1:22:48] even out of all that fate out of that
[1:22:50] doubt God raised up a group of faithful
[1:22:52] people faithful young people
[1:22:54] because that's what they were they were
[1:22:55] young
[1:22:56] they were young they were under 20 years
[1:22:57] old all of them when this whole thing
[1:22:59] started
[1:23:00] but now we get to verse 30 and it says
[1:23:02] by faith the walls of Jericho fell down
[1:23:04] after they were compassed about seven
[1:23:06] days listen this is the literal
[1:23:08] fulfillment of the promise of God this
[1:23:10] is the first step of that promise and
[1:23:12] this is the first land that they were
[1:23:13] able to take that was across the river
[1:23:15] Jordan that was in the land that God
[1:23:16] promised them 22 verses here spanning
[1:23:19] almost 500 years
[1:23:21] where was The Promise
[1:23:24] it was right there all along
[1:23:26] and God was moving but all they could
[1:23:28] each one see is one kid here
[1:23:31] one kid there
[1:23:32] then Jacob comes along 12 kids
[1:23:35] he took it personally
[1:23:38] and then they went and they had a
[1:23:39] bazillion kids
[1:23:41] and all of a sudden each one of them now
[1:23:43] has a portion of the promise right in
[1:23:46] their own house
[1:23:49] but did they realize it
[1:23:51] did they realize it
[1:23:53] they had their own portion of the
[1:23:55] supernatural right there and it was
[1:23:56] their own families
[1:23:58] that's it
[1:24:01] you say brother John why do we pray for
[1:24:03] our kids
[1:24:04] that's your promise that's your portion
[1:24:07] that's the Supernatural is our kids that
[1:24:10] can have a relationship with Christ just
[1:24:11] like we can that's why we fight that's
[1:24:13] why we pray that's why we have services
[1:24:15] and that's why we we do the things that
[1:24:17] we do and we sacrifice the things we do
[1:24:19] not so that they'll have great careers
[1:24:20] and and these different things but that
[1:24:22] they'll meet the Christ that we know so
[1:24:24] that they can have the promise that
[1:24:25] we're looking for as well amen
[1:24:28] listen 430 years all that happened was
[1:24:30] babies
[1:24:32] but babies were part of the promise
[1:24:34] and all they had to do was recognize
[1:24:36] them we're multiplying
[1:24:37] we're bigger than anybody
[1:24:41] that's all they had to do recognize the
[1:24:43] moving of God in their midst in the
[1:24:44] simplest of ways
[1:24:47] verse 32 says what more what shall I
[1:24:49] more say
[1:24:50] for the time would fail me to tell if
[1:24:52] Gideon and a Barrack and of Samson and
[1:24:54] objecta of David also in Samuel of the
[1:24:56] prophets
[1:24:57] who through faith subdued
[1:25:01] that's subdued we think that means that
[1:25:03] we defeated
[1:25:05] but you know what it means it means to
[1:25:07] struggle
[1:25:08] and overcome
[1:25:12] says they subdued kingdoms
[1:25:14] they wrote righteousness that means they
[1:25:16] did the right thing and brought to
[1:25:17] Justice those that didn't
[1:25:19] they wrought it they did it
[1:25:21] it says they obtained promises did it
[1:25:24] say they deserved them
[1:25:26] did say they earned them did it say they
[1:25:27] bought them no it says they obtained
[1:25:29] them
[1:25:30] obtain promises it means it says they
[1:25:33] stopped the mouth of lions listen God
[1:25:35] didn't keep Daniel out of the Lion's Den
[1:25:38] God hasn't promised us we'll never be in
[1:25:40] a place of peril a place where our life
[1:25:43] is in danger that there's that there's
[1:25:45] difficulty there's there's things facing
[1:25:47] us that can kill us sometimes the
[1:25:49] Supernatural is God binding Satan right
[1:25:51] in front of you
[1:25:52] remember that story of that man that was
[1:25:54] going to try and and beat up brother
[1:25:55] Branham and take over the meetings
[1:25:58] you would say the supernatural will be
[1:26:00] that that man never made it in
[1:26:02] the supernatural was that man coming in
[1:26:05] and Christ through that Prophet saying
[1:26:06] because you have challenged what
[1:26:09] him
[1:26:11] you must bow before me
[1:26:13] and he had to stop right there and fall
[1:26:15] down and confess and he was powerless
[1:26:18] powerless
[1:26:19] why because he was in the will of God
[1:26:21] that Prophet was in the will of God that
[1:26:23] service was in the will of God and God
[1:26:25] would allowed nothing to touch his
[1:26:26] prophet
[1:26:27] he didn't say you're never going to face
[1:26:29] lions
[1:26:30] but he did say he'll close their mouths
[1:26:33] sometimes you've got to realize that God
[1:26:34] allows you into the situation just to
[1:26:36] show you nothing can touch you unless I
[1:26:39] let it
[1:26:41] that's it
[1:26:42] sometimes you're going through it just
[1:26:43] so you can come out unscathed where
[1:26:45] everybody else got destroyed
[1:26:50] he says they did what quenched the
[1:26:53] violence of fire didn't keep the three
[1:26:54] Hebrew children out of the fire
[1:26:57] they walked in
[1:26:59] and the supernatural was happening even
[1:27:00] as they walked in because nobody could
[1:27:02] even stand the heat to get close to it
[1:27:04] and when they fall in it says it
[1:27:06] quenched the violence it took away the
[1:27:08] effects of the fire except in a way that
[1:27:10] benefited them and that's that it
[1:27:11] released their bonds
[1:27:13] the trial they went through freed them
[1:27:17] and God himself stepped down in the
[1:27:19] midst of them brother man talks about it
[1:27:21] and he says I'm going to go down this
[1:27:22] time
[1:27:23] because the Angels were saying we can go
[1:27:25] down we can put the Flames out he says
[1:27:26] no no I'm gonna go down this time they
[1:27:28] believed in me they professed that they
[1:27:30] believed that I could see I could save
[1:27:32] them he says I'm going to go down and
[1:27:33] I'm going to step in their midst and do
[1:27:34] that
[1:27:35] it says they escape the edge of the
[1:27:37] sword this is this is the the the
[1:27:39] actions of a God in the land of the
[1:27:41] living Church they escape the sword
[1:27:43] sometimes we want to stand and fight
[1:27:45] sometimes the working of God is that you
[1:27:47] don't have to fight at all
[1:27:49] that he just takes away of escape and
[1:27:51] you just slip out the side door
[1:27:53] sometimes we're struggling and we're
[1:27:55] overwhelmed and God says you don't have
[1:27:56] to fight this one I'll just make a way
[1:27:58] out
[1:27:59] just go and take some peace go and take
[1:28:00] some rest this one isn't for you today
[1:28:02] I'll take care of this one
[1:28:05] listen to this church out of weakness
[1:28:07] were made strong
[1:28:11] listen
[1:28:13] anybody feeling weak this morning
[1:28:15] anybody feeling overwhelmed this morning
[1:28:17] it says what out of weakness
[1:28:22] it's okay to start weak
[1:28:24] it's okay to admit I don't have it all
[1:28:27] but he says out of that weakness they
[1:28:30] were made strong they went from weak to
[1:28:32] strong they went from unable to Able
[1:28:34] they went from defeated to more than
[1:28:36] conquerors
[1:28:38] they went from no good to to Godly
[1:28:41] that's what God does he'll take you from
[1:28:43] where you are and he takes you to what
[1:28:45] he wants you to be amen
[1:28:47] listen he says they were waxed they
[1:28:49] waxed Valiant and fight now wax does not
[1:28:51] like we think of Wax
[1:28:53] you know waxing a car or waxing to take
[1:28:55] something off but this wax means that
[1:28:57] they were transformed they didn't start
[1:28:59] Valiant that were Valiant it means brave
[1:29:02] and powerful and mighty and courageous
[1:29:04] so in this in this fight they didn't
[1:29:07] start out that way but the longer they
[1:29:09] fought the braver they became the longer
[1:29:12] they fought the greater their strength
[1:29:13] became the longer they follow the
[1:29:15] greater their courage raised I'm
[1:29:17] reminded of shamgar
[1:29:19] 600 men 600 men and all he has is an ox
[1:29:23] goat maybe something the size of this
[1:29:25] with a sharp point on the end and he's
[1:29:27] going out against 600 Philistines fully
[1:29:30] armored Men of War and all shamgar is is
[1:29:33] a man in the land of promise
[1:29:37] do you think he was scared
[1:29:39] I think he was terrified
[1:29:42] but you know what he was he was sick and
[1:29:44] tired of Satan taking his family he was
[1:29:48] sick and tired of Satan putting it over
[1:29:50] on sick and tired of being sick and
[1:29:52] tired sick and tired of losing the
[1:29:55] blessings
[1:29:56] so he went out and he said it's me or
[1:29:59] it's you
[1:30:01] and he killed the first one
[1:30:07] fully armored Philistine Soldier he
[1:30:08] killed him with an ox goat
[1:30:10] a farm utensil
[1:30:13] then he killed the second one
[1:30:16] then he killed the third one
[1:30:19] pretty soon he was down 20.
[1:30:22] and I believe he got stronger as he went
[1:30:24] because the scripture says
[1:30:27] you wax Valiant in the fight
[1:30:29] sometimes you gotta say I'm fighting for
[1:30:31] it I'm not walking away anymore
[1:30:34] I'm not I'm not going to live below my
[1:30:36] privileges anymore
[1:30:38] if God has given it for me if God has
[1:30:40] promised it for me I'm going to take it
[1:30:43] after the first hundred
[1:30:45] I think he started to talk
[1:30:48] I think he started to say praise the
[1:30:49] Lord
[1:30:51] I thought he's I think he started to say
[1:30:53] Bring It On
[1:30:55] who's next
[1:30:58] I think they start to get worried after
[1:31:00] they saw a hundred down
[1:31:03] then he killed the next hundred
[1:31:06] surrounded him
[1:31:08] nothing could touch him
[1:31:10] the next hundred down they're down to
[1:31:12] half their men 300 men scattered around
[1:31:14] the farm of shamgar and all he has is an
[1:31:17] ox goat
[1:31:20] church if God gave it to you
[1:31:22] he'll make it last
[1:31:24] he's up against swords he's up against
[1:31:26] Spears he's up against arrows he's up
[1:31:29] against Shields he's up against armor
[1:31:30] he's up against helmets and he's got 300
[1:31:33] dead Philistines there and they're
[1:31:34] stupid enough to keep coming
[1:31:36] he says as long as you keep coming I'll
[1:31:38] keep killing
[1:31:40] can you imagine he was down to 599 dead
[1:31:43] and there's one idiot standing there
[1:31:45] still standing there thinking I'm gonna
[1:31:47] get shamgar
[1:31:48] everyone else is dead
[1:31:51] one idiot says I'm going to take him on
[1:31:54] I think shamgar just looked at him and
[1:31:55] shook his head
[1:31:59] and killed him
[1:32:00] and that was that
[1:32:04] they put a pin on their GPS and said
[1:32:06] don't go to this Farm anymore
[1:32:09] there's a guy with an ox code
[1:32:12] and he don't like us
[1:32:15] leave his home alone leave his family
[1:32:16] alone leave his crops alone leave his
[1:32:18] blessings alone because that man will
[1:32:20] stand for what God gave him
[1:32:23] one man
[1:32:24] shin guards only got I think one verse
[1:32:26] in the entire Bible
[1:32:28] one verse he waxed Valiant in fight
[1:32:33] church if you want to wax Valiant you
[1:32:35] got to start fighting
[1:32:37] you've got to start fighting and trust
[1:32:39] that he'll give you the strength he'll
[1:32:40] give you the courage he'll give you the
[1:32:42] endurance to come all the way through
[1:32:43] amen
[1:32:46] it says they turn to flight the armies
[1:32:49] of the aliens you can't turn to fight
[1:32:50] the armies of the aliens unless you face
[1:32:52] the armies of the aliens you got to face
[1:32:54] an army sometimes
[1:32:57] David's Mighty Men it was all about how
[1:32:59] many they could kill by themselves
[1:33:02] they faced armies they turned to flight
[1:33:03] armies all on their own
[1:33:06] Mighty Men of Valor Mighty women of
[1:33:08] value not listed in scripture but I'm
[1:33:10] saying we've got Mighty women of Valor
[1:33:11] here we're all Warriors we're all
[1:33:13] battles in this day amen
[1:33:16] listen they couldn't beat an army if
[1:33:17] they didn't face an army you can't beat
[1:33:19] that habit if you don't face it you
[1:33:21] can't beat the situation if you don't
[1:33:22] stand up to it and say I'm not getting
[1:33:24] what God promised me I'm here to take it
[1:33:27] back
[1:33:29] listen every single story that Paul
[1:33:31] talked about here happened in the
[1:33:32] day-to-day lives of believers
[1:33:34] this is not Supernatural up in heaven
[1:33:36] he's not talking about Michael and the
[1:33:38] archangels fighting against Satan he's
[1:33:40] talking about Believers Standing on the
[1:33:42] Promises and the word of God in every
[1:33:44] generation and laying hold of it and
[1:33:46] saying this is for me it's for here it's
[1:33:48] for now it's in my life today listen
[1:33:50] every single one of them knew that they
[1:33:52] had walked they were walking a path that
[1:33:54] God had put them on and that meant that
[1:33:56] he was with them you got to find the
[1:33:57] will of God and then you'll have the
[1:33:59] faith of God but if you know that he's
[1:34:01] with you then anything that stands
[1:34:03] Before You Must Fall brother Brown says
[1:34:05] if you've got a reason to go over that
[1:34:07] mountain and you can't get over it he
[1:34:09] says and you're in the will of God you
[1:34:10] speak to that mountain and it will go
[1:34:13] listen they didn't just believe he was a
[1:34:15] god of heaven or he was the god of my
[1:34:17] brother and he was the god of my sister
[1:34:18] they believed he was the God and the
[1:34:20] Lord of them personally and that's where
[1:34:22] we've got to be amen right in the in the
[1:34:24] land of the living right in our everyday
[1:34:26] lives
[1:34:27] brother Brian would say this
[1:34:28] just be sure it's God
[1:34:31] and then hold on to it
[1:34:33] stay with it when God says anything he
[1:34:36] has to keep his word be certain that
[1:34:39] it's God take God's word that's how you
[1:34:41] know it certainly God is that it's his
[1:34:43] word
[1:34:44] don't they hold of some Fantastical
[1:34:46] thing that you dreamed up in the night
[1:34:47] lay hold of the word
[1:34:51] if God Whispers to your heart I'm the
[1:34:53] Lord that healeth thee stay with it
[1:34:56] that's God's promise God promises to
[1:34:59] give the Holy Spirit he says stay with
[1:35:02] it until it comes
[1:35:04] I mean I want to as we start to close
[1:35:06] here
[1:35:10] I want to talk about our great promise
[1:35:12] because what is our great promise they
[1:35:13] had a promise of a land and a people and
[1:35:15] then they had a promise that they would
[1:35:16] God would be their God and they would be
[1:35:18] his people and we're a part of that
[1:35:19] second portion we know but but what is
[1:35:22] our promise
[1:35:23] Abraham had this promise that he'd be a
[1:35:25] great nation and a great land
[1:35:27] what is our promise that that that's
[1:35:29] similar to that
[1:35:31] First Corinthians 15 says behold I show
[1:35:33] you a mystery
[1:35:35] we shall not all sleep that says that
[1:35:37] means we'll not all die
[1:35:39] it says but we shall all be changed so
[1:35:42] some are going to die and some aren't
[1:35:43] going to die but we'll all be changed
[1:35:45] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:35:47] at the last Trump for the trumpet shall
[1:35:49] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:35:51] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[1:35:54] for this corruptable must put on
[1:35:55] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[1:35:58] immortality so when this corruption
[1:36:00] shall have put on incorruption and this
[1:36:02] Mortal shall have put on immortality
[1:36:04] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[1:36:06] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:36:09] Victory
[1:36:10] oh death where is thy sting oh grave
[1:36:14] where is thy Victory this thing of death
[1:36:16] is sin and the strength of sin is the
[1:36:18] law but thanks be to God which giveth us
[1:36:21] the victory through our Lord Jesus
[1:36:23] Christ
[1:36:24] therefore my beloved brethren he says
[1:36:27] having this promise Brothers
[1:36:30] be ye steadfast
[1:36:33] be unmovable
[1:36:36] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[1:36:40] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:36:42] is not in vain on the Lord listen our
[1:36:45] promise is a resurrection of rapture
[1:36:46] it's a body change and whether you go by
[1:36:48] way the Graver you go by way of a
[1:36:50] Rapture when that when that final sweep
[1:36:52] comes amen we have a promise that he's
[1:36:55] going to change us and it will be
[1:36:56] Incorruptible amen
[1:36:58] but that's far off and you say what
[1:37:00] evidence do I have of a Rapture today
[1:37:02] what evidence do I have of the
[1:37:04] Resurrection I can't see anything
[1:37:06] happening
[1:37:08] and if you're looking at big events you
[1:37:10] probably won't see anything happening we
[1:37:12] had a great sign when we had a Prophet
[1:37:14] come in this age and that was a call
[1:37:16] that woke us up and we know that there's
[1:37:18] a bridegroom coming because we had a
[1:37:20] call that said get yourself ready and he
[1:37:22] gave us a message to point us to the
[1:37:24] word that would get us ready
[1:37:26] so we know that there's a bridegroom
[1:37:28] coming we know that there's a marriage
[1:37:29] supper of the Lamb coming we know
[1:37:31] there's a resurrection and a Rapture but
[1:37:33] you've got to see that the steps to that
[1:37:35] are often so small as to be what
[1:37:37] completely unnoticeable
[1:37:40] and you won't attach the events to the
[1:37:43] final event
[1:37:45] but we've got to put on spiritual eyes
[1:37:47] amen and that's why we have a message is
[1:37:49] because that's what's going to give us
[1:37:51] those spiritual eyes it's gonna what
[1:37:53] does the prophet do he told us look for
[1:37:54] this look for these signs look at what's
[1:37:57] happening in the world look at Israel
[1:37:58] the time clock of God he pointed to the
[1:38:01] politics he pointed to religion he
[1:38:02] pointed to Hollywood he talked he
[1:38:04] pointed to the family and how it was
[1:38:06] being broken up he pointed to all these
[1:38:08] things he says look up your Redemption
[1:38:09] draweth nigh
[1:38:11] so we've had a warning we've had a
[1:38:12] message that tells us to be looking for
[1:38:14] it the question is are we seeing it
[1:38:16] do you know what the movement of the
[1:38:19] Rapture is
[1:38:20] do you know what it looks like to
[1:38:22] experience a portion of the Resurrection
[1:38:23] Right Here and Now
[1:38:25] listen we're human
[1:38:27] and in our Humanity our vision and our
[1:38:30] understanding our Cape our capacity to
[1:38:31] understand the full picture is so
[1:38:33] limited so many times but he said I've
[1:38:35] given you the mind of Christ
[1:38:37] said you'll catch it so that you'll be
[1:38:38] aware because Jesus said you're my
[1:38:40] friends and that's why I tell you these
[1:38:42] things you're my brothers I've let you
[1:38:44] in on the secret so don't let doubt or
[1:38:47] don't let your eyes get filmed over like
[1:38:48] John the Baptist
[1:38:50] keep your eyes open be looking for these
[1:38:52] things
[1:38:54] listen we're looking for the
[1:38:55] supernatural of of God to move and take
[1:38:58] us off the Earth that's our Heavenly
[1:38:59] promise but the promise on the land of
[1:39:01] the living is what takes us to the
[1:39:03] promise of the supernatural in heaven
[1:39:05] there's a promise here there's an
[1:39:07] expectation what is a Rapture it's a
[1:39:09] total healing Rapture is total healing
[1:39:14] we have a body that will be incorrupted
[1:39:16] like unto his glorious body the
[1:39:18] scripture says and it's meant to last
[1:39:19] forever but in the meantime he gives us
[1:39:22] a taste of it
[1:39:23] he gives us a spoonful of it he gives us
[1:39:26] a teapot of it and what is it it's
[1:39:28] Divine Healing
[1:39:29] it's the promise that I stayed at the
[1:39:31] whipping post and the and the Flesh and
[1:39:33] the muscles and the skin off my body
[1:39:35] were ripped away so that you could be
[1:39:37] healed
[1:39:39] that's our Taste of the Resurrection
[1:39:40] that's our Taste of the Rapture is
[1:39:42] Divine Healing it's the children's bread
[1:39:44] it's a fullness of the ra it's a portion
[1:39:48] of the of the Rapture in the land of the
[1:39:50] living
[1:39:51] so your healing your promise is what
[1:39:54] points you to a rapture
[1:39:58] so when you're healed
[1:40:00] say I'm also raptured then
[1:40:03] because if he's healing me now that
[1:40:04] means he's going to Rapture me then
[1:40:05] because there's a portion that's working
[1:40:07] in my life amen what is a Rapture it's
[1:40:10] total peace and rest
[1:40:13] you won't have peace and rest listen our
[1:40:15] days are short and full of trouble
[1:40:17] that's what we have here but over there
[1:40:19] is all peace and rest the scripture says
[1:40:21] he will wipe all tears from our eyes
[1:40:23] and everything in our past there'll be
[1:40:25] no more death there's no more sorrow nor
[1:40:27] crying nor pain and the only thing that
[1:40:30] passes away is our painful past
[1:40:32] all the flaws and the failures and the
[1:40:34] battles and the offenses and the
[1:40:36] difficulties and all of these different
[1:40:37] things that is what goes away and you're
[1:40:39] at total peace and rest because you're
[1:40:42] at your Warrior you're with your
[1:40:43] bridegroom it's total peace and rest
[1:40:46] but listen while we're here we get a
[1:40:48] spoonful and what is it it's a peace
[1:40:51] that surpasses all understanding and
[1:40:53] that's available today
[1:40:55] you don't have to wait over there to get
[1:40:56] a piece that goes beyond your
[1:40:58] understanding beyond what you think is
[1:41:00] is possible in this world he gives you a
[1:41:02] piece here and what is it it's a it's a
[1:41:04] little portion of the supernatural in
[1:41:06] the land of the living
[1:41:08] what is a rapture
[1:41:09] total Deliverance
[1:41:11] total Deliverance because we have we're
[1:41:14] here in this thinking flesh
[1:41:16] and it's not saved and it can't be saved
[1:41:19] and it won't be saved
[1:41:21] but when you get a body change amen when
[1:41:24] you're together with Christ in harmony
[1:41:25] now there's no fighting he has perfect
[1:41:29] preeminence and you are subject to him
[1:41:31] and you speak with him as one
[1:41:35] that's total Deliverance you're
[1:41:38] delivered from the influence of your own
[1:41:40] ideas of your own intellect of your own
[1:41:42] education of your own experience
[1:41:44] and what is our Taste of total
[1:41:45] Deliverance it's the Holy Ghost
[1:41:47] because the Holy Ghost is what helps us
[1:41:49] to submit the Holy Ghost is what helps
[1:41:51] us to surrender the Holy Ghost is what
[1:41:53] helps us to speak what he wants us to
[1:41:55] speak and it's just a portion it's a
[1:41:57] down payment it's an earnest
[1:41:59] of the rapture
[1:42:02] because we only have a bit of it
[1:42:04] we don't have the whole thing
[1:42:07] but if we can see that I've got the Holy
[1:42:08] Ghost and he doesn't give that to me
[1:42:10] unless he's going to Rapture me unless
[1:42:11] he's going to resurrect me that's our
[1:42:14] hope
[1:42:14] that's our land of the living portion of
[1:42:17] the supernatural that awaits Us in that
[1:42:19] perfect relationship with Christ over

[1:43:47] Amen he says now right now we're setting
[1:43:51] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and
[1:43:53] there is nothing that can harm us
[1:43:57] listen I want to close with one more
[1:43:59] quote and I I use this as a closing
[1:44:02] quote when I preach with Brother John
[1:44:03] Andes in in in February but someone
[1:44:05] shared it with me this week
[1:44:07] and I thought it was a wonderful
[1:44:09] wonderful way to close this service out
[1:44:12] speaking of Christ it says Jesus Christ
[1:44:13] no matter if he was in a storm and the
[1:44:16] Gale is knocking the boat from one side
[1:44:18] to the other or he was standing in the
[1:44:20] face a mess of demons if he was hanging
[1:44:23] anywhere it never moved him
[1:44:25] he walked right on just as calm and
[1:44:27] quiet as he could be
[1:44:29] why
[1:44:30] he was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:44:33] anything around him that's right whether
[1:44:36] it was going to happen or whether it
[1:44:37] wasn't going to happen he knewed what if
[1:44:40] the situation looked like it wasn't
[1:44:41] going to go the way that it was supposed
[1:44:43] to go
[1:44:43] he says it didn't move and why he knew
[1:44:46] it was going to happen because God said
[1:44:47] so
[1:44:48] he didn't say oh have I prayed through
[1:44:50] have I wonder if I fasted long enough
[1:44:53] wonder if I did this he just walked
[1:44:55] right on unconscious that's right he
[1:44:58] believed what God Said was truth the
[1:45:01] words must be fulfilled and he knew that
[1:45:03] his life was to fulfill them
[1:45:06] his life was to fulfill them if the
[1:45:09] spirit and the mind of Christ is in you
[1:45:11] then there must be a word for you to
[1:45:13] fulfill personally in the land of the
[1:45:15] living so expect it to happen in your
[1:45:18] life expect it to happen in your family
[1:45:20] expect it to happen in your job expect
[1:45:22] it to happen in your marriage
[1:45:25] because there's a word for you to
[1:45:27] fulfill and it's personal and it's part
[1:45:29] of us moving into that great rapture
[1:45:32] he says and you're here to fulfill it
[1:45:35] too don't leave it with Christ Christ is
[1:45:38] here in you the hope of glory
[1:45:41] if you're you're here to fulfill it too
[1:45:42] just walk unconscious of fear walk
[1:45:46] unconscious of criticism
[1:45:48] walk unconscious and unto the world walk
[1:45:52] as you walk in Christ walk with him
[1:45:56] not paying any attention the right or
[1:45:58] left hand just keep moving on if
[1:46:01] something comes up in the church
[1:46:03] walk with God
[1:46:05] Hallelujah if sickness strikes you
[1:46:08] walk with God if the neighbor don't like
[1:46:10] you walk with God just keep on Walking
[1:46:14] with God Enoch one day he walked like
[1:46:16] that
[1:46:18] you know what Enoch didn't just walk one
[1:46:20] day
[1:46:21] he walked every day
[1:46:23] but take it one day at a time
[1:46:26] don't don't don't dwell on what's going
[1:46:28] to happen tomorrow don't get caught up
[1:46:31] in fear and worry and concern and what
[1:46:33] if scenarios walk today with God
[1:46:37] Enoch one day walk like that you know
[1:46:39] what he done he walked all the way home
[1:46:42] with God got so far up the road he
[1:46:45] didn't want to come back anymore
[1:46:49] walk with God
[1:46:51] the doctor says you're going to die
[1:46:53] walk with God
[1:46:55] yeah the doctor says you can't well walk
[1:46:57] with God just walk with God that's all
[1:46:59] for God has promised you I personal
[1:47:03] pronoun will never leave you
[1:47:05] or forsake you I will be with you to the
[1:47:09] end of the world and he took an oath by
[1:47:12] that Covenant that he gave you that he
[1:47:13] would confirm it just walk with God then
[1:47:17] listen to this church as we close
[1:47:20] you'll never have a problem
[1:47:23] you'll never have a concern
[1:47:26] you'll never fall you never fail is
[1:47:28] everybody reading this with me am I
[1:47:30] reading that correctly
[1:47:34] that's not what it says
[1:47:37] you'll have your ups and downs
[1:47:41] don't worry
[1:47:43] you got to go through Briar patches
[1:47:46] over sharp rocks
[1:47:48] over Bluffs
[1:47:50] down over the hillsides up through the
[1:47:52] mountains over Waters he says but walk
[1:47:56] with God
[1:47:59] yes sir there's so many Hills to climb
[1:48:01] upward you've heard that old song but
[1:48:03] how little it'll seem when you get to
[1:48:06] the end
[1:48:07] of the way and then God bless you let's
[1:48:10] stand together if we would
[1:48:21] I want you to take courage this morning
[1:48:24] how many stories have we read how many
[1:48:26] scriptures have we said
[1:48:30] let's say you're going to make it
[1:48:31] through
[1:48:33] sometimes he's just waiting for you to
[1:48:35] save God I believe
[1:48:37] sometimes you just wait for you to get
[1:48:38] up and be honest
[1:48:41] and sometimes he's what he's asking you
[1:48:42] to just take your hands off and let me
[1:48:44] make the Escape for you
[1:48:46] God moves in many ways and he moves in
[1:48:47] our lives in different ways and he works
[1:48:49] with us according to the way we are
[1:48:51] but he always has a way for us to come
[1:48:54] through
[1:48:55] and we don't have to put it off till
[1:48:57] tomorrow
[1:48:58] we don't have to carry a burden into
[1:49:00] next week
[1:49:01] we don't have to dwell on things that
[1:49:03] are holding us back and not deal with
[1:49:05] them we can deal with them here we can
[1:49:06] deal with them today
[1:49:08] amen and you can have an expectation
[1:49:10] that when you break when you bring it to
[1:49:12] him he hears he answers and it starts to
[1:49:17] move
[1:49:18] and you may go home and you may say
[1:49:20] brother John I don't feel a bit
[1:49:21] different
[1:49:22] nothing's changed nothing's moved
[1:49:25] don't look at that
[1:49:27] remember he said when Peter started to
[1:49:29] sink he said that had nothing to do with
[1:49:30] it Christ had called him to walk on
[1:49:32] water and he just had to keep walking
[1:49:35] keep walking this morning
[1:49:37] if you need to start walking start
[1:49:39] walking
[1:49:41] if you need to start praying start
[1:49:42] praying you need to start believing
[1:49:44] start believing but don't stay in your
[1:49:46] current condition this morning believe
[1:49:48] that he's moving in your midst in your
[1:49:50] life personally and if you made him Lord
[1:49:52] if you've made him savior then he is
[1:49:55] there to meet the needs of your life
[1:49:56] here and now
[1:49:58] let's not be so spiritual that we can't
[1:50:00] see the supernatural in our lives amen
[1:50:02] let's trust
[1:50:04] let's believe let's speak
[1:50:07] let's speak let's confess the word God
[1:50:10] loves to hear his word repeated back to
[1:50:11] him that's why you take it back to the
[1:50:14] word and you say God I'm believing what
[1:50:15] you said I'm believing
[1:50:17] by your stripes I am healed
[1:50:20] I'm believing that if you lay hands on
[1:50:22] us on me that somebody will cast that
[1:50:24] demon out
[1:50:25] Lord that there can be peace and rest in
[1:50:27] a time of great trial and struggle
[1:50:30] that you can save my children
[1:50:33] that you can correct the situation that
[1:50:35] you can restore
[1:50:37] that you can redeem
[1:50:39] that you can heal and that you can save
[1:50:42] that you can fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:50:45] or maybe fill me with the Holy Ghost
[1:50:47] again
[1:50:48] anew
[1:50:50] that you can be a rock in a dry place
[1:50:52] that splits open and gives me all the
[1:50:54] water that I could ever take
[1:50:56] that's the kind of God we serve amen
[1:50:58] let's just bow our heads if we would
[1:51:02] Mr Maureen if you would play that song
[1:51:04] in your presence
[1:51:06] I want to go
[1:51:08] quietly all heads bowed
[1:51:12] look into your life this morning
[1:51:19] and I want you to look and say
[1:51:21] is something holding me back
[1:51:25] is something overshadowing me
[1:51:28] as something got me in a thorn patch
[1:51:31] and I'm stuck and I can't get out
[1:51:35] maybe you've got a besetting sin
[1:51:41] now you've got a relationship you
[1:51:43] shouldn't have
[1:51:47] husbands maybe our headship isn't where
[1:51:49] it ought to be
[1:51:51] wise maybe our obedience isn't where
[1:51:53] it's supposed to be
[1:51:57] every head's bowed every eye is closed
[1:52:00] you got a need
[1:52:02] you let him know it
[1:52:08] break that barrier of gravity and say
[1:52:10] Lord I'm raising my hand
[1:52:12] because I've got a need
[1:52:15] Lord and I am sick
[1:52:18] I'm sick
[1:52:20] of not being where I ought to be
[1:52:23] not saying you're lost I'm not saying
[1:52:25] you're you're a failure what I'm saying
[1:52:27] is there's a place for God to move in
[1:52:30] there's a need
[1:52:32] there's a desire
[1:52:35] and you know there's a higher plane
[1:52:36] there's a greater victory
[1:52:40] let's just go to him in prayer
[1:52:43] Heavenly Father
[1:52:45] Lord I believe this was a message
[1:52:48] of overcoming power this morning
[1:52:51] not my words
[1:52:53] your word
[1:52:55] not my spirit your spirit
[1:52:59] Lord and we've read that scripture
[1:53:00] recently where it says where the spirit
[1:53:02] of the Lord is
[1:53:03] there is Liberty
[1:53:06] Lord and I believe if we'll humble
[1:53:08] ourselves and call on your name
[1:53:11] Lord if we'll put the word on our lips
[1:53:14] Lord you'll come in our midst and you'll
[1:53:15] touch
[1:53:16] and you'll heal and you'll deliver and
[1:53:19] you'll save and you'll fill and you'll
[1:53:22] refill

[1:53:39] that works in the land of the living
[1:53:41] Lord the word says you're not a god of
[1:53:43] the dead but you're the god of the
[1:53:45] Living Lord your living bride is here

[1:54:12] have to live in for now Lord in these

[1:54:22] past that which we cannot do on our own

[1:54:57] places in Christ and we're claiming our
[1:54:59] position we're claiming our promises

[1:55:08] out and say there's a remedy there's a
[1:55:10] path there's a way there's a blood

[1:55:15] ghost to give us power that overcomes
