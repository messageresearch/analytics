[49:04] better believe it or not uh today's the
[49:06] best it's been so we thank the Lord for

[49:10] and uh taking that away amen certainly
[49:12] enjoyed the specials this morning thank
[49:14] you sister Florence it's
[49:15] uh you know when you go through
[49:17] something tough It's hard to come back
[49:19] and say but God's God and to say he does
[49:23] all things well and he has a purpose and
[49:25] he has these things and that's a sign of
[49:26] a believer is that whether it's in the
[49:28] highs or whether it's in the lows they
[49:30] can say God is God and we trust him and
[49:32] we love him and we know that he's
[49:34] working all things for our good amen and
[49:35] then sister Moren I'd asked in previous
[49:38] Services did we know the verses to that
[49:40] that song because I know them but not
[49:42] everybody else does and so she went and
[49:43] learned them saying them as a special so
[49:45] I certainly appreciate that amen it was
[49:47] wonderful amen Psalms 144 and verse1
[49:50] says this blessed be the Lord my
[49:52] strength which te teacheth My Hands to
[49:55] War and my fingers to fight my goodness
[49:59] and my Fortress my high tower and my
[50:02] deliverer my shield and he in whom I
[50:05] trust who subdueth my people under me
[50:09] amen God bless you you can have your
[50:10] seats this morning and I want to take a
[50:12] turn this morning and we've been
[50:14] preaching the series on manifesting time
[50:16] and the adoption of the children of God
[50:18] and it's going to take us a few services
[50:20] to get to the finishes finish on this
[50:22] and it's been nearly a year of study and
[50:24] preaching and we're getting close to the
[50:26] in so it's uh we'll see how many
[50:28] services it takes I've got at least one
[50:30] or two more services of notes back home
[50:32] but I want to take a title this morning
[50:34] of teach My Hands to War amen teach My
[50:37] Hands to War and we've talked about so
[50:40] much in this series we've talked about
[50:41] what it means to be a child of God and
[50:43] the the training and the tutoring that
[50:45] we go through and the Holy Ghost has
[50:46] given to us first to tutor and train us
[50:48] and to bring our lives subject to the
[50:50] word and to bring our minds subject to
[50:51] the word to bring our decisions subject
[50:53] to the word and to bring our jobs
[50:54] subject to the word and to bring our
[50:56] fames subject to the word and all of
[50:58] these things and it's a time of trying
[50:59] and testing but then there's a time
[51:01] where where the tutor says to the father
[51:03] he says all right he's ready or she's
[51:05] ready and there's an adoption moment
[51:07] amen and so we've talked about all these
[51:09] different things and and we know that
[51:11] all these things are for a purpose we
[51:13] know that the things that happen in our
[51:14] life are for a purpose and the purpose
[51:17] of everything that's happening is to
[51:18] bring you into God's purpose amen when
[51:20] we look at these things that happen and
[51:22] we look at the UPS we look at the downs
[51:24] and we want the UPS to be about God and
[51:25] the Downs to be about Satan but that's
[51:27] not the way it is in the believer's life
[51:29] God is there as much in the Downs as he
[51:30] is in the ups and he's using all of
[51:32] those things to bring us into his
[51:34] purpose and the purpose of adoption is
[51:36] to save you from yourself it's to take
[51:39] you completely out of this fleshly
[51:41] nature it's to take you out of this
[51:42] carnal nature it's to take you out of
[51:44] the sin realm that is in these Fallen
[51:46] broken bodies and to take you back what
[51:48] God intended for you to be before time
[51:50] even began to bring you back into the
[51:52] very uh manifestation of the thoughts
[51:55] that God had for you Before Time began
[51:57] it takes you out of the clutches of this
[51:59] world it takes you out of the clutches
[52:00] of Satan's Eden it takes you out of the
[52:02] mindset of the way that people think
[52:04] today why because they've gotten so far
[52:06] away from God that they can't even come
[52:08] close to him anymore and it takes a
[52:09] breakthrough it takes the sovereignty of
[52:11] God to pierce that veil of insanity
[52:13] that's over people today and the thing
[52:15] that adoption does is it brings you into
[52:17] a new creature a new creation in Christ
[52:20] where you can have his nature you can
[52:22] have his word you can have his power and
[52:24] his authority flowing through your life
[52:26] amen and God has an involved group of
[52:28] people we do not sit here and we don't
[52:29] sit back on a couch and just say well
[52:31] I'm a Christian I'm a Believer and
[52:33] therefore I'm going to heaven and I'm
[52:35] going to receive eternal life no God has
[52:37] people that are involved in what he's
[52:39] doing that's the purpose of the adoption
[52:40] that Paul spoke about in the scriptures
[52:42] was to bring us to a place where God can
[52:44] use us and we're at the rolling up of
[52:46] the seventh Church age to the Gentiles
[52:48] we're at the rolling up of all time and
[52:50] so God is trying to come to a place with
[52:52] us where he says I can use you now
[52:54] that's what God's trying to do amen
[52:56] God's saying I want to use you in a
[52:58] particular way but I just need to train
[52:59] you and test you and bring you to a
[53:01] place where I can trust you to do it
[53:03] listen to this he says God has so
[53:04] arranged it that his program cannot move
[53:07] without you and I see we think God can
[53:10] do anything God's not bound by anything
[53:12] but God has bound himself to a certain
[53:14] degree to using you and I amen and you
[53:16] see it all through scriptures that he
[53:18] uses people flawed people imperfect
[53:21] people but people nonetheless that will
[53:23] surrender and yield to God and he comes
[53:25] in and he uses to perform his works and
[53:28] he uses them to perform his will his
[53:30] program cannot move without you and I
[53:32] and as long as we're not doing what God
[53:34] leads us to do we're paralyzing his
[53:37] program he says but when the church
[53:39] moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[53:42] then we are in God's will doing his
[53:44] program anden I said we're at the end of
[53:46] the Gentile age we're at the end of the
[53:48] seventh Church age where time shall be
[53:50] no more as we read in in Revelations 10
[53:53] and and we look there in Revelations 10
[53:55] and that Mighty angel comes down and
[53:57] that's Christ and he says it's going to
[53:59] be all wrapped up now it's the ending of
[54:02] all things and brother Jerry and brother
[54:03] Paul both touched on this this past
[54:05] weekend speaking on the seventh seal
[54:07] because the seventh seal is the wrapping
[54:09] up of the entire Redemption plan of God
[54:12] in a timeline it goes all the way from
[54:14] the fourth seal which is the end of the
[54:15] Gentile Church age all the way through
[54:17] the Sixth Seal all the way through the
[54:19] tribulation all the way through the
[54:20] Millennium all the way through the white
[54:22] Throne judgment and then it finishes
[54:24] with a new Heaven and a new Earth
[54:26] because you got to realize that's the
[54:27] full Redemption plan is to bring us back
[54:29] to the original and when the new Heaven
[54:31] and the new Earth come back that's the
[54:33] original we're back to where we were
[54:35] supposed to have been in all this time
[54:36] and so that's when the seventh seal
[54:38] finishes but the seventh seal when you
[54:40] see in the Scripture it says that there
[54:42] was silence in heaven for about the
[54:44] space of a half an hour why because God
[54:47] has already spoken what needs to be
[54:48] spoken God has already written what
[54:50] needs to be written now what he's doing
[54:52] in Revelation 10:7 is he steps down and
[54:55] he's a mighty Angel that's Christ coming
[54:57] down and he's coming into action and he
[54:59] says it's time to finish the works that
[55:01] I said I was going to do that's what the
[55:03] seventh seal is about this the sealed
[55:05] book remember was the book of redemption
[55:07] and John wept because nobody could open
[55:09] it but then he said no the lion of the
[55:11] tribe of Judah has prevailed and who
[55:13] steps out it's a lamb slain bloody it's
[55:16] Christ stepping out and he takes the
[55:18] book and what does he do he opens it up
[55:20] and in Revelation 10 he doesn't come
[55:22] down with a closed book he comes down
[55:25] with an open book why because he's
[55:27] reading out of the Redemption book He's
[55:29] reading the names of the people whose
[55:31] lives are are are inside of that and
[55:33] what do he doing he's calling our name
[55:36] and as he tears the seal off of each of
[55:38] Our Lives we hear our name and we start
[55:40] to recognize hey I'm a Child of God I'm
[55:43] not just a a person walking through this
[55:46] life I'm not just born into something
[55:48] I'm just not a member of a family but I
[55:50] am a child of God and what happens is
[55:52] life bursts forth It's that word seed
[55:54] that was inside of our heart from before
[55:56] the foundation of the world and we come
[55:58] and we're quickened by the power of the
[56:00] holy spirit in the word of our life and
[56:02] it starts to bring forth something and
[56:04] we realize there's more to this than I
[56:06] thought amen there's more to this life
[56:08] than I plot than I had thought and so we
[56:10] realize it and we start to step into the
[56:13] fullness of the Redemption plan of God
[56:15] Amen I don't just want to be half in and
[56:17] half out one foot in one foot out you
[56:19] can't do that that's lukewarmness that's
[56:22] death but if we can step into the
[56:23] fullness as the holy spirit opens the
[56:25] word to us that's when God starts to
[56:27] grow a bride to produce a church and
[56:30] that Redemption plan is not just God it
[56:32] involves us now we are not redeemers we
[56:34] can't be we needed a redeemer we need a
[56:37] redeemer so we can't redeem if we are
[56:39] under a redeemer already and we can't be
[56:41] a savior because we needed a savior but
[56:43] yet God uses his people in this
[56:45] Redemption plan to bring others to him
[56:48] because if I was a redeemer I'd bring
[56:50] people to me but I don't I point them to
[56:53] Christ because he's the only one that
[56:54] can do something for them amen God works
[56:57] through his children and he always has
[56:59] and each one of us has a particular part
[57:00] to play in that it says and see how God
[57:03] in his great plans just knew how to make
[57:05] every person just exactly to be a
[57:08] certain thing see we focus on the
[57:10] differences and think that that makes us
[57:11] less no the difference is is what makes
[57:13] you exactly what God needs you to
[57:15] be he says he made every person just
[57:19] exactly to be a certain thing why
[57:21] because he's going to use them for that
[57:23] purpose can I get an amen this morning
[57:25] God uses me for my purpose when we wake
[57:28] up in the morning my wife and I pray
[57:29] together and what do we pray God let us
[57:31] catch your purpose for this day because
[57:34] the purpose for the day is set in
[57:35] certain things I've got to be a father
[57:37] I've got to be a husband she's got to be
[57:38] a mother she's got to be a wife but in
[57:41] those things Lord what is your will the
[57:44] basics are always there but Lord as
[57:46] opportunities come our way as
[57:47] circumstances arise as people come into
[57:50] our lives Lord what do you want me to do
[57:52] what do you want me to say what do you
[57:53] want me to not say sometimes I me Lord
[57:56] how do you want me to react Lord what
[57:58] would you have this family to do for you
[58:00] today that ought to be our cry every
[58:02] morning is Lord help me be finding your
[58:05] purpose for my life day by day amen and
[58:08] that's a battle that's a battle every
[58:10] single day because remember I and I
[58:12] don't want to be too funny this
[58:14] morning but remember that person that
[58:16] was that was praying they said Lord It's
[58:19] been a wonderful day and I haven't made
[58:21] any mistakes and I'm at such peace but
[58:25] Lord I'm about to get out of bed now and
[58:28] I need your help for the rest of the day
[58:30] isn't that the way it is we get out of
[58:31] bed and we have our devotions we read
[58:33] our Bible we pray together and then our
[58:35] feet hit the floor and then that's when
[58:37] the trials really start that's when we
[58:39] need the victory is when we get out of
[58:41] our beds and we start trying to do what
[58:43] the word tells us to do that's a battle
[58:45] every single day because Satan's there
[58:47] to distract us constantly that is
[58:50] Satan's greatest uh uh weapon these days
[58:52] I believe is distraction to absorb the
[58:55] things that the time that we have you
[58:57] know my wife and I were talking about it
[58:59] yesterday how that we have so much to
[59:02] make our lives
[59:03] easy sisters you don't have to go and
[59:06] scrub your clothes by hand in a wash
[59:09] basin
[59:10] now and hang them out you can just throw
[59:12] them in a machine and pour in one or two
[59:14] things doom boom hit a button and you're
[59:16] good to go you can put them in a dryer
[59:19] you don't have to hang them out you
[59:20] don't have to watch out for the weather
[59:21] everything's taken care of you dishes
[59:23] washed by
[59:25] machine you don't have to take the rugs
[59:27] out and beat them you got a vacuum
[59:28] cleaner that'll clean them as good as
[59:29] they can
[59:30] get us Brothers we don't have to Hitch
[59:33] up the horses and feed them and and
[59:35] clean out the Stalls every morning we
[59:36] just go and turn the key in our car and
[59:37] we can get wherever we're going just so
[59:39] fast and yet we have so little time why
[59:42] Satan is a master of distraction he's a
[59:45] master of absorbing the times and
[59:46] Satan's always trying to come in and
[59:48] magnify situations magnify the problems
[59:50] and he's never wanting us to catch the
[59:52] vision or the purpose or the plan or the
[59:54] promises of God he's trying trying to
[59:56] distract us from these things he's
[59:57] trying to make us forget Who We
[59:59] Are by making the situation and the
[1:00:02] symptoms so great that we think that
[1:00:03] that's what determines the outcome amen
[1:00:07] we have to be seeking the kingdom of God
[1:00:09] first first and everything else Jesus
[1:00:12] said will be added to you that you that
[1:00:13] you have need of not the wants not the
[1:00:17] desires that's his Sovereign will that
[1:00:18] he would give us those or not but your
[1:00:20] needs he says I'll meet them if you'll
[1:00:21] seek the kingdom of God first amen now
[1:00:24] we're in a fight every single day and
[1:00:26] and we're going to see what that battle
[1:00:28] looks like because we have those moments
[1:00:30] of rest amen we have those moments of
[1:00:32] rest but the thing is even if we want to
[1:00:35] be at peace we've got an enemy we've got
[1:00:37] somebody that's always got it out for us
[1:00:40] and sometimes the person that's got it
[1:00:41] out for us is even ourselves sometimes
[1:00:43] we can have rest but we won't let go of
[1:00:45] things we won't lay it down and we
[1:00:47] continue a battle that we don't have to
[1:00:49] fight and that's what's taking away our
[1:00:51] rest so many times is we're fighting a
[1:00:52] battle that's not ours to fight we don't
[1:00:54] even need to be there amen but we do
[1:00:56] have a fight and I want to take us back
[1:00:58] to the Book of Judges this morning and I
[1:01:00] I just so appreciated the services the
[1:01:02] the dedication meetings we had last week
[1:01:04] with brother Jerry and and brother Paul
[1:01:06] and brother Paul kind of finished with
[1:01:07] the thought of a new generation I
[1:01:09] already had these notes I hadn't hadn't
[1:01:11] laid them out yet but I had all the
[1:01:12] thoughts there and he spoke on a new
[1:01:14] generation and I so appreciate that when
[1:01:17] the Holy Spirit works that way because
[1:01:18] the ministry doesn't talk to each other
[1:01:19] and say I'm going to preach on this so
[1:01:21] you can preach on that no that takes the
[1:01:23] Holy Ghost to do that amen and I
[1:01:24] appreciate when God will come down and
[1:01:26] move am men like that but I want to
[1:01:28] refresh our minds before we go to the
[1:01:29] Book of Judges this morning with some
[1:01:31] quotes that we read last year sometime
[1:01:33] and I I just want to set us up for the
[1:01:35] this last topic this last portion of
[1:01:37] this series this morning now he said
[1:01:40] this Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:44] he says Egypt is the world that they
[1:01:45] came out of the Wilderness is where they
[1:01:47] were Sanctified and a called out Church
[1:01:50] Canaan is where they settled down with
[1:01:51] the holy spirit cuz they still have wars
[1:01:54] he says and if you don't don't believe
[1:01:56] you have war wars just get the Holy
[1:01:59] Spirit
[1:01:59] once amen he says what are you doing
[1:02:02] what do you do in Canaan he says they
[1:02:04] were possessing their rights he says
[1:02:07] Glory they were possessing their rights
[1:02:09] and they could not possess their rights
[1:02:12] until they got into
[1:02:14] Canaan he says they didn't know nothing
[1:02:16] in the wilderness the children of Israel
[1:02:18] walked around for 40 years possessing
[1:02:20] nothing God preserved them God gave them
[1:02:22] food God kept their clothing God God
[1:02:25] spared their amilies but they didn't
[1:02:27] have any rights in the desert cuz that
[1:02:29] wasn't the land of promise the land of
[1:02:31] promise for the believer is repent in
[1:02:34] the name of repent and be baptized in
[1:02:36] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:02:37] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:02:40] the gift of the holy spirit that is our
[1:02:42] promise is the holy spirit we repent we
[1:02:46] get baptized he gives us the promise
[1:02:49] amen that's what we need that's what
[1:02:51] we're looking for is the Holy Spirit to
[1:02:53] to seal our souls he says but then when
[1:02:56] they came into Canaan then they had
[1:02:58] rights then they had a word promised
[1:03:00] then they could go back and say Lord
[1:03:02] this is what you said belong to me he
[1:03:05] says and we've got rights when you
[1:03:07] receive the Holy Ghost you're in Canaan
[1:03:09] but he says you have to fight for it
[1:03:12] every inch of ground you have to fight
[1:03:14] for it yes sir so if we're elected
[1:03:18] children of God we're predestinated
[1:03:20] children of God we are ordained children
[1:03:22] of God then there's a promise for us to
[1:03:24] receive the Holy Ghost because that is
[1:03:26] the seal that is the proof of the true
[1:03:28] child of God is that he gives him the
[1:03:30] Holy Ghost only the children of God can
[1:03:32] receive the Holy Ghost because that's
[1:03:34] the nature of the father
[1:03:37] amen you know when we look at at
[1:03:40] children what makes children is that
[1:03:43] they have a part of
[1:03:46] us brother Levi here can't be my child
[1:03:49] because there's none of me in
[1:03:51] him but you know when we look at our
[1:03:53] children it humbles us because they're
[1:03:54] not as perfect as we are and we want to
[1:03:57] say where did that come from guess what
[1:04:00] there's nothing in that child that
[1:04:02] didn't come from you and your
[1:04:05] wife yes you can blame your
[1:04:08] wife but through it all there's a
[1:04:10] portion of you and there's a portion of
[1:04:12] her in there and we've got to Bear the
[1:04:14] responsibility for what's in that child
[1:04:16] that's a part of me the good and the
[1:04:20] bad the beautiful thing with God is that
[1:04:22] it's all good everything he gives you is
[1:04:25] good amen he's the Fountain of Light he
[1:04:27] is life he is truth he is love he is all
[1:04:30] of these things and so when he gives you
[1:04:31] the Holy Ghost he's giving you only the
[1:04:34] good only the good it's a perfect thing
[1:04:36] but here's the thing Satan hates every
[1:04:38] single bit of what God gives you and
[1:04:40] because of that he'll fight you for
[1:04:42] every inch that you try and take every
[1:04:44] promise in the word that you try and
[1:04:46] hold on to every bit of faith that you
[1:04:48] try and apply Satan is there to fight us
[1:04:50] every single day of our life amen he
[1:04:52] hates it and he'll try and hold it or
[1:04:54] he'll try and take it back back from you
[1:04:56] every single day yeah we've spoken at
[1:04:58] length about the promises of God and and
[1:05:00] the land God has given us and it's all
[1:05:02] found in the Holy Ghost when God gives
[1:05:05] you the Holy Ghost there is the
[1:05:06] potential there to fulfill every word of
[1:05:08] God because it's a portion of God Amen
[1:05:12] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:05:13] was with God the Word was God God and
[1:05:15] then he gives us a portion of that word
[1:05:17] it's the life of the word and it's the
[1:05:19] holy spirit amen it's the word that's
[1:05:21] expressed in you and I and it has the
[1:05:23] potential to believe every word to
[1:05:26] accept every word to act on every word
[1:05:29] to receive every word and to hold to
[1:05:31] every word amen it has the ability that
[1:05:33] is what the Holy Ghost is there for is
[1:05:35] to latch on to the word of God and take
[1:05:37] it off the pages of this book and put it
[1:05:39] into my life and make it live in a way
[1:05:41] that I thought it could never do that's
[1:05:43] the miracle of the new birth is that you
[1:05:44] live in a way you've never lived before
[1:05:47] you can't get the Holy Ghost you can't
[1:05:48] have a new birth and walk out and do the
[1:05:50] things that you did before you can't
[1:05:52] walk out with the same desires because
[1:05:54] you're a new creation in Christ the old
[1:05:56] man the old woman has died and you're a
[1:05:58] new creation in
[1:06:00] Christ you know we're we're in this this
[1:06:02] last stage and we're we're not just in
[1:06:05] Canaan now but we've been in Canaan a
[1:06:06] while if you look around it and we can
[1:06:09] see here that the Holy Ghost has moved
[1:06:11] in our elders and they come to a certain
[1:06:14] place and we see it doesn't take a lot
[1:06:17] of God to defeat
[1:06:19] Satan the littlest bit of God will
[1:06:21] defeat anything that Satan has because
[1:06:24] there's infinite power in the Holy hly
[1:06:26] spirit amen and we can look around at
[1:06:28] the older folks in this in this
[1:06:30] congregation and I'm so thankful for
[1:06:31] them because we've seen people that have
[1:06:33] gone into Canaan ahead of us that they
[1:06:35] heard an eagle cry they heard a
[1:06:37] prophet's message and they answered it
[1:06:39] and what happened is God gave them the
[1:06:40] true New Birth God gave them the holy
[1:06:43] ghost in a way that they had never
[1:06:45] received
[1:06:46] before God gave them the fullness of
[1:06:48] what was supposed to be happening amen
[1:06:50] but they didn't just sit back they've
[1:06:52] been through many trials they've been
[1:06:54] through tribulations they've had family
[1:06:56] pull away they've been ostracized
[1:06:57] they've been all these things and we see
[1:07:00] that they didn't sit back on their
[1:07:01] couches they weren't lazy Christians
[1:07:03] okay I got the Holy Ghost I've received
[1:07:05] the the word for my hour now I'm just
[1:07:07] going into Rapture no no they had to
[1:07:09] fight for every step that they took and
[1:07:12] we sit here today and we often don't
[1:07:13] know the battles that they went but if
[1:07:15] you go ask brother Jim if you go ask
[1:07:17] brother Gerald if you go ask brother
[1:07:18] Mark and brother Bob and their spouses
[1:07:20] they'll say we have to fight and we're
[1:07:22] still in a fight why because we've got
[1:07:24] an enemy we've got not an enemy that's
[1:07:26] trying to hold us back amen we're born
[1:07:28] to fight and we're born to win you
[1:07:31] cannot overcome unless you go through a
[1:07:33] battle and come out on the victory side
[1:07:35] you cannot do it you've got to go
[1:07:36] through a battle to overcome and
[1:07:38] remember in each of the seven Church
[1:07:39] ages the promise is only to the
[1:07:42] Overcomer to those that overcome that
[1:07:44] means you got to be you've got to have a
[1:07:45] battle and you've got to have a victory
[1:07:47] in that battle amen amen we're born to
[1:07:50] overcome now listen to this he says
[1:07:52] that's what's the matter with people
[1:07:53] tonight in Divine Healing and everything
[1:07:56] it's yours go take it Hallelujah God
[1:07:58] said I'll give it to you it's yours he
[1:08:01] says now it wouldn't be right for God to
[1:08:03] go and Dish all the things out he gave
[1:08:05] them the land they've got to do the
[1:08:08] house cleaning amen God left a portion
[1:08:11] for us to do but remember what he said
[1:08:13] he says I will send my spirit before you
[1:08:15] I will go before you I'll put fear into
[1:08:18] the hearts of your
[1:08:19] enemies when fear enters the enem is
[1:08:22] defeated church when fear enters the
[1:08:25] enemy is defeated because they've lost
[1:08:27] confidence in who they are and their
[1:08:29] ability to withstand what's coming their
[1:08:31] way he says I'm going to go put the fear
[1:08:33] of God in them so that when you come
[1:08:34] they'll fall by the
[1:08:36] wayside
[1:08:38] amen he says it's yours but he ain't
[1:08:41] going to come poke it down your neck
[1:08:43] you've got to take the land yourself
[1:08:45] he's given it to you and it's yours rise
[1:08:47] and possess it Hallelujah he says it's
[1:08:50] your choice oh you're telling me brother
[1:08:54] John that it's AO Choice as to how much
[1:08:56] of God's promises I can have
[1:08:58] absolutely remember what the prophet God
[1:09:00] said he says footsteps is
[1:09:03] possession not verbal steps footsteps
[1:09:07] you got to put your life where your
[1:09:09] mouth
[1:09:10] says and me you got to walk the
[1:09:13] talk he says it's given to you and it's
[1:09:15] yours rise and possess it it's your
[1:09:17] choice if you want to murmur like the
[1:09:18] other 10 spies did you'll wander in the
[1:09:20] wilderness a long time longer till
[1:09:22] tomorrow night you're still sick but if
[1:09:24] you're ready to take it tonight it's
[1:09:26] yours he says what kind of a choice are
[1:09:28] you going to make I will take Jesus and
[1:09:30] his promise and tell the Devil he's a
[1:09:33] liar amen so everything we have
[1:09:36] everything that's ours every portion of
[1:09:38] our inheritance in this word of God
[1:09:41] there's going to be a fight for it
[1:09:43] there's going to be a fight it's ours
[1:09:45] you know what I love about this word it
[1:09:46] tells us we're facing a defeated enemy
[1:09:49] Christ conquered everything death hell
[1:09:52] and the grave and every demonic and and
[1:09:54] sickness every Power he defeated it at
[1:09:57] Calvary it's a defeated enemy this
[1:10:00] morning so he says Rise and possess your
[1:10:02] inheritance man Satan's encamped on it
[1:10:05] Satan's camped out on the word of God
[1:10:08] and he's sitting there and he's trying
[1:10:09] to build this big hedge he's trying to
[1:10:10] build this big tower this big castle
[1:10:12] this big fortress with lots of
[1:10:14] guns to make you think that it belongs
[1:10:17] to
[1:10:19] him but we've got to
[1:10:21] say it's
[1:10:24] mine now not just it's hers or it's his
[1:10:27] it's mine we always have faith for
[1:10:29] everyone else I say Lord help my faith
[1:10:32] to arise for my life and my situation as
[1:10:34] well amen Satan's doing everything he
[1:10:37] can to make you think that he's stronger
[1:10:38] than you are let me tell you something
[1:10:41] he is stronger than
[1:10:44] you but I'm not resting on
[1:10:47] me me
[1:10:50] died there's a new creation now and this
[1:10:53] one is unlimited by the power of the
[1:10:55] word of
[1:10:56] God
[1:10:58] Amen that's the thing I love about this
[1:11:01] new generation is they're still call to
[1:11:03] Victory the same as the
[1:11:05] original there is no difference in call
[1:11:07] there is no difference in power there is
[1:11:09] no difference in anointing every
[1:11:11] generation is called to overcome amen
[1:11:15] now here's the thing we went they went
[1:11:16] and they did their part the first
[1:11:18] generation came into Canan and and and
[1:11:20] they went in and they destroyed and they
[1:11:22] they they they took the cities and they
[1:11:24] won their battles and they had the signs
[1:11:26] and the Wonders and the Miracles and all
[1:11:28] these different things and we see that
[1:11:29] witness today in our midst and I say
[1:11:31] praise the Lord for that but they did
[1:11:34] not have a complete and total Victory
[1:11:36] you'll see but there's a purpose behind
[1:11:39] that because there's a generation that
[1:11:41] comes after the new generation there's a
[1:11:43] new new generation that comes the second
[1:11:45] generation comes behind the first and
[1:11:47] there's a particular work because God's
[1:11:49] got to bring them to the place where
[1:11:51] they know what it means to fight and get
[1:11:54] Victory God not this isn't the
[1:11:56] Millennium you got to know how to stay
[1:11:59] close to God Amen that's what's got to
[1:12:01] happen so if we look in Judges 3 in
[1:12:03] verse one it says now these are the
[1:12:04] Nations which the Lord left in other
[1:12:07] words he left some people in Canaan that
[1:12:09] were not serving God he left enemies in
[1:12:11] the land he says to prove Israel by them
[1:12:15] even as many of Israel as had not known
[1:12:17] all the wars of Canaan in other words
[1:12:19] he's proving Israel because there were a
[1:12:21] there was a generation that didn't face
[1:12:23] War they just came into a land of milk
[1:12:26] and honey a land of everything provided
[1:12:29] and they didn't know what it meant to
[1:12:30] fight for it he says only that the
[1:12:33] generations of of the children of Israel
[1:12:35] might know to teach them War at the
[1:12:38] least such as knew not but knew nothing
[1:12:40] thereof now catch this thought so God's
[1:12:43] left these enemies alive in Canaan the
[1:12:45] first generation didn't kill them all
[1:12:47] and so there's something left for the
[1:12:49] second generation of those original
[1:12:52] enemies why he says to prove Israel
[1:12:56] if you look at that word prove it means
[1:12:57] to test and try remember what the tutor
[1:13:01] was for the son the son that was PL the
[1:13:04] son had a tutor placed over him Jesus
[1:13:06] talked about it and and Paul talked
[1:13:08] about it where they they have a tutor
[1:13:10] that was placed over the son to educate
[1:13:12] him and train him and prepare him to go
[1:13:14] about the father's
[1:13:16] business and it's the same word there
[1:13:19] that we use for adoption which is the
[1:13:20] testing and trying of a child to prepare
[1:13:23] them to inherit
[1:13:25] so this work this this battle that
[1:13:27] they're facing is going to prepare them
[1:13:29] to come into adoption to prepare them to
[1:13:31] step into the purpose of God for their
[1:13:34] lives it says there in verse in the
[1:13:36] verse it says it was intended for the
[1:13:38] people that had not known all the wars
[1:13:39] of Canaan and other words it was for
[1:13:41] people that had inherited peace that had
[1:13:44] inherited lands that had inherited
[1:13:46] kingdoms that had inherited all the good
[1:13:48] things of God but didn't have to fight
[1:13:51] for them and this morning we see a
[1:13:54] generation May maybe two generations in
[1:13:56] a way sitting here this morning and what
[1:13:58] we've got is we've got the elders that
[1:13:59] have heard the call come out of her my
[1:14:01] people and that was a
[1:14:04] revelation and it took
[1:14:06] courage and it took
[1:14:09] commitment it took a personal revelation
[1:14:12] of the word that they were hearing but
[1:14:15] see now we're born into it I'm born into
[1:14:18] a family that is has accepted this full
[1:14:21] word I don't have to make that decision
[1:14:23] in a way that they did I have to make a
[1:14:25] personal decision but it's not in the
[1:14:28] way that they did I'm born into it I
[1:14:31] inherit their hard work their battles
[1:14:33] that they fought but see God comes
[1:14:35] behind he says that ain't going to work
[1:14:38] that ain't going to work inherited
[1:14:40] religion will not work you cannot do
[1:14:43] that you have to be born into the
[1:14:45] kingdom of God you do not inherit it
[1:14:48] you're born into it and then you inherit
[1:14:50] it by your new birth
[1:14:51] amen amen sons that if you look around
[1:14:54] this world today and it's been for all
[1:14:57] history you don't have to look today I
[1:14:59] guess but
[1:15:00] every almost without fail every
[1:15:04] generation that inherits a business or
[1:15:06] an opportunity from their parents starts
[1:15:09] to run it into the ground and by the
[1:15:11] second generation after their parents
[1:15:12] they've lost it all why because they
[1:15:15] don't have any they don't value it the
[1:15:17] same way there's no blood there's no
[1:15:19] sweat there's no tears into it and so
[1:15:21] they just take it and they use it and
[1:15:23] use it and use it and they run it into
[1:15:24] the ground
[1:15:25] it's the same thing with the with the
[1:15:27] promises of God we can take these things
[1:15:29] for granted and we start to go around
[1:15:31] presuming that we have something and we
[1:15:32] don't have it and in the end we lose
[1:15:35] what's all there but catch this second
[1:15:37] verse because it's where my inspiration
[1:15:39] came from for this series amen that the
[1:15:41] purpose of leaving those enemies alive
[1:15:43] was to teach them to war who didn't know
[1:15:45] anything about war amen we've got to
[1:15:48] learn to fight we cannot sit under Mom
[1:15:50] and Dad's roof and say I've got Victory
[1:15:53] because of mom and dad we've got to
[1:15:54] learn to get Victory ourselves amen
[1:15:56] we've got to learn to battle ourselves
[1:15:58] and that's what this is about the the
[1:15:59] whole culmination of this series now is
[1:16:02] brother brothers and sisters how do we
[1:16:04] take how do we take a hold of what God
[1:16:06] has given us how do we put into action
[1:16:09] what we've heard how do we keep what
[1:16:11] we've got and how do we go get what we
[1:16:13] haven't received yet this is where the
[1:16:15] rubber meets the road this is this is
[1:16:17] this is going to be good Homestyle
[1:16:19] Cooking if we're going to put it amen
[1:16:20] and that means that every single one of
[1:16:22] us is going to be in a battle if you're
[1:16:24] a child of God God you're going to be in
[1:16:25] a battle no matter what because God will
[1:16:27] bring things into your life to make you
[1:16:29] learn how to fight to stand with the
[1:16:31] word of God Amen why because we've got
[1:16:33] an enemy no matter what like I said we
[1:16:35] can sit here and say I don't want
[1:16:36] anything to do with anyone just leave me
[1:16:39] alone Satan Satan won't leave you alone
[1:16:41] cuz he's your enemy and enemies fight
[1:16:43] and they poke and they do all these
[1:16:44] different things he's not going to let
[1:16:45] us alone unless we destroy
[1:16:47] him he says this every Christian fights
[1:16:50] a battle every day we're in a Warfare
[1:16:55] right now going on constantly within us
[1:16:57] between right and wrong shall we receive
[1:16:59] it what shall we do shall we bow to the
[1:17:02] world shall we give up this thought that
[1:17:03] we've got and if we see it and focus it
[1:17:07] take it from Genesis to
[1:17:10] Revelation what do we have today people
[1:17:12] that are cherry pick in their
[1:17:14] Bible take it from Genesis to Revelation
[1:17:17] if it doesn't go all the way through
[1:17:19] it's
[1:17:20] wrong he says she is thus sayeth the
[1:17:23] Lord each time write on down through
[1:17:25] there we can't give it up we can't
[1:17:27] compromise with the rest of them we just
[1:17:28] can't do it we've got to stay here where
[1:17:31] with the word that's all no matter how
[1:17:33] great the enemy is how many much
[1:17:35] Machinery he's got against us how many
[1:17:37] organizations and how many of this that
[1:17:39] or the other we yet we have pulled this
[1:17:41] focus of God's word till we find that
[1:17:44] there's one thing and that's the blood
[1:17:46] of Jesus Christ remember the The Book of
[1:17:49] Revelation says they overcame by the
[1:17:51] blood of the Lamb first and foremost we
[1:17:54] never stray to too far from
[1:17:57] Calvary while we're in this flesh we
[1:18:00] never stray too far from Calvary because
[1:18:02] we need to keep our lives under that
[1:18:03] blood every single
[1:18:06] day amen it says and that's the blood of
[1:18:08] Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday
[1:18:10] today and forever amen therefore don't
[1:18:14] make any difference what anyone else
[1:18:15] says they say the days of Miracles will
[1:18:17] pass there's no such thing is Divine
[1:18:19] Healing there's no baptism of the Holy
[1:18:21] Ghost and baptism of the name of Jesus
[1:18:23] Christ that was for the disciple only
[1:18:25] and all these things they try to focus
[1:18:27] off of it but still it focuses right
[1:18:30] back to the word and nobody can say it's
[1:18:32] not there he says that's right so we're
[1:18:34] in a Warfare what to stay with the word
[1:18:37] of God he says and God's Heroes Have
[1:18:41] Always had
[1:18:44] Warfare you know what we call everyday
[1:18:47] living that's what God calls
[1:18:50] Warfare and the fruit of Our Lives the
[1:18:53] results of Our Lives is the result of
[1:18:55] warfare where we've
[1:18:57] won amen when we see the good things of
[1:18:59] God and by good things of God I don't
[1:19:01] mean money in the bank and a house over
[1:19:02] our roof when I see the word of God
[1:19:05] coming out of our life the fruit of the
[1:19:07] spirit coming out of our life that's the
[1:19:09] result of Victories W you know we we see
[1:19:12] so many people and and we talk to people
[1:19:15] and they're in their denominations and
[1:19:17] we're not a denomination we're in an
[1:19:18] independent group we are under no
[1:19:20] headship except the holy spirit amen we
[1:19:23] preach only from the scriptures
[1:19:26] but people will come in under those
[1:19:28] Creeds and under those those things and
[1:19:30] they'll come in and they'll say we like
[1:19:31] what the results
[1:19:33] are but we can't come to the belief that
[1:19:36] you have and they said the same thing
[1:19:38] about Jesus they said the same thing
[1:19:39] about his disciples and it's ever been
[1:19:42] that way why because they're Bound by
[1:19:44] something and it takes God to open their
[1:19:47] eyes that they could ever see beyond
[1:19:49] that and it's God's grace that we can
[1:19:51] see it this morning amen Beyond these
[1:19:53] things they'll say don't I just can't
[1:19:55] believe like you do but I love the
[1:19:57] results and what happens is they're
[1:19:59] losing their young people they're using
[1:20:01] their Holiness they're losing their
[1:20:03] commitment they're losing the victory
[1:20:06] they're losing their
[1:20:07] Joy but they just can't seem to come
[1:20:09] around to believing it the way we
[1:20:12] do man what's the problem they're under
[1:20:15] a system where Satan is the
[1:20:18] head remember what it says in Revelation
[1:20:21] it talks about the Harlot the that
[1:20:23] sits on Seven Hills and that's the Roman
[1:20:25] Catholic
[1:20:26] church but then she's got
[1:20:29] daughters and it's every organization
[1:20:31] that came out of it had the same problem
[1:20:33] they put it under the headship of men
[1:20:35] instead of the Holy Ghost like it was on
[1:20:36] the day of Pentecost there was never an
[1:20:39] organization in scripture never ever
[1:20:41] ever it was men led by the Holy Spirit
[1:20:44] to go and move and act and women too
[1:20:47] amen that's the way the church is
[1:20:48] supposed to be
[1:20:51] amen hey those people still have battles
[1:20:54] cuz they stand on a portion of the word
[1:20:56] but here's the thing partial stands give
[1:20:58] you partial results and the thing is
[1:21:01] we're in this for life and there's no
[1:21:03] such thing as half alive you're either
[1:21:05] dead or you're alive you're either cold
[1:21:09] or you're hot and remember lukewarm is
[1:21:12] death in Revelation 3 it says you're
[1:21:15] lukewarm and I'll spit you out of my
[1:21:17] mouth because you won't go all the way
[1:21:20] you're standing on the fence you won't
[1:21:22] commit everything you've got to it amen
[1:21:25] let me bring you some scriptures and one
[1:21:27] more quote before we move forward in
[1:21:28] this thought that God has allowed things
[1:21:30] in our lives to train us to fight to
[1:21:32] train us to go to war to train us how to
[1:21:34] deal with life anden he's got a purpose
[1:21:37] in these things and I I want to start
[1:21:38] with maybe the first thing we learn as a
[1:21:40] Christian because it's a part of the new
[1:21:42] birth but it's something that's ongoing
[1:21:44] every day in our life and it's to lay
[1:21:46] aside anything that hinders you it's to
[1:21:49] lay things down amen that's really what
[1:21:51] repentance is when you think about it
[1:21:53] repentance is to walk away to turn away
[1:21:55] and go in the other direction from
[1:21:57] something that's holding you back in
[1:21:58] your walk with God because it's wrong
[1:22:01] but here's the thing not everything is
[1:22:03] wrong sometimes it's wrong for me and
[1:22:04] it's not wrong for you and I've got to
[1:22:07] be able to walk away from it because
[1:22:08] it's hindering me but you can walk with
[1:22:10] God and have that thing because it
[1:22:11] doesn't hinder you it doesn't have
[1:22:13] strength it doesn't have power over you
[1:22:14] you don't have a weakness like I have
[1:22:16] and remember we've got to be able to lay
[1:22:18] these things down and you know what
[1:22:20] happens is times get tough money gets
[1:22:22] tight Health starts to drop away
[1:22:24] marriages get strained and that's when
[1:22:26] we start to really start checking up
[1:22:27] isn't it and say Lord I need an answer
[1:22:29] Lord I need direction Lord I need
[1:22:31] provision Lord I need healing and what
[1:22:33] do we do we start checking our
[1:22:35] time because like you said Satan is the
[1:22:37] great distractor and he fills our time
[1:22:40] with everything except the word of God
[1:22:42] that's where I fail so much of the time
[1:22:45] amen accounting for my
[1:22:47] time why cuz sometimes I haven't laid
[1:22:50] down those things that I need to lay
[1:22:52] down you know I saw someone's phone the
[1:22:54] other today and you know we all have a a
[1:22:56] screen on the front and that person's
[1:22:58] phone said do you need to be on your
[1:23:02] phone I thought praise the Lord somebody
[1:23:05] got a
[1:23:08] revelation do I need to be on my
[1:23:10] phone I guarantee you for 95% of us the
[1:23:13] problems we're facing come from that
[1:23:15] phone not against phones we need them
[1:23:19] but I'll tell you 95% of what you're
[1:23:20] dealing with is probably coming right
[1:23:22] through that device why because we're
[1:23:24] letting it do things that we ought not
[1:23:25] to let it do in our lives amen I just
[1:23:29] love that it's a great question do I
[1:23:32] really need this do I really need to do
[1:23:34] this is this really going to help me
[1:23:36] today is this going to help anyone
[1:23:40] today forget about me is it going to
[1:23:42] help anyone and usually the answer is
[1:23:44] 100% absolutely not amen that was for
[1:23:48] free this morning you I read this in
[1:23:50] devotions on Friday and it struck me so
[1:23:52] much as a challenge but as a reminder as
[1:23:54] well because we're in a battle and
[1:23:56] really the battle starts in here the
[1:23:58] battle is internal before it's ever
[1:24:00] external anden you win the internal
[1:24:02] battle the external battle has no effect
[1:24:04] on you it's an internal battle from
[1:24:06] start to finish and I was reading in
[1:24:07] Galatians 5 and it said this Paul said
[1:24:10] this I say then walk in the spirit and
[1:24:13] you shall not fulfill the lust of the
[1:24:15] flesh anyone else fighting the lust of
[1:24:17] the flesh
[1:24:18] occasionally seven of
[1:24:20] us 14 15 seven there we go
[1:24:25] we fight this every single day and it's
[1:24:27] so annoying isn't it drives me
[1:24:30] nuts that it wants to do things that I
[1:24:34] have told it time and time again don't
[1:24:36] do
[1:24:37] that but the body wants what the body
[1:24:40] wants
[1:24:42] amen people that preach you get the Holy
[1:24:45] Ghost that'll go away no the desire in
[1:24:47] your heart will be purified but this
[1:24:50] flesh it's in a battle every single day
[1:24:53] with what's inside of your Soul
[1:24:57] amen Paul said there's a weapon to
[1:24:59] defeat that flesh and he says it's walk
[1:25:02] in the spirit in other words take what
[1:25:05] you believe and put it into
[1:25:08] action start acting on the word instead
[1:25:10] of just talking about the
[1:25:12] word why he says for the flesh lusteth
[1:25:15] against the spirit and the spirit
[1:25:18] against the Flesh and these are contrary
[1:25:20] that the one to the other so that you
[1:25:22] cannot do the things that you would
[1:25:26] there's the battle the flesh the Fallen
[1:25:30] portion of this
[1:25:32] body it's fighting against the Holy
[1:25:35] Spirit that's inside of you that's why
[1:25:37] we need the holy spirit so that there's
[1:25:39] a battle in the first place because
[1:25:41] without the holy spirit in there there
[1:25:42] is no battle you've just got your carnal
[1:25:45] nature inside I mean you got your carnal
[1:25:47] spirit inside of you but there's a
[1:25:50] battle every day and it's a battle of
[1:25:51] your flesh and it's the battle between
[1:25:53] this carnality and then the Holy Spirit
[1:25:55] which is supposed to be in control but
[1:25:57] there's a battle every day as to which
[1:25:58] one's going to actually have it because
[1:26:00] the Holy Ghost is pointing you to the
[1:26:02] word of God and your carnality is this
[1:26:04] flesh is pointing you to what you think
[1:26:06] what you feel what you know what's
[1:26:10] reasonable all of these different things
[1:26:11] and the Holy Ghost is screaming out stay
[1:26:13] with the word of God stay with the word
[1:26:15] of God stay with the word of God stay
[1:26:17] with the word of God Amen if nothing
[1:26:20] else you'll face that battle between
[1:26:22] your mind and your flesh every single
[1:26:23] day your soul and your flesh every
[1:26:25] single day but Paul continues a little
[1:26:27] further down here in verse 24 he tells
[1:26:29] us how to win he says and they that are
[1:26:31] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[1:26:35] affections and
[1:26:36] lusts in other words what is
[1:26:39] crucifixion it
[1:26:41] pins it doesn't allow it to
[1:26:44] move it says you're not going
[1:26:47] anywhere I'm in control the holy
[1:26:49] spirit's in control you're not allowed
[1:26:51] to go anywhere and it's dying daily to
[1:26:53] this
[1:26:55] flesh the more you deprive it the weaker
[1:26:58] it
[1:26:59] gets amen I've said it plainly over this
[1:27:02] Pulpit as a young man I've dealt with
[1:27:04] pornography I've dealt with lust I've
[1:27:06] dealt with pride I've dealt with fear
[1:27:07] all of these different things listen
[1:27:09] there's a holy ghost that can deliver
[1:27:10] you from every single one of those
[1:27:12] things but we've got to what crucify it
[1:27:15] we've got to hold ourselves accountable
[1:27:17] to the word of God and say Lord the
[1:27:19] desire is not there and I want Victory
[1:27:21] and God will give you the victory but
[1:27:23] you've got to walk according to your
[1:27:25] desire which is Lord I don't want it
[1:27:27] anymore and how do you do that you
[1:27:28] crucify it you keep it pinned you keep
[1:27:30] it tied down you keep it where it has no
[1:27:32] control and you say you're not getting
[1:27:34] out today you're not getting out today
[1:27:36] you're not getting out
[1:27:39] today he says if we live in the spirit
[1:27:43] let us walk in the spirit that was my
[1:27:45] challenge he says if we say we've got
[1:27:48] the Holy Ghost then let's start acting
[1:27:49] like
[1:27:50] it every single day if we say we've got
[1:27:54] it then how about we start living a life
[1:27:56] and I'm not saying we don't but I'm
[1:27:58] saying let's live more of a life anden
[1:28:00] let's come up a little higher a little
[1:28:01] step precept upon precept line upon line
[1:28:04] word upon word let's do a little more
[1:28:06] today than we did yesterday that's all
[1:28:08] we're saying I loved how brother Jerry
[1:28:10] brought it out he says we have faith but
[1:28:12] how about
[1:28:13] trust that was so beautiful if there was
[1:28:16] anything I got it was that if we have
[1:28:18] faith then where's our trust because if
[1:28:20] we say we have faith then we'll put our
[1:28:22] lives on the line behind the word of God
[1:28:25] remember what James said Works without
[1:28:27] faith is dead or faith without works
[1:28:29] rather is dead you say you got faith and
[1:28:31] you don't put it into action in your
[1:28:32] life you don't have faith except
[1:28:33] intellectual faith and that is the
[1:28:35] weakest of all faiths and it has nothing
[1:28:38] Supernatural about
[1:28:40] it why because a testimony spoken but
[1:28:43] not lived there's no
[1:28:45] testimony that's literally a
[1:28:48] hypocrite but if we put it into action
[1:28:50] then now what happens is the holy spirit
[1:28:52] comes behind that word to Empower it and
[1:28:54] make it live inside of our Lives
[1:28:57] amen listen to this he says God has got
[1:29:00] Amazing Grace to save you and he will do
[1:29:03] it but you'll fight every inch of your
[1:29:08] way and here's the thing that I'm
[1:29:10] fighting most of the time is me I've
[1:29:12] talked about it before how even when I
[1:29:14] was 10 years old I felt a called to give
[1:29:16] my heart to the Lord but I did not give
[1:29:18] it until I was 17 years old why because
[1:29:20] me wanted a good life me wanted to be a
[1:29:23] doctor me wanted to have lots of money
[1:29:25] me wanted a portion 911
[1:29:31] Turbo me wasn't sure he was going to
[1:29:34] enjoy being a
[1:29:37] Christian the battle was with
[1:29:40] me and Satan was just putting up barrier
[1:29:43] after barrier after barrier and I'd sit
[1:29:45] through service after service and that
[1:29:47] call would be to for me to come up and
[1:29:49] give my life to the Lord and I'd shut it
[1:29:51] down every single time every single time
[1:29:53] every single time until he called my
[1:29:55] name and he made it so specific and so
[1:29:58] personal to me and my life and my plans
[1:30:00] and intentions and goals that I had to
[1:30:02] say he's here because he discerned the
[1:30:05] thoughts and the intents of my heart and
[1:30:07] I said that's
[1:30:09] me yeah I talked to brother Barry about
[1:30:11] that because he was the one that was
[1:30:13] ministering at that that that that set
[1:30:15] of meetings him and brother Donnie
[1:30:16] Reagan and and I said do you remember me
[1:30:19] talking to you after that service
[1:30:21] because I said you went through and you
[1:30:22] pinned down every every single thing
[1:30:25] that I had plans to do and you said you
[1:30:27] think you're going to do this but you're
[1:30:28] not you think you're going to do this
[1:30:30] but you're not and he hit the three
[1:30:31] things that I had plans to
[1:30:33] do that made no sense to anybody else
[1:30:36] and he looked at me with a blank stare
[1:30:37] and he didn't remember even saying
[1:30:39] it why because it wasn't him saying it
[1:30:41] it was the spirit of God in the building
[1:30:43] that was saying it amen that's what we
[1:30:47] believe we don't believe that a man just
[1:30:49] goes into a room and he opens his Bible
[1:30:51] and he picks a topic we believe that the
[1:30:54] holy spirit is using men to preach to
[1:30:57] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[1:30:58] heart to go into lives and say things
[1:31:00] about which they know nothing that's the
[1:31:03] power of the god that we believe in this
[1:31:04] morning here
[1:31:06] amen he says he's got Amazing Grace to
[1:31:09] save you and he will do it but you'll
[1:31:10] fight every inch of your way I've been
[1:31:12] behind the pulpit going on 31 years and
[1:31:14] every inch of that's been a fight
[1:31:16] constantly it certainly has but if we
[1:31:18] must fight but we must fight if we must
[1:31:20] Reign so we find out that the bride has
[1:31:23] to make make herself ready be willing to
[1:31:26] lay aside every weight that does so
[1:31:29] easily beset us that we might run with
[1:31:31] patience the race that sets before us he
[1:31:34] says we must lay them aside this comes
[1:31:36] back to what I was saying earlier what
[1:31:38] is the first lesson we have to learn lay
[1:31:40] it down we must lay them aside
[1:31:44] [Applause]
[1:31:46] ourself there's personal choice here we
[1:31:50] cannot say God you come and lay them
[1:31:52] aside for us we have to do that
[1:31:56] ourselves amen and how does that come we
[1:31:58] look at the word and we say the word
[1:32:00] says do this and I'm not doing it or the
[1:32:02] word says don't do it and we are doing
[1:32:04] it and that takes honesty and integrity
[1:32:07] of heart to do that especially for the
[1:32:09] mature believer and then we say Lord you
[1:32:12] see it I don't want
[1:32:15] it or you say Lord I don't see it but I
[1:32:18] want it and that's when he can make the
[1:32:21] move but you've got to be willing to lay
[1:32:22] it down you you got to be willing to lay
[1:32:24] it aside you've got to be willing to
[1:32:26] make that
[1:32:28] sacrifice whether it's for Comfort
[1:32:30] whether it's for ease of life whether
[1:32:31] for it's for acceptance whatever it
[1:32:33] might be you've got to be able to take
[1:32:35] your way with God's chosen few and guess
[1:32:38] what they are scorned and turned away by
[1:32:41] almost everybody it's only a few that
[1:32:43] can do
[1:32:45] it he says we must lay them aside
[1:32:48] ourselves if I would ask you today
[1:32:50] what's the first thing you automatically
[1:32:51] do when you have free time
[1:32:55] I would say that's probably the one
[1:32:56] thing that's hindering you the
[1:32:58] most and it's an easy
[1:33:01] answer it's an easy answer some of us
[1:33:04] pick up a book some of us pick up a
[1:33:06] phone some of us pick up a basketball
[1:33:08] some of us pick up a hockey
[1:33:11] stick and I guarantee you the first
[1:33:13] thing we pick up is probably the thing
[1:33:15] that's hindering us the most in our
[1:33:18] walk he says we must lay them aside
[1:33:22] ourselves that's a personal intentional
[1:33:26] conscious Choice
[1:33:30] amen we do it every single
[1:33:33] day now before we go too
[1:33:36] deep into this thought on teach My Hands
[1:33:39] to War I want to look at what the war is
[1:33:40] because otherwise we end up fighting a
[1:33:42] battle that's not
[1:33:43] ours so many people are fighting battles
[1:33:45] today and I think the worst thing that
[1:33:47] Christians are doing these days are
[1:33:48] fighting political
[1:33:50] battles you know we look and we get so
[1:33:52] caught up in American politics and then
[1:33:53] we get into Canadian politics we start
[1:33:55] fighting Politics as Christians and
[1:33:57] Jesus said this Kingdom my servants are
[1:33:58] not of this world we're not of this
[1:34:01] Kingdom we don't fight for this we're
[1:34:03] seeking a city whose Builder and maker
[1:34:05] is God we're pilgrims and strangers here
[1:34:08] we're here for Souls we're not here for
[1:34:10] power we're not here to take over the
[1:34:11] country we're not here to make things
[1:34:13] right that happens in the new in the new
[1:34:15] word new Earth new Heaven and a new
[1:34:18] Earth that's when everything comes right
[1:34:20] the Millennium We Rule and Reign for a
[1:34:21] thousand years but even then
[1:34:22] everything's not perfect
[1:34:24] in the sense cuz it's all got to be
[1:34:26] destroyed and renewed again amen but so
[1:34:29] many times what happens is we're Bound
[1:34:30] by our own thinking we're Bound by our
[1:34:32] own preferences our own ideas and what
[1:34:34] happens is we turn it into a battle of
[1:34:36] wills and guess what Satan's got way
[1:34:38] more will than I've
[1:34:40] got he'll break me every single time if
[1:34:42] I'm fighting a battle of my own
[1:34:44] choosing but Paul said
[1:34:47] this Paul declared what the battle was
[1:34:49] he says for though we walk in the flesh
[1:34:52] we do not war after the flesh in other
[1:34:54] words the battle we fight is not Earthly
[1:34:57] it is not natural and it is not
[1:34:59] something you can win using this or
[1:35:02] using this it's not going to work he
[1:35:05] says for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:35:07] not carnal they're not natural they're
[1:35:08] not fleshly but Mighty through God to
[1:35:11] the pulling down of strongholds can I
[1:35:13] start here and say this don't worry if
[1:35:15] you got
[1:35:16] strongholds worry if you won't let God
[1:35:18] break them down we've all got
[1:35:21] strongholds we've all had strongholds
[1:35:23] we're all going to have strongholds
[1:35:24] where Satan has gotten into our lives in
[1:35:26] some form or fashion we've either
[1:35:28] allowed him or we've got a natural
[1:35:29] disposition to it whatever it might be
[1:35:32] that's not the problem the problem is
[1:35:33] will we let the word have an effect in
[1:35:35] our lives will we let the Holy Spirit do
[1:35:37] what it's supposed to do in our lives
[1:35:38] and clean up our lives in these things
[1:35:40] amen the problem is so often we'll hide
[1:35:43] behind those
[1:35:44] strongholds we'll hide behind those
[1:35:47] weaknesses and will use them as an
[1:35:49] excuse for not doing
[1:35:52] anything or
[1:35:55] we can be an overcomer and say Lord I'm
[1:35:58] calling you on the scene
[1:36:01] amen I want you to notice what the root
[1:36:03] of these strongholds is for so many and
[1:36:05] we're going to cover a Ser we're going
[1:36:06] to I've got a whole service I want to do
[1:36:08] on just this thought right here but not
[1:36:10] so much today but I want you to see
[1:36:12] where the stronghold is he says casting
[1:36:15] down
[1:36:19] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:36:21] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[1:36:23] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:36:25] thought to The Obedience of Christ what
[1:36:27] was Christ obedient to the word he was
[1:36:30] the word made
[1:36:31] flesh everything he did was by the word
[1:36:35] so that's the thing we have to do is
[1:36:37] bring every imagination every High thing
[1:36:40] every thought to the word bring it into
[1:36:44] captivity to the word
[1:36:47] amen it's a mind
[1:36:49] battle see where it is the weapons of
[1:36:52] our Warfare are not caral but the
[1:36:54] Battleground is the mind cuz he says
[1:36:55] it's imagination it's things that exalt
[1:36:58] itself against
[1:36:59] knowledge and it's every thought so
[1:37:02] that's where the Battleground is is in
[1:37:04] the mind amen if we go into Romans 8 it
[1:37:06] says this for they that are after The
[1:37:08] Flesh do mind the things of the Flesh in
[1:37:10] other words if you live according to
[1:37:11] this natural way of living then that's
[1:37:13] what you're going to
[1:37:14] get he says but they that are after the
[1:37:17] spirit they mind the things of the
[1:37:20] spirit so if you're born again you're
[1:37:21] going to have a different Focus than you
[1:37:23] did before before you were born
[1:37:24] again he says for to be carnally what
[1:37:29] minded the battles in the mind to be
[1:37:31] carnally minded is death but to be
[1:37:34] spiritually minded is life and peace so
[1:37:36] you can be minded two ways you can be
[1:37:38] fleshly and carnal or you can be
[1:37:40] spiritual carnal means that you are what
[1:37:43] dead it only leads to
[1:37:47] death and then there's another way he
[1:37:49] says you can be spiritual and it'll lead
[1:37:50] you into life and peace anybody wants
[1:37:54] some life and peace this morning you got
[1:37:55] to change your mindedness amen you got
[1:37:58] to change the way that you're thinking
[1:37:59] the change change the way that you're
[1:38:00] looking at things one brings
[1:38:03] death one brings life and peace he says
[1:38:07] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:38:09] against God it is always contrary to God
[1:38:13] it is always fighting God it is always
[1:38:16] refusing to take the word of God
[1:38:19] always the full word because remember
[1:38:22] when when Eve was in the the Garden of
[1:38:24] Eden she only got it wrong by one word
[1:38:27] but it completely changed the meaning of
[1:38:29] that word and by it all Humanity fell
[1:38:32] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:38:34] against God it's contrary to God for it
[1:38:37] is not subject to the law of God neither
[1:38:39] indeed can be he says now I believe that
[1:38:41] the greatest battle that was ever fought
[1:38:43] is now ready to go into action and I
[1:38:46] believe that God has been selecting his
[1:38:48] soldiers I believe he's been dressing
[1:38:50] them and training them and the
[1:38:51] Battlefront is now set getting ready to
[1:38:53] start amen are you ready this
[1:38:56] evening this afternoon he says there has
[1:38:58] to be a place
[1:38:59] selected if you're going to fight
[1:39:01] there's got to be a Battleground he says
[1:39:03] and in this there's a mutual ground in
[1:39:05] no man's land and they fight here at
[1:39:06] this place they don't just one fight
[1:39:08] over here and one down here and one run
[1:39:10] over here there's a Battlefront where
[1:39:12] they meet and test their powers where
[1:39:14] each Army tests its strength against the
[1:39:16] other Army a mutual meeting place he
[1:39:19] says now don't miss this when this great
[1:39:21] battle started on Earth there had to be
[1:39:23] a mutual meeting place there had to be a
[1:39:26] place selected for the battle to begin
[1:39:28] and for the battle to rage and that
[1:39:30] Battle Ground began in the human mind
[1:39:34] there is where the battle starts the
[1:39:35] human mind was chosen for the place of
[1:39:38] the battle where it began and that is
[1:39:40] because decisions are made from the mind
[1:39:43] the head now they never started it from
[1:39:46] some organization they never started it
[1:39:48] from some mechanical Affair the grounds
[1:39:50] never started there he says therefore
[1:39:52] the organization can never never do the
[1:39:55] work of God because the Battlegrounds
[1:39:57] where you've got to meet your enemy is
[1:39:59] in the mind you've got to make your
[1:40:01] choice it meets you in other words you
[1:40:03] can't stay neutral if you stay neutral
[1:40:05] you've lost amen you got to make a
[1:40:08] choice and it's a battle to make the
[1:40:09] right one he says your choice is going
[1:40:11] to come to you whether you want to make
[1:40:12] it or not you're going to come to the
[1:40:14] valley of decision and you're going to
[1:40:15] have to make a
[1:40:17] choice we see here from what Paul said
[1:40:19] in the prophet of God's pointing us back
[1:40:20] to that same thought that the
[1:40:22] Battleground is first and foremost in
[1:40:24] the mind and every battle after that
[1:40:26] comes afterwards the first battle is in
[1:40:29] your mind our thoughts are what show the
[1:40:31] signs of the
[1:40:32] battle you think about what you've been
[1:40:34] thinking about over the past week and
[1:40:36] then you'll realize there's probably
[1:40:37] been a battle going on Amen there's been
[1:40:40] a struggle that's there and and and we
[1:40:42] think that's a natural thing but I want
[1:40:43] you to think where do thoughts come from
[1:40:45] where does inspiration come
[1:40:48] from you know I'm an engineer and we'll
[1:40:50] sit there and we're trying to come up
[1:40:52] with something do and all of a sudden
[1:40:54] something comes out that you've never
[1:40:55] seen before nobody's ever done it before
[1:40:59] and then you go and you do it why
[1:41:02] something outside of me brought it to me
[1:41:05] and it's no different for everything
[1:41:06] else we think that we are the sum of our
[1:41:08] thoughts but something's bringing it and
[1:41:10] you know so often you see in the
[1:41:11] cartoons you see an angel on the right
[1:41:13] shoulder and you see a demon or a devil
[1:41:15] on the left shoulder and they're both
[1:41:16] pointing at the brain and they're trying
[1:41:18] to feed thoughts in that's what's
[1:41:19] happening remember what Paul says it's a
[1:41:22] battle of the Mind
[1:41:25] there's thoughts that are coming in and
[1:41:26] they ain't all Godly thoughts they're
[1:41:27] not all inspired by the word of God so
[1:41:30] we're fighting these things day by day I
[1:41:32] can't create inspiration it comes to me
[1:41:36] that's exactly the way it works amen and
[1:41:37] it's not always with beauty and and
[1:41:40] nature and these different things
[1:41:42] sometimes you're literally just sitting
[1:41:43] there and something comes to you and you
[1:41:45] say where did that come
[1:41:46] from but then you've got a choice is it
[1:41:49] Godly inspiration or is it Satanic
[1:41:51] inspiration because there's only two
[1:41:52] sides
[1:41:54] two
[1:41:54] sides right there's God and then there's
[1:41:57] everything
[1:41:58] else and see what we've got today is
[1:42:00] we've got a society that's putting God
[1:42:02] on a
[1:42:03] spectrum and that's not the way it works
[1:42:06] there's God who is truth and then
[1:42:08] there's everything else and if you mix
[1:42:11] one thing with truth it's no longer
[1:42:12] truth truth stands alone it's an
[1:42:15] absolute it's the standard
[1:42:17] amen when we look at inspiration you got
[1:42:20] to remember that Satan remember his name
[1:42:21] is Lucifer and he was the ministry of
[1:42:24] worship he was the leader of worship in
[1:42:27] heaven he knows how to inspire he knows
[1:42:31] how to get this flesh moving he knows
[1:42:33] how to get our emotions roiling over in
[1:42:35] these different things and remember he
[1:42:36] was thrown out because Pride was in him
[1:42:38] he made it about himself instead of God
[1:42:41] and he said I will exalt myself and I
[1:42:43] will do this and I will do that and so
[1:42:44] God kicked him out and what did he do he
[1:42:47] came down here and he perverted worship
[1:42:49] and what did he turn it into rock and
[1:42:51] roll rock and roll why is rock and roll
[1:42:54] so powerful because the master of
[1:42:56] heavenly worship came down and perverted
[1:42:58] true
[1:42:59] worship and he turned it into a carnal
[1:43:01] thing people will do Insane things under
[1:43:05] the power of rock and
[1:43:07] roll
[1:43:09] absolutely
[1:43:11] absolutely you know we laugh when our
[1:43:13] little kids you know you might be
[1:43:14] walking through the wall through the
[1:43:15] mall and and you there's some music
[1:43:17] going and all of a sudden they just
[1:43:18] start to they can't help it I can't
[1:43:22] dance because I'm white and German I
[1:43:24] mean that's like two it's brutal right
[1:43:27] but they just start moving why there's
[1:43:29] something about it that catches this
[1:43:31] flesh it absolutely feeds the Flesh and
[1:43:35] people will do absolute Insanity under
[1:43:38] that
[1:43:39] influence people will rip their clothes
[1:43:41] off that was the sign of insanity of
[1:43:43] demonic possession in the Bible was
[1:43:45] people that took their clothes off and
[1:43:46] what do people do now they willingly
[1:43:48] take their clothes off before they even
[1:43:49] walk out the
[1:43:51] door but what is it they've gone insane
[1:43:54] and they don't have a clue why you know
[1:43:55] I remember a good find of my friend of
[1:43:57] mine a cooworker in Texas and and uh
[1:44:00] Selena's first crush at the tender age
[1:44:02] of four and
[1:44:04] um he's a wonderful guy very friendly
[1:44:07] very nice professing Christian well I
[1:44:09] went over to his house one day to help
[1:44:11] him work on his pickup truck of course
[1:44:13] and he was playing rock and roll
[1:44:17] loud and I got out of my car and I I
[1:44:19] just listened for a moment and I
[1:44:21] couldn't tell a word that they were
[1:44:22] saying genuinely could not and I
[1:44:25] tried so I said to him I said do you
[1:44:28] understand what they're saying he says
[1:44:30] yeah I said repeat the lyrics to me as
[1:44:33] they sing them and he couldn't do
[1:44:36] it and I thought why would you listen to
[1:44:38] something you can't understand and he
[1:44:40] couldn't tell me why he liked it cuz he
[1:44:43] didn't know the words but there was
[1:44:45] something in his flesh that was feeding
[1:44:47] on it and he was bound by that rock and
[1:44:50] roll and he couldn't explain it all he
[1:44:52] knew was that he liked
[1:44:54] it let me tell you a child of God
[1:44:58] sometimes we love things and we can't
[1:44:59] explain
[1:45:01] it sometimes the word comes over the
[1:45:03] pulpit and it hurts and yet somehow we
[1:45:06] love
[1:45:07] it and we're not sick we're not
[1:45:11] Twisted it's because we know it's
[1:45:13] something for us and it's personal to us
[1:45:15] and it's God that's speaking and God's
[1:45:17] moving but Paul says cast down
[1:45:20] imaginations what's that imaginations
[1:45:23] are things that are not real being
[1:45:25] presented as real there is no reality to
[1:45:28] them amen think of a nightmare when we
[1:45:31] have nightmares it seems so real when
[1:45:33] we're in it and you can get so
[1:45:36] overwhelmed and you wake up screaming or
[1:45:38] you wake up in a sweat or you reach
[1:45:40] across and you you whack your spouse
[1:45:42] because you're trying to fight your way
[1:45:43] out of it it's so real and then you wake
[1:45:45] up and you realize it ain't real you
[1:45:48] know I have an interesting thing when I
[1:45:50] have dreams I have very action-packed
[1:45:52] dreams
[1:45:53] but here's the thing I always know I'm
[1:45:56] in a dream for whatever reason I do and
[1:45:59] so I can be in the most completely
[1:46:01] ludicrous life-threatening No Way Out
[1:46:03] situation and I'm like it's just a dream
[1:46:06] and it has no power over me it's
[1:46:07] exciting but it has no power over me but
[1:46:10] remember the thing of imaginations what
[1:46:12] we're getting at what Paul's saying he's
[1:46:14] casting down these imaginations is
[1:46:15] they're meant to bring fear and fear is
[1:46:18] rooted in satanic
[1:46:20] imagination because it's answering
[1:46:22] questions without any
[1:46:24] facts that's what it's doing it's
[1:46:26] presenting something it's answering the
[1:46:28] what if question with nothing that is
[1:46:31] proven and he's trying to turn it into a
[1:46:33] fear amen and and what's his hope his
[1:46:36] hope is that that fear will destroy your
[1:46:38] faith in the word of God that's why we
[1:46:40] have to guard our thoughts we have to be
[1:46:42] so careful how we think of these things
[1:46:44] we sit there and let our mind open up
[1:46:46] you know there's some of you know
[1:46:47] brother Rick pie over in well he's down
[1:46:49] in the States now but he was talking to
[1:46:51] my wife about this because you you know
[1:46:54] you you you see people that get into
[1:46:56] these things like meditation and brother
[1:46:58] Rick was in all sorts of things before
[1:47:00] he gave his heart to the Lord and he
[1:47:02] said never ever ever meditate with an
[1:47:06] open mind because he says there is
[1:47:09] satanic influence that's just waiting
[1:47:10] for you to open
[1:47:13] up we're supposed to guard our thoughts
[1:47:16] not open up our thoughts we open up to
[1:47:19] the word of God that's the only thing we
[1:47:21] open up to and everything else has to go
[1:47:23] through the filter that we apply which
[1:47:24] is the word of God every single time he
[1:47:26] said you would not believe and he's seen
[1:47:28] it and he's seen the manifestations of
[1:47:29] what happens when people get into
[1:47:31] meditation that were previously fine and
[1:47:33] they come out and they're completely de
[1:47:34] demon-possessed and they don't even know
[1:47:35] it they don't realize where these things
[1:47:37] come
[1:47:38] from what is it he's trying to get fear
[1:47:41] into our minds he's trying to bury
[1:47:42] everything good under a mountain of
[1:47:45] imagination questions concerns worries
[1:47:48] stress you know stress is the biggest
[1:47:49] killer we have right now they are tying
[1:47:52] almost every major disease back to
[1:47:54] stress in some form or fashion it's
[1:47:56] amazing and that's what Satan's trying
[1:47:58] to do fear is the opposite of God it's
[1:48:01] the opposite of love it's the it's the
[1:48:03] absence of God it's the opposite of
[1:48:05] Faith nothing good comes out of fear
[1:48:07] unless it's Godly fear and godly fear
[1:48:09] means respect respect for the word of
[1:48:12] God Amen fear is satanic at its core
[1:48:16] because it brings nothing good with
[1:48:18] it remember brother Paul mentioned this
[1:48:20] I think in job job said for the thing
[1:48:23] which I greatly feared has come upon me
[1:48:25] and that which I was afraid of is come
[1:48:28] unto me I was not in safety neither had
[1:48:31] I rest neither was I quiet yet trouble
[1:48:33] came what did fear do to job nothing
[1:48:36] good except take away his peace and his
[1:48:40] rest nothing good came out of it see
[1:48:42] they say it's it's an evolutionary thing
[1:48:44] that we have but it's been so blown up
[1:48:47] now because we don't have saber-tooth
[1:48:50] tigers running around now we don't have
[1:48:52] soldiers that are laying in Ambush to to
[1:48:55] steal our things and our wives and come
[1:48:56] take our house we don't have it anymore
[1:48:58] and so Satan has used that because we
[1:48:59] don't need fear the way we used to he's
[1:49:01] using it to magnify situations in our
[1:49:03] life to get us worried no matter what
[1:49:06] and he's a master at it Jo got caught up
[1:49:08] thinking about what could go wrong and
[1:49:10] all of a sudden things went wrong in a
[1:49:12] real
[1:49:13] hurry remember we know in 1 John 4:8 it
[1:49:15] says there is no fear in love but
[1:49:18] perfect love casts out fear I so enjoyed
[1:49:21] that when brother Jerry was preaching on
[1:49:23] that this last weekend that perfect love
[1:49:25] casts out fear time and time again when
[1:49:28] God would come down when he would send
[1:49:29] an angel to the people the first thing
[1:49:31] they'd say is fear not don't worry it's
[1:49:35] going to be okay and then he would tell
[1:49:37] them to do a very difficult
[1:49:39] thing and they would go do it because
[1:49:42] fear had
[1:49:44] left fear
[1:49:46] not fear not little flock
[1:49:51] amen we know what perfect love is it's
[1:49:54] not a
[1:49:55] feeling it's a person it's the very Life
[1:49:59] of Christ it's the holy spirit inside of
[1:50:01] us amen and the greatest revelation we
[1:50:03] can have is that we have the Holy Ghost
[1:50:06] because that tells us we're a child of
[1:50:07] God the only thing that tells you you're
[1:50:10] a child of God is when the Holy Ghost
[1:50:11] comes to live inside of you because
[1:50:13] there's lots of people will say I
[1:50:15] believe this but how many of them can
[1:50:17] live
[1:50:18] it because the fruit of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:21] is the word living through you
[1:50:23] it's not your name on a church book it's
[1:50:25] not Church attendance those things
[1:50:27] should all be natural to
[1:50:30] us but it's the life of the word coming
[1:50:32] out it's the fruit of the word that's
[1:50:34] coming out that's what tells us amen
[1:50:37] that God is vindicating our life by his
[1:50:39] presence inside of us now listen you
[1:50:41] might only feel like you've got a bit of
[1:50:43] it but a bit of God like I said earlier
[1:50:46] that'll defeat anything that Satan has
[1:50:47] in your
[1:50:48] life nothing can stand before God
[1:50:51] nothing can stand before for him but
[1:50:53] Paul would warn us about our thoughts
[1:50:55] because that's the access point for
[1:50:56] Satan so many times Paul knew that's our
[1:50:58] struggle day by day is to get our
[1:51:00] thoughts
[1:51:01] right we've got to win that inner battle
[1:51:03] that's the real battle that's as we look
[1:51:05] at this and The more I've studied this
[1:51:06] the more I realized that what happens
[1:51:08] here is so often what determines what's
[1:51:09] going to happen out there this is not a
[1:51:11] mind over matter thing listen we're
[1:51:13] going to go through the trial whether we
[1:51:15] want it or not but how we go through it
[1:51:17] will determine is determined by what
[1:51:19] happens up
[1:51:20] here listen the the the disciples were
[1:51:23] killed so many different ways Paul
[1:51:25] willingly went to Caesar knowing he was
[1:51:27] going to lose his life but he didn't go
[1:51:29] fearful and Afraid and
[1:51:31] scared he went there with the love of
[1:51:33] Christ in his heart and he witnessed for
[1:51:35] years and years and wrote most of the
[1:51:37] books of the Bible while he was in jail
[1:51:40] and and under house arrest and these
[1:51:41] different things how you go through it
[1:51:44] that's what matters not whether you go
[1:51:46] through it it's how you go through
[1:51:48] it amen I'm so encouraged by having
[1:51:51] brother Jim here this morning morning
[1:51:53] goes through a heart attack you know
[1:51:54] what you'll find brother Jim is you go
[1:51:56] to him to encourage him and he ends up
[1:51:57] encouraging you after having a heart
[1:51:59] attack that's the way the Believers go
[1:52:01] through things is that we know there's
[1:52:02] more to this than just the situation and
[1:52:05] so we've got faith to keep pushing
[1:52:06] through
[1:52:09] amen what happens in the mind we've
[1:52:11] preached on this before I know but what
[1:52:13] happens in the mind is it's the
[1:52:15] gate it's the gate between the soul and
[1:52:18] the spirit cuz in your soul is where the
[1:52:20] Holy Ghost is amen that's what seals
[1:52:22] your soul to the day of your full
[1:52:24] Redemption when your soul is sealed
[1:52:26] that's eternal life but this body and
[1:52:28] this spirit this nature is unregenerated
[1:52:30] so many times and so what happens is
[1:52:32] you've got a gate between that soul and
[1:52:34] the rest of your body and it's the mind
[1:52:36] and when that gate is opened by faith
[1:52:38] then the word can come through from the
[1:52:40] soul because the scripture says Thy word
[1:52:42] have I hid in my heart that I might not
[1:52:43] sin against thee that's what's hidden
[1:52:45] inside of our heart is the word and
[1:52:47] we're feeding that every day by day but
[1:52:49] what happens is that mind is there and
[1:52:50] now we've got to fight against reason
[1:52:52] we've got to fight against logic Common
[1:52:54] Sense World Knowledge education whatever
[1:52:56] it might be and what happens is that's
[1:52:58] Satan's way of shutting that door but
[1:53:00] when Faith now being built up by our
[1:53:03] day-to-day living by feeding our
[1:53:05] experience with God it takes that and it
[1:53:07] pushes that door open and what happens
[1:53:09] now is the word can slip through and the
[1:53:11] Holy Ghost is behind it to make it live
[1:53:12] in our lives and it brings Victory to
[1:53:15] us that we can go through the trial that
[1:53:18] we can go through the test and we can
[1:53:19] pass it God didn't come to take our
[1:53:21] tests and trial away in fact he promised
[1:53:24] the
[1:53:25] opposite but he promised us we'd have
[1:53:27] Victory through it all that he'd be with
[1:53:29] us that we could have the peace and rest
[1:53:30] and love and joy and these different
[1:53:32] things
[1:53:34] amen we have to guard those
[1:53:37] thoughts but when that faith comes out
[1:53:39] it's
[1:53:39] substance remember that's what that's
[1:53:41] what we're looking for is substance
[1:53:43] Faith there's a reality behind it so
[1:53:45] that when the next roadblock comes up it
[1:53:46] doesn't just back away and say well I
[1:53:47] guess the word is wrong no it says God
[1:53:49] started this God's going to finish it
[1:53:52] and and we keep knocking open those
[1:53:53] doors and we keep knocking open those
[1:53:54] doors and going through those walls
[1:53:57] amen you know Satan likes to beat us up
[1:53:59] over our mistakes and our
[1:54:01] flaws
[1:54:03] amen that's his Focus he will never
[1:54:06] Focus you on what you're doing right and
[1:54:09] guess what 99% of the time what we're
[1:54:11] doing is right and he'll Focus you on
[1:54:12] the
[1:54:14] 1% and what's he trying to do he's
[1:54:16] trying to get you off the mindset that
[1:54:18] you're a child of
[1:54:19] God and he's trying to beat us down and
[1:54:22] comes into a a sort of humility where we
[1:54:24] say well I'm no good but it's a humility
[1:54:27] that's based on
[1:54:29] insecurity that's not humility that's
[1:54:33] bondage humility is is not us thinking
[1:54:36] we're no good or of no use humility is
[1:54:39] realizing that without Christ I have no
[1:54:41] Eternal use no Eternal value that's it
[1:54:44] prophet of God would say that humility
[1:54:45] is
[1:54:48] compassion humility puts you into
[1:54:51] action without putting you into it it
[1:54:54] takes you out of it and it says this is
[1:54:57] him working not me that's the humility
[1:54:59] is it's letting him use you and saying I
[1:55:02] bring nothing to this table except a
[1:55:04] willing
[1:55:06] vessel amen that's what we've got to do
[1:55:08] to paralyze
[1:55:09] Satan not stand there and argue with
[1:55:12] them you're not a child of God I am a
[1:55:14] child of God you're not a child of God I
[1:55:16] am a child of God you know what you do
[1:55:18] is you walk away have you ever dealt
[1:55:20] with somebody that refuses to argue you
[1:55:23] it's the most frustrating thing when you
[1:55:24] know you're
[1:55:27] right it is cuz you're trying to get
[1:55:30] them to see the light and they just say
[1:55:32] I'm good where I am and they walk away
[1:55:35] that's what we need to do to Satan
[1:55:37] because Satan wants to introduce logic
[1:55:39] he wants to introduce reason into the
[1:55:42] equation because he's a master at those
[1:55:45] he got Eve to turn you give him enough
[1:55:48] time he'll turn you as well in little
[1:55:50] areas of your life but if you walk away
[1:55:52] and say I am a child of
[1:55:54] God I've been signed sealed I'm being
[1:55:57] delivered and you walk away you know
[1:55:59] what happens Satan's the one that starts
[1:56:01] to get frustrated I feel it's about time
[1:56:04] Satan started getting a little more
[1:56:05] frustrated church that we refuse to
[1:56:08] argue we refuse to let those thoughts
[1:56:10] come in and we just keep bringing it
[1:56:11] back to it is written it is written it
[1:56:14] is written it is written after three
[1:56:17] times he left Jesus he'll do it to you
[1:56:19] if you keep doing the same thing you do
[1:56:22] the the same thing it'll get the same
[1:56:23] results every single time by the word of
[1:56:25] God
[1:56:27] Amen Paul said this finally Brethren
[1:56:30] talk about guarding our
[1:56:32] thoughts whatsoever things are true
[1:56:35] what's
[1:56:37] true scripture says Thy word is truth in
[1:56:41] other words whatsoever things are
[1:56:42] according to the word of God Paul said
[1:56:44] let God be true and every man a
[1:56:46] liar that means sometimes I'm going to
[1:56:48] be a liar if I don't bring my thought
[1:56:50] subject I've got to take my my own
[1:56:52] things and say nope I'm going to let the
[1:56:54] word be true
[1:56:56] today whatsoever things are honest that
[1:56:59] means
[1:57:00] honorable whatsoever things are just
[1:57:04] that means righteous upright and
[1:57:06] acceptable to God whatsoever things are
[1:57:09] pure I love this chased holy
[1:57:13] clear untainted by our opinion or
[1:57:18] ideas that takes me completely out of
[1:57:20] these thoughts he says whatsoever things
[1:57:23] are
[1:57:24] lovely whatever is acceptable and
[1:57:26] pleasing to God then this one whatsoever
[1:57:29] things are of good
[1:57:31] report now we think that means that
[1:57:34] things we only talk about things that
[1:57:35] are good but what this means is that it
[1:57:38] is pointing to a testimony the testimony
[1:57:41] isn't here yet but it's coming it's
[1:57:44] pointing to encouragement it's pointing
[1:57:46] to an answer to prayer it's pointing to
[1:57:48] the good things of
[1:57:50] God that's what a good report is he says
[1:57:52] if there be any virtue if there's any
[1:57:55] strength if there be any praise if
[1:57:57] there's anything worthy of thanking God
[1:57:59] for he says think on these things so
[1:58:03] what is the answer when you're having
[1:58:04] all sorts of thoughts that are dragging
[1:58:06] you down it's never going to happen he's
[1:58:08] never going to answer I'm never going to
[1:58:09] get healed he's never going to provide
[1:58:11] think on things that are of
[1:58:13] God that's specific and
[1:58:17] intentional and if you don't know what
[1:58:19] to think take your thoughts out of it
[1:58:21] and just start reading
[1:58:23] start listening put on some preaching
[1:58:25] put on some real anointed
[1:58:27] music put on something that can take you
[1:58:30] into the presence of
[1:58:31] God don't sit there if you're fighting
[1:58:34] with the thought and you can't win the
[1:58:35] thought don't think you can fight it
[1:58:37] just move on to something that will work
[1:58:39] sometimes we've got to realize there's
[1:58:41] more to this than I can handle and we
[1:58:42] need to move to something that's got
[1:58:44] more strength than we've got at that
[1:58:45] moment CU we all have weak moments
[1:58:47] absolutely we do
[1:58:49] amen but that thing on on good report
[1:58:52] can I give you an example because it's
[1:58:53] an example we all know cuz it just
[1:58:55] happened remember brother Bob sent that
[1:58:57] email out from from from Sister Becky
[1:59:00] about that that lady in their church
[1:59:01] that they had the baby and now it was
[1:59:04] going into surgery which it came through
[1:59:06] just fine praise the Lord they told us
[1:59:08] yesterday came through just fine but
[1:59:10] remember he sent us and remember it was
[1:59:12] about the heart problem and he was going
[1:59:14] to need three surgeries one now one at
[1:59:16] four and then one a little while later
[1:59:18] and we can look at that situation and we
[1:59:20] can say it's sickness it's difficulty
[1:59:23] there's a low probability of success
[1:59:26] there's a probability that that baby's
[1:59:27] going to die and you go into prayer
[1:59:31] that's not going to
[1:59:32] work but as I was reading that email I
[1:59:35] want to share my Approach on this as God
[1:59:37] is my witness when I read that request
[1:59:39] and then I wrote back to brother Bob he
[1:59:40] is my witness I saw the testimony of
[1:59:43] that baby above all else can I read the
[1:59:46] words again she said I prayed for a
[1:59:49] miracle when I worried that I would
[1:59:51] never be able to carry another child
[1:59:54] okay there's worry there but she says I
[1:59:57] prayed and then her next sentence is God
[2:00:01] heard then she comes to the next one I
[2:00:03] prayed for a miracle when doctor said
[2:00:05] our baby would have to be born by
[2:00:07] C-section and we wouldn't even get to
[2:00:09] see him before he was taken to surgery
[2:00:12] oh horrible situation she said God had
[2:00:15] plans then she says they thought he only
[2:00:18] had a 20% chance of surviving the
[2:00:20] surgery and if he did the doctor said
[2:00:22] his prognosis was only 12 months she
[2:00:24] said God changed the
[2:00:27] situation then she said I prayed for a
[2:00:29] miracle when the ultrasound showed that
[2:00:31] even still he needed surgeries and
[2:00:33] couldn't be born too early somehow I
[2:00:35] carried this child until almost 39 weeks
[2:00:38] and he is strong she said God
[2:00:41] cared I talked to them yesterday sister
[2:00:43] Becky said the child was never going to
[2:00:46] live and we got down on our knees as a
[2:00:48] church and we started praying and every
[2:00:51] time they went back to the doctor the
[2:00:53] baby was a little bit
[2:00:54] better it wasn't all in one moment but
[2:00:57] as it grew God was producing what it
[2:01:00] needed to sustain life so when I read
[2:01:03] this this email I did not see a
[2:01:06] situation that was desperate I saw God
[2:01:09] hears and answers I hear God has a plan
[2:01:13] there's a miracle that's just been born
[2:01:15] so when I go to prayer I don't go and
[2:01:17] say God the Situation's horrible we need
[2:01:19] you on the scene I say God there's a
[2:01:22] good report here already God there's a
[2:01:24] testimony that's already here and you
[2:01:26] don't start one to just let it fall flat
[2:01:28] on his face God continue the testimony
[2:01:31] continue the plan continue the work that
[2:01:34] you've already started that's what it
[2:01:36] means to keep your mind of a good report
[2:01:38] now Lord Jesus we need you we do need
[2:01:40] you but we see you here already we don't
[2:01:43] have to come find you you're in the
[2:01:45] situation and all we're doing is
[2:01:47] confessing you're here and we believe
[2:01:48] you and we're trusting you to do a work
[2:01:52] Hallelujah that's what it means to have
[2:01:54] a mindset of a good
[2:01:56] report and as I prayed the presence of
[2:01:59] God came down and I just started to weep
[2:02:02] because I know he's in the house
[2:02:04] then he's been there all
[2:02:07] along remember what Moses told the
[2:02:09] children of Israel he said write a book
[2:02:12] of
[2:02:14] remembrance write down I don't have it
[2:02:17] here it's in my office I've got like
[2:02:19] five pages of answered prayers some of
[2:02:24] them impossible from this church
[2:02:26] alone and you know what when I go to
[2:02:29] prayer you know what I do I read the
[2:02:31] testimonies before I go to prayer
[2:02:34] because it tells me he's an ontime God
[2:02:36] he does all things well he heals doesn't
[2:02:39] he sister
[2:02:40] Justine he provides doesn't he brother
[2:02:43] Chad he leads he guides he
[2:02:45] [Applause]
[2:02:49] spares it's a good report and it sets me
[2:02:53] up to enter his presence with praise and
[2:02:56] worship rather than a is this really
[2:02:58] going to
[2:03:00] happen that's what the church needs to
[2:03:02] do this
[2:03:07] morning that's where my mind went
[2:03:10] because that is truth that is pure that
[2:03:13] is good that is Honorable that's of a
[2:03:15] good
[2:03:17] report and it was so no surprise then
[2:03:19] that God had brought him through a
[2:03:21] surgery
[2:03:22] of course he did and he'll do the next
[2:03:24] one and he'll do the next one and he'll
[2:03:26] be a living testimony of the saving
[2:03:28] grace of God I believe it with all my
[2:03:29] heart
[2:03:31] amen that's what a good report
[2:03:34] means Church what's our mindset this
[2:03:36] morning as we start to close is it
[2:03:38] dwelling on the
[2:03:40] challenges is it dwelling on the
[2:03:42] problems is it dwelling on the health
[2:03:44] issues is it drawing focusing on the
[2:03:46] marital issues is it focusing on that
[2:03:48] child that hasn't been to church in 30
[2:03:50] years
[2:03:52] can I give you one more story this
[2:03:53] morning do you remember
[2:03:56] David and he's in the land of the
[2:03:58] Philistines he's completely outside the
[2:04:00] land and he's fighting for the enemy or
[2:04:03] they're trying to get him to fight
[2:04:04] against Israel with the Philistines and
[2:04:07] he gets away from it he gets away by the
[2:04:08] skin of his teeth and then he runs back
[2:04:11] with his soldiers to ziggle which is the
[2:04:12] home that they had in the land of
[2:04:14] Philistines and when they get there the
[2:04:16] city is burned all their children are
[2:04:19] gone all their wives are gone they they
[2:04:21] have nothing left and the men are ready
[2:04:24] to kill
[2:04:27] him you know what David
[2:04:29] did David said David encouraged
[2:04:34] himself in the Lord his
[2:04:40] god listen I I I think it's wonderful
[2:04:43] that we've got a God for brother Mark
[2:04:45] and sister morine and brother Bob and
[2:04:46] sister Brenda but I need a god of
[2:04:48] Jonathan
[2:04:49] klette amen David is in an impossible
[2:04:52] situation his men that have been so
[2:04:54] loyal are ready to kill him there's
[2:04:58] nothing left and they are way behind the
[2:05:01] enemy it's a hopeless situation what
[2:05:03] does David
[2:05:04] do David encourages himself in the Lord
[2:05:07] his God he starts reminding himself of
[2:05:11] the change in his life since he got the
[2:05:13] anointing he reminds himself of all the
[2:05:15] victories God has given him of all the
[2:05:17] close scrapes where it seemed like
[2:05:19] nothing could get him out and imagine
[2:05:22] God got him out of all the times God
[2:05:25] brought him through trial after test
[2:05:27] after trial after situation saved him
[2:05:29] from other people and saved him from
[2:05:32] himself and what did it do it built up a
[2:05:35] faith in David and he said call the
[2:05:37] priest he says let's go talk to God and
[2:05:40] he says God do we go after him and God
[2:05:41] says go after them I will deliver them
[2:05:45] back into your
[2:05:46] hands and so he did ran them down saved
[2:05:50] them all
[2:05:53] what when all around my soul gives way
[2:05:55] he then is All My Hope and stay on
[2:05:57] Christ the solid rock I stand all other
[2:05:59] ground is sinking sand David was saying
[2:06:02] it looks bad but it's looked bad
[2:06:05] before you got to get through a looking
[2:06:08] bad situation once just to see that God
[2:06:10] can bring you in but that ought to get
[2:06:11] you ready for the next one that's coming
[2:06:13] your way so when it looks worse you can
[2:06:14] say he's a god of the
[2:06:16] worse he can still bring me through
[2:06:18] those things amen we can focus on the
[2:06:20] mercies on the Deliverance on the
[2:06:22] Promises of God rather than the
[2:06:24] situation but you've got to get into
[2:06:26] those situations you've got to come
[2:06:28] through those situations so often we're
[2:06:30] praying God take it away and God's
[2:06:31] saying I'll take you through it just
[2:06:33] trust me it's for your good you're going
[2:06:36] to come out stronger and better than you
[2:06:37] came through
[2:06:39] it puts it this way that's the way the
[2:06:42] Christian ought to do today is keep
[2:06:44] yourself prayed
[2:06:46] up under a spiritual
[2:06:48] atmosphere never seeing the bad side
[2:06:52] looking to the good side that's a choice
[2:06:56] that is absolutely 100% a choice that I
[2:06:58] and you get to make every day where are
[2:07:00] you going to look he says you are
[2:07:03] children of God expecting His
[2:07:07] blessings he'd say last quote never
[2:07:10] permit a negative thought to come in
[2:07:13] your mind but I love how he says if you
[2:07:16] can help
[2:07:17] it he knows we are just dust
[2:07:22] never let a permanent thought or a
[2:07:23] negative thought come into your mind if
[2:07:24] you can help it he says but when it
[2:07:27] starts that don't entertain it will you
[2:07:30] say well I can't help the thoughts from
[2:07:32] coming well that'll be like the farmer
[2:07:33] that said he couldn't stop the birds
[2:07:35] from flying over his place but he could
[2:07:36] sure stop them from roosting so that's a
[2:07:38] good thing you see you can't help the
[2:07:40] thoughts when they come but don't
[2:07:42] entertain them just pass it on and say
[2:07:45] no sir Jesus Christ is my savior All
[2:07:48] Things Are Mine by God and I'm going to
[2:07:50] keep them I'm going to testify of them
[2:07:54] amen God bless you let's stand this
[2:07:56] morning musicians would
[2:07:58] come how do you keep thoughts from
[2:08:01] roosting you got to start generating
[2:08:04] other
[2:08:05] thoughts sometimes we need
[2:08:07] inspiration it was funny I was talking
[2:08:09] with sister Moren the other day and you
[2:08:11] know if you ever you know there's always
[2:08:12] a go-to song that a minister has that
[2:08:14] that seems to work no matter what and I
[2:08:16] told her and she said the same thing
[2:08:18] Jehovah Gyra is is that song but when
[2:08:20] I'm fighting about
[2:08:22] battle you know what I start doing I
[2:08:25] start singing Jehovah Gyra my provider
[2:08:28] you are more than enough for me Jehovah
[2:08:31] Rafa you my healer by your stripes am
[2:08:33] set free Jehovah sh you are with me you
[2:08:37] supply my every need you're more than
[2:08:38] enough more than enough for me we are
[2:08:40] going to sing that sister Morin if
[2:08:42] you'll play it softly amen but you got
[2:08:44] to fill it with something sometimes you
[2:08:45] don't have inspiration go to where the
[2:08:47] inspiration is pick up your Bible listen
[2:08:50] to your Bible Bible we can't always pick
[2:08:53] it up maybe we're driving that's when we
[2:08:55] have so much free time sometimes turn it
[2:08:57] into a moment of prayer turn it into a
[2:08:59] moment of worship and praise we can't
[2:09:02] just sit there and let it play out and
[2:09:03] let Satan have a a party in our
[2:09:06] minds he'll win that every time if we
[2:09:08] let him but we've got to push back and
[2:09:11] cast down
[2:09:14] imaginations can I share a secret this
[2:09:17] morning you know how I know what you're
[2:09:19] thinking
[2:09:20] [Music]
[2:09:21] by your
[2:09:23] [Music]
[2:09:25] words sometimes people are coming up for
[2:09:29] prayer and they're already defeated by
[2:09:31] their
[2:09:33] words and I know there's a bigger issue
[2:09:36] there than what they're praying
[2:09:37] about cuz the Faith's not there their
[2:09:40] words are words of defeat sometimes
[2:09:42] we're talking to people and all they can
[2:09:45] talk about is the
[2:09:46] problem Satan's won the battle already
[2:09:50] he's won it up here and there's no faith
[2:09:52] coming out of that Battleground we've
[2:09:54] got to bring everything subject to the
[2:09:56] spirit of God by the word of God Amen we
[2:09:58] got to fight those things we got to say
[2:10:01] not
[2:10:02] today I'm putting my foot down today I'm
[2:10:05] going to the word I'm going to
[2:10:07] encouragement call somebody that's
[2:10:09] positive call brother Joe over say
[2:10:13] brother Joe encourage me in the Lord
[2:10:15] start thinking about what God has done
[2:10:17] for your life I we're going to have a
[2:10:18] testimony service here in the next week
[2:10:20] or two God willing on a Wednesday night
[2:10:22] I want you to be able to hear what God's
[2:10:24] doing in the lives around you
[2:10:26] supernaturally and specifically in the
[2:10:29] different ones so keep that in your mind
[2:10:31] over the next couple weeks we're going
[2:10:32] to do that Lord willing but remind
[2:10:35] yourself what he's
[2:10:36] done we sing that song Amazing Grace how
[2:10:39] sweet the sound through many dangers
[2:10:41] toils and snares we've come through so
[2:10:44] much and yet something pops up and we
[2:10:46] completely forget everything God's done
[2:10:47] for us
[2:10:51] he's always there always waiting to be
[2:10:54] called on the scene always waiting for
[2:10:57] an expression of Faith from his
[2:11:00] child not a
[2:11:02] complaint not a worry just a thankful
[2:11:05] heart that says Lord I'm trusting in you
[2:11:07] and I've got my life on the line because
[2:11:09] of it
[2:11:13] amen sometimes we just need to start
[2:11:16] speaking Yeah we've forgotten what the
[2:11:18] power of the spoken word is
[2:11:21] we can think it all day
[2:11:23] long we can think about that scripture
[2:11:26] that I am the Lord that heals all thy
[2:11:28] diseases but start saying it and it's a
[2:11:32] whole different thing you know when when
[2:11:34] I have my devotions I usually pray
[2:11:36] quietly but sometimes I pray out loud
[2:11:38] and I find it so much more effective
[2:11:40] when it's out
[2:11:42] loud just hearing the things that are
[2:11:45] coming out of our mouths towards God it
[2:11:47] inspires Faith amen but sometimes I feel
[2:11:51] silly cuz I know the kids are coming
[2:11:52] down and around and these different
[2:11:54] things
[2:11:56] and our house is you know you can hear
[2:11:58] things through the floor sometimes in
[2:12:00] that not everything I say should be
[2:12:02] heard by
[2:12:03] people but sometimes just sitting there
[2:12:05] and saying what God is doing the things
[2:12:08] he's placing on your heart it'll
[2:12:10] encourage that Faith it'll encourage
[2:12:12] your faith it'll bring you to a place
[2:12:14] where you can have a breakthrough in
[2:12:15] that stronghold you're facing amen I say
[2:12:18] God help me think right Lord help me win
[2:12:21] the the Battle of this mind because when
[2:12:22] that's one then I know that everything
[2:12:24] else it doesn't matter what happens cuz
[2:12:26] I'm resting by faith in his word amen
[2:12:29] let's Close Our Eyes each
[2:12:32] one amen how many would say Lord help me
[2:12:35] win that battle amen my hands up this
[2:12:37] morning Lord
[2:12:39] Jesus Lord we're coming to
[2:12:41] you Lord you are the author and you are
[2:12:44] the finisher of our faith Lord this is a
[2:12:47] work you started and it's a work you're
[2:12:49] going to finish Lord and I love that
[2:12:51] your word says it's a finished work Lord
[2:12:54] that we can look through the eyes of
[2:12:55] your word and it's already done though
[2:12:57] there's time left to play out there
[2:12:59] situations left to play out yet Lord
[2:13:01] It's a finished work in your eyes Lord
[2:13:03] if we can only see that by eyes of Faith
[2:13:06] this morning Lord and bring every
[2:13:07] imagination and every High thought and
[2:13:10] every contrary knowledge Lord subject to
[2:13:12] the truth of your word Lord and then lay

[2:13:16] spirit just Lord just hover over it Lord
[2:13:20] just brood over it and bring it to life

[2:13:24] mind Lord I pray you teach Our Hands to
[2:13:27] War Lord help us to fight Lord the
