up Lord help us to see our position in Heavenly places in Christ Lord we commit it to you in Jesus Christ's name we ask amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians 1 Ephesians chapter 1 amen isn't God good amen certainly enjoy the specials this morning each one I know the time and effort that goes in and my wife and daughter would say we're going out to practice and they come back two hours later and these things don't just happen because people want to do it it happens because they put in the time but sister Nikki I noticed that's a rather large book that you have there and I think we've heard three out of it amen I want to encourage sister Nikki to sing some more of the songs in that book that she has amen what a wonderful thing each one each one sing as you're LED it's not a pressure it's not a pressure amen but I believe if the spirit of God quickens you to sing something it ought to it ought to be in our hearts to do whatever he would ask us to do amen that was wonderful each one amen God bless you it's good to see sister AA Baker with us this morning sitting back there in the corner God bless you Sister anden it's good to have her with us want to just announce there will be no service on Wednesday um the vast majority of the church or at least a portion of each of the most of the families in the church will be in central newfinland for the funeral of brother Ivan Brenton and we've been asked to take part in that in a number of different ways so we're just uh I think for the sake of Simplicity we'll cancel Wednesday night service and we'll meet up again on Sunday Lord willing but just keep remembering them in prayer and brother Luke Gibson's flying in on Tuesday he'll drive out there and then Wednesday and fly out Thursday and then a number of us will be driving back and forth on Wednesday and Thursday so just praying God to be with us be with the families the relatives each one that God will just Comfort them amen amen it's good to be here this morning it's good to see the sun shining good to remember we serve a resurrected Christ amen and we're going to talk about that this morning in Ephesians chapter 1 because what we don't want is a resurrected Christ of just 2,000 years ago we're not looking at a God we're not looking at a man of 2,000 years ago but we want to see where he is today and we want to see what he's done for us in its fullness and we only scratched the service surface in each of these Services I know and I left 20 odd pages of notes back home that untouched and just trying to to catch what the Lord would have this morning but amen let's see what he has for us this morning and and take it as our own Ephesians 1 this is our this is our book of Victory this is our our inheritance book it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ you've got to be in Christ to have the blessings amen he says according as Heath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and last Service uh we started this this little miniseries on the full atonement and I want to take a subtitle this morning of perfection restored and last service I opened up with the scriptures and the quote where it said that God requires Perfection to stand in his presence to be in relationship with him and we looked at what that looked like in the Garden of Eden and perfection in the Garden of Eden was a perfect people in a perfect world under a perfect world under a perfect word they lived in that Perfection because they stayed with the word of God they stayed in relationship they stayed close to God and when they stepped away from that relation ship when they stepped away from that word then Perfection vanished and death came in and sin came in and these different things amen but when they sinned Perfection was lost Perfection was lost and God could not be with us anymore amen and they were banished from the presence of God and then it was death to try and enter into the presence of God there was a there was a cherums with a flaming sword that was holding them back and that was that was showing the law it was the righteous justice of God that was holding us back from his presence but we needed to get back into his presence that's why we die is because we're out of his presence amen and we're trying to get back into it and then Jesus would come along they had years thousands of years of the law and and the sacrifice of lambs and bulls and goats and all these different things and and Perfection was never found even in those that were were so close yet Perfection was not found in them and then Jesus would come thousands of years later and he would drop this on us and he would say be ye therefore perfect after thousands of years of nobody meeting God's requirement Jesus would come and say be ye therefore perfect and not only just perfect he would say even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so if it wasn't just pressure to be perfect perhaps even in our own eyes now he says no I want you to be perfect the way God is perfect and to make this even worse he had just magnified the law remember he said you say you know the scripture says you know that that you're not supposed to commit adultery and he said but I say unto you that if a man looks at a woman and lusts after her in his mind in his heart he has already committed adultery with that woman and he will be judged by God accordingly having not done it but having thought about it he said that you'll be judged as if you had that act with that woman he had magnified it he had showed that your very thoughts the very Hearts the very intentions that we have God sees it all and he will judge us by that and then he says be ye therefore perfect who had a hope if by some chance somebody never acted on their thoughts yet each one of us has had thoughts and attitudes and motives and objectives that God would say they're not holy they're not acceptable before me how deflated would we feel if we had we had stood there and he had magnified the law showing us that even our thoughts will judge us us and then said now the requirement is for you to be perfect I don't think anybody walked away from that sermon feeling good about themselves and that's what the law does the law defeats you it leaves you hopeless it leaves you without a place to go it leaves you without a remedy it leaves you in your own failure and where do you go from there see that's where Satan will deal with us is in our failure and he'll say there's nowhere left to go well if we stay in our own condition if we stay in our own strength if we stay in what in the way we're born then he's right there is nowhere to go but there is a place that we can go amen if Jesus said to be perfect then there must be a way to be perfect amen Jesus was showing them that their Works would never make them perfect their works are something God expects but that is not their perfection but Perfection is determined by God and he sees and knows all things that are in our lives BR would say this he says if there is anything that I can do to make myself perfect in the presence of God then Christ did not have to die for me if there is one thing you can do that would Merit anything in the presence of God then Christ died in vain listen to this no lawke keeping no legalistic ideas of yours none of your own Holiness no things that you could quit doing quit lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco quit going to the picture shows he says still you are lost cease action sit on your couch and do nothing he says you're still lost he says nothing can do it joining churches rituals ceremonies baptism orders of the church reading of Creeds saying of prayers all those things would count nothing you are lost not one thing you can do in yourself for you are a sinner under condemnation and there is no way within yourself or any Creed or anything you could do or think of of yourself that would Merit one thing in the presence of God why because you because I am a sinner to start with what a horrible way to start an Easter morning service we are lost we are sinners there's nothing in us that can bring us and make us uh uh Merit the favor of God to even allow us into his presence but I'm not here this morning to beat you down that's as far as we're going to go I'm beating you down I'm here to give us hope this morning I'm here to show us the path I'm showing us the acceptable way I'm showing us the way that God did it and brother Bram would say this and he said surely if God expects people to be perfect as Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect there must be some preparation somewhere if God requires it then there has to be a way to do it because he's a just God he would continue say if God required a church without spot or wrinkle he had to have something to make it that way he could not require it his Justice his judgments could not let him ask such a thing if there wasn't a way to make it but he reminds us and man cannot do it in himself he's a total failure that is the starting point of getting on the path to Perfection is to say I can't do it there's nothing in me I'm a total failure he says God let him see that through the law through the judges through all the Old Testament he sent the prophets he sent the righteous men and they found out that everyone failed he says so God by his Sovereign Grace sent from the portals of Glory his only begotten son to take our place now here's our hope he says I'll tell you now there is a perfect place a perfect heaven a perfect God a perfect savior a perfect blood a perfect atonement a perfect being for you you aren't it but it's for you in and of yourself you aren't it but there's a perfect place a perfect heaven a perfect God a perfect savior a perfect blood a perfect atonement a perfect being a perfect body that is built and ready and waiting for each and every one of us how many wants that Perfection this morning to say I want to step into that that I'm sick and tired of dealing with this I want to step into the Perfection that God has prepared and we can see it if we go back to Ephesians 1 this morning where we started he said according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love where are we chosen in Christ not just by Christ in Christ that is a position that is a place that is a a a a an inheritance it is an origin for the believer he says what that we would be holy and Without Blame before the world was brought into order before God started doing anything on this Earth to bring anything out of it he placed us in Christ and he said in Christ You Are Holy and blameless that is our origin that is our seed that is where we come from and because that is our origin that's where we have to end up cuz remember God will not be mocked whatever a man SWS he'll reap the law of the Harvest is what you sow is what you get and God SED us there as holy and blameless in Christ that means what comes out has to be eventually holy blameless and in Christ amen he says before we ever messed up before we did a work good or bad we were already in him he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will not according to our good works our good intentions none of that it says according to the good pleasure of the will of God and it's Grace to us because it's by his will that we come into this place it's unmar favor we don't deserve it he says for what what purpose to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accept where in the Beloved who is a beloved we read it a couple Services ago when Jesus comes to the River Jordan and he's baptized and the Holy Spirit drops on him he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell so it's in Christ that we are accepted amen it's through Christ we are accepted and it says in whom remember it's not with whom it's in it is a position it's a placing of the child of God in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of Grace of his grace it's through Christ that we have all these things amen through his blood we have the forgiveness of sin by his grace amen it's not by our works but it's by his grace and we saw as we closed in the last few scriptures on Friday night how that as Jesus died the veil of the temple was torn from the top to the bottom and when you look at the construction of that of those those curtains that were there the veil that was there it was not one piece but it was multiple pieces and multiple layers together and it was torn from the top showing that it started in heaven it was a work of God not a work of man starting from the bottom and ripping up but no man could tear that Veil it was woven too strongly it was too thick for a man to do it but God as Christ died he tore the veil into the holy of holies where his presence was where The Mercy Seat was where the word was and he tore it apart and did what let us look in now we know that before God is going to if God's going to open up access to him it must mean that access has been granted cuz God's not here to cause us to fall into a trap he's not going to say the do open and then as soon as we come into His presence we die because we're Unholy or unacceptable but he opens it because a way has been made something happened at Calvary that opened up a way for a person to come back into the Pres presence of God now amen but if we look in the Old Testament the holy of holies which was what what the veil surrounded was special because the presence of God was there the shikina glory was there and in that presence nothing died remember Aaron's Rod was there and it was just a stick from an almond tree but in the presence of God It produced almonds for thousands of years and the priesthood could go in and they could testify that the almonds are still growing because it's in the presence of eternal life it's showing what happens when we get back into the presence of God and remember they had the Mana that fell from heaven that fed the children of Israel and they had a bowl of mana and it was always there and it never went moldy it never went stale it never rotted away and then they had a the the the Ark of the Covenant there and on top of it was a seat and it was overlayered with gold the deity of God Amen but there was a seat there and once a year the priest the high priest would go in and he would pour blood on that seat and that made it a mercy seat it was judgment without the blood but if the blood could be placed on it it turned into a mercy seat and God would forgive the sins now for the sake of time this morning we can read about it in Leviticus 16 I'm not going to read it but I'm going to summarize it but in Leviticus 16:2 God warns Moses he says you can't just have men coming into my presence whenever they want he says they've got to be ordained men they've got to be chosen men and it was the ironic priesthood and it was the high priest alone that could go went to the the presence of God and he was only allowed to come in one day a year one day if he came outside of that one day God would strike him dead no matter how good he was no matter his good intentions he had to come in under a certain way and it was to make an atonement for the sins of himself and for the sins of the people it was to come into the presence of God for forgiveness and then you jump to verses 3 to 14 and only the high priest could come in in every year one day and he could only come in one way that was with blood he had to come in with the blood of a bull and he had to make a sacrifice for himself and his family and he would go into the holy of holies and he would hold this thing of blood amen God had to accept him first this is key God has to accept that high priest first cuz that man is mediating for the people and so he would go in and he would offer the blood and he would he would he would sprinkle it and he would place it on the mercy seat and then if he was not struck dead it meant that God had accepted his his offering and that man would walk out he would clean himself completely then he would offer a sacrifice for the people of a goat and he would walk in with the blood for the people and go to offer that and then God would accept that and he would come out and the people would Breathe this big sigh of relief because it meant their sins were covered for another year but they had to come in under blood amen and outside of that blood they would die and their sins will be held against them and the Judgment of God will come down on them so we see that blood is required to enter the presence of God that's what we see from that God required in Eden after they first sinned and for the next thousands of years God would God would require that blood to be there so we see that blood is the answer blood is the answer blood is the key to access the presence of God God and and he would tell us why in Leviticus 17 the very next chapter we've been talking about he said for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls the soul is what the atonements been made for because that's the Eternal part we're in Fallen flesh nothing here is good that's why we need a new body that's why we need a body like Christ glorious bodies because this one's in flesh this never will please him but the soul it's an atonement for the soul for the center for the for the the command center of our life he says it is an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul why because you can't have blood without a life being lost amen the life is in the blood blood's the Life Source to us we can live without a lot of things for a while you can go without water for a few days you can go without food for a month or so you can go without oxygen for five or six minutes they've had it up to 66 minutes in cold water that somebody can survive without oxygen but you take the blood out of a person's body and they are dead instantly why because the life is in the blood and Christ was showing and and God was showing in types and shadows what was required to bring us back into Perfection into Perfection it's got to be blood but notice it's not the blood itself that makes us perfect it's the blood that makes us accepted it's not the blood that makes us perfect in and of itself amen the law was imperfect and we saw that an innocent animal was killed and the blood covered the sin but remember that their blood the the life of an animal is incompatible with mine I can't take a blood transfusion from a chimpan and put it in my body and it work it doesn't work that way why because their life is incompatible with my life their blood is incompatible with my body so what would happen is their blood they were innocent they would cover their our sins but the intention was that the life of that blood would come into the person and that would make them perfect because the innocent would come into the guilty and what change them I would become I would take on the Innocence because of the life of the innocent coming into me but it never worked because animal blood and human blood they don't mix amen but it pointed to a need for us to have a compatible one that would die for us and give his life for us and give his blood for us so that his life could come into us that's what would make me innocent that's what would make me perfect that's what would make me acceptable would be if the life came in not just if the blood covered amen why because the end goal was Perfection the end goal was restoration the end goal was Redemption to bring us back into the presence of God to have eternal life to have authority over the world around us to be living Sons and Daughters of God under the original conditions of the Garden of Eden amen so when Christ came and he bled and he died for us us his blood was the blood of God the blood was shed and he was perfect he was sinless and he was willing and that innocent was just like that of the Lambs and he gave that for us and God accepted that he was the provided Lamb of God the scripture says he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world he was prepared by God and when he died the price was paid the price was paid for our sins our debts were erased our debts were eliminated there's nothing on the books it's not just marked out but it's completely erased there is no evidence that we are sinners this morning none whatsoever and we even see the effect of that on the on the cross because the thief is there remember and he says when you come into your kingdom remember me and Jesus says this day you'll be with me in Paradise that man was a sinner but the blood of Christ was coming off that cross and Christ died before that man paid the price for his sins and that Thief went directly into Paradise that's how effective the blood is but that Thief never went to Paradise a good man he went there a thief he went there a sinner the blood had paid the price and so he could go in amen but his life had not been changed when Christ died on the cross Peter didn't change John didn't change the disciples didn't change they were all still Sinners Sav by Grace under the blood of Christ their sins were hidden but their nature hadn't changed and they were still Bound in their own nature and we see what happened to Peter Peter went out and and he's fishing naked and he's he's disappointed and they're doubting the Lord's word and these different things why because they haven't been changed there the price has been paid their sins have been covered but they're still Bound in their own Humanity they're still Bound in this sinful flesh that they're born with but we see in all of this a promise that God would change our Natures as well that he'd set us free from the things that were born with our very being Amen to fix what was broken by sin and Paul will talk about this in Hebrews 10 and we're going to spend quite a bit of time there this morning and he's speaking about Christ he says wherefore when he comes into the world cometh into the world he said sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not but a body hast thou prepared me he's saying God didn't want sacrifices God wasn't sitting there wanting thousands or millions of animals to be slaughtered that was not what he wanted but he says a body thou Hast prepared me he needed someone to die he needed a man to die for those sins and he said and burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no pleasure God didn't enjoy seeing those animals slaughtered he says then said I this is Christ speaking lo I come in the volume of the book it's written of me to do thy will oh God and Christ is saying listen you prepared a body for me and I'm here to use it for your will then we jump down to verse 10 it says by the which by what by the sacrificing of that body we will we are all we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all that means it's a complete and total acceptable work before God Amen remember we LED last last service where where when he when Christ was on the cross and at the whipping pulse and these things it's says God was pleased to bruise him and then when it was all done it says he was satisfied God had let it all out on that body and he was satisfied that meant the debt was settled the sin question was settled forever that's what happened to calary is it settled the sing question forever God was satisfied amen amen and we see here in Hebrews 10:10 that it's by the sacrifice of Christ that we are clean before God then it jumps down to verse 11 and it says and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins yeah under under the the Old Testament law the ministry the priesthood would offer these sacrifices daily to cover the sins but but Paul's saying it never took away the sins it just covered them we needed someone to wash our sins away amen we needed somebody to pay the debt we needed somebody to remove them from off the books amen the sin debt wasn't paid but but it was covered it was hidden by the blood of blls and goats temporarily he says but this man Christ it had to be a man it had to be somebody whose life was compatible with ours but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever he says sat down on the right hand of God I saw a news story yesterday where there's a man in the Philippines got crucified for 10 minutes literally crucified they drove stainless steel nails through his feet through his hands and put him up on a cross and stood him up there for 10 minutes that man needs to read Hebrews 10:12 the sacrifice has been paid now you say well I don't crucify myself but we beat ourselves up so often we let Satan beat us up over our mistakes and instead of just saying I claim the blood not in this flippancy of I'm going to go do it again and claim the blood and go do it again and claim the blood but Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I didn't mean to do it and I claim the blood and when you do that you and walk away completely free in your conscience we do not have to sit around walk around beating ourselves up over our mistakes it's a mistake we're trapped into it even willfully yet he's faithful to forgive when you do it willfully you pay a different price when you're trapped into it it's a little different there's always consequences but that we're supposed to have is death and he paid that death Price He satisfied that sin debt forever amen that man that got crucified has missed the revelation that Christ has already paid for every sin he took every bit of suffering we're not required to suffer like he is that's why he did it so we wouldn't have to he says and from hence forth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol we're talking about perfection restored this morning let's read this together for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified one offering Christ perfects us our Perfection is all through his work amen notice he doesn't say he will perfect he's going to perfect one day I'll be perfect have perfected it's done it's finished it's a complete work Paul would say in another place he says we are sitting now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's where we started we were in him holy and blameless Paul says we are now why by the perfect work of Christ at Calvary prophet of God would say this he says there you are that's the answer to the death of Christ he says that's the answer to Calvary he absolutely with his own blood purchased our sins and perfected forever his Believers he says therefore in Christ We Stand blameless perfected in the presence of God Almighty he says we are underprivileged people with our own doctrines not catch this he says we all been taught that we have to get up to a certain place we have to do a certain thing we read the scripture last time that says while we were yet sinners Christ died for us you don't have to come up to anything to accept him we don't have to clean up to come into church we don't have to make oursel less sinful to be accepted we just have to accept his sacrifice today whether I did nothing wrong yesterday or whether my day was full of sin it matters not because he took my place we don't come to church cleaned up we come to church to get cleaned up this is a hospital it's a place for sick people for lost people for imperfect people why because he was the Perfection that God required when we wait for ourselves to be better to come into the presence of God we're just hurting ourselves he says we've all been taught that we have to get up to a certain place and we have to do a certain thing no my brother it's nothing you've done it's what God did for you we are now we are if we are justified by faith we are perfected forever in the presence of God he says then Jesus said be ye therefore perfect he says then it was perfected forever God through the death of Christ 1900 years ago today perfected the believer that he foresaw before the foundation of the world forever forever you can't undo it you can't Merit it you can't make it at work he's done it it's already finished he says those who he has called he has Justified those he fornew he has called those who he has called he's Justified those who he has Justified he is already glorified he has perfected his Believers you're standing perfect before God this morning through the work of Christ but remember it said how are we Sanctified it says we're Sanctified by the offering of Christ how are we per ected by one offering but what did he offer see this is where so many lose it is they don't look at the whole offering and they miss out on the full Redemption they miss out on the Perfection because if we see what Christ offered then we know what is supposed to be working in our lives and we see what offer what an offering is because remember an offering is what you tear out and we see in Luke 23:46 it says when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost he gave up his Spirit he willingly did it he did not they did not take his life from him he gave his life up literally the life went out of the blood somebody was talking to me the other day and and they were talking about what brother Brown was talking about he said it literally went down when he tore his body apart he went down to the atomic level and ripped that that that life was literally torn out out of him the very life in him was taken out of him that's what he gave up and then in John 19:34 it says and when one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forth with came there out blood and water what was his offering Spirit blood and water that's what was torn apart amen remember the quote we read last service where he says then he tore the soul out of his own son he separated a covenant and he threw the body onto the ground now we know that body went back to heaven and and it's behind the Throne of God it's the proof of the sacrifice it's there amen and it's what what was represented in scripture when we readed about Abraham where he tore those beasts apart as a sacrifice to God to confirm the Covenant all of those represented Christ but remember we see here he didn't T he didn't tear the body out he tore the soul out he tore the El tore the elements of him out of him but the body he just left why is it the parts that are torn out is what makes up the Covenant what comes out of him is what makes up the Covenant and you got to have all the parts of the Covenant to have a covenant amen remember we talked about what they did in those days is they would write out a covenant in the middle of those beasts and then they tear it and however many people were part of the Covenant got a piece of that Covenant and the Covenant had to be restored together to be enforced every portion had to be there whatever was tore out had to be brought back to those that held the Covenant who holds the Covenant today it's God's covenant with us that means each and every one of us has to have a portion of this Covenant we've got to have a portion of the elements that were torn out when Christ when God tore Christ apart at Calvary he took the blood he took the water and he took the spirit the separation of the water and blood that's the that's the atomic separation of the literal elements in his body and he did it with purpose what's the purpose of the blood it's to pay the price for our sins that is the purpose of it it's what justifies us it erases our sin debt it satisfies the righteous anger and Judgment of God John 1 1 John 1:1 says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin the blood is there to cleanse us it's there to clean us of the initial thing of that burden that's there just by our nature just by our birth he says if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in Us in other words you can't come to God saying I don't need your your atonement you can't come and say I don't need to repent I'm good the way I am he says if you do that then the truth of God's not even in you and we're deceiving ourselves he says but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so if we confess if we repent if we accept his offering he forgives us but catch that last phrase because he doesn't just say he'll forgive us but it cleanses us that's a working not just a washing but it's a working amen we'll be cleaned out not just covered not just erased but we'll be cleaned out amen we'll be transformed we'll be different than we were before that's a working of of that and what is the water amen it's the it's the washing of the Water by the word that's applied to our lives daily it's the word of God being washed being being effective in our life to take us away from the things into the world to expose the way Satan operates and to bring us into the plan of God and that's a daily thing we talked about it when we did foot washing on Friday amen he says you need to be washed daily because no matter who you are no matter where you go this is a dirty world and you're going to get dirty no matter what without intent without purpose you're still going to get dirty you can't walk through a mall without getting dirty you can't drive by a billboard without getting dirty you can't surf the Internet without getting dirty you can't be around co-workers without getting dirty it's dirt it's filth and that's has to be washed on a daily basis amen and sometimes it's the washing of the word comes by conviction and God shows us something that's off in our life and he brings us to a place where we'll say I'll lay that aside sometimes it's by inspiration I love it when I read this and it shows me that I can live in a higher place that I have blessings from God that I have promises from God and we can take that and we can we can we can have faith in it amen and it shows us what we're meant to be and how we're supposed to live and that there's a power of God's word behind it to make it live in us and then sometimes it's just by simple teaching this washing of water showing us right and showing us wrong very simple nonthreatening but it's still the washing of water helping us to live an overcoming life amen Ephesians 5 would say this husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church chch and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word see that cleansing is the external dirt the sanctification is the internal work it's like a a car that is filthy on the outside if you're going to justify it you kind of just spray up the outside you clean out the exterior but if you're going to sanctify it you're going to do a deep clean on the inside and get all the the food that the kids left out of it and all the dirt and the muck and the filth cuz it's been left un unclean for so long it's an internal work he says that's what the washing of the water of the word does he says for what purpose that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish remember we read the quote where he says if God requires Perfection there's got to be a preparation for it there's got to be a way made for it so we see the first way is by the blood it erases the sin debt then we see it's by the word by the washing of Water by the word that it keeps us clean and it produces a child that's ready for the life he says it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God he says which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place God doesn't attribute those sins to us the blood covers it and the water of the word keeps it away it's not there it can't be seen God can't see it so we have the blood we have the water of the the word but then we have the spirit that was taken out of Christ that he gave up and what is that it's his very life that's what the spirit is it's remember the life is in the blood and that life that Spirit went back to God Jesus said I commend my spirit back to you and it went back to God so the life came out but the life's got to come back too because that's the third portion of his Covenant that's the third part that was torn out of him and it's the holy spirit it's the eternal life of God and we can be clean we can be debt free we can look good but without the spirit we're just a good-look corpse that's all we are and that's what religion produces is good-looking corpses because they're clean they're washed but they're ready for the grave instead of life and that's where it gets us with man's ideas amen but that life has to come into us to give us that proven Victorious life because the same life that the same life that It produced in Christ is what it produces in a bride in the children of God Amen Paul confirms it in Hebrews 10 as we go back he says for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified and here's the proof of the Resurrection here's the proof of the sanctification here's the proof of our Perfection he says whereof the Holy Ghost is also a witness to us so the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost in our life is a witness that we are perfect that's quite a statement but remember he's looking at a soul he's not looking at this body because the Holy Spirit seals our soul to the day of redemption see we're looking at perfection in this flesh no that's what the blood covers it covers that imperfection but the Perfection that he requires is not in this flesh it'll be when we get to the other side and we have a body like his a sinless body but it's the soul that he's looking at it's the heart of a man it's the nature of a man and when he seals that with the Holy Spirit when his life comes back in us that's the proof that we are perfect why cuz God can't dwell in imperfection if God requires Perfection and God is living in you what does that mean you are perfect in his eyes you're accepted in his eyes amen God can't dwell in imperfection and if he requires Perfection and he's dwelling in you that makes you perfect this morning if you've got the Holy Ghost he said that whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he has said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them he says after those days sayith the Lord I'll put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them in other words God would take his word and he would place it inside of us and he would make us live it by choice not by force he would put something in us this is the proof of his Covenant is his life in us that makes us want to live according to his word he says and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more that's Ezekiel 36 if you want to go back to it 24-27 so the holy spirit in our lives is the witness it's the confirmation it's the proof it's the certification that God has accepted us that's what it is it's God confirming to us that we have met his requirement through Christ how do you meet it except the work of Christ that's all it's so simple I don't have to come and and lay down here and beat myself up in that yes repentance will have tears a dry-eyed confession is no confession amen but when I repent and I lay myself before him and say I claim the sacrifice of Christ he he does what he certifies me and he says I accept it and he fills me with his spirit and that shows that I'm perfect in his eyes we can't just rest on the effect of the blood we need the effect of the life because that was the purpose of the blood was to give us the life that was inside of it amen the life of that blood is what makes us live as Sons and Daughters of God in 1 Corinthians 12 it says for as the body is one and has many members so our bodies are a single unit but they have lots of Parts millions billions if you go down to the the cellular level billions of Parts but even all your your digits and stuff we're one body but we've got all these little Parts he says and all the members of that one body being many are one body see my pinky can say I'm Jonathan klet anybody that just looks at the pinky if I take a picture of my pinky nobody would say that's Jonathan klette but the pinky knows he's Jonathan klet and that's what he's saying he's saying the body of Christ is the same thing he says so also is Christ people will look at you and they'll say that's just the person but they can't see the full picture was which is you're a part of the body of Christ he says and that's what you are you're not the whole thing you're just a part of it but you are him you're in him he says Christ has many members many portions many elements he says for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body so how are we placed in Christ Christ how are we positioned how are we restored back to Christ it's by the Holy Spirit by the spirit that he gave up at Calvary he says whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free he says we have been all made to drink into one Spirit doesn't matter where you come from what your background is religious not religious Christian agnostic atheistic whatever it doesn't matter he says when you come into Christ it comes by one way and that is by the Life of Christ it is by the Holy Spirit coming back into us and we see what happened 50 days after Christ rose from the dead on the day of Pentecost that life came down on 120 people and it was God redistributing himself now into the members of his body it's a multi-member body now he says for the body is not one member but many where's Christ today everyone would point to the man 2,000 years ago they would point to he's sitting up there and he's waiting for this Kingdom to be given to him that's not what Paul says Paul says his body's right here and you're a part of it and I'm a part of of it what by the baptism of the Holy Spirit we are the body he is the head amen Christ has a body it's a multi-member body and you won't ever see all of him by seeing one portion of that body but when they get together you can see him that's why we come together that's what sets an atmosphere here is that there's more of Christ here if I can put it that way if you can understand it that way there's more of him so people can come in and see Christ here maybe a little easy more easily than they do if they just see me or they just see you you could walk there and bump your head against it but if the spirit of God is in there the spirit of God will unhinge the doors he says you've got to have the thing in here to unlock it Yonder now he says now here he comes torn Riven tore to Pieces his soul went to God and God blessed him and then his soul returned back in the form of the baptism of the holy spirit that comes into every believer now here's the work of it to sanctify to clean up the mind to clean up the heart and then here's the infilling to leave a portion of the Holy Ghost in there here and there and here and there and here and there and here and there a portion not the fullness a portion a portion of perfection he says and when the Holy Ghost is given out because remember every one that's in the Covenant has to have a part of the Covenant and he's saying the Holy Ghost is a part of the Covenant and without that you can't go in he says and when our holy go when the Holy Ghost is given out that same holy spirit that brought the body of Jesus out of the Grave will Rapture it'll Rapture us he says and that Covenant Hast a dovetail remember it's got to match up what came what was torn apart has to be put back together again so he says whatever you come with has to match with what got torn out originally whatever wrote The Covenant has to be back there again all the pieces have to match that Covenant has to dovetail as he tore there and gave the body went back to God and the Spirit came back to the Earth he says then your spirit will have to be the same kind of a spirit or it'll miss that place going together he says amen yes sir not because you make yourself but because something the love of God has swept into your soul that's tore every Earthly Idol out he says there it is that's the working of the Holy Spirit that's the effect of the Holy Spirit he says and there's something that just breathes and calls to God he says it's your soul in here calling out to the heaven father there you are that gives you faith and you become a the Seed of Abraham you always were but what does it do it produces the life that was in that seed he says you believe God's promise like Abraham did and though it lingered yet you believe it we're waiting on a resurrection we're waiting on a Rapture we're waiting on a changing of our bodies but our faith ought not to be wavering this morning why because we have the earnest of the Covenant he says faithful Abraham St not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God that Holy Spirit that God gives you when he receives your confession and your baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is his sign to you that you're going to make it the greatest Revelation you can have today is that I have the Holy Spirit not just something on me I've got something in me that when I walk out these Church doors I live the same life out there that I do in here and that it's calling me and that it's p pulling me and that it's drawing me and that it's Lifting me it's inspiring me it's correcting me to come back to the fullness of the word living out in my life that's the greatest thing you can have is that Holy Spirit living inside of you making you live the life of a Believer that's the separation between religion and Christianity is the Holy Ghost that's it that's it sons of God are led by the spirit of God Christianity is Christ calling you back to him with the same pieces that were torn out of him at Calvary the full word the full blood the Holy Spirit that's the portion of the Covenant that we each need and it's a life-changing event you can never be the same you get the Holy Ghost you cannot be the same as you were before cuz it's not your life now it's his life it's Christ in you he says there's none good but God but God is in the people that makes them good that marks the perfect man he says it's God in you that makes it perfect see be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how can you be perfect not in yourself but in him God doesn't look at you then he looks at him well you say I'm in him how do you get in him by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and then you're in him when you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body he says and if a man comes the worshipper correctly before Christ seeing his suffering and he offers himself to Christ and says oh Lord God there's nothing nothing in me that can atone but I am Holy depending on you he says then the Holy Spirit comes into the human heart and the Very s question is settled forever for every desire of sin has been taken from you for if the law had done that those sacrifices would not have had to cease but being there that it could not do it he says Christ had to die to make us perfect he says it settled the sining question forever if God says it's settled then what do we say when other people bring it up what do we do when Satan comes knocking on your door and says I saw what you did last night I saw what you said hey here's a bad one I saw what you thought Believers don't think like that what do you say Satan where's your keys Satan do you can you even lock your door anymore Satan where's your power where's the hold that you used to have Satan start talking back to him about what he looks like start talking back to him about his position and say when Christ accepted me you lost all authority in my life he paid the price I ain't perfect he doesn't expect me to be perfect that's why he paid a price go go look at what he did at Calvary you ought to remember that day cuz that's the day you lost every power and authority you had on this Earth and over me you remind him the blame for this is going back to you buddy it rests on your shoulders now I'm sinless I'm perfect he's accepted me he's living in me now we're sitting in a work in a place of perfection because of the work of Christ today right now unworthy yet there we sit Hebrews 10 Paul would say now where remission of sin is of these is there is no more offering for sin he says when sin's forgiven you don't have to keep going back and doing it over and over again you don't have to keep going back and saying I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry here's more blood here's more blood here's more blood he says Christ has covered it once it's done you don't have to go make a sacrifice you have to say you're sorry but you don't have to make a sacrifice you don't have to beat yourself up we don't have to keep trying to make amends that's the Catholic way make amends pay a price myself no he paid the price so we don't have to that we can say I'm sorry in sincerity repent walk away and go free and look at the effect of this he says having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest of holies by the blood of Jesus Remember in the Old Testament only one man a high priest could go in one day a year and he had to come in with blood and he went in tentatively he went in carefully he was glanced he was dressed perfect he was walking perfect everything remember the scripture says it has to be holy holy holy his actions could cause him to die Paul says we have boldness if I've got boldness what do I do I say how we doing that's boldness I'm not sitting there saying is he going to strike me am I acceptable Paul says boldness to enter into the presence of God boldness why because now you've been invited when he opens the door that's the invitation when he tears the veil that's the invitation when he calls that's the invitation and I've got boldness not in myself but I've got boldness because he opens the door and he says come into my presence and don't ever leave it you don't have to leave it you know how I know I don't have to leave it because he's living in me Jesus said pray to the god that is within you you are the Tabernacle of the Living God he lives in me he dwells in me so I can come boldly to the throne because he's he's opted he's chosen to be right here day in and day out I don't have to bring them down I don't have to lift them up I can in simple Faith say God I have a need God I've got a question God I've got a situation or my brother and sister does and he's right there I can boldly enter into his throne with a simple prayer that's all there is to it no restrictions no penalties remember in Esther when the the the the the advisers to the king said set up a rule that nobody can come in you're so great nobody should just be able to walk in you should have judgment over those that come in so here's the Rule King here's what we're going to do is if somebody comes into your presence and you didn't invite them then you can extend the scepter and if you extend the scepter they live if you hold it back we'll kill them on the spot that's the law but Paul says no no no he says having boldness to enter into the holiest holies how by the blood of Christ once and for all sin set sin was settled forever he says how by a New and Living Way see it used to be you came in by death something had to die to come in Paul says now this way is a new way it's a living way it's by life now we come into God's Presence by life not by death death paid the price but we come in now alive amen it's his spirit it's the token of the holy spirit that we come in with and say this token that you gave me is the living way and that's what brings me into your presence he says by a New and Living Way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say is flesh and having an high priest over the house of God he says let us draw near sometimes what's happening in service is the spirit of God is moving and you know what we do we sit back don't we God's doing something and what do we do we might be sitting here in these pews but we sit at the back and we say that's for them Paul didn't say just enter in he said draw near draw near let us draw near with what a True Heart a sincere heart a sincere heart he says in what full Assurance of our good works no full Assurance of Faith why having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water amen it's his work in us that draws us in it's his work that makes us accepted it's his work that says you can come close it's our human nature to pull back when we've done wrong when my youngest in particular we notice this when he does something wrong not only will he not come up to me but he will hide himself from my face if he sees me even look at him he hides his face from me because he knows he's done wrong that's a law working in him that's not Grace working in him but what happens is after he gets disciplined he won't draw near to me so you know what I do I draw near to him and I smile and I try and engage him what am i showing him daddy still loves you the discipline of Daddy doesn't change my love doesn't change your access you can do something wrong and come right back and ask me for something that you need and I'll give it to you Paul's saying draw near you've been sprinkled with blood you've been covered with blood there's nothing to hold you back but we sit there and say God I'm not worthy you know what you did yesterday you know what you did last night you know what you did on your computer you know what you did around your colleagues you know what you did with that person he says no you're sprinkled that conscience that's been wiped clean he says and if our conscience bother us God's still greater than that our conscience ought not to keep us back but if we have not repented our conscience should keep us back but we draw near in Repentance a sincere honest heart that's how we come in that's how we come in he says and our bodies washed with pure water that means we've applied the whole word not just the little bit that we like that affirms where we're at but the whole word cuz we want the water for the dirty spots not the clean spots remember the doctor is not for the healthy people the doctor is for the sick people the word is for the dirty spots that's why we need it let's apply it to the dirty spots amen we come in boldly because the blood of Christ covers Us Brown say this he says what is it he says oh God requires Perfection now catch this we're talking about coming in with a sincere heart True Heart he says he requires your repentance he does repent and be baptized and you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost ghost he says he requires your loyalty to him but he's looking tonight no matter how much you sinned how little or how much you are still a sinner and you cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice and in him you are perfected forever he says think of it it's nothing you do now watch this we've just went through New Years not too long ago it's not new pages you turn Lord I promise this year I'll do better Lord I promise I'll do better today Lord I promise next week I'll do better it's not a new life you start from this day on I will be different it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you because without him you're not going to change you're not going to turn a new page what you'll do is you'll turn a new page and then you'll flip it back that's what we do as humans he says that brings you to Perfection and then you are perfected in Jesus Christ he says oh I hope you see it it isn't whether you're good enough to be a Christian or not it's whether he was good enough if God accepted him and his blood makes an atonement God doesn't see you he sees the lamb remember we spoke before about when the when the sinner came to the priest he brought a lamb and the fact that he was coming with a lamb identified him as a sinner because only Sinners offer sacrifices so the fact that you're there the priest knew you were a sinner but remember he didn't examine the The Sinner he knew he was a sinner he knew he'd done wrong because he was he was present with a sacrifice but he looked at the sacrifice and the sacrifice had to be perfect it had to be without blemish it couldn't have any lumps or scars or or fur missing or anything like that the sacrifice had to be perfect and the only thing that priest looked at was that animal he never looked at the one that was kneeling before him he only looked at the sacrifice he says God doesn't see you he sees the lamb he sees Christ amen he says Oh my he says that was me no good not fit to live worthy to go to hell born in a sinful family raised a sinner no good at all not one sound part about me that's right he says but one day I accepted Hallelujah when God looked down on Christ and Christ took my place then God doesn't see me he sees the perfect one he says then as long as I'm in here in Christ he says in him then I am perfected not in myself in him not my perfection I don't have any you don't have any how are we going to get in it's not by anything we've got he says but it's his Perfection therefore Jesus didn't make a mistake when he said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect How could a human being be perfect he could be perfect by his perfect faith resting in him saying he paid the price for me me you say when I can get quit of smoking when I can quit drinking when I can straighten this thing up I'll do it put yourself there this morning what's Satan hanging over your head I'll get the Holy Ghost when I quit this or that God will accept me when I quit this or that no no no he says oh it will never be done right you'll never be able to do it why don't you just come the way you are he says and by faith go to that stream thy flowing wound suppli them redeeming love to be your theme and shall be till you die why take a substitute try why try to get in by your church why try to come in because you quit drinking or quit lying see that's the human nature is to try and warrant it deserve it he says he says come by the way of perfection for by once sacrifice he has perfected forever those that are Sanctified how do I get Sanctified he says confess your sins in the presence of the blood of Jesus and the life that come from that blood comes back to the worshipper and sanctifies him from the desires of the things of the world for by that all sufficient sacrifice every need supplied church it's a complete and total work he says he has Sanctified us one Spirit we're all baptized into one body now there is no condemnation are you under condemnation this morning he says there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus to them that walk not walk not after the flesh but of the spirit he says if you're trying to walk by the spirit and still lusting for the flesh the sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently applied to you but that means it can be just CU it's not doesn't mean it can't be he says but the worshipper once purged has no more desire of sin that was Calvary he says it isn't a place to sell flowers or a little place to do this or that it was a place where God and man were reconciled what where the two pieces went back together again where the constituent pieces of that Covenant were put and placed and ready to be delivered back to humanity he said it was the place where peace and perfect safety was brought to mankind he says can you go with me tonight my sinner friend to Calvary and by faith apply this this Blood to your own soul and let the Holy Ghost come and sanctify You by his great sacrifice he says God and man were reconciled the parts of the Covenant were put back together God's work start to finish it the working of God he says I love this he says the peace and perfect safety were brought to mankind why do I feel discouraged why do we worry why are we lacking rest and peace because we forget the work that's been done amen we forget the power of a God that says he's going to work all things for our good there's a place of perfect peace of perfect safety when we step back and we say Lord this is your work and I'm your child and I'm trusting you we can have peace in the storm he didn't say take away every storm but he says we could have peace we could only remind ourselves daily because Satan is doing everything he can to remind us of what we are in our flesh and this word is trying to remind us that we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ today with every blessing and benefit that comes with it the fruit of the spirit is what money no a job a spouse a career no fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience it's the things we need day in and day out and it's not just for us it's for the people around us I said before when I get snippety it's because my relationship is getting cold with God and I need to go back and spend some time with him it ain't his fault I'm like this it's my fault for not entering in with boldness and laying hold of what he's already done for us let's go back to Ephesians 1 as we start to close it says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe according to the working of his mighty power you know what your part is in there it's not power it's not greatness it's Faith believe I was reading a quote where brother Bram says God will do God can do anything you believe him to do that's pretty powerful it can't be contrary to his word of course but if you can believe it God can do it remember what Jesus said to the man all things have all things are possible if thou can't believe it's a scriptural thing if you can believe God will do it then God will do it if it's it's according to his word and it's not contradictory to it but where is this exceeding greatness and where is the power he says it's which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places this is where Christ sits he says far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness that filth of him that filth all in all we've said this before if Christ is the head and we are the body and it says all things are under his feet where does that put us relative to all things because if you're just the little Pinky on his foot all powers all principalities all mights all dominions are still under you if you're just that scuffed up rough piece of skin on the ball of his big toe yet every in Satan's kingdom is under you today that's where you're standing that's what the atonement did was it placed you back into your original position it made a way back for you to sit there to stand there to rest there and say I'm in in him and in him everything is under me no matter which position I'm in no matter how great I am no matter how small I am no matter how much people think of me or see of me yet everything in Satan's kingdom is under me because I'm in his body as a part of Christ he would say when Adam's race stood demons Marching In from every side prophets had failed the law had failed sacrifice of bows and lambs have failed man's nature had failed everything and Adam's little race stood defeated outnumbered by Devils Superstition sicknesses diseases there was one stepped out in heaven and said this day I'll die for Adam's race he says and he came to the Earth and was made flesh he looked right down in the midst where the midst of the spears was the darkest the very darkest of all men's dreads was death and he took death into his bosom he's relating the story of uh Arie Von Winkle Reed I think it is you know where he said I die for Switzerland he ran to the place where the spears were greatest and he impaled them and it shocked the enemy so badly and it inspired the men around them so much that they had a great Victory and they've never had a war there ever since he says Christ did that the thing that we feared most he says I'll take that he says and on Calvary he paid the sacrifice and screamed make a way for Liberty and he screams to his church take this which I have left you my blood and my spirit and fight with whatever you've got because what you've got a covenant now you've got the pieces of the Covenant you've got the blood you've got the word and you've got the spirit if you have those three he says fight with ever what you've got we can conquer tonight through that friend you can drive the devil from you every old enemy that's in your life it can be drove out by the power of the blood and the spirit of Christ and you can stand in his presence Christ made the way this is the notes that I don't have time for today is under that atonement it un locks your authority to deal with Satan as Christ did see we have the earnest of eternal life by the Holy Spirit but that means it trumps every Earnest that Satan tries to put in here what is sickness it's the down payment of death isn't it so if life is in us then death has to go we sang the song he's in the house when the Holy Spirit came back you've got the water you've got the blood now the spirit's in there then it is there to take preeminence over everything in your life and if Satan is trying to put it in then the power of God the spirit of God is there to put it out that's what the fullness of the atonement does is it restores you back to every right and every position and every blessing that you had in your origin that's what it's there for and you don't have to pull it down you don't have to wait for a super Ministry to come in you don't even have to wait for your pastor and Elder you can do it he says you he says every old enemy that's in your life it can be driven out by the blood remember brother Brandon when he would go through the prayer lines and people would come up if it wasn't under the blood what would he say make it right he says your sin can hold back your healing you know you're doing wrong confess it and he would pull that person aside and he would speak quietly to them so nobody else would know and then he'd say you and if they could make it right there then they would and then he'd pray for them but remember there was a one that came up and somebody asked brother Bram they said what was it that held him back he says I don't know it's under the blood God can't remember it a prophet sure can't see it amen you come up and you take care of that by the blood then the spirit can go to work you've got to apply the blood you've got to accept the blood but when that's done then the spirit can flow because you're in your position you're in Christ he says the sinner don't have to wonder anymore whether he can be saved or not the sick man doesn't have to wonder whether he can be healed or not the opening Veil on that day at Calvary revealed the way to Total Victory God gave us the powers of his Spirit to live triumphantly over all these things he asks us only to believe it he says that happened on that day at Calvary there never was a day like it there never will be one like it it's not necessary no more the price is paid and we are redeemed thanks be to God he says we are redeemed there's no more you have to wonder about are you wondering this morning is it for me why do they have it and I don't have it don't wonder it's for you under the atonement remember under that sacrifice when Abraham did it he had the pigeon and the dove he said it was never torn apart to show that Divine Healing has always been available salvation is available the Holy Ghost is available there's none held back to the children of God he says there's no more you have to wonder about there's no more guessing about it it's all took away the veil pulled back the curtain and were set on a highway not to wonder anymore but to believe and just walk right on he says we walk right into God's very presence amen God bless you let's stand this morning church if he has said there's a way made I want to walk in that way I don't want to sit back I don't want to hold back I want to draw near amen I want to lay hold of him I want to be in his presence I want to be under the the power and the anointing of his Spirit day in and day out I don't want to live a dead Christian life I don't want to live a formal life but I want to live amen if there's life in me then I need to be living and I want to be living and I want to see that coming out in my life amen to not sit there and just say well that's just my lot no your lot is to overcome and it's by believing in a perfect word in a perfect sacrifice that he paid a price and that price was accepted God was satisfied with it the debts been paid and under that nothing is held back from us nothing is held back and you see it on the day of Pentecost what happened nothing was held back nothing they raised the dead they healed the sick they preached the word they went through troubles they went through trials they went to prison they were delivered from prison and yet they laid down their lives willingly as well nothing was held back what was it it was the Full Sacrifice the full atonement in them they were living under the promise of a full atonement nothing held back no Bulls no Goats No beating yourselves up no wondering does he love me no wondering will he heal me no wondering will he save me he was doing it and he keeps doing it and he keeps doing it and he keeps doing it and what happened is through seven Church ages what happened we fell out of it but now we're coming right back into it and we're right back under the fullness of that atment cuz remember it's water word blood and spirit we've got a full word the blood never lost its power that means the spirit's there to enforce it what holds us back if thou can't believe all things are possible it's for me it's for you tonight amen he said it he says we walk right into God's very presence when we're in his presence brother B we talk about the unrecognized presence of God I spoke on this when I was in BC a couple months ago if we come to church and it's just church you know what we'll get church but if we come in and say we're here to meet with God it'll change everything I was talking with brother Joe yesterday and I said I've got to be very careful because what happens I'm a Groove person I get into ruts I call I don't call them ruts I call it discipline that's my spiritualizing my flaw my one flaw but see what happens is you can get so caught up in the duty of being a Christian that you forget you're supposed to be Christ that you're supposed to be led by the spirit that he's supposed to be flowing through you and so it's not just studying for service it's not just preaching but it's supposed to be the power of God that foolishness of preaching is supposed to be the power of God it's supposed to be Christ it's supposed to be the Holy Spirit speaking not a man not intellect so I've got to come that way but you've got to come in the same way that it's not going to be brother John that the holy spirit's going to speak to me and we've seen him do it but that's an everyday thing here's the thing so often we let ourselves slide and we have to go ways before we realize I'm not where I need to be and I'm talking like some big backsliding but the thing is if you're not going forward you're going backward and you start to realize I conquered this three days ago I conquered this last week I conquered this last month why is it still here it's because we've cooled off it's because we're trying to be Christians rather than just letting Christ live through US letting that Spirit flow through US amen and I'm not chastising you this morning I'm talking about myself amen but our approach our expectation is set on where our faith is amen and how do I get Faith I get Faith by reading this by hearing this by looking at this by listening to anointed men speak it and when I do that I find that all of a sudden things get a whole lot clearer things get a whole lot simpler the focus comes back the purpose comes back and the Victory comes with it because what now you're walking into his presence now you're walking on his road now you're walking his path now you're in his will and all of a sudden the things of this earth grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace amen that's what the atonement does applied daily living daily through us under that if we could see it I think we'd live in a lot more Victory I'd think we'd see listen God doesn't stop because we don't see things but I believe we'll recognize his presence and we'll recognize his moving if we're in the spirit a little more that we recognize we're Sons and Daughters of God not just in church not just because we're under the hearing or the preaching of the word but we are it because he's in us he's with us day in and day out trying to work through US amen amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord your Prophet said we live under our privileges Lord and the greatest privilege we have is knowing you lord it's being in your presence Lord It's resting under the shed blood of Calvary lord it's having a completely open word to us and your spirit inside us to Quicken it Lord It's the full work of the atonement it's all three elements Lord to bring us back into your presence to bring us back into our full position in Christ Lord your word says we're there Lord all that's lacking is Faith to believe it and act on it Lord to trust it Lord to move as we're moved Lord to be still as we're told to be still but Lord I pray if there's any holding back from your presence this morning Lord if their conscience is bothering them if their habits Lord if those things that are besetting them this morning Lord I pray that they would give it up this morning Lord that they would say there's a victory in confession Lord there's a rest under that blood where he looks at you and Lord he doesn't look at us as Sinners Lord but he sees the perfect one Lord and then he puts that very life inside of us Lord and when we run it down lord we can come and we can get filled up again Lord maybe we get cold sometimes maybe we drift away a bit but Lord your presence is always there to pull us back lord it calls us back it invites us back lord it's wooing us lord it's our lover it's our husband pulling us back to himself Lord we're so thankful for a full atonement this morning Lord that I have no sins before you Lord that I'm perfect that I'm acceptable that I'm beloved Lord in that perfect sacrifice of Christ Lord I pray we live in it I pray we rejoice in it this morning Lord I pray that we would be able to worship you and thank you for your goodness for your greatness Lord for your very presence amongst us Lord for a word that calls us back to your Perfection Lord bless us now we pray Lord there's many needs Lord I pray you give us Faith to lay hold of the word Lord the full Promises of that atonement Lord that it would take effect in our lives and bodies this day in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen I Came To Worship You 12:45 I came to work worship you I came to sing your praise I Came To Love You Lord your Holy Name to raise oh Hallelujah [Music] hallelu Lord
