[42:16] a man we want to remember everything
[42:19] we're gonna know it all but that what we
[42:21] need to know that way by the grace of
[42:24] God
[42:25] a man's abrasive evil Lord God help us
[42:27] brother is my prayer that we're going to
[42:30] be closer to him and brother just if the
[42:34] bride is experiencing anything in these
[42:36] last days it's a closer walk a man that
[42:40] we're getting closer to the Lord and
[42:41] getting closer to the resurrection than
[42:44] the others were in previous ages so god
[42:46] help us to appreciate what God has done
[42:48] that was to appreciate what God is doing
[42:51] amen brother again we're praying grace
[42:55] to God help us to get into the
[42:57] revelation of the perfect faith of
[42:59] rapturing faith amen and brother I will
[43:03] get into that eventually exactly what
[43:06] what is the attributes of perfect faith
[43:09] what are the attributes a man arrived
[43:12] free faith what are we going to
[43:13] experience what are you going to see in
[43:15] the bride a man well what you saw in the
[43:18] bridegroom you'll see in the right amen
[43:21] praise the name of the Lord too often
[43:23] people got this idea that idea this idea
[43:26] so on no no go back to the scripture and
[43:29] see what God has done and see what God
[43:31] is doing in the types in examples a man
[43:33] that our faith be in God a man that our
[43:37] faith be in the Word of God remembers
[43:40] Genesis to Revelation and he hasn't
[43:42] changed it a man he's not going to
[43:45] change it everything that God has done
[43:47] and everything that God will do and
[43:48] everything God is doing is going to be
[43:50] according to us written here in this
[43:51] book
[43:52] a man so brothers there's when it comes
[43:55] to a mystery it's the mystery of God
[43:57] revealed a man but it's revealed only to
[44:00] the elect a man even unto the
[44:03] resurrection even unto the rapture again
[44:05] as the prophet of God has said and he
[44:07] said the thing of it is they're looking
[44:08] for the resurrection looking with a
[44:10] rapture but he should they missed what
[44:12] God has done a man they think God yet
[44:15] they want God to do this Nathan want God
[44:17] to do that and they think oh this is the
[44:19] Lord this is how God's going to do it
[44:20] this is not no no God's not going to do
[44:22] it the way they think God's going to do
[44:24] it according to his word a man and the
[44:28] Lord willing we're going to bring those
[44:29] things up because I want to get into the
[44:31] revelation of the right revival a man
[44:34] and I turned it is not going to be a
[44:36] revival like they think a man and it's
[44:38] not a revival even like a lot of
[44:40] believers thing
[44:41] oh no not by any means a man the problem
[44:45] of God I lighted those things and not
[44:47] only that when it comes to the revival
[44:49] the way that man thinks of revivals and
[44:51] Holy Ghost revivals and all that he said
[44:54] he said no no he said that that's gone
[44:57] he's that's over with and he said I know
[45:00] he should they're looking for revival
[45:01] and signs and wonders revival they're
[45:03] looking for a first and a second pull
[45:05] revival but they brought that prophet of
[45:07] God is putting us through the third pull
[45:09] revival a man and what what effect we
[45:13] would have in your life what effect will
[45:15] it have in the end the life of the break
[45:16] amen
[45:17] I turned to this it's not gonna be what
[45:19] they think they met so output god help
[45:22] us to be sincere god help us to be
[45:24] serious a man that we really really want
[45:28] to be a part of the bride revival a man
[45:31] so let's make sure that whereas I have
[45:33] Saul ready preached on it we're hearing
[45:35] it and seeing it the way we should that
[45:37] we got right motives and right
[45:39] objectives a man and and brother sister
[45:41] what is it it's all based on the word a
[45:44] man it all comes from the word it all
[45:48] takes us back to the word a man and it's
[45:51] what a man is what God's looking for
[45:53] it's not what mans looking for man's
[45:55] ideas what is God's idea a man what does
[45:59] God said in his word and I don't know if
[46:02] you know this but I mentioned maybe a
[46:04] number of years ago that concerning the
[46:07] the center of the Bible of this book a
[46:10] man what is the center verse of the
[46:13] Bible what is the center of Revelation
[46:16] of the Bible is tremendous and it's in
[46:18] sums 118 and is verse 8 that is the
[46:22] middle of the Bible
[46:24] a man the number of verses before this
[46:27] is the same as the number of verses
[46:28] after this and just consider it says it
[46:32] is better what we want much better and
[46:34] it is better to trust in the Lord Amen
[46:39] them to put confidence in name praise
[46:42] the name of the Lord that's the middle
[46:45] of the Bible that is the middle
[46:47] revelation a man that God is Porteous to
[46:50] and brother are we gonna look back to
[46:51] that a man it is God getting us to trust
[46:54] in the Lord
[46:55] not by the confidence in Maine they may
[46:58] it because mean even when it comes to
[47:00] things that are religious not all let's
[47:03] trust in the Lord
[47:04] let's be spiritual not religious a man
[47:07] by the grace of Almighty God that Psalms
[47:10] 118 verse 8 a man so god help us brother
[47:14] they were going to that a man it was
[47:17] over an hour that God is looking for
[47:19] that in his people
[47:20] it's this hour a man because if we going
[47:23] to get into the resurrection the rapture
[47:25] we got to trust in the Lord amen not
[47:28] putting our confidence in man it's in
[47:30] the Lord and brother where is our faith
[47:32] in God is in the word faith comes by
[47:35] hearing hearing by the word a man thank
[47:38] God sir brother let's give God the glory

[1:01:40] so in June st. Luke's Gospel chapter 6
[1:01:43] and beginning to read at verse 40 the
[1:01:51] sable is not above his master but

[1:02:07] beam that is in thine own eye you find
[1:02:11] fault with your brother you got a bigger
[1:02:13] fault

[1:03:00] beam out of thine own eye and then thou
[1:03:03] shalt see clearly to pull out that mote
[1:03:06] that is in thy brother's eye you got to
[1:03:09] have a right attitude and a right spirit
[1:03:11] you're not seeing what's in the brother
[1:03:14] or the sister to condemn them no no so
[1:03:17] that God loves you see this and see that
[1:03:19] so you can pray for them and help them

[1:03:26] this and condemn this one see that and
[1:03:28] condemn that one and no no that's that's
[1:03:30] not God God don't do that a man so we
[1:03:33] gotta have and thus rid of the Lord look
[1:03:35] at what the Jesus did when he saw that
[1:03:38] we saw the the motes in our eyes and he
[1:03:40] saw the the sin in our lives a mayor he
[1:03:43] wasn't there to condemn us he was there
[1:03:45] to lay down his life worse a mayor and
[1:03:48] the same thing with believers today

[1:03:51] to lay down your life you're there to
[1:03:53] help you're there to encourage you're

[1:04:06] that's going in a resurrection that's
[1:04:07] the only thing that's going in a rapture
[1:04:09] is the right attitude and erase mirror a
[1:04:11] man so Jesus could have done this could
[1:04:14] have done that Tenzin's they could have
[1:04:16] called ten legions of angels to destroy
[1:04:18] the world and set him free but for your
[1:04:20] sake and my sake he stayed there amen

[1:04:25] that were being done below the cross he
[1:04:27] could have done this could have done

[1:11:23] that but they're going to do gonna sell
[1:11:25] them like that and people are going to
[1:11:26] buy them like that yet that's insanity
[1:11:28] that does just some it doesn't make
[1:11:31] sense anymore

[1:11:34] that and a lot of it is the women and at
[1:11:37] the profit of gossiped is a woman's
[1:11:38] world and then there's so skin-tight

[1:11:57] we're going to put on and when it comes
[1:11:59] to clothes brother let the Holy Ghost
[1:12:00] control us amen so proving that our
[1:12:04] house is built upon a rock a man and
[1:12:06] we're not going to stumble and fall into
[1:12:09] the foolishness of this world take your
[1:12:10] stand you go take your saying I don't
[1:12:13] care who it is even into his family or
[1:12:14] friends take your stand a man as way we
[1:12:18] have said too even to our daughter so
[1:12:19] you can't come into our house you've
[1:12:21] been raised this way you've been trained
[1:12:23] as well you know what is right and I
[1:12:25] said you can't you can't come in with a
[1:12:27] dress like that you can't come in and
[1:12:28] and we're in this stuff and all of that
[1:12:30] not know not buy anymore take your
[1:12:32] spirit and it's not you the Leafs this
[1:12:34] Christ is living in you Jesus took his
[1:12:35] name brother I wonder something how many
[1:12:39] got Jesus in them hey are you taking the
[1:12:41] same stand that Jesus took not me god
[1:12:45] help us brother amen so let's make sure
[1:12:48] make our call here actually sure make
[1:12:51] sure your house is built upon the rock
[1:12:53] of
[1:12:54] reveal word Christ and it says but he
[1:12:58] that heareth and doeth not still going
[1:13:01] to hell because what you didn't do he
[1:13:04] that hairier than do it not he's like a
[1:13:07] man he said that without a foundation
[1:13:10] building house upon the earth against
[1:13:13] which the stream did beat vehemently and
[1:13:15] immediately it fell and the rune of that
[1:13:19] house was great
[1:13:20] god bless his words or maybe seen it
[1:13:24] turn with me to Luke chapter 13 Luke
[1:13:33] chapter 13 and verse 27 and the Lord
[1:13:38] willing we after we get into these
[1:13:40] scriptures that the Lord wouldn't want I
[1:13:42] want to get into some of the quotes
[1:13:44] right here trying to bring this the
[1:13:47] sauce to a conclusion and move on to
[1:13:49] another thought concerning trying to do
[1:13:51] God a service without it being God's
[1:13:53] will aim at all but I'm believing the
[1:13:56] message but again the Provost said the
[1:13:57] message but he said you're in the
[1:13:59] message but the message is not in you a
[1:14:01] man
[1:14:02] her brother ran was experiencing that
[1:14:04] even even in the among believers if when
[1:14:07] met he might have been ministering in
[1:14:08] branham's having a call he might have
[1:14:10] been ministering in Shreveport Louisiana
[1:14:11] and again there's true to us to many
[1:14:15] that were non-denominational believers
[1:14:17] but again he knew a man they they were
[1:14:21] in the message or they were in the word
[1:14:23] but the word wasn't in them a man
[1:14:25] because if you're in the message the
[1:14:27] message controls you and if you're in
[1:14:29] the word the word controls you it's not
[1:14:31] you controlling the word it's not you
[1:14:33] bearing witness of the word by your
[1:14:34] mouth it's brothers you reflecting the
[1:14:37] word by your life a man and the greatest
[1:14:40] testimony you can give is not what you
[1:14:42] say it's what you do Amen praise the
[1:14:45] name of the Lord and God is looking at
[1:14:47] what you do
[1:14:48] God is looking at what you're doing God
[1:14:50] is looking at your actions God is
[1:14:52] looking at your reactions Amen because
[1:14:54] it'll bear witness of the anointing that
[1:14:56] you have in your life
[1:14:57] bear witness of the anointing that you
[1:14:59] have in your soul in your spirit and
[1:15:01] brother they have God in looking for
[1:15:03] looking for anything he's doing for the
[1:15:04] anointing in your soul
[1:15:05] he's looking for the anointing
[1:15:07] your your spirit a man by the grace of
[1:15:10] God on the inside of the inside again
[1:15:13] this is where father God warned us they
[1:15:15] said you can have the anointing in your
[1:15:17] flesh you can experience God in this God
[1:15:20] in that physically base if you don't
[1:15:22] have it in your heart and in your soul
[1:15:24] he said you're lost a man because God
[1:15:27] brother ain't man and doing what he did
[1:15:29] what was he doing he was providing you
[1:15:32] with the anointing and the eternal life
[1:15:34] that he was going to come into your soul
[1:15:36] amen

[1:16:02] doing it by faith a revelation out of
[1:16:05] your heart

[1:27:57] the hour that they were living amen they
[1:27:59] were satisfied with who they're
[1:28:00] satisfied with Wesley satisfied with the

[1:34:42] Jesus Lord not my will be done

[1:34:52] I pray God I can be left behind I said
[1:34:56] Lawrence getting to that place now I
[1:34:58] said I trust I said we're not there yet
[1:35:01] and I trust we'll be gone in the rapture
[1:35:03] but I said I know there's a generation
[1:35:05] going to be wondering because we're all
[1:35:06] that you're seeing out there and it's
[1:35:09] gonna strike them too late
[1:35:10] and then they'll wonder where's the
[1:35:13] rapture it's already happened he didn't
[1:35:14] know it didn't know it God sent the
[1:35:19] Prophet to let us know amen
[1:35:23] to give us the word to give us the
[1:35:25] revelation amen
[1:35:26] to give us the teaching concerning the
[1:35:28] resurrection concerning the rapture a
[1:35:30] man there are many going to get caught
[1:35:32] up with this revival caught up with that
[1:35:34] revival that revival but not the right
[1:35:35] way babe no they're not going to get
[1:35:40] caught up with the revival that's going
[1:35:41] to change us from time to eternity
[1:35:44] amen where Jesus got caught up there was
[1:35:47] a revival of the Jesus head but the
[1:35:48] disciples didn't recognize it he went to
[1:35:50] sleep and they were dopey and dozy and
[1:35:53] so on amen he says rebar take your rest
[1:35:55] because he knew that there was a time
[1:35:58] coming when they needed they would go
[1:35:59] forward amen and they would do as he did
[1:36:02] lay down their lives they ever do is he
[1:36:04] did they would drink of his cup hey man
[1:36:08] that I turned not many one drink of his
[1:36:10] cup now no no they don't want that did
[1:36:13] we want the excitement we want this we
[1:36:15] want that no no brother get it in your
[1:36:17] soul not in your flesh amen because it's
[1:36:20] the end of your flesh it's the end of
[1:36:23] this body it's good it's going to be
[1:36:24] cast down amen
[1:36:26] glory hallelujah god help us to keep
[1:36:28] looking to that dimension for a
[1:36:30] glorified body
[1:36:31] amen that we're going to turn back young
[1:36:33] again and the young ones here I'm gonna
[1:36:35] get a little holder amen by the grace of
[1:36:37] God please in the name of Jesus look for
[1:36:39] the resurrection look for the rapture
[1:36:41] because he's of the resurrection be
[1:36:43] conscious of the rapture Jesus was
[1:36:45] conscious of what lay ahead him amen and
[1:36:49] that's what he was so serious in his
[1:36:51] attitude in his spirit
[1:36:52] they were everybody wondering what's
[1:36:54] going on with Jesus you know he's not
[1:36:56] like he used to be they're gonna wonder
[1:36:59] what's going on with the believers
[1:37:00] they're not like they used to be oh they
[1:37:03] used to be this they used to be that but
[1:37:04] now they're there right really
[1:37:07] the hours come for the fulfillment of
[1:37:10] what we've been preaching be still and
[1:37:14] know that I am God amen
[1:37:21] put your trust in the Lord no confidence
[1:37:24] in me
[1:37:25] Amen all but we put confidence in this
[1:37:29] brother this brother this one this
[1:37:30] sister this no no it's him thus saith
[1:37:33] the Lord we'll get we'll get some of
[1:37:36] those eventually concerning the rapture
[1:37:38] concerning the bride amen
[1:37:41] thank you as I said I I there's certain
[1:37:42] things have been preached that I got it
[1:37:44] correct and concerning the concerning
[1:37:46] revival people are gonna get deceived oh
[1:37:51] yeah maybe so close that it would
[1:37:55] deceive the very elect if possible I
[1:37:59] pray God that is not going to deceive us
[1:38:02] it'll prove that we're elect a man that
[1:38:06] were the very elect by the grace of God
[1:38:08] ordained to the resurrection ordained
[1:38:11] for the rapture now what brother
[1:38:14] if God's waiting enough that means that
[1:38:16] we got to say what Jesus said amen when
[1:38:20] he challenged Martha I am the
[1:38:22] resurrection hey man and if he's the
[1:38:25] resurrection he's the rapture cuz he
[1:38:27] laid down his life he picked it up again
[1:38:29] amen and now brother the Saints have
[1:38:32] laid down their lives for so many years
[1:38:34] now there's a generation rising it's
[1:38:36] going to pick it up by the grace of God
[1:38:38] amen so brother it is more serious and
[1:38:42] it is really later than what many think
[1:38:46] please how much more do you want to see
[1:38:49] out there in the world Oh worse do you
[1:38:52] wanted to want to see it become what
[1:38:57] Jesus got to the place he didn't want to
[1:38:58] see anymore
[1:39:01] Tapani how long shall I be with you I'm
[1:39:04] no more in the world
[1:39:05] oh brother he went beyond that I'm no
[1:39:07] more in the world why
[1:39:09] yeah I know more in the world where are
[1:39:12] you he was closer to Eternity than he
[1:39:16] was to time a man going home going back
[1:39:21] where he come from brother but most are
[1:39:25] not recognizing the seriousness of the
[1:39:29] lateness of the hour because they're not
[1:39:32] hearing and seeing the way God wants
[1:39:36] them to hear it and see it and that's
[1:39:37] true God happens you got to hear it and
[1:39:47] see it the way God wants you to hear it
[1:39:48] and see it again concerning what our
[1:39:52] brother Mark was ministering on brother
[1:39:54] if we hear it and see it the way God
[1:39:56] wants us to hear and see it then you
[1:39:57] know oh it's the in or Finney yeah cuz
[1:40:02] he went all the way up through the
[1:40:04] through the Word of God and the plan of
[1:40:05] God the planning were at being it's not
[1:40:08] the Alpha no more steel mega yeah so we
[1:40:13] got to believe I am the resurrection and
[1:40:15] the life
[1:40:17] amen brother if he was than we are
[1:40:23] because I turned it today in Jesus
[1:40:25] prophesied in the end is the oneness
[1:40:28] between him the father and the believer
[1:40:30] and he's any prayed father that you'll
[1:40:34] show them this you'll give them this so
[1:40:36] they'll know he said that I mean you you
[1:40:38] and me and I'm in there if the father's
[1:40:41] in the Sun and the Sun is in us whatever
[1:40:44] what are we our tears to many believers
[1:40:49] are there really they don't have that
[1:40:51] experience but if the father's in the
[1:40:53] Sun and the Sun is in you then brother
[1:40:56] you're going to have the attitude and
[1:40:57] the spirit and the revelation of the Sun
[1:40:59] I am the resurrection and life brother
[1:41:05] he didn't he didn't confess this during
[1:41:07] the first two poles of his ministry but
[1:41:09] in the third pole and brother he's not
[1:41:11] confessing it now
[1:41:13] in in the first two poles of the
[1:41:14] province ministry but in the third pole
[1:41:16] a me I am the resurrection and the light
[1:41:19] and brother if he got that revelation
[1:41:22] you got
[1:41:23] amen because brother we got to have it
[1:41:26] to get out of here the dead in Christ
[1:41:29] shall rise first then we which are alive
[1:41:30] and remain shall be caught up together
[1:41:32] with them period
[1:41:35] yeah that's what it says Oh what about
[1:41:39] this what were they
[1:41:40] look God does what it what we need and
[1:41:43] it gives us the faith he's looking for
[1:41:45] that faith now a mayor is not God
[1:41:48] looking for this looking for this doctor
[1:41:49] and that doctor he's looking for the
[1:41:50] faith amen he's looking for the faith
[1:41:53] that the revealed Word was predestinated
[1:41:56] to give the endtime right a man a man
[1:41:59] and yet there are those that are
[1:42:01] rejoicing because God did this God did
[1:42:03] that yeah but God is looking for the
[1:42:05] results of it now amen
[1:42:08] God looking for the the end result
[1:42:10] because they comes by hearing and
[1:42:12] hearing by the word a man with little
[1:42:14] Luther's age Wesley sage the Pentecostal
[1:42:17] age now this age and what faith is it
[1:42:19] giving you if you ever really given your
[1:42:24] faith that pleases God then I'm no more
[1:42:29] in the world and you're gonna live like
[1:42:32] and the ambas the emphasis is going to
[1:42:35] be on the spiritual not the natural lord
[1:42:38] thank you for this thank you for that
[1:42:40] that's behind Lord amen
[1:42:41] whatever you want me to have do you can
[1:42:43] give it you know I'll help others it's
[1:42:46] like I said God can't guy can't trust
[1:42:48] everybody with with riches
[1:42:50] guy can't trust everybody with money why
[1:42:53] because they're not there to help us
[1:42:56] that's right and then buddy he bless his
[1:43:00] people with this bless his people with
[1:43:02] that why certain ones why because he
[1:43:04] knows they're here to help and they're
[1:43:07] gonna help this brother this history up
[1:43:09] this one help that one so on yeah but
[1:43:12] there's so many today they're not there
[1:43:13] to help they're looking for help they
[1:43:15] want more and they want more do this do
[1:43:18] this so on no you do it now okay so God
[1:43:23] brother go
[1:43:25] again to hear the way that God wants us
[1:43:28] to hear it and to see it the way that
[1:43:30] God wants us to see it and brother many
[1:43:32] are not hearing and seeing Malachi for
[1:43:34] the way that God wants us to hear see
[1:43:37] that's why they're going to miss the
[1:43:39] resurrection and they're going to miss
[1:43:41] the rapture and they'll be here for the
[1:43:43] tribulation the Great Tribulation amen
[1:43:46] because they are not governed by a right
[1:43:48] motive and a right objective but if
[1:43:50] you're truly born again you'll be
[1:43:52] governed by the right motive and the
[1:43:54] right objective and without the right
[1:44:02] anointing will be religious but not
[1:44:05] spiritual emotional in our flesh but not
[1:44:09] in our spirits not in our souls grace
[1:44:14] brother what is it Manny and amid vast
[1:44:18] majority of believers today are doing
[1:44:20] God a service but not according to his
[1:44:23] will
[1:44:23] amen brother got brother Brown makes
[1:44:31] certain statements in the message
[1:44:33] invisible Union brother it wasn't
[1:44:36] November the 25th 65 that he preached
[1:44:39] invisible Union in Shreveport November
[1:44:42] 27th 65 he preached doing God a service
[1:44:45] without his will in Shreveport and
[1:44:48] brother he said a lot more in Shreveport
[1:44:51] than he said when he when he preached it
[1:44:53] in Jeffersonville in July 65 oh yeah
[1:44:58] there's a lot more that's why when I was
[1:45:00] looking I like I said I was looking for
[1:45:01] certain quotes and I said oh it's doing
[1:45:03] God a server that his will I got the
[1:45:05] Jeffersonville one but it wasn't there I
[1:45:07] found it in Shreveport oh yeah there's
[1:45:11] very strong in what it what he was
[1:45:14] saying and brother they were believers
[1:45:16] there even from Jeffersonville in
[1:45:19] Shreveport at the time he wasn't just
[1:45:22] preaching to Shreveport believers be is
[1:45:24] preaching to his own believers brother
[1:45:29] it's amazing as I said that those that
[1:45:32] believe brother Brown was a prophet and
[1:45:34] yet when he preached church order many
[1:45:36] of them got up and left his church
[1:45:40] that's right and went to another church
[1:45:44] god help us as I said we have preached
[1:45:48] and preached and preached dear and
[1:45:52] well-liked one brother said when brother
[1:45:55] Gerald is finished the seats are full of
[1:45:56] blood and so on
[1:45:58] I pray grace for that brother amen they
[1:46:02] got to bring him back into the spoke and
[1:46:04] we've had a number of people get up and
[1:46:06] leave and leave the church because
[1:46:08] there's one sister said oh my she's her
[1:46:10] brother she said because of your
[1:46:11] preaching he said she said when we lead
[1:46:14] the service she said we just drive
[1:46:16] around I got to drive around and drive
[1:46:18] around and drive around she said tell
[1:46:19] tell her her husband
[1:46:21] calm down cuz he didn't like the
[1:46:23] preaching now of course not long after
[1:46:26] they left the church yeah and he moved
[1:46:29] on somewhere else and we had another
[1:46:31] couple there and they left and moved on
[1:46:33] somewhere else and there was a there was
[1:46:35] another third couple I understand they
[1:46:37] moved on to another Church yeah as I say
[1:46:40] where they go they want to go to big
[1:46:41] churches where they can hide among the
[1:46:43] trees of the garden do what they want do
[1:46:45] us right in their own eyes yeah but oh
[1:46:48] yeah
[1:46:49] and I don't doubt there's there's number
[1:46:51] of people that left bound Tabernacle yes
[1:46:53] brother Brown was preaching to her to
[1:46:55] her yeah but he knew he had to do it let
[1:47:02] me share with you well few quotes from
[1:47:08] the message doing God a surgery at his
[1:47:10] real in Shreveport we'll get more
[1:47:13] eventually listen he said no matter who
[1:47:19] we think is right
[1:47:21] God knows who's best qualified because
[1:47:25] he knows the heart of man and God's
[1:47:28] looking at your heart even now when
[1:47:30] you're receiving the word God's not
[1:47:31] looking at your face or your flesh or
[1:47:33] your mind gospel guide your heart what
[1:47:37] is your attitude toward the word in your
[1:47:39] heart that's what he sees
[1:47:43] nor does the revival nor does these
[1:47:45] things happen at the time we think they
[1:47:48] ought to happen
[1:47:49] he said it's this time right now he's a
[1:47:52] glory to God he said I noticed in our
[1:47:55] chapters and so forth of the businessman
[1:47:57] he said there's coming right away this
[1:47:59] is what they're saying
[1:48:00] he said there's coming right away
[1:48:02] Alleluia a great revival he said don't
[1:48:05] be deceived
[1:48:06] he has already come and they didn't and
[1:48:10] they did to him what was listed but he
[1:48:13] said they think there's a revival it's
[1:48:16] happening he said no he said it's done
[1:48:19] it's dead it's over he said notice he
[1:48:23] said this is lamp trimming time he said
[1:48:27] this is coming out and going in and they
[1:48:30] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:48:32] their strength his lamp trimming time
[1:48:38] but people are still looking for
[1:48:40] emotional revival not a spiritual
[1:48:43] revival and he said now notice here in
[1:48:47] our text he said David the king of
[1:48:50] Israel he was the one who got the
[1:48:52] revelation of bringing the Ark of God
[1:48:53] back to his place and they never
[1:48:56] consulted it in the days of Saul because
[1:48:59] Saul was back slid so they never
[1:49:01] consulted the Ark at all the Covenant in
[1:49:05] the days of Saul because he Bachelet and
[1:49:07] he got away from God and so he said
[1:49:10] David quickly under inspiration but
[1:49:12] notice he said it's very treacherous
[1:49:14] text if you don't get it right brother
[1:49:18] the revealed word is very treacherous if
[1:49:21] you don't get it right is there to save
[1:49:24] you or is there to judge you it'll put
[1:49:29] you in or to put you out amen
[1:49:32] now one of the prophets Edwin he said
[1:49:34] the pulpit he's in the ministry over the
[1:49:36] pulpit he's judging the people it's the
[1:49:40] word judging the people oh yeah
[1:49:44] definitely
[1:49:45] God knows your heart he said God knows
[1:49:47] your spirit and so on your action your
[1:49:49] reaction
[1:49:51] God and he said what's he what and not
[1:49:54] only that he said when you're preaching
[1:49:55] the word what are we doing he said we're
[1:49:57] casting out spirits casting out evil
[1:50:00] spirits a lot of cast o spirits out of
[1:50:03] you're out of your mind praying God
[1:50:05] they're not in your soul we have the
[1:50:06] chasm out of your soul oh yeah through
[1:50:09] the preaching of the word oh my brother
[1:50:11] amen
[1:50:13] so there's an anointing there's not a
[1:50:15] brother with with intellectual night and
[1:50:17] the boys just make and it's all natural
[1:50:20] natural no no it is brother there's
[1:50:22] something going on in another dimension
[1:50:25] a man there are spirits here in another
[1:50:28] dimension and the father gods and he
[1:50:31] said the devil is there too he said he
[1:50:32] was the first one in church
[1:50:34] yeah and the devil is here and brother
[1:50:37] Tony he's trying to influence your
[1:50:38] thoughts your mind your spirit oh yeah
[1:50:41] but he said thank God God is here and he
[1:50:44] and what to influence us through the
[1:50:46] word and the breaks are the word and the
[1:50:48] judge through the word and to cast out
[1:50:50] evil spirits that may trying to
[1:50:53] influence your thinking a man and he'll
[1:50:56] try to add to what was being preached
[1:50:58] you try to take away from what's being
[1:51:00] preached amen that's right yes the devil
[1:51:04] so let's make sure your honor the
[1:51:06] anointing of the Holy Ghost not the
[1:51:08] devil a man he said notice it's a very
[1:51:12] treacherous text if you don't get it
[1:51:14] right and I feel that the hour is coming
[1:51:16] where we should be man is to the babies
[1:51:20] amen exactly but there's lot spiritual
[1:51:23] babies
[1:51:24] oh yeah babies they want to be baby no
[1:51:28] no sorry we're not gonna baby you

[1:51:32] correct you sometimes with the word guys
[1:51:34] gonna whip you oh yes
[1:51:38] amen and he said we should have strong
[1:51:40] meat instead of milk
[1:51:43] amen and he's
[1:51:45] David king of Israel the king had just
[1:51:48] been freshly anointed the King and he
[1:51:51] said insane you annoyed him by the will
[1:51:53] of God and he was absolutely God's
[1:51:55] chosen king he said no doubt about it
[1:51:58] and he said listen God has his way of
[1:52:01] set way of doing things
[1:52:04] yeah let's do it God's Way hey man oh
[1:52:09] yeah The ministers get up preach God's
[1:52:12] Way you got to come here in God's Way
[1:52:15] our brother Bob is gonna get up and be
[1:52:17] anointed to lead a song service God's
[1:52:19] Way hey man
[1:52:21] but when I like our brother Joshua
[1:52:23] prayed or any of their brothers knew you
[1:52:25] ask up to pray they're gonna do it God's
[1:52:26] Way it's gonna be God in control a man
[1:52:29] God praying God interceding a man
[1:52:32] praise the name of the Lord go for it
[1:52:35] preach the word do it God's Way amen
[1:52:38] he said God as his own way of doing
[1:52:40] things and he said sending revivals
[1:52:44] talking speaking whatever it is he has
[1:52:48] the way of doing it and we are nobody to
[1:52:50] tell him how to do it and he see doesn't
[1:52:53] the way it pleases him and his remember
[1:52:56] the Holy Spirit can come and anoint a
[1:52:59] person and still it's out of the will of
[1:53:02] God you can be anointed with the Holy
[1:53:04] Ghost in your flesh and in your human
[1:53:06] spirit but it's not out of your soul you
[1:53:08] got it from the outside a man when you
[1:53:11] can be still out of the will of God
[1:53:13] that's right and he said we have to go
[1:53:16] through God's will and God's Way of
[1:53:19] doing it not our ways God's Way of doing
[1:53:22] it and he said David been anointed he
[1:53:26] said with the Spirit of God upon him a
[1:53:28] type of Jesus Christ but that wasn't
[1:53:33] God's channel a man he didn't consult
[1:53:37] the Prophet now he said what's closed it
[1:53:41] gets to that razor-sharp edge between
[1:53:44] right and wrong between those who are
[1:53:47] going to make it and those who don't
[1:53:48] make it it's a razor sharp edge it's a
[1:53:55] halation that many don't have today
[1:53:56] because they got their what he called
[1:53:58] the electric shavers you know but back
[1:54:01] there they had they had the
[1:54:03] old-fashioned shavers that you would
[1:54:05] shave and the blades that would go into
[1:54:07] them
[1:54:07] it's a razor-sharp edge if you got one
[1:54:14] somewhere in your home go get a blade
[1:54:16] Lord which side am I on
[1:54:20] that's how that's how that's how serious
[1:54:23] it is
[1:54:24] he said it would deceive the very elect
[1:54:26] if possible amen
[1:54:30] so he said it's a razor-sharp age now
[1:54:33] between right and wrong serious that
[1:54:45] well who's right here and who's wrong if
[1:54:50] it's a razor sharp edge which which side
[1:54:53] am I on or I'm on the right wrong side
[1:54:56] or wrong oh I believe 99.99999% the
[1:55:03] message yeah so does the devil know he
[1:55:07] believes it all but he's there to take
[1:55:09] away point zero zero zero zero zero one
[1:55:12] oh yeah had this and had that take this
[1:55:15] away take that away that's why he said
[1:55:19] it'd be so close it would deceive the
[1:55:21] very elect impossible let's make our
[1:55:25] calling and our election sure he said
[1:55:32] it's
[1:55:33] razor sharp edge - he said til it comes
[1:55:35] down sometime like a honed razor in the
[1:55:40] difference of right and wrong it's got
[1:55:42] to be of every word of God not just
[1:55:45] almost every word but every word
[1:55:48] marilla you know we got to be exactly
[1:55:52] here in the will of God according to the
[1:55:54] will of God what he's revealed in this
[1:55:56] hour and this age are we in the truth
[1:56:02] are we in the message are we in the
[1:56:03] revelation of the the mystery of the
[1:56:06] seven seals are we really in it because
[1:56:12] I tell you the end result of it all is
[1:56:14] the resurrection and the rapture is not
[1:56:17] just knowledge intellectual knowledge of
[1:56:19] this this and this no no it's the
[1:56:21] revelation it's resurrection you know I
[1:56:24] am the resurrection I'm the rapture and
[1:56:31] he said it's God
[1:56:32] today not to Lutheran's not to
[1:56:34] Methodists not to Pentecostals but to
[1:56:36] that honed age in this age where the
[1:56:40] Antichrist anointing is so perfectly it
[1:56:43] would deceive the very elect just think
[1:56:46] the Antichrist of 19 when we're in a
[1:56:53] supermarket there was one person in
[1:56:57] front of us and he paid for what he had
[1:57:05] bought well the cashier was the
[1:57:10] testimony was yeah because What did he
[1:57:16] say oh he said look this is your total
[1:57:22] is six six six oh and he sort of hinted
[1:57:29] to the man that he was going to be
[1:57:30] cursed or suffer something nice and
[1:57:37] Laura I said blessed that young man I
[1:57:40] said with a greater revelation yeah he
[1:57:44] said your your your total is six six six
[1:57:46] six dollars and sixty six cents but yet
[1:57:51] somewhere he must have known what it
[1:57:54] meant it represented so we went through
[1:57:59] I should see if you can get 777 for us
[1:58:05] okay he said but I sensed too that he
[1:58:09] had revelation so I pray God bless you
[1:58:13] amen
[1:58:14] he was a witness to that customer yeah
[1:58:19] I pray it'll cause the customer to think
[1:58:22] hey man maybe that's why God allowed him
[1:58:25] to say it
[1:58:26] praise the name of the Lord your brother
[1:58:29] sister don't let the world condemn us
[1:58:31] don't let God condemn us a man let's be
[1:58:35] in the word let's make sure you got 777
[1:58:39] out 666 our brother
[1:58:41] you're the valve has used him numbers
[1:58:44] 666 but he's careful the way he says it
[1:58:49] a man so brother the prophet of God said
[1:58:54] to that old age in this age where the
[1:58:57] Antichrist Antonius so perfectly it
[1:59:00] would deceive the very elect 'add and
[1:59:02] they'll fall on the wrong side if they
[1:59:04] don't watch it like a wedge and he said
[1:59:07] watch be careful he said we're not
[1:59:09] living in a Pentecostal age now we're
[1:59:12] past that age and he said just the same
[1:59:14] as it passed Luther and it passed the
[1:59:16] others so we are not in the Pentecostal
[1:59:19] age no no we're in the bright age and
[1:59:24] most don't recognize that no they think
[1:59:28] it were Jude
[1:59:29] well the proper God said this is the
[1:59:31] climax of the Pentecostal age yeah but
[1:59:33] the climax is the bright age because
[1:59:36] remember that the Pentecostal age when
[1:59:38] the angel when the angel came into into
[1:59:41] brendham tabernacle when the prophet of
[1:59:43] God was preaching those those series
[1:59:44] that series and he was preaching the
[1:59:46] loud of C&H and the angel came in and
[1:59:49] there was a number of people that were
[1:59:51] sitting in the audience and they saw and
[1:59:53] they saw the pillar fire came in and
[1:59:55] what did he do he went over and he drew
[1:59:58] it on the wall yeah and but the probably
[2:00:03] God said no he said when the when the
[2:00:04] angel in the pillar fire put it on the
[2:00:06] wall he said this was total darkness and
[2:00:09] he said I put that there
[2:00:11] he said to represent the elect and
[2:00:14] really really to represent the bright
[2:00:15] age amen
[2:00:17] oh yeah so the ain't when the angel did
[2:00:20] it it was all dirt why cuz Christ was on
[2:00:23] the outside Nachman a man and he and he
[2:00:27] told him if you think you're rich
[2:00:29] increase were good for that meat of
[2:00:30] nothing but he but he said you're
[2:00:32] wretched poor miserable blind and naked
[2:00:34] and don't know it
[2:00:36] if one thing to be that there's another
[2:00:38] thing not to know it oh yeah he says
[2:00:42] you're this and you don't know it you
[2:00:44] think you're this you think you're that
[2:00:45] no no he said I stand at the door knock
[2:00:48] and if any man hear my voice all come in
[2:00:50] and sup with him and he with me not the
[2:00:52] church the
[2:00:54] praise the Lord sir brother
[2:00:56] misunderstand there's nothing over there
[2:00:58] wearing that light there yeah we're not
[2:01:00] in that age we're in the right age amen
[2:01:05] the messenger knocking calling us to the
[2:01:11] revealed word and he said notice now
[2:01:14] David thought he had everything in order
[2:01:16] and he was inspired and he said Co the
[2:01:19] hook Co the holy spirit ISA can anoint a
[2:01:24] man but he says got to be in the order
[2:01:27] of the anointing and he said the outside
[2:01:29] spirit can anoint with the Holy Ghost
[2:01:31] and he said the soul as a dark as dark
[2:01:34] as pitch you can be anointed on your
[2:01:38] flesh and in your soul you can be as
[2:01:40] dark as pitch what we need is to make
[2:01:44] sure the anointing is in our soul not in
[2:01:47] our flesh that I've been born again amen
[2:01:54] many are born into a church but they're
[2:01:56] not born into the kingdom of God a man
[2:01:58] god help his brother he said the true
[2:02:07] God is there in a direct it into the
[2:02:09] word not just one place in the word but
[2:02:12] the entire word for the entire age thank
[2:02:16] God for the entire word for this age a
[2:02:18] man there with me
[2:02:21] my brethren don't you miss this and he
[2:02:26] said my sisters you want to be women
[2:02:28] preachers and so forth don't you miss
[2:02:30] this no matter how much your anointing
[2:02:33] is you've got to get in God's provided
[2:02:36] position a man and he said Davis and Ani
[2:02:40] was alright but in doing it he got
[2:02:42] enthused and he stepped over the
[2:02:45] boundary line and what did he do he
[2:02:48] stepped over the boundary line instead
[2:02:50] of putting the ark in its right original
[2:02:52] position
[2:02:53] he said he carried it on a new cart and
[2:02:55] not over the hearts of the Levites it
[2:02:58] was supposed to be carried on the
[2:03:00] shoulder of the Levites which is over
[2:03:02] the heart and he said the word is not in
[2:03:05] the mind it's in the heart amen make
[2:03:10] sure you got the message in your heart
[2:03:12] in your soul on the inside the inside
[2:03:14] not in your flesh not in your mind amen
[2:03:20] Grace and he said no matter how sincere
[2:03:25] a man may be no matter how great he's
[2:03:27] used of God no matter what he is he must
[2:03:31] be this and he sure the thing that he is
[2:03:34] speaking of must be timely by the Bible
[2:03:37] somebody say well Moses back there I
[2:03:40] know what Moses did but that's not what
[2:03:42] God's doing today
[2:03:44] he said well way back yonder thirty
[2:03:47] years ago
[2:03:47] Luther that man that might be fine but
[2:03:50] that's not what he's doing today 40
[2:03:53] years ago Pentecost that's not what he's
[2:03:55] doing today
[2:03:56] it must be timely what's he doing now
[2:03:59] he's giving us to through the mystery of
[2:04:02] God he's giving us the resurrection of
[2:04:04] the rapture
[2:04:06] hey hey hey comes by hearing hearing by
[2:04:12] the word so by the word we're getting
[2:04:14] resurrection rapture in pain
[2:04:16] and he did mention about the opening of
[2:04:19] the seven seals
[2:04:20] he said his rapturing fate give us
[2:04:23] rapturing pay why to let us know it's to
[2:04:25] him and the next thing is the rapture
[2:04:28] the resurrection a man there was Luther
[2:04:32] the next scene with Westley the next
[2:04:34] thing was the Pentecostal but now what's
[2:04:37] next it's the resurrection the rapture
[2:04:44] he said you say glory to God the Holy
[2:04:47] Ghost fell on me
[2:04:48] hallelujah just like it did under day of
[2:04:50] Pentecost but that might be different
[2:04:53] today
[2:04:54] it fell on David too and he should have
[2:04:57] fell on your Ziya but it was wrong and
[2:05:00] you've got to go deeper than that you
[2:05:04] got to go deeper than that now don't
[2:05:06] feel hurt just be reverent a man he said
[2:05:13] it must come to a man of God's choosing
[2:05:15] not a denominational choosing none of
[2:05:19] the peoples choosing but according to
[2:05:20] God's choosing and he should have it's a
[2:05:23] message from God or a great revelation
[2:05:25] from God it must come to his prophet and
[2:05:29] he said there's five things it must be
[2:05:32] number one he said it must be in season
[2:05:36] number two it must be the time God said
[2:05:41] it would be it must be written in the
[2:05:43] Word of God it must be in season of
[2:05:46] God's time by God's choosing by the
[2:05:50] grace of God
[2:05:58] amen
[2:06:05] he's warning he said this is the kind of
[2:06:10] meeting
[2:06:11] we must sit in in the future what kind
[2:06:17] of meeting was it this is like a funeral
[2:06:22] service no people don't want that no no
[2:06:29] - Leslie Singh they wanted the funeral
[2:06:31] service but you got a it gotta be a
[2:06:34] funeral service well for its the dead
[2:06:36] and dying world this is the kind of
[2:06:44] meeting we must set into the future and
[2:06:46] he was he was leading them in a in a
[2:06:49] hymn hole to God's unchanging hand bill
[2:06:54] your hopes on things eternal not natural
[2:06:57] hold to God's unchanging hand and he
[2:07:00] said when our journey is completed after
[2:07:02] God we have been true fair and bright
[2:07:05] our home and glory our enraptured social
[2:07:09] view and then he said this is the kind
[2:07:12] of meeting we must sit in the future
[2:07:13] because the people were humbled they
[2:07:15] were sincere they were repenting they

[2:08:53] established with love and sincerity a
[2:08:56] man and a men doing God a service
[2:09:00] without his will but let's make sure
[2:09:04] we're in the will of God what is the
[2:09:07] will of God we're we're in the message
[2:09:09] but make sure the message is in you and
[2:09:11] if the message is in you it'll reveal
[2:09:14] the will of God to you and the will of
[2:09:16] God is resurrection and rapturing pain
[2:09:19] it's just not coming out it's going it
[2:09:25] wasn't hard to get us out but it was
[2:09:28] hard to get it's hard to get us here I
[2:09:30] think brother Mark was touched on
[2:09:32] something on Wednesday but this thought
[2:09:35] came to me and I said yeah there's no
[2:09:39] trouble to get him out there signs there
[2:09:40] wonders and and in Egypt they did this
[2:09:43] they did this oh yeah amazing and they
[2:09:45] saw miracles done spoken word miracles
[2:09:48] this miracle that miracle and so on
[2:09:50] and they went and they sacrificed the
[2:09:54] Lambs but blood on the on the poster of
[2:09:56] their the gates going into the house and
[2:09:58] the blood on the house and so on the
[2:10:01] doors around the doors and the Death
[2:10:03] Angel came and went all through the land
[2:10:05] of Egypt smote the firstborn of the
[2:10:07] Egyptians and so on but then came the
[2:10:10] hour of deliverance and they came out
[2:10:12] and brother oh yeah and he gypsies were
[2:10:16] behind them and there was the Red Sea in
[2:10:18] front of them oh yeah and still they
[2:10:20] doubt it
[2:10:22] not all but some doubted and so on and
[2:10:24] but but God had the pillar fire between
[2:10:26] between the Jews and the Egyptians a man
[2:10:30] so that a man but give late to the to
[2:10:34] the Jews but it blinded the Egyptians
[2:10:36] because they couldn't see because of the
[2:10:39] pillar fire and the light and Soma and
[2:10:41] then God went through the serve of the
[2:10:43] Prophet and there was the Red Sea he
[2:10:45] said speak the word and what'd he do he
[2:10:47] opened up the Red Sea and they went on
[2:10:49] he went on through on dry land a man and
[2:10:52] of course the Egyptians followed him but
[2:10:54] then the the sea closed in and and they
[2:10:57] were drowned what generation are we oh
[2:11:04] yeah just they'd they tried to follow
[2:11:08] because a lot did it again that's why
[2:11:10] the prophet of God said there's make
[2:11:11] their believers make believers
[2:11:13] non-believers trust where believers not
[2:11:17] to make believer not nominally yeah but
[2:11:21] then when they came to the promised land
[2:11:23] Joshua Caleb couldn't wait to get in or
[2:11:28] they want to go but did the others no
[2:11:31] they refused the challenge of the of the
[2:11:35] promise God said every every place too
[2:11:39] full of the soldier put your trade so
[2:11:41] I'll give it to you but they didn't want
[2:11:44] to do it they wanted God to do in the
[2:11:47] promised land what he did in Egypt signs
[2:11:49] and wonders no but Joshua Keadle
[2:11:54] added the anointing of a revival that
[2:11:56] would take them in yeah but just think
[2:12:01] the revival wasn't God doing this God
[2:12:04] doing that the revival was God in Joshua
[2:12:06] Caleb possessing delay amen
[2:12:10] the revivalist Christ in the bride
[2:12:11] entering into the resurrection rapture
[2:12:15] where he's the Lord are we in the bride
[2:12:18] revival god help us brother let's just
[2:12:24] let's see it the way God wants us to see
[2:12:26] it do it the way God wants us to do it
[2:12:27] with the right motive right objective
[2:12:29] the right attitude by the grace of God
[2:12:38] he said
[2:12:44] the word and the word was in the
[2:12:46] beginning we'll go back to the beginning
[2:12:48] which is God and that day you'll know
[2:12:51] that I'm in the father the father and me
[2:12:53] I in you and you and me hallelujah he
[2:12:56] said we're here hallelujah
[2:12:58] I'm so glad to see him purse
[2:13:00] personifying himself right among us and
[2:13:03] has seen what he promised for the word
[2:13:05] not what somebody's emotions
[2:13:07] singing jumping dancing but by his word
[2:13:10] he's making himself known a man and the
[2:13:15] word he said the evening message must
[2:13:17] carry evening results and the evening
[2:13:20] message must sow evening seeds not
[2:13:23] morning seeds evening seeds and the
[2:13:26] evening time message was show evening
[2:13:28] time light and will show evening time
[2:13:30] results in the beginning and the
[2:13:34] beginning message showed the beginning
[2:13:37] results he made creation he made his son
[2:13:40] in his image and then in the midday in
[2:13:43] the evening time he made a bride for it
[2:13:45] he said what by he did it by his word
[2:13:48] how did he form the earth by his word in
[2:13:53] the beginning was the word the Word was
[2:13:54] with God and the Word was God and the
[2:13:57] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:14:00] how will he take his bride by the word
[2:14:03] not by a new cart not by some
[2:14:06] theologians idea but he'll take the
[2:14:08] bride according to his word you'll
[2:14:10] identify her
[2:14:11] don't put one thing to it don't take one
[2:14:14] thing from it leave it the way that it
[2:14:16] is the evening time he promised he'd
[2:14:20] revealed he opened the seven seals and
[2:14:23] show what them churches had missed back
[2:14:26] there revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 17
