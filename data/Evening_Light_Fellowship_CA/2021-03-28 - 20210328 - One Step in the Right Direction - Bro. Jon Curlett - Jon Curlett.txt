say amen amen praise the lord oh um i was uh this thought kept coming to me and um so i'll just hopefully i can say it right but um there was a time where i i didn't really know how to stand with healing i knew it was there for me but i just didn't know how to um how to get there and um brother ben was here for meetings and while he was preaching he just talked about how we are our fathers our fathers we are our fathers and it kind of just put me in mind of like um uh the israelites had god had given them the land and it was theirs and so they could say this is my father's land and you have to get off it wasn't necessary he's given it to me but it just he the way he said it was kind of like oh i am my father's and the devil has no place in my father's and my father's kingdom so so so if you look at yourself as gods god's land gods god's child you can say you don't belong here anymore and it just helped me um just think of it that way i wasn't really looking at you you can't really look at yourself there's nothing in yourself that you can really say but when you see yourself in god and as his then you can say no you you don't belong here and you have to there's an appointed time while you where you have to get out so anyway i don't know if that helps anybody but it kept coming to me and i thought i would share that [Music] he is drowning all my sorrow [Music] beneath the flood of peace [Music] he is shaping cries a morning [Music] to sweeping melody he is shouldering my burdens and yoking me with strength he's laughing at my troubles they're all breaking at his feet he is right here to handle a world full of care to answer the cause of my prayers he is right here he is right here to catch me as i'm letting go to grab me as i lose control he is right here he is healing all my wanderings he's bound my wayward heart he is forming past regrets to honest works of art he is working in the waiting for his glory and my good he's bringing down my mountains in ways only he could he is right here to handle a world full of care to answer the cause of my prayers he is right here he is right here to catch me as i'm letting go to grab me as i lose control he is right here cause he's big enough and i'm not too heavy yes he's big enough and i'm gonna let him carry carry me he is drowning all my sorrow beneath the flood of peace he is shaping cries of mourning [Music] to sweeping melodies he is shouldering my burdens and yoking me was straight he laughs at all my problems and they break under his feet he is right here to handle a world full of care to answer the cause of every prayer he is right here and he is right here to catch me when i finally let go and when i cannot handle her handle are you have any control he is right there to hold you through it all as he is right here to handle a world full of care to answer the cause of my prayers he is right here he is right here to catch me as i'm letting go to grab me as i lose control he is right here [Laughter] that all things are possible [Music] oh all things are [Music] possible cause jesus is here jesus is here and all things are possible because jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here and all things are possible [Music] jesus is here [Music] thank you amen praise the lord a lot of revelation in that song it's true because when he's here the devil can't stay and that's what we have to believe the only stay if we let him right so we you know the devil comes back to me every time you know it's uh if he's the first one to come into church brother branham said then we need to be conscious of that and more conscious of the presence of god because like i say god comes in here we can make the devil flee praise the lord let's uh let's sing be it unto me according to thy word brother john gets ready to come to be in prayer for him [Music] according to new york to your promises i can stand secure right upon my heart the truth that sets me [Music] free [Music] according to [Music] i can stand for you right upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to your word o lord amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] 10 [Music] me [Music] according to your promises i can stand take your heart upon my heart the truth that sets me free according to me [Music] lord we're committing this service to you lord we've done our part but lord now we're asking you to do yours yes [Music] lord we praise you we've come expecting or we've set ourselves aside but now we need you [Music] or the most difficult age we need you more than anyone's ever needed you the lord we know that you supply the remedy for every need and though we're trusting in that this morning lord trust and you'll anoint your servant anoint your word to our hearts lord each one from the pulpit all the way to the back door those that are online heavenly father may your holy spirit reach into their lives lord may your word be a dishonor of the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart this morning once again lord grace to us we pray lord just bless your servant bless your service we pray in your name we ask it amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it this morning amen god bless you if you would turning your scriptures this morning to exodus 23 exodus 23 amen praise the lord it's good to be back in church with faces that we mostly remember amen amen praise the lord it's so good to be here good to sit there and have a full song service even without words even without the words up there you can still have a tremendous song service when the people's hearts are in it amen and when god's leading amen so wonderful to be here i wasn't expecting to be up here and uh brother gerald followed up real late thursday night said uh you're preaching sunday right kind of thing and uh i said yeah i can do that but that i i didn't realize i was up so um a bit of a bit of a panic moment as there usually is but uh trusting god's grace this morning amen amen amen it's not me anyways it's got to be him so we're trusting him for the inspiration this morning amen exodus 23 says verse 25 exodus 23 25 it says and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days i will fulfill i will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and i will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee and i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite the canaanite and the hittite from before thee i will not drive them out from thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land amen you can have your seats this morning hold your bibles there we don't have the the screen this morning so you're gonna have to stay there and and follow with me as we go this morning amen for a title this morning i want to take one step in the right direction i'm in one step in the right direction and we've been talking a lot about the christian walk and and growth and maturity in the last few few months maybe the last six or eight months and then whether we talked about growing from a dormant seed that has no life in it all the way to the day-to-day perspective of walking in the light and that little bit of growth and that little bit of of movement day by day and so often as believers i feel we can get hung up on the idea that nothing's changing you know you look around and you see nothing's happening and it's the end time and i should be growing more quickly and the world is changing why am i not changing why am i not growing why am i not strengthening and you know it can get depressing sometimes because the expectations are high and you have high expectations the word is going forth you're reading your bible you're praying and the lord is calling you to things and yet sometimes you say it's not happening why is it not happening and we sit there and we kind of get down at ourselves and there's a few things that often are the cause for that and the first thing is that usually we're looking for big change right we're looking for a miracle to happen as opposed to the progressive work of character amen we're looking for god to do a sovereign work of immediacy as opposed to the slaugh the long slow grind of growth amen can you imagine if jensen decided that he wanted to be my size tomorrow amen jensen is called to be a man but jensen is not called to be a man tomorrow jensen is a man he's potentially a man everything that's in him is going to call him to be a man but he is not a man today he's got to grow into manhood amen it's not going to happen in a day and as believers it's the same thing nothing happens overnight amen so we forget that the christian walk is exactly that it is a step-by-step moment by moment day by day progression as opposed to an immediate jump from level 1 to level 100 amen we don't become great warriors of the faith in an instant generally but it's god building us up in the most holy faith and bringing us to a place where we can trust him amen the second thing is that we're looking to see it in the mirror and we're looking to see something happen somehow that we can look at it and positively identify christ in our life and i'm not saying we're waking up in the morning and looking in the mirror and saying i should see christ but my point is we're looking at ourselves in the wrong way amen we're looking at ourselves through natural eyes we're not looking at ourselves through spiritual eyes and you're going to be sadly disappointed unless you're looking in the mirror of the word so you've got to be able to look into situations you got to be able to look into your motives and your objectives sometimes rather than the results because it's going to manifest bit by bit and slowly by slowly and so you've got to be able to recognize where it's happening and it's not all going to happen at one time amen you're not going to lift 300 pounds the first day you're going to work yourself up to a bit by bit and you've got to recognize that the working is as much god as is the final result amen amen in the holy spirit does not transform our outer man it transforms our inner man and it brings our outer man subjective to it amen so we want to be looking to the inner man and seeing where the growth is not always looking to the outer man amen see that god is working on the inside first if we start out from the outside we're going into legalism that's what's happening is we're trying to modify our behavior for how people will look at us the perceptions that they have rather than the inward man which is where god looks and saying lord make a change in there so that it will come out on the outside and then people will see christ as opposed to see the the clothing of the pharisees and the sadducees the actors amen and then the third thing is that we are in expectation but we are on our own timeline and that is perhaps the biggest disappointment at times is because we know and we've been preaching many things over this pope in the last while about leaning on the promise promises of god and looking to god for great things and holding on to the word and stepping out under the word in these things and so we step out and then it doesn't happen immediately or it doesn't happen in our time or when we're expecting it but we've got to remember that god is looking at us through the eyes of eternity he's not looking at things through time he knows the beginning from the end and on that basis he's not in a hurry amen and the thing is when we look at where we want to go we have to have character to handle where we're going to be we have to have character to handle the promise that we're claiming amen god doesn't just go around willy-nilly and handing out great power and authority amen he doesn't do that rather he builds you up to it so that by the time you get to it you've got the character to handle it and now he can trust you to use it not only in your life but he can start to use it now in the body amen it's not just for yourself it's for everyone else and then so the thought is again one step in the right direction is all we're looking for we don't always want you don't win the race in the in the first step a race takes many steps amen but you've got to keep stepping you've got to keep moving forward and i wanted to start with this this very familiar example in exodus 23 this morning so if you'll you'll come back to verse 25 we want to set a bit of a tone and a context this morning about where we're going so exodus 23 25 says and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and i will take sickness away from the midst of thee now i want you to catch something here because we're talking about a physical land for a physical people but we are the spiritual seed of the very people that are claiming the promise so we've got a spiritual heritage we've got a spiritual land because we are a spiritual inheritor of what we're talking about in the scripture amen so we do have physical manifestations of the blessings of god in our life and many said i'll never see i've never seen the righteous forsaken or seed begging bread in these different things we do have a physical manifestation of god there has to be a physical manifestation of god but not just in blessings but we're looking for the spiritual heritage that he has given us today amen amen we inherit a new heaven and a new earth we're not looking for mansions here we're not looking for great wealth here it's all going to be burned we're looking to inherit what's going to come after this is burned amen so he says here you shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread now what is our bread amen the bread is the word of god amen he says i'm gonna bless that jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god so bread is required for day to day sustenance and for strength and he says i'm going to bless your bread i'm going to bless your word there is a specific word that is given for you there's a specific promise there's a specific inheritance that is given for you and i'm gonna bless that i'm not just gonna bless thee word but i'm gonna bless your word amen there is something that is for you specifically there is a position there's a place for you that is specifically for you and my word and i'm gonna bless that in your life amen is for you specifically it is thy bread is not just the bread but it is thy bread it's going to feed you it's going to grow you it's going to transform you it's going to sustain you it's going to take you to the end of your journey amen isaiah 55 11 says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void that's him blessing thy word amen your portion he says i send my word for a particular reason and it's got to come back with the reason fulfilled it doesn't come back unfulfilled the strength that it sends the revelation that it sends the purpose it sends will accomplish that which i've sent it for it says but it will accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto i sent it amen god doesn't send his word for just a nice book to read and set you to sleep every night he sends it for a purpose and it's going to achieve its purpose amen god says he will bless us with the word of god coming to pass in our lives he will take us to the place that he has promised us and in the appointed time we'll step into that promise and we will take an inheritance that he's given us amen this isn't when we're wandering in the desert this isn't when we're wondering are we called to be a child of god do we have the holy ghost no this is when we're in the promised land now he says that's when it's going to come that's when it won't return to me void it's going around and around and around but at the set moment when you're where you need to be then the word comes down and he's not going to have it thwarted or ruined by satan amen we know that healing is the children's bread amen jesus said when the woman came up to him she says i need you to heal my daughter he says no no you're not a jew that i don't give what bread to the dogs right and what was the bread it was the healing he said i don't give bread to the dogs she said yay but the dogs get the crumbs and he says i haven't seen faith like this tremendous faith and he gave her what she had need of amen it is our right to have healing and then brother tim pruitt said something very striking one time he said healing always follows the ministering of the word amen and i believe that followed jesus i believe it followed the apostles and i believe it follows the ministry even in this age amen more so in this age perhaps because this is the finality this is the fullness this is the fulfillment of the entire gentile dispensation amen so he didn't just say i would bless thy bread he says thy water now water is a requirement for life you can go without bread for a long time but you can't go without water for a long time but you can live off water for quite some time no food whatsoever if you've got fat stores depending how big you are you can live a really long time but even a regular person can live over six weeks on water alone amen but water is the answer to thirst amen and so he says what your thirst is i'm gonna bless it by giving you water to satisfy your thirst when the woman of the is at the well and he says i'll give you water that will satisfy your thirst you won't ever have to come here again she says i want that water he's saying here you want the water i'm going to give you the water i'm going to bless you with water that is pure that is clean that will save you that will clean you right this is not just any water this is pure water you know you don't want to live downstream from a slaughterhouse or a chemical factory right he says where i'm gonna settle you the water is clean there's nothing upstream to make it dirty but it's gonna give you everything that you need for life amen god promised he'd satisfy us with living water just like that woman at the well then he says i will take sickness away from the midst of thee now sickness is a reflection or a symptom of things that are out of their place or something that is not natural or native to the body coming against the body that's what sickness is something's out of order or something's in there that's not supposed to be in there amen now sickness is a symptom of a war symptoms sickness is a symptom of a war where you're fighting against something that's trying to take something in your body amen what does a virus do a virus takes your health your strength your energy your nutrients and it tries to grow itself at the expense of your body it's trying to use your body as a host to strengthen itself instead of letting your body do its natural thing which is strengthen and repair yourself and then satan's trying to do the same thing against us what's he trying to do he's trying to get you sick so that he can use your gifts he can use your mouth he can use your body he can use your life to do what grow him rather than grow the kingdom of god in your life amen but jesus or or god said to joshua here he said i will take sickness out of the midst of the amen i love how it says out of the midst of thee because what he came down and he healed our sin sick souls amen he baptizes with the holy ghost he took out the root cause that was causing all of this sickness all the pain all the suffering in the world and he satisfied that and he took it out of our life amen he healed our sin sick souls he took us out from a place of sickness and death and these different things like i said on wednesday god's forgiveness takes care of our sins they're under the blood and full healing is therefore available to every believer that comes in faith to him verse 26 says there shall nothing cast their young that means there's no miscarriages there's no stillbirths in the promised land why because what leads them into the promised land is the holy ghost amen this is the land of eternal life this is the place where the very life of god is in you and nothing that's born in that land is still born amen there's no you know you're born into the spirit and then dying off no when you're born there it is a true birth and it will hold you all the way to the day of full redemption amen it says no one will be barren unable to birth new life life begets life god begets god amen in this land gods give birth to other gods amen children of god give birth to other children of god in thy land and the number of thy days i will fulfill that means long life for us it means eternal life that's that's a really long life amen he says in the promised land is eternal life for you verse 27 i will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come and i will make all thine enemies turn their backs on thee let me put it this way sometimes we're worried about where about what we're facing or what we're going to face and then when they went into the promised land the first time 10 of the 12 had a problem with what they were facing and they turned the hearts of the children of israel to water and they turned their backs on the land and said we can't take it but he says look this time i'm going before you and i'm going to make them run away from you that's what he said turning your backs you don't turn your back on an enemy unless you're scared unless you're you're fleeing unless you're in disarray unless you're defeated and you're trying to save your life he says i'm gonna send my fear before you and destroy everyone in front of us amen his fear means his terror he will literally send a terror ahead of you and what did you see when they were going into jericho remember they when they talked to rahab and they said we're all scared after what happened at the river we saw you guys cross over in the middle of spring and now we are terrified of what's going to happen we're locked down nobody's coming in nobody's going out you guys have scared the tar out of us because they saw it wasn't the people it was god that was doing the work amen but we're talking spiritual now and the thing is what is god doing he sends a terror before you satan is going around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour why because he knows his time is short amen and he sent a terror to satan and there's demons and the very thing they're scared of is that you'll recognize who and what you are amen the very thing they're worried about is that you're going to get down on your knees and you're going to say lord i have a need and i'm believing you for it and then lord i'm stepping out on your word this morning right lord i'm stepping out on your word this week lord i'm stepping out on your word this year and i'm going to step forward no matter what's going on in front of me amen no matter what stands before me how big or small how wide how deep whatever it is i'm going to keep pressing forward because you have called me to go forward and i am going to go forward amen amen like i've said before i believe that just before we leave this earth satan will be completely powerless in the lives of the believers i don't believe there'll be a sick one among us there won't be an oppressed one there won't be a depressed one there won't be anything going on that god has not taken care of us we will stand knowing who we are and what he has given us and satan will have nothing that he can do against us amen amen i believe it the work's done the work's done we just have to take full possession of it amen verse 28 says and i will send hornets before thee which shall drive out the hivite the canaanite and the hit height from before thee but i will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee now i've spoken on this before and if they just ran through and just mowed everything down the problem was israel wasn't actually big enough to actually handle the entire land and hold it at that point right if you just go through and you knock it down and you leave a bunch of dead people there and whatnot the beasts come in the wild animals you can't hold the land there's disease there's all these different things going on you didn't want to do take over a land like that god was very strategic with this he wanted them to hold together as a group take it city by city by city and then after 10 years then it was time to go back to their initial inheritance and each one was going to take over but it was 10 years of slow work and in that time they were growing and growing this is perhaps the only time in history where an army was growing as it fought battles usually it's a war of attrition right you've got a hundred and twenty thousand they've got a hundred thousand when it's all said and done you've got twenty thousand left over and you won but israel is growing as they fight that's a beautiful thing for the bride to take heart you grow as you fight you add people you add soldiers to the army as you go and as you're going your children are going into warriors amen at the end of 10 years your kid might have only been 12 or 13 but by the end of the 10 years he was a full-blown warrior and then he had blooded himself in those battles and he had found his own victory so by the time you went to your personal portion your family was ready to fight for what was theirs as well it wasn't just a big group effort now it was now we've got a specific area for us to take and we've got grown warriors that'll handle it amen verse 30 says by little and little i will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land that's what we just talked about until you be increased until you're big enough to go take the rest of it and hold on to it we're going to keep fighting bit by bit amen amen now i want us to bring us to the other statement that we is again very well known in the scriptures where god was telling this as well before they ever went in where god was telling moses uh to tell the children of israel to follow and obey him and if they did that then they would be possessors of the land and it's deuteronomy 11 24 and i'll just read it since it's one scripture it says every place where on the souls of your foot shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness in lebanon from the river the river euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be so remember we're talking about one step in the right direction and when we see a statement like what we just read everywhere that the souls of your foot shall tread will be yours that gives us a lot of that latitude for stepping doesn't it but remember he says everywhere that you step will be yours and then he puts boundaries on it doesn't he he says it's got to be between the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river euphrates even to the sea shall your coast be so he says you've got to be between the river and the sea and then you're bounded north and south but anywhere in there you can walk around in it and it's yours so all a child of god had to do was he had to look and say am i between the river euphrates and the scene between lebanon and the desert and as long as i'm there this is mine so i can just walk around and this is mine and that's mine and that's mine and that's mine and that's mine you have a happy dance because everything you're stepping on is yours as long as you were within the boundaries that god had said amen like i've said before we only walk on our property we don't go out into satan's property do we we protect our property when he comes on we kick him out he comes on again we kick him out and we know he's going to keep doing it because he's a good enemy right brother bram said say good things about everyone he says i'll say one thing about satan he's a good enemy we know he's going to keep coming so you hold your boundary you stay in your boundaries and you have full confidence as long as you're within there and as long as you're in obedience because they had to be worshipping the one true god they couldn't be out in idolatry they couldn't be serving themselves they had to be serving a living god day by day they had to be following the feasts they had to be following the law and as long as they did that he said stay in the boundaries and you'll be good to go now this is a great thing when you're in the land of milk and honey and all the giants are dead this is a great thing to look back on but when you're standing there and nobody has actually set foot in the land yet this is a whole different kettle of fish amen it's one thing to say everywhere that the souls your foot shall tread will be yours but when you're not even in the land yet that's a whole different animal isn't it because somebody's got to be the first one to step into the land somebody's got to go in there and actually start stepping and proving this land is ours it's just a promise to that point and this is way before joshua's given the leadership it's under moses and they've got this promise hanging around for 40 years while they wander in the desert and now they're coming up and he says okay now is the time to prove this promise so turn to joshua 3 if you will because the big question was the promise was there but who was going to take the first step [Music] and we see a beautiful type in here as you're turning i want to read one quote in adoption brother braham said we have been promised the holy spirit since the beginning and jesus led us up to the promise moses was the type of christ he said but the holy spirit came as joshua to take over and lead and direct to possess the land or possess the church so joshua is a type of the holy spirit moses was a type of christ he said so we preached on this before us joshua being a type of the holy spirit in these different things but i want to just now take this as we go in joshua 3 and we're going to start at verse 1. i want you to keep this in the back your head joshua is the holy spirit because this is a physical thing but we're going to take it into the spiritual so every time we read joshua we want to read holy spirit in our head okay joshua 3 verse 1 says and joshua arose early in the morning and they removed from shittum and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over so they come right up to jordan now this is in the middle of the spring this is when the jordan is flowing its deepest and its fastest this is when the water is the roughest and it's the highest that it can be okay so they're sitting there it says and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it so what they're saying is the holy spirit if i can put it this way the holy spirit sends out a notice and it says when you see the ministry carrying the word forward follow them wherever they go don't stay where you are follow them no matter where they go okay when you see the word moving follow the word you're not following the men you're following the word but there's men carrying the word if i could correct it that way amen we're not following men we're following the word but it says when you see the word going there's people carrying it follow those people amen we talked about john the baptist last time and he was pointing to something and what was he was a messenger saying the word's going to start moving here pretty quick when it moves make sure you move with it amen verse 4 says yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2 000 cubits by measure not come come not near it that ye may know the way by which he must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore so in other words let those men lead the way let the word lead the way don't get ahead of it stay behind it and give a space for it because you don't know the way but they do they've got to figure it out and then you follow when you see that it's safe to follow them amen let me put it this way they have orders that you don't they have orders that you don't the ministry is set aside for a specific thing and that is to lead the people we've got a five-fold ministry for that is for the unifying of the people for the perfecting of the saints amen they've got orders that the people don't get but come and hear it and listen to it and follow after them amen again we're following the word we're not following people verse 5 says and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you sanctify yourself he's saying prepare yourself clean yourself up this is not a day to be dirty and this is a day to get the sin out of your life this is a day to set aside consecrate yourself don't do anything that would hinder the moving of god tomorrow and then that's pretty much everything but you see what he's doing is he's setting the expectation for what's coming right the holy spirit is joshua's saying this the holy spirit is setting the expectation he sets an atmosphere and then he tells the people to prepare for what's going to happen amen there's a preparation that goes before the moving of the word then the next day joshua starts moving and what does he say verse 6 joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people and then so the holy spirit tells the ministry pick up the word and move forward he doesn't tell him to stop he tells them just move and keep moving and keep moving and keep moving and like i said the jordan is at maximum depth here maximum height if we want to put that way it's the roughest it is all year round and he's telling them move toward the river move towards death is what he's telling them move towards death and he doesn't tell him to stop you he just says pick up the word and keep going amen but i want you to catch something here they're told to move forward to certain death and they may not actually hear the whole story because they're moving away from the people where joshua's talking but he tells them to move no matter what verse 7 then the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan. so he's told them you've got to walk into the river you don't get to stop at the edge he says you have to get your feet wet you've got to step into the raging roaring river of jordan that's your orders pick up the word and step out now they didn't get a chance to go up and down the bank looking for the best spot because they've only got orders this morning and he says go pick it up and do this they don't have all this time for preparation they've just got to literally walk step off the edge of the bank into the water and whatever happens happens and then joshua said unto the children of israel verse 9 come hither and hear the words of the lord your god and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out them before you the canaanites the hittites the hivites the parasites the gergeshites the amorites and the jebusites so this is all about confirming to them one that joshua is going to lead them that god is with him as he was with moses and two that without fail god will give them the promised land this is his first great miracle to show them god's not dead this is his first great miracle to show them that just because moses is gone doesn't mean god has left you amen i've got another man on the scene i've got another one on the scene that will follow me and i'll bring great victory through him and you can trust him to lead you all the way through this amen this is a first fruits miracle this is the first fruits miracle for joshua isn't it to prove his ministry and to prove to the people that god is with them verse 11 behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passes before you to jordan now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe of man he says look every tribe every family is going to have a witness to what's going to happen here you've got 2 million people sitting there perhaps i don't know how many went over by that point but you've got a lot of people standing there and they're watching the ministry carry the word forward to the river he says bring one from every tribe up here i want them up front to see what's going to happen here because people are going to have questions what happened what happened and he says i want to have a witness in every single one of these tribes right they're not carrying the word but they're going to witness the word moving forward amen verse 13 says and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon and heap so he says as soon as they step in there all of them all of them the feet of the priests plural you've got a bunch of them have to keep walking guys at the front have the tough job don't they they've got to go deepest amen the holy spirit's telling the ministry you got to keep walking till your feet are wet you got to put your life on the line you got to put your reputation on the line you've got to put yourself where the word is calling you to go where the lord is telling you to go you've got to go and you trust that when you step he'll do what he said he was going to do amen amen now these these priests they have a choice don't they you can walk or you can stop you can take the step in you can walk right up to jordan the water's flowing right here you can walk right up to there but will you take that one step here because everyone can walk to here it doesn't take courage to walk to here takes courage to step here amen this is not the one step that we're talking about this is the one step because you don't know if it drops off you don't know if a tree is going to come down and wipe you out you don't know what's going to happen when you step in there all you know is it's safe to hear but you've got to make a decision am i going to take that step into the water amen am i going to believe that that water is going to roll back like he said joshua said as soon as the soles of their feet hit the water the waters will roll back never happened and it's the worst time of the year to cross the jordan is it going to happen he says right i can i can guarantee you there was an intellectual battle going on as they were walking toward because guess what you didn't get to choose who carried the ark they were a set group of men they were hand-picked to carry the ark of the lord it wasn't like today bob does it and then tomorrow mark does it no it was the same group of 12 carried that arc okay they were chosen they didn't have a choice carry or no carry they carried the ark amen so now they've got to come out and they're walking and they're stepping bit by bit by bit and every step they're saying is that water going to roll back when i touch it is that water going to roll back and i touch it there's a battle there isn't there is god going to be as real as he was with moses is god still with us is god still alive was this all just a fairy tale or is he going to come out and do another miracle again amen they had to bring their intellect into submission to the promise of god to the word of god to the order of god amen they had to step into the water the supernatural would not happen until they took one step into the water they had to put it all on the line think about this if they step into that water and they lose their footing what happens to the ark of the lord gone the one thing that they value most the word of the lord if they stumble and fall if that water sweeps them away the whole thing's gone and they're never getting it back everything they want to have in their midst is going to be lost if god doesn't do a miracle amen brother braham said this in the message the prisoner he says there you are you've only got one thing to do the first step tonight surrender become a prisoner don't think of yourself for something else become a prisoner moses became a prisoner confessed he couldn't even talk finally when god got him in his hand where he could only move where god moved him where he told him the word he noted was the word that he submitted himself to the word and the holy spirit there god harnessed moses to the will of god so the first step was surrender those priests had to surrender themselves to the idea that i'm going into that water no matter what i will step into the water they had to commit themselves to it they had to say the only way we're going to cross is if i step into the water i've got to lead the way amen those men had to make that one step in the right direction they didn't get a chance to go around like i said looking for the best way across they had to trust that the way was there and when they stepped the way would come clear that the waters would part for them amen if they refused to step in god could not move i want to say that again if they refused to step in god could not move they had to obey they had to step out in obedience they had to step out in faith and only then could god make a move only then could the supernatural happen was when they allowed a supernatural need to have to come there right they had to give the opportunity for the supernatural by stepping into a place where only the supernatural could help them amen if they were going to make it across if the ark was going to be held and not lost the only way they were going to do it in obedience was if god came on the scene amen the message zacchaeus the businessman it's a beautiful quote brother brown says you know really the first step is just a little out of our reach we have to accept it by faith yeah it's just a little more than the human mind can explain you can't explain god if you do then he's no more accepted by faith you have to believe him he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him he says strange how god gets men to do things ridiculous so but you know if you're determined you want to see jesus you'll do things ridiculous if you're determined if you want to if you're really sincere if you want to really know what it's all about and then ministry is not just preaching ministry is obedience to the holy spirit ministry is leading the way when others fall back when others lack the courage to do it amen it's walking in faith trusting that god has a provided way for what you are bringing to the people amen we've got to be able to put ourselves into perceived danger when he says step forward you got to put your reputation on the line you got to put your life you got to put your testimony on the line and trust that if god has called you he will back up what he has called you to do amen amen like i said everyone comes out and they're looking at these priests and they're walking slowly towards the water carefully walking towards that water amen but i want you to put yourselves in the sandals of those priests as they're walking towards that water and they see that that water is raging and they're getting closer and nothing's happening now remember the red sea what happened the waters parted and then they went in okay this is not the same thing this is step in and the waters will roll back and then like the song not by my not by power but by my spirit right step in the waters will roll back it wasn't the waters will roll back and step in now it's step in the waters will roll back and they're getting closer and nothing is happening in fact i can pretty much guarantee that the water probably got worse because that's the way god does it doesn't he he tests your faith he riles things up so that you say i'm crazy person if i do this amen they have to put their lives on the line for this one verse 14 says and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people and as they bear the ark were coming to the jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of the harvest it says that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city adam that is beside zeratin and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho what a site that must have been they step in and the waters roll back and they don't just roll back to the bottom because that's you know that's what you'd expect the waters just go there but it says it backed it all the way up to the city of adam that's 29 kilometers away the water backed up it held steady and it just built up in a wall kind of like there was an invisible dam there and it built up for 29 kilometers back that's how long it took them to cross over built up 29 kilometers of water behind them in a big dan while they crossed over amen verse 17 says and the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan he didn't just part back the waters he made it so they could pass through him and it wasn't muddy wasn't soft it wasn't covered in debris so they couldn't cross it was dry ground and they could all pass over there was a way made where he told them there was going to be a way amen and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordans so that entire time those priests stood in the middle of the river because they kept walking to the middle they stood in the middle of the river and they held the word until everyone had crossed over to the other side you've got to stand there and you see the water building up so god's given you a miracle but now you see destruction standing there the entire time and it's getting worse and worse the longer you stay the worse the potential destruction is but they stand firm holding the word until everybody gets across and is safe on the other side every dog every cow every donkey every mom dad child every single one tense possessions everything crossed over and they're standing there watching that wall of water build up in front of them and trusting the power of the word that put them in that position to hold it until they could get to the other side amen amen i want to do a quick summary of what we've just gone through amen so we can have confidence in our leadership so we can have confidence in where we're standing and what we're claiming and what we're looking to in the word amen i want to because there's a cycle that happens here and the first thing is that the holy spirit had to lead and then god comes down but he's typed in joshua and joshua is giving the orders the holy spirit is the one that's giving the orders and the israelites did not move until joshua told them to amen the believer does not move until the holy spirit tells you to move amen now i can imagine there's some angst there because they're sitting on the banks of the jordan and first thing that's rolling your in your head is why are we crossing in the spring this is the worst time for it and then they're waiting and they're seeing the river get higher and higher and worse and worse and the angst is building up because it's saying we didn't have much of a chance to cross in the first time place but now it's worse than it ever was and now what are we supposed to do where is joshua leading us this guy couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag this guy does not have any project management skills he is not looking at what we're facing here today right why are we sitting against the river that's impossible and it's getting worse and we're not moving amen but sometimes we know that god gets things and lets them get worse why so we can fully know that it is god that made us get through it and not our own skills our own intellect our own ideas our own thoughts our own strength right even our own leadership he lets it get to the place where it takes the supernatural to move forward and we'll recognize then that god is in it and not only that god is in it but that god is with us and he has ordained it and that's why we get to go through something like this is because he has ordained it and he's made a way through it amen god does all things well and sometimes it takes chaos to teach us that god is with us that he can make peace out of a storm that he can make a way through the river when it's at its deepest amen said this he says look at it this way all too many read the bible where it says in acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and just pass right on they don't see it if they saw it now listen to this he says if they saw it by getting in the spirit they would know that if they want to receive the holy spirit they need to repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then god would be duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the holy ghost they never get in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word says he's talking about getting in the spirit we've got to be led by the holy spirit he says you've got to get in the spirit pray to god for a revelation by his spirit that's the first step get in the spirit he says let me just use another illustration suppose you need healing what does the word say well we have read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it he says did we ask god for his spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we would call the elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that now that's not the only way right we've got people believing for healing in this church and they didn't come up and get prayed for it because there is another way and that is the way of the centurion of great faith and what not right so this is not to put anyone down that has not done this that's looking for healing but he says this is the primary way right because not everybody has faith to just walk like that but for the ones that do praise the lord but he says for those that don't come this way because there's a way laid out he says he says it might not so he says we would call the elders confess our sins be anointed and pray for and that would be that it might not come immediately but in his spirit it's all over there's no other court of appeal god will fulfill his word he says all we need to get in the spirit and then things will be done don't go through the acts first get in the spirit and then go through the acts and watch what god will do amen we see the word sitting there and we say okay do it boom boom boom boom boom he says no get in the spirit so you'll know which portion is for you now here today tomorrow he says and then do what you've been revealed to do and then watch what god will do don't just go around willy-nilly like a chicken with your head cut off right go to the portion that the holy spirit is calling for you and walk on that and walk on that and walk on that until it's yours right because that's what he has anointed for you for today leave tomorrow for tomorrow do today what he's anointed for you today amen you've got to be led of god and that is through the holy spirit for the believer amen now i want you to show something in the scriptures turn to acts 16 if you will because this can be a tricky thing and it can be a very frustrating thing i have some personal experience with frustration and this would frustrate me to no end what we're going to read about here but i want you to see the the to see how the leading of god moves when you have gifts when you have callings when you're placed somewhere and things don't seem to be happening this is a a great story for those days when you're frustrated read acts 16 verse 6. this is speaking of paul of course it says now when they have gone now forgive me if i say these words wrong i'm just going to rip through them and trust that they are correct amen if anyone wants to correct me they can do so after church now when they had gone through phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia so they're walking it's too bad we don't have the thing today because i printed out or i put a map of the of the of the travel that they're going through here and they're literally walking through asia and they aren't allowed to preach the holy spirit forbids preachers to preach okay they're preachers and god's turned them into hikers and there's nothing a preacher likes more than hiking right no a preacher he preaches that's what he wants to do the calling of god is on his life to preach and if he's not preaching he's not fulfilled and he gets frustrated right and they're walking through this is the apostle paul the prophet for the age is walking through asia and the holy spirit says you can't preach here you can't do your job here and he's got to keep walking and every day they're seeing people they're seeing situations they're seeing sick people they're seeing idolaters they're seeing people that need the gospel and the holy spirit says you cannot preach here verse 7 it says after they were come to mizea they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not the holy spirit says not here either so they dip into asia if you see it kind of the way it goes is i'll draw a map by memory so you kind of got the ocean here okay like this and they're they're here and you've got bithynia and you've got asia okay and they're coming through here and they're going to here and they come up in here and the holy spirit says no they're coming to hear holy spirit says no okay this is not fun in those days they didn't have a car this is not a couple hours drive this is days and weeks of no no no no no okay preacher's not preaching prophet's not prophesying healer's not healing week after week no no no let me put it this way they had a desire to do something for god and god said no and it was a godly desire it was a good desire it was a scriptural desire but the holy spirit said no just because you want to do it just because you can place it in the word does not mean today is the day amen and there's nothing more frustrating than feeling that you're supposed to be doing something and you're not doing it amen you're walking around now you would say they're doing a lot of walking here and they are 100 out of the whole out of the leadership of the holy spirit because they're not doing their job and everywhere they go he's saying no no no no no and you'd say brothers what are you doing you're not doing your job you obviously miss the leadership of the holy spirit here they were led to go here but when they get there he says don't do anything amen verse 8 says and they passing by isaiah came down to troas and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over to macedonia and help us and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach and gospel unto them so finally they come down to here and guess what where's macedonia big mac right where they needed to be this is the shortest and easiest distance they could have come down here but there's all these islands and things down here making it difficult to get through here this is the shortest easiest route for them to get cheapest way to get there is right here the holy spirit is telling them no no no no no no until they get to here walk and walk and walk in every day no no no and then they get to there and then he gets a vision says macedonia needs you and they're right where they need to be at the exact time they need to be there having been frustrated this entire time and then they get there and there's a macedonian call comes and they said as soon as we got the vision we said surely this is finally it right verse 11. so again we'd be looking at those men saying you guys have lost it you you've gotten ahead of yourself you think you're called to all the world to preach well obviously you're not because we've got a bunch of people here that need the gospel and you're not preaching to them and now you're saying it's the holy spirit make up your mind what are you amen verse 11 says therefore leucine from troas we came with a straight course to samuthracia and the next day to neapolis so they come right over to samuthracia then they go here and they're just working their way right to where they need to be and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia in a colony and where we were in that city abiding certain days and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a riverside where prayer was want to be made and we sat down and spake unto the woman which was women which resorted there and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us now listen to this all of this frustration all of this long dusty walking leads them to this woman and it says whose heart the lord opened that she attended under the things which were spoken of paul and when she was baptized and her household she besotted saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us amen so what was it god had a person prepared to receive his word and he led those men through asia through bithynia into macedonia purely to go meet the need of the one that was ready to receive the gospel for her age all of that walking all of that frustrating all of that no no no led them exactly to where they needed to be and there they sat and stayed for a while and built up a church there and and developed the believers there in these different things amen the holy spirit took them to where the people were ready for the message that they had asia was going to get their gospel bithynia was going to get their gospel but it wasn't the time yet macedonia was ready and that's where the holy spirit took them and in all of their frustration he was taking them exactly where they needed to be this nice beautiful gentle curve right to the port of troas where they could go directly straight to where they needed to be to get where the holy spirit had moved and prepared hearts for the word that they were preaching amen and that brings me to the second point and that's that we're talking about moving in the right direction you've got to move in the right direction you can't presume that you're moving in the right direction amen what did brother brown say it meant to presume to venture without authority which is why we said you have to be led of the holy spirit because that gives you your authority and with authority now comes what the power to back up what you've been authorized to do so they have paul has full confidence now that he's where he needs to be amen so it's not enough to take a step you've got to take it in the right direction you've got to be led by the holy spirit when you're doing it amen think of it this way think about the priests that were coming to jordan with the word now can you imagine if they if they put together a conclave of priests and said joshua doesn't know what he's doing the river's getting higher we need to get out there and get this thing across before it gets so high that we can't go at all can you imagine if the ministry got together and decided on a plan of attack to go into jordan and the holy spirit hasn't told them to do it what would have happened they'd have done the exact same thing that they did before but when their hit their water the water wasn't going to roll back was it exact same action wrong time amen right time right season right direction authorized to move that's what we're looking at amen amen now i keep saying ministry because it's talking about priesthood amen but when we start talking about priests it's not just ministries that stand behind the pulpit is it we've got a high priest of the home right we've got fathers we've got husbands that have to be found in the exact same line of thinking and the exact same cycle of the moving of the holy spirit as the man behind the pulpit has to amen so don't think that this is all on brother gerald and brother jonathan tonight or this morning amen this is on every man that's sitting in this congregation to say am i being led of the holy spirit and when i am led of the holy spirit am i moving when he tells me to move where he told me to move to do what he sent me to do to believe what he said to believe and if i am then i have confidence that he is going to give the power behind his word to back it up amen amen and then after that paul he gets to macedonia okay i kind of this is funny because i imagine maybe paul wasn't frustrated i may be speaking of myself that i would have been frustrated but i tend to think they would have been frustrated you're wanting to preach the gospel and you can't but paul gets to macedonia and he's walking around remember and there's that girl with a spirit remember following him she had a spirit of divination and she's following him around and she's saying these are the the servants of god that lead you you know that to lead you to eternal life and that and she follows him for days now i would tend to think me frustrated john would have turned around and boom cast her out cast that demon right out of her but it says she followed for days and he did nothing he did nothing he let her follow him around and testify to everybody with a familiar spirit with a demon on her and he did nothing about it but then it says paul was grieved right that's the holy spirit grieving that's not just paul grieving and he turns around and he casts that demon right out of her why he was waiting for the holy spirit to authorize him to do that work amen he's fully authorized to cast out demons but he's waiting for the spirit to do it because she's testifying to them and the people trust her so he let her testify for a while and then he freed her from the very thing that god had been using for a while god had allowed that demon to testify of his servants for a while they turned around he took it right out of her in an instant amen third thing so we have the leadership of the holy spirit you have the ministry moving not just behind the pulpit but the husbands and the fathers amen then after that the people have to follow the holy ghost as it moves in their particular ministry again whether it's men behind the pulpit whether it's your husband whether it's your father these different things the people have to move as the ministry moves with the word amen that's what joshua said he said as soon as you see them move he said follow out give him a bit of space let him figure out what's supposed to happen here let him figure out where to go but when they figured it out you get in behind and you follow and go right past them to the other side amen now we're not talking nicolaianism right we're not talking about follow a man blindly we're not talking about following a ministry blindly i think some of the greatest issues we've had in the message in the past 10 years have been because people followed a ministry as opposed to the holy spirit at times they gave no allowance for a failure of a man amen right paul said in corinthians first corinthians 11 1 said be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ that's how we follow amen is as they follow christ we have confidence to follow them each one because what the ministry is going to take us into higher heights deeper depths of the word and you've got to be able to trust that the holy spirit is moving and you'll see him moving in those men in your husbands in your father's that he's going to take you to a greater place of revelation a greater place of reality a greater place of healing a greater place of resolution amen all of these things they're going to take it as brother gerald loves to say put it in the people's lap all right fathers husbands we've got to put it in our family's lap but we've got to lead the way we don't just give it we've got to lead that's how we put it in their lap as we lead and then we give them the opportunity to follow behind amen and then the fourth part is now you've got to start walking you've got to start walking on your own land amen once you're in the promised land you've got a particular portion that's there just for you joshua held the people together for 10 years but after 10 years he dispersed them and said now go and take your place and every one of us has a different place of battle amen we've got different things we're fighting the tribes were all spread out throughout is the land of canaan and every one of them face different technologies they face different terrain right they face people that had different technology different weapons different styles of warfare and every one of them had to fight based on what they were facing right i don't face the same battle that you face because i'm fighting in a different part of land it's all part of the promised land but my battle is not always the same as yours so we've all got to be able to adapt we've all got to be able to have leadership for how to defeat the enemy in our lives right we've all got particular scriptures we've all got particular methods we've got a way of praying we've got a way of seeking god some people fast some people just pray some people turn on a tape and listen to it some people go out in the wilderness right we don't all fight the same way but we've got to be led of the holy spirit on what is our land how to take it and once we've got it how to hold on to it amen it's got to go beyond the ministry that's for sure it can't just stay in a man behind a pope but it can't just stay in mommy and daddy can't just stay in papa amen it's got to go into every single member of the family amen now that's going to get pretty daunting at times isn't it we face some pretty big things haven't we brother bob cancer right i've faced it in my family not personally you face cancer we'll see if you believe everywhere that the soul of your foot shall tread right these different things that we faced before brother chad how many babies did it take brother keep pressing that's a different battle i've never struggled to have children right but sometimes there's a battle you gotta fight because he's doing what he's showing you that you've got an inheritance but it is a battle and you gotta keep moving and you gotta keep stepping and you gotta know you've gotta know that he's the one that's leading and guiding you in that i mean you've got to have a personal a personal conviction that this is him leading you and in that you'll be able to face whatever you're going through amen we've got to dwell brother brahm said you've got to get in the spirit and that is not just a great song service not even close not even close you've got to get alone with god you've got to settle down you've got to be quiet and you've got to seek him with all your heart with all your soul and say lord i need you here amen the first step is always the hardest though isn't it right because the first thing remember we read that quote brother brownie says you have to surrender the first step is surrender and surrender means i have no strength i have no input i have no thoughts and i have no ability moses signed up for a job that had a lot of talking and he couldn't talk okay what kind of idiot signs up for a job where you have a speech impediment and you're supposed to talk a lot stupid right but i i'm speaking frankly right stupid to take a job as a speaker and you can't speak very well but he surrendered to the call and then god said i'll give you a mouthpiece i'll give you somebody that can talk for you right god had a provision for the fault for the failure for the inability of moses all he was looking for was a surrendered vessel that was willing to take on the job that god had put on his shoulders amen look at david i love david because david and goliath have a chat in front of everybody so david comes up remember he comes to the army and he talks to his brothers goliath comes out and dave's like who's this and why is he still alive and they're saying have you seen the mountain of muscle standing before you he's like yeah so why is he still alive you haven't answered my question and so he's talking a big talk and he says i'll do it i'll take care of it you know just give me a second i'll take care of this so they go to saul and they say hey we've got a guy here says he can take care of this so saul brings him in and david says hey yeah he's no different than the bear and the lion that i killed and god's with me so yeah he's dead good is dead don't worry about it i'll take care of it you know but now david goes in front of the army and him and goliath have this big chat about who's going to kill who now it's all great until this point but david still has to step into range of goliath at some point right but what i love about david is david doesn't just step david runs david is so confident that god is with him that he runs into certain death he faces a man that has spent his entire life specializing in separating your head from your shoulder and he walks in with a stick some rocks and a sling and he runs towards this man why he knows that he's led to do it and he knows he's on his land and so he knows that guy has to hit the ground amen brother brown says this he says just like david with the slingshot see harnessed himself and he went down finally god had a man that was subject to him harnessed to him that could not move until the word of god moved him if people would just do that today then he was his prisoner a prisoner of love yoked up in the bond of love with god as paul was yoked up in the bond of love to god amen with surrender comes a listening ear for the holy spirit amen to what allow you to hear what the spirit is saying one ear to go in but not to go out amen it comes with it comes a humility that says lord i cannot do this the humility is in recognition that i have nothing to offer on this task in this role in this ministry in this position in whatever you call me to do i have i bring nothing to the table except a willing heart that's it because we're talking about the supernatural when we talk about the word we're talking about the supernatural and you are never going to be able to do it on your own amen amen but you've still got to be able to surrender humble yourself listen and take that step in the right direction even like we read in that quote earlier the first step is always by faith because the first step is always out of reach just a little bit do you ever see a little kid reaching for something and he's this far away from getting it and he can't get it michael you probably see it and and sammy and whatnot they're looking to get it and they just can't get it that's what he's saying here it's out of your reach you cannot get it i don't care how smart you are i can't i don't care how fast you are how strong you are how skilled you are how disciplined you are how patient you are this is going to overcome everything that you bring to the table the only way you're going to get through it is if you surrender and humble yourself to me and then you step out amen you say lord this is your doing and on that basis alone i'm taking this step because it makes no sense for me to try this on my own amen we're a crazy people to the world because we'll step out on something that they know they could never do amen we're never going to personally achieve through our own skills through our own our our own strengths what the holy spirit has called us to do through the word amen brother braham says this he says and you know it's exactly the way the word is written he says you've got to be what he says you've got to be sure it's according to the word and then the holy spirit will never go against the written word of god never ever ever somebody says that they're wrong it's just just that simply says you know it's exactly the way the word is written god is duty bound to you so he says if you know that it's exactly the way the word's written god is duty bound to you to back that up then he certainly is don't matter about that why they say to make fun of god is a jealous god remember suffering for his word's sake as growing pains of his grace this is from that message from cadre diggs amen suffering for his word's sake is growing pains of his grace when you suffer for his word's sake it's just growing pains remember we spoke last service about the honor is not in the doing it's in being chosen to do it and when god puts a difficulty in front of you when god puts a stress in front of you when god puts a situation in front of you it is his grace to say i've anointed you i've appointed you i've chosen you to go through this and it's because i know you can go through it amen and now you can walk boldly because you're stepping into something that in your own mind you would never step into in the first place and then when you start stepping into the realm of the unknown where only faith can guide you you know that it's god calling you because you'll never step there of your own free willy man and then you can come up to me and say brother jonathan this is gonna happen this is gonna happen i prayed for this we're calling for this we're expecting it and i'll say praise the lord because you're stepping into something that you would otherwise never step into you've been led and anointed to do it and now we can join together and we can do what we can praise the lord for finished work i love what ron spencer said he says don't pray for my healing he said praise god for my healing right that's the attitude we really ought to take praise the lord for what he has done if he's called us into it he's seen the end from the beginning and it's a finished work in his side and it's only up to us to to take what the trial of our faith and move through to the other side in our time amen but says the same holy spirit that led simeon led you here tonight what did the holy spirit lead simeon to the manifested word the reality of the word the fulfillment of scripture was what simeon was led to he was led to the christ the messiah the anointed one he says the same thing that led whole the same holy spirit that led simeon if i can add this in to the manifested word to the anointed word led you here tonight don't be scared to drink walk right up freely with a lot of boldness we come boldly to the throne of god for god is faithful who has promised us he says don't be scared reach up and get it it's yours he's led you right up to the fountain he says now if you're thirsty drink just drink abundance don't drink till you can't drink no more drink till you get so drunk on the salvation of god you'll not listen to the critics not listen to your feelings any symptoms you'll look to calvary and say god i want to hear the roars of calvary that's all i hear he says amen there you are i want to ask you do you have a direction from the holy spirit do you have an unction in your life do you have a word that has been quickened to you today amen do you have an answer sitting in front of you that you haven't taken yet amen you've got the word you've got the training you've got the anointing what about the first step amen one step in the right direction when god says go forward that's when you want to move that's right you don't want to wait that's right brother said by one spirit we're all baptized into a variety store and this is the variety store right here this is the variety story he says there's a whole store of things in here and every blessing and every promise in here was given to mankind that was given to mankind is for every person that's baptized into it you have the holy spirit everything in here belongs to you you don't i'm sorry you'll get some of it but not all of it amen he says just walk right up and possess yours it's yours it's yours there's no prices in here right there's no this is only for so and so it is for whosoever will if you're in the store because you are baptized into it by the spirit everything in there is a freewill gift everything that you have need of is yours there's no limitation right there's no you can only take two because we got to save some more for the other family no he says come up and drink until you're so drunk that all you hear is calvary right so you've got more than you can more than you can fill yourself with take it with you fill your pockets with it give it to your kids to take some out with you because there's an inexhaustible supply that's in the story man he says there's something up high i have to get sometimes i have to climb high to get it it's in there but you've got to climb up and get it there's a little bit of work sometimes it's a little out of my reach but i get a ladder and get to it if you know it's free and you know it's for you why would you say well i'm not going to do the work to go up and get it he says find me a ladder and go get it he says i want to see what it's all about don't you amen if the holy spirit is calling you if the holy spirit is wooing you if the holy spirit is pulling you if the holy spirit is pushing you then god has always made a provision for what he's calling for what he's offering for what he's putting in your heart to claim amen he doesn't offer you a promise that he can't fulfill amen as we read earlier god is duty bound to back his word up and guess what if it has to be supernatural so be it don't shy away because you're asking for the supernatural amen brother brahma had this beautiful quote he says where god is the supernatural takes place for he is supernatural we don't want to just focus on the natural we want to say lord supernatural you're a supernatural god guess what to god supernatural is natural right if i could put it that way it's supernatural to us but to god it's just another walk in the park it's another day at work right this is what he does he does the impossible right so it's not supernatural to him it's just the same thing that he's always done and always been and all we're saying is lord we're going to believe you for it amen i went hunting for bighorn sheep back in alberta and the area where we hunted you could only access it by foot by law so you could only hike in or you could bring in pack animals but you couldn't ride a quad an atv a dirt bike electric bike nothing like that you had to take in your own gear and so you tried to strip down every bit of extra weight out of there because you'd go in 15 20 30 kilometers into the back country and you had whatever you carried in you had to carry out plus any animals you got okay so it was a big deal to go in there amen so i didn't have a pack animal so it was all on me so my pack weighed about 70 pounds for a five-day trip and so we walked in there and we started at about 2 500 feet amen and you start the alberta's relative you know edmonton i think is about 2000 feet so we didn't hadn't come up very high we were still in the foothills and everything was easy to start you start walking drop down into a valley cross a couple rivers get your feet wet and then you slowly start to climb but it's still real gradual it's not it's not that difficult 70 pounds didn't feel like much but then you started to come into the real foothills and it started to get a little steeper you know but there came a point where we came up to the first real mountain and i've got 70 pounds on my back and i've been walking for six hours and i'm facing that mountain and i've never been to that mountain before i know i've got to get across the mountain because that's where the sheep are allegedly they weren't but we think they are and i've got to go over that mountain and i'm looking up at that mountain and i'm saying hey no sir let's go around the mountain but guess what go around the other way there's another mountain you go the other way there's another mountain right there comes a point where you got to climb the mountain if you want to get where you're going to have to go amen in total we climbed to seven thousand feet that day we went from twenty five hundred feet to seven thousand feet that's forty five hundred foot climb that's 450 stories okay i think scotiabank is what 12 15 stories so 30 scotia banks up the mountain right it's not all nice easy walking at the bottom it's brush and trees it starts with trees then it turns to brush then you start getting boulders in the brush and then after that you start to get shale right which is slippery underfoot so you got all different terrain but you still got to go up and over it because to get sheep you got to go where sheep go amen and i'd look at the bottom of that thing and i'd go ugh because we didn't just do one mountain we did multiple mountains because you're always looking for the animals and so we'd set up a camp and then we'd strip down as much of our gear as possible but i was still carrying 25 pounds of gear plus a rifle no matter where i went because you had to be able to survive if you got stuck out in the weather right and i'd look up at a hill and i mean some of these hills were so steep that as i was climbing i put my hand on the side of the mountain to hold me steady okay that's steep you can't walk up that like this you've got to go side you've got to sidestep your way up that entire mountain and you know how we got up one step at a time all i could tell myself was just go one more step toughest hunting i've ever done in my life bar none tough as hunting and it's just one step at a time one step at a time and guess what mountains i thought would take us all day we'd finish in two or three hours one step at a time and all i was saying to myself was just keep putting one foot ahead of the other one foot ahead of the other and what was i looking for i was looking to get to the mountaintop right the goal was there i could see the goal but i had to go one slogging step after another until i got to the top of that amen guess what i was committed to making it to the top i wasn't there to sit down and camp in rose weenies i was there to try and hunt sheep so i was committed to what i was doing and on that basis i said one step in front of the other they're not going to walk down so we can shoot them we got to go up to get them one step at a time amen and mountains that i thought i wouldn't climb i climbed multiples in a day because i was committed to going to the other side because what i was looking for i believe to be on the other side amen but here's the other thing you think it's tough going up a mountain one step at a time you know what the challenge is coming down the other side just one step at a time you try going up shale that's tough we'd follow where the sheep went and all you'd see is a little tiny indentation and we followed it where the sheep walk because they know where it's best to go coming down there's no such thing because we've got to go in a certain direction shale every foot step you take there's the risk of falling out from underneath you and you go tumbling all the way down thousands of feet right so the challenge now is to what hold your steps keep yourself in control as you come down and here's the thing often times when we get up on a mountaintop experience what can happen up there sometimes pry takes hold right i had something to do with this and we launch off the other side because why there's another valley we got across and there's another mountain waiting for us so we launch off the other side you know what happens is we tumble down from victory because we forgot about the god that brought us to the top in the first place amen and our biggest challenge and sometimes we take a step and we would skid for 10 or 20 or 30 feet and you're just waiting for something to grab hold so that you can stop there's it's almost like a rodeo coming down sometimes you know and you look up and i've got pictures unfortunately i only have one in here but i mean pictures where you look up and i mean it's shale and it's it's a 60 70 degree slope it's absolutely brutal right and you lived but the thing is you had to take it one step at a time because if you presumed that because you got up it you could come down it just as easily you'd end up with a broken leg or broken arm or both right and you don't want that you want to have everything available to you to cross over the next valley and climb up the next mountain amen jeremiah 29 11 says for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end i mean there's a prophesied end there's a it's not just a prediction it's a prophesy it's a guaranteed end that's what he's saying here amen an expected end when god expects things they happen that's all about god god god is an expectation based on knowledge not based on perhaps maybes when god is expecting it's because it's going to happen amen verse 12 says then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and you shall seek me not just seek me says you shall seek me and find me when when you shall search for me with all your heart amen when your total commitment is to god that's when you find him not a lackadaisical walking around in one day out the next hearing here one way the other day another way no no no when your whole heart your whole mind your whole body is centered on finding the will of god in your life that's when you're gonna find it amen when you say lord i'm living my life for you and on that basis i'm trusting you to lead me that's when god steps on amen you've got to be committed what does commitment mean taking a step in the right direction you're not committed until you start walking the way you've been talking right david wasn't committed until he ran towards goliath that's when he was committed all of that before was talk but now this was the showdown amen was will you walk out and back up the words that you've talked about will you let yourself be put in a place where god alone can save you amen one step where you're trusting solely in god to keep you that's what commitment is when you can't save yourself if it all goes wrong from that point that's what commitment is amen says god is true to his promise no matter what he has to do bankrupt the heavens before he would let his word go defeated he never made a promise that he couldn't keep i'm the lord that heals all thy diseases if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover amen if thou can't believe all things are possible i love it when sister loved when sister priscilla's saying only believe brother gerald's here we're going to sing only believe guess what we sang it again today that's why the angel loved it is because the purpose of that ministry was to get us to believe and when we sing that song with revelation it is tremendous but if we sing it by form by habit it loses everything doesn't it but when you can sing it because you've got a need in your life where only thing that is left is for you to believe in god to move that song becomes a reality in your life amen but the brahman says as you spread your faith god will let you take over the territory what he was talking about was somebody said i had a crippled arm and we prayed for it and you said i was healed and all i can move is my pinky he said so move your pinky right he says it may not be done in your body yet but he says you couldn't move your pinky yesterday so move your pinky and then the next day the next one moves and then the next one the next way he says pretty soon you'll be moving your arm he says move what god has moved on already take the healing he's given you take the step that he's given you and keep looking for the rest of it he says if it's only a pinky if it's only your little finger wave the little pinky and give god the glory for it amen he says as you spread your faith by wiggling your pinky by wiggling the little victory he says god will let you take over the territory it's yours god promised you your health again he says hallelujah why i feel good oh god spread me out he's saying i've got a crippled arm spread me out let me reach out amen footsteps is victory he told joshua everywhere the souls of your foot trod i'll give it to you footsteps was victory brother and i'll tell you today let's trod on the lands that god gave to us divine healing powers of god everything amen if the musicians would come amen he says let's trot on the lands that god gave to us let's all stand together if we would beautiful thing about taking one step is it doesn't matter where you are today it doesn't matter if you haven't given your life to the lord it doesn't matter if you haven't been baptized doesn't matter if you don't believe a thing there's always a place where one step in the right direction will bring you to a promise of god amen maybe you've been baptized and you haven't received the holy ghost there's one more step waiting for you in the right direction amen where brother brother gerald talked about he said i didn't have the holy ghost so i went and i prayed until i got it what was he doing he was showing commitment he was making steps he was stepping towards god scripture says draw near to him and he'll draw near to you right take that step toward him and say lord this is the promise i'm not calling for it of myself i'm calling for it because you said to call on my name so i'm calling on your name amen and maybe even an experienced believer god's calling you to greater heights and deeper depths you're going to have to step out in faith someday you want to see a reality of god you want to see a supernatural god it is going to require you to take a step that you have never been willing to take before amen amen i've seen in my own life stepping into ministry and every day i step up here it's a new testament faith amen but it's not just there it's as a husband it's as a father and then it's as an employee these different things we get challenges day by day and god is going to put this god is going to allow the squeeze to happen to get us to a place where we will say lord your word and your word alone is where i'm going to rest my soul i'll put my very life in your hands and i'll step where you tell me to step i'll go where you want me to go because it's all i've got left i don't want to get to a place of desperation i'd rather choose than be forced amen and that's my prayer today is that we would choose and not be forced that god would not have to pull out the whip but that he would rather be wooing us that he would be calling us to step in rather than him taking out the whip and cracking it on us a couple times to say come on son come on daughter i've got a little more for you here you don't have to dwell under that you don't have to be oppressed you don't have to deal with that habitual sin you don't have to have a relationship suffering like that right amen you don't have to have this angst in your life day in and day out you don't have to be out of fellowship these different things amen but you can have exactly what i promised but you're going to have to commit and you're going to have to commit by taking a step in the direction that i've laid on your heart amen amen let's just bow our heads together heavenly father lord it's a great comfort to hear these things in your word or but it's a tremendous challenge for our faith to take them off the pages and put them into our lives lord god [Music] lord i pray that these words would not just fall over the pulpit and land on the ground lord but that they would find lord fertile ground in the hearts in the lives of the hearers this morning lord jesus lord has you have moved on me to speak lord i'm trusting that there is one if only one to receive it and take a step towards you this morning lord god lord for whatever healing for deliverance or for salvation or for direction for confirmation or whatever you have ordained for we pray that you would give it to them this morning heavenly father lord we pray that you would just move on your people now lord as they dwell on your word or may you just bless us with your presence or to the end of the service your name we ask and pray amen leave me lord i will follow leave me lord i will go do you know what not really that's all we're singing his chorus is here yeah let's uh they said c in the book if that helps leave me lord i will follow leave me lord i will go you have called me i will answer leave me lord me lord [Music] and i will i will go i will go leave me lord [Music] i will [Music] leave me lord [Music] [Music] me [Music] for you [Music] saying my song beat unto me according to that word let's sing that again if we [Music] would according to your promises i can stand secure the truth that sets me free according to [Music] me [Music] according to your promises i can [Music] the truth that sets me free [Music] we're going to sing that a few more times but i want to give you a chance if you want to come up for prayer you got a situation if you've got a need if you just need courage you can come up for prayer this morning i was hoping brother gerald would be here he's not so it's on me i guess but if you have a need and you want to make it especially known we're going to give you an opportunity there's no pressure but if the lord is dealing with you and you say lord i need to drive an anchor lord i can't take this anymore something's on my property then i want you to come up and we'll take care of it a minute and if you don't have a need i want you to pray for those that do say lord move moving hearts moving souls change lives lord bring them to the land that you've given them okay let's sing that again according to your word according to your promises [Music] truth that sets me free [Music] according to me according to [Music] right upon my [Music] according to your [Music] lord my heart is over [Music] is [Music] amen [Music] [Music] is amen in time [Music] lord my heart is open amen won't [Music] you [Music] the window [Music] won't you come [Music] hallelujah bless the lord [Music] is [Music] amen [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] sing it again [Music] blessed lord [Music] [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] this thing changed my heart oh god praise the lord amen change my heart [Music] [Music] changed [Music] hallelujah [Music]
