knowing we give you and we will give you the glory the honor and Praises you returning back to fellowship Lord just be with us now we pray bless us with your presence through your word in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen amen thank you musicians turn if you will to Romans chapter 7. Romans chapter 7. and good to be back in the house of the Lord I'm not sure who ordered the white stuff but I guess it was inevitable that we were going to get some eventually huh amen only a little bit and they say it'll be gone hopefully by the end of the week so Hope Springs Eternal give me lots or don't give me any I don't like the back and forth amen and then certainly want to remember brother Gerald though it's it's uh you get sick when you're older and you stop eating it's serious business so we want to just pray the Lord will touch him quickly and restore them back to health and strength amen Romans chapter 7 and verse 4 says wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter amen God bless you can have your seats this evening may we want to continue our series on Redemption and we're turning another corner and I've said before we've turned corners and we we talked about the the disparity and the Fallen nature of humanity and we turn that corner and then we talked about all that Christ did and and all the sacrifices he made and the life that he gave and then we turned a corner from there and now we're we're talking about what it's supposed to do to the believer we're talking about the effects of redemption now it's not just the work that he did but but we want to see that work in action we want to see what it is that God's trying to do and what God has purpose to do in each and every one of our Lives amen because we don't want to stop at Salvation that's where so many in the world have stopped as they say well I've accepted the finished work of Calvary and therefore I his my my debts have been paid I'm no longer uh counted a sinner and that's good enough for me and they stay there and that is not what makes you a Christian is that you have your sins forgiven to be Christian means to be christ-like amen so that means you've got a life that your words are like Christ that your life is like Christ that your actions and reactions are like Christ that your attitudes that your motives your objectives all of that is like Christ that's what makes you a Christian being a Christian is not just I I've accepted the finished work of Calvary but that's where denominations preach it is that's all you need to be a Christian is except the finished work of Calvary the finished work of Calvary is not salvation the finished work of Calvary is justification which is tied to Salvation sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is a new birth that's the finished work of Calvary when you look at the whole thing because God had a purpose and a plan for it and it wasn't just to pay the debt but it was to bring you back to something that is what Redemption is is it starts with saving and it brings you back into position and relationship amen so that's what we're wanting to talk to talk about tonight and as we start to make this transition I mean as we want to talk about what happens when you say that word is for me not just the blood is for me but what that the the word that died there it had something to say to me it left something for me and that's what I'm interested in now I don't just want the the free gift of salvation but I want to move into what the word says I'm supposed to be doing amen Jesus didn't just die so our sins could be forgiven amen that had to happen so that the law could be fulfilled and so it could no longer hold us and then he was going to take us into a new law and that's what we want to preach on tonight is for a title is I want to preach on a new way of life amen and we've covered that effect of the law of Moses and we know that none of us could reach that standard none of us could live by the law of Moses and work death in us as we just read Paul preaching there he says the only thing it could do was yell at us and say you're a law breaker you're a failure you're a sinner you're incomplete you're Unholy all that's what the law could do the law condemned us it did not save us it did not redeem us it did not lift us up but it pushed us down down and we never had any hope under that law amen but the horrible thing was is whatever it said to us was true everything the law said about us was true we're horrible we're bad we're sinful we're unworthy there's nothing good in us that was what the law kept screaming at us and it was true but then Christ came and he made a remedy he was the remedy but he's made a way back amen it's not just to leave us there and take us away from from our sin debt but he took he wants to take us back to someplace else now Paul opens up as we've read in Romans 7 he said wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another we're going to touch this on the next service dying in marriage even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God I pulled out the Amplified and it says likewise my brethren you have undergone death as to the law through the crucified Body of Christ so that you may now belong to another to him who was raised from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God so in other words when Christ died Our obligation to the law died with them because he fulfilled it he took care of everything every angle every price every jot every Tittle of the law he fulfilled it by living a perfect life In the Flesh and so when he died the price was paid the law was fulfilled somebody had met the standard of the law which was live a perfect life he did that so when he did that the what Paul is saying here is that when Christ died having paid that having met the the standard of the law he was accepted as the perfect sacrifice to pay the price for the rest of us and so when he died that was done it was a finished work and he breaks Us free from the law at that point that's what happened right there now the prophet of God said now maybe and maybe now tonight you'll accept that salvation but it's already paid for the debt has been cleared up and the devil that puts you in the pawn shop Jesus came and redeemed you and opened up the doors and the only thing you have to do is walk out and claim your Liberty that's all you have a receipt from God that the debt is paid Jesus said in his last words it is finished so that means there's nothing you can add to it and there's nothing you can take away from it nothing you can do can change it you can't turn it back you can't turn back the clock you can't make it of none effect neither can you make it more effective it's done it's finished you already have the receipt saying it is finished the price is paid and then he said every Redemptive blessing was completely finished God's Great wrath on sin when he became sin for us the debt was settled so that's what happened when he died is that Our obligation to the law died with him and we died with them even even Paul says that we were in him when he died so it's all completed it's all finished so we can't be looking now to the law which is performance to make us anything good because our price is paid so the law is now null and void it has no effect the contract has been met so if we go back to Romans 7 verse 5 Paul says for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death now we're looking at the fruit of the Holy Spirit that's what we want all these different things through here but Paul says before Christ died the only thing it brought forth was death because we could never meet the standard and so we were always being pushed down down rather than lifted up amen so if we live by the Flesh and the natures of Flesh and our genetics and our human Spirit the fruit is always death remember the scripture says that there's a way that seemeth right to a man but the end thereof are the ways of death Jose doesn't say way there's one way true in light truth and life there's one but when it comes to death there's a lot of ways and man thinks up every single one of them and they find new ways to die they find new ways to leave God they find new ways to create religion they find new ways to put up barriers between them and eternal life and it just leads them to death death Death there is one way that seems right to a man and every one of us has a different idea and every one of those ways is death that's the only place it's going to take us amen doesn't matter where we were raised whether it's a Christian Home a message home whether it's out in the world it doesn't matter your ways are always going to lead to death until you come under the nature of Christ but in verse 6 he says but now we are delivered from the law so that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter so catch the wording there this this this relationship we have with the law was not a good one it says we were held we were imprisoned we were bound we were Shackled by it we were rendered ineffective by the law we were captured by it and we could do nothing about it and all it could do is tell us your unworthy unclean you're filthy you're useless you can't do anything good you're Unholy there's nothing of God in you that's what bound us up amen but praise the Lord when he came and Christ died then we have something we were delivered from it we were delivered from a performance requirement were delivered from having to do it all right not that we want to stop doing it right but it's not based on performance now we don't have to go to Christ because of our performance we come to him because we want to be like him we want to have him working through US amen that's why we're coming but we don't have to come on the basis of a good performance or a bad performance he's given us a spirit that he calls out what Abba Father daddy father and it draws us back to him regardless of our condition amen what was it it was a freedom that took condemnation and turned it into conviction because the law only condemned the law could only condemn but conviction can take you somewhere I've said this before but to put it in the perspective of a Believer condemnation is always satanic always so if you're in a place of condemnation tonight that is Satan trying to push on you that is Satan trying to hold you from from the love and the and the freedom that is in Christ tonight because condemnation tells you of the problem and it doesn't give you the solution so it's uh condemnation focuses on you so if you're looking at yourself and saying I can't do this and I can't do this or I always do this and I always do that you're in Romans 7 with Paul because that's what Paul could only say in Romans 7. I find there this law in my flesh so when I would good would do good evil is always present with me and I'm always trying to do the right thing and the wrong thing keeps happening and I always try and do the right thing and the wrong thing keeps happening and every time I go to read my Bible somebody calls me and every time I try and have devotions something pulls me away and this and that and every time I try and do something for the Lord something gets in my way Paul says we're in a battle we're in a fight and that's what condemnation does is it says you're never winning and it just keeps telling you you're never winning but that's Satan trying to keep you bound because that's what the law tried to do Satan will put you under the law every time if he can do it based on performance rather than based on the grace of God Amen condemnation reminds me it reminds you and me where you are right now today that's all it tells you this is where you're at buddy this is where you're at sister and you're no good but what does conviction do now conviction on the other one is from God because he tells you of the problem and then he points you to the word and shows you the remedy that will get you out of your problem amen conviction leads to repentance and repentance leads you to Restoration so he not only tells you the problem but he tells you the solution and he tells you I'm ready and waiting for you anytime you want to come out of this it remember it struck me so much from Brother John and he's preached on that he said if my son had only known how willing I was to forgive him he'd have come to me a long time ago that's the father he's given you a spirit that's supposed to say daddy father daddy father I'm doing wrong I can't get out of it I'm struggling I'm having issues and then he's saying well come in come in and talk to me I can help you there's a remedy come in let's talk about it let's sit down and reason together son let's come in and read them together daughter I've got something for you amen conviction reminds you of where you're supposed to be so it points to your position in Christ and then shows you the difference between that and where you're standing now so it's pointing you you're supposed to be up here but you're living down here but this is still available that's what he's letting you know this is available so let's come up a little higher and then like John let's come up a little higher into a higher plane of life into a higher plane of Revelation into a higher plane of victory of overcoming power in our lives amen that's what conviction does is it says there's a higher plane than where you're at right now and often it's because you've been there before not always but often you've been there and you've just dropped back a bit he says hey let's get back to that and then he'll take you on further then he shows you by the word amen but that that idea of conviction versus condemnation gives us this beautiful transition in Romans 7 because at the second last verse of Romans 7 Paul says who can deliver me from this body from the body of this death this natural flesh that we're in he says who can deliver me from it drives me nuts as we would say today drives me nuts it's always giving me problems who can deliver me from it sometimes we feel who can deliver me from what I'm going through in this body the constant fight the constant battle hey we're called we're we're talking about uh you know the armor of God and weapons of warfare and there's things not because we're sitting in a country cottage shipping tea as a Christian it's a battle it's a fight we got to be ready that we're gonna get knocked down from time to time that we're going to get scarred we're gonna get hurt we're going to get wounded in this because we're always in a battle even with our own flesh even if everyone around us leaves us alone we're in a battle with this flesh amen but Paul fires up in Romans 8 so he said who can deliver me from this body of death in Romans 7. and then he fires up in Romans 8 and he says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit no condemnation I wasn't making it up when I said condemnation was from Satan Paul says there's no condemnation when you're in Christ why because he'll only convict and bring you back to where you're supposed to be no condemnation because the law is dead and you're under grace and there's a sacrifice made and it's atoning for you eternally as we preached about amen it didn't say there is nothing wrong in your life see we look at that and we say that means a perfect life no that means that there's no condemnation that there's a remedy that you can go in sincerity before God and say God I'm sorry I did it and he can take away every ache every pain every guilt on your conscience you can walk away free clean not worrying right there that's where I am by God's grace when I do something wrong I go and I say Lord I'm sorry you know that my heart didn't want to do it but I did it anyways Lord forgive me for my weakness and it's usually in a moment of weakness it's usually when you're tired when you're frustrated when you've been going through things and going and going and you just slack off a little bit and Satan boom he comes in quick he knows when you're not doing so well doesn't he when you skip devotions for the day or the week when the kids have had you running around frazzled when work just has you running from Pillar To Post when the family's all up in a tizzy about something then Satan will come in you'll drop something in guess what we fail we fail but there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ he can't hold you if you're in Christ and you remember that you're in Christ amen Paul says this is this is Paul giving contrast Romans 7 who will deliver me from the body of this death and then he says there's no condemnation now Paul is showing contrast he's saying this is where I am now I used to be living in a body under death he says now there's no condemnation now no matter what this body does there's no condemnation amen he says this is where I am after Christ took me out from the law of sin and death and this is where the believer sits today amen there's nothing that should be able to hold you down when you make a mistake except your unwillingness to repent that's you that's you holding back God's not sitting there saying I won't receive him no sir that's the 17th time he did it sometimes we do it 17 times and every single time listen if he told Peter Peter said how many times do I forgive my brother by seven he said by 70 times seven if that's his if that's what he expects of us to forgive of each other then what is his willingness to forgive us when we fall over and over and over again amen there's Grace for these things amen God can't even see our sins right now so always waiting for is repentance that's the only thing required to bring you back into his presence is repentance second verse says for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death so catch that Paul says the thing that's made me free from condemnation is the law of the spirit of life and that's the law that he was under then he was under the law of sin and death now he's under the law of the spirit of life that's a swap I'd like to take that's a swap I've taken amen that I'm not driven by my own performance but now I'm living by the law of the spirit of life Paul says for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh so in other words the law couldn't achieve anything righteous because our flesh always failed us God's sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh so Christ didn't just condemn our flesh he condemned the sin itself that was registering in our flesh and he took away its power by defeating it by living a perfect life he defeated sin by showing that you could live a life without sin then he comes in verse 7 or in verse 4 he says that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in who us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so watch now Paul's starting to switch gears and he says we're not talking about the power of the flesh now which give him so many issues but he says we're talking about the power of the spirit in US for they that are after The Flesh do mine the things of the flesh very simple if you're living according to your flesh you'll focus on things that are of the flesh you'll focus on worldly things but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so if you're living by the Holy Spirit you'll focus on things that the holy spirit is interested in it's very simple it's not rocket science here he says for to be carnally minded is death remember every a man that has a way that he thinks his life in the ways thereof are the ways of death he says to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace now listen we could leave church right here and if we had a revelation of that verse we would live an overcoming Victorious peaceful life the rest of our life because when we're under what the law of the spirit of life it doesn't just give us life but Paul takes on he says and peace what are we seeking so often peace we want rest we want to be out of worry that's why we work so hard to get money so that we'll have what Financial Peace why do we eat and and try and be healthy so that we'll have physical peace and all we're looking for is peace and rest everybody wants to get to retirement don't they what's that supposedly peace and rest can I get an amen no it's a lie it's a lie it's not all peace and rest but that's where they want to get where their finances are taken care of they still have their health their marriage is hopefully intact they can take their shoes off and Dabble their toes in the in the soft sand of the of the sunny South if they want to everybody's looking for peace everybody wants rest everybody wants wants to be assured that nothing's gonna go wrong and so that's what they're looking for that's what they're striving so hard to do and usually what it does is it takes them out of the very thing they could have if they stop trying we drive ourselves into a tizzy trying to achieve the thing that we already have if we just stop trying to do it and it's no different with Christ because he is our peace he's our peace who's broken down the barrier of the wall that was between and is made two out of one and all these different things he talked about that's the United of Israel and and and the Gentiles we know but he is our peace he is our rest and if we would if we looked at that and said that to be spiritually minded is life and peace then we wouldn't walk into situations and the first thing we talk about is what circumstance the issues but rather we'd say this is what the word says about this this is what the word says about our issue this is what the word says about the problem this is what the word says he's going to do in this situation and that is our peace if we believe it whether it's sickness whether it's financial distress whether it's issues with our jobs or marriage whether it's issues in the church whatever it might be if we'd say listen I am a son and a daughter of God sons of God are led by the spirit of God my life is clear my conscience is clear that means that whatever is happening he's got a purpose in it and he's got a plan in it and that means that though I am fighting I can be at peace because I know the outcome is in his hands and he's never going to leave me he's never going to forsake me and so there's a benefit for it even in the struggle even in the trial even in the falling down in all of it amen so why don't we have it brother John because we're in the flesh and sometimes the flesh wins against the spirit doesn't take away your salvation you're still sealed your Soul's still going into eternal life that's not the problem but it's at war with the spirit the Flesh and the spirit are at enmity they're at loggerheads they keep fighting and sometimes we get tired or sometimes we just give in and the flesh wins and what do we do we step out of peace that's all very simple we just forget Who We Are and we forget who's really running the show he says it here because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be there's the battle right there what the carnal mind remember we covered that that quite a while ago and we covered the different Gates into and out of the body and the idea is that on the inner core you have the Holy Spirit in that sealed and your mind is a flap and it opens up for Faith or it closes for doubt and the idea is to open up your mind so that the faith of the word can come out of your soul and run in through your through your your inner inner members and then into your outer members and and you can have the victory that way but what happens is you lose the battle here and then what's inside can't come out and so you lose your peace that's the issue amen but notice here he didn't say that we never have a battle he never said that there wouldn't be an enemy he said there is going to be an enemy and it's in your mind and so your mind is where the battle is and that's where Satan's going to be going time and time again now he did say though that no weapon that's formed against the that's formed against you can stand it can prosper it can't do it but he didn't say there wouldn't be weapons formed against us did he no he's saying quite the opposite the weapon that's formed against you won't Prosper as long as you can stay in the spirit that's what we're striving for is to get out of our thinking and get into the word and let the word speak through US rather than reason our way through the situation or the problems that we're facing amen verse 8 says so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God so stop trying stop trying to make your acceptance in Christ based on your performance we want to do good absolutely I'm not you know me I'm not trying to tell you not to do good but I'm saying don't let your Christianity be based on how good you are or aren't doing on a particular day that doesn't change who you are doesn't change that you are Son of God doesn't change that you're a daughter of God just changes how close you are to him that's all changes how much he can use you changes how much he trusts you to do his work that's all all he's trying to do is get you to a place where you're so yielded that he can adopt you and then he can really start to use you in the Kingdom amen verse 9 says but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his if there's a big if in scripture that's it ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you this isn't just justification now it's not just sanctification remember what sanctification is cleaning out for service but if you've got the spirit then what is it doing it's filling the vessel for use now because otherwise you get into issues remember the the the the the scripture talks about what a spirit or demon will leave a man and go out and seek around for a little while then it comes back and it finds the whole place cleaned up but nothing filling it and that's what happens when you get Sanctified but you don't get filled is you're ready for service and then something will come and use you eventually if God doesn't fill it up that's why you need the new birth that's why you need the holy spirit is your life is perfectly set aside and then God doesn't do anything with it because you haven't pressed forward into the new birth how frustrating is it to be cleaned for service and to have no service to do and that's where people end up is they only get two two-thirds of the way through the three works of Grace and they never get filled and so God can't ever use them they don't come into adoption amen this is the law of the spirit of life right here if you're in the spirit he says you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you verse 10 says and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of spit of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness that's why we need a glorified body because this one can't do it it can have God inside but it can't it can't be fully defeated it's born in sin shaped in iniquity iniquity come to the world speaking lies so you need something to change and so this body's got to be glorified it's got to be changed back into the way it was supposed to be but everything else in your life can be subject to the Holy Spirit and fully Victorious according to the word of God Amen he says here in verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you that doesn't give us an excuse see see we think well this body this is this is a body of Flesh it's it's condemned there's no good thing in it no no he says listen he can still Quicken it he can still make it live according to the word he can still make it live according to the will and purpose of God but you've got to have a new birth for this to happen you can't do it on your own discipline won't get you to what he's talking about here discipline won't raise you from the dead good luck with that one you imagine trying to raise yourself from the dead by discipline and yet we do it all day long in our spiritual life I I'm speaking personally here now guess what discipline doesn't work against Satan listen he's got all the time in the world he's got all the he's got all the weapons in the world he's got all the experience in the world and I've only got 43 years of it and my discipline has a relatively short fuse compared to somebody that's had six thousand years to work on it he's going to beat me at discipline because he can outweigh me he cannot wait me he doesn't care I'm the one that gets caught up in those things discipline isn't going to raise me from the dead and discipline isn't going to make me spiritual either what does is it can facilitate that's all it is that's why you have to have your devotions that's why you need to read your Bible and pray is that you're facilitating something for God to use in your life but that doesn't make you a Christian that allows God Access into your life it shows that you're serious about what he wants to do amen sanctification is clean with purpose but you've got to get into the place where you can be used for purpose brother Bob says and now we want to see what we should do in return now in returns when Jesus died at Calvary on Calvary that day he not only paid the price for our sins but he also paid the price and made a way that we could follow him for we as the Fallen atoms that has been redeemed and as the Spirit Led Adam the first Adam by the spirit and had control of all nature then we the second atoms or the men of earth has been redeemed by Christ from the day of Calvary can follow him now when he died at Calvary he made a way he gave up the spirit the Holy Spirit and sent it back to the Earth for you and I to live by that's what Calvary means to us to follow him see the world is preaching Calvary means your sins are forgiven Prophet says no no no it's so you can follow him he gave up his place so you could come back to yours you've got to follow him and come the way he did and walk the way he did and live the way he did so you can have the same end result in the same and and the same reward that he did amen if we look at Hebrews 10 because otherwise what happens is is we end up with a clean life but an empty life and that's unfulfilled that's a horrible place to have every good intention and yet no result and that's where we end up if we don't get filled is it's an empty life because God can't take you all the way Hebrews 10 verse 12 says but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified past tense perfected past tense Sanctified this is the finished work it has a purpose to take you just beyond saving you but it's taking you now into a place where you're fit for service amen and you can't add to it or take away from it it's his work from start to finish brother Brown would say this he said the price that was paid or said the price was paid and the bondage of Satan was broke God could put back into the hands of man a way back to what he was looking for if you're happy where you're at then this isn't for you remember you've got to be looking for something more because if you're looking for something more that means there is more and that's what he's talking to he's talking about those that say there's got to be more than where I'm at today I believe that I believe there's more than where I'm at today he says he had to weep no more hit when he broke the backbone of Satan there at Calvary he broke the backbone of sin and of sickness and it brings every Mortal being on the earth back into the presence of God with sins forgiven hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more can Satan block us off from God so what holds us back from God then church if Satan can't do it then somebody else has to be doing it and it's usually right here we refuse to go in either by shame or Pride either we're we're we're so caught up in how bad we've done that we say he won't accept me or we're so caught up in how good we do we say we don't need anything else that's the only two things keep us out but a humble heart will go in time and time and time again regardless of how good or how bad they're doing in their life amen he says what there's a highway made there's a telephone sitting there there's a line to Glory brings every person in reach of that line if a man is full of sin it connected him in on Central we don't understand this these these terms today but in the old days when brother Brown was talking about this you had to place a call to a central telephone area and they would physically connect the line that you were on to the line of the person that you wanted to talk to and usually they listened in as well but they had to physically connect the lines now everything's done uh digitally you don't have to have somebody sitting there and physically doing it but they have people literally sitting there and their job was to connect telephones sister Brenda's naughty wow that's what he's saying he's saying there's a telephone sitting there and there's somebody waiting to connect your line to his Ching talk to him directly he says he can be forgiven of that sin not only that he says but that sin is paid for oh you don't have to say I'm not worthy sure you're not you never could be but a worthy one took your place you are free you don't have to wander anymore you don't have to be a pleasure-seeking man out here on the Earth isn't that what the Earth is chasing these days pleasure pleasure pleasure everything they're trying to relax they're trying to to have some enjoyment in this this world that's so chaotic and so fallen and so messed up everybody's just trying to have a good time because they're so stressed out and so neurotic in every other way he says but there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their guilty stain you don't have to be lost there is a Highway and a way and it's called the way of Holiness the unclean don't pass over it for he comes what he the unclean all of us the unclean comes through the fountain first and then he enters the highway he broke the powers of Satan he opened the prison doors of Hell to every man that was shut up in this earth in the prisons fearing that when he died what death would be to him on Calvary he opened those cell doors let every captive Go free you don't have to no longer be torn bound down by sin you don't have to no longer yield your members to sin drinking smoking gambling telling lies you can be honest just and upright and Satan can do nothing about it because you've got a hold of a line a Lifeline that's anchored in the Rock of Ages nothing can shake you from it no winds can shake you no nothing not even death itself can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ Jesus that's what Calvary meant because so many people they stop and say my sins are forgiven but they're not changed brother Branham is pointing to the scripture where it says there's a there's a way and then there's a highway and in the way is a way called holy in the middle of the road is one that's called holy and you're called to live that that means there's got to be a change like he says you got to come through a fountain you got to be washed and you got to be filled he says that's what Calvary meant not just to pay the debt but it was to take you into a way and a road always leads to somewhere there is no Road to Nowhere not on this Bible it's going to take you somewhere and it's either to life or it's going to take you to death he says men that were in bondage were set free men that were once under fear of death can no longer fear death a man who Longs for a city whose Builder and maker God he can step on the highway and set his face towards heaven because he's free Hallelujah he is redeemed he don't need to wander no more for there is a way of knowing whether you're right or not he said God gives us life our sins are gone that day at Calvary pay the price we sing that song you ask me why I'm happy and I'll just tell you why it's because my sins are gone and then he's taken me beyond my sins are gone and he's helped me to live above that place of sin he's helped me to live above my mind he's helped me to live above my flesh and he's giving me Victory along a way that is called holy because I'm wrapped in his Robes of righteousness now amen it's a different person I've come through a fountain full of blood and it's washed me clean and the washing of the word as I'm sitting in church and I'm listening and I'm reading my Bible I'm in the presence of God it starts to wash away the filth that I'm getting day to day and so I can keep walking on that Highway and I'm drawing closer and closer to the end goalie man Hebrews 10 as we continue says where whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord so catch us now we talked about the law of sin and death and then he talks about the law of the spirit of life and now he tells us what that looks like this is the new law now this is the new way it's a contract it's a commitment it's a covenant to us he says this is the Covenant I will make I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds I will write them who does that work do you see Jonathan curlette's name as an action in that verse anywhere nowhere he'll do the writing he's the one that's going to put it in my heart he's the one that's going to make me live the life because I failed so often but when he makes it a part of me then I can't deny it anymore listen remember brother Brown would say I drink as much as I want to drink so do I I gamble as much as I gamble I lie as much as I lie I waste time as much as I want to waste time why because he's writing something in my life that's pulsating out of me that's pushing out of me and it's bringing the flesh unto subjection and that's why I can live the life the way I do now because he's written something in here that I couldn't write myself we tried to do that that's what they literally did in the old days they have the phylacteries you know and they put it on their heads they write the law and they put it on their head thinking that somehow made them spiritual didn't do them any good you can't do the writing that's required to do this but when he writes it on your heart now then you can't get away from it and it's engraved it's engrafted into you and it's just something that's living out of you amen he's not taking us away from the laws he's putting the laws into us the laws were always external and you're always always trying to work unto them but now he says no what I need done what I want them to do I'm going to put it inside of them so it's a desire inside of them not just a desire to do it but a desire to be it it is them it's inside of them he says and they can't do it themselves I've got to put that desire inside of them I gotta put that will I've got to put that fight inside of them that would war against the Flesh and hold it off and win the victory ultimately amen this is living laws not legalities it's a Living Word inside of us that's what the manifestation of the sons of God is and the daughters of God is it's a Living Word inside of you and you can't stop it that's why when you do something wrong you get convicted and somebody else doesn't it's because it's a law in your heart not just something in your head and you immediately have to go make it right because it puts a separation between you and the presence of God because you have what you've contradicted the very life that's inside of you it's a beautiful thing when you say I'm not where I'm supposed to be because it means that he's writing something in your heart and it's convicting you and it's telling you you're a child of God and there's a higher plane and there's a place of Victory and there's a place of overcoming in your life verse 17 says so he says I'll put my law on their hearts and in their minds will I write them listen to this and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more you know what your part here is you have sins and you have iniquities you know his part is forget all about it you're gonna have sins you had sins you had iniquities you're going to have iniquities he says I won't remember them anymore you're under a New Covenant now I'm not going to push you down I'm not going to hold you down because of this I'm going to make a change in your life I'm going to make a living word inside of you he says now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin it was a one-time atonement as we preached over the last two Services it was an eternal atonement when Christ paid for our sins so he says he went in once and it's done completely finished it's a finished work he says now having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus where is the holiest that is the very presence of God he says having boldness to enter into the presence of God how by a New and Living Way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh so he says Paul says there's a new way and it's a living way it's not morality now it's life it's not just doing good it's being good it's not just acting like God it is being God that's what we're looking for that's what we're looking for in our lives amen it's not laws for death and punishment but it's a word inside you that makes you live because it's written on you and you can't escape it he says in having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of faith meaning Lord I believe that you've made a way I believe that the blood is still there and it still works even for me that's the full Assurance you have is that he promised there's a way made so you're coming the way he said to come having a True Heart in full Assurance sincerity honestly humbly having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure heart with pure water what's he saying don't hold back that's condemnation he says if you're convicted come in with full assurance that the forgiveness is already there and all you have to do is say your story come there knowing that he's going to make the change that you're looking for in your life amen come back and say I want restoration I want full Redemption we only have an Earnest in the Holy Spirit we ought to be crying out saying Lord give me there give me everything take us off this planet take us off this Earth take us into a new place where we don't have to fight this way anymore what's Paul saying take this New Covenant and live by that apply it live by that Covenant as tightly as they did under the law because this one has a way different effect he says in verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without faith wavering for he is faithful that promised so Paul's talking about a covenant now but this is not a new covenant this is the Covenant of Abraham if you remember because Abraham's Covenant was not Abraham if you do this then I'll do that Abraham if you live a perfect life then I'll give you the son Sarah if you always say the right thing then you'll bear the promised child no no no what was the Covenant I will I will I will I will I will write my words in their heart I will do this I will do that and where we left accepting it not fighting it and not holding us back from the very thing that he told us to do amen that's the Covenant that we always wanted that's the Covenant we always wanted it and they gave it up when they what they said don't talk to us face to face God sent it through a prophet God had to send laws then but now he comes back he says no no let's go back to the abrahamic way where I can talk to you face to face didn't that isn't that what he did to Abraham came down face to face didn't he gave him a promise and then he fulfilled a promise that's the Covenant we're looking at is what the supernatural presence of God in your life to bring to pass the very word that he gave you in the first place he starts it and then he comes in and he fulfills it inside of your life amen listen God said I will do this to Abraham and none of it was dependent on Abraham you know how I know that because the Bible tells us Abraham messed up time and time and time again he didn't leave his family and then his father father-in-law died and then he left arm went on with lot and that caused him problems and that put that that nephew into bondage then he had to go rescue that then he went out and then he he gave his wife away the first time the wife of Promise by the way gave her way and then what did God come do backed him up said you're a dead man if you marry that man's wife Lord you know I'm a righteous man doesn't matter you're dead why because I will do it you're under a covenant Abraham doesn't matter what you do I'm gonna do it Abraham comes back in cleans his act up God comes and visits him personally in his tent and then Abraham goes right back out and gives his wife away again if you're struggling today it's not going to stop God that's what I'm trying to tell you your faults your failures your flaws your genetics where you're at doesn't matter it doesn't stop God Amen God backed up Abraham time and time again even when Abraham was in the wrong because every time Abraham came back around and went back to the promised land that's how you know if you're a Son of God is you keep coming back to the promise that's how you know you're a daughter of God as you keep coming back to the promise doesn't mean you never leave it you never fail you never fall down but you keep coming back and Abraham by faith called things that were not as though they were all the way to the end until he got what it was that he was looking for amen brother Brown says now we find out after this dispensation that it lasted on that legalistic dispensation until the real Royal seed come then he took all the legalism upon himself and paid the price of redemption and God's church is back in Grace again Hallelujah he says not under the law and legalism it's under grace and what does that look like and the promise of God the true Seed of Abraham he took the law upon himself and the law nailed him to the cross of what we must do this is what he nailed listen up he nailed to the cross what we must do and must not do and must do and must not do listen carefully now this is there's depth to this he says you know the thing of it today when a sinner comes to the Lord we don't treat them like Paul did when the Philippian Jailer said what must I do to be saved what do we say You must do you must not do you must do you must not do stop drinking stop smoking stop watching TV stop going out here stop doing this that's what he's saying Christ nailed that to the cross it's not that our conduct doesn't matter it does listen there's no peace in the Middle East because of Abraham it's all his fault all his fault but that didn't stop the promise but there is a consequence to our actions God didn't say we wouldn't pay he said we would but he'll still fulfill his word regardless now listen to this he says what would we say today you got to quit smoking you got to quit drinking you got to quit doing this that wasn't what he asked he said what must I do to be saved and Paul told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ believe on the Lord Jesus Christ not come join our congregation stand up before the church and say this and we'll sprinkle you immerse you or whatever you want to do our way and if you're not in our church then he says that wasn't it he said just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy house shall be saved he told him he had to what believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he had to repent and he had to be baptized and he did all of those things but he didn't say now you get out there and you clean up your life right away mister because that's what legalism you must do you must not do listen if I know a brother's doing something he ought not to do I'll tell him that he shouldn't do it for the sake of saving him some pain but that's not going to make him a Son of God and it's not going to make him change for the rest of his life if he wants to do it he's going to do it that's just the way it is sometimes we hurt them by forcing them to do something before God has put a revelation in their heart and put the change inside of them that's what went on in the message so long is that we reformed our young people and then when they came to a test and they failed it they just fell away that's it not everyone of course everybody's got to come their way and in their time and the Lord knows these things but we can't what we can't force them into a way of life it is life and you've got to have life inside of you and they've got to have that individually for themselves brother Brown continues he says if you can believe for yourself you can believe for your house also have enough faith in God to believe for yourself then believe for your children also that same faith will save your children that saved you if you just keep praying God will answer prayer don't worry isn't that where we're at as as parents today we want our kids to have the same assurance that we have but we've got to let them come the way we came and that's by a new birth not by cracking the shell of the egg they've got to go through the hard things themselves we're there to support we're there to set an atmosphere we're there to set an example but they got to be born they got to be born we can't legalize them into a new birth he says just ask him and believe it and get it anchored in your heart just keep moving on that's the way it's done it's too late Brother John they've gone so far they're religious how many parents in the message are dealing with religious children today and you look at them and they're in church and yet you know they don't have the new birth yet that's as bad as them being out almost because what it can it can it can kind of help with their conscience they think they're in the right place and they're doing the right thing but they need that new birth or then you say brother John they're so far out so far gone can't do it it's too late we're too close to the end how can you give them a new birth this late in the game listen this was Abraham with Isaac okay the knife was he was putting everything he had into it to come down and stab his son and as it came down God stopped his hand and provided a lamp that lamb wasn't there when he was here that lamb appeared when he was right here God hasn't worked out to the second for his children he's Jehovah Jireh that Ram was not there when he started that stroke and then as soon as it came down he said hold Abraham for I know now that you love me you did what I asked you to do even to the what sacrificing of your child he says but I've made a way I provided something sometimes we're sitting there we're saying it's so late it's so late Lord it's so late how are you gonna get it done listen he's a supernatural God he can speak things into existence he can speak things out of existence we are telling a story to someone recently and it was back in Louisiana there was a sister who was on a Wednesday night and she came up for prayer for her brother that was not serving the lord and some of you know him and she came up for prayer and she was saying it's getting so late it's getting so late he needs to come to the Lord and that back home her brother was in bed in his pajamas and woke up and thought the Rapture had happened and he came running to the church in his pajamas to see if they were still there and they were and he came up and he gave his life to the Lord that service Jehovah Jireh listen he can move from anywhere he can pull from any place listen whether they're out with the pigs or whether they're in the church pew it matters not when he calls they're going to come and then when they come to their senses he'll reach out and he'll bring them back amen God's got it all worked out amen he says now we find that Abraham was just an ordinary man God called him and said that through him he was going to make him a father of Nations no matter what you do Abraham you don't have to do one thing I have done it he says Oh I like that oh I love that so well it sure Thrills my heart to think it's nothing I could do for or against if there was anything I could do I'd never get it but it's what he's done for me not what I am what he is it ain't what my promise is it's what his promise is that's the new way churches this is not it's a new law it's the law of Grace not to Grace to do whatever you want but Grace that gets you to want to be in his will and plan and purpose that's the grace is that when you don't want it he put something inside of you that wants to do it anyways that while you're yet in sin while you're at yet in trespasses while you're yet failures and flawed and all these different things that in there he puts in you a desire that pulls you into the very presence of God under the preaching of the word under the hearing of the word and what does it do it takes you and it breaks you down and you do it willingly it molds you and you do it willingly you give up your your mind you give up your ego you give up your ambition you gave up your desires you gave up your skills you gave up your education all of it to him willingly why buy Grace he's the one that called no man can call except the father calls him first and he's calling to us and that Grace To Us allows us to say Abba Father I'm your child and I'm coming to you amen does your conduct matter yes I'm not giving us a free card here today I I do anything you want to get out of jail no it has consequences everything we do has consequences and we can see the scars in our life we can see the scars in our families lives and our marriages and our children and and all the churches even of all the bad decisions we made and there is a price to pay and guess what the innocent pay they always do right but that doesn't mean he's not going to do what he said he was going to do he's still going to do it amen but we're under a covenant that is called the law of the spirit of life and God says I'm going to make it happen despite what you do but he says I really wish you'd work with me and that's what he's wanting he wants people that'll work with him to not be fighting it but he says even if you don't I'm still going to do what I said I was going to do this isn't based on your conduct it's based on me and I'm not a man that I should lie he says I'm going to do what I said I was going to do he says and all I'm doing now is working to get you realize what I'm trying to do in your life so you'll get out of my way and start working with me rather than working against me Ephesians 1 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him we're talking about the law a New and Living Way a law of Grace a law the spirit of life according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love before the world was ever created he says I've chosen the people that's going to walk before me having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of what his will his will was ever before I came into existence in this world his will will stand because his word is his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace Hallelujah but that's not it that's a start what comes after that he says wherein here the bounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself and he's shown us the mystery of his will amen not just to save us but there's more to it that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might to gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him when's the fullness of the end of times right now that's it we're at the end of the seventh age there's nothing left for Gentiles this is the dispensation of the fullness of time we're in it so there's a gathering together in one now in Christ that ought to be happening and I believe it is happening where we're taking out the big eyes and we're filling it with a bunch of little views that's what I see happening amen so it's a gathering time it's manifesting time he said in whom also we have obtained an inheritance so we have say something waiting for us not just what we have now but there's more to come being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so what's the problem church I read that and I say whoa there's a lot of good stuff he says about me right here that's a beautiful scripture Ephesians you want to get a pick-me-up read Ephesians sometime it's only short it's only what six chapters you can read that through in your devotions no problem read it every day about what he says and you'll stop looking at who you think you are stop looking at what the of what Satan's trying to tell you you are stop looking at your fault start looking at your fails and start looking at this where he says you're already predestinated unto good will under good things I've got a purpose for you I've got an inheritance for you walking that look for that be an expectation for that be working towards that seek my will so you can be found living in the reality of what Ephesians is talking about here amen it's not just God's will to save us but it's God's will to redeem us to take us back to our original place and position with our lives according to his purpose and plan that's what we're looking for we don't just want to exist that's a horrible place you live you work you sleep you die that's no good have a purpose have a reason it it really changed my life when I came to the ministry because I felt that my wife both felt there was more there was more we had more to do and it's not wrong to sit there and say I'm just a mother I'm just a father no some of us are called to that but if there's something calling for more it usually means there's more and the idea is not to go out there and find it but it's to prayerfully seek it remember brother Brown said he said all these ministers came to me they said we've got the Holy Ghost now do we go seeking our gifts he said no go join a church settle down and wait but if there's more in your heart then God will do more with you but don't go manufacture it don't go manufacture it you can't do that uh I'll leave it don't manufacture your walk with Christ don't try and build a facade don't try and pretend you're more that's the first thing I've learned as a minister don't pretend you got a gift you don't have and don't try and put on errors about what you think you're supposed to be don't try and live a life according to what people say you are live a life according to what he says you are and should be I've had people tell me the things that are supposed to be happening when you're behind a Pulpit and all I say is I'm obviously not there yet why would I pretend otherwise I have people talking like they can see Visions going on all the time and swirling demons and I'm like sorry I don't see it doesn't mean I don't have a gift to preach but it means I don't see demons and spirits swirling around them but if they do all more power to them hopefully they're using it to edify not to lift themselves up but I can't live I can't be what I'm not but I'm looking for what he says I am and living according to that amen Galatians 5 says for Brethren ye have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another see this is the tendency when you get under a law that doesn't require performance that is not Performance Based that you say I can do whatever I want that's the sign of a child of Satan because the grace is not given to us for Liberty to do whatever we want the grace is supposed to be what return back to God and say because of what you've done I'm going to do everything I can for you I'm going to thank you for what you've done I'm not trying to repay it I'm just trying to thank you I'm just trying to be of service to you because of what you've done for me he says for all the laws fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself it's the only law in the law of Grace as you've been loved love others as you've been treated treat others look at what Jesus preached on the on the Sermon on the Mount what was he preaching there die to yourself don't try and Bully and push your way ahead draw back let the other person have it turn the other cheek be meek seek after the things of God not the things of the world humble yourself he says because if you do that you'll get the reward on the other side and that's really what you want church is the reward on the other side not the reward that's here but everything he was pointing at went to this and it says what point them to Christ set yourself aside set your flesh aside set your ego aside set everything aside that is good to you in the flesh so that they can be lifted up to Christ that they would see that you're not the way they are that you don't react the way they react you don't think the way they think that you don't have the priorities they think that that they have there's a difference there's a contrast there and in doing so you can show a Life of Christ that nobody else can even though they might be able to preach the light zone it's supposed to be lived sermons right Jesus Sermon on the Mount was to put them into action not to put them into a talking mood put them into a way of life and that's the what that's the things that we're supposed to have engraved in our hearts amen is that when somebody comes up and they rise against us and they say something they ought not to or do something we turn the other cheek and we're Meek and we're mild we have the nature of the Lamb amen that's what the bride is supposed to have is the nature of a lamb not a nature of a wolf nor even a lion that's his that's for him to take but we take on what the submissive wife not to be trifle with by any means we've got power we've got Authority by all means but we don't go around there whirling the sword around our head taking on everything that comes out there no no we're staying in our place aren't we we're going to do what he wants us to do brother Brown said the blood of Jesus Christ perfects the bride a man who chooses a wife doesn't put her through a lot of punishment he's already found Grace too with her she has found Grace with him he's engaged to her his grace is so great upon them and so will it be upon the bride and so it is on the bride we unworthy creatures deserving of hell but his grace holds us through it look at how many lost and blind and you look around you say why me why me there is no Rhyme or Reason that brother Mark would see that and respond to it and somebody else in his exact same position wouldn't but God rich and mercy that's all predestinated God by the the by his own Good Will said Mark Coffey is my child and so when he reads that something's going to respond to him and that's what happened in each and every one of our Lives it could be anybody else but it's not it's you it's you and that's Grace he says we unworthy look at how many lost and blind how many how many Sinners was there in the world the hour I got saved and he says God save me for a purpose and I'm determined by his will to do that purpose I don't care what anything else goes I want to do it this is the law of Liberty he says what is that you take your freedom and you put yourself back into what willful bondage to Christ not bondage like this but bondage to do as he says what you would do to follow his will to follow his word to be to be led by his spirit amen to do what your Kingdom Purpose is in this world Romans 8 says the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if we're children then we're heirs there's something more to come Heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us we focus so much on the glory that's going to be revealed and we forget that he says their sufferings in this present time it's a battle it's a struggle it's trials it's difficulty but there is a glory that's going to be revealed in us he says for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestation of the sons of God struck me as I was reading in in Exodus yesterday and this morning there and how the children of Israel they groaned and we spoke about it last Source where we said if you're groaning for something it means that God's on the way right so the Earth is groaning for something that we're supposed to have but here's the thing it's not just the groaning that makes it happen God has a time for it they've grown for 400 years 429 years and then in the 430th year God came down but the groaning means it's going to be satisfied one day that he'll hear them and he'll come down and he'll deliver with a mighty hand he says I'll do it I'll do it in a way that that they'll push you away with a mighty hand I'll work them over so heavily I'll beat the I'll beat the Egyptians up so badly that they'll be shoving you out the door and we saw what happened when they did they they spoiled the Egyptians they took their jewelry they took their gold they took their silver they took everything good that the Egyptians had the Egyptians said take it and leave us alone that's what's happening on this Earth they're groaning the Earth is groaning and everyone that's at a rate against US they're going to want to just get us out of here that's it we prick their consciences we get in their way we hold things back but it's groaning it's groaning for us to do what we're supposed to do but we can't make it happen we can believe we can be sensitive and we can trust God to pull us into this thing Amen to draw us into it willingly as we're moving forward amen why it's manifesting time it's manifesting time and guess what we're going to see a whole lot more bad than we are good listen the bride is the minority on the earth so so get ready there's lots more bad stuff coming but how many times have we heard it said if Satan's getting his partner she's not a wife if Satan's getting his partner ready what's God doing with his bride as well if Satan is arraigned all of his weapons against the bride then what is God doing he's what he's pouring in his Spirit he's raising up a standard so that we'll be able to stand against that flood amen what is it to do it's to prove God's Not Dead that Christ didn't just die in that that cross and raise up again but he's living and you and I the exact same way as we close brother Bob says someone said how can you stand let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgot they were Sons you are our son you're taking Christ's place you're a son so don't live for yourself live for others then he says well I can live for this brother because he sure is a nice man he says that's not it live for that man who hates you ouch live for that woman that hates you live for that person who could who would kill you if they could it's a bit extreme Brother John manifestation of the sons of God is Extreme it is Extreme that's what they've done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then he says but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards Calvary he says I hope this helps you to get in a place that's what the Tabernacle that's what all people has got to do is find out what you are and what's the purpose Church isn't going to church just to play music and sing songs church is a place where there's correction judgment begins at the house of God and we must reckon ourselves dead and alive to Christ then he made the way that we could sacrifice ourselves to his service to follow him if we follow him we lead the life that he lived that's wonderful may God bless you let's stand together if we would this evening amen I'm so glad that he's made a way amen that is not me that's doing it it's Christ that lives Within Me that even when I don't want to you know we sing that song that I was on the verge of giving over we talk about something keeps holding me that's because there's something written in here and it's because there's a holy spirit that sealed you to the day of your Redemption that's what's holding you day in and day out it's not our strength it's not our discipline it's not our goodness but he's made a way for us amen and it's a way that we can walk day in and day out listen we can have the victory every day by that I mean we won't lose the battle you don't win the battle every day sometimes you just battle into the next day and the next day and the next day but the idea is not to give ground to hold your ground remember scripture says when he comes in what do we do having done all the stand we stand and we push and we hold and we pray and we pray and we say Lord I need more and God gives us more Lord the enemy is stronger the Lord makes you stronger Lord I need more of your spirit I need more guidance I need more Deliverance I need more strength I need more discernment I need more wisdom and what does he do he says if any man lack if any woman lack ask him who a braideth not but giveth what willingly freely abundantly whatever we have it's available to us and it's a new way of life where we're not sitting there and beating ourselves up but we're saying Lord I'm trusting in the leading of your Holy Spirit the provision that your word has laid before me and that's what I'm going to walk in day in and day out and day in day out I was talking to someone today that went through a a very very rough situation physically just Satan hit him with something and uh and he passed out three times in a night knocked himself on his head gave himself a concussion and he said I don't know what it was he said and then I thought about it and he said I look back at job where Satan came up and he says you know I've been walking all over the Earth and God said have you considered job and he says yeah job you guard him so well nothing bad ever happens to job nothing bad ever happens to him and he says let me touch him and and he'll turn his back on you and the brother said this was an attack it took him to the hospital that's how bad it was he knocked himself out three times fainting in a night had to go in an ambulance he got there and when they were done they said we can't find anything he went home a good man completely his wife had had reached out to my wife because they're over in BC four and a half hours this was 2 30 last night this happened or two nights ago she said they're the only ones that are going to be awake so I'm going to reach them and block and I prayed right there first thing in the morning and he went in there and he came out of it just no issues but he said what is it he says because it worried me it worried me that Satan could hit me that hard and he said I felt like I was dying I thought I was done he said and it worried me he said then I thought about and he says that was just a test he says because we've been making what footsteps we've just been doing a little bit of walking he didn't say we've been running all over the church he said but we've been making some changes in our life and each day just one foot just one foot Satan hates that just one foot you know what he loves he says loves when somebody starts running around because he knows if I can get them turned they'll run right back to where they were but you get that person that just real solid stable you can't knock them they just walk they walk Satan hates that he says that's what we've been doing we must just do a bit a little bit of walking in our family he says and we've been cleaning up our house we've been cleaning up our relationships and we've been cleaning up our screen time and we've been cleaning up how we spend our time in these things he says and Satan hates it because all of a sudden my kids are so happy to be in church and they're they're asking us you know if somebody's sick no no Dad we got to go to church and Dad we're late for church and this and that and he says and and we're going to prayer meetings now and and God's really moving and we're having all these different things he says and Satan doesn't like that he says and so he says can I touch him and God said sure he says I don't worry about him he'll be fine and guess what he's got a beat up face it's got a sore shoulder he's not feeling so good I'll bet you anything he's in church tonight why because there's a law of the spirit of Life inside of him that keeps him going day in and day out listen we're going to get knocked around we're gonna get knocked around it's gonna happen get up and keep going don't beat yourself up about it don't beat yourself up about it there is a law of Liberty that says that Satan can't hold you down all you have to do is do is say the Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for what I did and come back in and he says it's okay son it's okay daughter let's keep moving one step at a time sometimes we want victory in a big leap it doesn't happen that way so many times it's just footsteps brother Brown said footsteps is possession that's all you have to do just keep walking don't have to run through it you don't have to have Victory today just don't settle for falling back today just keep pushing day in and day out day in and day out amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how wonderful it is Lord that you're not held back by the things we do Lord are by the things we don't do Lord but your word won't return to your Void Lord your spirit's been given to us Lord to make us an overcoming bride in this age more than that everything that you've said is yea and amen and you're going to make it happen heavenly father but Lord we want to be on your side Lord we want to be working with you and and putting our shoulder to the wheel Lord we want to be walking around in the land of our inheritance Heavenly Father Lord we want to be walking on a way that is holy Lord we want to be found in the middle of the road in your perfect will Lord cover by your blood wash by your word and filled with your spirit Lord Jesus so Lord I pray for us each one tonight Lord some need big victories some need little victories and some of us need to help others with those victories Lord God help us Lord to be a body we pray Lord no big eyes no little use Lord but each one of us Lord at the same level pulling together Lord protecting encouraging Lord drawing each one unto you Lord that your word could have its way in our life we pray Lord we pray for your Holy Spirit Lord to minister to each heart and soul fill us with your power Lord God lord I don't want an empty life Lord I want a life full of the purpose Lord of of the direction of the leading of your Holy Spirit in my life Lord I pray you do it for me and for each one here we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen can we sing that song Beulah Land 10 27 brother vaishal

going to sing that and then we'd have brother Bob come and close the word of prayer and then give your church but at the end of this he'll come amen by my spirit is there a mountain in your way do

[Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen praise the Lord he made the message was clear in that chorus it's uh not quite works is it anything we do which we've heard tonight is by his Spirit by the grace of God um if you want to see what you can it's just a brief report I was just asked to give a report if you don't want to sit you don't have to but you can't if you want um I just uh so I was just asked during the service if I would just brief everybody on what's been going on and where we are today so um essentially and we we have we have briefed the deacons uh up to a few days ago so we have brief the deacons and brother John as we were going through this but we we had experienced some um some I guess frustrations uh not not that it wasn't expected really because things were going pretty smooth so the devil knew that and he had to fire a few left hooks at us and he did that and and to be fair you know when you're dealing with the real estate agents who are dealing with the lawyers and and and the others uh and understand that this was really complex I mean nobody has ever seen a church going to receivership as big as the ERC church so now they got like 50 50 files that they're dealing with just one committee um that uh they're dealing with 50 50 properties that they're trying to sell and the government has given up a deadline I think it's May 31 that they have everything done and you know money brought in so that they can pay to claims right that that are outstanding so um so you know we can understand some of that but what the problem that we were facing about America myself was that there was um we weren't getting answers and all we wanted was some simple answers of where are things who who who's doing what and is it done and where are we now where do we go and we we came to the point where we were reaching the deadline and you had to realize that this building is sold and it uh officially last Wednesday we were supposed to be out of here so it's the grace of God that we're here to be honest now the real estate agents understood that and they've kind of come around and and they're working with the purchaser who is uh obviously very decent person so he understands that there's a delay and he seems to be willing to work with us on it but that won't be forever of course um so you know that aside we did the American I decided we were going to put some pressure on uh those that uh the powers that be I guess and and we did that we started uh you know working with the real estate agents trying to force them to uh get to get to the source of the problem and I was talking to the town of uh CBS I'm trying to find out if the information that was required by them from the church was submitted and are they dealing with the application because that application and the permit that would come out of that is linked directly with our request for a permit to operate as a church in the new building okay so that has that has been ongoing and finally uh finally with the pressure that we have put on uh and uh along with the fact that our Banker reminded me at the same time that the the offer financing that we have will expire on not on February 4th on February 2nd I found out yesterday it was actually February 2nd so uh that being the case just to ease the ease your minds we Gus told me he said we're not losing the approval that president has said that has been done but the application will have to be all redone and resubmitted to their head office for you know a formal signature because because of rules that the bank has now years ago that when I was doing that stuff it uh it was just a little signature on an amendment but to extend but they can't do that and apparently that's government regulation now so uh so he's because now as of today uh we got a response from some correspondents from the town who told us okay to Catholic church we did meet with them we uh we told them I guess we they said we told him what's needed uh has to do with that survey and whatever else that was required they have not yet as of today submitted that they did commit yesterday to doing it and sort of getting that stuff ready and they're getting it into the town okay so we got that I tried to find out from the town what was what are the timelines because this has to be in their documentation has to be into the town a certain amount of days before the council meets and to improve it not ours but theirs because there's a whole lot bigger and that that application is the permit for a permit to subdivide the land on which right now we're in a we're on a piece of property that houses three buildings us the school and that preacher's residence says next door on the left so that had to be all subdivided and that's what they were working on so we do note at the survey is is done because it was sent to the to the school board for some for signatures and whatever so basically with with that letter that um that came back or that normally came back from the town of CBS today that tells us that there's not enough time to meet the January 31 council meeting therefore therefore we won't be able to close the deal before February 2nd from the bank's perspective uh so that's going to go that's actually going to go into well into February is my guess in the meantime we we've all agreed that we're going to uh sign a lease agreement and we're going to rent the property so that means that means we will go into the building with a rental agreement in hand okay with the with the Catholic church and there does not seem to be any problem with that it had it had gone to the Archbishop yesterday after the meeting and the lawyer advice for America today that he was expecting something as early as this afternoon back on that lease so um so that's that's just to let you know that we so that that's going to be the process here right we we thought we'd get there and hope that we would get the deal closed it won't be closed on time uh and it's somewhat expected the way things have been going and but uh having said that that's still in the works and we will still keep that pressure on to get the deal closed because believe it or not the Catholic Church wants it closed um so uh that will happen most likely God willing and sometime in February in the meantime uh it looks like we'll be moving rather soon if we have that agreement in our hand but America and I are happy with what we see in the agreement and there's no changes needed we could be and this is only me speaking uh we could we could possibly be starting that move on the weekend or early next week okay so stand ready everybody because when we move uh when we get that call we're going to head to uh you know Finnish friend and I have started boxing stuff up if you see the empty boxes in behind the view there so anybody got nothing to do feel free to come up and take a box and fill it up with something and we've got some in there and we've got some somewhere else so and I've got some stuff home but um so we're going to do what we can to uh over the weekend to box up some of the things that are here the rest of it is uh it will be like getting that building really quickly and we can get stuff in there the brothers who want to come when when we got it when we got the sanction to go uh and uproot everything and and take it out to where it's supposed to go um so all I'm saying is that we you know we want to be ready I know the sisters are meeting tomorrow to go over uh plans for uh for any cleaning and how it's going to proceed in the future so we're leaving that with them to uh to do that um and uh it's good to see somebody else going to breakfast besides us because we get a we get a bit of abuse from the crowd in the last meeting who didn't believe the fact that we were paying our own way but is that right uh how so anyway I just wanted to just just to update you I mean I don't think there's anything else that can come to mind to you oh it's it's the date issue yeah once you got that agreement it's nothing to stop us from going right will we be able yeah if we move Saturday we won't have anything here to have service we'll we'll go you know I mean it's our intent to let the man who bought this building have it you know you know and he knows we're not purposely trying to hold him off not at all uh the agents the two real estate agents involved have have actually uh said to him that uh because because his financing is being drawn down so he's paying interest and he's not in here so uh they they've agreed because of the way things have been going to uh help pay for some of his interest costs which I thought was really really pretty good of them um but uh from our perspective everything that need is needs to be submitted and don't is done you know we've had it done we've followed the rules as best we could we got an advice where we needed it and everything is done we're essentially we're waiting for a phone call I've been getting quotes on heating systems uh for the for the new building how you know and some advice as to how how to heat it efficiently and effectively that's ongoing so you know it's not only that that we're dealing with there's all those other things um for Paul uh so with the original view does that mean that can we still go ahead with changes to two building no I don't think so I I I we I've talked to Flame about that we don't we don't think so um no that'd be changing the the uh the building we shouldn't we can't do that but we can't have church you know we can't have church even if we have it in in the hallway up there we'll have church you know I mean the deacons are made not pretty clear to me so as soon as we and that's the desire of all of our hearts I mean you know yes that's a good question um we will what we are hoping we're going to see in that agreement is that we're going to be responsible for the utilities while we're in there so that's a pretty low price to pay um it's certainly not our fault that we are we are so uh so we would expect that and it's only fair that we do pay utilities when we go in because we'll be paying utilities where we go right so um so if there's anything over and above that we would we would want to go back to them and say uh we want reimbursement for that either through a reduction at a purchase price or uh just just give us a check we think that would be fair so we will talk to we'll talk to him about it we're not going to hold enough to move and we certainly won't we don't want to get bogged down in in a lease agreement over over over rental fee if possible you know so because the the whole structure that they have is deep you know I mean it it goes to this our real estate agent tonight real estate agent to somebody who's on a committee indicator gets committee together the committee has I don't know six seven people or whatever and then they got to make a decision and that doesn't happen believe me it doesn't happen overnight so we are under the gun in a way to get to get moving out of here and as soon as that can happen providing the deal is reasonable we will do that yes a lot of the churches have done this might sign it so you know it's happened and in terms of difficulty they don't look at this one you know so like yeah we take yes in every case that you know the lawyer before he requests funds from our bank to close the deal he has to certify title and to certify title that that's kind of where the the it takes a bit of time now in these deals because everything had to be subdivided I mean everything had to be surveyed and some divided so that's one of the things that holds this up yeah that's good and I I think yeah and that's you know and later on we won't get in all details on those agreements or anything but we'll later on we'll tell you where you can't park you know and if we get like utilities anyway you know if we had if this if we had moved into January yes absolutely absolutely yeah oh no it won't it shouldn't be but I mean the thing is you've got a building that's empty and they have to pay the utilities on it now just to keep the water from freezing right keep the heat on and stuff we're saying okay we'll pay it we would pay the the utilities let us go in and we'll take that burden off you right I mean the ultimate result here is that we want to hurry the benefit is that we get a building somebody else gets our building and hopefully with a 400 000 check it gets to the claimants the ones that we're suffering because of all it is in the end result they we'd like to see them get their money you know in all fairness you know I think the system has gone against them myself but it's being pushed yeah it was yeah and and because now it comes with me but but the thing and as good you said that because uh you know in this deal that we've got with the financing debt servicing ratios are all calculated and that's why we had to put into the deal what we did have to put in but now the interest rate's gone up since we came in uh as you know since since we got our application in and got it approved now the deal is expiring we got to go under new the new interest rates which has gone up another half point so to meet those calculations that bank does we're going to have to put a few more dollars into the deal up front uh and oh I did I didn't tell you today but Gus told me I asked him for an estimate of what that would be so he said maybe two or three thousand more okay we can do that he said maximum five but but because he hasn't worked out the numbers but we'll get that so it's not as bad as we thought it might be we thought it might be an upwards of 10. correct correct so because that's right because as of February 2nd you know if this deal is not closed which it won't be we're 135 000 short that's what it amounts to right until we get that approval back get that sanction back in a new offer we will by Grace I mean to quote Matt it's our ability right and he said he's never a waivered on that right so and uh hopefully that will ignite all our faith amen so anyway I just I just wanted to say to say it and thanks to Joel for reminding me it's good to good to do that and uh so you know we'll be uh we'll need all hands to help for as many hands as possible and when that time comes so I got your cell number so don't worry you can't hide so any other questions anybody got anything you want to say um before we uh space thank you it's all him it's not us they said why don't we standing we're just closing prayer our
