[46:08] Lord we thank you for your presence Lord
[46:10] we thank you for the worship of the
[46:12] Saints this evening Lord God lord and we
[46:14] pray that you would take that Lord and
[46:16] that anointing and you would turn it now
[46:18] to the opening of your word Lord God
[46:20] that it would go out Lord into the lives
[46:22] of the hearers Lord and the speaker
[46:23] himself Lord that your spirit would just
[46:26] have free reign amongst us this evening
[46:28] Lord that you would touch our souls Lord
[46:30] that you would change us to be more like
[46:32] you Lord separate us again from the
[46:34] things of this world Lord wash the dirt
[46:36] off of our feet that we've gotten from
[46:38] walking around in this world Lord and
[46:40] just make us more like you we pray Lord
[46:42] for we want the glory of God to be seen
[46:44] in each and every one of our Lives we
[46:46] pray Lord just be with us now we ask in
[46:49] Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen and
[46:53] amen
[46:54] amen God bless you if you turn the
[46:55] scriptures to John chapter 8. it's
[46:58] almost like you came ready for church
[46:59] tonight amen I didn't know what was
[47:02] going on out here and I'm like you know
[47:04] we've got brother Mark you know we're on
[47:06] our our Backup backup song leader
[47:10] and then all of a sudden people are
[47:11] worshiping you know
[47:13] it goes to show the worship is not in
[47:15] The Man Behind the pulpit and then it's
[47:17] in the hearts of the people that are in
[47:18] the congregation amen so we're thankful
[47:20] for that thankful for each one here I
[47:22] want to welcome our brother Michael our
[47:24] sister star and our sister Ursula from
[47:26] Toronto I believe certainly good to have
[47:28] them with us and pray that you'll be
[47:30] blessed Amen in the services and that
[47:32] you'll be a blessing to us as well
[47:34] amen John chapter 8 and verse 30.
[47:38] Jesus and it says as he spake these
[47:40] words many believed on him
[47:43] then said Jesus to those Jews which
[47:45] believed on him if you continue in my
[47:48] word then are ye my disciples indeed and
[47:51] ye shall know the truth and the truth
[47:54] shall make you free they answered him we
[47:57] be Abraham's seed and we're never in
[47:58] bondage to any man how sayest thou you
[48:01] shall be made free and Jesus answered
[48:04] and said unto them
[48:05] verily verily I say unto you whosoever
[48:08] commit a sin is a servant of sin
[48:11] and the servant abideth not in the house
[48:13] forever but the son abideth forever if
[48:17] the son therefore shall make you free
[48:19] you shall be free indeed amen God bless
[48:23] you you can have your seats this evening
[48:26] amen and we're still preaching on the
[48:28] the Jubilee as you might have gathered
[48:29] and we preached three services on the
[48:32] Year of Jubilee and now we're on the day
[48:34] of Jubilee and this is part one of
[48:36] probably two parts maybe three we'll see
[48:38] and you say what's after that then you
[48:40] get to the hour of Jubilee
[48:42] but we'll do that a little later I think
[48:43] amen but the day of Jubilee and I just
[48:45] want to paint a picture really set a
[48:47] foundation for for Sunday's service the
[48:49] Lord willing so maybe you're just a bit
[48:51] more teaching this evening rather than
[48:53] preaching but I wanted us to to get into
[48:56] maybe a bit of what what this day of
[48:58] Jubilee really is and we talked last
[49:00] time in the last few Services about how
[49:02] the Year of Jubilee and and the day of
[49:04] Jubilee that they had was just a type
[49:06] and it was just a shadow amen it was
[49:07] imperfect it was pointing to something
[49:09] coming that Christ was going to fulfill
[49:11] not only in his day but also at the end
[49:13] of of the Gentile dispensation as there
[49:16] was going to be a time of true Freedom
[49:18] there's going to be a time of true
[49:19] Jubilee and as we read there in the
[49:21] scriptures that this kind of Jubilee
[49:22] when you set free then you're free
[49:24] indeed amen it's the real deal it's not
[49:26] a temporary thing it's not a partial
[49:28] thing but it's a true Freedom that only
[49:30] Christ can give us now I remember when I
[49:33] know most of us remember all the things
[49:34] that brother Mark teaches but when he
[49:36] did the series on the feast if you
[49:38] remember then there was always we had
[49:40] that the the day of Jubilee was built
[49:41] into the at and and God had built in
[49:44] that Grace God had built in that debt
[49:46] payment got a built in that freedom into
[49:48] the law but it was only a shadow and
[49:50] really what it was was it was a prophecy
[49:52] it was a prophecy for what was going to
[49:54] come and the problem always is is that
[49:56] we take the Shadow and we get stuck at
[49:58] it and we say this is it and that's what
[50:01] brother Branham said the denominations
[50:02] did is he said they took something they
[50:04] took a partial thing and then they they
[50:06] put a stamp behind and said this is all
[50:08] that we will believe
[50:10] and all it was was types and shadows it
[50:12] was only a partial thing bringing us to
[50:14] the fullness of the opening of the word
[50:16] amen and we want to be very careful
[50:18] today even within the message because
[50:20] what you have to realize is that is God
[50:22] is continuing to unfold himself amen we
[50:25] have the full word and we have the open
[50:27] word but the understanding the
[50:28] Revelation the manifestation and the
[50:31] reality of it is something that is
[50:32] unfolding not behind this Pulpit but in
[50:35] the lives and the hearts of the
[50:36] Believers that will take it and hear it
[50:38] and let it have its reality and let it
[50:40] have its fullness and let it have the
[50:42] preeminence in their lives amen so when
[50:44] we're looking at this day of Jubilee we
[50:46] don't just want to stop at what they had
[50:48] under the law of Moses we don't even
[50:50] want to stop under the day of Jubilee
[50:52] that we're going to speak on today and
[50:53] Sunday but there is a full Jubilee
[50:55] that's coming and we talk about that and
[50:57] that is the day of our Redemption that
[50:59] is the fullness of the Jubilee is when
[51:01] we get out of here amen but in the
[51:03] meantime there is a day of Jubilee and
[51:04] it's a type and it's an Earnest and it's
[51:06] a down payment for what's coming amen
[51:09] but we get so limited it we're so
[51:11] limited by the things that we see and
[51:13] the things that we read because so often
[51:15] we only recognize God when he has
[51:17] already done his work amen amen amen
[51:19] hindsight is always 20 20 and we look at
[51:22] things and we say well that was God that
[51:23] did this and that was God that did that
[51:25] and we see what he did but as our
[51:27] pastors challenged us so often we want
[51:29] to see him when he's doing the work we
[51:32] want to understand what's going on Amen
[51:34] we don't want to just know that we're
[51:36] LED but we want to know why we're LED
[51:37] often we want to understand that we're
[51:40] in the process of God's Redemption we
[51:42] want to understand that we're in the
[51:44] working of the kingdom and so the things
[51:46] that we do the things that we say we
[51:48] want to know that it's God that's doing
[51:49] it and we want to know why he's doing it
[51:51] amen do you know how you know when God
[51:54] is moving in your life church
[51:55] when you are living your life under the
[51:59] inspiration of the Holy Spirit according
[52:01] to the word of God it's that simple then
[52:04] everything that comes your way whether
[52:05] it's opportunity
[52:07] whether it's it's difficulty whether
[52:09] it's trials whether it's battles whether
[52:11] it's blessings whether it's things being
[52:13] taken out of your life you can say that
[52:15] is the Lord that's working in my life
[52:17] because Sons and Daughters of God are
[52:19] led by the spirit of God and if you're
[52:21] led by the spirit of God then everything
[52:23] everything that he's doing in your life
[52:25] is ordained by him and so you can walk
[52:28] through that whether it's tough or
[52:29] whether it's good whether it's hard or
[52:31] whether it's easy you can say it's the
[52:33] Lord working in my life and so when
[52:35] times are good you can rest because he's
[52:37] given you a period of rest and when
[52:38] things are tough you can say the Lord is
[52:40] my strength amen so you have confidence
[52:42] of what you're going through is what he
[52:44] has for you amen I believe that God is
[52:47] wanting to make his will known to his
[52:49] bride remember the prophet of God gave
[52:50] that famous quote where he says the
[52:52] bride has the word
[52:54] and she knows what to do with it he's
[52:57] wanting us to know what to do with his
[52:59] word not that we run around willy-nilly
[53:01] just speaking the word but that I read
[53:03] in my devotions just yesterday morning
[53:05] or this morning that in Proverbs where
[53:07] it says a word fitly spoken is like
[53:10] apples of gold in pictures of silver
[53:12] right it's perfect it's beautiful but
[53:15] when you speak out of charm when you
[53:17] speak out of your mouth rather than by
[53:19] his inspiration that's when things get
[53:21] twisted up amen amen Jesus said this in
[53:24] John 15 he was speaking to his disciples
[53:25] remember he said henceforth I call you
[53:28] not servants for the servant knoweth not
[53:30] what his Lord doeth but I have called
[53:32] you friends for all things that I heard
[53:35] of my father I have made known unto you
[53:38] have we heard what the spirit said to
[53:40] the churches
[53:42] Amen in Revelation chapter 3 it says he
[53:44] that hath the near let him hear what the
[53:46] spirit saith unto the churches
[53:48] and that's what we had was we had a
[53:50] Malachi 4 Angel we had a relic
[53:52] Revelation 10 7 Angel come and tell us
[53:55] what the spirit was saying and we're
[53:57] supposed to catch it and we're supposed
[53:58] to know what the father is trying to do
[53:59] in this age he's got a word for this
[54:02] time specifically for us
[54:04] Jesus continues he says you have not
[54:06] chosen me but I have chosen you and
[54:09] ordained you that you should go and
[54:12] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[54:14] should remain that whatsoever you shall
[54:17] ask of the father in my name he shall
[54:19] give it to you we talked about restoring
[54:21] sight to the blind in the last service
[54:22] remember and we said it's not blindness
[54:25] because they can't see with their eyes
[54:26] but it's blindness because they're in
[54:28] darkness and how God removes blindness
[54:31] as he takes you into the light right he
[54:34] takes you into the light of the word of
[54:35] God he takes you into the presence of
[54:37] God and then as long as we walk in the
[54:39] light as he is in the light then we have
[54:41] Fellowship one with another and we can
[54:43] see what's going on we have eyes to see
[54:45] and we have ears to hear we've got to
[54:47] stay in the word of God we've got to
[54:49] stay in the presence of God we've got to
[54:51] stay in the Revelation for our time and
[54:53] season so that our eyes are not blind
[54:55] because otherwise the blind lead the
[54:56] blind and they both fall into the ditch
[54:58] and that's not where we want to end up
[55:00] but I want to you know we preached on
[55:02] the The Year of Jubilee for the last
[55:03] three services but now we're talking
[55:05] about the day of Jubilee and there's a
[55:07] distinction because the day fits within
[55:09] the year
[55:10] and so you could have the start of the
[55:12] Year of Jubilee and not be free
[55:14] and you weren't free on the first day of
[55:16] the Year of Jubilee though it was the
[55:17] Year of Jubilee but you had to come to a
[55:19] time you had to come to a day where the
[55:21] Year of Jubilee was now fulfilled and
[55:23] you were actually free to go amen but
[55:26] rather this happened on a particular day
[55:28] so if we look in Leviticus 25 we've read
[55:30] this before but just to set the
[55:32] foundation it says thou shall number
[55:34] seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven
[55:36] times seven years and the space of the
[55:38] seven sabbaths of years shall be under
[55:40] the 49 years so he says take 49 years he
[55:43] says then shall shall cause the trumpet
[55:45] of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day
[55:47] of the seventh month in the day of
[55:49] atonement shall you make the trumpet
[55:51] sound throughout all your land
[55:53] and you shall hallow the 50th year and
[55:56] Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land
[55:57] unto all the inhabitants thereof it
[56:00] shall be a jubilee to you and you shall
[56:01] return every man unto his possession and
[56:04] you shall return every man unto his
[56:06] family now that sounds really really
[56:08] easy and it sounds really simple but I
[56:10] want you to catch something before the
[56:12] day of Jubilee happens there's a whole
[56:14] lot that has to happen before there's a
[56:16] whole process to this Jubilee that goes
[56:18] on and every single bit of it has a has
[56:21] a type and has a shadow and it has a
[56:23] purpose and it's God showing us what
[56:24] he's going to do in the future so you'll
[56:27] remember this this slide that brother
[56:28] Mark put up and it's the feast slides
[56:30] and if we look here before we get to the
[56:32] day of atonement we've got one two three
[56:34] four five feasts before we ever come to
[56:38] atonement so you've got to go through
[56:39] all the way through more than half the
[56:42] year you've got to do 190 days of the
[56:44] year before you get to the jail Jubilee
[56:46] and you've got to go through a whole
[56:48] process you've got to go through a lot
[56:49] of things listen if you're a slave you
[56:52] had to go through an awful lot of work
[56:53] before you got to the day of Jubilee
[56:55] because they had to get all their
[56:56] harvesting before you got free
[56:58] you had to do a bunch of work to get
[57:00] there you had to earn your last year you
[57:03] had to learn your last little bit of
[57:04] Freedom that you were going to get they
[57:06] worked you hard for those 190 days of
[57:08] that year amen
[57:10] now remember God puts a timeline on this
[57:13] and he has a reason for the timeline
[57:15] amen it's all a type and a shadow like I
[57:17] said it's it's pushing us forward amen
[57:19] but on the day of atonement that was the
[57:22] day you could go free
[57:24] it was only on the day of atonement they
[57:26] had lots of great feasts before that
[57:27] they had lots of Feasts where where
[57:29] Lambs were killed and prices were paid
[57:31] and celebrations were given but it was
[57:33] only on the day of atonement that you
[57:35] were allowed to go free amen and that's
[57:37] because that was the day that the sin
[57:39] penalty was paid you remember they had
[57:41] 10 days of or seven days I forget now
[57:44] but they had those days where they had
[57:46] to sit there 10 days yes from the first
[57:48] to the 10th they had to sit there and
[57:50] they had to dwell on how they had failed
[57:52] they had to dwell on their Humanity they
[57:54] had to dwell on their faults and
[57:55] failures it was a very sober time and it
[57:58] was God reminding them you can't get
[58:00] there on your own that you need a
[58:02] sacrifice you need an atonement for your
[58:04] sins that as good as you may have been
[58:06] brother or sister you're not good enough
[58:08] to meet God's expectation so then they
[58:11] would come up to the day of atonement
[58:12] and that soberness was still there but
[58:15] then they laid their hands on the on the
[58:17] body of their perfect sacrifice the lamb
[58:19] and then they could be free and so the
[58:22] point was that you had to have a price
[58:24] paid to go free and that's why the day
[58:26] of Jubilee was on the Feast of atonement
[58:28] or the day of atonement it was a
[58:30] symbolism that when your price was paid
[58:32] you could go free and that's what's
[58:35] going through all of this amen but again
[58:36] it's just a type and a shadow because
[58:38] when we get to the real day of Jubilee
[58:40] it doesn't follow this timeline and
[58:42] there's a very specific reason for it
[58:43] amen it was different when it was
[58:45] fulfilled and it was perfect when it was
[58:47] fulfilled that's why we don't hold the
[58:49] types and shadows perfectly is because
[58:50] they're only a shadow they're only a
[58:52] representation they're not always
[58:53] perfect in that amen
[58:55] but we read in the opening scripture
[58:57] where Jesus said in John 8 he says if
[58:59] the son therefore shall make you free
[59:01] you shall be free indeed Jesus has
[59:04] already declared the Year of Jubilee
[59:06] it's already done and he's sitting there
[59:09] and he's saying there's more to come
[59:11] there's something that you have never
[59:13] experienced yet you have healed the sick
[59:15] you have cast out demons all these
[59:17] things obey you disciples but there's
[59:19] something greater coming to you that you
[59:21] haven't experienced yet and nobody no
[59:23] slave no person no Hebrew has ever
[59:25] experienced the freedom that I'm going
[59:27] to give you when the day a jubilee
[59:29] happens amen this wasn't going to be
[59:31] like any other day of Jubilee amen we've
[59:33] said before that on the day of Jubilee
[59:35] you could walk away from your debts you
[59:37] can walk away from your problems you can
[59:39] walk away from The Faults that have
[59:40] brought you to the condition that you
[59:42] were in but you weren't free indeed
[59:44] because when you walked away you still
[59:46] had the debt nature that made you
[59:49] getting dead in the first place right
[59:51] you had that spending nature you had
[59:53] that those faults and failures you had
[59:55] those addictions you had those those
[59:57] issues inside your body still there when
[59:59] you walked away free and that's why they
[1:00:01] had a seven year Jubilee was because our
[1:00:03] Nature has fallen and we're constantly
[1:00:05] getting ourselves back into the same
[1:00:06] problems over and over and over again
[1:00:08] why you weren't free indeed
[1:00:11] you were just free of that debt but you
[1:00:14] weren't free you're just free of the
[1:00:16] debt Jesus says when I set you free
[1:00:18] you're going to be free indeed there's
[1:00:20] going to be something else amen
[1:00:22] when he says indeed what's he saying
[1:00:25] he's saying this time it's going to be
[1:00:26] different and you'll know it's different
[1:00:28] because you won't be the way you were
[1:00:29] when you went into that debt when you
[1:00:31] went into that prison when you went into
[1:00:32] that slavery when I looked up that word
[1:00:34] in the original language that word
[1:00:36] indeed means you'll be free truly
[1:00:39] completely
[1:00:41] certainly you'll be clean
[1:00:45] you'll be clean
[1:00:46] whatever you have that was causing you
[1:00:49] to get into these issues it's going to
[1:00:50] be completely gone away from you amen it
[1:00:53] reminds me of the woman at the well
[1:00:56] because she went there and she was
[1:00:57] thirsty and she came with something to
[1:00:59] get water
[1:01:00] and every day she would go to that same
[1:01:03] place and she would gather water why
[1:01:05] because she was thirsty
[1:01:07] and every day for years and years she
[1:01:10] went and she filled up her water bottle
[1:01:12] and then she went back into the City and
[1:01:14] she drank it and her thirst was
[1:01:16] satisfied for a moment but she had to
[1:01:18] come back to the well every day
[1:01:20] amen but there come a day where she met
[1:01:23] Christ
[1:01:23] and he says if you drink the water that
[1:01:25] I've got you'll never thirst again
[1:01:27] you'll be free indeed from this thing
[1:01:30] that's bothering you amen and we know
[1:01:32] that after that she never went back and
[1:01:34] found another husband she had found her
[1:01:36] husband it was Christ the word and he
[1:01:39] made a change in her life and she left
[1:01:41] what her water pots behind why to
[1:01:45] signify that her thirst was satisfied
[1:01:47] that it had been quenched not the
[1:01:49] natural the natural we always fight but
[1:01:51] this was something that satisfied what
[1:01:53] was deep inside her it resolved the
[1:01:55] problems that made her have to go to the
[1:01:58] well in the middle of the hot day rather
[1:02:00] than with the other women amen it
[1:02:02] resolved the same question in her life
[1:02:04] and she goes in and now she starts to
[1:02:06] testify she says is not this the very
[1:02:08] Christ who told me everything I did ever
[1:02:10] in my life and many people believed they
[1:02:14] took her witness and they went and
[1:02:15] listened to him and they got the same
[1:02:17] thirst quenching experience that she got
[1:02:18] amen it's a wonderful thing when he sets
[1:02:22] you free indeed amen that's what we're
[1:02:24] looking for but I want you to catch
[1:02:26] something here because you can't set
[1:02:28] someone free if you yourself aren't free
[1:02:31] amen you can pay the debt for somebody
[1:02:33] if you don't have the debt paid off on
[1:02:35] your land you can't go redeem somebody's
[1:02:37] property or their person if you yourself
[1:02:39] don't have your property in person free
[1:02:41] a slave cannot redeem a slave but you
[1:02:44] had to be a Freeman and a free woman and
[1:02:46] you had to have your own property before
[1:02:48] you could go get somebody else's
[1:02:50] and I say that because there's these
[1:02:52] doctrines floating around these days
[1:02:53] where people are saying that we redeem
[1:02:55] other people
[1:02:56] that husbands or fathers redeem their
[1:02:58] wives and redeem their families and it's
[1:03:00] the biggest load of bunk I've ever heard
[1:03:01] because why you are the redeemed you are
[1:03:04] not the Redeemer and you will never see
[1:03:06] in the scripture where anything clothed
[1:03:08] in flesh other than Christ Jesus is the
[1:03:10] Redeemer there is only one man that is a
[1:03:13] redeemer and that is Christ amen so what
[1:03:15] do we do we point to him
[1:03:17] we point to him we give evidence of his
[1:03:19] redeeming work but we are not even fully
[1:03:22] redeemed ourselves we only have the
[1:03:24] earnest of our Salvation we're not fully
[1:03:25] saved we're not fully redeemed until we
[1:03:27] get a new body
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:30] brother Brandon would say it this way he
[1:03:32] says you don't have to be judged you
[1:03:34] don't have to think yourself worthy
[1:03:36] you'll never be worthy so when we sit
[1:03:39] there and say I'm not worthy then say
[1:03:40] praise the Lord
[1:03:42] that's a great starting place when you
[1:03:45] realize you're not worthy that's a great
[1:03:47] place to be because that means that
[1:03:48] you'll start to accept the things that
[1:03:50] Christ has for you
[1:03:52] he says but Christ was worthy and you're
[1:03:54] stead that paid the price he said not
[1:03:57] trying to redeem something you can't
[1:04:00] redeem it because you ain't got the
[1:04:01] money to
[1:04:02] but God had the money and he sent Christ
[1:04:05] and settled the bill and redeemed you
[1:04:07] from your sickness from your sorrows and
[1:04:10] your worry and your sin and your
[1:04:11] backsliding he sent the money which was
[1:04:14] Christ Jesus and deposited it on Calvary
[1:04:17] on golgotha's hill and tonight every one
[1:04:20] of you is free what if you'll pay for it
[1:04:22] no if you'll believe it amen so we're
[1:04:26] looking to be redeemed back to something
[1:04:28] and we need to see that the Redeemer has
[1:04:30] it all in control himself that he
[1:04:32] himself is in full Authority that he's
[1:04:35] in full power that he's in his place of
[1:04:37] possession that he knows who and what he
[1:04:39] is and he has the real Goods amen it
[1:04:42] can't be a fake it's got to be the real
[1:04:43] deal
[1:04:44] we ought to be able to see if we're
[1:04:47] being redeemed back to a place then we
[1:04:49] ought to be able to see the person
[1:04:50] that's redeeming us living and acting in
[1:04:53] that place
[1:04:54] amen he ought to be setting the example
[1:04:56] for us to show us where he's taking us
[1:04:58] back to because the Redemption thing is
[1:05:00] a journey Redemption is a journey it's a
[1:05:02] process it's not a moment
[1:05:04] brother Brown would say this and the
[1:05:06] unfailing realities of the Living God he
[1:05:08] said when God made man in his own image
[1:05:10] he put him on the earth as a Lesser God
[1:05:12] Jesus declared it when he said is it not
[1:05:15] written in your laws that you are gods
[1:05:16] and if they called those Gods who the
[1:05:18] word of God come to which was the
[1:05:20] prophets how can you condemn me when I
[1:05:22] say I am the Son of God he said see they
[1:05:25] just couldn't understand it see but man
[1:05:28] was put here with the dominion over the
[1:05:30] Earth he had everything under his
[1:05:32] control and what Adam lost he says Jesus
[1:05:36] proved that he had restored remember the
[1:05:39] the disciples said even the wind and the
[1:05:41] waves obey him even nature obeys him see
[1:05:44] it wasn't just demon powers and it
[1:05:46] wasn't just diseases and it wasn't just
[1:05:48] discernment of all these things but they
[1:05:50] said even nature obeyed him because
[1:05:52] remember brother Branham said that Adam
[1:05:54] had fallen total control over nature
[1:05:57] he was a God on Earth
[1:06:00] and so everything that he lost Christ
[1:06:03] had to come back and show that he was in
[1:06:06] the Adam position again in perfect
[1:06:09] Authority in perfect control and perfect
[1:06:11] power so that he could say this is where
[1:06:14] I'm taking you to church this is where
[1:06:16] your Redemption that's what it looks
[1:06:18] like is what the supreme authority of
[1:06:21] somebody subjected to the power of God
[1:06:22] in their lives to have dominion over
[1:06:25] everything that's around them it says he
[1:06:27] stopped nature he raised the dead he
[1:06:29] done everything and the world is
[1:06:31] groaning today listen to this the Bible
[1:06:33] said for the manifestations of the sons
[1:06:35] of God for God to get his children again
[1:06:39] in realities to make things real
[1:06:42] that's what God wants for us is a
[1:06:44] reality in our life remember I said last
[1:06:46] time Satan would love nothing better
[1:06:48] than for us to come to church and Nod
[1:06:51] our heads to whatever the the minister
[1:06:54] might say
[1:06:55] and then walk out and never have a
[1:06:57] reality of it in our lives Satan would
[1:06:59] take that deal every time because what
[1:07:01] he's scared about is a real believer not
[1:07:03] a head-notting believer
[1:07:05] that's what we're looking for is the
[1:07:07] reality of Christ in our life amen then
[1:07:09] brother Bob says this statement he says
[1:07:11] it stumbles the people
[1:07:13] what stumbles the people there's a few
[1:07:16] things that stumble the people one they
[1:07:18] can't believe that God would dwell in
[1:07:19] flesh that was the problem when Jesus
[1:07:22] came was that they were looking for a
[1:07:24] messiah and then when it came it didn't
[1:07:26] match up to what they thought was
[1:07:28] possible because why why did they turn
[1:07:31] Christ down the majority the priesthood
[1:07:33] especially because he wouldn't
[1:07:35] acknowledge them
[1:07:37] and they said if he can't acknowledge us
[1:07:39] he can't be the real deal and that was
[1:07:41] their problem the scripture says they
[1:07:43] were jealous of him they were envious of
[1:07:44] him and that's why they turned him down
[1:07:46] not only that I read this morning they
[1:07:48] didn't just try to kill him they tried
[1:07:49] to kill Lazarus who was a testimony of
[1:07:52] the very power of God in Jesus
[1:07:54] that's how badly they hated what he was
[1:07:57] was because he had more than they had he
[1:08:00] he demonstrated more than they could
[1:08:01] ever imagine but he wouldn't acknowledge
[1:08:03] them and they were envious of it and
[1:08:06] then the people looked at that and they
[1:08:07] said God is doing the Miracles but God
[1:08:10] can't dwell in flesh
[1:08:12] and that's exactly what we had in this
[1:08:14] age we had God come down and dwell in
[1:08:16] flesh and those of you that know me just
[1:08:18] for the visitors sake I don't believe
[1:08:19] brother Brandon was God
[1:08:21] but I believe that God used that man
[1:08:23] perfectly
[1:08:25] he had to because brother Brandon would
[1:08:27] come out of the discernment and he'd say
[1:08:29] was what he said true
[1:08:33] he wasn't even speaking it was just God
[1:08:36] using his voice at that point that's how
[1:08:38] closely God stepped down into flesh
[1:08:40] brother Branham said he's here the same
[1:08:42] as he was 2000 years ago except the
[1:08:45] Corporal body except the literal body
[1:08:47] it was Christ using a man and brother
[1:08:49] Bradham says it stumbles the people when
[1:08:51] we talk about for God getting into his
[1:08:54] children not child not son of man
[1:08:58] Children You and I
[1:09:00] he's saying it stumbles you because you
[1:09:02] can't believe it
[1:09:04] and if you can believe that he would use
[1:09:06] it in Christ if you can believe that he
[1:09:08] would use it in brother Branham then you
[1:09:09] say but he could never use it in me
[1:09:12] and that's what stumbles you said you
[1:09:14] can't believe that he will come into you
[1:09:15] in the same way now listen I already
[1:09:17] said it before none of us is ever going
[1:09:19] to have the gift of brother Branham had
[1:09:20] that was the angel to the seventh Church
[1:09:22] age it was specific for him nobody else
[1:09:24] will ever have anything like it it's not
[1:09:26] going to come but he still has gifts in
[1:09:28] the church he still has discernment he
[1:09:30] still has people men and women that are
[1:09:32] LED of God I was talking to a brother
[1:09:34] the other day about discernment and he
[1:09:36] says I know sisters that have as big a
[1:09:38] gift of discernment as as the brothers
[1:09:40] do God is no he's no respect to a
[1:09:44] persons or of gender amen there's some
[1:09:46] things that sisters aren't allowed to do
[1:09:47] they're not allowed to be behind this
[1:09:49] Pulpit but they can speak in tongues
[1:09:51] they can prophesy they can have all of
[1:09:53] these gifts the same as the men can
[1:09:54] because God doesn't care anymore
[1:09:57] why because we're under a law of Grace
[1:09:59] now and it is for whosoever will I'll
[1:10:01] pour out my spirit on my sons and my
[1:10:03] daughters right on my handmaidens as
[1:10:06] well sisters don't sell yourself short
[1:10:08] now you have access to the very same
[1:10:10] holy spirit that us Brothers do amen
[1:10:12] in fact brother Bradham said he said
[1:10:14] Remember the women he says the sisters
[1:10:16] are often more sensitive to the spirit
[1:10:17] than the brothers are shame on us
[1:10:19] Brothers
[1:10:20] amen let's raise our level up amen let's
[1:10:24] get into it but then we have the people
[1:10:27] that are stumbled because they thought
[1:10:29] they already had the reality
[1:10:32] and that's what a denomination is is
[1:10:34] when you put the period behind it and
[1:10:36] you say I've got everything that I need
[1:10:38] and then God comes into greater reality
[1:10:40] and you say nope because what would that
[1:10:42] require you to do humble yourself
[1:10:45] to admit that you're not where you
[1:10:46] thought you were listen I freely admit
[1:10:49] I'm not in a Rapture Ready condition you
[1:10:51] know how I know because I'm not gone and
[1:10:53] you're not either so let's not pretend
[1:10:55] amen let's keep seeking more let's keep
[1:10:57] seeking more of the filling of the Holy
[1:10:59] Spirit more of a surrender in our life
[1:11:01] more of a sanctification in our lives
[1:11:03] amen so that he would have free access
[1:11:05] to use us the way he wants to use us in
[1:11:08] our life amen that's the prayer of my
[1:11:10] heart these days Lord use me
[1:11:13] I want to get out of here I want to get
[1:11:16] out of here if there's anything I want
[1:11:17] to do is get out of here
[1:11:20] that's the greatest desire of my heart
[1:11:23] see my children saved and get out of
[1:11:25] here that's it
[1:11:27] and when our last one's in brother
[1:11:29] sister we're gonna go it'll be a very
[1:11:31] short quick work and then we're out of
[1:11:32] here amen but I look forward to that but
[1:11:34] until then I say Lord keep working don't
[1:11:37] let me rest on my Laurels don't let me
[1:11:39] stop with the victories let's keep
[1:11:40] pressing the battle for each one of us
[1:11:42] amen
[1:11:43] you young women and young men you know
[1:11:45] what God loves to hear from you
[1:11:47] I am weak but Thou Art strong
[1:11:51] Jesus keep me from all wrong I'll be
[1:11:54] Satisfied as long as I walk let me walk
[1:11:57] close to thee because then you can
[1:11:59] understand that when he's got something
[1:12:01] for you you'll accept it because you
[1:12:03] recognize that there's something that
[1:12:05] you need that's more than what you have
[1:12:06] amen and it'll keep us humble and as
[1:12:09] we've read in the those quotes in the
[1:12:10] last few services our brother bam said
[1:12:12] humility he said God is humility and
[1:12:14] humility is God
[1:12:16] I was talking to a minister today and I
[1:12:18] said I'm very careful how I pray
[1:12:21] because I said I don't say Lord Make Me
[1:12:23] humble
[1:12:24] that's like praying for patience and you
[1:12:26] never want to pray for those things
[1:12:29] I said Lord keep me humble
[1:12:32] don't let me get to the point where you
[1:12:34] have to push me down let me stay down
[1:12:36] willingly Amen to not think more of
[1:12:39] myself than I ought to
[1:12:40] you I don't like The Humbling I'd rather
[1:12:42] stay where I'm at by God's grace yes I
[1:12:45] need more don't get me wrong I'm not
[1:12:47] saying I don't need more humility but
[1:12:48] I'm saying Lord Keep Me Down
[1:12:50] amen because that's when God can use you
[1:12:52] when you think you're something then God
[1:12:53] has completely put out of the picture
[1:12:55] amen not sure how I went there but the
[1:12:57] Lord knows amen but what is it that
[1:13:00] we're looking for we're looking for God
[1:13:02] to display himself in us that's it
[1:13:05] scripture scripture what your your
[1:13:07] lights your your candles your torches on
[1:13:09] a hill
[1:13:11] people need to be able to see that
[1:13:12] there's something in all of the darkness
[1:13:14] and all the mess and all the chaos and
[1:13:16] all of the isms and all of the social
[1:13:18] justice and programs and platforms today
[1:13:21] they need to see that there is sanity
[1:13:22] that their stability that there is
[1:13:25] something that holds true no matter what
[1:13:27] this world is going through amen amen
[1:13:29] what is it brother Adams he points to
[1:13:31] the manifestation of the sons of God he
[1:13:33] says that is what stumbles the people
[1:13:36] first that they think it can't happen
[1:13:38] and then two that it can't happen to
[1:13:40] them
[1:13:41] that can be in that great brother
[1:13:42] because he's a great Minister but never
[1:13:44] in me because I'm just a humble
[1:13:45] housewife a young single sister a young
[1:13:47] brother
[1:13:48] no no no no God's looking for
[1:13:50] surrendered Hearts listen if he can
[1:13:52] start with David when he's a little kid
[1:13:54] think
[1:13:55] Samuel before he's a teenager he could
[1:13:57] he could start with you anywhere
[1:14:00] and humble yourself and say Lord I need
[1:14:02] you and Lord I want to have you and Lord
[1:14:04] I want to have you completely in my life
[1:14:07] amen amen you got to get the goods so
[1:14:09] this is what we're talking about
[1:14:10] remember Redeemer can't redeem somebody
[1:14:12] unless he is in his full possession you
[1:14:14] got to have the goods before you can
[1:14:15] give the goods amen you got to have the
[1:14:17] new birth before you can tell somebody
[1:14:19] what the new birth is and lead them to
[1:14:20] it there's got to be the real thing in
[1:14:22] your life before you can do it God
[1:14:24] always brings it into you before he
[1:14:26] tells you to give it to somebody else
[1:14:27] before he gets you to point it you've
[1:14:29] got to have a reality before they do
[1:14:30] amen
[1:14:32] brother Brown says this and the message
[1:14:34] here you hear him he says all things are
[1:14:35] possible to them that believe we've got
[1:14:37] the untapped resources of God at our
[1:14:40] hands to do what
[1:14:42] to make ourselves look good to build a
[1:14:44] fine Ministry to draw people to us to
[1:14:47] prove
[1:14:49] that's a trick for the believer prove it
[1:14:51] no no no
[1:14:53] he says to display God
[1:14:57] amen that's all we're a vessel to
[1:14:59] display God we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:15:02] God and when God made man he made him a
[1:15:04] God he gave him a dominion over the
[1:15:06] Earth but his Fallen estate dropped that
[1:15:08] but what they lost by Adam it was
[1:15:10] restored by Christ he said if you say to
[1:15:13] this mountain be moved and don't doubt
[1:15:14] in your heart but believe that what you
[1:15:16] said shall come to pass you can have
[1:15:18] what you've said all things whatsoever
[1:15:20] you desire When you pray believe you
[1:15:23] receive it and you shall have it he says
[1:15:25] amen He restored to us all that was lost
[1:15:27] in Adam
[1:15:28] listen we saw Christ heal the sick we
[1:15:31] saw him raise the Dead
[1:15:33] we saw him cast out demons
[1:15:36] we saw him do all these wonderful works
[1:15:38] we saw him walk on water
[1:15:41] we saw him still the wind and the waves
[1:15:43] and yet that was not the greatest thing
[1:15:45] you know what the greatest victory that
[1:15:47] Christ had
[1:15:48] over himself
[1:15:50] that's what he had to prove to us is
[1:15:52] that there is victory over yourself in
[1:15:54] the word of God
[1:15:56] because that's the greatest thing he had
[1:15:58] to do was come to the place where even
[1:16:00] when he went to lay his life down he
[1:16:01] would say not my will but thine be done
[1:16:04] hey man he knew that he was meant to
[1:16:08] give it and he laid it down he gave the
[1:16:12] word authority over his very body and
[1:16:14] life that's how far he went with it amen
[1:16:16] he knew his purpose was to do what
[1:16:18] display the word of God for his time and
[1:16:21] he did it and it took him all the way
[1:16:22] into the grave
[1:16:24] listen this is how how good it was for
[1:16:27] Jesus there was a man of the Pharisees
[1:16:29] named Nicodemus a ruler the Jews that
[1:16:31] same came to Jesus by night said to him
[1:16:33] Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher
[1:16:35] come from God for no man can do these
[1:16:38] Miracles that thou doest except God be
[1:16:40] with them
[1:16:41] listen when you got the priesthood not
[1:16:43] just Nicodemus who we know was a a
[1:16:45] closet believer at least for a while but
[1:16:48] he says listen we know he says even if
[1:16:50] we don't want to admit it
[1:16:52] we know
[1:16:54] that you can't do this except to be of
[1:16:55] God
[1:16:57] but they couldn't accept him as the
[1:16:58] Christ could they as the Messiah but
[1:16:59] they knew that God was with them amen it
[1:17:02] was undeniable and yet they denied it
[1:17:03] because of their Petty envy that they
[1:17:05] had in their lives amen
[1:17:07] now I want to walk through this process
[1:17:09] as we start to get into the meat of the
[1:17:11] service here amen because remember we
[1:17:13] had five feasts and then we had the day
[1:17:15] of atonement which was the day of
[1:17:16] Jubilee but when Christ came things
[1:17:18] played out differently and I want to
[1:17:20] kind of work our way through the feasts
[1:17:22] here and there's just three of them but
[1:17:23] he started with the Feast of the
[1:17:25] Passover and that was the sacrifice and
[1:17:27] the eating of the Lamb if you remember
[1:17:28] now traditionally they had to eat the
[1:17:30] entire lamb that had been killed
[1:17:31] remember and if you didn't have enough
[1:17:33] people if you had a small family and a
[1:17:34] big lamb then they said bring your
[1:17:36] neighbor in because you've got to eat it
[1:17:37] all you've got to eat all of the Lamb
[1:17:40] you can't have anything left over and
[1:17:41] then they'd eat unleavened bread and
[1:17:42] they drink the wine and it was an
[1:17:44] example of being ready to go out quickly
[1:17:46] you know what it was a a reminder for us
[1:17:49] to do don't get tied down here
[1:17:52] don't get so caught up in things don't
[1:17:54] get so caught up in what's coming next
[1:17:56] but the next big step the next big
[1:17:58] vacation the next house the next vehicle
[1:18:00] the next move in your career that you
[1:18:02] forget that you've got to be ready to
[1:18:03] leave quickly nothing can be held dear
[1:18:06] here
[1:18:07] don't even make bread
[1:18:10] just leave it unleavened so you can just
[1:18:12] throw it in the oven and quick and you
[1:18:14] get it out and yeah it's hard and it's
[1:18:15] not so tasty but it had to be ready to
[1:18:17] go you had to have something you could
[1:18:18] take in your bag and go and it would
[1:18:19] hold up for a longer while amen but that
[1:18:22] was just a reflection of The Exodus from
[1:18:24] Egypt that's what the Passover was
[1:18:25] remember it was to memorialize The
[1:18:27] Exodus from Egypt
[1:18:29] but now it's a reflection of the Jubilee
[1:18:31] now Matthew 26 remember Jesus is is in
[1:18:34] the Passover and he says as they were
[1:18:35] eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it
[1:18:38] and break it and gave it to the
[1:18:39] disciples and said take eat this is my
[1:18:42] body remember Paul says in Corinthians
[1:18:44] 11 later First Corinthians 11 he says
[1:18:46] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:18:49] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[1:18:51] gave it to them saying drink ye all of
[1:18:53] it for this is my blood of the new
[1:18:56] testament which is shed for many for the
[1:18:59] remission of sins now the prophet of God
[1:19:01] would say this he said all down through
[1:19:02] the age it's been Revelation Revelation
[1:19:05] and tonight it's Revelation not an
[1:19:07] outward form not a declaration of Creeds
[1:19:10] not a group of prayers not a string of
[1:19:12] beads but a direct Revelation that God
[1:19:15] has revealed to you that Christ is your
[1:19:18] Passover Lamb that he bore your sins and
[1:19:21] you've accepted him as a sin offering in
[1:19:23] your stead he said Upon This Rock I'll
[1:19:25] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:19:28] shall not Prevail against it he said you
[1:19:30] see it's a revelation
[1:19:31] we get into problems when we think that
[1:19:34] something other than Christ is the thing
[1:19:36] that's keeping us where we're at that's
[1:19:37] giving us the victory that's done the
[1:19:39] work and it's usually ourselves we're
[1:19:41] injecting into the situation
[1:19:43] right I read the scripture where Paul
[1:19:45] says I do not frustrate the law of Grace
[1:19:47] I don't inject myself into it because
[1:19:50] the minute I get into performance
[1:19:52] anxiety Then I get in God's way
[1:19:54] but I gotta sit back and say I'm still
[1:19:56] under grace Lord as good as I get I'm
[1:19:59] still under grace because that's the
[1:20:01] only thing that's going to hold me until
[1:20:02] we get to the other side amen
[1:20:05] brother Brandon would say this he says
[1:20:07] communion was held first way down in
[1:20:09] Egypt the first of the communion which
[1:20:11] was the Passover Lamb that was slain
[1:20:13] which was the type of Christ
[1:20:15] and many of us are familiar with that
[1:20:16] blessed old story of how they who took
[1:20:19] the communion down there walked through
[1:20:20] the Wilderness for 40 years now catch
[1:20:23] this
[1:20:24] when they come out there wasn't a feeble
[1:20:27] one among them
[1:20:29] free indeed
[1:20:32] and there even their clothes was not
[1:20:34] even threadbare for 40 years God had
[1:20:37] kept them what a Blessed Assurance it is
[1:20:40] to us tonight if that be the type then
[1:20:43] Christ is the anti-type and how that God
[1:20:45] delivered the children says if that if
[1:20:48] he did that in the natural then what is
[1:20:50] he going to do in the Fulfillment of the
[1:20:52] type
[1:20:53] if that's how good it was under the the
[1:20:56] shadow then how good is it under the
[1:20:58] reality
[1:20:58] are you listening church when they took
[1:21:01] the communion and when you take the
[1:21:03] communion when you partake of Christ
[1:21:04] when you eat all of Christ when you take
[1:21:06] all of the word amen it will sustain you
[1:21:09] on your journey
[1:21:11] because this is a journey the Jubilee is
[1:21:14] a journey it's not just a day but it's
[1:21:16] taking you somewhere brother Bob said
[1:21:18] Redemption has taken you out of
[1:21:19] something and into something and Jubilee
[1:21:22] didn't just take you out of prison but
[1:21:24] it took you back to your inheritance it
[1:21:26] didn't just take you out of slavery but
[1:21:27] it took you back to your family
[1:21:29] and on that Journey their sustenance and
[1:21:33] God always makes a way amen God has a
[1:21:35] provided way for you so that no matter
[1:21:37] what happens you'll always make it
[1:21:39] through your clothes won't wear out your
[1:21:41] shoes won't wear out you'll have food
[1:21:42] and you'll have water and you'll have a
[1:21:44] Guiding Light all the way through you'll
[1:21:46] have the presence of God with you
[1:21:48] Paul would say this in Philippians he
[1:21:50] says being confident of this very thing
[1:21:52] that he which had begun a good work in
[1:21:55] you has he begun it
[1:21:57] yeah
[1:21:58] so say this with me we'll perform it
[1:22:01] until the day of Jesus Christ
[1:22:04] the day of Jesus Christ is the ultimate
[1:22:07] Jubilee
[1:22:08] no man knoweth the day we're preaching
[1:22:10] on the day of Jubilee or the hour and
[1:22:13] there comes an hour of Jubilee and
[1:22:14] that's in a moment in the blinking of an
[1:22:16] eye
[1:22:17] will be caught up to meet him in the air
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:21] this is the process of full deliverance
[1:22:23] and it starts with a perfect sacrifice
[1:22:28] we still needed a perfect sacrifice to
[1:22:30] go through this amen it's it starts with
[1:22:32] what Christ calling you out and what is
[1:22:35] it that's the trumpet that's the gospel
[1:22:37] letting you know you can go free
[1:22:40] and that's the start of it is you've got
[1:22:41] to hear the trumpet and you've got to
[1:22:43] know that the price is paid amen you got
[1:22:45] to know the day you're living in the day
[1:22:47] of atonement back then and you had to
[1:22:49] hear the sound you had to hear the
[1:22:51] gospel trumpet in that day brother badam
[1:22:53] is pointing to this Exodus out of Egypt
[1:22:54] he says that was the first of the
[1:22:57] jubilees he says and it's always the
[1:22:58] start of a journey a jubilee always
[1:23:00] takes you somewhere that's the biggest
[1:23:03] problem we face I think as Believers is
[1:23:05] that we we go in we maybe we're in a
[1:23:08] service maybe we're in prayer and and
[1:23:10] we're seeking freedom and God gives us
[1:23:12] freedom and then what do we do with that
[1:23:13] freedom
[1:23:15] we stay right where we are and we don't
[1:23:17] do anything with it
[1:23:19] God sets us free for a purpose and it's
[1:23:21] to bring you to your position it's to
[1:23:24] bring you to your places to bring you to
[1:23:25] your land is to bring you to your
[1:23:27] inheritance it's to bring you into
[1:23:28] fellowship with him
[1:23:30] he doesn't just want you to sit there
[1:23:31] and say praise the Lord I'm free but he
[1:23:33] wants you to go to the place that he's
[1:23:35] prepared for you as well
[1:23:36] amen amen amen then after that they had
[1:23:39] the Feast of unleavened bread now
[1:23:41] unleavened bread you've got to remember
[1:23:42] as the name says it has no leaven in it
[1:23:45] so what does leaven do to bread it lifts
[1:23:47] it off it Puffs it up it puts air inside
[1:23:49] of it
[1:23:50] it's false it's false humility so often
[1:23:54] it's really Pride that Puffs it up but
[1:23:56] remember this is the starting point for
[1:23:58] every believer and Christ fulfilled that
[1:24:00] because he was the perfect word there is
[1:24:02] no spot or wrinkle found in him remember
[1:24:04] he was before and he was judged we
[1:24:06] covered this in previous services and
[1:24:08] everything that they tried to do to him
[1:24:09] yet they had no witnesses that could say
[1:24:11] anything that he did wrong Gentile or
[1:24:13] Jew nobody found any fault in him
[1:24:15] remember he lived a perfect life by the
[1:24:17] word of God and so he was a perfect
[1:24:19] example that if we could live our lives
[1:24:21] by the word that is untainted it would
[1:24:23] have the perfect result that's why we
[1:24:26] needed a Malachi 4 Prophet to come and
[1:24:28] restore us the word is because you can't
[1:24:30] get a Perfect Bride without a perfect
[1:24:31] word and we've been so tied up in
[1:24:34] doctrines and denominations and men's
[1:24:35] ideas and these different things many of
[1:24:37] them very spiritual
[1:24:40] but not perfect
[1:24:42] and our profit wasn't perfect but he
[1:24:43] came to restore us back to a perfect
[1:24:45] word that was brought to us not only by
[1:24:47] Christ but by the Apostle Paul and these
[1:24:49] different ones amen we needed a
[1:24:51] restoring messenger because we had to
[1:24:52] have the fullness of the word so that we
[1:24:54] could be the fullness of the word if I
[1:24:56] could put it that way
[1:24:58] brother Brown says this this is a month
[1:25:00] less than a month before he died he says
[1:25:02] no leaven among you that brings the
[1:25:05] entire fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:25:07] among you
[1:25:09] now you read that and you say brother
[1:25:11] John does that mean I have to be perfect
[1:25:12] my life has to be perfect no he said no
[1:25:15] leaven among you
[1:25:16] remember what was the 11 of the
[1:25:18] Pharisees
[1:25:19] what did Jesus say to him about their
[1:25:21] leaven he says this people draws nigh to
[1:25:24] me with their mouth
[1:25:25] and honors me with their lips but their
[1:25:27] heart is far from me but in vain they do
[1:25:30] worship me teaching for doctrines the
[1:25:32] Commandments of men
[1:25:34] so remember we talked last service about
[1:25:36] the little isms that brother Branham
[1:25:38] warned us about and listen we've got
[1:25:39] them floating around in the message too
[1:25:41] where you have to sit under a certain
[1:25:43] Ministry you have to believe a
[1:25:44] particular Doctrine you have to preach a
[1:25:46] certain way you have to focus on this
[1:25:48] and you have to ignore that and we got
[1:25:50] churches that are cold and starchy you
[1:25:52] got churches that blow up the minute you
[1:25:54] say one word from behind the pulpit and
[1:25:55] everything in between and half of them
[1:25:57] think that if you aren't just like them
[1:25:58] then you're wrong
[1:26:00] that's what teaching for doctrines the
[1:26:03] Commandments of men it's putting our
[1:26:04] little ideas to what spirituality is
[1:26:06] rather than letting the word have its
[1:26:08] way and the Holy Spirit have its way
[1:26:09] listen you're not going to go to every
[1:26:12] country in the world and they're going
[1:26:13] to be able to to sing and worship like
[1:26:15] our African brothers and sisters good
[1:26:17] luck getting white people to do that
[1:26:18] ain't gonna happen you guys are lucky
[1:26:22] right
[1:26:23] but sometimes you need to sit still and
[1:26:26] nobody beats a German that's sitting
[1:26:27] still
[1:26:28] and just listening and receiving amen
[1:26:30] that's why God has a a multitude of
[1:26:33] flowers in the garden amen each one of
[1:26:35] us he works with us according to the way
[1:26:37] that we are that's what's so beautiful
[1:26:38] is he doesn't try and put us into this
[1:26:40] one box or pattern but he works with us
[1:26:42] the way that he made us and so he can
[1:26:45] worship with with our African brothers
[1:26:46] and sisters you go over to Japan listen
[1:26:49] they don't worship like anybody
[1:26:51] you think the Germans are bad go look at
[1:26:53] the Japanese it's just not the same but
[1:26:55] that doesn't mean the spirit of the
[1:26:56] Lord's not there
[1:26:58] you may not shout and dance around the
[1:27:00] way we do but that doesn't mean the
[1:27:01] spirit of the Lord's not there just
[1:27:02] means they're different amen but we get
[1:27:05] these little isms and brother Bram says
[1:27:06] what no leaven among you we need to
[1:27:09] break down those walls and barriers
[1:27:10] listen I'm not talking about we're going
[1:27:12] to have a fellowship with people that
[1:27:13] have wrong Doctrine no no no I'm saying
[1:27:15] let's not make a Doctrine the pet that
[1:27:16] gets you into the Rapture and keeps them
[1:27:18] out
[1:27:20] he says he couldn't do it in Luther's
[1:27:22] age couldn't do it in Wesley's age
[1:27:23] couldn't do it in a Pentecostal age but
[1:27:25] in the day when the son of man will be
[1:27:27] manifested revealed brought back the
[1:27:29] church together with the entire deity of
[1:27:32] God amongst his people
[1:27:34] showing the same visible signs amongst
[1:27:36] his people this isn't brother Brown just
[1:27:38] talking about himself
[1:27:39] he talks he says promised by Malachi 4
[1:27:42] but he keeps pointing to people
[1:27:44] that's more than one person
[1:27:47] people multitudes he's talking about a
[1:27:49] bride body now
[1:27:50] he says showing the same visible signs
[1:27:52] manifesting himself like he did at the
[1:27:54] beginning when he was manifested on
[1:27:56] Earth in the form of a prophet God oh he
[1:27:59] says Glory promised by Malachi 4
[1:28:01] promised by the rest of the scriptures
[1:28:03] he says where do you worship at the
[1:28:05] house of God seated in
[1:28:08] where are we seated in today
[1:28:11] is brother Brown I'm the only one seated
[1:28:13] in Heavenly places
[1:28:15] no we all are and they have been since
[1:28:17] Paul preached it
[1:28:19] and before Paul preached it just because
[1:28:21] Paul preached it didn't mean they
[1:28:22] weren't seated in Heavenly places with
[1:28:23] Christ we're all there
[1:28:25] we're all there brother I'm saying
[1:28:27] listen you got to recognize where God is
[1:28:29] and it's not just in the ministry it's
[1:28:31] not just in the men it's not just in the
[1:28:33] elders it's not just in the pastor
[1:28:35] listen he's seated in each and every one
[1:28:37] that is a temple of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:28:40] we want the reality of gods in our life
[1:28:42] of God in our life not God's in our life
[1:28:45] story we want the reality of gods in our
[1:28:47] life amen and we need the purity of the
[1:28:49] word and that means we've got to be
[1:28:51] feeding on the word of God daily
[1:28:54] listen I was I was talking with someone
[1:28:56] earlier this week
[1:28:58] so here's what happens when church is
[1:28:59] your only experience remember we're
[1:29:02] going to say up
[1:29:03] is spiritual
[1:29:06] well Joe we're going to use your words
[1:29:07] here
[1:29:09] down is religious okay
[1:29:12] this is backsliding
[1:29:15] and this is walking
[1:29:20] in the light and we can't see this
[1:29:22] probably back there can we let me see if
[1:29:24] I can get a better marker okay so what
[1:29:27] happens when we're when church is the
[1:29:29] only thing we get hope this is okay
[1:29:32] remember if you're not moving forward if
[1:29:34] you're not building yourself up in the
[1:29:35] Most Holy Faith in the week you're not
[1:29:37] moving forward so what are you doing
[1:29:39] you're going down
[1:29:40] then we hit Wednesday
[1:29:42] and what do we do
[1:29:44] we get a boost
[1:29:47] we don't feed ourselves
[1:29:49] we get to Sunday
[1:29:51] what do we do
[1:29:56] right where we started
[1:29:59] you know we call this
[1:30:01] walking in the desert
[1:30:04] but what happens to the one that's
[1:30:06] feeding themselves now I'm not saying
[1:30:07] that when you feed yourself it's the
[1:30:09] same as coming to church I'm not trying
[1:30:10] to say that what I'm saying is you're
[1:30:12] moving forward you're moving up and so
[1:30:15] let's say you're let's say you're the
[1:30:17] weakest of believers
[1:30:21] you only get up a little bit
[1:30:23] right you're not not moving very far but
[1:30:26] you're up and then you hit Wednesday and
[1:30:27] then what do you do you jump up
[1:30:30] then you go to Sunday
[1:30:32] you're going all the way in just a
[1:30:33] little bit then you get to Sunday and
[1:30:34] you go here look at the difference
[1:30:37] between those two people
[1:30:39] just a little bit
[1:30:41] just a little bit amen
[1:30:43] you know what's supposed to happen this
[1:30:45] is a house of correction remember
[1:30:47] this is where the movement is and then
[1:30:50] these are the bumpers this lets you know
[1:30:52] if you're on the right path you know
[1:30:53] what's supposed to be happening during
[1:30:55] this time
[1:30:56] you're supposed to be recognizing the
[1:30:58] word you're supposed to be recognizing
[1:31:00] the presence of God so that when you
[1:31:02] come in here you recognize it when it's
[1:31:04] here too so that is The Minister's
[1:31:06] preaching you can say amen I read that
[1:31:08] this week I read that that last week I
[1:31:10] know what he's saying is the truth
[1:31:12] because I've read my Bible listen I can
[1:31:14] make quotes say anything I want
[1:31:17] I can literally preach Antichrist
[1:31:19] Doctrine directly out of the message I
[1:31:21] can preach preach Antichrist messages
[1:31:24] right out of this Bible
[1:31:25] right because that's what they did they
[1:31:27] twist things around with the scriptures
[1:31:28] but if I'm preaching to a people that
[1:31:31] has been doing this all week then what
[1:31:33] do you have you have a constant
[1:31:34] trajectory
[1:31:35] like that rather than this around and
[1:31:39] around and around and the thing is you
[1:31:41] wonder why you don't have the victory
[1:31:43] it's because you're never above where
[1:31:44] you started the week amen
[1:31:55] the holy spirit's the teacher
[1:31:57] listen he's given us a five-fold
[1:31:59] Ministry for the perfecting of the
[1:32:00] Saints but that doesn't get you out of
[1:32:02] the responsibility of doing your portion
[1:32:04] amen you know what it's like listen
[1:32:07] we come into church when it when it's
[1:32:09] special meetings and I can say this
[1:32:11] tonight because it's a wonderful
[1:32:11] atmosphere tonight
[1:32:13] I can say as we come into special means
[1:32:15] and what is it we're ready to go we're
[1:32:17] prayed up we got we got our needs ready
[1:32:19] to go and we're expecting
[1:32:21] listen when you do that during the week
[1:32:23] you come in completely different than if
[1:32:25] you're just going around because what
[1:32:27] you're trying to do is you're trying to
[1:32:28] get the ministry to raise you up rather
[1:32:30] than let God work with you through the
[1:32:32] entire week you don't have to make big
[1:32:33] steps you just have to make steps that's
[1:32:36] all you're looking for is to keep going
[1:32:38] up so that Satan can't drag you down
[1:32:40] over and over and over again amen
[1:32:43] after that was the Feast of the first
[1:32:45] fruits amen and this was the early
[1:32:46] Harvest and if you remember it was The
[1:32:48] Barley which was the the common the the
[1:32:50] common grain it wasn't the the one that
[1:32:52] was most valued but it was the quick one
[1:32:54] and it kind of got them through if they
[1:32:55] they had a poor harvest before that was
[1:32:57] the one that came quick and kind of
[1:32:58] saved them and whatnot and if the first
[1:33:00] fruits was good then they waived it
[1:33:01] remember and it was proof that what was
[1:33:03] coming was going to be just like the one
[1:33:05] they waved if it had started to grow and
[1:33:07] they had a first fruit it meant that
[1:33:08] there was a crop coming and even though
[1:33:10] it would take longer
[1:33:12] it was going to be good as well if the
[1:33:14] first was good then the end would be
[1:33:16] good amen if Alpha was good then Omega
[1:33:18] was going to be good if the first was
[1:33:20] going to be good then the last was going
[1:33:21] to be good but what was the first fruit
[1:33:23] that Christ showed because we sit here
[1:33:25] and we look at the signs and wonders and
[1:33:27] we look at the healings we look at all
[1:33:28] these different things and that was good
[1:33:30] that was proof that he could redeem us
[1:33:32] to that position but what is Our Hope
[1:33:36] our hope is not just to be here doing
[1:33:38] signs and wonders or at least I hope
[1:33:39] it's not
[1:33:40] our hope is to get out of here
[1:33:43] our hope is that if we die we'll raise
[1:33:45] again and our hope is that those that
[1:33:47] are alive and remain will be caught up
[1:33:48] amen that is the great hope because I'm
[1:33:51] still fighting this flesh even after the
[1:33:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit even after
[1:33:54] the infilling of the spirit I'm still
[1:33:56] fighting I want to get out of the fight
[1:33:58] the fight with this and then what
[1:34:01] happens we'll come back with him as king
[1:34:02] of kings and Lord of lords and then
[1:34:04] we'll have a battle where we can never
[1:34:05] be defeated amen but we got to get
[1:34:07] through this battle time first and what
[1:34:09] do we want to do we want to get out of
[1:34:10] the battle
[1:34:11] we want to have our three and a half
[1:34:12] year rest at the marriage supper of the
[1:34:14] land amen we want to take our our break
[1:34:17] we want to be with our bridegroom we
[1:34:20] want to spend time with him where Satan
[1:34:21] can't get at us anymore amen that's what
[1:34:24] we're looking for so Paul said in First
[1:34:26] Corinthians he says if there be no
[1:34:28] resurrection of the dead then is Christ
[1:34:30] not risen why because his experience is
[1:34:33] our experience he's the first fruit so
[1:34:35] whatever he does we do and if we don't
[1:34:37] rise that means he didn't rise
[1:34:39] and if Christ be not risen then as our
[1:34:41] preaching in vain and your faith also in
[1:34:43] vain
[1:34:44] and if Christ be not raised your faith
[1:34:46] is in vain ye are yet in your sins
[1:34:47] basically says if Christ didn't rise
[1:34:49] then the whole work was no good
[1:34:52] then also they also which are fallen
[1:34:54] asleep in Christ are perished so we've
[1:34:56] been believing a lie if in this life
[1:34:58] only we have hope in Christ we are of
[1:35:01] all men most miserable amen
[1:35:04] what is it there's a life after this
[1:35:05] that we're really looking forward to
[1:35:07] amen
[1:35:08] after all this life is over and our
[1:35:10] works on Earth are ended and we stand
[1:35:13] before the Mountaintop so tall all all
[1:35:15] looking over in that City
[1:35:18] that the savior is preparing gives me
[1:35:20] faith that I can make it after all amen
[1:35:22] he says but now as Christ risen from the
[1:35:25] dead now present tense and become the
[1:35:28] first fruits of them that slept for
[1:35:30] since my Man Came Death by man also came
[1:35:34] also the resurrection of the Dead for as
[1:35:36] in Adam I'll die even so in Christ shall
[1:35:38] all be made alive but every man in his
[1:35:41] own order Christ the firstfruits
[1:35:43] afterward they that are Christ at his
[1:35:45] coming so when did he become the first
[1:35:47] fruits when he healed the blind man when
[1:35:49] he when he healed the lepers when he
[1:35:50] cast The Demon out of the man of godira
[1:35:52] when he walked on the water when he
[1:35:54] caused the wind and the waves to to
[1:35:56] cease no when he rose from the dead amen
[1:36:00] if he didn't rise from the dead then it
[1:36:02] was all in vain that's what Paul said
[1:36:03] we're looking for what a body change
[1:36:06] we're looking for a supernatural body
[1:36:08] we're looking for for a glorified body
[1:36:10] amen where we don't have to fight
[1:36:11] anymore where we can have our rest and
[1:36:13] relaxation amen and what what did he do
[1:36:16] it for why did he do it
[1:36:20] to take away our fear of laying down our
[1:36:21] lives
[1:36:23] listen he believed the word to the point
[1:36:24] where he gave his life up he gave up the
[1:36:28] ghost remember he says I no one takes my
[1:36:31] life I give it
[1:36:33] he gave up his life he allowed himself
[1:36:36] to die because he believed that the word
[1:36:38] that said he was going to have to die
[1:36:40] also said that he was going to raise up
[1:36:42] and then he'd pick it up again on the
[1:36:44] third day amen what was he trying to do
[1:36:45] give us faith that we can trust that we
[1:36:48] can have assurance that if we take the
[1:36:50] word of God he'll never see it not come
[1:36:53] to pass
[1:36:54] that's all he's trying to get us to do
[1:36:55] that is the great question for us is
[1:36:58] will it stumble us or will we step out
[1:36:59] in faith and say the same thing that he
[1:37:01] did for Christ the same thing that he
[1:37:03] did in Christ I should say is the same
[1:37:05] thing that he's going to do in me
[1:37:07] what was he saying you can't lose if you
[1:37:09] die out now
[1:37:11] I was reading this morning where where
[1:37:13] Jesus said except a corn a wheat fall on
[1:37:15] the ground and die it die it abides
[1:37:17] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[1:37:19] much fruit you can't bring out forth any
[1:37:22] fruit in yourself now remember when a
[1:37:23] corn dies it goes down it comes up and
[1:37:25] then it builds a whole thing right so
[1:37:27] you know if you've ever eaten corn like
[1:37:28] brother vichel you know there's a lot of
[1:37:29] corn on a cob right it's not just one
[1:37:31] there's a lot of them and Jesus said
[1:37:33] listen when you go down and die when I
[1:37:35] go down and die says I'm going to bring
[1:37:36] a lot with me and when you go down and
[1:37:38] die what do you bring you can you can't
[1:37:40] bring forth any fruit that's lasting in
[1:37:42] yourself but when you die you come back
[1:37:43] and you bring something with you amen
[1:37:45] something that's going to last something
[1:37:46] that has Eternal value
[1:37:48] so we went through the three different
[1:37:50] feasts and it's three but if we followed
[1:37:51] the law of Moses we'd have two more
[1:37:53] before we get to the Feast of atonement
[1:37:56] but we know that the Jubilee is going to
[1:37:57] be next because it's going to be
[1:37:58] Pentecost so what happened there why
[1:38:00] don't we have to go to the Feast of
[1:38:02] atonement because remember the Feast of
[1:38:04] atonement was proof that the price was
[1:38:05] paid for your debt
[1:38:07] remember when we have Christ dying then
[1:38:10] what was that for us that wasn't just
[1:38:12] unatonement that was the atonement
[1:38:15] prophet of God would say that was an
[1:38:17] eternal atonement so when you have an
[1:38:20] eternal atonement and you have an
[1:38:21] eternal day of atonement then what do
[1:38:23] you have
[1:38:25] you have an everlasting day of jubilee
[1:38:26] don't you
[1:38:28] that means that you the the trumpet can
[1:38:30] sound every day and you can go free
[1:38:32] every day that your price is paid every
[1:38:34] day that you can go to your inheritance
[1:38:36] every day that you can be restored to
[1:38:38] your position you can be restored to
[1:38:39] your family you can be restored to your
[1:38:41] place you can be restored to Fellowship
[1:38:43] every single day without anybody being
[1:38:45] able to hold anything against you when
[1:38:47] he died he paid the price and the price
[1:38:49] is paid for what had been done what was
[1:38:52] being done and what was going to be done
[1:38:53] the price was covered the blood is is
[1:38:55] perfect in these different things amen
[1:38:57] we don't have to wait for the Harvest we
[1:39:00] don't catch this we don't have to work
[1:39:02] for it
[1:39:04] we don't have to work for it the price
[1:39:06] is paid we don't have to stay in that
[1:39:08] slavery we just have to wait until what
[1:39:12] the day of Pentecost
[1:39:14] we just got to wait 50 days
[1:39:16] that's all we need it's not 190 anymore
[1:39:19] it's 50.
[1:39:20] you don't have to pay the price
[1:39:22] program said but thank God rich and
[1:39:24] mercy he sent forth A Savior Jesus
[1:39:26] Christ he sent forth Jesus to be both
[1:39:28] Savior and healer for he said as Moses
[1:39:31] lifted up the breast servant in the
[1:39:32] wilderness so must the son of man be
[1:39:34] lifted up
[1:39:35] for the same purpose he the atonement
[1:39:38] that's what we have claim upon nothing
[1:39:39] but the atonement
[1:39:41] I want you to catch that
[1:39:43] you have no claim to the promises of God
[1:39:46] except by the atonement
[1:39:49] so often we go and we say Lord I've done
[1:39:50] this I've been faithful that no no no no
[1:39:54] that's what gets him to trust you but
[1:39:56] that's not what gives you access to him
[1:39:59] that's what gives him access to you if
[1:40:02] you think about it
[1:40:03] is when you're surrendered when you're
[1:40:05] when you're you're letting him have
[1:40:06] pre-evidence and you're doing well
[1:40:08] that's him having access to you to do
[1:40:10] something good but that's not what the
[1:40:12] requirement is for you to get the
[1:40:13] blessings and and the good things of God
[1:40:14] for healing in this particular case
[1:40:17] he says what nothing but the atonement
[1:40:20] that's what we have claim upon what
[1:40:22] Jesus purchased by his blood that's what
[1:40:23] we have claims upon the Bible said he
[1:40:25] was wounded for our transgressions he
[1:40:27] was bruised for our iniquity the
[1:40:28] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:40:30] and with his stripes we were healed
[1:40:32] that's what we can claim because that's
[1:40:35] what the atonement that we stand for
[1:40:37] ordered for us he says God rich in Mercy
[1:40:41] that was to be an eternal atonement
[1:40:43] because he came himself God came himself
[1:40:47] in the form of sinful flesh to make an
[1:40:49] eternal atonement and suffered In the
[1:40:51] Flesh and made the atonement and
[1:40:53] returned back in the form of the Holy
[1:40:55] Ghost to confirm that atonement
[1:40:57] we're no brass serpent or no Troubled
[1:41:00] Water could do it it all pointed to that
[1:41:02] perfect atonement he said God rich in
[1:41:05] his Mercy has did this no waiting
[1:41:09] there's no waiting you can go free now
[1:41:13] now
[1:41:15] right you don't have to be prayed for
[1:41:18] you don't have to come forward
[1:41:19] when the trumpet sounds you can go free
[1:41:21] right there you can drop your hoe as we
[1:41:24] read walk away and say you can't touch
[1:41:26] me anymore that's what he's talking
[1:41:28] about amen so we don't have to go to a
[1:41:29] feast of atonement because we have an
[1:41:31] eternal atonement that is constantly
[1:41:32] there until the taking away the bride
[1:41:34] hey the blood's still on is still on the
[1:41:36] mercy CD amen there's still Grace
[1:41:38] there's still Mercy today
[1:41:39] Paul would say this in Hebrews he said
[1:41:41] but Christ being common high priest of
[1:41:43] good things to come by a greater more
[1:41:45] perfect Tabernacle not made with hands
[1:41:48] that is to say not of this building
[1:41:49] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[1:41:51] but by his own blood he entered in once
[1:41:54] into the holy Place having obtained
[1:41:57] Eternal Redemption for us an eternal
[1:42:01] atonement gives us Eternal Redemption
[1:42:02] means that it's a finished work at
[1:42:04] Calvary
[1:42:06] there's nothing left to do remember
[1:42:07] brother Brown would say he says I can't
[1:42:09] if Christ was himself here in the
[1:42:11] Corporal body he couldn't heal you any
[1:42:13] more than he did two thousand years ago
[1:42:14] it's a finished work he says you just
[1:42:16] have to believe it and accept it immense
[1:42:19] have finished work brother Brian said
[1:42:21] here's the quote he says when Jesus died
[1:42:22] at Calvary he settled the same question
[1:42:24] forever before the father because he was
[1:42:27] a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was
[1:42:29] our Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:42:32] so if we look now at our feast days this
[1:42:35] is where we used to be was we used to
[1:42:37] have to come all the way to here
[1:42:38] so now we're under grace we're not under
[1:42:40] the law so this is not what we have to
[1:42:42] wait for but now our atonement is right
[1:42:44] at the front
[1:42:46] the atonement happens right there and so
[1:42:48] then we've just got unleavened bread the
[1:42:49] purity of the word we've got the first
[1:42:51] fruits which is Christ himself and then
[1:42:53] you call them all the way up to
[1:42:54] Pentecost and it's a finished work
[1:42:56] not just in him but it's a finished work
[1:42:58] in you you don't have to wait for any of
[1:43:00] these things now we remember that that
[1:43:03] that it's a 50-day cycle and if you
[1:43:05] remember in Leviticus 25 it says you
[1:43:07] shall hallow the 50th year Proclaim
[1:43:09] Liberty throughout all the land unto all
[1:43:11] the inhabitants thereof it shall be a
[1:43:13] jubilee to you and you shall return
[1:43:15] every man to his possession you should
[1:43:16] return every man to his family so we
[1:43:18] have the number 50 going up to the day
[1:43:20] of Pentecost and then we have the number
[1:43:22] 50 for the 50th year which is the Year
[1:43:24] of Jubilee and that's not a coincidence
[1:43:25] God has a numerology and I don't get
[1:43:28] stuck on it but God has a numerology and
[1:43:30] there's a reason why he does things amen
[1:43:32] so remember we talked about it in the in
[1:43:34] the previous verses God said in judgment
[1:43:36] to Israel he says you missed out on the
[1:43:38] jubilees and so you'll pay one year for
[1:43:41] every Jubilee you'll pay one year in
[1:43:43] slavery for every every Jubilee day that
[1:43:45] you missed remember that so it's one
[1:43:48] year for a day then coming around now
[1:43:50] when he's setting them free God says
[1:43:52] you'll wait one day for every year
[1:43:55] see judgment makes you wait long for
[1:43:57] short now when mercy comes it gives you
[1:43:59] short for long gives you one day for
[1:44:00] every year so he says now you've got to
[1:44:02] wait 50 days for the 50 years that
[1:44:04] you're supposed to have to wait
[1:44:06] amen so it's a perfect part it's a
[1:44:08] perfect type being brought now
[1:44:10] right this is where we see what God was
[1:44:12] really meaning brother I would say 50 is
[1:44:14] Pentecost and he says Jubilee
[1:44:17] then in Acts 2 it says and when the day
[1:44:19] of Pentecost was fully come they were
[1:44:21] all with one Accord in one place and
[1:44:23] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:44:25] as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:44:26] filled all the house where they were
[1:44:28] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:44:29] cloven tongues like as of fire and it
[1:44:32] sat upon each of them and they were all
[1:44:34] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:44:36] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:44:38] gave them utterance
[1:44:39] now I want to stop there we keep I know
[1:44:42] I keep referring to it in Joel 2 28 but
[1:44:44] he says I'm going to pour out my spirit
[1:44:45] upon All Flesh
[1:44:48] these days we have this great push for
[1:44:50] equity and diversity and inclusion
[1:44:53] listen this was the first great Equity
[1:44:55] diversity and inclusion that you'll ever
[1:44:57] see and God said if you obeyed my word
[1:44:59] and you went up and you waited in that
[1:45:01] room you got the Holy Ghost it didn't
[1:45:03] matter if you were poor or Rich male or
[1:45:06] female a minister a member of the lady
[1:45:08] didn't matter slave didn't matter your
[1:45:11] past didn't matter your family name good
[1:45:13] or bad didn't matter how much money you
[1:45:15] had in your pocket didn't matter how
[1:45:17] much you've been sweating and stinking
[1:45:18] or if you were perfectly perfumed if you
[1:45:21] obeyed the word of God then you got the
[1:45:22] Holy Ghost
[1:45:23] every single one of them 120 120 people
[1:45:27] came out of there full of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:29] and every single one of them had signs
[1:45:31] and wonders going on every single one of
[1:45:33] them is talking and everyone understands
[1:45:35] what they're saying no matter what their
[1:45:36] natural language was their native
[1:45:37] language was
[1:45:39] that's for us church that's the true
[1:45:41] Jubilee because remember the type of
[1:45:43] Jubilee was only for the Hebrew it was
[1:45:45] only for the Israelite it was only for
[1:45:46] the children of Abraham naturally
[1:45:48] speaking but they go up there and it
[1:45:50] doesn't matter who you are now
[1:45:52] anyone can go free
[1:45:54] that's what we're looking at in these
[1:45:55] things amen
[1:45:57] and so it is today Acts 2 38 is still
[1:45:59] the key
[1:46:00] we've forgotten it in the message I fear
[1:46:03] we've forgotten it because it says what
[1:46:05] repent and be baptized and you shall
[1:46:07] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:46:09] brother Branham said the evidence of the
[1:46:11] Holy Ghost is what receiving the word
[1:46:14] for your day
[1:46:17] remember what Jesus said
[1:46:20] he said how be it when he the spirit of
[1:46:22] Truth has come he will guide you into
[1:46:24] all Truth for he shall not speak of
[1:46:27] himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[1:46:29] that shall he speak and he will show you
[1:46:30] things to come we've got people saying
[1:46:32] today that the message is the Holy Ghost
[1:46:34] that's a contradiction of scripture
[1:46:36] remember in Revelation it says he that
[1:46:38] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:46:40] is saying
[1:46:42] so the spirit is saying something and
[1:46:45] you've got to have the spirit to hear
[1:46:47] and recognize and then you've got to
[1:46:49] have the spirit to receive it amen
[1:46:52] amen because otherwise we sit in here
[1:46:53] and we turn this message into an
[1:46:55] intellectual Revelation where we know
[1:46:57] the doctrines but we lack the reality
[1:46:59] and the life of the Christ that gave it
[1:47:01] to us we lack the very holy spirit that
[1:47:03] spoke it but because we recognize it as
[1:47:05] truth we say that makes us as Believers
[1:47:07] no you've got to have the life of it
[1:47:09] because the letter killeth and the
[1:47:11] letter of the message still kills if you
[1:47:13] don't have the spirit quickening it
[1:47:14] inside of your life amen why because
[1:47:16] truth is not words truth is a person
[1:47:20] right truth is a reality not just a
[1:47:23] Doctrine and I'm going to prove it to
[1:47:25] you by the word amen how do I know
[1:47:27] gravity is real because it works
[1:47:30] how do I know the word of God is real
[1:47:31] because it works
[1:47:33] Jesus said unto him I am the way the
[1:47:37] truth and the life no man coming to the
[1:47:40] father but by me it's all in Christ
[1:47:42] remember he's the open door he's the
[1:47:44] word The Truth May manifest and he's the
[1:47:48] life that makes the word a reality
[1:47:49] inside of us
[1:47:50] so you've got to have him inside of you
[1:47:53] to have the life otherwise you've just
[1:47:55] got the letter
[1:47:56] and the letter is what killed the the
[1:47:58] Sadducees and the Pharisees and every
[1:48:00] religious person in those ages even
[1:48:02] though they sat in church every single
[1:48:03] day they sat in their synagogues they
[1:48:05] sat in their Tabernacles and said we're
[1:48:06] looking for him aside we're looking for
[1:48:07] him aside that's the danger for the
[1:48:09] believer today I'm looking for a Rapture
[1:48:11] I'm looking for a Rapture and you don't
[1:48:12] have the Holy Ghost that's making it a
[1:48:13] reality in our lives that's what we're
[1:48:15] seeking we're seeking the life that's
[1:48:18] gonna what the same one that took that
[1:48:20] Christ laid down so that he could go in
[1:48:22] was the one that raised them up out and
[1:48:24] that's the same thing we've got to have
[1:48:25] it's the one that allows us to have
[1:48:27] faith as we lay our lives down and
[1:48:29] surrender ourselves to Christ is going
[1:48:30] to pick us up in newness of life and
[1:48:32] it's going to take us all the way off
[1:48:33] into eternity amen
[1:48:35] brother Bradham said this he says I'll
[1:48:37] tell you a genuine Holy Spirit
[1:48:39] experience will punctuate every sentence
[1:48:41] of that Bible with an amen
[1:48:45] but that doesn't mean that if you say
[1:48:47] Amen to every word that you got the Holy
[1:48:48] Ghost
[1:48:52] I recognize truth way before I ever gave
[1:48:54] my life to God I've said it many times
[1:48:57] over the pulpit at the age of 10 I knew
[1:48:59] this message I believed it to be true
[1:49:00] but I didn't give my heart to God until
[1:49:02] I was 17 and until that time I was no
[1:49:05] more going in a Rapture than anybody
[1:49:07] else was because why I didn't have the
[1:49:09] life that was going to take me over
[1:49:11] that's what we're looking for I've got
[1:49:13] to get my soul sealed and so to you amen
[1:49:15] that's what's got to happen
[1:49:17] he says regardless of what anybody else
[1:49:19] says it'll certainly do it because it's
[1:49:21] the spirit of God the writer of the
[1:49:23] Bible
[1:49:24] please say the writer of the message
[1:49:26] okay but you got to have the writer
[1:49:29] not the message only but you gotta have
[1:49:30] the writer of the message
[1:49:32] he says the spirit of the word is the
[1:49:35] holy spirit that's what quickens it the
[1:49:37] letter killeth the spirit giveth it life
[1:49:39] see gives the letter just the printed
[1:49:41] letter life makes it manifest brings it
[1:49:45] to pass exactly what God promised that's
[1:49:48] what I want
[1:49:50] I want the reality of the word
[1:49:54] taste and see that the Lord is good
[1:49:56] I've tasted I want to see
[1:50:01] last quote
[1:50:05] we're putting the day of Jubilee into
[1:50:06] context now we've been speaking of
[1:50:07] redemption for these many services but
[1:50:09] just to kind of put a punctuation on
[1:50:11] this an exclamation point and then we'll
[1:50:13] we'll start up in the next service Lord
[1:50:15] willing
[1:50:16] if we want to know what Jubilee is
[1:50:17] here's what it is this is how the
[1:50:19] prophet of God said it he said but on
[1:50:21] the 50th day was the day of Pentecost
[1:50:23] and the legal owner coming down among
[1:50:26] them Hallelujah and showed it was no
[1:50:28] organization that it was a filling of
[1:50:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:50:32] listen remember what happened I've said
[1:50:34] it many times up there they had a
[1:50:36] denomination starting because Peter said
[1:50:37] we need to replace Judas and they put a
[1:50:39] man into Paul's position
[1:50:41] it was a denomination they started up
[1:50:43] there
[1:50:43] but then the Holy Spirit came later and
[1:50:45] it corrected it didn't it and Peter
[1:50:47] accepted that correction directly and
[1:50:49] literally
[1:50:50] amen but they started a denomination
[1:50:53] under the best of intentions
[1:50:56] but that didn't stop God did it God came
[1:50:59] and he moved
[1:51:00] he says it was a filling of the Holy
[1:51:02] Ghost that was God's earnest money to
[1:51:04] his church that it would not be
[1:51:05] controlled by organizations and so forth
[1:51:07] so it would be the earnest of the
[1:51:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost with the power
[1:51:11] and love of God
[1:51:14] so many times we want the power
[1:51:16] what about the love
[1:51:18] because that love is so different than
[1:51:20] the power
[1:51:22] remember
[1:51:23] because Christ said what
[1:51:26] says anyone that wants to be great let
[1:51:28] him be a servant
[1:51:30] let him humble himself give your life
[1:51:32] for your friends
[1:51:33] that's that's what power looks like is
[1:51:35] the the ability to let yourself I talk
[1:51:37] to a brother today he said he says it's
[1:51:40] he says I pray every day that my life
[1:51:42] will be a stepping stone for somebody
[1:51:44] else he said and then you know what I
[1:51:45] found out
[1:51:46] it's not fun being a stepping stone
[1:51:49] because guess what people do on Stepping
[1:51:50] Stones
[1:51:51] they step
[1:51:53] we don't like being stepped on
[1:51:54] but we've got to value that person's
[1:51:56] soul we've got to value that person's
[1:51:58] spiritual growth we've got to Value
[1:51:59] their life their Eternal reward more
[1:52:03] than we do our ego or our position or
[1:52:05] our thoughts about ourselves amen if
[1:52:08] Christ can do it then we ought to be
[1:52:09] able to do it if we have his power
[1:52:11] because his power is always manifested
[1:52:13] by love
[1:52:14] concern for the other person amen
[1:52:16] according to the word of God
[1:52:17] he says amen oh doesn't that just do
[1:52:20] something to you the legal possessor
[1:52:22] where was it at it's in the hands of God
[1:52:24] he's talking about the title deed of
[1:52:26] redemption remember from Revelation 5.
[1:52:28] see he couldn't hold it over 50 days
[1:52:30] catch that God was bound by his own word
[1:52:33] he couldn't hold that title deed to
[1:52:35] Redemption longer than 50 days
[1:52:37] he says you read that over in Leviticus
[1:52:39] and the law is there it had to go back
[1:52:41] into the hands of the original owner
[1:52:43] after 50 years
[1:52:45] who's the original owner
[1:52:47] where was it before it went back to God
[1:52:49] in the hands of Adam
[1:52:51] that's who had it
[1:52:53] right Adam had eternal life
[1:52:56] Adam had Dominion Adam had control and
[1:52:58] he had full relationship with God the
[1:53:00] title deed to the to the Earth was in
[1:53:03] Adam's hand and it went back to the
[1:53:05] original owner which was God when Adam
[1:53:07] and Eve fell
[1:53:08] he says it has to go back to the hands
[1:53:10] of the original owner after 50 years he
[1:53:12] says well then after these 50-day years
[1:53:14] one day meaning like a year and from the
[1:53:17] day that the crucifixion when they took
[1:53:18] this kinsman redeemer and slaughtered
[1:53:20] him on the day the Passover it was in
[1:53:22] dispute then what
[1:53:24] where it was supposed to go who was
[1:53:26] gonna get it
[1:53:27] he says the church believed up to that
[1:53:29] time
[1:53:32] that he was the Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:53:34] he was a redeemer then what did it do it
[1:53:37] slaughtered him the enemy did and said
[1:53:39] they picked up his body and hid it away
[1:53:40] somewhere and that was all in the
[1:53:43] open to him what taken place
[1:53:48] thought we were convinced and then he
[1:53:51] hasn't come back it's the third day and
[1:53:53] he hasn't risen up
[1:53:55] he says but what at the end of the 50th
[1:53:58] day then you see it couldn't be in
[1:54:00] dispute any longer instead of them to go
[1:54:03] on with the old Orthodox stiff cold
[1:54:05] church God sent the Holy Ghost back and
[1:54:07] run all the squatters out and then taken
[1:54:10] it over the power of the Holy Ghost came
[1:54:13] down and the church received the earnest
[1:54:16] of its salvation
[1:54:17] what's the earnest it's a down payment
[1:54:20] what is it it's the day of Jubilee but
[1:54:23] it's not the hour of Jubilee
[1:54:25] it's the start of an entire work
[1:54:29] and it's a process of redemption
[1:54:31] to take us not just back to position and
[1:54:34] not just back to Power
[1:54:35] and not just all these things but it's
[1:54:37] to take us back into the very presence
[1:54:39] of God without any barriers without
[1:54:41] anything holding us back isn't that our
[1:54:44] prayer Lord that nothing will be between
[1:54:46] you and I
[1:54:47] and guess what Satan's always there to
[1:54:49] get there listen you can be sinless in
[1:54:52] that you're not doing anything wrong in
[1:54:53] your life you're you're Sanctified in
[1:54:55] everything and you'll still fight a
[1:54:56] battle because Satan is always there to
[1:54:58] throw thoughts at you he's there to
[1:54:59] throw attitudes at you he's there to
[1:55:01] throw issues with people he's there to
[1:55:03] to bring up the faults and failures of
[1:55:05] everyone
[1:55:07] doesn't matter what you're doing because
[1:55:09] you've still got a battle that's up here
[1:55:10] amen this is the greatest battle ever
[1:55:12] fought and that's where Satan really
[1:55:13] wants to be so it doesn't matter if
[1:55:15] you're perfect
[1:55:16] you're still going to have a battle
[1:55:19] but we're coming to a place now where
[1:55:20] there is no battle
[1:55:22] the battle's over
[1:55:23] we have the Overcomers reward amen and
[1:55:26] we're sitting with him in his throne and
[1:55:27] there's nobody in that throne but us in
[1:55:28] him
[1:55:29] why because he and the bride are won I
[1:55:32] mean it's perfect Unity is what he's
[1:55:34] restoring us back to him and let's stand
[1:55:36] together if we would
[1:55:39] hey man isn't God good
[1:55:42] doesn't he know how to just do things
[1:55:44] perfectly
[1:55:45] it amazes me sometimes how we feel
[1:55:48] things are dragged out
[1:55:50] just not going the way we wanted
[1:55:53] it just seems like it's going on forever
[1:55:55] fighting fighting nothing's resolved
[1:55:58] we don't seem to be growing perhaps
[1:56:00] getting the victory whatever and then
[1:56:02] God just in a moment
[1:56:04] just in a moment remember the the
[1:56:06] greatest things that happened in
[1:56:07] scripture happened in a moment
[1:56:09] the work was going on all along
[1:56:12] and then God just makes it happen in a
[1:56:13] moment and you you start to realize he
[1:56:15] was there all the time amen right he's
[1:56:18] not he's not sleeping
[1:56:20] amen he's not worried either
[1:56:23] God's just doing what he's doing and all
[1:56:24] he's asking us to do is just stay with
[1:56:27] the word keep pushing
[1:56:29] keep walking stay in the light feed on
[1:56:32] the right things that's all he's looking
[1:56:33] for us to do and then he'll do the work
[1:56:34] we won't frustrate Grace
[1:56:37] we're not going to hold him back as long
[1:56:39] as we try not to do it ourselves but
[1:56:41] just let him do the perfect work of
[1:56:43] redemption listen when you're being
[1:56:44] redeemed you can't contribute anything
[1:56:46] to the process you know what you can't
[1:56:48] do when you're when you're restoring
[1:56:50] something let it move
[1:56:52] you got to hold it down you got to hold
[1:56:54] it steady because the work requires such
[1:56:56] finesse when they're doing a restoration
[1:56:58] on a whether it's something as small as
[1:56:59] a watch or a clock are you all the way
[1:57:01] up to Restoration of a a Ferrari
[1:57:04] from the 1960s it's about holding it
[1:57:06] steady and not moving so that they can
[1:57:09] do the Precision work that they need to
[1:57:11] that's all God's asking us to do hold
[1:57:13] still and see the salvation of God amen
[1:57:15] amen let's push power our heads
[1:57:18] Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful
[1:57:20] for your goodness Lord Lord we're
[1:57:22] thankful that you've got a provided way
