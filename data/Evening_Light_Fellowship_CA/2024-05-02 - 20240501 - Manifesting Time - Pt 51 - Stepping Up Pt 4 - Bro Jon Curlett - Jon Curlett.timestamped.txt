[40:46] special touch on them each one in Jesus
[40:48] Christ's name we ask it amen amen God
[40:52] bless you turn if you would to
[40:54] Revelations chapter 1 and the sharp ey
[40:57] of you may have noticed I have a new
[40:58] Bible up here but it's my devotions
[41:02] Bible and it's got the Amplified on one
[41:03] side and it's got the King James on the
[41:05] other side and I really like doing that
[41:07] in the morning but it's it's absolutely
[41:08] massive and it takes you forever to find
[41:10] something because every page is only
[41:12] half of the Bible but I my my original
[41:15] Bible from 2001 my wife gave it to me
[41:18] the first year we were married as a
[41:19] present is falling apart and so I sent
[41:22] it out to get rebound so hopefully I'll
[41:24] have that back within two or three or
[41:26] four weeks Lord willing but for now I've
[41:28] got to use this this big clunky thing up
[41:31] here amen so it's kind of strange so I'm
[41:34] glad I've got it in my notes because I
[41:35] think we'd add another 20 minutes to
[41:37] service just trying to find everything
[41:38] in this Bible amen but it's good to be
[41:40] here this evening good to see each one
[41:43] amen I had to take my studded snow tires
[41:46] off by law today so I'm trusting that
[41:49] the the winter weather and the snow and
[41:52] the cold and the freezing and all that
[41:53] is going away as well by law hopefully
[41:56] amen but I'm trusting the Lord to just
[41:59] feed us his bread tonight Revelation 1
[42:02] verse4 says this it says John to the
[42:04] seven churches which are in Asia Grace
[42:07] be unto you and peace from him which is
[42:10] and which was and which is to come
[42:13] you'll notice that peace is because he's
[42:16] there amen he's not just there yesterday
[42:19] and he's not just here today but he says
[42:20] I'm going to be here I was there and I'm
[42:22] going to be here and I'm going to keep
[42:23] being here and your my peace will come
[42:25] with me in all those times he says in
[42:27] from the seven spirits which are before
[42:29] his throne and from Jesus Christ who is
[42:31] the faithful witness and the first
[42:34] begotten of the dead and the prince of
[42:36] the kings of the earth unto him that
[42:38] loved us and washed us from our sins in
[42:41] his own blood and had made us Kings and
[42:44] Priests unto God and his father to him
[42:47] be glory and Dominion forever and ever
[42:50] amen God bless you you can have your
[42:52] seats this evening and we're continuing
[42:54] our our series on manifesting time and
[42:56] yes I'm to take a fourth service on
[42:58] stepping up and really this is this
[43:01] stepping up portion is probably the end
[43:03] of the the adoption series as we've been
[43:05] speaking on and we've been talking about
[43:07] us us as children in the kingdom of God
[43:09] not just coming to a realization that we
[43:11] are children of God but that we have a
[43:13] position and we have a role and we're
[43:15] not just here to sit on our couches or
[43:16] on our comfy padded pews but we're here
[43:19] to be about the father's business amen
[43:21] that we're supposed to be mature
[43:23] Believers and the purpose of adoption is
[43:25] to place us into our kingdom of of
[43:27] Heaven purpose our kingdom of God
[43:29] purpose according to his will I want to
[43:31] start with this quote brother brand
[43:32] would say after that some was adopted
[43:34] his name on the checkbook was just as
[43:36] good as his daddy's now can you imagine
[43:40] can you imagine maybe speaking to my son
[43:42] or the young son's here can you imagine
[43:45] that your daddy says you get access to
[43:48] my bank
[43:49] account because maybe our young men have
[43:51] saved up and maybe the best of us maybe
[43:54] the best of them might have maybe $1,000
[43:57] but they know that Daddy buys things and
[43:59] he doesn't have to think about it and
[44:01] and he has massive wealth compared to
[44:02] his son and so can you imagine that
[44:05] opportunity to just write a check and
[44:09] and your dad says whatever you write a
[44:11] check for I'll make sure the money's in
[44:13] the
[44:14] bank that's what he says he says that's
[44:17] where God's trying to get his church
[44:20] that they realize that not only do they
[44:21] have a father and not only does he have
[44:23] a bank account amen but he's got an
[44:26] unlimited store in that bank account to
[44:28] meet the needs and the desires even of
[44:30] his very children he says just say to
[44:33] this mountain be moved and it will move
[44:35] he says Authority sons of God the whole
[44:38] creation's groaning waiting for the
[44:40] manifestations of the sons of God
[44:42] waiting to a spot to where that sickness
[44:44] will be arise and it will be that way
[44:47] the blind will receive their sight Now
[44:49] Catch what he says here he says deaf and
[44:51] dumb he says we pray for them now but
[44:55] then he says you'll command it
[44:58] amen Church there there is a higher
[45:00] level than where we're living at today I
[45:02] believe amen he says we pray for it we
[45:05] ask for it he says but in that day when
[45:07] you truly recognize who you are when you
[45:09] recognize your adopted position you will
[45:12] not ask you will speak and it will
[45:14] happen amen I'm looking forward to that
[45:16] amen and I don't believe we're far off
[45:18] from it I don't even believe we have to
[45:20] wait past today for that I believe we're
[45:22] in the time of the manifestation of the
[45:23] sons of God but watch what he says here
[45:27] he says didn't say these signs shall
[45:29] follow them that believe they shall pray
[45:31] for the sick he says they shall cast out
[45:34] devils not I will they will if you say
[45:38] to this mountain not if I say he says
[45:40] but if you say to this mountain be moved
[45:43] and don't doubt in your heart he says
[45:45] what we need is adoption Sons and
[45:48] Daughters need adoption we know that
[45:50] Mark 16 Jesus said go you into all the
[45:52] world and preach the gospel in my name
[45:54] you know you cast out Devils if you
[45:56] drink any deadly thing it'll not harm
[45:57] you if you lay hands on the sick they'll
[45:59] recover what was he wanting us to do he
[46:01] was wanting us to go into action he was
[46:04] wanting to put us into his purpose but
[46:06] remember before they went into action
[46:08] they had to go and wait amen they had to
[46:10] obey the word and they had to go and
[46:12] wait because he had to fill them with
[46:13] the love and the life of the Holy Spirit
[46:15] he had to put real character inside of
[46:17] them so that when power came when
[46:19] Authority came they'd use it for the
[46:21] right reason but the purpose was to put
[46:23] them into action the purpose of the Holy
[46:25] Spirit was to put the true church into
[46:28] action in the kingdom of God Amen and
[46:30] that's what God's trying to get us to do
[46:32] and we see here that brother braham's
[46:33] talking about two things he says I'm
[46:35] looking he says God's looking for people
[46:37] that will write the
[46:38] check and people that will write the
[46:40] check for the right reason anden he
[46:42] wants us to write the check he wants us
[46:43] to have faith amen if we write the check
[46:46] it's because we have faith that there's
[46:47] money in the account nobody writes a
[46:49] check if they believe the check's going
[46:51] to bounce because of insufficient funds
[46:53] so the first test of the adopted son of
[46:55] God is will you write the check
[46:57] but the second test is what are you
[46:59] going to write it for amen because if
[47:01] you'll write it is the test of faith but
[47:03] what you write it for is the test of
[47:05] your character amen and so God's looking
[47:07] for a balance of those two things will
[47:09] we use it to develop our own reputation
[47:11] our own Ministry to draw people to us to
[47:13] to bring in a paycheck whatever that
[47:15] might be or will we use it according to
[47:17] the word for the edification and the
[47:18] benefit of others in the body of Christ
[47:20] and those that are around us because
[47:22] Satan's Satan's attempt is going to be
[47:24] to keep us short in faith and character
[47:27] right he's trying to keep us to the
[47:29] point where we get so busy in life that
[47:31] we can't feed ourselves on the word of
[47:32] God that we can't dwell on the things of
[47:34] God to build up our faith and see our
[47:36] position and then he'll test our
[47:38] character what by constantly putting
[47:39] decisions in front of us and putting
[47:41] tests and putting traps and putting
[47:43] things that will pull us away into
[47:45] selfishness or or self-preservation of
[47:47] these different things and barring all
[47:48] that he'll get us to just try and think
[47:50] less of ourselves and think better of
[47:51] others that it's for others and it's not
[47:53] for ourselves and Satan's good at what
[47:55] he does I I know that because the
[47:57] prophet of God said we're living below
[47:59] our privileges I just read a quote that
[48:01] says it's not now about praying but it's
[48:03] about speaking that tells me I'm living
[48:05] below my privileges that tells me we're
[48:07] living below our privileges that there's
[48:08] a higher plane to come into that we've
[48:10] got a place to step unto up to and we've
[48:13] seen even in this age we had a Prophet
[48:15] come and he was a sheath offering he was
[48:17] a first fruit offering he was a wave
[48:18] offering before the people to show us
[48:21] what what things are possible to them
[48:23] that believe I read in devotions the
[48:25] other morning I think it was in Luke
[48:26] where Jesus said to them they were
[48:28] saying you know he was talking to the
[48:29] rich young man and and the Rich Young
[48:32] Ruler walked away sad because he
[48:34] wouldn't give up his wealth to serve
[48:36] Christ and Jesus said you know it's
[48:38] easier for the a camel to go through the
[48:40] eye of a needle to go through the little
[48:41] spot the little hole in a needle than it
[48:43] is for a rich man to enter the kingdom
[48:45] and it says the disciples marveled and
[48:47] said well then how are any of us going
[48:48] to get in because back then wealth was a
[48:50] sign of a True Believer they had broken
[48:53] it down so far they had carnal lied the
[48:56] the their spirituality to the point
[48:57] where the wealthiest meant that they
[48:59] were the Most Blessed of God and they
[49:00] said if the Most Blessed of God can't
[49:02] come in then how are we going to get in
[49:04] and he says with men all things are
[49:06] impossible but With God all things are
[49:08] possible and so we have to believe that
[49:10] all things are possible the brother
[49:12] Brandon would saying he said the angel
[49:13] loves that song only believe amen he's
[49:16] trying to get us to have faith and if we
[49:18] have faith then we'll start writing
[49:19] checks against the the balance of the of
[49:22] the bank account of heaven but there's
[49:24] only one way to get that there's only
[49:26] one way to get get Faith and the word
[49:28] says that it's what by hearing the word
[49:31] there is nothing to replace the hearing
[49:32] of word and whether you read it whether
[49:34] you hear it whether it's sung whether
[49:36] it's in your car whether whatever it
[49:38] might be you've got to hear the word and
[49:39] it's got to be a daily bread it's got to
[49:42] be a daily bread because if we don't
[49:43] have that Daily Bread what happens is we
[49:45] start to feed on things other than that
[49:47] and Satan starts to win more battles
[49:49] than he loses in our lives amen amen
[49:51] we've been there we've done that we've
[49:53] been in dry places where we've stepped
[49:54] back from our relationship with God and
[49:56] of a sudden we start losing to things we
[49:58] thought we conquered why because we're
[50:00] not feeding on that Daily Bread amen
[50:02] that Mana that's supposed to come down
[50:04] day by
[50:05] day but I want to go to our opening
[50:07] scripture here this morning this evening
[50:10] and I want to focus on that verse six
[50:13] and it says here that he ha that's past
[50:16] tense it's already done he says made us
[50:19] present
[50:20] tense Kings and Priests unto God and his
[50:23] father to him be glory and Dominion
[50:25] forever and ever amen and this is a
[50:28] powerful scripture if we can understand
[50:30] what he's talking about here as Kings
[50:31] and Priests amen and if I can put my
[50:33] name there and you can put your name
[50:35] there and say I am the one he's talking
[50:36] about to here amen The Book of
[50:39] Revelation is the bride's book amen that
[50:41] is only for the bride in this age they
[50:43] will not understand it until it's too
[50:45] late but our eyes of understanding have
[50:47] been opened what by that seventh angel
[50:49] coming and God himself coming down and
[50:51] opening the seals of this book but
[50:53] brother BR would say this in the church
[50:54] age book just that simple part says that
[50:57] he ha made us he says he ha made us he
[51:00] says though are there are certain truths
[51:02] we need to
[51:03] emphasize I love how the prophet could
[51:06] go in and take the simplest little thing
[51:08] and say we need to emphasize this and he
[51:10] says this is one of them he he ha made
[51:15] us I don't make myself anything you
[51:17] don't make yourself anything our
[51:19] acceptance our position in Christ is not
[51:22] because of us it's because he made us he
[51:24] said salvation's his doing salvation is
[51:27] of the lord it's all of Grace he
[51:29] redeemed us for a purpose and he bought
[51:32] us for a purpose and what would he go on
[51:36] to say he would say it's be it's to make
[51:38] us Kings and Priests but before we talk
[51:41] about that I want to jump to the end of
[51:42] that verse and it says that it is all to
[51:45] the glory of who
[51:49] him we are Kings and we are priests for
[51:52] his glory and His glory alone whatever
[51:54] we do in that role is for his glory for
[51:57] his praise to to elevate him Amen to
[52:00] project him to manifest him in front of
[52:03] the people that are around us amen the
[52:05] scripture says whatever we do do all in
[52:07] the name of Jesus Amen as a king in his
[52:10] kingdom as a priest in his kingdom we
[52:12] everything we have to do has to be done
[52:13] in his name amen what by the word with
[52:16] the unction of the Holy Spirit as the
[52:18] seal of approval on our actions I love
[52:21] that story we finished with last service
[52:22] you know talking about that little
[52:24] humble brother me brother meaf I think
[52:26] it was and brother B says he went to
[52:28] Brother chce and brother chce is in the
[52:30] hospital and he's all beat up they don't
[52:31] know how he's alive and the brother
[52:33] comes in and he says I'm not worthy to
[52:35] pray for you but God told me to come
[52:38] pray for you and so I'm doing it Church
[52:40] his unworthiness did not stop him from
[52:43] performing amen if God calls us then
[52:45] let's do it amen let's not look at
[52:47] ourselves let's look at what he says to
[52:49] do and let's let that lead us in in our
[52:51] lives amen but his heart was to go pray
[52:54] for that brother and he did and brother
[52:56] says God healed brother chce immediately
[53:00] at the prayer of a lay member at the
[53:02] prayer of a little nobody who had no
[53:04] idea that he was so special in the
[53:06] Kingdom you know what that never made
[53:08] the
[53:09] newspapers no doubt that testimony
[53:11] didn't fly all over the place he
[53:13] probably didn't go tell anybody but the
[53:15] prophet of God would come behind and say
[53:17] Here's the authority that's granted to
[53:18] the children of God when they'll get
[53:20] under the under the inspiration of the
[53:22] Holy Spirit and follow its leading
[53:25] something so simple go pray for that man
[53:28] laid hands on him and he was he he was
[53:30] healed he recovered himself immediately
[53:32] but John says in this scripture he says
[53:34] we are made Kings and Priests and I want
[53:38] to start with priests and we're going to
[53:40] spend the whole service on on this
[53:42] priesthood this this afternoon this
[53:43] evening because I believe that's the
[53:45] most important one because if you have
[53:47] the nature of a priest then you'll step
[53:49] into the role of a king it it'll keep
[53:52] you in the right frame of mind and Peter
[53:54] says this in 1 Peter 2 he says ye are a
[53:57] chosen generation a royal priesthood an
[54:01] holy nation A peculiar people that you
[54:04] should show forth the Praises of him who
[54:06] had called you out of Darkness Into His
[54:08] Marvelous Light and we see here that
[54:10] Peter is saying the same thing as John
[54:12] and he says it's all to show forth the
[54:14] Praises of God it's to give glory to God
[54:17] this holy this chosen generation this
[54:19] royal priesthood this holy nation this
[54:21] peculiar people it's all for the glory
[54:24] of God Amen we are not bound by
[54:26] tradition we're not bound by law but
[54:28] we're Bound by love amen and it ought to
[54:30] be the most natural thing in our lives
[54:32] to do what the word tells us to do now
[54:35] our flesh is going to fight it every day
[54:37] because our flesh likes its own things
[54:39] it likes its own ways it is it is bound
[54:41] in sin it is it is lost it cannot be
[54:44] redeemed in its current form and we know
[54:47] that the flesh will fight but the desire
[54:49] of our hearts ought to be to do what the
[54:51] word says to worship and praise God in
[54:53] our lives but we want to consider
[54:55] tonight why The Book of Revelation calls
[54:58] us priests what is it about us that
[55:00] allows us to be priests what is it that
[55:02] we do as priests and What Makes Us
[55:04] acceptable to be priest before God but
[55:07] Peter says it all in this scripture he's
[55:09] he's telling us why we are a royal
[55:11] priesthood here he says we are a chosen
[55:13] generation that word chosen means
[55:16] elected and picked
[55:18] out it's done specifically it's not
[55:21] happen stance it's not 1 2 3 4 Priest 1
[55:24] 2 3 4 priests going down the line but it
[55:26] is is a special people that are chosen
[55:28] of God and we see in the scripture that
[55:31] only one group of people could ever be
[55:34] priests there was only one tribe there
[55:36] was only one set of people that could be
[55:38] priests and we see this in Numbers
[55:40] chapter 8 because I want us to show us
[55:42] this by the Old Testament first and then
[55:44] we'll come into the new because the Old
[55:45] Testament is types and shadows of the
[55:47] New Covenant that's coming between
[55:49] Christ and the bride and in numbers 8 it
[55:52] says Mo God's talking to Moses and he
[55:54] says and thou shalt bring the Levites
[55:55] before the Lord and the children of
[55:57] Israel shall put their hands upon the
[55:59] Levites and Aaron shall offer the
[56:01] Levites before the Lord for an offering
[56:03] of the children of Israel they
[56:06] themselves were an
[56:08] offering he says that what they may
[56:11] execute the service of the Lord what is
[56:14] it what is their purpose it's to execute
[56:17] it's to perform to labor and serve the
[56:20] Lord as he has laid out in his
[56:23] word and what is it to do it is to
[56:26] properly worship and praise God he says
[56:30] and the Levites shall lay their hands
[56:31] upon the heads of the Bullocks and thou
[56:33] shalt offer the one for a sin offering
[56:35] and the other for a burnt offering unto
[56:37] the Lord to make an atonement for the
[56:40] Levites even the priesthood needs an
[56:43] atonement and you'll see here that the
[56:45] Levites are the first ones to receive an
[56:47] atonement and you'll see that's true in
[56:49] this age because only the bride is truly
[56:51] under the atonement why because she's
[56:53] not just under the blood but she has the
[56:55] life of the blood in her her amen she's
[56:57] anointed by the life of the very
[56:59] sacrifice the perfect sacrifice of
[57:01] Christ of Christ we are high priests we
[57:03] are a royal priesthood to him because
[57:05] his spirit is in US amen we've got the
[57:08] very nature of him we've got the life of
[57:09] the perfect sacrifice in us it's only
[57:12] the bride that skips the tribulation
[57:13] because she's in behind the veil nothing
[57:16] can touch you in there there's no
[57:18] judgment there's blood it's a mercy seat
[57:20] and so what is it under there there's
[57:22] nothing can harm us there's nothing can
[57:24] hold us back from him he says and thou
[57:26] shalt set the Levites before Aaron and
[57:28] before his sons and offer them for an
[57:31] offering unto the Lord thus shalt thou
[57:33] separate the Levites from among the
[57:35] children of Israel and the Levites shall
[57:38] be mine so this priesthood is God's they
[57:43] belong to him they're chosen they're
[57:45] separated from everyone
[57:46] else he says and after that after
[57:50] they've gone through the tement after
[57:51] they've gone through the cleansing after
[57:53] they've been put into service after
[57:55] they've got the whole Holy Ghost you
[57:57] can't be a priest without the anointing
[57:59] you can't be a priest without the
[58:00] separation you can't be a priest without
[58:02] the cleansing you can't be a priest
[58:04] without that anointing oil poured over
[58:05] you and we'll talk about that a little
[58:07] bit later but that anointing of the holy
[58:09] spirit is confirmation that you're under
[58:11] the atonement in this age the the Holy
[58:13] Spirit confirms that you've been
[58:15] accepted that you're under the blood
[58:17] amen that's what makes us sinless is the
[58:19] holy spirit on us he says after this
[58:22] shall the Levites go in to do the
[58:24] service of the Tabernacle of the Cong
[58:26] congregation and thou shalt cleanse them
[58:28] and offer them for an offering for they
[58:31] are holy given unto me from among the
[58:35] children of Israel these are the only
[58:37] ones that served him day and
[58:40] night everyone else had a purpose and a
[58:43] place but these were the only ones that
[58:44] had access to God through the Tabernacle
[58:46] all the time he said instead of such as
[58:49] open every womb even instead of the
[58:51] firstborn of all the children of Israel
[58:53] have I taken them unto me for all the
[58:55] firstborn of the children of Israel are
[58:57] mine both man and beast on the day that
[58:59] I smote every firstborn in the land of
[59:01] Egypt I Sanctified them for myself and I
[59:04] have taken the Levites for all the
[59:05] firstborn of the children of Israel see
[59:08] under Israel's law God had the the right
[59:12] to the firstborn he had the right to the
[59:14] first of everything and he did and he
[59:17] remember you had to redeem certain
[59:18] animals you had to pay a sacrifice to
[59:20] keep a certain animal and these
[59:22] different things but God says I don't
[59:24] take I'm not taking your firstborn from
[59:26] you to serve me he says instead I'm
[59:27] going to take a chosen people I'm not
[59:30] going to randomly do this one and
[59:31] randomly do that one but rather I'm
[59:33] going to choose I'm going to elect a
[59:35] tribe of people to serve me so that you
[59:37] don't have to give me any of your
[59:40] sons that was the tithe to God and God
[59:43] chose His tithe there but if we look
[59:45] today we see the same thing we are the
[59:48] elect We Are The Chosen we are the
[59:50] predestinated we are the ordained bride
[59:53] of Christ we are the Church of the
[59:54] Living God and that is by by his
[59:56] election it's by his choice amen I
[59:58] didn't choose to be the son of Lanny
[1:00:00] klette my dad chose me he produced me
[1:00:04] and he fathered me and it's the same
[1:00:07] thing for God I didn't choose him but he
[1:00:09] chose me and he reveals himself as my
[1:00:11] father Lanny klet revealed himself as my
[1:00:14] father and he presented himself to me as
[1:00:18] my father and no other man can do that
[1:00:21] now I might try and place a man in there
[1:00:23] you know my dad went away when I was 10
[1:00:25] and brother Mark and brother Bob kind of
[1:00:27] became my pseudo fathers but they could
[1:00:29] never be my real father no matter how
[1:00:32] much I try and put them there they can't
[1:00:34] be my real daddy why cuz he produced me
[1:00:37] I come from him and it's the same thing
[1:00:38] with us we can put all sorts of things
[1:00:40] over influence in our life put them in
[1:00:43] in in in places of authority in our life
[1:00:46] and these different things but until we
[1:00:48] really meet our father we're not back to
[1:00:49] where we ought to be amen we recognize
[1:00:52] our origin and when we do that we step
[1:00:54] into the family of God no matter what we
[1:00:56] try and do until we come to him we'll
[1:00:58] never be truly satisfied but Jesus would
[1:01:01] say this in the in the Book of John he
[1:01:03] says you have not chosen me but I have
[1:01:05] chosen you and ordained you that you
[1:01:08] should go and bring forth fruit and that
[1:01:10] your fruit should remain that's one
[1:01:13] thing about a True Believer is the fruit
[1:01:15] stays amen because the fruit is what a
[1:01:18] product of the holy spirit in our lives
[1:01:20] and the fruit of the Holy Spirit it may
[1:01:22] diminish at times but it never goes away
[1:01:26] amen it can't because it's life inside
[1:01:28] of us you can't hold life back but catch
[1:01:31] this it says what is it what's the
[1:01:33] benefits of being a child of God he says
[1:01:35] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[1:01:37] father in my name he may give it to you
[1:01:40] what a wonderful promise we have tonight
[1:01:42] that what we ask him in his name he'll
[1:01:44] give it to us amen and John would say
[1:01:46] later that if we do it according to his
[1:01:48] will we have whatever we ask so first
[1:01:51] thing is we are chosen but the next
[1:01:53] thing that we are is that we are royal
[1:01:56] Peter says and that ties into the king's
[1:01:58] part that we read in Revelation and
[1:01:59] we'll we'll focus on that later but I
[1:02:02] want you to understand that the only way
[1:02:03] to be royal is to be
[1:02:06] royal in other words you can only be
[1:02:08] royal if you're coming from the king
[1:02:11] that's What Makes You Royal is that
[1:02:12] you're the son of a king you're the
[1:02:14] daughter of a king you have the DNA of a
[1:02:16] king you have the King's life you have
[1:02:18] the king's very person inside of you and
[1:02:20] that's what makes us Royal is we have
[1:02:22] the DNA of the great king of kings and
[1:02:24] Lord of lords in our lives amen
[1:02:26] now that might cause us to to maybe puff
[1:02:28] up our
[1:02:29] chests I'm a son of the king and you're
[1:02:33] not but you know what I was reading in
[1:02:36] James and James the apostle was the
[1:02:38] great equalizer to to those of us that
[1:02:41] have a tendency to get puffed up I you
[1:02:43] know I love James he says you know when
[1:02:45] you fall into traps he says that's not
[1:02:47] Satan that's
[1:02:49] you don't blame Satan he says that's you
[1:02:51] he says you get LED away of your own
[1:02:52] lust that's why you're in trouble don't
[1:02:54] blame that on Satan blame that on
[1:02:56] yourself and clean up your own lives
[1:02:57] James was a rubber meets the road
[1:02:59] Apostle and if you ever maybe feel like
[1:03:01] you're getting a bit lifted up read
[1:03:02] James a little bit and he'll bring you
[1:03:04] right back to Earth real quick but I
[1:03:05] love what he says in this because James
[1:03:08] had no time for people that that talked
[1:03:10] a lot but couldn't live a Christian Life
[1:03:12] remember James would say show me your
[1:03:13] faith by your
[1:03:15] Works he was like show me a life lived
[1:03:17] don't just talk to me about it don't
[1:03:19] talk about your Revelation live your
[1:03:21] Revelation and then maybe I'll accept it
[1:03:23] but James would say this in in in 28 he
[1:03:25] says if you fulfill the Royal law we a
[1:03:29] royal priesthood he says if ye fulfill
[1:03:31] the Royal law according to the scripture
[1:03:34] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:03:37] ye do well we'll see that as we come
[1:03:40] into kingship are you in it for you or
[1:03:42] are you in it for them I was reading in
[1:03:43] the uh the fourth Church age book this
[1:03:45] this morning and brother Bram saying he
[1:03:47] says the only people that history
[1:03:49] records as great are those that do
[1:03:50] something for someone else those that
[1:03:53] are served they're not great it's those
[1:03:56] that do that are great amen it's so
[1:03:59] simple here Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:04:01] as
[1:04:01] thyself yet will we do it will we give
[1:04:05] them every Advantage every opportunity
[1:04:07] every bit of Grace every bit of Mercy
[1:04:09] every bit of love every bit of
[1:04:11] consideration as we ourselves give
[1:04:13] ourselves and will'll give those that we
[1:04:14] truly
[1:04:16] love that's the Royal law that's a good
[1:04:19] checkup is are we Royal this evening but
[1:04:23] then he would say We Are Holy and we
[1:04:24] could spend service after service on
[1:04:27] that but I want to put it in context of
[1:04:28] a holy nation that we've been chosen to
[1:04:31] be priest before and Peter would say
[1:04:33] this he says wherefore gir up the loins
[1:04:36] of your mind now that that term gird up
[1:04:38] the loins it used to mean that see they
[1:04:40] used to wear these long robes and maybe
[1:04:42] I'll use my jacket and you sisters know
[1:04:45] all about this our brothers not so much
[1:04:46] but when you have a long robe if you're
[1:04:48] going to go into action you can't leave
[1:04:50] the robe long and so when they gted up
[1:04:53] their loins what they would do is they
[1:04:54] would pull up and they would turn up
[1:04:56] their skirts like this their their robes
[1:04:58] like this and they turn it to the point
[1:05:00] where now it was showing their
[1:05:03] knees but it was out of the way and then
[1:05:05] they tighten the belt up and so now they
[1:05:07] were ready to go into battle they were
[1:05:09] ready to run they were ready for action
[1:05:11] they were ready to do what need to be
[1:05:13] done they were ready for work see when
[1:05:16] it's all down around your feet you're
[1:05:17] going to trip yourselves up but they'd
[1:05:19] have to G up their loins he says get
[1:05:21] ready and so Peter's saying G up the
[1:05:22] loins of your mind in other words get
[1:05:24] your head in the game get the right
[1:05:26] attitude get the right mindset think on
[1:05:28] the right things prepare yourself for
[1:05:31] what's
[1:05:31] coming we know what's coming Church all
[1:05:34] things have been open to us Peter says
[1:05:36] get your mind in the
[1:05:39] game don't be slack in your thinking
[1:05:41] focus on your purpose he says G up the
[1:05:44] loins of your mind what does that look
[1:05:46] like be
[1:05:47] sober it's not a time to mess around
[1:05:49] it's not a time for joking it's not a
[1:05:51] time for playing games it's not a time
[1:05:53] for thinking we've got lots of time we
[1:05:55] don't have lots of time he says and hope
[1:05:57] to the end for the grace that is to be
[1:05:59] brought unto you at the revelation of
[1:06:01] Jesus Christ as obedient children not
[1:06:05] fashioning yourselves according to the
[1:06:06] former lusts and your ignorance but as
[1:06:09] he which hath called you is Holy so be
[1:06:12] ye holy in all manner of conversation
[1:06:15] not all the ways you talk all the ways
[1:06:17] you live amen I believe we can all come
[1:06:19] up a little higher when it comes to the
[1:06:21] way that we live that there's a greater
[1:06:22] sanctification we could apply in our
[1:06:24] lives amen but he says why because it is
[1:06:27] written be ye holy for I am Holy now
[1:06:31] what a standard that is and we are not
[1:06:33] holy because of a perfect life or
[1:06:35] sinless Perfection you know why we're
[1:06:37] holy church we're holy because we have
[1:06:39] the holy spirit inside of us that's what
[1:06:41] makes us holy is that we are perfect
[1:06:43] through the blood and the Holy Spirit is
[1:06:45] what makes us holy otherwise it'd just
[1:06:47] be a spirit but it's the Holy Spirit
[1:06:50] indwelling us that makes us holy amen
[1:06:52] and we Are Holy by obedience to the word
[1:06:54] by the leading of the Spirit by the
[1:06:56] quickening of the spirit that's what
[1:06:57] makes us holy amen you want to know if
[1:06:59] somebody's got the Holy Spirit give them
[1:07:01] a word test because they may have been
[1:07:04] living in ignorance but when truth comes
[1:07:06] across their path and you can show them
[1:07:08] in the word what it says then the holy
[1:07:10] spirit will cause them to come into
[1:07:11] obedience to that every single time yeah
[1:07:15] sometimes we might kick up a little bit
[1:07:16] in our flesh because it's a hard
[1:07:19] decision it's going to cause problems
[1:07:20] it's going to cause separation those
[1:07:22] things but it it will ultimately the
[1:07:24] holy spirit will lead us to the truth
[1:07:26] amen and it will hold us in that place
[1:07:29] but brother I would say this we're
[1:07:30] talking about obedience to the word by
[1:07:32] the quickening power of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:33] he says that's what God wants us to be
[1:07:36] be
[1:07:37] obedient he says have you received a
[1:07:39] false Spirit do you yet act with the
[1:07:42] things of the world as we spoke of this
[1:07:44] afternoon do you still love them are
[1:07:46] they in your
[1:07:47] heart that's one of the greatest dangers
[1:07:49] our young people will face is that they
[1:07:51] think that because they're tempted they
[1:07:53] don't have the Holy Spirit listen this
[1:07:55] FLH can be tempted if you put it in the
[1:07:57] under certain
[1:07:58] conditions it's like I was talking to a
[1:08:00] brother a while back I said I don't go
[1:08:03] looking for naked women but you put me
[1:08:04] in a room full of them guess what
[1:08:06] eventually this body will respond and
[1:08:08] it'll want something now that's harsh
[1:08:10] but let's put it in the in the light of
[1:08:11] anything you put yourself around
[1:08:13] entertainment you put yourself around
[1:08:14] worldly people you put yourself around
[1:08:16] worldly music you put it there long
[1:08:18] enough and this flesh is going to get
[1:08:19] titilated it's going to start liking it
[1:08:21] and you'll be drawn into it but the
[1:08:23] thing is I don't go seeking those things
[1:08:26] why because it's not in my heart why
[1:08:28] because I've got the holy spirit amen
[1:08:31] that old man died a long long time ago
[1:08:33] but what this flesh will rise up if I
[1:08:35] give it an opportunity and that's why
[1:08:37] Paul said I Die daily I keep my body
[1:08:40] under me why because the Holy Spirit In
[1:08:43] Me says you will listen to
[1:08:46] me you will listen to me I'm in
[1:08:50] control not me the Holy Spirit In Me is
[1:08:52] in control he's the one that's in the
[1:08:54] great control full tower of my life and
[1:08:56] so he brings his body under subjection
[1:08:59] but me what I am is in obedience to the
[1:09:01] word to not tempt this
[1:09:03] flesh not tempt the flesh the soul
[1:09:05] sealed I'm not worried about my soul but
[1:09:07] this body will get me into trouble if I
[1:09:09] give it an opportunity so I keep this
[1:09:11] flesh in obedience to the word and it
[1:09:13] preserves it and it keeps it from
[1:09:14] getting scarred and from getting into
[1:09:16] the things that this world gets
[1:09:18] into he says have you not been a
[1:09:20] separated person he says then maybe you
[1:09:23] haven't been adopted but once adopted
[1:09:25] you are positionally placed in the body
[1:09:27] of Christ and you are heir of all things
[1:09:30] remember what we read earlier if you ask
[1:09:32] anything in my name what you're the heir
[1:09:35] of all
[1:09:37] things then Peter would say so we've
[1:09:40] been chosen we've been holy then he says
[1:09:43] we are peculiar and I love this you know
[1:09:45] what that word peculiar means it means
[1:09:47] we are the purchased possession that has
[1:09:50] been
[1:09:53] preserved if we get into a literation we
[1:09:55] are the preserved purchased possession
[1:09:59] what a wonderful thing to think of
[1:10:00] purchase we are where we are with the
[1:10:02] blessings with the fellowship with the
[1:10:04] understanding the knowledge the
[1:10:05] revelation of Christ why because he
[1:10:08] purchased us I didn't deserve it I
[1:10:11] didn't do anything to bring myself to
[1:10:13] this he paid the price for me so as a
[1:10:16] peculiar a part of that peculiar people
[1:10:18] I'm purchased and in Acts 20 it says
[1:10:20] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:10:23] to all the flock over that which the
[1:10:25] holy ho ghost has made you overseers to
[1:10:27] feed the Church of God which he had
[1:10:29] purchased with his own blood amen this
[1:10:33] is a warning to the ministry a warning
[1:10:34] to the Pastors in particular that you
[1:10:37] don't Lord yourselves over the people I
[1:10:39] like how brother Chris meritz told it to
[1:10:41] me back when I lived in BC he says when
[1:10:43] I'm talking to the people he says I talk
[1:10:45] to them as if I would talk to another
[1:10:47] man's wife while that man is
[1:10:50] there you would not put her down you
[1:10:53] would not insult her you would not
[1:10:54] attack her you would not try and exert
[1:10:57] authority over her would you because why
[1:11:00] she belongs to
[1:11:01] him and all you're trying to do is help
[1:11:04] not control not take authority over it
[1:11:07] amen we're purchased with his own blood
[1:11:10] but then we're also preserved and Jesus
[1:11:12] said this he says and this is the
[1:11:14] Father's will which has sent me that of
[1:11:17] all which he hath given me I should
[1:11:20] lose how
[1:11:22] many nothing
[1:11:25] nothing but should raise it up again at
[1:11:28] the last day what confidence and peace
[1:11:29] we ought to have tonight not just
[1:11:31] because I'm here but because those that
[1:11:33] should be here they're going to be here
[1:11:35] amen we look today and we see people
[1:11:37] that have gone so far away and they've
[1:11:39] lost what they've been taught and
[1:11:41] they've walked away from the light and
[1:11:42] the truth of this end time message but
[1:11:44] fear not if they are a child of God he
[1:11:46] cannot lose them and he'll bring them
[1:11:48] back to his position he'll bring them
[1:11:50] back to his light he'll bring them back
[1:11:52] and he'll seal them with the holy spirit
[1:11:54] amen what confidence we ought to have
[1:11:56] when we see people going where they
[1:11:58] ought not to to say Lord You've showed
[1:12:00] me they're your
[1:12:02] child you showed me they're your child
[1:12:04] so I'm going to have rest that you're
[1:12:06] not going to lose any you'll lose
[1:12:08] nothing that's
[1:12:09] yours and then Peter would finish with
[1:12:12] this marvelous thing he says that you
[1:12:13] should show forth the Praises of him who
[1:12:16] ha called you out of Darkness Into His
[1:12:18] Marvelous Light it's only the priesthood
[1:12:21] that knew how to Worship in a way that
[1:12:24] would bring God God on the scene they
[1:12:28] made a way for the people to come into
[1:12:30] the presence of God God showed them how
[1:12:32] to do it and their very lives were
[1:12:34] dedicated to entering into the presence
[1:12:36] of God and inviting the presence of God
[1:12:39] so that the other people could enjoy it
[1:12:41] their whole life was built around
[1:12:43] bringing the people to God to make them
[1:12:46] acceptable before him so we see this
[1:12:48] this Grand picture these attributes of
[1:12:51] the royal priesthood that that John and
[1:12:53] Peter spoke of and we see then that
[1:12:54] we're not just Christians walking around
[1:12:57] again I was reading in the fourth Church
[1:12:58] age this morning where brother Ram is
[1:13:00] saying listen people say they're
[1:13:02] Christians but they're Christians in the
[1:13:03] flesh they're not Christians in the soul
[1:13:06] in the spirit they're Christians in the
[1:13:08] flesh but it's the Christians in the
[1:13:10] spirit that can be the royal priesthood
[1:13:11] that we're talking about that they have
[1:13:13] access to God that they can go in before
[1:13:15] him that they're accepted into his
[1:13:17] presence and he's saying we've got to
[1:13:19] step up into a spiritual priesthood see
[1:13:22] the Catholic Church turned it into a
[1:13:23] natural priesthood and they said I can
[1:13:25] go and I can forgive your sins and this
[1:13:28] one can do this and and and what do they
[1:13:30] call it the atoning of Saints or the um
[1:13:32] what is it some of the old Catholics
[1:13:33] helped me the communion of the Saints
[1:13:36] and that the Saints could could
[1:13:38] intercede intercession of the Saints in
[1:13:39] these different things what baloney what
[1:13:42] baloney but there is a truth of
[1:13:45] intercession and that's what we're going
[1:13:46] to talk about for the for the rest of
[1:13:48] this evening but I want us to look at
[1:13:50] what this spiritual priesthood looks
[1:13:52] like brother says this he says now when
[1:13:54] a man is confirmed Ed say just like that
[1:13:56] little white button starts in his heart
[1:13:59] he says that part is God and when he's
[1:14:01] born again with the spirit of God God's
[1:14:04] spirit dwells in him now catch this he
[1:14:07] says now if he can let that Spirit grow
[1:14:10] and take out all the roots of bitterness
[1:14:13] and press God's way through him again he
[1:14:16] can come back in the same condition that
[1:14:19] he was when he was in the Garden of
[1:14:21] Eden Jesus said in Mark 11:24 very
[1:14:25] verely verely I say unto you if you say
[1:14:27] to this mountain be moved and don't
[1:14:28] doubt in your heart but believe that
[1:14:30] what you have said will come to pass you
[1:14:33] can have what you said and then he says
[1:14:35] these words that puts him right back
[1:14:38] Supreme again it puts him right back in
[1:14:41] the condition he says if we will let the
[1:14:44] spirit of God go through our life and
[1:14:46] push out the bitterness push out the
[1:14:48] arrogance push out this push out that
[1:14:51] and let it have the preeminence in our
[1:14:53] lives it'll bring us back to our
[1:14:55] spiritual leading condition why because
[1:14:58] our soul will be back to where it needs
[1:15:00] to be not this flesh but this soul is
[1:15:03] back amen it's our spiritual condition
[1:15:05] first and foremost is that Eternal
[1:15:07] portion of us where we are what fully
[1:15:10] consumed we we're overwhelmed we're
[1:15:12] overtaken by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:14] in our lives and now we're back to where
[1:15:16] we were as Adam was in the first what
[1:15:20] using that Holy Spirit to control the
[1:15:22] things that are around him
[1:15:25] we're still in the Fallen body through
[1:15:27] all this the inner man's restored back
[1:15:28] but I want you to consider that if that
[1:15:30] your soul is sealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:15:34] then that brings you back to your
[1:15:35] absolute condition of
[1:15:37] Eden That's Heavy that's powerful stuff
[1:15:41] that if you are sealed by the Holy
[1:15:43] Spirit you're an adopted son or daughter
[1:15:45] of God that brings you back to Supreme
[1:15:48] control
[1:15:50] again but we realize that it's in
[1:15:52] this we don't have Supreme control
[1:15:54] control over
[1:15:56] everything cuz the body's not redeemed
[1:15:58] yet but brother Bram would saying we'll
[1:16:00] get into this when we get into the
[1:16:01] kingship side our Dominion is over
[1:16:03] sin and the effects of sin we're not
[1:16:07] ruling and reigning now but we are
[1:16:09] priests and kings in a certain way in a
[1:16:11] spiritual way right
[1:16:13] now but I want to go into this because
[1:16:15] the priesthood was anointed with an
[1:16:17] anointing oil and it was a special kind
[1:16:19] of oil and we know that oil always
[1:16:21] represents the holy spirit in the
[1:16:22] scriptures and there was lots of oils
[1:16:24] and if if you look in the scripture they
[1:16:25] talk about lots of different oils but
[1:16:27] there was a special oil that was made
[1:16:30] for the priesthood and it wasn't just a
[1:16:32] an oil from a particular plant or
[1:16:34] anything but rather it was a mixture of
[1:16:36] things and if you go into Exodus 30 it
[1:16:39] it shows the the special recipe that God
[1:16:42] had for this anointing oil and it was
[1:16:44] specific to the priesthood and so in
[1:16:47] Exodus chapter 30 we're going to read
[1:16:48] just a moment here but before this
[1:16:50] before verse 30 he gives the recipe and
[1:16:53] then he says take this oil and and
[1:16:55] spread it over everything that's in the
[1:16:57] temple to sanctify it and make it holy
[1:17:00] so the purpose of the oil is to sanctify
[1:17:02] and make holy and fit for service in God
[1:17:06] Amen but now he's done it to the whole
[1:17:09] Tabernacle but now watch what he says
[1:17:11] don't just anoint the Tabernacle but he
[1:17:13] says anoint the people he says Thou
[1:17:15] shalt anoint
[1:17:16] Aaron remember we read Unholy Nation
[1:17:20] what makes them holy the anointing oil
[1:17:22] the Holy Spirit on them he says Thou
[1:17:24] shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and
[1:17:26] consecrate them that they may Minister
[1:17:29] unto me in the priest's office and thou
[1:17:31] shalt speak unto the children of Israel
[1:17:33] saying this shall be un holy anointing
[1:17:36] oil unto me throughout your Generations
[1:17:38] there it is a holy people what is it
[1:17:40] it's the anointing oil of the Holy
[1:17:42] Spirit he says upon men's flesh it shall
[1:17:45] not be poured neither shall you make any
[1:17:47] other like it after the composition of
[1:17:49] it it is Holy and it shall be holy unto
[1:17:52] you now he's not saying it can't go on
[1:17:54] any man he's saying it can't go on
[1:17:56] anyone other than the
[1:17:57] priesthood except God tells them to God
[1:18:01] can tell a priest God can tell a prophet
[1:18:03] to go anoint somebody and when they did
[1:18:05] it it was with this oil but it could not
[1:18:07] be unless God told them to do it no man
[1:18:10] could say I anoint myself I anoint my
[1:18:12] home I sanctify my home no it was by the
[1:18:14] choosing of God that you got this oil
[1:18:16] poured on you he says whosoever compound
[1:18:20] any like it or whosoever putteth any of
[1:18:23] it upon a stranger shall even be cut off
[1:18:25] from his people he says you're not even
[1:18:26] allowed to use the
[1:18:28] recipe you've got the recipe but you're
[1:18:30] not allowed to use it it's not for you
[1:18:32] to make it and it's not for you to use
[1:18:33] it it's for me to choose who gets this
[1:18:35] oil and he says if you do it you'll be
[1:18:37] cut off you'll be separated from Israel
[1:18:39] you're out from under the blood you're
[1:18:40] out from under the Covenant and you're
[1:18:41] going to die a long and lonely
[1:18:43] death if what you try and make this
[1:18:46] happen yourself so we start to see here
[1:18:48] this picture that it's only a chosen
[1:18:50] people that can be a priesthood and they
[1:18:53] aren't just chosen but they're anointed
[1:18:55] they're anointed for purpose they're
[1:18:57] anointed to serve and God says put it on
[1:18:59] the priest and if you look in the
[1:19:00] scripture remember it talks about air it
[1:19:02] says it ran down over his beard and ran
[1:19:04] all the way to the souls of his feet he
[1:19:07] was soaked he was saturated it was
[1:19:09] something that was supposed to overflow
[1:19:11] them so that they were soaked in this
[1:19:13] anointing oil that ought to be our lives
[1:19:15] church that it is saturated with the
[1:19:17] presence of the holy spirit that there
[1:19:19] would be nothing that would push him
[1:19:21] away in our lives that he would have
[1:19:22] access to every portion of us and that
[1:19:24] it would would just drench us you know
[1:19:27] what and then then in Scripture it says
[1:19:28] that that that the unity of Brothers is
[1:19:30] like that oil tell you what if you got
[1:19:33] the Holy Ghost you can get along with
[1:19:34] people people that don't get along with
[1:19:36] people I'm sorry something's wrong with
[1:19:38] their walk because the Holy Spirit Will
[1:19:40] unify the children and the family of God
[1:19:42] it will not draw separation we draw
[1:19:44] separations there is a separation that's
[1:19:47] required but we tend to make it more
[1:19:48] about things we like or enjoy or believe
[1:19:50] rather than what the word really
[1:19:53] says but God saying it's my choice as to
[1:19:55] who gets this we look in Revelation in
[1:19:59] in the rest of the first chapter and I
[1:20:00] won't read it for the sake of time this
[1:20:02] evening but we see Christ and he's
[1:20:03] walking in the midst of the golden
[1:20:05] candlesticks and remember that he's
[1:20:08] walking in there and he's got to light
[1:20:09] it but the oil has to come from him as
[1:20:11] well and brother bram's speaking about
[1:20:13] this and he says then when God was made
[1:20:15] flesh and become the Messiah he says
[1:20:18] then if we can yield ourselves to be the
[1:20:21] anointed like he was we become cat's
[1:20:25] little lights he says that's what the
[1:20:28] church is supposed to be lights little
[1:20:31] anointed ones church we have to know who
[1:20:34] we are we are believers we are Sons and
[1:20:37] Daughters of God We Are Holy Ghost
[1:20:40] sealed
[1:20:43] Messiahs you can't preach this to the
[1:20:46] denominations they'll only go so
[1:20:49] far but look at what he says he says
[1:20:51] that's God's Church his standing light
[1:20:54] is the light of Messiah the Risen Christ
[1:20:56] and his people the anointed ones
[1:20:58] carrying forth his light unto all the
[1:21:00] church ages sometimes it almost goes
[1:21:03] completely out but then it comes back
[1:21:05] again God's anointed one God's Messianic
[1:21:08] church now he's trying to bring it to
[1:21:10] our level because that's that's the real
[1:21:13] struggle for people is to is to put
[1:21:15] everything up above them but never bring
[1:21:17] it down to where they're living He says
[1:21:18] now if Messiah means the anointed one
[1:21:21] and means king then if the church is
[1:21:24] Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it
[1:21:26] becomes a lesser but still a
[1:21:29] messiah because it has his light
[1:21:32] reflecting his power reflecting his
[1:21:34] glory reflecting his Dominion remember
[1:21:37] we are supposed to be to his praise and
[1:21:39] to his glory he says that's what the
[1:21:40] light of the holy spirit in us will do
[1:21:43] he says so it is Messiah oh how it
[1:21:45] reflects him in his kingdom in his
[1:21:48] domain he says the trouble today is
[1:21:50] we've organized the church to death
[1:21:52] we've got organization instead of
[1:21:53] Messiah
[1:21:55] we've got russellite proelite and other
[1:21:57] kinds of light but we need Messiah light
[1:22:00] what the church needs today is the light
[1:22:02] of the Messiah he says oh how I love him
[1:22:04] for his goodness why cuz we have that
[1:22:06] light available he says now that is true
[1:22:09] God called
[1:22:16] Messiahs go tell somebody tomorrow I'm a
[1:22:18] godall
[1:22:21] messiah he says God called us and we
[1:22:24] became Kings and Priests unto God Like
[1:22:27] Jesus was God's high priest we become a
[1:22:31] lesser
[1:22:32] priest he says Jesus God in fullness
[1:22:35] dwelt in him to shine forth the
[1:22:37] expression of God to the world for God
[1:22:39] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[1:22:41] himself and as God was in Christ
[1:22:43] reconciling the world to himself God
[1:22:46] comes into his church and anoints him
[1:22:49] some Messiahs he says Oh my he says do
[1:22:52] you see it the same thing he did is in
[1:22:56] his church and the same and and he says
[1:22:59] the same power he had is in his church
[1:23:02] and his church becomes his dominion and
[1:23:04] he's King over this dominion and we are
[1:23:07] Kings and Priests offering spiritual
[1:23:09] sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips
[1:23:12] giving praise to his name he says amen
[1:23:14] oh my there you are Messiah little
[1:23:17] Messiahs little anointed ones anointed
[1:23:20] off of what he says it's the main one
[1:23:23] anointed off of the Great One Church how
[1:23:26] important is it that we have the Holy
[1:23:28] Spirit it is the most important thing
[1:23:31] that you can ever get or have or seek in
[1:23:33] your life it is not just an option it is
[1:23:36] an absolute requirement for the believer
[1:23:40] we aren't going anywhere and we're not
[1:23:41] doing anything without the Holy Spirit
[1:23:43] In Our Lives seek after the Holy Spirit
[1:23:45] and make sure you've got it make your
[1:23:47] calling make your election make your
[1:23:49] ceiling sure this evening if you haven't
[1:23:50] done it because without it we are
[1:23:53] nothing we are Christians in our flesh
[1:23:55] and our soul is Bound for
[1:23:57] hell God help us to seek and say Lord do
[1:24:00] I really have it and does my life
[1:24:02] reflected do my desires reflect it
[1:24:04] that's what restores us back to that
[1:24:06] that that Supreme Eden condition that
[1:24:08] the prophet was talking about but I want
[1:24:11] to talk for the rest of this evening
[1:24:12] about what that role of spiritual
[1:24:14] priesthood entails and Peter would say
[1:24:16] this he says ye also as Lively Stones as
[1:24:19] living stones are built up a spiritual
[1:24:22] house and holy priest Hood to offer up
[1:24:25] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:24:28] by Jesus Christ so this is not a
[1:24:30] physical thing this is a spiritual
[1:24:33] priesthood it's not a physical
[1:24:34] priesthood we're not like the Catholics
[1:24:36] or the anglicans or these different ones
[1:24:38] no this is a spiritual priesthood and so
[1:24:41] we offer spiritual sacrifices and I want
[1:24:44] to talk about spiritual sacrifices and
[1:24:46] then we'll talk about acceptable
[1:24:48] spiritual sacrifices now brother Braham
[1:24:51] says this he says did you ever know what
[1:24:53] a priest is what his office is in other
[1:24:55] words what's the purpose of a priest he
[1:24:57] says a priest is to make sacrifice what
[1:25:00] for to make
[1:25:03] intercession he says and over in Hebrews
[1:25:05] it said that we the church are the royal
[1:25:07] priesthood a royal priesthood a holy
[1:25:09] nation A peculiar people he says see a
[1:25:12] holy nation peculiar people royal
[1:25:14] priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:25:17] he says every man and woman that comes
[1:25:19] to God enters into the veil what he's
[1:25:23] saying is that every true son and
[1:25:25] daughter of God that's born again gets
[1:25:27] to go into the presence of God why
[1:25:30] because we are priests only priests got
[1:25:33] to go beyond the veil in those days to
[1:25:35] go into the presence of God but he says
[1:25:37] why do we go in there we go in there to
[1:25:39] make sacrifice and why do we make
[1:25:41] sacrifice because we are intercessors we
[1:25:44] are there to plead for those that can we
[1:25:47] are there to stand between between the
[1:25:48] people and judgment that's what an
[1:25:51] intercessor does is they Place
[1:25:53] themselves between what's deserved and
[1:25:55] what they want the people to have
[1:25:57] they're begging for mercy when judgment
[1:25:59] is all that's warranted that's what an
[1:26:01] intercessor does when when when they
[1:26:03] don't deserve it when they don't even
[1:26:05] realize they need it what does an
[1:26:06] intercessor do they play they plead they
[1:26:09] beg they get down on their knees they
[1:26:11] put themselves in the way to try and
[1:26:13] hold something back from running that
[1:26:15] person over and giving them what they
[1:26:16] truly deserve to try and give them
[1:26:18] enough time to be restored to grace and
[1:26:20] mercy that's what the intercessor does
[1:26:23] and he would talk about in Hebrews
[1:26:25] talking about Christ as our intercessor
[1:26:27] he says by so much was Jesus made
[1:26:29] assurity of a better Testament better
[1:26:31] than anything they have before he says
[1:26:33] and they truly were many priests because
[1:26:35] they were not suffered to continue by
[1:26:37] reason of death he says they needed all
[1:26:38] these priests and you needed more and
[1:26:40] more and more because they kept dying
[1:26:42] off he says but this man because he
[1:26:44] continues forever he never dies had an
[1:26:46] unchangeable priesthood he says
[1:26:49] wherefore he is also able also to save
[1:26:53] them to the utter most that come unto
[1:26:55] God by him seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:26:58] intercession for them now I put the
[1:27:00] Amplified version there it says
[1:27:02] therefore he is also able to save
[1:27:04] forever now how does Christ save he
[1:27:07] saves completely perfectly and for
[1:27:10] eternity God doesn't do halfway jobs God
[1:27:13] doesn't halfway save you God doesn't
[1:27:14] make you a Halfway Christian he makes
[1:27:16] you all Christian or none at all and he
[1:27:18] doesn't start to stop halfway through
[1:27:20] he'll see you all the way to the end we
[1:27:23] back off sometimes but he never backs
[1:27:25] off he'll keep pushing us through he
[1:27:27] says it's complete perfect for eternity
[1:27:30] those who come to God through him why
[1:27:32] since he always
[1:27:34] lives always lives his purpose of living
[1:27:38] is to intercede and intervene on their
[1:27:42] behalf he says for such an high priest
[1:27:44] became us we don't really use that
[1:27:47] phrase anymore but in the old days they
[1:27:48] say oh that dress you're wearing is very
[1:27:51] becoming sister Justine what did it mean
[1:27:54] it flatters you it makes you look good
[1:27:56] it's suited for your build it really
[1:27:59] works on you what he's saying here is
[1:28:03] that there is a high priest that works
[1:28:05] specifically and perfectly for the way
[1:28:07] we
[1:28:08] are Christ was the perfect high priest
[1:28:11] that becomes us that that is suitable
[1:28:14] for us he says and who is he he is Holy
[1:28:18] harmless harmless Church we're talking
[1:28:21] royal priesthood are we harmless
[1:28:24] undefiled separate from Sinners and made
[1:28:26] higher than the heavens and we see that
[1:28:28] Christ even on the cross is interceding
[1:28:32] he's dying the most agonizing death he's
[1:28:34] separated from the father he he's
[1:28:37] completely overwhelmed by the sins of
[1:28:39] the entire world and yet as he's on that
[1:28:42] cross in that horrible condition he says
[1:28:44] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:28:47] they're doing why because judgment was
[1:28:49] what they deserved judgment was what God
[1:28:52] intended but he's sitting there and he's
[1:28:53] saying I'll pay the price I'm paying it
[1:28:56] now I'll take whatever it takes if you
[1:28:59] can give them Mercy that's what the
[1:29:01] intercessor does is they don't rise up
[1:29:03] to the occasion but they say I'll take
[1:29:06] what they deserve on me and I'll absorb
[1:29:08] it until they can find Mercy and Grace
[1:29:10] until they can come out of their
[1:29:11] ignorance until they can come out of
[1:29:13] their arrogance until they can come out
[1:29:14] of their religious spirit that's what he
[1:29:17] did so if Christ was made perfectly for
[1:29:20] our needs and we're a royal priesthood
[1:29:23] we the royal priesthood we're a holy
[1:29:26] priesthood a holy nation then does that
[1:29:28] not mean we're perfectly made for those
[1:29:29] that we come in contact with we ought to
[1:29:33] be if we're made after like he is the
[1:29:36] order of mzc We Are Made perfectly for
[1:29:39] those that we come in contact
[1:29:42] with it says there in the scriptures how
[1:29:44] long does he do it how long does he
[1:29:47] intercede he always lives to intercede
[1:29:50] his life's purpose is to intercede
[1:29:53] here's only one mediator between God and
[1:29:55] man and that's Christ Jesus his very
[1:29:57] purpose until he comes back as king and
[1:29:59] kings of Lord of lords is to intercede
[1:30:01] is to mediate between God and the and
[1:30:04] the and the
[1:30:05] children we look at Christ on the cross
[1:30:08] was he interceding to those that loved
[1:30:10] him for those that treated him well no
[1:30:13] he was interceding for those that were
[1:30:15] in ignorance in arrogance in
[1:30:20] Envy destroying the very one that was
[1:30:22] their salvation
[1:30:24] he's not interceding for those that knew
[1:30:26] him he's interceding for those that
[1:30:27] didn't for those that had no clue what
[1:30:30] they were doing their own lives their
[1:30:32] own actions interfere with their access
[1:30:35] to
[1:30:35] God and they could go and they could
[1:30:37] sacrifice year after year but once he
[1:30:39] died those sacrifices had no effect
[1:30:41] anymore they were going to need to
[1:30:42] recognize them and Jesus says father
[1:30:45] don't put it on their tab put it on mine
[1:30:47] I'll pay their bill I'll pay the
[1:30:51] price what are we going to do
[1:30:54] when people persecute us when people
[1:30:56] belittle us when people make fun of us
[1:30:58] when people give us a hard time because
[1:31:00] of what we believe well we stand aside
[1:31:02] and say God they're all
[1:31:05] yours or will we say God they have no
[1:31:09] clue what they're doing they're Bound in
[1:31:11] denomination they're Bound in Bound in
[1:31:13] worldly arrogance Church some of the
[1:31:15] worst ones are professing Christians
[1:31:16] bound up in a religious spirit and they
[1:31:18] have no clue who's the ones that that
[1:31:20] persecuted Christ the most the religious
[1:31:23] leaders
[1:31:24] the religious people and we run up
[1:31:26] against them all the time and they'll
[1:31:28] turn us down and they'll make fun of us
[1:31:30] and this and that and the other thing
[1:31:32] and even persecute us to a degree but
[1:31:34] what is our attitude is it Lord forgive
[1:31:36] them Lord open their eyes or is it lord
[1:31:40] they're all
[1:31:42] yours cuz if we've got the nature of the
[1:31:44] mediator in us the intercessor we ought
[1:31:47] to be able to intercede when it doesn't
[1:31:49] feel so
[1:31:51] good amen
[1:31:54] is the spirit of intercession only
[1:31:56] working on those that love us and
[1:31:58] appreciate
[1:31:59] us they don't need that our own filial
[1:32:03] love will take us past that
[1:32:07] amen but we need a spirit of
[1:32:09] intercession that'll take us beyond what
[1:32:12] we feel brother Brandon would talk about
[1:32:14] Moses Moses is the the perfect
[1:32:16] intercessor when it comes to uh a human
[1:32:18] uh outside of Christ of course and he
[1:32:20] would talk about when when Moses went up
[1:32:22] on the mountain to get the Temple or or
[1:32:24] the the laws of God and and while he's
[1:32:27] up there they they fashion a golden calf
[1:32:29] and they go into idolatry and they go
[1:32:30] into lust and these different things and
[1:32:32] God comes down and he tells Moses I'm
[1:32:34] going to kill them all and Moses says
[1:32:36] whoa no don't do that and he stands in
[1:32:40] the Gap brother brandham says he stands
[1:32:42] in the Gap holding back the Judgment of
[1:32:44] God and he says he puts his own body and
[1:32:47] his own life between
[1:32:50] them do they deserve it no they don't
[1:32:54] deserve it and then they come up again
[1:32:56] not too long after that and Dayan and
[1:32:58] cor rise up in their religious arrogance
[1:33:01] and they say Moses you make too much of
[1:33:03] yourself you made yourself a big shot
[1:33:05] you're taking too much Authority you're
[1:33:06] leading the people in ways you don't
[1:33:08] deserve and God says to Moses he says
[1:33:10] separate from them he says not only from
[1:33:12] them separate them separate yourself
[1:33:14] from the entire children of Israel he
[1:33:16] says I'll destroy them
[1:33:20] all and Moses says no don't do do it
[1:33:24] don't do it and he puts himself between
[1:33:26] God and the people
[1:33:28] again I want you to look at what brother
[1:33:30] Braham says about this he says he's
[1:33:32] talking
[1:33:33] about what daythan and cor did he says
[1:33:36] and this to displeased God so much till
[1:33:39] he told Moses separate yourselves from
[1:33:41] the among them I'll just kill the whole
[1:33:43] bunch and start a new generation with
[1:33:44] you he says and Moses fell in the
[1:33:47] presence of God you've got to be a
[1:33:50] priest to go into the presence of God he
[1:33:52] says and he and said he'd have to come
[1:33:55] over him Moses was basically saying Over
[1:33:57] My Dead Body Lord you'll have to kill me
[1:34:00] before you kill them he says now today
[1:34:03] if God was going to liquidate the people
[1:34:05] and there was a time when God had gotten
[1:34:07] tired of fooling with their sin we
[1:34:09] constantly going wrong who would stand
[1:34:11] like Moses today for the
[1:34:14] people he says where would we find a
[1:34:18] person that would stand or could stand
[1:34:22] that God would accept like he did did
[1:34:24] Moses are we someone that God would
[1:34:27] accept the way that he accepted Moses to
[1:34:28] stand in the Gap he says could you stand
[1:34:32] in the presence of God to intercede and
[1:34:34] then the big bigger question is would
[1:34:38] you scripture says vengeance is mine I
[1:34:41] will repay sayeth the Lord sometimes we
[1:34:44] can get caught up in who we are so much
[1:34:46] that we're calling out judgment and
[1:34:48] judgment doesn't come till later Church
[1:34:49] we're not going to judge the Saints
[1:34:51] until after this is all over this is not
[1:34:53] a time of judgment this is a time of
[1:34:54] mercy and Grace and forbearance amen
[1:34:58] there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat
[1:35:00] there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat he
[1:35:02] says where would we find a person that
[1:35:04] would stand or could stand that God
[1:35:06] would accept like he did Moses and Moses
[1:35:08] own life on Earth meant so much to God
[1:35:10] till it stayed the wrath of God and God
[1:35:13] would not cross over Moses he says that
[1:35:15] always was a puzzle to me till one day
[1:35:18] in Revelation of the scripture there
[1:35:19] came this thought to me that you see
[1:35:21] Moses in Act was every way substituting
[1:35:25] he was a type of Jesus
[1:35:29] Christ
[1:35:32] wow if you're going to be a
[1:35:35] messiah you got to be the full
[1:35:38] thing you know we find so often even
[1:35:41] looking at this that people aren't often
[1:35:43] LED of themselves but they're led by
[1:35:45] others to
[1:35:46] destruction dathan and Kora raised up
[1:35:48] everybody got to talking no doubt Dayan
[1:35:51] and K had this little chitchat amongst
[1:35:53] them themselves and then what they do
[1:35:55] they started going out amongst the
[1:35:56] people raising up the people against
[1:35:58] Moses and those people would have never
[1:35:59] have said or done anything against Moses
[1:36:01] if Dayan and cor hadn't shut their traps
[1:36:03] if they just kept it to themselves God
[1:36:05] had dealt with daythan and cor but they
[1:36:07] had to go and sew that seed of
[1:36:09] discrepancy and riled up the people and
[1:36:11] you know what 250 men and their entire
[1:36:15] families paid the price for daythan and
[1:36:17] cor's
[1:36:19] arrogance Moses couldn't stop judgment
[1:36:21] on them
[1:36:24] God's not playing around but he could
[1:36:26] keep the rest of them from being pulled
[1:36:27] into that judgment by
[1:36:29] interceding but we look today I mean
[1:36:31] look at what's going on with all this
[1:36:33] anti-israel stuff how crazy how crazy
[1:36:37] people have gone nuts and who's leading
[1:36:39] them into it Hollywood politicians talk
[1:36:44] show hosts news people
[1:36:47] influencers and these people wouldn't do
[1:36:49] a thing and they'd have at least a basic
[1:36:52] semblance of Sanity but the these people
[1:36:54] get them inflamed and all they do is
[1:36:55] show them things that get them worked up
[1:36:57] and they never show them a balance and
[1:36:59] those people go and they camp out and
[1:37:01] they get arrested and they get maced and
[1:37:02] they get all these all these sorts of
[1:37:04] things and I imagine they're sitting
[1:37:05] there in jail wondering how did I get
[1:37:07] here what it was a spirit of
[1:37:10] insanity influenced by something that is
[1:37:13] not of
[1:37:14] God Church the whole world is under the
[1:37:16] influence of Satan except the children
[1:37:18] of God and we run into people and it
[1:37:20] seems like they're saying but tell you
[1:37:22] what put them in the right situation
[1:37:23] ation and you'll say how in the world
[1:37:25] did I think they were saying it happens
[1:37:27] all the time we work with people and
[1:37:29] they're good 99% of the time it seems
[1:37:31] like they're normal and then one little
[1:37:32] thing happens and it pops out and you're
[1:37:34] like oh my goodness there it is why
[1:37:36] because there's only two Spirits in this
[1:37:38] world the Holy Spirit and everything
[1:37:40] else is satanic and without the Holy
[1:37:42] Spirit we're back to beasts amen we're
[1:37:44] let around too easily this is the time
[1:37:47] of extreme events this is the end time
[1:37:50] extreme events cause extreme results and
[1:37:53] that's what we're seeing today we're
[1:37:54] seeing a polarization of people and all
[1:37:56] it's bringing is to the surface all the
[1:37:58] spirits that have been working around
[1:37:59] that's it they've been hidden but see
[1:38:01] now there's a freedom to be who you are
[1:38:03] and what happens is demons are now
[1:38:04] expressing themselves in plain view and
[1:38:07] it is now accepted as normal that's
[1:38:09] where we're at and what will we do
[1:38:12] church will we stand there and just call
[1:38:13] them demons or will we stand there and
[1:38:15] say God you've got some children in
[1:38:16] there remember remember what brother
[1:38:18] brandham said the angel rebuked him for
[1:38:20] calling them Ricky and ricettas he said
[1:38:22] some of them are my children
[1:38:24] we don't know who's in or who's out I'm
[1:38:27] reminded of of uh brother Isaiah Brooks
[1:38:29] talking about this young woman that came
[1:38:31] in and she had green hair and tats all
[1:38:34] over and piercings all over her body and
[1:38:36] she heard the word and she gave her
[1:38:37] heart immedi immediately to the Lord and
[1:38:39] she was baptized and filled with the
[1:38:41] spirit and she gave up her inheritance
[1:38:43] with her family her parents were multi-
[1:38:45] multi-millionaires and they said if you
[1:38:47] accept that then you will be kicked out
[1:38:49] of this house and they literally kicked
[1:38:50] her out of the house that night and she
[1:38:52] had to make a decision will I take the
[1:38:53] millions or will I take the Holy Ghost
[1:38:56] and she turned it down pierced green
[1:38:59] hair tattooed
[1:39:01] up a daughter of God Rahab was a
[1:39:05] daughter of
[1:39:07] God the persecuting Saul was not just a
[1:39:11] Son of God he was a prophet to the age
[1:39:13] we don't know who we're talking to we
[1:39:16] don't know who we're talking to I read a
[1:39:17] quote where brother BR says you come up
[1:39:19] on somebody says and they might be all
[1:39:20] beat up they got their ears beat up and
[1:39:22] they're in a rough condition look like a
[1:39:23] boxer something like that he says you
[1:39:25] don't know who you're gonna meet he says
[1:39:28] you don't know who's a child of God you
[1:39:29] don't know who's at an
[1:39:31] altar so you treat every one of them
[1:39:33] like a son or daughter of God
[1:39:34] potentially Amen brother Braham says
[1:39:38] Moses was the intercessor he stood
[1:39:40] between the people and God's Wrath he
[1:39:42] stood between the people and what was
[1:39:44] really their desserts Just Desserts he
[1:39:46] put himself between them instead and
[1:39:49] what was he doing he was banking on his
[1:39:51] relationship and his access to God to
[1:39:53] whole black wrath until those people
[1:39:54] could make themselves right our human
[1:39:57] reaction is to just step out of the way
[1:39:58] and say you want to go your way I'll let
[1:40:00] you go your way that is not the way of
[1:40:02] the intercessor remember brother Bram
[1:40:04] says we fight our way to
[1:40:06] hell so often what happens is we get
[1:40:09] offended and we say go right on the hell
[1:40:11] instead of sitting there saying no no no
[1:40:14] I care more about your soul than what
[1:40:16] you've just said or done to me and I'm
[1:40:18] going to fight to get you back into
[1:40:19] where you need to
[1:40:20] be you know sometimes even Believers
[1:40:23] need our
[1:40:24] intercession look in the scripture look
[1:40:26] at Abigail when David is coming down
[1:40:28] with 400 men fully armed and what's he
[1:40:30] doing he's coming to kill nabal the fool
[1:40:34] and Abigail is nabal's wife and she
[1:40:35] hears what her husband's done now listen
[1:40:37] Church she knows her husband's a
[1:40:40] fool she's not trying to intercede for
[1:40:42] her husband you know who she's trying to
[1:40:44] intercede for
[1:40:47] David because you see what she says she
[1:40:49] says my husband's a fool my husband's an
[1:40:52] idiot this is what's expected of him but
[1:40:55] David you're better than this and she
[1:40:57] says if you go down and you kill that
[1:40:59] man she says it's going to it's going to
[1:41:01] be a stain on your kingship when you
[1:41:03] finally get the throne David you're
[1:41:05] going to regret what you're doing
[1:41:07] here cuz David thought it was righteous
[1:41:10] anger you know what it was David was
[1:41:14] offended David was offended what he
[1:41:17] asked was reasonable but in the end he
[1:41:19] had no right to it and he got caught up
[1:41:22] in him self about what I did and I
[1:41:24] deserve this and when that man turned
[1:41:26] him down what happened is a Red Mist
[1:41:28] went over his eyes and he went with the
[1:41:30] sword instead of saying what does a king
[1:41:33] do what does a king do because remember
[1:41:36] a king
[1:41:37] serves and we see David serves so
[1:41:40] Faithfully when he comes into it but
[1:41:41] what happened was he made it about
[1:41:42] himself and he got offended and he was
[1:41:44] going to go wipe out that man and
[1:41:46] Abigail stopped him and she she
[1:41:48] interceded long enough for David to come
[1:41:50] to his senses and he thanked her and he
[1:41:52] says God s sent you my
[1:41:54] way you know sometimes people do things
[1:41:56] to
[1:41:58] us and it's
[1:42:01] rough I could tell you things people
[1:42:03] have said people have done to me it
[1:42:05] would shock
[1:42:07] you but you know what we have to do
[1:42:10] swallow
[1:42:11] it and say Lord they don't know what
[1:42:14] they're doing now some of it's easy you
[1:42:17] know that person had a hasn't had a new
[1:42:19] birth they may be a professing Christian
[1:42:20] professing message believer whatever it
[1:42:22] is but you know they don't have a new
[1:42:23] birth and sometimes those are easier cuz
[1:42:25] you know they're still immature they're
[1:42:27] not truly a born again son or daughter
[1:42:29] of God but those that do know better
[1:42:32] that's the harder ones it would be way
[1:42:34] more difficult for me to forgive brother
[1:42:37] Mark than a young child doing something
[1:42:39] to me in this service in this church why
[1:42:42] because I have a higher standard of
[1:42:44] expectation for him he's a Son of God
[1:42:46] he's a holy ghost philed
[1:42:48] brother but here's the thing is if he
[1:42:50] does something will I intercede
[1:42:53] or will Vengeance rise to my
[1:42:55] mind the royal priesthood are
[1:42:59] intercessors I want to talk about the
[1:43:01] nature of the intercessor and the
[1:43:04] scripture talks about what's going to
[1:43:05] happen when Israel receives Christ and
[1:43:08] they talk it talks about it in
[1:43:10] Zechariah and I want you to see the
[1:43:12] grace of God here it says and I will
[1:43:14] pour out I will pour upon the House of
[1:43:17] David and upon the inhabitants of
[1:43:19] Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of
[1:43:24] supplications what is it it's the Holy
[1:43:26] Spirit quickening them in one day
[1:43:28] they'll be saved the scripture says
[1:43:30] 144,000 in one day they'll come to a
[1:43:32] realization of Christ as their Messiah
[1:43:34] and what is the nature of that Spirit
[1:43:36] Church grace and
[1:43:38] supplications grace is unmar favor and
[1:43:41] what are supplications favor upon favor
[1:43:44] upon favor the holy spirit is a spirit
[1:43:47] of grace and
[1:43:49] favor they've rejected Christ they were
[1:43:52] the ones that crucified Christ they were
[1:43:54] the ones that persecuted the true church
[1:43:56] and yet the Holy Spirit coming on them
[1:43:59] is a spirit of grace and favor so that
[1:44:03] when they cry out God answers the very
[1:44:06] spirit of God is interceding on their
[1:44:08] behalf amen that's the nature of the
[1:44:10] Holy
[1:44:11] Spirit why am I saying that because when
[1:44:14] we get the Holy Spirit it ought to be a
[1:44:16] spirit of Grace and
[1:44:19] supplications because why there are
[1:44:21] people that don't know how to approach
[1:44:23] God they don't know there's a God to
[1:44:25] approach they don't know that they're
[1:44:27] outside of that God's will outside of
[1:44:29] his word and they don't have a clue of
[1:44:32] how to go to him they don't even have a
[1:44:34] clue that they need him so what do they
[1:44:36] need a spirit of Grace and
[1:44:39] supplications and who has it I have it
[1:44:42] you have it that's the one that can hold
[1:44:44] these things back in their life they
[1:44:45] can't plead the blood church we sing
[1:44:47] that song I claim the blood they've got
[1:44:49] no blood to claim they don't know about
[1:44:50] the blood they don't know what the blood
[1:44:51] does they can't can't claim the word
[1:44:53] they can't claim the spirit they don't
[1:44:55] have a token they don't have anything
[1:44:56] all they've got is you so when somebody
[1:44:59] comes to you and I know what happened to
[1:45:01] many of us they come to you and they say
[1:45:03] will you pray for me you know what
[1:45:04] they're doing they're coming to the one
[1:45:06] that has the spirit of Grace and
[1:45:07] supplication they're coming to somebody
[1:45:09] they can't go in his presence they need
[1:45:12] somebody that's been in his presence
[1:45:13] before that they see that you've been
[1:45:16] someplace that they haven't that you've
[1:45:17] got something that they don't have
[1:45:19] that's why they come and they ask
[1:45:21] you cuz they see that you've got a
[1:45:23] spirit of Grace and supplications that
[1:45:26] your life your approach your attitude to
[1:45:28] them means that they've got a right to
[1:45:30] come and talk to you why you're standing
[1:45:32] as a royal priesthood on their behalf
[1:45:35] now they can't even give the right
[1:45:37] confession
[1:45:38] Church they can't give the right test
[1:45:40] they can't do anything they're clueless
[1:45:42] but we're a royal priesthood that's been
[1:45:44] trained to come into His presence that's
[1:45:47] been called to come into His presence
[1:45:49] that's been invited into his presence
[1:45:50] that's been given the right to come into
[1:45:53] his presence at any time that's why they
[1:45:55] come to us
[1:45:56] amen this is an intercession of the
[1:45:59] Saints like the Catholics talk about but
[1:46:00] this is a people that can go to God and
[1:46:02] get
[1:46:03] answers that's what we're talking about
[1:46:05] this evening amen Esther was always
[1:46:09] welcome in the court of the
[1:46:12] king I'm sure there were others that
[1:46:14] came in one day and were accepted and
[1:46:16] the next day they weren't accepted but
[1:46:18] Esther was always accepted in the
[1:46:20] presence of the king why she was married
[1:46:22] to him
[1:46:23] he was her husband she had access to him
[1:46:31] 247 that's what we're doing going into
[1:46:34] his presence pleading for mercy and
[1:46:36] Grace for those that cannot enter his
[1:46:38] presence themselves that don't even know
[1:46:40] they don't even realize what's required
[1:46:43] listen to this as we start to close it
[1:46:45] says but the Levites shall pitch round
[1:46:47] about the Tabernacle of testimony in
[1:46:49] other words the priesthood is supposed
[1:46:50] to encircle the entire Tabernacle
[1:46:53] he says why that there be no wrath upon
[1:46:56] the congregation of the children of
[1:46:58] Israel and the Levites shall keep the
[1:47:00] charge of the Tabernacle of testimony
[1:47:03] what were they doing they were pre
[1:47:04] preserving the people from ignorantly or
[1:47:08] willingly stepping into judgment
[1:47:11] remember what happened when Aaron's two
[1:47:12] sons went in they were priests but they
[1:47:15] went in the wrong way and God judged
[1:47:17] them imagine what happens if you're not
[1:47:19] a priest to step in was death in death
[1:47:24] you weren't allowed in there God would
[1:47:25] strike you dead and so they were there
[1:47:28] and what were they they were a
[1:47:29] buffer from the wrath of God they were a
[1:47:33] type of Mercy for the entire encampment
[1:47:35] of
[1:47:35] Israel see why it matters what our
[1:47:38] response and our attitude as like
[1:47:41] church we're the
[1:47:43] buffer remember the scripture says woe
[1:47:46] unto that man by whom offenses come
[1:47:49] Jesus said offenses are going to come
[1:47:51] you're going to get offended people are
[1:47:53] going to do things to you they're not
[1:47:54] supposed to and he says woe unto he says
[1:47:57] judgment I don't want to be the guy that
[1:48:00] offenses come
[1:48:01] by that's why our attitude matters
[1:48:03] because if we won't take
[1:48:06] offense judgment doesn't have to go to
[1:48:08] that person that's what Christ was doing
[1:48:10] on the cross wasn't
[1:48:11] it they're doing the very thing that
[1:48:14] deserves death they're putting life to
[1:48:17] death they're putting the word to death
[1:48:18] they're refusing their Messiah and yet
[1:48:21] he stands there as a mediator and
[1:48:22] intercessor and says father forgive them
[1:48:24] they don't know what they're doing he
[1:48:26] refused to be
[1:48:29] offended he refused to be
[1:48:33] offended what a place we're in tonight
[1:48:36] we have the opportunity to refuse to be
[1:48:38] offended for their sake amen remember
[1:48:42] scripture talks about that that when you
[1:48:44] talk to somebody you go to them meekly
[1:48:46] and you do it it says peradventure that
[1:48:48] God would would bring them out of
[1:48:49] themselves that God would open their
[1:48:51] eyes that's what we're looking for
[1:48:53] that's the
[1:48:54] response but I want you to catch
[1:48:56] something and this is something I
[1:48:57] wouldn't say in public because it would
[1:48:59] confuse and it would stumble most people
[1:49:02] but I want you to see what happens when
[1:49:03] we step into this royal priesthood we're
[1:49:05] speaking on stepping up but I want you
[1:49:07] to see how big this gets and brother BR
[1:49:09] would say this he says the church is the
[1:49:12] blood of Christ by the spirit because
[1:49:16] the life is in the blood I'll explain
[1:49:19] that in a minute he says that's the
[1:49:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes
[1:49:23] us into his body that recognizes only
[1:49:26] his body his flesh his word denomination
[1:49:29] won't ever touch that he says it's a
[1:49:31] revelation she knows it and so did Eve
[1:49:33] know it but she fell but this one knows
[1:49:36] it and won't fall he says she is
[1:49:39] ordained Hallelujah wo she is ordained
[1:49:42] to not fall she won't fall she is she
[1:49:44] won't fail rather she is predestinate to
[1:49:47] it he says blessed is the man who God
[1:49:50] will not impute sin
[1:49:53] he says the church is the blood of
[1:49:55] Christ by the spirit because the life is
[1:49:56] in the blood remember we covered this
[1:49:58] before that the purpose of the blood was
[1:50:01] so that the life of the innocent could
[1:50:02] come into the guilty to come into the
[1:50:04] sinner but that's why the blood of bulls
[1:50:06] and goats never worked because the life
[1:50:08] of an animal is not the same as the life
[1:50:09] of a human and so the perfect animal
[1:50:11] blood can't come into a into an
[1:50:13] imperfect human but when Christ died
[1:50:15] what happened is we had a perfect man a
[1:50:18] perfect human died and so when he died
[1:50:20] the life of him could come back into us
[1:50:23] that perfect life could come into us and
[1:50:25] that's what makes us perfect but
[1:50:28] remember brother Ram say the life is in
[1:50:29] the blood so if the life is in you what
[1:50:32] does that make you the blood of Christ
[1:50:34] what is the blood for church it's to go
[1:50:37] and turn the Judgment seat into a mercy
[1:50:40] seat that's the only purpose of the
[1:50:42] blood is to change the Judgment seat
[1:50:44] into a mercy seat that's it it turns the
[1:50:48] wrath of God into mercy and
[1:50:51] Grace that's that's what a royal
[1:50:53] priesthood is church we are literally
[1:50:55] walking Mercy
[1:50:58] seats that's what we are when you're
[1:51:00] walking around our our attitudes our our
[1:51:03] responses our reactions are determining
[1:51:05] Mercy or judgment on a daily
[1:51:07] basis that's what it is that's how
[1:51:10] serious this is we're talking about
[1:51:12] stepping
[1:51:14] up walking Mercy seats if you wanted to
[1:51:17] put it that
[1:51:19] way why because we don't just have the
[1:51:22] blood but we got the life of the blood
[1:51:23] in us and that's what matters the
[1:51:26] most that's why our attitude
[1:51:29] matters that's why our reaction matters
[1:51:32] that's why we need to
[1:51:34] stop and consider before we
[1:51:38] respond to sit back and say
[1:51:41] Lord what are my options here what would
[1:51:44] you have me do because we're still under
[1:51:47] the Grace Covenant and as far as I'm
[1:51:49] concerned that means we ought to offer
[1:51:50] Grace as long as they want it if they'll
[1:51:53] take it we'll give it and if they walk
[1:51:55] away that's on them if they want to keep
[1:51:57] walking to Hell let them walk if they
[1:51:58] want to push through us then let them
[1:52:00] push but let us stand in the way and say
[1:52:02] Lord forgive them they don't know what
[1:52:03] they're doing lead them to you spare
[1:52:06] them one more time
[1:52:09] lord then we got people that get into
[1:52:12] situations like I said we sing that song
[1:52:14] I claim the blood they get into
[1:52:16] situations and all they can confess is
[1:52:18] the
[1:52:19] situation my family's broken my marriage
[1:52:22] is broken broen my finances are broken
[1:52:23] my career is
[1:52:25] broken my health is
[1:52:29] broken that's all they can
[1:52:31] confess but that's not going to get you
[1:52:33] anywhere with God unless you say so I'm
[1:52:37] coming to you to fix it but that's why
[1:52:40] people come to us and they say pray for
[1:52:42] me my family's broken pray for me my
[1:52:44] church is broken pray for me I don't
[1:52:46] know what to do pray for me I don't know
[1:52:48] where to go why because they're trusting
[1:52:50] that we've got access to something that
[1:52:51] they seem to lack
[1:52:53] they may never have prayed before in
[1:52:54] their lives or maybe they're praying and
[1:52:56] they're getting nowhere but they see
[1:52:58] that you seem to have something they
[1:53:01] don't why because we're ordained to
[1:53:04] enter his presence to seek mercy and
[1:53:07] Grace
[1:53:09] amen our confession they confess the
[1:53:11] situation you know what we confess
[1:53:13] Church the word that's what we confess
[1:53:16] that's why our confession is accepted as
[1:53:17] Believers is because we confess the word
[1:53:20] not the situation so there're so caught
[1:53:22] up in their broken family their broken
[1:53:24] Church their broken relationship their
[1:53:26] broken finances their broken Health but
[1:53:27] what is the believer saying Thy word is
[1:53:30] yay and amen by his stripes we are
[1:53:32] healed he owns a cattle on a thousand
[1:53:34] hills he'll withhold no good thing from
[1:53:36] them that love him we can give the right
[1:53:39] confession that God can accept in their
[1:53:45] stad check
[1:53:48] this this is the Amplified of Ephesians
[1:53:51] 6:18 says pray at all times on every
[1:53:55] occasion and in every
[1:53:58] season not just when things are bad when
[1:54:01] things are rough we build ourselves up
[1:54:04] in the good times so that we're prepared
[1:54:05] for the tough
[1:54:07] times he says pray at all times in the
[1:54:10] spirit with all manner of prayer and
[1:54:12] intreaty he says to that end keep alert
[1:54:16] and watch with strong P purpose and
[1:54:19] perseverance interceding in behalf of
[1:54:23] all the saints God's consecrated
[1:54:26] people the household of faith is the
[1:54:28] first place that we're always
[1:54:30] looking if you need me I want to be
[1:54:32] there for you and if I need you I'm
[1:54:34] trusting you're going to be there for me
[1:54:36] cuz what sometimes we can get caught up
[1:54:38] in situations we can be overwhelmed by
[1:54:40] situations in life I I I know with our
[1:54:43] sisters when they have babies it can be
[1:54:45] overwhelming the things that go on in
[1:54:47] life and so what do we do we do the meal
[1:54:49] trains you say that's not intercession
[1:54:52] that is
[1:54:53] intercession that we can babysit
[1:54:55] children to give somebody a night out
[1:54:56] that hasn't been out in a while that we
[1:54:58] can we can let them or or give them a
[1:55:01] gift or send them out on a vacation or
[1:55:03] these different things that is a form of
[1:55:05] intercession but what we need more than
[1:55:06] all of those things is to keep each
[1:55:08] other before the throne of grace because
[1:55:11] you know I think about brother Ivan
[1:55:12] there in the CH in in the hospital he's
[1:55:15] out of it he can't do anything the only
[1:55:17] ones that can pray for him are those
[1:55:19] that are
[1:55:19] outside I me when when brother Mark is
[1:55:22] sleeping through his his
[1:55:24] procedures there's only he can't pray
[1:55:27] for himself he's
[1:55:29] sleeping we got to pray for him when
[1:55:32] somebody gets called to the hospital
[1:55:34] when something's happening at at work
[1:55:36] when something's going on in
[1:55:37] relationships when their business is
[1:55:39] struggling struggling when their health
[1:55:40] is struggling what do we do we take them
[1:55:43] before the throne of grace and we
[1:55:44] intercede on their behalf remember
[1:55:47] brother Ram says prayer changes things
[1:55:49] it's not that prayer changes the will or
[1:55:50] the mind of God but prayer changes
[1:55:53] people and sometimes what they need is
[1:55:56] us to help pray them out of
[1:55:57] it it sets God In Motion it's a trigger
[1:56:00] that that pulls God into moving these
[1:56:02] things amen we can get worn we can get
[1:56:05] tired we can get
[1:56:07] weary and that's when we need each other
[1:56:09] to be
[1:56:10] interceding you know I rely on my wife
[1:56:12] to tell me when I'm over tired when I'm
[1:56:15] worn out when I've been doing too much
[1:56:17] because it comes up so slowly that I
[1:56:19] don't realize how far I've gone and it
[1:56:21] takes some outside of me to see those
[1:56:24] things and you know what we can see that
[1:56:26] with each other we can see that with
[1:56:28] each other we can see the tiredness we
[1:56:30] can see the dark circles under our eyes
[1:56:32] we can see the the you know the the e or
[1:56:34] face that sometimes we have in these
[1:56:36] different things we can see when
[1:56:37] somebody's not worshiping we can see
[1:56:40] when somebody's not responding to the
[1:56:41] word and what do we do we don't go to
[1:56:42] them and say what are you doing no we go
[1:56:44] and intercede because we know what they
[1:56:47] used to be and we know what they are and
[1:56:49] we say Lord It's not the Holy Spirit
[1:56:51] that's making that difference
[1:56:53] raise them up again restore them back to
[1:56:55] where they used to be we intercede for
[1:56:57] each other amen the royal priesthood is
[1:57:00] here to speak on behalf of those who
[1:57:02] can't and sometimes for those that
[1:57:05] won't sometimes it seems like our
[1:57:07] prayers aren't answered and so we just
[1:57:10] stop praying and that's when others can
[1:57:12] kind of Step In sometimes and carry on
[1:57:14] that burden so that God can restore you
[1:57:16] back to full
[1:57:18] Fellowship as we start to
[1:57:21] close Paul would talk about acceptable
[1:57:23] sacrifices not just sacrifices and I
[1:57:26] want to finish with this thought tonight
[1:57:27] just a scripture and two quotes he says
[1:57:29] by him therefore let us offer the
[1:57:32] sacrifice of praise to God continually
[1:57:35] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[1:57:38] thanks to his name he says but to do
[1:57:41] good and to communicate forget not for
[1:57:43] with such sacrifices God is well pleased
[1:57:46] I put I call this the simplify version I
[1:57:48] took two different versions of it and
[1:57:50] put it together he says don't neglect to
[1:57:51] do what is good and to share for God is
[1:57:55] pleased with such with such
[1:57:58] sacrifices so often we get caught up in
[1:58:02] situations in
[1:58:04] circumstances in the way things are and
[1:58:07] we forget that the primary priest
[1:58:10] purpose of the priesthood is to praise
[1:58:12] and glorify
[1:58:14] God and how does he see it how does Paul
[1:58:16] say we do it he says the fruit of our
[1:58:19] lips how we talk he's not just talking
[1:58:22] about singing in church he's not just
[1:58:24] talking about worshiping he's talking
[1:58:25] about how we actually talk day by day
[1:58:28] the things we say the things we
[1:58:30] do that's the fruit of our
[1:58:33] lips and he's saying out of that let
[1:58:35] that be an acceptable sacrifice say the
[1:58:38] right thing confess the right thing
[1:58:41] testify of the word that's the sacrifice
[1:58:44] that God's looking for is a people that
[1:58:46] will keep the word continually before
[1:58:47] him listen it's not just the good times
[1:58:50] good time Christians aren't chrans amen
[1:58:53] but we're supposed to be able to worship
[1:58:54] and praise him no matter what's going on
[1:58:57] and that's that's when we're really
[1:58:58] behind that Veil brother Bron would talk
[1:59:00] about the inner Veil you know the the
[1:59:03] secret life and these different things
[1:59:05] and it's when we can step back in there
[1:59:06] and nothing phases us I'm always amazed
[1:59:09] at Jesus sleeping in the storm and I
[1:59:11] don't know if it was because he was so
[1:59:12] at rest or because he was so tired but
[1:59:14] regardless to sleep in the storm to
[1:59:16] sleep when you're going through a
[1:59:17] medical procedure that's what I'm
[1:59:19] talking about amen that's what I want
[1:59:22] have in my life is that no matter what's
[1:59:24] going on the fruit of my lips would be
[1:59:26] to give him praise and glory every
[1:59:27] single day amen let's stand if we would
[1:59:30] as I ring these last two quotes he says
[1:59:33] what does a priest do he makes a
[1:59:35] sacrifice and what's a spiritual
[1:59:37] sacrifice that's what these Sons and
[1:59:39] Daughters do which are Kings and Priests
[1:59:41] he says yet not in full
[1:59:44] possession even in adoption we're not in
[1:59:47] full possession why because we're still
[1:59:49] Bound in these sinful bodies he says but
[1:59:51] even though we we don't have it all in
[1:59:54] other words even though we don't maybe
[1:59:55] have the full Victory we don't have the
[1:59:57] full answer we don't have the full
[1:59:59] healing we don't have the full
[2:00:00] restitution we don't have full sight of
[2:00:02] what's going to happen of what we're
[2:00:04] praying about he says even though we
[2:00:05] don't have it all he says they're making
[2:00:08] sacrifices offering to God spiritual
[2:00:11] sacrifices the fruits of our lips giving
[2:00:13] praise to him he says you say brother
[2:00:15] bam I just don't feel like praising
[2:00:19] him rubber meets the road to see evening
[2:00:22] church it's a Wednesday night I just
[2:00:24] don't feel like praising him I'd rather
[2:00:27] be home in bed I wish brother John would
[2:00:30] let us
[2:00:33] go I just don't feel like praising
[2:00:36] him he says that's the time to make
[2:00:40] the
[2:00:43] sacrifice sacrifices are not about
[2:00:46] feeling
[2:00:47] good what's a sacrifice if it feels good
[2:00:50] it's like you and I were talking about
[2:00:52] me moving here and you were saying it's
[2:00:53] a sacrifice can't be a sacrifice if it
[2:00:55] feels good if you're content in it if it
[2:00:58] brings you joy and happiness that's not
[2:00:59] a sacrifice amen but a sacrifice is when
[2:01:02] you don't want to when it doesn't feel
[2:01:05] good when you don't have
[2:01:07] energy that's when you want to give the
[2:01:09] sacrifice that's when it is a sacrifice
[2:01:12] that's when it is a sacrifice is when
[2:01:13] there's nothing there that would warrant
[2:01:15] it yet you do it anyways why because
[2:01:18] he's God and he's worthy of Our Praise
[2:01:20] amen he says that's that's the time to
[2:01:22] make the sacrifice Praise Him anyhow we
[2:01:24] are Kings and Priests Sons and Daughters
[2:01:26] offering spiritual sacrifice the fruit
[2:01:28] of our lips giving praise unto his name
[2:01:31] he says while we're groaning veiled in
[2:01:33] this Tabernacle of humiliation has your
[2:01:35] body humiliated you
[2:01:40] recently I'm getting
[2:01:43] older things hurt things
[2:01:46] ache but even beyond that
[2:01:49] silliness sometimes I let myself down
[2:01:53] and it's a body of humiliation Paul
[2:01:55] called it this body of
[2:01:57] death right he says veiled in this
[2:02:00] Tabernacle of humiliation we have the
[2:02:03] earnest we have the down payment of our
[2:02:06] perfect complete Redemption back like we
[2:02:08] were in the beginning when God created
[2:02:09] Adam in the Garden of Eden he says we
[2:02:12] have a foretaste of Glory Divine by the
[2:02:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[2:02:16] refreshment coming from the presence of
[2:02:18] God to water the church and to make it
[2:02:22] grow in Grace it's a spirit of Grace and
[2:02:25] supplications he gives it to us so we
[2:02:28] can have it and then he says now as you
[2:02:30] freely receive freely give to others he
[2:02:32] says and when we're sick with red we
[2:02:34] have Redemption the blessing the
[2:02:36] attributes of the death of Christ Divine
[2:02:38] Healing as a force sign to us that
[2:02:40] someday this Mortal will take on
[2:02:42] immortality he says yes sir amen oh my
[2:02:46] marvelous he says he's here to do it
[2:02:48] glory amen God help us to to be
[2:02:52] intercessory
[2:02:54] priests amen for those that are in this
[2:02:56] local body for those that are in the
[2:02:58] global body we think of brother Ron
[2:03:00] Spencer over there four years plus going
[2:03:03] and we pray for that man pray for him
[2:03:06] every day pretty much we're interceding
[2:03:08] on his behalf but then we walk around
[2:03:11] and we're to intercede with those that
[2:03:13] come our way to offer Mercy to offer
[2:03:15] Grace to offer a light to offer love
[2:03:17] when it's not deserved to offer a soft
[2:03:20] answer when we have every right to give
[2:03:22] otherwise in all of these things to
[2:03:25] intercede what per chance that God could
[2:03:28] reveal himself to them and they could
[2:03:31] find themselves into his presence
[2:03:33] amen when those priests went
[2:03:36] in when they walked in they weren't
[2:03:39] sitting there
[2:03:41] saying brother John does not deserve the
[2:03:46] atonement brother Joe does not deserve
[2:03:49] the
[2:03:50] blood brother Bob B he offended me last
[2:03:54] service brother Dale didn't shake my
[2:03:59] hand no when they went in it was with
[2:04:03] humility under the grace and the
[2:04:05] atonement that they have received to say
[2:04:07] now I'm going in for them too they never
[2:04:09] thought about the people all they
[2:04:11] thought about is what the outcome was
[2:04:13] going to be that's what matter most the
[2:04:17] outcome not the path not the road not
[2:04:20] the mess not not the emotions not the
[2:04:24] circumstances the outcome that's what
[2:04:27] the intercessor is focused on can we
[2:04:30] have an eternal outcome for their good
[2:04:32] that's what we're called amen God bless
[2:04:36] you let's bow our
[2:04:37] heads Heavenly
[2:04:40] Father Lord where where the rubber meets
[2:04:42] the
[2:04:44] road Lord we're coming to a place of a
[2:04:47] greater dying out Lord where we can
[2:04:49] humble ourselves humble our emotions
[2:04:51] humble our Lord this reputation that we
[2:04:55] so often claim we
[2:04:58] have Lord we're tearing down facades
[2:05:01] tonight Lord and we're saying Lord help
[2:05:04] us to
[2:05:05] intercede Lord help us to put their
[2:05:07] Eternal destination above our own Lord
[2:05:11] let us put everything we have let us
[2:05:13] live continually Lord even as you do for
[2:05:15] us Lord to intercede on behalf of those
[2:05:18] that can't or won't Lord I pray that you
[2:05:21] would find our
