Heavenly Father lord it's our desire Lord great Believers in Past Times or great man came and people went into fanaticism because they thought they might be Christ Lord but your Prophet came and he said that's closer to the truth than to say they're not Lord even in himself Lord that Lord we could live a life or where people would see Christ in us so Lord I pray you help us to surrender this evening Lord It's Perfectly in line Lord with the thought for the service Lord help us to lay ourselves down Lord help us to serve you Lord with our mind with our body with our spirit Lord that our soul lord would be just completely inclined towards you in your word Lord that we'd walk Lord A Life That's pleasing to you Lord that when it's all said and done we'd hear those words well done th good and faithful servant enter into the joys that have been prepared Lord would you just encourage your people tonight Lord strengthen us teach us Lord correct us Lord draw us closer to you we pray Lord Set This World aside in our lives and hearts we pray Lord those that aren't here tonight Lord we pray your grace to them the healing touch that's needed Lord we pray your mercy for each one in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Mark chapter 10 if you can't tell my voice still isn't back to where it needs to be but we're just trusting the Lord tonight amen just to get us through it amen it's good to see each one and just wanted to announce we'll be away next week I'll I'll be ministering on Sunday but I'm going to take the family away for a short vacation for 4 days to the West Coast so uh brother Paul will take the the Wednesday night service with an adult Sunday school or exhortation or whatever you want to call it so amen pray for him but we'll be away for those four days and hopefully we'll get a chance to see brother Doug sister Beverly while we're out there just for maybe a few minutes for an evening or something but uh just trusting God to be with us amen and Mark 10's good to see everyone here it was a small crowd when we started and then it got bigger and bigger as the service went on and you know what that means means you made a decision amen you can say we're late and there's no point going or you can say we're supposed to be in church and I was listening to brother Lonnie Jenkins at home before I I came up for supper this morning he was talking about prophecy but he said there's a few things the message does and it sets some basic principles and he says it's a first as you you hear the word and you receive it and then you repent and be baptized and then he says you read your Bible and pray he says you feed your EXP experience but then he said there's a post of Duty and he read this quote where brother banham just went on and on about a post of Duty and he says when those Church doors open you have a post of Duty to be there amen he called US soldiers he said soldiers have a post of Duty amen I believe that's what we've got is we've got soldiers here that said it's my post a duty to be there certainly for the preacher it's a big help for the song leader it's a big help amen when you start with 15 and you end with 30 it's it certainly helps a lot so God bless you each one that's come out this evening and I know many are tired and maybe not feeling well but God bless you for being here amen we've seen what happens when people come into the presence of God Amen Mark 10:42 very familiar scripture and it says but Jesus called them to him and saith unto them he's speaking to his disciples ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise Authority upon them so Jesus is setting up a contrast now between the way the world does things and the way the Believers do he says but so shall it not be among you but whomsoever shall be great among you shall be your minister now that word Minister means servant of a king it means a waiter one that serves food and drink but the religious world and the political world has elevated ministers to a place of uh uh of of being served rather than them being servants and it's come to the place where if you're a minister whether it's a political uh role or if it's a ministerial role in a church and we've turned it around to where we think that you ought to serve us and we think that you ought to make our lives easy and you ought to do this for us and you ought to do that for us and it's turned into a coddled position rather than a serving position amen but there's supposed to be a servant's heart in a minister amen that's literally the definition of a a minister is that he's a servant amen yes we're supposed to be respectful we're supposed to to to be appreciative of those men and whatnot but there's got to be a servant's heart inside of a minister otherwise regardless of the gift he'll never be able to do anything good in the kingdom of God because his purpose is is to serve first and foremost amen amen you aren't my master amen I'm your minister but you're not my master I serve you but Christ is my master amen that's the way these things work he says and whosoever of you will be the chiefest who wants to be first he says let he he shall be the servant of all so there's the confirmation Amen to be great in the kingdom of God is to be a servant amen the greatest of Christ's Kingdom will be servants he says for even the son of man came not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many amen the king of King Lord of lords came to minister he came to serve he came to lay down his life above all those things amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're taking I believe the last service on this attribute of Charity that we've been speaking on from second Peter chapter 1 and I want to take a title this evening of power to serve amen and we've said before that there's word charity in the in second Peter is that word agapo in the Greek and it's the holy spirit it's the very life of God and it's commonly just called love that's what it says elsewhere in the scriptures it'll call it charity it'll call it love but it's only used exclusively in the New Testament because this love wasn't available to reside in a human being until Christ came and gave his life amen it wasn't available God could put his Spirit on someone he could put his Spirit on David on Samuel on Joshua on Moses and many others but they couldn't experience what Peter was talking about in second Peter chapter one because they were under the old Covenant and they were in a covenant where their sins were covered but that was not enough God couldn't come into a vessel whose sins were covered amen and he had to come and he had to shed his blood and that separated us from our sins amen I've got a real Echo up here brother Matt if you can help me out amen but that's the revelation of justification amen when it comes to sin is that it's not as if you never did it amen but it says it's it's that you never did it in the first place brother brandham would say Amen that you didn't do it because your sins have been separated from you there's nothing to tie you to it it's a complete and total separation and this is what it says in the Scripture it says he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea if you want proof of that you can go look at Hebrews 11 because I was talking about this with a brother this week and it was such a revelation to me when a visiting Minister came and and just mentioned this kind of off hand because you look at the Old Testament and it talk tells the stories of the faithful ones it tells the stories of of Abraham and Sarah and Moses and all these different ones and it tells they're good and it tells they're bad in the Old Testament and then we get to see the humanity of those people but then you come to Hebrews 11 and Paul now speaking by the Holy Spirit writing by the Holy Spirit he writes their stories and there's nothing bad there it's all good why because everything they did bad is under the blood Paul's writing it literally through the blood of Jesus Christ and all he sees sees their faithfulness amen and that's why we're the Sons and Daughters of Abraham where the Seed of Abraham is because our righteousness is by faith in Christ not in our works and so in Hebrews 11 you see the effect of their faith and it was that there was going to come a sacrifice a perfect sacrifice that would separate them from their sin and through that they are seen perfect through God's eyes amen that's what the blood of Christ does is it separates us from our sin and Christ literally became our sin scripture says he it was a literal transformation he became us so that we could become him when we got the greatest deal in the history of humanity was when he took our place and we got his place and now we stand here today by faith as the righteousness the very righteousness of God you and I are the very righteousness of God because Christ took our place amen but we know this Divine Love This agapo Love that we've been talking about it's the peak it's the Apex it's a Capstone it's the finishing element of the the Christian it's the highest attribute it's the highest nature that we can get amen but it's not just an attribute see we talked about brother love and we talked about uh faith and we talked about all these different things and those are attributes but when we come to this it's not just an attribute but it's a life amen it's the very Life of Christ inside of us and it's not something we can put on and take off but it's something that's with us all the time amen when he gives you the Holy Spirit when he fills you with the Holy Spirit when he comes and resides in you you cannot separate yourself from him amen nothing can separate us from the love of God what it is it's the Holy Spirit that's inside each one of us now Jesus would tell talk about this in John 14 and he's talking to the disciples about what's going to happen after he leaves and he says I'm going to send another Spirit he says and it's even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you present test tense amen that was Christ he says and shall be with you future tense and that's the holy spirit amen we know it's the same person because when Paul was knocked off his horse by the pillar of fire he said Lord who are you and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest what was it Jesus said I come from the father I go back to the father it was Christ himself back in that Pillar of Fire in his original form amen now there's a bunch of misst understanding I think about why the Holy Ghost was given and I'm only going to touch on a portion of it tonight but I want to hit the high point because if you can catch this then it'll help you with everything else that comes along as we come into adoption and it's Lord willing will start on the adoption portion that I've been trying to get to for many months now on Sunday but we've got to get this settled first because if you don't understand what the Holy Ghost is given for then you'll get adoption all wrong and you'll start trying to do things and you'll start trying to be things and you'll be expecting things that are not to be expected in adoption but this is a mindset we've got to come to about why the Holy Ghost was given and the prophet of God would preach a sermon called what was the Holy Ghost given for amen you want to know what it was given for go read the the the service that he preached on it but he read John 14 and he read the same scripture I did but he read a whole bunch more of it and then he would say this he said Jesus said have I been so long with you I've been so long with you Philip and you don't know me when you've seen me you've seen the father and why sayest thou unto me show us the father God was made flesh he says now here it is the father was God over you we saying we've been since Adam God the father was over Moses and the children of fire Israel in a pillar of fire then God was with us in Christ he walked with us talked with us eat with us slept with us God over us God with us then he says now it's God in us he says all God was come into Christ he was the fullness of the godhead bodily in a body it says all Christ was come into the church what is it he says now this is God working in you that's what the Holy Ghost is he says anywhere in the world that he would want to call on you you're right there he says working in you to do his good Good Will working in you to do whose good will his Good Will amen he says how we ought to thank God for that God the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of God living in his church moving through each age working out what his Divine will you know what that tells me my will has no place there my will has to be your will my will needs to be his will and then I can step into his Divine Purpose amen we're talking about this Divine attribute of of Charity of love and it's the very life of God and we see here that the Holy Spirit was meant to step into people to produce the will of God to produce the word of God to do what God wants done in an age and in a season amen and God has always used people he doesn't have to use people we see in scripture many times where God comes sovereignly to choose one but one once he gets that one he uses that one to get everybody else God doesn't just come to another one and another one and another one but what he does is he comes to one and he gets them on fire he puts his life in them he puts his message in them he puts his word in them he lets them see their time and their season and then that one goes and they get one and then those two go and get two and then those two get four and four get eight and you do the math and pretty soon you've got a body of Believers why because God came to one and he used that one to just go through and start to spread the word throughout amen that's how we we seen it in this church look at it we didn't have uh 18 people respond to an ad we had one person respond to an ad and he gets his fire lit and he gets baptized and his life starts to change and then one comes in and then one more comes in and one more comes in and pretty soon what do we have we have a body of Believers God comes to one and even then he didn't he didn't just come sovereignly to him he used another man didn't he God touches one brother bam says you want to Revival get your fire lit and then that'll go from one to the next one and the next one amen he uses people amen and it's it's not again that he's Bound by that God can do whatever he wants but generally speaking he does this he uses a fivefold Ministry Ephesians 4 tells us and there to speak and preach and witness and feed the people on a regular basis but I want you to understand the Holy Ghost is given to minister not just to ministers like we think of behind the pulpit amen it's for each and every one of us listen A Gifted Minister can preach without the Holy Ghost of course they can you can go out to many denominations and gifted gifted men the their ability to speak their ability to weave a sermon together their ability to Captivate the people the Charisma they have they can preach but that's not what preach means preach means to preach the word and demonstrate it as well and that takes the Holy Ghost but a gift to speak that they can absolutely do that without the Holy Ghost but to be effective in the kingdom of God you've got to have the Holy Ghost because otherwise you have no guide you have nobody to lead you have nobody to inspire except yourself and everything we do is death it's destructive it's chaotic amen I was listening to a message Minister the other day this says a color brother overseas there having special meanss and he says there is no man behind this Pulpit he says it's only the Holy Ghost now that's a mouthful isn't it but that's the way it's supposed to be is that there's only a microphone here and it's the Holy Spirit speaking through a man and that's the gift is that the man can speak as he's inspired by the Holy Spirit that's the way it's supposed to work but here's the thing is there's only one of me I said this in British Columbia talking to a church of 150 people I said you've only got two ministers here but you got 150 of you here and if you've got the Holy Ghost then that means you've got the ability to minister to serve to be a witness to people amen so don't just just look to me I have my opportunities to witness but you have them as well and if everyone's doing their part then we see a much greater pull from the world than we would have if it was just me or the ministry amen and these things what is it because when we get our fire lit then we want other people to get their fire lit as well when we get joy that that passes all understanding and peace that passes all understanding we see people that need that what do we do we want them to have what we have I I see co-workers and they're they have so much angst and they're just so worried and they're stressed about life and money and all these things what do you want you want them to have the same peace that we have I was talking to a A co-worker that's a Jew and just testifying a bit about the things that God's doing and and he said well how do you guys pay for this church you just got I saidwell we tithe and he said gross or net I said Gross mostly but he said our church brings in $50,000 our synagogue he says I handle that that's my my job we bring in 50,000 a church full of Jews right that's nothing but what he's doing is why did he ask gross or net because he's doing the numbers and he's said and he's saying how can somebody live taking 10% off the gross 10% off the net is bad enough but 10% off the gross and you got a church full of people doing that yes why because we believe that I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread and we see do it over and over and over again amen that's what we believe and we've seen it in action that's a testimony I didn't have to tell him about Christ he's doing the numbers as a Jew and he says there's something Supernatural there I can't do it but he understood it he knew where it came from so it was a witness to him of people that believe in God Amen but I want you to see that there's only one Minister here right now today but there's a whole body of Holy Ghost filled people that have a work to do and and then we're talking about power to serve brother R says we are Pentecostal or are we he says the next thing if we are Pentecostals let's be Pentecostal If the message is right get in it anden if we believe what we say we believe then let's live it amen let's put our everything into it and he says if it isn't get out of it and find where is right sure if God be God serve him but you can't serve God and mmon at the same time let's serve God be convinced and then you be concerned then the church will really go to Growing cuz you'll go out and get everybody you can bring them in he's talking to the congregation now he says but as long as you go around and just say well that's the preacher's job he says it isn't the preacher's job it's everybody's job right every born again Christian has that same spirit in them he says the preacher might be gifted but that's just a gift of of the Holy Ghost it's not the Holy Ghost the Difference Maker is the Holy Ghost amen he says the gift of the Holy Ghost preachers are called prophets and teachers and evangelists and pastors and so forth they receive the Holy Ghost and then a gift to do those things with it that's the true gift is you have the Holy Ghost and then he gives you a gift to let him use you he says but God don't have any little itty bitty children or great big children they're all children to him that means there's no big eyes and there's no little 's each and every one of us we have the Holy Ghost we are the same in his eyes different positions but we are the same listen non's little slave girl could still testify and she got him healed a little girl that had no right to to be kind to him she's a slave taken from her family and yet she witnessed that there was healing from where she came from amen he says that's exactly right and your rightful position your rightful position is right setting right now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every Power as a child of God as a holy ghost filled child of God every Power under Heaven is available to you to do what serve the kingdom of God he says you say I'm the least in the church I'm just a little itty bitty fellow anybody feel like they're a little itty bitty fellow sometimes listen to this he says but remember when he ascended on high see you are raised with him you're in the body and you're with Christ right now seated in Heavenly places he says if you're the skin on the bottom of the feet every devil is underneath you if you're just a bottom of a stinky toe in the B bottom of in the bottom of the foot of the body of Christ every devil is beneath you if you're the toenail every devil is beneath you he's trying to get us to see when he gives you the Holy Ghost and baptizes you into that body you have to understand that nothing can stand before you he says that's right exactly right the church where the head is the body is with it and if we are buried dead and buried in Christ then we're raised with him and his resurrection ction and set in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with every fire of Hell under us amen right no matter how little you are no matter how little you feel no matter your past no matter what you think about yourself if you have been baptized into the body of Christ he says every devil is under you what a place to be this evening every devil is under you nothing that is formed against you no weapon that is formed against you can prosper he says why our great conqueror has conquered every sin everything every sickness even death itself that's right we are more than conquerors in him that's our conquering powers that we're in him he says the only thing is we're seated with him in his throne looking to him as he looks over the father that's it you sisters you're a walking testimony everywhere you go you don't even have to open your mouth your long hair your modest dress your sober appearance your attitude your joy with the life that you have now is a witness wherever you go before you ever open your mouth and if you never even open your mouth people know that you're different but don't be scared to tell them you're happy with your difference you're happy with the life that you have that you have a joy and a peace and being different amen we don't have to pull away we don't have to to Sherk away from these things let me tell you there are people out there that look at us and though they don't understand they see something that they wish they had they wish they had a daughter that wasn't flaunting her body everywhere she went and showing skin all the time and making a fool of herself on social media there are young men out there that wish that there were girls that hadn't slept with 15 people before they get to them you're a witness and a testimony of a holy Life by the power of the Holy Ghost that's what you are out there brother Brown would say this he said as long as God has got a People God has got a church God has got the Holy Ghost marching with it that's what God gave the Holy Ghost for intellectuals will rise they always have but God has got a minority somewhere God's got a little church that'll move right on with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to claiming the light and they'll be the ones that through their testimony through the life that you live through the words that you speak through the things that you do day in and day out you will judge the world didn't the Bible say Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart they shall see God and doesn't it say that the just the Saints shall judge the Earth your testimony today will bring judgment against this city he says our testimony of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the power of God now listen this is power to serve he says a holy life will bring judgment against the city I don't have all the quotes here tonight but brother banam would say that the Holy Ghost is power to live a holy life he said every time somebody gets the Holy Ghost a Godly life will follow not may follow not should follow will follow and that is our testimony to the world if we never say another word but it was interesting when I was in BC with my team meeting there and during one of our discussions they were talking about the state of the educational system and and this woman said she said have you heard about these people that keep their children home and school them themselves because they're see because remember we're in Hightech and they're looking around and and and I made the comment I said why is it that the brightest minds are not from Canada anymore we were talking about a particular we met with a particular client and they couldn't find their expertise in Canada they've had to import every literally every employee they had they had to import from outside of Canada overseas typically I was asking this question why is this and we had a discussion about and they said well well the Ed the state of our education system is horrible and the things they're pushing in they're forgetting the real education they're putting all this junk and and this woman said well have you heard about these people that teach their kids at home and I said right here they looked at me I said yeah we we we we School our children at home and they said how how do you do that how do you have time to do that I said well I don't I have a wife that does it I said but we made a choice we made a choice it didn't just happen I said we made a choice that she would stay home she would raise the children she'd educate them to the best of her ability and I would make enough money so she wouldn't have to work I said now we live a simple life but I said we feel it's the best thing we can do for our family and they had so many questions this is a room full of phds double phds mbas like I'm the least educated amongst all of them if there's anybody could teach their children it's these people but what is it they haven't made a choice to sacrifice for the benefit of their children yet yet they absolutely could they absolutely could any day of the week they wouldn't have to amen but they couldn't get over it and most people look at us not just with homeschooling that that that many of us do and what not and they think we're weird for it they look at our our young women and they say well you're you're suppressing them and all these things but then our daughters get to marry as virgins and we don't have pre teenage pregnancies and we have marriages at last and we have people who get jobs and stick with them and they look at that and they see the attributes of our choices and they love the attributes but they can't grasp how we got there they can't say that's what does it they think you just have it somehow your kids are better than my kids no it's because we live a life according to a holy God with a holy ghost living inside of us that makes us do it you know we don't always have to bring up Christ brother bah said if a man likes to fish talk to him about fishing we can bring up the effects of the life that we have by the Holy Ghost just in talking about day-to-day things with people and you talk about it enough and they'll say how do you do this why do you do this and then you can say it's because I'm a Christian it's because I believe that God calls us to be separate from these things it's because we believe that the world is falling apart it's because we believe that the majority of the world is insane and so we've elected to do things ourselves because we believe that's better than what the world is trying to do amen they don't understand it but they often like what they see there are still people out there that have a shred of sanity left and they see people like us and they say how do you do it that's our opportunity that's our opportunity brother Brown would say this he says and then he was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in order that he could come back again to man and live in man and restore a man to a state of communion with him again and give him back as god-given right so you got to have communion before you get back to the rights you got to be tied with him in personal relationship before you start going around Swinging The Sword amen that's what he did that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost it's the father again God the Father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for who your Fallen lost brother brother and sister giving you his sister his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of Eden when he said Adam Adam Where Art Thou he says that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and takes its Abode there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls amen can we say Amen this evening not just because we're in church but amen that yes I'm seeking to witness I'm seeking to test ify I'm seeking to bring other people to this this message this end time message to bring them to a god that's alive and well to show them that Hebrews 138 is still here amen we're talking we're going to be coming to adoption and this perception that has been around I think for so long perhaps still is that when there there there that when we come into adoption that we're going to be walking around and it's just going to be great Miracles all the time and it'll be spoken word coming from our lips on a daily basis and the dead will be raised regularly and all these things and it's all about the signs and the Wonders and and it would never be a people that get sick or in need Jesus Promised you're going to be persecuted you're going to have hard times you're going to have to bear a cross they're going to say bad things about you you're going to get sick Satan's going to try and destroy you but then he said greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he didn't say it wouldn't be it wouldn't be tough but he says you will overcome and we can get into this thing where we think that we're just going to waltz through everything no character itself is a victory amen the very things we have we're soldiers we fight to overcome so we face opposition daily you feel it from the world in your place of work just you listen to anything you read anything you go online it's an assault on your senses it's an assault on the Peace of your mind Satan is knowing his time is short and he's pressing to hold things back amen but Jesus had talked in Mark 10 about being a servant and we read it at the beginning of service and he repeats the same story in Luke 22 but he's talking to Peter afterwards he's talked about being a servant and he says to Peter he says and the Lord said unto him Simon Simon behold Satan had desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat Satan wants to do that to us just scatter us to the Four Winds he says but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou are converted strengthen thy Brethren now before this what happened was remember two of the disciples they wanted to be big shots and they said Lord grant to us that one would sit at thy right hand of the throne and one would sit at the left hand of the of the throne and Jesus said that's not up to me to decide here today and it wasn't amen but notice the the Holy Ghost had not been given yet and those men were interested in position in power and in Authority they hadn't been changed they wanted to be big shots in the kingdom of God they cast out Devils they'd healed the sick theyd preach the gospel of repentance but like Peter they weren't converted and so it was all about me the me monster had come out let me be something great in your kingdom and Jesus said are you sure you can drink of this cup and they said we're sure he says then you'll drink of it and sure enough they did and they died they gave their lives for the gospel later on but me they're a witness of sorts sorts but just realize that they were limited in themselves because they were so focused on self they thought that this was about them watch what brother Braham says here he says Peter said Lord I'm willing to go to death and everything with you he said Peter after you are converted strengthen your brother after you're converted well Lord I've been baptized by you Jesus Christ baptized Peter he baptized the apostles all right now he said now I've been baptized I've done all these things and I've walked by you I've saved I've been saved and you gave me power now remember what happened was Jesus gave them power over Devils over sickness and these different things amen but what was that power it was the Holy Ghost but you got to realize it's always the Holy Ghost you and we'll see this in scripture in a moment but it was on them not in them and there's a huge difference between those things amen because we know it wasn't in them because they didn't get filled until the day of Pentecost but they had power on them given to them over sickness and and and devils and these different things amen it's always been available the spirit of God has always been available in a temporary measure it's always been available go back to Samson in judges 15 it says when he came unto Lehi the Philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon Him woman minut it was there wasn't there and then the next it was and as soon as it comes on him it says the cords that were upon his arms became his flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loose from off his hands and he found a new Jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith so he's walking along and he's Bound by ropes and he can't do anything and then the spirit of God the Holy Spirit falls on him and he breaks them as if they were wax I don't know if you've ever tried to break something that's that's wax it says flax that's burnt with fire Not wax sorry the minute you do that then the strands just part they don't hold it was like he was he wasn't bound at all as soon as the Spirit came on him amen Samson could do amazing things when the spirit of God Came Upon him and you know what you can see this in denominations brother B would talk about anointed ones at the end times he would say it is the holy spirit but it is on an unsanctified vessel it's an impure vessel and it can do wonderful things but then they go out and they can't live a Godly life they can't live according to the word what it was on them but it's not in them and there's no power to serve there's just power to do things but that's not the power to serve we're talking about amen Peter and the the rest of the disciples had that power before they ever got converted Jesus said so that's not the conversion but it comes with it amen Samson's problem wasn't when the Holy Spirit was on him when the spirit of God was on him it was when it was off of him because Samson kept going back to women Samson problem Samson's problem was women and without the the spirit of God on him he was unable to do what overcome himself amen he was unable to yield himself completely to the purpose and the plan of God Amen and so he kept getting tripped up time after time even David with a heart after God's Own Heart without the Holy Spirit on him gets tripped up why because it's a temporary thing it's not something that's in him amen he needed something that would change him and secure him for all time listen to this he says he that heareth my words and believeth on the him that sent me hath present tense eternal life everlasting life and shall not come to the Judgment but has passed from Death to life he says the holy spirit is an experience of being filled and endued with power for what service that means something in here has to change cuz what per willingly says I'm going to serve we all want to be served carnally speaking we want to be the big shot we want to be the boss we want to be the owner we want to be the manager we want to be the CEO we want to be the one that people do things for rather than the one that does things for people he says but confession and receiving Christ is to have faith and make your confession and feel free that God has forgiven you of your sins so it's being endued with power for service amen so Peter and the disciples had the spirit of God on them but it wasn't in them it was working on them but it wasn't in their soul and so they couldn't bring themselves subject to truly do what they needed to do they were sincere men they were sons of God all along they were sons of God they were sincere throughout all of this amen they were genuine but they had only come to a place of sanctification with the power of God resting on them at times listen to this brother Brown would continue he says you wouldn't expect God to put that power in an unclean vessel so he had to clean them up and give them a life of sincerity anyhow before he let them go out and preach the gospel this is before the day of Pentecost he cleans them up he sanctifies their life he pulls them out of the world he draws them to himself he teaches them how to do things he puts the right Doctrine in their in their mouths he shows them what's possible in the Kingdom of Heaven amen they were sincere but they weren't converted and that's the most miserable place for a Christian is because the life is clean but there's nothing dwelling in there and so what you end up doing is you you live a Romans 7 life rather than a Romans 8 life Romans 7 is uh oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death and Romans 8 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ what the new creation hasn't happened yet you're sincere I mean how many people do we see if you look at the teachers from the Baptist school and these wonderful wonderful Christian people sincere sincere is all get out but without the Holy Ghost they don't even believe in it how can you have it if you don't believe in it but sincere people but can't have the victory the way that we have it he says and they returned back rejoicing said well even the devils are subject to us see and why then he said now Peter I know all this but you're not converted yet see you're not right yet Peter you're not converted but after thou are converted then strengthen your brethren Peter hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet see and when the Holy Ghost come then Peter was an inspired preacher we can compare numbers just to make this simple on the day of Pentecost there was 120 up in the Upper Room 11 of them were disciples so 109 were converts even if we give all of those converts to Peter it's 109 Peter gets the Holy Ghost preaches a 10minute sermon and gets 3,000 converts that's the difference the Holy Ghost will make Peter was an inspired teacher why now he was stepping into the purpose and plan of God as a Son of God with the Holy Ghost now he had power to served now he had power to catch the vision Peter had the keys to the kingdom given to him before he ever had the Holy Ghost but he couldn't exercise them until he got the Holy Ghost why that was his adopted some position was to take those keys and start going around amen amen until he F he was filled with the Holy Ghost he was almost useless he had his moments but he could never overcome himself he could never stand up for himself he couldn't stand up for what he believed amen and then as soon as the Holy Spirit falls on him and fills him and and seals his soul he's changed and he never turns back he never runs in fact he gives his life willingly and dies upside down on a cross just so that he wouldn't be compared to Christ considering himself not worthy he went from a man that was scared of his life to a man that willingly gave his life and chose an even worse death by dying upside down that's what the Holy Ghost will do in a man or a woman amen what was it it had settled him for life it had sealed him it had it had put the guarantee in him brother B would say he says that same group the disciples had to go to Pentecost to be baptized with the Holy Ghost he said exactly the Holy Ghost is power for service he says and the Holy Ghost is you shall receive the new birth after this he says what no you shall receive power acts 18 after this hly the Holy Ghost has come upon you see they had already believed to eternal life and so forth but they had to have the Holy Ghost for power you shall be Witnesses unto me after the Holy Ghost has come upon you because the Holy Ghost is a witness of the resurrection showing that you have become an adult in Christ amen you've grown up you've been proven consider this that this evening that without the Holy Ghost we're children in the kingdom of God Amen it doesn't mean you can't do anything useful or good but let's face it you can't trust children to do much how many of us would have a life or death situation and then hand it over to a child to manage or to take care of you'd have to be desperate it'd have to be your only choice to commit it to a child why cuz they don't have the strength they don't have the speed they don't have the discipline they don't have the focus to do something that's truly critical I mean I can tell my my youngest boy to go do something and six feet away and he just forgets what he was doing forgets what he was supposed to do and even as they get older you send them out to do something and they'll do it halfway or they'll get caught up in something they'll get distracted by something what you can't trust a child that way but when we become a man we put away childish things now God can trust us and he can use us in the Holy Ghost has given now to put us in the service of the Kingdom amen that's what its purpose is to make us useful in the kingdom of God it's not just for ourselves it does have a work obviously it has a work on on our self and on our character and these things but it's it's to give us a place where he can trust us it's to put us in a place where he knows that when he puts something in our hands we'll do what he asks us to do amen but it's not given for a show it's not given to cater to people it's not given that you tell me what you want me to do with the Holy Ghost that's not the way it works amen it's got to be inspired to me what to do by the word of God Amen its effect is to make us a willing partner with God cuz we're his hands where're his feet where're his voice where his body these different things adoption isn't us running around willy-nilly trying to speak things into existence that's not what it's about amen that's a carnal impersonation we see that all over the religious world today and it's coming into the natural world as I said last time this new fad of manifestation and these different things but we've see these people today and you've got you know the the the um Prosperity Gospel and what do they do they want luxury they want money they want big houses they want nice cars they want great jobs they want ease of living it's the exact opposite of what Christ said we were going to deal with why because they're selfishly motivated what is it they're trying to manipulate the word for their own gain rather than let themselves be manipulated by the word right they're trying to use the word for themselves rather than be us Us by the word that's what the true Christian does Amen they're trying to make it work for them rather than letting it work through them Paul would say this in Romans 8 very familiar scripture he says for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God not those that feel the spirit of God not those that dance in the spirit not those that speak in tongues in the spirit not those that enjoy it those that are led by it that's what determines the sons of God that's what determines the children of God brother Brown would say this he said God is is in his church to continue his works his Works amen that's why he sent the Holy Ghost amen that means we've got to be led by the Holy Ghost and our motives and objectives have to be selfless rather than selfish that's what it comes down to amen I'm not saying we never benefit it from it we benefit from it amen there's an effect of the Holy Ghost and it's a peace and it's a joy and it's a love and it's a rest and it's a guide and it's an inspiration it's an assurance it's a seal it's a token it's all of these things we have great benefit from it but it's given to us not just for ourselves but as Christ came to serve so we are come to serve as well amen but our if our application of the Holy Ghost is just for ourselves if it's just for me then I'm sorry but that's not the Holy Ghost working in me how can it be because the spirit of Christ will do what this what Christ did and it's to give our lives for others it's to serve others amen if you look at Jesus in his first in his in the first Temptation he had as soon as he got the Holy Ghost Satan takes him out and he tempts him and what does he do he tries to make him use his power and authority for himself he goes 40 days without food and then Satan says hey if you're the Son of God turn this turn these stones into bread what you're hungry use your power for yourself and Jesus said no it's written you shall not tempt the Lord thy God then he takes him up and he says now now now come up on the temple throw yourself off and prove to me right he's trying to challenge him he's trying to say hey you're a Christian hey you're a real believer you believe in the Holy Ghost you believe that Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever come heal my daughter that's what it would be today do something to prove yourself brother Bram says the Holy Ghost doesn't cater to anyone we're not here to put on a show we're not here to put on a show Jesus walks in to the pool of Bethesda and there may have been hundreds there he heals one one why cuz that's what God told him to do that's what he saw to do and that's what he did we're not here to play around with this and then he says and then Satan comes to Jesus he says now here here's all the kingdoms of the world he says worship me and I'll give them all to you what was he doing he was giving them an option to bypass the cross he says I'll give you what you're trying to redeem just worship me save yourself some pain use it for your own good and Jesus said' no I'm not going to do it but Satan will try and get us to use it to prove ourselves or to do something to our benefit that's not what it is it's power for service not power for personal benefit amen we can't serve here it says Paul said this you we talk about service our service comes later we get served in the Millennium we got a marriage supper of the land where we're going to get served we're going to rule and reign with Christ we got a serving time where we'll get served this is our opportunity to be like him Amen to get that but look what Paul said remember he was on that ship for 14 days hadn't seen the Sun Moon stares nothing just horrible conditions and Paul he comes up to give them a boost and he says for there stood by me this night the angel of God who I am and whom I serve Paul only had one person that mastered him and that was Christ he says I belong to him and I serve him and I serve him alone remember we read last Ser read last service where he said Paul didn't just come up and say be a good cheer he waited till the angel came and said you can tell them be a good cheer because here's what's going to happen he had to be inspired for these things so Paul says I belong to God and I serve God so who do we belong to God who do we serve God I'm not my own scripture says in second 1 Corinthians it says ye are bought with a price be not ye the Servants of men now sometimes we can get caught up in that we can get caught up in a boss that's asking us to do more and you know I remembered even when I was younger and I said to to people when I went in for a job and I did it in BC multiple times they wanted to hire me and you go into managerial positions and they expect you to work big hours and I said I'm a 40h hour a week employee if I can't get it done in 40 hours then it's not the job for me but I put down a Line in the Sand because what I don't want to be the servant to a job I don't want to be a servant to a man I don't want to be a servant to the money I laid a law down amen but here's the thing we can say well I don't do that brother John but we can become a servant to ourselves cuz I'm still a man I'm still a part of humanity it says that when it says that ye be not the Servants of men it means be not the Servants of mankind humanity and if I'm a servant to myself then I'm still in bondage and I'm not going to get very far because I'm Bound by this thinking that I have and I'm Bound by the desires of this body amen we can't serve ourselves in God Scripture says you can't serve Mammon and God at the same time you can't serve two masters because you'll love one and hate the other and what happens is if I'm in control of my life then I'll serve me but if I've died out and he's in control then I'll serve him he's the master amen the two Natures are contrary and we'll see as we get into adoption that the greatest thing you have to do is Surrender Your Will to the will of the father amen and that's by the Holy Spirit acting in our lives listen to this this is one of the most amazing quotes I've ever read he says and they that are the sons of God are led by the spirit of God he says then when the human element goes out step number one he says and the spirit of God fills that vacancy step number two where you empty yourself you empty yourself you make a choice you make a choice to lay down your life you make a choice to lay down your thinking you lay down your preferences you lay down the way you want it to do you lay down your feelings you lay down your hurts and offenses he says where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church in its power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus will walk in his steps in his power in his thoughts in his being in his moving he says you see what I mean then your thoughts will become words and words will become material he says that's when the church is in its power why because you think what he thinks you are he and he is you you've been United with Christ your thoughts are his thoughts and so all that's coming through you is what his thoughts his words his ideas his plan his purpose it's when we have emptied ourselves out and he's filled us that's when this happens what a place to be church that's a higher plane than I have found Lord help me set my feet on higher ground this evening amen we look at this and we say we're waiting on it we're wanting it amen are are you wanting it this evening I want it but you look at that and you say I'm waiting on God I believe this is why God would or brother BR would say God's waiting on you because we've got to empty ourselves we've got to make that decision we've got to lay that down on a daily basis on a greater level than we ever have before because there's this filling up that's happening and it only comes As We Lay Down and we put aside those things that matter to us amen this human mind has to let go of its controlling grasp on our decisions amen our preferences our ideas these things all have to go out and the word has to take preeminence in our approach to our day-to-day lives what is it we've got to fully die out we've got to get desperate to get out of here I me this world the prophet would preach a message called the world is falling apart it's falling apart church it's so far gone we've got to get out of here amen I want to step into a place of perfect peace and joy and rest where my mind doesn't have to go a million miles an hour brother BR would say this he says I believe it's on the road that when the church will be so wrapped in Christ the Holy Spirit mankind so away from their cells that they don't see themselves they don't have no motive but to serve God he says and their thoughts move on they refuse the things of the world they just move in the spirit they live in the spirit they move in the spirit they walk in the spirit and so fulfill the law of Christ then the love of Christ in the human heart moving in the Holy Ghost that great wonderful church will go forth with power and deity because deity will be revealed in human beings by the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind Paul said let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God now we're not presuming to be equal in that sense but if the the spirit of Christ is in us then that means there's a portion of God in us and so we don't have to put ourselves down in ourselves we're little we're nothing but with him in us now we're something and we're something that he can use amen I believe we've tapped into it at times absolutely we have I've been in in in moments in my life where I just knew I knew that I knew that I knew what I had to say and what I had to do and that it was the will of the Lord and I did it and it happened exactly as I expected why because I tapped in to what that inspiration that leadership that surrender CU it ain't always easy sometimes we got to shut up and that's not easy and sometimes we got to speak and that's not easy either sometimes we got to do sometimes we got to hold back I was listening to brother L like I said before the service and and they were talking about brother Bram said you know said he was reading that that scripture it says lay aside every weight and sin that does eily beset us and he said this brother said brother Brandon well I don't do anything he says that's your problem he says it's not what you don't what you do it's what you don't do he says he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it sin you've got to be doing what he wants not just holding yourself back we can sit in our house and be holy as all get out but that's not going to do the world a bit of good that's not going to do the kingdom of God a bit of good why he needs people that can be in service that he can trust to be out in the filth and muck of this world the darkness that's there and still hold themselves above it to live a holy life he says it would be the Holy Spirit bringing to pass the thought of their mind why because his thoughts are in you now not your thoughts in you then he says and now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking conditions in other words when we he can get our thoughts in line with his thoughts our will in line with his will our our words in line with his words he says he can get his church to a place that he can flow himself through what is that going to look like brother John they will love and persuade and fellowship and then there will come an Eden not when we can just repeat Doctrine back to each other perfectly not when we can open up the scriptures and expound on any subject that anybody wants to amen not when we can dance in the spirit and speak in tongues these things are all good but he says what when Christ can flow through us and we can love like he loved that takes the holy ghost that takes the Holy Ghost he remember I read that quote he says and maybe it wasn't here maybe it was someplace else but he said there's one thing the devil can't do and that's love cuz this kind of love will lay aside what I want and do what's best for the other person amen it's amazing we've got people today they that claim they're adopted and they can't give Grace to somebody that doesn't see things the way they do they can't fellowship with somebody that's not exactly the way they are they can't be around a Believer that's not as perfect as they are so you know what it means they're alone that's what it is you've got to be able to love persuade and fellowship see we forget we're not going to heaven alone there's people going with us it's a body bride it's not just a one man show it's not just a one woman show there's going to be people go there the prophet of God says it's going to surprise you who's over there amen I think it's going to surprise us who isn't as well Christ had infinite patience with the disciples and I I kind of chuckle sometimes when I'm reading the gospels because he'll say oh ye of little faith but he always gave them the answer answer they needed he always showed them the right way he kept teaching and teaching and teaching and he had long suffering after long suffering after long suffering and patience after patience and love after love knowing knowing that they would forsake him knowing that they would deny him knowing that they would leave him to him to to the guards and these different things knowing all of these things he loved them unto the end the scripture says it never changed that's what the love of God does it has nothing to do with how you are and everything to do with what that person needs amen Peter made a lot of mistakes and God and Christ still loved him loved him gave him the keys to the kingdom Peter made a lot of mistakes but Christ looked beyond it I want to close with this one thought where're PE speaking on power to serve and I want you to see that the very attributes of the Holy Spirit as we look at those are focused on serving rather than being served if you look in Galatians 5 it says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law is love for me the world this is this is how messed up the world is is they're focused on self-love now it's the biggest thing you got to love yourself you got to take care of yourself but you fall in love with yourself and you're good to anybody else you're too busy looking in in mirrors and and being on social media and talking yourself up amen love is for somebody else love is for somebody else there's no love unless there's somebody to receive it Joy sure that's for me peace is for me but I'll tell you this I don't want to be around somebody that has no joy or peace so while it might come from me and I get the benefit of it nobody wants to be around me if I don't have some of that so it's still for other people longsuffering longsuffering ain't for me as much as I've got to have it for myself long suffering is for the other person amen gentleness that's definitely for others goodness you say well that's for yourself well what's Badness for take the opposite side Badness affects other people so goodness does too our goodness is a witness to other people and our goodness is for other people remember what they said to Jesus I read it just this morning in my devotions they said what's the greatest commandment he said love the Lord thy God with all thy heart soul mind soul and strength and these different things he says and the second is like unto it love thy neighbor as thyself goodness that's where goodness comes in not just love what about faith absolutely Faith's for me I've got to have faith for my personal walk but remember the scripture says the prayer of faith shall save the sick that means my faith has impact on you and your faith has impact on mine faith is not just for me Faith for you I got faith for the Salvation of my children amen I've got faith for the moving of God in the assembly I've got faith in all sorts of things that that affect other people then we go to meekness meekness is completely about the other person meekness is the power to do something and choosing not to do it so that's when the other person deserves something and you hold back for their sake rather than because of your righteousness because of your goodness because of anything you're doing it for their sake you have power to do something and you choose not to destroy them you choose not to rip them apart you choose not to expose them whatever that case might be Temperance that's self-control that doesn't mean just flying off not flying off the handle but it's Temperance that keeps my life under control and it's primarily focused on sensual things and sexual things and these things but it's also material things the lust of the eyes and these different things and yes that benefits Me by keeping my life clean but it definitely affects my family it affects my marriage it affects what I do at work it affects the way I spend my money all these different things so the point I'm making is you look at every one of these and at least half of them are completely externally facing and the rest of them have a major impact on the people around us the fruit of the spirit is for other people to eat I preached on this before remember the tree doesn't eat its own fruit the fruit is there for other people that tells me that the Holy Spirit itself is given for service not for selfishness amen if people don't eat the fruit what happens it rots and it drops and it does it regenerates the soil underneath the tree so there's a benefit to it but it's meant to be eaten it's meant to be used and yet somebody comes up and they take our patience and what do we do get mad that's what it's meant for they're meant to take it and because we got the Holy Ghost we're meant to grow some more so that we don't get impatient so that we don't get worried and all these different things what is it it's power to serve it's power to produce a life that can benefit the kingdom of God by serving other people that's what this is all about what in the time and season of God's Cho choosing continuing in Galatians 5 he says and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts so we've surrendered our will we've died to our own desires we're living by the spirit of God he says if we live in the spirit let us also talk in the spirit is that what it says let us walk in the spirit that means talk that means think that means act that means be it's the whole part of living let us walk let us live in the spirit the Amplified says if by the Holy Spirit we have our life in God let us go forward walking in line our conduct controlled by the spirit you'll find serving gives us purpose because remember the Holy Ghost is given to take you into adoption and that's the placing of the child of God and when you serve what is it you found your place you found your purpose you found your reason for being and that's what the Holy Ghost has given to you for he says in all this let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another and envying one another the Amplified says let us not become vain glorious and self-conceited competitive and challenging and provoking and irritating to one another envying and being jealous of one another so the Holy Ghost is not given to make us at edge with one another that I'm competing for your spot and you're competing for my spot that you're trying to be better than I am in the same thing no the the Holy Spirit causes us to work together amen every time every time otherwise one of us or both of us is out of our position but I want to finish with one simple quote here and we've been talking about why the holy spirit's given and we know it's to serve and we know that we serve God and he directs us and he leads us by the Holy Spirit and he causes us to do things that we could never do on our own and it causes us to do things we never want to do on our own many times but a servant's heart is always one to help and if you've been given author Authority if you've been given orders to do something we're not supposed to stand off amen we're supposed to get in there and we're supposed to do whatever we can do to the the ability and the responsibility that we've been given but listen to this final quote see we talk about the Supernatural and yet brother Braham says we go out and we got a temper to fight a buz saww see we look at the big things but the Simplicity of a day-to-day life is escaped so many times I want you to listen to this very carefully as we start to close he says if there's anything we ought to be is kind to one another when you see a brother or sister in fault don't never breathe it to nobody keep it to yourself and pray for that person be kind to them he says and if the spirit of God is in you then you will be kind to one another Jesus said I come to do thy will father and we are about the Master's business as he was about the father's business and the same spirit that he had to begin the works of the father and to finish the atonement he says it was to make a way that we could carry the message and if that spirit's in you you'll have the same attitude towards people trying to do what you can to help them no matter who they are or where they are you'll try to help people amen he says that's kind of strong but that's the truth amen God bless you stand if we would the musicians can come then we know that he says you can do everything you can do to help them our help is not the same as worldly help our help is what you want is what I'll give you because we've got to give them a word help and then we've got to be able to give them the truth we've got to be able to do what's best for them if somebody's out there and they're spending all their money on on big toys and and the latest equipment and technology and all these things and they got no no time for groceries no money for groceries and they say brother John I need money for groceries I'm not going to give them money for groceries I'm going to say sell all the silliness that you bought and go buy your own groceries amen the help to them is not to give them what they want is to give them what they need which is sound advice to change the way they're living amen so when it comes to this help amen we don't love people as they want us to we love people as they need to that's what Godly love does it loves them the way they need it not just the way they want it now that doesn't mean we can't give them what they want somebody needs a hug we can give them a hug but they may need more than that to come out of where they're at a hug may not do the job amen and if we've got a servant's heart it's going to be for their best interest not just what's easy for us you know brother John Andy may be watching this but you know I I I um when I was in BC and we went to Victoria and I got up at 5:15 that morning and we left the hotel at 5:45 we went all day I was driving back and forth and the ferry got delayed and we landed late and it was just perfect the way it worked out because a couple people canel our their trip with us the day before and so we could fit in one vehicle in the end we thought we were going to need two but we could fit in one but we brought two so when we got to the to the ferry when it landed or just before I said can you take them back to the hotel and save me an hour of driving I want to go down and meet somebody in in Washington and he said yes absolutely do it but I'll say this in my body I did not want to go do that I didn't want to go do it I was tired not feeling well not sleeping well hadn't been eating I didn't want to go do it but you know what I want to be in Fellowship I want to go encourage other people and I'm a minister and a minister serves they do what's best for the other person not for themselves so I hiked myself down there and I went and I got the last 15 minutes of the service and and got up and said a few words at brother John's request and prayed and then had some fellowship and went home home and what was it it was to serve not because I didn't enjoy it but in in all honesty I probably would have preferred to be laying in my hotel and catching some z's cuz I was completely exhausted by that point but for their sake I went down yes I love them yes they're good Brothers yes I like to fellowship with them but I get Fellowship a lot but for their sake I went down and sure it did me some good and I enjoyed it but I did it for their sake not for mine and and that's what a servant's heart looks like is even when you're tired Jesus how many times was he tired you know we watch that chosen thing and that it's so beautiful that scene where they're talking about who's going to be the greatest in the kingdom and then what happens is Jesus comes from left Center left stage and he comes in and he's got blood on him and he's stumbling and he can barely walk because he's worn out from working with the people all day amen what are we tired about at night is it from serving others or is it just from serving ourselves now listen I look around I see this kind of church we're not serving ourselves I mean brother Dale came out and did all the snow clearing himself yesterday right didn't even use a snowblower brother Dale right what is it a servant's heart right and he he doesn't even like me saying this over the pop but I know because his face is turning red but you know what we need to thank people for when they do those things but it's a servant's heart and our trustees and our deacons in that brother Matt and of course brother Mark temporarily and brother Joe and these things are musicians they serve it's a servants heart why because they know their place they know they've been called to do these things and that's what the Holy Spirit does is it takes you to a place where you know this is what I'm supposed to do and sometimes listen a gift of the spirit is helps and every single one of us can help amen it's not just give Gifts of healing and Gifts of faith and Gifts of tongues and Gifts of ministering and no there's a gift of helps as well and it is no less a gift of the spirit than speaking in tongues then interpretation then ministering then healing then Faith remember there's no little bitty children in the Kingdom we're all one we're all the same filled with the same spirit in the same body amen amen the spirit brother Brandon would say this and again for the sake of time I didn't bring it tonight but he said there is he says the Holy Spirit he says his power in prayer its power in speech and its power to live a holy life I like that that you can go to God and you can be inspired by the spirit to pray for his will that you can say the right thing and that you can live a life that's above reproach amen power to do what serve him to bring our spirit to bring our nature to bring our mind under his control for his glory for his purpose for what he would have done in this time and in this season amen God help us to be quick and to it church that we're not just living life we're not just walking around we're not just going to jobs we're not just raising kids but in all of it as a mother you got a god-given purpose there as a husband you got a god-given purpose as an employee wherever you are as an employer you have a purpose there and God has a holy ghost anointed role for you in wherever you're at to do something for his kingdom amen each and every one of us from the youngest to the oldest the men the women it matters not we've been given power to serve Amen to do something
