[1:12:19] that's all right let's move on to
[1:12:21] consider Jesus the same thing
[1:12:24] yeah
[1:12:25] they considered even so-called Believers
[1:12:27] back there two thousand years ago
[1:12:29] they're insane because they believe this
[1:12:31] they're looking for this looking for
[1:12:32] that
[1:12:33] yeah
[1:12:34] because eternity was with them
[1:12:36] in flesh and now brother eternity is
[1:12:39] with us and Eternity is in US
[1:12:41] amen
[1:12:43] grace of God
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:48] I don't know where he went
[1:12:50] let's read verse 3.
[1:12:53] and it says the humble be and suffered
[1:12:55] thee to Unger
[1:12:57] amen and fed thee with Manna which thou
[1:13:01] knew us not and neither did thy fathers
[1:13:04] know that he might make thee no make
[1:13:08] thee know that man does not live by
[1:13:10] bread only
[1:13:11] but by every word that proceedeth out of
[1:13:15] the mouth of the Lord does Man live God
[1:13:19] bless his words you may be seated sorry
[1:13:21] to keep you standing so long
[1:13:24] but as I said before I don't worry about
[1:13:27] that because I said if they're out there
[1:13:28] in sports figures and sports games
[1:13:30] they'll stand for hour two or three
[1:13:33] hours to witness this sport or witness
[1:13:35] that sport witness this going on that
[1:13:37] going on and then and then there are
[1:13:39] those that are complaining because if
[1:13:41] they got to stand for now half hour in a
[1:13:43] church
[1:13:44] Amen brother but that's in time we're in
[1:13:47] eternity
[1:13:48] praise the Lord and if we're more
[1:13:50] subject to Eternity than we are time we
[1:13:52] won't be too conscious of standing up
[1:13:54] and waiting not by any means God help us
[1:13:57] to believe amen amen to believe that we
[1:14:01] are the sons and daughters of God Amen
[1:14:03] we are not creatures of time but we are
[1:14:05] creatures of Eternity amen we cover the
[1:14:08] eternity and we're going back to
[1:14:10] Eternity amen God bless you turn with me
[1:14:13] to the Book of Proverbs chapter 16.
[1:14:17] Proverbs chapter 16.
[1:14:25] and beginning to read at verse 16.
[1:14:34] he says how much better is it to get
[1:14:36] wisdom than gold
[1:14:39] amen
[1:14:41] and the wisdom that we're seeking is the
[1:14:44] wisdom of God
[1:14:46] because man is seeking the natural
[1:14:48] wisdom so that he'll get more gold
[1:14:51] and he'll be able to do this and do that
[1:14:53] and again get a great greater and a
[1:14:55] better job and so on forget it
[1:14:58] amen
[1:15:00] it's not it's not your will it's the
[1:15:02] will of God Amen
[1:15:05] so how much better is it to get wisdom
[1:15:07] and it's not in the wisdom of man but
[1:15:09] the wisdom of God amen then gold and to
[1:15:13] get understanding rather to be chosen
[1:15:16] than silver amen
[1:15:20] the highway of the upright is to depart
[1:15:23] from evil
[1:15:24] and he that keepeth his way
[1:15:27] preserveth is so amen
[1:15:31] stay with the word
[1:15:33] amen give the word preeminence in your
[1:15:36] heart give the word preeminence in your
[1:15:38] life amen you're not living for this
[1:15:40] world you're living for the world to
[1:15:42] come you're not living for yourself
[1:15:43] you're not living for living where your
[1:15:45] mom and your dad and your grandma and
[1:15:47] grandpa's amen you're not living all
[1:15:49] that personality he's my boss no no
[1:15:52] you're living for Jesus
[1:15:53] amen you're going to give him the
[1:15:55] preeminence by the grace of almighty God
[1:15:58] as I've said before that even when I
[1:16:01] when I was in in the we're working out
[1:16:03] there in in the world so to speak and
[1:16:06] part of the the
[1:16:08] stores and
[1:16:09] back there
[1:16:11] and uh part of management and people
[1:16:14] knew
[1:16:15] oh oh yes they knew that I was a
[1:16:19] Christian
[1:16:20] and they knew that I would pray for this
[1:16:22] and pray over that and so on oh yeah
[1:16:25] and then there was time when I I think
[1:16:28] one time there there was an issue came
[1:16:30] up and one of the managers came out
[1:16:31] talking to me and uh I said okay I'm
[1:16:35] gonna I gotta go in here and I said I'm
[1:16:37] gonna I'm gonna pray about it and ask
[1:16:38] the Lord about it
[1:16:40] amen it's not something that they would
[1:16:42] do but they knew that it wasn't unusual
[1:16:45] for me to do amen
[1:16:47] so brother sister are you where you work
[1:16:51] are you working as a Christian

[1:17:08] are there are times when they'll respect
[1:17:11] you more
[1:17:12] because of your faith
[1:17:14] why because I've been
[1:17:17] I've experienced that when I was in the
[1:17:18] retail business and I was in part of
[1:17:21] part of the management there and and I
[1:17:23] sometimes I would be standing at a
[1:17:25] certain time and maybe my eyes were
[1:17:27] closed and they knew
[1:17:29] that I was meditating they knew I was
[1:17:31] praying and so on oh yeah and other
[1:17:34] managers have come and said excuse me Mr
[1:17:36] Lush I know that you're you're this and
[1:17:38] you're that and so on but I said I just
[1:17:40] want to remind you of this
[1:17:42] but they would let me go on
[1:17:44] meditating oh yes that's all right they
[1:17:47] said when you get the time amen
[1:17:50] so brother are you really living as a
[1:17:54] Christian where you where you work
[1:17:56] are you working as a Christian
[1:17:58] amen are you acting and reacting as a
[1:18:01] Christian amen do you talk as a

[1:19:23] honest there are those out there
[1:19:25] as professing Christians but they're
[1:19:27] fanatical
[1:19:28] oh yeah and they want to tell them this
[1:19:30] and tell them that about Christianity
[1:19:32] about Jesus about that you wait on the
[1:19:34] Lord let God let God open the way
[1:19:37] and brother God will give you the wisdom
[1:19:39] to speak
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:42] so God help us whether that we're going
[1:19:44] to go out there and we're going to
[1:19:45] represent Jesus amen but brother let's
[1:19:48] let's do it with the right spirit and a
[1:19:50] right attitude amen
[1:19:52] not phoneticism but the right Spirit and
[1:19:55] the rate of let's be led by the spirit
[1:19:57] amen
[1:19:59] again in Proverbs 16
[1:20:03] and verse 16 how much better is it to
[1:20:06] get wisdom than gold
[1:20:08] and to get understanding rather to be
[1:20:10] chosen than silver
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:15] God help us that we're going to give
[1:20:17] Jesus the preeminence
[1:20:19] no matter what we're
[1:20:21] we're doing
[1:20:24] if you oh yes even if you're eating if
[1:20:26] you you lose your job stay with Jesus
[1:20:31] because there are those that compromise
[1:20:32] to keep their jobs
[1:20:35] oh yes I've seen that
[1:20:37] I've experienced those things
[1:20:39] among others
[1:20:41] but by the grace of God I wouldn't
[1:20:43] compromise
[1:20:45] not by any means
[1:20:47] I just seek the wisdom of God and the
[1:20:49] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:51] amen
[1:20:54] and brother if you do it right you got a
[1:20:56] right attitude right Spirit they respect
[1:20:58] you
[1:20:59] oh yes those you work with they'll
[1:21:01] respect you
[1:21:03] but then there are those the fanaticals
[1:21:06] I call them and but they're not using
[1:21:07] the wisdom of God they're not using the
[1:21:09] right spirit and right attitude and
[1:21:10] they're just religious
[1:21:12] and they want to say this to say that
[1:21:14] say that
[1:21:16] you know
[1:21:18] they don't respect that
[1:21:19] you've got to have a right attitude and
[1:21:21] a right spirit
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:26] so he said that verse 17 the highway of
[1:21:28] the upright is to depart from Evil and
[1:21:31] he that keepeth his way preserveth his
[1:21:33] soul amen Pride goeth Before Destruction
[1:21:40] and an Aussie spirit before a fall
[1:21:43] better it is to be of a humble spirit
[1:21:47] with the lowly than to divide the spoil
[1:21:50] with the proud
[1:21:52] God
[1:21:54] requires anything is humility
[1:21:56] and brothers you got the anointing
[1:21:59] God's anointing in your heart and your
[1:22:00] soul in your life
[1:22:02] you will be humble

[1:22:06] that you work with will recognize that
[1:22:09] amen that oh yes he's a Christian and
[1:22:13] you know because they know he's humble
[1:22:15] amen he's he's not he's not thinking
[1:22:19] he's a big big this and big that and
[1:22:21] always humble
[1:22:22] by the grace of God amen you got a right
[1:22:26] spirit and a right attitude so begin in
[1:22:28] verse 19 better it is to be of a humble
[1:22:31] spirit with the lowly than to divide the
[1:22:34] spoil
[1:22:35] with the proud
[1:22:37] God have mercy on us
[1:22:40] amen
[1:22:41] just a couple of other scriptures
[1:22:42] Philippians chapter 2.
[1:22:48] the book of Philippians chapter 2.
[1:22:54] amen
[1:22:56] concerning humility
[1:22:59] humble yourself as a Christian

[1:23:11] amen
[1:23:13] you want you won't be ashamed of of what
[1:23:15] you believe you won't be afraid of what
[1:23:17] you believe you won't be afraid to be a
[1:23:19] witness and a testimony amen but you'll
[1:23:21] be led by the spirit
[1:23:23] amen led by the Holy Spirit and yet
[1:23:26] there's too many so-called Christians
[1:23:28] there's too many so-called even
[1:23:29] Believers brother they just don't have
[1:23:31] the wisdom of God Amen they're very
[1:23:34] religious but they're not spiritual
[1:23:37] amen abide I did that are you religious
[1:23:41] or are you spiritual
[1:23:43] spiritual you're led by the suspect the
[1:23:46] Holy Ghost Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:23:48] led by the spirit of God Amen but again
[1:23:51] there are those that are religious and
[1:23:54] that's it Satan's anointing
[1:23:56] if it's the devil you don't you don't
[1:23:58] want you to be spiritual but he'll make
[1:23:59] you religious
[1:24:01] oh yes Satan to make you religious
[1:24:04] brother if there's anything that the
[1:24:06] devil is is hiding in out there is
[1:24:08] religion
[1:24:09] oh yes
[1:24:11] but brother the Holy Ghost is love is
[1:24:13] hiding in in not in a sense ID but is
[1:24:17] revealed in this in the revelation of
[1:24:19] his word god
[1:24:21] oh
[1:24:23] yes God in and God revealed in
[1:24:28] so praise the Lord amen
[1:24:31] go forth as a Christian revealing Jesus
[1:24:34] Christ
[1:24:35] amen by the grace of God amen
[1:24:40] so it was Philippians 2 and
[1:24:45] Philippians 2 and verse 5.
[1:24:53] let this mind be in you
[1:24:57] which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:25:00] amen who being in the form of God
[1:25:03] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:25:06] God
[1:25:07] but made himself of no reputation
[1:25:10] and took upon him the form of a servant
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:16] and was made in the likeness of men
[1:25:20] and being found in fashion as a man he
[1:25:24] humbled himself amen
[1:25:26] and became obedient unto death
[1:25:30] even the death of the cross
[1:25:32] if Jesus give us the example of anything
[1:25:35] it was humility
[1:25:37] because he humbled himself
[1:25:39] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:25:43] death of the cross
[1:25:45] God help us to Humble ourselves Amen to
[1:25:48] the truth to the word that will stay
[1:25:51] with the truth
[1:25:52] we'll not be ashamed of it will not be
[1:25:55] afraid amen
[1:25:57] but we'll have that Holy Ghost boldness
[1:26:00] but with Holy Ghost leadership First
[1:26:03] Peter chapter 5.
[1:26:09] amen
[1:26:12] fourth as a witness you go forth
[1:26:16] as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:26:18] brother and if you are a son and
[1:26:20] daughter of God you'll have the humility
[1:26:21] of God
[1:26:23] oh yes
[1:26:25] not arrogance brother if there's
[1:26:27] anything I believe the prophet of God
[1:26:29] had was humility
[1:26:30] he didn't he didn't go around to
[1:26:32] witnessing this witnessing that and I
[1:26:34] and I
[1:26:36] being as old as I am I remember the
[1:26:39] experience and testimonies of this
[1:26:41] preacher this preacher that preacher and
[1:26:43] they were you know World International
[1:26:45] preachers and so on and like I said most
[1:26:48] of them are gone now but
[1:26:51] they never had the humility that the
[1:26:52] prophet had
[1:26:54] no no
[1:26:56] they they went and oh yes they had this
[1:26:59] kind of ministry that kind of ministry
[1:27:00] and they were puffing up their names
[1:27:01] they're puffing up their Ministries amen
[1:27:04] they were getting the glory oh yes
[1:27:07] brother so and so and this brother this
[1:27:09] brother this this evangelist this
[1:27:11] evangelist that evangelist amen oh yeah
[1:27:14] and the whole world knew knew all these
[1:27:16] evangelists but who was William Branham
[1:27:19] amen he was God hidden and revealed in
[1:27:23] simplicity
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:26] the world was highlighting the other
[1:27:29] Avengers I won't mention their names
[1:27:30] well I could because most of them are
[1:27:33] gone on now oh yeah
[1:27:35] but but again back then they were oh
[1:27:38] yeah they wanted to they wanted to
[1:27:39] become famous to the world and their
[1:27:41] names were known around the world Amen
[1:27:44] and then not and none of them had the
[1:27:47] ministry like brother William Branham
[1:27:48] made none of them had had the
[1:27:50] discernment that would impranimate and
[1:27:52] could do what William random did no no
[1:27:55] but again they were they were
[1:27:57] highlighting their Ministries and again
[1:28:00] of course they were pressing on and get
[1:28:02] tried to get money as well but again
[1:28:05] William Branham didn't do that William
[1:28:07] Branham was in Simplicity he wasn't he
[1:28:09] wasn't there to show off his ministry he
[1:28:12] wasn't there to show off the gifts not
[1:28:14] by any means and neither did Jesus
[1:28:17] amen God help us brother
[1:28:19] because I tell you this even Jesus with
[1:28:21] his ministry we know that when he laid
[1:28:23] out the word the Bible says 70 of his
[1:28:26] disciples walked back and walk no more
[1:28:28] with him amen when brother Bradham began
[1:28:31] to get into the word the message of the
[1:28:33] revelations brother there's many that's
[1:28:35] that that's it they wouldn't have
[1:28:37] nothing to do with William Branham amen
[1:28:39] and and as we get more and more into the
[1:28:42] word there are believers even today
[1:28:44] that don't want anything to do with
[1:28:46] William Brown the message
[1:28:48] no
[1:28:49] I witnessed a lot that have come to the
[1:28:51] word and have moved away from the word
[1:28:53] over the last 40 years
[1:28:56] or 50 years yeah
[1:28:59] God help us
[1:29:02] to stay with the word
[1:29:05] God help us to stay with the message
[1:29:07] amen and when I say stay with it I don't
[1:29:10] mean that just the letter of it or or or
[1:29:13] the revelation of this doctrine that
[1:29:15] Doctrine but brother let's stay with
[1:29:17] what God's doing
[1:29:19] amen
[1:29:20] brother he's not
[1:29:22] God is Not does not wanting us to focus
[1:29:25] on Doctrine
[1:29:26] no no he wants us to focus on the
[1:29:29] resurrection and the rapture
[1:29:32] brother they're going to be there's
[1:29:33] going to be those that are left behind
[1:29:35] and they'll have a right Doctrine but
[1:29:37] they but they'll miss the resurrection
[1:29:39] and they'll miss the Rapture amen
[1:29:42] because they focused on the letter of
[1:29:44] the word not the spirit of the word
[1:29:46] amen and there are those that are
[1:29:48] focusing on the letter of the message
[1:29:49] but not the spirit of the message amen
[1:29:53] we could consider
[1:29:55] other messages that brother Benham had
[1:29:57] preached and they're focused on the
[1:29:58] title of it but what about the
[1:30:00] revelation of it
[1:30:02] oh the title of this message the title
[1:30:04] of that message brother you got to go
[1:30:07] beyond the title to the revelation
[1:30:11] just a couple of messages that I got
[1:30:13] here
[1:30:14] all right why Christ speak
[1:30:17] do you have the revelation
[1:30:19] or is it just just a thought
[1:30:22] oh the William Brown said this William
[1:30:24] said that and so on but brother do you
[1:30:27] have the faith that he was emphasizing
[1:30:29] amen or the message humble yourself
[1:30:33] amen
[1:30:36] fall
[1:30:37] there are those that would ignore these
[1:30:40] this message
[1:30:44] they'll maybe put more emphasis on what
[1:30:46] Christ speak or they'll put more
[1:30:48] emphasis on Christ The Mystery of God
[1:30:50] revealed then this then they'll ignore
[1:30:53] this humble you
[1:30:55] oh this is Christ The Mystery of God
[1:30:57] revealed and he'll and I like
[1:31:00] highlighted this I like that I like that
[1:31:03] and this Doctrine and that Doctrine or
[1:31:05] serpent seed and so on but what about
[1:31:07] this this message here
[1:31:09] humble yourself
[1:31:12] you can have you can have the doctrines
[1:31:13] but if you're not humble
[1:31:16] it won't do it all good
[1:31:20] for God to do what he wants to do in you
[1:31:22] with you through you you've got to be
[1:31:24] humble yourself
[1:31:26] God is bringing us to that through the
[1:31:28] message there's too many just caught up
[1:31:30] with the with the doctrines around the
[1:31:32] message but how many are caught up with
[1:31:34] the with the faith that God has given us
[1:31:38] in the resurrection and the rapture
[1:31:41] oh yes
[1:31:43] oh we have Christ The Mystery of God
[1:31:45] revealed thank God for that
[1:31:47] or
[1:31:48] this this Revelation this this message
[1:31:51] and that message and so on yes but
[1:31:55] you got that Faith but do you have
[1:31:57] resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:32:00] they're emphasis they're putting too
[1:32:02] much emphasis on just the letter of the
[1:32:03] word but not the spiritual revelation
[1:32:06] God help us
[1:32:08] amen
[1:32:10] let's focus on what God is doing
[1:32:13] not what he did what's he doing
[1:32:16] amen
[1:32:18] and brother
[1:32:20] if there's anything that God's doing
[1:32:21] right now oh my
[1:32:24] he's getting getting us more and more
[1:32:26] and more into a rapturing faith
[1:32:30] gideth more and more closer to Eternity
[1:32:33] and getting us less and less conscious
[1:32:36] of time
[1:32:37] more conscious of Eternity
[1:32:40] God help us
[1:32:43] how many Believers are more conscious of
[1:32:45] Eternity and less conscious of time
[1:32:48] there's too many still living for this
[1:32:50] world
[1:32:51] still living for the what what what the
[1:32:54] enemy is offering them in this world
[1:32:57] but how many are living for what God is
[1:32:59] offering in the world to come
[1:33:01] God help us
[1:33:03] brother because Martin Luther
[1:33:06] he was focusing on
[1:33:08] not this world but the world to come
[1:33:11] amen because Alleluia the justification
[1:33:15] that he preached was from time
[1:33:18] not time from time to Eternity
[1:33:22] amen
[1:33:24] sanctification
[1:33:26] eternity
[1:33:26] oh yeah the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:29] eternity it's God coming out of Eternity
[1:33:32] into time to change us and take us back
[1:33:36] to Eternity
[1:33:38] God help us
[1:33:41] let's brother let's not focus on the
[1:33:43] letter of the word the letter of the
[1:33:44] message because to do that we'll become
[1:33:46] more and more denominated
[1:33:49] like a denomination that's what they did
[1:33:51] down through the years what God did the
[1:33:55] spiritual revelation of his word they
[1:33:57] made it made a denomination out of it
[1:34:00] and brother there's many around the
[1:34:01] message are making denominations out of
[1:34:03] the different doctrines of the of the of
[1:34:05] the prophet
[1:34:08] God help us
[1:34:12] First Peter chapter 5.
[1:34:22] and verse
[1:34:24] 5.
[1:34:28] likewise you're younger
[1:34:30] submit yourselves unto the Elder
[1:34:32] yea all of you be subject one to another
[1:34:37] and be clothed with humility
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:41] humble yourself
[1:34:44] be clothed with humility for God
[1:34:47] resisted the proud
[1:34:49] and giveth Grace unto
[1:34:52] the humble
[1:34:54] amen
[1:34:57] and any thought that I wanted to leave
[1:34:59] with you tonight brother is humility
[1:35:01] is to encourage you to humble yourself
[1:35:04] Lord and brother sister if the if the
[1:35:07] word is going to have any influence in
[1:35:09] your life it's humility
[1:35:11] if the word is going to do anything to
[1:35:13] you the message doing anything to you
[1:35:15] it'll humble you
[1:35:16] if you really got it in your heart not
[1:35:19] in your head but in your heart you
[1:35:22] it'll humble you amen he's putting us
[1:35:26] down to get us to look up
[1:35:28] amen by the grace of God
[1:35:30] so brother the prophet of God
[1:35:34] highlighted humility
[1:35:37] and in 1963 he preached the message
[1:35:39] humble thyself
[1:35:41] amen
[1:35:47] he said in the message humble thyself
[1:35:51] he said I won't ask anybody to go
[1:35:53] anywhere
[1:35:54] he said that I don't go first
[1:35:57] he said to find out whether it's right
[1:35:59] or not I wouldn't ask any person to make
[1:36:02] a step
[1:36:04] he said he said in God that I hadn't
[1:36:07] already made and know that it's the
[1:36:09] truth
[1:36:10] amen first it must be the word of the
[1:36:13] Lord and then I inspect and see if it's
[1:36:17] right and then if it's right then I can
[1:36:20] say come on up this way see it's making
[1:36:24] the way
[1:36:25] and he said now I think any Minister
[1:36:29] ought to do that and ought to go first
[1:36:31] go himself
[1:36:33] he is supposed to be a leader
[1:36:35] of people
[1:36:37] not speak something that he wouldn't put
[1:36:39] his hand on himself he said we would go
[1:36:42] there leaders of the people
[1:36:45] but you got to include yourself
[1:36:48] subject to the word amen
[1:36:53] so he said now
[1:36:57] he said I think maybe next Sunday
[1:36:59] morning
[1:37:01] that we would have a healing service
[1:37:05] but I think he said with the message
[1:37:06] this morning he said the way the Lord
[1:37:09] seemed to lead me to bring it out
[1:37:12] ought to ever encourage us a little
[1:37:15] to really believe
[1:37:18] amen
[1:37:19] he said we play around
[1:37:22] we say different things we talk about
[1:37:24] them but then he said when it comes to a
[1:37:27] showdown there's something different
[1:37:29] amen he said it's different when you're
[1:37:33] included in it yourself amen when it
[1:37:36] comes to the word include yourself
[1:37:39] don't condemn everybody else put
[1:37:41] yourself there
[1:37:44] people are taking the word taking the
[1:37:45] message amen and they're applied to this
[1:37:48] one apply it to that one that one this
[1:37:50] and that and so on and they condemn but
[1:37:52] what about yourself
[1:37:54] brother if there's anyone that you gotta
[1:37:56] play the word to First is you
[1:37:59] amen you've got to line up to the word
[1:38:01] amen you've got to humble yourself to
[1:38:04] the truth it's not it's not trying to
[1:38:06] impersonate
[1:38:07] others and try to
[1:38:09] get them to humble yourself humble
[1:38:11] yourself brother what they're trying to
[1:38:13] do is get them to Humble to themselves
[1:38:16] amen but let them humble themselves to
[1:38:18] Jesus
[1:38:19] amen praise the Lord so that they're
[1:38:22] going to reflect Jesus
[1:38:24] amen not reflect the preacher

[1:39:36] that statement this morning he said the
[1:39:38] people was laid in the shadow of Peter
[1:39:40] and they never ever asked for prayer and
[1:39:44] he said I have witnessed into many homes
[1:39:48] and he said watching this
[1:39:50] pray before I go and just go in there
[1:39:52] with the anointing and don't even pray
[1:39:55] for the people and walk out and they are
[1:39:58] healed praise the Lord
[1:40:02] he wasn't looking for the give himself
[1:40:05] attention
[1:40:06] to give himself preeminence it was to
[1:40:08] give Jesus pre-evidence

[1:40:13] anointing was there and the people were
[1:40:15] healed I mean and he didn't pray for him

[1:40:19] went left and went out he said they were
[1:40:21] healed
[1:40:22] amen

[1:40:25] to William Branham or he prayed for me
[1:40:27] and I got healed no no he didn't pray
[1:40:30] it was the anointing of God that was
[1:40:32] with the prophet amen when he went in
[1:40:34] amen and the people there were believing
[1:40:37] and calling on the Lord and when the
[1:40:39] prophet turned around and went out they
[1:40:41] were healed

[1:40:44] Jesus not to William Brown
[1:40:47] amen
[1:40:50] sees it and don't even pray for the
[1:40:52] people and walk out and they are healed
[1:40:55] and he said I have seen it done so many
[1:40:57] times and he said you've got to have
[1:40:59] somewhere to place your faith and he
[1:41:01] said you've got to believe it and I
[1:41:03] believe that the hour is approaching and

[1:41:36] but it's got to be your faith
[1:41:40] amen
[1:41:41] the problem of God could go in and pray

[1:41:47] again
[1:41:48] he could come back on him

[1:42:53] amen the grace of God in you
[1:42:56] amen
[1:43:02] he said listen I think any Minister
[1:43:04] ought to do it he said ought to go first
[1:43:06] himself and he's supposed to be a leader
[1:43:09] of the people
[1:43:10] and not speak something that he wouldn't
[1:43:12] put his hand on himself he said we
[1:43:14] should go we should go there leaders of
[1:43:17] the people amen
[1:43:19] and what are you encouraging encouraging
[1:43:21] them to believe
[1:43:22] not believe you but to believe the word
[1:43:25] to believe Jesus
[1:43:29] and he said now I think he said maybe
[1:43:31] next Sunday morning if the Lord willing
[1:43:33] he said I'd like to have a healing
[1:43:36] service just dedicated only to healing
[1:43:38] and he said I think with the message
[1:43:40] this morning he said the Lord seemed to
[1:43:43] lead me to bring it to bring it out and
[1:43:46] he said he ought to kind of encourage us
[1:43:48] a little to really believe
[1:43:51] and he said we play around we say
[1:43:53] different things we talk about them but
[1:43:56] then when it comes to a showdown there's
[1:43:58] something that's something different
[1:44:01] amen God's going to bring you to The
[1:44:03] Showdown of your faith
[1:44:05] amen
[1:44:06] it's not
[1:44:08] oh well this this brother got got this
[1:44:11] gift and that brother got that gift and

[1:44:26] evangelists that went forth with with
[1:44:28] signs and wonders in in the 20th century
[1:44:30] amen and the people give give the glory
[1:44:33] to the preacher but not to Jesus

[1:45:18] says mighty good for us to say here amen
[1:45:21] is mighty good for us to say I believe
[1:45:23] that's true but he said then put it in
[1:45:26] action
[1:45:27] as I brought that statement this morning
[1:45:29] the people was laying in the shed
[1:45:32] yeah Lane in the shadow of Peter they
[1:45:35] never even asked for prayer and he said
[1:45:37] I went into many homes and he said
[1:45:40] watching this pray before I go and just
[1:45:43] go in there with the anointing and don't
[1:45:46] even pray for the people and walk out
[1:45:48] and they are healed see he said that's
[1:45:52] right I've seen it done so many times
[1:45:54] and you have got to have somewhere to
[1:45:56] place your faith you've got to believe
[1:45:59] it and I believe that the hour is
[1:46:01] approaching and now is You've Got to
[1:46:04] Believe
[1:46:05] amen
[1:46:06] oh brother if God is challenging
[1:46:09] anything it's our faith
[1:46:11] and brother
[1:46:12] back then the emphasis was on healing
[1:46:15] and signs and wonders but now it's on
[1:46:17] the resurrection and the rapture
[1:46:20] believeth thou this
[1:46:23] amen
[1:46:25] we're challenged like Mary and Martha
[1:46:28] concerning Lazarus you'll Rise Again
[1:46:31] believeth thou this
[1:46:33] amen oh yes you arise in the
[1:46:36] resurrection he said I am the
[1:46:37] resurrection Believers thou this
[1:46:40] they couldn't quite catch it
[1:46:43] amen
[1:46:44] grace of God
[1:46:47] brother do we believe now in the
[1:46:49] resurrection and the Rapture are we
[1:46:52] looking now for the resurrection and the
[1:46:54] Rapture are we hindering now more and
[1:46:56] more into the revelation of the
[1:46:58] resurrection and the Rapture what God
[1:47:00] not what God will do what God is doing
[1:47:05] God help us
[1:47:07] amen
[1:47:10] please in the name of Jesus let's focus
[1:47:13] on the rapture
[1:47:15] well
[1:47:18] today in grace are just there they're
[1:47:21] not by the way
[1:47:23] as I said
[1:47:25] there's so many focused on the
[1:47:27] cemeteries and they say oh there's so
[1:47:29] many people dead there they're not there
[1:47:31] I'm sorry
[1:47:33] they're not there no they're right here
[1:47:38] the dating Grace
[1:47:41] so many so many of us think they're
[1:47:42] still in the graveyard they're not
[1:47:46] that's the Bible says what was buried in
[1:47:48] the graveyard thus Thou Art not the thus
[1:47:50] shall thou return
[1:47:51] that goes back to the to the dust as it
[1:47:54] were
[1:47:54] but but that's fine
[1:47:56] during that during the resurrection
[1:47:58] they're going to come forth in a
[1:48:00] glorified body
[1:48:01] amen
[1:48:02] there's and the prophet of God said
[1:48:04] they're not two feet from yet any given
[1:48:06] time
[1:48:07] to date in Christ waiting on us
[1:48:11] to believe the resurrection and the
[1:48:13] rapture
[1:48:15] amen
[1:48:16] Lazarus didn't have to wait very long
[1:48:19] back then
[1:48:21] oh no Jesus came on the scene and his
[1:48:24] Lazarus come forth
[1:48:26] amen and he came forth
[1:48:30] are we going to call the dead in Christ
[1:48:32] to come forth from the dimension they're
[1:48:34] in
[1:48:36] they're waiting on us
[1:48:41] about sorry
[1:48:43] that
[1:48:47] there's not going to be many here
[1:48:49] living Saints for the rapture
[1:48:55] because it's even Jesus questioned when
[1:48:57] the son of man comes will he find faith
[1:49:00] on the Earth
[1:49:04] for the resurrection for the rapture
[1:49:10] do you have faith
[1:49:15] do you have faith do you believe God are
[1:49:18] you believing God on a daily basis
[1:49:20] are you believing God
[1:49:23] every hour
[1:49:25] because I tell you this brother in case
[1:49:27] we're living in the world getting to
[1:49:29] that place where we need Faith 24 7.
[1:49:34] we need faith not just when we're
[1:49:36] conscious even when we're unconscious
[1:49:37] even when we're asleep amen you go to
[1:49:40] sleep faith is in control
[1:49:43] you wake up Faith is in control amen
[1:49:46] through the day Faith is in control in
[1:49:49] your jobs faith is in control by the
[1:49:51] grace of God
[1:49:54] yes
[1:49:56] and you would most certainly need faith
[1:49:59] in this service tonight
[1:50:02] oh yeah
[1:50:06] if it's not Faith well not everybody but
[1:50:10] there's there's a few that wouldn't
[1:50:12] wouldn't even bother to come back
[1:50:14] if you never had the faith that please
[1:50:16] God
[1:50:18] Faith to believe the word
[1:50:21] Faith to believe that it's God speaking
[1:50:23] to you
[1:50:25] faith that is God encouraging you faith
[1:50:27] that is God giving you what you want and
[1:50:30] what you need
[1:50:31] amen what you need God's given you
[1:50:34] to give you the faith that please
[1:50:37] pleases God
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:40] brother there's so many that they'll
[1:50:43] come under the ministry they'll that'll
[1:50:45] preach this and give them this Faith
[1:50:46] give them that Faith give them that
[1:50:48] Faith but how many are coming under the
[1:50:50] ministry to give them the faith for the
[1:50:51] resurrection faith for the rapture
[1:50:54] because there's going to be so many left
[1:50:56] behind
[1:50:57] because the Bible is highlighted the
[1:50:59] fact that he said that there's going to
[1:51:01] be very few living Saints he said
[1:51:04] that'll go in the resurrection go in the
[1:51:06] rapture
[1:51:08] there won't be many left there he said
[1:51:10] on the Earth
[1:51:13] because more and more are getting just
[1:51:17] denominational
[1:51:19] around the message
[1:51:21] or they are I'm sorry
[1:51:24] but again I I should have maybe
[1:51:26] highlighted the quote and what the
[1:51:28] prophet of God was saying there's going
[1:51:30] to be so few living Saints on the earth
[1:51:33] at the time of the rapture
[1:51:40] and brother we're gathering together as
[1:51:42] Believers if our if our motive and
[1:51:44] objective is right we're Gathering
[1:51:46] Together on a Wednesday and a Sunday for
[1:51:48] the hearing of the word and The
[1:51:50] Fellowship of the Saints what for to to
[1:51:52] what for to build up our faith
[1:51:56] to strengthen our faith to encourage our
[1:51:58] faith in what in the not just the
[1:52:00] message of the hour or in this Doctrine
[1:52:02] and this Doctrine this doc no yes we
[1:52:05] thank God for that amen but what about
[1:52:08] the faith for the resurrection
[1:52:10] what about faith for the rapture
[1:52:14] what about faith to get out of time and
[1:52:16] into eternity
[1:52:19] God help us to be more conscious
[1:52:23] is
[1:52:27] the Resurrection The Rapture
[1:52:34] as I said there was a couple of times
[1:52:36] that I went to a in the into the mall
[1:52:38] and I was walking
[1:52:40] down the mall
[1:52:42] and then all of a sudden I
[1:52:44] I saw somebody
[1:52:48] I said who's that
[1:52:51] I said no it can't be them is it
[1:52:54] I thought it was
[1:52:56] a saint that I had known for years but
[1:52:59] had they had been gone for years
[1:53:03] I thought oh
[1:53:05] I better get up there closer and see see
[1:53:08] if it's there
[1:53:10] if it is it's the resurrection it it's
[1:53:12] the rapture
[1:53:13] oh yeah
[1:53:15] just a few times I've experienced that
[1:53:17] and I've seen people and thought and
[1:53:18] thought it was believers
[1:53:21] yeah that had gone on
[1:53:26] and one of these days we're going to see
[1:53:28] them
[1:53:29] they're going to appear to the living
[1:53:30] Saints amen
[1:53:33] and we're going to oh yeah but they're
[1:53:35] going to be younger
[1:53:36] they're going to be not going to be in
[1:53:37] the old bodies they went down in they're
[1:53:39] going to be in it yet they're going to
[1:53:41] be look young
[1:53:42] grace of God that will be in the spirit
[1:53:44] to recognize them
[1:53:46] amen
[1:53:48] God help us
[1:53:53] and I would encourage our younger
[1:53:55] generation here
[1:53:59] because I tell you it's going to be a
[1:54:01] greater and greater and greater
[1:54:02] challenge to their faith
[1:54:05] concerning what's going on in the world
[1:54:07] and concerning what the devil is doing
[1:54:09] to keep to keep their attention
[1:54:13] and to get us away from the word
[1:54:16] to focus mainly to all just religion
[1:54:19] no no
[1:54:21] there's too many religious people not
[1:54:23] not but are you spiritual
[1:54:26] don't be religious be spiritual
[1:54:29] amen
[1:54:31] utterly Satan Satan is there to make you
[1:54:34] religious
[1:54:36] but God is there to make you spiritual
[1:54:39] amen
[1:54:40] God help us
[1:54:46] he said listen he said this what I was
[1:54:49] speaking of this morning has brought us
[1:54:51] right to a climax and that's the reason
[1:54:54] that I'm going to take next Sunday
[1:54:57] and he said for a healing service and
[1:55:00] then this morning bringing it right up
[1:55:02] now to the last poll
[1:55:05] amen we are in the time of the third
[1:55:08] pull
[1:55:12] he said now it's my time for
[1:55:14] consecration to God and he said God's
[1:55:17] time to speak to me and he said I must
[1:55:20] just have a little change in my own life
[1:55:22] and he said I want to feel a little more
[1:55:24] closer to the people
[1:55:34] feeling more closer to
[1:55:36] our brothers and sisters in the word
[1:55:38] in the message
[1:55:41] if we got the Holy Ghost
[1:55:43] if we are the bride if we are
[1:55:46] predestinated under the resurrection
[1:55:47] unto the rapture
[1:55:49] the closer we get to the change we're
[1:55:51] going to feel closer to one another
[1:55:58] I asked
[1:56:00] God help us to have to have the right
[1:56:02] spirit and right attitude so that we can
[1:56:04] say oh that's my brother
[1:56:07] it is yes you're my brother
[1:56:10] you're my sister
[1:56:14] because we're moving away from the
[1:56:15] natural
[1:56:17] senses to the spiritual
[1:56:21] and spiritually naturally oh my natural
[1:56:24] brothers are out there my natural sister
[1:56:27] is out there
[1:56:28] different parts of the island maybe just
[1:56:30] different parts of the country
[1:56:33] but what about your spiritual brothers
[1:56:35] and sisters
[1:56:40] are they more close to you than your
[1:56:42] natural brothers and sisters
[1:56:53] a member of my family one time
[1:56:57] when we were visiting
[1:56:59] the hometown
[1:57:04] and we
[1:57:05] we would drive down through
[1:57:08] and we just dropped in to see certain
[1:57:10] family members
[1:57:12] and then we would go on
[1:57:14] to see our physical our spiritual
[1:57:17] brothers and sisters in the Lord
[1:57:22] and in visiting our natural family at
[1:57:24] one point there
[1:57:25] a member of the natural family
[1:57:27] absolutely rebuked me
[1:57:33] oh
[1:57:35] all you're interested in
[1:57:37] is so and so
[1:57:39] and they were my brothers and sisters in
[1:57:41] Christ
[1:57:44] and they said you won't do this you
[1:57:45] won't do that
[1:57:46] you just drop in to see us I said I drop
[1:57:49] you in to say hello and egregious
[1:57:52] God bless you
[1:57:54] and one other member of the family stood
[1:57:56] up to defend us
[1:57:59] and rebuke the other member and they
[1:58:01] said listen
[1:58:03] he's right
[1:58:06] that he's here to he's there to
[1:58:08] encourage us he's there he's there to
[1:58:10] bless us amen
[1:58:13] so that if other members said no don't
[1:58:15] don't take that attitude toward him
[1:58:17] that's not right
[1:58:18] and so on
[1:58:21] why because we are closer to our
[1:58:24] spiritual brothers and sisters
[1:58:26] than our natural
[1:58:28] that's the absolute truth
[1:58:31] brother the prophet of God himself
[1:58:35] highlighted to his own natural family
[1:58:38] is is physical Brothers
[1:58:41] when his when their mother died he said
[1:58:44] oh
[1:58:45] he said we're not going to see one
[1:58:47] another very much now
[1:58:49] he said we won't get together he said to
[1:58:51] see one another
[1:58:53] because they're because they used to get
[1:58:55] together but only to come visit their
[1:58:57] mother and when their mother died they
[1:58:59] said oh we won't get together now
[1:59:02] but
[1:59:03] brother Brown did highlight the fact
[1:59:05] that we get together with our spiritual
[1:59:07] brothers and sisters
[1:59:10] what's more important to you your
[1:59:12] natural family or your spiritual
[1:59:18] God challenge your faith

[1:59:50] because when it comes to the Natural
[1:59:51] this too shall pass away
[1:59:54] but the spiritual is eternal
[1:59:57] Guardians
[2:00:03] I pray God challenge your faith
[2:00:07] are you putting your emphasis on your
[2:00:08] natural family or on your spiritual

[2:00:51] this too should pass away
[2:00:54] God help us
[2:00:59] we are under the third pole
[2:01:01] of the ministry
[2:01:03] of the prophet
[2:01:05] it is finished
[2:01:07] it is finished
[2:01:11] remember
[2:01:12] Genesis the Book of Genesis brings us
[2:01:15] from
[2:01:16] eternity into time
[2:01:19] The Book of Revelation
[2:01:21] and what God's doing in the last days is
[2:01:24] taking us back from time back to
[2:01:26] Eternity
[2:01:28] amen
[2:01:29] by the grace of God
[2:01:32] Grace that God will help us to be more
[2:01:35] and more and more conscious of Eternity
[2:01:40] more and more conscious of the spiritual
[2:01:42] Sons and Daughters of God and less of
[2:01:45] the natural
[2:01:47] Grace
[2:01:50] he said now it's my time for
[2:01:52] consecration to God
[2:01:55] 's time he said to speak to me he said I
[2:01:58] must just have a little change in my own
[2:02:00] life we need a change in our lives to

[2:02:28] are still caught up with their natural
[2:02:30] family
[2:02:31] oh yeah oh I love my natural fat yeah
[2:02:34] but it's a natural love
[2:02:38] but with the spiritual family it's an
[2:02:40] eternal love
[2:02:41] amen is different absolutely different
[2:02:44] it is going to take preeminence over the
[2:02:46] natural

[2:02:51] the spiritual
[2:02:53] are you living for time or eternity

[2:03:13] air behind the pulpit that when you

[2:03:24] town or your old country or whatever and
[2:03:27] you feel you feel better there whatever
[2:03:29] well
[2:03:31] we're getting more and more spiritual
[2:03:32] conscious
[2:03:34] of our spiritual being
[2:03:36] we come from eternity and we want to get
[2:03:38] back to Eternity oh yeah we're hungry
[2:03:41] and thirsty I tell you the greater and
[2:03:43] greater revelation of the word the
[2:03:44] message of the hour is going to create
[2:03:46] in us a greater hunger and thirst for
[2:03:48] eternity
[2:03:49] amen
[2:03:51] oh yes
[2:03:52] brother that's that's why there was a
[2:03:55] Pentecostal Revival a Methodist Revival
[2:03:57] a Lutheran Revival amen because the Holy
[2:04:00] Spirit came and it created in their
[2:04:02] heart a hunger and a thirst amen for
[2:04:05] what God was doing in their lives
[2:04:08] and now he's created a hunger and a
[2:04:10] thirst in us but we thank God for
[2:04:12] justification we thank for God for
[2:04:15] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[2:04:17] Ghost the gifts of the Spirit but now
[2:04:19] he's creating in us a hunger and thirst
[2:04:21] for a glorified body
[2:04:24] a new Heaven and a new Earth
[2:04:28] amen
[2:04:30] previous generations oh Luther hunger
[2:04:32] than thirst for justification the
[2:04:34] Pentecostal is hunger and thirst for the
[2:04:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of
[2:04:38] the Spirit amen and other other revivals
[2:04:42] oh they were hungry and thirsty for this
[2:04:44] experience with God Amen
[2:04:46] but now
[2:04:49] we've been Justified we've been
[2:04:51] Sanctified we've been baptized with the
[2:04:53] Holy Ghost we have access to the gifts
[2:04:55] of the Spirit and God has blessed us
[2:04:57] with this with this with this now what's
[2:04:58] left is to go is to go home
[2:05:02] is to get back to Eternal let's let's go
[2:05:04] to heaven let's get out of here and
[2:05:07] let's get into the glory of God
[2:05:10] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[2:05:20] that's why the prophet of God
[2:05:25] when he stepped into the pulpit
[2:05:29] now he said I got to get myself out of
[2:05:31] the way
[2:05:32] he said I can't do this I can't do that
[2:05:34] so he got himself out of the way and the
[2:05:36] anointing and God took over
[2:05:39] brother we got to get ourselves
[2:05:41] naturally out of the way and let the
[2:05:43] spiritual revelation of who you are take
[2:05:45] over
[2:05:47] amen
[2:05:49] oh yes for God to do what he wanted to
[2:05:51] do through William Branham he had
[2:05:53] William random had to step aside and let
[2:05:55] God control
[2:06:03] brother if we want to experience the
[2:06:05] resurrection rapture
[2:06:07] we got to get go beyond the Natural Body
[2:06:10] and let the spirit the Holy Spirit
[2:06:12] control
[2:06:14] so we're not living according to our
[2:06:16] natural senses we're living according to
[2:06:18] our spiritual revelation
[2:06:26] he said now to me
[2:06:30] like it's an insult I don't care to me
[2:06:33] but to the things that I've been saying
[2:06:35] it's the truth
[2:06:37] he says trying to help them
[2:06:40] to me it feels like if they walk away
[2:06:43] there's more nothing more than I can do
[2:06:46] and he said but I want to run the bank
[2:06:48] down the bank now and persuade them come

[2:12:29] he's caught up with what God has done
[2:12:31] in William Brown's Ministry
[2:12:34] but I'm and they're caught up with what
[2:12:36] they think is going God is going to do
[2:12:38] but they're missing what God is doing

[2:12:52] The Rapture
[2:12:54] they won't be raptured
[2:12:56] they're going to be left behind
[2:12:59] amen remember there's going to be a
[2:13:01] generation
[2:13:02] after the resurrection after the Rapture
[2:13:05] there's going to be a generation they're
[2:13:06] going to see this and see that and
[2:13:08] they're going to say oh
[2:13:10] I thought there's to be a rapture
[2:13:14] where's the Rapture it already happened
[2:13:16] and they didn't know it
[2:13:23] I trust by grace
[2:13:25] that we are entering into the revelation
[2:13:27] of the Rapture now

[2:13:35] is trying to get us get our attention
[2:13:37] more and more and more on the
[2:13:39] resurrection and on the right

[2:14:01] believe that God is now revealing it to
[2:14:03] us God is getting us into the
[2:14:05] resurrection God is getting us into the
[2:14:07] Rapture and he's trying to increase
[2:14:08] increase our faith
[2:14:12] that's right when our faith climb access
[2:14:15] the resurrection will climax
[2:14:17] the Rapture of climax and we're going to
[2:14:20] be caught out of time and into eternity
[2:14:27] yes
[2:14:30] God knows when he'll climax
[2:14:33] and God will keep working on you and
[2:14:35] you'll keep working on me with the word
[2:14:37] to keep what
[2:14:39] to delay in the word delay in the
[2:14:41] Revelation to keep us
[2:14:43] meditating
[2:14:44] on the resurrection
[2:14:46] to keep us meditating on the Rapture
[2:14:48] Amen brother if there's anything if God
[2:14:52] is going to do anything I'll tell you
[2:14:54] this the anointing and moving of the
[2:14:55] spirit is going to keep us conscious of
[2:14:57] what God is doing and what God
[2:15:01] will do
[2:15:05] don't ignore it and say Well when the
[2:15:08] Rapture goes on I'll go
[2:15:10] when this happens all my brother God is
[2:15:12] revealing to us
[2:15:14] and we'll reveal to us when that when
[2:15:17] it's going to happen
[2:15:25] don't ignore it
[2:15:30] amen
[2:15:36] as I said again he said don't forget
[2:15:38] this
[2:15:40] chat this Tabernacle will lose its
[2:15:43] strength
[2:15:45] and he said that this is the target
[2:15:47] where Satan has got every gun in Hell
[2:15:49] trained on it and he'll cause one person
[2:15:52] to do something that's contrary to what
[2:15:54] the other one thinks
[2:15:56] and he said he is doing that he is up to
[2:15:59] it that's his business if he can get
[2:16:02] somebody to say something somebody to
[2:16:04] talk about another
[2:16:05] and say well listen did you know so and
[2:16:08] so
[2:16:09] don't you listen to it
[2:16:11] he said don't you listen to it at all he
[2:16:15] said that's the devil
[2:16:16] he said don't you believe it
[2:16:19] he said if there's anything that
[2:16:20] somebody has done wrong pray for them
[2:16:23] amen and don't pray in a selfish way
[2:16:28] and say I know it's my duty I've got to
[2:16:31] pray for that brother you take it to
[2:16:33] your heart and really down and pray for
[2:16:35] that sister and you talk and be real
[2:16:37] sweet and the first thing you know you
[2:16:40] find them right back in the service
[2:16:41] again
[2:16:42] he said because all after all we are
[2:16:45] headed towards the setting of the Sun
[2:16:48] amen
[2:16:50] the Lord Jesus will be coming one of
[2:16:52] these days and you know I think it'll be
[2:16:55] so sudden so sweet until there be one
[2:16:58] hundredth of one percent of the whole
[2:17:01] world will never know when that Rapture
[2:17:04] takes place
[2:17:05] he said it'll just go go so quietly that
[2:17:08] nobody would know nothing about it
[2:17:13] God help us to be more and more
[2:17:16] spiritual
[2:17:17] more and more conscious of what God is
[2:17:19] doing
[2:17:21] not just what he did on thinking what he
[2:17:24] will do but what is God doing
[2:17:27] Lord I believe that you're you're in us
[2:17:29] now and you're you're making the the
[2:17:32] revelation of the Resurrection Rapture
[2:17:34] more and more real to us Lord help us

[2:17:52] somebody has done wrong pray for them

[2:18:19] be here during that time I don't want to
[2:18:22] be here in the tribulation

[2:18:27] come forth with his book of redemption
[2:18:30] and the bride has been taken out and

[2:18:35] through a tribulation period both Jew
[2:18:37] and Gentile what a time of tribulation

[2:18:44] there in the tribulation and the bride

[2:19:46] going over and he said the great time of
[2:19:49] redemption is at end he said just keep
[2:19:52] praying keep digging
[2:19:55] he said don't stop
[2:19:57] he said just like when Elijah told them
[2:19:59] he said dig ditches out there and he
[2:20:02] said when you get down and hear an old
[2:20:04] tin can and say I am too tired he said
[2:20:07] throw it out of the way and keep digging
[2:20:09] amen
[2:20:11] he's because he said we got to dig
[2:20:14] amen and he said if you expect the mid
[2:20:17] to expect to miss the tribulation he
[2:20:19] said you better start digging
[2:20:22] amen now he said for myself I'm
[2:20:25] preaching to myself there I'm going to
[2:20:28] start digging deeper than I have ever

[2:22:01] resurrection is right here
[2:22:03] directions right here we're coming home
[2:22:05] Lord
[2:22:07] God help us to believe it
[2:22:20] he said you show me a church that's
[2:22:22] humble
[2:22:25] you show me a church he said that's real
[2:22:27] humble
[2:22:29] not arrogancy he said a church just a
[2:22:32] sweet Humble Church and I'll show you a
[2:22:36] church that has the favor and the power
[2:22:38] of God in it
[2:22:40] amen
[2:22:46] you're going to go to a messy Church
[2:22:48] you want to know if God is in that
[2:22:50] church
[2:22:55] see if you can
[2:22:56] experience the humility
[2:22:59] and the humbleness of that church does
[2:23:02] it have a humble
[2:23:05] spirit
[2:23:08] amen
[2:23:11] I'll show you a church that has the
[2:23:13] favor and the power of God he said
[2:23:16] that's right and the thing it takes
[2:23:18] humility
[2:23:20] humbling ourselves before God and
[2:23:22] letting God just work through us he said
[2:23:25] don't have to make a lot of noise just
[2:23:28] believe
[2:23:29] amen just believe
[2:23:33] Grace
[2:23:35] he said above all things it's our
[2:23:38] individual Souls that we are responsible
[2:23:40] before God and he says you going to
[2:23:43] heaven amen
[2:23:47] and he says you have got to look this
[2:23:49] out and come sweet before the Lord
[2:23:53] and I've always found out that the man
[2:23:55] that humbles himself is the man that God
[2:23:58] exalts
[2:24:00] the man that humbles himself God raises
[2:24:02] up
[2:24:03] amen when you take a person with his
[2:24:07] chest out and knows everything and you
[2:24:10] can't tell him nothing
[2:24:12] and he is arrogant and he said that's
[2:24:15] the person that never gets anywhere
[2:24:18] but he said you take that person that
[2:24:20] humbles himself
[2:24:22] and walks sweetly
[2:24:25] amen he's the one that's going
[2:24:29] with the Lord
[2:24:30] amen praise the name of the Lord
[2:24:33] Hallelujah
[2:24:38] bear with me
[2:24:42] he said now surely
[2:24:45] he said though I understand all the
[2:24:46] mysteries of God
[2:24:48] and still though I could do it and have
[2:24:50] not charity I am nothing
[2:24:54] and we know that charity is divine love
[2:25:01] do you have Divine love for your
[2:25:03] brothers and sisters in Christ
[2:25:10] so the main thing is love God and humble
[2:25:13] yourself with it
[2:25:16] if you got the love of God you'll humble
[2:25:18] yourself
[2:25:20] now surely after all these years on the
[2:25:23] field and around the world and seeing
[2:25:25] different people I ought to know a
[2:25:27] little a bit about the gate to enter in
[2:25:30] and if you want to get somewhere with
[2:25:33] God never let an arrogant Spirit ever
[2:25:35] come around you
[2:25:37] he said don't let No Malice come in no
[2:25:40] matter what anybody does if they are
[2:25:43] wrong don't you never build up a complex
[2:25:46] against that person
[2:25:49] keep your spirit right and your attitude
[2:25:51] right
[2:25:53] stay humble and stay sincere
[2:25:56] amen
[2:26:01] he said you'll be sweet and kind and he
[2:26:04] said remember God loves you when you
[2:26:07] were in sin and if the spirit of God is
[2:26:09] in you you love the other person when he
[2:26:12] is wrong
[2:26:13] just pray for them and love one another
[2:26:16] and above everything love God and love
[2:26:20] one another and be humble with God and
[2:26:24] around one another be humble
[2:26:30] he says usually when a church begins to
[2:26:33] get in numbers and he said get to it
[2:26:36] getting a little bigger or something
[2:26:37] like that he said then they'll get away
[2:26:40] from that real thing the real thing
[2:26:43] what is it
[2:26:45] is intellectual they got the knowledge
[2:26:48] of the word the knowledge of the message
[2:26:49] but not the spirit
[2:26:54] they got religion but not the Holy Ghost
[2:26:57] there's too many religious people but
[2:27:00] not spiritual
[2:27:02] God help us
[2:27:05] possess the devil
[2:27:07] oh yeah
[2:27:09] God gives the word
[2:27:11] and by the word the pure word you become
[2:27:14] spiritual
[2:27:15] amen
[2:27:17] Holy Spirit spiritual
[2:27:19] but the enemy gets in amen
[2:27:22] oh my brother sister the enemy is there
[2:27:25] but he's there he's there to make you
[2:27:27] religious but not spiritual
[2:27:30] amen
[2:27:39] again
[2:27:44] let's see where the quote was
[2:27:52] saved
[2:27:56] I've always found out that the man that
[2:27:58] humbles himself is the man that God
[2:28:00] exalts
[2:28:05] you take that person that humbles
[2:28:07] himself and walks sweetly
[2:28:11] amen I pray God that we have that
[2:28:13] anointing
[2:28:15] to walk sweetly
[2:28:20] we read this quote again
[2:28:23] soon bring it to a conclusion
[2:28:25] he said above everything love God love
[2:28:27] one another and be humble with God and
[2:28:30] around one another be humble usually
[2:28:33] when a church begins to get in numbers
[2:28:35] and to get get to getting a little
[2:28:38] bigger or something like that and they
[2:28:40] get a they get away from the real thing
[2:28:43] amen
[2:28:45] now he said remember he said that's the
[2:28:47] Lord
[2:28:48] that's what this church was established
[2:28:50] upon he said Godly brotherly love for
[2:28:54] one another
[2:28:55] he said I can't even shake hands with
[2:28:57] one another
[2:28:58] he said and cried like babies to leave
[2:29:01] one another
[2:29:02] he said but they loved one another
[2:29:05] well
[2:29:06] amen
[2:29:08] now I said we're keeping time that the
[2:29:10] people will go will come by if you want
[2:29:12] to see a church that's really really
[2:29:15] humble
[2:29:16] a church that really loves God dropping
[2:29:19] up here up there at that Tabernacle and
[2:29:22] he said watch it look at the care they
[2:29:25] have for one another and the respect
[2:29:28] and when the gospel is being preached
[2:29:31] irreverent and how everything is just in
[2:29:34] order
[2:29:35] amen yes
[2:29:37] then they can look and see what time we
[2:29:40] are living you'll see the spirit of God
[2:29:42] moving among you great signs and wonders
[2:29:44] and things will be taking place and if
[2:29:47] the thing is working together
[2:29:49] it's telling the time but if it isn't
[2:29:51] working then it the time it stopped
[2:29:55] so if we want to know what time we're
[2:29:57] living just start everybody working
[2:30:00] together in the gospel loving one
[2:30:02] another loving God and the hands itself
[2:30:05] will tell the time that we are living
[2:30:08] he said do you believe that
[2:30:10] amen he said the Lord richly bless you
[2:30:13] if there's anything that God
[2:30:16] not necessarily requiring but anything
[2:30:18] that God's expecting in his seed is
[2:30:20] humility
[2:30:22] brother they humble themselves to the
[2:30:25] revelation of God they humble themselves
[2:30:27] to the revelation of what God has done
[2:30:29] yes and what God is doing
[2:30:33] and you humble yourself to the
[2:30:34] revelation of what God will do
[2:30:37] so brother
[2:30:39] through the ministry of the hour Malachi
[2:30:41] 4 and the message of the Prophet God has
[2:30:43] given us the revelation of what amen of
[2:30:46] what God has done what God is doing and
[2:30:49] what God will do
[2:30:51] amen
[2:30:54] God's not leaving it to you
[2:30:56] to figure it out he's leaving it to you
[2:30:59] to hear it and to believe it
[2:31:02] amen
[2:31:03] the messenger is as as
[2:31:06] spoke the word
[2:31:08] and the word has been revealed by the
[2:31:10] Holy Ghost
[2:31:12] in this day in this age in this hour
[2:31:14] what God has done what God is doing and
[2:31:19] what God will do
[2:31:21] amen
[2:31:26] is there is there a church somewhere
[2:31:28] else is there another church is there is
[2:31:30] there a denomination out there somewhere
[2:31:32] that's preaching what God has done what
[2:31:34] God is doing and what God will do most
[2:31:38] they are focusing on what God has done
[2:31:42] through history
[2:31:44] and they and they're putting the people
[2:31:46] to oh well God's going to do this God's
[2:31:48] going to do that but they're ignoring
[2:31:50] what God is doing
[2:31:54] amen that's why they're going to miss
[2:31:55] the resurrection and they're going to
[2:31:57] miss the rapture

[2:32:02] God is doing

[2:32:50] churches there tonight

[2:33:01] thousands of churches around the world
