[33:57] provision Lord we're thankful for your
[33:59] blessing and Lord we're thankful for
[34:02] your word Lord we're thankful for your
[34:03] spirit that quickens it to us Lord that
[34:05] Lord makes us live it Lord that draws it
[34:08] out of us Lord that that makes us a
[34:10] Fountain of Living Water Lord that even
[34:12] others could drink from heavenly father
[34:14] and Lord we're here to Lord just have
[34:16] you speak to us once again this morning
[34:18] Lord that you would encourage us along
[34:20] life's path Lord that you'd straighten
[34:22] us out where we need it Lord Minister
[34:24] into our lives Lord may we just open
[34:26] every door every window this morning
[34:28] Lord may we let the light of your word
[34:30] just shine everywhere we are Lord may we
[34:33] be well encouraged this morning Lord we
[34:35] pray Lord bless us each one Lord those
[34:37] that are online those that couldn't be
[34:39] here Lord we pray you're ministering
[34:40] Grace to them each one
[34:42] Lord just praying that you'd have your
[34:43] will and your way with us now in Jesus
[34:45] Christ's name we ask it amen
[34:48] unless you turn if you would to Isaiah
[34:51] chapter 42 Isaiah 42.
[34:54] and then we welcome our brother Emmanuel
[34:55] all the way from Zimbabwe amen God bless
[34:59] you brother it's good to have you
[35:00] amongst us for as long as you'll be with
[35:01] us trusting that you'll be blessed and
[35:03] you'll be a blessing amen
[35:05] amen Isaiah 42.
[35:09] verse 16 and I'm gonna maybe be a bit
[35:11] more pastoral this morning and this was
[35:13] just a thought that came to me when I
[35:15] was coming back from the wedding in
[35:16] central Newfoundland and popped into my
[35:18] head and I've learned to listen to those
[35:20] things that pop into my head amen I
[35:22] believe it's the Lord that leads and so
[35:23] I just want to want to minister on on
[35:26] something this morning that's maybe a
[35:28] little different than what I had planned
[35:29] I mean Isaiah 42 16 says this it says
[35:32] and I will bring the Blind by the way
[35:34] that they knew not I will lead them in
[35:37] past that they have not known I will
[35:39] make Darkness light before them and
[35:41] crooked things straight these things
[35:43] will I do unto them and not forsake them
[35:46] amen God bless you you may have your
[35:48] seats this morning and I want to take a
[35:50] title this morning of the broken road
[35:52] and I'm here to encourage you and
[35:54] strengthen you here this morning like I
[35:55] said a bit pastoral perhaps but we're
[35:57] not going to be preaching deep thoughts
[35:59] or deep Mysteries this morning but I'm
[36:00] going to preach to us perhaps where
[36:02] we're maybe at this morning and you know
[36:04] we we're going to talk about a number of
[36:06] different people in the scriptures this
[36:07] morning and I can find myself in in more
[36:10] than one of them in different times
[36:11] whether it's past or or present and I'm
[36:14] sure you will too but I want us to see
[36:16] that as children of God we're all coming
[36:19] from the same
[36:20] material but we don't all go through the
[36:23] same process to get us to the Finish
[36:25] Line amen the way our lives are ordered
[36:26] the way that God structures things the
[36:28] way that God brings singed into our life
[36:30] the way he takes things out of our life
[36:31] all of these different things in our
[36:33] lives have a purpose and they have a
[36:34] reason behind it and it's God's Great
[36:36] Orchestra that's playing out as God's
[36:38] great plan that's that's doing these
[36:40] things you know and and even in this
[36:42] even in this this sermon as I was just
[36:45] dwelling on this thought you know it
[36:46] came through Fellowship
[36:48] and I found that with Fellowship comes
[36:50] Clarity with with Fellowship the things
[36:52] of God seem to crystallize that they
[36:53] seem to solidify in our lives and that's
[36:55] why we spend time with Believers it's
[36:57] why we have people out it's why we go to
[36:59] church it's why we do things with our
[37:01] young people so that the things that
[37:02] God's doing and his words start to
[37:04] solidify in our in our minds and in our
[37:06] hearts and in our souls and we can start
[37:08] to maybe understand a bit better what
[37:09] God's doing in our lives sometimes we
[37:11] get caught up in a little bubble of our
[37:13] own thinking of our own way of doing
[37:14] things and and what happens is Satan
[37:17] combined us there because we don't see
[37:18] the bigger picture and sometimes it
[37:20] takes a bit of Fellowship sometimes it
[37:22] takes a bit of preaching sometimes it
[37:23] takes somebody else that's been through
[37:25] it before to tell you this is where
[37:26] you're at and what you're thinking is
[37:28] the end is not the end that the thing
[37:30] you you think is going bad here is
[37:31] actually going to work out for your good
[37:33] and God's got a plan and a purpose in
[37:35] these things and and even in this the
[37:37] thought came to me how that our
[37:39] circumstances don't Define us
[37:42] as in where we find ourselves today
[37:44] where we were found ourselves yesterday
[37:45] where we were born the family we came
[37:47] into the church we came into the country
[37:49] we were born into the color of our skin
[37:51] even the very religion or lack thereof
[37:53] is not what defines us amen but what
[37:55] defines us as something that started way
[37:57] before circumstances came into being and
[38:00] that was in the mind of God and in the
[38:01] thought of God and in the purpose and
[38:03] plan of God Amen so these things at
[38:05] these circumstances that we go through
[38:07] are not what Define me eternally
[38:09] what defines me eternally is what I was
[38:11] in the great mind of God in the
[38:12] beginning and where he's taken me in the
[38:14] end but in between there's going to be
[38:16] things that don't look very much like
[38:17] God and they don't look very much like a
[38:19] Christian walk perhaps even as we'll see
[38:21] amen and we have people that come from
[38:23] very different situations even myself
[38:25] standing here as a minister I didn't
[38:27] have the benefit maybe of brother Matt
[38:29] or brother Joshua that were born in a
[38:31] fully believing home and their father
[38:33] stayed in their home I didn't have that
[38:35] opportunity so I come from a broken road
[38:38] if I can put it that way I don't have
[38:39] the same opportunity but yet here God
[38:41] has done something with me through that
[38:43] broken road amen through those those
[38:45] failed circumstances through the Frailty
[38:47] of humanity through failed marriage and
[38:49] relationships and these different things
[38:50] and some of us come from church
[38:52] backgrounds where we've had failed
[38:54] pastors and failed Ministries and we've
[38:56] had Unfaithful people there that that
[38:58] serve God for so long and then a certain
[39:00] Doctrine comes out or a certain
[39:01] knowledge comes out and they just leave
[39:03] the Lord or they leave the church or
[39:05] they leave our fellowship in these
[39:06] different things and it can hurt us
[39:09] and we can say where is God in this how
[39:11] can this be God working in my life but I
[39:13] want you to understand that children of
[39:16] God always have God working in their
[39:18] life even when they don't realize it
[39:19] amen God's working out something for our
[39:22] good amen the reason I say this is that
[39:24] our circumstances are not what make us
[39:26] Believers we are believers because we
[39:28] believe not because we control
[39:29] circumstances or because circumstances
[39:32] are always going to be perfect or
[39:33] exactly the way that we think it should
[39:35] be I mean you look even at Esau and
[39:37] Jacob came from the exact same home the
[39:40] exact same environment they say today
[39:42] you know environment is what determines
[39:43] what a child will be well let me tell
[39:45] you the scripture denies that because
[39:46] Esau and Jacob came from a believing
[39:48] home out of the lineage of the father of
[39:50] our faith Abraham and one was accepted
[39:53] by God and one was rejected by God and
[39:55] in the beginning the one that was
[39:56] accepted by God looked like he should
[39:58] have been rejected
[39:59] amen so the way that God works is way
[40:02] past our understanding amen so I'm in
[40:04] trying to encourage you this morning as
[40:06] we get into this don't worry about the
[40:09] road
[40:10] don't worry about the potholes don't
[40:12] worry about the bumps don't worry about
[40:13] the curves don't worry about when it
[40:15] looks like you're going away just trust
[40:18] that as a child of God he's going to
[40:20] take you through amen trust that all
[40:22] right because our human nature is so
[40:24] often to dwell on the negative
[40:26] that's where the news is gone that's
[40:27] where people have gone it seems like in
[40:30] the past 15 or 20 years especially is
[40:31] that everything dwells on the negative
[40:33] and it's not going right and I can't see
[40:35] God in it and why am I like this and why
[40:37] is this not happening and and we end up
[40:39] with a lot of questions and doubts and
[40:41] it has a hard time now bringing for
[40:42] Faith out of doubts because it's based
[40:44] on what fear it's not based on the word
[40:47] of God and so we get into these places
[40:49] where we're Bound by the circumstances
[40:51] rather than Bound by the word promise
[40:53] that says I'll never leave you nor
[40:54] forsake you amen that I'm going to get
[40:56] you across the finish line
[40:58] I want to take us into the scriptures
[41:00] this morning because I want to show you
[41:02] that the road you walk will not be
[41:04] perfect
[41:06] even though it may be perfect in God's
[41:08] eyes in our human nature in the way of
[41:10] looking things it's not going to look
[41:12] perfect and you're going to have
[41:13] interludes in your life you're going to
[41:14] have periods in your life and you're
[41:16] going to say this isn't perfect this
[41:18] isn't even right and yet God is in it
[41:20] amen
[41:22] we have we're taking the wall stickers
[41:24] out for for some for to chance Cove the
[41:26] other day for a hike and brother Blair
[41:28] was saying all your roads here are so
[41:29] great brother John you've got this big
[41:30] double lane two-way Highway you know and
[41:32] and the roads are so great I said
[41:34] brother wait till we get on the side
[41:35] roads
[41:36] because they put all the money into the
[41:38] main roads but you get into the side
[41:39] roads towards chance Cove and my wife's
[41:41] back there saying you can really feel
[41:42] this road from the back seats you know
[41:44] all the way through why it's a side road
[41:47] they don't maintain it the same way they
[41:48] don't have the money to do it so they do
[41:50] all the main thoroughfares the main
[41:51] highways the main roads and they leave
[41:53] the side ones there but it's a joy to
[41:55] drive on the smoothly newly paved newly
[41:57] painted Highway isn't it we love to ride
[41:59] on those
[42:00] but sometimes God's got to take us down
[42:01] a side road doesn't he and it starts to
[42:03] get bumpy and we say how can this be God
[42:05] this doesn't feel right this uh this
[42:07] doesn't feel like an overcoming life
[42:10] doesn't feel like God's here but yet
[42:13] it's God in all of it amen
[42:14] if life was a road and it is a road
[42:17] we'd look backwards and say it hasn't
[42:19] been perfect
[42:20] if it hasn't been perfect why do we
[42:22] expect it to be perfect moving forward
[42:23] in our own eyes in our own way of
[42:25] thinking amen we have this expectation
[42:27] that God is somehow gonna make
[42:28] everything perfect while we're in it
[42:31] rather than the end goal is perfection
[42:33] amen he works all things for our good he
[42:36] didn't say all things were good he says
[42:39] he'll work them for our Goods so whether
[42:40] we get into his permissive will or his
[42:42] perfect will it's often going to look
[42:44] very much the same in that it's not
[42:46] always going to be easy it's not always
[42:47] going to be something that just happens
[42:49] you know when when we were living in
[42:51] Texas we drove all the way to California
[42:52] one time and let me tell you Texas is
[42:55] not all beautiful
[42:56] I don't know if you've ever been to
[42:58] Texas parts of Texas are beautiful but
[43:00] Texas is so big you can't drive through
[43:02] it in a day
[43:03] and so we were driving and we were
[43:05] driving and we were driving and near the
[43:06] end of the first day I think we stopped
[43:08] in El Paso which is actually starting to
[43:10] look pretty nice but we had to go
[43:11] through What's called the Permian Basin
[43:13] and this is called the armpit of Texas
[43:16] there's nothing attractive about an
[43:18] armpit I don't know if you've looked at
[43:19] an armpit recently there's nothing
[43:20] attractive about it there's nothing good
[43:22] about it
[43:23] this is the armpit of Texas and all it
[43:25] was was tumbleweeds and regular weeds
[43:28] and sand and dust and dirt and oil well
[43:31] sites that's it hot Dusty dry but yet
[43:36] that was a part of the way I had to go
[43:38] to get to my destination
[43:40] it wasn't all beautiful you get to
[43:41] California and you're like this is
[43:43] amazing this is beautiful you get into
[43:45] maybe portions of arizonian oh you just
[43:47] love the red rocks and these different
[43:48] things but going through the armpit of
[43:50] Texas was a part of the journey to go to
[43:52] beautiful California and we had to drive
[43:54] through and we had to accept it as a
[43:56] party amen I'm here to tell you that
[43:58] there are parts of your life that aren't
[43:59] going to look pretty but they are a part
[44:01] of your god-given god-ordained journey
[44:04] to get you to the beautiful land that
[44:06] awaits us Beyond amen you're in good
[44:08] company if your life's not pretty in
[44:10] terms of the road that you're on Amen
[44:12] it's not where you've been so much that
[44:14] matters it's are you going where you're
[44:15] supposed to be going amen Don't Look
[44:17] Behind look forward and say am I going
[44:19] where he wants me to be sometimes you
[44:21] know we look at our lives and and we can
[44:23] say I learned without having to
[44:25] experience
[44:26] you know it's like that story of the of
[44:28] the the man who had a stock pen and it
[44:31] had an electrified fence and his
[44:33] daughter went to touch and he said don't
[44:35] touch the fence it'll hurt you
[44:38] now she had a choice she could learn by
[44:40] obedience or she could learn by
[44:41] experience
[44:43] but she didn't choose to learn by
[44:44] obedience and so when she wasn't lucky
[44:45] he wasn't looking she went she touched
[44:47] the fence and it zapped her it
[44:48] electrocuted her it hurt her and she
[44:50] started crying and he came over and he
[44:52] said I told you not to touch the fence I
[44:54] wasn't trying to keep you from
[44:55] experiencing something good I was trying
[44:57] to keep you from being in a painful
[44:59] experience
[45:00] and so you know what happened when her
[45:02] brother came up
[45:03] and he went to touch the fence do you
[45:05] know what she said don't touch the fence
[45:08] why
[45:10] she'd experienced the pain
[45:12] some of us learn quickly and easily some
[45:15] of us learn the hard way
[45:16] but we learn one way or the other amen
[45:19] sometimes you know we look at our life
[45:20] and you know some of us have to learn
[45:22] you have to save a bit from every
[45:23] paycheck
[45:25] why because dad taught it mom taught it
[45:27] and so we've done it ever since and so
[45:29] when that that Financial bump hits where
[45:31] you have a major event you have a
[45:33] catastrophe you have a water heater go
[45:35] out your your shingles need to be
[45:36] replaced and you got to come up with ten
[45:38] thousand dollars what is it you've got
[45:39] it in the bank because you learn by
[45:41] obedience and so that portion of your
[45:43] road is just a small pothole
[45:45] you don't even notice it because you
[45:47] were prepared by simple obedience
[45:49] or maybe you're like the rest of us and
[45:51] we don't do that and so all of a sudden
[45:53] you've got to go into debt for ten
[45:54] thousand dollars and you don't know
[45:55] where you're going to get that money or
[45:56] how you're going to pay it off and so
[45:58] you have this massive pothole this rough
[46:00] stretch of road because what you didn't
[46:02] learn by obedience you had to learn by
[46:04] experience
[46:05] but if you can learn from the rough time
[46:07] as you step up hopefully you take that
[46:10] lesson and you start putting money away
[46:11] and the next time your water heater goes
[46:13] out you just write a check and you move
[46:14] on and it doesn't even slow you down
[46:16] it's not even an experience
[46:19] it's just something that you deal with
[46:20] on a day-to-day basis
[46:22] and then sometimes we have this vision
[46:23] of a of a perfect Road and we're going
[46:26] to use some graphs this morning
[46:28] and just to make understanding so we've
[46:30] got the green above which is what we
[46:31] would call good
[46:32] good times good decisions whatever it
[46:34] will be in below we have the bad in red
[46:36] and we look at this idea of the perfect
[46:38] Road of a Believer and they're born into
[46:40] a good home they're born into a
[46:41] believing home and they become a
[46:43] Christian they they get baptized they
[46:45] accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their
[46:47] savior they've receive the Holy Ghost
[46:48] they moved through their education they
[46:50] get a job then they they perhaps marry
[46:53] and have a family then after that
[46:55] perhaps they find a greater Kingdom
[46:56] Purpose a Ministry of some sort whether
[46:58] it's it's preaching or singing or deep
[47:00] whatever it might be
[47:02] and then they serve in those things very
[47:04] Faithfully until they pass on to the
[47:06] other side and we say that is the
[47:08] perfect Road of the believer
[47:10] well that's what we would like to happen
[47:12] but God doesn't raise us like that
[47:15] God doesn't teach us like that amen he's
[47:17] got to put certain experiences into our
[47:19] life but I want to look at a few people
[47:21] in scriptures this morning hopefully we
[47:22] can find our place in these different
[47:24] things because as we go on these
[47:26] scriptures and look at the roads of many
[47:27] great believers
[47:30] men and women that were types of Christ
[47:32] even
[47:33] and you look at the road they're on and
[47:35] you'll see it looks nothing like this
[47:37] this constant trajectory towards
[47:39] eternity that we would like to think
[47:40] that this is going to look like
[47:42] and then sometimes it's easy to look at
[47:44] at because we don't look at ourselves we
[47:46] look at other people and we say why does
[47:48] brother Mark keep making that same
[47:50] decision time and time again why won't
[47:52] he learn
[47:56] maybe you look at brother John and say
[47:57] brother John why don't you why can't you
[48:00] see this in yourself
[48:02] and you can look at it and you say
[48:03] that's going to hurt you and that's
[48:04] going to lead you down a bad Road and
[48:06] it's going to cause pain and it's going
[48:07] to cause issues and these different
[48:09] things and it's very easy to get caught
[48:11] up in that and I'm not here to say don't
[48:12] be concerned but I am here to say God is
[48:16] responsible for his children
[48:18] I'm not responsible for you and you're
[48:19] not responsible for me in the big
[48:21] picture
[48:22] but we ought to encourage each other we
[48:24] ought to be able to correct each other
[48:25] we ought to be able to Fellowship on the
[48:27] things of God but in the end you don't
[48:30] answer to me and I don't answer to you
[48:31] for my walk Christ answers for us and
[48:34] then he's the one that has us engraved
[48:36] in the palm of his hands he said I won't
[48:38] lose the one of them I didn't say I
[48:40] won't lose you he said he won't lose you
[48:42] so he's the one that's got to take you
[48:43] through these patches of your life amen
[48:46] sometimes we look at our our lives and
[48:48] you know what there are people that
[48:49] seems like they can't win for losing
[48:52] have you ever met people like that and
[48:54] it seems like everything in their life
[48:55] is constant trials and they can never
[48:57] seem to get ahead and it seems like if
[48:59] there's not in financial troubles and
[49:01] they're in sickness and if they're not
[49:02] in sickness and they've got relationship
[49:04] troubles or their Church splits or the
[49:06] you know lose their job whatever it
[49:08] might be and you say how can that be God
[49:11] let me tell you those are the people God
[49:13] uses the most
[49:15] he's chastening them remember chastening
[49:17] is not all disciplined it's that
[49:19] teaching it's that guiding it's that
[49:20] growing it's that maturity because they
[49:22] have a very special place in the body
[49:24] and you'll find that the ones that he
[49:25] works on the hardest are the ones that
[49:27] he uses the most
[49:29] so this life of ease if we're looking
[49:31] for ease what you're saying is God don't
[49:33] use me
[49:34] because life lives of ease are never
[49:36] going to be those of the great Heroes of
[49:37] the faith amen and we look at those
[49:39] people many times and there you can see
[49:41] the sincerity you can see the commitment
[49:43] to the things of God and they're
[49:44] faithful and everything and yet they
[49:46] keep going through difficult times and
[49:48] it reminded me of Joseph as I was
[49:50] thinking on these things
[49:51] and let's look at Joseph let's compare
[49:53] this perfect Road
[49:55] to the road of Joseph
[49:57] because you see that Joseph was born
[49:59] into a chosen family
[50:01] he had a believing mother he had a
[50:03] believing father they're in the lineage
[50:05] of the great father Abraham they were a
[50:07] called out people
[50:09] and then God puts a a special gift in
[50:12] his life and he is God's Prophet even as
[50:14] a young boy
[50:16] and he's his dad's favorite and he gets
[50:18] the special jacket you know that singles
[50:20] him out from from all of his brothers
[50:23] and then God starts to work in his life
[50:25] and he starts to give him dreams and
[50:27] Joseph shares those dreams with his
[50:28] family and they get mad at him don't
[50:30] they
[50:31] they get angry with him sharing the
[50:33] things that God has shown him amen
[50:37] now where is Joseph's choice in all of
[50:39] this
[50:40] Joseph is what he is God is calling God
[50:43] has made him God has put a gift in his
[50:44] life Joseph doesn't have a choice in any
[50:47] aspect of his life here and honestly it
[50:49] seems like he's going pretty well
[50:51] and then as soon as he gets a special
[50:53] coat as soon as he gets recognized as
[50:56] being special then the jealousy becomes
[50:57] completely untameable in his brothers
[50:59] and they go off to to graze the Sheep
[51:02] elsewhere and his dad says hey go check
[51:03] up on your brothers and he goes over
[51:05] there and as soon as they see him coming
[51:07] they make a plan to kill him
[51:10] and as soon as he comes in they grab him
[51:12] they tear his coat off and they throw
[51:14] him down in a well for a few days
[51:16] and they're planning to kill him they're
[51:18] planning to kill him and then a slave
[51:20] trade a group of slave Traders comes by
[51:22] and they say you know what let's not
[51:24] kill him let's just sell him into
[51:25] slavery
[51:27] so he goes from On Top of the World
[51:28] prophetic gift in a great and loving
[51:31] Christian home if we could put it that
[51:32] way now he's gone into a well for three
[51:35] days then he drops into slavery
[51:38] and now he's taken out of his homeland
[51:40] he's taken away from family
[51:41] he's still got a prophetic gift
[51:44] he still comes from a great family but
[51:46] now he's in a situation that he has not
[51:49] made a single choice to the bad and yet
[51:51] he's in a horrible situation
[51:54] he hasn't done a thing wrong church and
[51:56] yet he's been sold into slavery
[51:59] and he goes there and he comes to
[52:01] Potiphar's house the captain of of the
[52:03] pharaoh's guard
[52:05] and he goes there and you know what
[52:07] Joseph's attitude is
[52:09] if I'm going to be a slave I'm going to
[52:10] be the best slave
[52:12] that's the attitude of a child of God in
[52:14] tough situations no matter how bad it is
[52:17] I'm going to be a child of God I'm going
[52:19] to be a Son of God I'm going to be a
[52:20] daughter of God I'm going to be the
[52:22] greatest there can be in this situation
[52:25] I'm going to dig in and I'm going to
[52:27] show what's in me rather than let the
[52:29] circumstance Define me amen and so
[52:32] Joseph goes in and the scripture says as
[52:35] a slave the Lord was with Joseph
[52:38] the Lord was with Joseph in the lowest
[52:41] point he'd experienced in his life so
[52:43] far and potiphar realizes this and
[52:45] potiphar makes him his chief of staff he
[52:48] makes him his Steward and Joseph has
[52:50] control over all of Potiphar's assets
[52:53] everything potiphar has he says the only
[52:55] thing you're not allowed is my wife
[52:57] everything else you control as a slave
[53:01] and potiphar is blessed and blessed and
[53:03] blessed and all of his Holdings and all
[53:05] of his assets grow and grow and grow
[53:06] under Joseph
[53:08] the Lord is with him blessing him in the
[53:11] lowest point he's been in his life amen
[53:14] and then comes the choice for Joseph
[53:16] because Potiphar's wife tries to seduce
[53:18] him
[53:20] and he's got a choice
[53:21] he can hold on to the power and the
[53:24] authority he has as a slave
[53:27] or he can choose to do the right thing
[53:29] and risk judgment
[53:31] and this is the first place that Joseph
[53:33] has to make a choice because he knows
[53:35] it's probably not going to end well
[53:37] he knows it's not going to end well you
[53:39] know they say hell had no fury like a
[53:41] woman scorned
[53:43] this woman he knows her character she's
[53:46] just shown her character he knows this
[53:48] isn't going to do well but as a child of
[53:50] God he makes a harder decision and he
[53:53] uses his feet for discernment and he
[53:55] gets out of the situation he turns a
[53:57] flat down he doesn't talk about it he
[53:59] gets out of the house and he goes
[54:02] but what that means is he can't defend
[54:04] himself
[54:05] and that woman drags him
[54:07] drags down his reputation accuses him in
[54:10] front of her husband and her husband
[54:11] can't afford to be shamed by believing
[54:14] Joseph so what does he do he takes
[54:16] Joseph who has made the right decision
[54:18] and he puts him now into prison
[54:20] for making the right decision Joseph now
[54:22] goes into an even worse place
[54:25] but he's a Son of God and what does he
[54:27] say if I'm going to be a slave prisoner
[54:29] I'm going to be the best slave prisoner
[54:30] there is here and pretty soon he's
[54:33] running the entire prison he has free
[54:35] reign over everything that's there the
[54:37] warden is sitting back in his
[54:38] air-conditioned office and letting
[54:40] Joseph do all the work
[54:41] and the scripture says and the Lord was
[54:44] with Joseph
[54:46] Son of God
[54:48] that he's the most perfect type of
[54:50] Christ we have in the scriptures no
[54:52] matter the situation the Lord was with
[54:54] them because he kept making when he was
[54:56] given a decision he made the right
[54:58] decision even if it led him into an even
[55:00] worse decision amen
[55:02] in prison
[55:04] as a slave God is still with them then
[55:07] he has this wonderful opportunity
[55:08] remember the Pharaoh puts his chief
[55:10] Butler and his chief Baker into prison
[55:12] because they did something wrong who
[55:14] knows what and they're sitting there in
[55:16] prison for a while and then they have
[55:17] dreams and and they come to Joseph and
[55:19] they tell him these dreams that are
[55:21] bothering them
[55:22] and Joseph interprets the dream by God's
[55:25] grace
[55:26] God gives him the interpretation he
[55:27] tells the butler he says you're going to
[55:29] be restored to pharaoh and he tells the
[55:31] baker he says you're going to have your
[55:32] head taken from you and then they're
[55:33] going to hang you
[55:35] and sure enough that's what happens but
[55:37] Joseph before the butler is called up he
[55:39] says when you get out of here remember
[55:41] me
[55:42] and you know what the butler does as
[55:44] soon as he gets out of prison he
[55:46] promptly forgets Joseph
[55:47] so now Joseph is feeling he has the
[55:50] opportunity let me put it that way to be
[55:52] depressed to be despondent because he's
[55:55] done something for somebody else and now
[55:56] they've completely forgotten what he did
[55:58] for them
[55:59] and he's at the lowest point of his life
[56:02] until one day Pharaoh has a dream and
[56:04] nobody can interpret it and the chief
[56:06] Butler says I know a guy
[56:08] he finally remembers Joseph and he says
[56:11] I know a guy
[56:12] and Pharaoh says bring him before me
[56:13] Joseph comes up he says can you
[56:15] interpret dreams no I can't but the God
[56:17] I serve can he says well here's my dream
[56:19] Joseph goes God gives him the
[56:21] interpretation he comes back he gives
[56:22] Pharaoh the dream which is what there's
[56:24] going to be the years of famine or
[56:26] there's going to be years of plenty then
[56:27] there's going to be years of famine and
[56:29] at the end of the famine it's not going
[56:30] to be good
[56:31] and Pharaoh says well what do we do and
[56:34] Joseph
[56:35] through all of the experiences he has
[56:38] had in the depths of his life in the
[56:40] hardest times of his life speaks from
[56:42] those experiences and says you need a
[56:44] good man you need a man that can prepare
[56:46] and put this aside put him in charge
[56:49] he'll take care of everything and we'll
[56:51] make it through and Pharaoh says I can't
[56:52] think of a better person than you
[56:54] so we look at that line in that line in
[56:56] one day Joseph goes from the hardest
[56:58] worst place of his life straight up to
[57:01] the right hand of power
[57:03] in a single day Church in a single day
[57:06] he goes from a despondent potentially
[57:08] slave prisoner to the right hand of
[57:11] pharaoh and nobody is more powerful in
[57:13] Egypt than him except the king himself
[57:16] except the Pharaoh himself in one day he
[57:19] went from nothing to everything
[57:22] from there what happens
[57:24] he goes and he does all the hard work
[57:26] and he gathers all of the food in and he
[57:28] prepares all of these things and then
[57:30] famine hits and two years into the
[57:32] famine his brothers show up
[57:34] and they come in and Joseph recognizes
[57:36] them they don't recognize him and Joseph
[57:37] is looking at them and of course he
[57:39] plays all sorts of tricks with them
[57:40] because he's trying to figure out if
[57:41] they developed any character since he
[57:43] left
[57:44] and so he goes through this character
[57:46] testing phase and he proves them and
[57:48] they sure enough they pass it and so he
[57:51] finally reveals himself to them but I
[57:53] want you to catch the attitude I want
[57:55] you to catch the spirit of a son or a
[57:57] daughter of God as they come out of this
[57:58] watch the consideration he has for his
[58:01] past
[58:02] he says this and Joseph said to his
[58:04] Brethren come near to me I pray you and
[58:07] they came near and he said I am Joseph
[58:08] your brother whom you sold into Egypt
[58:10] now therefore be not grieved nor angry
[58:13] with yourselves that ye sold me hither
[58:17] listen Joseph someone that should have
[58:19] been angry Joseph had a right to be
[58:21] angry
[58:23] he says you guys don't be angry
[58:26] he says for God did send me here before
[58:30] you to preserve life
[58:33] to preserve life he put Joseph through
[58:35] slavery hell to preserve life
[58:39] why because he knew he had the character
[58:41] to go through it and still do the job at
[58:43] the end
[58:44] listen God ruined his life early on to
[58:48] save the world at that point
[58:50] church this is a real prophet of God
[58:52] that can look back at the times like
[58:54] that and say God was in it and I'm okay
[58:57] with it
[59:00] what an attitude to have no bitterness
[59:02] no offense no hurt not only is he not
[59:05] mad at God he's not even mad at the
[59:07] people that did it
[59:09] forgiveness is there he's saying come
[59:11] near
[59:12] the spirit and the bride say come
[59:14] don't worry about it I'm okay I want you
[59:17] to be okay too
[59:19] he says for these two years have the
[59:21] famine been in the land and yet there
[59:22] are five years in the which there shall
[59:24] be neither earring nor Harvest catch
[59:26] this he says and God sent me before you
[59:28] to preserve your posterity in the earth
[59:31] and to save your lives by a great
[59:33] Deliverance he had to go through Great
[59:35] Tribulation to get a great Deliverance
[59:38] he says so now it was not you that sent
[59:41] me hither but God who put him in the
[59:43] well the brothers who sold them to the
[59:45] slave masters the brothers but he says
[59:48] it was God all along
[59:50] it was God all along it wasn't you it
[59:52] was God and he hath made me a father to
[59:55] pharaoh and the Lord of all of his house
[59:57] and a ruler throughout all the land of
[59:59] Egypt look at this road the majority if
[1:00:02] we were to go back the majority of
[1:00:05] Joseph's life is in the red if we could
[1:00:07] put it he's in debt he's in hard times
[1:00:09] he's in difficult times he's in pain
[1:00:11] he's in suffering he has no power he has
[1:00:13] no Authority
[1:00:15] he has no benefits as a son of God
[1:00:17] and yet he says through it all God has
[1:00:20] done it it was God all along this was
[1:00:23] God's perfect Road for Joseph
[1:00:28] it wasn't this constant rise to victory
[1:00:30] was it like we would think
[1:00:33] but it was a broken road and it was
[1:00:35] God's perfect will
[1:00:37] our road doesn't Define us what defines
[1:00:39] us as our response our attitude the way
[1:00:42] we can talk about it afterwards tells us
[1:00:45] what we were in it
[1:00:47] amen
[1:00:49] what we've got to be willing to trust
[1:00:51] God regardless of what that road looks
[1:00:53] like
[1:00:54] let's take a look at another broken road
[1:00:55] this morning let's go to the other side
[1:00:57] of things we start with Joseph in a
[1:00:59] perfect situation a type of Christ in
[1:01:01] the scriptures let's go to the other
[1:01:03] Road let's go to Rahab
[1:01:05] let's talk about rahab's Broken Road
[1:01:08] compare her to to Joseph
[1:01:11] she's born into the wrong family she's
[1:01:13] born into a family of idol worshipers
[1:01:15] she's born into a land where they are
[1:01:18] going to be judged very shortly
[1:01:20] she has made no choice this is her
[1:01:23] Heritage she's born in a family that's
[1:01:25] going to be judged
[1:01:27] enter circumstances and we don't know
[1:01:29] how it became about Rahab becomes a
[1:01:32] prostitute
[1:01:33] a prostitute is the lowest form of human
[1:01:36] life on the planet aside from the men
[1:01:38] that will take advantage of her
[1:01:41] but through circumstances in life she
[1:01:43] becomes
[1:01:44] a cesspool
[1:01:46] a filthy piece of humanity and we don't
[1:01:49] know what happened we don't know what
[1:01:51] brought her to that level amen but she
[1:01:53] is living in total and absolute sin and
[1:01:56] filth
[1:01:59] at some point she had to make a choice
[1:02:01] church and she made a choice to stay in
[1:02:03] it
[1:02:05] we'd say that does this look like a
[1:02:06] child of God
[1:02:08] then God says the cup of the amorites is
[1:02:10] the iniquity of amorites is full now is
[1:02:12] the time of judgment and he sends the
[1:02:14] Israelites into the land
[1:02:17] and they come through and they clear out
[1:02:18] the land on the other side of Jordan and
[1:02:20] then what happens is God says okay now
[1:02:22] you've got to go in now you've got to
[1:02:24] judge the people in there you are my
[1:02:25] hand of judgment for all of the
[1:02:27] Canaanites she's under judgment now
[1:02:31] and she deserves it
[1:02:33] she absolutely deserves it by the law by
[1:02:35] the word she deserves it amen
[1:02:38] and what happens is that she the the
[1:02:41] entire country is so evil that God says
[1:02:43] I won't spare a one
[1:02:44] Kill Them All
[1:02:46] women children men everything destroy it
[1:02:49] all
[1:02:50] and then the destroying Army arrives you
[1:02:52] talk about a low point
[1:02:54] you know that you can win you know
[1:02:57] you're scheduled for Destruction they
[1:02:58] have more people they have a greater
[1:03:00] people and they have a supernatural god
[1:03:03] with them
[1:03:04] your toast you're hooped
[1:03:06] you might as well just get ready to die
[1:03:08] but then she hears about a living God
[1:03:12] and we see an uptick we see a green
[1:03:14] event in our life and that she hears
[1:03:16] about a God that does things that her
[1:03:18] Gods can't do
[1:03:20] and from there
[1:03:22] what happens
[1:03:24] the enemy comes right to her door
[1:03:27] the destroying Angel comes right to her
[1:03:30] door amen
[1:03:32] and what happens is the spies come in
[1:03:35] and this is where she gets a choice
[1:03:36] Church
[1:03:38] they come in and she has to choose do I
[1:03:41] commit treason
[1:03:43] in the hopes of Mercy
[1:03:45] or do I stick with what I've had all
[1:03:47] this time and stay with my way of life
[1:03:50] this is her moment
[1:03:52] to put what she believes
[1:03:54] into action because she says we've heard
[1:03:56] of everything your God has done
[1:03:58] we know I know he's the real God
[1:04:02] and this is her moment to take what she
[1:04:04] said she believed and put it into action
[1:04:06] and what does she do she hides those
[1:04:07] spies the king the scripture says the
[1:04:10] king literally says to her bring him out
[1:04:12] and she says they're already gone she
[1:04:14] lies to her own King to preserve the
[1:04:16] life of those spies
[1:04:18] and then at the very end what does she
[1:04:20] do she says have mercy
[1:04:22] have mercy on me and what do they do
[1:04:24] they say take the Rope of Deliverance
[1:04:26] take a token of what you use to save us
[1:04:29] and hang it in your door hang it in your
[1:04:31] window and that will be a token to us
[1:04:33] not to enter the home
[1:04:35] and he says they said get everyone
[1:04:36] everyone you know get your family into
[1:04:39] that house
[1:04:41] shut the door and don't come out
[1:04:45] now she's given a chance to what
[1:04:47] simply obey she didn't get a chance to
[1:04:50] say I don't like how red looks on my
[1:04:52] house
[1:04:52] people are going to wonder why I'm
[1:04:54] hanging a red rope
[1:04:56] she just had to obey hang the Rope get
[1:04:59] them in and shut the door and stay there
[1:05:01] amen she couldn't come up with a better
[1:05:03] way but she's stuck still
[1:05:06] she she pleads for mercy and she's given
[1:05:08] a choice and she has a token she has a
[1:05:11] token for her household and then the
[1:05:14] enemy comes and surrounds her and things
[1:05:16] start to go down again and things start
[1:05:18] to go down again and then realize this
[1:05:20] she's living on the very walls that have
[1:05:22] to fall
[1:05:23] her house her home her place of
[1:05:26] residence is on the walls that have to
[1:05:28] come down supernaturally she's part of
[1:05:31] the thing that has to be destroyed by
[1:05:32] God you talk about a Razor's Edge you
[1:05:34] talk about living on the cliff she's on
[1:05:36] the cliff and she's just got one finger
[1:05:38] holding her she's scheduled for
[1:05:40] Destruction her very home not just her
[1:05:42] life her very home is scheduled for
[1:05:43] Destruction the place that they said
[1:05:46] will be a shelter a tower of strength
[1:05:49] for her is scheduled for Destruction and
[1:05:52] she has to believe that her home won't
[1:05:54] be destroyed when everyone else's is
[1:05:57] what a horrible place to be living in
[1:05:59] you're sitting there and you're on the
[1:06:01] wall and you see that Army going around
[1:06:03] and around and you round and you know
[1:06:04] it's just a matter of time before
[1:06:06] they're going to get in amen
[1:06:08] but she obeys
[1:06:10] she obeys and that's the first tick we
[1:06:13] see up is over six days she obeys the
[1:06:15] word and she sticks with it and she
[1:06:17] sticks with it and she sticks with it
[1:06:19] and then the walls come down and you
[1:06:21] know what hers is the only house on
[1:06:23] those walls that did not come down
[1:06:25] built from the same materials
[1:06:27] same sinful family inside
[1:06:31] but yet she obeyed the word and she put
[1:06:33] her token out there and that is what
[1:06:35] preserved her I just saw yesterday that
[1:06:38] the archaeologists have found rahab's
[1:06:40] house
[1:06:40] it's the only portion of the wall Still
[1:06:42] Standing everything fell down except
[1:06:44] this one portion it's rahab's house
[1:06:46] they've literally found proof that Rahab
[1:06:48] was in Jericho
[1:06:50] isn't that an amazing thing after thirty
[1:06:52] five hundred four thousand years
[1:06:53] whatever it's been they finally have
[1:06:55] proof of a word of God that we've known
[1:06:56] all this time
[1:06:58] but she obeys the word of God and all
[1:07:00] her and her family are saved what did
[1:07:03] they do
[1:07:04] nothing
[1:07:06] except listen when she said I've got a
[1:07:08] way to save you
[1:07:10] I've got a way to save you don't ask me
[1:07:12] how
[1:07:13] just know I've got a way to save you
[1:07:15] they're going to spare us if we'll stay
[1:07:16] in here and we'll plead the token
[1:07:21] look at what happens to her she comes
[1:07:23] back she converts she starts to serve
[1:07:26] the one true God and she marries an
[1:07:28] Israelite captain and she is put into
[1:07:30] the natural lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:07:34] all her life
[1:07:37] failed
[1:07:38] rotten messy Godless
[1:07:43] and in just a week or two
[1:07:44] maybe two weeks total God turns her into
[1:07:47] the daughter of God she always was
[1:07:49] I loved how brother Tim said when they
[1:07:51] went to talk at the marriage and they
[1:07:53] said is there any reason
[1:07:54] this woman should not marry this man and
[1:07:56] somebody stands up and says yes she was
[1:07:58] a prostitute he says where are the
[1:07:59] witnesses
[1:08:00] destroyed
[1:08:02] it was a replay of what Christ did with
[1:08:05] that woman that was caught in adultery
[1:08:07] woman where are thy Witnesses she says
[1:08:09] they're not here neither do I condemn
[1:08:10] they go and sin no more it's a perfect
[1:08:12] type of Rahab right there listen to this
[1:08:14] the prophet of God would say
[1:08:16] he so cared
[1:08:19] he so cared even for a woman that was an
[1:08:22] outsider not an Israelite she didn't
[1:08:24] belong to the group but she was an
[1:08:25] outsider Presbyterian Methodist or
[1:08:28] something she was on the other side in
[1:08:29] other words she wasn't a message
[1:08:30] believer if we want to take it to our
[1:08:32] day he says but when she heard her name
[1:08:35] was Rahab she was a harlot but when she
[1:08:37] heard how God was in a pillar of fire
[1:08:39] and was leading them she called out to
[1:08:41] God and she showed Mercy to the spies
[1:08:43] that had come out to look out the land
[1:08:45] and because she cared for her and her
[1:08:48] people God cared for her
[1:08:51] in so much till this Harlot will give
[1:08:53] her life to Christ to the cause because
[1:08:56] she had seen the sign of a supernatural
[1:08:58] God and she served her Gods right in her
[1:09:01] own denomination
[1:09:03] he says but when she saw this great
[1:09:05] Supernatural sign she cried out and
[1:09:08] asked for mercy and for Mercy for her
[1:09:10] family and God so cared for her that the
[1:09:13] whole city lapped down one on top of the
[1:09:15] other but there wasn't one rock moved on
[1:09:19] her house he cares though her being
[1:09:22] Outsider she wasn't in the group at that
[1:09:24] time but he cared he said he always
[1:09:27] cares you say how could he care to start
[1:09:31] her in that family in that condition to
[1:09:34] put her into that trade to put her into
[1:09:36] that job
[1:09:37] listen
[1:09:39] we're born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:09:41] come to the world speaking lies as the
[1:09:44] prophet of God would say
[1:09:45] Satan has his finger in every one of our
[1:09:47] lives
[1:09:48] things are all messed up things are all
[1:09:50] twisted up God doesn't care about that
[1:09:52] he can untwist them
[1:09:54] he doesn't worry about where you start
[1:09:56] he's just trying to pull out that see
[1:09:57] Gene of God that he placed in there
[1:10:00] and then Satan came in and sowed a
[1:10:01] different seed all around it and that's
[1:10:03] what's messed us up God didn't mess her
[1:10:05] up God pulled her out
[1:10:07] amen he was there all the time her
[1:10:09] complete life
[1:10:11] was a complete and total waste for for
[1:10:13] for decades perhaps there is nothing
[1:10:16] that Rahab took out of that time
[1:10:18] that she would have brought into her
[1:10:20] life in marriage as a daughter of God as
[1:10:22] a child of Israel nothing benefited her
[1:10:26] total Broken Road and yet as soon as she
[1:10:29] comes in he places her in the natural
[1:10:30] lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:10:33] it's not about the road
[1:10:35] it's about the seed
[1:10:36] amen it's about what's inside of every
[1:10:38] one of us
[1:10:39] I want to show you something
[1:10:41] you know I'm an engineer I do graphs I'm
[1:10:44] going to show you a second graph
[1:10:46] and this will help you no matter where
[1:10:48] you're at today I want to call this
[1:10:49] graph and it's going to be the lower one
[1:10:51] whose child is Rahab
[1:10:54] so up above I have the exact same path
[1:10:58] of rahab's Life as we just saw
[1:11:00] but beneath it
[1:11:02] it's hard to see
[1:11:04] maybe I can go over here
[1:11:07] if we look right here
[1:11:10] when she's in a wrong family in an idol
[1:11:12] worshiper
[1:11:13] is she a child of God
[1:11:17] yes
[1:11:18] when she's a prostitute is she a child
[1:11:21] of God
[1:11:22] when she's judged by God to die
[1:11:25] based on her Heritage is she a child of
[1:11:27] God
[1:11:29] when she hears about a living God is she
[1:11:32] a child of God
[1:11:34] when she's given a choice and a token is
[1:11:38] she a child of God
[1:11:39] see we look here and we say that can't
[1:11:41] be God but she's a child of God all the
[1:11:43] way through church she's a child of God
[1:11:46] from the start to the Finish you are
[1:11:47] what you are and it doesn't change when
[1:11:50] you hear the truth you either are a
[1:11:52] child of God or you aren't and if you
[1:11:53] are a child of God you always were a
[1:11:55] child of God we look at that and we say
[1:11:57] how can that be a child of God but she
[1:11:59] was no less a child of God as a
[1:12:01] prostitute as she was the wife of salmon
[1:12:04] no less a child of God don't look at
[1:12:07] where the person's at today
[1:12:09] you look to the Token you look to the
[1:12:11] promise you look to the word you're
[1:12:12] holding over them
[1:12:14] why God's not going to lose a one and
[1:12:17] he's going to draw out what's inside of
[1:12:19] us no matter what that situation looks
[1:12:21] like amen
[1:12:23] Rahab made a lot of bad choices some
[1:12:25] were forced some were actual choices we
[1:12:26] know they were all wrong until one day
[1:12:29] she had to make the choice what will you
[1:12:31] do with the Living God
[1:12:33] and that's the same choice we face today
[1:12:35] what are you going to do with This Man
[1:12:37] Called Jesus Christ with this word that
[1:12:39] he's brought today what are you going to
[1:12:40] do with it that's the only choice you'll
[1:12:43] make that ever matters
[1:12:45] you make the right choice there
[1:12:46] everything else
[1:12:48] it doesn't even play in
[1:12:50] you just got to make that choice amen
[1:12:53] it may take a while
[1:12:55] it took a while for her
[1:12:57] looked hopeless
[1:13:00] but he says they're engraved in the
[1:13:02] palms of my hand
[1:13:03] they're there and there's no taking them
[1:13:05] out
[1:13:06] they're there even if he didn't want
[1:13:07] them not that he wouldn't but they're
[1:13:09] there no matter what and nothing can
[1:13:11] take you out of his hands amen Jesus
[1:13:13] said I won't lose a single one that the
[1:13:15] father has given me
[1:13:17] look at the scripture in Isaiah 51. it
[1:13:20] says for the Lord shall Comfort Zion
[1:13:24] who is Zion
[1:13:25] Zion is always the bride it's always the
[1:13:28] bride so let's read it this way for the
[1:13:30] Lord shall Comfort the bride
[1:13:33] he will Comfort all her
[1:13:36] waste places
[1:13:39] what bride of Christ has places of waste
[1:13:42] in her life
[1:13:45] Rahab sure did
[1:13:47] he says and he will make her Wilderness
[1:13:49] like Eden
[1:13:52] so Bride is a bride experience is going
[1:13:55] to include waste places
[1:13:57] it's going to include Wilderness places
[1:13:59] and it says in her desert like the
[1:14:01] garden of the Lord so you're going to
[1:14:03] have desert places in your life in your
[1:14:05] broken road as well he says but joy and
[1:14:09] gladness shall be found therein
[1:14:11] Thanksgiving and the voice of Melody in
[1:14:14] other words let me tell you God can turn
[1:14:16] your wasted life your wasted moments
[1:14:18] your poor decisions into a place of
[1:14:20] comfort
[1:14:21] amen he can take the ashes of a
[1:14:23] destroyed life of a ruined marriage of a
[1:14:25] hurtful experience with a Ministry of a
[1:14:28] of a body that's been wrecked by pain
[1:14:30] and suffering he can take it as if it
[1:14:33] never happened and turn it into a place
[1:14:34] of comfort
[1:14:36] Joseph spoke from a place of comfort
[1:14:38] when he when he talked to his brothers
[1:14:40] God was in it all the time and he did it
[1:14:43] to preserve life amen he can take the
[1:14:45] desolation of your life you talk about a
[1:14:47] Wilderness experience what was the
[1:14:48] Wilderness experience going on around
[1:14:50] and around and around and never
[1:14:51] conquering never overcoming never going
[1:14:54] into the land of promise he says he can
[1:14:55] take that experience and turn it into
[1:14:57] Eden he can restore you back from there
[1:15:00] into your original condition as if it
[1:15:03] was never a Wilderness in the first
[1:15:04] place that's the kind of God that is
[1:15:06] calling out a bride in this age amen
[1:15:08] that he doesn't look at the road but he
[1:15:10] says I am the god that healeth Thee I am
[1:15:12] the god that delivers Thee I am the god
[1:15:15] that called you out
[1:15:17] don't look at the road
[1:15:19] look to me
[1:15:20] and just trust me to take you through
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:24] let's look at one that's maybe a little
[1:15:26] closer to us sometimes
[1:15:28] let's talk about Jonah for a little bit
[1:15:31] let's talk about a prophet's life
[1:15:33] you could probably put brother Brandon's
[1:15:35] life up here just like this and it would
[1:15:36] look similar
[1:15:37] because remember he turned God down
[1:15:40] he rejected God's call
[1:15:42] he refused to go to the Pentecostals and
[1:15:43] these different things
[1:15:45] prophet of God the messenger of the age
[1:15:47] no perfect Road there I'm so glad we got
[1:15:49] to see a profit being developed in our
[1:15:51] age because it gives me hope that I can
[1:15:53] make it if he can make it the mistakes
[1:15:55] the choices the influence he came under
[1:15:57] at different times and God had to train
[1:15:59] and teach his Prophet just like he's got
[1:16:01] to train each and every one of us amen
[1:16:02] Jonah born into an Israelite home born
[1:16:05] into a good family given a gift ordained
[1:16:07] of God to be a prophet was was obedient
[1:16:10] to God and His calling and everything's
[1:16:12] going great
[1:16:14] he's a prophet of God what could
[1:16:16] possibly go wrong and then God gives him
[1:16:18] a special mission that takes him outside
[1:16:19] of his comfort zone
[1:16:21] takes him outside of Israel
[1:16:23] takes them to people that don't deserve
[1:16:26] his message
[1:16:27] and you know what the scripture says
[1:16:30] it says Jonah
[1:16:32] ran from the presence
[1:16:35] of the Lord
[1:16:37] he actively
[1:16:39] and specifically chose to depart from
[1:16:42] the presence of God
[1:16:44] as if you could do such a thing
[1:16:47] but he walked away from where God was
[1:16:49] talking to him and he jumps on a ship to
[1:16:51] tarshish
[1:16:54] he gets to a point where he says God I
[1:16:56] don't want to hear that knocking on my
[1:16:58] heart
[1:16:58] I don't want to hear that voice that's
[1:17:00] telling me to go to Nineveh I'm going to
[1:17:02] go out of your presence so that I don't
[1:17:04] hear you telling me what I'm supposed to
[1:17:05] do
[1:17:07] amen he runs from the presence of God
[1:17:09] and then he jumps on the ship to
[1:17:11] tarshish now he's on a ship with a bunch
[1:17:13] of people that ain't done nothing wrong
[1:17:15] like that
[1:17:16] they're not running from the presence of
[1:17:18] the Lord perhaps they don't even know
[1:17:19] the Lord we know they don't know the
[1:17:21] Lord because they're praying to all
[1:17:22] their gods a little bit later but he
[1:17:23] jumps on board and when he goes on board
[1:17:26] that ship in Disobedience he takes
[1:17:28] judgment right with him
[1:17:30] and he goes on that ship and God sends a
[1:17:33] storm that's going to destroy
[1:17:35] remember he's on that boat and the first
[1:17:37] thing they do is they throw all their
[1:17:38] cargo so they lose all their blessings
[1:17:41] they lose all the profit they were going
[1:17:43] to make
[1:17:44] and then after that when that's all done
[1:17:46] and it's getting worse and worse and
[1:17:47] worse and the ship is starting to sink
[1:17:50] then they say everybody pray and they go
[1:17:52] down and Jonah is sleeping in the bottom
[1:17:55] of the ship
[1:17:57] he's sleeping in the bottom of ship and
[1:17:58] they say get up pray to your God we're
[1:18:00] going to pray to ours you pray to yours
[1:18:02] and they pray for a while but guess what
[1:18:04] Joe name pray in church
[1:18:06] because he knows there's no point in
[1:18:08] praying
[1:18:09] what's the point of praying you got to
[1:18:11] come to obedience
[1:18:13] Lord take me out of this storm obey
[1:18:16] it's the only way to get out of the
[1:18:17] storm is to obey your child of God
[1:18:20] so Jonah's choices have taken him into
[1:18:22] this storm
[1:18:24] Jonas choices have put other people's
[1:18:25] lives in danger Jonah's choices have
[1:18:28] taken the blessings out of those
[1:18:29] people's lives
[1:18:31] because he knows better and they don't
[1:18:34] he goes in there amen and Jonah doesn't
[1:18:37] do a thing to help those men
[1:18:41] because he knows God ain't going to
[1:18:42] bless them while he's in Disobedience as
[1:18:45] long as he's on the ship amen our
[1:18:47] Disobedience Church it affects everybody
[1:18:48] around us
[1:18:51] everybody pays a price
[1:18:53] fathers you disobey the household pays a
[1:18:56] price mothers you disobey the household
[1:18:58] pays a price the children always suffer
[1:19:01] the children always suffer
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:04] Jonah does everything except the right
[1:19:06] thing
[1:19:08] until the situation gets very desperate
[1:19:11] and I think what happens you know we
[1:19:13] know what what happens is they say well
[1:19:15] we're going to cast lots we're going to
[1:19:16] draw straws and whoever gets the Short
[1:19:17] Straw that's the Jonah
[1:19:19] that's what we say today
[1:19:21] it's based on this story whoever draws a
[1:19:23] short straw that's the person that's
[1:19:24] causing all these problems and Jonah
[1:19:26] gets the straw and finally he's got to
[1:19:28] come clean and he says what this is my
[1:19:32] fault
[1:19:33] I'm the problem
[1:19:35] sometimes that's the first thing we've
[1:19:37] got to do when we step into situations
[1:19:38] like this and say it's me
[1:19:41] just hands up no equivocation no
[1:19:44] explanation Lord this one's on me men
[1:19:47] and Brethren this one's on me I'm the
[1:19:49] problem
[1:19:50] we got to be able to do that we've got
[1:19:53] to be able to say I'm in Disobedience I
[1:19:55] know better I know I shouldn't be doing
[1:19:56] it I've been doing it
[1:19:58] and it's me
[1:20:00] and what does Jonah tell them he says
[1:20:02] we've got to get me away from you
[1:20:06] it's not fair that you pay the price for
[1:20:07] what I've done so Jonah says throw me
[1:20:10] into the water
[1:20:11] you know what Jonah does he exits his
[1:20:13] decision
[1:20:15] he stops going where he was going
[1:20:17] he quits disobeying and as soon as he
[1:20:20] hits the water the storm stops
[1:20:23] as soon as he can't get back in that
[1:20:25] boat as soon as they've gone beyond him
[1:20:28] he's in the water
[1:20:29] now it's calm well he's in the middle of
[1:20:32] nowhere
[1:20:33] there's no salvation here but at least
[1:20:36] it's not stormy
[1:20:39] but he's getting real low
[1:20:41] things aren't going real well
[1:20:43] it's thrown into the ocean and he's
[1:20:45] floating there and probably thinking how
[1:20:46] is this going to work out and then
[1:20:47] something comes up and swallows him
[1:20:50] and things get really bad really quickly
[1:20:54] this was a whale created by God to fit
[1:20:56] Jonah
[1:20:57] this is a situation this is a trial this
[1:21:01] is a horrible experience crafted by the
[1:21:04] spoken word
[1:21:06] to take Jonah to the depths of the ocean
[1:21:09] and despair
[1:21:13] this is Jonah's perfect yet broken road
[1:21:17] we'll see takes them down there
[1:21:20] and Jonah finally starts acting like a
[1:21:22] prophet and starts praying he starts
[1:21:25] seeking the presence of God rather than
[1:21:27] running from the presence of God and for
[1:21:29] three days he's seeking God and you know
[1:21:32] what God doesn't answer
[1:21:36] but you know what God's doing
[1:21:38] God's working on the fish God's working
[1:21:40] on the situation and for those three
[1:21:42] days that fish is taking Jonah by a
[1:21:45] circuitous ocean route right to where he
[1:21:48] needs to be
[1:21:50] and then as the scripture says that at
[1:21:52] the end of those three days God tells
[1:21:55] the fish
[1:21:56] spit them out let them go
[1:21:58] remember brother Ram talks about that
[1:22:00] quote where he says God takes troubles
[1:22:02] and puts bits in their mouth
[1:22:05] this is what happens with children of
[1:22:06] God is God makes them obey his will to
[1:22:10] produce what he needs out of us
[1:22:12] he takes that whale and he tells the
[1:22:15] whale he speaks where he says spit him
[1:22:16] out and the whale vomits him up onto the
[1:22:18] beach a lovely experience
[1:22:21] and yet Supernatural and he vomits him
[1:22:25] out God delivers him and God's
[1:22:27] Deliverance is a perfect sign to the
[1:22:29] people of Nineveh because they worship
[1:22:31] the whale
[1:22:33] and so they see a man come out of the
[1:22:35] mouth of their God then they believe
[1:22:37] that's a prophet from their God
[1:22:40] now the way the prophet would say it is
[1:22:42] they wouldn't have accepted his message
[1:22:44] if he had come the way he would have
[1:22:46] went normally if he had just walked over
[1:22:48] in in the traditional obedience if I
[1:22:50] could put it that way to what God had
[1:22:51] told him they would not have accepted
[1:22:53] his message but God used His prophets
[1:22:56] nature and response to to take him there
[1:22:58] in a perfect way so that they would hear
[1:23:00] his message and out of that perfect sign
[1:23:03] he preaches a message delivers a warning
[1:23:05] that they heat and he saves a city from
[1:23:08] death
[1:23:09] out of all of that God brings salvation
[1:23:11] now Joel is an interesting one because
[1:23:13] we say he refused to obey God he's a
[1:23:16] disobedient Prophet he's a an Unfaithful
[1:23:19] child of God
[1:23:21] and in a way he is
[1:23:23] but let's look at the way a prophet of
[1:23:25] God looks at it
[1:23:27] remember we think we're off sometimes
[1:23:29] but we've got to understand God knows
[1:23:32] his children
[1:23:34] I don't know if anyone except me has
[1:23:36] manipulated their children before
[1:23:40] you know how I get Samuel to drink his
[1:23:42] smoothie in the morning I say Samuel do
[1:23:44] you want a smoothie what's the first
[1:23:45] thing he says true to his father he says
[1:23:47] no
[1:23:50] and so you know what I say I say Jensen
[1:23:52] do you want a smoothie Jensen says yes
[1:23:55] Sam says I want a smoothie I want a
[1:23:56] smoothie
[1:23:58] what am I I'm manipulating him knowing
[1:24:00] his nature I use his nature to produce a
[1:24:04] result
[1:24:05] he's an imperfect boy
[1:24:09] I use his nature to get him into my will
[1:24:12] and he doesn't know what hit him
[1:24:15] Prophet God says this
[1:24:17] he says if you understand a little
[1:24:19] history the god of Nineveh was a whale
[1:24:21] and when the whale brought the prophet
[1:24:22] right up before the fishermen and spit
[1:24:24] him out on the bank it was a miracle
[1:24:26] lots of things are providential he says
[1:24:28] it was God's will that Jonah went on
[1:24:31] down there like that he says he had to
[1:24:34] show a miracle
[1:24:37] Jonah's response though we were
[1:24:40] classified as disobedient or rebellious
[1:24:42] God knowing it used it to produce the
[1:24:46] miracle he says it was God's will he
[1:24:49] says listen to this no matter what takes
[1:24:51] place God will make it Praise Him anyhow
[1:24:55] God has a way of doing things it wasn't
[1:24:57] providential that he took the wrong ship
[1:24:59] it was God's Eternal promise and God's
[1:25:03] Eternal way of doing things
[1:25:07] you mean that he can use my Rebellion
[1:25:11] yep
[1:25:12] he can turn it into his perfect will
[1:25:19] he says he's a bringing a message he
[1:25:21] shook Shivers up and down their backs
[1:25:23] when they saw the sea god open up its
[1:25:25] mouth and the prophet walked out with a
[1:25:27] Bible in his hand he says sure they
[1:25:28] believe it God always has signs and
[1:25:30] wonders he works in the Supernatural to
[1:25:33] make people to believe him
[1:25:35] he'd say many people think that Jonah
[1:25:37] was a terrible person Jonah was a
[1:25:40] prophet of the Lord walking in all the
[1:25:44] will of the Lord now here's the thing
[1:25:47] walking in all of the will of the Lord
[1:25:49] without knowing it
[1:25:52] you can't say he do it he didn't know it
[1:25:55] but in the end Jonah would have looked
[1:25:57] back and said
[1:25:59] God
[1:26:01] you're a little sneaky
[1:26:04] because he would understood exactly what
[1:26:05] happened after it happened God you used
[1:26:08] me you knew how I was going to do it and
[1:26:11] you used it
[1:26:12] and then you have to throw up his hands
[1:26:14] and you have to say praise the Lord
[1:26:16] isn't that what we do sometimes we get
[1:26:19] into situations in life and we respond
[1:26:21] the way we always have and God says
[1:26:23] gotcha
[1:26:24] and he turns it right around he turns it
[1:26:26] into what worship praise His glory
[1:26:30] because it certainly wasn't our Glory
[1:26:31] that got us into it
[1:26:32] it was his glory that turned it into
[1:26:34] something that was wonderful he says you
[1:26:36] say why did he do what he did he said he
[1:26:38] never done anything contrary to God's
[1:26:40] will again Jonah's knowledge of what
[1:26:42] he's doing versus God's knowledge of
[1:26:43] what is his will is two very different
[1:26:45] things but he says he never got out of
[1:26:47] God's will
[1:26:49] he just didn't know it
[1:26:50] he says you can't if you're in Christ do
[1:26:53] anything contrary if you're walking
[1:26:55] humbly and upright it may seem like you
[1:26:58] do but you don't do it he says nothing
[1:27:00] happens providentially the footsteps of
[1:27:03] a righteous man are ordered of the Lord
[1:27:04] and all things work together for the
[1:27:07] good to them that love him how can you
[1:27:09] take these scriptures he says and
[1:27:10] compare them with any other and then
[1:27:12] break them he says the scriptures cannot
[1:27:15] be broken
[1:27:17] God knows how to use us church he knows
[1:27:20] how to move us he knows how to break us
[1:27:21] he knows how to bend us he knows how to
[1:27:23] shape us he knows how to use our very
[1:27:25] cells for his glory and for his purpose
[1:27:29] this stink and flesh that we have ain't
[1:27:31] glorified yet
[1:27:32] and he can even use that
[1:27:34] he can even use that for his glory and
[1:27:37] to bring Salvation to somebody that
[1:27:39] needs it a whole city
[1:27:40] a whole city
[1:27:42] I was thinking on this and and I thought
[1:27:45] of a stained glass window
[1:27:48] because you look at a stained glass
[1:27:49] window you know you go to The Basilica
[1:27:51] and you see they've got those wonderful
[1:27:52] ones and you go to these big Cathedrals
[1:27:54] and they have these massive works of
[1:27:56] glass
[1:27:57] and you look at them and it's it's it's
[1:27:59] full of color and it's it just is so
[1:28:01] beautiful and you look at that and you
[1:28:03] say wow how do they do that even some of
[1:28:05] these nice homes on the East End you
[1:28:06] know they'll have a stained glass
[1:28:07] portion there and you just think wow
[1:28:09] what kind of what kind of artist was
[1:28:10] able to do that sort of thing with glass
[1:28:12] hardest thing to work with is glass
[1:28:15] because glass likes to break in straight
[1:28:17] edges
[1:28:18] and yet you go look at all of these
[1:28:20] glass pieces and they have curved pieces
[1:28:22] in them and you say how did they work
[1:28:25] with such brittle materials
[1:28:27] and produce something that looks so
[1:28:29] perfectly curved and fitted and shaped
[1:28:31] and everything Blended together
[1:28:33] and then you go up and you'll see that
[1:28:35] it's not one big piece of glass
[1:28:38] because that's one way you could do it
[1:28:39] you could just put one big plane of
[1:28:40] glass up there and then you could just
[1:28:42] put you know your your segments on it
[1:28:43] and then just paint it in that way and
[1:28:45] say well it's a stained glass window but
[1:28:46] it's not it's all individual pieces put
[1:28:49] together to form one big image
[1:28:51] amen
[1:28:52] so I looked it up I looked up how they
[1:28:55] do it
[1:28:56] it meant because I want you to catch
[1:28:57] this because a stained glass window is
[1:28:59] all broken pieces of glass
[1:29:02] none of the glass pieces are used as
[1:29:04] they came from the factory
[1:29:05] they're all broken they're all shaped
[1:29:07] they're all cut they're all adapted to
[1:29:09] where they're going to be amen they're
[1:29:11] sized down and trimmed exactly to where
[1:29:13] they're supposed to fit so I went
[1:29:14] through YouTube
[1:29:16] and I looked it up and what's the first
[1:29:18] thing that the man does the artist does
[1:29:20] the master artist does is he says show
[1:29:22] me what it's got to fit
[1:29:25] and he says show me your window give me
[1:29:27] your dimensions and he takes it and then
[1:29:29] he sketches out
[1:29:30] the whole thing he gathers all the
[1:29:33] dimensions he knows where it's got to
[1:29:34] fit he knows how it's got to be so that
[1:29:36] he can put it right in perfectly when
[1:29:38] it's all said and done amen and then he
[1:29:40] sketches it up and he draws the design
[1:29:42] first he never starts cutting glass he
[1:29:45] has a design first there's an
[1:29:46] intelligence behind what he's going to
[1:29:49] do he's got an image in his mind he
[1:29:51] looks at what he has to work with and
[1:29:52] then he looks at into his mind and he
[1:29:54] says this is what I think is going to
[1:29:56] look beautiful and he comes up with it
[1:29:57] and he's going there amen and only the
[1:30:00] master artist at this point knows what
[1:30:01] this image is going to look like nobody
[1:30:03] knows all they know is we got a spot
[1:30:05] put something beautiful in it he comes
[1:30:08] up with it amen and so then he'll take
[1:30:10] and this you'll see there are many
[1:30:11] panels
[1:30:13] and each of those panels is going to be
[1:30:14] an individual piece of work
[1:30:16] but together they're going to form a big
[1:30:18] piece
[1:30:19] but even within the smaller panels you
[1:30:21] have very tiny pieces of glass it's the
[1:30:23] individual pieces of the image
[1:30:25] so after that's done now he takes it and
[1:30:28] he starts to sketch out what this whole
[1:30:30] big thing is going to look like and this
[1:30:31] is supposed to be the Tree of Life
[1:30:33] and he says this is what it's going to
[1:30:35] look like but you're going to have to
[1:30:36] break it down into smaller elements into
[1:30:39] bite-sized pieces into individual sized
[1:30:41] pieces for this to look the way that
[1:30:43] it's supposed to look
[1:30:44] amen they're going to have to fit in a
[1:30:46] certain way and so he sketches it all
[1:30:48] out and you can see where he's starting
[1:30:49] to put in some breaks and put in some
[1:30:51] lines of where the glass pieces are
[1:30:53] going to be cut but notice not a single
[1:30:56] one of those pieces looks exactly the
[1:30:57] same
[1:30:58] there's not one piece of glass in there
[1:30:59] that's exactly the same as the one next
[1:31:01] to it
[1:31:02] it's all individually decided by the
[1:31:04] master artist what it's going to look
[1:31:05] like
[1:31:06] then what does he do
[1:31:07] he starts to color it
[1:31:09] he starts to add detail
[1:31:12] what is it it's all coming out of his
[1:31:13] mind being put on paper now and this is
[1:31:16] just a small piece of paper this one
[1:31:17] looks to be maybe you know two foot by a
[1:31:19] foot maybe something like that and he
[1:31:21] starts to colorize he starts to add in
[1:31:22] all the detail because he's got to
[1:31:24] produce a Perfect Image in front of him
[1:31:26] before he can produce it in reality
[1:31:30] you understand where I'm coming from
[1:31:33] remember in the beginning was the word
[1:31:35] the word was with God the Word was God
[1:31:38] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:31:39] Us and now the word is being expressed
[1:31:41] again isn't it there has to be a master
[1:31:43] design there has to be somebody that's
[1:31:45] coming up with the details we don't get
[1:31:48] to choose the details he gets to choose
[1:31:50] the details
[1:31:51] then as soon as he has this you'll
[1:31:53] notice now he's got all the cuts in
[1:31:55] there and he's got all the different
[1:31:56] pieces in each of those pieces is going
[1:31:58] to be a certain shape it's going to be a
[1:31:59] certain color to fit in a certain place
[1:32:01] to produce a certain part of the image
[1:32:05] and only after he's done this
[1:32:08] they start designing those individual
[1:32:10] pieces of glass then when that's all
[1:32:12] done
[1:32:13] this is what he's got
[1:32:16] that's what it's going to look like this
[1:32:18] isn't 100 done but he's gone through
[1:32:20] variations he's produced it he's he's
[1:32:22] gone through a process to produce it
[1:32:24] perfectly remember in the scripture
[1:32:27] in Genesis it says in God saw that it
[1:32:30] was good God saw it was good God saw
[1:32:33] that it was good and then when it was
[1:32:34] all put together it says God saw that it
[1:32:36] was very good this is what's happening
[1:32:39] here it's good it's good it's good he's
[1:32:41] coming forward he's coming forward he's
[1:32:43] coming forward but he's trying to get a
[1:32:44] place of very good
[1:32:46] so now he's got the whole template he's
[1:32:47] got the whole pattern
[1:32:49] and what's he got to do next
[1:32:52] now he puts it in life size
[1:32:57] this is something like 12 feet long
[1:33:00] by five feet wide and it's all drawn
[1:33:03] perfectly to scale
[1:33:04] because what's going to happen next is
[1:33:07] he's going to take those pieces of glass
[1:33:09] and he's going to lay them down and
[1:33:11] compare them to the life-size template
[1:33:16] all he's doing is he's taking that glass
[1:33:18] down and he lays it right over top and
[1:33:21] he cuts it exactly the way the template
[1:33:23] says it has to be
[1:33:25] he doesn't freehand it
[1:33:28] he doesn't say oh it's roughly this size
[1:33:30] so I'm just going to cut it out he lays
[1:33:32] it up against the template and then he
[1:33:34] starts to cut it
[1:33:37] okay
[1:33:38] he's laying that glass right on that
[1:33:40] piece
[1:33:41] he's got the life-size template he's got
[1:33:42] the word there
[1:33:44] and he's cutting the individuals to
[1:33:46] match what the word says about them
[1:33:49] each and every one of them
[1:33:51] but I want you to understand something
[1:33:53] if you're a piece of glass in this
[1:33:55] situation
[1:33:56] you don't know if you're going to be
[1:33:57] thrown away or you're going to be placed
[1:34:00] in the draw in the in the final image
[1:34:01] you don't know it only he knows it
[1:34:05] only he knows it
[1:34:07] and let me tell you this
[1:34:09] he may throw away a piece of glass and
[1:34:11] lay it aside for a while
[1:34:13] and then he'll come up to one of these
[1:34:14] little odd shaped pieces and he'll take
[1:34:16] that little Castaway piece he'll say
[1:34:18] look I can make something beautiful out
[1:34:20] of this little piece that I thought
[1:34:21] didn't fit anywhere
[1:34:22] he knew that's why he laid it aside he
[1:34:25] laid it aside he did not throw it out he
[1:34:27] laid it aside for a while
[1:34:29] knowing he had a portion that he could
[1:34:32] use that for
[1:34:34] Rahab was one of those things that was
[1:34:36] laid aside
[1:34:38] Joseph
[1:34:39] he was a big piece and God was working
[1:34:41] on him all along
[1:34:43] but only the artist knows who's going in
[1:34:46] and who's staying out
[1:34:48] and each of those pieces not a one of
[1:34:50] them looks the same amen so I can look
[1:34:52] at you and say you're too small
[1:34:55] you're shaped weird
[1:34:57] come from a different culture come from
[1:34:59] a different Church come from a different
[1:35:01] background you sing different you play
[1:35:03] different you look different
[1:35:05] you act different
[1:35:07] no he's shaping you for your place and
[1:35:10] he's shaping me for my place
[1:35:12] remember Paul would say when he's
[1:35:13] talking about the body says can the hand
[1:35:15] you know the eyes say to the hand you're
[1:35:16] not an eye therefore you're no good no
[1:35:18] no without you
[1:35:20] in your little odd-shaped portion and
[1:35:22] without me and my little odd shaped
[1:35:24] portion the image is not perfect and
[1:35:26] it's not whole
[1:35:29] but if you've ever tried to work with
[1:35:30] glass I don't know if anybody's tried to
[1:35:31] cut glass
[1:35:33] it's very difficult
[1:35:34] because glass likes to crack in straight
[1:35:37] lines
[1:35:39] so when you're doing what he's doing
[1:35:41] here this is the easy part but when he
[1:35:43] gets to the curb part do you know what
[1:35:44] they do
[1:35:45] they place it in water
[1:35:48] and they can literally use scissors and
[1:35:50] they can cut it because the water
[1:35:51] dampens the vibrations that would cause
[1:35:52] the glass to crack
[1:35:54] and when they're put in water
[1:35:56] when they're Washed by the Water
[1:35:58] now he can shape them
[1:36:00] when he can keep them under
[1:36:02] the washing of the water of the word he
[1:36:04] can form them into any shape he wants he
[1:36:06] can do teardrops he can do hearts
[1:36:09] he can do petals on a flower
[1:36:11] he can do anything he wants to shape
[1:36:13] something that would have broken
[1:36:14] otherwise if he can get them under the
[1:36:16] water of the word he can shape them into
[1:36:18] a perfect shape that you think is
[1:36:20] impossible for that piece of life that
[1:36:24] piece of glass amen
[1:36:26] once they're all cut
[1:36:29] he takes them and he fits them together
[1:36:31] and he paints them
[1:36:35] some of us get details early on in life
[1:36:37] don't we
[1:36:38] I look at brother Gerald
[1:36:40] yo he was a preacher from the I think
[1:36:42] from the moment he came out of the womb
[1:36:44] how many of us went to school with a
[1:36:46] Bible under our arms why God started
[1:36:49] working on him really early because he
[1:36:50] was a special portion he was a special
[1:36:52] vessel brother Tim pru was telling me
[1:36:54] the same thing he got baptized he was
[1:36:57] saved when he was five
[1:36:58] got the Holy Ghost when he was five
[1:37:00] Church
[1:37:01] and started preaching when he was 15.
[1:37:03] these are men
[1:37:05] and there's women that have it too God
[1:37:07] starts working on them early in life and
[1:37:09] they get the details colored in they can
[1:37:11] start to see maybe what their part is
[1:37:12] than the rest of us I told brother Tim I
[1:37:15] said God started working on you at five
[1:37:16] he started on me when I was 35.
[1:37:19] started working on me when I was 17 to
[1:37:20] get my heart but in terms of ministry I
[1:37:21] was 35.
[1:37:23] I said you got a 20-year jump on me
[1:37:26] how do you make up something like that
[1:37:27] you can't do it why because he's built
[1:37:29] for a certain place some pieces are
[1:37:31] bigger some people pieces are fancier
[1:37:33] some of them have more detail they have
[1:37:35] more Beauty
[1:37:36] some of us are just a single color piece
[1:37:38] of glass
[1:37:39] because they don't always paint the
[1:37:41] glass sometimes they just work with
[1:37:42] colored pieces of glass and they do it
[1:37:43] that way
[1:37:44] some of us are just a little piece
[1:37:47] but we're a piece nonetheless
[1:37:49] they start to paint it and all they're
[1:37:51] doing they're laying it all together and
[1:37:52] it's temporarily held there and they
[1:37:54] paint all the pieces and then they take
[1:37:56] them off and they fire them
[1:37:58] and what are they doing they're they're
[1:38:00] locking in the colors this is who you
[1:38:02] are this is what you are
[1:38:05] it's your adoption process
[1:38:07] and then what happens is he takes them
[1:38:09] he places them down and he starts to fit
[1:38:12] them into an entire body
[1:38:14] he puts you in your position he puts me
[1:38:16] in my position he puts this one in that
[1:38:18] one and he puts them all in and what
[1:38:19] does he use he uses lead
[1:38:21] why because lead is soft lead won't
[1:38:23] break the glass
[1:38:25] being fitted into position won't break
[1:38:26] your church
[1:38:28] he holds Us in the palm of his hands
[1:38:30] he's not going to break us with what
[1:38:31] he's doing with us but the position he's
[1:38:33] placing Us in and he puts it all in
[1:38:36] now you say that looks like it's just
[1:38:37] about done and it is but the problem is
[1:38:40] it's not all tied together yet it's just
[1:38:42] pieces of lead there and after that what
[1:38:45] does he have to do
[1:38:47] he has to solder it so the entire thing
[1:38:49] has to become a solid unit
[1:38:51] it's all connected you can't get out now
[1:38:53] you're in the body you're in the image
[1:38:55] of Christ amen and then after that's
[1:38:57] done they do something called cementing
[1:39:01] and they take cement not cement like we
[1:39:04] would pour for a house but a different
[1:39:05] kind of cement and it's gritty and it's
[1:39:07] but it's fine in a way and what they do
[1:39:09] is they rub it all over that window and
[1:39:11] they shove it into all the nooks and
[1:39:12] crannies because there's gaps
[1:39:15] and what they have to do is they have to
[1:39:16] make it weatherproof they have to make
[1:39:18] it waterproof they have to make it
[1:39:19] windproof and so what they do is they
[1:39:21] take a dirty situation
[1:39:23] they take hard times and they rub it
[1:39:25] into those cracks and what does it do it
[1:39:27] fills in all of the gaps so that glass
[1:39:30] can't rattle so it'll hold steady in the
[1:39:32] wind and in the storms so that nothing
[1:39:34] can break through
[1:39:36] sometimes it takes messy situations to
[1:39:38] draw us together
[1:39:39] sometimes God's got to got to work with
[1:39:41] us in ways that we really don't think is
[1:39:43] appropriate
[1:39:44] what is he doing he's trying to fill us
[1:39:46] with something that'll Hold Us steady
[1:39:48] it's got to be the love of God it's got
[1:39:50] to be the Holy Ghost itself amen but
[1:39:52] sometimes it doesn't feel so comfortable
[1:39:53] but when that's done then they wash them
[1:39:55] all over again and it is now perfect
[1:39:59] and they take it from there
[1:40:00] and they're taken to their final
[1:40:02] installation this is a different one
[1:40:03] because he didn't have a picture of the
[1:40:04] final one before but then everything is
[1:40:06] installed and you can finally see what
[1:40:09] he was doing all along
[1:40:11] that one piece of glass that's just a
[1:40:13] tiny little portion there had no clue
[1:40:15] how it fit into the big picture until
[1:40:17] things really started coming together
[1:40:19] and you started to praise the Lord and
[1:40:21] say I'm a part of the family of God he's
[1:40:23] got a plan he's got a purpose all that
[1:40:25] time all that cutting all that shaping I
[1:40:28] used to be so big and now I'm just a
[1:40:29] little piece yes but you're his perfect
[1:40:32] piece you're exactly what he wanted you
[1:40:34] to be amen we can see in our lives how
[1:40:36] God has formed Us and how he shaped Us
[1:40:38] in its first specific size and purpose
[1:40:40] but we don't always see the end purpose
[1:40:42] until the end or until very near the end
[1:40:45] and we've gone through all these things
[1:40:47] and we've gone through trials we've gone
[1:40:48] through troubles and you say it's just a
[1:40:50] small part brother Branham says God will
[1:40:52] train a man for 15 minutes of service
[1:40:55] use them all as I plan with them all his
[1:40:57] life work with them all his life for 15
[1:40:59] minutes and then he'll throw them off
[1:41:01] now throw him off you're done your part
[1:41:04] you've done your part and then some
[1:41:05] people he starts with at the age of five
[1:41:08] going to school with a Bible under their
[1:41:09] arm
[1:41:10] but that's his choice not ours but each
[1:41:12] one of us he's working with us amen
[1:41:15] I'm reminded of the thief on the cross
[1:41:18] this will be as we start to close
[1:41:21] we're talking about broken roads
[1:41:24] let me show you the worst Road you could
[1:41:26] possibly see
[1:41:28] there's a man that in all probability
[1:41:29] was born into a poor family
[1:41:32] poor character
[1:41:34] poor Church attendance
[1:41:37] he's encouraged in lawlessness he does
[1:41:40] things wrong and they encouragement
[1:41:41] they're proud of it he maybe gets into a
[1:41:43] bad Circle a bad group of friends these
[1:41:45] different things and everything's
[1:41:47] building on top of it and pretty soon
[1:41:49] he starts to thieve
[1:41:52] and he's encouraged in it and he's
[1:41:54] allowed to do it and he goes along for a
[1:41:56] while and he's worthy of death the
[1:41:58] entire time
[1:41:59] but he doesn't get caught until he gets
[1:42:01] caught
[1:42:03] and then he's he's gone through the
[1:42:05] court system and they try him and they
[1:42:07] find him guilty and they sentence him to
[1:42:09] death by crucifixion which was the worst
[1:42:11] way to die because it often took days
[1:42:14] of hanging there in agony
[1:42:17] what he did church was so horrible that
[1:42:19] they said you got to die for it
[1:42:21] maybe he murdered someone in one of his
[1:42:23] thieves in one of his attempts of
[1:42:25] robbery or something like that we don't
[1:42:26] know the scripture silent on it but he
[1:42:28] had lived the life of a criminal his
[1:42:30] entire life
[1:42:32] can you imagine his mother
[1:42:35] and she's looking at him
[1:42:37] just like Mary was looking at Jesus and
[1:42:39] she's looking at him and she's mourning
[1:42:40] what's happening but for a different
[1:42:42] reason perhaps she could have stopped it
[1:42:44] now she's looking at him and he's on the
[1:42:47] Cross Church he is Bound for hell
[1:42:50] he's Bound for hell for his sin
[1:42:53] he knows he deserves it
[1:42:56] in fact he admits
[1:42:58] he admits he deserves it and that's the
[1:43:00] first moment that he took a step towards
[1:43:03] God was he said I deserve everything I'm
[1:43:05] do I'm getting you deserve it as well
[1:43:07] his fellow Thief he says we deserve it
[1:43:09] we did wrong he says he didn't do a
[1:43:11] thing
[1:43:13] but God rich in Mercy
[1:43:17] put himself on a cross
[1:43:20] right next to him
[1:43:22] so he could ask for mercy so he could
[1:43:25] stand up for the word of God do the only
[1:43:28] right thing perhaps he'd ever done in
[1:43:29] his life stand up and what defend
[1:43:32] righteousness
[1:43:34] say he doesn't deserve it
[1:43:37] all those priests all the ministry all
[1:43:39] the people they said he deserves to die
[1:43:41] and a criminal
[1:43:43] a criminal hanging on a cross
[1:43:46] stands up for the Messiah and says he
[1:43:49] has done nothing wrong
[1:43:52] Church
[1:43:54] you're always a child of God
[1:43:57] that was a child of God from start to
[1:44:00] finish
[1:44:01] and yet he lived a life of crime worthy
[1:44:04] of death
[1:44:06] but in the last few hours of his life
[1:44:09] he did one thing
[1:44:10] he asked for mercy
[1:44:12] he said Lord when you get your kingdom
[1:44:14] remember me and what did Jesus say today
[1:44:19] thou shall be with me in Paradise
[1:44:22] look at that line who knows maybe he was
[1:44:25] 30 years old 40 years old
[1:44:27] in six hours
[1:44:29] he went from Bound for hell
[1:44:31] to sitting in Paradise
[1:44:33] and he had a short walk he had a short
[1:44:35] stay because in three days Christ comes
[1:44:37] and empties it all out
[1:44:41] what did he ever do
[1:44:45] a completely broken road Unworthy of
[1:44:49] anything
[1:44:50] and yet a child of God buried deep
[1:44:52] inside there and when the choice came he
[1:44:54] made the right choice at the very end
[1:44:57] and he went to Paradise
[1:45:01] we look sometimes at people we look at
[1:45:03] kids that are out in the world we look
[1:45:05] at Family relatives that have forsaken
[1:45:07] this message that have gone Godless and
[1:45:09] we say how can God do it
[1:45:12] that was a hopeless situation he is
[1:45:15] hours away from Death he's condemned to
[1:45:16] die and yet God rich and mercy reached
[1:45:20] over his hand and said hello son
[1:45:23] I've been looking for you
[1:45:27] God knows how to put us
[1:45:30] in a position
[1:45:31] to get his mercy and his grace and his
[1:45:35] love and his salvation
[1:45:37] don't ever say
[1:45:39] it's too far
[1:45:41] don't ever say it's too far
[1:45:44] look at Saul I read something the other
[1:45:45] day the Apostle Paul he was Saul when he
[1:45:48] was persecuting
[1:45:50] and it said the first people to welcome
[1:45:52] Paul into Paradise were the ones that he
[1:45:55] put there
[1:45:58] persecuted and killed the True Church of
[1:46:00] God and he made him the prophet of the
[1:46:02] age
[1:46:03] that's what God can do amen with a
[1:46:05] broken road amen
[1:46:07] I don't think we have any broken
[1:46:08] prostitutes here this morning
[1:46:11] but if by chance you are
[1:46:14] look what God can do with that
[1:46:16] bad decisions
[1:46:18] bad roads
[1:46:19] turned her into a child of God put her
[1:46:21] in the natural lineage of Christ amen
[1:46:24] maybe we're Jonas this morning and we're
[1:46:25] disobeying and we know we're doing
[1:46:27] things we ought not to we're running
[1:46:28] from the presence of God
[1:46:31] he's still got us
[1:46:33] you can't run from the presence of God
[1:46:34] if you're a child he'll get you
[1:46:35] eventually
[1:46:37] listen to this
[1:46:39] well Bram says this he says here is
[1:46:40] something to console us here is
[1:46:43] something that encourages out of
[1:46:45] weakness and humility God chooses the
[1:46:48] people to build his kingdom out of if we
[1:46:50] ever get to heaven if we ever stand in
[1:46:52] the presence of God with his church
[1:46:53] we'll stand in a bunch of people that's
[1:46:56] been weak and rejected and cast out by
[1:46:58] the world and know it nothings isn't it
[1:47:01] strange that God likened us to sheep as
[1:47:03] sheep is the most helpless thing there
[1:47:05] is there's nothing so insufficient of
[1:47:07] Defense than the Sheep a rabbit can run
[1:47:09] a squirrel can get in a tree a dog can
[1:47:11] bite a lion can tear a horse can kick a
[1:47:12] bird can fly but a sheep stands helpless
[1:47:15] he says that's the way God wants us
[1:47:17] realize that we are totally insufficient
[1:47:20] and then God takes that person and
[1:47:23] begins to mold himself into that person
[1:47:26] makes his hands do what God's hand God
[1:47:29] would have hands to do makes his lips
[1:47:31] speak what God's lips would speak
[1:47:33] because they're not his they're Gods he
[1:47:35] begins to build a character begins to
[1:47:38] take this weakness and to make his own
[1:47:41] self
[1:47:42] the natural lineage of Christ is a
[1:47:44] virtual who's who a broken lost shameful
[1:47:48] filthy out of the Covenant people
[1:47:52] nothing natural about the natural
[1:47:54] lineage of Christ would say this is
[1:47:56] where the Royal King's going to come
[1:47:57] from that the Messiah is come down this
[1:47:59] amen
[1:48:00] and even the ones that are in it that we
[1:48:01] look at as Heroes of the faith had a lot
[1:48:04] of bumps and bruises
[1:48:05] Abraham's road is full of Curves and
[1:48:08] deviations and side roads and unbelief
[1:48:11] and unfaithfulness and bad decisions and
[1:48:14] wrong decisions and walking away from
[1:48:15] God
[1:48:17] Moses got himself in trouble by trying
[1:48:19] to get ahead on the road
[1:48:21] he put his foot down
[1:48:24] he said I want to get where God wants me
[1:48:25] to get and he took himself completely
[1:48:27] out of the will of God Jacob was a
[1:48:29] cheater a liar and a shyster
[1:48:32] that was his very nature until God got a
[1:48:35] hold of him
[1:48:37] and yet he's he's what one of the three
[1:48:39] fathers of the faith that we talk about
[1:48:40] amen and each one of those God got him
[1:48:43] to the place where they either said I
[1:48:44] can't do it or I'm sick of trying it
[1:48:48] and then God finally started to work and
[1:48:50] mold and shape and produce his word amen
[1:48:54] Jeremiah 29 says this and this is God
[1:48:56] speaking to the children of Israel about
[1:48:58] their time coming out of Babylon he says
[1:49:00] for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:49:02] towards you saith the Lord they're in
[1:49:04] they're in slavery
[1:49:06] they're in slavery and this is God's
[1:49:08] thoughts he says their thoughts of peace
[1:49:10] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:49:12] end
[1:49:13] they're in slavery he says but you're
[1:49:15] going to come out
[1:49:16] you're in a foreign land where they
[1:49:19] serve foreign Gods but I'm going to
[1:49:20] bring you back and I'm going to restore
[1:49:21] Worship in the temple
[1:49:23] he says then shall you call upon me and
[1:49:25] ye shall go and pray unto me and I will
[1:49:26] hearken unto you and ye shall seek me
[1:49:29] and find me
[1:49:31] they would seek him all the 70 years in
[1:49:34] Babylon but in the end someone would
[1:49:36] finally get a hold of him amen when will
[1:49:39] you find him when you so search for me
[1:49:41] with all your heart
[1:49:43] brother Brown says that's exactly what
[1:49:45] God did he made arrangements that you
[1:49:47] should be dressed in a certain way
[1:49:50] now we're thinking oh we're going to be
[1:49:52] dressed in in this and that and the
[1:49:53] other thing we are going to be but how
[1:49:55] do we show up
[1:49:56] he says dressed in a word certain way
[1:49:58] because you remember he said call the
[1:49:59] good and the bad call all of them
[1:50:01] together he's talked about the marriage
[1:50:03] supper he says it doesn't make any
[1:50:05] different what your past life has been
[1:50:07] he says when you got an invitation to
[1:50:09] come you're ready to come
[1:50:12] so whether you are in the streets
[1:50:13] well-dressed or whether you were drunk
[1:50:15] and passed out in the hedges in the
[1:50:17] highways he says it doesn't matter when
[1:50:19] the invitation comes that's when you're
[1:50:21] ready to come
[1:50:23] whether you're on a good part of the
[1:50:24] road or the bad part of the road when
[1:50:26] the invitation comes come
[1:50:28] he says if you have been bad if you've
[1:50:30] been a streetwalker if you've been a
[1:50:32] gambler if you've been a drunkard if
[1:50:33] you've been a murderer no matter what
[1:50:35] you've been if God gives you the
[1:50:36] invitation knocking at your heart he
[1:50:38] will take care of the rest
[1:50:40] don't weary and say well I've just been
[1:50:42] a lukewarm church member he will still
[1:50:44] take care of it
[1:50:46] if you'll just heed that invitation you
[1:50:49] say what is the invitation
[1:50:51] what are the qualifications for this
[1:50:54] invitation
[1:50:56] whosoever will let him come and drink of
[1:50:59] the Water of Life freely he says the
[1:51:01] invitations to whosoever Will
[1:51:05] you know maybe we are believers and I
[1:51:07] believe we are sometimes it feels like
[1:51:09] life's been just knocking us around and
[1:51:11] we're having a lot more knocking around
[1:51:12] than overcoming
[1:51:14] sometimes that's the way it is it just
[1:51:16] seems like we can win it's just getting
[1:51:18] knocked down get knocked down and you're
[1:51:20] going deeper and deeper where's the
[1:51:22] overcoming power where's the overcoming
[1:51:23] faith
[1:51:25] listen to this
[1:51:27] he says the steps of a good man are
[1:51:30] ordered by the Lord
[1:51:33] but I'm going down doesn't matter it's
[1:51:36] ordered of the Lord
[1:51:38] this ain't fun
[1:51:40] it's ordered of the Lord
[1:51:42] we think it's ordered of the Lord when
[1:51:44] everything's going great
[1:51:45] and then things start to go downhill we
[1:51:47] say I must have done something wrong
[1:51:48] what did I do what did I do what did you
[1:51:50] do was you were a Son of God you are a
[1:51:52] son of God and he's working in your life
[1:51:55] he says and he delighteth in his way
[1:52:00] can we Delight in our way
[1:52:02] in the good times praise His name in The
[1:52:05] Bad Times do the same in everything give
[1:52:07] the King of Kings all the praise
[1:52:09] he says now listen to this
[1:52:11] this is a good man this is a good woman
[1:52:13] this is a Believer David is talking
[1:52:15] about here though he fall down
[1:52:20] what does that mean
[1:52:22] s you're going to fall down
[1:52:24] it's going to mean that you're gonna
[1:52:26] feel you fell down
[1:52:28] sometimes we don't fall down but we're
[1:52:30] going down because things aren't going
[1:52:31] the way we want we say we're falling
[1:52:34] he says though he fall down though he
[1:52:37] fall he shall not be utterly cast down
[1:52:40] you've been knocked around get knocked
[1:52:42] down
[1:52:43] he says though you get knocked down he
[1:52:45] says you won't be utterly cast down in
[1:52:46] other words you won't be knocked down so
[1:52:48] bad that you can't get up
[1:52:51] in other words you're never knocked down
[1:52:52] to stay down
[1:52:53] but you're going to get knocked down why
[1:52:57] why do we keep getting up he says for
[1:53:00] the Lord upholdeth him with his hands
[1:53:02] God's holding us up God's keeping us
[1:53:04] moving God's holding them we know that
[1:53:06] that famous uh thought or poem or or
[1:53:09] idea of that man that was walking
[1:53:10] alongside of Christ and he's walking
[1:53:12] along the beach and in the sand and
[1:53:14] there's two sets of footprints and then
[1:53:15] he looks later and there's only one he
[1:53:17] says God where did you go and he says
[1:53:19] that's not where I went that's where I
[1:53:20] that's the place where I carried you
[1:53:22] his hand was upholding us amen even if
[1:53:25] we don't have any strength God won't let
[1:53:27] us stay down he picks us up and he keeps
[1:53:29] us moving he keeps us going forward amen
[1:53:31] he won't let us live in the mud he won't
[1:53:33] let us live in the dirt he won't let us
[1:53:34] live in unbelief he won't let us live in
[1:53:36] a place where we need Deliverance no
[1:53:37] he'll bring us out of it we've got a
[1:53:39] living God
[1:53:41] we've got the same God that Rahab came
[1:53:43] to
[1:53:44] amen I'm the Lord thy God I change not
[1:53:46] it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:53:48] today forever amen he still changes
[1:53:50] lives he still saves souls he still
[1:53:52] delivers he still provides
[1:53:54] and he still takes us down broken roads
[1:53:57] as well
[1:54:00] David would say I waited patiently for
[1:54:02] the Lord
[1:54:03] there's a way to wait
[1:54:05] patiently
[1:54:07] patiently
[1:54:09] he says and he inclined unto me and
[1:54:12] heard My Cry
[1:54:13] now where was David when he did this
[1:54:17] he said he brought me all up also out of
[1:54:20] a horrible pit
[1:54:22] David
[1:54:24] the warrior Prophet a man after God's
[1:54:27] Own Heart said he brought me out of a
[1:54:29] horrible pit
[1:54:31] that's a horrible place
[1:54:33] a smelly place a place where it's so
[1:54:36] deep you can't get out
[1:54:38] the hole is so deep you can't reach and
[1:54:41] pull yourself out then he says out of
[1:54:43] the myri clay that's where you can't get
[1:54:45] your feet out of the mess you're in
[1:54:47] and then he says and then all of that he
[1:54:49] set my feet upon a rock and established
[1:54:52] my goings and he had put a new song in
[1:54:55] my mouth even praise unto our God many
[1:54:58] shall see it and fear and shall trust in
[1:55:01] the Lord
[1:55:03] one last quote program says this he says
[1:55:06] oh there are in all kinds of conditions
[1:55:07] Lord but Thou Art here to make every
[1:55:10] crooked path straight you are here to
[1:55:12] take all the disaster out and put glory
[1:55:15] in hey man let's stand together if we
[1:55:18] would
[1:55:25] you know I look back on my life and many
[1:55:27] of you know the things that I went
[1:55:29] through and my family with me and
[1:55:31] Ministries who sat under and failures of
[1:55:33] men and failures of churches and
[1:55:35] failures of families and
[1:55:37] you know what I happen to believe God
[1:55:39] led me in all of those places
[1:55:41] and then you get into it and things
[1:55:42] start to fall apart or you're not being
[1:55:44] fed or you're not being used and you say
[1:55:46] how can God be in any of this
[1:55:48] how can God bring me to such a flawed
[1:55:51] place with such flawed people or flawed
[1:55:53] situations and people walking away from
[1:55:55] the message and pastors that are living
[1:55:57] a double life and all these different
[1:55:58] things and it's really hard really easy
[1:56:00] rather to look at that and say how can
[1:56:02] that be God
[1:56:03] but yet once he puts you into your
[1:56:05] position
[1:56:06] you can say he had to do that
[1:56:10] he had to do that to teach me a lesson
[1:56:12] he let me learn by somebody else's
[1:56:14] Problems by somebody else's failures how
[1:56:17] to guard myself
[1:56:19] so that in the in the in the future I
[1:56:22] don't make a bigger mess of things so
[1:56:24] that I don't rely on gifts so that I
[1:56:25] don't rely on men so I'm not so I'm
[1:56:27] learning to follow the leadership of the
[1:56:29] Holy Spirit by the word rather than just
[1:56:31] gifts and callings and these different
[1:56:32] things
[1:56:33] to understand that you can't be in
[1:56:36] certain positions without certain
[1:56:37] qualifications
[1:56:39] that not everybody that says Lord Lord
[1:56:41] is a Christian
[1:56:44] they're not everybody that's been
[1:56:45] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:56:47] Christ and says I believe a prophet of
[1:56:49] Malachi 4 is actually a True Believer
[1:56:53] that not every church is perfect
[1:56:55] in fact no church is perfect
[1:56:59] to drive it home that what
[1:57:02] all of these things are shaping you
[1:57:05] for your final purpose
[1:57:07] and going through it you sit there and
[1:57:09] you say this is horrible I want out it's
[1:57:11] no good I'm not enjoying it
[1:57:14] The Cutting and shaping is never fun
[1:57:16] but it's always for purpose
[1:57:18] and what feels like a broken road is
[1:57:21] really his perfect will
[1:57:22] to put us in that place in the image of
[1:57:25] Christ the word expressed for this day
[1:57:27] amen
[1:57:28] let me encourage you this morning
[1:57:30] if you're tired of where you're at
[1:57:33] wait patiently
[1:57:36] check your heart check it up with the
[1:57:38] word by all means we look to our lives
[1:57:39] and we ought to say Lord is this because
[1:57:41] I'm doing something wrong am I off am I
[1:57:45] away am I separated
[1:57:47] am I dabbling in things I ought not to
[1:57:50] but if our conscience truly comes back
[1:57:52] clear then we ought like David we ought
[1:57:54] to be able to wait patiently for the
[1:57:56] Lord and he'll take us out of wherever
[1:57:58] we are with purpose
[1:58:00] always with purpose all things work
[1:58:02] together for our good amen let's bow our
[1:58:05] heads Heavenly Father
[1:58:10] Lord you do all things well
[1:58:12] Lord and we're here to confess it by
[1:58:14] faith this morning Lord that we believe
[1:58:15] that all things work together for the
[1:58:17] good
[1:58:18] Lord we see these little chapters of our
[1:58:20] life and some of them maybe are scarier
[1:58:22] or Lord it seems like oftentimes there's
[1:58:25] no purpose in it Lord we look at our
[1:58:27] friends we look at our family sometimes
[1:58:29] and we say Lord where are you but Lord
[1:58:32] we're trusting in your mercy and Grace
[1:58:33] We're trusting in the master artist Lord
[1:58:36] the one that sees the big picture Lord
[1:58:38] that you're trimming each one of us for
[1:58:40] our portion Heavenly Father Lord help us
[1:58:42] to wait patiently Lord help us to wait
[1:58:45] Faithfully Faithfully Lord help us to
[1:58:47] walk in confidence Lord that as you lead
[1:58:49] and guide us you'll work it for your
[1:58:51] perfect good Lord God
[1:58:53] Lord would you just bless and speak to
[1:58:54] your people we pray or Draw us closer to
[1:58:57] you in all these things Lord may we rest
[1:58:59] on the foundation of your word nor may
[1:59:02] we walk by your spirit every day we pray
