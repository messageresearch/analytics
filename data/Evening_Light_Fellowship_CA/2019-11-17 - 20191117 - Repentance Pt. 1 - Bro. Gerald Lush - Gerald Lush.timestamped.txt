[1:00:04] Luke's Gospel chapter 24 and who asked
[1:00:10] the Saints to put sister Rose Gayle on
[1:00:15] your prayer list and Rose Gayle is
[1:00:22] brother Claude Gail's daughter and she's
[1:00:26] living in Alberta she called a couple of
[1:00:33] days ago in fact Friday I believe she
[1:00:37] called and on my cell phone and
[1:00:41] requesting prayer because she's
[1:00:44] suffering from cancer she has
[1:00:48] experienced it in the past
[1:00:49] and we prayed and the Lord has spared
[1:00:52] her and brought her on quite some time
[1:00:55] and so she called to request prayer
[1:00:58] again because certain forms of cancer
[1:01:01] have come back and it's in her left
[1:01:04] thigh and her lymph node in the neck and
[1:01:07] also in her shoulder but it's all on her
[1:01:09] left side and suffering prayer from
[1:01:14] lymphoma so she is in desperate need so
[1:01:18] pray the grace of God for the salvation
[1:01:20] of her soul and the grace of God for the
[1:01:23] healing of her body
[1:01:24] amen God is there to heal us spiritually
[1:01:28] God is there to heal us physically amen
[1:01:32] well really in the eyes of God has
[1:01:34] already done he's asking us to believe
[1:01:36] it so I pray grace to help our sister
[1:01:39] Rose Gayle to believe a man and she
[1:01:44] again thank
[1:01:45] thank me for the funeral service of her
[1:01:48] father brother Claude and she said
[1:01:52] brother I have to be honest because she
[1:01:54] wasn't there but she did hear it by DVD
[1:01:56] and she said brother she said thank you
[1:02:00] she said it didn't seem like a funeral
[1:02:03] service
[1:02:04] so she says thank you she said that you
[1:02:07] you made it that kind of a service well
[1:02:09] I said well it was the Lord and knowing
[1:02:12] that even many of our Pentecostal
[1:02:15] brethren was in the in the field of
[1:02:16] service in the funeral Hall in Deer Lake
[1:02:19] and OH
[1:02:21] amazing and I said Lord I should you're
[1:02:24] with us you're here and a number of them
[1:02:28] had already testified to me and thanked
[1:02:30] me and thanked and they were glad for
[1:02:33] brother Claude's testimony because they
[1:02:36] had fellowship with him and they said oh
[1:02:38] it was just wonderful and they said is
[1:02:41] his faith in the Lord and what he would
[1:02:44] tell them about Jesus and so on
[1:02:46] it made Christ more real to them and
[1:02:49] during the funeral service they they
[1:02:52] said my this is wonderful
[1:02:53] because through them also it just didn't
[1:02:56] seem like a funeral service no because
[1:02:58] he's not dead even we're not preaching
[1:03:01] someone is dead who were preaching that
[1:03:03] dirt they've gone from time to eternity
[1:03:05] a man there out of that body and they're
[1:03:08] gone into earth theophany body and which
[1:03:11] most of the world doesn't even know
[1:03:12] about those things because the world
[1:03:14] still thinks you know it's like when I
[1:03:17] driven past the graveyard and someone
[1:03:19] say I mean he's dead there nobody you
[1:03:21] know what it comes to dead they're all
[1:03:23] dead physically yeah but again during
[1:03:25] another dimension somewhere a man but
[1:03:28] most of the world doesn't know that most
[1:03:30] the world doesn't understand that
[1:03:31] because they thought when a person died
[1:03:33] they buried them that's it
[1:03:35] during degree no brother
[1:03:39] that's that's the sinful body but he's
[1:03:41] going to give him a glorified body a man
[1:03:43] one day he's gonna be ya know he don't
[1:03:45] want that one a man that would that one
[1:03:48] came under a curse a man so I said no
[1:03:51] and he's dead there when it comes to
[1:03:53] that physically he said they're all dead
[1:03:54] but I said they're in another dimension
[1:03:56] and I trust I said that most of them are
[1:03:58] in there
[1:03:59] the dimension that that Lazarus was in
[1:04:01] not the rich young ruler but ladders
[1:04:03] praise the Lord and I must say during
[1:04:06] our brother Klaus funeral I really
[1:04:09] appreciated the support of our
[1:04:11] Pentecostal brethren there and because
[1:04:14] they also were encouraged by the word
[1:04:16] that God was giving him by the spirit
[1:04:18] and the anointing that was in the
[1:04:19] funeral service they just loved it a man
[1:04:22] and I appreciated the fact that a
[1:04:24] Pentecostal pastor had also come to
[1:04:26] prayed during the funeral service and a
[1:04:29] Pentecostal brother there that we're
[1:04:32] familiar with and he was playing the
[1:04:34] piano accordion and he for us and he
[1:04:37] also came up as saying a special and not
[1:04:39] only that they were at the funeral in
[1:04:41] Bishop Falls there at the cemetery so it
[1:04:45] was good and and our brother Claude's
[1:04:48] daughter Rose was really really loved it
[1:04:50] really appreciated it so I pray God
[1:04:52] continue to bless sister Rose Gail so
[1:04:56] remember her in prayer as I said she's
[1:04:58] living in new in Alberta right now the
[1:05:01] grace of God to her amen in st. Luke's
[1:05:05] Gospel chapter 24 and beginning to read
[1:05:09] at verse 45 and then openiy their
[1:05:19] understanding that they might understand
[1:05:22] the scriptures amen that's what we need
[1:05:26] is understanding of the Word of God and
[1:05:29] the and said unto them thus it is
[1:05:33] written and thus it be you Christ to
[1:05:36] suffer and to rise from the dead the
[1:05:40] third day and that repentance a man
[1:05:45] after his death his burial his
[1:05:48] resurrection he says repentance and
[1:05:51] remission of sins should be preached a
[1:05:55] man praise the Lord
[1:05:58] now after his death Beulah resurrection
[1:06:01] it can be preached so he said and that
[1:06:05] again not just remission of sins but
[1:06:07] repentance repentance will lead us to
[1:06:10] the remission of
[1:06:11] and it should be preached in his name a
[1:06:15] man again that's why we went forth into
[1:06:19] water baptism Farrar with a vessel in
[1:06:21] the name praise the Lord and again it is
[1:06:25] a singular name in the name among all
[1:06:28] nations and it's got to be in his name
[1:06:31] beginning at Jerusalem and your
[1:06:35] witnesses of these things
[1:06:37] praise the Lord and the old I send the
[1:06:42] promise of my father upon you but tarry
[1:06:45] in the city of Jerusalem until you be
[1:06:48] endued with power from on high
[1:06:51] god bless his words you may be seated so
[1:06:56] I want to share with you some thoughts
[1:06:58] some scripture other scriptures and
[1:07:00] thoughts on repentance there's make our
[1:07:04] calling and election sure and we've got
[1:07:07] to go back to the beginning we got to go
[1:07:09] back to the beginning of our
[1:07:11] relationship with the Lord a man and it
[1:07:14] begins with the hearing of the word of
[1:07:16] God a man and he opened their
[1:07:18] understanding that they might understand
[1:07:21] the scriptures sir brother begins with
[1:07:24] the word and the word is going to point
[1:07:26] us to salvation the word is going to
[1:07:28] show us and reveal to us what we had to
[1:07:31] do took enter into a relationship with
[1:07:35] the Lord a man and brother it begins
[1:07:38] absolutely it begins with with number
[1:07:41] one it's the conviction of the word and
[1:07:43] the conviction of the word is going to
[1:07:45] lead us to repentance so that what we
[1:07:48] have to do is to make sure that we have
[1:07:50] repented a man not a nun are just like a
[1:07:54] form of godliness brother but it's
[1:07:56] absolutely from our hearts a man and we
[1:08:00] really experience repentance it is an
[1:08:04] experience a man is not a form of
[1:08:07] godliness that you there you're going to
[1:08:08] go through but it's something here you
[1:08:10] experience brother if there's anything
[1:08:12] that we have with the Lord is an
[1:08:14] experience if you've got a relationship
[1:08:17] with God you've got an experience with
[1:08:18] God if you've got a relationship with
[1:08:21] God you experience God
[1:08:23] mother and it begins for the airing of
[1:08:25] the word of God understanding the Word
[1:08:27] of God and then responding to the Word
[1:08:30] of God a man and responding to the Word
[1:08:33] of God this is what they did under day
[1:08:35] of Pentecost this is what the disciples
[1:08:37] did and and brother and Jesus was
[1:08:40] highlighting the the thing that he's
[1:08:41] going to see in his in his elect and his
[1:08:44] sons and his daughters and in his seat a
[1:08:47] man in the children of God
[1:08:49] what's he going to see first he's got to
[1:08:51] see humility they're going to hover
[1:08:54] themselves a man acknowledging their
[1:08:57] need of God they're going to over
[1:08:58] themselves acknowledging their need of
[1:09:00] Christ acknowledging a man their need of
[1:09:03] the word of God a man and it's going to
[1:09:07] lead them to repentance praise the Lord
[1:09:10] so if you're humbled a man and again
[1:09:12] there's a revelation of the Word of God
[1:09:14] that God gives is the revelation of the
[1:09:16] word that is preached and it's and and
[1:09:20] the intended route is to Humble us amen
[1:09:24] it is to humble you because I tell you
[1:09:27] to review to repent you have to humble
[1:09:29] yourself a man
[1:09:30] because without humility there's no no
[1:09:32] real sincere honest heartfelt repentance
[1:09:36] a man and then there are many that this
[1:09:39] meal they come to an altar
[1:09:41] well that's repenting no no there's more
[1:09:43] to it than that brother there are those
[1:09:45] that went to the altar and really didn't
[1:09:46] repent as God wanted them to there are
[1:09:49] those that just set in their seats and
[1:09:51] repented a man and God and God saw it in
[1:09:54] their hearts God saw it in their souls
[1:09:56] that they repented a man and that they
[1:10:00] were born again they'll praise the name
[1:10:03] of the Lord so they had an experience
[1:10:05] with God because they recognize what
[1:10:08] they recognize their need to repent and
[1:10:10] they recognize their need for God by the
[1:10:13] grace of Almighty God so we will get
[1:10:16] into that some other thoughts a man
[1:10:18] so you see you can consider it I want I
[1:10:21] want you to consider ever I repented a
[1:10:23] man and you know well oh yeah I'm in
[1:10:26] church and I take the communion and I've
[1:10:29] been baptized yeah I repented no that
[1:10:32] doesn't mean you repented I said there's
[1:10:34] many there's many in church didn't
[1:10:36] that takes communion does many that do
[1:10:39] this and do that but still they have
[1:10:40] repented amen and we'll get into see
[1:10:43] what what repentance is
[1:10:45] and let's see if you really truly
[1:10:47] repented a man a man and because that's
[1:10:51] the only way that God is going to
[1:10:52] acknowledge you the only got way God is
[1:10:54] going to receive you and that's the only
[1:10:56] way they do to get the Holy Ghost to be
[1:10:58] born again you got every pendens what
[1:11:01] all you know you don't be born again and
[1:11:03] then repent no you repent a man that
[1:11:06] repentance that when it comes to being
[1:11:08] born there there's birth pains a man so
[1:11:12] part of the birth pains is repentance
[1:11:14] a man is really getting yourself down a
[1:11:17] man it's really it's really humbling
[1:11:20] yourself it's really dying to yourself
[1:11:22] by the grace of Almighty God a man so
[1:11:26] that it is it is painful a man to let go
[1:11:29] and let God have his way so what is
[1:11:32] repentance repentance is to change your
[1:11:34] mind
[1:11:34] anybody so now you don't think your
[1:11:37] thoughts anymore it's not your thoughts
[1:11:39] it's not your words it's not your deeds
[1:11:41] it now is God in you amen and repentance
[1:11:45] brings us to this place
[1:11:46] amen repentance brings us to a new
[1:11:49] creature in Christ repentance brings us
[1:11:52] to the place to us again as we say in
[1:11:54] the scripture stairs Paul said is not me
[1:11:57] that lives as Christ liveth in me amen
[1:11:59] brother
[1:12:00] s genuine repentance but again there's
[1:12:03] always that still say that but there but
[1:12:05] but it's not Christ living in them amen
[1:12:08] because they'll go so far but then
[1:12:10] they'll still maintain some of their own
[1:12:12] thoughts some of their own ideas some of
[1:12:14] their own wishes they're gonna do this
[1:12:15] they're gonna do that I want to do this
[1:12:17] I want to do that the Lord won't mind
[1:12:18] this the law won't mind that will you
[1:12:20] don't care you wanna do you want the
[1:12:21] will of God in yet anybody you don't
[1:12:24] want your will anymore you want God's
[1:12:26] will amen so when it comes to your
[1:12:28] decisions your thoughts your words your
[1:12:30] dates
[1:12:31] now if you're born again you've truly
[1:12:33] repented and you got born again it's
[1:12:36] Jesus it's Jesus thoughts
[1:12:38] it's Jesus words a man is Jesus deeds
[1:12:43] it's Jesus motivation in you now not you
[1:12:46] no more it's not what my flesh wants is
[1:12:48] what Jesus wants
[1:12:50] it's not what I would I what I like or
[1:12:52] what I want to do this I want to do that
[1:12:54] I want to go here I want to go there
[1:12:56] what does Jesus want remember it's not
[1:12:58] you that lives no Morris Christ that
[1:13:00] liveth in you amen
[1:13:02] so by pray grace brother that whatever
[1:13:04] your actions and reactions it's Jesus
[1:13:07] she that's why you're on your guard
[1:13:10] amen you're on your guard because you
[1:13:12] don't want to leave the wrong impression
[1:13:14] of Jesus hey not not to Jesus you don't
[1:13:18] want to leave the wrong impression of
[1:13:19] Jesus to the world hey man just say the
[1:13:22] way you act the way you live the way you
[1:13:24] talk amen and your reaction you're
[1:13:27] reflecting Jesus because you're
[1:13:29] professing to be a Christian and what is
[1:13:32] a Christian Christian is Christ like a

[1:14:50] we noticed this this gentleman there
[1:14:54] I'll call him brother and because of his
[1:14:57] attitude nice spirit and yet he was in
[1:15:00] and we're
[1:15:01] this cart and he had this six month old
[1:15:04] child didn't look that all but six my
[1:15:07] little child I said Lord my I said
[1:15:12] that's nice nice spirit I said oh I'm
[1:15:16] wondering who they were so huh
[1:15:18] and so we went over and oh yeah and and

[1:15:26] almost as if we knew him all our lives
[1:15:29] you know and Alma says he knew us all of
[1:15:32] our lives and so on and so we just
[1:15:34] started to talk basic about the child
[1:15:36] and about about you know children and
[1:15:39] fathers and mothers and so on and it was
[1:15:41] amazing I said Lord I said what a
[1:15:43] wonderful spirit they got and again I no
[1:15:46] doubt maybe they looked at us maybe
[1:15:48] looking sister Betty they would consider
[1:15:50] us to be Christian you know some kind of
[1:15:52] a church or whatever but did that they
[1:15:55] weren't offended with those things all
[1:15:57] we entered into a like a fellowship oh
[1:15:59] yeah talking with him and he couldn't
[1:16:02] even enter into a filter with the child
[1:16:04] and the trial all loved us oh look did
[1:16:08] he looking at us and and laughing and
[1:16:10] smiling at us and all lot wonderful and
[1:16:13] then the mother came and at a wonderful
[1:16:15] spirit and I said god bless them I said
[1:16:19] Lord I said maybe according to ISO
[1:16:21] believe us it was your will that we made
[1:16:23] you meet him here it was your will I saw
[1:16:26] that we have cross cross paths there and
[1:16:30] Laura maybe we'll cross paths again I
[1:16:32] said what I said I sense I said there's
[1:16:34] an anointing their Lord and there's a
[1:16:36] spirit there so god bless them
[1:16:37] amen so brothers sister let's reflect
[1:16:40] Jesus amen

[1:16:49] we never got to that but I said lord
[1:16:52] help us to reflect Jesus a right spirit
[1:16:54] and a right attitude a man and brother
[1:16:58] is not and again you can have a right
[1:17:00] spirit right attitude and not Christian
[1:17:02] but you got to reflect the spirit to the
[1:17:04] Christian right spirit and the question
[1:17:07] right attitude is not just go there and
[1:17:09] I'm a Christian so I can't do this I
[1:17:11] can't do that I can't say this no you go

[1:18:19] it amen did we live Jesus did we reflect
[1:18:24] Jesus to that extent so that brother in
[1:18:28] the judgment that God can use me to
[1:18:31] judge that person because I was I was
[1:18:34] representing Jesus and they refused
[1:18:36] Jesus

[1:29:01] he said you just learn a whole lot now
[1:29:04] what brother Vale has said and he said I
[1:29:07] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[1:29:10] once delivered to the Saints but you're
[1:29:13] earnestly content for it earnestly
[1:29:16] morning noon and night amen brother you
[1:29:20] can't get away from the revelation you
[1:29:23] can't get away from the theme of it
[1:29:24] Luther couldn't get away from the theme
[1:29:27] of what God was dealing with in his life
[1:29:29] no way he couldn't get away from it look
[1:29:32] at the sacrifices he made and the things
[1:29:34] that he did to get more and more and
[1:29:36] more and then once the struck him oh
[1:29:40] brother
[1:29:41] oh he was it was getting more and more
[1:29:43] into it and he started to praise God
[1:29:45] more he was praying then he started to
[1:29:48] praise the Lord a man he went from
[1:29:51] prayer to priests a man to lay his life
[1:29:54] down oh yeah he told him he said here I
[1:29:57] stand I can do more no more
[1:29:58] he said the just shall live by faith
[1:30:00] when they stay threatened they're gonna
[1:30:02] kill him and do this and do that and so
[1:30:04] on yeah he's there I stand I can do more
[1:30:06] no more he wasn't gonna
[1:30:08] he wasn't going to compromise so brother
[1:30:10] don't compromise with Beverly don't
[1:30:12] compromise her friends
[1:30:13] don't compromise whatever you do
[1:30:15] remember each we're going to compromise
[1:30:16] with him you're compromising with Jesus
[1:30:19] yeah you cut you off oh yeah you got to
[1:30:25] take your stick
[1:30:25] a man for the truth the whole truth and
[1:30:28] nothing but the truth but now your
[1:30:30] attitude straight your spirit is right
[1:30:32] by the grace of God if you're truly have
[1:30:36] a repentant heart because we're
[1:30:39] repentance comes the right attitude and
[1:30:41] the right spirit with true repentance
[1:30:42] God responds to true repentance a man
[1:30:46] because the Bible says repent and be
[1:30:48] baptized and as the prophet of God has
[1:30:50] said he said that's our steps he said
[1:30:54] that's the first two is ours on the day
[1:30:57] of Pentecost is three repent be baptized
[1:30:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:31:01] Holy Ghost
[1:31:02] he said the third is God steps amen
[1:31:06] but he said it's God responding to your
[1:31:09] faith but there are those who are who do
[1:31:12] repent there are those who are baptized
[1:31:14] in the name but they don't get the Holy
[1:31:15] Ghost because why God doesn't receive
[1:31:18] faith
[1:31:19] it's just religion they're just going
[1:31:22] through just a form of godliness or you
[1:31:25] know just the religious forms or
[1:31:28] whatever yeah that's all but if you're a
[1:31:31] Christian and you got the Holy Ghost and
[1:31:33] it's God in you Rick brought you to
[1:31:36] repentance a man convicted you amen amen

[1:31:57] you acknowledge you need a savior you a
[1:32:01] knowledge that you need Jesus amen
[1:32:03] faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[1:32:06] Word of God praise the name of the Lord
[1:32:09] he opened their understanding that they
[1:32:11] might understand the scriptures and he
[1:32:14] said unto them thus it is written and
[1:32:16] thus they be who Christ to suffer and to
[1:32:18] rise from the dead the third day and
[1:32:20] that repentance and remission of sins
[1:32:23] should be preached amen I mean here
[1:32:29] repentance not many Oh what we're in
[1:32:34] this now so we just preached the
[1:32:35] resurrection rapture yeah but you need
[1:32:37] to remind them of repentance a man so
[1:32:42] that they're gonna make their calling
[1:32:43] lecture Shore and they're gonna get get
[1:32:45] more and more into the spirit of the
[1:32:46] Resurrection the spear the rapture but
[1:32:48] it takes for the spear of repentance to
[1:32:50] bring you into it oh yeah home with

[1:33:01] his name among all nations and your
[1:33:05] witnesses of these things
[1:33:08] amen praise the Lord so brother there's
[1:33:12] there's not many churches and not many
[1:33:14] men preachers today that are bridging
[1:33:16] repentance or having a repentant
[1:33:18] attitude a repenting spirit and so on
[1:33:20] you know all in your relationship with
[1:33:22] the Lord
[1:33:23] anybody and you got that then brother
[1:33:25] you're gonna reflect Christ to family
[1:33:28] friends and neighbors by the grace of
[1:33:30] God so he said I earnestly contend for
[1:33:33] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:33:35] Saints and they got away from it now he
[1:33:38] said man a corrupt mind and so forth had
[1:33:41] come in and beguiled them away from the
[1:33:44] real things of God brother if you're
[1:33:47] repented and you've been born again you
[1:33:50] got a totally different attitude
[1:33:52] different spirit or you were like this
[1:33:54] you were like that but now you're like
[1:33:57] him you're like Jesus you got Jesus
[1:34:01] attitude Jesus spirit Jesus actions
[1:34:03] Jesus reactions yeah oh and in the eyes
[1:34:06] of the again and they're in many cases
[1:34:08] in the eyes of family not all of them
[1:34:10] friends and neighbors you're a fanatic
[1:34:12] you're just a fanatic now not always
[1:34:16] call you that but some well yeah I know
[1:34:19] like my family it's not doesn't call me
[1:34:21] a fanatic but they know that I different
[1:34:23] they know that my self sister Betty is
[1:34:25] different when it comes to our faith and
[1:34:27] what we believe in and so on and and I
[1:34:30] remember one time we're in a family
[1:34:32] gathering and one of the it was a nephew
[1:34:35] of mine then and they were bringing up
[1:34:37] this and there and and I think the
[1:34:39] mother
[1:34:41] was afraid that it might go a little too
[1:34:43] far
[1:34:44] she said that's enough now she said my
[1:34:45] son sheesh you leave those things she
[1:34:48] said and and and move on and so on so he
[1:34:54] changed this conversation oh yeah
[1:34:56] because that's the way they're taught
[1:34:58] that's the way they're is shown to them
[1:35:01] that don't hold anything against Gerald
[1:35:03] or Betty because of what they believe
[1:35:05] oh no and they would invite us if they
[1:35:08] got together for somebody's birthday or
[1:35:10] or for a child or whatever they would
[1:35:13] invite myself and sister Bay that's
[1:35:15] right and another time they called me
[1:35:18] said Oh Gerald she said that we're
[1:35:19] getting together student and it was for
[1:35:21] a certain birthday and I said yes and
[1:35:23] they said oh we were planning to do this
[1:35:26] did you have anything against that would
[1:35:29] that be anything contrary to your faith
[1:35:31] or your religion that's amazing that
[1:35:35] they would call and ask me those things
[1:35:37] before we got there
[1:35:38] oh yeah when they're making the plans
[1:35:40] because they said we wouldn't want to do
[1:35:42] that they said you know and I said well
[1:35:45] I appreciate that but I bet it was
[1:35:47] nothing against me there and so on so I
[1:35:49] I said thank you lord

[1:36:15] attitude and a repented spirit and
[1:36:17] brother is not it doesn't all I repented
[1:36:19] for as he had gone know that that spirit
[1:36:23] of repentance is always with you why
[1:36:25] because we're in this body of flesh amen
[1:36:28] Lord I'm constantly dealing with these
[1:36:32] spirits in in this flesh I costly
[1:36:34] dealing with the the senses of this
[1:36:36] whole body a man and remembers the
[1:36:38] Prophet said this is the devil's
[1:36:39] watchtower up here and he said living by
[1:36:42] the five senses of your flesh but he
[1:36:44] said God's watchtower he said it's in
[1:36:46] your soul and you're going by faith
[1:36:48] alone amen
[1:36:50] you're not going by your failings are
[1:36:51] going by your faith a man
[1:36:53] and he said when the devil comes you
[1:36:54] know up here and he said he's getting
[1:36:56] into your feelings in your senses he
[1:36:58] said the Holy Ghost comes out into your
[1:36:59] spirit easy to drive the devil back a
[1:37:02] man
[1:37:03] oh brother why because you got a spirit
[1:37:06] of repentance God knows that you're

[1:37:20] us repent by the grace of God
[1:37:24] it brings us down to humility humble
[1:37:30] thyself and he said God can only operate
[1:37:32] us when we let him operate a man sister
[1:37:39] that's right
[1:37:39] God can only operate us will mean
[1:37:42] hilarium and there's many times that we
[1:37:44] don't let God control us in this we one
[1:37:48] day God do this we want to God give us a
[1:37:51] is attitude in this spirit in this or in
[1:37:54] this or in that oh yeah oh we go we just

[1:38:36] believers or so-called Christians and I
[1:38:38] said Lord I said they won't let you
[1:38:41] I said controlling to control them they
[1:38:45] won't let you control their attitude or
[1:38:46] their spirit listen brother sister you
[1:38:51] need the power and anointing of the Holy
[1:38:53] Ghost more and more on the joy than you
[1:38:54] ever did especially in these last days

[1:39:01] with this whole nature and the devil is
[1:39:04] using it constantly amen
[1:39:06] oh yes brother I tell you this and as I
[1:39:10] see believers someday no I said Lord I
[1:39:14] said they need the Holy Ghost they need
[1:39:16] to surrender to the Holy Ghost
[1:39:18] why because I see I'm bringing out their
[1:39:20] own their own natural nature of morden
[1:39:23] spiritual nature they got more of the
[1:39:26] spirit of mom and dad and the sinful
[1:39:28] births and everything else than they do
[1:39:31] of the nuber yeah that's the truth that
[1:39:37] is the truth
[1:39:38] so brother re true Holy Ghost repentance
[1:39:42] will bring you into a born-again
[1:39:45] experience so you're a new creature in
[1:39:49] Christ and now you're living by the
[1:39:51] nature of the Holy Ghost the nature of
[1:39:53] God a man and the devil is playing that
[1:39:56] nature
[1:39:56] oh yeah the devil is fighting that
[1:39:59] nature with the Richard which are an old
[1:40:01] nature he wants you to give premise for
[1:40:03] the old nature he'd like you to give
[1:40:05] premise to this your feelings and your
[1:40:07] ideas and your thoughts intellect oh
[1:40:10] yeah brother get wisdom but get
[1:40:13] understanding yeah brother

[1:40:28] let God control from the heart don't let
[1:40:31] the devil control from this no or your
[1:40:33] feeling not by any means and that's that
[1:40:37] is that is the battle and we're fighting
[1:40:38] constantly amen
[1:40:40] oh yeah so brother I trusted that God is
[1:40:45] getting the victory
[1:40:47] in you the victory in made by the power
[1:40:52] of the money of the Holy Ghost what is
[1:40:54] it were and again repent be baptized but
[1:40:59] again do it by faith out of your heart
[1:41:01] and then God give you the Holy Ghost a
[1:41:04] man and person can go and repent be
[1:41:07] baptized but it's not no faith there
[1:41:09] it's just religious knowledge and
[1:41:12] whatever and they're just religious
[1:41:14] people but Satan got more control than
[1:41:16] God but if you did it if you repented by
[1:41:19] the Holy Ghost amen and you humble
[1:41:22] yourself and you will know got baptized
[1:41:25] you really enter what is it you're
[1:41:26] getting more and more and more into
[1:41:28] oneness with Jesus and you're giving
[1:41:31] Jesus more and more control until you
[1:41:34] went out you repented oh yeah lord I
[1:41:36] need to die with you you lay down your
[1:41:39] life for me I'm gonna lay down my life

[1:42:02] reacting does he control you to the
[1:42:06] extent that no matter where you are they
[1:42:08] know you're a Christian you're different
[1:42:11] now god help us
[1:42:15] so he said God could only operate us as
[1:42:17] we let him operate that's the truth yeah
[1:42:22] and you see believers Oh Lord they're
[1:42:29] not born again they're still going by
[1:42:33] their own nature yeah they're yeah what
[1:42:38] the old nature is there yes but to show

[1:46:58] are not not loving Jesus they're not in
[1:46:59] love with Jesus no he's just a picture
[1:47:02] he's just a historical figure he's just
[1:47:06] somebody brother Ben preached about no
[1:47:08] if he I'll tell you this if you're born
[1:47:10] again it's someone you got a
[1:47:12] relationship with a man and it's a
[1:47:16] relationship that's closer than the
[1:47:17] relationship you got with any human
[1:47:19] being it is he got preeminence it's not
[1:47:26] this person that person you got to get
[1:47:28] it for you to have a relationship right
[1:47:30] relationship with them you got ever
[1:47:31] better gotta have a relationship with
[1:47:33] Jesus it's a commission
[1:47:40] after Christ you see to humble yourself
[1:47:44] before him that's really power he said
[1:47:49] you show me a church that's humble show
[1:47:52] me a church that's real humble not
[1:47:56] arrogancy a church just a sweet humble
[1:47:59] church and I'll show you a church that
[1:48:04] has the favour and the power of God in
[1:48:08] it
[1:48:09] amen do we have a sweet church amen
[1:48:17] do we have a humble humble church amen
[1:48:22] and he said that's the thing it takes he
[1:48:25] said humility humbling ourselves before
[1:48:27] God and letting God just work through us
[1:48:30] don't have to make a lot of noise he
[1:48:35] said sometimes the father said he went
[1:48:38] out into the field with his wagon and
[1:48:41] every time he hit a bump it just rattled
[1:48:44] and went on and he said when they come
[1:48:46] back it hit the same for the same bump
[1:48:48] and he said big but now he said when
[1:48:51] they come back he said it was loaded
[1:48:54] amen he said above all things
[1:48:58] it's our individual souls that were
[1:49:02] responsible for before God and he said
[1:49:07] it's you going to heaven it isn't
[1:49:11] whether I go or he goes it's you going
[1:49:14] and you first and you've got to look
[1:49:17] this out and come sweet before the Lord
[1:49:21] oh brother
[1:49:23] a sweet spiritual attitude how many are
[1:49:29] in love with him
[1:49:34] how many love him because listen if
[1:49:37] you're in love with him you're in love
[1:49:39] with one another yeah you love him you
[1:49:44] love one another
[1:49:44] oh yes there finally yeah just think
[1:49:51] that
[1:49:52] that's the serious that is serious don't
[1:49:57] take it as a religious feeling no it's a
[1:50:01] faith by the grace of God and he said
[1:50:07] listen I've always found out that the
[1:50:12] man that humbles himself is the man that
[1:50:14] God exalts and he said when you take a
[1:50:18] person with his chest out and knows
[1:50:20] everything and you can't tell him
[1:50:22] nothing
[1:50:23] he is arrogant and well he said that's
[1:50:27] the person that never gets anywhere but
[1:50:30] you take that person that's unbolts
[1:50:32] himself and walks how amazing you don't
[1:50:43] walk with your head oh no you got trade
[1:50:47] down because I know nothing without him
[1:50:52] he said but that person that humbles
[1:50:54] himself he said they walk he said
[1:50:57] sweetly they have a sweet attitude and a
[1:51:01] sweet spirit sweet motives and sweet
[1:51:03] objectives and so on
[1:51:05] yeah I gave you this quote my brother
[1:51:13] there's a lot more of that message now
[1:51:16] love one another see as he was getting
[1:51:21] very near the end of his ministry he was
[1:51:23] seeing less and less of divine law oh
[1:51:25] yeah more more religious people but less
[1:51:29] baptized with the Holy Ghost he said
[1:51:32] love one another above everything he
[1:51:36] said no matter what the devil tries to
[1:51:38] say he says you're all one big sweet
[1:51:41] group now but remember my warning Satan
[1:51:44] won't let you stay that way and he said
[1:51:47] that sometimes God will let the devil in

[1:57:18] in their shoes praise the Lord
[1:57:20] identifying with them hey man he says so

[1:57:28] field and around the world and seeing
[1:57:31] different people I ought to know a
[1:57:32] little bit about the gate to enter in
[1:57:34] and if you want to get someone with God
[1:57:37] he's a never let an arrogant spirit ever
[1:57:40] come around you don't let no malice come
[1:57:44] in no matter he sure what anybody does
[1:57:47] if they are wrong don't you never build
[1:57:50] up a complex against that person you see
[1:57:54] that what God seeing you yeah yeah the
[1:58:02] easiest thing for us to do is see see
[1:58:03] somebody else's mistakes but it's like I
[1:58:07] like our brother Perry green I'll never
[1:58:09] forget it
[1:58:10] and I got a summer on a cassette tape
[1:58:12] years ago when he was preaching and he
[1:58:14] was talking about who crucified my Lord
[1:58:16] and then he sung that song and he said I
[1:58:20] went by the mirror I looked in the
[1:58:21] mirror and I saw the man that crucified
[1:58:24] my Lord Amen so every time you go by a
[1:58:27] mirror look in you wanna know who
[1:58:30] crucified Jesus you a man he lay down
[1:58:35] his life for us
[1:58:36] a man he laid down his life for for his
[1:58:39] for his sons and daughters he laid down
[1:58:40] his life for his bride praise the name
[1:58:42] of the Lord oh yeah people wonder all
[1:58:46] they could they condemned the Jews for
[1:58:48] killing Jesus they could they condemn
[1:58:50] they know the Romans for killing Jesus
[1:58:51] did this did that no he did that for us
[1:58:54] for me for you yeah and brother when it
[1:58:59] comes to when he on the cross he said
[1:59:01] Father forgive them for they know not
[1:59:02] what they do
[1:59:03] brother I believe he was not only
[1:59:05] referring to just the ones down below
[1:59:07] the cross he was referring to all the
[1:59:09] seed of God a man though because brother
[1:59:13] why because it was frosty he was doing
[1:59:15] what he did for us he was experiencing
[1:59:18] what they experiencing brother it was
[1:59:20] for us that they did what they did to
[1:59:24] Jesus yeah because he had why because he
[1:59:28] was the Lamb of God slain before the
[1:59:30] foundation of the world slain amen
[1:59:34] what for for your sin and mine to redeem
[1:59:37] you to redeem me he voluntarily did it
[1:59:41] that was his love for you and me because
[1:59:44] he he knew we were we had fallen amen
[1:59:47] because of what happened in Eden amen
[1:59:49] and he knew their sons and daughters of
[1:59:51] God he knew that we want to be back and
[1:59:52] he laid down his life voluntarily to
[1:59:55] bring us back the prophet of God said he
[1:59:57] could he could have what he could have
[1:59:59] started all over again
[2:00:00] he could have destroyed Adam he could
[2:00:02] have destroyed either destroyed it all
[2:00:03] and did it start fresh no but he did
[2:00:08] what he didn't allowed what he allowed
[2:00:10] amen
[2:00:11] again it was God's plan purpose and
[2:00:13] patterned a man and what'd he do that
[2:00:16] for because he wanted to reveal himself
[2:00:18] he wanted to reveal his love to us so
[2:00:21] that we would love him
[2:00:24] not because we add - no no he would
[2:00:28] bring out our love for him because of
[2:00:29] his character and to know him is to love
[2:00:33] him you love him because of his
[2:00:36] character
[2:00:36] you love him because of what he did he
[2:00:38] did and so on Lord you do I know you
[2:00:40] didn't have to do it you didn't have to
[2:00:46] do it Lord but you did it because you
[2:00:49] love me if there's any genuine loss is
[2:00:54] the love of God
[2:00:58] human love is here and today and gone
[2:01:00] tomorrow but divine love is eternal oh
[2:01:04] yeah and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:07] is the baptism of divine love
[2:01:10] what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:13] divine love yeah you got the baptism of
[2:01:17] the Holy Ghost but it says God is love
[2:01:20] so if God is love the Holy Ghost is love
[2:01:23] s God in us so you got that's the
[2:01:26] evidence Anthony got the evidence of the
[2:01:28] Holy Ghost how many are manifesting the
[2:01:31] evidence of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:32] don't go say I got the Holy Ghost oh
[2:01:34] good no let them say it amen
[2:01:40] let them see it praise the Lord later
[2:01:43] oh that you're going to reflect my love
[2:01:45] of God's just you're just what it's your
[2:01:47] shoes just your nature now out of your
[2:01:49] soul you know I'm living by the nature
[2:01:51] of the flesh no more controlled by that
[2:01:53] or you're living by the nature of the
[2:01:54] soul controlled by that and a man and
[2:01:58] it's fighting the nature of your flesh
[2:01:59] oh yeah you're in a battle that's the
[2:02:03] battle but he promised to be with us he
[2:02:05] promised to help us he promised
[2:02:07] encourages everybody and when the enemy
[2:02:09] is there pushing this on us pushing that
[2:02:12] honest when it comes to our first Oh
[2:02:14] then the Holy Ghost is there it's
[2:02:16] written now it's written my son thus
[2:02:20] saith the Lord to give you victory
[2:02:22] brother that's how they Jesus overcome
[2:02:26] the devil it is written Satan in his
[2:02:29] temptation not only that when the devil
[2:02:31] was influencing Peter and like I said
[2:02:34] just think
[2:02:36] oh my brother George Smith brought it
[2:02:39] out you know look look oh god chooses
[2:02:42] hey man no God uses all my ears Paul the
[2:02:47] one that killed Christians yeah he had
[2:02:49] kids Christian after Christian after
[2:02:51] Christian killed and he was on his way
[2:02:53] to kill more when God dealt with him and
[2:02:55] he was the he was the messenger of the
[2:02:57] first church age hey man and here was
[2:03:00] Peter and Jesus had more more to deal
[2:03:03] with Peter questions that Peter would
[2:03:04] ask and the doubt that Peter had on the
[2:03:06] unbelief that Peter had and he said the
[2:03:09] deal without a finding you know when
[2:03:10] Peter said this Peter said that he tried
[2:03:12] to stop this try to stop that and Jesus
[2:03:14] said get thee behind me Satan for those
[2:03:18] savers not the things of me of God he
[2:03:19] knew the anointing that was that was on
[2:03:21] Peter not 'enum on him
[2:03:24] amen brothers sometimes we got that
[2:03:27] anointing you experienced that anointing
[2:03:28] a man saying you gotta get me I'd be
[2:03:31] Satan amen
[2:03:32] and you and you need that revelation to
[2:03:34] get power over the enemy it is written
[2:03:36] Satan it is written it is written
[2:03:38] brother as Jesus said it is written but
[2:03:41] after the day of Pentecost Peter was
[2:03:43] saying it is written a man could now
[2:03:46] Christ within Peter and the same defense
[2:03:49] that Jesus use now Peter was using the
[2:03:53] same defense Jesus used now you and I
[2:03:55] going to use it is written the word
[2:03:56] praise the Lord amen so a solution if
[2:04:04] you want to get somewhere with God never
[2:04:06] let an arrogant spirit ever come around
[2:04:08] you no not by any means Lord I'm a
[2:04:11] sinner saved by grace thank you Jesus
[2:04:13] and brother he's there to use you yeah
[2:04:17] because you humble yourself he can use
[2:04:19] you praise the Lord
[2:04:23] he said don't let no malice come in no
[2:04:28] matter you sir what anybody do anybody
[2:04:31] does if they're wrong don't you never
[2:04:33] build up a complex to against that
[2:04:35] person no way no way
[2:04:38] but I've witnessed that for years
[2:04:42] believers would get a complex against
[2:04:44] this one a complex against that one
[2:04:45] against that yo yeah just love them and
[2:04:48] go on thank God for the that Jesus love
[2:04:52] you amen

[2:05:01] he didn't come to condemn has he come to
[2:05:03] redeem us and to encourage us hey amen
[2:05:07] so we're there to encourage one another
[2:05:09] amen to strengthen well like I said the
[2:05:11] Bible does acknowledge the weak
[2:05:13] praise the Lord one derful amen thank
[2:05:16] God for Redemption he acknowledges the
[2:05:20] weak and he said let the strong support
[2:05:21] the weak praise the Lord
[2:05:23] well we think everybody gotta be like me
[2:05:25] everybody got me like this one every
[2:05:26] gotta be guy on this level no no no look
[2:05:29] at that brother look at that sister down
[2:05:31] here maybe and then Jesus said there
[2:05:33] there the weak ones ways to let the
[2:05:34] strong support the weak you're there to
[2:05:37] encourage them and pray for them amen Oh
[2:05:42] glory he said don't you never build up a
[2:05:47] complex against that person you be sweet
[2:05:49] and kind wonderful remember God loved
[2:05:54] you when you were in sin and if the
[2:05:58] Spirit of God is in you you love the
[2:06:00] other person when E is wrong and he
[2:06:03] should just pray for them and love one
[2:06:06] another
[2:06:07] hallelujah Alleluia you're not there to
[2:06:09] condemn listen if the spirit of the
[2:06:12] Redeemers in you you're there to redeem
[2:06:15] you're there to bring them back is there
[2:06:18] to encourage them and lift them up amen
[2:06:20] praise the Lord above everything love
[2:06:23] God and love one another and be humble
[2:06:27] with God and around one another and God
[2:06:30] will bless it and it's hard telling what
[2:06:33] he will do a man
[2:06:36] and usually when a church begins to get
[2:06:37] in numbers and get to getting a little
[2:06:40] bigger or something like that then they
[2:06:42] get away from that real real thing
[2:06:45] amen they do but the smaller we are the
[2:06:48] better we are amen
[2:06:50] why cuz God can deal with us in a very
[2:06:52] personal way
[2:06:53] a man by His grace well sorry didn't
[2:07:02] think I'd be this locked but it seemed
[2:07:04] like only a few minutes but brother what
[2:07:09] is repentance it is to change one's mind
[2:07:14] for the better a man it is to turn from
[2:07:20] one sins to God he said putting more and
[2:07:24] more emphasis on the Lord on God
[2:07:28] repentance like I said you were going
[2:07:30] that way would you turn around amen your
[2:07:34] thoughts are changed your motives and
[2:07:35] objectives have changed everything has
[2:07:37] changed because going that way
[2:07:39] it was natural going this way it's
[2:07:41] spiritual going this way was it was just
[2:07:44] in time but this way is eternal oh where
[2:07:48] you where are you going
[2:07:48] what do you think you go from well this
[2:07:53] way oh I was born over there no where

[2:08:18] brother let's not just not ignore the
[2:08:21] revelation of who we are
[2:08:22] repentance brings us back to God
[2:08:26] a man we're going that way away from God
[2:08:30] repentance turns us around to bring us
[2:08:33] back to God and back to the word back to
[2:08:36] eternity to bring us back home amen

[2:11:56] message but like the prophet of God said
[2:11:59] you got it in your head but you don't
[2:12:00] have it in your heart and he brings that
[2:12:03] out again in this message on Christ as
[2:12:05] the mystery of God revealed god help us
[2:12:08] grace brother brother to repent
[2:12:18] danger mine acknowledging your need of a
[2:12:21] savior and submitting to his thoughts
[2:12:25] his words his deeds submitting to his
[2:12:29] leadership amen
[2:12:34] God's ultimate purpose purpose in saving
[2:12:37] us is to obtain the lordship of our
[2:12:40] lives for the saving of our souls and
[2:12:45] the changing of our bodies
[2:12:48] grace praise the Lord
[2:12:53] repentance brings us into that
[2:12:56] relationship as I was talking to even a
[2:13:00] brother a Pentecostal brother and I said
[2:13:04] brother I said I said many and most I
[2:13:11] said Christians they want Jesus as their
[2:13:14] Savior but I said they don't want him as
[2:13:17] their Lord but I said he is our Lord and
[2:13:22] our Savior he's got to be the lord of
[2:13:26] your life to be the Savior relation a
[2:13:28] man but most just want always my Savior
[2:13:32] Jesus my Savior but he's not their Lord
[2:13:34] you could tell that by the life they
[2:13:37] live on their attitude their spirit and
[2:13:38] what they do and so on no no they're
[2:13:42] doing what they want to do but not what
[2:13:44] God wants them to do no no they don't
[2:13:46] they don't think they got to be
[2:13:48] spiritual like that no but you do and I
[2:13:53] say there's a lot making carnal
[2:13:55] decisions based on the flesh they got
[2:13:59] their reasoning oh yeah
[2:14:02] the reasoning in their mind and their
[2:14:04] thoughts oh yeah I need this I need this
[2:14:06] yeah this is best this is best yeah well
[2:14:08] what's best in the eyes of God and
[2:14:11] what's best in the eyes are gone it's
[2:14:13] not necessarily best in the eyes of man
[2:14:16] God will do this
[2:14:17] not today there's a lot would disagree
[2:14:19] with God they would oh Lord I don't want
[2:14:23] to do this oh Lord I don't want to do
[2:14:25] that Oh Lord if you do that well my lord
[2:14:27] yeah oh yeah make your decision based on
[2:14:31] the Lord's
[2:14:32] revelation is word his spirit is just
[2:14:36] consider the word Oh what did he did for
[2:14:41] Abraham what did he do for Noah and what
[2:14:46] did he do for Moses will we let God
[2:14:50] govern our lives like that well we let
[2:14:54] God do to us what he did to others
[2:14:56] here in the Bible most wouldn't listen
[2:15:04] if God's not in control naturally he's
[2:15:06] not in control spiritually you need we
[2:15:12] need a repent of those attitudes and
[2:15:14] those spirits so brother God's ultimate
[2:15:18] purpose bringing us to repentance to
[2:15:23] Humble us and to what to obtain the
[2:15:26] lordship of our lives for the saving of
[2:15:30] our souls and the changing of our bodies
[2:15:33] and he accomplishes this through the
[2:15:37] preaching of the word penetrating and
[2:15:40] breaking down if we allow him he will
[2:15:45] penetrate and he will break down the
[2:15:47] wall of self-will which endures is
[2:15:51] moving fully in our lives we got things
[2:15:54] we want to do but God got things he
[2:15:56] wants you to do a man self will prevents
[2:16:03] the believer from going beyond non
[2:16:06] saving faith into the realm of saving
[2:16:10] faith where Christ reigns as the Lord of
[2:16:13] our lives so brother self will prevents
[2:16:17] God from taking control amen brother
[2:16:21] brother get let the Holy Ghost take away
[2:16:24] self will hey man are our subjection to
[2:16:27] it are our sense being sensitive to self
[2:16:29] will a man to the will not my will time
[2:16:32] be done
[2:16:32] hey man praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:16:36] brother if you got to make a decision
[2:16:38] talk to the Lord about it
[2:16:41] and don't make NIT water there or he was
[2:16:43] just Church or something no no it's
[2:16:45] everyday living Lord what if what would
[2:16:47] you have me to do what is your what is
[2:16:49] your will what is your leadership Lord
[2:16:51] Amen Lord not my will find be done
[2:16:54] it's amazing that that's the example
[2:16:57] that Jesus set for you and me oh jesus
[2:17:01] said this jesus said yeah but I said he
[2:17:04] went from self will to the will of God
[2:17:06] and brother if we got the Holy Ghost the
[2:17:10] life of Christ in us we got the same
[2:17:12] attitude the same spirit a man so we
[2:17:15] want to get rid of self-will because
[2:17:18] brother
[2:17:19] it'll hinder the saving faith where
[2:17:24] Christ reigns as the Lord of our lives
[2:17:26] amen no no we still want we still want
[2:17:29] to be the Lord of our lives
[2:17:30] oh I'm gonna be the Lord of my life I'm
[2:17:33] gonna make this decision I'm gonna make
[2:17:34] that no he's already made it so he
[2:17:40] brother
[2:17:41] it's the predestinated will of God for
[2:17:44] your life
[2:17:45] oh just save me Lord save you do you
[2:17:51] know what it means to be saved
[2:17:52] Oh Lord are you you're gonna say you
[2:17:55] saved me you did this you did that years
[2:17:57] but he said I want to do I want to do it
[2:17:58] in you yeah I lay down my life no I want
[2:18:02] to get in you and you lay down your life
[2:18:04] yeah hey man so so what so he's gonna
[2:18:08] he's gonna use you what for for the will
[2:18:11] of God amen
[2:18:13] I'm gonna manifest myself in you now I'm
[2:18:16] gonna control you now praise the name of
[2:18:18] the Lord
[2:18:19] most don't believe that they feel that
[2:18:23] God don't want that control oh yeah you
[2:18:25] got to have it all if you want to go to
[2:18:27] glory you want to get into heaven and
[2:18:29] you want to do this you want to do that
[2:18:30] brother well you got to have cool
[2:18:31] control hey man jesus knew that he had
[2:18:35] to totally subject and submit himself to
[2:18:39] to the promise of God to the word what
[2:18:43] for for our Redemption oh yeah he could
[2:18:46] have went on back he could have look he
[2:18:47] said I could call and ask the Father for
[2:18:49] twelve legions of angels to destroy the
[2:18:51] world set him free he could have done
[2:18:53] that
[2:18:54] over again but no for you he stayed
[2:18:59] there for me he stayed there amen
[2:19:04] brother
[2:19:05] so that he would come back to get rid of
[2:19:07] self-will and not my will but the will
[2:19:10] of God to be done and once self-will is
[2:19:15] conquered the word brings conviction and
[2:19:20] conviction leads to repentance and
[2:19:23] repentance will take us further into
[2:19:27] justification sanctification and the
[2:19:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our souls
[2:19:32] and Christ is enthroned as our Lord of
[2:19:37] lords and King of Kings
[2:19:39] a man so I pray God that he is the lord
[2:19:44] of your life and he is the king of kings
[2:19:47] in your heart by grace amen so that it's
[2:19:51] absolutely God in control amen you're
[2:19:55] not in control you're not doing what you
[2:19:57] want to do you're doing what your what
[2:19:59] God wants to do amen and really you have
[2:20:03] submitted yourself to him and to his
[2:20:04] leadership amen
[2:20:06] you've submitted yourself to his
[2:20:08] anointing by the grace of God amen
[2:20:11] will read one scripture we'll bring it
[2:20:14] to a conclusion for this service second
[2:20:18] Timothy chapter two a man second Timothy
[2:20:29] chapter two and there's other scriptures
[2:20:31] that will get maybe the Lord willing on
[2:20:34] Wednesday concerning repentance praise
[2:20:40] the Lord
[2:20:41] second Timothy chapter two and verse 24
[2:20:50] and the servant of the Lord must not
[2:20:55] strive but be gentle unto all men
[2:21:00] amazing
[2:21:02] be gentle unto all men apt to teach
