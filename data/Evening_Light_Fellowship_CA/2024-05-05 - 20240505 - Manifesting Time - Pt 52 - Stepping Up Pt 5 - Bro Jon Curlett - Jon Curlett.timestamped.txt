[45:12] morning the spirit that's in the
[45:14] building this morning God is so good

[45:19] announcement before we preach this

[45:43] whatnot that we can just kind of get

[45:47] we'll have Services Friday night
[45:49] Saturday night and Sunday morning Lord
[45:51] willing amen so certainly thankful for

[45:56] they they have people that and groups
[45:57] that book all the time every year and so
[45:59] they've got to they've got to let all of
[46:01] them have their first opportunities and
[46:03] then we kind of get with whatever is
[46:04] left behind but by God's grace we got
[46:06] the weekend we were looking for so we
[46:08] praise the Lord for that um we don't
[46:10] have a minister just yet I'm I'm just
[46:12] still praying on that and waiting on
[46:13] that there have been some changes to my
[46:15] original intentions so we'll see how the
[46:17] Lord would lead but uh keep those in
[46:19] prayer amen amen it's good to be here
[46:23] this morning Revelation chapter 1 the
[46:24] same scripture we open with on Wednesday
[46:27] says John to the seven churches which
[46:29] are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace
[46:32] from him which is and which was and
[46:34] which is to come and from the seven
[46:37] spirits which are before his throne and
[46:39] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[46:41] witness and the first begotten of the
[46:43] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[46:45] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[46:48] us from our sins in his own blood and ha
[46:51] made us Kings and Priests unto God and
[46:53] his father to him be glory and Dominion
[46:56] for forever and ever amen amen God bless
[47:00] you you can have your seats this morning
[47:02] and we're continuing with our series on
[47:05] manifesting time and I want to take a
[47:06] fifth service on stepping up and we
[47:08] spoke last service quite extensively
[47:10] about the the priesthood side of things
[47:12] and the royal priesthood and we read in
[47:14] the scriptures there that we are priests
[47:16] unto God our services to God but we are
[47:18] outwardly facing to the people that are
[47:20] around us we know that God had a chosen
[47:22] people he had the Levites that he
[47:24] ordained and he anointed and he clothed
[47:27] and he he set them up with purpose so
[47:29] that they could atone for the sins of
[47:30] the people that they could be a mercy to
[47:32] the people they were the ones that had
[47:34] the blood amen and then we talked about
[47:36] how that has come into our lives now and
[47:38] and we are literally brother Bram says
[47:40] the bride is the blood by the spirit
[47:42] amen we are a walking Mercy seed because
[47:44] where the life is that's where the blood
[47:45] is and so we are there to intercede on
[47:48] behalf of those that can't approach the
[47:50] throne that don't know don't know how to
[47:52] come to God they don't even know there
[47:53] is a God and yet they see something in
[47:54] our lives something in our testimony
[47:57] whatever it is and they come to us and
[47:58] they say can you help us can you pray
[48:00] what should I do and these sorts of
[48:01] things and so we intercede and we saw
[48:04] there that our attitude and reaction is
[48:05] one of the biggest things we need to
[48:06] control because if our attitude is wrong
[48:09] we can hold somebody back from something
[48:10] that would help them or save them amen
[48:12] and that becomes so critical it's easy
[48:14] to to be kind and gracious when people
[48:16] need you but what about when people are
[48:18] persecuting when people are giving you a
[48:20] hard time when it's affecting your work
[48:22] and your income and your your family and
[48:24] these different things it's a whole lot
[48:26] more difficult to be charitable in those
[48:27] situations and to show that love and
[48:29] grace of God but we saw that that
[48:31] intercession is greatest when the person
[48:33] doesn't deserve it amen when they're
[48:35] persecuting when they're pushing when
[48:37] they're fighting it but yet we absorb
[48:39] that and we see that Christ did that on
[48:41] the cross of Calvary is that he absorb
[48:43] the punishment he said don't charge them
[48:45] with this they don't know what they're
[48:46] doing charge it to my account I'll pay
[48:48] the price I'll take the pain I'll take
[48:50] the suffering I'll take the persecution
[48:52] only save them give them an opportunity
[48:54] for mercy and Grace amen but we know
[48:57] that this n this gospel is the nature of
[48:58] Grace amen the gospel is first and
[49:01] foremost free it's for whosoever will we
[49:03] know that and ultimately to reject it is
[49:05] to accept judgment but the Judgment
[49:07] comes later amen our judgment to others
[49:09] comes later for now we offer grace and
[49:11] mercy because the blood is still on The
[49:13] Mercy Seat but we want to step into this
[49:15] this this other portion of the scripture
[49:17] and I said last service that if you get
[49:19] the priesthood right you'll get the
[49:20] kingship right because the nature of a
[49:22] priest slides into the kingship as we'll
[49:24] see as we go through these things and
[49:26] we're going to take at least two
[49:27] services on this kingship I believe
[49:29] because I've been studying on two
[49:30] different things simultaneously and it's
[49:32] hard to preach when you've got your mind
[49:33] going in two directions but it's two
[49:35] parts of the same thing and I want to
[49:37] speak about this kingship role perfectly
[49:39] and we read in Revelations 1:6 it says
[49:42] and ha made us Kings and Priests unto
[49:45] God and his father to him be glory and
[49:47] Dominion forever and ever amen it says
[49:50] now we are Kings now we are Kings now we
[49:53] are priests to God Amen we're not made
[49:55] Kings to the people around us we're not
[49:57] Kings to New Finland we're not Kings to
[49:59] Canada we're not Kings to the the
[50:01] nations of this world Amen but we are
[50:03] Kings to God and we are in that role
[50:05] right now today amen if we Are Holy
[50:07] Ghost filled Sons and Daughters of God
[50:09] then this is what God has built us for
[50:11] is to be Kings and Priests to him to
[50:13] serve those that are around us and Jesus
[50:15] said this in 25 because we want to look
[50:17] if we're Kings we have to have a kingdom
[50:20] amen we have to be part of a kingdom and
[50:21] so we need to know our kingdom if we are
[50:23] if we can understand our kingship and
[50:25] and Jesus said this he says when the son
[50:27] of man shall come in his glory and all
[50:29] the Holy Angels with him then shall he
[50:32] sit upon the throne of his glory he says
[50:35] and before him shall be gathered all
[50:37] nations and he shall separate them one
[50:39] from another as a Shepherd divideth his
[50:41] sheep from the goats and he shall set
[50:43] the sheep on his right hand and the Goat
[50:45] but the goats on the left he says then
[50:48] shall the king say unto them on his
[50:49] right hand who the Sheep those are out
[50:52] of his household those that are of his
[50:53] family he says then shall the king say
[50:56] unto them on his right hand Come Ye
[50:57] blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom
[51:01] prepared for you from before the
[51:02] foundation of the world in other words
[51:05] full kingship comes after our time on
[51:07] this Earth and what we get is not a
[51:09] kingdom because we have fought for it we
[51:11] have a kingdom by inheritance amen it is
[51:13] his work it is his provision because it
[51:15] was before the foundation of the world
[51:17] that this kingdom was created for us and
[51:19] we're now being brought back to what was
[51:21] supposed to be ours in the very
[51:22] beginning then we jump to Revelation
[51:25] five amen a and we see the seven seal
[51:28] book of redemption and after that book
[51:30] is opened the book has to be open for us
[51:33] to step into this role we'll see that
[51:36] and it says here that it has and thou
[51:38] Hast made us unto our God Kings and
[51:40] Priests and we shall future tense Reign
[51:44] on the earth amen our our our our rule
[51:47] on this Earth is not now amen over the
[51:49] natural over the elements of the world
[51:51] these different things that is not our
[51:53] Rule now remember what Jesus said when
[51:55] he was here in his first Ministry and
[51:57] he's before Pilate and pilate's talking
[51:59] to him about who are are are you the
[52:01] king of the Jews and Jesus says my
[52:03] kingdom is not of this world my kingdom
[52:07] if my kingdom were of this world then
[52:09] would my servants fight that I should
[52:11] not be delivered to the Jews he says but
[52:13] now is my kingdom not from hence so
[52:16] Jesus Is Telling pilate here he says my
[52:19] servants fight for their Kingdom and
[52:21] they fight for their Kingdom for their
[52:23] King he says but you'll notice my
[52:25] servants aren't fighting for me me why
[52:27] because this is not my kingdom this is
[52:30] not it if it was my servants would be
[52:32] fighting you'd have a riot on your hands
[52:33] you'd have a rebellion on your hands he
[52:35] says but notice nobody's fighting for me
[52:38] why because I'm not a king of this world
[52:40] but notice what he says but now is my
[52:42] kingdom not from hence he says for now
[52:44] it's not of this world but in one day it
[52:46] will come down to this world and it'll
[52:48] be my kingdom instead of Satan's kingdom
[52:50] there's a time and a season for him to
[52:52] rule and Reign and it'll be in the
[52:53] millennial Reign where he rules with a
[52:55] rod of iron as the son of David on the
[52:57] throne of David to give them the
[52:59] Thousand Years of Peace but when that's
[53:01] done that's not his kingdom truly his
[53:03] kingdom is what comes after it that's
[53:06] the son of David rule but then now he
[53:08] comes back and what is he he is Lord of
[53:09] lords he is overall and it's back in in
[53:12] in the Garden of Eden condition again
[53:14] because the Earth is cleansed by fire if
[53:16] we look at Ministries we can see if
[53:18] they're off the word or Not by what
[53:19] kingdom they're fighting for what are
[53:21] they struggling for what is it they're
[53:23] pulling for are they pulling for money
[53:25] are they pulling for influence are they
[53:27] pulling for wealth are they pulling for
[53:29] for all of these things are they trying
[53:30] to take back the country take back the
[53:33] city Take Back The Province we can't do
[53:36] those things it's not in the word that
[53:38] is not our it's not our fight it's not
[53:40] our kingdom we're not here to establish
[53:42] your
[53:43] theocracy that's what the world was
[53:45] supposed to be was one World under God
[53:48] but it's not now and it will never be
[53:50] that way until we come back completely
[53:52] to Christ and so when we look at
[53:54] Ministries we look at them and we say
[53:55] are they looking to to get away from the
[53:57] world or are they looking to control the
[53:59] world are they looking to influence the
[54:01] world or are they looking to get people
[54:02] that want to leave this world you know
[54:04] my wife always says this she says I know
[54:06] that you're part of my people when you
[54:08] want to get out of here amen that's who
[54:11] that's how we identify is that we are
[54:13] pilgrims and strangers here and what
[54:15] we're looking for is other pilgrims and
[54:17] strangers not citizens of this Kingdom
[54:19] amen we've got a a desire to go to a
[54:22] city whose Builder and maker is God Amen
[54:24] that's what we're looking for day by day
[54:26] and so the ministry's work is to find
[54:28] those pilgrims and strangers and say
[54:30] let's get out of here together let's
[54:31] help each other along the way the
[54:33] ministry of this end time is to prepare
[54:35] our souls for a Heavenly Kingdom not to
[54:37] recruit people for an Earthly Dimension
[54:39] that's not what we're looking for Paul
[54:42] says this in 1 Corinthians 7 he says but
[54:44] this I say Brethren the time is short it
[54:47] remaineth that both they that have wives
[54:49] be as though they had none and they that
[54:52] weep as though they wept not and they
[54:54] that rejoice as though they Rejoice not
[54:56] and they that buy as though they possess
[54:58] not he says for they that use this world
[55:00] is not abusing it for the fashion of
[55:03] this world passes away in other words
[55:05] you go into the Amplified it says for
[55:07] the outward form of this present world
[55:10] is passing away so in other words what
[55:12] this world has is dying it's falling
[55:15] away it's decomposing it's bound for
[55:17] Destruction and there's no hope for it
[55:20] and therefore it has to fall in order
[55:22] that Eden can be restored it has to be
[55:24] destroyed so that that perfect Eden can
[55:26] come back therefore we can't hold
[55:28] tightly to it we can't claim it we can't
[55:31] make it a part of our our our
[55:33] inheritance it's not force it's already
[55:35] under a curse there is no coming back
[55:38] from under a curse it has to be
[55:40] destroyed and something has to come up
[55:41] new and it's going to have to require a
[55:43] full Redemption amen Christ's kingdom is
[55:45] not of this Earth and so if we're
[55:47] looking and saying now as adopted Sons
[55:49] and Daughters we're going to be going
[55:51] around claiming this earth that is not
[55:52] it we are not part of that Kingdom we
[55:55] have control and we have we have rights
[55:57] within this world and it has an impact
[56:00] on the physical absolutely it does we
[56:02] know that it does because we've seen it
[56:04] in our own lives amen but our kingdom is
[56:06] not of this Earth and what we're
[56:07] fighting for is not of what is here
[56:09] right now that is not what we are
[56:11] pulling for amen if we are Kings to God
[56:13] then our kingship is in his realm not in
[56:15] a realm of our choosing amen it's a
[56:17] spiritual realm and we see here today
[56:19] that Christ has Authority in this earth
[56:22] absolutely it does because what happens
[56:24] is when Sons and Daughters of God are
[56:25] here God moves in situations God
[56:28] influences things God changes things
[56:31] anden we have prayed for perfect weather
[56:33] for things and we get it we have prayed
[56:35] for provision we prayed for jobs we
[56:37] prayed for uh Grace in the eyes of
[56:40] people we prayed for opportunities and
[56:42] God has given it to us hasn't he God is
[56:45] concerned with the Affairs of the
[56:46] children of this Earth a as they are his
[56:49] children but he is not here to assert
[56:51] his full Authority here he's only here
[56:53] to get his children to the Finish Line
[56:55] that's what he cares about the rest is
[56:57] Bound for Destruction and so he's left
[56:58] it is part of Satan's Eden and Satan is
[57:01] the one that is in control we know that
[57:03] cuz he offered it to Jesus he says I'll
[57:05] give you these kingdoms if you'll just
[57:07] worship me they belong to him all of it
[57:09] belongs to him so our kingdom must be of
[57:12] a different realm and therefore our
[57:13] kingship must be of it and it must be of
[57:15] a different place and a different
[57:16] purpose and it can't have anything tied
[57:18] to this Earthly this Earthly Kingdom
[57:20] that we're here brother Brian would say
[57:22] this he says in Revelation 15:3 it says
[57:25] and they sing the song of Moses the
[57:27] servant of God and the song of the lamb
[57:29] saying great and marvelous are thy Works
[57:32] Lord God Almighty just and true are thy
[57:34] ways Thou King of saints he says do you
[57:37] see it the lamb the high priest holding
[57:40] his blood as an atonement on The Mercy
[57:43] Seat for our sins is the Lord God
[57:45] Almighty he says that is his present
[57:48] office that's why we are priests today
[57:51] amen we're under a mercy gospel he says
[57:53] this is what he's doing now pleading his
[57:56] blood for our sins he says but one day
[57:59] that lamb will become the lion of the
[58:02] tribe of Judah you know we we maybe
[58:05] you've seen this this thing before and
[58:07] people say Only God can judge me we
[58:09] never want to get there because he's a
[58:11] lamb right now he comes back as a lion
[58:13] you don't want to mess with a lion a
[58:15] lamb you can work with a lion he has no
[58:17] mercy it's only judgment under a lion
[58:19] Ministry he says he will come forth in
[58:22] power and glory and take his authority
[58:25] to reign hising King he's the coming
[58:27] king of this Earth of course he says
[58:29] that does not say he's not King now for
[58:32] he is our King he's the king of the
[58:34] Saints right now it is a spiritual
[58:37] Kingdom it's not of this world system
[58:40] even as we are not of this world that's
[58:42] the reason we act different from the
[58:44] world our citizenship is of Heaven amen
[58:47] we don't get caught up in the things of
[58:49] this world as citizens of Canada or as
[58:52] residents of new land that's not where
[58:54] we focus he says we reflect the spirit
[58:59] of the world of our rebirth where Jesus
[59:02] is the king he says that's why are women
[59:04] do not dress in men's clothing or cut
[59:06] their hair or use all those cosmetics
[59:08] and other things that the world likes so
[59:11] much he says that's why our men don't
[59:13] drink and smoke and carry on in sin now
[59:16] catch this he says our Dominion is the
[59:19] dominion over
[59:21] sin our Dominion is the dominion over
[59:24] sin and it is enforced through the power
[59:27] that is in the spirit of Christ that
[59:29] indwells us he says every Kingdom on
[59:32] Earth is going to be torn down but ours
[59:34] will remain our Dominion is what over
[59:37] sin and the power that enforces it is
[59:40] this life of Christ inside of us which
[59:42] is the holy spirit amen amen let's step
[59:45] it up a notch now we're talking about
[59:46] stepping up this morning we're talking
[59:48] about being Kings and we know that Kings
[59:50] have authority Kings have power Kings
[59:52] have armies Kings have resources kings
[59:54] are absolute Within in their Kingdom
[59:57] Nobody messes with a king what a king
[59:59] says happens nobody can go against a
[1:00:02] king amen let's go back to the beginning
[1:00:04] because we'll see there where our
[1:00:06] Dominion is and what we were meant to be
[1:00:08] and we'll take the type and Shadow
[1:00:09] through to where we are today now in
[1:00:11] Genesis God said this he says let us
[1:00:13] make man in our image and after our
[1:00:16] likeness and let them have
[1:00:19] dominion over what the fish of the sea
[1:00:22] over the fowl of the air over the cattle
[1:00:24] over all the Earth and over everything
[1:00:27] every creeping thing that creeps upon
[1:00:29] the Earth see from the beginning we were
[1:00:30] meant to have dominion we were meant to
[1:00:33] be rulers we were meant to be Kings and
[1:00:35] Queens on this Earth that was our
[1:00:37] purpose and we see today that what's
[1:00:39] happened is that man is striving for
[1:00:41] Dominion we have this world and we're
[1:00:43] taking it and we're using it for our
[1:00:45] benefit we have conquered all animals
[1:00:47] there's no animal out there that can
[1:00:48] beat a
[1:00:49] human while we're in our little wimpy
[1:00:52] flesh perhaps but what have we done we
[1:00:53] have made weapons and we've made armor
[1:00:55] and we've made great things that help us
[1:00:57] to have dominion over everything on this
[1:00:59] earth when it comes to any living
[1:01:00] creature we have dominion and we're
[1:01:03] using this Earth for our benefit but
[1:01:05] what is happening in our Dominion is
[1:01:07] what death and destruction that's the
[1:01:09] only thing that's coming out of it amen
[1:01:12] why because it's a broken Dominion
[1:01:14] because we're craving Dominion but we
[1:01:16] lack the holy spirit that they had in
[1:01:17] the
[1:01:18] beginning we lack that perfect character
[1:01:21] that was there and so everything that's
[1:01:23] coming out is what death and destruction
[1:01:26] we think we're making our lives better
[1:01:28] and all that happens is they just make
[1:01:29] it worse it never comes to a higher
[1:01:31] level I was talking with somebody and
[1:01:33] and they're saying you know every every
[1:01:35] year or two what we do is we correct
[1:01:37] what we thought was right speaking of
[1:01:39] World Knowledge and these things and
[1:01:41] then what happens is a couple years
[1:01:42] after that we correct what we thought
[1:01:43] was right and we're constantly
[1:01:45] correcting and adapting our knowledge
[1:01:47] and trying to do what have a perfect
[1:01:49] Dominion but we can't do it we've Fallen
[1:01:52] away we're Fallen
[1:01:53] creatures but what's driving it what's
[1:01:56] driving it is God said let them have
[1:01:57] dominion and so man has something inside
[1:02:00] of him that's craving for Dominion
[1:02:02] that's craving for control that's
[1:02:03] craving for
[1:02:05] Authority but we're going to step it up
[1:02:07] because we're talking about ourselves
[1:02:08] this morning we don't want to talk about
[1:02:09] the world so much brother B says this he
[1:02:11] says no wonder Elijah laid his body upon
[1:02:14] that dead baby and it come to life it
[1:02:17] was God in that man God had took over I
[1:02:20] say this morning God take over amen that
[1:02:23] when I touch something when I speak
[1:02:25] something when I believe something when
[1:02:27] I'm in prayer for something God takes
[1:02:29] over and it happens amen he says Jes he
[1:02:32] was anointed Jesus said he was every
[1:02:35] prophet of God in the Old Testament was
[1:02:36] anointed with the Holy Ghost they were
[1:02:39] then they were lesser lights he was the
[1:02:42] fullness of God being Messiah they were
[1:02:44] Messi hates then smaller Messiahs they
[1:02:47] were Anointed with the same spirit that
[1:02:50] he was anointed with only he had it in
[1:02:52] the fullness so what makes the
[1:02:54] difference Church the holy Holy Ghost
[1:02:56] the anointing of God that's what makes
[1:02:58] the difference not what I think not what
[1:03:00] I say not what I believe but it's the
[1:03:02] holy spirit in me that's going to make
[1:03:04] the difference when it all comes down to
[1:03:05] it we read that scri that that quote
[1:03:08] last service where he was saying we are
[1:03:10] little Messiahs what each of us little
[1:03:13] lights little anointed ones that God is
[1:03:15] trying to work through in this earth I
[1:03:17] don't care how little your light is if
[1:03:19] you have light then you can defeat any
[1:03:21] Darkness that's it that's it Darkness
[1:03:24] cannot stand where light is because
[1:03:26] darkness is the absence of light so
[1:03:28] where light is automatically you have
[1:03:29] Victory where you have the holy ghost
[1:03:31] victory is automatically there light is
[1:03:33] there now catch this because he's
[1:03:35] speaking about prophets and we we look
[1:03:37] at those great men of God and we say
[1:03:39] well obviously that's what they had but
[1:03:41] watch this he says and every man today
[1:03:44] let me say every woman today that's
[1:03:47] received the true baptism of the Holy
[1:03:49] Ghost is Anointed with the same spirit
[1:03:51] that Jesus of Nazareth was he says that
[1:03:54] went about doing good and Healing The
[1:03:56] Sick he says oh my that makes me feel
[1:03:59] good to know that he lives today he says
[1:04:01] there's something about a man he is a
[1:04:04] God he was made to be a god his purpose
[1:04:06] here on Earth was to be a God to have a
[1:04:09] dominion over everything in the
[1:04:12] earth that's what it was meant to be but
[1:04:15] we notice as we're reading these
[1:04:16] scriptures that we don't get that full
[1:04:18] Dominion till later we have a portion
[1:04:20] now and it's by the leadership of the
[1:04:22] Holy Spirit but we don't have full
[1:04:24] Dominion why because we don't have full
[1:04:27] Redemption full Dominion comes with full
[1:04:29] Redemption because with full Redemption
[1:04:31] we'll have not only the character but
[1:04:32] we'll lose the sin nature of this flesh
[1:04:34] as well that's needed to have full
[1:04:36] dominion and the problem is today is
[1:04:38] that we're seeking not we people are
[1:04:40] seeking Dominion without the fullness of
[1:04:42] redemption and so all that leads is it
[1:04:44] it to is to destruction now brother Bron
[1:04:47] would talk a lot about dominion and he'
[1:04:49] talk about kingdoms and I'm going to
[1:04:50] start with kingdoms this morning and
[1:04:52] then we'll move into Dominion but we see
[1:04:54] here what it looks like to be a king in
[1:04:56] a kingdom because a kingdom is made up
[1:04:58] of what a
[1:05:00] person and then a
[1:05:02] property a person and a property a
[1:05:05] kingdom is a parcel of land it can be a
[1:05:08] city it can be a country whatever it is
[1:05:11] and then the kingdom is everything
[1:05:13] within the borders of that land whatever
[1:05:15] is within it is a kingdom and the one
[1:05:17] that has full Authority there is the
[1:05:19] king amen what is our borders the word
[1:05:23] of God that's I know that I have
[1:05:26] absolute Authority is if I can find it
[1:05:28] in the word of God I know that it is
[1:05:30] part of my Dominion if I can find it
[1:05:32] within the word of God and anything
[1:05:34] outside of that I have to leave it alone
[1:05:36] we don't go on Satan's Satan's Turf he
[1:05:39] has his
[1:05:40] Turf and we have ours and we've got to
[1:05:42] stay there amen but who is our kingdom
[1:05:46] if if who is in our kingdom if our
[1:05:48] kingdom is the word of God then who is
[1:05:50] our citizens who is our Dominion it's
[1:05:53] anyone that's in that Kingdom anyone
[1:05:55] that comes comes under our Authority by
[1:05:57] the word of God either
[1:06:00] willingly or by relationship as we'll
[1:06:02] see or by headship maybe if we want to
[1:06:04] do that so A kingdom is a portion of
[1:06:06] land with defined borders amen and it's
[1:06:08] written and it's drawn everybody knows
[1:06:11] where the borders of Canada are why
[1:06:13] because they've got them on maps and
[1:06:14] then they've got it drawn and then
[1:06:15] they've got Gates that are there and
[1:06:17] they've got controls to keep people from
[1:06:18] going in and out without do do Authority
[1:06:20] or access and then everything within
[1:06:23] those borders is also part of that
[1:06:24] Kingdom so look at Canada and we have we
[1:06:27] have all these people and that's part of
[1:06:29] the country we call it a kingdom in the
[1:06:30] old days amen all the citizens all the
[1:06:32] Crown Land all the resources all the
[1:06:34] minerals the water the forests all these
[1:06:37] different things are part of the kingdom
[1:06:39] and under a kingship rule all of those
[1:06:42] things are under the authority and Rule
[1:06:44] of that King he owns it all he controls
[1:06:46] it all it all belongs to him and what's
[1:06:49] he's saying here he's saying that we all
[1:06:51] belong to a
[1:06:52] kingdom and we have dominion in that
[1:06:55] Kingdom but we have to know what that
[1:06:57] Kingdom looks like amen we're built to
[1:07:00] be in Dominion we long for it We crave
[1:07:03] for it there's a thing that's calling
[1:07:05] out for it and you know why we want it
[1:07:07] is because we want control because if we
[1:07:09] can have control then we can have the
[1:07:11] peace we can have the rest we can have
[1:07:13] the certainty of all the things that
[1:07:15] this flesh wants that's why we want
[1:07:16] Dominion that's why people are
[1:07:18] struggling to be the big dog is because
[1:07:21] they think if I get to the top then I
[1:07:23] will have all of my needs I will have
[1:07:25] all of my wants nothing can touch
[1:07:28] me thou
[1:07:30] fool know you not that tonight your soul
[1:07:32] will be required of thee but they're
[1:07:34] doing it because there's something
[1:07:36] inside of them that's meant for Dominion
[1:07:38] the thing is a child of God has a place
[1:07:40] that can be filled and that's what the
[1:07:42] Holy Spirit coming into the heart but a
[1:07:43] child of Satan can't fill that hole why
[1:07:47] because there's nothing there that will
[1:07:48] fill it it's empty there's nothing that
[1:07:50] can fill it they're a child of Satan
[1:07:52] there's nothing that can come in to
[1:07:53] change it
[1:07:55] it's just being natural it's a natural
[1:07:57] part of humanity to try and control
[1:07:59] what's around of us but we look at a
[1:08:01] kingdom so often as what is around us
[1:08:04] something that's outside of us but when
[1:08:06] we look at a spiritual Kingdom there's
[1:08:08] only one place we truly have control and
[1:08:10] that's right here the only thing I can
[1:08:13] control is me and even that only poorly
[1:08:16] how in the world could I control you why
[1:08:19] in the world would I want to control
[1:08:21] you if I recognize my true condition our
[1:08:24] true Fallen condition
[1:08:26] we spoke about adoption how its purpose
[1:08:28] is to bring ourselves subject to the
[1:08:29] purpose and the will of God for our
[1:08:31] lives and kingship is always first found
[1:08:33] in our own lives before we ever have
[1:08:35] dominion over anybody else absolutely
[1:08:38] that's true we see it in Scripture that
[1:08:39] before you can have authority you must
[1:08:41] be under Authority before you can be a
[1:08:44] king you must be under a king when we're
[1:08:46] talking about the spiritual Kingdom
[1:08:47] otherwise what happens is it's a blind
[1:08:49] leading the blind and we both end up in
[1:08:50] the ditch you can't do it it won't work
[1:08:53] that way listen to what David said he
[1:08:55] says he that had no rule over his own
[1:08:57] spirit is like a city that is broken
[1:09:00] down and Without Walls anywhere in other
[1:09:03] words a man that has no rule over his
[1:09:05] own spiritual Kingdom his own Spirit his
[1:09:08] own nature inside of him if that is out
[1:09:11] of order you can't help somebody else
[1:09:12] bring theirs into order why he says you
[1:09:15] got no walls anybody can come in and out
[1:09:18] you are completely open to influence
[1:09:20] because you have no boundaries around
[1:09:21] your life you are completely open to
[1:09:24] somebody else coming in and taking over
[1:09:26] your kingdom he says a man that has no
[1:09:29] self-control that has not set up
[1:09:31] boundaries in his life that has not
[1:09:33] protected his life by the word of God is
[1:09:36] going to be under influence that is
[1:09:39] uncertain at all times we never know
[1:09:41] who's in
[1:09:42] control but here's the thing is he who
[1:09:45] says he has no
[1:09:47] choice is already under
[1:09:49] Dominion see we say there's no there
[1:09:51] there's nothing around here there's
[1:09:53] nothing protecting me
[1:09:55] I have no
[1:09:58] choice what you realize is if you if you
[1:10:01] don't have any walls then you've already
[1:10:03] made your
[1:10:05] choice that's your choice is to not have
[1:10:07] walls anden as Believers we need to have
[1:10:10] walls and those walls need to be firmly
[1:10:12] balanced and and structured in this amen
[1:10:14] that's where our walls are and when you
[1:10:16] take that away here's the way that Satan
[1:10:18] works as Satan Works to get us to a
[1:10:20] place where we say I don't have a
[1:10:22] choice when you've done that you've You'
[1:10:25] already made a choice let me take you to
[1:10:27] the scriptures Shadrach mhach and
[1:10:29] Abednego the three Hebrew children they
[1:10:31] said we have no choice We Will Not Bow
[1:10:35] why because they were living by the word
[1:10:37] of God but every single other so-called
[1:10:40] believer bowed themselves to the idol
[1:10:43] why we have no choice they had committed
[1:10:47] themselves to a different Dominion they
[1:10:49] were under Dominion of Satan in their
[1:10:52] believing that they were what well I
[1:10:54] it's okay I'm trying to save my life God
[1:10:56] will understand God will not understand
[1:10:59] God gives his word and he backs up his
[1:11:01] word and in saying I don't have a choice
[1:11:04] every single other one of those Hebrew
[1:11:05] children lost the ability to have a
[1:11:07] supernatural
[1:11:09] experience that's it when we say I have
[1:11:12] no choice I must do this I've got to put
[1:11:15] God aside for the moment what we do is
[1:11:17] we put the supernatural completely out
[1:11:18] of our life cuz God's got nothing to
[1:11:20] back up now you're on your own you're
[1:11:22] under another Dominion you're under
[1:11:24] another influence in your life
[1:11:26] the key to self-control is to set
[1:11:28] boundary by the words by the word of God
[1:11:30] that's the way we do it if I can't guard
[1:11:32] myself how can I guard you if I can't
[1:11:35] protect myself how can I protect
[1:11:37] you Paul said this in Romans 6 and we're
[1:11:39] going to spend a bit of time here this
[1:11:41] morning he says let not sin therefore re
[1:11:44] in your mortal body that you should obey
[1:11:46] it in the lust thereof the first place
[1:11:49] that we must have reigning is in our own
[1:11:52] lives there must be a king and he says
[1:11:54] Don't let let sin be king in your life
[1:11:56] don't let unbelief in the word of God
[1:11:59] have control in your life he says
[1:12:02] otherwise you're going to obey the lust
[1:12:03] of this body and this flesh you're going
[1:12:05] to fall into a lifestyle of feeding this
[1:12:07] flesh What It Wants rather than what it
[1:12:09] needs
[1:12:13] Amen brother B says this he says and a
[1:12:15] man never knows what it is to live a
[1:12:17] Victorious life until he's completely
[1:12:19] overcome Glory who himself he says
[1:12:24] that's the big biggest enemy you've got
[1:12:26] is
[1:12:27] yourself amen if we're going to be Kings
[1:12:30] we've got to let somebody else be king
[1:12:32] amen there has to be a victory in these
[1:12:34] lives Paul will continue he says neither
[1:12:36] yield ye your members as instruments of
[1:12:38] unrighteousness of sin unto sin he says
[1:12:40] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[1:12:44] that are alive from the dead and your
[1:12:45] members as instruments of righteousness
[1:12:47] unto God what's the key to not letting
[1:12:49] sin be king let somebody else be King
[1:12:52] instead of sin Let The Great king of
[1:12:54] kings and Lord of Lords be king and that
[1:12:56] way you've got that King there sin can't
[1:12:58] come in and be king sin can't reign in
[1:13:00] your body if you'll give the kingship to
[1:13:01] him then he'll protect you he'll take
[1:13:04] authority he'll control what's going on
[1:13:05] in your body and in your life amen cuz
[1:13:07] one thing certain church I can't be king
[1:13:09] of me and you can't be king of you that
[1:13:11] ain't going to work it's got to be
[1:13:13] somebody outside of us because we are
[1:13:15] born in sin shaped in iniquity come to
[1:13:16] the world SE speaking Lies We cannot
[1:13:19] control ourselves we need another
[1:13:21] Dominion or authority in our lives to
[1:13:23] take us out of who and what we are in
[1:13:25] our natural birth
[1:13:27] amen if we're going to be in Authority
[1:13:29] we've got to yield ourselves first we've
[1:13:31] got to let another Authority be in US
[1:13:32] Paul says yield yourselves unto God give
[1:13:35] control to him he says how do you do it
[1:13:37] act like you're
[1:13:39] dead and somebody else made you alive
[1:13:42] act like you've died out and don't just
[1:13:45] act like it die out die out daily Paul
[1:13:48] would say this in Galatians 5 he says
[1:13:50] and they that are christs have crucified
[1:13:52] the flesh with the affections and the
[1:13:54] lusts
[1:13:55] our kingdom is what a kingdom of God
[1:13:58] we're under his headship we're under his
[1:13:59] authority and we are Kings and Priests
[1:14:01] but we are under God and so we see here
[1:14:04] that under that kingship we must first
[1:14:07] conquer self and the only way to do that
[1:14:09] is to kill self and everything attached
[1:14:10] to it that's it that's it amen we've got
[1:14:15] to conquer
[1:14:16] this before we can conquer anything
[1:14:18] outside of it Paul continues in Romans
[1:14:21] he says for sin shall not shall not have
[1:14:25] dominion over you for ye are not under
[1:14:27] the law but under grace church I love
[1:14:29] when something says shall not because
[1:14:31] that makes it an absolute it's not just
[1:14:34] a promise but church this is something
[1:14:36] that we can enforce this is something we
[1:14:38] can enforce I was talking with somebody
[1:14:40] a while ago and they said how do I get
[1:14:42] rid of this I said you've got to want to
[1:14:44] let it go you've got to want to let it
[1:14:46] go but when you want to let it go then
[1:14:48] you've got this that says sin shall not
[1:14:50] have dominion over me and God is behind
[1:14:53] his word the Holy Spirit is there to
[1:14:55] enforce the promise that sin doesn't
[1:14:57] have rain in your
[1:15:00] life that's what we're supposed to do as
[1:15:03] we say Lord I'm enforcing the promise
[1:15:05] you said sin won't win I don't want sin
[1:15:08] there I'm asking you to take it out of
[1:15:09] my life Lord I'm asking you to take away
[1:15:11] my unbelief Lord I'm asking you to take
[1:15:13] away the coolness of my relationship
[1:15:15] with you Lord I'm asking you to heal my
[1:15:17] body whatever it might be say sin shall
[1:15:20] not have dominion not may not not no no
[1:15:23] no there's no doubt about it sin shall
[1:15:25] not and Lord I'm here for your word to
[1:15:27] enforce that promise in my life you know
[1:15:29] I was listening to brother Aon mcir this
[1:15:31] morning and he said he said for the
[1:15:33] Believers he says whenever there's a des
[1:15:36] there's a deficit there's
[1:15:38] desperation and I thought that was just
[1:15:40] a beautiful thing to say because what
[1:15:42] happens is when we see the promise and
[1:15:44] we see our lives we see our bodies we
[1:15:46] see our relationships we see whatever
[1:15:48] we're at this morning when we see a
[1:15:50] difference a deficit between the word
[1:15:52] and ourselves then a desperation ought
[1:15:54] to come before us and say God lift me
[1:15:56] higher Lord help me to step up in your
[1:15:58] word Lord build up my faith Lord build
[1:16:00] up my strength Lord build up my
[1:16:02] relationship help me to look and feed on
[1:16:04] the things that are of God so that I can
[1:16:06] come into the place where your word
[1:16:07] promises deficit ought to drive
[1:16:13] what what's driving
[1:16:15] us what's driving us why do we work
[1:16:19] harder deficit of
[1:16:21] money why do we try and get a better job
[1:16:24] def deficit of housing or vehicles or
[1:16:27] these different things he says a
[1:16:28] Believer when they have a deficit in the
[1:16:30] word ought to have a desperation that
[1:16:32] God would fulfill it in their lives that
[1:16:33] he would raise them up to a higher level
[1:16:36] but Paul says this he says you're not
[1:16:37] under grace you're not under the law he
[1:16:40] says the way this works will not be
[1:16:42] under that Mosaic law thou must thou
[1:16:44] must thou must he says but it will be
[1:16:46] under grace that this happens this
[1:16:48] overcoming this Dominion is by yielding
[1:16:52] is by yielding to the Holy Spirit and
[1:16:54] that is what will have dominion now this
[1:16:56] is what will change you from a sin
[1:16:58] Dominion to a holy ghost to a kingdom of
[1:17:00] God Dominion but it's a day-by-day thing
[1:17:03] this is a day-by-day fight it's a
[1:17:05] day-by-day struggle it's a day-by-day
[1:17:07] choice for the believer in this age amen
[1:17:10] it's not just a salvational experience
[1:17:11] it's not just coming to the altar it's
[1:17:13] not just a baptism it's not just a
[1:17:15] church service but it's a day byday uh
[1:17:18] struggle it's a day-by-day battle to let
[1:17:20] the Holy Spirit take dominion over any
[1:17:22] sin to hold back any unbelief amen amen
[1:17:25] that's a choice we make it's a daily
[1:17:28] choice of where I'm going to let
[1:17:29] Dominion be in my
[1:17:31] life Paul said this he says but I
[1:17:35] keep
[1:17:37] constantly always I always keep under my
[1:17:41] body and bring it under
[1:17:44] subjection you go to the Amplified says
[1:17:46] I keep control of my body and bring it
[1:17:49] into subjection lest that by any means
[1:17:51] when I have preached to others I myself
[1:17:53] should be a Cast Away remember I said
[1:17:55] last service that I keep my body away
[1:17:57] from things that i' ought not to have
[1:17:59] and and these different things except
[1:18:01] for donuts and chocolate Easter
[1:18:03] eggs Jonathan gave me some more
[1:18:07] yesterday but I guard my
[1:18:10] life why because this flesh loves the
[1:18:14] Dominion of sin it loves it that never
[1:18:18] changes until we get our full Redemption
[1:18:20] when we get a glorified body this body
[1:18:22] loves it and so what do I do my soul is
[1:18:25] sealed I have no worries about where I'm
[1:18:27] going if I should die
[1:18:29] today but this body is in a constant
[1:18:32] battle Paul says and I've got to keep it
[1:18:34] under subjection and how do you kill
[1:18:36] your enemy starve him starve him don't
[1:18:40] let him have food don't let them have
[1:18:42] water because if I take this body now
[1:18:44] now catch this if I take this body and I
[1:18:48] put the world in front of it it will
[1:18:50] feed on the word and it will start to
[1:18:52] like it because the world is built to
[1:18:55] satisfy the flesh that is Satan's
[1:18:58] kingdom that is his temptation for us is
[1:19:00] to satisfy the desires of the flesh Paul
[1:19:03] says we've got to kill it with its
[1:19:05] affections and with its lusts we've got
[1:19:07] to crucify it so how do I do that I take
[1:19:10] it away from those things that it
[1:19:12] craves but if I put it in front of me
[1:19:15] then this flesh will feed on whatever I
[1:19:16] put on it did you know you can feed your
[1:19:19] flesh the word of God absolutely you
[1:19:22] can but it wanton wants everything but
[1:19:26] the word of
[1:19:27] God but the Inner Man desires something
[1:19:29] else and so when the Holy Spirit is in
[1:19:31] Dominion in my life then my inner man
[1:19:33] controls my outer man and it controls
[1:19:35] what I put in front of it because
[1:19:37] otherwise I can sit there and if I put
[1:19:38] rock and roll in front of this fleshly
[1:19:40] body it'll eventually start to feed on
[1:19:42] it the things that I now hate it will
[1:19:44] start to
[1:19:45] like because that's what I'm feeding it
[1:19:47] if I put worldly entertainment in front
[1:19:49] of it if I put worldly friends around it
[1:19:51] all of these things if I put the
[1:19:53] problems of this world
[1:19:55] you know come on I mean we we know this
[1:19:59] country is Fallen we know the world is
[1:20:00] Fallen it's in debt it it's it's
[1:20:03] completely gone insane and if I dwell on
[1:20:06] the insanity if I dwell on the
[1:20:08] unfairness if I dwell on the problems
[1:20:10] and what happens is this body starts to
[1:20:12] feed on it and those things start to
[1:20:14] take
[1:20:15] dominion and so then what we have is the
[1:20:18] flesh rising up in dominion and the
[1:20:19] inner man is starting to fail why
[1:20:21] because my feeding is mostly on the
[1:20:23] flesh side rather than the inner man
[1:20:26] this body feeds on those things and
[1:20:28] it'll dominate my conversation it'll
[1:20:30] dominate my spare time it'll dominate my
[1:20:32] testimony it'll dominate everything that
[1:20:34] I have around me and it will overcome my
[1:20:37] life and it'll start to rule over me
[1:20:39] that's the way s works as he's working
[1:20:41] from the outside in and what God is
[1:20:42] saying is saying let the Inside Man out
[1:20:45] let him push out and let him take
[1:20:46] dominion over things that's why people
[1:20:48] today are so consumed with issues that
[1:20:50] have nothing to do with them and that
[1:20:51] are so small and insignificant is
[1:20:53] because they're feeding on those things
[1:20:55] and it rises up inside of them and it
[1:20:57] becomes an influence and it takes
[1:20:58] dominion over them and so often what
[1:21:00] they see is is this big problem and they
[1:21:03] don't see all the other problems it's
[1:21:04] creating in their very life why because
[1:21:06] it's a demonic Dominion that's taken
[1:21:08] over them they've got tunnel vision now
[1:21:10] everything's tunnel vision everything is
[1:21:12] you know the alphabet Lifestyles and
[1:21:14] everything's this and that and it's like
[1:21:15] we've got so much bigger
[1:21:18] problems and yet we're sitting here
[1:21:20] wondering about pronouns and
[1:21:22] gender what is it gotten obsessed and
[1:21:26] they've come under the Dominion of
[1:21:28] something and it's not Christ what comes
[1:21:31] out of it what comes out of it we see
[1:21:33] what this world is full of fear stress
[1:21:37] obesity worry concern marital problems
[1:21:41] mental problems something like 80% of
[1:21:44] people now in North America they say
[1:21:45] suffer from a mental a mental
[1:21:48] issue
[1:21:50] 80% that's almost everybody as much as
[1:21:52] matters
[1:21:54] why because they're feeding this flesh
[1:21:58] rather than the Inner Man and it has
[1:22:00] dominion over their lives that's why we
[1:22:03] need to keep it under there is no
[1:22:04] satisfying this body that's the thing
[1:22:06] nobody tells you there is no satisfying
[1:22:09] this body much craves more this flesh
[1:22:11] will want more and more and more you
[1:22:13] make more money it'll want more money
[1:22:15] you make more than that then it'll want
[1:22:16] more you buy a car it wants a nicer car
[1:22:18] you buy a big house it wants a bigger
[1:22:19] house you go on a good vacation it wants
[1:22:21] a better vacation you buy nice clothes
[1:22:23] it wants better clothes
[1:22:25] there is no end to this there is no end
[1:22:28] to it it's a hamster on a tread you know
[1:22:32] those wheels that are inside the only
[1:22:34] way to stop is get off otherwise it'll
[1:22:37] keep spinning and nothing changes
[1:22:39] nothing changes on that tread willll
[1:22:42] nothing's going
[1:22:44] on so I've got to refuse to cater to the
[1:22:47] desires of this flesh I have to
[1:22:50] willingly consciously say
[1:22:53] no no no more chocolate Easter eggs
[1:22:56] whatever it is Satan throws in front of
[1:23:00] us why cuz if I do that then I've got a
[1:23:02] promise that sin will not have dominion
[1:23:05] over me and now I can rise up in
[1:23:07] kingship I can rise up in
[1:23:09] priesthood this is what Paul said about
[1:23:11] this this is Paul speaking to his own
[1:23:13] church now he says that he would Grant
[1:23:16] you according to the riches of his glory
[1:23:18] to be strengthened with might by his
[1:23:21] spirit in the Inner Man you know what
[1:23:23] that word might is it's that word
[1:23:25] dunamis it means Force Power strength
[1:23:28] ability it means the power the power
[1:23:32] to achieve by the Lord's Spirit those
[1:23:37] things that are innate in
[1:23:39] him in other words what is built into
[1:23:42] the Holy Ghost will come out of
[1:23:44] you that is not just a spirit but is a
[1:23:48] spirit with power it is a spirit with
[1:23:50] abilities it is a spirit with purpose
[1:23:52] and when we are strengthened in the
[1:23:54] inner man then what comes out of it is
[1:23:56] power what what comes out of it now is
[1:23:58] effect amen that's what we're looking
[1:24:01] for Paul says this in second Timothy for
[1:24:04] God had not given us the spirit of fear
[1:24:06] but of power and of love and of a sound
[1:24:09] mind that word sound mind has a twofold
[1:24:11] meaning and the first one is the one
[1:24:13] that we would think it's a mind that is
[1:24:14] settled a mind that is is not swayed by
[1:24:17] anything outside of the word of God but
[1:24:18] the second meaning is of sound mind is
[1:24:21] selfcontrol and
[1:24:23] moderation that we have a spirit that
[1:24:25] keeps us in
[1:24:27] balance that doesn't keep us running
[1:24:29] after this and running after that but it
[1:24:30] keeps us right in the middle of the road
[1:24:32] where God wants us to be amen that's the
[1:24:35] spirit that we have in the Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] that's what he's doing you know we're
[1:24:39] looking for great things in our in our
[1:24:41] Christian walk I believe this in talking
[1:24:43] and fellowshipping with many of you over
[1:24:45] the past six months perhaps we're in
[1:24:47] expectation for God to not just move in
[1:24:49] our personal lives and in our personal
[1:24:51] bodies but in those that we're
[1:24:52] interacting with in our co-workers and
[1:24:54] people we meet on a daily basis and in
[1:24:56] school and all of these different things
[1:24:58] and we're looking for these things but I
[1:25:00] want to say before we look for that
[1:25:02] who's in control today in our lives
[1:25:04] who's in daytoday control not Sunday
[1:25:07] morning and Wednesday night control but
[1:25:09] dayt day where is Dominion in our life
[1:25:11] who has Dominion who is it that's
[1:25:13] controlling what we're doing how we're
[1:25:15] speaking how we're spending our time and
[1:25:17] all of these things there ought to be
[1:25:19] overcoming in our dayto
[1:25:20] day if the holy spirit's there amen
[1:25:25] why because the first work of the holy
[1:25:26] spirit is always internal it's in me and
[1:25:29] it's in you as individuals before it
[1:25:31] ever starts pushing out to somebody else
[1:25:33] that's why they had to go to the upper
[1:25:35] room before they could ever fulfill Mark
[1:25:37] 16 they had to go up and get power what
[1:25:39] they had to they had to defeat
[1:25:41] themselves they had to settle it in
[1:25:43] inside of them they had to yield to the
[1:25:44] power of the Holy Spirit you know we
[1:25:46] think of Kingdoms and we think of
[1:25:48] Thrones and crowns and great wealth and
[1:25:50] power and authority and armies and
[1:25:52] Military might and Wars and victories
[1:25:55] and all of these things and we know that
[1:25:57] with kingship comes great power and that
[1:26:00] what you say is law if you're King
[1:26:03] everything is absolute Kings Kings when
[1:26:05] there was in the time of the Kings they
[1:26:07] were Untouchable nobody could mess with
[1:26:09] a king if they said you die you died if
[1:26:11] they said your stuff is mine your stuff
[1:26:13] was theirs there was no stopping and
[1:26:15] holding back a king he had absolute
[1:26:16] power but that is an Earthly Kingdom
[1:26:19] design that's the way of man that's not
[1:26:21] the way of God and so everything in an
[1:26:23] Earthly Kingdom is always focused on the
[1:26:25] king himself but under Christ's Reign
[1:26:28] under Christ's Kingdom this heavenly
[1:26:30] Kingdom we have a different model we
[1:26:32] have a different model for how we run
[1:26:34] things and Jesus said this in Matthew 20
[1:26:36] he says but Jesus called them unto him
[1:26:38] and said ye know that the princes of the
[1:26:40] Gentiles exercise dominion over them and
[1:26:42] that they are great exercise of
[1:26:46] authority upon them so Satan's model is
[1:26:48] that you exert Authority you force
[1:26:51] yourself onto people you force them to
[1:26:53] obey you you force them to give to you
[1:26:55] you tax them you take from them you do
[1:26:57] all these things that Satan's model is
[1:26:59] force I'm going to force you to give me
[1:27:02] what I want and it's for self-benefit
[1:27:04] it's for self-benefit he says but it
[1:27:06] shall not be so among you this is not
[1:27:09] the way God's kingdom Works he says for
[1:27:11] whosoever will be great among you let
[1:27:14] him be your minister now we look we talk
[1:27:17] Minister and we talk about The Man
[1:27:18] Behind the pulpit the preachers but
[1:27:20] remember the the root word for minister
[1:27:23] is servant
[1:27:25] servant and it's a servant that's given
[1:27:28] authority over a certain area but it is
[1:27:30] still a
[1:27:31] servant they serve somebody else he says
[1:27:35] and whosoever will be Chief among you
[1:27:37] let him be your servant even as the son
[1:27:40] of man came not to be ministered unto
[1:27:42] but to minister and to give his life a
[1:27:44] ransom for many so we see this kingship
[1:27:47] model is not the same as this world's
[1:27:48] kingship model it is not about the king
[1:27:51] it is about the people under his
[1:27:52] authority that that's what we'll see he
[1:27:55] says Jesus said brother Braham says this
[1:27:57] he says Jesus
[1:27:59] said give me some help here Jesus said
[1:28:01] he that is greatest of all is servant of
[1:28:03] all a wise man commented on that saying
[1:28:06] and here's what he says only history
[1:28:09] will prove the truth of that dictum he
[1:28:12] says that man was right all the truly
[1:28:14] great men of history have been servants
[1:28:17] they who demanded to be served they who
[1:28:20] oppressed they who sought to always be
[1:28:23] at the head have gone down in shame you
[1:28:27] look at some of these great generals you
[1:28:28] look at
[1:28:30] Napoleon look at his
[1:28:32] failing look at Julius Caesar killed by
[1:28:36] his own best
[1:28:37] friend you look at these great men and
[1:28:39] in all their conquering and all their
[1:28:41] leading yet it was for personal gain and
[1:28:45] they go down in shame he says even the
[1:28:47] very rich are condemned by God that they
[1:28:49] have not used their wealth right but
[1:28:51] look into history he says and you will
[1:28:53] find that the truly great were those who
[1:28:55] served others history can never Acclaim
[1:28:58] those for whom much was done but it will
[1:29:00] forever praise those who did much for
[1:29:03] others we're looking at a kingdom model
[1:29:05] now he says now let us apply that to
[1:29:10] ourselves this is for me this is for you
[1:29:13] he says even as the son of man came not
[1:29:15] to be ministered unto but to minister so
[1:29:18] we are to follow that example see him as
[1:29:22] he bows himself over the feet of the
[1:29:24] Apostles and washes their tired and
[1:29:27] dirty feet church I don't think we
[1:29:29] understand what dirty feet look like
[1:29:31] because we wear we wear these great
[1:29:33] shoes that cover us up and we've got
[1:29:35] waterproof this and that but in those
[1:29:37] days it was sandals and as you're
[1:29:39] walking along what happens dirt gets in
[1:29:43] there sweat gets mingled with it there's
[1:29:45] animals that are droppings everywhere
[1:29:48] and you're stepping in these things and
[1:29:49] so those feet are not just dirty they
[1:29:51] are
[1:29:52] filthy they're not something you want to
[1:29:55] touch and that's why they had the
[1:29:57] servants do
[1:29:58] it and he says this is what he does and
[1:30:01] he comes to his Apostles he comes to
[1:30:03] those that are beneath him and he serves
[1:30:07] them he does something disgusting he
[1:30:10] does something that is so below him
[1:30:12] brother Bram calls him a footwash
[1:30:14] flunky amen are we willing to lower
[1:30:17] ourselves for the sake of our brothers
[1:30:19] and sisters for those that are around us
[1:30:22] he says he said you don't know now what
[1:30:24] I'm doing but you'll know Hereafter but
[1:30:26] what you see me doing you ought also to
[1:30:29] do he became a servant in order that God
[1:30:32] could Elevate him to the highest Heights
[1:30:34] the Way Up Is Down he says and one day
[1:30:36] in the Judgment of the Saints we're
[1:30:38] going to hear him say Well done good and
[1:30:40] faithful what servant enter thou into
[1:30:44] the joy of the Lord next slide it says
[1:30:49] it is hard to be always a servant
[1:30:54] always oh we get tired out don't we
[1:30:56] brother Bob we get tired
[1:31:00] out it's hard doing a Sunday school
[1:31:03] lesson every weekend no matter
[1:31:06] what it's hard to clean the church two
[1:31:08] times a week when we've got busy lives
[1:31:12] it's hard to sit down and study and
[1:31:15] study and pray and pray and pray without
[1:31:19] ceasing there are no breaks to the
[1:31:22] servants
[1:31:24] you know it's funny you look in the
[1:31:25] scripture and Jesus saidou know if a
[1:31:27] servant works all day you know then then
[1:31:30] will the master come and lay out food
[1:31:32] for his servants and say here let me
[1:31:33] serve you he says no a servant serves
[1:31:36] and so what the Master's going to do is
[1:31:38] say serve me my food and then you can
[1:31:40] have yours it's hard to always be a
[1:31:43] servant because nobody serves
[1:31:45] you but if we're part of a body remember
[1:31:49] every joint supplies what's needed we're
[1:31:51] all here to support each other but we're
[1:31:53] all giving knowing that if we're part of
[1:31:55] the body we'll get what we need as well
[1:31:58] that's the way these things work he says
[1:32:00] it's hard to always to be always a
[1:32:02] servant but those who spend and are
[1:32:05] spent for others will one day be seated
[1:32:07] with him in his throne he says it'll be
[1:32:09] worth it all then and then he say he
[1:32:11] gives the words from when the role is
[1:32:13] Called Up Yonder I'll be
[1:32:15] there see here we see a very different
[1:32:17] hierarchy from this
[1:32:19] world where those that are Kings serve
[1:32:24] and those that are citizens are
[1:32:26] served that's the kingship we're under
[1:32:29] that's the kingdom we're under that's
[1:32:30] the Dominion that we have in our lives
[1:32:32] amen that's why I said we need to
[1:32:34] recognize our role as priests first is
[1:32:37] because priests are always there for the
[1:32:38] other person they've been taken care of
[1:32:41] they've been anointed they've got the
[1:32:42] blood for themselves they're clean and
[1:32:44] so what they're doing is being concerned
[1:32:46] about everybody else now and so you take
[1:32:48] that nature now into a king and what do
[1:32:50] you do is you serve as king you do it
[1:32:52] for the benefit of the body you do it
[1:32:53] for the benefit of the Kingdom not just
[1:32:55] yourself brother says this he says we
[1:32:57] are Kings spiritual Kings oh we're going
[1:33:00] to be Kings upon the Earth with him when
[1:33:02] he sits on his throne but now we are
[1:33:04] spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a
[1:33:06] spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17
[1:33:09] for If by one man's offense death Reign
[1:33:12] by one much more they which receive what
[1:33:15] abundance of
[1:33:16] Grace he says and of the gift of
[1:33:19] righteousness
[1:33:21] shall that shall means Contin
[1:33:23] continuously on and on into
[1:33:27] eternity they shall continuously reign
[1:33:30] in life by one Jesus Christ he says and
[1:33:33] in Colossians 1:13 it says who had
[1:33:35] delivered us from the power of darkness
[1:33:37] and had translated us into the kingdom
[1:33:39] reign of his dear son he says right now
[1:33:42] we reign with Christ now we're talking
[1:33:45] about kingdoms now we're moving into
[1:33:47] dominions he says having dominion over
[1:33:52] what sin
[1:33:55] the
[1:33:56] World the
[1:33:58] Flesh and the
[1:34:00] devil now sin wants to be in you the
[1:34:03] world is outside of you the flesh is
[1:34:04] with you and the devil's trying to get
[1:34:05] in as well so 3/4 of this is
[1:34:10] internal amen three4 of it is internal
[1:34:14] why are we looking so much
[1:34:15] outside let's have the the the real
[1:34:17] Dominion inside of us that we're
[1:34:19] supposed to have to he says right now we
[1:34:21] reign with Christ having dominion over
[1:34:22] sin the world the Flesh and the devil
[1:34:25] showing forth his praise and glory
[1:34:27] showing forth himself for it is Christ
[1:34:30] in US willing and doing of his good
[1:34:32] pleasure remember we said before we can
[1:34:35] be Kings we've got to have a king over
[1:34:36] us he says yes indeed even now we are
[1:34:39] seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:34:42] Jesus we keep hearing those words
[1:34:44] dominion and I want to talk about that
[1:34:46] for the last bit of this service this
[1:34:48] morning because we know that we are part
[1:34:50] of a dominion and we have dominion and
[1:34:54] so we look at that word dominion and
[1:34:56] that word dominion is an amazing word
[1:34:58] because it means supreme authority not
[1:35:01] just Authority supreme authority
[1:35:05] sovereignty and absolute
[1:35:10] ownership supreme authority sovereignty
[1:35:14] and absolute ownership I want you to
[1:35:16] understand and this is where we're going
[1:35:17] to finish this morning is on this
[1:35:19] Dominion because we're going to be we're
[1:35:21] going to be speaking a while on this
[1:35:22] even in the coming services I know even
[1:35:24] as we move past this
[1:35:25] one he says Dominion is supreme
[1:35:30] authority that means there's nothing
[1:35:35] higher I like Authority but what's
[1:35:38] better than that is supreme
[1:35:40] authority King of Kings Lord of
[1:35:44] lords that's what is in our lives that's
[1:35:48] the Dominion that we have supreme
[1:35:50] authority nothing higher when you're in
[1:35:53] Supreme author Authority you are the top
[1:35:54] of the food chain everything bows before
[1:35:58] you nothing can defeat you nothing can
[1:36:02] control you nothing can hold you nothing
[1:36:04] can harm you you are in supreme
[1:36:07] authority they can try they can try and
[1:36:09] trap they can try and entice they can
[1:36:11] attack they can do all these things but
[1:36:13] in supreme authority nothing can defeat
[1:36:15] you nothing can override you he says
[1:36:18] Dominion is also sovereignty that means
[1:36:21] we are self-governed what that means
[1:36:23] means is we cannot be influenced by
[1:36:25] something outside of
[1:36:26] us what that means is we better have the
[1:36:29] right thing inside of us because we are
[1:36:30] self-governed and if I am self-governed
[1:36:33] by my own will and by my own thoughts
[1:36:35] I'm lost that's our natural condition
[1:36:38] but what happens is that we can bring
[1:36:40] ourselves now into the self-control of
[1:36:42] the Holy Spirit by the new birth and now
[1:36:45] we live a life by the word and that's
[1:36:48] what we're looking for amen and under
[1:36:50] that sovereignty you don't have to obey
[1:36:52] anything that is contrary to the word of
[1:36:54] God you don't have to accept anything
[1:36:57] that is contrary to the word of God you
[1:36:59] don't have to believe anything that is
[1:37:01] contrary to the word of God you don't
[1:37:02] even have to listen to it
[1:37:04] church you can walk away because you are
[1:37:07] self-governed by the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:37:10] mean there's not a battle doesn't mean
[1:37:12] we don't have to develop character
[1:37:14] through our trials and testing we know
[1:37:15] those things doesn't mean we won't
[1:37:17] struggle doesn't mean there isn't a
[1:37:19] battle but it means that we will win
[1:37:24] sin shall not have dominion shall not
[1:37:27] have
[1:37:28] dominion Dominion is absolute ownership
[1:37:32] you know what it means when you have
[1:37:33] absolute ownership we don't have this in
[1:37:35] Canada because we there there are
[1:37:38] elements of everything we own is Crown
[1:37:40] Land and so we really only own the top I
[1:37:43] don't know what it is it goes down a
[1:37:44] certain level of feet but everything
[1:37:45] below us still belongs to the crown they
[1:37:47] have mineral rights they have water
[1:37:48] rights to everything in the properties
[1:37:50] that we own but in in the United States
[1:37:52] they have a
[1:37:54] deed they can get an abstract title deed
[1:37:56] and what they own is everything above
[1:37:58] and everything below their
[1:38:00] property and when you have a a title
[1:38:03] deed when you have absolute property
[1:38:06] ownership you have property
[1:38:08] rights and so nobody can come on your
[1:38:10] property without your permission nobody
[1:38:13] can take anything on your property
[1:38:14] without your permission nobody can put
[1:38:16] anything on your property without your
[1:38:19] permission remember we had that Saga
[1:38:21] with the land below us where people were
[1:38:23] coming in and they were ripping around
[1:38:24] their vehicles and they were leaving
[1:38:26] drug needles and trash and all sorts of
[1:38:28] things over there and it was very
[1:38:30] annoying because they were doing it at
[1:38:31] all times a day and night but it was
[1:38:32] also dangerous because our kids go down
[1:38:34] and the neighborhood children go down
[1:38:36] there and they play and so I didn't want
[1:38:37] them down there but I didn't have any
[1:38:39] property rights but what I did have was
[1:38:42] land that was next to theirs and so it
[1:38:43] looked like I had property rights so I
[1:38:45] bluffed them out and I went up and I
[1:38:46] pounded in a a sign that said private
[1:38:48] property no trespassing and you know
[1:38:50] what it worked and from time to time I
[1:38:52] go down and I tell tell people you're on
[1:38:54] private property I didn't say it was
[1:38:57] mine I said you're on private property
[1:38:59] and there's a sign that says there no
[1:39:00] trespassing and you know what they all
[1:39:02] left praise the Lord a bluff works at
[1:39:05] times but Satan's been trying to Bluff
[1:39:07] the bride of Christ hasn't he and we've
[1:39:09] got to realize that with our Dominion
[1:39:11] comes absolute ownership of our
[1:39:13] land anden we have it defined remember
[1:39:16] we have those walls we have those
[1:39:17] boundaries that are defined by the word
[1:39:19] of God and within those boundaries we
[1:39:21] have property rights we have a right to
[1:39:23] enforce our Dominion we have a right to
[1:39:27] hold on to that which has been given to
[1:39:28] us that for which we have a title deed
[1:39:31] that for which we have an abstract title
[1:39:32] deed that says everything in there
[1:39:33] belongs to
[1:39:36] me you know if I went if I had property
[1:39:39] rights on that land below me I would
[1:39:42] never have hesitated to go down there
[1:39:44] why because I know that land belongs to
[1:39:46] me I've got the title deed in my house
[1:39:49] and when it what happens is I would have
[1:39:51] called the cops immediately I would have
[1:39:53] messed around I wouldn't have talked to
[1:39:55] them yes sure you go down talk just ask
[1:39:56] them to leave nicely but we had a group
[1:39:58] of young men that wanted to be resistant
[1:39:59] to it and so I threatened to call the
[1:40:01] cops I bluffed
[1:40:04] them but if I was the true property
[1:40:06] owner I wouldn't have bluffed I'd have
[1:40:07] just said the cops are on the
[1:40:09] way why because when the police get
[1:40:11] there I'm going to show them my deed and
[1:40:13] say this is my
[1:40:15] property they're trespassing I want them
[1:40:18] off and you know what the cops would
[1:40:18] have done they'd have told them to get
[1:40:20] off and they would have said Mr klette
[1:40:21] do you want to press charges for
[1:40:22] trespass
[1:40:24] why I'd have property
[1:40:26] rights but I'll tell you what if they
[1:40:28] ever come on my
[1:40:30] land there will be no hesitation because
[1:40:33] I've got property rights I have dominion
[1:40:36] over 15 Smith place that belongs to me
[1:40:40] and I have rights that are enforceable
[1:40:41] in
[1:40:42] that what's he saying when we have the
[1:40:45] Holy Spirit on our property there are
[1:40:48] enforceable property rights
[1:40:51] amen we don't have to accept those
[1:40:54] things things that try and come on our
[1:40:56] land people try and dump things on our
[1:40:59] land we don't have to accept that Satan
[1:41:01] tries to squat on our land Satan tries
[1:41:02] to plant something on our land we don't
[1:41:04] have to accept it we have property
[1:41:06] rights because we're in a dominion and
[1:41:08] we have kingship Jesus said this he says
[1:41:11] in Matthew 12 Jesus knew their thoughts
[1:41:13] he's talking to the Pharisees now and
[1:41:16] said unto them every Kingdom divided
[1:41:18] against itself is brought to Desolation
[1:41:20] and every city or house divided against
[1:41:22] itself shall not stand we've seen that
[1:41:25] in the natural and we've seen that in
[1:41:26] the spiritual have we
[1:41:28] not but notice he says if a kingdom is
[1:41:31] divided against itself it's brought to
[1:41:32] Desolation it's brought to ruin it has
[1:41:35] no
[1:41:37] walls if you're in God's will and I'm in
[1:41:40] God's will we've got to be able to work
[1:41:42] together because if we're contrary then
[1:41:44] we're fighting each other and he says
[1:41:46] that can't be part of the same Kingdom
[1:41:48] so if we're fighting that means either
[1:41:49] you're wrong or I'm wrong or we're both
[1:41:52] wrong amen let's not put it on the other
[1:41:54] guy let's sayl are we truly right but he
[1:41:57] says we can't fight against each other
[1:41:58] otherwise the kingdom falls apart he
[1:42:00] says' if Katan Satan casts out Satan he
[1:42:03] is divided against himself how then
[1:42:05] shall his kingdom stand how's it going
[1:42:06] to hold up if he's fighting with
[1:42:09] himself you ever see that that video of
[1:42:11] the dog that's scared of his own
[1:42:14] tail and so he's laying there and his
[1:42:16] tail starts to wiggle and move and he
[1:42:18] thinks it's something coming to get him
[1:42:19] and so what does he do he tries to bite
[1:42:20] his tail and eventually he gets it and
[1:42:23] then what does he get a big surprise he
[1:42:25] was fighting against
[1:42:27] himself I don't know how a dog gets
[1:42:29] scared of his tail but it's one of the
[1:42:30] funniest videos you ever see because he
[1:42:32] thinks he's fighting something external
[1:42:33] to him and all of a sudden he comes up
[1:42:34] and he Chomps down on his own tail and
[1:42:36] then he realizes that's me I was
[1:42:38] fighting against
[1:42:39] myself he says and if by Beelzebub cast
[1:42:42] out Devils by whom do your children cast
[1:42:44] them out he says therefore they shall be
[1:42:46] your judges he says but if I cast out
[1:42:49] Devils by the spirit of God then the
[1:42:51] kingdom of God is come unto you he says
[1:42:54] if the spirit of God is here destroying
[1:42:56] the works of Satan's kingdom then the
[1:42:58] Kingdom of Heaven is here
[1:43:00] already the Kingdom of Heaven is here
[1:43:02] already what are the works of the spirit
[1:43:04] to destroy the works of Satan that's the
[1:43:07] way it works he says or else how can one
[1:43:08] enter into a strong man's house and
[1:43:10] spoil his Goods except he first bind the
[1:43:13] strong man and then he will spoil his
[1:43:15] house in other words he's saying you
[1:43:17] can't defeat something unless you bind
[1:43:19] it first you can't defeat something
[1:43:22] unless you're stronger than it it he
[1:43:24] says the only way that I'm casting out
[1:43:26] Devils is because what I have is
[1:43:28] stronger than what it
[1:43:29] is he says and that's how you know it's
[1:43:31] the Kingdom of Heaven because Satan's
[1:43:33] not going to cast himself out but the
[1:43:34] Kingdom of Heaven is here the holy
[1:43:36] spirit's here to cast those things out
[1:43:38] he says he that is not with me is
[1:43:40] against me and he that gathereth not
[1:43:43] with me scattereth abroad amen there's
[1:43:45] only two forces in the world Christ the
[1:43:46] word and everything else and you know
[1:43:48] what everything else is trying to paint
[1:43:50] itself to be different from that guy
[1:43:52] next to them that church next next to
[1:43:53] them that political party next to them
[1:43:55] that country next to them everybody's
[1:43:56] trying to make themselves different to
[1:43:59] appeal but Christ just stands there and
[1:44:01] he never changes the word never changes
[1:44:03] and it's him and then it's everything
[1:44:05] else
[1:44:07] amen he says listen you're either with
[1:44:09] me or he says you're against me even if
[1:44:12] you're sitting on the sidelines you're
[1:44:14] against me because you're not helping
[1:44:16] and anything that's not helping is a
[1:44:18] dead weight and it's going to hold back
[1:44:19] the
[1:44:20] kingdom there's no neutrality with God
[1:44:24] you're not going to get to heaven
[1:44:25] because you didn't
[1:44:27] choose not choosing is a choice not
[1:44:30] choosing is a choice we've got to make a
[1:44:32] choice and it's got to be that amen so
[1:44:34] we've got to be about the father's
[1:44:36] business a son and daughter of God's no
[1:44:37] good sitting on a couch or just sitting
[1:44:39] in a Pew we've got to be about what God
[1:44:41] has for us otherwise we're wasting his
[1:44:43] resources brother Brown would say this
[1:44:45] he says when he was on Earth Adam's race
[1:44:47] had many fears he says and it's true
[1:44:50] they still have them but they shouldn't
[1:44:52] have have them we're talking about
[1:44:54] Dominion now we're talking about
[1:44:55] property rights we're talking about
[1:44:57] absolute Authority he says Christ won
[1:45:00] once for all at Calvary when he was here
[1:45:02] on Earth he walked up to a sick man that
[1:45:05] sickness had bound the human race and he
[1:45:06] said thou Spirit of the devil I charge
[1:45:08] thee come out of the man he conquered
[1:45:10] the devil when a man lay in the grave
[1:45:12] dead he conquered death for the man or
[1:45:14] the sickness when the maniac came out to
[1:45:16] destroy him and the maniac realized he
[1:45:18] was the son of God he said to him oh if
[1:45:20] you'll cast us out suffer us to go in
[1:45:22] that bunch of H
[1:45:23] for he knew the authority that Jesus
[1:45:25] Christ had amen we're talking about
[1:45:27] Dominion he says he conquered the devil
[1:45:31] everywhere he met
[1:45:35] them he conquered the devil everywhere
[1:45:39] he met him he says and he not only
[1:45:41] conquered in
[1:45:43] himself he says but he left the
[1:45:45] commission to the church that anything
[1:45:47] you ask in my name that I will do
[1:45:53] talking about stepping up we're talking
[1:45:55] about Dominion this morning kingship he
[1:45:58] says fight with what's in your
[1:46:01] hands look at
[1:46:03] shamgar 600 Philistines coming his way
[1:46:07] fully
[1:46:08] armored modern weapons trained men and
[1:46:12] what does he beat them with whatever God
[1:46:14] put in his hand an ox go that's it why
[1:46:19] because it's the supernatural it's not
[1:46:22] the natural
[1:46:23] amen what he gives us is what he fights
[1:46:25] with we fight with watch what brother
[1:46:27] Braham says here Church see the
[1:46:30] Simplicity of where you can gain your
[1:46:33] Victory he says fight with what's in
[1:46:35] your hands if it's singing sing The
[1:46:38] Gospel we got some wonderful singers in
[1:46:41] here we got people that like to worship
[1:46:43] you know what let's take it out of the
[1:46:44] church and let's start putting it in our
[1:46:46] day-to-day lives start singing I can't
[1:46:49] tell you church I'm not one of those
[1:46:51] great singers but I love to sing I was
[1:46:53] talking with with with some people the
[1:46:55] other day and we were listening to some
[1:46:56] different music and you know these
[1:46:58] people with amazing amazing voices and
[1:47:01] and they can just spiral the notes and
[1:47:03] they can flutter and they can it's
[1:47:05] amazing and I said I long to do that in
[1:47:08] my worship but I don't have the voice
[1:47:10] for it I I I've got a struggle to just
[1:47:13] hit the notes and and stay in tuned my
[1:47:15] voice cracks when I try and go any
[1:47:17] higher it it break the service but
[1:47:21] there's something in me that long to
[1:47:23] worship the way that they can do with
[1:47:24] their
[1:47:26] voices he says if it's singing sing The
[1:47:29] Gospel sing in your home I hear my
[1:47:33] daughter singing constantly downstairs
[1:47:35] in her room praise the Lord praise the
[1:47:38] Lord why because it sets an
[1:47:40] atmosphere it sets an atmosphere for us
[1:47:43] to receive and then go
[1:47:46] do he says if you can't do nothing but
[1:47:50] whistle whistle just as loud as you can
[1:47:53] for the glory of God if you can't do no
[1:47:55] more then Pat your hands he says Pat
[1:47:57] them conquer with whatever you got in
[1:47:59] your hand he says clap them in such a
[1:48:03] way till all the neighbors will love you
[1:48:05] whistle in such a way that all
[1:48:06] denominations will know that you belong
[1:48:08] to Christ he says conquer them play the
[1:48:10] game fair play it right what by the
[1:48:16] spirit he says we're living in a day
[1:48:19] that when this social gospel is becoming
[1:48:22] predominant and ain't that the
[1:48:24] truth like I said I you know in the in
[1:48:27] the last 6 or eight months I've listened
[1:48:28] to many services across many types of
[1:48:30] churches and the vast majority is a
[1:48:33] social gospel and it's a shame because
[1:48:35] there's no power in it no power in it he
[1:48:39] says it's becoming predominated when the
[1:48:41] churches are uniting themselves together
[1:48:43] and making a social religion and binding
[1:48:46] themselves together he says it's a
[1:48:48] terrible day why cuz it's all under the
[1:48:50] curse of death because when the Holy
[1:48:51] Spirit left death entered life is in the
[1:48:54] Holy Ghost and without the Holy Ghost
[1:48:56] there death is all that can come out of
[1:48:57] it and so it's just man's ideas on top
[1:48:59] of man's ideas on top of man's
[1:49:01] ideas but I want to close on this
[1:49:03] thought of dominion today because today
[1:49:05] we've got people that are asking us for
[1:49:07] Dominion aren't
[1:49:09] we we've got politicians saying give me
[1:49:12] power and I'll make everything right
[1:49:15] I'll make everything good I'll undo
[1:49:17] everything I'll change your life I'll
[1:49:19] turn Canada I'll turn New Finland into a
[1:49:21] Utopia just give me Dominion let me have
[1:49:25] the power to make decisions let me have
[1:49:27] the power to manage the economy let me
[1:49:29] have the power to manage Commerce let me
[1:49:31] have power and dominion and I'll make it
[1:49:33] good for everybody and you know what we
[1:49:36] do we vote in the person that's going to
[1:49:37] make our lives the easiest and what did
[1:49:39] they do make it worse every single
[1:49:43] time we're getting into more and more
[1:49:45] debt our social services are falling
[1:49:48] apart our Medical Systems falling apart
[1:49:51] housing spiraling out of control in
[1:49:52] terms of cost everything is it's almost
[1:49:55] impossible to make a living off of
[1:49:57] single income unless you live like we do
[1:49:58] which is
[1:50:01] simply thank God we can
[1:50:03] live but they have destroyed this world
[1:50:08] and yet they say give me dominion and
[1:50:10] I'll I'll fix it there's no fixing it
[1:50:14] it's under a curse and the curse is me
[1:50:16] and you without the Holy
[1:50:19] Ghost that's all they're left with then
[1:50:22] we have Ministries and churches and they
[1:50:24] say give me your money give me your
[1:50:26] support and I'll take back Canada I'll
[1:50:27] take back newf land I'll take back St
[1:50:29] John's can't do it church it's already
[1:50:32] cursed we're not here to take back this
[1:50:35] Kingdom we're here for souls and it's
[1:50:37] just going to be one here and one here
[1:50:40] and one here and one there it's all
[1:50:41] through scripture it's just a little bit
[1:50:44] in
[1:50:45] everyone nothing's coming back to God
[1:50:47] except those little few predestinated
[1:50:49] seeds that's it the rest is just
[1:50:52] religious system
[1:50:53] and you'll you'll absolutely bring them
[1:50:55] to your religious system but you won't
[1:50:56] bring them to
[1:50:58] Christ Paul had 12 people in his church
[1:51:00] in Ephesus the Ephesian church was the
[1:51:02] greatest Church of all of them greatest
[1:51:05] of all of them remember Ephesians types
[1:51:07] Joshua and there you see that these are
[1:51:08] a special people that's where you see
[1:51:11] the full mystery revealed it's where you
[1:51:13] see the full blessings the full grace of
[1:51:14] God on them they were the most mature
[1:51:16] believer in the old test in the New
[1:51:17] Testament and it was Paul's own church
[1:51:20] and he only had
[1:51:21] 12 Paul has 12 what hope do the rest of
[1:51:23] us have why cuz it's just a select elect
[1:51:27] few we're not taking back this world
[1:51:29] we're not taking back this country we're
[1:51:31] not taking back this province or this
[1:51:32] city or even this little Community we're
[1:51:35] not taking it back we're getting out of
[1:51:37] here that's what we're focused on yeah
[1:51:40] there's only one hope and that's Hebrews
[1:51:42] 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:51:45] today and forever it's a living God it's
[1:51:47] an everpresent God I was counseling
[1:51:50] somebody a while ago and I said listen
[1:51:51] I've only got one remedy for you and
[1:51:54] that's Jesus Christ give your life to
[1:51:56] him and it'll take care of your
[1:51:59] situation I I said it won't change your
[1:52:01] situation it'll change how you go
[1:52:02] through your
[1:52:04] situation because what they don't they
[1:52:06] don't need a situation change they need
[1:52:07] an inner man change an inner woman
[1:52:09] change whatever that might be I said
[1:52:11] give your life to him and it'll take
[1:52:14] care of everything you're looking for
[1:52:15] we're a broken record we are a broken
[1:52:18] record come to Christ or perish that's
[1:52:21] the only thing we have to offer
[1:52:23] is Christ the word amen but what happens
[1:52:25] what people want to go in
[1:52:27] between what did Joshua say choose you
[1:52:30] this day make a clear decision draw the
[1:52:34] line and step one way or the other but
[1:52:35] don't live in the middle because that's
[1:52:36] the most miserable place you can be is
[1:52:38] on the line neither in nor out committed
[1:52:41] uncommitted no no no get in or get out
[1:52:44] be hot or be
[1:52:45] cold make a
[1:52:47] choice but what happens when we do that
[1:52:50] we make that choice and we step into the
[1:52:52] Dominion of
[1:52:53] Christ we get the benefits in the power
[1:52:56] of His domain now his Dominion his
[1:52:58] kingdom his power his Spirit brother
[1:53:01] Bram says this and we're going to
[1:53:03] close he says symptoms are something
[1:53:05] like say tomorrow when you go home now
[1:53:08] to your place the express agent will
[1:53:10] come up and say are you Mrs doe yes I
[1:53:13] have a present for you all right what is
[1:53:15] it he hands over a box and you hear
[1:53:17] something hitting in that box and you're
[1:53:19] looking it it's a big box of snakes
[1:53:21] rattlesnakes
[1:53:22] he says 'well you don't want them things
[1:53:24] well you say I don't want them he says
[1:53:26] oh but they're yours somebody sent them
[1:53:28] to you here's your name here's a name
[1:53:31] it's somebody sent the snakes to you
[1:53:32] they're yours you have to take them
[1:53:35] we're talking about
[1:53:36] Dominion he says now in one sense of the
[1:53:39] word they're yours and in another sense
[1:53:41] they're not how are they yours your
[1:53:44] names on
[1:53:45] them but remember when you're under a
[1:53:48] kingdom it's not your name it's the
[1:53:49] king's name amen I am no longer Jonathan
[1:53:53] klet I am Christ I'm a
[1:53:56] Christian so my name I don't have to
[1:53:58] accept things in because I do all things
[1:54:01] in his
[1:54:02] name he says in one sense they're yours
[1:54:04] and another they're not somebody sent
[1:54:06] them to you but they're not yours until
[1:54:08] you sign for them that you've received
[1:54:09] them he says and when you sign that
[1:54:12] you've received them then they're yours
[1:54:14] but if you refuse to sign for them he
[1:54:16] has to take them back to the express
[1:54:18] company and the express company has to
[1:54:20] send them back to the one them sent them
[1:54:22] to you he says is that right amen when
[1:54:24] they come up to your door and they hand
[1:54:26] you a package if you say I didn't order
[1:54:28] this and I don't want it they have to
[1:54:29] take it
[1:54:31] back you don't have to assign you don't
[1:54:33] have to sign for it you don't have to
[1:54:34] accept it he says well don't sign for
[1:54:37] nothing the devil brought he says no sir
[1:54:40] just refuse to have it no sir say I just
[1:54:42] haven't got it devil you take it all
[1:54:44] back that's all I won't have it refuse
[1:54:47] to have your sickness your arthritis
[1:54:49] whatever it is I just haven't got it by
[1:54:52] his Stripes I'm Healed he says stand
[1:54:54] right on your
[1:54:56] ground you've got to stand and know that
[1:54:58] it is your ground you're on then he says
[1:55:02] confess
[1:55:03] it what we overcome by the blood of the
[1:55:06] lamb and the word of Our Testimony our
[1:55:08] words matter don't say it in your head
[1:55:10] Church don't say it in your head say it
[1:55:13] out loud and I don't care who hears you
[1:55:15] say this does not belong to me Satan
[1:55:18] take it back you have to talk to him you
[1:55:22] have to command him you'll never see
[1:55:24] Jesus praying in his mind to
[1:55:26] Satan having a conversation with Satan
[1:55:29] in his mind he speaks the word we have
[1:55:32] to confess it we have to believe it and
[1:55:35] then what do we do stay there and say
[1:55:38] uh-uh no this is my property this is my
[1:55:42] life you're not allowed here you're not
[1:55:45] a part of this
[1:55:47] Kingdom he says stay there God will
[1:55:51] bring it to pass
[1:55:54] immediately no God will bring it to pass
[1:55:58] his word never fails he says no matter
[1:56:01] what it is just believe him now I want
[1:56:05] you to see what this looks like because
[1:56:07] so often what we're looking for and this
[1:56:09] is our human the human elements of us is
[1:56:11] we're thinking that the sickness will
[1:56:13] come and great faith will rise up and it
[1:56:15] never comes on us at
[1:56:17] all what that's what we're looking for
[1:56:19] we're looking for a future realm or a
[1:56:21] future power or situation where we just
[1:56:24] refuse it upfront and nothing comes on
[1:56:26] us but that is not what the scripture
[1:56:29] promises it says we will get sick but if
[1:56:31] we pray the prayer of faith we will
[1:56:33] recover if we cast out Devils they will
[1:56:36] leave but listen brother bradam prayed
[1:56:38] for John Ry and it took two weeks for
[1:56:40] him to get healed of his truly healed in
[1:56:42] terms of the manifestation of his eyes
[1:56:44] he was blind and brother Bram he came to
[1:56:46] brother Bram the next day and he
[1:56:47] couldn't see he said I thought you said
[1:56:49] I was healed he said I thought you said
[1:56:50] you believed so often what we're saying
[1:56:52] is where is God and God's saying where
[1:56:53] are the Believers where are those that
[1:56:56] will accept it confess it and believe it
[1:56:57] and stay there amen but I want you to
[1:57:01] see what this looks like because as many
[1:57:02] of you know my sister atanta she was
[1:57:04] healed of uh of stage four Hodgkins
[1:57:07] lymphoma back in 2018 but she gave a
[1:57:10] testimony and and brother John Andes has
[1:57:12] taken them taken it and put it into
[1:57:14] words of what she was going through and
[1:57:16] and kind of what that process was
[1:57:18] because remember Satan sent her a box of
[1:57:20] cancer and he sent him with an x-ray
[1:57:22] that said you've got
[1:57:25] cancer now she can't deny that the B
[1:57:27] what's in the box but she can deny that
[1:57:30] ain't for me amen remember brother Bram
[1:57:33] says it's yours but it's not really
[1:57:35] yours she said this isn't for me why
[1:57:40] because his word says by his stripes I'm
[1:57:44] Healed catch this these are her own
[1:57:46] words and this is what she says right
[1:57:48] after they got the diagnosis okay she
[1:57:50] has a 7 cm uh tumor on her right side
[1:57:54] she's got Hodgkins lymphoma spread all
[1:57:56] throughout her lungs and into her nodes
[1:57:58] and these different things she says
[1:58:00] these are her words exact words while
[1:58:02] this was a great shock I began to look
[1:58:05] to God for comfort and healing and we
[1:58:08] encouraged our family to do the same
[1:58:10] church I'm not running around looking
[1:58:11] for healing until I need healing
[1:58:14] amen but when the need arises then the
[1:58:17] faith has to come with it the word has
[1:58:19] to raise up a standard she says and we
[1:58:21] encouraged our family to do the same we
[1:58:23] made what a conscious decision not to
[1:58:27] fear we have to choose we have to decide
[1:58:31] how things are going to
[1:58:33] go he says and the bad she says we made
[1:58:36] a conscious decision to fear not to fear
[1:58:38] and the battle was on okay the lines are
[1:58:42] drawn you're not allowed to come on and
[1:58:45] he's trying to push in she said I
[1:58:47] experienced many wonderful moments in
[1:58:50] the Lord in that battle
[1:58:53] Church we're talking about real life now
[1:58:56] she says I experienced many dark moments
[1:59:00] during that
[1:59:01] time I lost more weight getting down to
[1:59:04] 95 PBS Church there's there's the box of
[1:59:07] rattlesnakes you've got cancer you're
[1:59:09] losing weight you're losing the battle
[1:59:11] and what is she doing Satan's trying to
[1:59:13] bully her into taking it many of you
[1:59:16] know my sister she's just a little thing
[1:59:17] the wind blows and she falls over and
[1:59:19] now she's getting lighter and lighter
[1:59:21] and it looks like 's
[1:59:23] winning watch the process now see we see
[1:59:27] us moving back or getting weak and we
[1:59:30] think I don't have it no resist the
[1:59:35] devil
[1:59:37] resist power is not yours the resistance
[1:59:41] is yours he only said
[1:59:44] resist I can't move Satan for anything
[1:59:47] but I can resist him with everything
[1:59:49] I've got and then I can trust in the
[1:59:51] ever loving hands of
[1:59:53] God watch this what did they do there
[1:59:56] they decided on their mindset and they
[1:59:59] stuck with
[2:00:00] it I shall not fear why because we have
[2:00:05] a spirit that casts out all fear perfect
[2:00:09] love cast it out we haven't received a
[2:00:11] spirit again to fear as we read
[2:00:13] earlier catch
[2:00:15] this I was strengthened
[2:00:20] oh I was strengthened by the love and
[2:00:23] the scriptural encouragement shown to me
[2:00:25] at that time and I looked to God for
[2:00:28] healing what would she doing reminding
[2:00:30] herself who she was and who her daddy
[2:00:33] was she says it immediately no no no it
[2:00:39] gradually became real to me that God
[2:00:41] truly is a
[2:00:44] Healer how do you know God's a provider
[2:00:46] church he provides how do you know God's
[2:00:49] A Healer you get sick and he heals how
[2:00:53] do you know that he's a guide you lose
[2:00:54] your way and he shows you the
[2:00:58] way I gradually it gradually became real
[2:01:00] to me that God truly is a Healer that he
[2:01:03] took stripes on his back the day he went
[2:01:04] to Calvary for my
[2:01:07] healing she says I began to believe his
[2:01:12] promises you know my sister she's a holy
[2:01:16] ghost
[2:01:17] filled stable well-founded Christian I
[2:01:21] don't think anybody would deny it but
[2:01:24] she had to come up higher she had to
[2:01:26] step up because what the battle was
[2:01:30] raging I began why she' never had to
[2:01:33] believe like
[2:01:34] this she' never had to believe like this
[2:01:37] she had never faced something that she
[2:01:39] couldn't deal with with some aspirin or
[2:01:40] some penicillin or something basic
[2:01:43] doctoral work
[2:01:44] even she says I began to believe his
[2:01:47] promises and I began to even look for a
[2:01:51] super
[2:01:52] natural
[2:01:54] intervention what's she doing she's
[2:01:56] resisting she's pushing back she's
[2:01:59] feeding the inner
[2:02:01] woman and she began to have faith which
[2:02:05] means she didn't have it in the first
[2:02:06] place what it's growing inside of her
[2:02:09] it's the spirit of God raising up a
[2:02:12] standard what did she do Church she made
[2:02:15] up her mind it's de Deliverance or
[2:02:18] nothing it's healing or it's nothing see
[2:02:22] Satan will keep us right in that land of
[2:02:23] compromise live with it I'll reduce the
[2:02:27] impact I'll let you live a little
[2:02:30] while no no no it's victory or it's
[2:02:36] death it's all the way or it's no
[2:02:40] way that's what the word
[2:02:42] says total Victory when they went into
[2:02:45] the land of
[2:02:47] Canaan what did they say what did God
[2:02:50] say kill them every
[2:02:52] everyone let nothing live and you know
[2:02:55] what Israel did and we'll get into this
[2:02:56] in the next couple of services is they
[2:02:59] went in there and they said we're going
[2:03:00] to make it work for us we're going to
[2:03:03] let you live and we're going to let you
[2:03:05] generate wealth for us and we'll just
[2:03:06] take a tax we'll take a tithe we'll take
[2:03:07] whatever it is and we'll benefit from
[2:03:09] you and you know what happened is those
[2:03:10] people got stronger and stronger then
[2:03:12] God used them against the Israelites
[2:03:13] when they fell out of
[2:03:15] favor kill
[2:03:17] it God's solution is always total
[2:03:19] Destruction of Satan's kingdom
[2:03:25] so she's pushing back and she's
[2:03:27] beginning and she's beginning and then
[2:03:29] what happens we've all seen the the
[2:03:31] video of her in that service when they
[2:03:32] saying um leaning was it leaning on the
[2:03:35] Everlasting Arms right and she danced
[2:03:37] around that church in Victory and I
[2:03:40] think it was the next day or two she
[2:03:42] went to the
[2:03:44] doctors she said to the astonishment of
[2:03:46] my doc of the doctor all traces of
[2:03:50] cancer were gone including the 7 cm
[2:03:52] tumor in my lung over 4 years later I'm
[2:03:55] still giving glory to God for his
[2:03:57] wonderful Healing Touch 6 years now
[2:03:59] let's Stand
[2:04:01] Together Church you look at that picture
[2:04:04] there's no
[2:04:05] compromise this isn't a partial
[2:04:08] Victory this is a total Deliverance why
[2:04:12] because she has
[2:04:13] Dominion she has property rights she has
[2:04:17] a god of supreme authority living inside
[2:04:21] of her
[2:04:22] and she didn't realize how great that
[2:04:24] God was until this
[2:04:27] battle see so often like I said before
[2:04:30] we say I don't have a choice and we go
[2:04:33] the way of compromise but God saying I
[2:04:35] want to give you total Victory I want to
[2:04:38] give you total Deliverance I want to
[2:04:40] give you total
[2:04:42] provision but you got to back away from
[2:04:44] your compromise you've got to say I am
[2:04:48] determined that this is what will Happ
[2:04:51] the preeminence in my life
[2:04:54] amen I said it last service church and
[2:04:56] I'm going to keep saying it how
[2:04:59] important is it to have the Holy
[2:05:01] Ghost not just on you in you it is life
[2:05:06] it is peace it is Joy it's provision
[2:05:09] it's victory it's Deliverance it's rest
[2:05:11] it's satisfaction it's contentment all
[2:05:14] of those things are those attributes and
[2:05:16] that's the dunamis we are talking about
[2:05:18] it's the literal attributes of Christ
[2:05:20] now coming into you and enforcing his
[2:05:23] dominion over your own
[2:05:26] life and so if we've got
[2:05:29] it if we've got it are we letting it
[2:05:33] have
[2:05:35] dominion and this is the great question
[2:05:37] isn't
[2:05:39] it does it have
[2:05:41] dominion does it truly have
[2:05:44] dominion see we want it for our bodies
[2:05:46] we want it for our lives we want it for
[2:05:48] our family but the thing is it's got to
[2:05:49] have full dominion over me it's got to
[2:05:52] have full dominion over you and when
[2:05:53] that happens you'll find the rest Falls
[2:05:56] right into
[2:05:57] place that's what happened on the day of
[2:05:59] Pentecost was they finally got out of
[2:06:01] their own way and the Holy Spirit walked
[2:06:03] down those stairs and it converted 3,000
[2:06:07] people in 10
[2:06:09] minutes when we let
[2:06:11] go when we let God have his way in our
[2:06:14] lives let him set up his kingdom here
[2:06:16] then he makes us a king to those that
[2:06:18] are around us that would come to us for
[2:06:20] help
[2:06:22] that we can pray that we can expect that
[2:06:23] we can believe in a
[2:06:25] supernatural
[2:06:27] expectation for the events that we're
[2:06:29] facing in our lives
[2:06:32] amen without it we're a city Without
[2:06:34] Walls and anything can come in and out
[2:06:38] but when that Holy Spirit takes up
[2:06:39] residence it builds Walls by the word
[2:06:41] and all of a sudden we're a city sit on
[2:06:43] a hill where a light that can't be
[2:06:45] hidden we're Overcomers we're more than
[2:06:47] Overcomers amen we're the Victorious
[2:06:49] Church of the bride of Christ
[2:06:52] we're healed we're everything that he is
[2:06:55] the very attributes of God are resting
[2:06:56] inside of us and it's for a people that
[2:06:59] will let it have dominion in their own
[2:07:01] lives first amen we still have
[2:07:05] battles we still have battles amen we
[2:07:08] still fight we still struggle we have
[2:07:11] the dayby day one with the Flesh and the
[2:07:13] question is who has dominion over our
[2:07:15] flesh today because if he's got it in
[2:07:18] our heart if he's got it in our mind if
[2:07:19] he's got it in our soul then what
[2:07:21] happens is the flesh will become subject
[2:07:23] to the Dominion that's inside of that
[2:07:25] and it'll bring about every promise of
[2:07:27] God that He gave us by his word
[2:07:31] amen we've got to realize our position
[2:07:34] that that Dominion comes with absolute
[2:07:36] Authority sovereignty and property
[2:07:39] rights that we can say Satan you have no
[2:07:43] place in my
[2:07:46] life and when he tries to send you a
[2:07:48] package when he tries to set up camp
[2:07:49] when he tries to squat on your land you
[2:07:51] can say you've got to go because you're
[2:07:53] not a part of this title deed you're not
[2:07:55] a part of this Kingdom and therefore you
[2:07:58] can't be here and what happens is the
[2:08:00] authority of the Holy Spirit comes
[2:08:01] behind you to push him out of our Lives
[2:08:05] amen look at
[2:08:09] that look at
[2:08:11] that simple
[2:08:13] housewife simple
[2:08:16] mother that took God at his word it took
[2:08:19] two months but she took God at his word
[2:08:22] and what happened is he came down and he
[2:08:24] Vindicated his word in her
[2:08:26] body to prove he's alive and well and
[2:08:30] that when we give him
[2:08:32] Dominion that he'll hold nothing good
[2:08:34] from us and that every attribute of his
[2:08:38] spirit and his nature is available for
[2:08:40] the bride for her day-to-day walk
[2:08:44] amen you want
[2:08:46] that do you want that do you want every
[2:08:49] bit that he has for you
[2:08:54] that's the desire I believe of every
[2:08:57] every true son and daughter's heart is
[2:08:58] Lord I want more of you I want
[2:09:01] everything you have for me and it comes
[2:09:03] with that then desire to lay down
[2:09:05] everything else amen the first thing
[2:09:08] we've got to overcome the greatest enemy
[2:09:09] is this inner man if we can surrender
[2:09:12] that God just can flow through US amen
[2:09:15] that's my desire amen I want him to be
[2:09:17] king of me before I can ever be king of
[2:09:19] anything else amen let's pray our
