brother garfield grant and his family we certainly want to welcome you my brother and your whole family and man god is good and then these days it's uh very difficult to travel and not have some sort of hiccup so to get everyone back and more or less on time and in one piece it's uh it's a good thing amen i mean glad to be here this evening acts chapter 17 verse 22 says then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you god had not made the world and all the things or god that made the world and all things therein seen that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with men's hands as though he needed anything seen he giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and had determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us for we in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we also are also his offspring for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone grave him by art and man's device amen god bless his word you may be seated this evening amen i'm going to be continuing on our our series on in his form and with his mind and i want to continue with a subtitle this evening of pouring in with purpose and for those that missed almost half the church here tonight we spoke last service about the emptying out and and before they could have a pentecostal outpouring before they could receive the baptism of the holy ghost they had to get emptied out they had to get cleaned out they had to get scoured out they had to get themselves set aside so that god could come in and live inside of them by the holy ghost amen we talked about even before that how when god does something he often does it suddenly amen it seems like you're sitting and you're waiting and you're waiting and the promise is giving and nothing's happening oft times you'll see even things are getting worse and worse and worse so they're degenerating and then all of a sudden what happens is god moves and he makes his word happen he brings the fulfillment of the promise and you on you you then understand it has nothing to do with what i could see or what i could feel or the circumstances that were around it amen but god does it in his time and in his season and he does it perfectly every single time when god does it he does it perfectly and then when we looked at what happened on the day of pentecost it took them 10 days to get to the place that they needed to be and we know that after this peter was a changed man remember when we've read the scripture many times where jesus told peter he says when you're converted strengthen thy brethren and that is a man that had the revelation of who jesus christ was he had power over sickness and devils amen he had cast them out under the ministry he had with christ while he was on this earth but he had to come to an upper room experience where he died and something else started to live inside of him amen and before this we know peter was inclined towards violence he was a right-wing zealot he was big into politics he was big into the the freedom of israel and these different things and he had deep spiritual revelation but yet he was still tied to the to the things and the thoughts of the world in so many ways and we know that when it really counted peter cracked under the pressure didn't he when it could when it came time for him to stand and be counted then he wouldn't be counted and not only that but he reverted back to his old nature and that was to curse and say i know nothing of this man i'm not a part of this christ that you're speaking of amen what he needed something inside him that would anchor and hold him when the times got tough and he wasn't ready to stand there until he had his upper room experience was he a child before this was he a child of god he was always a child of god amen does our actions don't change who we are right they just change how god responds to us and what he can trust us with but peter was always a child of god god can see the seed gene inside of each and every one of us but god has to bring us to a place where he can use us and he was bringing peter and 119 others to a place where he could be used amen and he had to bring him someplace where his identity got lost and another identity came into him amen we saw how it was god the father above us we saw how it was god stepping down into christ and the whole point of this series of in his form with his mind is to show the progression of god changing his form from from from the great god elohim the self-existing one into a pillar of light a pillar of fire down into christ and now he stepped down into a multi-member body called the bride of jesus christ amen and that is the only christ this world is going to see amen they don't see him when he comes down to get us we meet him in the clouds they don't see him the only time they see him later is when we come back with him isn't that right so the only christ they'll see in this day is going to be what the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god on this earth amen now we read in the last service this quote and it kind of tells us what peter needed and i want to just for the sake of those that didn't hear perhaps and just to remind ourselves of what the prophet of god said he said god trains his men then he anoints them gives them experience takes them through the rigid training down through the sands of bernie's burning punishment trying and testing not only does he do that to his prophets but he does it to his children every son that cometh to god must be chastened and tried tested by his word because he says what see when the pinch comes the strong time when it faces death are you able to stand there on the word of god and say god said so that settles it that's what he's looking for somebody that can stand asher that has a foundation that can't be moved it's not built on sand but it's built on rocks so that when the storms of light come when the impressions of this world when the influences line against us then what happens is we stand there and say god said so and i'm going to stay with what he said amen peter had lots of training when he was with christ on this earth amen but he needed more than just unanointing because he had an anointing jesus breathed on them and he he told them he said go out and cast out devils and healing my name and these things he had an anointing he had an authority given to him but he needed the anointing amen because it wasn't just one christ because brother brahm talks but he says if there's going to be false christs that means there also has to be real christs on the earth and that is what anointed ones the anointed ones not just anointed ones but the anointed ones and peter had to become a modern-day christ he had to be an anointed one that could do the same things that jesus did amen so that when the time came down and he had to choose between his finances in the word he take the word when it came time to choose between his job and the word then he'd take the word his health and the word his head and his word and the word he choose the word every time until he even gave his life and was crucified upside down amen but i want to talk about what happened on that day of pentecost in the upper room because as we're talking about god moving from form to form we want to see that it didn't just start there but it's continued all the way down through the ages to even today in this age to where every son and daughter when they receive the holy spirit something happens to them that happened to peter and those 119 others on that day amen and this is about the church this is about the called out ones these are about the anointed ones these are the ones that god has chosen for this age for a very specific service or purpose amen and i want to dig into what happened on the day of pentecost because if you know what happened then you'll know what god has for you you know what god has called you to be and why he's even done it in the first place amen we don't just get the holy ghost so that if we die then we resurrect and go to heaven to meet him later and if we have the holy ghost we don't just get it so we can go on a rapture i mean that's where we're going because of it that's the destination that's what we're sealed to but between then and now now and then rather something else is happening and god has a purpose for everyone that has the holy ghost on this on this planet amen now we know what happened in the upper room was the new birth that's what we call it when you get the holy ghost we call that the new birth and it's not just a an anointing on on your on your flesh remember brother branham says you can have the holy ghost anointing on your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell why because it's just something that's around you but it's not something that's in you but when you're sealed he says your soul is sealed to the day of your redemption which is the rapture and the resurrection the prophet of god would say look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation now i want you to notice there he says the center of what the doctrine no he says the center of the life of the revelation that means that there's something that comes out of every revelation that he gives you and it's life it's a way of being it's a way of doing it's a way of thinking it has an effect on you it's not just intellectual knowledge but there's a life that comes from that revelation he says that is what christ is is not just a revelation but it's a life behind that revelation right he says christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what god is trying to do he's trying to take it off the pages and put it into living living people he says what is the new birth then you'd say well brother bryan what is the new birth he says it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen he says see so there's a revelation that you have to have and there's a revelation that i have to have and that revelation is not always the exact same thing and we'll see as we go through here he says not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a creed you promised to live by a coat of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says or what takes place it's christ he says pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built on and everything else is shifting sands and everything else will fail he says what is it it's christ being revealed that he is the word can somebody pass this move this forward and it's christ being revealed that he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see this is the key to the whole thing when the word is revealed it will express itself so a revelation without an expression is what intellectuality right it's dead it doesn't mean there's not some life in it but there's no life has come out so it's only intellectual to that point he says when the word is revealed it will express itself we preached on this that god's word cannot return unto him void god doesn't come to send us an intellectual representation god comes to do what give us life and that more abundantly so what it has to be expressed and manifested not just expressed through word but expressed through life he says that's god's purpose for jesus christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws and fulfill his law by death and christ god died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious pride redeem back that will believe only in the word of god he says and she will not swap it like eve did for intellectual conceptions of men what high revelations without a life behind them he says you see it that's christ's idea that's god is the god's idea the new birth reveals this what the new birth reveals a bride that will only believe the word of god and she will manifest it amen i love great doctrine i love great emotion i love i love the praise and the worship and the songs and the services and these things but that's not it that's what sets an atmosphere for it but that's not it he says there's got to be a manifestation that comes out of this amen the new birth is someone that will not only believe it but they'll live it amen he says the new birth is christ is a revelation god has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth he says now what are you going to do when you get all that group together what all the ones that have a revelation of christ in who in themselves i can't have brother mark's revelation of christ because that's for him and it's going to be specific to him because it's a multi-member body he's going to show a portion of christ that maybe i won't so he's got to have his revelation sister moines has to have one brother gerald has to have one sister brenda brother bob we all have to have our portion of that revelation because that's what we've got to live now that doesn't exclude us from doing something in the word because i don't have that revelation no we're to be obedient to every word of it but the expression the full manifestation of that is going to be in piecemeal from each and every one of us in that bright body because together we're the perfect expression i'm not the perfect expression i'm the perfect expression of the little portion that he's given to me amen that takes the pressure off doesn't it that i don't have to be all things i've got to just be what he told me to be what he's called me to be amen so when you have a revelation of your part and i have a revelation of my part then what happens he says what he says oh if the church only knew its position no he says where the revelation is perfectly in harmony so if you know your place and i know my place then what happens we can fit together and there's no bumps right there's no budding heads and knuckles is there why because i know my spot and you know your spot and we're not worried about anything else we just fit right in the way we're supposed to there's no friction then why because it's revelation built on revelation and we're just being molded and tied and joined together like it talks about in ephesians he says what now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and god expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is let me say that that's a revelation only god can reveal amen i can't give it to you i can preach the word time blue in the face but god has to open your eyes and your heart to what it is you're supposed to be doing on this earth right in this age right now amen because it's the revelation of christ in you i've got the revelation for christ to me and i'm getting the revelation of christ to me you've got to make sure you're getting the revelation of christ in you amen and i don't believe we fully got it yet because the prophet of god said when we do the rapture will go so i believe we see portions of it and we see bits of it and we have moments and situations where we see the word just come out so perfectly and beautifully and we look back and we say whoa what happened there that's not the way i used to do that anybody else would have done something different that wasn't sealed with the holy ghost but out of that came the word and it was christ coming out of you and it's christ coming out of me manifesting in the situations in the lives that we live each and every day amen but we're coming to the place now where we're what we're stepping into that true place where we know what he's doing and what he wants done brother branham talks about it different parts but i don't believe we fully realize it yet i don't believe we do paul said this for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away the prophet of god said when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away with he says perfect redeeming unadulterated love of the holy ghost into a human soul that's passed from dead unto life amen that's what he says that that perfection looks like when it comes amen is that redeeming perfect unadulterated love of the holy spirit he'd say later on he said but when that which is perfect it has come that which is in part shall be done away with see that perfect what is perfect he says love what is love god so let us lay aside all these little dead works and ordinances and go on to perfection he says you see we per were perfected through christ and how do we get into it by holy spirit baptism all right what happens you've passed from death unto life well do i shake and jump and do it he says you don't you don't have to do nothing you've already done it what was your part die your power was to die his part is to make you live again amen he says god brought you from death unto life and you're alive he says then the fruits of your life show it you don't you don't you don't produce those fruits of your own uh making or effort it just comes out of you amen as the prophet god would say sheep bear wool they don't have to stop and think about okay i'm gonna push out a bit of wall tonight but this comes out of them naturally he says by your fruits you're going to know them the holy spirit fruits are going to come out of a life that's full of the love of god amen but that's not the end of it amen it's not the end of it you get the holy spirit you're sealed to the day of your redemption but that's not it there's more from there and the pro and and the apostle paul talks about it amen because we get a sea a seal and it seals our soul until what we go on that rapture in that resurrection but when we come back to first corinthians 13 the apostle paul says when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things but then he says for now we see through a glass darkly he's the apostle he's the prophet of the age he's got the holy ghost he's sealed to the day of his redemption and he says now we see through a glass darkly that means he says i don't understand it all yet i'm not fully mature yet i'm not where i'm going to be eventually he says there's some place i've got to go with this holy ghost baptism there's something that's got to happen beyond this new birth and i'm going to have to progress towards it amen he's not talking to unbelievers he's talking to holy ghost-filled believers and he's saying you're only seen through a glass darkly he says but then i'll see face-to-face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known so what he says now we see through a glass darkly that's like speaking as a child acting as a child he says but there comes a place where you step out from behind the tinted glass and you understand what this is all about and you understand who you are and you understand what you are and you understand why you're here and what god's trying to do in your life amen if you're looking through tinted glasses it's hard to see especially when the outside is dark looking through your sunglasses at night is not going to serve you very well is it and it's very dark outside isn't it in this world it's very dark there's no light but when you step up from behind it that's when things change it's funny because paul says then face to face you look at his damascus experience that was pretty face to face you'd think you think that was the moment that was where he really understood all this the holy spirit in the pillar of fire knocks him down off of his horse and paul says that's not the face-to-face experience i'm talking about that was only the start of something but there's something more and it's where there's a unity between christ and his bride that is so exceptional that she is him and he is her that's what we're going towards amen the prophet of god speaking of the day of pentecost in the upper room experience initially would say this he said now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminences all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was was poured into the church the believers now this is him preaching in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed for me personally this is my favorite message because it's a it gives us a view from eternity to eternity it shows us the the mind and the thought of god in the beginning who he was and it takes us all the way through all the way to pass the millennium and then it it shows us the entire mind and purpose of god in in 30 or 40 pages it's an absolutely phenomenal message but brother branham said this so many times that that idea that all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church and we understand we believe that that first part very easily that all that god was he poured into christ in colossians 2 it says as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walking in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as you have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving but where lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vein deceit intellectual revelation i would call that after the tradition of men and after the rudiments of the world and not after christ for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily we can say amen to that very easily can't we we believe that all that god was he poured into christ we saw it in his life we saw it in his actions we saw it in the effect that he had we saw it in the responses that he had everything about christ screamed god is inside of him we believe that what about the part about christ being poured into us because that's a little harder to believe isn't it it's always easier to believe for the other person it's never easy to believe for ourselves but john 14 says and this is jesus speaking he says i will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you then he says i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you personal pronoun the person of christ the anointed one the anointing he says is going to come back on top of you but he says it's in the form of the holy spirit yet a little while in the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also at that day you shall know that i am in the father and you and me and i in you so he says i'm going to pour myself into you church in first john 4 4 he says ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now notice if we've got something inside of us they've got something inside of them too there's an incarnation of satan as well in this world amen and it's through demon spirits and these different things but as there's a a a type there there's a perfect in there in us amen he's just doing there what christ is doing in us he's mirroring what he sees god doing in us and that's that there is something living in us and that's the very life and nature of christ itself first corinthians 6 says what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own the temple is a place of what dwelling and worship so he's saying you're the place where god is to be worshiped not that people will worship me or you god forbid amen but where he is worshipped through the life that has lived here through the things that i do through the things that i don't do the words that i speak the thoughts that i have the attitudes reactions responses modes and objectives all of that is to worship the god that is within us he says for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods so can we see that and agree to it today as is as we say all that christ god was important to christ can we say yes christ has poured something into me amen can we say that i am christ in part today we're not preaching some weird doctrine here i'm saying that if you're a part of the bride of christ then that means there's a portion of christ inside of you and if you don't believe that you're not going to get very far because you've got to believe that the very same life that was in christ jesus is inside of you because that's what's going to raise this mortal body and take it into our into a resurrection or a rapture amen that's the thing that takes us to the other side is the very same life that he had amen amen why we've got to be able to confess we've got the token we've got the ticket that takes us to the other side if you don't have that you're not going to walk up with any confidence you're not going to walk up at all if you don't think you've got a ticket to get on the train to glory you've got to know you've got it you've got to settle that in your heart amen you got to seek it out with fear and trembling amen that's our resting place my resting place is that he sealed me so that it doesn't matter what the storms of life throw at me it doesn't matter what people say doesn't matter what happens with job and finances and health i'm sealed i'm going through no matter what that's my resting place is because it's a work he did not a work that i've done amen brother brahm said all that christ was he poured into the church and many times in many different ways and context and that's what i want to focus on tonight on this thought of pouring in with purpose amen it's not just to get us to a resurrection it's not just get us to a rapture but it's to get us to do something while we're here on this earth now when you experience a new birth there's something that happens and the prophet of god puts it this way this is his own experience this is i believe the last or second last sermon he preached communion he says now then one day as i walked on that voice talking said don't ever smoke drink and so forth and the young fellows and all got older see there was something moving but yet all that once i looked up and said i'm not the son of charles and ella branham there's something calling like my little eagle i'm not a chicken there's something up yonder somewhere oh great jehovah whoever you are open up he says i want to come home there's something in me that's calling he says then i was born again what happened he recognized he had a different identity than he'd had all of his life to that point he says that little life was laying there the life of water was poured upon it and then it began to grow now that old life was forgiven and put in the sea of god's forgetfulness to never be remembered against me no more see now we stand justified as though we never had sinned in the presence of god and you'll see if you look in his life story and you hear him say these things before this moment he had complexes and he had fears and he had insecurities and 99.9 of them were bad they weren't helping him at all yeah he was just his dad was a bootlegger he was partially indian they were poor they didn't have food i mean he was just an outcast amongst people nobody liked the branhams they had to run his dad was in trouble with the law they had to change their name all these things being a branham was not a good thing in brother branham's life but when he gets saved you see that he changes now and god starts to do a work with him because what he's realized that i am not a branham anymore i'm a son of god right i i'm a i'm part of something bigger and better than what i was ever raised up to be now that's one thing to say when your family's full of uh of whiskey-making bootleggers and and law breakers but what if we're in a great family right it's a little harder to say i'm not a part of that family either is it but you got to break that identity to come into his identity because that's the one that he's hoping you'll see that's the one he's waiting on you to see is that you're called to be a member of the bride of christ not to be a member of the coffee family of the lush family of the columbo family of the colette family of the grand family or these different ones he's saying no you've got to come up to a different identity you've got to see your place and you've got to see yourself in a different light amen now we spoke of this the the this filling up last service about the gopher wood but i wanted to cover it again different quotes but the same idea just for the sake of those that missed it because we talked about the emptying out and now we want to get to the pouring in but he says now we find out that gopher wood that's what the ark was made of the first thing the rfb made out of gopher wood it had to be cut down and its own life dried out this is the dying out the emptying out we spoke of last service he said that's the sign of the sinner the sinner before he can get right with god has to dispel all his sin and get white then the gopher what's the lightest there is and a sinner that's repented and laying before god is the most receptive thing there can be that means you're open to something because you've got nothing left to give. he says then the holy spirit comes down now if you put that gopher what in the water it would sink in a few minutes that's right now the sinner's all emptied out and then when the gopher would empty out it becomes light and flexible he says did you ever get real light when you got down there and god forgave your sins and it seemed like he was walking on clouds he said sure emptied out of your own life then god took you to the tabernacle to the gathering of the people and he made you a piece of timber or a stone in a house what he fits you into a group of people amen it's like i've always said from brother paul haley said he says there's only one definition of a lone sheep in the bible and that's lost right there's no such thing as a as a herd of of one sheep no that's a lost sheep what's brother brown say he's fits you into a group of people and he starts to make you a part of that body amen he says and then when you were nailed on like the gopher wood was then they took the rosin out of this tree the pine tree the evergreen and boiled it and poured it into these pores there there that was one sap of no use and no effect and poured the rosin out of the other tree into that and made it as strong as steel and it could stand the judgment he says this is what we're talking about the point in he says then when you poured out all your sinful life and the holy spirit boiled in the fires of calvary has been poured into you it sealed you into the kingdom of god and he says grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption amen he says this is the effect now he says let the world bounce and the chunks and all the other things will never touch a born-again christian amen why because that's dead to you now it's sealed out you've got a case hard and outer section there that nothing can penetrate brother brown would say you couldn't drive a nail into it when they were done that's how hard it was nothing from the outside can get in it's sealed out it's sealed out brother brown says how do you know if you got the holy ghost he says you're dead to the desires that you used to have now satan will play tricks i'll tell you a story it's not mine it's brother cadre diggs brother cadre diggs talks about he says i'm in a store in a clothing store or something he says and the music comes on that i used to like he says and pretty soon my foot's temping i'm kind of starting to move around a little bit and he catches himself he's like huh he says but when i walked out that door the music stayed in the store he says it didn't come with me because all it did was it revived a memory but it did not revive a desire for that amen all it was was triggering something that was in his mind but when he walked out the devil of that rock and roll stayed right in that store because why he was sealed with the holy ghost and nothing from the outside could come in don't let the devil take those memories and make you think you've lost it amen a memory is just a memory amen how you act on it that's what's going to define what's going on inside of you amen he says what christ took that beating that killing that destruction so you could have life he took the shame he took the judgment the humiliation that was the beating out to get the life out of him he took what we were supposed to take so that we could have the life that he had amen what is he doing he's restoring you back to your kingdom position amen and what does he say what does this pouring in look like we talked about the pouring out of our own lives and the emptying out but he says what does this pouring in look like he says the world bounces in the chunks and all the other things they'll never touch a born-again christian so what the politics of the world don't suck us in the ideologies the social justice the sports the music the entertainment the clothing pick your poison amen none of it draws the believer in because it's sealed out it's sealed out it has no effect on them amen prophet of god would say and when you come into christ you're no more of the world you are of christ see you care not them for the things of the world they are dead to you for he that loves the world or the things of the world the love of god is not even in him so you see you can't be an artificial christian there's no such thing he says you can be an artificial professed christian but you can't be a christian and become one until christ injects himself into you by the baptism of the holy ghost then you're connected with him you're no longer twained you are one christ promised to be in us as the father was in christ i and my father are one you and i are one see christ in us all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church to do what to continue the work of the gospel that's why brother brown would talk about us doing another second book of acts because what they continued the gospel and that gospel has never stopped being preached we're at alpha and omega now he was in the first church and he's in the last church perfectly represented right it's going to be the exact same thing it's got to be the same thing he says then we become not by artificial name but by a reality of the holy spirit of life connecting us into christ notice that he says not by artificial name now we'll list up baptist and pentecost and methodists and all these things but guess what you can put message right there too the being identified as a message believer is not the baptism of the holy ghost that's an artificial name amen that's not where we stand we stand on the word that's revealed by the holy spirit amen he says then through the power of his resurrection we're raised from the dead things of the world and setting with him in heavenly places amen he says i like that tonight we're sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus see resurrected with him we've died to the things of the world and took on christ and when we take on christ then the world is dead then we care no more for the world the world is dead to us and it's dead to us he says and we're dead to it amen it doesn't bring you to life it doesn't spur you into action it doesn't cause reactions because what you're as dead dead as it is dead to you there's no resurrecting power in the world so if you're dead the world can't raise up the old dead person can it he says you're a different person different personality because you are a new creation a creation he says not the same creation polished up not a man that's turned a new leaf right this is a new year's resolutions we're talking about he says but a man that's died and been born again and become a new creation in christ jesus and the spirit of the living god lives in the person that's our confession the spirit of the living god is inside of me the spirit of the living god is inside of you that's got to be our confession we've got to believe it not just our confession but our reality amen he says what brother brahm's saying the pouring of christ into your life does one thing up front and that's that it seals out the world amen so you can't be tied into it you can't be joined to it because he built you into another tabernacle he's built you into another body so you can't be part and parcel with the world it's an unholy union it's an unequal yoking it can't be done with the true believer it won't stick sometimes we get caught in traps and we get sucked into things and it may last temporarily but in the end if you're a child of god it has to pull away because it can't penetrate in and hold on right what's he saying he says you're a different person not the same creation polish not a man that's turned a new leaf i'm not jonathan corlett version 2.0 no jonathan curlett is dead and christ now lives in me amen and he calls me something else and that's mrs jesus christ jonathan colette has to be dead he has to die amen i have a new identity my old person is dead he doesn't exist anymore that's why i can't go back to it it's dead i can't go back and resurrect it i can't go back to my old life it's dead it doesn't exist anymore it can't come back to life because the life has moved out of it and there's a new life living in me now amen it's died and i've got a new identity and i've got a new life amen the prophet of god says now the purpose what was god's purpose in sending the holy spirit not to just take us to a resurrection and rapture he said god's purpose we find here and sending the holy spirit was one purpose that god himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that's why we have the holy ghost so god can do something through us he says that god was in christ continuing his plans through christ and out of christ into the church continuing his work through the church now we know what the holy spirit is we found out last night that it's god now when we think of god the fathers jesus spoke of here his father god the son is jesus god the holy spirit is what we call it today now that does not mean that there's three individual distinct gods it means that there is one god in three offices we know these things he says may we say it like this he says all that god was he poured into christ because he emptied himself and poured it into christ and christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily and all that jehovah was he poured into christ and then here's our part he says all that christ was he poured into the church not into one individual not into one ministry not into one man not into one physical church but what he says but into the entire body he says there where we come together in unity where in the body of the bride in the body of christ there where we come together in unity we have power not in silos not in individual churches not in individual ministries but when the bride comes together in one big unity he says that's where we have power he says all that was in god god was was in christ and all that christ was is in you because remember remember what they said to jesus he said they that you're you're casting out these these devils and diseases by the power of satan he says a kingdom divided against itself can't stand and so when we set up camps and we set up the these doctrinal this and and ministry that and whatnot what are we doing it's a kingdom divided against itself and there can't be full unity and if there isn't full unity there can't be full power because if i got if i'm trying to lift something off the ground and i've got one hand lifting and one hand pushing that ain't gonna move is it it's gonna stay right there because i'm fighting against myself and it's the same thing with the bride of christ when we get caught up into isms and personalities and charisma and gifts and signs and wonders of this one and that one what happens is it divides the body rather than pulls it together i was talking to brother joe about this i read a quote that was wonderful for me because brother brahm says he says some men preach like a building on fire he says and then there are others i said i'm others but he didn't say i wasn't a minister because i didn't preach like there was a house on fire right and he was pointing out that every gift is not the same every person's not the same and our value is equal regardless of the gift because why we've each got a portion of christ to give out amen amen you look at a church where the people are in factions one wants this pastor one wants this pastor one wants this preacher one backs this deacon one back zach deacon one wants this one in sunday school one wants that one in sunday school and what happens is what it's fractured and nothing happens there it drives the spirit of god completely out of the church because it's what a bunch of men doing denominational things rather than submitting themselves to the holy spirit amen what do you do you say lord is this my church and if this is your church and he says yes this is your church and what do you do you get your shoulder to the wheel and you push whatever direction that the church has led you push that's all we do that's what we do brother brown said if you've got 51 vote for it and 50 vote against it he said there are 49 vote against he says that's a holy ghost majority you say it's barely one way or the other it doesn't matter you go the way the church is going and trust me that's the holy spirit leading amen and then what if he says no it's not your church then the next thing you say is what where do i go then i've been there done that i remember back in in one place where we were and and we were praying about leaving and we had a minister come from the united states come up knew nothing about us knew nothing about our situation or whatever and he was preaching there and we'd talk beforehand about leaving and and we were possibly going to leave in the middle of the school year and it was going to impact our kids transcripts and grades and make things difficult we were saying well maybe we could wait till the the summer and just make things simpler and the man of god gets up now this is the holy spirit moving in the minister okay he knows nothing about us and he says don't worry about your kid's transcripts he says if you're not supposed to be here get up and go he said exactly what we were talking about what it's the word discerning the spirit and the thoughts and the intents of the heart and he comes out and he says don't worry about that kind of stuff don't get caught up in the what-ifs if god moves your move and if god stays you then stay and get your shoulder to the wheel but don't go back and forth don't waffle the worst thing is a waffley person let your yay be in your navy nay amen why because if you're not where you're supposed to be you'll be of no good where you are and you won't be of any good until you get where you're supposed to go so find the will of god and get there that's what i've had to do and involve moving further than our jamaican friends here to do it but in the end you move you do what god asks you to do amen what are we trying to do get in tune with what the holy spirit wants for us not what's comfortable not what's easy not what not not what always makes sense but to find what he wants us to do and trust he'll work out the rest of the details amen and he's done it time and time again for me brother brown would say now here it is the father was god over you were saying and we've been since adam god the father was over moses the children of israel the pillar of fire then god was with us in christ he walked with us he talked with us ate with us sleep with us he said god over us god with us and now god in us all god was come into christ all christ was come into the church what is it he says it's god working in you if he's working in you that means work has to be done something has to be done we don't just sit on our seats and pews that is not the life of the believers sitting in the pew saying amen to the words that come over the pulpit he says god working in you anywhere in the world that he would want to call on you you're right there working in you to do his good will he says how we ought to thank god for that god the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of god living in his church moving through each age working out his divine will that's why we believe in a message because he came to tell us what the divine will was for this age so he didn't go around trying to do a bunch of things that had nothing to do with our age right remember he said it wasn't wouldn't do moses any good to have noah's message that wouldn't do any good to identify with noah's message in in or in moses day would it we've got a message for our day that takes us to where we're supposed to go in this age then he says when men make fun of you they're not making fun of you they're making fun of him that sent you amen the thing is can you say it's him that sent me am i confident that i'm where he told me to go and doing what he told me to do because then you can rest assured that they're making fun of him not of you so jesus said blessed are ye when men shall say all men are of evil against you falsely for my name's sake blessed are you and then again all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions but when god made himself known in christ they hated him who hated him the worst the church the church hated him the worst they hated him worse than the drunkard they hated him worse than all the other people it was the church that hated him they hated him worse than barabbas the murderer that's how much they hated him that they they they let a killer get away to kill the guy that wouldn't hurt a fleet he said so therefore when you see cosmos the world order the world that knew him not means the church the so-called knew him not he came to his own and his own received him not but as many did receive him to them gave he the power to become sons of god to them that believed in his name he says oh how we should love him and worship him the purpose of god wanting to become in fellowship so he poured himself into us to have fellowship amen and you'll notice that he makes it so that you can't have fellowship with the world because they reject hit you the way they reject him so if you've got fellowship with the world what does it tell you quick checkup if you've got fellowship with the world and it goes real easy when you're around the world then guess what you're not acting like one of his because the world can't have fellowship with a true believer that's why we give them the first admonition the second admonition then we walk away because it's never going to be an agreement they're of a different master they're in a different kingdom they're under a different anointing and it's not the anointing of christ we can't get close it's impossible to get close to someone in the world that way you can't do it it's an unequal joking amen amen and this isn't a quote just for ministries you think well that's the ones that they're the the face of the message of the the face of the churches and they're the ones that are going to get ridiculed and persecuted and these different things no this goes for everyone i believe probably every sister in here has been persecuted in some form or fashion because of her stand for holiness the way she dresses the way she walks the way she talks right somebody out there is going to say boy you're just old-fashioned aren't you oh you stay home you don't go to work my my my yep male privilege it's there it's there you wouldn't believe the stuff that's coming out these days even in work flags are raising initiatives they have sisters you better keep your hat on you better keep the word tight tight because they'll spin you so fast if you get caught up in it it's amazing how far it's spiraling downward i was just reading some things today and i shook my head and said wow i mean it seems like every week they don't just take a step they're 100 yards down the road and just going further and further and they're speeding up they're speeding up towards what death destruction but i want to load you up tonight on the good things about this pouring in because that's what's going to get us out of here is a pouring in and pouring in and pouring in and pouring in lebron says jesus said the father that sent me is with me oh my he says what a declaration what a word the father that sent with sent me come with me listen and as the father sent me so do i send you he says he don't only send you but he goes with you amen he says i'll be with you even in you unto the end of the world all that god was poured out in christ and all that was in christ was emptied out into the believer the church he says god is with you though i am with thee always even to the end of the world that's the declaration of god's world this is not brother brown's word this is god's word here he says that's what the bible says that's what i believe and if we had to stand it alone stand it for it's god's word every man that ever got anywhere had to stand alone on his convictions only that's not in the partnership there's only one who will walk it with you and that's him who made the statement the lord jesus he's the one that'll try the valley with you he'll go through every briar patch and climb every mountain by your side yoke yourself up with him for my yoke is light and my burdens are easy he says don't be yoked up with the things of the world don't be yoked up in different societies and organizations yoke yourself singly with the lord jesus christ in order that you can do it believe he says and see the resurrection why did he pour christ into us he says so that you would know that god is with you i can't feel him brother john he's still with you can't see him brother john he's still with you can't hear him brother john he's still with you what what did david say he says if i send into the heavens thou art there he says if i make my bed in hell thou art there from the top to the bottom and everything in between he says lord thou art there it doesn't matter where i go you're not gonna leave me you're not gonna forsake me amen what is it i'll fail you ministry will fail you churches will fail you people will fail you doctors will fail you spouses will fail you listen we all will fail you every single one of us holy ghost filled or not we're going to fail you he says yoke yourself singly with the lord jesus christ because he's the one that said it and he's the one that'll make it happen amen he says believe it and you'll see the resurrection prophet god continues he says it's god in you all that god was poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church it's god above us god with us and god in us he says no wonder we're commissioned to baptize using father son and holy ghost it's not three different gods it's three offices of one god see god above us in the father god with us in the son cleansing his way condescending coming down making a way for me to get back he says and bring his people back to manifested sons of god like they had them in the garden of eden he says the whole world's a groaning and waiting for that hour for the manifestation of the sons of god he says he has no voice tonight but our voice he has no hands but our hands he has your hands he says then whose hands is it he said i am the vine you are the branches i hope that you'll listen to this poor voice voice tonight and the little still voice of the spirit that can speak in your heart and hear him say it's i be not afraid he says do you believe he says the mind of christ is to be in the church and the mind of christ and the mind of god was in christ and how that the spirit led christ so out his spirit to lead the church and all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church so the church has the power that christ had christ had the power that god had he said at that day you'll know i'm in the father the father and me i in you and you and me now listen to this he says you'll find out that god dwells in his church and in his people the purpose of the holy spirit pouring in is to draw us back to our rightful position as manifested sons and daughters of god amen what did brother brahms say he has no voice but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours he needs help not because he needs it but because that's how he's ordained it right he can create whatever he needs to create out of thin air but he has dedicated himself to using what fallen men and women at this time wear his hands where's feet he's got nothing else like i said the only christ this world is going to see is you and i living out the christ for our day it's the only one they're going to see so are they seeing it are they hearing it are they watching it are they just seeing jonathan curlett so often we're committed to the half day we spend in church every week you know you spend a quarter a couple hours on a wednesday a couple hours on a sunday but he's got six and a half days left outside of that for us to do something for him amen coming to church is great you know what we come to church for to get charged up for the other six and a half days when we're not in church we're coming in here to get built up in the most holy faith to stir up our pure minds by way of remembrance to be put into what kingdom order so that when we walk out the door we're an army in formation to do what the masters will we come in here to encourage each other not just for myself maybe this sermon isn't for everyone maybe it's just for a couple but if we're all sitting there pulling then that person's gonna get what they need amen and i guarantee you if you sit there and pull god will drop something in for you as well amen i've never seen the righteous forsaken nor see begging bread amen doesn't matter who's behind this pope but amen you poll god will give you something i believe he'll do that amen what's brother brahm talk about here he's talking about people that can live christ outside of the church it's easy to say hallelujah praise the lord when the holy spirit's anointing the the building and everything's going great and and satan's been pushed out and and there's no half-naked women walking around and rock and roll playing and job pressures and spouse pressures and it's easy in here but you got to be able to walk out there and live it once the worship ends right when the music fades when everything's done you walk out you got to be able to face the music and still stand up for what you believe amen people that can walk the talk not just preachers either brother brahm says now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice and if you can't preach the people a sermon he says if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that will bring reproach to them that reject it they say no one could put a finger on his or her life they're sweet and living if there was ever a man of god it's that man or woman see he says live your sermons don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you get all mixed up anyhow and messed up and you'll get people tangled up and you won't know he says well you'll ruin them and you'll and yourself too he says just live your sermon the preachers called the preachers and live it too if you can't live it then you stop preaching it but you're supposed to live your sermons he says all right here was voices oh how we needed in jeffersonville how we need in saint john's thousands of lived voices the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness purity undefiled lives walking around in the earth today without a blemish we talk about the seven thunders and the mystery of the thunders brother brown says this is a thunder not the thunder but he says this is a thunder this is god's thunder right here he says yes sir real christians that's thunder against the enemy the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump or how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as it can be and moves right on he says oh my that throws him away that's the thunder that shakes the devil my my my it's not big sermons it's somebody that can do what face the music and walk away unaffected that won't even let satan get in there and rile him up can walk away from every little little thing that sparks up and just say not doing that today won't even have the conversation with them you say brother john i haven't cast out any demons in my life let me ask you this prophet god says have you cast satan out of your own life is he wholly unable to touch you is he sealed out is his every attempt brought to nothing i'd say you're on a good start because you can't go do for somebody what hasn't been done in your life already you can't be an influence if you aren't already under the influence you can't go out and and show people away if you're not already in it right you've got to have the experience before you can go out and try and be anything else to somebody else amen you got to have an experience to back up your confession you have to be what you're trying to get others to be amen so they know where you're going to take them amen listen we aren't all demon slain disease-healing people but the prophet god says every single one of us is supposed to be a lived voice that thunders out against satan that's something we can all do that's something we can all do right you don't have to have some great gift he says you just have to be a live voice he says that's what shakes the devil an untouchable life amen listen there's only one voice left the prophet's dead right prophet's gone there's only one voice left on this earth and that's the bride of christ that's it we're the last voice guess what what does the scripture say the bride says the spirit and the bride say one thing amen come come amen come it's an invitation isn't it remember when we read in the last search for paul or peter was talking about save yourself from this perverse generation this untowards generation that's what we're preaching save yourself from what's out there because you're not going to like it when you get to the end and see what it all turned into save yourself come with us there's a remedy get in the ark that's what we're saying right get out of it while you still can and guess what we are never to judge scripture says they judge themselves right prophet god said they judge themselves when they do what when they turn it down that tells you what's inside them i don't have to say if somebody's a believer not a believer when they turn the word down that shows what's inside of them at least for this moment at least for this moment because paul turned it down a lot of times before he took it didn't he so we leave that in god's hands amen but we're here to offer a part and we're here to offer grace while we're here prophet god says oh god if the world could only see that god and man are one what's the limiting factor it's not god living factor is not god the limiting factor is how much we'll let get poured out of us how much we'll die how much we're set ourselves aside how much we'll let him in and push out the rest of the stuff that's inside of us he says the super sign was that first man that god could come into and all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church he says a super sign god and man together that was to be the super side of the last day when the entire bible was to be fulfilled in the last days he's poured it into us so that we can fulfill the entire bible for this day amen that's an amazing thing when you think about it not to fulfill the entire bible but to fulfill the portion that's allotted to us now the prophet of god talks about this of course and christ the mystery of god revealed and i'm not going to go too deep in it but he wraps it up in just this one quote what he's talking about here he says now he's sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed that's the fulfillment of the entire word for this day he says now see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows has left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mysteries of the seven seals he says see he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then expressed himself through the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them amen it's the final expression of what the word the word was with god the word was god it's the final expression of god it's the final expression of the word is you and me that's why he poured himself into us he says see the threefold mystery now god manifested in christ christ manifested in the church and then he says all together to bring back the original adam and eve again men and women which are one made out of the same blood and the same spirit and everything else very familiar scripture revelation 10 7 says that the mystery of god should be finished complete finalized and the prophet of god points to you and he says you're the last piece he says you're the final mystery you're the final portion of the mystery of god remember when brother brahm says when the seals rope he says the bible became a new book and he says if you can't go back in your bible and see christ on every page read it again why because it was the revelation of god working all the way through through humanity through christ and now fully back into humanity again it was a mystery of god moving amongst us and he says in the end there's a perfection that comes alpha and omega same as it was on the day of pentecost it's the exact same thing right he says what he says christ the word is in the church and she becomes the word when the word goes through them the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's what he's saying it wasn't just christ it's you too the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so guess what bump the person next to you and say i'm the word and so are you that's what we're talking about amen now here's the thing can we recognize it in each other that's a little more difficult isn't it that's a lot more difficult i can see all the flaws on brother grant back there already no but what guess what we got two hundred thousand thousand demons pointing out the flaws in our brothers and sisters and we've got one spirit that's trying to pour the bomb of gilead on our eyes so we'll see him through the word right so what are you rubbing on your eyes these days right because what you're rubbing on your eyes is what you're going to see you know how they have glasses that they have uh you know they've got the 3d glasses that'll do all sorts of wonky things but if you put on red glasses and brother bam says if you look at red through red then it is what white and he says that's the way the blood works is when you look at a red mark which is which is a uh you know a dead ode he says you look at red dead ode through the red the blood of christ it shows white it's not even there right you can't even see it so you do this what you're looking through the eyes of the holy spirit you're looking through the film of the holy spirit and it'll show you the word in your brothers but if you get out under another influence right if you get away from the the sweetness of the holy spirit then what happens is that lifts up and you start looking through the lenses of something else and guess what you start to see you start to see the rough edges don't you the flaws and the failures and the hypocrisy because we're hypocrites every one of us none of us is perfect we say we believe and then often we do something different than what we say in reaction and motive and objective if not in anything else amen prophet has said what happened in the pre-figure now he says he opened adam's side and took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve he says the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on creeds she cannot stand on denomination she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it she was taken from christ see listen to this his church is himself revealed amen he says amen do you see it his church is himself revealed and expressed by the word itself that he is god what a phrase his church is himself revealed amen you go up and tell that to just about anybody today they put you right in the mental institution you go tell that to a denominational christian they'll say you're out of your mind but you've got to get out of your mind you've got to see yourself the way he sees you you got to believe the word that he's given us that tells us who and what we are even when we don't see it even when we get up and we look at ourselves in the mirror and say hoof or maybe your kids look at you and go maybe that happens a little more often right this church is himself revealed i think we're at the place where paul said we're still looking through the glass darkly we believe it i believe it i say i believe it i believe it with as much as i know how to believe it but i believe there's a further quickening that's coming to us amen i believe we've got a further place that we can go i believe there's a deeper way that we can go and like i said before i believe we see moments we see spots of light we we see things and and we say okay god i see you've got a handle on this i see you've made that change i see you've really nailed things down in my life and that's a beautiful thing that's a victory that's what we're talking about is when you get a victory and you say lord that's you and you can say that's the word that's the word living through me but then you go into the next trial and then you say oof and that's when you're looking for what the tinted glass to be taken away when the battle's over on that one and you can see the word built up again word upon word line upon line here a little there little right just building us up into the perfect stature that's all what are we doing we're learning to be patient to trust to wait that he's given the word and he can't return to him void and it's really that simple amen god said he's going to do it he'll do it that's where we rest amen almost done here he says all that christ was he poured into the church what is it anointed one to continue his work that his word might live constantly i've uh i've been delving into other denominations in the last couple weeks on youtube and and listening to what they preach and it's amazing what they'll get into at times and you sit there and you're just like it's as dead as dead can be and you feel horrible and you there's you're not left with any wonder why people are leaving churches in droves these days because there's no living life in that word that they're preaching it's dead it's rhetoric it's theology it's it's well structured much of it but it's dead and that's why people are leaving is because there's no life in it i believe some of them have life in them that's waiting to be quickened and they're waiting to come under the message and that's what's going to quicken them but they sit there and they say this does nothing for me it does nothing for me it makes it has no effect on me i'm just sitting here listening to well-reasoned arguments but that's it might as well go listen to jordan peterson better at it than all of us preachers when it comes to reasoned arguments probably but there's no life in it he says what is it anointed one to continue his work that his word might live constantly he lived by the word of the father and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of god and the church don't live by bread alone but by the word of christ and the holy spirit comes in and takes the word of christ and makes it a living action today he says these signs shall follow them that believe now the first time was in their life and then those signs followed after and so often what he's trying to do is get this life here sorted out so that those things can come afterwards amen sometimes we're looking for the signs and wonders and god's saying but your life is in shambles you're nowhere near as mature as you need to be and you're sitting there and you're seeking signs and wonders and dreams and gifts and healings and this and that and the other thing and he's saying but your life's not even sanctified what am i supposed to do with that because he pours it into a vessel that's not cleaned out then what does it do it taints the gifts doesn't it attains the experience it taints the message that you're giving out to people so often what he's trying to do is get us to do what clean out so that he can actually use us empty vessels is what he wants amen if he says that we're supposed to live by the word that proceeds from the mouth of god the question is is that what we're feeding on not just me preaching it's not just brother jail preaching amen we said it last time brother bam says two things to get close to god read your bible and pray right that allows god to speak to you outside of any man and guess what he does it way better than i can way better than brother gerald kent and he cuts through to the heart of the matter if you'll read in honesty and you'll read with an open heart you'll read something and you just say yes lord that's me because sometimes if i'm saying it you think well he knows or he sees or this or that the other thing brother jail says it well he's known me for 40 years or 30 years or 20 years and no no but when you sit there and you read and the holy spirit's dropped down says that's for you son that's for you daughter that's when you grow amen sometimes it's because you don't do that that he's got to get the minister to talk to you about it but if you let him deal with it it would be a whole lot easier that's my experience at least amen what you're eating is what's going to come out you can't get it you can't get health by eating sugar all day right so what i'm saying is your your walk with god can always be about the fun times the great services and this the other thing there's got to be the tough times too you got to eat your vegetables right guess what gospel vegetables are just as horrible as real life vegetables they're not fun but you still got to eat them right you can't get peace out of eating distrust right you can't get joy out of eating symptoms all day talking about what the problem talking about the problem no joy's gonna come out of talking about the problem is it talk about the promise matthew 15 as we start to close he says and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding do you not yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goethe into the belly and it's cast out into the draw but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies learn a lesson here you can't stop what's in you from coming out right you speak out of the truth of the heart and you speak by action not just by words so brother or what jesus is saying here is he says whatever's in your heart is going to come out he says in the heart is where evil thoughts adulteries fornications he says that's in you there's something in you wanting that it's not that you get an opportunity it's that you want the opportunity and you recognize it when it comes right that's why the scripture says no man can say i'm tempted of god but he says what you're what led aside by your own lusts there's something in your heart that wanted it and then when the opportunity came you said i'm gonna take it god didn't give you a desire you had something inside of you wanting it and then you took advantage of it when you could he says these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashing hands defileth not a man last quote that's the thing god will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him stay on the word and believe it that's not difficult if you'll only obey him stay on the word and believe it and he will place into the church before the coming of christ all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he pours into the church god wanting his work done he sent it into his son the son wanting the work done sent it into his church at that day you'll know i'm in the father the father in me and i in you and you and me at that day because the same power of god was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ he says the same power that rested in jesus christ rests in the placed sons in the body of christ place sons this isn't for rookies this isn't for newbies this isn't people that just come out of the water like we read last time he says you're not born men you're born babes and you mature into men amen these are people that have gone through the process that have willfully submitted themselves to the chastening and changing hand of god to draw them to a place where they can be placed sons adopted sons and daughters of god where they're in a place now where he says i trust you and i'm giving you my authority i'm giving you the checkbook start writing it out in my will and whatever you ask that's what i'll do why because he knows you're going to do exactly what he told you to because what you've been found obedient to god faithful to his word and willing to act on it when he tells you to act on it amen there's a time of training and then there's a time of placing and then there's a time of work that's what we're going to go to next time amen god bless you stan if you would we don't get to skip any parts like i said we don't come out of the water get the baptism of the holy ghost and run around start doing a bunch of things for god he's going to have to train you remember when we're done he says you're perfect spotless the image of god the form of god in this last age amen amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord so often we see so little lord and we have a wonderful message lord we have an open book laying before us and lord i believe that it's not you that's holding back so many times lord it's us that's holding you back and lord if we'd only look deeper lord if we'd spend a little more time to give you an opportunity to open things up to us lord i believe we'd be a little further ahead maybe than we are tonight but lord i'm asking your grace for us lord we read last service lord that there you said there's a day when we would call on you and you would answer lord that we get to a place where our every desire our every moment was going to be spent calling on you because that's what mattered most to us heavenly father lord i pray you put a desperation in our hearts lord that you put souls on our minds lord that you'd put a burden there for changes in our own lives lord in our own families even in this church lord god lord that your holy spirit would just have such a freedom to move and reign in our hearts lord to do the perfect will of the father that's been called out in this age by a message lord we pray you lift us up lord separate us from the things of the world lord shake these things off of us that ought not to be there lord lord let us consecrate ourselves anew to you lord that you can fill us up again lord your prophet said there are there's one filling lord but many refillings and lord may you just fill our hearts again this evening lord and through the coming days and weeks lord as the battles come and go lord we pray that you would just reign in our hearts lord that we be looking for more and more of you lord that be we we'd be willing to die out to ourselves more and more each and every day we pray lord we know there's many need you lord not in this church even necessarily lord but many lord souls that are out there lord we pray that you bring them to the fold heavenly father lord that you'd finish this great work that you've started lord and that your holy spirit would just have free reign amongst us for granted now we pray in jesus christ's name we ask it amen praise the lord amen

i uh i was telling brenda and the kids just yesterday that uh well as i was out berry picking i was alone and in prayer and trying to out pick the girls and while i was there i got thinking about god and i just started hearing that that still small voice and and all it what he was telling me to do was keep on the path there was a past there was three there was three paths around me and and i was looking at one path and i was picking a few berries and just praying and and it kept coming back to me keep on the path and as i kept down the path i got lots of berries it might sound real simple but this is how he was working with me and and at one point i got off the path because i saw i saw a nice round big berry and i and i saw i saw it there so i got off the path and i went after my hips in a hole and the voice said stay on the path and i got back on the path and i started moving on that same path and i'd say which way would i go there's two or three paths and it said just stay on this path and i stayed on that path and i outpicked the girls ask matt he'll tell you but the point the point is and you know you take that further that doesn't apply only to berry picking you know it's it's our lives you know we god has given us a path to walker and he wants us to stay on that path and not deviate that the devil will try and deviate us but there's something that keeps holding us to that path right we're just saying about it and we're going to sing about it now following jesus stay on that path right but it was a real lesson i was really blessed with it was just me and him it was wonderful just in that simplicity stay on that path when you get off you'll fall into a hole and into a ditch and the devil has got you right so you shake loose and you get back out you say sorry lord i didn't do what you told me to do i'll follow your path and then he'll he walks with you he'll just walk with you he'll hold your hand just let him do it that's how i would encourage everybody stay on the path praise the lord i'm following jesus [Music] divine [Music] praise the lord [Applause] praise the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] my fears [Music] praise the lord [Music] [Music] my spirit
