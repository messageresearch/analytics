[43:35] Christ's name amen amen turn if you

[43:43] you're able to to repair it for me amen
[43:46] God bless you it's good to be back uh my
[43:49] wife said you are definitely not a
[43:51] missionary you definitely don't like to
[43:53] travel because every time I come back
[43:55] I'm tired and I'm not feeling good and
[43:57] this and that the other thing and I just
[43:58] like to be at home with Home Folks amen
[44:01] so I'm I'm glad to be back but I did
[44:03] have a good trip in Nova Scotia in PEI I
[44:05] met with Brother Edmund Hagman and his
[44:07] wife sister Leah in PEI spent a couple
[44:09] hours with them on Thursday night had a
[44:12] wonderful time with them and Lord
[44:13] willing she'll be here um she's related
[44:15] to brother Carr and she's coming up with
[44:17] five other people including brother Carr
[44:19] for our special dedication meeting so
[44:21] we'll see her and he's hoping to come up
[44:23] as well for at least a couple Services
[44:25] they've got a farm there, Acres 130
[44:28] sheep they just had 140 Lambs born in
[44:30] the last month or so so they've got a
[44:32] lot going on there but uh he's hoping to
[44:34] come in at least for a couple services
[44:36] so uh that would be very good but I
[44:38] certainly appreciate brother Paul taking
[44:40] the service on Wednesday night ien it's
[44:43] good to have somebody that can just step
[44:44] in like that and certainly appreciate it
[44:47] amen and then it's good to see brother
[44:48] Isaac and sister kzia here now we've
[44:51] seen brother Isaac of course last year
[44:52] sister kzzie I've seen her but most of
[44:54] you haven't um so it's good to have her
[44:56] there and you know I was thinking as
[44:57] they were singing the specials there's
[44:59] something about these Walsh leer people
[45:02] you know they come in and what do they
[45:03] do they put their shoulder to the wheel
[45:06] amen we've had uh the different ones
[45:07] come in brother of course we know that
[45:09] brother Dale has come in and done that
[45:11] very Faithfully but then his brothers
[45:13] come in and the sis their wives come in
[45:15] and they're singing and they're
[45:16] worshiping and then now you got the
[45:17] grandkids coming in and they're doing
[45:19] the same thing anden it's a good thing
[45:21] to see the spirit of God moving in in
[45:23] them amen that's a it's a wonderful
[45:24] thing so God bless you this morning for
[45:26] your special and playing in these
[45:28] different things amen want to remember s
[45:30] brother Bob sister Brenda as they head
[45:32] out for two and a half weeks to Ontario
[45:34] that they'll get a blessing and they'll
[45:35] be a blessing amen God go with you each
[45:37] one it was a good trip as I said and I
[45:40] had a few witnessing opportunities but
[45:42] you know we know this but sometimes it
[45:44] becomes abundantly clear what we believe
[45:46] is not for everyone it's not for
[45:48] everyone but what I have learned is that
[45:50] we can still help people along the way
[45:52] and that's usually what I find it turns
[45:54] out to be is you're just trying to help
[45:55] somebody to see a little principle
[45:57] a little thing that can just change a
[45:59] direction change a situation and if only
[46:01] they take that their life will at least
[46:02] be a little easier and maybe that will
[46:04] lead to something else where the next
[46:06] time something comes up they come ask
[46:08] you and say hey what would you do here
[46:09] what do you believe about this or how
[46:11] would you approach this and all of a
[46:13] sudden maybe there's an opportunity it's
[46:14] a it's a long game many times it's not
[46:17] always about just somebody's going to
[46:18] come to the Lord but sometimes it's that
[46:20] continuous witness that we give in our
[46:22] day-to-day lives even at work and these
[46:24] things that bring people in but uh it
[46:26] was is good and and uh I'm trusting the
[46:29] Lord to keep using me in those areas
[46:31] amen God bless you John 14:12 this is
[46:34] our scripture and we're going to be
[46:35] using it regularly in the coming
[46:37] services and Jesus says verily verily I
[46:39] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[46:42] works that I do shall he do also and
[46:45] Greater Works than these shall he do
[46:47] because I go unto my father and
[46:49] whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that
[46:51] will I do that the father may be
[46:53] glorified in the son amen God bless you
[46:56] you can have your seats this morning and
[46:57] we're continuing and and this idea of
[47:00] authority by position and and I want to
[47:03] take a third series or third day on this
[47:06] but I just want to point out something
[47:07] before we get into our thought this
[47:08] morning because we often quote this
[47:10] scripture in Hebrews 138 and Jesus as we
[47:13] opened in John 14 says you're going to
[47:15] continue the works that I do but
[47:17] remember brother Brandon would say my
[47:19] message is is to declare him that he's
[47:21] here and so often we read Hebrews 138
[47:24] where it says Jesus Christ the same
[47:25] yesterday today and forever and what we
[47:28] usually do is we go back 2,000 years and
[47:30] we say that was Jesus Christ yesterday
[47:33] and then we come to today and we say
[47:34] he's here today and he's going to be
[47:35] there tomorrow and he's going to be
[47:37] there working tomorrow but but the thing
[47:38] we know is that Jesus Christ did not
[47:40] start 2,000 years ago amen he did not
[47:42] begin 2,000 years ago the scripture says
[47:44] all things were created by Jesus Christ
[47:47] amen so he's been working all along and
[47:49] so what we have to see is not just Jesus
[47:51] Christ from 2,000 years ago but we have
[47:53] to see Jesus Christ from the very
[47:55] beginning because the works of Christ
[47:57] have been doing been been done all along
[47:59] through these times and I was reading in
[48:01] my devotions the other morning where
[48:03] God's talking to Moses and he comes to
[48:04] Moses and he says Moses I haven't even
[48:06] been known by my name Jehovah prior to
[48:10] now now we see Abraham would call him
[48:12] Jehovah Gyra but but but he says I'm not
[48:14] even known to a people by my own name he
[48:18] says until then I haven't been there he
[48:20] says and I'm coming down to be made made
[48:22] known to my people and I've heard their
[48:24] cries and I've I've come down to take
[48:26] out of their slavery but how was God
[48:29] revealed to the people of
[48:31] Israel it was first by Moses they never
[48:35] saw a pillar of fire they never saw a
[48:37] pillar of cloud they didn't see
[48:38] lightning in the sky they didn't see
[48:40] anything what did God do God sent them a
[48:43] promise by a prophet and God revealed
[48:46] himself through Moses and the scripture
[48:48] even says that God said I will make you
[48:51] a god unto the people and Aaron will be
[48:53] your Prophet the revealing of Jehovah
[48:56] was through a Prophet first and foremost
[48:58] and it's not until they leave Egypt that
[49:00] they actually get to see Jehovah in a
[49:02] form aside from a man and it is through
[49:05] the pillar of fire and it's through the
[49:06] pillar of cloud and these different
[49:07] things but the first revealing of God to
[49:10] his people was through a prophet that's
[49:12] how God works on these sort of things
[49:13] and Moses himself would then prophesy
[49:16] the coming Messiah and he would say this
[49:18] he says the Lord thy God will raise up
[49:19] unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[49:22] thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto
[49:25] him shall you hearken here hear ye him
[49:27] is what we heard on Mount
[49:28] Transfiguration amen but notice he says
[49:30] God's going to raise up a prophet he's
[49:32] going to bring a messiah like me what a
[49:35] thing to say God's going to bring you a
[49:37] messiah and he's going to be just like
[49:38] me but why was Moses saying that because
[49:41] Moses was revealing Christ to the people
[49:44] and what was it was Christ was coming
[49:46] now to reveal God to the people it was
[49:48] the revealing of God to the man to the
[49:51] to the to the masses so to speak and so
[49:53] Moses revealed God to the people now
[49:55] Christ comes and he reveals God to the
[49:57] people the same way but what was the
[49:59] thing with the Messiah he was going to
[50:00] come and he'd be Moses perfected that's
[50:03] the difference he'd be Moses without the
[50:04] temper he'd be Moses without the faults
[50:06] he'd be Moses without the failures he'd
[50:08] be Moses without the wondering what do I
[50:10] do here now but it would be a Perfection
[50:12] of Moses amen he'd be Moses he'd be the
[50:15] god Prophet that was ordained to come so
[50:17] the revealing of God was first through
[50:20] that prophet and why am I making that
[50:22] point because brother brandham comes in
[50:24] this age and what does he do he reveals
[50:26] Christ to us
[50:27] and he does the exact same works of
[50:29] Christ the same things he raised the
[50:31] dead he healed the sick he cast out
[50:32] demons he prophesied he spoke things
[50:35] into existence all of those things were
[50:37] done and what was it do it was revealing
[50:41] God to the people it was not God but it
[50:44] was revealing God to the people but
[50:48] remember Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ
[50:50] the same yesterday today and forever
[50:54] what happened is when the prophet left
[50:55] did God leave
[50:57] no when the prophet left did the word
[50:59] stop no what follows the the prophet is
[51:02] what God himself revealing himself to
[51:05] the people God himself stepping down
[51:07] into the people God himself talking to
[51:09] the people God is revealing himself even
[51:12] not just to the people but through the
[51:14] people so it's a continuation of The
[51:16] Works through all of these things amen
[51:19] it's a SE second Exodus that's happening
[51:21] now brother BR would talk about a second
[51:23] Exodus and what is it it's a people
[51:25] that's been called out and set aside to
[51:27] be special unto God and it's called the
[51:29] bride and so the problem today is and I
[51:32] I heard a bit about this in pi is and
[51:34] and of course we know about this is we
[51:36] got people that think that message is
[51:38] still on the tapes and the problem is
[51:40] that message has to come into people
[51:43] that's the way it's got to go you can't
[51:44] say let's stick to the tapes the tapes
[51:46] have to become reality in your life and
[51:48] that's what God's trying to do is he
[51:49] gives us a message and then he comes
[51:51] down and he fulfills the message in the
[51:53] people the message is there to do
[51:55] something amen amen we notice that that
[51:59] Paul the prophet to the age he never
[52:01] forbade Peter and John from preaching or
[52:02] any of the other Apostles but yet that's
[52:04] what we would have we'll say oh oh you
[52:06] can only play the tapes well that's
[52:09] anti-rip there's always a following
[52:11] after Elijah didn't forbid Elisha to
[52:14] preach the start doesn't stop the Finish
[52:16] amen it's a continuation of the works of
[52:19] God that are going through and so Christ
[52:21] gave the commission to preach and he
[52:22] never stopped it he never said only Paul
[52:25] gets to preach' only read Paul's letters
[52:27] in the church no you have to preach
[52:29] according to Paul's letters but you
[52:31] don't have to just read Paul's letters
[52:32] in your church others wrote the books
[52:34] the Holy Spirit dealt with men according
[52:36] to the needs of the local body and so
[52:38] that's what we see in all of these
[52:40] things there's always a continuation of
[52:42] the works of Christ it does not stop
[52:43] with a man just because God used that
[52:45] man but it continually moves forward in
[52:47] these things now we spent last service
[52:49] and talked about Moses quite a bit and I
[52:52] I I kind of hate to do it this way but
[52:54] we're going to close out with a warning
[52:55] on Moses because we see that Moses
[52:57] failure uh at the very end of his life
[53:00] there but we know that Moses was the
[53:01] meekest man on the earth now we know
[53:03] what Meek means it means to have the
[53:05] power to do something but to choose not
[53:07] to do it you can but you don't amen and
[53:10] we see that Moses time and time again
[53:12] the people would backslide the people
[53:14] would Rebel the people would get whiny
[53:16] and they'd want to kill them theyd want
[53:17] to go back to Egypt they want to do all
[53:19] these things and time and time again
[53:22] Moses would stand in the Gap he just
[53:24] never seemed to be bothered he just he
[53:27] every time they did it he he just he'd
[53:29] go to God and he' plead for them and he
[53:31] had patience church if Moses can have
[53:33] that much patience with his people then
[53:35] how much more does God have patience
[53:36] with his people because Moses was
[53:38] revealing Christ amen and that's the
[53:41] patience of God that's coming through
[53:43] him but Moses never seemed to lose it
[53:45] but I want to ask you this morning why
[53:47] was God so longsuffering with Israel why
[53:49] didn't God just wiped them off and start
[53:51] a new because God had given them a word
[53:54] God had given them a promise God was not
[53:56] committed to the people God was
[53:58] committed to the word that he gave the
[53:59] people and he says I need a people to
[54:01] fulfill my word and therefore I'm going
[54:03] to take this people in they're my chosen
[54:05] people they're the ones that they've got
[54:07] that that's got to have it that's the
[54:09] patience of God church is that he has
[54:11] committed himself to his word amen and
[54:13] as long as there's a people to accept it
[54:15] then that's what's going to happen amen
[54:17] but I want you to see what happens we're
[54:18] going to talk about Moses failure
[54:20] because we're speaking on Authority by
[54:22] position this morning and we want to see
[54:24] where Moses fails in his authority as a
[54:26] lesson to ourselves it says this in
[54:28] numbers 20 for there was no water for
[54:30] the congregation and they gathered
[54:32] themselves together against Moses and
[54:34] against Aaron and the people ched with
[54:36] Moses and spake saying would God that we
[54:39] had died when our Brethren died before
[54:41] the Lord Lord as soon as things got
[54:43] tough people started complaining and
[54:45] this is the nature of a faithless
[54:47] generation is unless things are perfect
[54:50] they're always complaining they can't
[54:52] stand the trial brother Brandon would
[54:54] call them hot house plants everything
[54:56] has to be perfect they can't be out in
[54:58] the storms they can't be out in the
[54:59] regular weather they can't have the ups
[55:01] and downs they've always got to have
[55:03] everything perfect that's not mature
[55:05] Sons and Daughters of God he says and
[55:07] why they said and why have you brought
[55:09] up the congregation of the Lord into
[55:11] this Wilderness that we and our cattle
[55:12] should die here they neglected to
[55:14] remember the pillar of fire and Cloud
[55:16] that led and held them every single time
[55:19] church we think the signs and wonders
[55:21] will hold us it has never held anybody
[55:23] the signs and wonders have never held
[55:25] anybody in scripture it's got to be
[55:27] something on the inside that connects
[55:29] you to the word that holds you the signs
[55:31] and wonders won't do it we see it time
[55:33] and time again in scripture he said and
[55:35] wherefore have you made us to come out
[55:37] out of Egypt to bring us into this evil
[55:39] place it is no place of seed or of figs
[55:42] or of vines or pomegranates neither is
[55:44] there any water to drink that's the
[55:46] promised land they're saying this isn't
[55:48] the promised land well yeah because
[55:51] you're walking to get there you want the
[55:53] blessings but you don't want to go in
[55:55] they backed away from those blessings if
[55:57] you remember and now they're complaining
[55:59] that they don't have the blessings they
[56:00] don't have them because they chose not
[56:02] to go in they chose not to take God at
[56:03] his word but yet how many times has God
[56:06] provided for them they have never gone
[56:08] without truly gone without they've had
[56:10] trials they've had stresses yes but God
[56:13] has always provided amen they forgot
[56:15] that if God leads you God provides you
[56:18] that's the simple thing church if you
[56:19] are in God's will then God will provide
[56:21] for your need this morning it's that
[56:23] simple if we can just hold that if we
[56:25] can find his will he'll he'll he'll Feed
[56:27] Us he'll provide for us it says and
[56:29] Moses and Aaron went from the presence
[56:31] of the assembly under the door of the
[56:33] Tabernacle of the congregation and they
[56:35] fell upon their faces and the glory of
[56:37] the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord
[56:39] spake unto Moses saying take the rod and
[56:42] gather thou the assembly together thou
[56:44] and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto
[56:47] the rock before their eyes and it shall
[56:49] give forth his water and thou shalt
[56:51] bring forth to them water out of the
[56:53] rock so Thou shalt give the congregation
[56:55] and the there be strength God makes it
[56:57] very clear speak to the Rock that's all
[57:00] you have to do now watch this and Moses
[57:04] took the rod from before the Lord as he
[57:07] had commanded him and Moses and Aaron
[57:10] gathered the congregation together
[57:11] before the Rock and he said unto them
[57:14] here now ye Rebels must we fetch you
[57:17] water out of this rock you know I always
[57:19] wondered why Moses differed so greatly
[57:22] from what God told him to
[57:24] do he's about to do something that's
[57:26] completely different than what God told
[57:28] him and I often wondered why that was
[57:30] and we'll see why shortly it says and
[57:32] Moses lifted up his hand and with his
[57:35] Rock he smote The Rock twice and the
[57:38] water came out abundantly and the
[57:39] congregation drank and their beasts also
[57:42] I also wondered why God listened to his
[57:46] Prophet we'll see that as well he says
[57:49] and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron
[57:51] because you believe me not to sanctify
[57:54] me in the eyes of the children of Israel
[57:56] therefore ye shall not bring this
[57:58] congregation into the land which I have
[58:01] given them what do we see here church we
[58:03] see what happens when anointing combines
[58:04] with
[58:05] temper amen when anointing departs from
[58:08] commission and temper takes over and
[58:11] what happened here is Moses got angry
[58:13] for the first
[58:14] time for the first time Moses got caught
[58:17] up in himself and he got angry with the
[58:19] people and he turned into a me monster
[58:22] must I you know who started with the
[58:25] eyes
[58:26] Lucifer must I do this must I do that
[58:29] and he starts to chastise the people for
[58:32] their attitude for their approach God
[58:35] didn't but Moses steps in and he starts
[58:37] to take authority to himself amen we see
[58:40] that when Authority is removed from
[58:41] commission we get results but it's not
[58:43] always good results you can get results
[58:46] what's good good means in God's will
[58:48] good doesn't mean it always feels good
[58:51] amen we discipline our children for
[58:52] their good does it feel good no but we
[58:55] do it for their good Romans 8:28 says
[58:58] all things work together for good that's
[59:00] what God's good is is it works together
[59:03] for good it might not seem good in and
[59:04] of itself when you get a spanking when
[59:06] God withholds something from you but
[59:08] it's for your good in the end and we're
[59:10] going to see what even what the prophet
[59:11] would say about some of these things but
[59:13] listen to what he says he says look God
[59:15] told Moses you go down there this
[59:18] anointed Prophet The anointing makes all
[59:21] the difference he says Moses went down
[59:24] there in his he says go down speak to
[59:27] that rock Moses went down there in his
[59:29] anger why is Moses angry he's got the
[59:33] answer to the
[59:34] people Moses is frustrated because of
[59:36] how they treated him Moses has injected
[59:40] his pride into the situation how dare
[59:43] they talk to me like this how many times
[59:46] have we proven ourselves how many times
[59:47] has God proven and they treat me like
[59:49] this and he goes down in his anger he
[59:53] picked up the rod and said you rebels
[59:54] must we fetch you water out of this rock
[59:57] and he smot the rock the water didn't
[59:59] come he smoted it again it came it was
[1:00:02] against God's will it broke every plan
[1:00:04] in the Bible he said Christ had to be
[1:00:06] smitten a second time see Christ was s
[1:00:09] smitten once he says Moses did it twice
[1:00:11] but Christ was only supposed to be
[1:00:12] smitten once it broke every it says it
[1:00:15] broke the whole plan he says but he gave
[1:00:18] him his permissive will then after that
[1:00:21] he said see we got the water for you
[1:00:23] yeah I brought it out for you you bunch
[1:00:25] of rebels what is it me me me I did this
[1:00:29] God said come over here Moses come here
[1:00:31] come up here on top you've been a
[1:00:33] faithful servant Look Over Yonder see
[1:00:36] the promised land oh Lord but you're not
[1:00:38] going over you took my permissive will
[1:00:41] down there at the Rock you've glorified
[1:00:43] yourself see and not me you Sanctified
[1:00:46] yourself you didn't sanctify me you
[1:00:48] didn't keep my original word what I told
[1:00:50] you to do yes the waters did come you
[1:00:53] can lay hands on the sick and they
[1:00:55] recover you can prophesy or speak with
[1:00:58] tongues he says but the thing is keep
[1:01:01] his original word he says God don't
[1:01:04] change his mind friend you've got to
[1:01:06] keep his commission his will now brother
[1:01:09] R would start to talk about something
[1:01:11] and for the sake of time this morning
[1:01:12] I'm going to summarize it but he says a
[1:01:14] man wrote me and he said brother Oral
[1:01:16] Roberts prays for 500 people in the time
[1:01:19] it takes you to pray for to he says
[1:01:21] you're the slowest man I know
[1:01:26] and brother bam wrote him back and he
[1:01:27] says God gave brother or Roberts a way
[1:01:29] to pray for the sick and God gave me a
[1:01:32] way to pray for the sick he's got his
[1:01:34] way I've got my way he prays in general
[1:01:38] he says I pray specifically it's a
[1:01:40] completely different way of looking at
[1:01:42] it and he said I wait for God to show
[1:01:44] what's done but I want you to see
[1:01:45] something here he says you know God uses
[1:01:48] sickness for whips to bring us to
[1:01:52] him God uses sickness for whips to bring
[1:01:55] us to him you believe that sure it is he
[1:01:57] says look at Job the chastening of the
[1:01:59] Lord but he says now you have to notice
[1:02:02] prophetic gifts can get yourself in
[1:02:04] trouble certainly can if you'll give me
[1:02:07] some Indulgence this morning let me add
[1:02:08] to it spiritual gifts can get you in
[1:02:12] trouble spiritual gifts can get you in
[1:02:15] trouble watch him prove it now he says
[1:02:17] now what if this man he's talking about
[1:02:18] something some man that's come up to be
[1:02:20] prayed for now what if this man had done
[1:02:22] something evil and I'm standing there
[1:02:24] great big what we call in America a
[1:02:26] bulldog faith and I grab a hold of him
[1:02:28] and I say hallelujah hallelujah Satan
[1:02:30] turn him loose glory to God and I take
[1:02:32] that disease off of him and God put it
[1:02:35] on him for a purpose I'm in trouble with
[1:02:38] God see he says God will heed your
[1:02:40] prayer but now you've got to answer for
[1:02:42] it because you've gone against his will
[1:02:45] cuz God's trying to build up the faith
[1:02:46] of the people and then when you fail
[1:02:48] he'll allow it to go through but you've
[1:02:50] got to come and pay a price for that now
[1:02:53] we're speaking about adoption and
[1:02:54] Authority by position and he's warning
[1:02:56] us what just because you can doesn't
[1:03:00] mean you should just because you can
[1:03:03] doesn't mean you should church can I
[1:03:04] talk about meekness here for a second
[1:03:06] because we said earlier meekness says
[1:03:08] you have power to do something but you
[1:03:09] chose not to do it why was Moses the
[1:03:12] meekest man on the earth because Moses
[1:03:15] had the power to speak and God would do
[1:03:18] it Moses could have brought judgment
[1:03:20] Moses could have brought destruction
[1:03:22] Moses could have taken his own enemies
[1:03:24] off the planet
[1:03:26] Moses had Authority before God to
[1:03:29] speak but the meekness of Moses was that
[1:03:32] he didn't let his personal pride get
[1:03:35] caught up and use his authority against
[1:03:37] people he held back that's what made him
[1:03:40] Meek was he had spoken word authority
[1:03:42] and he didn't use it except by God's
[1:03:43] Express command that was why he was the
[1:03:46] meekest man his character was in tune
[1:03:48] with God's will and his flesh was
[1:03:52] subject to God's Will and it brought
[1:03:54] everything else in line what is it
[1:03:55] adopted children in position have
[1:03:58] authority but we have to use that
[1:03:59] Authority according to our commission
[1:04:01] according to God's purpose according to
[1:04:04] God's will amen that's what's going to
[1:04:05] fulfill the word of God because
[1:04:07] otherwise what happens is we start to
[1:04:09] speak things into existence we start to
[1:04:11] speak into situations and we come into a
[1:04:13] place of spiritual Prosperity Gospel
[1:04:15] where we get everything we want that's
[1:04:18] not what God's here to do he's not here
[1:04:20] to give us everything we want he's here
[1:04:22] to help us fulfill the word for our day
[1:04:24] that's the purpose of these things
[1:04:26] amen so brother Braham continues he says
[1:04:28] you see what I mean he says now maybe
[1:04:30] you don't get it wait let me give you
[1:04:32] some scripture I know you won't doubt
[1:04:33] the scripture here let's take Moses how
[1:04:35] many believe Moses was a prophet a great
[1:04:38] prophet God told Moses go down there and
[1:04:40] speak to the Rock and Moses went down
[1:04:42] there and did what God told him not to
[1:04:44] do he smoted The Rock now catch this he
[1:04:47] but he smoted it and the waters didn't
[1:04:50] come and he smoted it again notice he SM
[1:04:53] he hits it the first time and God does
[1:04:55] not give him water why because God
[1:04:58] didn't tell him to do it God was giving
[1:05:01] Moses a warning you're out of my
[1:05:04] will Moses could have backed away and
[1:05:07] said folks I'm sorry this is not what he
[1:05:10] told me to do he told me to speak to the
[1:05:12] Rock and he could have backed away made
[1:05:14] it right and spoken to the Rock God's
[1:05:16] giving him an opportunity to correct his
[1:05:18] error but Moses persisted in his anger
[1:05:23] it's got to be my way and he hits the
[1:05:24] rock the second time time it says he had
[1:05:27] power to do it he was a prophet and the
[1:05:30] waters came forth that's right but what
[1:05:32] did God do God said come up here Moses
[1:05:35] said do you see the land Yonder you're
[1:05:37] not going in you didn't obey me down
[1:05:38] there at The Rock he had the power to do
[1:05:41] it but he had better watch the way he
[1:05:43] used that power what this is where true
[1:05:46] character is
[1:05:47] proven he says look at Elisha he was
[1:05:49] baldheaded and he was coming down the
[1:05:51] road and some little children began to
[1:05:53] say oh Baldhead old Baldhead why don't
[1:05:55] you go up like Elijah did making fun of
[1:05:57] them he says now that was all right them
[1:05:59] little kids maybe it was their parents
[1:06:01] that taught them to do that they were
[1:06:03] little fellows let me stop
[1:06:05] here he's saying little kids are going
[1:06:07] to be little kids church immature
[1:06:10] Believers are going to be immature
[1:06:12] Believers we're going to deal with
[1:06:15] people that are not at the same level we
[1:06:17] are and in this church we have a whole
[1:06:19] different range of maturities and guess
[1:06:22] what just because I'm your age and
[1:06:24] you're my age does not mean I'm as as
[1:06:25] mature as you or you're as mature as me
[1:06:27] and What's happen is we run into little
[1:06:29] kid issues amen come on let's be honest
[1:06:33] we run into little kid issues and what
[1:06:35] do we do we say they ought to be better
[1:06:37] than that they ought to know they do
[1:06:39] know better than that and what do we do
[1:06:41] we go straight to
[1:06:47] judgment we go straight to saying they
[1:06:50] ought to do this they ought to do that
[1:06:52] how come they're not this how come
[1:06:53] they're not that they're little kids in
[1:06:56] that area give them some Grace give them
[1:06:59] some Grace amen we're going to talk
[1:07:01] about that a little bit but notice how
[1:07:03] he says it was their parents that taught
[1:07:04] them sometimes we learn things from our
[1:07:06] parents sometimes we learn things from
[1:07:07] our spiritual parents hey we've got all
[1:07:10] sorts of little isms around this message
[1:07:12] and guess what we have little isms in
[1:07:13] this church and we don't realize it
[1:07:14] sometimes amen we've got little things
[1:07:16] we do by habit or by tradition and we
[1:07:19] make them into idols and when people
[1:07:22] don't do it the way we used to do it or
[1:07:23] the way we ought to do it or we think
[1:07:25] they ought to do it do it then what do
[1:07:26] we do we put them into a different
[1:07:27] category no no no let's give Grace amen
[1:07:30] let's give some understanding but he
[1:07:32] says what they were making fun of this
[1:07:34] Prophet but they got him angry and he
[1:07:37] turned around and put a curse on those
[1:07:39] children in the name of the Lord and two
[1:07:41] she bears come out of the woods and
[1:07:42] killed 42 little innocent
[1:07:46] children kids do things all the time
[1:07:49] that they ought not to do and he says
[1:07:50] they're innocent they didn't know any
[1:07:53] better he says now that doesn't sound
[1:07:55] like the nature of the Holy Spirit does
[1:07:57] it no kill them little children see but
[1:08:00] an angered Prophet see he cursed them
[1:08:02] children had to be recognized because he
[1:08:05] was a prophet he says see so you have to
[1:08:08] watch oh it's all about the ministry
[1:08:10] it's all no no no he says you have to
[1:08:12] watch why because you've got Authority
[1:08:14] in your position church that God will
[1:08:17] back up and you've got to be so careful
[1:08:19] when you step into there and we see here
[1:08:21] that temper is one of the greatest tools
[1:08:23] that Satan will use to get us to try and
[1:08:25] ab use the authority that God has placed
[1:08:26] in the believer's life we see it in
[1:08:29] Moses we see it in Elisha here we see it
[1:08:31] in David and it never has good response
[1:08:34] or good results temper is purely an
[1:08:36] emotional response there is anger and
[1:08:40] then there is temper they are not the
[1:08:41] same thing see temper is tied to self
[1:08:44] and you know how this manifests in most
[1:08:46] Believers righteous indignation but it's
[1:08:49] righteous indignation because how dare
[1:08:51] they do
[1:08:52] it how dare they say that to me how dare
[1:08:54] they treat me that way way or maybe we
[1:08:56] get even worse sometimes it's for
[1:08:57] somebody else how dare they treat
[1:08:59] somebody else that way and we flare up
[1:09:02] and what is it it can turn into a pride
[1:09:04] issue rather than a word issue and we
[1:09:07] see here with Elijah his Elisha his
[1:09:10] pride got worked on they started making
[1:09:12] fun of him they started challenging his
[1:09:14] commission they started challenging his
[1:09:16] experience Church the as soon as
[1:09:19] Elijah's taken up he takes the the robe
[1:09:21] and he smites the water and it Parts in
[1:09:23] front of him the double portion of the
[1:09:25] anointing of God is on him why is he
[1:09:27] worried about what children say just a
[1:09:30] distraction but Satan comes in and he
[1:09:32] gets him worked up over his his little
[1:09:34] bit of Pride that he had left and those
[1:09:36] 42 children died anden we got to be able
[1:09:39] to absorb these things Church we've got
[1:09:41] to be able to take it and either move on
[1:09:44] or react in love and mercy and Grace
[1:09:48] remember what Paul says in Timothy he
[1:09:49] says the servant of the Lord must not
[1:09:53] strive must not go back back and forth
[1:09:56] must not get the last word
[1:10:00] ouch must not get the last word I spent
[1:10:02] a bunch of time with somebody this
[1:10:04] weekend that had to have the last word
[1:10:05] on everything do you know how hard that
[1:10:07] is to somebody that likes to have the
[1:10:09] last word God was working on me what for
[1:10:13] that person's sake let him have the last
[1:10:15] word let him be what he wants to be just
[1:10:18] so you can try and do something for his
[1:10:20] life he says must not strive but be
[1:10:23] gentle unto all men as AP to teach
[1:10:26] patient he says in
[1:10:29] meekness instructing those that oppose
[1:10:31] themselves remember we could get angry
[1:10:34] we could use our knowledge of the word
[1:10:36] to destroy them we could use what we
[1:10:38] know to beat them down but we don't
[1:10:42] because it's not about beating them down
[1:10:44] it's not about winning it's not about
[1:10:47] winning it's about a soul that is all
[1:10:50] this is about church this entire gospel
[1:10:53] comes down to souls that's the the only
[1:10:55] thing that matters brother Bram said a
[1:10:58] soul is worth 10,000 worlds so why would
[1:11:01] we take the world or our position or our
[1:11:03] influence in the world and give it up
[1:11:05] for the sake of somebody's
[1:11:07] soul that response that we have we can
[1:11:11] respond we can react we can instruct in
[1:11:13] love or we can walk away we can walk
[1:11:17] away we don't always have to engage
[1:11:18] we're allowed to walk away but whatever
[1:11:20] we do we can't flare up that's the
[1:11:23] satanic side coming out he says why do
[1:11:25] we do it if God per Adventure will give
[1:11:28] them repentance to the acknowledging of
[1:11:30] the truth that by the things that we say
[1:11:32] that their eyes might be opened that
[1:11:34] they could make their life right the
[1:11:37] only opportunity they may have is the
[1:11:39] way we
[1:11:40] respond we're talking about adoption it
[1:11:42] doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun
[1:11:44] does it because now we're expected to
[1:11:47] act like
[1:11:48] Christ completely now we fail and we'll
[1:11:52] get into that a little bit later and we
[1:11:54] see it even in Moses here here but he
[1:11:55] says what that they will give them
[1:11:57] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[1:11:58] truth and that they may recover
[1:12:00] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[1:12:02] who are taken captive by him at his will
[1:12:05] I had some conversations and I I've been
[1:12:08] you know just dwelling on some things
[1:12:10] and you talk with some people about this
[1:12:12] that that aren't Christians or or or
[1:12:14] don't believe this end time message and
[1:12:16] you can talk till you're blue in the
[1:12:18] face and they won't get it they won't
[1:12:21] get it but we can't get frustrated at
[1:12:24] those things we can't put those people
[1:12:25] out we just say lord they're in your
[1:12:27] hands anyways we're not going to argue
[1:12:29] them in we're not going to you know
[1:12:31] discipline them in or any of these
[1:12:32] things it's got to be God that does it
[1:12:34] and it's him that opens the eyes amen
[1:12:37] it's him that opens the eyes that they
[1:12:38] can come out of these things but you
[1:12:40] know I hate to finish on a bad note with
[1:12:42] Moses but Moses ended on a bad note it's
[1:12:45] the unfortunate thing is that he his
[1:12:47] failure stopped him right at the edge uh
[1:12:49] of the promised land and so God takes
[1:12:51] him up and yes God has a Heavenly
[1:12:53] funeral for him and these different
[1:12:55] things but I want you to see that Moses
[1:12:57] failures didn't stop the children of
[1:12:59] Israel moses' weakness didn't stop the
[1:13:01] children of Israel but what did it do it
[1:13:03] prepared the next generation of
[1:13:05] leadership to follow right behind him
[1:13:07] and continue on to the Fulfillment of
[1:13:09] the word and Promises of God it didn't
[1:13:11] stop them it prepared them we see what
[1:13:14] happened in numbers 27 that God says to
[1:13:16] Moses he says he says Moses take Joshua
[1:13:19] he has the spirit in him take him and
[1:13:21] bring him close to you and start to
[1:13:23] train him and get him ready because he's
[1:13:25] going to replace you when this is all
[1:13:27] said and done and so Joshua gets this
[1:13:30] this this front seat view of how God
[1:13:32] deals with Moses and what leadership
[1:13:34] looks like what it looks like to make
[1:13:36] decisions how to make decisions amen we
[1:13:38] don't just walk around and say I'm going
[1:13:40] to do this and do that but he saw what
[1:13:41] it meant to go into the presence of God
[1:13:43] and wait on God Amen he saw what it
[1:13:45] meant when you found the will of God
[1:13:47] that God always backed it up and it
[1:13:49] trained Joshua now so that when he goes
[1:13:51] into the land he's going to lead the way
[1:13:53] that Moses does and know we know when
[1:13:55] Moses is about to die he calls Joshua
[1:13:58] before the people and he ordains him to
[1:14:00] lead the people Moses didn't pick Joshua
[1:14:03] God picked Joshua amen we don't pick our
[1:14:08] positions church we aren't even supposed
[1:14:10] to pick men God picks men God picks
[1:14:14] Ministries and when we look in our lives
[1:14:16] God picks spouses God picks all of these
[1:14:20] things for us and he places them and if
[1:14:22] we know that God has placed us and God
[1:14:24] has picked us then we can have
[1:14:25] confidence in the results that are going
[1:14:27] to come out of it amen God will place Us
[1:14:29] in his time God picked Joshua before
[1:14:31] then but all those years he's training
[1:14:33] Joshua up and then finally God places
[1:14:35] him God picks span of time God places
[1:14:39] that's the adoption process we know that
[1:14:42] now watch what this looks
[1:14:43] like it says and Moses called unto
[1:14:45] Joshua and said unto him in the sight of
[1:14:47] all Israel be strong and of a good
[1:14:49] courage for thou must go with this
[1:14:52] people unto the land which the Lord has
[1:14:53] sworn unto their fathers to give him to
[1:14:56] give them and thou shalt cause them to
[1:14:58] inherit it for the Lord he it is that
[1:15:01] doth go before thee he will be with thee
[1:15:04] he will not fail thee neither forsake
[1:15:06] thee fear not neither be dismayed church
[1:15:10] it's a wonderful thing when the prophet
[1:15:12] comes and tells us what the promise is
[1:15:14] for our day amen he shows us the word
[1:15:16] for our day but let me tell you we've
[1:15:18] got to come to the place where God is
[1:15:21] making those things real to us where
[1:15:23] what's on 1200 tapes comes into our
[1:15:25] lives and it starts to become a reality
[1:15:27] inside of us and that's what he's saying
[1:15:29] to Joshua is he's saying Joshua you've
[1:15:31] got all the books now but now it's time
[1:15:33] to go be the book now it's time to get
[1:15:35] what's written in the book for this
[1:15:37] people and it's time to come in and go
[1:15:40] beyond God sent a prophet to say what is
[1:15:42] that Prophet supposed to do he's
[1:15:44] supposed to give us a restoring message
[1:15:47] the message is supposed to do something
[1:15:50] it's supposed to produce something it's
[1:15:53] not just intellectual knowledge it's
[1:15:55] just not understanding scriptures it's
[1:15:57] not just signs and wonders but it's a
[1:15:59] word that has the power to transform us
[1:16:02] into Sons and Daughters of God that are
[1:16:03] going into resurrection and Rapture the
[1:16:05] word is power to transform amen it's not
[1:16:08] just to sit there but you know after
[1:16:11] this Moses died and you know I I
[1:16:13] finished the book of Deuteronomy a
[1:16:14] couple of months ago and when I read
[1:16:15] where Moses died I literally wanted to
[1:16:18] cry in all seriousness I just sat there
[1:16:21] and I felt like mourning because we saw
[1:16:23] all that Moses did and he was near
[1:16:26] perfect and he was so essential and he
[1:16:29] stood in the Gap and he held the people
[1:16:31] together and he kept going forward and
[1:16:33] his patience and his longsuffering was
[1:16:35] just immense and the people never
[1:16:38] recognized what they had they truly
[1:16:40] didn't understand how good of a man God
[1:16:43] had given them and the pain and the
[1:16:45] suffering and the torment that Prophet
[1:16:47] went through on their behalf and so when
[1:16:50] he died we know the whole the whole of
[1:16:52] Israel went into mourning and and they
[1:16:54] just couldn't move forward but I love
[1:16:56] the way that God works because we go
[1:16:58] into places and we know that we Face
[1:17:01] trials and heartbreak and sorrow and and
[1:17:03] even our own failures and we go into a
[1:17:05] place of mourning or maybe even
[1:17:07] depression but God never leaves us there
[1:17:10] amen we can choose to stay there but God
[1:17:13] never leaves us there he always makes a
[1:17:15] way of escape and so he brings now a man
[1:17:18] that can take them out and take him into
[1:17:19] the land that he'll pick up where Moses
[1:17:21] left off and there'll be no loss in the
[1:17:23] continuity of the word the leading of
[1:17:25] God that's the way God does it is he
[1:17:28] always gives us a way of Escape he gives
[1:17:30] us a way to move forward amen he doesn't
[1:17:33] just leave them with a prophet's message
[1:17:35] let me say it again he doesn't just
[1:17:37] leave them with a prophet's message but
[1:17:39] he himself comes down to take them into
[1:17:42] the reality of that message that's what
[1:17:44] I'm resting in is not that we got a
[1:17:46] message that we've got a God that's
[1:17:48] behind that message to bring us into the
[1:17:49] reality of it amen God comes down with a
[1:17:52] visitation and his purpose is to fulfill
[1:17:54] fulfill the message in our lives and me
[1:17:56] to fulfill the word for this age but
[1:17:59] Watch What Happens now because Joshua's
[1:18:02] been with Moses he's been in the
[1:18:04] presence of God with Moses but now Moses
[1:18:06] is
[1:18:09] gone Moses is gone now Joshua's got to
[1:18:12] learn to walk on his own two feet before
[1:18:14] the same God Watch What Happens here it
[1:18:16] says now after the death of Moses the
[1:18:18] servant of the Lord it came to pass that
[1:18:20] the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of
[1:18:22] nun Moses Minister saying Moses my
[1:18:25] servant is dead I remember when brother
[1:18:27] Paul lonan was preaching this and I was
[1:18:29] listening to it he was here preaching it
[1:18:31] and I was listening to it over in BC and
[1:18:33] as soon as he started preaching this it
[1:18:34] was like the spirit of God swept over me
[1:18:36] and I just wanted to get in there and
[1:18:37] preach with them I don't think you can
[1:18:38] have two preachers preaching at the same
[1:18:40] time but I want to be right there with
[1:18:41] them because it just jumped out to me
[1:18:43] how this moves forward he says now
[1:18:46] therefore arise get up put off the
[1:18:49] morning
[1:18:50] ashes move
[1:18:53] forward God's not Dead The Prophet's
[1:18:56] dead but God's not dead he says go over
[1:19:00] this Jordan thou and all this people
[1:19:02] under the lamb which I do give to them
[1:19:04] even to the children of Israel every
[1:19:07] place Hallelujah every place if you can
[1:19:11] read it you can have it if you'll walk
[1:19:14] by faith I'll give it to you you just
[1:19:16] have to walk Church you just have to
[1:19:20] walk but the thing is we forget that it
[1:19:22] takes time to walk we've got to fight to
[1:19:25] make those steps so many times and what
[1:19:28] we do is we get fighting and we say it's
[1:19:30] too much and we back away no every place
[1:19:33] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:19:36] upon that have I given unto
[1:19:39] you what as I said unto Moses see the
[1:19:44] continuity of the word here it's not
[1:19:46] just to one man church it's to the
[1:19:48] Believers it is to the multi-member body
[1:19:52] of Jesus Christ and so God just Carries
[1:19:54] On
[1:19:55] the word didn't stop when brother
[1:19:57] brandham left the Holy Spirit didn't go
[1:19:58] away when brother brandham left but God
[1:20:00] didn't stop speaking when the prophet
[1:20:02] left but now he's come down in a
[1:20:04] multi-member bride and she is the last
[1:20:06] voice to the last generation it's the
[1:20:08] last thing before we go he's still here
[1:20:11] he's still with the
[1:20:12] bride he says and from the Wilderness
[1:20:15] and this Lebanon even under the Great
[1:20:17] River the river Euphrates all the land
[1:20:19] of the Hittites under the great sea
[1:20:21] toward the going down of the sun shall
[1:20:23] be your Coast you know the Palestinians
[1:20:25] they're saying from the sea from the
[1:20:27] ocean to the River from the sea to the
[1:20:29] river too bad joshua4 says it belongs to
[1:20:33] Israel they'll never get it but they
[1:20:36] want it but the promise of God stands
[1:20:39] sure it belongs to
[1:20:42] Israel verse five there shall not any
[1:20:46] man be able to stand before thee all the
[1:20:48] days of thy life as I was with Moses so
[1:20:52] I will be with thee I will not fail thee
[1:20:56] nor forsake
[1:20:58] you that's my scripture church that's
[1:21:01] your scripture I love this scripture
[1:21:03] this is me this is me because you got to
[1:21:05] remember when I look at my life and see
[1:21:07] where I've had to come and grow up I've
[1:21:10] had to sit under a pastor I've had to
[1:21:12] sit under Ministries I've had to grow
[1:21:13] through deaconship and evangelism and
[1:21:16] now into pastorship and everywhere you
[1:21:19] see people pass on people move away and
[1:21:22] you've got to step right in behind and
[1:21:23] you've got to do the same things they
[1:21:25] did and guess what they didn't do it it
[1:21:28] was the god behind them that did it
[1:21:30] anden we look at our parents and we see
[1:21:32] how well they did we look at our
[1:21:33] Ministries and we see how well they did
[1:21:35] and we've got to step in We Are The Next
[1:21:37] Generation Church the older generation
[1:21:40] is nearly done here there is a
[1:21:41] generation that is not just rising up
[1:21:43] she's here and she's got to be able to
[1:21:45] say as he was with them so he is with me
[1:21:48] by personal experience by promise first
[1:21:51] but by personal experience second that
[1:21:53] God is behind us because we're walking
[1:21:56] in the promise of his word listen God
[1:21:59] did not say to Joshua Joshua you will be
[1:22:02] Flawless Joshua you will be perfect
[1:22:05] Joshua you won't have troubles Joshua
[1:22:07] you won't have struggles no why because
[1:22:10] God sees what's coming he knows that
[1:22:12] ain's going to cause them to fall he
[1:22:14] knows that Joshua's going to miss his
[1:22:16] leadership he knows that people are
[1:22:18] going to die under Joshua's watch but
[1:22:20] he's saying Joshua don't look at
[1:22:22] yourself look at me I'm the the differen
[1:22:25] maker I'm the mighty conqueror I'm the
[1:22:27] Victorious one it's because I'm with you
[1:22:29] that this is going to happen it's not on
[1:22:31] your shoulders it's on mine look at me
[1:22:34] amen God's telling Joshua here here's
[1:22:37] the effect of Moses
[1:22:40] message this is the effect we're in the
[1:22:43] time of the effect of the message not
[1:22:45] the preaching of the message that's
[1:22:47] already been done we're here in the time
[1:22:49] of the effect of the message it's
[1:22:50] claiming The Inheritance amen God knows
[1:22:54] what's coming God knows and so his
[1:22:56] message is about himself his unfailing
[1:22:59] word his promises his power his victory
[1:23:03] not Joshua he's telling Joshua look at
[1:23:06] me just look at me and you'll be okay
[1:23:08] what is Satan trying to do get you
[1:23:10] looking at the mirror instead of looking
[1:23:12] at Calvary amen get you looking at what
[1:23:14] you're doing rather than what the word
[1:23:16] says you're supposed to do Satan's
[1:23:18] hoping that we'll rely on ourselves
[1:23:19] rather than rest on the god that
[1:23:21] promised it that's what Satan's trying
[1:23:22] to do is get us looking at ourselves oh
[1:23:24] if we could only realize the greatness
[1:23:26] of the god that's moving with us church
[1:23:28] that's what's the difference maker in
[1:23:30] all of these things it's Christ with us
[1:23:32] it's Christ in Us by the Holy Ghost and
[1:23:34] that's what makes the difference in the
[1:23:35] situation not what I want or what I
[1:23:37] don't want not what I like or what I
[1:23:38] don't like not what I say or don't say
[1:23:40] but it's Christ in me the hope of glory
[1:23:42] that makes the difference in my life
[1:23:44] brother Braham said this he says but the
[1:23:47] greatest thing I found in Christian Life
[1:23:50] is letting the Holy Spirit lead you and
[1:23:52] guide you
[1:23:54] can we say Amen this morning what's the
[1:23:57] result and his work is marvelous his
[1:24:02] work is marvelous it's his work from
[1:24:04] start to finish he's the author he's the
[1:24:05] finisher of our faith
[1:24:07] amen God said to Joshua I will be with
[1:24:10] you just like I was with Moses I'll lead
[1:24:13] you I'll guide you I'll give you the
[1:24:15] plans I'll give you the victory I'll
[1:24:17] destroy your enemies I'll undertake on
[1:24:18] your behalf I'll give you the full
[1:24:20] promise of the word just like I did with
[1:24:22] Moses nothing's going to stop here but
[1:24:25] watch what he
[1:24:28] says only be thou strong and very
[1:24:32] courageous it still takes courage to
[1:24:34] take God at his
[1:24:36] word that thou mayest
[1:24:40] observe catch
[1:24:43] it the
[1:24:45] hardness of the
[1:24:47] Gospel is in sticking with it the
[1:24:51] courage that's required is that you may
[1:24:53] observe to do according to all the
[1:24:55] law the courage is to stay with the word
[1:24:58] when every fiber of your logical being
[1:25:01] says Go a different
[1:25:03] way amen what when everything in you
[1:25:06] everything in this carnal nature is
[1:25:08] screaming do what everybody else does
[1:25:11] stay with the word look at what happens
[1:25:14] when they go to Jericho conventional
[1:25:17] wisdom would say you Siege it and you
[1:25:20] bring up battering weapons and you do
[1:25:21] this but here's the thing that had never
[1:25:23] destroyed Jericho Jericho had not been
[1:25:26] lost and so instead they have to walk
[1:25:28] around day after day after day
[1:25:31] quietly the courage is to do what God
[1:25:33] says to do and stick with it no matter
[1:25:39] what be thou strong and very courageous
[1:25:41] that thou mayest observe to do according
[1:25:43] to all the law which Moses my servant
[1:25:45] commanded thee turn not from it to the
[1:25:47] right-hander to the left that thou
[1:25:49] mayest Prosper withersoever thou goest
[1:25:52] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:25:54] out of thy mouth Thou shalt meditate
[1:25:56] therein day and night that thou mayest
[1:25:58] observe to do according to all that is
[1:26:00] written therein for then for then Thou
[1:26:04] shalt make thy way prosperous and then
[1:26:07] Thou shalt have good success not just
[1:26:10] success good success Godly success have
[1:26:13] not I commanded thee be strong and of a
[1:26:16] good courage Be not Afraid neither be
[1:26:19] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[1:26:21] with thee withersoever thou goest
[1:26:25] it's a promise but there's a requirement
[1:26:27] here God says just as I was with Moses
[1:26:30] I'll be with you but what does Joshua
[1:26:31] have to do Joshua has to believe like
[1:26:33] Moses Joshua has to seek like Moses
[1:26:36] Joshua has to have faith like Moses
[1:26:38] Joshua has to wait like Moses amen we
[1:26:41] forget all these things when we're
[1:26:42] looking at adoption as we're waiting for
[1:26:44] all this Authority and power but we
[1:26:45] forget the way to get there the
[1:26:48] character development the training the
[1:26:49] testing the proving the waiting the
[1:26:52] seeking there's a lot more of sitting
[1:26:54] quietly than there is thus sayeth the
[1:26:56] Lord because not God's not running
[1:26:59] around telling us to do all these things
[1:27:00] all the time but it's just Faithfully
[1:27:02] staying with his word until he gives you
[1:27:04] something and then you go do it but just
[1:27:07] day by
[1:27:09] day Joshua's got to act like Moses to
[1:27:11] get moses' results sometimes I think
[1:27:14] we're just sitting here I'm not saying
[1:27:16] this church I'm saying in general across
[1:27:18] the message we're secure in knowing our
[1:27:20] age and its
[1:27:22] message and we think that's what makes
[1:27:24] us go in a Rapture that is not what
[1:27:27] makes us go in a
[1:27:28] Rapture we're supposed to become the
[1:27:31] embodiment of the message not the
[1:27:34] intellectual carriers of the message
[1:27:36] amen the message is supposed to do
[1:27:38] something and so J God says to Joshua
[1:27:41] Joshua don't change anything that's
[1:27:44] coming out of your lips except the word
[1:27:45] let the word be the only thing you speak
[1:27:48] and he says to make sure that happens
[1:27:50] meditate day and night on that word stay
[1:27:53] with the word
[1:27:54] brother BR would say get back to the
[1:27:56] word get back to the word get back to
[1:27:58] the word why because when you do that
[1:28:01] you'll do what you read if you dwell on
[1:28:04] the word you'll become the word amen
[1:28:06] it'll produce the word in our life
[1:28:08] you'll be what God says you're supposed
[1:28:09] to be that's your good success is when
[1:28:11] you become the very thing that you're
[1:28:12] reading about amen that's when you have
[1:28:15] Victory why because you're centered on
[1:28:16] the word of God you're centered on the
[1:28:19] word of
[1:28:20] God that way the depth of the river in
[1:28:23] front of you doesn't matter
[1:28:24] matter that way when you come up to
[1:28:26] Jordan it doesn't matter how wide it
[1:28:28] looks how rough it looks how how how
[1:28:31] wide the edges are because of the floods
[1:28:33] the height of the walls of Jericho
[1:28:34] doesn't bother you when you come up to
[1:28:35] it why because you're in the middle of
[1:28:37] the word of God and you know you're in
[1:28:39] his will you know you're in his plan the
[1:28:41] size of the army or the size of the
[1:28:43] Giants facing us they don't bother us
[1:28:45] why because we're centered on his word
[1:28:47] Thy word have I hid in my heart that I
[1:28:49] might not sin against
[1:28:51] the why we're living by faith in the
[1:28:53] word of God that's given to us
[1:28:55] personally personally it's a day-by-day
[1:28:58] thing you know they're about to go into
[1:29:00] the land and we see that even the land
[1:29:02] the entrance into the land was a special
[1:29:04] moment for them but I want you to see
[1:29:06] how God reinforces what he's saying to
[1:29:07] Joshua here and to the people and I say
[1:29:10] that because we have no excuses anymore
[1:29:13] God makes his way so abundantly clear
[1:29:15] the scripture says that a man though a
[1:29:16] fool should not air therein the way of
[1:29:18] Holiness anybody ought to be able to
[1:29:20] read it and do it it's not that
[1:29:23] difficult
[1:29:24] but what happens is the word Cuts away
[1:29:26] all the smoke all the
[1:29:28] fog all the deception and it lays it be
[1:29:31] and it says do it or don't do it but
[1:29:34] watch how God tells them tells them to
[1:29:35] come into the land he says Joshua Rose
[1:29:38] early in the morning and they removed
[1:29:39] from from shaim and came to Jordan he
[1:29:42] and all the children of Israel and
[1:29:43] lodged there before they passed over and
[1:29:46] it came to pass after three days that
[1:29:47] the officers went through the host and
[1:29:49] they commanded the people saying when
[1:29:51] you see the Ark of the Covenant of the
[1:29:52] Lord your God and and the priests the
[1:29:54] Levites burying it then you shall remove
[1:29:56] from your place and go after it yet
[1:29:59] there shall be a space between you and
[1:30:01] it about 2,000 cubits by measure come
[1:30:04] not near unto it that ye may know that
[1:30:06] ye may know the way by which you must go
[1:30:08] for ye have not passed this way here to
[1:30:13] before you've never been here before
[1:30:15] you've never done this before and so
[1:30:17] there's an order there's a way of doing
[1:30:19] this and he says don't run ahead don't
[1:30:22] get excited because the president pres
[1:30:24] of the Lord is here don't
[1:30:26] presume wait on what God has showed you
[1:30:29] to do let him lead the way follow the
[1:30:32] word and the word will lead you into the
[1:30:34] fullness of the promise the word goes
[1:30:37] before why because sometimes we got to
[1:30:40] grow up a little before we can get the
[1:30:42] promise sometimes we've got a little bit
[1:30:44] of something go before we can get the
[1:30:47] promise sometimes we've got to endure a
[1:30:49] while Abraham and Sarah had to endure a
[1:30:52] while but they were faithful to God
[1:30:55] speaking those that were not as if they
[1:30:58] were we've got to show our faith and
[1:31:00] when we show our faith we recognize that
[1:31:02] God's doing something in our lives how
[1:31:03] many times did Brother Braham say you
[1:31:04] didn't realize you had that much
[1:31:06] Faith why because somebody took God at
[1:31:08] his word and they didn't realize how
[1:31:10] much God had done in their life
[1:31:12] already God told Joshua in three days
[1:31:15] that's the
[1:31:16] time he says the word goes first that's
[1:31:19] the order and then he saysi separate the
[1:31:22] waters that's the how God gives him a
[1:31:24] time God gives him a way and God gives
[1:31:26] him the means and God's got to do that
[1:31:28] the waters aren't going to separate if I
[1:31:30] run up to the waters it's got to be the
[1:31:32] ministry with the word that goes first
[1:31:34] and as soon as their foot comes down the
[1:31:36] waters will
[1:31:37] separate if somebody presumed to try and
[1:31:39] cross Jordan because I've got the
[1:31:41] promise glory to God they'd have
[1:31:43] drowned they had to follow it in God's
[1:31:45] timing and God's season whatever we do
[1:31:47] Church the word has to go before us the
[1:31:50] word has to make the way that's our
[1:31:52] confidence because if God says it and
[1:31:54] God sets us into motion then God's going
[1:31:56] to make it happen in the time that of
[1:31:57] his choicing of his choosing amen why
[1:32:00] was Joshua Crossing Jordan because God
[1:32:02] told him to do it how did Joshua Cross
[1:32:04] Jordan the way God told him to do it
[1:32:06] when did he do it when God told him and
[1:32:07] it happened exactly the way that God
[1:32:09] said it
[1:32:10] would that's where we get our anointing
[1:32:12] we get our anointing from seeing the
[1:32:14] word for our day and then God putting it
[1:32:16] into action when we see these things
[1:32:18] happening around us amen that's what
[1:32:19] this Le toyan end time message is doing
[1:32:21] for us it's anointing us to fulfill the
[1:32:23] word and those men were anointed those
[1:32:25] priests were anointed to walk up so that
[1:32:27] as soon as they came up to the edge of
[1:32:28] that water soon as that foot started
[1:32:30] coming down the waters parted they're
[1:32:34] anointed to cross on dry land brother
[1:32:37] Bram says he says here it anoints us
[1:32:39] when we see we're living in the last
[1:32:41] days we see what's happening with Israel
[1:32:43] church that's God's time piece has
[1:32:45] always been God's time piece see he
[1:32:46] works with the Gentiles in
[1:32:48] generalities there's no set time but
[1:32:50] with the Jews he is very specific his
[1:32:53] times are are very specific with them
[1:32:54] you see all the prophecies with them are
[1:32:56] for a particular time right we have the
[1:32:58] 70 weeks of Daniel we have the the years
[1:33:01] of them being in in Babylon and these
[1:33:03] different things and it's all laid down
[1:33:04] to very strict timelines God works with
[1:33:06] Israel very quickly and we see where
[1:33:08] we're at today he says with anoints us
[1:33:10] when we see that we're living in the
[1:33:12] last days to find out that all these
[1:33:14] signs that we see taking place that
[1:33:16] spoke of in the scripture would take
[1:33:18] place in the last days all the way from
[1:33:20] Heaven to the political Powers the
[1:33:22] nature of the people come on as it was
[1:33:25] in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah it is
[1:33:27] here it is here this month is a
[1:33:29] celebration of Sodom and Gomorrah church
[1:33:32] it's here political powers are behind it
[1:33:34] spiritual powers are behind it Financial
[1:33:37] powers are behind it everything is
[1:33:39] supporting Sodom and Gomorrah for this
[1:33:42] month he says the nature of the people
[1:33:45] the demoralization of the world and
[1:33:47] among the women and how they would do in
[1:33:49] the last days and how the men would do
[1:33:51] and how the churches would do how the
[1:33:52] nations would do and how God would do
[1:33:55] and we see it all laying right here on
[1:33:57] us he says oh it anoints what our
[1:34:00] faith why because we see what's
[1:34:02] happening there's a revelation of what's
[1:34:04] going on and it's quickening something
[1:34:06] inside of us to say hey there's got to
[1:34:08] be something happening to the bride if
[1:34:09] there's something happening out there as
[1:34:11] well he says it moves us out in the
[1:34:13] great Cycles it separates us from the
[1:34:16] other things of the world no matter how
[1:34:18] little we are how much a minority we are
[1:34:21] how much we're laughed at or made fun of
[1:34:23] it doesn't make a bit of difference
[1:34:25] that's all he says why we see it he says
[1:34:29] there is something within us we are
[1:34:32] predestinated to see this hour and
[1:34:34] there's nothing going to stop us from
[1:34:36] seeing
[1:34:36] it let me read that again we are
[1:34:39] predestinated to see this hour and
[1:34:42] there's nothing going to stop us from
[1:34:43] seeing it church that's the anchor of
[1:34:45] our souls is that he said we'd be there
[1:34:48] he said we'd see it he said we'd be a
[1:34:50] part of it he says amen here God has
[1:34:52] spoken it's already happened we see it
[1:34:55] oh how we thank God for this oh then it
[1:34:57] brings out your faith when we see all
[1:35:00] these things happening here there's
[1:35:01] things that seem so obvious to us today
[1:35:03] church and you try and talk to another
[1:35:06] Christian about it and they don't have a
[1:35:07] clue what you're talking about I was
[1:35:09] showing my wife something there
[1:35:11] yesterday and there's um there's this
[1:35:14] guy he's got a PhD in Theology and he's
[1:35:15] got this thing called real real uh real
[1:35:18] Bible
[1:35:19] Believers on YouTube and so I I watched
[1:35:23] something he said there and he said you
[1:35:25] know the gospel is different came
[1:35:27] differently to the Jews than it did to
[1:35:28] the Gentiles he says the apostles were
[1:35:31] one way but Paul was completely
[1:35:32] different from the apostles he had a
[1:35:34] completely different type of ministry
[1:35:35] and this and that the other thing and
[1:35:36] I'm sitting there saying are you even
[1:35:38] reading your Bible Paul spoke in tongues
[1:35:41] Paul had signs and wonders Paul healed
[1:35:43] the sick Paul cast out demons Paul was
[1:35:45] led by the Holy Spirit and Paul preached
[1:35:46] the word he was the 12th Apostle he was
[1:35:49] literally exactly like all the rest of
[1:35:51] them and yet he's sitting there saying
[1:35:53] Paul was completely different from the
[1:35:54] rest of them but in action and word and
[1:35:57] In Deed everything Paul did was just
[1:35:58] like the rest of them why because he's
[1:36:01] blinded he's blinded he'll say things
[1:36:04] that you need one all you need is one
[1:36:06] scripture to disprove him wrong and he
[1:36:07] can't see it in all of his phds of
[1:36:09] theology why he doesn't want to see it
[1:36:12] he's blinded by it he can't see it but
[1:36:14] we see it we see what's going on and
[1:36:16] it's only God's grace it is only God's
[1:36:18] grace it is not our intellect that's
[1:36:20] brought us here it is only God's grace
[1:36:22] cuz he put a seed in inside of us to
[1:36:24] catch it that's the only thing it's the
[1:36:26] only thing that ought to keep our pride
[1:36:27] in check that's for sure but I want to
[1:36:30] take us to Joshua 10 as we start to
[1:36:31] close this
[1:36:32] morning as we're speaking on Authority
[1:36:35] by position I want you to see what it
[1:36:36] looks like when Revelation strikes about
[1:36:38] who you are and what you're doing on
[1:36:40] this Earth and we know that Joshua has
[1:36:42] these five kings that unite against him
[1:36:44] and he's facing a big army because
[1:36:45] they're trying to break Israel in one
[1:36:46] Fell Swoop they want one battle get it
[1:36:48] done with and push the Israelites back
[1:36:50] and so Joshua gathers all the Warriors
[1:36:52] and he goes to meet but I want you to
[1:36:54] see what God says to Joshua
[1:36:57] here says and the Lord said unto Joshua
[1:37:00] fear them
[1:37:02] not but I want you to see why for I have
[1:37:06] delivered them into thine hand there
[1:37:08] shall not a man of them stand before
[1:37:10] Thee I want you to see the tenses there
[1:37:12] fear not why because I have past tense
[1:37:16] delivered them into your hand and then
[1:37:18] he jumps to the Future there shall not a
[1:37:21] man of them stand before thee it's a
[1:37:23] finished work in God's
[1:37:25] eyes that's why you don't have to fear
[1:37:28] it's a finished work but he says now
[1:37:29] when you get into the battle you're
[1:37:31] going to win not a single one of them is
[1:37:33] going to be able to stand before you and
[1:37:34] defeat you the battle is ahead the work
[1:37:36] is already done that's the challenge for
[1:37:39] the Believers to see it through God's
[1:37:40] eyes from eternity it's a finished work
[1:37:42] he's saying Joshua it's already done
[1:37:44] buddy just go in there and fight
[1:37:46] nothing's going to beat you he says and
[1:37:48] the Lord discomforted them before Israel
[1:37:50] and slew them with a great Slaughter of
[1:37:52] gibian and chased them all the way down
[1:37:54] that goes up to bethor and smot them to
[1:37:56] ezeka and under Mak and it came to pass
[1:37:59] as they fled from before Israel so
[1:38:01] Israel fights and they get the moving
[1:38:03] and we the going down to bethon that the
[1:38:06] Lord cast down great stones from Heaven
[1:38:08] upon them unto ASA and there and they
[1:38:11] died and there were more which died with
[1:38:13] hailstones than they whom the children
[1:38:15] of Israel slew with the sword what did
[1:38:17] Paul say if God be for us who can be
[1:38:19] against us there they're fighting nobody
[1:38:22] can stand before them but it has and
[1:38:23] killed them all and so God starts
[1:38:25] sending down these massive hailstones
[1:38:26] and more are killed by the hailstones
[1:38:28] from God's hands than are killed by the
[1:38:29] swords held by the
[1:38:31] people he says then spake Joshua unto
[1:38:34] the Lord in the day which the Lord
[1:38:35] delivered up the amorites before the
[1:38:37] children of Israel and he said in the
[1:38:39] sight of Israel Church catch this Joshua
[1:38:43] does not go into the prayer closet he
[1:38:45] doesn't go in and he doesn't he doesn't
[1:38:47] say now Lord Lord we need some help here
[1:38:51] Lord and I don't want no no in the the
[1:38:53] sight of Israel he stands up
[1:38:56] publicly and he says son stand thou
[1:39:00] still upon gibian and thou moon in the
[1:39:03] valley of
[1:39:05] aelon Joshua knew he was on the Lord's
[1:39:11] business and the sun Stood Still and the
[1:39:14] moon stayed until the people had Avenged
[1:39:17] themselves upon their enemies in other
[1:39:18] words until the job was
[1:39:21] done is this not written in the book of
[1:39:24] jasher so the sun Stood Still in the
[1:39:26] midst of heaven and hasted not to go
[1:39:28] down about a whole
[1:39:31] day I can't imagine the mathematics God
[1:39:34] had to do to make that
[1:39:35] work but we get a bit of an idea it says
[1:39:38] there was no day like that before it or
[1:39:40] after it that the Lord hearkened unto
[1:39:42] the voice of a man for the Lord fought
[1:39:44] for Israel God says I'll do it once I'm
[1:39:46] never doing that again but you know we
[1:39:48] can go back because we have the science
[1:39:51] now to go back and we can literally go
[1:39:53] back back and spin all the things around
[1:39:55] in this earth and we know all the orbits
[1:39:57] and all the paths and and how long it
[1:40:00] takes these things to spin around and
[1:40:01] they have gone back and they have shown
[1:40:02] that we're missing time and if you add
[1:40:04] up all the times that God stopped things
[1:40:06] in the Bible it adds up
[1:40:08] perfectly you know they can go back and
[1:40:11] they can literally come up with that
[1:40:13] with the the uh Eclipse that happened
[1:40:15] over
[1:40:16] Calvary they can do all of these things
[1:40:18] with science now to go back and showed
[1:40:21] that it actually happened
[1:40:24] God says it happened once it'll never
[1:40:26] happen again but that man knew where he
[1:40:29] stood see what happened is Joshua
[1:40:31] learned from Moses Moses hesitation
[1:40:34] Moses taught it to Joshua Joshua when
[1:40:36] God tells you to do something all of
[1:40:39] Heaven is at your back we're going to
[1:40:41] talk about that a little bit in a in a
[1:40:43] couple of services Lord willing all of
[1:40:45] Heaven is at your back when you're
[1:40:48] walking in his word amen listen to this
[1:40:50] he says Joshua was anointed to to take
[1:40:53] the land for God and for his people the
[1:40:56] day was short he needed more time for
[1:40:57] the job that he was anointed and
[1:40:59] commissioned to do anointed and
[1:41:01] commissioned Joshua a man he was
[1:41:04] anointed God told him as I was with
[1:41:06] Moses I'll be with you amen that land
[1:41:08] I'm going to give it to them and I want
[1:41:10] you to go over there and clean out the
[1:41:11] amalekites and all the others the
[1:41:13] Philistines the parasites perizzites and
[1:41:16] all the different ones clean them out
[1:41:18] I'm with you no man will stand before
[1:41:20] you all the days of your life no man can
[1:41:22] bother you go on in there anointed and
[1:41:26] commission Church what's your anointing
[1:41:27] today and what's your
[1:41:29] commission because if you have an
[1:41:31] anointing you have a commission then
[1:41:32] you've got orders what are your orders
[1:41:35] what are your orders do we have orders
[1:41:38] are we just walking
[1:41:41] around listen Joshua drew the sword and
[1:41:44] said follow me and he got over there and
[1:41:46] here he was fighting and what was it he
[1:41:48] routed the enemy there were little
[1:41:49] bunches here and little bunches there
[1:41:51] when night came they would all get
[1:41:52] together and Garrison together and come
[1:41:54] with a big Force against him and the sun
[1:41:56] was going down he needed more light the
[1:41:59] sun was going down he didn't fall on his
[1:42:01] knees and say Lord God what shall I do
[1:42:04] what shall I do he says he spoke he had
[1:42:07] a need he had a need based on his
[1:42:11] commission based on his orders it wasn't
[1:42:14] his choice it was God's command to him
[1:42:17] to go do this and so all he's doing is
[1:42:19] fulfilling God's
[1:42:21] command it's not it's a nice
[1:42:23] have it's not a want to have it's a I
[1:42:27] need this to finish the job
[1:42:30] Lord he said Son stand still he didn't
[1:42:32] cry to nothing he commanded son stand
[1:42:35] still I've got a need of this I'm the
[1:42:39] servant of the Lord anointed for this
[1:42:41] job and I've got a need stand still and
[1:42:43] don't you shine and moon you hang where
[1:42:45] you're at till he fought the Battle
[1:42:47] through and whipped the whole thing down
[1:42:50] and the son obeyed him
[1:42:53] see God keeps training God keeps
[1:42:56] building up and Joshua doesn't make the
[1:42:58] mistake of
[1:43:00] Moses he doesn't have a why cry speak
[1:43:02] moment he speaks because the need is
[1:43:06] there the whole plan is laid in front of
[1:43:08] him and he says listen God told me to do
[1:43:10] it I'm anointed for it I'm just going to
[1:43:12] do it and he spoke and I don't know
[1:43:14] where that came from church I don't know
[1:43:16] what kind of a revelation you need to
[1:43:17] make the Sun and the Moon stand still
[1:43:19] but whatever it was that was the
[1:43:20] anointing that was on Joshua I don't
[1:43:22] believe joshu came up with this on his
[1:43:24] own that's what the anointing is about
[1:43:26] is that you will speak according to the
[1:43:28] anointing and I believe God wanted him
[1:43:30] to do it and it was a Vindication that
[1:43:33] God was with Jo Joshua in a very very
[1:43:35] special way Joshua knows when God sends
[1:43:39] you speak the word and God will back it
[1:43:42] up if you have a need you ask for it God
[1:43:44] will back it up he says no crying out he
[1:43:47] spoke to the sun said you stand still
[1:43:48] Sun hang there Moon you stay where
[1:43:50] you're at he didn't cry out Lord no what
[1:43:52] can I do give me some more sunlight he
[1:43:54] had need of sunlight so he commanded it
[1:43:57] and the son obeyed him Oh my he
[1:43:59] commanded the son to stand
[1:44:02] still watch how we continue now he says
[1:44:05] Samson anointed raised up ordained of
[1:44:09] God given a gift of power was ordained
[1:44:12] to destroy the nation of the Philistines
[1:44:14] he was ordained born on the Earth
[1:44:16] anointed of God to destroy the
[1:44:18] Philistines and one day they caught him
[1:44:19] out in the field without a sword and
[1:44:21] without a spear and a thousand of those
[1:44:23] armored Philistines ran upon him at one
[1:44:25] time did he get down and say oh Lord I'm
[1:44:27] waiting for a vision oh Lord what must I
[1:44:29] do direct me now what to do he said he
[1:44:32] knew he had a need he found nothing but
[1:44:35] an old Jawbone of a mule and he beat
[1:44:37] down a thousand Philistines amen what is
[1:44:40] that in your
[1:44:41] hand what is that in your hand just take
[1:44:44] it and use it he says he never cried to
[1:44:48] God he used his anointed gift see see
[1:44:53] when you read in the scriptures we all
[1:44:54] tend to think of you know Samson as
[1:44:56] somebody that looked like Arnold
[1:44:57] Schwarzenegger you know big bodybuilder
[1:44:59] massive bulging muscles just bigger than
[1:45:02] everybody that is not what the scripture
[1:45:04] says about Samson the scripture says and
[1:45:06] the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Samson
[1:45:10] in other words and the Lord anointed
[1:45:11] Samson and that's when Samson did
[1:45:13] amazing things here's the thing it's no
[1:45:15] different for us we we may not be out
[1:45:18] there lifting up Gates and killing a
[1:45:19] thousand Philistines but the scripture
[1:45:21] says one of you shall chase a thousand
[1:45:24] amen there are Supernatural battles that
[1:45:26] are going on here and it's just little
[1:45:28] people anointed the difference is the
[1:45:32] anointing amen Samson was only strong
[1:45:35] when he was
[1:45:36] anointed that's the only time he had
[1:45:38] strength Church without the Holy Spirit
[1:45:41] we're weak and everything we do will not
[1:45:45] Prosper not Prosper according to God's
[1:45:48] way of doing things it might have an
[1:45:50] effect but it won't have a Godly effect
[1:45:53] he says he knew that he was sent for the
[1:45:55] job he knew he was born for that he knew
[1:45:57] he was anointed with a gift and he beat
[1:45:59] down a thousand Philistines he didn't
[1:46:01] cry to God why because God ordained him
[1:46:04] and Vindicated him that he was by other
[1:46:07] things that he had done see Samson had a
[1:46:09] lifetime of this already so what happens
[1:46:11] is eventually he doesn't have to say
[1:46:14] Lord is this my job because every time
[1:46:16] he's doing this job God is with them
[1:46:19] church if God is with you in what you're
[1:46:22] doing then why are are we questioning
[1:46:23] whether he's with us when we do it the
[1:46:24] next day he has proven himself now time
[1:46:27] and time again experience by experience
[1:46:30] you business owners he's proving himself
[1:46:32] you Brothers in your jobs he's proving
[1:46:34] himself I'm with you I'll take care of
[1:46:36] you so why do we worry why do we fret
[1:46:40] mothers fathers whatever it is young
[1:46:43] people if he's with you he's with you
[1:46:46] amen he doesn't go in come and go and
[1:46:48] come and go he's committed himself to
[1:46:50] his word and there's a word seat inside
[1:46:52] of us that he's committed to bring it
[1:46:53] out into full maturity he says he was a
[1:46:56] Vindicated anointed servant of God to do
[1:46:59] what destroy the
[1:47:00] Philistines and he did it no matter what
[1:47:03] the circumstances were he did it he
[1:47:05] never asked nothing that was his job and
[1:47:08] God was dealing through
[1:47:11] him he says he picked up that mulebone
[1:47:15] and got to beating
[1:47:16] Philistines you know we look at these
[1:47:19] things
[1:47:20] and I kind of had a giggle when I was
[1:47:23] going through this because we can kind
[1:47:25] of get in this you
[1:47:28] know I'm a mighty warrior like
[1:47:31] Samson and what do we want to do we want
[1:47:34] to meet force with Force
[1:47:37] right we want to go in and whatever they
[1:47:39] do we can do it better and more and
[1:47:42] greater and what we do is better than
[1:47:43] theirs and that's why we win you know
[1:47:45] we're a proud line of Warriors we're the
[1:47:48] coffee Warriors we're the klette
[1:47:50] Warriors Josh the ancient tribe of the
[1:47:53] columbos the great lion Killers you know
[1:47:57] no but see we can get caught up in this
[1:47:59] idea that I've got to go out there and
[1:48:01] I've just got to beat The Living
[1:48:02] Daylights out of whatever comes my
[1:48:07] way come
[1:48:10] on we have to meet force with Force but
[1:48:12] what is our weapon church it's the word
[1:48:16] of God quickened by the spirit and let
[1:48:20] me ask you when the word defeated you
[1:48:23] how did it do
[1:48:25] it did it come in and
[1:48:30] just is that what it did or did
[1:48:39] love did love reach down and call your
[1:48:45] name call you higher reach out a
[1:48:50] hand and completely and totally conquer
[1:48:56] self see we want to go out there and we
[1:48:58] want to
[1:48:59] destroy but remember it's about souls
[1:49:02] it's not about winning it's about souls
[1:49:07] amen yes the word convicts but it does
[1:49:11] not condemn Force condemns love convicts
[1:49:15] because it gives you a way out Satan
[1:49:18] wants you to condemn people Satan wants
[1:49:20] you to beat people up with what you know
[1:49:22] with your Revelation with your position
[1:49:25] that is not the work of God Amen brother
[1:49:28] Brandon remember he has two incidences
[1:49:29] where he deals with the bull and he
[1:49:31] deals with the Hornets remember the bull
[1:49:33] he's going to pray for somebody he walks
[1:49:35] into the field he disturbs it it's a
[1:49:36] bull that's already killed somebody and
[1:49:39] then the Hornets he's doing the same
[1:49:41] thing he's about the father's business
[1:49:43] he's going to pray and he disturbs them
[1:49:45] both of course the bull wants to charge
[1:49:47] and kill him and the Hornets start
[1:49:49] swirling around him and you know what
[1:49:50] brother brandham says he conquered them
[1:49:52] with he said he said this may sound
[1:49:54] funny this may Str sound strange you may
[1:49:57] not believe me he says I loved
[1:50:00] them and he said he apologized to them
[1:50:04] he said I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset
[1:50:07] you I didn't mean to get in your way but
[1:50:09] I'm about the father's business so go
[1:50:11] back to where you were and they went
[1:50:14] back brother ramam said when he did that
[1:50:17] the atmosphere
[1:50:20] changed see we're not going to take this
[1:50:22] carve up
[1:50:24] theologians that never got anybody
[1:50:27] anywhere but love will change
[1:50:30] them scripture says by your love one for
[1:50:33] another that's how all my men that's how
[1:50:35] men will know you're my disciples the
[1:50:36] way you can treat a person that doesn't
[1:50:38] sound very spiritual but listen if
[1:50:41] what's in this doesn't come live in this
[1:50:42] then it's not spiritual in the first
[1:50:44] place because the the real spirituality
[1:50:46] will come out inside of our day-to-day
[1:50:48] lives amen it's not by
[1:50:51] might it's by the power of love that we
[1:50:54] see these things happen humanly speaking
[1:50:57] we want to flare up they come with a
[1:50:59] sword we come with a bigger sword they
[1:51:00] come with a gun we come with a bigger
[1:51:01] gun whatever it is we come with a bigger
[1:51:04] heavier stronger but that's not the way
[1:51:07] God works our strength is not the same
[1:51:09] as theirs and our answer is not the same
[1:51:10] as theirs our weapons are not the same
[1:51:12] as theirs remember what Paul said as we
[1:51:14] start to close for though we walk in the
[1:51:17] flesh we do not war after the flesh for
[1:51:20] the weapons of our wherefor
[1:51:23] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[1:51:26] through God to the pulling down of
[1:51:30] strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:51:32] and every High thing that exalteth
[1:51:34] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:51:36] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:51:39] The Obedience of Christ people notice
[1:51:43] when we respond differently church
[1:51:45] people notice when we curb our tongues
[1:51:47] people notice when we have a different
[1:51:49] attitude or reaction than they would
[1:51:50] have and they notice it most when they
[1:51:52] know that you have a right to respond in
[1:51:55] a certain way and you lay it
[1:51:58] aside why because you're interested in
[1:52:01] Souls not in
[1:52:04] self-preservation amen pride is what
[1:52:06] causes these things to lift up if we're
[1:52:09] If we're honest pride is what causes us
[1:52:11] to flare up and humility is what causes
[1:52:14] us to put our lives aside for the sake
[1:52:16] of their soul where the mystery of God
[1:52:18] being revealed in this last age amen
[1:52:20] he's expecting more of us our battles
[1:52:23] show what kingdom we're fighting for
[1:52:26] amen going to close with a quote the
[1:52:28] musicians can
[1:52:29] come Jesus said himself we can all Stand
[1:52:32] Together Jesus said himself he that
[1:52:35] overcometh I will give him the Morning
[1:52:37] Star the Bible said that what is an
[1:52:40] overcomer an overcomer is one that's
[1:52:43] overcome the world overcome self and
[1:52:47] overcome Pride I'll make him the Morning
[1:52:50] Star what does it do I'll shine him up
[1:52:52] and set him up there that I by my
[1:52:55] oncoming power will reflect my own
[1:52:58] presence in the darkness he that
[1:53:00] overcomes will I give the Morning Star
[1:53:02] what's the Morning Star set there to
[1:53:04] reflect the sun coming he says what is
[1:53:08] the Morning Star it's the sun shining
[1:53:11] against it reflecting the presence of
[1:53:13] the coming of the sun it's the brightest
[1:53:15] thing in heaven he says the brightest
[1:53:17] thing in heaven ought to be today and is
[1:53:20] today the minister
[1:53:23] or the Christian or the Spirit-filled
[1:53:26] man that's so filled with the Holy
[1:53:29] Spirit till he's forsaken the world and
[1:53:32] everything and God is reflecting his
[1:53:34] light coming through him warning the
[1:53:37] world that the approaching s o n is at
[1:53:41] hand
[1:53:43] amen you're a written epistle seen and
[1:53:46] read of all men you're the reflection of
[1:53:49] Christ in this day because he's down
[1:53:51] personally
[1:53:53] by his Spirit but now he's coming down
[1:53:55] to gather up a bride into him and before
[1:53:58] she goes she has to be revealed as
[1:54:00] him what is it it's the bride coming of
[1:54:03] Christ it's the mystery that Paul said
[1:54:05] was hidden from the very Ages was us and
[1:54:08] Christ in US revealing the final portion
[1:54:11] of the final word to this generation
[1:54:13] then he moves on to the
[1:54:15] Jews Authority by position what do we
[1:54:18] use it for the king's business the
[1:54:22] father's business not for
[1:54:24] self-gratification
[1:54:25] notice we don't vindicate ourselves he
[1:54:29] vindicates us and he only vindicates a
[1:54:31] people that can seek and find his will
[1:54:33] and stay in his word that's what he's
[1:54:35] looking for it's simple people are
[1:54:38] wanting to push people are wanting to
[1:54:40] make things happen you can't make it
[1:54:42] happen all you can do is stay faithful
[1:54:44] with this and then God will reach out
[1:54:45] and he'll touch you here and he'll touch
[1:54:47] this one here and he'll touch this one
[1:54:49] here and it's just a little bit of God
[1:54:50] here and a little bit there but when you
[1:54:52] put it all together you see the great
[1:54:54] revealing of Christ and his people amen
[1:54:57] God hidden and revealed in Simplicity
[1:55:01] sons and daughters that have stayed with
[1:55:03] his word until he places them and gives
[1:55:06] them his word so that they'll speak and
[1:55:09] he'll back it up amen God bless you
[1:55:11] let's bow our
[1:55:12] heads Heavenly
[1:55:15] Father Lord truly as the song says Lord

[1:56:25] our faith we pray Lord help us to stay
[1:56:28] faithful Lord help us to stay in the
