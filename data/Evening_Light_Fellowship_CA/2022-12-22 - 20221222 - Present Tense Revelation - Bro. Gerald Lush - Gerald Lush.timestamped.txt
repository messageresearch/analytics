[44:32] Christmas Bells by Henry Henry Wadsworth
[44:36] Longfellow I Heard the Bells on
[44:38] Christmas Day they're all familiar
[44:40] Carol's play and wild and sweet the

[44:45] toward men and thought how as the day

[44:49] and dumb had rolled Along The Unbroken
[44:52] Song of Peace on Earth Good Will good
[44:54] men till ringing singing on its way the
[44:57] world revolved from night to day a voice
[45:00] a chime a chance Sublime of peace on
[45:02] Earth Good Will to men then from each
[45:05] black a curse and mouth a cannon
[45:07] thundered in the South and with the
[45:09] sound the carols drowned of peace on
[45:12] Earth good will join men
[45:14] it was as if an earthquake rent the
[45:16] hearthstones of the continent and made
[45:19] forlorn the households born
[45:21] of peace on Earth Good Will toward men
[45:24] and in despair I bowed my head there is
[45:26] no peace on Earth I said for hate is
[45:29] strong and mocks the song of peace on
[45:31] Earth good will for men
[45:33] then peeled the bells more loud and deep
[45:36] God is not dead nor doth he sleep
[45:38] the the wrong shall fail the right
[45:41] Prevail with peace on Earth Good Will
[45:43] toward men

[1:27:13] again in Ezekiel or Exodus rather
[1:27:15] chapter 13.
[1:27:18] and verse 17.
[1:27:26] and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let
[1:27:29] the people go that God LED them out
[1:27:32] through the way of the land of the
[1:27:34] Philistines
[1:27:35] although that was near for God said lest
[1:27:40] per Adventure the people repent when
[1:27:43] they see War
[1:27:45] and they returned to Egypt
[1:27:48] yeah not repent and get closer to God
[1:27:50] repent and get further away from God
[1:27:53] God help us
[1:27:56] but God led the people about
[1:27:58] through the way of the Wilderness of the
[1:28:00] Red Sea and the children of Israel went

[1:28:54] a pillar of Fire
[1:28:56] and to give them light

[1:40:18] deception in in denominational influence
[1:40:22] oh yeah
[1:40:24] God God went and did this God went dead
[1:40:26] there what did the enemy do the enemy

[1:40:30] to make a make a denomination out of it
[1:40:32] oh yeah and make a Creed out of the out
[1:40:35] of the Lord make a Creed out of it
[1:40:37] yeah
[1:40:39] amen yeah we believe this we believe
[1:40:42] this we believe that and that was it
[1:40:44] that was a period
[1:40:45] oh yeah and then when God would come
[1:40:48] back and reveal more of the word to them
[1:40:50] they wouldn't believe it
[1:40:51] now after three or four generations amen
[1:40:54] most of them just believe what what God
[1:40:57] what God had done originally in the in
[1:40:59] their in their first Revival and so on
[1:41:01] whether it's the Lutheran Revival the
[1:41:03] Methodist Revival or even the
[1:41:04] Pentecostal Revival and unfortunately
[1:41:07] now among among so-called message
[1:41:09] revivals yeah

[1:41:31] increase it they won't let God come in
[1:41:33] amen and give them greater and greater
[1:41:35] and greater Revelation understanding of
[1:41:38] what he gave you when you started
[1:41:40] yeah
[1:41:41] you we need it yes sure because when
[1:41:44] when Martin Luther started with
[1:41:46] justification and God would God would
[1:41:48] move on and God wanted to reveal
[1:41:50] sanctification
[1:41:52] no no because they denominated
[1:41:55] and they were and they there's very few
[1:41:58] of them would believe few did believe
[1:41:59] and went on with with John Wesley in
[1:42:02] sanctification and they of course we
[1:42:04] know again after the third generation
[1:42:05] they organized and when the god came
[1:42:08] with the Pentecostals amen and The
[1:42:10] Bachelors of the Holy Ghost the gifts of
[1:42:12] the Spirit amen so there was a few there
[1:42:14] that believed that and they would go on
[1:42:16] with the Pentecostal Revival amen but
[1:42:19] now brother we're moving beyond that
[1:42:22] because the Pentecostal Revival was over
[1:42:24] 100 years ago
[1:42:26] amen but now for the last
[1:42:29] maybe 50 60 years whatever God has God
[1:42:32] has revealed his word what for because
[1:42:35] brother
[1:42:36] the word that heard the word that he
[1:42:38] gave the Lutheran them it gave them the
[1:42:40] faith that God wanted them to have in
[1:42:41] justification the word that he gave
[1:42:43] Wesley gave them sanctification and the
[1:42:46] word that he gave them under the
[1:42:47] Pentecostals gave them the baptism of
[1:42:49] the Holy Ghost that gives of the spirit

[1:57:06] we're dealing with eternity
[1:57:09] and brother it's difficult sometimes
[1:57:11] just to break to take what's in eternity
[1:57:13] to bring it down into time
[1:57:16] but by the grace of God Billy Endeavor
[1:57:18] to do it amen

[1:57:42] control
[1:57:43] by grace
[1:57:45] in your thoughts in your words and your
[1:57:48] Deeds eternity is controlling amen Grace
[1:57:55] in verse 11 again in chapter 14 of
[1:57:58] Exodus and they said unto Moses because
[1:58:01] there were no graves in Egypt as thou
[1:58:04] taken us away to die in the wilderness
[1:58:06] wherefore as thou dealt with thus with
[1:58:09] us to carry us forth out of Egypt amen
[1:58:14] and brothers sometimes people want
[1:58:16] denomination and the benefits of a
[1:58:19] denomination natural rather than come
[1:58:21] out of the nomination into a
[1:58:24] non-denominational church
[1:58:26] yeah they want they want the more the
[1:58:29] assurance and of the nomination than a
[1:58:33] non-denominational building or church
[1:58:35] or group
[1:58:37] Grace to us
[1:58:39] amen
[1:58:41] oh yes there's a price
[1:58:43] one of these days they're going to put
[1:58:45] the pressure
[1:58:48] yeah that we'd have to what
[1:58:50] non-denominational groups would have to
[1:58:53] identify with a denomination
[1:58:57] or that hour is coming
[1:59:00] oh yeah
[1:59:01] you certain sure yes and I believe that
[1:59:05] that there's many non-denominational
[1:59:06] groups out there they will humble
[1:59:08] themselves and become identified with
[1:59:10] this church or that church or this
[1:59:11] denomination or that now oh yeah
[1:59:14] you won't be non-denominational
[1:59:17] no no they won't they won't allow that
[1:59:19] they wouldn't want that
[1:59:21] but are we going to stay
[1:59:23] with that faith
[1:59:25] by the grace of God
[1:59:28] that's why he eventually whether God's
[1:59:30] going to Rapture the bride but those
[1:59:33] there's going to be many that are going
[1:59:34] to be left behind and they're going to
[1:59:36] lay down their lives
[1:59:38] yeah
[1:59:40] because they won't identify with
[1:59:42] organized religion
[1:59:44] they want so God help us
[1:59:47] amen
[1:59:49] so he's not this the word that we did
[1:59:52] tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone
[1:59:54] that we may serve the Egyptians for it
[1:59:57] had been better for us to serve the
[1:59:59] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[2:00:02] wilderness no
[2:00:04] brother
[2:00:05] but God let him die in the wilderness
[2:00:07] they paid the price because of their
[2:00:10] lack of faith to go on to move on to the
[2:00:13] promised land
[2:00:14] God help us keep going
[2:00:17] amen
[2:00:19] don't feel like we got we got to
[2:00:21] identify with this and identify no way
[2:00:23] stay with the word
[2:00:25] amen
[2:00:26] by the grace of God
[2:00:29] and he said and Moses said unto the
[2:00:31] people fear ye not stand still and see
[2:00:35] the salvation of the Lord amen
[2:00:39] oh to them
[2:00:40] they were oh it was tremendous test of
[2:00:43] their faith and God brought it out
[2:00:45] their lack of faith
[2:00:48] amen but Joshua and Caleb oh they had
[2:00:51] the faith to keep on going and they and
[2:00:54] they waited for another generation
[2:00:56] to rise up
[2:00:58] a third generation that would believe
[2:01:00] and go into the Promised Land
[2:01:04] but this generation that came out of
[2:01:06] Egypt
[2:01:06] they died
[2:01:08] in the wilderness
[2:01:10] God help us
[2:01:18] of all that has come out of denomination
[2:01:20] of Egyptian bondage how many have died
[2:01:24] because of unbelief not all
[2:01:27] but some
[2:01:29] yes
[2:01:31] God help us
[2:01:35] as I said that one time when I was
[2:01:37] preaching in a church
[2:01:38] in central Newfoundland and the the
[2:01:40] whole
[2:01:42] audience was there
[2:01:44] and there might have been two or three
[2:01:45] hundred people in the in the audience
[2:01:48] and as I said we had a altar call
[2:01:51] and
[2:01:53] now I I didn't preach there but there's
[2:01:56] another idea I have preached there but
[2:01:58] not at that time it was the pastor
[2:02:00] really that was preaching and after then
[2:02:02] he turned it over to me and we were
[2:02:04] having a altar call and so on and as I
[2:02:08] said they all came this these few came
[2:02:10] up this one came up that one came up and
[2:02:12] finally as I said I noticed there was
[2:02:15] two sisters there and they were they
[2:02:18] were
[2:02:19] they weren't their young or teenagers or
[2:02:21] anything but they might have been in
[2:02:23] their 30s and I remember when we were
[2:02:27] singing and worshiping and I looked down
[2:02:28] and I said Lord I said
[2:02:31] they're not believers
[2:02:33] I said they don't have the Holy Spirit
[2:02:37] you know they yet they were they were
[2:02:38] worshiping but there's just something
[2:02:40] about it that I noticed that there was a
[2:02:42] different Spirit on them and around them
[2:02:45] you know
[2:02:46] and they weren't
[2:02:48] because later they went back into the
[2:02:50] world
[2:02:51] yeah
[2:02:52] yes
[2:02:54] so brother we better make our calling
[2:02:56] and our election sure
[2:02:58] by the grace of God
[2:02:59] that we're not going to die in the
[2:03:01] wilderness not by any means
[2:03:04] whether it might be a spiritual
[2:03:06] Wilderness but don't don't die under
[2:03:08] spiritual Wilderness I pray Grace the
[2:03:10] brother of Dead deaths were to take you
[2:03:11] there you go you're going into Glory
[2:03:13] amen by the grace of God
[2:03:16] amen
[2:03:23] and this generation that died in the
[2:03:25] wilderness rebuked
[2:03:27] Joshua rebuking Moses for work doing
[2:03:30] what they did and Moses said unto the
[2:03:33] people fear ye not
[2:03:35] stand still and see the salvation of the
[2:03:38] Lord
[2:03:39] don't fear
[2:03:41] what's coming what's going
[2:03:43] stand still and see the resurrection and
[2:03:45] the rapture
[2:03:47] amen
[2:03:48] don't let the enemy bring in the butts
[2:03:51] to you amen
[2:03:53] leave the butts to the goats amen
[2:03:56] brother
[2:03:58] you know what the oh
[2:04:00] you know what they use the goats for how
[2:04:03] are the goats related to the Sheep
[2:04:07] the goats were used
[2:04:09] to go up the path
[2:04:12] into into a certain place that where
[2:04:14] they want to get the Sheep to slaughter
[2:04:15] the Sheep
[2:04:17] so the Sheep would know ordinarily go up
[2:04:19] so what they did was they would put the
[2:04:20] goats there and the goats would walk up
[2:04:23] amen and the Sheep would follow the
[2:04:26] goats and when it got to the top the
[2:04:29] goats would jump off
[2:04:31] and go and and and and go down but the
[2:04:34] Sheep would keep on going to the
[2:04:36] slaughter
[2:04:37] yeah
[2:04:38] so
[2:04:40] they should make sure we're not led by
[2:04:42] goats
[2:04:44] amen that we are sheep
[2:04:47] amen
[2:04:51] again verse 13 and Moses said unto the
[2:04:54] people fear ye not
[2:04:55] stand still and see the salvation of the
[2:04:58] Lord
[2:04:59] stand still and see the resurrection
[2:05:03] stand still and see the rapture
[2:05:06] brother we were dead and now oh yes
[2:05:10] we're now we're alive
[2:05:11] you have you quickened who were dead in
[2:05:15] sin and trespasses
[2:05:16] he has made you alive and not only that
[2:05:19] he's raptured us
[2:05:22] hello
[2:05:24] I was preaching that in a certain church
[2:05:26] one time that I've been raptured
[2:05:30] I said I've been resurrected
[2:05:34] I've been raptured
[2:05:35] and as I said the Pastor was turned
[2:05:37] around to his audience
[2:05:39] and he was shaking his head
[2:05:42] no no
[2:05:44] he didn't agree with it
[2:05:46] I said Lord
[2:05:47] I thought for sure he would believe that
[2:05:50] that we had been resurrected and we have
[2:05:52] been raptured
[2:05:54] and he was shaking his head to his
[2:05:55] congregation no no don't don't respond
[2:05:57] to that it's not right
[2:06:00] and so I the Lord led me to the
[2:06:02] scripture
[2:06:04] and it shocked him
[2:06:08] why I said I want to show you I have
[2:06:11] been resurrected have you I'll tell you
[2:06:14] if you haven't been resurrected now you
[2:06:17] will never experience Resurrection
[2:06:19] in the in the time of the rapture
[2:06:25] you've got to have it now
[2:06:28] and not only that you got to have the
[2:06:30] right you got to have rapturing faith
[2:06:32] now yeah
[2:06:34] Resurrection fee Glory
[2:06:37] so I went to the scripture
[2:06:39] and I said I want to prove to you I've
[2:06:41] been resurrected and I've been raptured
[2:06:43] I said what about your faith
[2:06:45] amen
[2:06:48] because have I been resurrected
[2:06:49] spiritually and raptured spiritually
[2:06:51] I'll be resurrected and raptured
[2:06:52] physically
[2:06:57] Ephesians 2.
[2:07:00] and you hathy quickened
[2:07:04] what does that mean resurrected Made

[2:07:49] power of the air the spirit that now
[2:07:52] worketh in the children of disobedience
[2:07:55] amen and then he went on down and says
[2:07:58] even when we were dead
[2:08:00] in sins

[2:14:15] raptured I've already been resurrected
[2:14:17] Satan and I've always been raptured and
[2:14:19] I've been caught up into a Heavenly
[2:14:21] place in our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14:23] amen
[2:14:25] I trust that you've got the experience
[2:14:27] of a resurrection and you've got the
[2:14:29] experience of a Rapture in your life

[2:14:48] he said now he said we got quite a
[2:14:50] subject on why Christ speak
[2:14:53] as God said to Moses why are you crying
[2:14:55] to me speak the word
[2:14:59] and he said I'll try he said
[2:15:03] I want he said to do this as they felt
[2:15:06] the Holy Spirit would lead him leading
[2:15:07] him to minister on why Christ speak
[2:15:11] and he said to this text of Moses crying
[2:15:13] out to God in the time of trouble and
[2:15:16] God rebuking Moses back
[2:15:19] right when trouble was in session
[2:15:22] amen
[2:15:23] God rebuked Moses the way you're crying
[2:15:25] to me for speak the word
[2:15:28] yeah
[2:15:29] Moses what's wrong
[2:15:33] God was questioning Moses faith
[2:15:35] is God questioning your faith
[2:15:40] when you experience this and you
[2:15:41] experience that and you cry under the
[2:15:43] Lord cry cry cry speak
[2:15:46] the word he said I'll never leave you
[2:15:48] I'll never forsake you he shall be with
[2:15:51] you even in you to the end of the age
[2:15:53] amen
[2:15:55] speak the word
[2:15:58] don't just worry about the devil don't
[2:16:01] let the devil hit you and put you down
[2:16:03] you get down oh oh no
[2:16:05] oh
[2:16:07] no Satan get behind me in the name of
[2:16:11] the Lord Jesus Christ Amen Brother Where
[2:16:15] where's our faith in Jesus
[2:16:17] where's our faith in the name of the
[2:16:20] Lord Jesus Christ because Christ
[2:16:22] reminded us anything you ask the father
[2:16:23] in my name he will do it
[2:16:26] what
[2:16:29] Lord please forgive us of our unbelief
[2:16:33] forgive us of our sin
[2:16:36] and brother the greatest sin that God
[2:16:38] sees is unbelief
[2:16:40] God help us amen
[2:16:45] and he said God rebuke him Moses right
[2:16:48] when trouble was in session and it's
[2:16:50] just nature seeming like for a person to
[2:16:53] cry out and then he said well what a
[2:16:55] rebuke it is for God he said to turn
[2:16:58] around and rebuke him for saying for
[2:17:01] crying out to him God rebuked him and he
[2:17:04] said it looks like it's a very hard
[2:17:06] thing and many times when we look at the
[2:17:09] scriptures in our own way of looking at
[2:17:11] it it seems very hard but if we study a
[2:17:14] little while we find out that the
[2:17:17] all-wise God knows just what he's doing
[2:17:19] amen he knows
[2:17:24] and he knows how to do these things and
[2:17:27] how to deal with man he knows what's in
[2:17:30] man amen
[2:17:32] now he said we don't but God does
[2:17:35] and he said we only know from the
[2:17:36] intellectual side
[2:17:39] but God knows what's really in the man
[2:17:43] we judge things intellectually but God
[2:17:46] judges things spiritually from the soul
[2:17:49] amen
[2:17:51] God looks at you oh the works
[2:17:54] oh man judges you by your works but
[2:17:57] God's going to go into your soul
[2:17:59] Amen to judge the spirit that controls
[2:18:02] you
[2:18:05] amen
[2:18:06] so be careful
[2:18:09] don't don't judge and condemn your
[2:18:11] brother your sister oh this one or that
[2:18:13] one oh you do this you did that or you
[2:18:16] said this you said that no just leave it
[2:18:19] and commit him to the Lord and pray for
[2:18:21] them
[2:18:22] yeah
[2:18:23] pray for them
[2:18:25] grace of God
[2:18:28] remember he said God knows what is in a
[2:18:30] man he knows we don't we only know from
[2:18:34] the United intellectual side but he
[2:18:37] knows what's really in the man
[2:18:39] because Moses was born in this world as
[2:18:42] a gifted boy and he was born a prophet
[2:18:44] he was born a deliverer and he was born
[2:18:47] with equipment born in him as every man
[2:18:51] that comes into the world is born with
[2:18:53] this equipment as I firmly believe in
[2:18:55] the foreknowledge of God the
[2:18:57] predestination not that God is willing
[2:18:59] that any should perish but that all will
[2:19:02] come to repentance
[2:19:04] being being God he had to know and does
[2:19:08] know the end from the beginning amen he
[2:19:11] wasn't willing certainly that Eddie
[2:19:13] should perish but he knowing who would
[2:19:16] perish and who would not perish that's
[2:19:19] right
[2:19:20] God knows here tonight Who's going to
[2:19:23] make it in the resurrection and Rapture
[2:19:25] and who's going to miss it
[2:19:30] you'll confirm your faith
[2:19:33] by responding
[2:19:35] to give him your strength and your
[2:19:37] encouragement he'll be there
[2:19:40] to help you move on
[2:19:43] amen amen
[2:19:48] he said listen
[2:19:50] he knew who would be who wouldn't perish
[2:19:52] and who would not perish and he said
[2:19:54] that's the very purpose that Jesus came
[2:19:57] to the Earth was to save those that God
[2:20:00] through is for knowledge amen sin
[2:20:04] that wanted to be saved do you want to
[2:20:07] be safe
[2:20:08] in your heart in your soul
[2:20:11] not just your flesh but your heart and
[2:20:13] soul
[2:20:16] do you want to be resurrected do you
[2:20:18] want to be raptured
[2:20:21] well brother I'll tell you
[2:20:23] if you were
[2:20:24] got the nature of God in you through the
[2:20:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost you want to be
[2:20:28] resurrected and you want to be raptured
[2:20:31] amen you most definitely want to get out
[2:20:34] of this whole world
[2:20:36] for the glory of God
[2:20:40] got up our young brothers and sisters
[2:20:43] that are here tonight God bless you
[2:20:45] please in the name of Jesus sir and I
[2:20:48] pray that they'll seriously consider
[2:20:53] the plan purpose and pattern of God
[2:20:58] that there's a reason for it
[2:21:00] so I pray God help our young brothers
[2:21:02] and young sisters amen that they're not
[2:21:04] try to consider it and understand it
[2:21:07] intellectually
[2:21:08] but pray God speaks with them in their
[2:21:10] hearts
[2:21:11] and give them a revelation
[2:21:13] yes and understand this that as you get
[2:21:15] older the Lord willing Lord tarries amen
[2:21:19] that he he's going to give you a greater
[2:21:21] and a greater and a greater revelation
[2:21:22] of what he has done and what he is doing
[2:21:27] and what he will do
[2:21:32] offense in just a moment
[2:21:37] he said listen
[2:21:41] he said no man
[2:21:43] can have his sins recovered unless his
[2:21:46] name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:21:48] before the foundation of the world thank
[2:21:51] you Jesus thank God Amen
[2:21:55] he said Moses was born with a gift of
[2:21:58] faith
[2:21:59] a great faith Moses had and we see it
[2:22:02] after a while he said coming out in him
[2:22:04] hey
[2:22:06] amen
[2:22:08] he was strictly Moses was strictly a
[2:22:11] type of the Lord Jesus amen all right
[2:22:15] so Grace brother sister that we have
[2:22:17] that faith that pleases God
[2:22:20] amen
[2:22:25] and again why Christ speak what's the
[2:22:28] end what's the highlighting he's
[2:22:29] highlighting faith
[2:22:31] because Faith speaks the word faith
[2:22:34] speaks the will of God Amen
[2:22:39] he said listen
[2:22:42] a man asked me a few moments ago about
[2:22:46] the coming
[2:22:47] and the rapture he said we know we've
[2:22:50] lived the time out the time of the
[2:22:53] Rapture is at hand and we have we are
[2:22:57] looking for a rapturing faith that can
[2:22:59] pull the churches together and give it
[2:23:01] some Supernatural strength that can
[2:23:04] change these bodies that we live in amen
[2:23:08] we see a God that can raise the dead off
[2:23:10] the floor or out in the yard and bring
[2:23:13] him back to life again and present him
[2:23:16] before us when we see a God who can take
[2:23:19] a cancer that's eat a man to a shadow
[2:23:22] and raise him up to a strong healthy man
[2:23:24] that ought to give us rapturing Faith
[2:23:27] amen
[2:23:29] he said that when that light he said
[2:23:31] flashes from the sky and the trumpet
[2:23:34] sounds and the body of Christ will be
[2:23:36] quickly gathered together and changed in
[2:23:38] a moment and taken into the heavens
[2:23:41] listen you've got to meet the light
[2:23:45] amen
[2:23:46] you've got to find that light amen
[2:23:50] Grace Grace for that anointing
[2:23:53] of the resurrection and the rapture
[2:23:55] amen
[2:23:57] Lord
[2:23:59] there's the anointing for the for the
[2:24:01] gifts but now they're experiencing the
[2:24:03] anointing for the resurrection and the
[2:24:05] rapture
[2:24:06] Amen to get us out of time and to get us
[2:24:09] into eternity Grace to give us that
[2:24:12] faith that pleases God
[2:24:14] amen
[2:24:16] again
[2:24:19] understand this
[2:24:23] the faith that pleases God
[2:24:25] oh well
[2:24:27] the disciples at it
[2:24:29] Luther at it Wesley at it Pentecostals
[2:24:33] at it yeah
[2:24:35] but what was it what was the faith that
[2:24:37] they had
[2:24:38] that pleased God
[2:24:41] for Luther it was justification
[2:24:44] Leslie sanctification
[2:24:48] the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy
[2:24:49] Ghost the gifts of the Spirit
[2:24:52] they had that faith and they went forth
[2:24:55] oh yeah the Pentecostals were living
[2:24:57] living for the gifts
[2:24:59] the baptism the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[2:25:01] of the Spirit morning noon and night
[2:25:04] they were going around the world
[2:25:05] with the with the revelation of the
[2:25:08] Revival but what God had done and what
[2:25:11] God was doing what was it that God in
[2:25:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost it was God
[2:25:16] in the restoration of the gifts in the
[2:25:18] restoration of the anointing and so on
[2:25:20] what God was doing in their lives amen
[2:25:23] Grace healing signs wonders yeah
[2:25:30] yeah
[2:25:32] and that's why that's why the Lord
[2:25:34] warned us in the word
[2:25:36] that they're gonna there's gonna be a
[2:25:38] deception
[2:25:39] yeah because the enemy is always there
[2:25:42] to to imitate what God's doing
[2:25:44] whether it's justification
[2:25:46] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[2:25:49] Ghost the gifts of the Spirit amen the
[2:25:51] enemy was there to impersonate it and
[2:25:53] use
[2:25:54] false
[2:25:55] anointed ones
[2:25:57] yeah
[2:25:58] Grace
[2:25:59] but why
[2:26:01] the prophet of God said the anointing
[2:26:02] was real but their teaching wasn't
[2:26:05] he said they had a false teaching
[2:26:08] or they'll say oh yeah I believe this I
[2:26:10] believe that then they'll add this and
[2:26:11] add that or take away this and take away
[2:26:13] that God help us
[2:26:15] stay with the word of God
[2:26:18] look up
