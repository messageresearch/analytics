[35:18] is leading.
[35:22] [music]
[35:22] Each step
[35:25] I'll climb up the mountain.
[35:28] And I'll climb up [singing] the
[35:31] mountain.
[35:34] [music] the valley over.
[35:39] Yes, Amen. [music]
[35:41] Though clouds overshadow
[35:47] will tell of the cross. [music]
[35:53] My spirit [music] cries onward
[35:59] till [music] Jesus shall say
[36:06] you followed my foot
[36:09] friends.
[36:11] Amen. Step the way.
[36:15] [music]
[36:18] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[36:23] I want God's way to be my way.
[36:26] 131.
[36:32] Amen.
[36:34] [clears throat] As I journey here below,
[36:38] there's no other highway that a child of
[36:40] God should go. Amen.
[36:45] I want God's way to [music] be my way.
[36:51] As I journey here below, let's stand.
[36:55] [music]
[36:56] There's no other highway
[36:59] [singing and music] that a child of God
[37:02] should go.
[37:04] Though the way, [music]
[37:06] Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; If he leaves me, it's [singing] enough.
[37:12] I want God's way to be my [music] way
[37:17] every day. Praise the Lord. And I want
[37:22] God's way to be [music] my way as I

[37:39] Though the road is [music and singing]
[37:41] steep and rough, it feels me, it's
[37:46] enough. Amen. I want God's way
[37:49] [music and singing]
[37:50] to be my way. Hallelujah. One more time.
[37:54] Let's sing it. And [music] I want God's
[37:58] way. God bless you. Amen. as a journey
[38:02] [music]
[38:03] and hope for there [singing] is no other
[38:08] highway [music] that a child of God
[38:12] should go.
[38:14] Though the road [singing] be steep and
[38:17] rough, [music]
[38:18] if he leads me, it's enough where I want
[38:23] God's [music and singing]
[38:24] way to be my way every day.
[38:30] Amen. Let's bow our heads, [music] Lord
[38:31] Jesus.
[38:34] Lord, we've come in tonight, Lord, to
[38:36] hear your word. Lord, we've come in to
[38:39] worship and praise you. We've come in to
[38:41] thank you for your goodness and grace,
[38:42] heavenly father. Lord, we always want to
[38:44] come in with a thankful heart. Lord, if
[38:47] for nothing else than that you've called
[38:48] us out of what we were into what you
[38:51] called us to be, Lord, as your sons and
[38:53] daughters of God. So, Lord, we're with
[38:55] thankful hearts tonight, Lord, [music]
[38:56] just acknowledging your goodness and
[38:58] grace. Lord, we're thankful for your
[39:00] presence amongst us, Lord. Just praying
[39:02] that you would be with us this night,
[39:04] Lord. That you would just minister to
[39:05] your flock, Lord. That your bride would
[39:07] be encouraged this evening, [music]
[39:08] Lord. That we would continue to gather
[39:10] strength from your word and your
[39:12] presence, each one. Heavenly Father,
[39:13] remembering those that aren't here,
[39:15] Lord. Remembering Sister Becky,
[39:16] especially, Lord, that you would just
[39:18] minister to her, touch her body, Lord
[39:19] God, we pray, Lord, thanking you for the
[39:22] answered prayer, Lord, that allowed
[39:23] Brother Paul and Sister Kimberly to come
[39:25] tonight, heavenly father. Lord, that's
[39:27] standing our ground, Lord. And we're so
[39:30] thankful, Lord, that you back your word
[39:31] up, [music] Lord. Just bless us each one
[39:33] now. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[39:35] ask it. Amen. [music] Amen. God bless
[39:37] you. Turn if you would to Isaiah chapter
[39:39] 59 tonight. Good to see each one back.
[39:42] [music] I think Brother Chad thought it
[39:43] was a Sunday. He's all dressed up. He He
[39:46] I hope it's okay to say it's Brother
[39:48] Chad. He messaged me before service and
[39:49] he said, "Hey, is your power out?" I
[39:51] said, "No, we lost it uh Monday for
[39:53] about an hour and a half. We lost it for
[39:54] about 20 minutes this morning." He said,
[39:56] "Well, I'm getting dressed in the dark
[39:57] here." So, I said, "I'll be interested
[39:59] to see the combination." But he decided
[40:00] to forego any possibility that it could
[40:03] be weird by just dressing in a suit and
[40:04] tie and everything. So, uh, well played.
[40:07] Well played. Amen. Good to see each one
[40:08] here. I, um, Brother Aaron and Sister
[40:11] Lydia actually didn't leave until
[40:12] yesterday, uh, about 6:15 and, uh, their
[40:16] flight got cancelled because of all the
[40:17] winds that were coming in and they they
[40:19] just were proactively cancelled. So,
[40:21] they stuck around for an extra two days
[40:23] almost. But uh they just got home about
[40:25] 2 hours ago. So we thank the Lord for
[40:27] that that he worked that out. And
[40:29] certainly wonderful to see brother Paul
[40:30] and Sister Kimberly here tonight. Amen.
[40:33] I thought that was just beautiful.
[40:34] Really in line with what they're doing
[40:36] is what I'm going to be preaching on
[40:37] here tonight on holding the line. But
[40:40] Amen. I believe that's what God's called
[40:41] us to do. Amen. Hold the line. Amen. To
[40:44] to take him at his word and stand up
[40:46] when Satan tries to hold us back from
[40:48] the things that God has called us to and
[40:49] the blessings that God has given us.
[40:52] Amen. Let's read this in Isaiah 59. Good
[40:54] to see sister Darlene with us still.
[40:56] Amen. Always wonderful to have her with
[40:58] us. It says this. Isaiah 59:19. So shall
[41:01] they fear the name of the Lord from the
[41:03] west and his glory from the rising of
[41:05] the sun. When the enemy shall come in
[41:07] like a flood, the spirit of the Lord
[41:09] shall lift up a standard against him.
[41:12] And the redeemer shall come to Zion.
[41:14] Who's Zion? That's us. That's the bride.
[41:17] The the redeemer shall come to the
[41:18] bride. Maybe we could say it that way.
[41:20] and unto them that turn from
[41:21] transgression in Jacob, sayeth the Lord.
[41:24] As for me, this is my covenant with
[41:26] them, sayeth the Lord, my spirit that is
[41:28] upon thee, and my words which I have put
[41:31] in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy
[41:33] mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed,
[41:36] nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed,
[41:38] saith the Lord, from henceforth and
[41:41] forever. Amen. God bless you. You can
[41:42] have your seats this evening. Amen.
[41:45] Before we get going here this evening, I
[41:47] just wanted to thank each one of you for
[41:49] your support of the meetings this week
[41:51] and your hard work and your commitment
[41:52] to coming. Brother Garfield was not able
[41:55] to make it Friday night, but he worked
[41:56] all the way through Friday, came into
[41:58] the fellowship on Saturday morning, went
[42:01] home, caught a few hours of sleep, and
[42:02] then came to service and then went to
[42:04] work and then came to service the next
[42:06] morning. That's commitment. So, God
[42:08] bless you for that, Brother Garfield. I
[42:10] think I think you got a blessing this
[42:11] weekend. Pretty sure he did. Amen. I
[42:14] thought he was going to take off running
[42:15] multiple times, but you know, it's you.
[42:19] We've got to give.
[42:22] We want to receive, but sometimes we've
[42:24] got to give so that he knows that we're
[42:26] serious about receiving. Amen. And I
[42:28] just appreciated each one that was
[42:29] there. You know, it was uh uh wonderful
[42:32] to see that it wasn't just Sister Moren
[42:34] and Sister Priscilla playing. We had
[42:35] Sister Lydia and we had Brother Levi
[42:37] playing for the specials and they're
[42:39] just doing wonderfully with that. And
[42:41] Sister Becky even playing for herself.
[42:43] And and I didn't know this, but she
[42:44] says, "I get so nervous when I went up."
[42:46] And she just said, "Lord, I'm committing
[42:47] it into your hands." And she did a
[42:49] wonderful job, and it just seemed like
[42:50] the the specials were in line with the
[42:52] services and just everything just flowed
[42:54] together so smoothly. The food was
[42:56] wonderful. Sister Amber, we've really
[42:57] put her through the ringer the last
[42:59] couple like six weeks. I think we've had
[43:01] three fellowships in that time. So,
[43:03] she's done a tremendous job with that.
[43:05] And I just wanted to thank each one of
[43:06] you. This doesn't happen except a body
[43:08] works together. And I appreciate that
[43:10] for each one of you doing that. Now,
[43:12] tonight I want to take a title of Hold
[43:15] the Line. Amen. And just as a transition
[43:17] away from our our our weekend services,
[43:19] and I've always said the hardest service
[43:21] to preach is the one after you've had
[43:23] weekend uh special meetings like we did.
[43:26] And you know, the people are usually
[43:27] under such a great atmosphere of
[43:28] expectation. You think, well, it would
[43:30] be easy, but it's just me up here,
[43:32] [laughter]
[43:33] you know, and I'm not I'm not the
[43:35] visiting evangelist or preacher,
[43:36] whatever it might be. But you know, as I
[43:39] was as I was just starting to study on
[43:41] Monday night and I I was just praying to
[43:43] the Lord and I said, "Lord, listen,
[43:44] every service doesn't have to be like
[43:47] those services." Amen. We've got to have
[43:49] different services. You look at Brother
[43:50] Bam. He says, "We've got to have
[43:52] services where it's somber and we're
[43:54] repenting and we're crying and we've got
[43:56] services where we're encouraged and
[43:58] services where we're corrected and and
[44:00] you've got ones that lift you up and you
[44:01] got ones that kind of tear you down,
[44:03] too." So I I said, 'Lord, we don't have
[44:06] to have those kinds of services all the
[44:07] time. I understand that. But I said,
[44:09] 'Lord, I believe every service can be
[44:11] just as powerful
[44:13] because what is powerful is not the
[44:15] minister. What is powerful is when the
[44:16] Holy Spirit speaks and the people
[44:19] receive it and the word starts going to
[44:21] work by the Holy Spirit moving. Amen.
[44:24] That's what makes a service great is not
[44:26] the feelings that come out of the
[44:27] service. It's the true change that comes
[44:30] out of those services. Amen. So that
[44:32] means the real preacher has to be the
[44:33] Holy Spirit. It can't just be brother
[44:36] Aaron. It can't just be me. It can't be
[44:37] just Brother Garfield. But the Holy
[44:39] Spirit has to be the one speaking. And
[44:41] so I liked what brother Aaron said. He
[44:43] said, you know, we get out what we put
[44:44] in. And having done the hard work of
[44:47] getting here. Let's not fall asleep.
[44:49] Amen. Let's let's get out of it
[44:51] everything that we can get. And you
[44:53] know, I was just dwelling on the
[44:54] services this weekend and what an
[44:56] enjoyable time it was. But you know, it
[44:58] always comes to this thing, and that's
[44:59] that the battle really starts now. Amen.
[45:02] It's easy to have a wonderful time in
[45:04] church. I don't know if anybody's had a
[45:05] trial since since the the services and
[45:07] fellowship ended on Sunday. See, look,
[45:09] six of us are already getting hammered.
[45:11] Seven, eight. Yeah. See, it's it's going
[45:13] all around. It's catching, right?
[45:14] Because the battle starts as soon as you
[45:16] walk out those doors. as soon as you
[45:18] walk out from the atmosphere of a bunch
[45:20] of people filled with the Holy Ghost and
[45:22] it's just you in a dark world where
[45:25] oppression's trying to push in. And so
[45:27] the battle starts then or the battle
[45:29] starts now to keep your testimony. And
[45:31] I'll tell you this, if you didn't know
[45:32] it, Satan's not going to be sitting back
[45:34] and just letting you go away. Satan's
[45:36] going to be coming after you trying to
[45:37] take back what what the ground that he's
[45:40] lost. And you know, I was talking to a
[45:41] brother recently. He said, "Seems like a
[45:43] lot of preachers are preaching on on
[45:45] overcoming and and battles and the armor
[45:47] of the Lord and and all these different
[45:49] things and just like I have been in our
[45:51] Sunday service." And I believe that's
[45:52] the Holy Spirit moving because he knows
[45:54] we're in for a battle. Amen. We're in
[45:56] for tough times. But what are what is
[45:58] what is he trying to prepare us for?
[46:01] He's not just trying to prepare us for
[46:02] the battle. He's trying to prepare us
[46:04] for victory. Amen. To set an expectation
[46:06] that we're going to win this. But you
[46:08] can't have victory without a battle. And
[46:10] I believe the Holy Spirit has been
[46:12] reinforcing things that we know, things
[46:14] that we've been taught, things that
[46:16] we've heard over the pulpit and these
[46:18] things to to bring us to a place where
[46:20] we can hold the line, where we won't
[46:22] fall back when the enemy comes in like a
[46:24] flood. And we know that we read the
[46:26] scripture that it says when the enemy
[46:27] comes in like the flood, the Holy Spirit
[46:29] raises a standard. And I don't have the
[46:31] quote here, but it's one of my favorite
[46:32] one. And brother Bram says, "What is the
[46:34] the raising of the standard?" He says it
[46:37] is pouring in more of himself. That's
[46:40] what's going to hold the line. Amen. We
[46:42] don't think so much about this term hold
[46:44] the line. I was talking to brother Aaron
[46:45] just before he left and I said, "I'm I'm
[46:47] going to be preaching on hold the line."
[46:49] He says, "I've preached that service a
[46:50] number of times." He says, "And I always
[46:52] preach it from the Battle of the Bulge
[46:53] and he started telling me a bunch of
[46:55] things about it, but but holding the
[46:56] line doesn't really have much meaning to
[46:58] us anymore because we fight war so
[47:00] differently now. I I mean when they're,
[47:02] you know, doing uh remotely operated
[47:05] drones over the the Middle East or in
[47:07] Afghanistan, the operators are in a
[47:09] little uh windowless um building in
[47:11] Nevada in the United States. Like we
[47:13] don't have lines of men anymore. We
[47:15] don't we don't do it the way they used
[47:17] to do it. But, you know, back in the old
[47:19] days and certainly back in, you know,
[47:21] Jesus time all the way up to the Civil
[47:24] War that that that they they they'd
[47:26] always go and they'd face each other
[47:28] directly and you had a line of men on
[47:30] this side and you had a line of men on
[47:32] that side and and and and you'd have
[47:33] rows of men together that would form an
[47:35] army and they'd come together and and
[47:37] they they'd offer a continuous line of
[47:39] resistance to the other side. And the
[47:41] idea was that you would hold your line
[47:43] and force them to break theirs. And
[47:45] that's how you would win the battle.
[47:46] Because if you broke the line now, they
[47:48] could come in, they could turn you, they
[47:49] could get around you, and they could
[47:51] attack you from all sides, and you would
[47:52] typically lose. But I I like to read
[47:55] about uh when I have time to read, when
[47:57] I'm not studying for these things, I
[47:59] like to read about history. And I love
[48:00] historical fiction. I've been reading a
[48:02] lot about the Greeks lately, and they
[48:04] have one group of people that that could
[48:07] almost never be defeated, and they were
[48:09] called the Spartans. And it's hard to
[48:11] find pictures of them because they
[48:13] didn't have cameras back then. But this
[48:14] is a depiction from a movie, I guess, of
[48:16] what it looked like. And they were known
[48:18] because they had these red cloaks and
[48:21] they had their armor and they had their
[48:23] shields and their weapons. They didn't
[48:24] have any other real clothing with them.
[48:26] But they went into battle with only the
[48:27] bare necessities and they formed what
[48:29] was called a felank. And and what that
[48:31] is is it was shields on every side and
[48:34] weapons facing on every side. And and uh
[48:37] so what would happen is when they came
[48:38] into battle is they would lock shields
[48:41] and they would square up their shoulders
[48:42] to each other and each one would
[48:44] reinforce the one next to them and then
[48:46] they'd have these long spears. And what
[48:47] they show here are not typically what
[48:49] they had. They have much longer spears
[48:50] that could take a cal cavalry charge and
[48:53] they could even stop horsemen from
[48:54] running through the ranks. And and this
[48:56] was the Greek form of battle, but the
[48:58] Spartans, they they honed it to a
[49:00] perfect uh art. And so when it came to
[49:03] the Spartans, they they trained from a
[49:06] child to be a warrior. Uh not the women,
[49:09] the men. And and the training was
[49:12] difficult. And they would break bones
[49:14] and they would smash you up and they
[49:15] would beat you up and bruise you and
[49:17] they would work you so hard. And if you
[49:19] couldn't handle it, they actually kicked
[49:21] you out and you died because all they
[49:24] wanted was the best of the best when it
[49:26] came time to fight. And so when it came
[49:29] time to graduate, when they came to
[49:31] manhood, if they had survived all the
[49:32] training, they became a true Spartan and
[49:35] they earned their cloak and they earned
[49:37] their their weapons and their armor. And
[49:39] when they went out into battle, it was
[49:41] well recognized that a Spartan was worth
[49:43] 10 of any other soldier that was alive.
[49:46] Better than any one of them was worth 10
[49:48] on the battlefield. 1,000 of them could
[49:50] take on 10,000 and be an even match. And
[49:52] we'll see that it was even better than
[49:54] that. But what made them so difficult
[49:56] was that you could not break their line.
[50:00] You could not break their formations.
[50:01] They were so strong and they were so
[50:04] committed to fighting as a unit. Are you
[50:07] hearing me tonight? Fighting together,
[50:11] working together. They they took their
[50:13] training and when the when things got
[50:15] tough, they didn't change what they were
[50:17] doing, but they locked in and they
[50:18] stayed together. And they were in it to
[50:20] win it, not to get individual glory.
[50:23] They were in it to win it. And so it
[50:25] didn't matter who killed the the the the
[50:27] opposing general or who broke the line.
[50:29] All they cared was we're going to stay
[50:31] together and we're going to stick with
[50:33] our training until the other person
[50:34] loses. And they were machines. They were
[50:37] absolute killing machines. And and this
[50:39] is from a depiction of them at at a
[50:41] place called Thermopoly where they took
[50:43] on the Persian army. And again, we don't
[50:45] have exact records of it, but the
[50:47] estimate is that these 300 Spartans took
[50:50] on an army that had at least 120,000
[50:53] people. It could be upwards of 300,000
[50:56] people depending on which one which
[50:58] historian you you believe and which
[51:00] analysis you believe. But these 300
[51:03] Spartans came to a place called
[51:05] Thermopoly and they stood there and they
[51:08] blocked a narrow passage for seven days.
[51:11] And 300 held back an army of 120,000 at
[51:15] a minimum.
[51:17] And after those seven days, they were
[51:19] finally all killed because what happened
[51:21] is the enemy they they were betrayed by
[51:24] a a local that said, "There's a path
[51:26] that will allow you to come behind them
[51:28] and you can get up above them and you
[51:30] can get behind them." And when that was
[51:31] it, then they were sunk because they
[51:33] couldn't fight a battle from above and
[51:34] behind and in front. They just didn't
[51:36] have enough people. But in the end,
[51:38] those 300 men over 7 days, they only
[51:42] fought face to face for three days. In
[51:44] three days, they killed 20,000.
[51:47] 300 men killed 20,000 soldiers. You do
[51:51] the math on that, each one killed 70.
[51:57] You'd say that's an impossible
[51:58] situation. And when they went up and get
[52:01] this, the reason why they won is because
[52:04] they could not break the Spartan line.
[52:08] Amen. They defeated soldiers in this
[52:10] battle that had never been defeated
[52:13] before. Are you hearing me tonight? They
[52:16] had defeated ones that had never been
[52:18] defeated before. There was a Persian
[52:20] army. They had a a a group of soldiers.
[52:22] Their best soldiers were called the
[52:24] immortals
[52:26] because allegedly none of them had ever
[52:28] been killed. And when they came up
[52:29] against the Spartans, the Spartans went
[52:31] through them as if they were any other
[52:33] person. It didn't even slow the Spartans
[52:35] down. That's how powerful they were when
[52:37] they were battling. And what held them
[52:39] is three things. They would not move
[52:42] from their position.
[52:45] They would not be drawn out to fight
[52:46] alone. And they could not be baited or
[52:50] panicked to do something they were not
[52:52] trained to do. That was the key to their
[52:55] victories there. Amen. They would use
[52:57] their shields not just just to protect
[52:58] themselves, but to protect the man next
[53:00] to them. The ones behind would use
[53:02] shields to protect from above. The ones
[53:04] on the side would protect the sides. And
[53:05] so no matter where you went, everyone
[53:07] was protecting everyone else. No man was
[53:09] in it for himself. They were all
[53:11] fighting together. So I just wanted to
[53:13] put this up here tonight just to lock us
[53:15] in. We're preaching on hold the line.
[53:17] And there's three keys I want you to
[53:19] take from this one. Don't move from your
[53:22] position.
[53:23] When you take ground, do not back away
[53:26] for anything. For anything, do not back
[53:29] away. Hold the line. Second, don't
[53:33] forget your training.
[53:36] You've been trained to fight.
[53:38] How do you fight? Take God at his word.
[53:41] Don't change it to anything else. Keep
[53:44] using your training. Don't improvise.
[53:47] Don't react.
[53:50] Don't panic.
[53:52] Trust.
[53:54] Trust. Trust your training. It's amazing
[53:57] in the military they say the easiest
[53:58] person to train is the one that won't
[54:00] think because all they do is they take
[54:02] what you tell them and they apply it
[54:04] without trying to think their way around
[54:05] it. The last one they want in the mil
[54:07] military is somebody that's always
[54:08] secondguessing the the the training and
[54:10] the rules and the guidance. And then the
[54:12] last thing is a big one. Don't fight
[54:14] alone. And I put it here and I said by
[54:17] choice because I guarantee you by the
[54:19] end they were having to fight alone.
[54:20] They'd lost so many people that they
[54:22] were having to just fight as they were
[54:24] able to. But I say, don't fight alone by
[54:26] choice. Don't go out and try and take
[54:28] something on your own if you don't have
[54:30] to. Now, Paul would say this in
[54:32] Galatians. He says, "Now stand fast.
[54:35] Therefore, in the liberty wherewith
[54:36] Christ has made us free, and be not
[54:38] entangled again with the yoke of
[54:41] bondage." Now, Paul was talking to the
[54:43] Gentiles here who were having a Jewish
[54:45] influence that was trying to get them to
[54:46] go and get circumcised.
[54:49] And Paul said, "Listen, you've never
[54:50] been bound by this. You were bound by
[54:52] other religious ideas. They were serving
[54:54] false idols. They were serving false
[54:55] gods. They had all these traditions." He
[54:57] said, "Now, you know better than to than
[54:59] to go back to what you left. But don't
[55:00] let somebody else bind you by their own
[55:02] religion either." And I'll tell you
[55:04] this, sometimes what happens after we've
[55:06] gained victory is we'll have somebody
[55:08] come and try and tell you what you want.
[55:11] They'll try and put you in a place that
[55:12] maybe you didn't quite get that week.
[55:15] They'll try and put you in a spiritual
[55:17] box. Don't do that. You know what God
[55:19] has done for you. You stand on what he's
[55:21] revealed to you. Don't let somebody else
[55:23] define your opportunity. Don't let
[55:25] somebody else define your experience
[55:26] here. Paul says, "Stand fast where God
[55:29] has taken you. What God has done, you
[55:32] stick with that. Don't pretend you're
[55:35] something else because somebody thinks
[55:36] you should be. And don't go back to what
[55:38] you left either." He said, "Stand fast
[55:40] in your freedom." That word stand fast
[55:43] there means stand firm. Stay still. Be
[55:46] immovable. Persist. persevere. In other
[55:48] words, don't give back the ground that
[55:50] you've won. Don't walk back to what
[55:52] you've left. Keep pressing forward.
[55:55] Don't go back into a prison cell and
[55:57] shut the door on yourself. Don't
[55:59] willingly walk back to what God has set
[56:01] you free from. Do I I I don't have to
[56:04] ask, do you remember this, but do you
[56:05] remember when I had that that little
[56:07] movie of the sheep that got pulled out
[56:09] of that ditch? We all remember it. Elsa
[56:11] definitely remembers it. And then as
[56:13] soon as they pulled the sheep out, what
[56:14] did it do? It took three jumps and said,
[56:16] "Yay, I'm free." and jumped right back
[56:18] into the pit.
[56:20] Don't do that. Don't be that kind of
[56:21] sheep. Please don't be that kind of
[56:24] sheep. Amen. But that's what Paul's
[56:27] saying. Don't go back. Amen. Don't let
[56:29] somebody else bind you and don't
[56:32] voluntarily bind yourself.
[56:35] Recognize what God's done for you and
[56:37] keep away from those things. Amen. That
[56:39] phrase stand fast is actually the exact
[56:42] one that Christ used when he said when
[56:44] you stand praying forgive.
[56:47] In other words, he was saying when you
[56:48] stand fast praying.
[56:51] In other words, prayer is supposed to
[56:53] anchor us to our position. It's supposed
[56:56] to give us strength to hold what he's
[56:58] given us. Amen. You know, your time of
[57:00] prayer ought to be reinforcing what God
[57:03] has done for you rather than us doing
[57:06] anything or saying anything that would
[57:08] cause us to draw back. Well, Lord, maybe
[57:10] you didn't do this. Maybe you didn't
[57:11] mean that. Maybe I misjudged what you
[57:13] said. No, no, no. You say, "Lord, I
[57:15] believe. And Lord, I'm thanking you for
[57:17] what you did. And Lord, I'm thanking you
[57:19] for what I received. And Lord, I'm
[57:20] thanking you for the faith that you laid
[57:22] in my heart."
[57:24] And let that be a time of reinforcement
[57:26] when you're reading your Bible, when
[57:28] you're having your devotions, when
[57:29] you're talking with your spouse,
[57:30] whatever it may be. Let that be a time
[57:32] to encourage yourself to stand fast, to
[57:35] hold to what God has done for you. Amen.
[57:38] Prayer is supposed to solidify our
[57:40] position, not cause us to retreat back.
[57:43] Brother Brham says it this way. He says,
[57:44] "Stay with that word. Don't you never
[57:47] leave that word. You stand fast in the
[57:50] liberty where Christ has made you free.
[57:52] be not entangled in all those yolks of
[57:53] bondage and so forth. He says stand fast
[57:56] and stand free.
[57:59] Stand free. He says God will bless you.
[58:02] You have nothing in the world to fear.
[58:03] That's what blessed me so much about the
[58:05] testimony of brother Paul. Brother Paul
[58:07] said okay if I tell what happened just
[58:09] before service, the first service. So
[58:12] what happened is they came and sister
[58:13] Kimberly was not feeling well at all.
[58:15] Bad headache. Is that right? So bad she
[58:18] didn't want to come in here. And so they
[58:20] went to the man that was in the in the
[58:22] office. They went to brother Aaron. They
[58:23] said, "Would you pray for us?" And he
[58:24] prayed for her and it went away and she
[58:26] came in. Now, what is Satan trying to
[58:29] do?
[58:30] Satan's trying to get her to back up.
[58:34] But guess what? She's standing fast.
[58:36] She's got a husband that's standing fast
[58:38] with her and saying, "We're going to go
[58:40] to church. We're going to trust God.
[58:42] We're going to pray. And we're going to
[58:43] move forward." Now, he didn't leave when
[58:46] she was healed, but he said, "It's going
[58:48] to get better. It got better. It wasn't
[58:50] perfect. Let's go to church." And now
[58:53] they get here, and God's doing a work.
[58:55] Praise the Lord. That's what standing
[58:57] fast looks like. That blessed my heart
[58:59] to hear that, Brother Paul, Sister
[59:00] Kimberly. God bless you. That's what's
[59:02] holding the line looks like. I feel like
[59:05] I don't even need to preach tonight, but
[59:07] I'm going to keep going. Hold fast.
[59:10] Don't back up on these things. Amen. He
[59:12] says, "What? Stand fast and stand free.
[59:16] When you stand there, that's your
[59:18] liberty.
[59:19] It's your liberty. You know, it reminds
[59:21] me of that that Braveheart scene where
[59:23] he screams out freedom. I'd rather die
[59:26] free than live in slavery. And Satan
[59:29] wants to get you to a point where you're
[59:30] okay with living with a little bit of
[59:32] slavery.
[59:34] That's not what God made you to be.
[59:36] Stand fast. Stand fast in the liberty
[59:39] which wherein Christ has made you free.
[59:41] Amen. But we look at this idea of
[59:43] holding the line. And then when you
[59:44] start to see what it is that causes
[59:46] people to break the line, it's
[59:47] instructive for us to think about it
[59:49] tonight. Because what happens is we
[59:51] break the line, when we start wondering
[59:53] what's behind us.
[59:55] We start wondering, is something
[59:56] sneaking up that's going to get us? Or
[59:58] worse yet, when we think about what we
[1:00:01] could go back to that was so much easier
[1:00:03] than what I'm doing here right now.
[1:00:04] Because listen, being a Christian is
[1:00:06] more work than being a makebeliever.
[1:00:08] And it's definitely more work than being
[1:00:09] an unbeliever. And so what happens is
[1:00:11] when we start to back away and we think
[1:00:13] I could be living an easier life. I
[1:00:15] could be living a better life. I could
[1:00:17] go back to a simpler way of doing
[1:00:19] things. That's when we start to question
[1:00:21] why am I even fighting in the first
[1:00:22] place? Amen.
[1:00:25] Start looking at back. It reminds me of
[1:00:27] Israel in the in the desert and the
[1:00:30] least little thing caused them to say,
[1:00:32] "Oh, I remember I remember Egypt and how
[1:00:35] great it was with the leaks and the
[1:00:37] garlics."
[1:00:39] Yeah. And when you were a slave for 430
[1:00:42] years, let's not forget that. But Satan
[1:00:44] won't remind you of the slavery. He'll
[1:00:46] just point out the Greeks and the the
[1:00:47] the the the leaks and the garlics. I got
[1:00:50] Greeks on my mind tonight.
[1:00:53] He won't tell you about the slavery.
[1:00:55] He'll tell you the good parts about your
[1:00:58] slavery.
[1:00:59] That's what he wants to remind. You know
[1:01:01] what he'll do, church? He'll get you to
[1:01:03] try and settle for a little less than
[1:01:06] total victory.
[1:01:10] He'll get you to settle for 90% of the
[1:01:13] way. For better
[1:01:17] rather than beaten,
[1:01:20] better rather than overcoming,
[1:01:22] better rather than totally victorious.
[1:01:25] That's what he wants us to do because he
[1:01:27] doesn't want us to get that last little
[1:01:29] licking on him. He just wants that
[1:01:30] little finger hold, that little toe
[1:01:32] hold, so that he has access into your
[1:01:34] life. Amen.
[1:01:35] Satan will try and put a damper on your
[1:01:37] enthusiasm.
[1:01:39] Notice I'm not saying hold your
[1:01:40] enthusiasm.
[1:01:43] The enthusiasm is going to come and go.
[1:01:45] Don't hold on to your feel. Don't try
[1:01:47] and hold on to your feelings. That's not
[1:01:49] going to hold either. But I'm saying
[1:01:51] hold the line on what God's done for you
[1:01:53] by his word. Amen. We've got to have
[1:01:55] more than enthusiasm. We got to have
[1:01:57] faith in the power of God by his word.
[1:02:00] That's where we have to be standing.
[1:02:01] We've got to have a real foundation to
[1:02:03] our testimony. Brother says this. He
[1:02:05] says, "I said to somebody that's been
[1:02:06] talking to me about the Holy Ghost or
[1:02:07] about something or other like that." She
[1:02:09] says, "What made me feel that way just
[1:02:11] at the time I should have felt good." I
[1:02:14] said, "The devil, he's seen you is just
[1:02:16] ready to receive it." He said, "I'll put
[1:02:18] a little damper on her." He said, "Fan
[1:02:21] her a little bit, you know, kind of cool
[1:02:22] down a little." He says, "See, but oh
[1:02:25] my, that's when you rise." He says,
[1:02:27] "Claim your Godgiven rights." What was
[1:02:31] God trying to do to Sister Kimberly?
[1:02:34] cool her experience.
[1:02:38] Don't tell me he's not trying to do it
[1:02:39] with you. And if he hasn't, he will.
[1:02:42] He'll try and dampen the fire of
[1:02:44] revival.
[1:02:46] He'll try and dampen your your your your
[1:02:48] happiness and your joy, your peace, your
[1:02:52] thankfulness.
[1:02:54] Try and turn your eyes on something
[1:02:55] else. He says, "That's what Paul was
[1:02:57] meaning. See, always when I would do
[1:02:58] good, evil is present." You know, I
[1:03:00] thought it was so good when brother
[1:03:01] Aaron was preaching. And he says, "The
[1:03:02] devil is the father of all lies." So if
[1:03:04] the devil's talking to you, believe the
[1:03:06] opposite of what he's saying. If he's
[1:03:08] saying you're not healed, say, "I must
[1:03:11] be healed then because you're a liar."
[1:03:12] If he's saying you're not saved, then
[1:03:13] say, "Well, brother, I must be saved."
[1:03:15] He says, "You don't have the Holy
[1:03:16] Ghost." Well, brother, I must have the
[1:03:17] Holy Ghost because you're the father of
[1:03:19] lies.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Don't listen to him. If the word is
[1:03:23] telling you something, you better
[1:03:25] listen. But if just the thoughts coming
[1:03:27] through your head, brother, sister, you
[1:03:29] better check that with the word. And if
[1:03:30] it doesn't line up, then you put that
[1:03:32] thing back to hell where it came from.
[1:03:34] Amen. We got to remember who's talking
[1:03:36] to us. Amen. We got to remember that he
[1:03:38] offers us thoughts and he offers us
[1:03:40] problems and he offers us what people
[1:03:42] are thinking about us and he offers us a
[1:03:45] solution to all those things and he's
[1:03:46] trying to get us worked up because the
[1:03:48] mind is the battleground for Satan in
[1:03:50] our lives. You know, I had a moment on
[1:03:52] Monday morning
[1:03:54] where something happened and I got in a
[1:03:55] little bit of a mood.
[1:03:58] Wasn't my fault.
[1:04:02] And so I was in the van driving
[1:04:04] and I was just I was a little bit
[1:04:06] unhappy
[1:04:08] and something said to me,
[1:04:12] "What is it that's taking this away from
[1:04:14] you? Who is it that's taking your joy
[1:04:16] away from you? You're so happy and then
[1:04:18] all of a sudden one little thing happens
[1:04:20] and you lost your joy." And I said,
[1:04:21] "That's exactly it. That's just Satan
[1:04:23] trying to get on my nerves."
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; And so you know what I started doing? I
[1:04:26] started singing a song of praise. And
[1:04:29] you know what? By the time I got home, I
[1:04:30] didn't even have a thought about what
[1:04:32] was going on in the first place.
[1:04:35] Why? Because I remembered I'm in a
[1:04:38] battle and I'm supposed to win.
[1:04:43] You're supposed to win. And but I just
[1:04:46] had to remember that's not me thinking
[1:04:48] that.
[1:04:50] I'm a child of God. Those thoughts don't
[1:04:53] originate from my soul. So something
[1:04:55] else is trying to influence me.
[1:04:57] Something else is trying to push me back
[1:05:00] and I've got to recognize something's
[1:05:02] pushing me. And rather than go with it,
[1:05:05] say, "Hold on a second here. You got no
[1:05:08] right to push me around. I'm a child of
[1:05:10] God. I'm standing on his word." Amen.
[1:05:13] I've got joy because he gave me joy and
[1:05:15] I'm going to keep my joy. Amen.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's my God-given position is to
[1:05:19] be an overcomer. You know, and sometimes
[1:05:21] what happens, we start looking back at
[1:05:23] what we struggled with last week or last
[1:05:25] month or last year, and then we start to
[1:05:27] worry, are we going to go back to those?
[1:05:29] We start to look at the the the feelings
[1:05:31] we have. We start to look at the
[1:05:32] sickness we have. We start to wonder,
[1:05:34] did I really receive a change? Did God
[1:05:36] really do something in my life? Has I
[1:05:38] have I really been delivered? We start
[1:05:40] to wonder if there's really victory.
[1:05:44] Because when everything calms down,
[1:05:45] that's when the mind battle starts.
[1:05:47] Amen.
[1:05:48] And we start to say, "Is this thing
[1:05:50] going to hold now? I've tried so many
[1:05:52] times. Is this going to be the time that
[1:05:53] I'm going to actually finally keep
[1:05:55] moving on and I'm not going to be
[1:05:56] sliding back?" Amen. I'm preaching hold
[1:05:59] the line tonight. And again, I'm not
[1:06:00] preaching hold the feelings. I'm saying
[1:06:03] hold the line of your testimony. And
[1:06:05] sometimes we settle for the fact that we
[1:06:07] fought rather than we got the victory.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; We sit there and say, "Well, I tried. I
[1:06:14] did my best. I stood on God's word.
[1:06:17] That's what counts, church. The purpose
[1:06:19] of fighting is to win, not to lose
[1:06:22] graciously.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; You know what? When somebody and I'm
[1:06:26] about to play a game with somebody and
[1:06:27] it matters, it's competitive. I don't go
[1:06:29] up and say good luck.
[1:06:31] If anything, I would say good luck. As
[1:06:34] in, you're going down, buddy.
[1:06:37] I'm not in it to lose. I'm in it to win.
[1:06:39] But so often we say, well, I tried. No,
[1:06:43] you're not here just to try. You're here
[1:06:44] to overcome. Amen. That's that's our
[1:06:47] motto. Remember to him that
[1:06:49] overcomemeth. Our motto is we are
[1:06:52] overcomers. And so we're not here to
[1:06:54] fight so that we can bow our head at the
[1:06:56] end and shake their hand and say, "Good
[1:06:57] job. You sure whooped me." Our job is to
[1:07:00] hold fast, hold the line, win the
[1:07:03] victory. Amen. You know that that that
[1:07:05] that story of Elijah comes to my mind.
[1:07:08] Remember when he he gave that that
[1:07:09] promise to the Shounomite woman that she
[1:07:11] was going to have a son? She said,
[1:07:12] "Listen, don't don't raise my hopes like
[1:07:14] that. you know, I wanted one. It' break
[1:07:16] my heart if you told me I was going to
[1:07:18] get one and I didn't get it. He said,
[1:07:19] "Thus sayith the Lord, you're going to
[1:07:20] have a son." She has a son. He lives for
[1:07:22] a number of years, goes out in the
[1:07:23] field, gets a just falls sick. I don't
[1:07:26] know if it's heat stroke or what, and
[1:07:27] dies.
[1:07:29] She runs to him and and and she takes a
[1:07:31] servant. They get on the mules and they
[1:07:33] go and they bring him back. And Gahazy,
[1:07:35] you remember, goes and lays a staff on
[1:07:36] him. Nothing happens. He said, "Elijah,
[1:07:38] nothing happened." Elijah goes in and
[1:07:40] Elijah came and prayed for the boy and
[1:07:43] nothing happened.
[1:07:47] This is the promised son and the promise
[1:07:50] is now laying on his bed dead
[1:07:54] and he prays and nothing happens. I'm
[1:07:56] reminded of when sister Justine and her
[1:07:58] father came to my office there last year
[1:08:00] or whenever it was and she had that
[1:08:02] migraine headache and and they came in
[1:08:04] and just before I was about to preach
[1:08:06] and I prayed for her and just like
[1:08:08] Elijah nothing happened.
[1:08:12] But remember, she didn't stop with the
[1:08:15] prayer.
[1:08:18] She said, "I want prayer because I want
[1:08:20] to stay in service, and so I'm going to
[1:08:22] stay in service." What was she doing?
[1:08:24] She was holding the line by a cry in her
[1:08:27] soul to be in the presence of God and
[1:08:29] hear the preaching of the word of God.
[1:08:32] And so she stayed there. And the longer
[1:08:34] she stayed, the better she felt. And by
[1:08:36] the end of that service, she was healed
[1:08:38] from her migraine. Why? She held the
[1:08:40] line. She didn't back away because she
[1:08:43] her flesh wanted to back away. She took
[1:08:45] God at his word. She showed she was
[1:08:47] serious and God honored her faith.
[1:08:50] Listen to what brother Brandham says. He
[1:08:52] says, "You know what's the matter with
[1:08:53] the churches today?" He says, "We give
[1:08:56] up too quick."
[1:08:58] Elijah stayed there and he prayed and he
[1:09:01] prayed and he prayed until what?
[1:09:04] Something happened. He says, "If men and
[1:09:07] women in here who wants Christ or the
[1:09:09] Holy Ghost, who wants to be healed, if
[1:09:12] they would just stay there and say,
[1:09:14] 'Lord, you promised it.
[1:09:17] You promised it." In other words, I
[1:09:19] didn't make this up. This is not a
[1:09:21] construct of my imagination, but it is
[1:09:24] your uh word that cannot return to you
[1:09:27] void. You promised it," he says. And
[1:09:29] then feel that little trickle. What is
[1:09:31] it? Faith rising up. faith to take him
[1:09:34] at his word and then say, "Here it is,
[1:09:37] Lord. I accept it." He says something is
[1:09:40] going to happen. Going to happen.
[1:09:43] Doesn't mean it always happens right
[1:09:44] then and there. It's in God's time. It's
[1:09:46] in God's season. But once you've settled
[1:09:49] it with God, there's something in you
[1:09:50] that has risen up and nothing's going to
[1:09:52] stop it from happening. But you got to
[1:09:54] stay there till you know that you know.
[1:09:57] That's what Brother Brandon would say.
[1:09:58] Amen. Move forward in faith. When you
[1:10:00] know you found the will of God, then
[1:10:02] press forward.
[1:10:03] Hold the line. He says, "I believe God
[1:10:06] hears, but God doesn't always have to
[1:10:07] answer prayer." Right? Then see, God
[1:10:09] answers in his own time. If you ask him
[1:10:13] and believe him, then he will answer in
[1:10:16] his own time. And that's where the
[1:10:18] holding your line, holding the line,
[1:10:20] holding your ground comes into play. And
[1:10:22] how do we do it? How do we do it in the
[1:10:24] time of waiting? How do we hold
[1:10:26] ourselves in position so that we don't
[1:10:28] back down? So that our faith doesn't
[1:10:30] waver. so that we don't give back the
[1:10:32] position that we've taken. How do we
[1:10:34] stand our ground? It is very simple.
[1:10:37] It's got to be simple because most of us
[1:10:39] are simple.
[1:10:41] Brother says this, that's the way the
[1:10:43] Christian ought to do today is one
[1:10:46] thing. Keep yourself prayed up
[1:10:51] under a spiritual atmosphere always.
[1:10:54] What kind of an atmosphere?
[1:10:59] spiritual,
[1:11:02] not emotional, good or bad.
[1:11:06] Emotion won't hold us.
[1:11:09] A spiritual atmosphere. How do you have
[1:11:11] a spiritual atmosphere, church? It has
[1:11:14] to be based on the word of God and his
[1:11:17] presence. That's what a spiritual
[1:11:19] atmosphere, not a religious atmosphere.
[1:11:20] A spiritual atmosphere is knowing that
[1:11:22] he is there with you and he's fulfilling
[1:11:25] his word. He says, "Never seeing the bad
[1:11:28] side, looking to the good side." He
[1:11:30] says, "You are children of God expecting
[1:11:34] his blessings." You know, when I read
[1:11:36] this, I thought of of Brother John
[1:11:38] Andy's. He's a good buddy of mine. I'll
[1:11:40] tell you what, with Brother John, you
[1:11:42] can't get a negative word out of him. I
[1:11:46] don't believe he knows how to say a
[1:11:47] negative thing
[1:11:50] because why? There's no power in the
[1:11:53] negative side of things. there's no good
[1:11:55] comes out of it. And so I I have talked
[1:11:58] to him about situations that were val
[1:11:59] very very challenging, very tough, and
[1:12:02] you still can't get a negative
[1:12:04] confession out of him. I say, "Lord,
[1:12:06] help us to be more like that. Keep
[1:12:09] ourselves tight to the word." Amen. You
[1:12:11] know, we look at our our our past, we
[1:12:13] look at history, we look at past
[1:12:15] performance, and that's a great weapon
[1:12:16] of Satan's these days.
[1:12:21] Doesn't matter how good you've been,
[1:12:23] you've also had your weak moments. And
[1:12:25] Satan will get us looking back at those
[1:12:27] things. And if he can get you looking
[1:12:29] backwards, you'll never beat what's in
[1:12:31] front of you. Amen. You got to look at
[1:12:33] what's behind you as something you've
[1:12:35] overcome.
[1:12:37] Cuz you're here.
[1:12:40] I can't be here
[1:12:42] if I haven't beaten everything that's
[1:12:44] back here.
[1:12:45] If I'm in a battle, and we are, then
[1:12:48] everything behind me has been defeated.
[1:12:50] And we've got to look at it that way.
[1:12:52] And a defeated enemy doesn't bother me.
[1:12:55] The way it worked with the Spartans is
[1:12:57] when they knocked the front line down,
[1:12:59] they didn't worry about if they were
[1:13:00] dead or not because everyone behind them
[1:13:02] made sure they were.
[1:13:05] And that's the way it is for the
[1:13:06] believer. If it's behind me, it's dead.
[1:13:08] It's killed. It's done. So, I don't have
[1:13:11] to worry about it anymore. Amen. If
[1:13:14] Satan can make you think what you've
[1:13:15] always been, you'll never get to be what
[1:13:17] you're supposed to be. He's got to get
[1:13:20] you looking backwards. Amen. Because
[1:13:22] we've all lost battles. We've all been
[1:13:24] disappointed by those things. But God's
[1:13:26] trying to take us, if we're going to
[1:13:27] look back, he wants us to look back to
[1:13:29] eternity, to our origin, our original
[1:13:32] source, to where we came from out of his
[1:13:34] mind, rather than when we were just born
[1:13:36] by our natural mother and father and all
[1:13:37] the things that have happened between
[1:13:39] that. But what he really wants us to see
[1:13:41] is where we're going.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Because origin is destiny, the prophet
[1:13:44] said, "We come from God, we go back to
[1:13:47] God." And God's trying to get us to see,
[1:13:48] you're a child of God. You're coming
[1:13:49] back to me. And Satan's trying to get us
[1:13:52] see what we did yesterday.
[1:13:54] I'm picking what's ahead. I'll take
[1:13:56] that. Brother Ram says this. He said, or
[1:13:59] sorry, uh, Paul would say this in
[1:14:02] Philippians 3. God's trying to get us to
[1:14:04] see what he's doing through a perfect
[1:14:05] redemption process. And Paul says this.
[1:14:07] He says, "Brethren, I count not myself
[1:14:10] to have apprehended." He says, "In other
[1:14:11] words, I don't I don't I don't ex I I I
[1:14:14] can't say I've got it all.
[1:14:17] Anybody here think they've got it all?"
[1:14:20] No.
[1:14:22] He says, "I I I'm not trying to say I've
[1:14:24] got it all." He says, "But this one
[1:14:26] thing I do," and I want you to catch
[1:14:28] this, okay? Because you He's giving us
[1:14:30] instruct instructions on how to do what
[1:14:32] he's telling us to do. And you can't do
[1:14:34] what he's telling you to do if you don't
[1:14:36] do everything he's telling you to do.
[1:14:37] Okay? He says this one thing I do
[1:14:40] forgetting those things which are
[1:14:45] behind
[1:14:48] to do what he wants you to do. You got
[1:14:50] to do everything. One, forget what's
[1:14:52] behind.
[1:14:55] Don't dwell on it. Don't resurrect it.
[1:14:58] Don't think about it. Definitely don't
[1:14:59] worry about it. And definitely don't
[1:15:02] claim it. forgetting those things which
[1:15:04] are behind and reaching forth to those
[1:15:06] things which are before.
[1:15:09] Why would you leave what's behind?
[1:15:11] Because you got something better up
[1:15:13] ahead. That's why we let it go. That's
[1:15:16] why we let it go. He says, "So this one
[1:15:18] thing I do, I forget. I ignore. It's
[1:15:20] dead. It's behind me. Everything behind
[1:15:22] me. Reaching forth to those things which
[1:15:24] are before. I do one thing. Press.
[1:15:29] I push.
[1:15:32] I put every bit of energy I have to
[1:15:35] going forward.
[1:15:37] And what would happen with the Spartans
[1:15:38] is when they were about to hit the line,
[1:15:40] they were to take that initial shock,
[1:15:42] they'd lock everything in and they brace
[1:15:44] their foot and right at the moment of
[1:15:46] impact, they go and they just offset
[1:15:48] that impact with their own impact. And
[1:15:50] it was meant to blunt the force of the
[1:15:52] charge. And usually what you'd see is
[1:15:54] they get driven back just a little bit
[1:15:55] just from sheer momentum. But once they
[1:15:58] held, then what they do is they'd lean
[1:16:00] back and they'd press and everyone would
[1:16:02] shove together and all they're trying to
[1:16:04] do is get that army moving back step by
[1:16:06] step by step because once you start
[1:16:08] moving, it's hard to stop and especially
[1:16:10] backwards and you're crowding into the
[1:16:12] people behind you and they don't know
[1:16:13] what's happening. Paul says, "I do one
[1:16:15] thing. I press toward the mark for the
[1:16:18] prize of the high calling of God in
[1:16:20] Christ Jesus." You can't press forward
[1:16:22] while trying to hold on to something
[1:16:23] behind you.
[1:16:25] You can't press forward with all your
[1:16:26] might when you're busy looking at what's
[1:16:28] behind you. Amen. You've got to focus on
[1:16:31] one thing. What's ahead? What's ahead?
[1:16:33] If God's brought you this far, what's
[1:16:35] behind doesn't matter. What's ahead is
[1:16:36] what matters. And that's what he's
[1:16:38] pointing you towards. Amen. Why? You let
[1:16:40] go of what's behind because there's an
[1:16:41] expectation of something that's so much
[1:16:43] better waiting for you. That's what he's
[1:16:46] doing. Brother Bram says it this way. He
[1:16:48] says, "A Christian doesn't try to be
[1:16:49] what he used to be. He's not looking
[1:16:52] where he's been. He's looking where he's
[1:16:56] going. He says, "See, don't pay any
[1:16:59] attention to what you were then. You've
[1:17:01] already lived that out." He says,
[1:17:03] "You'll never return to it. That's in
[1:17:07] the past." He says, "And any man that
[1:17:09] drives life's road looking through a
[1:17:11] rearview mirror will go to wreck, and so
[1:17:13] will you on this Christian road. Don't
[1:17:15] look back what you were. Look what
[1:17:17] you're going to be." Paul said,
[1:17:18] "Forgetting those things which are in
[1:17:20] the past, I press towards the prize of
[1:17:22] the mark of the high calling." You know
[1:17:25] what we need to do? I've heard many
[1:17:26] preachers say it and I think it's a
[1:17:28] wonderful thing. If Satan's trying to
[1:17:30] remind you of your past, start reminding
[1:17:32] him of his future. Brother, I read it
[1:17:34] this week. He says, "We will look on him
[1:17:36] and narrowly and say, "Is this the one?
[1:17:39] This little puny worm, this wimp, this
[1:17:42] shrimp
[1:17:48] That's what he's going to have. We're
[1:17:50] going to be looking at him and be like,
[1:17:52] "Wow, really?
[1:17:55] You don't have to wait till then to do
[1:17:56] that." Amen. You need to remind Satan
[1:18:01] that the last enemy that will be
[1:18:03] defeated before we leave here is death.
[1:18:06] It says the last one. So, you know what
[1:18:08] that means, church? Every single other
[1:18:11] enemy will be defeated before we leave
[1:18:14] this earth.
[1:18:15] Hallelujah. Every demon, every
[1:18:18] tormentor, every sickness, everything
[1:18:21] that tries and hold us back from our our
[1:18:24] redemptive process through Christ will
[1:18:26] be defeated. And the last one's death.
[1:18:29] Everything. There will not be an enemy
[1:18:32] here that hasn't been defeated by the
[1:18:33] bride of Christ because the last one's
[1:18:35] going to be death.
[1:18:38] But we've got to hold our ground. Well,
[1:18:40] how do you know how to do that? Well,
[1:18:42] first of all, you got to know what your
[1:18:43] ground is. You got to know what your
[1:18:45] position is. You got to know what it is
[1:18:47] that you're fighting for, what you're
[1:18:49] you're trying to hold in the first
[1:18:50] place. Now, Paul will be talking of
[1:18:52] Christ in Ephesians chapter 1. And he
[1:18:54] says, "Christ was far above." Christ is
[1:18:57] far above all principality and power and
[1:19:00] dominion, and every name that is named,
[1:19:03] not only in this world, but also in that
[1:19:05] which is to come. Now, we look at that,
[1:19:06] we say, "Amen. Christ is above all."
[1:19:09] What a wonderful place that must be.
[1:19:12] far above, not just above, far above. In
[1:19:18] other words, everything is far below
[1:19:19] him. Okay?
[1:19:22] And he says, "And he has put all
[1:19:25] things,"
[1:19:27] how many things?
[1:19:29] All things under his feet
[1:19:33] and gave him to be the head over all
[1:19:35] things to the church.
[1:19:37] Now, what is the church?
[1:19:40] Verse 23 says, "Which is his body,
[1:19:43] the fullness of him that fillth all in
[1:19:46] all. She is the full expression of
[1:19:49] Christ the word in this final age."
[1:19:53] So everything that he is is far above
[1:19:56] all principality, power, might and
[1:19:59] dominion.
[1:20:01] And everything is under his feet. Now
[1:20:04] who are his feet?
[1:20:08] We are his body.
[1:20:10] So where he is is where we are. His
[1:20:13] position is our position. We are in him.
[1:20:16] He is in us. So when he says that he is
[1:20:19] far above all principality, power,
[1:20:21] might, and dominion, then whose name can
[1:20:23] you put there as well? Yours. That's
[1:20:26] where you're standing. Your position as
[1:20:28] a son and daughter of God is far above
[1:20:32] all principality, power, might, and
[1:20:34] dominion.
[1:20:38] Do you believe it?
[1:20:41] I say, God, help us to believe it a
[1:20:43] little more. God, help us to recognize
[1:20:45] it. Amen. When you look at that
[1:20:47] scripture and you see your position in
[1:20:49] Christ, every demon, devil, torment,
[1:20:53] sickness, power, whatever it might be,
[1:20:56] is beneath you tonight. If you're in
[1:20:58] Christ, by the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:00] Spirit. Amen. That's 1 Corinthians 12.
[1:21:02] By one spirit, we're baptized into one
[1:21:04] body. That's the only way you can get it
[1:21:06] is buy the new earth. Remember, we're
[1:21:07] fighting a defeated enemy tonight. I
[1:21:10] don't want to get into my dominion
[1:21:11] series on Sunday, but I've got a few
[1:21:13] things in here that tie into these
[1:21:14] things. But Satan's trying to make it
[1:21:16] look like he's got all the power. And
[1:21:19] God's trying to tell you, I have given
[1:21:21] you all authority to take my power and
[1:21:23] use it against the enemy. We don't have
[1:21:26] power. We've got authority. That's what
[1:21:28] we have. Amen. The power we have is to
[1:21:30] get ourselves out of the way so we can
[1:21:32] properly use that authority. Amen. We
[1:21:34] think our power and our strength is
[1:21:36] proved in victory. And I don't disagree.
[1:21:38] But I have to say this. If you haven't
[1:21:40] given in yet, you're winning.
[1:21:43] If you're still standing, you're
[1:21:44] winning. If you're still fighting,
[1:21:46] you're winning. If you're still pushing
[1:21:48] and pressing, you're winning. Why? Cuz
[1:21:50] he hasn't won yet. And if he hasn't won,
[1:21:53] then we're winning. That's the way that
[1:21:54] I choose to look at. Amen. You're still
[1:21:57] coming to church. You still have a
[1:21:58] desire in your heart to serve God. You
[1:22:00] have faith in your heart. However little
[1:22:02] it might seem to you, I'm here to tell
[1:22:03] you tonight, you're winning cuz he
[1:22:06] hasn't lost. Amen. These things point to
[1:22:08] something. And the longer the fight goes
[1:22:10] on, the more worried Satan gets.
[1:22:14] The more you keep testifying, the more
[1:22:16] you keep worshiping, the more you keep
[1:22:18] saying, "I believe." That's what gets
[1:22:20] Satan worried. Amen. Every time he
[1:22:22] punches us, knocks us down, makes things
[1:22:25] difficult, and we just get up and say,
[1:22:26] "Praise the Lord. I'm thankful for his
[1:22:28] spirit. I'm thankful for his word. I'm
[1:22:31] thankful for his promise and we keep
[1:22:32] pressing forward. That's what makes him
[1:22:34] worried. You look at you look at these
[1:22:37] these boxing matches and that and
[1:22:39] sometimes it seems so one-sided, but the
[1:22:41] longer the fight goes on, the more
[1:22:44] worried the one that was supposed to win
[1:22:46] gets cuz it was supposed to be easy and
[1:22:49] it wasn't easy. And maybe it was close
[1:22:51] for the first while and maybe he almost
[1:22:54] had us down and maybe he almost had us
[1:22:55] out and maybe he knocked us down two out
[1:22:57] of the three times you're allowed to do.
[1:22:59] But we kept getting up and towing the
[1:23:01] line. See, in the old days in boxing,
[1:23:04] they didn't have time rounds like we do
[1:23:06] today. These days, it's three or or five
[1:23:08] minutes depending on on on uh where
[1:23:11] you're fighting and what you're doing.
[1:23:13] But in the old days, what happened is a
[1:23:14] round was until somebody got knocked
[1:23:16] down. So, it might go 10 minutes or it
[1:23:19] might go 12 seconds. But to start the
[1:23:22] next round, what they had was in the
[1:23:24] middle of the ring, they would have a
[1:23:25] line. And to start the round to say,
[1:23:29] "I'm going to continue fighting," you
[1:23:30] had to come up and you had to put your
[1:23:31] toe to the line. And the other guy had
[1:23:33] to put his toe to the line. And then you
[1:23:34] started slugging it out again. You had
[1:23:36] to tow the line. That's where the phrase
[1:23:38] tow the line comes up. In other words,
[1:23:40] put your challenge out there. Say, "I'm
[1:23:41] in for the battle." We're talking about
[1:23:43] holding the line. We've got to go up to
[1:23:44] the line. Say, "You knocked me down, but
[1:23:46] I'm still here and I'm not going away."
[1:23:48] A righteous man falls seven times and
[1:23:50] gets up again. Why? He comes back and he
[1:23:53] toes the line. Amen. And so when you do
[1:23:55] that, Satan starts to get very nervous
[1:23:57] because I don't know if you know this,
[1:23:59] but he certainly does. His time is
[1:24:00] getting short. And he still doesn't have
[1:24:03] you.
[1:24:05] And that makes him very, very nervous.
[1:24:07] And the longer it goes, the more those
[1:24:09] little worms and seeds of doubt start to
[1:24:11] play in his little mind. And he starts
[1:24:14] to wonder, "Am I ever going to beat
[1:24:15] these people? Am I ever going to win
[1:24:17] them over?" He knows he has no lasting
[1:24:20] power. And the longer he goes against
[1:24:23] you and doesn't defeat you, the more he
[1:24:26] knows that you're starting to realize
[1:24:28] he's not as big and bad as I thought he
[1:24:30] was. I'm still here fighting. I'm still
[1:24:33] here believing. I'm still here
[1:24:35] worshiping. I still have joy. I still
[1:24:37] have peace. I still have rest. I might
[1:24:40] be sick. I might be in financial
[1:24:42] hardship. My family may not be where
[1:24:44] it's supposed to be. But guess what?
[1:24:46] I'll praise the Lord. No matter what may
[1:24:49] come my way, I'm gonna praise the Lord.
[1:24:52] Satan hates it when we praise the Lord
[1:24:53] when nothing else is going right. And it
[1:24:56] makes him extremely nervous. Amen. You I
[1:24:59] was reading in Luke the other day in my
[1:25:00] devotions where Jesus was in the Garden
[1:25:02] of Gethsemane and they came and they the
[1:25:04] soldiers and and whatnot, they came and
[1:25:06] they they bound him up. And I want you
[1:25:09] to listen to what he said. I'm I'm kind
[1:25:10] of jumping a bit into our series on on
[1:25:12] our position of dominion, but I want to
[1:25:14] share this with you tonight. Jesus said
[1:25:16] this. He says, "When I was with you day,
[1:25:18] when I was daily with you in the temple,
[1:25:20] you stretched forth no hands against
[1:25:22] me." He says, "But this is your hour and
[1:25:25] the power of darkness."
[1:25:28] There's a time. We're in a time of
[1:25:29] darkness. We are lights in a time of
[1:25:32] darkness. But I'll tell you what, the
[1:25:33] darkness is growing stronger. It will
[1:25:36] not defeat the light that's in us, but
[1:25:38] there is an hour of darkness that's
[1:25:40] coming. And it's in that tribulation.
[1:25:42] And that's when he's going to have his
[1:25:44] greatest moment. But until then, he's
[1:25:45] trying to snuff the light out that the
[1:25:47] bride has. And Jesus is saying to them,
[1:25:50] he's saying, "Listen, you've got a time
[1:25:51] where it seems like you're winning. You
[1:25:54] got a time where it seems like I have
[1:25:55] completely lost and you have won it."
[1:25:58] Amen. And he would say, you know, it
[1:26:00] seems like you've got a great victory
[1:26:02] going on there. And from that moment, it
[1:26:04] seemed like things got darker and
[1:26:06] darker.
[1:26:08] Jesus goes and he's judged and he's he's
[1:26:11] spat upon and he's punched and they
[1:26:13] ripped his beard out and then they take
[1:26:14] him to the whipping post and then they
[1:26:16] take him and they crucify him and it
[1:26:18] just seems like Satan's having his day.
[1:26:21] Greatest day ever. Satan was having a
[1:26:23] victory dance church. But I want you to
[1:26:25] recognize something. Satan forgot his
[1:26:28] position in the word.
[1:26:31] And Satan is dancing in front of that
[1:26:33] that that that cross at Calvary perhaps.
[1:26:36] And Satan, catch this, was so busy
[1:26:39] bruising Jesus heel that he forgot that
[1:26:43] Jesus was bruising his head.
[1:26:47] Satan was so busy making sure that Jesus
[1:26:49] was punched and spit
[1:26:53] that he forgot. Oh yeah, there's a
[1:26:56] second part to this.
[1:26:59] Listen, if we have a situation where
[1:27:01] you're bruising my heel and I'm bruising
[1:27:03] your head, what's our relative position?
[1:27:06] I won't bring somebody up for this. But
[1:27:09] listen, if we're fighting and I'm
[1:27:11] bruising your head and you're bruising
[1:27:13] my heel, there's only one place you can
[1:27:15] be.
[1:27:19] And I don't know about you, I prefer not
[1:27:21] to fight with my head against somebody's
[1:27:22] foot that's standing above me. But
[1:27:24] that's what Satan was doing was he was
[1:27:26] so busy celebrating the fact that he was
[1:27:29] bruising Jesus heel.
[1:27:32] Remember he said he was going to put
[1:27:33] emnity between the seat. He says you'll
[1:27:35] bruise his heel and he'll bruise your
[1:27:37] head. And he forgot he's going to be
[1:27:40] stomping on my head and I'm going to
[1:27:41] think I'm bruising his heel.
[1:27:45] What Satan thought was his greatest
[1:27:48] victory
[1:27:50] was just the key to Jesus having his
[1:27:53] greatest victory. We're in a battle.
[1:27:55] You're going to get punched. You're
[1:27:57] going to get hurt. And Jesus absolutely
[1:27:59] did. But when Jesus took a mortal wound,
[1:28:02] you know, and he gave up his life and
[1:28:04] then they put the spear in there to make
[1:28:05] sure he was dead, it seemed like it
[1:28:07] would eliminate him completely from
[1:28:10] victory. But that that giving of his
[1:28:12] life was what carried him down to the
[1:28:15] regions of the lost, carried him down to
[1:28:17] hell itself. And there the wounding of
[1:28:21] or the bruising of his heel took him to
[1:28:23] the place where he would take the keys
[1:28:24] of death, hell, and the grave. In other
[1:28:27] words, the bruising of Jesus was the
[1:28:30] elevator that took him down to victory.
[1:28:34] And Satan's so busy having a heyday.
[1:28:38] It reminds me of, you know, that the
[1:28:39] lion, the witch in the wardrobe, and
[1:28:40] they kill Alan and they're all
[1:28:42] celebrating. And then they go away and
[1:28:44] there's that big crack across that table
[1:28:46] of stone.
[1:28:48] And when Alan comes back, he says,
[1:28:50] "There was a there was a a more ancient
[1:28:53] law. There was a more ancient thing that
[1:28:55] was written and she forgot about that.
[1:28:57] That's what happened with Satan. He
[1:28:58] forgot the whole word. Amen. And what
[1:29:00] happened was the bruising of Jesus was
[1:29:02] part of the ultimate victory of Jesus.
[1:29:05] He was bruised for our iniquities. So we
[1:29:09] don't have to be bruised.
[1:29:11] It says the chastisement of our peace
[1:29:12] was upon him. We can have peace without
[1:29:15] that beating.
[1:29:18] It says that by his stripes we are
[1:29:19] healed. Our healing to defeat sickness
[1:29:22] which comes from Satan was there when
[1:29:25] Satan was bruising Jesus healed.
[1:29:28] Satan was literally doing what was
[1:29:31] required to get Jesus to a point where
[1:29:33] we could receive everything we have
[1:29:35] today in redemptive blessing.
[1:29:38] Satan was fulfilling God's purpose.
[1:29:43] What am I saying?
[1:29:44] Your position in Christ because of what
[1:29:47] he took at Calvary is above every
[1:29:50] principality, power, dominion, authority
[1:29:54] that Satan can throw at you. If you'll
[1:29:57] recognize it. We look at the pain and we
[1:29:59] look at the discomfort and the hard
[1:30:01] times, but that's what victory looks
[1:30:03] like so many times.
[1:30:05] Getting beaten up and bruised is part of
[1:30:07] victory, but you're going to overcome.
[1:30:10] That's what it looks like. Amen. That's
[1:30:12] holding the line. Amen. We've got each
[1:30:14] other. We are not fighting this battle
[1:30:16] alone. We've got each other here to
[1:30:19] carry each other's burdens, to help in
[1:30:21] those times. We're here to share the
[1:30:22] load and encourage and strengthen. You
[1:30:24] know, I said earlier that that theme of
[1:30:26] don't fight alone. And I stand by that.
[1:30:29] Let your brothers and sisters help you
[1:30:30] out. This is why we restarted prayer
[1:30:33] meetings is so that you can come and
[1:30:35] share a need with everyone else. That
[1:30:38] you can share a burden with everyone
[1:30:40] else. So come and get your needs
[1:30:41] supported.
[1:30:44] For those of you that have given a need
[1:30:46] at the prayer meetings, how does it make
[1:30:48] you feel when you hear other people pray
[1:30:50] for your need? It's the most wonderful
[1:30:52] thing in the world to know that sons and
[1:30:54] daughters of God are bringing you before
[1:30:56] the throne of grace that they love you,
[1:30:58] that they care about you, that you when
[1:31:00] you shared a need, they took it on them
[1:31:02] as their their burden as well. And now
[1:31:04] they're going to help you fight that
[1:31:05] burden. That's what's happening. Come to
[1:31:08] prayer meeting if you haven't come to
[1:31:10] prayer meeting. It'll change the way you
[1:31:12] go through your week. It'll change the
[1:31:14] way that you carry your burdens through
[1:31:15] life. Amen. But listen, there still come
[1:31:17] days and there comes times where it's
[1:31:19] going to be just you.
[1:31:21] But I still say, don't fight alone
[1:31:26] because you got to recognize what Paul
[1:31:29] said. Greater is he that's in me than he
[1:31:31] that's in the world. We're getting into
[1:31:33] a service. Maybe I'll preach in the
[1:31:35] future. But here's the thing. Brother
[1:31:37] Brand would say that every demon
[1:31:39] trembles when even the weakest Christian
[1:31:41] falls to their needs. Their needs. Do
[1:31:43] you know why that is, church? Because
[1:31:46] when you fall to your needs, he sees
[1:31:48] that you recognize that it's not by your
[1:31:50] strength you're going to overcome, but
[1:31:52] you're going to the one who lives inside
[1:31:54] of you and saying, "By your strength,
[1:31:55] I'm going to overcome." That's what
[1:31:57] makes him scared. What makes him happy
[1:31:59] is when we try and do it on our own
[1:32:01] because we're beaten. We're defeated. We
[1:32:04] have been. We always will be. But I can
[1:32:05] do all things through Christ which
[1:32:06] strengthens me. We go down in prayer. We
[1:32:08] say, "Lord, I'm looking to you. Lord,
[1:32:10] I'm taking you at your word. Lord, I'm
[1:32:11] trusting your word. I'm trusting your
[1:32:13] faith. I'm trusting the uncction of your
[1:32:14] spirit." And we press forward. That's
[1:32:16] what makes demons tremble because now
[1:32:18] the Holy Spirit is the token that you
[1:32:19] place before you. And that's what drives
[1:32:21] it out. It's not me that does it. It's
[1:32:23] the spirit that lies within me. Amen.
[1:32:25] The Holy Spirit's there to resist the
[1:32:27] devil. Recognize that when you're in
[1:32:29] Christ and he's in you, nothing can
[1:32:31] stand before you.
[1:32:33] He's going to let it serve its purpose,
[1:32:34] but in the end, nothing can stand before
[1:32:36] you. So, what I'm saying when I say
[1:32:38] don't fight alone is I'm saying don't
[1:32:40] forget you're never alone. Jesus said,
[1:32:43] "I'll never leave you or forsake you.
[1:32:45] I'll come to you." That's his promise to
[1:32:47] the believer. Remember the rapture
[1:32:49] revelation of the bride is what? Who she
[1:32:51] is, brother? When she said that when she
[1:32:55] re re when she realizes who she is, he
[1:32:58] says she'll become an invincible army.
[1:33:02] And we're going to get into that in our
[1:33:04] series on dominion. What does that
[1:33:05] revelation look like and what does it do
[1:33:07] inside of our lives? Amen. But as I said
[1:33:09] in the service uh on uh whenever it was
[1:33:11] this weekend that just as Satan turned
[1:33:14] the heart of a woman, God in this dark
[1:33:16] and evil age is turning the heart of a
[1:33:18] bride back to him. And she's recognizing
[1:33:21] who she is. And when she recognizes
[1:33:23] that, that's when she becomes an
[1:33:25] invincible army. We've only tasted it.
[1:33:28] We've only tasted it. But there's a
[1:33:30] fullness that's coming. He says this
[1:33:33] now, Father God, we would not only pray
[1:33:35] for these here, but for those stretched
[1:33:37] out across the world that are needy both
[1:33:39] spiritually and physically. He says,
[1:33:42] "Give to them, oh Lord, the desires of
[1:33:43] their heart because thy children are
[1:33:45] struggling in these days." He says, "The
[1:33:49] oppression of the enemy is so strong."
[1:33:54] That's a negative testimony.
[1:33:56] So finish it. The oppression of the
[1:33:58] enemy is so strong, but thou art
[1:34:02] stronger. He says, for it is written,
[1:34:04] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:34:06] that's in the world. He says, by this,
[1:34:09] by this, and only this, we overcome,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; recognizing that he's in us. Brother Ram
[1:34:14] says, he says, you're always pointing
[1:34:16] how wicked the world is getting. He
[1:34:19] says, but you fail to see how powerful
[1:34:21] the church is getting. At the same time,
[1:34:25] she's rising up, standing on the field.
[1:34:29] We're preaching, hold the line. She's
[1:34:31] rising up, standing on the field. He
[1:34:33] says, "Oh, she's a little flock,
[1:34:35] but brother," he says, "God is with
[1:34:38] her." That's the difference. That's the
[1:34:42] difference. It's a little flock. You
[1:34:43] look at 300 Spartans against 120,000.
[1:34:48] It's a little flock, but God is with
[1:34:51] her. He says, "And she is going to
[1:34:53] triumph just as certain as Christ rose
[1:34:57] from the dead." He says, "Amen." He
[1:35:00] said, "God's church shall never fail.
[1:35:03] The gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:35:05] against it." He said, "Show they would
[1:35:07] be against it."
[1:35:09] See, this is what I'm saying. You can't
[1:35:10] say we're not in a battle. He says
[1:35:12] they're going to be against it, but they
[1:35:15] cannot prevail. The church is going to
[1:35:18] triumph through the blood of Jesus with
[1:35:20] a victory mark. He says, "I'm positive
[1:35:22] of this one thing that God will have a
[1:35:25] church without spot, wrinkle, or
[1:35:28] blemish." He says, "Amen. I'm so happy
[1:35:31] about that.
[1:35:33] They will be against it, but they cannot
[1:35:36] prevail." Brother was saying another
[1:35:38] quote, he says, "The church is Christ's
[1:35:41] victory."
[1:35:43] That's a wonderful thought.
[1:35:46] Not that you just have victory. You are
[1:35:48] victory. You embody the victory of
[1:35:51] Christ in this final age. You say,
[1:35:53] "Well, I haven't won yet, Brother John,
[1:35:58] right? I haven't won yet."
[1:36:02] Yes, but you haven't lost yet either.
[1:36:05] And look at everyone else that's fallen.
[1:36:07] Look at everyone else that has tried and
[1:36:09] failed. And look at everyone else that
[1:36:11] doesn't even try. Church, the reason
[1:36:14] you're fighting is because there's
[1:36:15] something inside you that cries out.
[1:36:18] There's something inside of you that's
[1:36:19] placed there before the foundation of
[1:36:21] the world that says there's more to this
[1:36:23] life than what Satan offers. And when he
[1:36:26] sends you his word and you say that's
[1:36:28] it, something rises up and you start to
[1:36:30] stand and you start to fight and you
[1:36:32] start to press and you start to believe
[1:36:33] and you start to take faith and you
[1:36:35] start to pray and you start to trust and
[1:36:37] you start to act on it.
[1:36:40] Not everyone does that.
[1:36:43] Children of God do that. That's what's
[1:36:45] happening inside of your lives. Amen. If
[1:36:47] you're so weak, why are you still
[1:36:49] standing?
[1:36:54] If you got so little faith, why are you
[1:36:55] still believing?
[1:36:58] If you got so little worship, why are
[1:37:00] you still singing?
[1:37:02] You're still here. You're still doing
[1:37:04] it. Even if you're going through the
[1:37:07] form and tradition, you still haven't
[1:37:10] fallen yet. You still haven't given up.
[1:37:14] If you're so weak, why haven't you
[1:37:15] failed yet?
[1:37:17] Why haven't you given up? It's because
[1:37:19] it's not you. It's Christ in you that
[1:37:21] keeps you going. There's something
[1:37:22] inside of you. Amen. And it keeps you
[1:37:24] saying, "I believe God's word." Even
[1:37:26] when, like Abraham, there is nothing to
[1:37:28] support what you're believing,
[1:37:32] church. If you're still here and you're
[1:37:34] still believing, you're winning. And
[1:37:36] Satan hates it. Satan hates it. Brother
[1:37:39] Bram says this. Now, Paul's speaking
[1:37:40] here of the law being a shadow of the
[1:37:42] good things to come. He said could never
[1:37:44] make the worshipper perfect. Then he
[1:37:46] goes on to show what the perfection is.
[1:37:48] He says now it's a strange thing that
[1:37:51] this is so much thought of of people.
[1:37:53] They say well I'm weak. My faith is not
[1:37:56] very much. I'm not a very good
[1:37:59] Christian.
[1:38:01] I don't want you to show your hands
[1:38:03] tonight.
[1:38:05] But I want you to look internally and
[1:38:06] think of have I ever thought that?
[1:38:10] I'll raise my hand.
[1:38:12] I'm not asking you to.
[1:38:15] But there's times where we think, "Boy,
[1:38:19] there's not much happening here."
[1:38:23] He says, "That's just what the devil
[1:38:26] wants you to say. You're talking his
[1:38:28] language, right?" Then he said, then he
[1:38:30] says, "See, you must never say that."
[1:38:37] Can you say that with me? You must never
[1:38:41] say that. If you've said it, don't say
[1:38:45] it again.
[1:38:47] He says, "Don't never let your testimony
[1:38:50] be negative. Let it be positive all the
[1:38:52] time." I know you've heard this, but I
[1:38:54] want to read it. I am saved. I have God
[1:38:57] in my heart. I believe him with all my
[1:38:59] heart. He says, "Do you believe in
[1:39:00] divine healing?" With all my heart. Let
[1:39:02] your testimony always and your thoughts,
[1:39:05] everything, be positive. Never permit a
[1:39:08] negative thought to come in your mind if
[1:39:10] you can help it. And then not watch what
[1:39:12] he says next. When it starts that why
[1:39:16] because you can't stop it because it
[1:39:19] does not come from you. It comes from an
[1:39:20] outside influence. But when it starts
[1:39:23] that he says don't entertain it. Well
[1:39:25] you say I can't help the thoughts from
[1:39:27] coming like my thoughts on Monday
[1:39:29] getting all worked up over something
[1:39:31] silly.
[1:39:33] I can't stop the thoughts but I can
[1:39:35] recognize where they come from. and then
[1:39:37] I can push them back where they came
[1:39:38] from. He says, "Well, that'd be like the
[1:39:40] little farmer that said he couldn't stop
[1:39:42] the birds from flying over his place,
[1:39:44] but he sure could stop them from
[1:39:45] roosting. You can't help the thoughts
[1:39:47] when they come, but don't entertain
[1:39:49] them. Just pass it on." No, sir. Jesus
[1:39:52] Christ is my savior. All things are mine
[1:39:54] by God, and I'm going to keep them. I'm
[1:39:58] going to testify of them. He says, "And
[1:40:00] God can only bless you as you confess
[1:40:02] what he has done it for you." See, he's
[1:40:04] the high priest of our confession. Is
[1:40:06] that right? Hebrews 3, he said that he's
[1:40:08] the high priest of our confession. He
[1:40:10] can only do for us as we accept it and
[1:40:14] believe it and confess it. I was talking
[1:40:17] with brother Aaron about this and and
[1:40:19] the response that we have to to
[1:40:21] adversity to our to symptoms to to push
[1:40:24] back from Satan is often the real
[1:40:26] turning point in the battle
[1:40:29] because so often what happens is you
[1:40:31] gain some ground but then you always get
[1:40:33] a big push back.
[1:40:36] It's like the Toronto Maple Leafs. They
[1:40:38] can never hold a lead.
[1:40:40] And sometimes as believers what happens
[1:40:42] is we get ahead and then we stop trying.
[1:40:45] And what happens is when we get that
[1:40:47] inevitable push back, we say, "Oh, well,
[1:40:49] I guess I wasn't healed. I guess I
[1:40:52] didn't receive the Holy Ghost. I guess
[1:40:54] I'm not really a child of God. I guess I
[1:40:56] wasn't delivered. I guess I didn't get
[1:40:57] the victory." That's when we lose.
[1:41:01] He's telling me a story of a man that
[1:41:02] had a wonderful touch from God and then
[1:41:05] a little while later, the symptoms came
[1:41:06] back and that's exactly what he said.
[1:41:08] And he says he's been miserable ever
[1:41:09] since. I'm not saying that to to to push
[1:41:12] you down. I'm saying don't let that push
[1:41:15] you down. There's always a push back.
[1:41:18] Brother Bram would say when you've been
[1:41:19] healed often times you feel worse than
[1:41:21] the next little while before you feel
[1:41:22] better.
[1:41:26] Apply that any way you want.
[1:41:28] Listen, if you've been backslid, you're
[1:41:30] probably going to feel worse for a
[1:41:31] little while when you start to go
[1:41:32] through your life and you start to to to
[1:41:34] ask God to to straighten things out or
[1:41:36] or clean things up or take things out.
[1:41:38] There's often some guilt associated with
[1:41:40] those things. feelings of inadequacy of
[1:41:42] not deserving it and Satan will use that
[1:41:45] to push back. Don't do it. Don't accept
[1:41:47] that. Amen. What What is it? What is it?
[1:41:51] Brother Brand would talk about those
[1:41:52] that go through a prayer line. He says,
[1:41:53] "And they would get healed and they'd
[1:41:55] lose their their healing a week later as
[1:41:57] the symptoms came back or as things got
[1:42:00] worse before they got better." Feelings,
[1:42:03] just the body, the flesh, right? And
[1:42:06] they'd lose it. What's a symptom? It's
[1:42:08] Satan trying to take back land that you
[1:42:10] took from him last night. It's Satan
[1:42:13] trying to claim back the land that God's
[1:42:14] given you. That's what a symptom is.
[1:42:17] He's trying to take something back that
[1:42:19] he has no right to. You've got to let
[1:42:20] him take it. He says, "What is confess?"
[1:42:24] Confess is to say the same thing. That's
[1:42:27] what a confession is. Confess is to say
[1:42:28] the same thing he said. He says, "Say
[1:42:32] what he said. Don't say what your
[1:42:35] feelings say.
[1:42:37] Don't say what your neighbor says. Say
[1:42:39] what God said. Confess it and believe
[1:42:41] it. Don't look at your symptoms. The
[1:42:43] symptoms are the worst thing God has to
[1:42:45] fight against. Symptoms. He says,
[1:42:46] "Everybody says, "Well, I was praying
[1:42:48] for it, but my hands know better. It'll
[1:42:50] never be like that." He says, "Never
[1:42:52] will. You're looking at your hand. Don't
[1:42:54] look at your hand. Look at what God
[1:42:56] said." He says, "What if Abraham's head
[1:42:58] now Sarah?" And now he had lived with
[1:43:00] her for years since she was about 17, 18
[1:43:02] years old. Here she was 65 now, many
[1:43:04] years past menopause. see if she's going
[1:43:06] to have children she'd have had it then
[1:43:08] they were both sterile and he said well
[1:43:10] how could she have the baby what if he
[1:43:12] had said that why it's the first month
[1:43:14] passed and said Sarah how are you
[1:43:15] feeling she said no different well I
[1:43:17] guess maybe it wasn't God that talked to
[1:43:19] me he says oh my God couldn't have put
[1:43:21] his confidence in Abraham he says but no
[1:43:24] matter what Sarah's condition was it was
[1:43:27] not Sarah's condition he was looking at
[1:43:30] it was the promise that God had made
[1:43:32] that he was looking at it isn't the
[1:43:34] condition of your hand or your ear or
[1:43:37] your cancer or whatever it is. It's
[1:43:40] God's word you're looking at. He says
[1:43:42] God said so. He says, "Now, don't try to
[1:43:45] bluff it. It won't take bluffing, but if
[1:43:47] you've got the goods, it'll recognize
[1:43:48] it." That's right. He says, "You've got
[1:43:51] to have the real goods." Remember your
[1:43:53] training. Remember what God said. Amen.
[1:43:56] We preached on so many things in the
[1:43:58] past five years. We preached on
[1:44:00] overcomers. We preached on the Holy
[1:44:02] Ghost. We preached on redemption. We
[1:44:03] preached on manifestation of the sons of
[1:44:06] God. A and we've covered many of these
[1:44:07] things and so much of it has covered how
[1:44:10] we fight and overcome. And we're getting
[1:44:12] back into it again in in this series on
[1:44:14] dominion. Amen. But I'm trying to remind
[1:44:16] you tonight of what the Holy Spirit has
[1:44:18] said so many times by the word.
[1:44:21] Remember, you're equipped to overcome if
[1:44:25] you'll do it the way you've been taught.
[1:44:27] If you'll hold fast to what he's taught
[1:44:29] you to do, to what God has given you to
[1:44:31] fight with. Abraham, he quotes Mark 16.
[1:44:34] He says, "You know, these signs shall
[1:44:36] follow them that believe and they'll
[1:44:38] cast out devils, speak with new tongues,
[1:44:40] if they they take up serpents or any
[1:44:42] deadly thing and and whatnot." He says
[1:44:44] that settles it. Be certain of God. Be
[1:44:47] sure that in your heart that you believe
[1:44:49] that that's God's word.
[1:44:51] I'll say this, repetition works well.
[1:44:56] We talked about staying prayed up,
[1:44:57] staying in a spiritual atmosphere.
[1:44:59] Church, you don't have to read a
[1:45:00] scripture once. Sometimes we need to
[1:45:02] read it 10 or 15 times.
[1:45:05] Let me say this. If you are fighting a
[1:45:07] particular battle, if you have claimed a
[1:45:09] particular ground, if you are holding
[1:45:11] fast to a particular promise, find that
[1:45:14] in the word and put it someplace where
[1:45:16] you can read it constantly. Sisters, put
[1:45:19] it up on your fridge. Brothers, put it
[1:45:21] in your phone. Put it in put it in your
[1:45:24] wallet. Uh tape it to your to your car
[1:45:26] steering wheel. do something where you
[1:45:28] can remind yourself this is what I
[1:45:31] believe and keep reminding yourself
[1:45:33] because Satan's going to try and get you
[1:45:35] to believe everything except that. And
[1:45:36] if you can keep that in front of you,
[1:45:38] it'll keep the sword of the word
[1:45:40] fighting the battle and it'll keep your
[1:45:42] mind freshly prepared for what Satan's
[1:45:44] trying to take away from you. He says,
[1:45:47] "Be certain that in your heart that you
[1:45:49] believe that that's God's word." He says
[1:45:50] Job was his wife said, "Why don't you
[1:45:52] curse him and die? why you're getting
[1:45:54] worse all the time. He says, "How Satan
[1:45:58] likes to throw that at you? Why you're
[1:46:00] no better than you were when you were
[1:46:01] anointed? You're no better than you were
[1:46:03] when those preachers prayed for you.
[1:46:04] Those preachers aren't right in the
[1:46:06] first place.
[1:46:12] It doesn't matter about that preacher."
[1:46:16] He said, "It's your faith in the living
[1:46:19] God what counts. It's not what the
[1:46:21] preacher is. It's what God is. The
[1:46:24] preacher never made the promise. I love
[1:46:27] what brother Daryl Ward said. He says,
[1:46:29] "My responsibility is to pray the prayer
[1:46:33] of faith." That's what I'm told to do.
[1:46:35] He says it's up to God to bring it.
[1:46:38] I'm here to pray in faith.
[1:46:41] But he says it's up to God to do it. He
[1:46:43] says it's not what the preacher is, it's
[1:46:44] what God is. The preacher ne never made
[1:46:46] the promise. God made the promise. It's
[1:46:49] not up to the preacher. It's up to God
[1:46:51] and your faith to believe that that is
[1:46:53] God. He says, "So, be certain of God. Be
[1:46:55] certain that it's God and that's God's
[1:46:57] word." He says, "And God is in his
[1:47:00] word." That's why I'm saying if you're
[1:47:01] in a battle, if you're in a fight, if
[1:47:02] you're claiming your territory, take it
[1:47:05] out of the word and put it and let
[1:47:08] yourself meditate on it day and night.
[1:47:11] Here's what I do.
[1:47:14] I have a song that I go to if things are
[1:47:16] not going well. And it's that song in
[1:47:19] the presence of Jehovah.
[1:47:21] And whenever I can be in the shower, I
[1:47:23] can be driving, I can be fighting
[1:47:25] things, whatever. It doesn't matter.
[1:47:28] That is my go-to song because in the
[1:47:31] presence of Jehovah is when everything's
[1:47:33] taken care of. You get into the presence
[1:47:35] of God, it'll take care of the
[1:47:37] situation. It'll settle you. It'll calm
[1:47:38] you. It doesn't matter not. David said,
[1:47:40] "Yay, though I walk through the valley
[1:47:42] of the shadow of death, thou art with
[1:47:43] me. As long as I know he's there, that
[1:47:45] settles me." And so I have a go-to. And
[1:47:49] so I'm telling you tonight, get a go-to.
[1:47:52] Get a scripture. Get a song and say,
[1:47:55] when these things come, I'm going to
[1:47:57] sing this song. I'm going to read this
[1:47:58] scripture. I'm going to read this quote.
[1:48:00] Whatever it is that has given you faith,
[1:48:02] whatever it is that you're holding on
[1:48:04] to, take it and put it in a place where
[1:48:06] you can remember it. You can read it.
[1:48:08] You can recite it. You can sing it. And
[1:48:10] that doesn't mean I I'm driving in, you
[1:48:12] know, or I'm sitting in my office at
[1:48:13] work and I'm singing in the presence.
[1:48:16] No, but in my head I am.
[1:48:18] When I'm in the shower, definitely I'm
[1:48:20] going to sing it. If you're in the
[1:48:22] house, you're going to sing it, aren't
[1:48:22] you, Selena? We're going to sing a song.
[1:48:25] Well, hey, if we've got a place we can
[1:48:26] sing it, let's sing it.
[1:48:29] You know, we're supposed to speak.
[1:48:32] There is power that comes with actually
[1:48:34] saying it, not just thinking it. I have
[1:48:38] found, you know, in my my devotion time
[1:48:39] in the mornings, sometimes I pray
[1:48:42] silently, but I have found it so much
[1:48:44] more effective if I can pray out loud.
[1:48:47] When we're here, how powerful is it when
[1:48:50] people pray out loud,
[1:48:55] you've got to speak. You got to let
[1:48:57] Satan know which side you're on. And not
[1:48:58] just up here. You got to speak out. You
[1:49:01] got to let him know.
[1:49:03] I I think it was Brother Garfield,
[1:49:05] wasn't it? when you were when you were a
[1:49:06] boy and you were sick and you took that
[1:49:07] word and you laid it on you. He
[1:49:09] physically laid it on him. That's what
[1:49:11] happens when you speak the word is
[1:49:13] you're physically declaring we're at war
[1:49:16] and here's what I'm fighting with
[1:49:19] and that's all I'm going to fight with.
[1:49:20] I'm not going to reason.
[1:49:23] I'm not going to debate. This is what
[1:49:26] the word says and I'm going to keep
[1:49:27] swinging that sword until your head's
[1:49:29] cut off. That's what we do. That's what
[1:49:31] an overcomer does. Amen.
[1:49:34] I want to make sure you're not looking
[1:49:36] at me tonight. You're not looking at
[1:49:38] brother Aaron. You're not looking at
[1:49:39] Billian Puy. You're not looking at
[1:49:40] brother Jonathan Martin. Whichever
[1:49:41] minister's been here recently. You've
[1:49:43] got to have your faith settled on one
[1:49:45] foundation, and that is Christ, the
[1:49:47] living word in your life. In your life.
[1:49:52] Amen. Us brothers, as preachers, we're
[1:49:54] called to sew the seed. As parents,
[1:49:56] we're called to sew the seed. But it's
[1:49:57] God that gives the increase. He's the
[1:49:58] only one that can bring light into
[1:50:00] darkness and life into death. That's
[1:50:02] what he does. That's his purpose. That's
[1:50:04] his attributes. Here's what the word
[1:50:07] says about you. And we're closing.
[1:50:10] He says, "Now we have received not the
[1:50:13] spirit of the world, but the spirit
[1:50:15] which is of God." Can we say amen to
[1:50:17] that? Why have we been given that? That
[1:50:21] we might know the things that are freely
[1:50:25] given to us of God.
[1:50:30] that we might know the things that are
[1:50:32] freely given to us of God. In other
[1:50:35] words, it's not based on our goodness.
[1:50:38] It's not based on our performance.
[1:50:40] It's not based on our family heritage.
[1:50:42] It is not based on the ministry we sit
[1:50:44] under. It is not based on our religion.
[1:50:47] It is based on one thing. He gave us his
[1:50:50] spirit and that's his grace that does
[1:50:52] it. That's the only thing that counts
[1:50:55] here is that he gave us his spirit. so
[1:50:59] that we could personally experience the
[1:51:02] things that are freely given to us of
[1:51:03] God. Every redemptive blessing belongs
[1:51:07] to a child of God freely.
[1:51:10] Freely
[1:51:12] without money, without price. The
[1:51:14] scripture says you don't have to pay
[1:51:16] anything for it. If I
[1:51:19] told you tomorrow,
[1:51:22] the Avalon Mall is mine.
[1:51:27] Now, here's here's a little note from me
[1:51:32] and you go in there and you can take
[1:51:35] whatever you want. It's freely given.
[1:51:40] Would we go to Starbucks and get a small
[1:51:43] hot chocolate and then go to the shoe
[1:51:46] store and find a moderately priced pair
[1:51:48] of shoes and then go buy a cheap ski
[1:51:50] jacket and walk out the door?
[1:51:54] If you knew and you believed what I said
[1:51:57] that I own the Avalon Mall and
[1:51:59] everything in there belongs to me and
[1:52:01] you can have whatever you want, what
[1:52:03] would you do?
[1:52:05] First of all, we cover all the pictures
[1:52:07] we shouldn't see.
[1:52:10] And then we would say,
[1:52:13] "Where's your biggest cart?"
[1:52:17] And we would back our personal vehicle
[1:52:19] up to the doors and we would go from
[1:52:21] store to store. And we would get
[1:52:24] anything that we wanted,
[1:52:27] everything we needed, everything our
[1:52:30] family wanted or needed, everything our
[1:52:32] friends or family wanted. We'd be
[1:52:34] calling them up. I'd be calling up,
[1:52:35] "Brother Bob, is there anything in the
[1:52:37] Avalon Mall that you would like
[1:52:40] cuz I've been told I can have whatever I
[1:52:42] want."
[1:52:44] We wouldn't be walking out with three
[1:52:46] items.
[1:52:48] We'd be walking out with everything our
[1:52:51] hearts desired,
[1:52:53] wouldn't we?
[1:52:56] Paul says, "That's what the Holy
[1:52:57] Spirit's for. So you can walk into the
[1:53:00] things of God and take whatever you want
[1:53:04] and whatever you need to keep walking
[1:53:08] this walk.
[1:53:10] That's his promise to you. Amen.
[1:53:15] Paul said it's given that you should
[1:53:17] know.
[1:53:19] Not just believe.
[1:53:23] Not just believe that you would know.
[1:53:26] That you would know. That you would
[1:53:27] know. that you would have a personal
[1:53:28] experience by knowledge by experience of
[1:53:32] these things that it's real.
[1:53:37] And if it's freely given,
[1:53:40] he wants us to just come up and say, "I
[1:53:42] need that and take it.
[1:53:46] I want that and take it." Brother Bram
[1:53:49] talked about it going into that store.
[1:53:50] If you knew that everything in there was
[1:53:52] free, you'd take whatever you wanted.
[1:53:54] Amen.
[1:53:55] walk out and say, "That's exactly what I
[1:53:58] was looking for." And go home content.
[1:54:01] That's what God's wanting you to do. Be
[1:54:03] content with the gifts and the blessings
[1:54:05] that he's freely given.
[1:54:08] Not go and justify it.
[1:54:12] If it's free, it's free. Have Have you
[1:54:15] ever walked up to something where
[1:54:16] something was free and you felt guilty
[1:54:17] even taking the one, much less two or
[1:54:20] three? You know why? Because we always
[1:54:23] feel we've got to justify it. If you're
[1:54:24] in Costco and you take two samples, it
[1:54:27] might be for you, but you know what you
[1:54:28] say? Yeah, I'm taking one for my wife.
[1:54:32] We justify it. Freely given. You don't
[1:54:36] have to justify.
[1:54:38] You don't have to say, "I'm taking my
[1:54:40] healing because I'm a really good
[1:54:42] Christian.
[1:54:46] I'm taking deliverance because I pay my
[1:54:48] tithes." No, it's freely given. You
[1:54:51] don't have to justify what's freely
[1:54:53] given. You don't have to say, "Look at
[1:54:55] my track record. I've had a tremendous
[1:54:58] week, Lord. I'm going to take some more
[1:55:00] of what's freely given to me." No, it's
[1:55:02] for the taking. It's free for the
[1:55:04] taking. Brother puts it this way.
[1:55:08] He says, "That's what the Christian
[1:55:10] does.
[1:55:12] When you're planted in Christ Jesus,
[1:55:14] everything you have need of in journey
[1:55:16] is in you. When you receive the Holy
[1:55:19] Spirit, he says the only thing you have
[1:55:21] to do is drink, drink, push out, push
[1:55:26] out. Just drink till you can't drink no
[1:55:30] more. I'm a big drinker.
[1:55:34] I've always said it's a good thing I
[1:55:35] haven't haven't been around alcohol.
[1:55:37] Maybe I'd be an alcoholic. I don't want
[1:55:38] to say that. But I love to drink. And so
[1:55:41] when we go to a a fellowship or
[1:55:43] something, if there's a lot, I'm going
[1:55:44] to drink a lot. But there's a little I'm
[1:55:47] going to hold back to make sure I'm not
[1:55:48] taking away from somebody else. But if
[1:55:50] we get to the end of the fellowship and
[1:55:52] that punch bowl still got this in there,
[1:55:54] guess who's going to finish that? This
[1:55:56] guy. Cuz I love to drink. It's free. I
[1:55:59] love it. He's saying, "Listen. All you
[1:56:03] have to do is drink and drink. Don't
[1:56:05] justify it.
[1:56:08] Don't try and explain it. If you're
[1:56:10] thirsty, just drink. That's it. Drink
[1:56:14] until you're not thirsty. Drink until
[1:56:16] you can't hold anymore. He says, "If you
[1:56:18] have need of divine healing, go to God's
[1:56:19] word and drink from it until you push
[1:56:21] out. If you need more of God, just keep
[1:56:24] drinking, pushing out." He says, "Christ
[1:56:26] is the inexhaustible fountain of life.
[1:56:31] There are some things I love to drink.
[1:56:34] There are some, you know, I try and stay
[1:56:35] away from pop and these different
[1:56:36] things, but boy, there's some juices.
[1:56:39] I'd just drink the whole thing if you
[1:56:40] let me do it. I wouldn't even eat
[1:56:42] anything at a meal. I just sit there and
[1:56:43] drink some of these things
[1:56:46] cuz there's something in me. He just
[1:56:48] likes it.
[1:56:51] He's saying, "You got the same
[1:56:52] opportunity.
[1:56:53] Just keep drinking. Keep drinking till
[1:56:56] you're satisfied. Keep drinking till
[1:56:57] you're content. Keep drinking till
[1:56:59] something comes out of it." He says, "If
[1:57:02] you're planted in him, the only thing
[1:57:03] you have to do is drink of his goodness
[1:57:06] and push out whatever you have need of
[1:57:08] in this earth's journey." I love this.
[1:57:10] He says it's all drinking, resting,
[1:57:14] peace.
[1:57:16] It's not what you struggle and strive
[1:57:17] and pull at. He says you defeat the very
[1:57:20] purpose that you're representing when
[1:57:21] you do that. Christianity is not
[1:57:24] something and God's not one you have to
[1:57:26] beg and cry and plead and fast and
[1:57:30] starve and everything like that to get
[1:57:33] to. He says certainly not. Why? Because
[1:57:37] it's freely given.
[1:57:40] Brother Abraham says God wants to give
[1:57:42] you the Holy Ghost more than you want
[1:57:43] it. God wants to bless you more than you
[1:57:45] want to bless it want a blessing. His
[1:57:48] desire is to give you good things.
[1:57:51] But the greatest thing is eternal life.
[1:57:53] The greatest thing is to be in
[1:57:54] relationship with him. And so all things
[1:57:56] come under that. But freely given means
[1:57:58] you don't have to justify taking it. You
[1:58:00] just have to say, "Lord, I'm accepting
[1:58:02] it." and walk out the door with it and
[1:58:04] say, "Lord, I thank you for providing
[1:58:07] for my need, for my heart's desire."
[1:58:09] Amen. God bless you. Let's stand
[1:58:11] together if we would.
[1:58:14] What I love about Freely Giving is you
[1:58:17] don't have to feel guilty that you don't
[1:58:20] deserve it.
[1:58:23] When they just give it to you, they
[1:58:25] don't look into your life. You know,
[1:58:26] when you're in Costco, they don't say,
[1:58:28] "Now, sir, could you afford this on your
[1:58:30] own? Maybe we should leave this for
[1:58:32] those that are maybe a little less
[1:58:34] wellto-do.
[1:58:36] You know, sir, your suit's a little too
[1:58:37] nice.
[1:58:39] Why don't you just buy this and we'll
[1:58:40] let the samples go to those that are a
[1:58:42] little more ragged looking? Right.
[1:58:44] Brother Chad went to Costco tonight.
[1:58:46] They wouldn't say, "No, sir. You're too
[1:58:47] wealthy looking. You can't have any
[1:58:49] samples." No, it's freely given for one
[1:58:51] and all. There's full equality at Costco
[1:58:53] when it comes to samples. God's the same
[1:58:56] way. He's not giving more to those.
[1:59:00] He doesn't heal those that are better
[1:59:02] Christians.
[1:59:04] Children of God, their daily bread is
[1:59:07] his healing.
[1:59:09] God doesn't deliver you because you're
[1:59:11] better than the person next to you. God
[1:59:14] doesn't save you
[1:59:17] because you're better. It's his
[1:59:19] unmmerited grace. It's his favor that we
[1:59:22] don't deserve. And so when we look at
[1:59:24] holding the line, what's he saying here?
[1:59:28] Just keep feeding,
[1:59:32] keep praying, keep reading, keep
[1:59:35] listening, keep confessing, keep
[1:59:38] testifying.
[1:59:40] It's simple. It's straightforward. It's
[1:59:44] not heroic. It's not a grand gesture.
[1:59:46] It's just a day by day steadiness
[1:59:50] of abiding in Christ. That's really what
[1:59:52] it is. Amen. Stay close to him. He's the
[1:59:57] one that's going to help you hold the
[1:59:58] line tonight. Amen.
[2:00:01] Scripture says he'll never leave us or
[2:00:03] forsake us. I love what brother Aaron
[2:00:04] reminded us. He says you'll never be
[2:00:06] ashamed when you trust God. That's what
[2:00:08] he said and that's what we're trusting
[2:00:10] him to do tonight. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:00:12] heads. Heavenly Father, [snorts]
[2:00:15] Lord, we're thankful for the ground that
[2:00:17] we've gained. Lord, we're thankful for
[2:00:19] the victories that we have. Lord, we're
[2:00:21] thankful for the faith that you placed
[2:00:23] in our hearts. Lord, we're thankful for
[2:00:25] a word that encourages us, Lord, that
[2:00:28] places us, that positions us, that lets
[2:00:30] us know what belongs to us, heavenly
[2:00:32] father. And Lord, I'm asking your grace
[2:00:34] once again tonight, Lord, that you would
[2:00:36] encourage us, Lord, that you would rise
[2:00:38] our faith up, Lord. That you would help
[2:00:40] us to stand on that which we've
[2:00:42] overcome, Lord. And as Paul said, Lord,
[2:00:44] we would press, we would push, Lord, to
[2:00:48] take one more step, Lord, just another
[2:00:50] bit closer tonight. Lord, I'm thankful
[2:00:53] for this wonderful people. Lord, I'm
[2:00:55] thankful for your presence and for your
[2:00:56] word. Lord, I pray that as we would just
[2:00:59] worship you for a while, heavenly
[2:01:01] father, that you would just encourage
[2:01:02] us, Lord. Help us to to just uh Lord,
[2:01:06] just hold ourselves, Lord, before you,
[2:01:09] Lord, and ask for your your strength day
[2:01:11] by day, Lord, that you keep a positive
[2:01:13] confession and testimony before us,
[2:01:16] Lord. That we keep your word before us
[2:01:17] day by day, Lord. that we be able to
[2:01:20] worship and praise you, Lord, in every
[2:01:22] struggle, trial, and battle that comes
[2:01:24] our way. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank
[2:01:26] you for testimonies. Lord, we thank you
[2:01:27] for healing. We thank you for your touch
[2:01:29] on Sister Kimberly. Lord, we are
[2:01:31] thankful that you're a living God that
[2:01:33] answers us. Lord, we pray you just
[2:01:35] continue to be with us to hold the line.
[2:01:37] In Jesus Christ's name, we ask it. Amen.
[2:01:41] Thank you, Jesus, for the grace you have
[2:01:44] given us. 10:21
[2:01:51] Thank
[2:01:53] you
[2:01:55] Jesus
[2:02:00] for the [singing] grace that you have
[2:02:05] given us.
[2:02:09] though I can't repay. But from my heart,
[2:02:14] I'd like [music] to say that I
[2:02:20] thank you.
[2:02:25] Thank

[2:03:46] given us.
[2:03:49] [singing]
[2:03:50] Oh, I can't [music] repay. But from my
[2:03:54] heart, I'd like to say that I
[2:04:00] thank you.

[2:09:19] [music]
[2:09:22] I
[2:09:23] will praise
[2:09:25] the Lord. [singing]
[2:09:30] No matter what tomorrow
[2:09:32] [music and singing] brings,
[2:09:35] what it has in store,
[2:09:38] I
[2:09:40] will praise
[2:09:42] the Lord.
[2:09:46] I will [music and singing] praise
[2:09:50] the Lord.
[2:09:53] [music]
[2:09:54] I [singing]
[2:09:56] will praise
[2:09:58] the Lord [music]
[2:10:02] no matter what tomorrow brings
[2:10:07] what it has in store. [singing]
[2:10:11] I [music] will praise
[2:10:14] the Lord. Sing it one more time.
[2:10:19] I will praise [singing and music]
[2:10:22] the Lord.
[2:10:27] I will praise
[2:10:30] the Lord.
[2:10:34] No matter what tomorrow brings,
[2:10:39] what it has in store,
[2:10:43] I [music]
[2:10:44] will [singing] praise
[2:10:46] the Lord.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Before we close in prayer, we're
[2:10:52] going to sing that song, So Glad I'm
[2:10:53] Yours, Lord, number 48. Brother Paul,
[2:10:55] I'm going to ask you to close in prayer
[2:10:57] tonight if you would. Amen. Remember the
[2:10:59] needs that were spoken. Remember Sister
[2:11:01] Becky. I remember brother Chad, he told
[2:11:03] me he's back in the office working. So,
[2:11:05] we praise the Lord for that. Amen. And
[2:11:08] just trusting the Lord to continue to
[2:11:10] give him a full and complete healing
[2:11:12] from that. Amen. You have each one your
[2:11:14] needs. You have each one of your
[2:11:16] situations. Keep it before him. Amen.
[2:11:19] Keep his word before you. Don't keep the
[2:11:21] situation in front of you. Keep the word
[2:11:23] before you. And that'll encourage you
[2:11:24] and it'll take you through. Amen.
[2:11:26] Remember the service coming up. Amen.
[2:11:29] Pray for one another. We're not going to
[2:11:30] have a prayer meeting this weekend
[2:11:32] because we've got youth on Sunday, but
[2:11:33] Lord willing, the following Saturday, we
[2:11:35] will. If you can come, please come.
[2:11:38] I'll tell you what, it does you good to
[2:11:40] have people pray for you, but it does
[2:11:42] you good to pray for other people as
[2:11:44] well. And it unites the body together.
[2:11:46] So, if at all possible, I definitely
[2:11:48] encourage you to come to that. Amen.
[2:11:50] Let's keep believing. Let's keep
[2:11:52] trusting. Let's keep fighting. Let's
[2:11:54] keep pressing. Amen. And hold each other
[2:11:56] up before the throne of grace. Amen.
[2:11:58] Let's sing this a couple times and
[2:11:59] brother Paul will come and pray.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; I'm so [singing] glad I'm yours,
[2:12:09] Lord. [music]
[2:12:12] So [singing] glad I'm yours.
[2:12:16] [music]
[2:12:18] I'm so glad [singing] your mercy
[2:12:26] has followed me. [music]
[2:12:32] So [music and singing] glad you found
[2:12:36] me
[2:12:39] and set me on. [music]
[2:12:46] So [singing] glad I'm yours,
[2:12:50] Lord.
[2:12:52] So [singing] glad I'm yours.
[2:12:59] I'm so [music and singing] glad I'm
[2:13:01] free,
[2:13:03] Lord.
[2:13:06] So [singing] glad I'm free.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; So glad your grace
[2:13:16] has
[2:13:18] [music] laid hold of me.
[2:13:26] I on [singing and music]
[2:13:28] was captive.
[2:13:32] I once [music and singing]
[2:13:34] was bound.
[2:13:39] up [singing] by your grace,
[2:13:43] Lord. [music]
[2:13:46] I fre.
[2:13:52] So [singing] glad [music]
[2:13:54] yours,
[2:13:56] Lord.
[2:13:58] So glad. [music]
[2:14:05] So glad your mercy.
[2:14:11] It has followed [music and singing]
[2:14:14] me.
[2:14:18] I'm so glad [singing]
[2:14:19] [music] that you found
[2:14:22] me
[2:14:25] and set [singing and music]
[2:14:27] me free.
[2:14:31] So [music and singing] glad I'm yours,
[2:14:36] Lord.
[2:14:38] So [singing and music] glad I'm yours.
[2:14:58] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord,
[2:15:00] we're just
[2:15:03] what a privileged people we are, Lord.
[2:15:09] Lord, your mercies are new every
[2:15:11] morning. And father, Lord, there is no
[2:15:15] good thing that you'll withhold from
[2:15:17] your children.
[2:15:19] And Father, Lord, we're just so thankful
[2:15:21] that you [sighs]
[2:15:23] are still in the healing business,
[2:15:24] Father.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Lord, you hear us, Lord,
[2:15:28] when we we cry out even before the words
[2:15:34] are even spoken, Lord. You hear the the
[2:15:36] cry of our heart.
[2:15:38] And Lord, this weekend, Lord, you heard
[2:15:41] the cry of my heart, Lord, for my
[2:15:43] family, Lord, and for my wife.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Praise your name.
[2:15:53] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:15:56] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, Lord.
[2:16:06] Lord, I've tried everything I can,
[2:16:09] everything I could to help her, Lord.
[2:16:10] But only you,
[2:16:12] only the great physician, Lord, can
[2:16:14] identify the thing that is needed,
[2:16:16] Father.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you brought her out of a myy
[2:16:21] pit.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; And Lord, for the first time in years,
[2:16:25] she's back in her feet needing nothing,
[2:16:28] Lord.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:16:42] Hallelujah.
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; Only you can do that, Lord.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; In a moment of time, Lord, you can take
[2:16:55] years and just make it stop.
[2:16:58] And Father, Lord, I'm just so thankful
[2:17:00] to you.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Thankful, Lord, for what you did for
[2:17:02] Chad. Lord,
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord.
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, just [gasps]
[2:17:07] how can it be that it be no damage to
[2:17:09] his heart? Lord,
[2:17:12] it's impossible.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Just thank you.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; And Lord, there scores more of stories
[2:17:29] and testimonies. Father. [snorts]
[2:17:32] And Lord, I'm just so thankful, Lord.
[2:17:37] So, Father, may you just help us as we
[2:17:39] go
[2:17:41] to fight the good fight of faith, Lord,
[2:17:42] to put on the full armor of God,
[2:17:46] Lord, to be able to just stand
[2:17:48] shoulder-to-shoulder together, Lord,
[2:17:49] because we need each other. We can't do
[2:17:51] this alone. We can't fight alone, Lord.
[2:17:55] Lord, may you knit our hearts together,
[2:17:57] Lord, in love. May every barrier be
[2:17:59] broken down. May every wall be torn down
[2:18:01] between us, Lord. And may your grace and
[2:18:04] your love just overflow, Lord, to each
[2:18:07] and every one of us, Lord. [snorts]
[2:18:10] May complexes die, Lord. May hurts just
[2:18:12] be dissolved, Lord. And may forgiveness
[2:18:15] flow.
[2:18:17] And Father, may you just
[2:18:21] help us each and every day, Lord, just
[2:18:23] to seek you with our whole heart, Lord.
[2:18:26] Yes, Lord. not to hold anything back
[2:18:29] anymore. The hour is too late.
[2:18:32] But Father, may we just each and every
[2:18:34] day just set our face, Lord, to the
[2:18:37] rising of the sun.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; And Lord, may you just grant us the
[2:18:42] strength for each step of the way,
[2:18:44] Lord. If the enemy hits us, may we just
[2:18:46] hit him back.
[2:18:48] And Lord, may we just overcome,
[2:18:52] Lord, by your word and by our testimony,
[2:18:56] Father.
[2:18:57] So, Father, may you just bless Brother
[2:18:59] John, Lord, for what he preached
[2:19:00] tonight, Lord. It was exactly what I
[2:19:01] needed to hear, Lord. And
[2:19:04] it was a wonderful word, Lord. It was
[2:19:08] just may you bless him, Lord, for the
[2:19:09] hours of service, Lord.
[2:19:13] It's a difficult position. It's a very
[2:19:14] thankless position, Lord, but he is the
[2:19:17] man for the job, Lord. And thank you
[2:19:19] that he has the heart for the people.
[2:19:23] So, Father, may you just be with us as
[2:19:24] we go. May you just bless the needs,
[2:19:26] those who need a touch. Lord, [snorts]
[2:19:28] may you just be with us as we come back
[2:19:30] again, Lord, on Sunday. We ask all these
[2:19:32] things name Jesus Christ. Amen.
