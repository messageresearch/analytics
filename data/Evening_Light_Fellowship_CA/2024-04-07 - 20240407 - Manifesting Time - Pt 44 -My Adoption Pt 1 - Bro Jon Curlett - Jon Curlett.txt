we're just here to glorify you Lord to reflect you Lord to show what it means to have a living God in our midst Lord a life changed a nature changed a mind changed desires changed Lord It's Your goodness in our lives and we thank you for it this morning Lord we ask you to just take this service speak to hearts and souls Lord God lord I can't do it I'll fail but you do all things well Lord we ask your grace Lord we thank you for victory we thank you for your leadership we thank you for your healing touch Lord we thank you for your presence Lord I pray you move in our midst now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians chapter 2 this morning Ephesians 2 want to greet all our visitors we've got brother Rex Clancy who I met at the funeral this last week and we want to say God bless you to you and sister Wanda there and we have a visitor that just walked in at the back I believe many of us know her is Sister Betty amen praise the Lord sister Betty amen at at the tender age that she is to be in and walking and moving about and whatnot I say praise the Lord for his healing touch on her hip amen and the pain that he's taking away in these different things it's wonderful to see her amen it's good to have Marilyn Taylor with us she's an old neighbor of ours old meaning from a long time ago of course amen but uh known to my family for many years and so it's good to see her here this morning amen and then we have sister relle here looking happy and healthy with baby annah amen God bless you it's good to see you as well and man I remember when we had Samuel last and Blanca just kind of went downstairs and she stayed in the spare bedroom for weeks on end and of course Co ended up shutting us down but boy when that baby comes the mama just wants to just settle in with it and leave her alone and just let them Bond and grow together but uh eventually they have to come out of their cocoons and be with the rest of us and so we see you here this morning we say God bless you it's good to see you and see brother Josh standing proudly smiling there as if it was all his work amen amen but it's good to have them here amen certainly appreciate each one that went to the funeral for brother Ivan Brenton this last week and uh we didn't have church on Wednesday here but we had church at the funeral brother Luke Gibson just spoke a tremendous short message there and sure enjoyed that and then coming back we had a blizzard for the last hour and it was uh it was pretty tight going there for a while brother Luke almost lost his truck there he said he had a pretty scary moment called us up and asked what do I do and we said put it in four-wheel drive and you'll you'll get it all worked out so he slowed down and and uh he made it safely and each one of us did so we thank the Lord for that amen we certainly want to remember brother Ron Spencer he had a second heart attack in in hospital they put in three stints now I believe he's home resting but quite weak so we certainly want to remember him as well amen God bless you this morning Ephesians 2:4 we see here the full timeline of the children of God from glory to glory and Paul says this but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins had quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye are saved he says and ha raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus no say raised us up together it's not just one person not just one Ministry it's not just one church amen but it's a body it's a group that's done this he says that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus he says for by Grace ye are you saved save through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're getting back to our series we've been talking about the manifestation of the sons of God or the manifesting time and I want to take a title of my adoption and we've been speaking on the adoption of the sons and daughters of God of the children of God and I want to make this personal now as we start to get to the end of this series and the next few Services Lord willing we want to get very personal we want to get down to where you're at where I'm at what our position is what it looks like what the purpose is and these different things and so I want to just read a couple quotes here before we get back into the the meat of this and and he would say you are first born into the kingdom he says by the Holy Ghost how many knows that all right and then he says the next you are predestinated to what adoption what is that he says you're predestinated unto the placing he would say you're baptized with the Holy Spirit you're filled with the Holy Spirit and that's purpose is to take you now to a positional place which is adoption amen we know that adoption in the scriptures just for the sake of those that haven't been sitting here for the last year listening to the preachings on this adoption in the scriptures was not as if you take a child that's outside of the family and bring it in as we have it today but adoption in the Eastern tradition was that you would take a a child that is already a part of the family you would train them you would develop them you would bring them to maturity and then you would adopt them you would place them in a position of responsibility in the family business in the family farm and the family Affairs and they would work as the father did their purpose was to take the authority of the father now and use it for the benefit of the body amen and so then the prophet of God would say this he says God and all creation is waiting for the church positionally to positionally find its place man the scripture says that creation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God everything's looking for us to find our place in Christ not find our place as we determine it or the way we think we ought to do it or or the talents we have or the good things we bring to the table but for God to place us where and with whom and in the place that he wants us to be amen that's what spiritual adoption is adoption is not about me it's when I come to a place that he can use me for the sake of the body and a person that comes into a adoption is thinking about others not themselves that's what we'll find is adoption now is for the benefit of everyone around us and so if we're coming to a place where we think we're adopted in in our position in Christ or we're about to be ready and all we can think about is me me me let me say we're not ready amen it's not about me it's about others that are around us amen we're supposed to be living our lives for others and Christ did that and he said that as I've done you should do as well amen that we're supposed to be a servant it says he came down and being Lord of all he made himself servant of all amen that's the nature that we're supposed to have and he would say this he says when we receive the Holy Ghost it isn't to jump up and down and Shout with it isn't just to speak with tongues or run over the floor it isn't to organize a group and say we got it and the rest of you haven't that's a great danger when you have truth is to stand on the fact that you have truth and let that be the deciding factor what have you're doing what are you doing with the truth what has it done to you more importantly anden if you have it and it's not doing anything then is it really the truth he says but rather it's to work the Holy Spirit has given to us to work how with love and humility as Christ come to do he says by this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for another that will cancel out a lot of people that think they've got something special if they can't even love somebody if they can't do what's best for that person if they can't in humility present what God has given to them rather than flare up as soon as it's rejected or as soon as they face hard times of persecution from people but I want to take us back now to Ephesians to settle this thought on our adoption this morning and in Ephesians 4 Paul would say this he says but speaking the truth in love he's speaking about the body of Christ we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ he said from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body under the edifying of itself in love I've always said this is one of the most difficult scriptures to understand it's such a long sentence it's a run-on sentence but I want to take that bit that I've underlined there because that's the part we want to focus on because Paul says we're a whole body that's supposed to be joined together fitly joined together it means we fit without interference we're not rubbing we're there's no friction there but each is in its place and in its season and in its proper function and they get in there and there's no friction now when God does it that's the way that God joins us together and we're compacted everything is tightly knit together I hurt my shoulders many of you know playing hockey about 6 weeks ago and guess what it's not tightly knit together anymore when I hit it the impact stretched the tendons it stretched the ligaments and now this shoulder does things that I don't want it to do and I've got to build it back and strengthen it and restore it back to what it was supposed to be but when God does it God makes everything compact so that it works and it stays in its position but this under part this is what we're looking for when it comes to maturity and adoption he says when each part I'm not responsible for you and you're not responsible for me I'm responsible for me Lord where do you want me to be and what do you want me doing and how do you want me to do it says when each part now it says with power adapted to its need so in other words I have the power I need and you have the power you need and where you need my help I give you what I have to help you do what you need as well if I go to bend over and pick something up I've got to use my arm muscles I've got to use my back muscles I've got to use my stabilizing muscles each one works together and if one of them Works harder than it ought to what causes is imbalance and I'll lean over and either I won't be able to pick up or I'll fall over why because I've overexerted or undere exerted I've applied too much power or not enough and then it's not functional he says but with power adapted to its need is working properly in all of its functions and grows to full maturity building itself up in what love love is the motive Divine love it's the Holy Spirit itself so in other words when we are positionally placed our purpose is always to help the body of Christ to make it operate in its proper function amen the purpose of each one of us being here is to help the body operate now whether we realize it or not we are all here for a purpose and we're not here to be a freak body there's a there's a you see these people and there's a well-known arm wrestler and he's a left-handed arm wrestler and his left arm is freakishly huge it's a genetic um um error in his body that has given him massive muscles on the left side and his forearm is just like this and then he's got this huge bicep and and it's he's a freak that's not the way the body's supposed to be how do we become a freak Body of Christ when we focus on one thing when we say this is the way we like it this is the way we want it this is the way it's got to be and then we just what we absolutely cause a weakness in the rest of the body because it's not developing we're so focused on what we like or what we have natural talents for or where the ease is and so what happens is we build up that which is good and we neglect that which is not and we Overlook our weaknesses and we could become afraid freak and it leads to sickness it leads to strain it it leads to breaks and these different things divisions amongst us amen we're supposed to be a body in balance a body in Harmony and that can only be done by the holy spirit because if the holy spirit's working in you and the holy spirit's working in me then there's no friction we work together and we compliment each other I don't mean compliment as in you look very good today I mean we support each other what you do and what I do is additive rather than destructive that what you do adds to what I'm doing and what I'm doing adds to what you're doing and neither one detracts but everything works together in its in its in its good intentions amen listen to this he says in the church God has set people in the church for different things he says some of them for teachers Apostles prophets Gifts of healing speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and different gifts that he God has set in the church as it pleased him he says it's all for one purpose to edify the body to edify the church to bring us together to make us love him more when somebody says I have a gift and that gift only points to themselves you know what I say that ain't a gift because you're not edifying the body with it you're edifying yourself that's why Paul would tell them don't speak with tongues all the time you're not edifying anybody you're just causing confusion nothing wrong with speaking tongues it's part of uh of the Christian experience we believe but if you speak in tongues and none interprets he says nobody's edified except for you that's it so the purpose of a gift the purpose of a a person or portion of the body is to edify is to build up that's what it means to edifies to build up to strengthen to support the body of Christ and so the more mature we get as we get into a place of stepping into adoption or as we're adopted our focus is on the benefit of the body and not ourselves amen it's a life of sacrifice it's a life of surrender and I want to speak this morning just to kind of set up us up generally with what God's trying to do with adopted Sons and Daughters of his and what the end goal is because if we can see his purpose we can see how we fit in it see what happens I think with adoption as we look at this is people think it's some lofty thing that can only be attained at the very end of your life and then you wonder what the other 70 years or 60 years are spent doing preparation preparation preparation but if you see in the scriptures you'll see that there's always a time of training and testing but there's a time of walking in your position and you look at people like David you look at people like Joseph you look at Samuel you look at these different ones you look at the the Apostle Paul yes they had times where they were training but God wants to bring us into position because it's needed to help the body function the goal is not to take us to old age and then adopt us the goal is to get us to his position and his placing in the word so that he can use us for the benefit the goal is not to exclude us the goal is to get us working for his kingdom by the power of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen I believe God's goal is to get us to that place as quickly as possible but it's in his time and in his season not in ours now Paul would talk about this in Romans 12 now he's talking about the body and the different parts of it he says I beseech you Brethren therefore by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is the reason able service you control what comes in and what goes out you control what has access to you and he says that's your reasonable service you protect this Natural Body I was speaking to somebody yesterday and they were asking you know how do these things get on a person how does a Believer get a a demon on them or or get a habit on them and I say there's two ways we can do it we walk through this Earth and we get dirty we talked about this in communion you walk through this life and you get dirty I said you can't I can't walk through them all and not get dirty it's filth everything is filth the music is filth the the ads are filth the clothing is filth everything is Satan's kingdom it's Satan's Eden and so you walk through that and I can't help what I see I can help what I see the second time but the first time I don't know I don't know what's walking around I don't know what I'm going to see who I'm going to see what clothes they're wearing what they're going to be doing and so you walk around and you do and you see things you're at work you're going to see people you're going to hear people you're going to get involved in things that you have no control over and it has access now to your body it has access to your life and so sometimes those things can jump on and that's why we need the continuous washing of the Water by the word is to push those things back away and say that doesn't belong in a believer's life but now if I open up my life then Satan's allowed to come in if I open it up by entertainment if I open it up by music if I open it up by relationship if I open it up by whatever it might might be and I open that door up and I say I'm going to allow this into my life then every Spirit attached to that has access to my life now and all it takes is one hit you look at things like cocaine and whatnot one hit and people are hooked for life and what happens is a habit conform and it's by my access I allowed it into my life and the only thing that'll put it out is when I say I don't want it anymore insincerity insincerity and that's why we preach the word straight we don't pull back we don't say well we'll allow this no no no if the word says we don't do it we don't do it amen and we ought to be able to say to each other we ought not to be doing this you ought not to be doing it I not not to be doing it but that's access and that's the things that we have Paul says our reasonable C sacrifice is or reasonable service is to keep our lives clean as much as we can but he says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God good acceptable and perfect only God can do that and you've got to tap into his wisdom you got to tap into his will to do it he says for I say through the grace given unto me that to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God had dealt to every man the Measure of Faith see we want to read that a Measure of Faith but there's a there's a there's a great mystery behind what he says here he says The Measure of Faith because it isn't just The Measure of Faith it is the measure of Faith it's specific in where it comes from and what it is the prophet of God would say this he says in Acts 3:16 when Peter was asked how the mighty Miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it on this wise and his Jesus name through faith in his Jesus name Ha made this man this formal strong yay the faith which is by or from him had given him this man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all he says see there it is jesus' name and Jesus Faith brought about the miracle he says Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith anymore than he claimed it was his own name he said that Jesus name used in the faith which is from Jesus perform that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelations 2:13 it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers amen if there's something we need to produce the word in this age it's the Faith of Christ amen we have salvational faith and you'll see salvational faith is unto something but now we come in and as adopted Sons and Daughters as mature Christians that have been filled with the spirit of God we don't just have faith unto something but we have the faith of something we have the faith of someone amen we have the Faith of Christ why because the same spirit that indwell him indwells us and that means the same faith that goes along with it must also accompany it anden if I have the faith of if I have the spirit of Christ Paul says now if if I have the spirit of Christ and I think I do anden if we have the spirit of Christ then the faith that comes with that must be in us as well so we are not sitting here by our own mental Faith by our own human Faith we're not acting that but we're acting on the spirit of God that brings his faith to us that makes all things possible amen it's not a faith it's the faith so Paul says every single one of us has The Measure of Faith when we get the Holy Spirit it is God putting his own life inside of us and with that comes the faith of God as well that all things are possible to them who will believe now listen to this it says now coming from the Holy Spirit now brother bam here is talking about the stature of a perfect man and he's gone all the way through what we have here in second Peter 1 and you know you've got your faith virtue knowledge Temperance and these things he says that's all in a man and then a holy spirit comes he says then he will give to you Supernatural Faith spiritual Faith here at the bottom he says you have these attributes and they're in you because you're a son or daughter of God from the beginning of the world Amen you have a word seat inside of you he ordained you before the foundation of the world Amen he chose us in him he says all of that has come out and it's a working of the Holy Spirit then what happens is the the Holy Spirit comes and it's poured in on those things and it changes it from what you have to what he has amen so what happens he says now is that you have an attribute by this by by the nature that's in you of God you've got a seat of God inside of you in the Holy Spirit the word brings this out of you he says but he's got to come in and take it from like God to God Amen cuz it's Christ in us the hope of glory it's not now going to be my faith it's got to be his faith it's not going to be my virtue it's going to be his virtue that's what takes us through the storms of life that's what takes us through the difficulties is Christ in us not me and me me and me fails me and me falls down me and me gets desponded me and me falls into despair me and me gets offended and hurt and holds ourselves back but it's Christ in me that keeps me going no matter what amen he says now then that spiritual Faith recognizes only the word no matter what anybody else says it don't do any good that only knows the word if somebody says the days of Miracles pass that Faith only knows the word somebody says there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost that Faith only knows the word that's real spiritual Faith you see that's right see it only knows the word he says and that was number one that's your faith then he's got to do it with knowledge and these things he says number one coming to you your mental Faith that's what we had really was a mental faith it was something in US yes it's from God it's a working of God but it's just this but it's now got to be more he says uh your mental Faith here comes the Holy Spirit coming down into your mental Faith making it a spiritual Faith that's what we're looking for that's the anchor is when he comes down and he seals it and he makes it his it's not now my attribute it's his attribute it's not my life it's his life it's not my power it's his power it's not my inspiration it's his inspiration it's not my thought it's his thought he says then the spiritual Faith only recognizes the word he says now in number 2 and three all through these things he says then you'll have spiritual you'll be having the Holy Spirit and it will seal all these things into you as the Holy Spirit covers this from your faith all the way up to the Holy Spirit it seals you in with Christ then you become at one amen see you and Christ live together at that day you'll know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I and you and you and me see he says then that's a sealed unit of the Lord God when the Holy Spirit pour pour s into our being and seals it all together he says that's a sealed unit he says now and then they are Vindicated and placed he says when that time takes place then they become Vindicated Sons and Daughters of God not our he says they become Vindicated we always were Sons scripture says because you are Sons God sends the spirit into US crying out Abba Father Abba Father it's because we're sons and daughters that he comes to us but he says you always were Sons but when the Holy Spirit comes in and seals these things and turns those attributes into his true attributes he says now you're Vindicated you're proven and you're placed that's what's happening in these things amen we're positionally placed in Christ by the Holy Spirit now Paul says as we read earlier that each one of us has The Measure of Faith but here's the thing I have it in a certain level for my life and you have it in a certain level for your life you we listen to what brother Ron Spencer's going through anybody here want to claim they've got faith for that four years of stage for cancer now he's got double heart attacks but let me tell you Satan can't take you till God's done with you and so the faith is there the Revelation is there to keep pressing on Amen but we have faith for our journey we have the measure that is required for each and one each and every one of us as we said in a service a while ago when you need the revelation God will give it when you need the faith God will give it it's been in you all along but it rises up as the need arises amen it's there he's already provided everything we have need of is in us when he gives us the Holy Spirit he's already provided every one of our needs amen amen but it's it's going to take what it's going to take trials it's going to take testing it's going to take situations to pull these things out we shrink so often from the trials of life but that is what shows what's in Us in the first place amen that we can overcome these things amen the purpose of this is to take us into the place and to be what God has called us to be in this age amen God has given to each and every one of us the measure of faith that we need to make it through now Paul would say this he says now we've all got The Measure of Faith but he says for as we have many members in one body he says this body's got lots of pieces he says and all members have not the same office in other words all the parts of our body don't have the same purpose my fingers are to pick things up they're to point at other people no they're not but they're meant for for fine work aren't they then you got parts of our body that aren't meant for fine work it's amazing how long it took them to get robots that could run and walk the way human does they've got them now that can do it but the Dynamics and the mechanics of a body are so complex and yet we do things almost without thinking well we do it without thinking because it's meant to do that it's built for it amen but each part he says don't have the same purpose he says so we be many are one body in Christ so he's talking to the whole church now he says even us we're all members in one body in Christ and everyone members one of another in the Amplified it says individually we are Parts one of another he says we're individuals but we're mutually dependent on one another listen in the scriptures a sheep alone was only called one thing lost we're sheep we're supposed to be in a group group we're supposed to be in a herb we're supposed to be together he says we are all members one of another the prophet of God would say now God creating the creation is expressing himself back in the creation and he's not a god of just one solid Sears and robach Harmony House he's a god of variety he makes big hills and little Hills he makes the deserts he makes Lakes he makes little trees and big trees and white flowers and red flowers he makes little men and big men red-headed women blackheaded women and he makes us different why cuz he wants us that way what's the point of having a bunch of Mees in this church horrible horrible a bunch of Germans I won't I'm going to leave it he says he makes us different because he wants us that way he's a god of variety and he makes some rich some poor some in between he says but we got a place to serve God and that's the place he's placing Us in if we'll just abide in that place isn't that the challenge isn't that the challenge is to stay in the place that he's called us to be amen it's sometimes you know what the challenge is is to look at ourselves and say I'm important it's easy for the minister to do it duh he's definitely important but for sister Lydia to say I'm important little old me little Paul sitting back there he likes me to mention his name over the pulpit right sitting back there who am I what does it matter if I come to church what does it matter if I'm a part of this body each and every one of us are members of the same body did you know the balance of your body is run through the little pinky toe take the pinky toe away away and you lose your balance the little thing little tiny toe that big and your balance rests on that that's how the little things matter you take the littlest thing take your thumbs try going through life without opposable thumbs not fun the tiny things make the biggest difference inside of the body and when each one is here when each one is present and accounted for when each one's working it's great but one little thing gets out one little thing gets hurt one little things get set back and what happens is the whole body does it just this injury to my shoulder when I cough my whole left side aches just one little injury one little thing can cause so much imbalance hurt ineffectiveness inside of the body amen so we've got to see God has us here for a supernatural reason no matter where we are no matter what we are we sit back and it's easy to do with Ministry or musicians you know and you look at this one you say wow can they ever play you know brother Andrew tashner when he gets on that keyboard Boy Who Am I who are you sister Morin compared to him but guess what he ain't here you're here I can sit here and I can compare myself to all the men that I consider to be great preachers but guess what they're not here I'm here so whether we acknowledge it or not we're here because God placed us here and we're here to be effective which means we are effective if we step into our position so don't let Satan say you're not important you're important you know how I'm important you're here if you're here and you're present and accounted for you're important amen but our what Satan will do is he'll say they're so much better and he'll get this comparative thing going which has no place in the body of Christ it's not about Better or Worse good or bad it's about what's your path and what's my path what's your purpose and what's my purpose and all he's looking for is who's going to be faithful that's what matters above all is who will be faithful amen there are people that can pray the lights out there are people that can preach the lights out there are people that can sing the lights out there are people that can play it whatever and we look at that and we say I need to get to that level you know what'll happen if you try that you'll fall flat on your face and you'll lose the effect of what he's given you already why because you're trying to be another man another woman it doesn't work that way we've got to stay in our lane amen but Christ says you're important and you're a part of the body and that means you got to be in your position in your place think of it like a hockey team you look at a hockey team they've got scores they got Playmakers and passers they got hitters they got offensive players they got defensive players they got a goalie that doesn't get to move around very much some of us have to be goalies and we got to protect the home net everyone else is running around having a good time and you got to sit here all weighed down but that's the way it is and let me tell you this if the hitter tries to take the scorers place you know what happens he still doesn't score any goals but the other team has a Heyday because now this guy's not hitting them and keeping them accountable for their movements you take a playmaker away what happens to the scores all of a sudden they're not scoring as much we all need each other it's imperfect balance amen but if we start trying to be what the other person is the body starts to hurt man we're a multi part of a multi-member body and we all have a specific role to play and we have to find contentment in that and be faithful in those things Paul would say this he says now having then gifts differing according to the works that we've done is that what it says gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith now that sets it in a different light doesn't it you are who you are and I am who I am by Grace the position you have the position I have is by Grace I don't deserve it you don't deserve it big or small for outward facing inward facing it doesn't matter everything we have is by his grace by his ordination and he says and there's a proportion of Faith given you to match your role so use what you've got where you're at and you'll find it works out perfectly well every time but we start trying to take somebody else's place or try to mimic somebody then our faith Falls flat because that's not our proportion of Faith we've got to grow in our role as he grows us in it but we can't presume in these things and man we've got to stay where we are not only that there's varying gifts within the same gift and that's easy to see when you look at music you look at preachers we got preachers that when they preach it's like a house on fire right and we love it then you got preachers that are calm and methodical and you know what some of us love that not Everyone likes a preacher that preaches like a house on fire some people like it calm and simple and we've got to be able to appreciate them both equally because they both have a purpose what does it help if a teacher is running around on the stage you're not going to get much out of a teacher that won't calm down and lay it out clearly most teachers Don't Preach like a house fire some do but again to each is given a way of doing it and God works with us as we are and he makes us as we are and if we can accept them as they come in rather than trying to force them into the way we like it then we make them ineffective we've got to accept it the way that God gives it and the way that God makes each one of these people so he says he says uh he says um Ministry says let us wait on our ministry or he that teach teaching teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on assertation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness in other words he says he says whatever your ministry your service is wait for the opportunity and the leadership to use it this is a key thing and and I've spoken with ministers about this over the last year especially just because we can doesn't mean we should just because I can meet that need doesn't mean that I should because sons of God are led by the spirit of God amen we're supposed to have leadership for these things it's not up to me to force it and it's not up to me to jump into it every single time it comes my way we have to prayerfully ask the Lord do you want me in this situation because otherwise we just get another we get another Chief right too many chiefs and not enough Indians and we got too many people trying to manage and get into things instead of the one that's usually ordained by God to do it amen just because there's a need doesn't mean I have to meet it but if it's in my role and if it's in the way that God wants me to do it sure we step into it but there are often many people that have similar gifts and the thing is who does God want to do it that's why we bring in outside Ministry I recognize I can't do it all and I need to be fed and I need to to sit under those things as well and so that's why we bring in different Ministries and we bring in ministries of faith we bring in ministries of healing we bring in ministries of teaching we even bring in pastoral Ministries what to give us everything that we have need of and we accept each one as Servants of God as gifts of God to us for the benefit of the body BR would say this he says we all have different parts God has put the furniture in the house now watch the television say I will just not be television no more if I can't be an ice box that's an old name for refrigerator see the television's out then he says but if we all just find Our Calling in God and abide there see God knows just when to use us and how to use us he says and we don't want to be jumping here and there but where God put you be original be just what God wants you to be now don't get in a rut sometimes we refuse to change we refuse to grow and say well that's the way God made me no let's step up into the image he has for us amen let's step up into the transforming power of the holy spirit that the word changes Paul would continue he says let love be without dissimulation that means let love be sincere let it be a real thing don't let it just be words Let It Be actions he says abhor that which is evil and cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another now this is what you'll see in a body is this this idea of preferring one another in other words it allows others to step to the front to get the benefit and even to get the recognition who cares remember Paul say he says I planted aul water but it's God that gives the increase Paul wasn't saying there say it's me it's me it's me who cares as long as we get the increase as long as we see the word being fulfilled as long as we see God moving in our in our midst amen let's be focused on the Brotherly Love side side of things that'll produce the right results every time not getting the credit for our brotherly love Paul would summarize it all very simply in 1 Corinthians 14 says even so ye for as much as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts anden we want God to be using gifts in our midst each of the nine spiritual gifts ought to be available inside the Church of God he says if you're zealous of it if you want them he says seek that you may what Excel to the edifying of the church in other words that what you do that that that gift in you would stabilize would build up would support would make healthy the local body amen if we want to come to a place of adoption we've got to seek to serve all always it's a life of service amen we don't force our way in we don't try and lift ourselves up amen we seek to serve and that's how we come to a place where God sees a willing heart and the character and the humility that's needed to use Authority and power properly amen a Christian Life is a life of service Brother Brad would say when you live your life for others you're looking heaven in the face right that's what it is it's seeking God's leadership now as to when and how we move into situations but I want to come back to our opening scripture here in Ephesians 2 in the last last verse that we read is 10 he says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus un good works which God had before ordained that we should walk with him walk in them rather now I want to break this down as we this will be the last half of the service Lord willing but he talks here of three things he talks about our origin we talks about our purpose and he talks about our path all within the scripture and he starts with our origin he says for we are his workmanship now I want you to catch something because workmanship in implies intention when we see our kids sometimes go out and they play in the in the sand or they they play with wood or you give them some nails and some power tools they just go and they put things together just to see what they can do but he says when it comes to God we're workmanship in other words whatever he's doing is done with purpose you know brother Matt's a a machinist he he does fabrication work he's a mill right and if you are looking at what he's doing I guarantee you he doesn't and start working with the machines for no reason when he does it what does he have he's got a drawing or he's got an idea in his head and he's using those machines he's using his equipment to produce something that has a purpose either a client's going to pay for it they need it in the shop they need a tool whatever it might be he's working with purpose amen so we don't just go out and do a bunch of work for no good reason Paul's saying we are his workmanship in other words we are out of the work that he did with purpose he doesn't just do things he doesn't just put things in our lives he doesn't just take us on a particular path for no good reason but God has intention behind everything he does in our lives amen prophet of God would say this he says I think our heavenly father has people made up in certain ways for his own benefit he says just like that we do things certain ways different each time because we have a purpose in doing it that's why we do it he says he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you were unlovable but he changed you praise the Lord that he's changed us amen that I'm not the way I used to be he says just like the colored sister said that time in her testimony she said I'm not what I ought to be and I'm not what I want to be but then I'm not what I used to be she knew she had come somewhere and something had happened he says that's the way it is if God when I was an alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me why because God doesn't start something without intention or purpose if he picked you up it was to turn you back into what you already always were in his eyes he said he's got a purpose in doing it he seen something in me he seen something in you he had a reason to save you he says look at the people that's unsaved today you're one in a million why are you one in a million because he chose you with purpose he says look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you he says amen no one can take your place see that's a revelation he chose you because nobody else can take your place he says you're in God's economy no one can do it that's his love to you then won't Your Love reach right back to him he says and there's a love affair catch this now no matter what the situation is its circumstances is govern by this love that creates faith that God loves you and you love God and you love one another and that brings the faith all right he says then it what then the Faith Can't Keep from bringing out just exactly what God promised it would do that's our rest is that he loved me before I was lovable he saved me before I was savable everything was already provided remember what Paul said he says Those whom he called he just ified and those who he justified he Sanctified and those who he Sanctified them he also glorified before we ever did anything it was before the foundation of the world a way has been made a preparation been made so what he's doing is he's coming down he's picking up those select ones that he had his thoughts about in the beginning he says then he says when that comes together and you realize that in every situation he loves you the only question then is do I love him and if I love him and he loves me then what are we worried about everything will work for our our good even if it doesn't feel good amen our origin is the mind of God and he's the the master builder he's the great architect he's the engineer he's the Potter and we're just the product we're the finished product amen and then he just takes this clay of humanity and that we have and when it's all done we're formed in his purpose you know I was speaking to some brothers at the funeral on on Wednesday and we were we were talking about looking into our lives and looking our past and and sometimes the timeline of Our Lives doesn't seem to make sense and we say Lord why did it take so long Lord why didn't you do this here why didn't you do this there and it seems like events are unnecessarily harsh or painful or long and you say Lord why and in those situations especially before we come to the Lord we can sit there and we it can really cause a hardship it can put a shell around us and those offenses and hurts can really cause us to withdraw to ourselves but when we're truly saved when we get the true New Birth by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we look back on those situations with a filter of Grace because he was we see that he was working in our lives all along amen we can look at those things and it doesn't hold us back I look at my road I've got a pretty twisty Road I would think you know I've been all over North America I've sat under many different Ministries and I've met in fellowship with all kinds of Believers and I've been hurt I've been offended I've been defra Ed I've had Ministry fail I've had people leave me I've had people leave this message amen but I look back on all of those things and yet it doesn't bother me I don't like it but it doesn't hold me back in my relationship with God because he kept me that's what matters is he kept me amen and I'm still able to love him I'm still able to worship him I'm still able to thank him for all of those things that were difficult you know we lost I come from a broken home where my dad left when I was 10 that breaks so many people but what happened was when I was 17 I found my real father and that took care of any issues with my Earthly father amen and what happens is when we come to our place in Christ we realize that everything else is dead and it's only purpose was to bring us to where we are now and then from that moment on everything that happens is bringing us closer CL and closer to our finality in Christ to a resurrection to a Rapture to a restoration to our eating condition amen but how many hurts and pains have we suffered even within the body of Christ from supposed Believers not supposed real Believers listen we're going to hurt each other absolutely we're going to offend each other we're going to lose our temper with each other we're going to do things sometimes we hurt people without intent and it's because they have issues in their life that we cause pain but yet we cause pain it's those that are closest to us that hurt us remember when Christ comes back and the Jews are going to look at his hands they're going to say where did you get these wounds he says what in the house of my friends the ones that can hurt us the most are the ones that are closest to us the ones that we have the greatest expectations on but I love how Paul puts this we look at Paul Paul got whipped Paul got stoned Paul got thrown in jail Paul got cursed out Paul had all sorts of things done in his life now listen to Paul's attitude he says in everything give thanks everything without exception give thanks he says why for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you what we're going through is his will if we're walking in the light as he is in the light if we're following the leadership of the Holy Spirit whatever comes our way is his will whether it seems good or whether it seems bad we've got to see the Harvest before we really know what's going good and bad and we see it in the end but we've got to have faith to hold on Amen we've got to stay tight we've got to say Lord I love you and you love me and I'll Trust you through this no matter what this is a very familiar quote he says the cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval neither are bright skies and Still Waters signs of his love and approval his approval of any of us is only in the Beloved his love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world does does he love us he says oh yes but how shall we know we shall know because he said so number one but catch this and manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself Hallelujah he brought us to himself and gave us of his Spirit placing us as Sons you know he loves you because he gave you his own life he gave his life for you and then he gave his life to you that's how you know he loves you he says and how shall I prove my love to him him this is our part Church by believing what he said and conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass I look back now over my life see hindsight is usually 2020 usually and I look back over my life and I say God you know how to you know how to prepare a person you know how to train a person you know how to get a person to where they need to be I look at my wife and I say God you know how to pick a spouse because here's the thing I thought I was choosing I did it prayerfully but God chose her for me I didn't choose her for me he brought her my way and what knowing where I would end up chose a spouse that would complement that role I didn't know I was going to be a minister never wanted to be why would you but he chose a wife for me that could shoulder the responsibilities with Grace with a willing heart that would be supportive and yet still be able to maintain everything she has to do as a mother and as a wife amen God placed me under Ministries and in situations so I could learn what not to do and what to do and guess what when you're learning what not to do because it affects you often it's easy to sit there and say why lord it's so that you'll learn it's so that I'll learn and all of it was training I had 16 years of express training to bring me to where I am today and in the meantime it often looks so chaotic it doesn't even look like the will of God many times and it's easy to sit there and say God why God why did you do that why did you allow it God why does this ke seem to keep happening and what is it it's God trying to get us to learn the lesson to prepare us because what's there is going to be small compared to what I'm going to face in the future and I've got to learn the lesson in the small things so that I can hold to it when the big times come amen look at Joseph look at David look at Daniel can you imagine Daniel taken away from his family taken away from his religion taken away from Worship in the temple and he's taken to a land where he's only got three other fellows that believe the way he does God why me that was his lot in life and guess what Daniel held the victory the whole time without the Holy Ghost a prophet ordained before the foundation of the world he comes in and he is separated from everything that he holds dear and yet The Anchor Holds that was his lot in life and he never begrudged it and God rolls him up and God made him a great man look at Joseph what did Joseph ever do and God put him into slavery he made his brothers hate him and then he puts him into slavery and then he puts him into prison why me Lord because I've got a job for you and I need you to learn the lessons before we get into the job he says that's the way God takes his men and beats out all their fears and all their intellectuals that's the first thing he does he says and then the Great Master Potter puts them on the wheel and begins to mold them over again he's got to break us down so he can build us up he says workmen that are worthy it's God's man he says who could trade a man more than God himself he says watch the way he trains them God knows how to prepare us for our purpose we all have a purpose which means he's got a preparation for that purpose and the biggest challenge is will I recognize it in the middle of that preparation well I recognize it when it doesn't feel so good when it doesn't look so good and recognize that there's a breaking down and there's a building up and neither one of them feels good neither one of them Feels Good Sister Betty just got broken down in her hip and she got built up it didn't feel real good did it sister Betty but the end result will be better but you have to go through that that that pressing time that trying time when we're sick when Ministry fails when Believers disappoint us when it seems like the money's not there when it seems like the job's not there that's when we've got to be able to trust how hard is it to worship God when things are going great but that's not the sign of his approval neither the tough times disapproval we have ups and downs we go through seasons and he's in it all I've questioned my decisions many times in life because I would be in the middle of it and things it just seemed like I jumped out of the frying pan into the fire I went from one tough situation into the next tough situation I was on an I was on an accelerated growth curve was what it was but you sit there and say God where's the rest can I have a break please no I've got a job for you so suck it up do you trust me job said though he slay me yet I'll trust him but through it all God was there I can look back now and I can I can say God was clearly there but I've got to have faith I've got to trust that he's leading me let me be more honest there were times I stepped out on my own and things did not work out well and I had to be able to step back and say that wasn't God's Will and it certainly wasn't God's perfect will you know how you're not in his perfect will you backtrack you've got to backtrack you get off on a path you get off on a road and what happens is you get out here and you realize God's nowhere to be found he didn't move I left him and I know it's not his will because I've got to go back to where he is and that takes humbling ourselves to the word and questioning how did I get off in the first place and dealing with that rude issue so that it doesn't happen again down the road that's all it is if I'm backtracking it means it wasn't in his perfect will amen God's will is always go forward it's either stand still or go forward it's never go away stand still or go forward you're either waiting on him or you're moving with him but you're never moving on your own but even in those moments where I got out of it God taught me why it went the way it went you know the situation in Texas what happened and I've said it many times I'll say it again for your own benefit if you let a person go above the word of God it's never going to work out well we hold ourselves accountable we hold Ministry accountable to the word of God the minute you put a man above it a woman above it a gift above it a Ministry above it a friendship above it then what happens is you get into his permissive will certainly not in his perfect will but even in those moments God taught me why it happened and he taught me what to do the next time and he taught me what not to do the next time you know sometimes pain and offense are our own fault and God still allows that to help us learn I remember way back when when uh we were going to the 7-Day Venice schools there and they had a um they had a graduation and I don't remember anything the minister said but he told this story he said of a little girl that was out and they on a farm and and the dad had just put up an electric fence for the livestock and she was walking towards the fence and her dad said don't touch the fence it will hurt you and she kept walking towards it he said don't touch the fence it'll hurt you and she kept walking and so what did he did he shut up and she went over and she touched the fence and then she started crying because it really really really really really hurt but you know what happened after that his little boy came out and he started walking towards the fence and you know what that little girl said don't touch the fence why she'd learned the lesson and he he was using her now to send the message you don't want to do that you don't want to go down that road I've been there I've touched that fence it's not good trust me you don't want to go down that road and if you do now you're forcing your way in and God will deal with you as an individual but some of us are lessons on what to do and some of us are lessons in not what not to do and we've got to be humble enough to share the what not to do as much as the what Tod do amen that's why I try and use myself as an example I've tried to share what I've learned and how God's dealt with me it'll help you when you come to those places as well but sometimes those things are literally by the will of God so that when the big trial comes later we don't do it remember David when nabal said I'm not going to give you anything and David's coming down with his 400 men he's going to wipe out nabal and all of his servants and take everything he has and nabal's wife meets him Abigail and she stops him there and David says he thanks her he says you are LED of God to do this because I'd have done something I shouldn't have done sometimes we're on that road and somebody will send a little one our way say you don't want to do this it'll impact you the rest of your life God might be able to bring you back around but you'll have a scar there the rest of your life you'll have something that's going to hold you back and you're not going to be able to move past it you're going to hit a you're going to hit a ceiling because of this you look at us as ministers we divorce and get married again we can't preach we're not allowed we're not allowed to do it there are certain things that hold us back from responsibility ities and roles in the kingdom of God based on our actions and that's on us that's not on God sometimes we force our way into it he would continue this he says the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth catch this job said though he slay me yet I'll trust him he said he he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job that is his prerogative he is suffering he is Sovereign rather he says but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not a peace so if we are sitting in frustration what is the problem it's not God it's my attitude it's my Approach it's my mindset it's my vision of what's going on amen cuz God is not the author of frustration he says and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while there's always suffering for the believer because that's part of training every one of us gets spanked every one of us goes through tests every one of us goes through trials he says but after that we have suffered a while we would be made perfect brother Grant what's the best time in the school semester when when the tests are over amen he says after you've been tested a while after you've suffered a while after you've gone through that stress after you've gone through that difficulty a while he says we will be made what more frustrated tired worn out he says that after after we've suffered a while we will be made perfect we would be established we would be strengthened and settled as job said he puts strength in us if somebody ought to know that it's job lost his family lost his wealth and left with a nagging wife that's the modern version of hell because we know what a nagging wife is like scripturally not by experience of course Brothers but the question is where's our strength then if it's supposed to establish us if it's supposed to strengthen us if it's supposed to settle us then where is our strength who's telling us you're not strong enough it ain't God Paul said I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me so we have nothing to fall back on and say I don't have enough to go through it little old me can't do it I'm no good that comparative thing kills us every time we're formed by God we're shaped by God and though he's a supernatural God yet he uses the Natural Things of life because we're we are supernatural beings going through a natural experience amen so he uses the natural things he goes he takes us through life and situations and challenges and events and he uses it to mold us into his image and it's always with purpose brother Braham said it was to make us mature perfect means mature established strengthened and settled amen anyone that's ever amounted to anything in God's kingdom has had to go through this and the greater the role the greater the impact the greater the testing and trials and suffering like I said you look at Joseph you look at David you look at these different ones and they had to go through hell why so that the character would match the role when it all finished up but what's our attitude when we're going through it what's our attitude when we're going through these trials when we're going through this molding process when we're going through this preparation what is our attitude to it that tells us whether we're ready for adoption or not Paul would say this in Romans he says but oh man who artart thou that repliest against God shall the thing form say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus we've got two problems that come into our lives one is why am I the way I am and that's a comparative thing that's a comparative thing is when you say why am I different from other people why am I not like the popular one why am I not by this one why am I not like that one I had to get over that very early in my Ministry is why am I the way I am and when when I feel I could be so much more effective as it as another type of Minister I think every Minister would love to be that that Dynamic just you know house on fire type preaching but we aren't all and for me to try and be that would literally cause me to fail but we can say Lord why did you make me thus remember what Paul said he says we have this treasure in Earth and vessels that the Excellency may be of God and not of us he makes us this way so that when it comes out and the Supernatural is working in our life we are ready and quick to understand this ain't me that's doing it it keeps us humble he's made us this this way to keep us humble and that when we surrender we can become effective but then the other problem so often is not just Lord why have you made me thus but why have you made me in this path or way we look at our life and we say why did it have to be that way did I really have to go through that trial did I have to really lose this did I really have to get sick did I have to lose my finances did I have to go bankrupt did I have to lose my wife whatever it might be you see great suffering amongst the people of God and we can sit there and say Lord couldn't you have done it a little easier on me no everything he does is his purpose we are his workmanship and mean he's doing it with intent but as we're coming into adoption what do we do we start to embrace we embrace the way that God's working and we say like Mary be unto me according to Thy word and we rest that he's got it all in control amen that our lives are in his hands listen Paul and Silas praised God while chained to the stalks in jail that's the response of a child of God that's the response of adopted sons of God is that we can Praise Him in the storm as much as we can Praise Him in the sunshine that we get so rarely in Newan land it makes no matter my life is in his hands God is good all the time we sing it but do we believe it do we believe it that's our origin we are his workmanship we come from his mind his thoughts but then we go to the next part and it says we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works so here we see our purpose amen first thing to see about this is that it's in a certain place and it's in Christ Our purpose purpose and our placing is always in Christ amen we're talking about what about adoption about the workmanship of God and the effectual working of the Holy Spirit places Us in the body of Christ that's what 1 Corinthians 12 says by one Spirit we are placed into the body we're baptized into the body amen it places us into Christ and the purpose of that he says is good works now remember what Jesus said Jesus said there's none good but God remember when the the Rich Young Ruler came onto him he said good Master Jesus said there's none good but God good works means God's works and God's work means God's Will and God's will is his word so in other words we have been created in Christ Jesus unto what doing the word of God producing the word of God not just obedience in terms of our lives but producing it letting it flow through us and producing the very life and the attributes and the results that were in Christ's life that were in the disciples life that were in the first church is life amen so each one of us has a role to play he says we are his workmanship each one of us is created to do God's work each one of us produced to do God's work amen and it's so tempting for us to try and be like what the person next to us is doing because we see the results but what we don't see is everything that went into getting those results I said it before the scripture gives us such insight into what it takes to become great in the Kingdom and it is a total and complete humbling and destruction of our Humanity laying everything down so that he could have the preeminence and so often what we do is we mimic the the actions without having the life behind it without the character behind it produce it and so we keep failing we keep failing but he says each one of us has been created for good works for Godly works and there's a purpose amen when I try and be like some other minister I fail if I it's so tempting to go into a church where they preach a certain way and try and preach a certain way but that will never work that will never work cuz I'm not anointed that way that's not my ministry that's not the way I am amen and if you try and influence me to be that way that's even worse I can't get myself out of it and I can't become it just because you want it that's why we bring in the others is because that's they have it naturally why would we want to put something on when we can have the real deal amen if I want to be a certain way or you want to be me me to be a certain way you know what that does that makes me my workmanship or it makes me your workmanship and what happens then is that when the supernatural comes into my workmanship it fails every time you know as an engineer we design pressure vessels and the material has to be it has to meet a certain test specification has to have a certain strength and if you build a pressure vessel out of the wrong material as soon as the pressure comes it'll blow up that's what happens with our workmanship when we make ourselves into something rather than we let him make us into something when the pressure hits we just blow up we need him to work us and the way that we get the strength into those materials as we put it under great heat and then we bring it out in a certain way and it tempers the material to give it the properties it needs to have the strength to stand up to the pressure and then when the supernatural tries to express itself through my workmanship it never works it can't the supernatural needs a supernatural workmanship brother B say this he says how that God trying to place his people and when God places one then oh the whole church wants to be like that one have the same kind of things and do the same things he says we are cut out different we're made different we are natured different and we are positionally placed different each one for a different work and then he says maybe one for just a little kind of a work and another for a large work but that's not me that decides it it's not you that decides it it's God that decides it and the whole thing is a great preparation for the work that we're supposed to do in our lives amen we aren't supposed to worry about how big our work is remember we we read about the parable of the talents a while ago some got more than others but the question was not how much do you have it's what are you going to do with what you've got because the Lord was looking to see who would be faithful he said Well Done thou good and faithful servant cuz you took what I gave you and you magnified it you expanded it you multiplied it use what God gives you be what God has placed you to be and then when he sees you Faithful in that you'll find that usually that thing you thought was a little work was so much bigger than you ever anticipated it's like when you're trying to you know if you're you're trying to you ever see um I think every boy likes to do this when you're up on a hill and there's a big rock up there what do you want to do you want to roll the Rock and have it go all the way down the hill and just but when you get a really big one sometimes they need some help don't they and you can sit there and everyone's trying to push that rock and nothing's moving and then all that needs is that little extra pound of force and a little kid can come and just touch that rock and it'll move sometimes all you need is that extra little bit of effort from the littlest thing in the church and it tips The Rock over and all of a sudden it's a finished work that's why we all gather that's why we all bring our licks of fire that's why we all bring our faith because sometimes it's the last little one that makes the difference so often we're relying on the big and the great and we forget it's the little one that often makes the difference he would say don't let that be you just a floater and a Drifter you can never amount to anything like that let's get up and do something about it let's put our shoulder to the wheel let's see that our church prospers let let's get the kingdom prospering he's not talking money he says let's see that the sick gets in here let's see that God is laid down among the people and great signs and wonders take place that'll strike the nation I'm satisfied that there will be things that happen here that will thrill this country that'll Shake It for the kingdom of God if each one of us will get behind it he says what are we doing we're building the platform for our Lord he says we want to bring him to our community we want to bring him in a great Revival he says but we've got to elect him in our own Hearts see I've got to put him in preeminence I've got to choose him I've got to vote him in not by mouth but by Life by my day-to-day actions and decisions he says we've got to purpose something get something to do with it something to do for some purpose you don't don't just join the church and drift on you don't do it that way you always you got to have a purpose in what you're doing now don't go make up a purpose that's not what he's saying here amen that'll get you in trouble but rather see your purpose see where you fit in and then be faithful to that amen tell God I'm here I'm present I'm willing I'm able you just need to point me in the right direction listen to this he says wife says well I'm just a wife he says get on the telephone and do something not gossip not chitchat get on the phone give a testimony send a scripture to somebody let them know you're praying for them send them a song that's blessed you share something that'll be a witness to somebody else that's what we can do he says do something to help the Lord Jesus now he says now there is a time that a man can come to a place where he can have a purpose and it's something that will change him and that is when a man meets God he says when a man he says a man can never be the same if he ever meets God face to face it changed Moses it changed change Jacob amen he says it will change him in spite of anything you can do about it a man can never be the same after he once meets God he says now that's the truth he wants us to be able to see where we can be active in the Kingdom to see that we have purpose even as students we get little opportunities you look at doctors you look at nurses you look at Engineers we all have our Co-op work terms we're not full-blown Engineers but we can have little opportunities to help the greater good and so that's what we do and that's what God does is as we're going through life and as he teaches us something as he gets us settled in something now he gives us an opportunity to apply it for the benefit of others around you and maybe it's as a father as a as a as a mother as a wife or as a husband for your household for your kids whatever it might be but God says okay you got it now let's see if you got it and then as you go through that things he's saying will they respond and act the right way right and then will we glorify God or will we glorify ourselves will you do the right thing and then will you have the right motive and objective behind it and he'll test you in little things and if you pass the little things that's how you graduate to the big things as an engineer I got to do all sorts of interesting things as a student engineer as a co-op student but as soon as I got my degree then I was allowed a greater latitude and then once I became a professional engineer that gave me even more latitude once I became the manager then I had all the latitude but there's a progression each way and I've got to keep going and growing and proving myself as I go through so don't turn down the little opportunities the little opportunities are what prove you're ready for the bigger opportunities but then we come to the end of this verse and we come to our path and he says we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus under good works now here's the path which God had before ordained that we should walk in them so God has ordained each and every one of us to a particular a particular set of things of works that he wants us to do Amen in other words God has laid out our lives in such a way that we are predestinated to do God's Will and he'll bring us to the opportunities he'll bring us to the doors he'll take us on a path and it's all tied into how he made us in what's behind us in the things he's taught us the things he's brought us through it's all preparing us for what's before us and it never stops it never stop it's always going God's always building us up line upon line word upon word here a little there a little everything that's behind us is for what's in front of us so we shouldn't be going backwards that's why Paul would said this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus take it and use it but don't dwell on it don't rest on those things you know we can look at certain things and you know you could maybe say well I can do it better than that brother I can look I can do it better than that sister that has nothing to do with it that's carnality speaking that's carnality speaking because we look at our our talents and sat comes in and says you've got the talent that's not the way God works you see nowhere in here where he talks about Talent he says we are his workmanship and other words we are qualified for our Purpose By election not by talent in other words we are where we are and we will be what we be not by talent but because he ordained us to be that and he puts in what he needs and he takes out what he needs and regardless of the talent we have if we don't surrender it we can never progress in the kingdom of God we've got to come as a little child we've got to lay it all down amen we're not called to something because we have talent we're called to it because God has called us to it and when you have the right character which is by his development then you'll be ready to step into that role and then what is it that character does it causes us to yield to the Holy Spirit it causes us to allow the word to have the full effect to take the preeminence look at what said about Jeremiah very familiar scripture he says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee before Jeremiah was even a twinkle in his daddy's eye God knew him he says and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee Jeremiah you are cleaned up and prepared for service before you were ever born he says and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations not a pastor not a priest he was a prophet and that was the only place that God could use him was as a prophet and God had him prepared God had him called God had him ordained God had him ready to be a prophet before he ever stepped foot on this Earth and it's no different for each and every one of us God has ordained Paul said us unto a set of Good Works he's ordained us unto a path brother Bram says this he says who that taking thought can add one cubit to his stature we must do what we can with what we have to do with he says what God has ordained us to do if you'll stay right in your calling and abide there God will use you if you try and step over and do something else you'll find yourself wrecked up somewhere it's always that way that's the human rac's thought though he says you'll find it doing that I think we've all met people that believe they're meant to be something or do something and it's only in their head and what happens is they keep trying to do it and they keep wrecking and they keep making a mess and they keep getting embarrassed why because it ain't God doing it it's them trying to do it now I'm not saying they're not called to do it Moses got out of God's timeline Moses was always a a deliverer but what happened was was Moses was always a deliver but his timeline his timeline got ahead of his character it got ahead of his Revelation and so he tried to do it and brother Braham says all that he had to show for it was one dead egyp Egyptian and he lost the respect of his people so God had to take him out on the backside of the de of the desert and humble him and mold him for 40 years we read earlier he he beats the fears out of us and the intellectuals that we think we can do it and then from there he molds us back into what we need to be right when Moses got humbled when Moses got molded then God could use him and that's the difference amen when God's ordained you for it God has to make you wait on him to do it when you're walking in your own will you will use you come on when I'm walking in my will it's me using me and when did that ever produce anything Supernatural or Eternal no nothing I've got to get out of the way raham says this he says but I got better hopes of you Brethren here this morning that you'll be men of God who stay with the word of God and let everything else fall right to left but stay right with the word don't move he says no matter if you're a doormat out there be a good doormat he says don't try to compete with someone else or do this just get right in the word and stay right there and God will positionally place you into his kingdom where you can be the best God's got a place for each and every one of us he says and when you can find that you'll be the best at that and we see that but Paul I'm going to tell a story on you when I first came here I know how much brother Paul likes Sunday school and brother Mark was talking to me one day and he said Paul just loves teaching Sunday school like that is his he just he's he feels he's built for it he's got it it just it's something in him that wants to do it and in a moment of devilish something I went to Paul after one service and I just moved here and of course I'm a minister Paul's not a minister as far as we know and I went to Paul and I said Paul you know I've been thinking about it and now that we've got a minister here I feel like I should take over the Sunday school and Paul's face dropped he was in shock and that's when I regretted my little joke but what is it we put who's best there because God makes them not because I'm a minister I can do it better you know what that's that would be if I was serious about that that would be me saying me big Minister you little Sunday school teacher me do better no it's not that I don't have a desire to serve the young people it's not that I couldn't do some good but you know what I don't ever have to tell him Paul make sure you prepare for your Ser for your for your your little messages Paul you've been lagging Paul the kids are saying that there's nothing in them anymore that you've lost your no no no why because there's something in him he's built for it he's built for it right what is it God will positionally place you in your kingdom where you can be the best and and when you do that nothing pulls you to the right nothing pulls you to the left Satan will try and get you oh do this do that no way I'm happy where I'm at I'm satisfied where I'm at I'm built for this I'm built for this and even when he doesn't want to do it he's still built for it and he keeps doing it and he keeps doing it and he keeps doing it and the young people benefit from it tremendously thank you brother Paul very faithful God bless you but each one of us are in the same thing can we give some roses today this isn't anywhere in my notes you never have to ask brother Matt to do something and you'll always find sister Amber and the kids right there behind him helping every single time you know what nobody comes up and says uh we need somebody to do this they just do it don't they you never have to prod brother Bob to go do stuff around this building and who is happily traing along behind him sister Brenda why God puts people that can be the best where they are right you want to introduce somebody you want to bring them in there's only one person we go to brother Joe maybe brother Vel right you want to have somebody that needs to come out of Pentecost who are we going to send we send the one that came out of Pentecost don't we you need a hard worker brother Dale each one ain't nobody sings like brother Josh but you know what brother Josh we didn't put you in as soon as you came in did we brother Josh has proven himself faithful being a nothing just sitting in the Pew worshiping being the part of the congregation and meanwhile what's everyone doing they're looking at him they're saying he's got a gift does he have the character to use it properly now to be Grant to be fair we've been after him for a while before he gave in but here's the thing he's got to be led too we can't force him into it we see those things and so you see these people that are placed there amen we have men that handle we have someone that handles finances in the church I guess multiples really can I handle the finances yes I've done it no problem I'd have no problem handling the finances of the church but listen just because I'm in Authority doesn't make me the best what it ought to do is give me character to see those that can do it the best and hand it off to them that's what a body is supposed to be let's put it where the power is let's put it where the purpose is amen brother Brown say this he says don't ever try don't never try to take the other fellow's place God made you a certain thing and you stay that certain you just stay where you are don't try to impersonate the other that's what always ruins the gifts that God sends to the world we find so many carnal impersonations and we find someone who tries to copy after the other one we look around and we can see God has made us a body and ain't one of us the same as the other and I say praise the Lord if we're a bunch of copycats the spirit of the Lord is not here cuz that means we've caught in a man's anointing rather than the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit develops us into a multi-member body with multiple gifts multiple functions multiple ways of looking at things to bring balance to bring Health to bring structure the way it's supposed to be amen God has placed men here and they're tested amen we've got brother Mark handling the finances if somebody came in today that was a chartered accountant we wouldn't just say take over the finances the church would we we'd see if that man's got character first we'll see if he's committed we'll see if he's able to be under Authority before we put him under before we put them in Authority what we're proving them by the word before we let them take a place in the body every one of us has to sit down and be quiet right and then as we prove ourselves faithful the doors start to open and that's not man's works that's God's Works cuz he brings them in and we see here we see what he's done the ones he's brought in I mean he's brought brother Josh and and brother Grant from from all over the place brother Vel from all over the place brother Emanuel we got people that are Catholics we've got people that were Pentecostals we got people that knew nothing all here brought here for a reason for the edifying of the body and things change over time we see that we see that happen amen sometimes we move into more responsibility and sometime it's time for us to move into less and that's the way it works amen we serve for a while and then maybe we don't serve for a while we we go in and out of service and sometimes we're done service and sometimes when we're done our emotions rise up or sometimes because we're not put in our emotions rise up that's not the Holy Spirit doing that that's us that's us that's doing it but we have to see God's in it all brother says this he says but in the word I find that God did not intend for the church to be governed by intellectuality by or by any Theology of man but the Holy Spirit was given to the church to govern and control the body of Christ and I think in doing that that with that in mind and in God's program we'll never be successful no matter how good our intentions are until we get back into the center of God's program amen that's why we're not a denomination it's man in control he says and yet we put our intellectuals mixed with it and then we can get a conglomeration of both the Holy Spirit and intellectuals he says and when the Holy now watch what the mess this makes he says when the Holy Spirit desires to do a thing he says and degrade something or lift something up up so in other words he tries to lift somebody up but sometimes he tries to bring somebody down sometimes there's a time to lay it down and sometimes there's a time to pick it up scripture says that God raises men up God takes men down he says and when God he says when the Holy Spirit desires to do those things it causes petty jealousy amongst the people which proves they haven't got the holy spirit let God be God but see we'll say it's a well you got a certain family in this church that runs things or there's Pol politics in the church or this and that and the other thing listen we got all sorts of groups and people here and not all of us agree with each other on everything but yet we've got people from all walks of life serving in all different aspects of this church it's by the Holy Spirit the thing is are we looking for division or are we looking to get in our place he says every man would want to be in his place in his place what matters more to us that we have recognition that we have responsibility that we have authority that we have some some big reputation or that we're where we ought to be that's what's supposed to matter for us amen it's hard to let go and I don't blame people for not wanting to let go I think for pastors especially it's very difficult to let go because it's their life's work it's their life's work they have literally uh given their their health their bodies everything to preaching the word and then to step away from that it seems like what is my purpose but their forgetting that their purpose was all along and now it's time for somebody else you know if we're filled with the spirit we can see that sometimes we've got to let go and sometimes we've got to step up amen and it's both the working of the Holy Spirit and when we see those changes coming and those changes happening we ought to be able to say praise the Lord amen I've got the utmost respect for brother Bob and brother Mark for how they stepped aside as deacons though they were still the most qualified in the church no doubt about it but yet they stepped aside and they said it's time for the younger men to get involved for the sake of the Body for the sake of the body and listen was it all easy did it all go perfectly no but we see today the fruit of that transition that change of people saying it's time for me to let go and it's time for somebody else to step up and we see that it literally improves the church cuz we don't lose the wisdom we don't lose the input but what does it causes people to dig deeper cuz now more people are relying on them brother Gerald when he finally resigned what was it he decided it's time to let it go and then he just did it no Fanfare no nothing just said I'm laying My Sword Down sends an email out and says God Bless you that's it I'm done and then he steps back what for the sake of the body I've run my course I've finished my race and that's it and there's nothing wrong with laying it down absolutely absolutely nothing wrong with it why we're not selfish we're doing what's best for the body I'm going to close with these quotes So musicians can come he says this church is supposed to be predestinated under the adoption of children where God can take a man and adopt him into the family and give him something he says then first try that and see if it's right the Bible said try the spirit this man claims a certain thing try it and see if it's right if it's his right move right with it then say Lord send us something else let's not just rest on what we have he says send us something else he says keep moving see just keep moving till every fellow takes his place watch he says then you're going to see the Church of God begin to get his place when we start to say Lord what's your will Lord what's your position what's your place where's the responsibility you want me to carry Lord what's my post of Duty he says then the Church of God begins to take its place he says then is when the Philistines will go to backing up he says the shorts will go off the hair will grow down the faces will be washed the cigars will be missing that's right when the church begins to get into its Mighty power then we have an anas of fire and a few of them he says yes sir you'll see when that Holy Church stands together in his power positionally placed as sons of God adopted into the family of God a powerful Church standing there in its Glory he says oh that's what he's coming for amen let's stand together if we would where is the power from in the body Unity when your body works together as a unit that's when it's most powerful but when you sit there and try and do things your own way it's got to be my way or the highway you know what you are a sheep alone you're a part trying to do it yourself but he's saying the power comes when we will humble ourselves and say God what's your purpose what's your place what's your plan and then help me to get there and stay there and when we do that no friction everything just works together the power goes where it needs to go to produce what the word for its time and season it's people that are led by the spirit that can be used by the spirit to produce the word of God each in its place content resting trusting satisfied that God you're using me that ought to be our desire Lord use me then let him choose how he uses us and you'll see that
