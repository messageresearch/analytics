[36:06] we're praying
[36:07] [Music]
[36:08] amen God bless you thank you musicians
[36:11] certainly appreciate sister Priscilla
[36:13] stepping up this morning it was
[36:15] interesting because I had
[36:17] put in my notes to close what this is my
[36:19] desire and she started with it and then
[36:22] underneath that I said sing thank you
[36:23] songs and brother Bob sang Too to kind
[36:25] of close it out you know so whether
[36:27] we've got the first string players or
[36:29] the second string or the third string or
[36:30] the eighth string and then God always
[36:32] moves and he grants us what we have need
[36:34] of Amen so certainly appreciate that
[36:36] just a few Updates this morning you can
[36:38] sit down if you want for just a few
[36:40] moments most of you don't know Brother
[36:42] David Nash but he's a missionary that
[36:44] has been traditionally based out of
[36:45] Washington state in the U.S but he's
[36:48] since moved down to Texas but I've known
[36:51] him for quite some years now and I'd
[36:53] reached out to him and said we want to
[36:55] support a missions group if we can or a
[36:57] missionary and he said well I don't have
[36:59] any needs right now and he hasn't had
[37:01] any needs for the last three years by
[37:03] God's grace but then he reached out and
[37:05] said I have a need I need to go to
[37:06] Honduras and Panama to preach and I
[37:09] don't have the money to do it so we paid
[37:10] for his tickets to go down so he sent us
[37:13] some pictures to myself from brother
[37:14] Mark and so on the left side is their
[37:16] youth group meeting
[37:17] this is a youth camp right here this is
[37:20] this is them preaching that's not him
[37:21] that's that's uh one of the translators
[37:23] I believe but this is their little youth
[37:25] group that they have there that they're
[37:26] preaching in uh I believe it's in Panama
[37:29] right now then on the right hand side is
[37:30] the building where they're having the
[37:32] special meeting so it's just a a covered
[37:34] open basketball uh a covered basketball
[37:36] court and they've got some plastic lawn
[37:38] chairs out there and they said they had
[37:40] 17 people there that have never heard
[37:42] the message of the hour so this is what
[37:44] it looks like there and then they go
[37:45] back into the mountains
[37:47] and these are the people that they're
[37:49] preaching to so just very humble
[37:51] dwellings humble sisters that are there
[37:53] um you know certainly not dressed or
[37:56] have the things that we do but they're
[37:57] hungry for the things of God and this is
[37:59] what he's doing as a missionaries he's
[38:01] going into places where they don't have
[38:02] a whole lot and he's sitting there and
[38:04] they're preaching them the word of God
[38:05] and signs and wonders following and it's
[38:08] just a wonderful thing so he wanted us
[38:10] to share these and as he continues on to
[38:12] the next stage of his journey no doubt
[38:13] he'll send us some pictures there but I
[38:15] wanted you to know this is your ties and
[38:18] offerings don't just support the local
[38:19] Ministry but we want to support things
[38:21] outside and I know brother Gerald has
[38:23] some some work that he does outside as
[38:24] well with other ministers but I wanted
[38:26] to kind of show you what we've done
[38:28] recently with Brother David Nash I also
[38:31] spoke with Brother John Andy's last week
[38:32] and this week and we're going to be
[38:34] having special meetings here on the
[38:36] weekend of November 18th through 20th
[38:38] he'll have three services as we
[38:40] traditionally do and so we're looking
[38:42] forward to that I spoke to Brother Steve
[38:43] Carr had a number of people reach out
[38:45] and check how the church was doing and
[38:47] how we're doing through the storm I
[38:49] think everyone thought it was hitting us
[38:50] but by God's grace it hasn't it was
[38:52] actually quite a nice day yesterday but
[38:54] brother Steve Clark sends his greetings
[38:56] as well I just got an email response
[39:00] from Brother Alec or brother Alec cater
[39:02] and just checking in with him and he
[39:05] said he was fine no damage to the place
[39:07] where he's standing they lost power for
[39:08] a little bit but otherwise he's okay I
[39:11] checked in with Brother John and sister
[39:12] Beatrix Pike in Cape Breton and that
[39:14] went right over ahead of them and he
[39:16] said we lost power but other than that
[39:18] the house is fine we're fine they have a
[39:20] generator for for things need be I
[39:22] checked in with brother Joshua Marshall
[39:23] yesterday or he checked in with me I
[39:25] should say and he said everything's fine
[39:27] there except a couple trees down so we
[39:29] thank God for that certainly it it hit
[39:31] hard and it hit harder than they thought
[39:33] it was going to hit I saw some pictures
[39:34] this morning and last night of Porter
[39:36] Bass Cape Breton pei and they truly got
[39:39] a lot of Destruction there so we
[39:42] certainly pray God's grace to them amen
[39:44] let's stand together if you would as we
[39:46] we go to the reading the word this
[39:48] morning we're going to open up in second
[39:49] Corinthians chapter 4.
[39:59] we read the scripture a couple Services
[40:01] ago and I said I was going to come back
[40:02] around and kind of tie things up in a
[40:04] hopefully in a pretty bow
[40:06] and this is the start of of that bow
[40:08] Lord willing so second Corinthians 4
[40:10] verse 10 says always bearing about in
[40:13] the body the dying of the Lord Jesus
[40:15] that the life also of Jesus might be
[40:18] manifest in our body this is the the end
[40:21] goal for the believer this is the
[40:22] purpose of the believer that the life of
[40:24] Jesus will be manifested in this body
[40:27] amen for we which live are always
[40:29] delivered unto death for Jesus sake that
[40:32] the life also of Jesus might be made
[40:34] manifest in our mortal flesh there's a
[40:36] dying out that happens daily
[40:38] so then death worketh in us but life in
[40:41] you we having the same Spirit of Faith
[40:44] according as it is written I believed
[40:47] and therefore have I spoken we also
[40:49] believe and therefore speak amen God
[40:52] bless his word you may have your seats
[40:54] this morning amen I want to continue a
[40:56] course in the series on in his form with
[40:58] his mind and I want to take a title this
[41:00] morning of the voice of abundance amen
[41:03] the voice of abundance and that like I
[41:05] said we're kind of coming to and and
[41:07] maybe the theme of this this last
[41:08] portion of this series will be on the
[41:10] speaking bride the speaking bride and
[41:13] maybe just keep that in your heads as
[41:14] we're going forth over the next couple
[41:16] of of services that as we dig into this
[41:18] that we're thinking about a speaking
[41:20] bride because if you have a body and you
[41:23] have a mind then there's going to be a
[41:25] voice that comes out of it amen we don't
[41:26] just have the body of Christ we are not
[41:28] the form of Christ and we don't just
[41:29] have the mind of Christ Christ to sit
[41:31] there and do nothing but there is a
[41:33] voice that follows that when we have the
[41:35] mind of Christ and he's working in our
[41:37] life amen and this is a this is a huge
[41:40] topic this is this I could spend months
[41:42] on this and maybe not get into it and
[41:44] and why is that it's because this
[41:47] started with the word everything started
[41:50] with the word if you go to John 1 it
[41:51] says in the beginning was the word the
[41:53] word was with God and the Word was God
[41:55] and the Word was made flesh it started
[41:57] with the word and then as we've seen
[41:59] brother Gerald draw so many times sin
[42:01] happened and we dropped out of Eternity
[42:02] we dropped out of the word into these
[42:04] these sin-filled bodies and we have that
[42:06] little bump on the on the on the circle
[42:08] of Eternity and in there the word is not
[42:11] full
[42:12] the word is not full we're out of the
[42:14] word amen and what we have is we have a
[42:16] message that comes to draw us back to
[42:18] that fullness of the word it's Alpha and
[42:20] Omega it's the start and the finish so
[42:22] we started in the word and we're going
[42:23] to finish in the word and to get there
[42:25] we've got to have the word fully
[42:26] manifested into US amen we've got to be
[42:29] fully surrendered to that and the words
[42:31] got to be expressed through a bride
[42:32] again before we get out of this Earth
[42:34] amen so the word isn't static the word
[42:37] is informal but it's alive and it's well
[42:39] and it's supposed to be in a body of
[42:41] Believers amen it's Dynamic it has power
[42:43] it has changing power it has healing
[42:45] power it has restoring power it has all
[42:47] of these things within it and what we're
[42:49] looking for is to manifest it through
[42:51] our lives amen but just to lay a
[42:53] foundation in this entire you know last
[42:56] portion of a speaking bride I want us to
[42:58] remember that a word is a thought
[43:00] expressed and brother Branham said this
[43:02] so many times amen that a word is a
[43:05] thought expressed I mean it can't just
[43:07] stay a thought but it has to come out it
[43:09] has to be spoken and it has to be
[43:11] expressed through us in amen and it's
[43:13] not a word only in your mind it's not
[43:15] only a word in your emotions but it has
[43:16] to be something that flows through your
[43:18] lips and it only becomes a thought
[43:20] Express when it comes out of your mind
[43:22] when it comes from the inspiration and
[43:24] it comes out in the muscles of your face
[43:25] conform to what your mind says it should
[43:27] do and it speaks the word of God Amen
[43:30] it's when your body verbalizes or your
[43:33] body acts on what is inside of your mind
[43:35] amen that's right and before you express
[43:37] a word you have to have a thought you
[43:39] can't say a word without a thought
[43:41] behind it there has to be something to
[43:43] inspire it to prompt it to drive it to
[43:46] cause your mouth to speak those words
[43:47] that it's going to do and it's funny
[43:49] today because we often think that people
[43:51] are speaking without thinking if you
[43:54] look at the nonsense that's going on in
[43:56] the world today people are speaking
[43:58] without thinking we would think
[43:59] but it's not true they're actually
[44:01] thinking before they speak and they
[44:03] actually sincerely believe that the
[44:05] nonsense that's coming out of their
[44:06] mouth these days is absolutely the truth
[44:08] it's right it's the way to live it's the
[44:10] way to move forward it's the way to
[44:12] progress our society they're sincere in
[44:14] their belief and while they're wrong
[44:15] they are sincere and that is what's
[44:17] causing them to speak and act the way
[44:19] they do amen
[44:20] but before we get into this I want to
[44:22] set kind of a tone here and I've read
[44:24] this quote before and I want to use it
[44:26] to kind of set us for the next three
[44:28] services probably and it says notice the
[44:31] harmony of the father and the son
[44:34] Jesus never never did anything until it
[44:38] was first showed him by the father he
[44:40] says John 5 19 the reference scripture
[44:42] he says this harmony is now to exist
[44:46] between the groom and his bride
[44:50] he shows her his Word of Life
[44:53] she receives it she never doubts it
[44:57] therefore that word therefore means
[45:00] because because she receives it because
[45:03] she never doubts it nothing can harm her
[45:06] not even death
[45:08] for if the seed be planted the water
[45:11] will raise it up again
[45:13] then he says here is the secret of this
[45:15] so listen closely he says the word is in
[45:18] the bride as it was in Mary now what was
[45:22] it before it was in Mary
[45:24] it was a thought in the mind of God
[45:26] spoken by the angel Gabriel and he says
[45:29] the Holy Spirit Will overshadow thee and
[45:31] you're going to Bear the son of God
[45:33] Emmanuel is going to come out of you
[45:35] Mary so as it was with Mary it was a
[45:38] thought it was expressed by the angel to
[45:40] her and then she received it and because
[45:43] she received it it happened
[45:45] right the word is in the bride as it was
[45:48] in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ
[45:51] for she knows what he wants done with
[45:54] the word
[45:56] she performs the command of the word in
[45:59] his name for she has thus saith the Lord
[46:02] now we covered this in earlier Services
[46:04] about how we die out we empty ourselves
[46:06] and then we're filled with something
[46:08] capital S something that is greater than
[46:10] us which is the holy spirit but that's
[46:13] not the end of the journey that's only
[46:15] the start of the real journey because
[46:16] he's wanting us to do something when he
[46:19] fills us with the Holy Spirit and it's
[46:21] to get ourselves Under full subjection
[46:22] so that we can be used amen we are here
[46:26] to express what the mind and thought and
[46:28] perfect will of God so we're looking to
[46:30] put our hands our feet our voice our
[46:33] energy into doing what he wants us to do
[46:35] for the kingdom of God and leave all
[46:38] else aside amen what did Peter say did
[46:40] we have we not left all Lord
[46:42] right can we say have we not left all I
[46:45] mean that's where we want to be is Lord
[46:46] have we not left all and are we not
[46:48] walking according to your purpose and
[46:50] plan
[46:51] but he says she has thus saith the Lord
[46:53] now that's taking it up a step isn't it
[46:56] can you say that everything I say
[46:58] everything I do how I spend my time how
[47:01] I spend my money how I spend my energy
[47:03] where I go whether I stay when I'm quiet
[47:06] when I talk can I say all of that is
[47:08] according to thus saith the Lord amen am
[47:12] I close enough to God am I sensitive
[47:14] enough to the holy spirit that when I do
[47:17] something I can say God has showed me to
[47:20] do this that I am in full compliance
[47:22] with the word of God if nothing else
[47:24] that I can have confidence that he's
[47:26] going to back me up in this situation
[47:29] that's where brother Branham is pointing
[47:31] us to this is perfect Unity here where
[47:34] you have thus saith the Lord it's not
[47:37] like you're a prophet in that sense but
[47:39] yet you have a more sure word of
[47:41] Prophecy we have a message that's been
[47:43] given to us we have a guidance we have
[47:45] an unction from the Holy Spirit we'll
[47:46] get into that leads us and guides us day
[47:49] by day and the only limitation is how
[47:51] much we'll yield
[47:53] we are the limitation it's not God
[47:55] that's holding back it's not God that's
[47:57] holding back if you are more of him it's
[47:59] because there's more of him to be had
[48:00] amen amen we'll get into this we'll
[48:03] receive but the prophet is talking about
[48:05] that the bride knows what he wants done
[48:08] with the word see you can't just read
[48:10] the word and walk off with it
[48:12] and say I'm going to do such and such
[48:14] I'm going to go such so and so I'm going
[48:16] to say this and do this no you have to
[48:18] have leadership on how to use the word
[48:20] of God
[48:21] amen guess what when Jesus went to the
[48:24] pool of Siloam he did not heal everyone
[48:26] there was power to do it all but he did
[48:30] not have authority to heal every single
[48:32] one of them right the leper only one
[48:35] came back and held on to his healing
[48:36] right there was only one woman with the
[48:39] issue of blood there was only one
[48:41] Centurion servant he did not heal
[48:43] everyone he did not deliver everyone he
[48:46] healed and delivered a lot but he did
[48:48] not heal and deliver all why because he
[48:50] was under the leadership of the holy
[48:52] spirit amen that was dwelling in him and
[48:55] so he knew what to do with the word amen
[48:58] amen I've heard brother Joe mention it I
[49:00] don't know that I've ever seen it in the
[49:02] in the message so it may have been
[49:03] hearsay but remember it was a story
[49:06] where brother Branham had those two men
[49:07] that were going around and they were so
[49:10] full of zeal but in their Zeal they were
[49:12] unwise in how they witnessed to people
[49:14] and they were causing offense where no
[49:16] offense needed to be caused
[49:18] and he said you need to be tied up to
[49:21] the snubbing post now we're not
[49:23] westerners we don't know what a snubbing
[49:24] post but a snubbing post is where you
[49:26] tie a horse so that it can't get away
[49:28] and it holds them tight it doesn't allow
[49:31] them to have freedom of movement he says
[49:32] you need to be tied down because you're
[49:34] using the word unwisely you're using
[49:37] your revelation of the word unwisely you
[49:39] have it but you don't know what to do
[49:41] with it brother bam says the bride
[49:43] performs the command of the word in his
[49:46] name because she has nothing she knows
[49:49] what he wants done so you have to be in
[49:51] the time and season
[49:52] there is a time and a season for
[49:54] everything right that means you can be
[49:57] out of the time and you can be out of
[49:58] the Season you have to be in line with
[50:00] the word not by your own interpretation
[50:02] amen you have to be under the
[50:04] inspiration for your day remember that
[50:06] they came to Jesus and they said how do
[50:09] we do the works of the Kingdom he says
[50:10] receive him who has been sent
[50:13] you've got to receive something first so
[50:15] if you're not under the inspiration of
[50:17] him who has been sent then guess what
[50:18] you're going to be off the word that's
[50:21] why we had a message was so that we know
[50:23] where we needed to go and what we needed
[50:24] to do amen and then on top of that you
[50:27] have to have the right motive and the
[50:28] right objective because you can try to
[50:30] do the right thing but if you do it for
[50:32] your own reasons and not his reasons
[50:34] then you're going to get out of step
[50:35] every time amen the perfect example is
[50:37] Moses right the greatest Prophet that
[50:39] ever lived
[50:41] aside from Christ You could argue but he
[50:43] was under the knowledge of his calling
[50:45] but he wasn't under the experience of
[50:47] his calling as a deliverer and so he
[50:49] goes out and he rescues two two
[50:51] Israelites from an Egyptian he kills the
[50:54] Egyptian
[50:55] and then the next day or two he goes and
[50:57] he sees them fighting and they he comes
[51:00] up and he tries to break apart and they
[51:01] said are you going to kill us too
[51:03] it was not the time for deliverance he
[51:06] was ahead of his time he was 42 years
[51:08] too early so even though he knew what
[51:10] had to be done he got ahead of God's
[51:13] program and all it caused was heartache
[51:14] and a dead Egyptian right that's right
[51:16] it's the same thing for us we're reading
[51:19] the word we're reading the message we're
[51:21] under the inspiration of an end time
[51:23] message but you've got to catch the time
[51:25] and season you've got to be tied to God
[51:28] Amen you've got to know what he wants
[51:30] done with it otherwise you're going to
[51:32] get disappointed every single time I
[51:35] remember I remember a brother saying I
[51:37] don't remember who it was but he was he
[51:39] was listening to a message where brother
[51:40] batam was talking about you know speak
[51:42] the word and have faith and he turned
[51:43] around and he said curtains move
[51:46] guess what the curtains didn't move
[51:49] because he was just trying to prove
[51:51] something there was no intent there was
[51:53] no glory to God coming out of it there
[51:55] was there was nothing for the kingdom of
[51:56] God but he was wanting to try and prove
[51:58] something to himself and God said okay
[52:02] and God just moved on right you've got
[52:04] to be in the anointing prophet of God
[52:06] puts it this way he says no matter how
[52:08] much you're called for the job God has
[52:10] to do the leading come on see he failed
[52:13] of all of his schooling he's talking
[52:14] about Moses and his military mind and
[52:17] his training as a great Egyptian leader
[52:18] scripture says that Moses was well
[52:21] trained he excelled in all of these
[52:22] things he had everything you would
[52:24] expect a leader to have
[52:25] he says but yet it failed because God
[52:28] had a program and we've got to work
[52:31] according to God's program no matter
[52:33] what we do we do how smart we are we've
[52:36] got to Humble ourselves and work
[52:38] according to God's program he says amen
[52:42] what is it there is a maturity that is
[52:45] required of a bride and then she has to
[52:48] know him before she knows what he wants
[52:50] done with what he has amen now for those
[52:54] of you that have been married a very
[52:55] long time we could talk to brother Gus
[52:57] and sister Elise or maybe sister Brendan
[52:59] brother Bob brother Mark sister Brenda
[53:01] brother jail sister Betty and I
[53:03] guarantee you that those women know what
[53:05] their husband wants done
[53:07] with their resources so they know how he
[53:10] wants her to spend her time the money
[53:12] how to use the vehicle where to go what
[53:15] to do how to prepare everything right
[53:17] there's probably not a lot of surprises
[53:19] left in those marriages why because
[53:20] there is a maturity in the relationship
[53:23] first and foremost and then after that
[53:26] then brother Bob doesn't have to worry
[53:28] about sister Brenda going out and
[53:29] spending 30 grand without talking to him
[53:30] if she does spend it she knows it's for
[53:33] something that he would want her to do
[53:34] it with that's the same thing with the
[53:36] bride is that you get the Holy Ghost and
[53:38] you say I'm ready to go I'm ready to go
[53:39] no no there has to come now a maturity
[53:41] within you and your relationship before
[53:44] you can ever step into what we're
[53:45] talking about here today amen now I'm
[53:48] going to go back to that quote that
[53:49] we're reading in the seven Church ages
[53:50] because I want you to see what happens
[53:52] when the bride correctly and in the
[53:55] right time and season says and does what
[53:57] God wants her to do
[53:59] it says she performs the command of the
[54:01] word in his name he says then
[54:03] then and only then the word is quickened
[54:07] by the spirit and it comes to pass so
[54:10] then the word is quick and you know what
[54:11] that means if it wasn't done correctly
[54:13] it will never be quickened it will never
[54:16] happen
[54:17] right it has to be done in the right
[54:19] time and season in the way God wants it
[54:21] and then the Holy Spirit quickens it it
[54:24] makes the word that's spoken live
[54:26] right you can claim it and preach it and
[54:29] say it until you're blue in the face but
[54:30] if it's not in God's season and Will
[54:32] it's not going to happen amen
[54:35] why because God didn't Inspire it it's
[54:38] inspiration sitting in the word but
[54:40] you've got to catch the time and season
[54:42] for it he says like a seed that is
[54:44] planted and watered it comes the whole
[54:46] full Harvest serving its purpose those
[54:49] in the bride do only his will no one can
[54:53] make them do otherwise they have thus
[54:55] saith the Lord or they keep still they
[54:58] know that it has to be God in them doing
[55:01] the works fulfilling his own words I
[55:03] want to stop right there because that is
[55:05] the only way it's ever going to happen
[55:07] is if it's him
[55:09] this this can have no part of it amen
[55:12] and I know that for myself from the
[55:14] ministry side that nothing can happen if
[55:16] I get my fingers mixed up in it if I
[55:18] start dabbling in things it messes up
[55:20] God's program it can't work that way but
[55:23] he'll do things that I am completely
[55:25] unaware of if I will just let him lead
[55:28] amen if I will just let him lead pull
[55:30] myself back and say Lord use this
[55:32] brother Brown said the gift is getting
[55:34] yourself out of the way and I have notes
[55:37] and I have notes and I have notes here
[55:38] but I can't tell you how many times I
[55:40] get off the notes and I don't know why
[55:42] and I don't know where and I just have
[55:44] to go trusting
[55:46] and it is the most difficult thing for a
[55:49] controlling engineer to do right
[55:51] but it's the same thing in our lives
[55:53] because you've got to recognize that he
[55:56] is leading and let go and let him lead
[55:58] even when it gets uncomfortable even
[56:00] when it goes off the plan that you had
[56:02] in your head
[56:03] yeah right
[56:06] they know that it has to be God in them
[56:08] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[56:11] he did not complete all his work while
[56:13] in his Earthly Ministry so now he works
[56:16] in and through the bride she knows that
[56:19] for it was not yet time for him to do
[56:22] certain things that he must now do but
[56:24] he will now now fulfill through the
[56:27] bride that work which he left for this
[56:30] specific time so there are things that
[56:34] he could not do then that he's going to
[56:36] do now and he's and it's not just
[56:38] through a prophet he did many things
[56:40] through a prophet but now he's stepping
[56:42] into that multi-member bride amen we
[56:44] know it's the end time we know it's the
[56:46] end of the Gentile dispensation we know
[56:48] it's Rapture season we know it's
[56:50] separating time we know it's manifesting
[56:51] time but we cannot make it happen by our
[56:54] will
[56:55] remember what is it what does he say I
[56:57] believe it's in Zechariah says not by
[56:59] might
[57:00] nor by power that's right but by my
[57:03] spirit saith the Lord if there's one
[57:06] thing you can catch today in in this
[57:08] entire service is that you cannot make
[57:10] it happen
[57:11] he's got a time he's got a season he's
[57:13] got a place he's got a person he's got a
[57:15] man he's got a woman that he has
[57:17] anointed to do certain things and all
[57:20] you're doing is staying in the presence
[57:22] of God to be ready willing and able amen
[57:26] amen be patient be sensitive be ready to
[57:29] go but wait for him to start you on that
[57:32] Journey amen amen have patience
[57:35] we need patience because there's a lot
[57:37] of tarrying at the end if you notice in
[57:39] the scriptures there's a lot of tearing
[57:40] and then boom it just goes all of a
[57:42] sudden and then everything happens very
[57:43] very quickly and those that didn't stick
[57:45] around during the tearing they don't get
[57:47] to go in at the end you've got to hold
[57:49] all the way to the end
[57:51] we've read this scripture and we're
[57:53] talking about the the life of Jesus
[57:54] living through us and it said we having
[57:56] the same Spirit of faith according as it
[58:00] is written I believed and therefore have
[58:02] I spoken we also believe and therefore
[58:05] speak having the same Spirit of What
[58:06] doctrine
[58:08] teaching great preaching social license
[58:10] political will
[58:11] fear distrust no The Same Spirit of
[58:15] Faith amen it's the spirit of faith that
[58:18] cause us to believe First and speak
[58:20] second now remember what faith is Faith
[58:23] is a revelation of the will of God the
[58:25] prophet said so you get a revelation of
[58:27] the will of God and that is what causes
[58:29] you to speak and so often what we get is
[58:31] a revelation of our need
[58:34] and then we speak
[58:35] but you have to get a revelation of his
[58:37] will and then speak
[58:39] because again God is doing something
[58:41] we're not like the unbeliever where God
[58:45] can kind of sovereignly jump in and jump
[58:46] out and it's a one-time deal because
[58:48] he's taking us somewhere and he's
[58:50] developing us and he's maturing us and
[58:52] he's creating and developing character
[58:54] in us and he's drawing us to something
[58:56] and he's pushing other things out so he
[58:58] works differently with a Believer than
[58:59] an unbeliever and you'll see it time and
[59:01] a time in scriptures where somebody can
[59:03] come in touch Jesus and go out and we
[59:05] never hear or see them again and that
[59:06] was fine for them but with his children
[59:08] he works a little differently because
[59:10] there's a requirement of him to take us
[59:12] to the Statue of a perfect man or woman
[59:13] in Christ so he's going to use those
[59:15] things to bring us there which means we
[59:17] don't get to jump out of the fire all
[59:18] the time that he'll turn up the heat and
[59:21] he'll turn up the heat and he'll hold us
[59:22] in a place for a while to do what get
[59:24] some of the draw so get some of the
[59:26] world out get us away from bad
[59:28] relationships get us away from bad
[59:29] influences get us to realize we're we're
[59:31] stuck on something or addicted to
[59:33] something or we're we're under the
[59:34] control of something right and then when
[59:37] that's dealt with then he'll move the
[59:38] rest of it off of us he's got a plan
[59:40] he's got a purpose in these things amen
[59:44] our fruits are known by our words and
[59:46] they often reveal or in many cases
[59:48] betray what's really inside of us in
[59:50] certain areas of Our Lives
[59:52] Luke 6 43 says for a good tree bringeth
[59:55] forth not fruit bringeth forth not
[59:58] corrupt fruit neither do the corrupt
[1:00:00] tree bring forth good fruit so if you're
[1:00:02] getting mixed signals there's a problem
[1:00:03] isn't there if one day you're good and
[1:00:05] next day you're bad then there's a
[1:00:07] problem isn't there because he says you
[1:00:08] can't bring forth both out of the same
[1:00:10] tree
[1:00:11] he says for every tree is known by his
[1:00:13] own fruit four of thorns men's do not
[1:00:15] gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather
[1:00:18] their grapes a good man out of the good
[1:00:20] Treasure of his heart bringeth forth
[1:00:22] that which is good and an evil man out
[1:00:24] of the evil Treasure of his heart
[1:00:26] bringeth forth that which is evil for of
[1:00:28] the abundance of the heart his mouth
[1:00:31] speaketh listen it's easy to say the
[1:00:34] right things in church isn't it it's
[1:00:35] easy to say the right things when you're
[1:00:36] around other believers and you're in the
[1:00:38] right atmosphere and you're under the
[1:00:39] right influence and everybody believes
[1:00:41] in and feels the way you do right
[1:00:44] but guess what religious people do that
[1:00:46] all day long
[1:00:48] every day they're in church every time
[1:00:51] they're in church every time they're
[1:00:51] around the good people that believe the
[1:00:53] way they believe everything is great but
[1:00:55] then you pull them out of it and all of
[1:00:56] a sudden guess what the words that are
[1:00:58] coming out of their mouth are not the
[1:00:59] same thing
[1:01:00] remember we're supposed to have thus
[1:01:02] saith the Lord in every aspect the way
[1:01:05] we talk the way we do things ought not
[1:01:07] to change based on who we're around
[1:01:09] now certainly we will temper things at
[1:01:11] times won't we guess what we're probably
[1:01:13] not going to talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:01:14] and the blessings of the service with
[1:01:15] our with our co-workers necessarily you
[1:01:18] know you'll lead them into those sorts
[1:01:20] of things but we ought not to to be
[1:01:23] ashamed of what we believe
[1:01:25] of what we do of how we spend our time
[1:01:28] amen they're certainly not ashamed
[1:01:31] he says if we're ashamed of him he's
[1:01:32] going to be ashamed of us I mean there
[1:01:34] ought to be no difference amen but if we
[1:01:36] say one thing and do another as the
[1:01:38] scripture is saying here
[1:01:39] then what is the problem
[1:01:41] the problem is what's inside your heart
[1:01:43] the problem is what's inside of you is
[1:01:45] not matching the words that come out and
[1:01:47] eventually your words will catch up with
[1:01:48] what's inside
[1:01:49] because that's going to come out and
[1:01:51] usually what it takes is pressure it
[1:01:52] takes disappointment it takes hurt it
[1:01:54] takes temper whatever it is it takes a
[1:01:56] time where you're not in complete
[1:01:57] control and all of a sudden those things
[1:01:59] slip out you're like whoa where did that
[1:02:01] come from
[1:02:02] amen
[1:02:04] amen
[1:02:05] and so you're saying now something's got
[1:02:08] to change in there right if you're
[1:02:10] saying you're delivered of something and
[1:02:11] then you keep going back to it then
[1:02:12] what's right your words or your life
[1:02:15] right you can't be delivered if you keep
[1:02:17] going back to it you can't say you got
[1:02:18] the victory if you keep slipping
[1:02:20] right remember I spoke a while ago where
[1:02:23] I said off times we're covering with
[1:02:24] repentance the things that actually
[1:02:25] require Deliverance when we're using the
[1:02:27] blood of Christ to cover something
[1:02:29] rather than the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:02:31] to kick it out of our life amen right to
[1:02:33] recognize what's going on that
[1:02:35] something's got a hold of us are we
[1:02:36] delivered or not because if our actions
[1:02:38] don't agree with our confession then
[1:02:40] there's a problem in there and we've got
[1:02:41] to resolve those two and bring it to a
[1:02:43] point amen funny thing is that's what
[1:02:45] the world is doing today we've got men
[1:02:46] that say I'm a woman I'm a woman
[1:02:48] and guess what that man can live like a
[1:02:51] woman all the days of his life but guess
[1:02:53] what the fruit of his life will still be
[1:02:55] that of a man he can never bring forth
[1:02:57] life the way a woman can no matter how
[1:02:59] many surgeries they do no matter how
[1:03:01] many hormones he takes his fruit will
[1:03:04] always be that of a man
[1:03:06] and yet the world will say you're a
[1:03:07] woman but guess what his life proves
[1:03:09] that he is not a woman
[1:03:11] no matter how much he shaves and how
[1:03:13] much he he primps and wears
[1:03:15] you know what I'm talking about he will
[1:03:17] never be a woman because inside he's not
[1:03:20] a woman
[1:03:21] he can't change what he is
[1:03:24] but guess what your words don't change
[1:03:26] you either
[1:03:27] but you know what the challenge for us
[1:03:29] is it's to say what the word says about
[1:03:31] us and then surrender so that the Holy
[1:03:33] Spirit can do that change Christians are
[1:03:36] the only people in the world that can
[1:03:37] change what they are in their natural
[1:03:40] ins in their natural way of things
[1:03:42] because why we're new creatures we're
[1:03:44] New Creations and then we're a new man
[1:03:46] we're a new woman in Christ we're the
[1:03:47] only ones that can actually be something
[1:03:48] different than we started out with why
[1:03:51] because we were something different in
[1:03:52] the very beginning in the very beginning
[1:03:54] that's really what we're going back to
[1:03:55] is our real self and that new birth just
[1:03:57] reveals what we were all along amen
[1:04:00] the idea is to what say what the word
[1:04:02] says and surrender to allow it to work
[1:04:04] in our lives
[1:04:05] brother Brown said but by their fruits
[1:04:07] you shall know them see your actions
[1:04:09] speak louder than what your confession
[1:04:10] proves see when you disbelieve God's
[1:04:13] word and count it as something gone by
[1:04:14] or take some book and it's dead and
[1:04:16] saying this is just as good as that it
[1:04:18] goes to show that you're not a Believer
[1:04:20] that's right you're not and if he was
[1:04:22] then you would believe God's word he
[1:04:24] would Express himself through his word
[1:04:26] now he was God's word expressed and he
[1:04:28] says now if you can't believe me he said
[1:04:30] believe the works that I do search the
[1:04:32] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:04:33] have eternal life and that's the very
[1:04:35] thing that tells who I am
[1:04:38] tells who they are too
[1:04:41] see that's the one who says who I am and
[1:04:43] the scriptures tells who I am now listen
[1:04:44] to this he says because what that's
[1:04:47] great for Jesus he says then let me take
[1:04:49] that a little further will you the
[1:04:52] scriptures is what tells what you are
[1:04:56] he says that expresses you and that
[1:05:00] expresses me I love that it's not just a
[1:05:03] prophet the word does not just Express
[1:05:05] itself through a prophet but it
[1:05:07] expresses from all the way from Brother
[1:05:08] Gus on the front to brother Ellie on the
[1:05:10] or on the back to the front every one of
[1:05:12] us the word tells us who we are and it
[1:05:15] expresses us amen what a word is a
[1:05:18] thought expressed the written word is
[1:05:21] expressed through you you are a word ex
[1:05:23] you are a thought expressed through the
[1:05:25] word amen the scriptures tell what we
[1:05:28] are it's so loud that our voice cannot
[1:05:31] be even heard now remember you know we
[1:05:34] read in the scripture say it says that
[1:05:36] he's a high priest of our confession
[1:05:38] guess what even your lack of a
[1:05:41] confession will not stop the purpose of
[1:05:42] God that's what he's saying here is that
[1:05:45] there is a word that is above all and no
[1:05:48] matter what you think or say if you're a
[1:05:50] child of his he's going to get you
[1:05:51] across the Finish Line praise the Lord
[1:05:53] for that but it's a lot easier if you'll
[1:05:55] confess with your mouth
[1:05:57] right if you'll say I'll believe what it
[1:06:00] says rather than I'm a no good do
[1:06:01] nothing
[1:06:02] right
[1:06:03] let's say what the word says about us
[1:06:05] but in the end the word has a louder
[1:06:08] voice than anything we could ever say
[1:06:09] and it's not going to return to God void
[1:06:11] without achieving what he had sent it
[1:06:12] out for amen he says our life speaks
[1:06:16] louder than our voice see and it is
[1:06:17] God's way of letting us see what we are
[1:06:21] your life
[1:06:23] is what speaks and lets us know what we
[1:06:24] are Jesus says the same thing they are
[1:06:27] they that testify me they prove what I
[1:06:28] am and which one of you can condemn me
[1:06:30] of unbelief sin listen I'm talking about
[1:06:34] looking at yourself he says if I have
[1:06:37] improperly identified myself as being
[1:06:39] what the word said that I would be
[1:06:42] what's he saying stop and take a look at
[1:06:45] your life brothers and sisters stop and
[1:06:47] take a look and see how we've changed
[1:06:50] because guess what the changing of God
[1:06:52] is rarely like that usually your new
[1:06:55] birth experience is that
[1:06:57] and occasionally there's a Deliverance
[1:06:59] where you you have a sudden thing but
[1:07:00] otherwise it's what it's line upon line
[1:07:02] word upon word it's step upon step it's
[1:07:05] Bit by Bit by Bit that we progress and
[1:07:08] so what happens is we get to the end of
[1:07:10] the year and we say not much has
[1:07:12] happened in my life
[1:07:13] but if you stop and really think about
[1:07:15] what you were doing this time last year
[1:07:17] and what you're doing this year how
[1:07:19] you're spending your time how you're
[1:07:20] reacting how you're acting the words
[1:07:22] you're saying where you're going how
[1:07:23] you're spending your time how you're
[1:07:24] spending your money how your
[1:07:26] relationships have grown or maybe they
[1:07:28] haven't I don't know but the point is to
[1:07:30] look and see and actually ask yourself
[1:07:32] have I changed
[1:07:34] that's where you're going to see
[1:07:36] something
[1:07:36] because you should be changing Amen
[1:07:39] brother Brown says if you're not going
[1:07:40] forward you're going backward you're
[1:07:42] never standing still as a Christian so
[1:07:44] the idea is we should be able to look
[1:07:45] and see I have grown
[1:07:48] guess what we don't always do it
[1:07:50] we don't always do it we have down
[1:07:52] months we have down days we have down
[1:07:54] years sometimes it seems like
[1:07:56] but you know what I find so happens so
[1:07:58] often is we get to the end of it and we
[1:08:01] say I'm so tired and I'm so worn out
[1:08:04] and we think that means we haven't
[1:08:06] progressed
[1:08:07] we think it means we've lost the victory
[1:08:09] we think it means we lost the joy do you
[1:08:12] know why you're so tired and worn out
[1:08:13] because you've been in a battle because
[1:08:16] you've been pressing because you've been
[1:08:18] moving because you've been going forward
[1:08:20] and it's not easy
[1:08:22] if you're fresh as a daisy I would
[1:08:24] question whether you've actually grown
[1:08:26] quite frankly because we're in a battle
[1:08:28] we're on a journey and it's never ever
[1:08:30] ever easy except in very small moments
[1:08:33] of time where God gives us a respite so
[1:08:35] you're tired because you're growing
[1:08:37] listen when I finish a gym workout if
[1:08:39] I'm feeling fresh as a daisy I didn't
[1:08:42] work out
[1:08:43] and as a Believer if you're always
[1:08:44] feeling fresh as a daisy it means you
[1:08:46] haven't been struggling or striving that
[1:08:49] God hasn't put you through the ringer
[1:08:50] that's a problem
[1:08:52] so you're tired and worn out so often
[1:08:54] because you're in a battle
[1:08:55] now there is a remedy for that amen
[1:08:59] but your tiredness
[1:09:01] hey look at Jesus Jesus was tired all
[1:09:03] the time have you ever noticed that he
[1:09:06] was weary he was so tired that he fell
[1:09:08] asleep in Hurricane Fiona on the Sea of
[1:09:11] Galilee
[1:09:12] that's how tired he was had he lost the
[1:09:15] victory
[1:09:16] he stood up and said peace be still
[1:09:19] yes he hadn't lost the victory but that
[1:09:21] doesn't mean our body and our mind
[1:09:22] doesn't get tired right so take heart if
[1:09:25] you're tired that's good
[1:09:27] that's good it means God's working in
[1:09:29] your life it means that you have
[1:09:30] opposition
[1:09:32] if you don't have opposition then you're
[1:09:34] with the opposition
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:37] brother bam says this and the message
[1:09:38] identification he says I wonder if we
[1:09:40] Christians could think that tonight
[1:09:41] wonder if we can look in God's looking
[1:09:44] glass of what requirements is of a
[1:09:46] Christian and identify ourselves that
[1:09:48] way I wonder if we could I wonder if we
[1:09:51] can identify ourselves tonight with John
[1:09:52] 3 16. and all the other kinds of
[1:09:55] scriptures Mark 16 and all those other
[1:09:56] places in Galatians I believe in
[1:09:58] different second Thessalonians the
[1:10:00] fruits of the spirit and so forth I
[1:10:02] wonder if we can identify ourselves
[1:10:04] Jesus said which one of you can accuse
[1:10:06] me that I haven't performed and done
[1:10:07] just exactly what the scripture said I
[1:10:09] would do nobody could say a word because
[1:10:12] he had truly identified himself look in
[1:10:16] the word so often we have a Christianity
[1:10:18] of relativism
[1:10:20] I look and I compare myself to brother
[1:10:22] Ellie and I say I'm either better or
[1:10:24] worse and if I'm worse than I try and do
[1:10:26] better and if I'm better than I say I'm
[1:10:28] good to go
[1:10:29] that's not it
[1:10:30] right we're all at different levels on
[1:10:32] the ladder but we've got to keep moving
[1:10:35] and so often what we're saying is that
[1:10:37] well I'm doing better than they are so
[1:10:39] I'm I'm pretty good no no no that has
[1:10:41] nothing to do with it lesson some bring
[1:10:43] forth 30-fold 60-fold and 100 fold the
[1:10:46] goal is to get to a hundred
[1:10:48] right
[1:10:49] the goals get to 100 so if you're 60
[1:10:51] comparing yourself to somebody that's a
[1:10:52] 30-fold Christian that's not what it's
[1:10:54] about it's will you keep maturing and
[1:10:56] growing to go all the way amen we're
[1:10:58] talking about the voice of abundance
[1:10:59] today but before our voice speaks the
[1:11:02] thought must first exist amen we must
[1:11:04] believe and be convinced before we'll
[1:11:07] speak something that's right we have to
[1:11:09] amen we read the scripture that says out
[1:11:10] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:11:12] speaketh
[1:11:13] what does that mean what does abundance
[1:11:15] mean
[1:11:16] abundance means whatever is most
[1:11:18] plentiful
[1:11:20] whatever has the the advantage whatever
[1:11:24] is greatest inside of you is what's
[1:11:27] going to speak out of you amen is what's
[1:11:29] going to project out of you is what's
[1:11:30] going to live out of you in the end amen
[1:11:32] whatever is winning the battle inside of
[1:11:34] you that's how you know what you have an
[1:11:36] abundance of whatever is winning the
[1:11:37] battle inside of you
[1:11:39] that's what you're going to speak out of
[1:11:41] and that's what you're going to live out
[1:11:42] of Amen so whatever you're most
[1:11:44] convinced is important and valuable to
[1:11:47] you is what you're going to have inside
[1:11:48] of you
[1:11:49] right right because it's a treasure
[1:11:51] remember the scripture says a good man
[1:11:52] out of the good Treasure of his heart
[1:11:54] and the evil man are the evil treasure
[1:11:56] listen an evil person Treasures evil and
[1:11:59] a good man Treasures good
[1:12:01] so if you're speaking out of evil what
[1:12:04] does that mean is inside
[1:12:06] it means there's something evil imagine
[1:12:08] if you're speaking good it means there's
[1:12:09] something good inside of you amen you
[1:12:11] can call yourself a Christian but if all
[1:12:13] you talk about is sports then guess what
[1:12:15] the word is not in abundance
[1:12:17] if all you speak about is politics then
[1:12:19] guess what the word is not in abundance
[1:12:21] if all you speak about is making money
[1:12:23] then guess what the word is not in
[1:12:25] abundance if all you speak about is your
[1:12:27] career then guess what the word is not
[1:12:29] in abundance because that is the
[1:12:31] consuming fire that's inside of you is
[1:12:33] what you're what you're talking about
[1:12:34] all the time amen now you're saying well
[1:12:36] brother John we have to talk about
[1:12:37] things hey the the the political world
[1:12:40] is insane right now the the social world
[1:12:43] is insane right now the economic world
[1:12:45] is insane the environmental world is
[1:12:47] unseen the entire world is insane you
[1:12:49] say we've got to talk about these things
[1:12:50] and we do but we have to talk about them
[1:12:53] through the filter of the word of God
[1:12:55] and the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:12:57] that has sent us a message today to tell
[1:12:59] us how to respond to those things amen
[1:13:01] we don't talk about it the way the world
[1:13:03] talks when I talk to my colleagues
[1:13:04] they're so down in the mouth and they're
[1:13:06] worried and they're tired and they're
[1:13:08] sick of everything that's going on and
[1:13:10] they have no Solutions but they can
[1:13:12] identify problems
[1:13:14] listen the Christian's way is not to
[1:13:16] identify problems
[1:13:18] ever
[1:13:19] ever
[1:13:21] it's to put it through the word and come
[1:13:24] out with what God's doing in the entire
[1:13:25] situation amen so if your conversation
[1:13:28] is filtered by the word
[1:13:30] then now you we know what's inside of
[1:13:32] you and if your conversation is not
[1:13:33] filtered by the word how do you know it
[1:13:35] because you're identifying problems
[1:13:38] all you're doing is looking at the
[1:13:39] symptoms all you're looking at is
[1:13:40] circumstances rather than where those
[1:13:42] are going to take you amen so what
[1:13:45] happens is is what's in abundance
[1:13:47] overpowers everything else and that's
[1:13:49] what you're speaking about now amen you
[1:13:51] look at the abundance of the things that
[1:13:53] are dark and wrong in this country and
[1:13:56] if you're not in the word then you're
[1:13:57] going to say we're going to hell in a
[1:13:59] handbasket
[1:14:00] but if you're filtering it through the
[1:14:01] word you're going to say the Rapture is
[1:14:03] getting close even so come Lord Jesus
[1:14:06] can we please get out of here right
[1:14:08] we're not trying to fix it we're trying
[1:14:10] to leave it we're understanding the
[1:14:12] effect is to get us to look up because
[1:14:14] his redemption's drawing not that the
[1:14:16] change of our bodies is here and we're
[1:14:18] shaping up so we can ship out that's
[1:14:20] what I would look for in a Believer is
[1:14:22] that we say even so come Lord Jesus not
[1:14:24] we need to fix this it is unfixable it's
[1:14:27] been unfixable since 1956.
[1:14:30] right when they turned down Christ for
[1:14:32] the last time and the prophet indicted
[1:14:33] them for the second crucifixion amen
[1:14:35] amen if you're in the abundance of the
[1:14:37] word and things get difficult at work
[1:14:38] what do you say all that live Godly and
[1:14:40] Christ shall suffer persecution praise
[1:14:42] the Lord
[1:14:43] it's got to happen it's got to happen
[1:14:45] all that suffer all all Every Christian
[1:14:49] will suffer persecution
[1:14:51] there's no getting out of it
[1:14:54] yeah I I would expect that most of us
[1:14:55] had already faced it even our kids are
[1:14:57] facing it to a degree at the Baptist
[1:14:59] school because they don't believe the
[1:15:00] way they believe
[1:15:02] you're going to have to deal with
[1:15:03] difficulties and the filter of the word
[1:15:05] will tell you that what this is
[1:15:06] something that God's using this is
[1:15:08] something that God's prophesied
[1:15:09] therefore it's a good thing let's keep
[1:15:11] moving on
[1:15:12] amen otherwise what happens is we're
[1:15:14] full of what discontent and no matter
[1:15:16] how much we try what we're going to come
[1:15:18] out with is dark thoughts
[1:15:21] right because we're not looking at it
[1:15:23] the way God looks at it we're not using
[1:15:25] the message that we've been given that's
[1:15:26] opened up the word opened up our eyes to
[1:15:29] see what's going to happen
[1:15:30] and so we're there and we're getting
[1:15:31] down and down and down and we won't have
[1:15:33] joy or peace no matter what because
[1:15:34] we're looking at the world as if that's
[1:15:36] going to be resolved it's not he's going
[1:15:38] to burn it listen God says it's so bad I
[1:15:42] can't even fix it
[1:15:44] yeah so I'll just wipe it off yeah not
[1:15:46] saying he can't fix it but his way of
[1:15:47] fixing it is to destroy it right
[1:15:50] come on Amen
[1:15:52] listen
[1:15:54] let me get down to home
[1:15:57] the way you think about the people
[1:15:59] around you
[1:16:00] will show what's inside of you
[1:16:03] the way you think about your spouse if
[1:16:04] you're married will show what's inside
[1:16:06] of you because guess what except for my
[1:16:08] wife none of you are married to a
[1:16:10] perfect spouse
[1:16:13] wow wow amen we know brother Grant is
[1:16:17] getting he's getting he's getting uh
[1:16:19] down home with us he's getting used to
[1:16:21] us when he says wow to the minister
[1:16:22] behind the pulpit
[1:16:24] but Hey listen none of us are perfect
[1:16:26] and nobody knows my faults and failings
[1:16:30] like my wife does
[1:16:32] because she sees me in my highs and my
[1:16:34] lows my ins and my outs all these
[1:16:35] different things doesn't she
[1:16:37] and she can sit there and she can dwell
[1:16:38] all day long on what I'm not
[1:16:40] and you know what's going to end up
[1:16:42] she's going to be unhappy I'm going to
[1:16:44] be unhappy and it's going to drive our
[1:16:46] marriage into a spiral
[1:16:48] and guess what I can do the same thing
[1:16:49] with her because I know her faults too
[1:16:51] both of them
[1:16:55] right
[1:16:56] but listen what we dwell on shows what's
[1:16:59] in abundance
[1:17:01] because remember a word is a thought
[1:17:04] expressed so her words to me will tell
[1:17:06] me what she's been thinking about
[1:17:09] and my words to her will tell her what
[1:17:12] I've been thinking about her
[1:17:14] amen
[1:17:16] a word is a thought expressed
[1:17:19] the idea is to express what the word
[1:17:20] says about your spouse
[1:17:23] to focus on what's good and commit
[1:17:25] what's not so good to God understanding
[1:17:28] that so often what's bad about them is
[1:17:29] what's good in you and that's why he's
[1:17:31] given him or her you
[1:17:34] is so that you can bolster them up not
[1:17:36] tear them down
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:38] amen Philippians 4 8 says finally
[1:17:41] brethren whatsoever things are true
[1:17:45] whatsoever things are honest
[1:17:47] whatsoever things are just
[1:17:50] can I jump back to honesty
[1:17:52] don't start with honest with the other
[1:17:54] person
[1:17:55] start with honesty with yourself
[1:17:58] okay it's the only place you'll ever get
[1:18:00] anywhere with God is honesty with
[1:18:02] yourself right say Lord I'm looking at
[1:18:05] me the only person I have control of in
[1:18:07] this entire world is me
[1:18:09] and even then only barely right
[1:18:13] start with yourself whatsoever things
[1:18:16] are honest whatsoever things are just
[1:18:17] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:18:20] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:18:22] of good report
[1:18:23] that means good to be talked about
[1:18:26] testimonies
[1:18:28] confessions
[1:18:30] of the word of God
[1:18:32] it says if there be any virtue and if
[1:18:35] there be any praise think on these
[1:18:37] things so in other words if there's
[1:18:39] anything that you can think of that will
[1:18:41] help you strengthen you encourage you or
[1:18:43] cause you to lift someone or something
[1:18:45] up in a Godly way be thankful and have
[1:18:48] an attitude of praise and dwell on those
[1:18:50] things and leave the rest with God
[1:18:52] amen that's right
[1:18:54] that's the filter of the word now that
[1:18:57] will allow what a word to be a true
[1:18:59] thought of God expressed dwell on the
[1:19:02] things that he tells you to dwell on and
[1:19:04] you'll get the results that he tells you
[1:19:05] you're going to get
[1:19:06] amen
[1:19:08] the abundance inside of us will win
[1:19:09] every single time
[1:19:11] every single time and like I said so
[1:19:13] often our words will betray us before
[1:19:15] our life ever expresses it I've said it
[1:19:18] before over the pulpit but you know when
[1:19:20] I was a deacon especially back in in out
[1:19:22] west and so many people are your friends
[1:19:24] on there and you'd see things that they
[1:19:26] say or like and do and it would be a an
[1:19:29] inner look into their life way ahead of
[1:19:31] before them ever leaving the message
[1:19:33] and I'd see it coming months and months
[1:19:35] ahead of time just based on the little
[1:19:37] things that they were liking or
[1:19:38] responding to or their words even to
[1:19:40] other believers
[1:19:42] why because they were feeding on
[1:19:44] something and it was an abundance that
[1:19:45] was what welling up and coming out of
[1:19:47] them and they couldn't contain it one
[1:19:49] way or the other
[1:19:51] right your light will eventually reflect
[1:19:53] and bear fruit based on what's in
[1:19:55] abundance inside of you amen amen we're
[1:19:57] talking about this theme of a speaking
[1:19:59] bride today and I want to tie that with
[1:20:00] this thought of abundance so first John
[1:20:03] 2 18 says little children it is the last
[1:20:05] time
[1:20:06] it's the last time
[1:20:08] and as you have heard that Antichrist
[1:20:10] shall come even now there are many
[1:20:13] antichrists so they had them then
[1:20:15] they're definitely going to have them
[1:20:16] now that's Alpha right that's Alpha
[1:20:17] Church we're Omega Church right so
[1:20:19] you've got Antichrist then he says but
[1:20:21] many are going to come
[1:20:22] right
[1:20:23] and many they're already now whereby we
[1:20:26] know that it is the last time what does
[1:20:28] Christ mean Christ means anointed one so
[1:20:31] he says there are going to be many
[1:20:33] anointed ones that are opposite of what
[1:20:36] Christ's anointing was
[1:20:37] there were many then there's going to be
[1:20:39] even more now amen they'll think they're
[1:20:41] anointed they'll act like they're
[1:20:43] anointed and believe me they are
[1:20:44] anointed but there is something that's
[1:20:46] wrong in that anointing there's
[1:20:47] something that's wrong in the in the
[1:20:49] vessel that is being anointed amen they
[1:20:51] profess to be like Christ but they are
[1:20:53] not like him
[1:20:55] John says here they went out from us but
[1:20:58] they were not of us this is what happens
[1:21:00] to an antichrist spirit is they leave
[1:21:02] the word
[1:21:04] he says for if there have been of us
[1:21:05] they would no doubt have continued with
[1:21:07] us but they went out that they them that
[1:21:09] they might
[1:21:11] but be made manifest that they were not
[1:21:13] all of us now notice these Spirits
[1:21:15] manifest themselves amen It's
[1:21:16] manifesting Time and manifesting Time
[1:21:19] causes what
[1:21:20] separation
[1:21:21] always separation because how can two
[1:21:23] walk together unless they agree
[1:21:25] oftentimes we don't realize there's a
[1:21:27] disagreement because it's buried inside
[1:21:28] that person but it eventually comes out
[1:21:30] and they leave what the reveal word of
[1:21:33] the hour amen we're not talking here
[1:21:35] because this is used as a weapon I've
[1:21:37] heard it too many times you leave our
[1:21:39] church then this is your scripture this
[1:21:42] is not about leaving this church amen
[1:21:44] this is a local body and God adds and he
[1:21:47] removes as he would amen not everybody
[1:21:49] has to come here
[1:21:51] right and not everybody has to stay here
[1:21:54] right but it's whether you leave the
[1:21:56] word is what we're looking at not
[1:21:58] whether or not you leave this church
[1:21:59] what is this church it's just one of
[1:22:01] many one of many where there are you
[1:22:03] know you there's there's a bazillion out
[1:22:05] there with god-filled Holy Ghost
[1:22:06] anointed Ministry and people to be a
[1:22:08] part of Amen we have no claim on anybody
[1:22:10] here amen God leads his children
[1:22:12] sovereignly
[1:22:14] now verse 20 says but ye have an unction
[1:22:17] from the Holy One and know all things
[1:22:21] why why do we know all things personal
[1:22:24] knowledge education years of ministry
[1:22:26] years under the message
[1:22:30] parents raised me right
[1:22:32] great husband great wife
[1:22:34] no he says because you have an unction
[1:22:36] from the Holy One
[1:22:39] he says you know all things and when you
[1:22:41] look into this it doesn't mean that you
[1:22:43] know everything that you don't have this
[1:22:45] entire Encyclopedia of knowledge or
[1:22:47] understanding because none of us do
[1:22:49] that's an attribute of God the sole
[1:22:52] attribute of God that we don't get to
[1:22:54] tap into amen but what it means is you
[1:22:56] know all things that you need for this
[1:22:59] life
[1:23:00] it means that whatever you have need of
[1:23:02] knowing god provides it
[1:23:04] that God has a is a resource that's
[1:23:06] available and he has made himself
[1:23:08] available through the Holy Spirit to let
[1:23:10] you know what you need to know it means
[1:23:12] that you know the truth
[1:23:15] and guess what I don't need to know the
[1:23:16] truth about situations that I'm not in
[1:23:19] I don't need to know the truth about
[1:23:20] things that don't affect my life but I
[1:23:22] do need to know the truth about what I'm
[1:23:23] going through and where I'm at in life
[1:23:25] amen so so you know the truth for your
[1:23:28] life for your decisions your challenges
[1:23:29] and that's what counts is that God is
[1:23:31] there to lead us and guide us and he
[1:23:33] calls it an unction from the Holy One
[1:23:35] John finishes and says I have not
[1:23:37] written unto you because you know not
[1:23:38] the truth but because you know it and
[1:23:41] that no lie is of the truth now listen
[1:23:43] to the prophet of God puts it he says
[1:23:46] Lord surely the people would know that
[1:23:47] your servants standing here with not an
[1:23:49] Earthly way of knowing that there's a
[1:23:52] spiritual contact between these people
[1:23:53] and thy servant
[1:23:55] he's saying surely they know that this
[1:23:57] is not me that's doing this up here
[1:23:59] he said and I'm trying to tell them that
[1:24:01] it's your Divine gift that was sent down
[1:24:03] from glory to manifest your presence as
[1:24:06] you told Nathanael before Philip called
[1:24:08] you when you were under the tree I knew
[1:24:10] you
[1:24:12] right brother Branham didn't know them
[1:24:16] what was it the angel of the Lord knew
[1:24:18] them
[1:24:19] amen he's just transmitting
[1:24:22] what God has already seen what God has
[1:24:25] already said what God's going to do even
[1:24:27] he says you told the woman about her
[1:24:29] sins you told them where to find the
[1:24:31] mules you knew where the fish was that
[1:24:32] had a coin in his mouth you know all
[1:24:35] things
[1:24:36] that's where the all things knowing
[1:24:39] comes from he says you know all things
[1:24:41] and listen to what he says and you
[1:24:43] reveal them to us as we serve you
[1:24:49] amen so without serving you're never
[1:24:51] gonna know
[1:24:52] but with serving you will know all the
[1:24:54] things you need to know
[1:24:56] and we know you said these things that I
[1:24:58] do greater shall you for I go unto my
[1:25:01] father he says and your spirit is here
[1:25:04] manifesting now I want to jump back to
[1:25:06] the scripture we just read where John
[1:25:07] says we know all things because we have
[1:25:09] an unction from the Holy One and that
[1:25:12] word unction is is very interesting
[1:25:13] because it's only used once in the Bible
[1:25:16] right here
[1:25:18] and that's it it's never used anywhere
[1:25:19] else that word unction means anointing
[1:25:22] anything smeared on an ointment usually
[1:25:25] prepared by the Hebrews from oil and
[1:25:28] aromatic herbs anointing was the
[1:25:31] inaugural ceremony for priests referring
[1:25:34] to the Teaching Ministry of the Holy
[1:25:35] Spirit guiding the receptive believer
[1:25:39] into the fullness of God's perfect will
[1:25:42] fullness of God's perfect will that's
[1:25:46] what that word unction means but the
[1:25:49] real word of it means to anoint by
[1:25:51] rubbing or pouring olive oil on someone
[1:25:54] to represent the flow the empowering
[1:25:58] flow of the Holy Spirit it says
[1:26:01] anointing literally involved rubbing
[1:26:03] olive oil on the head especially to
[1:26:06] present someone as divinely authorized
[1:26:08] meaning appointed by God to serve as a
[1:26:12] prophet a priest or a king
[1:26:16] now guess what we are not classified as
[1:26:18] Prophets
[1:26:19] but we are classified as priests and
[1:26:21] Kings aren't we
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:23] so this you remember in the scripture
[1:26:26] that Unity is likened under the oil that
[1:26:28] flowed down over Aaron's beard Aaron was
[1:26:30] the high priest remember the first high
[1:26:32] priest right it says Unity anointing or
[1:26:35] Unity is like that oil that flowed over
[1:26:38] the anointing what is it it is an
[1:26:40] abundance of the presence the anointing
[1:26:42] of God so much so that it doesn't just
[1:26:44] get the top of your head wet but it
[1:26:46] comes down and it completely and he
[1:26:49] didn't have a nice trimmed beard like I
[1:26:50] have he had a lot more hair on top too
[1:26:52] I'm sure I was sure Yesterday by a woman
[1:26:55] I think that was getting paid by the
[1:26:56] pound but
[1:26:58] but there was enough oil poured on him
[1:27:01] that it didn't just kind of anoint the
[1:27:04] top of his head but it came and it
[1:27:06] soaked his entire head until it flowed
[1:27:09] down through his beard it made a mess
[1:27:13] right but what it represents the will of
[1:27:17] God by his anointing soaking and
[1:27:20] saturating you
[1:27:22] that's what it represented amen
[1:27:24] I want you to catch something about this
[1:27:26] because we think of anointing as just
[1:27:28] well I'll just pour a little bit of oil
[1:27:30] on you know if if I had this cup and
[1:27:32] this was oil and I just you know anoint
[1:27:34] me brother John we just we just pour a
[1:27:35] little bit right when you come up for a
[1:27:37] prayer you know we've got we've got the
[1:27:39] oil here do we dump it over your head
[1:27:41] no we just take a little bit and we
[1:27:42] anoint your forehead right that's what
[1:27:44] we would tend to think anointing is amen
[1:27:46] but an unction which is an anointing
[1:27:49] first service does not just involve a
[1:27:51] pouring
[1:27:53] but it's a rubbing they would literally
[1:27:55] take that oil and they would rub it into
[1:27:57] the person's head
[1:28:00] right
[1:28:01] almost like they were massaging the
[1:28:03] scalp right and this oil there was so
[1:28:05] much of it and they were just just
[1:28:07] working it into that person's head
[1:28:10] so that what when they walked away there
[1:28:12] was no pretending that they hadn't been
[1:28:14] anointed right it wasn't just on them
[1:28:16] but it was now in them that the the
[1:28:18] pores of their skin had soaked up that
[1:28:20] oil that it was now a part of their head
[1:28:22] at least for the next little while amen
[1:28:25] remember the you know you you don't get
[1:28:28] that kind of an anointing with just a
[1:28:32] quick drop
[1:28:33] you know we talk about a Splash and Dash
[1:28:35] do you know what a Splash and Dash is
[1:28:36] it's a racing term where they come in
[1:28:38] they just need enough gas to get across
[1:28:40] the finish line so they just put in a
[1:28:41] little bit extra and then they go out
[1:28:43] this is not a Splash and Dash This is a
[1:28:46] stain there and the oil is just pouring
[1:28:48] and I'm almost thinking it's like they
[1:28:50] got a one gallon bucket
[1:28:51] and they're just there and it's soaking
[1:28:53] his entire head and then they get in and
[1:28:55] they start to rub it into his head
[1:28:58] that's what this is talking about this
[1:29:00] unction is when what you're in the
[1:29:02] presence of God so much and for so long
[1:29:05] that it saturates your entire mind that
[1:29:08] it saturates your being that you can't
[1:29:10] escape from it
[1:29:12] if most of us said how if I if I said
[1:29:15] brother or sister how much do you want
[1:29:17] to be Anointed with oil this morning
[1:29:18] we'd say just just a little just give me
[1:29:21] a little right we just need a
[1:29:23] representation brother John this is not
[1:29:25] what this is talking about
[1:29:27] this is talking about a soaking a
[1:29:29] saturating where you are literally
[1:29:30] bathed in oil
[1:29:33] and it's a part of you and guess what
[1:29:35] you walk out and everybody knows you've
[1:29:37] been anointed
[1:29:38] everybody knows you have an unction
[1:29:41] because you've been in the oil you've
[1:29:43] been in the presence of God Amen
[1:29:47] I imagine it wasn't a fun time for those
[1:29:49] priests to sit there
[1:29:52] and that oil is just going all over them
[1:29:55] ruining their clothes
[1:29:57] ruining their hairstyle
[1:30:01] right
[1:30:02] sometimes in church what holds us back
[1:30:05] how are we going to look after this is
[1:30:06] done
[1:30:08] right
[1:30:09] how are we going to look if
[1:30:11] we're shouting and dancing and praising
[1:30:13] or Screaming or crying blubbering at the
[1:30:15] altar
[1:30:16] going up one more time
[1:30:19] nobody else seems to go up except for me
[1:30:23] you've got to be willing to stay there
[1:30:25] to get the unction you've got to be
[1:30:27] willing to get in the presence of God
[1:30:29] and stay there until he gives you what
[1:30:32] you need to get the job done
[1:30:34] amen what it might be longer than you
[1:30:37] prefer and it might take more than you
[1:30:39] prefer but it'll be just enough to meet
[1:30:41] what God needs out of you amen he'll
[1:30:44] give you as much as you want to amen
[1:30:46] amen this is the only place like I said
[1:30:48] in scripture that's used and it's tied
[1:30:49] to what bringing you to the truth
[1:30:52] to a place where you know all things
[1:30:55] that you need to know for your life amen
[1:30:57] amen it's not always about words
[1:31:00] sometimes you know we're talking about a
[1:31:01] speaking bride and we're talking about a
[1:31:03] voice of abundance but it's about
[1:31:04] knowing how to act
[1:31:05] how to react how to be quiet
[1:31:08] how to reach out how to stay back
[1:31:10] sometimes it's all these things it's
[1:31:11] about the leading of the of the Holy
[1:31:13] Spirit I've been reading the book of
[1:31:14] Acts again in my devotions and it's
[1:31:16] amazing to me how many times they were
[1:31:18] checked by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:20] because so often we're thinking go go go
[1:31:22] but guess what there was plenty of don't
[1:31:25] go don't go don't go
[1:31:27] Hold Steady stay here
[1:31:29] right and so many times in the end they
[1:31:32] would stay someplace for months
[1:31:34] sometimes a year and in the end that
[1:31:36] City would reject them and then they
[1:31:37] move on and you'd say Lord why did I
[1:31:39] stick around
[1:31:39] what was that all for we got 12 people
[1:31:42] 12 people Lord for a year surely there's
[1:31:45] a better Harvest someplace else but the
[1:31:47] Holy Spirit told them where to stay and
[1:31:48] they stayed there until it moved on what
[1:31:50] do we see it in the children of Israel
[1:31:51] right when the cloud moved they moved
[1:31:54] and when it stopped they stopped
[1:31:56] and it was what it was a it was a shadow
[1:31:58] by day was a guard by day was a
[1:32:00] protection by day then at night it was a
[1:32:02] light to guard them amen
[1:32:06] you do that
[1:32:07] you get a relunction one time
[1:32:10] and you'll know what it means to find
[1:32:12] the will and purpose of God
[1:32:14] but you've got to get it the first time
[1:32:15] you got to stay there long enough you
[1:32:17] got to soak it up you got to stay in the
[1:32:19] presence of God until you say Lord I
[1:32:22] know what you want me to do
[1:32:24] and that's why we can't get in a hurry
[1:32:27] it's also why you got to be prayed up
[1:32:29] and in a strong relationship with God so
[1:32:31] that when you do have to make a snap
[1:32:32] decision
[1:32:34] you're ready to go because what you know
[1:32:37] what it means to get in his presence and
[1:32:38] get the answer and to move on by faith
[1:32:40] amen you got to be ready for the times
[1:32:43] when you don't have time to prepare
[1:32:44] remember brother Brown said David was
[1:32:46] prayed up
[1:32:47] when he went to hickle when he went
[1:32:48] after Goliath David didn't have to get
[1:32:49] prayed up didn't have to get right he
[1:32:51] didn't have to repent he was able to go
[1:32:53] right into battle because he was already
[1:32:54] right with God he was close with God he
[1:32:56] knew what God wanted him to do
[1:32:58] brother Brown says now if in your life
[1:33:00] you have an absolute you do things
[1:33:02] ordinarily you would not do
[1:33:04] especially if you have a god-centered
[1:33:06] life the god-centered life makes a
[1:33:08] person do things that ordinarily they
[1:33:10] would not do very odd peculiar why is a
[1:33:13] Christian life so odd and peculiar it's
[1:33:15] because they're looking to God's word
[1:33:17] which is almost foreign to the world
[1:33:19] today it is foreign we're well past the
[1:33:22] almost foreign it's completely foreign
[1:33:24] where even suppose Christians don't even
[1:33:26] know what the word of God says he says
[1:33:28] now we have churches we have
[1:33:29] organizations we have religion or much
[1:33:30] of it around the world but that isn't
[1:33:32] what I'm talking about I'm talking about
[1:33:34] an absolute connected with Christ then
[1:33:37] it makes you an odd person you do odd
[1:33:39] things your thinking is altogether
[1:33:41] different than the thinking you once did
[1:33:43] because you found something that you've
[1:33:46] anchored of faith in someone that
[1:33:47] created the heavens and earth that his
[1:33:49] very word is itself is creative a God
[1:33:52] who spoke the world into existence and
[1:33:54] there is nothing too hard for him
[1:33:56] listen to this he says so it makes you
[1:33:59] creative yourself because you take his
[1:34:02] words
[1:34:03] and a word is a thought expressed
[1:34:07] we're going to be getting in to speak
[1:34:08] the word in the next couple of services
[1:34:09] but this is where it starts he says you
[1:34:12] take his words
[1:34:14] that's what the unction is for is that
[1:34:16] you get his words you get his plan you
[1:34:19] get his purpose you get his will and
[1:34:20] then you speak and move
[1:34:24] he says now Paul had got into that state
[1:34:26] to where he had not had a theological
[1:34:28] experience altogether but he had a
[1:34:30] personal witness he had met God one and
[1:34:34] two he knew that he was called of God
[1:34:36] and nobody had to tell him anything
[1:34:38] about it he was absolutely sure that God
[1:34:41] still remained God if the world could
[1:34:44] just do that
[1:34:45] if this group tonight sitting here could
[1:34:48] just remember that God is still God he's
[1:34:50] just as able to answer in this case at
[1:34:53] his as he is in the case of Divine
[1:34:54] Healing or anything else he is still God
[1:34:57] and if we can build our hopes not only
[1:34:59] our hopes but a positive thought upon
[1:35:02] what he says and we know that it is the
[1:35:05] truth
[1:35:06] he says and people act funny they seem
[1:35:09] to just forget about the negative side
[1:35:11] because they have found an absolute
[1:35:13] because it's the word of God Jesus said
[1:35:16] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:35:19] word will never fail
[1:35:20] so if we've got the Word of Promise then
[1:35:23] there's no failing to it it cannot fail
[1:35:26] we're talking about the voice of
[1:35:28] abundance this morning amen
[1:35:30] if we've got the Word of Promise then
[1:35:31] there's no failing to it it cannot fail
[1:35:35] back in John 1 2 it says let us
[1:35:36] therefore let that therefore abide in
[1:35:39] you which ye have heard from the
[1:35:40] beginning if that which you have heard
[1:35:42] from the beginning shall remain in you
[1:35:44] you shall also continue in the Sun and
[1:35:46] in the father what was the promise I
[1:35:48] heard from the beginning
[1:35:49] it's a Book of Joel that they expressed
[1:35:51] in Acts 2 38 amen repent and be baptized
[1:35:53] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:35:55] remission of sins and you'll receive the
[1:35:56] gift of the Holy Ghost he says that's
[1:35:58] what's going to carry you through and
[1:36:00] this is the promise that he hath
[1:36:01] promised us even eternal life
[1:36:04] these things have I written unto you
[1:36:06] concerning them that seduce you but the
[1:36:09] anointing which ye have received of him
[1:36:10] abideth in you and you need not that any
[1:36:12] man teach you but as the same anointing
[1:36:15] teacheth you of all things and is truth
[1:36:18] and is no lie and even as it had taught
[1:36:21] you you shall abide in him
[1:36:23] remember where we were talking about ye
[1:36:25] know all things he says as the same
[1:36:27] anointing teacheth you of all things
[1:36:30] and his truth and is no lie even as is
[1:36:32] taught you you shall abide in him I want
[1:36:34] to stop here because we read about the
[1:36:35] false Christ amen the false anointed
[1:36:38] ones earlier and then John rolls around
[1:36:39] he says but there is a real anointing
[1:36:41] there is a real Christ
[1:36:43] amen you are a real Christ if you have
[1:36:46] this anointing because that's what's
[1:36:48] going to teach you as you move through
[1:36:49] life
[1:36:50] but I want you to catch what he says in
[1:36:52] 26 because you've got to discern between
[1:36:54] the real anointing and the Antichrist
[1:36:57] anointing it's an anointing but it's an
[1:36:59] antichrist anointing and verse 26 it
[1:37:02] says that
[1:37:03] always looks like I cut it out
[1:37:06] in verse 26 it says concerning them that
[1:37:09] seduce you the Antichrist spirit is
[1:37:12] seductive because why it wasn't the
[1:37:14] original in the in the Garden of Eden it
[1:37:16] was seductive but it was seductive
[1:37:19] physically and guess what in this time
[1:37:21] what does it do it seduces You by
[1:37:24] telling you what you want to hear
[1:37:26] right remember because they Heap to
[1:37:27] themselves teachers having itching ears
[1:37:29] and so the anointing the Antichrist
[1:37:31] anointing is for those that will go to
[1:37:33] Ministries that tell them what they want
[1:37:35] to hear that well what mollify them so
[1:37:38] that they don't get convicted that will
[1:37:40] tell them they're fine to keep living
[1:37:42] the way they are keep doing things the
[1:37:43] way they're doing to be tied to the
[1:37:45] world and tied to Christ at the same
[1:37:47] time that will let them stay where they
[1:37:49] are
[1:37:50] that's the seduction is you're good the
[1:37:52] Way You Are
[1:37:54] don't worry about it don't worry about
[1:37:56] it don't think about what that's what a
[1:37:58] brother I'm saying he'd say don't don't
[1:38:00] tell me what your pastor says don't tell
[1:38:02] me what the clergy say don't tell me
[1:38:03] what your denomination says tell me what
[1:38:05] the word says
[1:38:07] right and that's what a seductive Spirit
[1:38:09] does is it tells you what you want to
[1:38:10] hear rather than what the word says you
[1:38:12] should hear amen it won't tell you what
[1:38:14] the full words of God says amen that's
[1:38:16] the telltale signs if you're sitting
[1:38:18] under a Ministry that will only confirm
[1:38:20] where you are without taking you further
[1:38:21] it's a seductive spirit
[1:38:23] amen I've been listening to the message
[1:38:26] presuming and the prophet God talks
[1:38:28] about people and they're following
[1:38:30] people because they are doing well they
[1:38:31] have great signs and wonders they have
[1:38:33] gifts they have Ministries that that
[1:38:35] that are exceptional in so many ways
[1:38:38] but he says you've got to you can't
[1:38:40] presume that that's what takes you you
[1:38:42] can't presume that that's right just
[1:38:44] because they have signs and wonders
[1:38:45] following because signs and wonders have
[1:38:46] followed all sorts of people through the
[1:38:47] through the scriptures right but will
[1:38:50] they preach the word of God because if
[1:38:52] they're an error on one portion of the
[1:38:53] word of God then you can guarantee
[1:38:54] they're going to be an error in other
[1:38:56] areas and you'll get off by that little
[1:38:58] degree remember and so if your gun is
[1:39:00] off by a little bit well at 50 50 yards
[1:39:03] it's not going to be off by much but if
[1:39:04] you're at a thousand yards you're going
[1:39:05] to be off by what 5 10 feet the goal is
[1:39:08] to stay in line all the way through
[1:39:10] right so you can have somebody that
[1:39:12] preaches like a church a house on fire
[1:39:14] church on fire is probably more like it
[1:39:15] a man that has signs and wonders that
[1:39:17] that has Gifts of visions and all these
[1:39:19] different things listen it's without
[1:39:21] repentance of scripture says right
[1:39:23] they're people that have gifts and it
[1:39:24] doesn't mean anything just means they
[1:39:26] have a gift we don't follow after that
[1:39:28] we follow after the word and as long as
[1:39:29] they preach the word then we follow that
[1:39:31] right because then we're not following
[1:39:33] the man we're not following the ministry
[1:39:34] we're following the word as long as they
[1:39:36] stick with it amen but the prophet of
[1:39:38] God would point to the scripture and he
[1:39:40] he'd say you know people will say well
[1:39:42] that we don't need ministers anymore
[1:39:45] because we have the spirit of truth
[1:39:46] that's gonna you know Jesus said it'll
[1:39:48] lead you into all things and then John
[1:39:49] comes and says that you know all things
[1:39:50] because the spirit teaches you he even
[1:39:52] says you have need not that a man teach
[1:39:54] you
[1:39:55] now there's a paradox there you would
[1:39:57] think but brother Brown will point us
[1:39:59] back to the book of Ephesians and the
[1:40:00] five full ministry and he'd say oh
[1:40:02] please church have faith just a little
[1:40:04] while see you must come under teaching
[1:40:06] you say I don't need no one to teach me
[1:40:09] after the Holy Ghost has come my friends
[1:40:11] that just gives me a little room to
[1:40:12] doubt whether you really got it or not
[1:40:14] then see the way you're acting with it
[1:40:16] see the thing you're doing now why if
[1:40:18] the Bible says the holy spirit is the
[1:40:20] teacher then why did the Holy Spirit put
[1:40:23] teachers in the church then to set the
[1:40:25] church in order the same Holy Spirit he
[1:40:27] says the same Holy Spirit can't say you
[1:40:29] don't need teachers and then put them
[1:40:30] inside the church
[1:40:31] he says sure we don't need any
[1:40:33] seminaries to go around a big bunch of
[1:40:35] men to look out those things the holy
[1:40:38] spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher
[1:40:40] and it gives some fellow a gift of
[1:40:42] teaching and then you must be subject to
[1:40:45] that gift
[1:40:47] there are literally churches that teach
[1:40:49] they're not in the message as far as I
[1:40:51] know because it wouldn't make sense you
[1:40:52] can't be
[1:40:52] teaching it if you're not behind the
[1:40:54] pulpit but that they don't need
[1:40:56] ministers
[1:40:58] I got the Holy Ghost and so I just
[1:40:59] walked through life I don't have to even
[1:41:00] go to church I don't have to do anything
[1:41:02] I can just trust the Holy Spirit to me
[1:41:04] and he's going to lead and guide me into
[1:41:05] all truth and I know all things but
[1:41:07] about says no no you can't do that
[1:41:08] there's a five-fold ministry that's
[1:41:10] given for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:41:11] it is the god-ordained way for us to get
[1:41:14] across the finish line
[1:41:15] right doesn't take the place of personal
[1:41:17] devotions doesn't play take the place of
[1:41:19] your relationship with God but it's
[1:41:20] there for effect amen and if we don't
[1:41:22] sit under it then we lose that effect
[1:41:24] amen and who taught us that Paul
[1:41:27] did Paul teach us that we all say yeah
[1:41:29] he taught us that in Ephesians no Paul
[1:41:31] didn't teach us the Holy Spirit took him
[1:41:33] out on the back side of the desert told
[1:41:35] him what to say and then he came back
[1:41:36] and told us we're not following Paul
[1:41:38] we're following the holy spirit that
[1:41:39] told Paul what to say in the first place
[1:41:40] amen
[1:41:41] and he said what follow me as I follow
[1:41:43] Christ
[1:41:44] right so we're not following a man we're
[1:41:46] following the the god that's behind the
[1:41:47] man
[1:41:48] amen the war didn't come from Paul Paul
[1:41:51] challenged him he said did the work come
[1:41:52] from you or did it come to you
[1:41:55] and it's when the when we're saying it
[1:41:56] came from us rather than to us that we
[1:41:58] get into problems as ministers amen it
[1:42:00] comes to us and we just pass it on and
[1:42:02] we point the people to the one that gave
[1:42:03] us the message in the first place
[1:42:05] amen
[1:42:07] we're talking about the abundance inside
[1:42:09] of you
[1:42:10] so if you're struggling to give the
[1:42:12] right thing then what does it tell you
[1:42:14] there's a lack of an abundance of the
[1:42:15] right thing inside of you that doesn't
[1:42:17] mean you're wrong inside it just means
[1:42:19] there's not an abundance of what you
[1:42:21] need inside of you and we talked to you
[1:42:23] know about the blueberry service I think
[1:42:25] is what we're going to call it from now
[1:42:26] on where we talked about the fruits of
[1:42:27] the spirit love joy peace patience
[1:42:28] kindness goodness Faith gentleness make
[1:42:30] this self-control these different things
[1:42:32] and we talked about how that fruit is
[1:42:34] given for other people to eat
[1:42:36] it's given for you to display but for
[1:42:38] them to eat and then so often we get mad
[1:42:40] because somebody that we think ought not
[1:42:41] to take that fruit takes the fruit but
[1:42:44] the purpose of a tree is to be fruit
[1:42:45] bearing not to determine who eats the
[1:42:46] fruit amen
[1:42:48] and so if you're struggling to act the
[1:42:50] right way
[1:42:51] to represent Christ to project Christ to
[1:42:53] people then what does it tell you there
[1:42:55] is a lack of an abundance inside of you
[1:42:57] and we all get it
[1:42:59] we all get it
[1:43:00] man it's no reason to pretend we don't
[1:43:02] amen if you're giving a lot of something
[1:43:05] you want to have a lot of something
[1:43:07] inside of you and the the more you're
[1:43:09] required to give the more you're going
[1:43:11] to be required to be next to a source
[1:43:13] that can fill you up quickly
[1:43:14] right
[1:43:16] you know maybe young people certainly
[1:43:18] the the young kids you know in
[1:43:19] elementary school and whatnot they're
[1:43:20] not called to give a lot they're takers
[1:43:22] not givers
[1:43:23] so they don't need the same thing but if
[1:43:25] you're a parent
[1:43:26] if you're a parent you got to be
[1:43:27] constantly tied to the source because
[1:43:30] your physical energy your mental energy
[1:43:32] your emotional energy your financial
[1:43:33] everything is going to be tapped out all
[1:43:36] the time if you don't have a source of
[1:43:37] abundance to keep that up inside of you
[1:43:39] right and that's our responsibility it's
[1:43:42] our responsibility to to be diligent to
[1:43:44] make sure that we're taking the time to
[1:43:46] get those things filled up
[1:43:48] amen we don't blame others in those
[1:43:50] situations when somebody causes me to
[1:43:52] lose my temper it's not their fault it's
[1:43:54] my fault
[1:43:56] yeah right it's my fault because I
[1:43:58] didn't have enough of the fruit of the
[1:44:00] Holy Spirit to get me over that hump
[1:44:02] right and my family knows it
[1:44:04] right when I fall it's not because
[1:44:06] they're bad it's because I I need to
[1:44:08] topping up in an area right
[1:44:11] so often what we're finding is what an
[1:44:13] abundance of everything but Christ
[1:44:15] because that's what the world's pressing
[1:44:16] in on us right that's the battle is
[1:44:18] they're trying to press in an abundance
[1:44:20] of everything it's insane I've shared a
[1:44:22] couple things with a few Brothers this
[1:44:23] week and talk about abundance hey
[1:44:26] brother Joe
[1:44:28] it's insane it's absolutely insane and
[1:44:31] we're just touching the tops of things
[1:44:33] we're not even getting down into the
[1:44:35] nitty-gritty and the the real influences
[1:44:37] Behind these things and you look at it
[1:44:39] and you say it's absolutely insane and
[1:44:40] it's pressing in everywhere
[1:44:42] it's it's in the schools it's in
[1:44:44] politics it's in the economy it's in the
[1:44:46] natural world it's in the environment
[1:44:47] everything is just pushing in on us
[1:44:50] and the thing is we're supposed to be a
[1:44:52] fountain of abundance
[1:44:53] and what we've got is we've got a plug
[1:44:55] coming down from the world that's trying
[1:44:57] to stop that up so they can inject
[1:44:59] something else inside of us amen
[1:45:02] what we're fighting our own hurts and
[1:45:03] frustrations and fears and complexes and
[1:45:06] shortcomings
[1:45:07] and the only way to get past that is get
[1:45:08] an abundance of the one that can fix all
[1:45:10] of those things that can take us past it
[1:45:12] amen there's nothing wrong with being
[1:45:14] hurt there's nothing wrong being
[1:45:15] offended as long as we don't stay there
[1:45:17] all right we got to move past it we got
[1:45:19] to get over those things what is it how
[1:45:21] do you get past it you get an abundance
[1:45:22] of something that will overflow it that
[1:45:25] will conquer it amen the Conquering the
[1:45:27] first conquering we have is not each
[1:45:28] other it's ourselves
[1:45:30] and then the only concrete I'm supposed
[1:45:32] to have over you and anybody else in
[1:45:34] this church or in the world is love
[1:45:36] the love of Christ which is not the way
[1:45:37] they might want it but love is the
[1:45:39] greatest conquering factor that we have
[1:45:41] in our life but the first thing I've got
[1:45:42] to conquer is myself and so if I'm
[1:45:44] looking and I'm saying you're the
[1:45:45] problem not me then what's it what is it
[1:45:47] I gotta look inside I got to be honest
[1:45:49] right I got to get closer to God Amen
[1:45:52] you got to get past what others are and
[1:45:54] seek God to change you
[1:45:56] sometimes we got to fix our glasses we
[1:45:57] got to fix our lens that we're looking
[1:45:58] through and that's a change that has to
[1:46:00] happen here amen like I said before I'm
[1:46:02] the only one who has control
[1:46:03] that that has control over me can't
[1:46:06] control vaishal can't control sister
[1:46:08] Delfina and anybody else in between
[1:46:10] Kenner I got to change what's here I got
[1:46:12] to change what's here amen and I'll
[1:46:14] speak for you know we're tired we get
[1:46:17] tired a lot don't we
[1:46:19] listen we're gonna be as tired and as
[1:46:21] busy as we allow ourselves to be
[1:46:23] tiredness you can't help but busyness we
[1:46:25] can absolutely do it listen I got an
[1:46:27] iPhone in there every Sunday morning and
[1:46:28] I get a notification of how much time I
[1:46:30] average on my phone for the week
[1:46:33] and I can go in and I can look at every
[1:46:34] single app that I do
[1:46:36] and I can see what I spent the most time
[1:46:38] on when I spent that time on it
[1:46:40] so I can look into my life and I can see
[1:46:43] that I average whatever that was and I
[1:46:45] can see where I'm spending my time
[1:46:47] and now I can look at that and say was
[1:46:48] that time well spent or was that time
[1:46:50] wasted
[1:46:52] how do I know what was the abundance
[1:46:54] that came out of me this week
[1:46:55] right
[1:46:56] because here's the thing we have plenty
[1:46:58] of time for God when things are not
[1:46:59] going their way
[1:47:01] when we're in pain when we're we're
[1:47:02] struggling with health when we're
[1:47:04] struggling with relationships when we
[1:47:05] have no money when things are just
[1:47:07] difficult and new whatever it might be
[1:47:09] we got plenty of time for God but as
[1:47:11] soon as that's gone then what happens is
[1:47:12] we go back to what an abundance of
[1:47:14] something else
[1:47:15] the thing is will we stay with the
[1:47:17] abundance so that when the next Crisis
[1:47:19] comes up we're ready for it and we got
[1:47:21] something to push it away to push us
[1:47:23] through it to take us all the way
[1:47:24] through it amen
[1:47:27] Hallelujah you give time to God he's
[1:47:29] going to honor it every time amen amen
[1:47:30] because how do we how do things multiply
[1:47:32] in a believer's life do we multiply it
[1:47:35] are we the great multipliers
[1:47:38] no
[1:47:39] he says give to me this is God he says
[1:47:43] and I'll give back to you press down
[1:47:45] shaken together and flowing out
[1:47:49] so you give him one hour of your time
[1:47:51] and watch what he does to the rest of
[1:47:52] your life
[1:47:53] you give him you take some of that time
[1:47:56] that you've been spending on those
[1:47:57] wasteful things and you give it to him
[1:47:58] and God will never leave you high and
[1:48:00] dry he'll take it and he'll multiply it
[1:48:02] and he'll turn it into something greater
[1:48:04] than what you're going to get in the
[1:48:05] first place amen he never leaves his
[1:48:07] promise unfulfilled right he always
[1:48:10] gives you more than you give him
[1:48:12] it's funny because you remember the
[1:48:14] scripture they he says you've robbed me
[1:48:16] and they say how he says in tithes and
[1:48:18] offerings
[1:48:19] now I'm not talking about ties and
[1:48:20] offerings but my mom always used to put
[1:48:22] it this way she said I give God a tenth
[1:48:23] of my time
[1:48:25] I thought that was a pretty good way to
[1:48:26] go at it and then anything above and
[1:48:28] beyond that would be an offering but you
[1:48:30] gave God a tenth of your waking hours
[1:48:32] and that's going to do you some good
[1:48:34] right that'll get you to where you need
[1:48:36] to go
[1:48:37] now you can go way further and we're
[1:48:38] going to touch on it a little bit amen
[1:48:40] but
[1:48:42] will be as busy
[1:48:44] as we want to be
[1:48:46] and you'll find out that things drop
[1:48:47] away pretty quick when you decide that
[1:48:50] something else is more important
[1:48:53] this is in the message presuming
[1:48:55] she says let me tell you brother
[1:48:57] no wonder the spirit of God has departed
[1:48:59] from the thing
[1:49:01] no wonder we're back just as cold as the
[1:49:03] Methodist or Baptists we've got to come
[1:49:05] out of this brother or sister or God
[1:49:07] will consume us that's exactly right
[1:49:09] we've got to come back to the power of
[1:49:11] God to Old prayer meetings and shakings
[1:49:14] of the Holy Ghost until men and women
[1:49:17] live holy and sanctified
[1:49:20] yes sir get the world and all the
[1:49:22] Hollywood and dressing stuff out of the
[1:49:24] thing my that's right brother yes oh how
[1:49:26] sin is so deceitful how easily it creeps
[1:49:29] in like that and takes the thing just
[1:49:32] grabs onto you and holds you and goes
[1:49:35] away with it he's saying what takes away
[1:49:37] your Holiness your consecration your
[1:49:40] commitment your sanctification Creeps in
[1:49:42] doesn't jump in with a why I'm gonna
[1:49:45] take it oh it slides in doesn't it
[1:49:47] seductive
[1:49:49] right slow and easy
[1:49:52] seducers don't just step in and go like
[1:49:54] that
[1:49:55] it's the long game
[1:49:57] right bit by bit to break down your
[1:49:59] barriers until they get what they want
[1:50:01] he says that's what's happening in the
[1:50:03] church is you've got these things that
[1:50:04] are sliding in and next thing you know
[1:50:06] they take it and grab it
[1:50:08] and you've lost it not lost it forever
[1:50:10] but you've lost it for the moment
[1:50:12] he says now we look back and see the
[1:50:14] Pentecostal church at the beginning we
[1:50:16] think about the Pentecostals 30 40 years
[1:50:18] ago we think about the Pentecostals post
[1:50:20] Nicene Council we think about them early
[1:50:22] in the early ages are iranius and Saint
[1:50:24] Martin Columbus
[1:50:26] and we feel that seeing them that we've
[1:50:29] got the same blessing they had so we
[1:50:31] pursue we can perceive that we can just
[1:50:33] go right on like they do
[1:50:35] we perceive that we can do the same
[1:50:37] things that they did but we can't do it
[1:50:39] under these circumstances under these
[1:50:41] conditions that the church is in now
[1:50:45] he says look what those men did look
[1:50:47] what those churches did what a sacrifice
[1:50:51] it was
[1:50:54] what they had to give up
[1:50:57] how they counted their lives not even
[1:50:59] nothing to them they stayed on their
[1:51:01] face day and night praying to the Lord I
[1:51:04] talked about a tenth of your time he
[1:51:06] says you want to get where they are it's
[1:51:08] going to take
[1:51:09] coming up a little higher
[1:51:13] they stayed on their face day and night
[1:51:15] praying to the Lord they went everywhere
[1:51:16] they could in search for every crack and
[1:51:19] Corner they could get to testifying of
[1:51:21] the kingdom of God to the people
[1:51:23] listen to this he says and today we just
[1:51:25] expect the pastor to bring it in his
[1:51:28] briefcase or the Evangelist and say
[1:51:31] bless God I belong to the church that's
[1:51:33] it see I'm a member there I believe in
[1:51:35] this church this church is all right
[1:51:36] sure building might be all re right
[1:51:39] might be nothing wrong no termites or
[1:51:41] nothing in it he says we're expecting
[1:51:43] the ministry
[1:51:44] to bring everything that we need
[1:51:47] and that'll be it to satisfy us for the
[1:51:49] week
[1:51:50] that we look to the men behind the
[1:51:52] pulpit and say we'll take what they got
[1:51:54] and that's good enough it's not never
[1:51:57] has been
[1:51:58] you've got to move on in your
[1:51:59] relationship with Christ I can't give
[1:52:02] you an unction because I'm not the Holy
[1:52:04] One
[1:52:04] the holy spirit is the Holy One that's
[1:52:07] why I have I don't think I have any fear
[1:52:09] of drawing people to me but that's why I
[1:52:11] would never want it is because I can't
[1:52:13] give you an unction I can't give you the
[1:52:15] will of God I've had circumstances
[1:52:17] recently in the church where people were
[1:52:18] talking to me about situations and my
[1:52:20] prayer was not Lord tell me what to tell
[1:52:22] them
[1:52:23] my prayer was Lord tell them what they
[1:52:25] need because they need the unction the
[1:52:27] unction is for them because it's their
[1:52:28] life it's their situation it's their
[1:52:31] drama whatever it might be they need the
[1:52:33] unction so Lord I'm praying that you'll
[1:52:34] go to them and speak to them
[1:52:36] show them what to do show them how to
[1:52:38] handle things show them how to speak
[1:52:39] help them to be quiet when they need to
[1:52:41] be quiet
[1:52:43] why because you need the unction for you
[1:52:45] and I need the unction for me
[1:52:49] he says the building might be wrong no
[1:52:50] termites or anything he says but what
[1:52:53] about the building the other building
[1:52:56] what kind of termites has it got in it
[1:52:58] that's the things that might cause us
[1:53:00] trouble the termites that'll eat into
[1:53:02] the soul oh how we need to check up
[1:53:05] instead of presuming that we're all
[1:53:07] right
[1:53:08] that's a sober thing
[1:53:11] this is 62. seals haven't been open yet
[1:53:13] but there's a calling there's a calling
[1:53:16] out
[1:53:17] come out of her my people and then he's
[1:53:18] saying you need to open up
[1:53:20] because you've been stuck in something
[1:53:21] that's that's saturated with termites
[1:53:24] and you've got to let the one come in
[1:53:25] that'll exterminate those things and get
[1:53:27] the building set of right amen amen
[1:53:29] there's a seriousness that comes when we
[1:53:31] realize how late it is
[1:53:33] and you say Lord I need more than I got
[1:53:35] now
[1:53:36] I need more than I got now that's for
[1:53:38] sure Lord will you give me that
[1:53:41] will you do a check on my life and get
[1:53:43] rid of the termites that are in there
[1:53:44] what do termites do termites don't take
[1:53:47] you out just like a hurricane do they
[1:53:49] they go in and they worm their way into
[1:53:51] the materials until it's full of holes
[1:53:53] and it loses its structural integrity
[1:53:55] and then in one day it crumbles
[1:53:58] but the work is done over tens or dozens
[1:54:00] maybe 20 odd years they go in and they
[1:54:02] just eat it from the inside out and you
[1:54:04] can't see it all you see is the little
[1:54:06] hole where they went in and then they go
[1:54:07] in they eat out all of the inside
[1:54:10] I want to cross with close with the
[1:54:12] scripture because it puts into
[1:54:13] perspective what we're talking about
[1:54:15] this voice of abundance and I'm going to
[1:54:17] take you when John and remember he says
[1:54:18] you know as the scripture says you know
[1:54:20] I believe therefore have I spoken and we
[1:54:23] believe and therefore speak he was
[1:54:24] referring to Psalms 116 and I'm going to
[1:54:26] read it as we close here
[1:54:28] this is David and he says I love the
[1:54:30] Lord because he hath heard my prayer and
[1:54:33] my supplications
[1:54:35] what's the abundance coming out of
[1:54:37] David's mouth here
[1:54:40] God answers prayer
[1:54:43] when I go to him he answers
[1:54:46] amen
[1:54:49] the abundance is not that there is no
[1:54:51] reason to go to God but that when you go
[1:54:53] he provides what you have need of
[1:54:56] because he hath inclined his ear unto me
[1:54:58] therefore will I call upon him as long
[1:55:00] as I live what's the abundance here
[1:55:03] David has an experience of knowing that
[1:55:05] God listens to him
[1:55:07] the Sorrows of death come past me and
[1:55:10] the Pains of Hell got hold of me I found
[1:55:13] trouble in sorrow
[1:55:14] now that doesn't sound like an abundance
[1:55:16] I want
[1:55:18] I was telling my wife earlier this week
[1:55:21] in my devotions I read
[1:55:24] the Psalms or Proverbs and then I go
[1:55:26] into two different books of the of the
[1:55:28] New Testament usually and but but in
[1:55:30] reading the book of Psalms I said I'm
[1:55:31] getting a bit frustrated with David
[1:55:33] because he's always down in the dumps
[1:55:35] woe is me woe is me but then I stopped
[1:55:38] and I thought about it David got his
[1:55:40] unction
[1:55:41] he got anointed and then he spent 15
[1:55:44] years running for his life
[1:55:46] and I get a little upset after a week
[1:55:50] you know things aren't going the way I
[1:55:52] want after a week I'm kind of like what
[1:55:53] was me David went through 15 years and
[1:55:55] still had as many highs as he had lows
[1:55:57] if you look at the sums you know for
[1:55:59] every bad one there's a good one
[1:56:00] you know he always came back around but
[1:56:02] he had some really down moments in his
[1:56:04] life where everybody was against him and
[1:56:07] sometimes he didn't always respond or do
[1:56:09] the right thing did he
[1:56:11] he says the Sorrows of death have
[1:56:12] compassed me they've surrounded me the
[1:56:15] Pains of Hell have grabbed hold of me
[1:56:17] the abundance that we have does not
[1:56:19] limit us from feeling pain from feeling
[1:56:22] sorrow from being hurt
[1:56:24] from facing difficulties in life
[1:56:26] but if that's all we're dwelling on then
[1:56:28] that's what's going to come out isn't it
[1:56:30] but what does David say he says then
[1:56:33] after all that happened then called I
[1:56:36] upon the name of the Lord oh Lord I
[1:56:38] beseech thee to deliver my soul
[1:56:40] gracious is the Lord and righteous yea
[1:56:45] our God is merciful
[1:56:47] so when it got difficult he reached out
[1:56:49] and he says the abundance that's out of
[1:56:51] coming out of me now is that the Lord is
[1:56:53] gracious and he is righteous and he is
[1:56:56] merciful
[1:56:57] don't focus on the down focus on the
[1:57:01] righteous and gracious and merciful god
[1:57:03] that's going to pull you out of it amen
[1:57:06] the Lord preserveth the simple
[1:57:09] you know what we're called Simple a lot
[1:57:11] you know why because we say the word
[1:57:13] says it we believe it I'm going to act
[1:57:14] on it
[1:57:15] and it's so simple for us and other
[1:57:18] people they'll bring in Emotion they'll
[1:57:19] bring in Social license they'll they'll
[1:57:21] bring in the way things are going and no
[1:57:23] no and we just say no what does the word
[1:57:25] say and we're simple that way
[1:57:27] but that's the way we're supposed to be
[1:57:29] that's how you live a simple humble
[1:57:32] Victorious Christian Life you say with
[1:57:34] what the word says
[1:57:36] the Lord preserves a simple I was
[1:57:39] brought low he says and he helped me
[1:57:42] what's the abundance here
[1:57:44] your current experience is not a
[1:57:46] reflection of your heritage in Christ
[1:57:48] we're simple here we're Kings and
[1:57:50] Priests in reality amen amen right we're
[1:57:52] simple down here but we rule and reign
[1:57:53] with him
[1:57:54] right we are the Spotless sinless bride
[1:57:57] of Christ
[1:57:58] though simple we are the Spotless symbol
[1:58:00] simple bride of Christ amen he says
[1:58:03] return unto thy rest O my soul for the
[1:58:06] Lord had thou Bountiful down bountifully
[1:58:08] with thee what's the abundance here
[1:58:11] there's a place of renewal
[1:58:13] there's a place where you can go back
[1:58:16] that's what Redemption is taking you
[1:58:19] back
[1:58:20] and guess what we get places of renewal
[1:58:22] all through our life don't we
[1:58:24] where God just comes in and he steps in
[1:58:26] and he does the work and he brings you
[1:58:28] out of the dull drums and he brings you
[1:58:30] into a place of Deliverance and joy and
[1:58:31] peace in these different things there is
[1:58:33] a place of renewal he says return to thy
[1:58:35] rest O soul for the Lord had bound to
[1:58:38] flee with thee return to rest return to
[1:58:41] peace if you've ever had it you'll want
[1:58:42] it
[1:58:43] and if you've never had it you'll want
[1:58:45] to seek it he says for thou has
[1:58:47] delivered my soul from death
[1:58:49] and mine eyes from tears
[1:58:52] and my feet from falling
[1:58:55] what's the abundance here
[1:58:56] doesn't say he wasn't falling
[1:58:59] means it never took any hold of him it
[1:59:01] never had an effect on him didn't cause
[1:59:03] him to break his leg
[1:59:05] what is it God makes all things good god
[1:59:07] holds up God protects us and God eases
[1:59:10] our sorrows and our pains he said I will
[1:59:12] walk before the Lord in the land of the
[1:59:15] living I believed therefore have I
[1:59:18] spoken let's stand together if we would
[1:59:21] what was David speaking about here
[1:59:23] he says I believed what
[1:59:25] I believe in the grace of God I believe
[1:59:27] in the mercy of God I believe in the
[1:59:29] righteousness of God I believe in the
[1:59:31] strong right hand of God I believe in
[1:59:33] the rest and the peace of God he says
[1:59:35] and I have believed that and therefore
[1:59:38] have I spoken
[1:59:40] he talked a lot about the difficulties
[1:59:41] he was going through
[1:59:43] but like I said in the end he always
[1:59:44] came back to that place where he
[1:59:46] recognized the reality of God he
[1:59:47] recognized the hand of God he recognized
[1:59:49] the protection of God he recognized that
[1:59:51] nothing would stop the plan of God
[1:59:54] he recognized that he has called me and
[1:59:56] therefore he's going to take me across
[1:59:58] the finish line
[1:59:59] right my current situation is no
[2:00:02] reflection of my Heritage in Christ
[2:00:04] that there's a purpose and there's a
[2:00:06] place for all of these things and you
[2:00:08] may have to go through things I don't
[2:00:09] have to and I guarantee I'm going to go
[2:00:11] through things you don't have to amen
[2:00:13] but if we will confess with our mouths
[2:00:15] because we believe he is what he is and
[2:00:18] what he says he is he says I'm going to
[2:00:20] take you through and it's a lot easier
[2:00:22] to go through life if you'll confess the
[2:00:24] good things than the bad things
[2:00:25] because confessing the bad things gives
[2:00:27] you nothing
[2:00:28] there's no benefit of of talking about
[2:00:30] how bad things are how difficult things
[2:00:32] are amen but there is a benefit to
[2:00:34] talking about the things that he's
[2:00:35] promised us amen because he's going to
[2:00:37] do it he's going to do it though he
[2:00:39] tarries says Terry and wait because he's
[2:00:41] not going to tarry forever
[2:00:43] and God bless you let's just bow our
[2:00:45] heads together yeah
[2:00:47] Heavenly Father

[2:01:01] that we can't hide it that Lord even if
[2:01:03] we would for some reason want to hide it
[2:01:05] Lord let the yet the Life of Christ
[2:01:07] would just flow out through US Lord
[2:01:09] and Lord we've got to bring this minded
[2:01:11] subjection

[2:01:30] word to be on our lips Lord even as it
[2:01:32] flows out of our soul lord that we would
