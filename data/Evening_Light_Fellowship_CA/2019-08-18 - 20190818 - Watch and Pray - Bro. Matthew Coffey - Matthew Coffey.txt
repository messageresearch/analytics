your father pull on you father we thank you for your grace may just take anything to stands between us Lord I remove it Lord Jesus Christ's name I pray amen amen if we could take our Bibles and just turn to Matthew 26 I just wanted to thank especially a better mark for the song service even though Bear Bob isn't here he's definitely is a good backup and him for being sensitive leading is a wonderful service a song server sorry so hey man so we can just Matthew 26 and verse 41 he says watch and pray that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak and man god bless is reading you can be seated while you still got your Bibles if you turn over to mark 13 and we'll start with verse 32 down to 37 but of that day in that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father take heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch he therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh and even or at midnight or at the cock-crowing or in the morning lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping and while I say unto you I say unto all watch so if you feel to take a little topic here on watch and pray the Scriptures especially in the Old Testament tends to refer to more as a watchman so first let's just find out what watch really means in Webster's dictionary it defines the word watches the act of watching the forbearance of sleep a vigil to be wakeful vigilant or constantly observant attention close observation to be on guard preventive or preservative vigilance formerly are watching or guarding by night so if we go back to the Old Testament the watch was considered to be during the night it was a four hour span and you switch out your guard for hours switch out your guard just so that they would stay observant and they wouldn't fall asleep so the prime example of this one here if you want turn to Nehemiah four and just to set a bit of a background there's Nehemiah he and the Jews have been in captive in captivity and Nehemiah he went before the king and he said to King Awad I'd like to go back to Jerusalem and rebuild it this is the the place of my people and so we got permission to go and while they were building this but they got word that there was people that were going wanting to stop them they had settled in the land and they considered they were squatters and they didn't like the idea of people reclaiming what was theirs so Nehemiah for person seven he said it came to pass that one Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the ammonites and the ash tonight's heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very wroth and conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem until hindereth but nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God and he said a watch against them day and night because of them and Judah said the strength of the Bears of the burden is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build a wall so here because they're so busy guarding they couldn't continue the work on the city so they're being hindered in a way looking out for these enemies so then our adversary said they shall not know neither see till we come and amidst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease and it came to pass that when the Jews which dwelt by them came and they said unto us 10 times from all places when shall you return unto us they will be upon you therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places I even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bowls so they're really arming up here to keep her this enemy away from their work and I looked and rose up and said to the nobles and rulers and to the rest of the people be not afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and God had brought their counsel to naught then we returned all of us to the wall every one until his work they didn't even have the fight all they had to do was stand they had to get their weapons and stand on the watch and that's all it took to defeat the enemy in this instance God moved in and they realized there was a one-year force there than what they reckoned reckoned with and 16 says and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants brought in the work and the other half held both the spears the shields the bowls and the heart and the Hobart Ian's now I looked up that word and that word is an old English word which means breastplate so you take that back to the armor the breastplate of righteousness so they have their sword which we know is the word and they're already girded with the breastplate and they have their shields so now half a mile walking after their brothers as they're working so now they're starting to work in unison here and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah everyone is coming together here they which build it on the wall and data bear burdens with those that they did every one of them had his hand brought in to work and was the other hand held a weapon for the builders everyone had his sword guarded by his side and so build it and he the sound of the trumpet was by me so now even in this instance they weren't hiding their swords or laying their swords aside they girded on their side did war even though it might have been in their way the warder sword they kept their word with them day in day out and it continued in their daily work they didn't just wear it occasionally for special occasions they took it with him to work we're not brothers or if even if sisters drawn today you take the word with you don't heart is behind something keep it out in plain sight and this is what helps keep the enemy back away from you we're not to keep it hidden in the market Abby's butter brown says you call it fanaticism well that's true I'll admit they got a lot of it but buzzer there's a real one there too that's right a real one there the devil throws every counterfeit he can right in the way to confuse you but if you don't think no more of God then get down read your Bible and pray and ask God then it goes to show you're not very interested in your soul move right on out there and say God I don't care how many old crow baits you would put out there I see your Bible says it and I'm determined that's right you promised it to me the seed of Abraham so that's what the watch is in the Old Testament but what is prayer I'm saying this now cuz we got some younger people here maybe this is for them most of basic definition I could think of prayer is talking to God it is not a as the world puts like as a meditation like a lot of people go to yoga or things that new should go to meditate there's the monks of Shaolin monks and all that they meditate when I talk about this type of meditation or state of mind or passive reflection like this is God Watauga he created us it's a direct address to God but it's not a one-way address it's also him talking back prayer is our primary way of communicating with God and in I'll just read this real quick to Barona her back up to one he said I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved there's a couple things about this one is first off let's go would reproved his kind of sounds of a harsh harsh word but it means to scold or correct usually gently or with kindly intent isn't that our God he kind of the master mold us into the His image we might think that is harsh but according to Scripture he's usually gently or to bring us in line with his perfect world we thank the Lord for that so it says here I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower if you check in Matthew Henry he refers this is he got in prayer so he in the first chapter if you understand this it said a bit of background in the time of Habakkuk the Chaldeans were really oppressing them they were taken over the country and there was no justice even in the first chapter Rachel was in torment he says therefore the laws slacked and judgment does never go forth for the wicked death can pass about the righteous therefore wrong judgment proceedeth so he's intent today judgment is not what it used to be used to be based on the scripture and morals that is all gone so he was burdened for the condition of the age there's a lot of violence and lack of godly justice but he also here he's signed and crime which takes us back to Ezekiel and God said mark those that sigh and cry so we want to thank God for for this leadership here get this backed off of it but Habakkuk was also very much aware of the hour he lived in he was looking at the signs that were present now he didn't necessarily make a doctrine office but he was aware of what was going on a lot of people today will also get caught up with the Pope Israel Russia we take note of these things and we thank God for them even the prophesied Israel's his timepiece but we don't make make it our sole purpose in watching we're supposed to watch dig into the word yes between the scriptures and in the revealed word this is what we watch this is will be truly find out where we are where we stand with God in catching and getting caught up with the era we live in we can get caught up with a lot of the attitudes of the world and get caught up in bitterness and resentment and what these things creeping it cuts off our communion with God and then you lose that comfort that joy and that assurance did I walk with God and you get caught up and then you have to go God has to correct you to drive these things out so you can come back in communion with him to have that comfort of communion with him every day it is a joy and a pleasure there are many things that are each and every one here can attest to that God has walked with them and they feel that absence when he draws away so when there he's talked about when he talks about here I will see what he will say unto me basic he he's prayed and if you read his prayer in Habakkuk 1 really he's complaining he sees all this stuff and he's just complaining the God God I'm seeing this like what time to go here but he been - he said he's just praying so now I'll wait and see what God says back to me he said and if he corrects me I'm gonna wait for that - he had a wonderful attitude there so he was paying attention to the word that he had for his day and he was still waiting for that still small voice and as a scripture says he sat upon his watch which means he fixed his thoughts on God he turned all of his attention on God he put it aside two things of world because he went off into the watchtower so he wasn't down in the city he was set aside the scripture talks about your prayer Plaza as your watchtower this is go and watch don't get satisfied your time study the Scriptures in the several places even in sobs David says he said I will bring the remembrance to songs that I saw he's looking back as past experiences and trying to find a word like it off he was searching trying to find out work where have I gone wrong why I've got why is God step back from me and as you know David had a lot of experiences to draw but we can't discredit our own experiences God has given me experiences that you guys might not go through and vice versa there's things that bother ayer keroh I believe his name is he's gone through that I won't have to face but that stuff God gives us to draw on when we have needeth but you also you also consult our experiences but there's also those that have gone before us that are among us older brothers that have got experiences brother Chad when you went to the emergency with his high blood pressure the experienced brother mark went with onlin stayed with them that's what it's about there's an experience natural types of spirit spiritual there's also brothers and sisters elders here that can direct us and help us in our time of need and as but what product last week about the shield the shield of faith in Roman formations is they held their shield over themselves or she loved faith but also those over in front of them this is not just for ourselves this is for our brothers and sisters right we're in this together if we think that we can get to heaven by ourselves or were deceived and the devil would like to keep us in that position to think that we got it all figured out a solider by himself don't know where to put that shield I'll put it in front to right left up down they don't have a clue but with the group they can fully cover themselves they can hold their shields over their daughter and their sister also another thing about the matthew henry says here about de scripture he says what perha ba-cock is basically saying he said I will look up I will look around to the left and right and down and I will look with him and watch and see what he will say unto me and we'll listen attentively to the words of his mouth and carefully observe the steps of his Providence so as a watchman the idea you would guess he would look forward to believe as high as part of a city and you would look forward to see if anything comin but there's also because there are walls they might come from the left or the right so we have to pay attention to our right hand to our left hand but they had looked down these are all pretty self-explanatory but one I thought was interesting when he said he said look within a lot of stuff in the Old Testament is tapped and take naturally so to look was thena attacked from within we're in Scripture and was there attacks from within the city there were two cities one was Babylon and that was June I do believe Nebuchadnezzar or Darius I forget the name sorry where they were besieged by the enemy and what the enemy did is behind the hills they cut off the water source while they were partying and they marched under the wall and attacked it from the thing that there was a failure of the watchman's notice that that's a pretty big change on sunland River stops there's a big warning book but they weren't attentive there are more paying attention to the party going on inside and they weren't doing their due diligence and standing on their watch and as you know Babylon fell greatly the other city died fell from attack with him was Jerusalem Jerusalem was when David attacked us and they had its sieged and don't could get in around but there was a river that went into it and Joab he went into the river he didn't they didn't divert you just smoking by night in the river and up to well and then he opened up the gates again if the watchman had been paying attention he monocot that but it was very subtle dat attack and that's what the devil try to do in the scripture so close have deceived very elect he slipped in with the water source which is a type of the work very small thing slippin and that city fell so he must be very careful and very vigilant in what we feed ourselves with entertainment why are we entertaining ourselves is there a small cedar discrepancy there even some message we might be listened to online is there something that's just a little off to Dell is trying to slip something in you must keep prayed up keep on watching it for ourselves but even as Nehemiah was saying for our wives and for our children for our houses the devil do anything you can to disrupt a church you disrupt your lives could be something small but you must must keep watch also he Matthew he Matt Matt you handle Aikens prayer - shooting shooting arrows but they were to use but I'll bring it forward into this time and users shooting a gun we know but a Bram talks about how the site's got to beyond but when you when you pray on something it's not just out of matter if you shoot and walk away you shoot and you keep looking at your target did you hit the target did you fatally wound it if you didn't readjust shoot again and keep watching until you hit that fatal ball prime example was a few years ago I was out moose hunting I had a moose there's only about 60 70 feet away clear shot I shot it knocked it down blew it off his feet immediately I kept guy went toward it and I lost sight of us when I got to where the Moose was a moose was gone if I had stayed back where I was I would have seen moose got off and been able to deliver another blow I would have got a nice as well I lost it and that's cuz I didn't stay and watch were and wait the time wait to see the result of my shot say it was prayer will you fire wait see what comes back if you don't pray again wait and see what comes back make sure you hit the mark and repeat you stay and observe as he as Habakkuk says to watch and see what happens the thing with also what's Habakkuk is and there goes over to Ezekiel is he was really growing than sign and God really puts us in a place and he will change our our circumstance to cause us to get into a point where we are growing and sign we're getting desperate and a good example of this if you if you want to turn us over to Jonah chapter 2 in Jonah chapter 2 and we'll start with first wall then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly and he said I cried by reason of mine unflinching unto the Lord he was in a pretty bad pickle as they would say he had nowhere else to go and he says by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord God put him in that place and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried I and thou hurts my voice for thou has cast me into the deep into the midst of the Seas and the floods come past me about and all our bills and thy waves passed over me he really got desperate he really learned how to pray down in the belly of the whale that was me are you we get desperate ooh not a very pleasant picture to be catching yourself II see one drop down to verse 7 he said when my soul fainted with him yea I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thy holy temple they did observed lying vanities forsake their own mercy I really like this when your verse 9 he said but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving who knew that Thanksgiving was a sacrifice he said and I will pray fact that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord that there really is really striking he had to save my team because the next verse says and the Lord spake unto the fish and environment amount he had to say I will make a sacrifice of Thanksgiving and I will pay that which I have vowed so he must have had some vows that he hadn't paid scripture is very clear if you vow something to God you better keep it so obviously from this one he hadn't he had some things left undone sometimes he wasn't sure about but God put him in a place where he he knew he had messed up and he'd better get it back on track we also go but if you go back on turn to it but if you also go back to the children of Israel in Egypt when they were in slavery they were also very comfortable in their situation but God changed their circumstance to the point where he could say to Moses I have heard their cries and I am calm down but he he couldn't calm down until he heard their cries it wasn't just one cry he had to hear all their cries he put the whole nation into a place where they all get desperate as a church they got desperate I said Lord we why we we remember our prep the promise you gave Moses we want to go to our promised land then he brought Moses on the scene got him prepared and then he went in and saved him also as butter Paul mentioned her when he was here about Hannah you know she was also God shut up her room she couldn't have a baby so her persecution was because of God but she had come to a point where she could sigh and groan was in her spirit and then she got her answer sometimes if it looks like your brother or sister is going through something well maybe God's putting them in a place where they can pray the right thing it's not a thing just to say a prayer you had to pray right what is it that God wants me to say then he can say all thank and that's right now you can get your answer Jesus in the garden there's also another one he also prayed to the point where he was in such agony as scripture says he was shedding as it were great drops of blood I don't know be you but I've never gone to that level of groaning or anguish of spirit but a must months pretty terrible but for him to say and the repeat his prayer because scripture says and he repeated it not my will but thine be done I prayed a debt you know that's our hearts cry no matter what it is we do even if it seems strange and unusual God's pretty good at the strange and unusual desperate us I think he's a perfectionist when it comes to that and it brings results for the kingdom of God so my prayer is that you're not my book may we be willing vessels there's many times reason when we hold back well God would have a blessing for someone down the road because of that one thing in Ex expectations Irv Bertram's said clergymen could you mark on your hands ten people tonight in this city that's sign and crying day and night for the wickedness and things that's done in the city does anybody in this audience know where you could put your fingers on five people there Sian cried day and night for the sins and things in the city well the Bible well now the Bible said set a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city that's right no more burden for lost souls it's all gone we've joined church and settle down that's all that's necessary that's how we get sin is so sneaky it sneaks right up on you before you know it see that's the way it does it just grabs you like the old toboggan slide you used to be and it's got you the devil does that now brother let's get plumb back off his territory let's get back into God come right back to the altar rebuild the altar that's been torn down build up your home take them carrots off the table and old magazines and open up the Bible read the Bible and pray and just don't get down and say that's my family Mary and Joe and John and all of them get in bed no sir stay there with God you know that sound they used to sing there are times I'd like to be all along with Christ my lord I can tell them all my troubles all along that's what we need again that's them kind of meetings that's the kind of church that prays down the blessings of God I'm sure your pastor would appreciate every member become like that how would be if the church would just be like that and that's the beauty of a church it's a group where we got to be in harmony we had to be in yours there's things I do that some of you might not understand there's things you do but I don't I scratch my head but that's the beauty of it God didn't make me like you he made me a certain way to handle the things that I got to deal with but we still had to pray for each other I even though I don't have I don't have to understand all I know is God understands and you have to hold and because of this group in harmony whether it's here or in BC or India anywhere we still have to hold the shield or each other it's the same Holy Ghost scripture says in the unity of the faith we had to be in unity we have to be warm old young sisters brothers there's a reason we're here together there's a reason there sister Carol Rose went to the experiences she went through to help the body in the way she has I was really blessed by your testimonies sister there's one let you know is there's a little blessing to bring a little example last year I went to a bit of a I heard Todd there last year with my job there I knew I had to change jobs I had maxed out and so last main that got atomically you're gonna be getting a new job told me type of personality okay let's go I want it now and because I became discontent in my present circumstance and that created its own problems peace and contentment is a wonderful thing and so as I go through the year getting interviews with jobs I haven't got a sweet clue and they want me y'all to sell insurance to people I haven't got a clue better Jones I'm a machinist by trade I deal with metal I don't deal with insurance so as that was going on I was working a lot and as always once a year at least I burn in both ends and I get sick well I got sick in July and it was like a respiratory infection and to the point where they were doing chest x-rays I was on medication and paupers and last year around August time when we had to camp around that time it got really bad to the point were in the middle of the night I would wake up unable to breathe I couldn't breathe to use the puffer and I talking 20 seconds I'm talking over it's to two minutes so you're out of bed get out of the room so you can try to deal with this contort your body to try to force air into your lungs this was happened night after night and especially around the camp I'd be out on the picnic tables in kitchen trying to suck here it was a wonderful thing and so you really learn how to pray what do you feel like you're on death's door you're minutes away are you really pregnant all the frivolous things to complaints and you really get down to where you live and so God really dealt with me a lot there and over time like it wasn't a instant miracle but over time it slowly start to be able to breathe you know when you get to the point we were seeing stars you're pretty close to blacking out it's not a pleasant thing because then you get a fear of going to sleep because you know this is calm so you fight novice and the devil is really there to poke that and so you struggle to this and so by God's grace there over the next week or so you know this slowly started getting better I'm living waking up and it's only just a cough take the power for impact Abednego but it was only getting maybe three four hours sleep nights so I was getting really burnt out and in the middle of all this I'm looking for a job and pressure work was just wasn't good and then it's about the time and butterly okay I don't know what was said I wouldn't be able to tell you specifically one later what scripture or what he said but I came out of the medium with peace and contentment and it was just like a waterfall just falling over you a week or two later I get a call from my current boss looking for machinist okay well we'll talk about in a month you know you just do things kept get pushed back push back but I'll get over that infection in October with moose hunting this better Joe and when I go moose hunting I 1520 Commodore walk in a daze nothing to me and I did that for three days and I think with Wednesday I bought I was brought up standing or your 1520 climbers one day the next it's like flippers which I trouble go on 50 feet I hand him a license to put a joggers cherry license and I said you take it and I was like that for the rest of the week I had trouble come across the cabin and I developed some kind of skin infection so I couldn't walk got back got the doctor here's the medication you have to keep on keep on this so I did that so from November hoping to the beginning January I was on medication and all that for disinfection it would end the way there's added maintainable level but it never went away and then around Christmastime a few things happened and Lord brought a few things out and anyway I went to a communion and previous years are I ain't no meaning my wife we have received it received healing that's real communion purposes there's a blessing or a curse well I choose a blessing and I just enters another butter that pray for me that God had done something in his life and changed his outlook towards towards me and in that prayer I wouldn't pray desperate and this was hindering me I couldn't do my job right and all that went through communion God put so the two was prayed for each other and I went home and I told my wife I said I claimed it and from that day forward I I never touched any medication I wouldn't be at eight words to but just to find out later and the puzzle prayed for me because he had to change the attitude he felt his the first time you guys should pray for me with nothing between he was all appreciate over me when I was weak I used to be to her I used to be allergic to dogs I'm not allergic anymore all as a result of that prayer everything that I really fought with net has gone just like that but it's because of my brother how's this nurse does what this mean in harmony in unity that's probably gotta come to RM says hearing not question answer while happiness shadow he's not don't you like to have a real Bible Church a real Church where all the spiritual gifts were set in order everything making manifest just exactly should wouldn't that be wonderful now you're going to have to sacrifice not money you're gonna have to sacrifice while some of your own ideas you're gonna have to sacrifice some time in prayer yeah you're gonna have to sacrifice maybe a stubborn will to break down in humility the whole Christian move is sacrificial he that will follow me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me daily isn't that right how often do you have to sacrifice every day Paul said he died daily every day he died that's everything if there's anything Dartmouth [Applause] yeah too many times we think that we got a little sick or something oh wow I'll just take the medication I no need to bother God about that and her one brother says it what are you saving up your prayers for when you get cancer or something but it's true bring everything to God everything you start training but the little things so what you do get hit by big day you're already trained you know how to handle it over in Philippians Africa turn to Philippians 4 I would just back up to say verse four Philippians 4 verse 4 says rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known at Wollman the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Jesus Christ now that I'd like to read that again but I'd like to read it in the amplified so verse 6 do not fret or have any anxiety about anything but in every but in every circumstance in it everything by prayer and petition which is a definite request with Thanksgiving to me continue to make your wants known to God not just your needs but also your wants and God's peace shall be yours that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is that peace which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount guard over your hearts and minds in Jesus Christ hallelujah thank the Lord for that that peace shall be yours and it will try and it will put a garrison set a fortification and mount a guard on the tower over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus and lucas' blessed are those servants whom the Lord who when he cometh shall find watching verily I say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meet and will come forth and serve them so for watching God's gonna come and draw a nice draw near to us and sustain us and pick us up and encourage us keep fighting you know this is not a cakewalk no this is this is a battle at the end of the day our armory is gonna be beat up we're every day but you got to keep it prepared stay in prayer stay watching dig in in victory day but Bram says you say I have had so many trials brother branham I've just been drugged from pillar to post haven't I just told you that that's God to drag you from pillar to post because he trusted you you won't fail him will you you might have fell you might have made a mistake but you won't fail him will you you're raised up again like a real soldier grip the sword and come forward again remember a complete victor and single your focus on Jesus Christ he's the same yesterday today and forever and someday with your eye single looking not distracted single focused on Christ he'll come from the sky with a shout the voice of the Archangel the dead in Christ shall rise and these mortal bodies shall take on a more more immortality and we shall be with them forever till then watch and pray but pretty simple there's nothing complex about it all pretty simple watch and pray the scripture says and these you have the words of eternal life that's eternal so just watch and pray God will take care of the rest if you need changing as you watch and pray he will create that change he'll put you in a situation where you're forced to if you if you're doing if I'm willingly I pray that we are willing vessels it's not a pleasant thing to go through it stubbornly even scripture talks about stubbornness has been idolatry and God don't like idolatry I'd rather not be accumulative that y'all even as he says about the Potter you know clay isn't saying as a part of why have you made me thus God has a reason he made you one way and he made you another he said over and God keeps his word he's a butter we laid to pass the borders of mercy until there's nothing left but judgment but the righteous bilasa had to be punished with the unrighteous God will come and Jesus will redeem his church and will go up in the air to meet him and it'll be far beyond any bombs or troubles and will be protected during that time so children back to your God quickly don't tangle with the world for anything stay out of this modern world stay out of these modern theologies just look to the Lamb of God read your Bible and pray all the time don't be weary be rejoicing happy for the redemption of the church is drawing nigh when we shall see him who died for us I'm looking forward to that day I pray that each and every one of us are to that we're willing to die to anything that stands between us and that moment I hate to miss it just because I wouldn't die to something I hate to get lessened reward because I was too stubborn to give up something so as we know watching is reading the Bible the message message points us back to this just dig in no matter how big or small of Revelation might be matter was on the same level as the parable of the talents just somebody gave 10 some 5 and someone I just prayed it whatever talent God gives me that put it to his use for the kingdom of God yeah I did it we'll get a root on increase by his glory that's all I ask is it whatever God's purpose is for me waiting for my family that is used for his glory hey even even the little child can correct something and the child can change a situation to a word fitly spoken and not even realize that they're in the perfect will of God you know I've seen to what children can do but around McConnell was testified when his daughter corrected him and a visitor when you're visiting young God's in control we're gonna be sensitive to these things and how do we do that we take him to answer to every one of our problems even sister Priscilla with her with her problem and the rest of us we get our different situations so I'm just getting old the answer to what everything is here everything there's nothing that you can get from a psychologist or from theology in about in the world it's all right here everything as David said I will check with those experiences and those that are experienced the reason God got a shepherd or there's a reason why elders hold an important place in the body they have those experiences that can help us you know even the young or you know do y'all can teach something they go through things my kids are going through things now that I didn't go through when I was a kid you know there's that many electronics today then I didn't have when I was young and I'm not that old technology's moving very fast getting up there so as we whine down here if you just turn to psalms 32 zombi to verse five he says I acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin for this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayst be found whose me may s be found surely in the floods of Great Waters they shall not come nigh unto thee thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance I prayed it as our desire today if we would just be on watch and pray that God will become our hiding place he will preserve us from trouble God's not a grandfather he's just not gonna give it without us doing something me it seems pretty simple to read your father and pray and from there you'll get the revelation what your next step is and then what the next step is as it says your footsteps is possession well let's start stepping you know when you've done everything you can maybe your brother has a prayer all your sister has a prayer to help you make that next time it is not all about me or you this is about Christ and everything give him thanks it says in Luke 21 he says watch you therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man I pray that that would be every one of us here today that we will be able to stand before the Son of man Amen I want to thank the Lord for his presence here that's all that I have there for today so that's put a mark any musicians if they could come I just pray to God would just take this and bless us towards her listen to our hearts and maybe spoke to someone today yeah encumber I don't
