[24:27] that is he took my sins away
[24:31] I came to Jesus weary warned and said I
[24:34] just want to mention too that uh
[24:38] it's not not to give a full report or
[24:41] anything like that at this stage but I
[24:42] just wanted to uh ask everybody to just
[24:45] to make the the church
[24:47] acquisition over there matter of prayer
[24:50] we're getting down to the wire and
[24:52] there's
[24:53] you know when God is doing something
[24:55] isn't you know the devil is going to try
[24:57] and make it uh bumpy so uh you know
[25:01] we've run into a few snags but nothing
[25:03] that can't be dealt with by grace
[25:05] so we just want to
[25:07] ask you just to make it a matter of
[25:09] prayer and
[25:10] we hope to have a definite day that
[25:14] we're going to move uh very very shortly
[25:17] we hope
[25:18] so the other thing
[25:20] um
[25:21] I would ask that when we leave today if
[25:25] everybody could take any personal
[25:26] belongings you know kids toys or
[25:28] anything like that or books and stuff
[25:30] that are that we don't need just take it
[25:33] home because we you know we could get
[25:36] the nod to move real fast so
[25:39] um what we want to do is just make sure
[25:40] that if there's any person belonging
[25:42] he's into church you don't need just
[25:44] just take it home and when we get to the
[25:46] other place so we can then you could
[25:48] deal with that and the sisters are
[25:51] understand or working out a plan for how
[25:54] to deal with the cleaning issues over
[25:56] there in the church it's uh as you know
[25:58] it's about 10 times bigger than what we
[26:00] got now so uh I think I think they're
[26:03] working on that and they'll be in touch
[26:04] uh with uh with plans and suggestions
[26:10] and all that sort of thing as time goes
[26:12] on so
[26:13] I just wanted to let you know that
[26:16] other than that God's will be done
[26:19] amen nothing is too hard for God
[26:23] amen let's sing it

[51:41] last service we're going to take the
[51:42] second part of the day of Jubilee
[51:45] John 8 verse 30 says and he spoke these

[51:50] believed on him then said Jesus to those

[52:06] more to come amen he says and you shall

[52:14] and were never in bondage to any man how
[52:16] sayest thou ye shall be made free and
[52:19] Jesus answered them verily verily I say
[52:22] unto you whosoever commit a sin is the
[52:24] servant of sin that's the reason why we
[52:27] need a covering this morning because if
[52:29] he sees sin then you're you're what a
[52:31] servant of it
[52:32] amen but the certain servant abideth not
[52:35] in the house forever but the son abideth
[52:37] forever if the son therefore shall make
[52:40] you free you shall be free indeed amen
[52:43] God bless the read of his word you can
[52:45] have your seats this morning amen we
[52:47] want as I said continue on this series
[52:49] of redemption and I want to take the
[52:50] second part the last part for the day of
[52:53] Jubilee and I want to pick right up
[52:54] where we left off last service and we
[52:56] finish with this quote and I'm just
[52:58] going to read the last bit of it just to
[53:00] kind of give us a springboard this
[53:01] morning
[53:02] brother Brown said this in 1961 he said
[53:05] instead of them go on with the old
[53:07] Orthodox stiff cold church that was the
[53:10] that was the the nature that was the the
[53:13] the attributes of the Jewish church at
[53:15] that time brother Branham said they had
[53:17] slipped into Orthodox stiff coldness he
[53:21] says God sent the Holy Ghost back run
[53:23] all the squatters out and then took it
[53:26] over he said the power of the Holy Ghost
[53:28] came down and the church received the
[53:31] earnest of its salvation amen and we
[53:34] spoke just near the end yes of the last
[53:36] service of that Eternal atonement that's
[53:38] there to intercede for us and so if we
[53:40] have an eternal atonement then we don't
[53:43] have to go to a day of atonement every
[53:44] day is a day of atonement meaning that
[53:46] your sins are forgiven day in and day
[53:48] out there's something that's constantly
[53:50] working amen they say using the big
[53:53] words they say the efficacy of the blood
[53:55] is always there it never loses its power
[53:57] as we've been been singing of even this
[53:59] morning amen so we don't just have a
[54:01] jubilee day because remember remember
[54:03] the Jubilee day was the day of atonement
[54:04] but we have a jubilee age now we have a
[54:07] time of Jubilee we have a span of
[54:09] Jubilee where anybody that hears that
[54:11] gospel where anybody that accepts that
[54:13] blood where anybody that obeys the words
[54:15] of Jesus Christ can be set free amen
[54:18] it's not just a day but it's a season
[54:20] there where he says I'm going to give
[54:21] you the opportunity it's going to be
[54:23] about 2 000 years we know that but
[54:25] within those two thousand years spent
[54:27] anyone can go free if they'll hear the
[54:29] Gospel of Jesus Christ and the prophet
[54:31] of God would say it this way he said the
[54:33] Jubilee is on not just a jubilee for one
[54:36] day but a jubilee for eternity amen now
[54:40] the scripture teaches us in Revelation
[54:42] that if you want to overcome you have to
[54:44] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[54:46] churches amen that is the Jubilee that
[54:48] is the gospel trumpet as you had to hear
[54:50] the word for your day brother Brown will
[54:53] make the simple example he'd say Moses
[54:55] message would not work in Noah's day nor
[54:57] would Noah's work message work in Moses
[54:59] day you had to hear the message for your
[55:02] day and there's a voice and there's a
[55:04] message that's given for each age to set
[55:06] them free from the thing that is most
[55:08] holding them down amen but when we come
[55:11] to the end of our age amen the word is
[55:13] completely open because all the guns of
[55:15] hell are turned on us but then also all
[55:17] the blessings and all the Prophecies of
[55:19] God are turned loose in the word to
[55:21] bring us hope out of this world Amen to
[55:23] take us into Christ take us out of
[55:25] denomination take us out of the just
[55:27] men's ideas and doctrines and and and
[55:30] words without power and bring us into a
[55:32] place where the word can be manifested
[55:34] once again as it was in the original
[55:36] church amen it was Alpha and Omega and
[55:38] he said I am Alpha and Omega he didn't
[55:40] say I'm in between he said I'm the first
[55:42] and the last he that was and is and
[55:44] shall be forevermore so in this age
[55:46] we're looking for the same type of
[55:48] Jubilee that they had on the day of
[55:50] Pentecost and it will take us into what
[55:52] it was supposed to have in the first
[55:53] place which is take us off this Earth we
[55:55] know we had a plan we know he had a plan
[55:57] he knew it was going to go down it was
[55:59] going to go down into darkness and then
[56:00] it was going to come back up remember
[56:02] the all of the Jubilee was to take us
[56:04] off this Earth and restore us back to
[56:06] our eating condition amen we have so
[56:08] many programs today when we look around
[56:10] we're talking about Jubilee remember we
[56:12] have so many programs that are supposed
[56:14] to help us today when you look at what
[56:16] the government has and they have
[56:17] retraining programs and they have
[56:19] Rehabilitation programs and they have
[56:20] support programs and they have this this
[56:23] foundation and that Foundation then we
[56:24] have a charitable organization that does
[56:26] this and one that works with drug
[56:27] addicts and one that works with single
[56:29] mothers and ones that works with people
[56:31] that have lost this and you know
[56:32] veterans and all these different things
[56:34] amen but the problem with those things
[56:36] is that they never set you free you know
[56:39] what they teach you to do they teach you
[56:40] to manage Who You Are
[56:42] right they're leaving you where you're
[56:44] at but they're saying here's how you can
[56:46] make life better
[56:47] but you're still where you always were
[56:50] right they might they might get you into
[56:51] a bit of a different mindset they might
[56:53] make you so you're not suicidal they may
[56:55] make you that you're not addicted but
[56:57] you're still managing who and what you
[56:59] are but Christ doesn't do that he
[57:01] doesn't manage who you are he makes you
[57:03] a new creation through him amen he takes
[57:05] you a new creation he gives you a new
[57:07] birth and that's what we're teaching
[57:09] this morning that's what we're talking
[57:10] about is that you can be changed not
[57:12] that you can just manage your life amen
[57:15] manage life that's what I do really well
[57:17] naturally speaking manage life but that
[57:19] never gave me freedom that never gave me
[57:22] anything where I am today all that did
[57:24] was help me to manage where I was at and
[57:26] it never took me into a place that was
[57:28] at a higher plane amen if we do that if
[57:30] we if we get involved with those things
[57:32] what happens is they never take us
[57:34] anywhere they just take us to a better
[57:36] stage of life right where we're at but
[57:38] we're still there we're still there
[57:40] nothing's really changed
[57:42] we're just standing right where we used
[57:44] to be before just in a bit of a
[57:45] different mentality a bit of a different
[57:48] you know way of looking at things amen
[57:51] and what is it we get caught up then in
[57:53] a cycle don't we and we work we eat we
[57:56] entertain and we sleep we work we eat we
[57:58] entertain and we sleep and what do we do
[58:00] we're living for when we get home from
[58:02] work we're living for the weekend right
[58:04] living for the weekend some I think
[58:06] there's a song about that isn't there
[58:07] that's all people are doing is they're
[58:09] living for the weekend because there's
[58:10] no purpose in the day-to-day they're not
[58:13] in any place where they want to be in
[58:14] the in the middle of the week and
[58:16] everything is so they're just waiting
[58:17] till the end
[58:18] we don't want to wait till the end
[58:20] church we don't want to be waiting for
[58:22] something we want to be in the middle of
[58:23] it day in and day out to see what God is
[58:25] doing to be a part of it to know what
[58:27] he's doing and say it's in my life it's
[58:29] not just in my brother and sisters
[58:31] amen the prophet says this he says what
[58:34] a picture it gives us tonight of the
[58:35] church in this last days he says you see
[58:38] what man can do and then you see what
[58:40] God does and you look at the
[58:42] denominations I was watching a clip of a
[58:44] minister yesterday on YouTube and I say
[58:46] Minister you know they've got so many
[58:48] prophets out there and these different
[58:49] things and this man is speaking these
[58:51] words and they're they're they're big
[58:53] high words highfaluting words and he's
[58:55] he's trying to bless the people he says
[58:57] now you feel that thing blowing through
[59:00] he's trying to say that it's like the
[59:01] upper room experience believe me they
[59:04] wouldn't be able to sit in their seats
[59:05] if the upper room experience was
[59:06] happening and then there they'd have had
[59:08] the same results there that they did in
[59:10] the day of Pentecost they meant but he's
[59:12] sitting there and he's trying to preach
[59:13] to them that he's got a day of Pentecost
[59:15] going on and the people are sitting
[59:16] there dead as a doornail why because you
[59:18] can't put the life of God into somebody
[59:20] by just talking about it it's a new it's
[59:22] a new birth it's an experience that they
[59:24] have to have Amen brother Bob says you
[59:26] can see what man is doing he's in if you
[59:29] look at at the condition of the church
[59:31] in the in the seventh Church age in the
[59:33] late Asian Church age God is outside of
[59:35] it that's what man can do man can put
[59:37] God out
[59:39] that that in over seven Church ages what
[59:42] they achieved was they finally got out
[59:44] of the church
[59:45] isn't that amazing that that that's the
[59:47] the Pinnacle of man's achievement is
[59:49] that God is now outside of their of the
[59:51] very thing that he supposedly started
[59:53] amen he says What man does is failing
[59:57] and will fail has failed and always will
[1:00:00] fail but what God does is eternal and
[1:00:03] must forever remain nothing can ever
[1:00:05] take it away God give it it's his free
[1:00:08] gift and by his Sovereign foresight saw
[1:00:11] it and placed it and there's nothing can
[1:00:14] ever move it it's there eternally and
[1:00:17] Jubilee was God's manner of expressing
[1:00:19] Grace to his people for restoring or
[1:00:22] being brought back to their rightful
[1:00:25] position
[1:00:26] so there's got to be a place waiting for
[1:00:28] you and there's got to be a people
[1:00:29] that's ordained to be placed in there
[1:00:31] that's what he's saying he's saying is
[1:00:32] that God knew this before it ever
[1:00:34] happened and he made a way for us by
[1:00:36] Grace but there's a place that we have
[1:00:38] to go it is not just being set free but
[1:00:41] there's a place that we have to go and
[1:00:43] if we take it back to the scriptures in
[1:00:44] Exodus 3 this is the The Exodus from
[1:00:47] from K from Egypt and this is the
[1:00:49] original Jubilee it says and the Lord
[1:00:52] said I have surely seen the Affliction
[1:00:54] of my people which are in Egypt and have
[1:00:56] heard their Cry by reason of their task
[1:00:58] Masters for I know their sorrows
[1:01:01] do you know what caught his attention
[1:01:04] the cries of the people
[1:01:07] we have to cry out
[1:01:10] brother Branham said that God will send
[1:01:12] the Holy Spirit to put an unction in
[1:01:14] your heart to call for the things that
[1:01:17] God is trying to bring you away
[1:01:19] so if there is no unction then there is
[1:01:21] nothing coming your way I'm sorry to say
[1:01:23] but if you're crying out if you're
[1:01:25] saying Lord I have a need Lord I need
[1:01:28] Deliverance Lord It's So weary some I'm
[1:01:30] so tired I'm so worn out I'm so
[1:01:33] depressed I'm so overworked and
[1:01:35] underpaid
[1:01:36] anyone ever feel like you're putting
[1:01:38] more in than you're getting out that
[1:01:41] happens in your Christian walk when
[1:01:42] you're a server
[1:01:43] when you're serving you can give so much
[1:01:45] and you take so little mothers will feel
[1:01:47] this especially put in work day in and
[1:01:50] day out their work never ends and at the
[1:01:52] end who's going to fill them up
[1:01:54] but you got to be crying for something
[1:01:56] that's the Holy Spirit working in you
[1:01:58] and it's saying there's something coming
[1:02:00] and I'm preparing your heart for because
[1:02:02] if you're crying for it when it comes
[1:02:04] you'll be ready to receive it by then
[1:02:05] but remember they were cold and stiff
[1:02:07] and formal and guess what that means
[1:02:09] there's no unction there it means the
[1:02:11] holy spirit's not moving there's no
[1:02:12] anticipation there's no desperation
[1:02:15] There's No Cry in their heart for the
[1:02:16] moving of the Lord and guess what that
[1:02:19] means that he has to be very very
[1:02:20] Sovereign to come and touch you in that
[1:02:21] condition
[1:02:22] because you won't even recognize the
[1:02:24] presence of God you won't even recognize
[1:02:26] the gospel trumpet when it comes along
[1:02:29] but he says in verse 8 I am come down to
[1:02:31] deliver them out of the hands of the
[1:02:32] Egyptians
[1:02:34] we say that's the Jubilee
[1:02:36] but he says and
[1:02:38] and there's more than just taking you
[1:02:40] out he says and to bring them up out of
[1:02:43] that land into a good land and a large
[1:02:45] unto a land flowing with milk and honey
[1:02:48] unto the place of the Canaanites
[1:02:50] Hittites amorites parasites the hivites
[1:02:53] and the jebusites so we have to see that
[1:02:56] when God is here to give us a jubilee
[1:02:57] it's not just to free us
[1:03:00] it's not just to set us free you know
[1:03:02] there's a lot of people that have
[1:03:03] claimed the salvation of Jesus Christ
[1:03:05] this morning and that's all they have
[1:03:08] they claim the blood they've claimed the
[1:03:10] finished work of Calvary and they're
[1:03:12] sitting there and their guilt is gone
[1:03:14] but they're still where they always were
[1:03:16] they haven't moved to another land
[1:03:18] flowing with milk and honey they haven't
[1:03:20] moved to a place of possession they're
[1:03:22] haven't moved to a place of inheritance
[1:03:24] they haven't moved to a place that God
[1:03:26] ordained for them to have before the
[1:03:28] foundation of the world Amen so what is
[1:03:31] it God hasn't just come to deliver us
[1:03:33] but he's taking us to a place that
[1:03:34] surpasses anything we've ever
[1:03:36] experienced before
[1:03:37] he's taken us to a higher plane not just
[1:03:40] of Revelation but of Life of experience
[1:03:44] Amen brother Brian would say Joshua here
[1:03:46] is a book of redemption of the Old
[1:03:49] Testament because Redemption has two
[1:03:51] parts Redemption anywhere has two parts
[1:03:53] that is it's out of and into it takes
[1:03:58] two parts to make Redemption out of and
[1:04:00] into he said Moses represented the law
[1:04:02] which brought them out of Egypt whereas
[1:04:04] Joshua represented Grace that took them
[1:04:07] into the Promised Land
[1:04:08] he says another way to say it is the law
[1:04:11] and Grace were two aspects of God's
[1:04:13] command
[1:04:14] I want to stop here because this is
[1:04:16] critical you notice the out of part is
[1:04:18] Law and the into part is Grace
[1:04:22] because remember when they were going to
[1:04:23] leave Egypt they had to be under law
[1:04:25] didn't they because the law came to
[1:04:27] Moses and God said they have to take a
[1:04:29] perfect lamb they have to sacrifice it
[1:04:32] they have to put the blood over the lint
[1:04:34] on the on the lentil of the doorposts
[1:04:36] and then they have to go in they have to
[1:04:37] eat the lamb they have to have
[1:04:39] unleavened bread and they have to have
[1:04:40] their staff in their hand they had to be
[1:04:42] ready to go
[1:04:44] but if they didn't do that then what
[1:04:46] happened
[1:04:47] because they're under law
[1:04:49] Deathstroke
[1:04:50] and guess what somebody didn't get to go
[1:04:52] in the Jubilee because they didn't obey
[1:04:55] if the blood wasn't over the door if the
[1:04:57] lamb wasn't slain then the death angel
[1:04:59] would come in and the firstborn wasn't
[1:05:00] going to make it out of Egypt that day
[1:05:02] amen the death angel didn't have to pass
[1:05:04] if you didn't do what the law said
[1:05:06] so it was law that brought them out it
[1:05:09] was Grace and that it gave them a way
[1:05:11] out but they had to do it a certain way
[1:05:13] and if they didn't do it if they chose
[1:05:15] something else if they did an imperfect
[1:05:16] land if they didn't put the if they
[1:05:18] slayed the lamp but didn't put the blood
[1:05:20] on the post God didn't have to pass by
[1:05:22] them
[1:05:22] so there's a way of doing things amen so
[1:05:25] even today even under the law of Grace
[1:05:27] there is a law that takes us out that we
[1:05:29] have to do and we know what that is amen
[1:05:33] because you have to hear the right
[1:05:34] trumpet there is something that's going
[1:05:36] to take you out of and then there's
[1:05:38] going to be something that brings you
[1:05:39] into them we know the prescription we
[1:05:41] know the law is what Acts 2 38. it's
[1:05:44] very simple we've turned it into
[1:05:45] something else in the message and I
[1:05:47] don't know how we got there but Acts 2
[1:05:49] 38 is the new birth
[1:05:51] and we know that this is the key we know
[1:05:53] that this is real because when Peter
[1:05:55] preached it in Acts 2 38 God confirmed
[1:05:58] it by giving three thousand Souls the
[1:06:00] Holy Ghost right afterwards amen that
[1:06:03] was the proof the proof is that you must
[1:06:05] what you must well here's the Scripture
[1:06:07] it says when they heard this they were
[1:06:09] pricked in their heart and said unto
[1:06:10] Peter and the rest of the Apostles men
[1:06:12] and Brethren what shall we do their
[1:06:14] hearts were pricked because they had a
[1:06:16] they had a problem they had crucified
[1:06:17] Jesus
[1:06:19] and they knew that they had to they had
[1:06:20] to make it right they knew that they
[1:06:22] were in sinful condition then they had
[1:06:24] to get rid of this conviction and Peter
[1:06:26] said unto them repent and be baptized in
[1:06:29] the name every one of you in the name of
[1:06:31] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:06:33] that's the law
[1:06:35] and none of us gets past that you can be
[1:06:37] raised in a message home you still have
[1:06:40] to repent and you still have to be
[1:06:41] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:06:43] the remission of sins That's the Law
[1:06:45] that's the prescription
[1:06:47] and then he says and you shall receive
[1:06:49] the gift of the Holy Ghost that's Grace
[1:06:51] that's the grace part the law takes you
[1:06:53] out of and the Holy Ghost takes you into
[1:06:55] it amen that's the grace of God to each
[1:06:57] and every one of us so the law takes you
[1:06:59] out of slavery and debt but the grace
[1:07:01] takes you into possession
[1:07:03] but you've got to come the way that he
[1:07:05] said amen because otherwise what happens
[1:07:07] is you do what you think of what God
[1:07:10] means in the word and because you don't
[1:07:12] have the Holy Ghost you can't discern
[1:07:13] the things of God and so you make up
[1:07:15] what you think it's going to be and then
[1:07:17] you go find a church that believes the
[1:07:19] way that you think it should be or worse
[1:07:21] you can't find a church that believes
[1:07:22] what you want so you stay at home and
[1:07:24] you feed yourself and you go right down
[1:07:25] to death you go right to hell that way
[1:07:27] because you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:07:29] inside of you you've got to have the new
[1:07:31] birth that the Holy Ghost will Quicken
[1:07:32] these things amen otherwise you're just
[1:07:34] going to turn yourself into two full two
[1:07:36] full more a child of hell because you'll
[1:07:38] just be a religious spirit walking
[1:07:39] around this Earth
[1:07:41] brother Brown continues he says now the
[1:07:43] law brought them out Moses and Joshua
[1:07:45] took them in it also represents
[1:07:47] something for our day now it represents
[1:07:50] as they were in the Journey coming from
[1:07:51] Egypt to a promised land so have we come
[1:07:54] out of a world of Egypt Egypt chaos he
[1:07:57] says and we're on the road our road to a
[1:08:00] promised land in my father's house are
[1:08:02] many mansions if it wasn't so I would
[1:08:04] have told you he says John 14 coming out
[1:08:08] of and going into
[1:08:10] so what I want you to realize this
[1:08:12] morning and perhaps speaking mostly to
[1:08:13] the young people here that being
[1:08:15] repenting and being baptized in the name
[1:08:17] of Jesus Christ is not the end of your
[1:08:19] journey
[1:08:21] it's not just the point in life and then
[1:08:22] I'm good to go but it is the start of a
[1:08:25] journey because all you've done there is
[1:08:26] you've come out of
[1:08:28] but now you got to go into
[1:08:30] you got to keep moving you got to put
[1:08:31] one foot in front of the other you can't
[1:08:33] stand there and rest on The Laurels of
[1:08:35] having been baptized in the name of
[1:08:36] Jesus Christ amen free indeed doesn't
[1:08:39] mean you've just started the journey but
[1:08:40] it means you've completed the journey
[1:08:42] when you're really done the journey when
[1:08:44] you really take a resurrection and a
[1:08:46] Rapture that's when you're going to be
[1:08:48] truly free indeed amen but there's a
[1:08:50] process there's a journey that's going
[1:08:51] on between it brother Brown would say
[1:08:54] this in the mark of the beast he says it
[1:08:55] shall be light in the evening time
[1:08:58] that's right while evening lights are
[1:09:00] shining why don't you receive it why
[1:09:03] don't you come to it don't be sealed
[1:09:05] away don't set dead believe on the Lord
[1:09:08] Jesus Christ and be sealed into the
[1:09:10] kingdom what is the mark of the beast to
[1:09:13] reject the Holy Ghost
[1:09:16] see the borderline see after he once
[1:09:19] come to the knowledge of the truth he
[1:09:20] says for it's impossible for those who
[1:09:23] are once enlightened see coming up to
[1:09:26] the knowledge of the truth and seeing
[1:09:28] that they see the truth see the
[1:09:30] knowledge of it and see it's here
[1:09:33] see it working
[1:09:35] see it's right and have a knowledge of
[1:09:38] the truth and then turn away again he
[1:09:41] says there remaineth no more sacrifice
[1:09:43] for sin
[1:09:45] it's a scary thing when we turn down the
[1:09:47] truth isn't it you know they have that
[1:09:49] saying a little knowledge is dangerous
[1:09:52] it's a dangerous thing
[1:09:54] that's what he says here you come up and
[1:09:56] you see it
[1:09:57] you hear it you recognize it and then
[1:10:00] for whatever reason you say I don't want
[1:10:02] it
[1:10:03] and he says when you do that he says
[1:10:05] that's the mark of the beast because
[1:10:07] what happens remember it was a sign in
[1:10:09] the head or it was a sign in the head
[1:10:10] and what does he do he says when you do
[1:10:12] that then what happens is you get
[1:10:15] a whole board in your ear and you can't
[1:10:17] hear it anymore
[1:10:18] that was a thing that scared me all my
[1:10:20] life as a young man was that I turned
[1:10:22] down the day that God had appointed and
[1:10:25] I was going to keep moving away from him
[1:10:27] at that point but the conviction was
[1:10:29] always there that's the beautiful thing
[1:10:31] if the conviction's there you know
[1:10:32] you're still okay
[1:10:34] don't test God though
[1:10:36] remember what he said he says while the
[1:10:37] light's shining why don't we take it now
[1:10:39] amen while it's still here amen we're so
[1:10:42] knowledgeable today
[1:10:43] you know what knowledge is information
[1:10:45] that's all it is you know what wisdom is
[1:10:47] the application of knowledge in a way
[1:10:50] that's beneficial
[1:10:51] and you've got to get wisdom you can't
[1:10:53] just have the knowledge you can't just
[1:10:55] have the doctrine of the message you've
[1:10:57] got to have the wisdom of God to see
[1:10:58] what that's supposed to do and let it
[1:11:00] have a work in your life for each and
[1:11:01] every one of us but today there's so
[1:11:03] much knowledge and there's so much
[1:11:04] information you can't keep up with it
[1:11:06] used to be that knowledge doubled every
[1:11:08] six months and I don't even know where
[1:11:09] it is now I think it's about two or
[1:11:10] three months the knowledge of man
[1:11:12] doubles they can't even print it all
[1:11:14] there's so much of it that's why we need
[1:11:16] something like the internet that's why
[1:11:18] we need cloud storage and computer
[1:11:19] storage and these things is because
[1:11:20] nobody could could contain the things
[1:11:22] that are that are in the knowledge of
[1:11:24] man at this point
[1:11:25] but where has it gotten us
[1:11:27] death destruction we've got more
[1:11:30] efficiency in our homes and with our
[1:11:32] appliances than we've ever had and yet
[1:11:34] we have less time somehow than they had
[1:11:36] in the in the in the 1600s when they had
[1:11:38] to do everything by hand
[1:11:40] it's amazing isn't it what has it got us
[1:11:42] it's gotten us all this time we use it
[1:11:43] to waste it's a shame but the thing is
[1:11:46] we can then look at the word of God
[1:11:48] and we can say we've got a lot of
[1:11:49] knowledge there too
[1:11:51] because we had a Prophet come in this
[1:11:53] day and he opened up the word and guess
[1:11:55] what there was a lot of knowledge
[1:11:56] available for those that want to get it
[1:11:58] it's amazing the people that are out
[1:12:00] there that have looked at the message of
[1:12:01] William Branham and have taken it and
[1:12:03] adapted it to use in their churches
[1:12:06] and it's knowledge and they have a
[1:12:08] certain understanding of it and even
[1:12:10] we've had it within the message where
[1:12:11] they took these Revelations and what did
[1:12:13] they do they used it to divide
[1:12:16] and they got arrogant and they got
[1:12:18] dismissive and you had cold and formal
[1:12:20] starchy churches on one hand and then
[1:12:22] you have fanatical churches on the other
[1:12:24] and it was the isms that we've talked
[1:12:25] about in the last couple Services where
[1:12:27] they said if you don't listen to this
[1:12:28] man or you don't preach this Doctrine or
[1:12:30] your church isn't this way or your
[1:12:32] people aren't that way or you don't do
[1:12:33] this you don't do that then you're not a
[1:12:35] part of the bride of Christ and you're
[1:12:36] not going in a rapture
[1:12:38] you'll never see that you'll never see
[1:12:40] that look at Paul's messages to the many
[1:12:42] churches he dealt with and how different
[1:12:44] they were some were fantastic in some
[1:12:46] areas and they were just children and
[1:12:49] others and then the others were
[1:12:50] fantastic in the areas where the other
[1:12:52] ones were children and then Paul had to
[1:12:53] had to rebuke them and correct them in
[1:12:55] other areas each one of us is Sovereign
[1:12:57] and God works with each Church in their
[1:12:58] different ways amen but what is it that
[1:13:01] happened is people got the letter of the
[1:13:03] word they got the knowledge of the word
[1:13:05] and the spirit got pushed out and so it
[1:13:08] led to what church splits people falling
[1:13:11] by the wayside cold and formal churches
[1:13:13] exactly what he came to bring us out of
[1:13:15] in the very first place amen now you say
[1:13:17] brother John that's pretty harsh and it
[1:13:19] is harsh but it's true
[1:13:22] probably the older ones amongst us would
[1:13:24] know it better than the younger ones do
[1:13:25] because we saw the all those different
[1:13:27] things roll through we saw two Souls we
[1:13:29] saw Perugia and all those different
[1:13:30] things and they rolled through and where
[1:13:32] are they now today
[1:13:34] most of them are dead and their churches
[1:13:35] are dead and the people are nowhere and
[1:13:37] they've got no young people they have no
[1:13:38] New Birth it's just a bunch of old
[1:13:39] people standing around having Church why
[1:13:41] because they left the life out of it and
[1:13:43] they went by the letter of it but listen
[1:13:45] to this
[1:13:46] because I'm not saying this of myself
[1:13:48] I'm saying this according to the
[1:13:49] scriptures now listen to what Paul said
[1:13:51] about himself he said lest I should be
[1:13:53] exalted above measure through the
[1:13:55] abundance of the revelations
[1:13:58] Paul says I have to watch out that I
[1:14:01] don't get lifted up that I don't get
[1:14:03] proud that I don't get arrogant because
[1:14:05] I know more than anybody else
[1:14:08] it takes a special man to write that I
[1:14:10] know more than anybody else doesn't it
[1:14:11] but he wrote it by the Holy Spirit he
[1:14:14] says
[1:14:15] basically to keep me from getting lifted
[1:14:17] up there was given to me a thorn in the
[1:14:20] flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet
[1:14:23] me lest I should be exalted above
[1:14:25] measure listen Paul was the prophet of
[1:14:28] the age
[1:14:29] his position was to have an abundance of
[1:14:32] Revelation
[1:14:34] that was that was his calling that was
[1:14:36] his play scene and yet he says I needed
[1:14:40] something to keep me humble in all of
[1:14:41] this to keep me from getting puffed up
[1:14:43] to think that I was anything different
[1:14:45] than anybody else and we know that it
[1:14:47] worked because Paul said I'm the
[1:14:49] chiefest of sinners
[1:14:50] Paul never got lifted up in all of it he
[1:14:52] says and he gets into I think it's in
[1:14:54] Corinthians he says now listen I could
[1:14:56] talk as a man and say I'm this and I'm
[1:14:58] that and I'm this and I'm that and that
[1:14:59] he says remember I'm being foolish like
[1:15:01] a man and I could say this and that he
[1:15:03] had all of the all of the attributes he
[1:15:05] had all the characteristics to be a
[1:15:06] powerful Ministry and to draw people to
[1:15:09] him but he never did it he humbled
[1:15:11] himself so the working of God was
[1:15:13] effective in this man
[1:15:14] so listen if Paul needed it how much
[1:15:17] more do the rest of us need it amen we
[1:15:19] think we've got something special and
[1:15:21] then we get puffed up and what do we do
[1:15:23] God just has to take the little pin and
[1:15:25] go
[1:15:30] God help us amen
[1:15:34] but look look at what Paul says after
[1:15:37] this
[1:15:38] he says what he's speaking to other
[1:15:40] ministers now came the word of God out
[1:15:42] from you or came it unto you only
[1:15:46] If any man think himself to be a prophet
[1:15:49] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[1:15:51] the things that I write unto you are the
[1:15:54] Commandments of the Lord he had to be
[1:15:56] able to say that without getting puffed
[1:15:58] up
[1:16:00] and we know it worked we know it worked
[1:16:04] Paul would would write harshly and then
[1:16:07] he to do what to set the people in order
[1:16:09] and then he'd come right back around and
[1:16:11] said it it tore me up to write that
[1:16:13] he says but I did it for your sake
[1:16:16] now he says let's fix let's fix it you
[1:16:18] did what you needed to and I believe
[1:16:20] that you did it in the right way so now
[1:16:21] let's restore that brother and let's get
[1:16:23] the church back in order and let's do
[1:16:24] all these different things he was hard
[1:16:26] where he had to be hard but it never
[1:16:27] elevated him up to a place where God
[1:16:29] couldn't use him
[1:16:31] but Abraham says and now look what the
[1:16:33] church has done it's either got off on a
[1:16:36] bunch of fanaticism
[1:16:37] and either went real starchy and stiff
[1:16:39] and take none of it
[1:16:42] it's a bunch of hooping and hollering he
[1:16:44] says or they go and they take on a bunch
[1:16:46] of something else and get starchy and
[1:16:47] stiff
[1:16:48] brother there's a middle of the road
[1:16:50] where the real true gospel is preached
[1:16:54] and the real true Bible signs and
[1:16:56] wonders following now listen to this a
[1:16:58] Sweet Holy Spirit leads the church
[1:17:01] that's the kind of church to go to
[1:17:04] unintelligent Church oh oh it's okay to
[1:17:07] be intelligent
[1:17:09] but don't stop there
[1:17:12] he says preaching the word
[1:17:15] standing on the word that's where you're
[1:17:17] living now right with a real Full Gospel
[1:17:20] sermon the real spirit of God everything
[1:17:23] in the spirit everything is decent
[1:17:26] everybody in order everything in love
[1:17:29] that's the kind of church we want
[1:17:31] how many wants to belong to that church
[1:17:33] raise your hands he says why sure we all
[1:17:36] do well God wants us to he said what
[1:17:39] made the difference otherwise he says
[1:17:41] how do we get where we are today in so
[1:17:43] many places we just started getting a
[1:17:46] little bit arrogant and different in our
[1:17:49] churches he said and the dove flew away
[1:17:53] what is it getting different for the
[1:17:55] sake of being different to try and draw
[1:17:58] and put a spotlight on yourself for what
[1:18:00] you have that other people don't have
[1:18:02] comparing yourself to other churches
[1:18:04] putting other ministers down lifting up
[1:18:07] the ones that are like you
[1:18:09] right us for and no more
[1:18:12] Circles of Fellowship
[1:18:14] Antichrist Church Antichrist
[1:18:18] when you say this they they've got it
[1:18:20] and nobody else does anti-christ because
[1:18:23] he has a global multi-member body and
[1:18:26] they ain't just all coming from one
[1:18:28] church or one Ministry group
[1:18:30] it's rolling around these days
[1:18:32] it's rolling around beware of it
[1:18:35] don't let somebody put you down and
[1:18:38] don't let somebody lift you up in these
[1:18:39] things stay in the middle of the road
[1:18:41] stay where God has put you stay where
[1:18:43] God has placed you amen what is it
[1:18:45] brother Rams talk about he says you
[1:18:46] tried to prove yourself more spiritual
[1:18:48] than the next guy
[1:18:50] don't do that
[1:18:52] amen because what happens is he's going
[1:18:54] to prick that balloon pretty quick
[1:18:56] and you're going to fall down
[1:18:58] and it's not going to be funny man
[1:19:02] but were warned against willful failure
[1:19:04] to hear the word of God
[1:19:06] brother Brian remember brother Jones
[1:19:07] said so often he says they don't he says
[1:19:09] they don't recognize the other Angel
[1:19:10] here
[1:19:11] you got to recognize the word of God
[1:19:13] when it comes your way
[1:19:15] and you've got to be quick to take it
[1:19:17] you got to say that's for me that
[1:19:18] applies to me amen
[1:19:20] brother Brown would say this he say many
[1:19:21] times men and women hear God's truth see
[1:19:24] it Vindicated and proven truth but yet
[1:19:26] they don't want to hear it there's some
[1:19:28] other reason there's some other choosing
[1:19:31] that they have than to face up to truth
[1:19:34] and facts therefore their ears can be
[1:19:36] closed to the gospel they'll never hear
[1:19:38] it again my advice to you when God
[1:19:41] speaks to your heart you act right then
[1:19:45] so the question is what is the holy
[1:19:47] spirit trying to say into our lives
[1:19:49] Church
[1:19:51] when the word shines its light into our
[1:19:53] life do we run
[1:19:55] or do we stand there
[1:19:57] do we admit brother Brown says what face
[1:20:01] up to the truth and facts
[1:20:03] we've got to look at the facts sometimes
[1:20:05] in our life
[1:20:06] because what happens is we get caught up
[1:20:08] in the idea that I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:10] therefore there can never be anything
[1:20:12] wrong or missing in my life and you know
[1:20:14] what that is that's an antichrist spirit
[1:20:16] because you're on a journey you're
[1:20:19] growing into maturity and then you're
[1:20:21] coming to a certain place you're coming
[1:20:24] to adoption as we're going to get into
[1:20:25] much much further down the road you're
[1:20:27] coming to something so don't sit there
[1:20:29] and say because I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:20:31] nothing ever is going to happen wrong in
[1:20:33] my life I'm not going to make a bad
[1:20:35] decision I'm not going to do the wrong
[1:20:36] thing I'm not going to get caught up in
[1:20:38] influence I'm not going to get addicted
[1:20:40] to anything I'm not going to get bound
[1:20:41] up in anything you will you will
[1:20:44] I have
[1:20:47] and I guarantee you that anybody here
[1:20:48] that's honest with themselves will say
[1:20:50] the same things they can get trapped
[1:20:52] listen the scripture says a just man
[1:20:54] falls seven times and he gets up again
[1:20:56] he's not just because he didn't fall
[1:20:58] down he's just because he gets up and
[1:20:59] keeps going and going and going amen
[1:21:01] don't sit here with a facade and say I
[1:21:04] can't admit that I've ever got a need
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:09] listen we've got an open word laying
[1:21:10] before us
[1:21:12] so the slackness is not with God
[1:21:14] the unwillingness is not with God
[1:21:17] God has laid it all bare and said this
[1:21:19] is for you church this is for you bride
[1:21:22] not just church but bride this is to
[1:21:25] bring you closer to me so the the the
[1:21:27] the the there's no laxness with God the
[1:21:30] laxness is with us
[1:21:32] saying I need that I want that I'm
[1:21:35] supposed to have that because the word
[1:21:37] says that I'm supposed to have it amen
[1:21:39] he's shown us the way he's opened our
[1:21:40] eyes he's opened our ears he's made us
[1:21:43] able to accept it so why when it comes
[1:21:45] then would we turn it down
[1:21:46] brother Brown says there's another
[1:21:48] choosing that they have there's some
[1:21:50] other reason there's something holding
[1:21:52] us back in there
[1:21:54] so do we shrink back
[1:21:56] when the Holy Spirit comes and discerns
[1:21:58] into our life do we shrink back
[1:22:01] on the off chance that
[1:22:03] she or he might realize that I struggle
[1:22:05] just as much as they do
[1:22:07] that I might actually be human
[1:22:10] ministers especially have to guard this
[1:22:12] but guess what as parents as husbands
[1:22:14] anybody that has any position or
[1:22:17] authority or influence that's the
[1:22:18] hardest thing to do is admit that you
[1:22:20] need help just like your kids do
[1:22:22] that God needs to work in your life just
[1:22:24] as much as it does for your wife
[1:22:26] that a minister needs needs God moving
[1:22:29] and changing and cleaning him day in and
[1:22:30] day out just as much as the laypeople
[1:22:32] amen there is no difference between me
[1:22:35] and you
[1:22:36] none whatsoever I have a gift to
[1:22:38] minister you don't that's the only
[1:22:40] difference but in every other way I'm no
[1:22:42] different than you
[1:22:44] so why pretend otherwise
[1:22:47] why pretend otherwise as an elder as a
[1:22:49] deacon as a husband as a pillar in the
[1:22:51] church as somebody that's been serving
[1:22:53] God for 40 years that doesn't mean you
[1:22:56] don't need something new every single
[1:22:58] day that you don't need to be pulled
[1:22:59] away from the world and drawn closer to
[1:23:01] Christ amen
[1:23:04] listen Paul talks about this in
[1:23:06] Corinthians he says if therefore the
[1:23:08] whole church just come together into one
[1:23:10] place and I'll speak with tongues and
[1:23:12] they're coming those that are unlearned
[1:23:14] or unbelievers will they not say you are
[1:23:16] mad
[1:23:17] but if all prophesying there come in one
[1:23:19] that believeth not or one unlearned he's
[1:23:21] convinced of all he's judged of all and
[1:23:23] thus are the secrets of his heart May
[1:23:25] manifest and so falling down on his face
[1:23:27] he will worship God and report that God
[1:23:30] is in you of Truth now I pulled that out
[1:23:32] of the Amplified here it says if
[1:23:34] everyone prophesies giving inspired
[1:23:37] testimony and interpreting the Divine
[1:23:39] will and purpose and an unbeliever or
[1:23:41] untaught Outsider comes in he is told of
[1:23:44] his sin and reproved and convicted and
[1:23:46] convinced by all and his defects and
[1:23:49] needs are examined or determined and he
[1:23:51] is called to account by all the secrets
[1:23:54] of his heart are laid bare and so
[1:23:56] falling on his face he will worship God
[1:23:58] declaring that God is among you in very
[1:24:00] truth so if that's what the unbeliever's
[1:24:03] response should be what are ours to be
[1:24:06] amen when the Holy Spirit is moving
[1:24:08] whether it's a rebuke whether it's
[1:24:10] encouragement whether it's correction
[1:24:12] whether it's love whatever it might be
[1:24:14] when it's moving into our Lives why do
[1:24:16] we resist it
[1:24:18] there's another reason there somebody
[1:24:20] else is in the castle that day
[1:24:22] and it's blocking up our ears and saying
[1:24:24] you don't have to listen to that but God
[1:24:27] has sent the Holy Spirit to free us
[1:24:30] he sent it to free us and so we have to
[1:24:32] hear it and say that's for me
[1:24:35] I don't have it in in here I just put
[1:24:37] wrote it down in my notes and in the
[1:24:39] office in John 3 verse 20 says everyone
[1:24:41] that doeth evil hateth the light neither
[1:24:44] cometh to the light lest their deeds
[1:24:46] should be reproved
[1:24:48] but he that doeth truth cometh to the
[1:24:51] light that his deed may be made manifest
[1:24:54] that they are wrought in God
[1:24:57] so those that are of God come to the
[1:24:58] light and they stay in the light and
[1:25:01] when something comes in that isn't Godly
[1:25:03] then they want it there because Satan
[1:25:05] dwells in the darkness he dwells in the
[1:25:07] secrets he dwells in the shame that he
[1:25:09] can put there and if the light can come
[1:25:10] in and you can accept it then Satan has
[1:25:13] no place left to hide and you remove his
[1:25:15] influence out of your life amen you have
[1:25:17] to lay yourself bare before the
[1:25:18] preaching of the word before the hearing
[1:25:20] of the word amen let us humble ourselves
[1:25:23] let's humble ourselves and say Lord the
[1:25:26] word says I'm supposed to be here
[1:25:28] and right now I'm down here
[1:25:31] Lord the word says I'm supposed to have
[1:25:33] fruit that's producing up here and Lord
[1:25:35] I don't have any fruit
[1:25:37] Lord I'm struggling and I ought not to
[1:25:39] be struggling because your word says
[1:25:41] this isn't supposed to be in my life
[1:25:43] right
[1:25:44] listen that's where we're supposed to be
[1:25:46] remember the Jubilee trumpet is not for
[1:25:48] the free man it's for the slave it's for
[1:25:51] the one in debt it's for the one that's
[1:25:52] bound it's for the one that's in jail in
[1:25:54] prison in shackles
[1:25:56] so the gospel is for those that want to
[1:25:59] be free not those that are going to
[1:26:01] pretend they're free amen
[1:26:02] listen don't worry if you're not perfect
[1:26:06] worry if you're satisfied Where You Are
[1:26:09] worry if you're okay to be the way you
[1:26:11] are the rest of your life because that
[1:26:13] means that your ears are stopped up to
[1:26:15] the gospel trumpet because it's always
[1:26:18] calling us forward it's a journey it's
[1:26:20] always pulling us amen face up to facts
[1:26:23] as brother Branham said
[1:26:24] listen the gospel says that we're
[1:26:26] fighting every day yeah
[1:26:28] in Galatians 5 Paul says this I say then
[1:26:32] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:26:34] fulfill the lust of the flesh for the
[1:26:37] flesh lusteth against the spirit and the
[1:26:39] spirit against the flesh you know what
[1:26:41] that means there's a battle
[1:26:42] if you've got the Holy Spirit there's a
[1:26:44] battle
[1:26:45] you know where there's even more of a
[1:26:47] battle if you have the knowledge but not
[1:26:49] the life
[1:26:50] that's even worse but if you got the
[1:26:53] spirit then you've got a real battle on
[1:26:54] your hands because this outer flesh this
[1:26:56] is not saved
[1:26:57] it's imperfect it'll never be it's got
[1:27:00] to be transformed we gotta we've got to
[1:27:02] get a glorified body Amen to get out of
[1:27:04] this pest house
[1:27:05] but Paul says it wrestles against the
[1:27:07] flesh these are contrary one to the
[1:27:10] other so that you cannot do the things
[1:27:12] that you would Paul's saying that
[1:27:14] there's a fight and it's trying to keep
[1:27:16] you from doing what's in the in the in
[1:27:18] the tower in the control tower of your
[1:27:20] heart which is the holy spirit he says
[1:27:22] this flesh is battling every day to keep
[1:27:25] you from doing the things that you want
[1:27:26] to do
[1:27:28] what is it good desires are not enough
[1:27:30] you got to fight the battle you got to
[1:27:32] accept that there is a battle and guess
[1:27:34] what we've got parts of our life parts
[1:27:36] of our flesh where we're Victorious
[1:27:38] every day
[1:27:39] every day there are some areas where
[1:27:41] Satan cannot touch us we just don't go
[1:27:43] there
[1:27:45] but there's areas of our life where
[1:27:46] we're not Victorious every day we've got
[1:27:48] areas of our life where we're not
[1:27:49] Victorious any day
[1:27:51] that's where you need the Jubilee
[1:27:53] trumpet amen that's why you need it is
[1:27:56] because you're bound you're Shackled
[1:27:58] you're held up by things the question is
[1:28:00] not do you have the Holy Ghost the
[1:28:01] question is are you overcoming
[1:28:05] are you Victorious
[1:28:07] so the question is are you battling
[1:28:10] because if you're battling you'll get
[1:28:12] the victory
[1:28:14] if you're battling but if you're just
[1:28:16] saying I'm not gonna fight it I'm okay
[1:28:17] with where it's at then you'll never get
[1:28:20] the victory because there's no battle
[1:28:21] going on you've got to fight to have the
[1:28:23] battle you've got to resist the devil
[1:28:25] remember you've got to resist him and if
[1:28:27] you're not resisting then how can you
[1:28:29] ever win a battle
[1:28:33] I said this before in the other service
[1:28:35] you'll know when you're free
[1:28:37] you'll know when you're free
[1:28:39] because you're not the way you used to
[1:28:40] be and Satan doesn't have influence in
[1:28:43] that area anymore
[1:28:45] he'll do a complete work amen
[1:28:48] we talk so big sometimes
[1:28:50] we talk so big sometimes
[1:28:53] but then when we Face Down the facts
[1:28:54] we'll realize that sometimes all we've
[1:28:56] got is a slightly longer chain
[1:28:58] so we can walk a little bit further down
[1:29:00] the road and then what do we do we come
[1:29:02] up short again and again and again we
[1:29:04] can't keep going because the shackles
[1:29:06] aren't broken all satan does is he gives
[1:29:08] you a little bit more room it gives you
[1:29:10] a little bit more time between your
[1:29:11] addiction failures it gives you a bit
[1:29:14] more time before you run back to this
[1:29:15] run back to that before you fall again
[1:29:17] in the same area and you and then what's
[1:29:20] he trying to do he's trying to get you
[1:29:21] to say that's good enough
[1:29:23] or he's trying to get you to pretend
[1:29:24] that you've got the victory Satan loves
[1:29:27] a pretender why Satan's a pretender
[1:29:29] Satan Satan's entire thing is about
[1:29:31] pretense he's a bluff he's about
[1:29:33] pretending he is something that he is
[1:29:35] not he's like pretending he's got power
[1:29:36] he's got Victory he's got to influence
[1:29:38] all these things and Satan is a bluff
[1:29:40] through and through so he loves a person
[1:29:42] that's a bluff because they fit right in
[1:29:43] with his army
[1:29:45] Satan loves pretended Brothers pretended
[1:29:47] Christians that think they've got it the
[1:29:49] question is when you come up and he's
[1:29:51] giving you a bit more chain will you
[1:29:52] come up against it and say good enough
[1:29:54] or will you say no no no I'm not free I
[1:29:57] got to go back and I got to hear that
[1:29:58] gospel Trump at another time
[1:30:01] brother Graham says see the trumpet
[1:30:03] sounded and he can go free it's God's
[1:30:05] grace it's the Year of Jubilee listen he
[1:30:08] says the completion
[1:30:11] the finished work in that area like I
[1:30:13] said you'll know when it's done because
[1:30:15] you won't face that battle again you'll
[1:30:18] face the battle Satan will come back but
[1:30:20] that Victory will come easier and easier
[1:30:22] and easier and you'll turn them down
[1:30:23] flat and you'll turn them down flat and
[1:30:25] you'll turn them down flat until he just
[1:30:26] stops doing it
[1:30:28] he says the day of sin is over brother
[1:30:31] I'm not talking about morality
[1:30:34] I'm talking about victory
[1:30:36] where Satan is impossibly
[1:30:40] it's impossible for him to get into your
[1:30:42] life in these areas
[1:30:43] bit by bit we're pushing him back
[1:30:46] and when he's out you close the door and
[1:30:48] you lock it
[1:30:49] and then you move to the next one and
[1:30:50] you move to the next one we're just
[1:30:51] cleaning house that's all God's doing
[1:30:53] amen
[1:30:54] he says I'll tell every one of you
[1:30:56] serving sin he says taper visible
[1:30:58] audience let's say internet or visible
[1:30:59] audience everyone that's serving sin the
[1:31:02] day of sin is over Jesus died and you
[1:31:04] don't have to serve sin no more he who
[1:31:07] the son has made free is free indeed if
[1:31:09] you want to go free
[1:31:11] and be free in the sun Cut Loose from
[1:31:14] all things and serve him come on but if
[1:31:17] you don't want to then your organization
[1:31:18] your master whoever you're serving
[1:31:22] notice he says whoever not whatever
[1:31:24] because it's always an influence isn't
[1:31:26] it it's Christ and then it's everything
[1:31:28] else is satanic whoever you're serving
[1:31:30] will put a mark on your ear and you
[1:31:32] won't be able to hear it anymore if God
[1:31:34] ever speaks to Your Heart come this is
[1:31:37] the time and you refuse it then you
[1:31:40] receive his Mark you're hardened from
[1:31:42] the truth he says and that's the Seal of
[1:31:44] the devil the mark of the beast
[1:31:49] there's a reason why I'm open behind
[1:31:51] this Pulpit with the things that I've
[1:31:52] struggled with as a young man and even
[1:31:54] as a as an older man
[1:31:56] because we're supposed to be able to
[1:31:58] show that there is a reality in this
[1:32:00] life amen that there is something that
[1:32:02] this word does that there is something
[1:32:04] that it means to live in the presence
[1:32:05] and power of the Holy Spirit In Our
[1:32:07] Lives amen especially when it comes to
[1:32:09] the young man I can't identify with the
[1:32:10] young women in the same way but I know
[1:32:12] I'm in that generation where where
[1:32:13] technology really started to come in so
[1:32:16] I know what it's like to deal with
[1:32:17] addictions to technology I know what
[1:32:18] it's like to have access to things that
[1:32:20] our parents never even dreamed of ever
[1:32:22] having access to I know what's out there
[1:32:24] in the schools I know what's out there
[1:32:26] with with drugs and all these different
[1:32:28] things I know what it's like now most of
[1:32:30] it I haven't had to deal with but I know
[1:32:31] what's out there and I know that I've
[1:32:34] had to deal with it and I know that I've
[1:32:35] had to overcome it and I didn't overcome
[1:32:36] it by programs
[1:32:38] I didn't just overcome it by sitting in
[1:32:40] church and nodding my head but I
[1:32:41] overcame it by the Holy Spirit working
[1:32:43] in my life personally and individually
[1:32:46] to take these things out of my life and
[1:32:48] give me the victory over it so that when
[1:32:49] Satan comes now it's just not interested
[1:32:51] not interested not interested not
[1:32:54] interested not interested not interested
[1:32:56] guess what he doesn't do it anymore
[1:32:59] he gives up after a while usually
[1:33:01] amen
[1:33:03] but we want to come to the place where
[1:33:05] we can not just talk about it but we can
[1:33:07] say what he did for me he can do for you
[1:33:10] let's not preach at our young people
[1:33:12] without the experience that we're
[1:33:13] expecting them to have amen let's have
[1:33:14] it make sure we've got it so we can
[1:33:16] deliver it to them as well y'all reminds
[1:33:18] me of Peter Peter's so human
[1:33:21] 's Peter's as human as they come you
[1:33:23] know what Peter was a blow herd
[1:33:25] Before Peter ever got converted Peter
[1:33:28] was a blowhard remember he's always
[1:33:29] y'all do this I'll do that they come
[1:33:32] after you I'm going to do this I'm going
[1:33:33] to do that I always carry a sword
[1:33:35] right Peter was all Bluster and Bluff
[1:33:38] that's what he was
[1:33:40] and then what happened was when the time
[1:33:42] came for him to be tested what happened
[1:33:43] he failed miserably and ran just like
[1:33:46] the rest of them amen
[1:33:47] and Jesus said to him Peter when you're
[1:33:49] converted strengthen your brethren I
[1:33:51] want to read that scripture because it
[1:33:52] it's so so special to me
[1:33:55] and the Lord says Simon Simon behold
[1:33:57] Satan had desired to have you that he
[1:33:59] may sift you as wheat he's talking about
[1:34:01] when they when they would sift the wheat
[1:34:03] they'd throw it up in the air remember
[1:34:04] and the wind would just carry away
[1:34:06] anything that was light
[1:34:07] he said Peter that's what Satan's trying
[1:34:09] to do he's just going to throw you up
[1:34:10] and the wind's just going to blow you
[1:34:11] away and you're going to land wherever
[1:34:12] he wants you to he says but I have
[1:34:15] prayed for thee that thy faith fail not
[1:34:18] and when thou art converted strengthen
[1:34:21] thy brethren
[1:34:24] listen he didn't just pray for Peter
[1:34:27] he's prayed for every one of us amen
[1:34:29] we're in the mind of God he has made a
[1:34:31] way for us he knows what he wants to do
[1:34:33] with us I want to take that back to our
[1:34:35] lives because when we get the victory
[1:34:37] don't look down on somebody else that
[1:34:39] doesn't have the victory
[1:34:40] right
[1:34:41] but when you've got strength when you've
[1:34:44] got Victory go help somebody that needs
[1:34:46] the victory let's not just sit here in
[1:34:48] our white Thrones in our houses amen
[1:34:50] looking down our noses at the brother or
[1:34:52] sister that's struggling long life let's
[1:34:54] get down there and help them along let's
[1:34:56] get down there and push them along and
[1:34:59] Peter listen to this
[1:35:01] he said he said unto him Lord I am ready
[1:35:03] to go with thee both to prison and to
[1:35:06] death
[1:35:08] yeah
[1:35:11] the grace of Jesus
[1:35:13] to not laugh
[1:35:14] at the silliness that we say sometimes
[1:35:18] because he knows what's going to happen
[1:35:22] now he says Peter I tell thee the
[1:35:25] shall not Crow this day before Thou
[1:35:26] shalt Thrice deny that thou knowest me
[1:35:30] Peter's like I'm ready to go to prison
[1:35:31] I'll Die For You Lord
[1:35:35] Jesus says the day won't be over but
[1:35:37] you'll deny me Thrice he didn't just
[1:35:38] deny him Thrice he cursed
[1:35:40] he cursed
[1:35:42] he went back to his old base nature why
[1:35:44] because he never had a new birth
[1:35:47] heard a brother tell me the other day he
[1:35:48] said I cursed but not out loud I cursed
[1:35:50] in my head
[1:35:54] his brother
[1:35:56] sometimes life gets us there where we
[1:35:58] want to do those things
[1:36:00] what's Jesus saying he's saying Peter
[1:36:02] great attitude buddy
[1:36:04] but you don't got what you think you've
[1:36:06] got yet
[1:36:07] Peter you're a good talker but there's
[1:36:09] going to come a day where you're going
[1:36:10] to do more than talk Peter
[1:36:12] you're going to have what you think you
[1:36:14] have right now today
[1:36:15] man it's not insane the words that were
[1:36:17] proven today
[1:36:19] it's in doing the words and then when we
[1:36:22] can live it not just talk about it
[1:36:23] that's when we know we've got the real
[1:36:25] Goods amen we need to have a mouth that
[1:36:27] speaks the word
[1:36:29] and we talked a lot about speak the word
[1:36:31] in the last last few months I know but
[1:36:33] when it comes to speak the word the
[1:36:34] first thing we start off is not to say
[1:36:36] this is what's going to happen or this
[1:36:38] is what's going to happen but I'm
[1:36:40] talking about speak the word that says
[1:36:41] this is what God says about my situation
[1:36:44] when we're sick then we say by his
[1:36:46] stripes we are healed that is what we
[1:36:49] first start with is what the word says
[1:36:51] about it and then what happens after
[1:36:52] that is that God honors his word and
[1:36:54] brings it to pass in your life but the
[1:36:56] first thing that ought to come into our
[1:36:57] mouths when we go into a situation is
[1:36:59] what does the word say and let us speak
[1:37:01] that let us speak what we're supposed to
[1:37:03] do how we're supposed to act
[1:37:05] what's supposed to happen do we need a
[1:37:08] promise do we need healing do we need
[1:37:09] Deliverance do we need provision do we
[1:37:11] need direction what does the word say
[1:37:13] about it and then you go in and you
[1:37:15] write it down and you read it out and
[1:37:16] you say Lord this is what your word says
[1:37:18] and let that be the first thing that you
[1:37:20] do is confess what he said about it in
[1:37:22] the first place and then watch him go to
[1:37:24] work remember our words matter
[1:37:27] our words definitely matter Paul said
[1:37:28] this in Romans 10 he says that if Thou
[1:37:30] shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
[1:37:32] Jesus
[1:37:33] but don't stop there and that shalt
[1:37:36] believe in thine heart that God hath
[1:37:38] raised him from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:37:39] saved for with the heart man believes
[1:37:42] unto righteousness and with the mouth
[1:37:44] confession is made unto salvation
[1:37:48] but we have to get past just talking
[1:37:51] we have to move past just speaking
[1:37:54] we have to move past just saying amen
[1:37:56] and saying Lord let it happen in me
[1:37:59] let it come into my life let it be as
[1:38:02] I've read your word as I've spoken your
[1:38:04] word Lord now may it be released to go
[1:38:06] into my life and do what you said it is
[1:38:08] supposed to do in the first place we've
[1:38:10] said it before in the last few services
[1:38:11] but the revealing of the word is not for
[1:38:13] revelation's sake only but it's for
[1:38:15] manifestation's sake when God reveals
[1:38:18] that something is yours in the word
[1:38:19] that's the Revelation and what has to
[1:38:21] come after that is manifestation in his
[1:38:24] time not in your time but it's got to
[1:38:26] come out of it amen it's always leading
[1:38:28] this this Redemption process that we're
[1:38:30] going through is to bring us to a
[1:38:31] manifestation
[1:38:34] not just a revelation but a
[1:38:36] manifestation of the sons and the
[1:38:38] daughters of God Amen Peter was so human
[1:38:40] and when it mattered most he shrunk away
[1:38:42] and he hid and he ran with the others he
[1:38:44] was no more Brave than the others
[1:38:46] chopped the guy's ear off and then ran
[1:38:48] that's it didn't do a lot of good did he
[1:38:50] made a mess Jesus had to do one more
[1:38:52] Miracle before they killed him
[1:38:54] right that's all Peter did he was
[1:38:56] constantly messing up like I said then
[1:38:58] he went back and he cursed and then
[1:39:01] what did he do after that then he went
[1:39:02] back to fishing naked on the boat
[1:39:06] talk about a low point
[1:39:09] we're talking about a Jubilee Church
[1:39:11] Peter hit rock bottom because Peter used
[1:39:14] to be a nothing
[1:39:16] and then Jesus made him a something and
[1:39:18] then he fell
[1:39:20] that's tough to take it's tough when we
[1:39:22] fail it's tough when we mess up it it's
[1:39:24] tough when we get caught up in ourselves
[1:39:26] and Peter got caught up in himself and
[1:39:28] he thought he was something special and
[1:39:29] he was something special
[1:39:31] but not in and of himself
[1:39:33] it was something that God was going to
[1:39:35] have to do in his life amen but Christ
[1:39:37] had prayed for him that's the beauty of
[1:39:39] it and he says Peter there's going to
[1:39:41] come a day where you're going to be
[1:39:42] strong and when you get strong now
[1:39:43] strengthen your brethren
[1:39:47] Jesus continues this conversation we'll
[1:39:49] read it out of John he says so when they
[1:39:50] had dined Jesus said Jesus say it to
[1:39:53] Peter Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas
[1:39:56] love us thou me more than these he saith
[1:39:59] unto him yea Lord thou knowest that I
[1:40:01] love thee he saith unto him feed my
[1:40:03] Lambs
[1:40:04] now when did Peter feed the Lambs Acts
[1:40:06] 2.
[1:40:07] because what it was newborns it was
[1:40:10] people that didn't know anything people
[1:40:11] that didn't have anything people that
[1:40:13] needed help people that needed
[1:40:14] instruction people that needed all the
[1:40:16] things that Peter was going to do amen
[1:40:18] and that's why today we have services
[1:40:21] that are focused more on the youth
[1:40:24] and we send them to youth camps or we
[1:40:25] have youth camps or we have a special
[1:40:27] speaker or we take a service maybe on
[1:40:29] something we would consider more the
[1:40:30] basics is because we have to feed the
[1:40:33] Lambs we've got Lambs that have to grow
[1:40:35] into sheep
[1:40:37] so we can sit there and resent and I
[1:40:38] know we don't I know we don't but I'm
[1:40:40] explaining sometimes the things you
[1:40:42] think brother John it's really simple
[1:40:43] what you're preaching today yes because
[1:40:44] we've got Lambs amongst us
[1:40:46] listen a seven-year-old isn't going to
[1:40:48] understand the way a 50 or 60 or 70 year
[1:40:50] old does we've got to feed the Lambs
[1:40:52] sometimes amen
[1:40:53] but then he said to him again the second
[1:40:55] time Simon son of Jonas love assami he
[1:40:58] saith unto him yea Lord thou knowest
[1:41:00] that I love thee he saith unto him feed
[1:41:02] my sheep so he says when the Lambs have
[1:41:04] become sheep feed them and guess what
[1:41:07] you don't feed Lambs the way you feed
[1:41:08] sheep there's a different diet isn't
[1:41:10] there
[1:41:11] but Peter you got to move on with your
[1:41:13] ministry too Peter had to grow too
[1:41:16] and he saith unto them the third time
[1:41:18] Simon son of Jonas love assami Peter was
[1:41:21] grieved because he said unto him the
[1:41:23] third time lover saw me and he said unto
[1:41:25] him Lord thou knowest all things thou
[1:41:27] knowest I love thee Jesus Jesus saith
[1:41:30] unto him feed my sheep
[1:41:33] I think I already said that why'd he say
[1:41:34] don't stop
[1:41:36] don't stop feeding them because they
[1:41:38] can't stop feeding sheep have to keep
[1:41:40] feeding
[1:41:41] the older you get the more mature you
[1:41:43] get you still have to keep feeding
[1:41:44] you're going to need it all the way to
[1:41:46] the end amen don't hold back amen if
[1:41:48] you're a full-grown mature believer
[1:41:49] you've got to keep progressing in Christ
[1:41:51] and it's not just all up here head
[1:41:53] knowledge in the opening of the word
[1:41:54] it's got to be through your life because
[1:41:56] you are an example to those following
[1:41:58] behind of what a mature believer is
[1:41:59] supposed to be looking like the
[1:42:01] priorities they have in their life the
[1:42:03] victories they're supposed to have in
[1:42:04] their life where their decisions take
[1:42:06] them you're the fruit of what's coming
[1:42:07] behind you you think about it
[1:42:10] you're the proof of what they believe
[1:42:12] and what it will produce
[1:42:14] so you got to keep progressing you can't
[1:42:16] stop you can't stop I'm so thankful for
[1:42:18] the older folks here you haven't stopped
[1:42:20] as you come into retirement as you get
[1:42:22] older and you get more tired you haven't
[1:42:23] stopped serving you haven't stopped
[1:42:25] doing those things and it's not wrong if
[1:42:27] you stop serving but you're continuing
[1:42:28] to help in the church and you're
[1:42:30] continuing to lead and you're continuing
[1:42:31] to grow and you're not resting on your
[1:42:33] laurels and thank God for it thank God
[1:42:35] for it
[1:42:36] we need that but don't stop keep feeding
[1:42:39] keep pressing because we all got to get
[1:42:41] out of here and we got to get everybody
[1:42:43] up to mature Sheep amen
[1:42:45] we look at Peter here and he's getting
[1:42:47] frustrated Lord you know I love you you
[1:42:49] know I love you
[1:42:51] I Think Jesus was drilling it into him
[1:42:54] make sure you do
[1:42:55] and when you when you come to the place
[1:42:57] I've told you about make sure you
[1:42:58] remember these words Peter you got to
[1:43:00] feed the little ones and then you got to
[1:43:01] feed the big ones that are coming after
[1:43:03] it but look at what happened to Peter
[1:43:05] after on the day of Pentecost we talked
[1:43:07] about it last service he tried to start
[1:43:08] a denomination up there he tried to take
[1:43:11] men's knowledge and men's understanding
[1:43:12] and they drew lots to get another
[1:43:13] apostle
[1:43:15] and he literally would have started on
[1:43:17] the wrong foot and he literally did
[1:43:18] start on the wrong foot but then the
[1:43:20] Holy Ghost fell and what happened to
[1:43:21] Peter all of a sudden Peter had what he
[1:43:24] thought he'd had all along
[1:43:25] the things that Peter talked about the
[1:43:27] attitude he displayed the the strength
[1:43:29] of bravado all of a sudden now Peter had
[1:43:31] a reality behind him so that when things
[1:43:34] got tough when the politicians came
[1:43:36] after him when the ministry came after
[1:43:37] him when the people turned against him
[1:43:39] Peter didn't run away Peter stood there
[1:43:41] and he stood on the word and he stood
[1:43:43] according to the gospel call that Christ
[1:43:45] had put in his life and he did what God
[1:43:46] had told him to do all along
[1:43:48] he was finally bold
[1:43:50] in the time of trial
[1:43:52] he could stand up against people that
[1:43:55] disagreed with him Fearless
[1:43:58] that doesn't mean Peter never had a
[1:43:59] struggle or a fight
[1:44:00] but he was bold in the faith and not
[1:44:02] just in preaching but in signs and
[1:44:04] wonders
[1:44:05] prophet of God says they said the same
[1:44:07] thing about Peter and John said they
[1:44:08] were ignorant and unlearn of men
[1:44:11] but they had power Hallelujah to make a
[1:44:14] Layman leap like a heart they opened the
[1:44:17] eyes of the blind they unstopped the
[1:44:19] ears of the death because they were
[1:44:21] preaching the Jubilee year remember
[1:44:23] preaching is not just teaching it's
[1:44:25] doing
[1:44:27] that's what preaching is it's not just
[1:44:29] talking it's doing
[1:44:30] he says they were doing not just talking
[1:44:32] about it he says thanks be to God for
[1:44:35] the same Holy Spirit that's why I said
[1:44:37] you'll know when you're free
[1:44:39] Peter kept falling down
[1:44:41] falling down falling down going back to
[1:44:44] the old thing going back to the old
[1:44:45] thing going back to the old way going
[1:44:47] back to what he thought he could do best
[1:44:48] listen it's amazing because remember he
[1:44:51] went out preaching he went out uh
[1:44:53] fishing and they they fished all night
[1:44:55] and they said where are you going Peter
[1:44:57] says I'm going fishing they said we're
[1:44:58] coming with you they went out on the
[1:44:59] boat and they caught nothing
[1:45:01] he was no good even at what he used to
[1:45:03] do
[1:45:04] talk about a low point you've gone back
[1:45:06] to what you used to be good at and
[1:45:07] you're no good at that anymore
[1:45:09] and then Jesus comes along and he says
[1:45:12] lower your net on the other side
[1:45:14] and the scripture says they lowered it
[1:45:15] and it's like they did the first time
[1:45:17] they had 153 large great fishes the
[1:45:20] scripture says I just read in devotions
[1:45:21] the other day great fishes that they had
[1:45:23] and they drag it in there and Peter just
[1:45:25] comes running along and the rest of them
[1:45:26] bring the boat in and he recognizes that
[1:45:28] it's the Lord there but even then he
[1:45:30] needed God to bless him in the old
[1:45:31] things
[1:45:32] couldn't do it he was no good anymore
[1:45:39] what did Peter do when things got tough
[1:45:41] things got tough real quick on Peter
[1:45:42] didn't he
[1:45:44] Peter goes out and it's all noise to
[1:45:45] Broad and he preaches and all of a
[1:45:47] sudden they have a brand new church 3
[1:45:49] 000 people joined up to it and
[1:45:51] immediately the ministry goes after him
[1:45:52] remember they call him before the the
[1:45:55] the council and they they threaten them
[1:45:57] and they do all these things they say if
[1:45:58] you do it you're gonna pay
[1:46:01] so what did Peter do do they stand up
[1:46:02] there and beat his chest I have the keys
[1:46:05] to the kingdom of God I'm filled with
[1:46:06] the spirit you can't do nothing to me
[1:46:09] no
[1:46:11] Peter was struggling with that
[1:46:15] Peter wasn't sure how to move forward
[1:46:17] this is just a couple days after the
[1:46:19] initial filling of the Holy Spirit after
[1:46:21] the day of Pentecost something that had
[1:46:23] never been experienced and I've talked
[1:46:24] about this before I know but I want to
[1:46:25] drive it home
[1:46:26] Peter went and he had a talk with the
[1:46:29] people
[1:46:30] and they had a prayer meeting
[1:46:32] Peter wasn't too proud to say this is
[1:46:35] going to get rough
[1:46:37] and I need more than I've got right now
[1:46:38] guys
[1:46:40] if we read about it in Acts 4 it says no
[1:46:42] and now Lord they're praying now they're
[1:46:44] not they're praying to God and they're
[1:46:46] saying now Lord behold they're
[1:46:47] threatenings
[1:46:48] Lord you see what they've told us is
[1:46:50] going to happen if we continue to preach
[1:46:51] this gospel and Grant unto thy servants
[1:46:54] that with all boldness they may speak
[1:46:57] Thy Word by stretching forth thine hand
[1:47:00] to heal and that signs and wonders may
[1:47:02] be done by the name of thy holy Child
[1:47:04] Jesus
[1:47:05] now listen to this and when they have
[1:47:07] prayed the place was shaken where they
[1:47:10] were assembled together and they were
[1:47:12] all filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:47:14] spake the word of God with boldness
[1:47:17] Peter said Lord I need more
[1:47:19] I need more of you
[1:47:21] I'm scared I'm worried I don't want to
[1:47:25] die
[1:47:27] this is going to be difficult
[1:47:29] and I don't like difficult anybody else
[1:47:32] doesn't like difficult
[1:47:33] I don't like difficult it's not wrong to
[1:47:36] say it's going to be difficult and you
[1:47:37] don't like it but what are you going to
[1:47:39] do when the battle rages are you going
[1:47:40] to come back and say Lord I need more
[1:47:42] are you going to sit there and say no
[1:47:44] I'll do it with what I've got
[1:47:46] go back and get more because more is
[1:47:47] available
[1:47:48] there's way more than we have today
[1:47:50] Church there's way more out there
[1:47:52] waiting for us all he's looking for is
[1:47:54] somebody else say I need more I need
[1:47:56] more I want more
[1:47:57] it says in the multitude of them that
[1:47:59] believe were of one heart and of one
[1:48:01] Soul neither said any of them ought of
[1:48:04] the things which he possessed was his
[1:48:05] own but they had all things in common
[1:48:07] and with great power gave the apostles
[1:48:09] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:48:11] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[1:48:15] listen you think Grace is great great
[1:48:18] grace is greater than Grace
[1:48:20] I want great grace in my life amen
[1:48:23] and listen when they're pulled in front
[1:48:24] of the priest they said listen we can
[1:48:26] only say the things that we have seen
[1:48:28] and heard
[1:48:29] we're only telling you what we
[1:48:31] experience
[1:48:32] that's what a testimony is church a
[1:48:35] testimony is not just preaching the word
[1:48:37] but the testimony is is what we've seen
[1:48:40] what we've experienced the reality in
[1:48:42] our lives that's what we're talking
[1:48:44] about priests and so that's all we're
[1:48:46] going to keep preaching we're going to
[1:48:47] preach the reality of Jesus Christ
[1:48:48] inside of our Lives not just what we've
[1:48:50] heard but what we've seen and what has
[1:48:52] been made manifest in our lives amen
[1:48:55] I said you can tell us to stop preaching
[1:48:57] but where you have to do it there's
[1:48:59] something inside of us that's compelling
[1:49:00] to keep preaching this gospel
[1:49:03] and they were the living proof they were
[1:49:05] the proof and how many of them died over
[1:49:07] the next 15 years just one after another
[1:49:09] they killed them and killed them and
[1:49:11] killed them because they were showing a
[1:49:12] living Christ and they couldn't have
[1:49:13] that
[1:49:14] they couldn't have that in the world
[1:49:15] they didn't want it
[1:49:17] brother Brown said this and we're coming
[1:49:18] to a close
[1:49:20] he says today that men and women in our
[1:49:22] country and everywhere else has sold
[1:49:24] themselves out to sin drinkling drinking
[1:49:28] gambling carousing that doesn't really
[1:49:30] apply to us does it I don't think so
[1:49:33] gambling you might not so much in this
[1:49:35] church but there's some that might be
[1:49:37] coming in in some places but really
[1:49:38] drinking and carousing is not generally
[1:49:40] known A month's a message
[1:49:42] I mean it's real it's professing
[1:49:44] Christians it's not generally there but
[1:49:45] then brother Brown says doing things
[1:49:47] that they ought not to do and become
[1:49:49] slaves to the devil
[1:49:51] he says I met a young lady here not long
[1:49:53] ago she said brother Branham I give
[1:49:55] anything if I could only break this band
[1:49:58] of whiskey put yourself there this
[1:50:00] morning
[1:50:02] she said I started when I was a little
[1:50:04] girl went with a boy that drank we
[1:50:05] started mixing drinks and I become a
[1:50:08] perfect slave to it she says if I don't
[1:50:10] have it she says I just go wild
[1:50:14] if I could only get rid of this
[1:50:17] I said you can't do it yourself but I
[1:50:20] know someone who can break it for you
[1:50:21] the Lord Jesus Christ has come to make
[1:50:25] you free
[1:50:26] listen being raised in a Christian home
[1:50:28] being raised in a message home does not
[1:50:30] Shield you from Satan
[1:50:33] he knows where to find you
[1:50:35] he knows exactly where to find you all
[1:50:36] he has to go is follow us home from
[1:50:38] church one day and he knows where every
[1:50:39] one of us lives and he knows who he
[1:50:41] wants to Target because chances are
[1:50:42] those are going to be the children of
[1:50:43] God
[1:50:44] technology has made anything accessible
[1:50:47] to us today we can get involved and
[1:50:49] hooked on just about anything by
[1:50:52] technology
[1:50:53] you don't have to go out of your house
[1:50:54] to do the very same to get in the same
[1:50:56] trouble that drinking will get you into
[1:50:58] or drugs or anything you can get as
[1:51:00] addicted through technology as you can
[1:51:01] through any of these physical things
[1:51:03] amen
[1:51:04] he says now if you'll notice in symbol
[1:51:06] that Jubilee year repeats now again
[1:51:08] every so often there's a Revival strikes
[1:51:11] the land the Welsh great Welsh Revival
[1:51:13] it closed not long ago we might go and
[1:51:15] have Billy grahams and Nora Roberts all
[1:51:17] over the land everywhere might bring
[1:51:18] special ministers in and everything goes
[1:51:20] really well and we're all that's what
[1:51:22] he's talking about
[1:51:23] and no matter how much we try how great
[1:51:26] we try to organize our people together
[1:51:28] and ban them it takes God to bring a
[1:51:31] Revival
[1:51:33] but notice what brought Jubilee
[1:51:36] to the children of Israel they cried out
[1:51:40] they cried out
[1:51:42] I'm not saying you have to be cried out
[1:51:43] for a Revival
[1:51:45] I'm saying you need to cry out for the
[1:51:46] things of God to get the things of God
[1:51:50] he says that's what America needs
[1:51:51] tonight that's what Canada needs tonight
[1:51:53] that's what Newfoundland needs tonight
[1:51:54] that's what St John's needs tonight it
[1:51:56] doesn't need a Billy Graham nor does it
[1:51:58] need an Oral Roberts what it needs
[1:52:00] tonight is the holy spirit moving
[1:52:02] amongst the people claiming the year of
[1:52:05] Freedom that's right doesn't need a new
[1:52:07] organization doesn't need a new setup
[1:52:09] the only thing it needs is the Holy
[1:52:11] Spirit to come in convicting power you
[1:52:14] could preach the gospel till you turn
[1:52:16] gray you could work signs and wonders
[1:52:18] till you turn gray except God gets out
[1:52:20] amongst the people and goes to movie
[1:52:24] he says what it needs tonight is not a
[1:52:26] new preacher what it needs is the Holy
[1:52:29] Spirit Get Out amongst the people go to
[1:52:31] stirring them up hungering and thirsting
[1:52:33] for righteousness sake
[1:52:36] he quotes the scripture blessed are they
[1:52:37] when they hunger and thirst for
[1:52:39] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:52:41] whatever it is he says it takes the Holy
[1:52:44] Spirit to do it
[1:52:46] now in these days he's pointing back to
[1:52:47] the the days of Israel in the Jubilee
[1:52:49] they take the man out there and maybe
[1:52:51] hoeing in the cornfield the master
[1:52:53] walking down whipping him with the whip
[1:52:54] hurry up there gotta hurry up with this
[1:52:56] but just as soon as that trumpet sounded
[1:52:59] that man could throw that hoe down and
[1:53:00] say I won't hoe with it no more
[1:53:05] sometimes the problem is we don't throw
[1:53:07] the hoe down
[1:53:10] and that Taskmaster that slave driver
[1:53:13] was forbidden to touch him anymore
[1:53:14] because he was free why he had heard the
[1:53:18] good news that's all he had to do was
[1:53:19] hear it and act on it the Jubilee was on
[1:53:22] the atonement was made and all the
[1:53:25] slaves could go free
[1:53:26] he says I remember myself oh my when I
[1:53:29] heard that good news come to my heart as
[1:53:31] a little old sinner boy laying there on
[1:53:33] the hospital bed the doctor said you got
[1:53:35] three more minutes to live I heard a
[1:53:38] sound from heaven and that told me
[1:53:39] Jubilee year was on I accepted the Lord
[1:53:42] Jesus turned loose all the shackles of
[1:53:44] sin and said to the devil you can't do
[1:53:46] me any more harm because I give my life
[1:53:49] to Christ Jesus and you can't whip me
[1:53:51] anymore more
[1:53:53] since then he's bluffed me lots of times
[1:53:57] the battle never ends
[1:53:59] but he's not been able to touch me since
[1:54:02] because he's just a bluff I can hear his
[1:54:04] whip cracking and popping and so forth
[1:54:06] but it don't do no good because he can't
[1:54:09] get me because I belong to the Lord now
[1:54:11] that's right
[1:54:13] what does a bluff look like church
[1:54:14] what'd he say he says I can hear the
[1:54:16] whip popping and cracking
[1:54:18] trying to get you to obey
[1:54:21] what that Whip's trying to make you do
[1:54:23] trying to force you in a direction that
[1:54:26] the word says you ought not to go trying
[1:54:28] to drive you back to the land you were
[1:54:30] on rather than keep you moving towards
[1:54:31] the land that you're supposed to possess
[1:54:33] amen what does a bluff look like a show
[1:54:35] of force
[1:54:37] legitimacy
[1:54:38] I have a right to be here you know how
[1:54:41] Satan does that he says because you did
[1:54:43] this I have a right to be here
[1:54:45] you may have done that but the blood
[1:54:47] says you don't and so he has no right
[1:54:49] once you repent he has no right to be
[1:54:51] there
[1:54:52] that's it he makes you think because of
[1:54:55] what you did he has a right to be in
[1:54:56] your life you say no no no no that's
[1:54:58] under the blood now so you've got to go
[1:55:00] you gotta go Hallelujah that's what a
[1:55:03] bluff looks like so often he turns it
[1:55:05] back on us and makes us think that our
[1:55:06] actions give him the right to be in our
[1:55:08] life it does until you put it under the
[1:55:11] blood because you open the door you open
[1:55:13] the door our actions open the door but
[1:55:16] when we shut the door
[1:55:18] then he's got to go
[1:55:20] but you got to make sure that door's
[1:55:21] shut
[1:55:22] you got to make sure that you want him
[1:55:23] out
[1:55:24] you got to make sure that you're not
[1:55:26] holding that hoe still
[1:55:30] otherwise what happens is Satan's
[1:55:32] waiting on the other end of the road
[1:55:33] listen once you get out of his clutches
[1:55:35] then what he does is he moves right over
[1:55:36] and he starts to camp on your land
[1:55:38] so that when you get to the end of your
[1:55:40] journey and it's time for you to take
[1:55:41] possession now you got to fight to get
[1:55:43] him off because he can't influence you
[1:55:44] back where he was so now he comes to
[1:55:46] where you are and tries to pretend that
[1:55:47] he's supposed to be there as well
[1:55:49] brother Brown says this Satan is a
[1:55:51] squatter he doesn't legally own this now
[1:55:53] brother I'm speaking in this case about
[1:55:55] the Lamb's Book of Life which is the
[1:55:56] title deed of redemption he said and
[1:55:58] he's had 2 000 years of fuss whether he
[1:56:00] owns it or somebody else owns it but
[1:56:02] Christ came as a Kinsmen Redeemer and
[1:56:04] redeemed it back to us but Satan
[1:56:06] possesses it
[1:56:08] Satan possesses it he doesn't possess it
[1:56:10] he thinks he possesses it he acts like
[1:56:11] he possesses it but he says after a
[1:56:13] while this great fight's over he'll be
[1:56:15] cast into the Lake of Fire sea he'll be
[1:56:17] done away with and all them who worships
[1:56:19] with him but The Heirs of Salvation will
[1:56:22] come with Christ
[1:56:23] now he's a squatter now remember in the
[1:56:26] Old Testament if a man lost his
[1:56:28] inheritance and a squatter come on his
[1:56:29] land he could not hold it any longer for
[1:56:32] annihilation from the owner until 50
[1:56:34] years
[1:56:35] after 50 years the Year of Jubilee came
[1:56:37] by and the Year of Jubilee when the Year
[1:56:40] of Jubilee came along then everything
[1:56:42] went back to its original
[1:56:44] beginning again so we keep talking
[1:56:47] ownership
[1:56:49] talking ownership the prophet says comes
[1:56:51] back to its original beginning
[1:56:54] origin is Destiny
[1:56:56] you're coming back not just to where you
[1:56:59] belong you're coming back to what you
[1:57:01] are
[1:57:03] you're not just coming into possession
[1:57:04] to have the blessings and the authority
[1:57:06] of God but you're coming back into
[1:57:07] position now as a true son and daughter
[1:57:09] of God fully manifested in total
[1:57:11] relationship with Christ as his bride
[1:57:13] you're coming back to original beginning
[1:57:15] beginning is not when he wrote it
[1:57:17] beginning is in the mind of God
[1:57:19] you're coming back to your position in
[1:57:22] the mind of God that's what this whole
[1:57:23] Redemption plan is to bring you back to
[1:57:24] what you were before he even spoke it
[1:57:27] out loud before he ever wrote it in a
[1:57:28] word for us to read he says it's coming
[1:57:30] back to its original beginning again all
[1:57:34] slaves they went back to the original
[1:57:35] beginning if a man was hoeing in the
[1:57:37] field and the trumpet sounded and he
[1:57:39] heard it he'd throw down the hoe and say
[1:57:40] I'm no more a slave I go back home to my
[1:57:44] family
[1:57:45] everything was given back
[1:57:48] everything was given back
[1:57:51] if a squatter was on the ground he had
[1:57:53] to get off the ground that's all he got
[1:57:56] off the ground because why the legal
[1:57:58] owner was coming back and he had to give
[1:58:01] way
[1:58:03] Hallelujah one of these days the
[1:58:05] kingdoms of this world will fall and the
[1:58:07] legal owners will come in one of these
[1:58:09] days he says amen can you imagine
[1:58:13] being in Egypt and it's that final night
[1:58:17] Moses is given the word he's told you to
[1:58:20] kill the lamb he's told you to put the
[1:58:23] blood on the door he's told you to eat
[1:58:25] the lamb to eat the unleavened bread as
[1:58:27] we're going to do shortly to drink the
[1:58:28] wine to have the staff in your hand
[1:58:31] and you're sitting there and you're
[1:58:33] saying
[1:58:34] how's this going to work
[1:58:36] sometimes that's what's holding us back
[1:58:38] is we're trying to figure out how God's
[1:58:39] going to do it rather than believing
[1:58:41] he's going to do it
[1:58:42] and it holds us back especially if
[1:58:44] you're in Ops
[1:58:46] especially if you're German
[1:58:48] you want to plan it all out
[1:58:50] right
[1:58:53] Moses knew a lot about how to run an
[1:58:55] army
[1:58:56] he knew all about the supply chain
[1:58:59] he knew the difficulty of moving two
[1:59:01] million people through a desert even for
[1:59:04] a couple days
[1:59:05] you look at the the amount of water the
[1:59:07] amount of food all the things that could
[1:59:09] go wrong spare parts needed for the
[1:59:12] wagons that were inevitably going to hit
[1:59:14] a rock or go on a rock and crack an axle
[1:59:16] or break a wheel
[1:59:17] you have to have all these things if
[1:59:19] that if that if that group of people was
[1:59:21] going to be an army they'd have had an
[1:59:24] entire set of reserves there of parts
[1:59:26] and food and Extras this and that and
[1:59:28] peop everything and you're sitting there
[1:59:31] and you're trying to figure out how is
[1:59:32] God going to do it
[1:59:34] foreign he's done nine fantastic
[1:59:37] Miracles now he's about to do the tenth
[1:59:40] and he's about to pull you out
[1:59:41] and there's people sitting there saying
[1:59:44] how's God going to do this
[1:59:47] and what happens is we get caught up in
[1:59:48] trying to plan God's work for him
[1:59:50] rather than believe that he'll do it
[1:59:53] just fine
[1:59:55] that it's his work not our work
[1:59:57] and we get caught up when we get into a
[1:59:59] mind cycle where we we're sitting there
[2:00:01] and we're wondering and we're worrying
[2:00:03] about how rather than just believing it
[2:00:05] will happen
[2:00:06] and I ran across this beautiful quote
[2:00:08] and this is it for the for the service
[2:00:10] brother Brown says oh the blessedness of
[2:00:13] believing
[2:00:15] the blessedness of not trying to figure
[2:00:17] it out
[2:00:18] the blessing of just resting on God's
[2:00:21] word and say it's true and go on it's
[2:00:25] life he says it's life it's real living
[2:00:29] my dear no you say brother John that's
[2:00:32] that's for the Supernatural That's for
[2:00:33] the great things of the world and the
[2:00:36] trials we face and the great
[2:00:37] difficulties look at the Simplicity that
[2:00:39] he's about to share my dear loving old
[2:00:41] mother-in-law sitting back here I was
[2:00:43] telling her yesterday about it she said
[2:00:45] Billy I had a clock that I couldn't make
[2:00:47] it run said I just couldn't stay without
[2:00:50] that clock I didn't have money to buy me
[2:00:51] another one
[2:00:52] said I got down and said God make that
[2:00:55] clock run for me will you said she
[2:00:57] looked up and it started running and
[2:00:59] just run perfectly
[2:01:01] you say God doesn't care about the
[2:01:03] little things
[2:01:05] he made a clock run
[2:01:07] he made a clock run folks
[2:01:10] do you think he doesn't care about you
[2:01:12] you think that you can't talk to him
[2:01:13] about the smallest things
[2:01:15] if he'll make a clock run for a poor old
[2:01:18] woman
[2:01:19] he cares about what's in your life amen
[2:01:22] another one her refrigerator she said a
[2:01:25] couple days after that kept defrosting
[2:01:27] just a little spot where it would hold
[2:01:28] ice she'd done everything she could do
[2:01:31] to keep it from defrosting because she
[2:01:32] couldn't keep her butter and stuff in it
[2:01:34] Pearl thinks she's a widow her husband
[2:01:36] is in glory she got down note she didn't
[2:01:39] have money to buy another refrigerator I
[2:01:41] think sometimes the problem is we have
[2:01:42] money to do just about everything
[2:01:46] she said God will you be merciful to me
[2:01:48] again merciful to me to fix my
[2:01:52] refrigerator
[2:01:55] you know me she said start my
[2:01:58] refrigerator to freezing again will you
[2:02:00] said she got up and went and looked in
[2:02:02] her refrigerator and it was froze around
[2:02:05] froze around not working
[2:02:08] it was frozen again
[2:02:11] immediately God didn't just fix the
[2:02:14] fridge but he made it effective as if it
[2:02:16] had been working all along
[2:02:18] you talk about a restoration of the
[2:02:20] Bride tree
[2:02:21] if he can do that to a refrigerator
[2:02:23] Church what can he do to a bride of
[2:02:25] Christ that's submitted to him and
[2:02:26] calling on his name for the for the help
[2:02:28] that she needs in her life
[2:02:30] brother Robin says be simple
[2:02:33] just ask
[2:02:34] just ask
[2:02:37] we sing that song if it matters to you
[2:02:39] it matters to the master
[2:02:40] just ask
[2:02:42] don't try to figure it out
[2:02:44] don't try to study it
[2:02:49] some of us that's what we do
[2:02:51] we try and run it down through 83
[2:02:53] scriptures
[2:02:55] that's okay
[2:02:57] but don't that's not what's going to
[2:02:58] make it happen
[2:03:01] he says don't try to study it just
[2:03:03] believe it don't mentally figure it out
[2:03:06] just believe it with your soul then he
[2:03:09] goes into prayer he says our heavenly
[2:03:11] father many raise their hands this
[2:03:13] morning
[2:03:14] they want prayer
[2:03:16] do you want prayer this morning
[2:03:18] he says I pray God that this will be the
[2:03:21] final touch today they won't reason
[2:03:24] anymore
[2:03:25] they'll go believing
[2:03:27] Grant it Lord he says it's a certain
[2:03:30] sound it's the gospel sound the Glorious
[2:03:34] Jubilee year the time of Deliverance is
[2:03:38] here may God bless you let's Stand
[2:03:40] Together
[2:03:41] you notice how he says it's a certain
[2:03:43] sound
[2:03:45] not every service is for every one of us
[2:03:48] sometimes it's a certain sound for that
[2:03:49] certain one that needs it that day
[2:03:51] and there'll be something here and there
[2:03:53] I believe you can sit under the
[2:03:54] preaching of the word and you can get
[2:03:55] something from it no matter what but
[2:03:57] sometimes it's a sound for that one
[2:03:59] for that one that just needs that little
[2:04:01] that little nudge that little help that
[2:04:04] little emphasis in their their area that
[2:04:06] they're dealing with that that
[2:04:07] encouragement that they need that boost
[2:04:09] or sometimes that rebuke
[2:04:12] whatever it might be but there's a
[2:04:14] certain sound that's supposed to come
[2:04:16] forth and when you hear that sound
[2:04:17] you're supposed to say this is my day
[2:04:20] this is my time this is my hour this is
[2:04:23] my place in the holy spirit's here
[2:04:24] brother Brown says don't miss it I
[2:04:27] didn't put it up here just because I
[2:04:28] knew we didn't want to run too long but
[2:04:31] he says he says what's it trying to tell
[2:04:32] you church he says receive it receive it
[2:04:36] that's always it's all God wants us to
[2:04:39] do is receive the word he's given to us
[2:04:41] and if we receive it in a heart of faith
[2:04:44] in a ground that's prepared not just in
[2:04:47] the service but throughout the entire
[2:04:49] work then you start to watch God you
[2:04:51] start to see those plants coming up and
[2:04:53] you start to see the fruit of the spirit
[2:04:54] in your life and all of a sudden you
[2:04:55] start getting more victories and less
[2:04:57] failures
[2:04:58] not that you never fail not you don't
[2:05:00] have faults but the victories start to
[2:05:02] build up and the failures start to
[2:05:03] diminish why because the fruit of the
[2:05:05] spirit is coming out and Satan can't
[2:05:07] abide the fruit of the spirit he can't
[2:05:08] abide it when the word is living in your
[2:05:11] life and then we're trying to get it out
[2:05:13] of our heads trying to get it down into
[2:05:15] our hearts and just receive it simply
[2:05:18] how do you write
[2:05:19] was a simple woman
[2:05:22] I don't think Hattie Wright could tell
[2:05:23] you what the opening of the word was I
[2:05:25] don't think she could explain the Seven
[2:05:26] Seals but she said that ain't nothing
[2:05:29] but the truth what does she do she
[2:05:32] simply accepted it and believed it and
[2:05:34] that angel said you can have whatever
[2:05:36] you want you speak it and it'll happen
[2:05:39] right here right now
[2:05:41] and she went for something of Eternal
[2:05:42] value and I think that proved what was
[2:05:44] really in her heart in the first place
[2:05:45] was that she didn't ask for the life of
[2:05:47] her sister and she didn't ask for the
[2:05:49] millions of dollars or a life of ease
[2:05:50] but she said I want salvation for my two
[2:05:52] sons and they fell down on their knees
[2:05:54] and repented right there
[2:05:55] amen God wants us to have the things of
[2:05:58] spiritual value not just big homes
[2:06:01] not just nice cars
[2:06:03] not just a comfortable life
[2:06:05] not just money to fix our refrigerators
[2:06:07] but he wants us to live in a reality of
[2:06:09] his word doing what it says in our life
[2:06:12] every day
[2:06:13] I think there's got to be more coming
[2:06:14] there's got to be more pressure coming
[2:06:16] because we have it pretty easy today
[2:06:19] compared to so many brother Joe going to
[2:06:21] Tanzania and you you see all these the
[2:06:23] way the people live there and the
[2:06:24] churches and these different things and
[2:06:26] you say wow
[2:06:28] they got to live in a different level of
[2:06:30] faith for a lot of the things they deal
[2:06:31] with they can they don't have medicine
[2:06:33] that'll go and take care of cancer
[2:06:36] they don't have a fallback for education
[2:06:38] or or welfare these different things we
[2:06:40] have so many Nets and protections we
[2:06:42] have so many programs to keep us from
[2:06:44] failing
[2:06:45] sometimes it's that we have to fail so
[2:06:47] that we can see the need for God
[2:06:49] sometimes that's all he's doing is he's
[2:06:50] letting us fail to say there's more for
[2:06:51] you
[2:06:52] stop relying on yourself and start
[2:06:54] believing in me son Let It Go daughter

[2:23:09] Community is not

[2:23:21] cup is the New Testament in my blood
[2:23:23] this do ye as often as you drink it in
[2:23:26] remembrance of me
[2:23:35] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread

[2:23:57] not Discerning the Lord's body
[2:24:05] for if we would judge ourselves
[2:24:07] we should not be judged that's the
[2:24:09] examination of the word
[2:24:11] when the Holy Spirit comes in that's
[2:24:12] what he's talking about
[2:24:14] not looking to the brother or the sister
[2:24:16] next to us but to look in there and say

[2:40:21] to Jesus
[2:40:30] scripture says in John chapter 13
[2:40:34] says now before the Feast of the
[2:40:35] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[2:40:38] was come that he should depart out of
[2:40:39] this world unto the father
[2:40:41] having loved his own which were in the
[2:40:43] world he loved them unto the end many
[2:40:46] held nothing back
[2:40:49] and supper being ended the devil having
[2:40:51] now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot
[2:40:53] silent son to portray him Jesus knowing
[2:40:56] that the father had given all things
[2:40:57] into his hands and that he was come from
[2:40:59] God and went to God
[2:41:01] he riseth from supper and laid aside his
[2:41:03] garments and took a towel and girded
[2:41:05] himself after that he poured water into
[2:41:08] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[2:41:10] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[2:41:12] wherewith he was girded
[2:41:14] then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter
[2:41:16] saith to him Lord thus thou wash my feet
[2:41:19] Jesus answered and said unto him what I
[2:41:21] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[2:41:24] know hereafter
[2:41:26] Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never
[2:41:28] wash my feet
[2:41:29] Jesus answered him if I wash thee not
[2:41:31] thou Hast no part with me
[2:41:34] Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not only
[2:41:36] not my feet only but also my hands and
[2:41:40] my head
[2:41:41] Jesus saith to him he that is wash
[2:41:43] needeth not saved to wash his feet but
[2:41:46] is clean every wit and ye are clean but
[2:41:49] not all
[2:41:51] communions and communion is a showdown
[2:41:53] time
[2:41:55] and sometimes we walk in and maybe we
[2:41:58] don't feel so clean
[2:41:59] Jesus said you're going to get dirty
[2:42:01] walk in this world
[2:42:03] you're going to get dirty walking
[2:42:04] through life
[2:42:05] he says but he says he that's washed
[2:42:09] when you've been Washed by the Water of
[2:42:11] the world when you've been cleansed by
[2:42:12] the Holy Spirit he says people like that
[2:42:15] they only need to wash their feet he
[2:42:17] says you're clean in every way but your

[2:43:15] ye do them amen we're going to go to
[2:43:18] foot washing now so the sisters will go
[2:43:21] out the back and the brothers will stay
