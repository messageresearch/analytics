[40:45] Us by your Holy Spirit Lord God to bring

[40:59] we are a privileged this morning Lord so
[41:01] we thank you this morning Lord ask you
[41:03] to give us a greater revelation of what
[41:05] it means to be a child of God Lord that
[41:07] as we preach the word this morning Lord
[41:09] that it would Elevate our eyes Lord that
[41:12] it would build Faith Lord that it would
[41:13] put it into action Lord that the things
[41:15] that we believe will become things that

[41:46] to see you each one good to see Nadem
[41:48] back with us again amen God bless you
[41:50] each one we want to certainly remember
[41:52] the different prayer requests for little
[41:54] Noah over there in Ontario just that God
[41:56] would be with him give him a recovery
[41:59] amen that's the hardest thing I think as
[42:00] a parent is when your child is suffering
[42:02] and you don't you can't do anything you
[42:04] can't do anything except wait it out and
[42:06] trust God Amen so I know it's been tough
[42:09] on brother Doug and sister Beverly as
[42:10] the grandparents and the only Believers
[42:13] the only Believers in that situation
[42:15] amen but we trust God to work in that
[42:17] situation amen certainly appreciate that
[42:19] special this morning sister Nikki amen
[42:21] God bless you amen we want to remember
[42:23] of course brother Bob and sister Brenda
[42:25] as they travel this week to go get a
[42:26] much need a break and then God bless you
[42:29] as you go and and may He just uh
[42:31] replenish you and refresh you while
[42:32] you're away amen amen First Peter
[42:35] chapter 1 says this blessed be the God
[42:37] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[42:40] according to His abundant Mercy had
[42:42] begotten us again unto a lively hope a
[42:46] Living Hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[42:49] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[42:51] Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[42:54] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[42:57] for
[43:00] you Peter's trying to lift our
[43:03] eyes because Peter's talking to people
[43:05] that are dealing with real life amen I
[43:08] don't know if you've noticed this but
[43:09] the life of a Believer is
[43:11] hard and he's talking to people that
[43:13] have been persecuted and people that are
[43:15] struggling and people that are dealing
[43:17] with situations and he's saying I know
[43:20] things are tough but he saying look
[43:22] up there's more to this than what you're
[43:25] seeing today
[43:27] he says who are kept by the power of God
[43:29] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[43:33] revealed in the last time wherein ye
[43:35] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[43:39] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[43:41] manifold
[43:42] temptations that the trial of your faith
[43:46] being much more precious than of gold
[43:48] that
[43:49] perisheth though it be tried with
[43:52] fire might be found unto praise and
[43:56] honor and Glory Glory at the appearing
[43:59] of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you
[44:02] can have your seats this
[44:06] morning amen I'm taking a different
[44:08] direction this morning and we'll be
[44:10] touching on certainly some things we've
[44:12] been preaching about but I want to take
[44:14] a title this morning of the harder way
[44:17] amen the harder way and we open with
[44:20] Peter and if you just for the sake of
[44:22] time because I have a fair bit here this
[44:23] morning we didn't read it all but you
[44:25] see there that he's talking to the
[44:27] elect the elect is the bride of Christ
[44:30] it's the true church it's the seed of
[44:32] God it's the children of God and he
[44:35] starts out by reminding them of their
[44:36] position in Christ amen I think that
[44:39] something that we need to do day by day
[44:42] is when we wake up in the morning say I
[44:44] am a child of God Amen just to let Satan
[44:48] know whose side we're on and to remind
[44:50] ourselves of what it is that we carry
[44:53] within us as a child of God Amen that if
[44:55] we are a child of God that's been born
[44:57] again that we come into situations with
[45:00] a recognition that there's only one way
[45:02] that this is going to go and that's the
[45:04] word is going to
[45:06] win I'm not going to win you're not
[45:09] going to win but if we stay with the
[45:10] word the word is going to win amen and
[45:13] Peter's trying to start out with the
[45:15] Positive we see here because he knows
[45:18] that the challenge is so often if you
[45:20] can stay in the right mindset then
[45:22] you'll make your way through the trial a
[45:23] lot easier we are guaranteed to go
[45:26] through trials but there there's a way
[45:27] to go through them that gives you
[45:29] overcoming power regardless of how the
[45:31] situation goes and we're told in the
[45:33] book of Philippians to think on things
[45:35] that are good think on things that are
[45:37] lovely think on things that are true
[45:39] think on things that are just why
[45:41] because those are the things of God
[45:44] those are the things that have value to
[45:46] us amen and I found for myself that if I
[45:48] can turn my mind towards the positive of
[45:51] the word of God it changes my Approach
[45:54] and my mindset as I go through things in
[45:56] life amen I want you to read the listen
[45:58] to this quote he says you sit in church
[46:00] and think about everything else but God
[46:04] he says what are you going to do at the
[46:06] office tomorrow how are you going to do
[46:08] this that or the other he says keep your
[46:10] mind off of that and think on God the
[46:13] Bible says if there be any praise if
[46:15] there be any virtue think on these
[46:18] things don't think that kind of a
[46:20] negative thought don't let it go through
[46:22] your mind make every word positive and
[46:26] every thought thought positive what by
[46:29] the word don't come up with your own
[46:31] thoughts take the thoughts of God Amen
[46:34] so often what we've God is a world
[46:35] that's trying to teach us to be positive
[46:37] Church we've got a positive word here
[46:39] that's supposed to produce something in
[46:41] our lives let's take these thoughts
[46:43] don't come up with your own take what
[46:45] the word says about your life and your
[46:47] situation he says you know after the
[46:49] resurrection of Jesus Copus and his
[46:51] friend were on his road down to Emmas
[46:53] and as he went around talking about
[46:55] Jesus thinking about Jesus he stepped
[46:58] right out of the bushes and walked with
[47:00] them while they were thinking on and
[47:02] while they were meditating he says
[47:04] that's the same way Jesus does today in
[47:07] my heart on my mind all day long let me
[47:10] walk with the L Lord in the light of his
[47:12] word with the Heavenly Dove and let me
[47:15] have Fellowship all day long how do you
[47:20] make God welcome you think on his things
[47:22] you think about him you think of his
[47:23] goodness you praise him you worship Him
[47:26] you put a song on your lips whatever it
[47:28] might be to draw him if you dwell on him
[47:30] he tends to draw near is what he's
[47:32] making and you know I I I can speak to
[47:35] my own life this morning I face some
[47:37] challenges in life and and my mind it
[47:40] wants to get wrapped up in the wha ifs
[47:43] or the what if not so to speak and the
[47:46] thing I found is that when there's
[47:47] uncertainty in life Satan wants to take
[47:49] us on a personal tour of every single
[47:53] possible negative
[47:54] outcome amen he walks you down on every
[47:57] road of what if this happens what if
[47:58] this happens what if this happens and he
[48:00] takes you into great detail about
[48:02] something that has not yet happened amen
[48:05] and none of it is positive every bit of
[48:07] it is negative none of it is of Faith
[48:10] all of it is of doubt and what's he
[48:11] doing Church he's trying to distract you
[48:14] from what God has said and from your
[48:16] purpose in life amen Satan is trying to
[48:20] take us down those roads so he can
[48:21] create stress and worry and fear and it
[48:25] takes our health down it takes our
[48:26] families down it takes our relationships
[48:28] down and we just get beat out because
[48:30] we're so busy walking down roads of what
[48:32] if what if what if and only doubt and
[48:34] stress and worry are waiting at the ends
[48:37] amen but if we can intentionally look to
[48:40] God and that takes conscious effort
[48:42] because Satan is always there to
[48:45] bombard but you've got to respond with a
[48:48] bombardment of your own by the word of
[48:50] God as we spoke last service and say but
[48:52] it is written it is written it is
[48:54] written and don't respond to him respond
[48:56] to yourself and encourage yourself in
[48:59] what God has said about your situation
[49:01] amen sometimes we're working on things
[49:03] or we're waiting on things and it seems
[49:05] like nothing is going to happen the
[49:07] doors keep slamming shut we think it's
[49:09] going to happen then it doesn't we think
[49:11] it's going to happen and then it doesn't
[49:12] and we can't make Headway and nothing's
[49:14] going right and we're getting there and
[49:16] the tendency of our human nature is to
[49:18] get
[49:18] frustrated and to get worried and that's
[49:21] where Faith start or fear starts to
[49:23] dwell amen and this situation in my life
[49:25] I was home and it wasn't working out and
[49:27] then I left to go to Montreal and I went
[49:29] to Edmonton and I'm getting calls and
[49:31] this isn't working and that's not
[49:32] working I don't know if I can do this
[49:33] and and all these things were going on
[49:36] and I could sit there and I could
[49:38] stew or I could do what I did which is
[49:41] say
[49:42] God this in the end is up to you I can't
[49:47] make it happen
[49:49] clearly I'm not going to fret about it
[49:52] and I just said Lord I am committing
[49:54] this situation completely to you and
[49:58] what did I do I disengaged I walked away
[50:02] and I said I'm not going to talk about
[50:03] this I'm not going to dwell on it I'm
[50:05] not going to Stew on it I'm just going
[50:07] to do everything that's asked for me and
[50:09] I'm going to trust you to sort it out
[50:11] that's all I did amen why because Satan
[50:14] was trying to distract me from what I
[50:16] had to do amen I've got to take care of
[50:19] my family I've got to pastor this church
[50:21] I've got a study and all this was was
[50:23] trying to get me to pull away from the
[50:25] things that really mattered in my life
[50:27] and get caught up in things that have no
[50:29] point
[50:31] amen so what did I do I committed it
[50:34] into his hands but let me say this I
[50:37] committed it into his hands from the
[50:39] get-go but I thought things were going
[50:41] to go
[50:43] great and then when they didn't that's
[50:46] really the test of did I commit it into
[50:47] his hands or not because we think it's
[50:50] going to go great well Lord I'm just
[50:51] trusting you that it's all good church
[50:53] there is no test without a test there is
[50:56] no Victory without a battle there is no
[50:59] graduation without a testing time and so
[51:02] when we commit things into his hands the
[51:04] real test is when things don't go the
[51:06] way we thought they were do we get in
[51:08] there and try and make it happen on on
[51:09] our own or do we step back and say Lord
[51:11] this is in your hands my life is in your
[51:14] hands
[51:15] amen and so I refuse to engage and if
[51:18] you know me as a person that is not my
[51:21] way of doing things Germans don't like
[51:23] to
[51:25] disengage they don't they like to go in
[51:28] and they like to work the problem and do
[51:30] everything they can but I said Lord in
[51:32] the end this matters not to me and it
[51:34] truly didn't it would be a frustration
[51:36] yes it would be a disappointment maybe
[51:37] if it didn't happen but I just said Lord
[51:39] this is in your hands and you know what
[51:42] I was sitting with brother Joe and I got
[51:44] the phone call that changed everything
[51:46] and that was it it was done and I didn't
[51:47] have to worry about it and I just said
[51:49] Thank You Lord because I haven't by
[51:51] God's grace and I can say this from the
[51:53] pulpit this morning that nothing had
[51:55] bothered me about it I was able to just
[51:57] say it's going to go the way God wants
[51:59] it to go and if it doesn't go then
[52:01] that's fine as well I'll walk away from
[52:02] these things
[52:05] amen remember I read that quote a while
[52:07] ago we were preaching on the greatest
[52:09] weapons brother Bram said this he says
[52:11] just let loose and let him do it and
[52:14] just commit it to him the greatest
[52:16] weapon that I know of of a Christian
[52:18] today is a committal to God when you
[52:21] can't do nothing about it just commit it
[52:25] to him and God will take care of it but
[52:28] I think sometimes our problem is is that
[52:29] we think we can do something about it
[52:33] amen whether it's because we've got a
[52:34] skill because we've got money because
[52:36] we've got influence whatever we've got a
[52:38] work ethic we think that because we're
[52:40] putting everything we've got into it God
[52:42] will bless it that's not necessarily the
[52:44] way God works sometimes God just says
[52:46] would you please sit down and let me
[52:48] show you I am God and you are my child
[52:52] amen church he is our God he is our
[52:56] Jehovah Gyra he's our
[52:58] provider how about we let him be that
[53:01] way it'll take so much stress out of our
[53:03] day-to-day lives if we say my life is in
[53:06] your hands amen but we're in a battle we
[53:09] know we're in a battle here and don't
[53:11] think for a second that our Christian
[53:12] walk is easy I'm looking at Believers
[53:14] this morning anybody had an easy life to
[53:16] date even our young people know it ain't
[53:19] easy much less the older ones it is a
[53:22] struggle it is a trial day by day it's a
[53:24] hard way anden Paul would say this to
[53:26] Timothy he says if we suffer we shall
[53:29] also reign with him because he had to
[53:32] suffer to reain we've got to suffer to
[53:33] rain he says but if we deny him he also
[53:36] will deny us but the thing I like about
[53:38] Paul is that Paul never pretended to be
[53:40] anything different or anything special
[53:43] and the thing is he was different and he
[53:45] was special the scripture says that God
[53:48] said of Paul that he's a chosen vessel
[53:50] Paul was literally created to share the
[53:53] gospel to the Gentiles but he wasn't a
[53:55] perfect man he he dealt with health
[53:57] issues he dealt with issu issues of his
[53:59] conscience read Romans 7 sometimes and
[54:01] you'll see that Paul had all sorts of
[54:02] little faults and failings in his life
[54:04] as the angel messenger the prophet to
[54:07] the age amen Paul had internal faults
[54:12] and failures and he never pretended
[54:14] otherwise Paul knew that he needed the
[54:16] blood of Jesus Christ and the grace of
[54:18] God every day of his life and he never
[54:19] hid that from us he never hid that from
[54:22] us sometimes the fact that we share our
[54:24] struggles with people helps them in
[54:25] their struggles
[54:27] James said confess your faults one to
[54:29] another and pray that you may be healed
[54:31] why because sometimes other people need
[54:33] to know that you're struggling too
[54:35] listen there's we look at our elders in
[54:37] this church and we might think they're
[54:39] more spiritual than us and I hope
[54:40] they're more spiritual than us cuz
[54:42] they're further along but sometimes the
[54:44] fact that they struggle and we know that
[54:46] they let us know that they struggle or
[54:47] they're in a battle lets us know that
[54:49] it's okay to be in a battle as well
[54:50] Church the fact that you're in a battle
[54:52] shows whose side you're on because
[54:54] everyone else in this world is just
[54:55] giving in or trying to do it their way
[54:57] but when you battle against the things
[54:59] that are going on the influence of Satan
[55:01] in this world it shows who's in your
[55:04] life it shows who's in your heart it
[55:05] shows whose son or daughter you are amen
[55:08] so what we can't help is how we're born
[55:10] we can't help our flesh we can't help
[55:12] our family traits and church traditions
[55:14] and all these different things but what
[55:15] we can help is whether or not we're
[55:17] going to fight amen and whether we're
[55:19] going to just let it go or whether we're
[55:20] going to seek to be delivered of it by
[55:22] the power of the Holy Spirit In Our
[55:23] Lives Paul faced big challenges in his
[55:26] life and he never pre pretended
[55:28] otherwise but one thing I like about
[55:29] Paul is Paul was never unthankful Paul
[55:32] no matter where he was no matter how bad
[55:35] the situation was and he had a lot of
[55:36] them he got stoned multiple times left
[55:39] for dead he had people trying to kill
[55:40] him people persecuting him he had all
[55:42] sorts of things he got put into prison
[55:45] and Paul never stopped worshiping or
[55:47] praising or thanking
[55:48] God Paul and Silas are in the stocks in
[55:52] jail and they're
[55:54] worshiping that's the kind of person
[55:56] that's the kind of Christian that Paul
[55:58] was Paul said this he said and let the
[56:00] peace of God rule in your hearts to the
[56:03] which also ye are called in one body and
[56:07] be ye thankful church if you get nothing
[56:10] else from this service get this one a
[56:11] thankful heart will carry you a long way
[56:13] with God if you can thank him in the
[56:16] good times as much as you thank him in
[56:17] the bad
[56:18] times amen that we could no matter
[56:21] what's happening we can thank him no
[56:22] matter what that'll get you a long ways
[56:24] in your relationship with God then Paul
[56:26] would say to the Thessalonians he would
[56:28] say rejoice everm more you know what
[56:31] that means thank God every chance you
[56:34] get thank God that we have sunshine
[56:37] thank God that you have breath in your
[56:39] body thank God that you have a house
[56:40] over your head thank God that you have a
[56:42] wonderful spouse thank God that you
[56:44] don't have a spouse
[56:47] maybe no matter what is going on thank
[56:51] God for it he says pray without ceasing
[56:54] now you say brother John that's
[56:55] impossible and your right it is
[56:56] impossible because we have to think
[56:58] about different things we have to work
[56:59] we have to deal with situations but what
[57:01] Paul means there is be in an attitude
[57:04] where you can always approach God about
[57:07] a
[57:07] situation in other words keep the
[57:10] channel
[57:11] open where you can drop into prayer and
[57:15] prayer does not mean you get down on
[57:16] your knees like this and put your hands
[57:19] in a certain way but it means that you
[57:22] have kept the channel open so that when
[57:24] the moment comes you can say Lord Jesus
[57:27] I have a
[57:29] need not just for your needs but you say
[57:32] Lord I Just Want to Thank You Lord I
[57:35] appreciate your goodness Lord I Thank
[57:37] you for answering prayer I know I
[57:39] thanked you yesterday but it's still on
[57:41] my heart thank you for doing what you
[57:42] did for our brother thank you for doing
[57:44] what you did for our sister thank you
[57:46] Lord after all this time you're still
[57:48] faithful to your body that we can keep
[57:51] that channel open and we can step into
[57:53] his presence at the drop of a hatch as
[57:56] the need arises or as our heart draws us
[57:59] there amen but that's one thing to do
[58:03] but then Paul would say in verse 18 in
[58:05] everything give thanks everything he
[58:08] says for this is what the will of God in
[58:13] Christ Jesus concerning you now it's one
[58:15] thing to say it but it's another thing
[58:16] to do it this morning that when things
[58:18] are tough when finances are tight we
[58:21] give thanks when we got lots of money in
[58:23] the bank we give thanks when our health
[58:25] is great we give thanks when our health
[58:26] is poor we give thanks when business is
[58:29] good we give thanks when business is bad
[58:31] we give him thanks when the service is
[58:34] good we give him thanks when the
[58:35] pastor's not hitting the Mark we give
[58:36] him thanks anyways
[58:39] amen
[58:43] amen it's hard to sit in a church
[58:45] service where God's feeding somebody
[58:48] else guess what we don't always come in
[58:50] here for ourselves we want something but
[58:52] sometimes we're there to help somebody
[58:54] else get it and we've got to be okay
[58:56] with that sometimes
[58:57] amen I remember brother Matt Watkins
[59:00] telling this story and he he was going
[59:02] up to the pulpit and he dropped his
[59:05] notes and they got all mixed up and
[59:09] turned all around and he's up there and
[59:11] he's at a special convention and he's
[59:14] got a ton of people there and he's so
[59:17] flustered so
[59:19] flustered and he's just he can't get his
[59:22] thoughts together and nothing's coming
[59:24] right and he's up there and he's blowing
[59:27] it big
[59:29] convention he says and I I finally just
[59:31] gave up and he says and I just started
[59:33] speaking on the value of
[59:37] life and at the end of that service a
[59:39] sister came up and she said I was going
[59:41] to end my life after this
[59:45] service and then you started preaching
[59:47] about that nowhere in his notes nowhere
[59:50] he had no idea and in the end it took
[59:53] God to completely frustrate the thought
[59:55] that he had given given him and to put
[59:57] him in a different channel to speak to
[59:59] that one lady now can you imagine
[1:00:01] everybody else sitting there listening
[1:00:02] to something on the value of life and it
[1:00:04] means nothing to them because they're
[1:00:05] not dealing with suicide but for the
[1:00:07] sake of that one woman he completely
[1:00:09] changed that conference one
[1:00:13] woman but if those people would have
[1:00:15] pulled back what might have happened
[1:00:18] there but if they can stay there and
[1:00:20] they can say that might not be for me
[1:00:22] but it's true but it's your word and you
[1:00:24] start to say Amen you never know how God
[1:00:26] can change the situation
[1:00:29] amen Paul Paul doesn't expect anything
[1:00:32] out of us that he didn't expect out of
[1:00:33] himself and he put his what he put his
[1:00:35] life where his words were and these were
[1:00:37] not just Paul telling us to do it but it
[1:00:39] was a testimony of Paul and his constant
[1:00:42] report of God is that God is faithful
[1:00:45] God is faithful he takes care of his
[1:00:48] children he takes care of his word and
[1:00:50] no matter what his situation was Paul
[1:00:52] would say God brought me through it but
[1:00:54] I want you to see something in second
[1:00:56] Corinthians where Paul talks and I put
[1:00:58] this in the Amplified this morning
[1:00:59] because it gives us a a greater depth to
[1:01:01] this and he says we do not want you to
[1:01:04] be uninformed Brethren about the
[1:01:06] Affliction and oppressing distress which
[1:01:08] befell US in Asia he's on a missions
[1:01:10] trip to Asia and nothing went
[1:01:13] right Lord I'm in your
[1:01:16] service I'm on your path I'm doing your
[1:01:18] will everything's going to go great
[1:01:20] right nope no there's a challenge
[1:01:23] there's a trial he says how we were so
[1:01:26] utterly and unbearably weighed down and
[1:01:30] crushed that we despaired even of life
[1:01:34] itself anybody weary this morning
[1:01:37] anybody feeling crushed anybody feeling
[1:01:39] like the weight has been there for so
[1:01:42] long that you don't even want to try and
[1:01:44] walk
[1:01:45] anymore sometimes the burdens of this
[1:01:48] life the situations the constant wear
[1:01:50] the constant stress is there seems like
[1:01:53] there's no end to the struggle there's
[1:01:55] no light at the end of the tunnel it's
[1:01:56] just wait and wait and
[1:01:59] wait Paul says that's how I
[1:02:02] felt he says I know how this feels he
[1:02:05] said when we went on our missions trip
[1:02:07] things got so bad that we thought we
[1:02:10] were going to lose our lives and we had
[1:02:13] committed ourselves to dying he says
[1:02:16] indeed we felt within ourselves that we
[1:02:18] have received the sentence of death and
[1:02:20] were convinced that we would die but
[1:02:23] watch his testimony but this happened
[1:02:25] happened so that we would not trust in
[1:02:29] ourselves he says but in God who raises
[1:02:32] the dead he rescued us from so great a
[1:02:35] threat of death and the church said amen
[1:02:38] hallelujah thank you Paul Paul what's
[1:02:41] next and will continue to rescue us oh
[1:02:45] we've got to keep walking this road yes
[1:02:47] sir there are going to be times in the
[1:02:50] future Paul says where he's going to
[1:02:52] have to do the same thing which means
[1:02:53] I'm going to have to go through the same
[1:02:55] type of trial so he can be the same kind
[1:02:58] of
[1:02:59] God he says on him we have set our hope
[1:03:03] Hallelujah Church where's your hope this
[1:03:05] morning on him we have set our hope and
[1:03:09] he will again rescue us from danger and
[1:03:12] draw Us near Paul's saying God delivers
[1:03:15] God makes a way when it looks like
[1:03:17] nothing can happen God makes away and
[1:03:20] God completely changed their situation
[1:03:22] took them out of the very jaws of death
[1:03:25] and brought them back to make them a
[1:03:27] testimony amen and Paul says it's going
[1:03:29] to happen again and he's going to rescue
[1:03:30] us again and it's going to happen again
[1:03:32] and he's going to rescue us again
[1:03:33] because our hope is set on him and he's
[1:03:35] going to draw us back to him Paul gave
[1:03:38] God gave Paul a testimony so he could
[1:03:40] encourage the
[1:03:41] Believers sometimes that's what your
[1:03:43] trial is it is literally for everyone
[1:03:47] else it is think of brother Ron
[1:03:50] Spencer he's approaching 5 years with
[1:03:53] stage four brain cancer
[1:03:56] and he still preaches every
[1:03:58] week goes and preaches conventions still
[1:04:02] travels around to preach the gospel
[1:04:05] church you think that's for him that's
[1:04:06] for us that's for
[1:04:09] us he takes 30 pills a
[1:04:11] morning 30 pills a morning sometimes
[1:04:15] puking in the bathroom before he goes to
[1:04:17] the pulpit because his body is so sick
[1:04:20] but there's something in him that keeps
[1:04:21] pressing on something keeps holding him
[1:04:24] and it's not for his sake sake it's for
[1:04:26] our
[1:04:27] sake so that when we get up in the
[1:04:29] morning we have a little headache or we
[1:04:30] have a little sniffle or maybe we feel
[1:04:33] horrible we can get up and say God's
[1:04:36] still God God can still use me no matter
[1:04:39] how I'm feeling this morning amen but
[1:04:41] there's going to be times where we're
[1:04:43] going and we're doing things and it
[1:04:44] seems like there's no end in sight to
[1:04:46] what we're
[1:04:47] doing but what's our purpose here our
[1:04:50] purpose is to be a witness and a
[1:04:52] testimony of a living Jesus Christ he's
[1:04:55] the same God today sister Nikki amen
[1:04:58] amen I thought that was perfect this
[1:04:59] morning he's the same God today and the
[1:05:01] only Christ people are going to see in
[1:05:03] this age as you and I Jesus Christ never
[1:05:06] sets foot on this Earth until he comes
[1:05:08] back in the tribulation We Gather to
[1:05:10] meet him in the air the only revealing
[1:05:12] of Christ is in his body his bride so
[1:05:15] we've got to be that witness and that
[1:05:17] testimony whether we're going to work
[1:05:19] whether we're staying at home whether
[1:05:20] we're at the home school group we're at
[1:05:22] the gym we're in the office wherever it
[1:05:24] might be
[1:05:26] our purpose is to show Christ
[1:05:29] amen and Paul got a revelation of a God
[1:05:31] that delivers real quick as soon as Paul
[1:05:35] gets the Holy Ghost and he goes back to
[1:05:37] Jerusalem the first thing they do is try
[1:05:38] and kill him now that's a ways down but
[1:05:40] Paul just constantly he was put in
[1:05:43] situations where he had to trust God and
[1:05:45] what is it it was God taking you say you
[1:05:47] believe it and putting it into
[1:05:50] action we have so much knowledge we have
[1:05:52] so much Revelation God's trying to turn
[1:05:54] that into faith so we can live by it day
[1:05:57] by day amen but I want to Pivot this
[1:05:59] morning just real quickly for this
[1:06:01] because sometimes life is tough and it's
[1:06:03] tough because of my
[1:06:06] decisions and not his
[1:06:08] decisions sometimes I step into things
[1:06:11] sometimes we're in a bad spot because we
[1:06:12] put ourselves in a bad spot amen we what
[1:06:16] happens we put the word of God aside and
[1:06:18] we decide this is what I want or this is
[1:06:20] how I want it or this is when I want it
[1:06:22] and let me tell you Church my way is
[1:06:24] hard my way is hard God's way is hard my
[1:06:28] way is hard too but my way is hard for a
[1:06:30] different reason amen my choices are
[1:06:32] hard on me if I'm focused on what this
[1:06:34] flesh wants if I get an idea in my head
[1:06:36] and I don't filter it through the pure
[1:06:38] word of God I'm going to pay a price for
[1:06:40] that decision if I stick with
[1:06:44] it look at this it says good
[1:06:47] understanding giveth favor but the way
[1:06:49] of transgressors is hard so we're
[1:06:52] speaking on the harder way this morning
[1:06:54] but there's a hard way and it's the way
[1:06:56] of the transgressor that word
[1:06:57] transgressor means those that act
[1:07:00] deceitfully or treacherously so other
[1:07:03] words it's someone that disguises their
[1:07:06] actions under a cloak of Good Will or
[1:07:10] spirituality this is not about
[1:07:12] unbelievers this is about
[1:07:15] Believers people that live in sin are
[1:07:17] not transgressing because they're
[1:07:18] Sinners it's the believer that
[1:07:20] transgresses because they know better
[1:07:23] now there's a price to be paid don't get
[1:07:24] me wrong you do something that is
[1:07:26] contrary to the word you're going to pay
[1:07:27] a price the scripture says be not
[1:07:29] deceived God is Not mocked whatsoever a
[1:07:31] man SS he'll reap you do certain things
[1:07:33] you're going to reap certain things
[1:07:34] there's no changing that amen amen but
[1:07:37] this this this transgressor is someone
[1:07:39] that gives a reason for what they're
[1:07:41] doing that sounds good but when you
[1:07:43] start to compare it to the impact it has
[1:07:45] and the word that they're supposedly
[1:07:47] standing on they don't match up amen
[1:07:50] they can wrap it up in a spiritual
[1:07:51] reason a religious reason or a good
[1:07:53] rapper but it's still wrong and in the
[1:07:55] the ones that's deceived is not us it's
[1:07:58] them it's self-deception it is not
[1:08:00] deceiving the rest of us because if
[1:08:02] we've got any ounce of discernment we'll
[1:08:04] look at that and we'll say that can't be
[1:08:05] of God because it's contrary to the word
[1:08:07] and so they're only deceiving themselves
[1:08:09] but you make a decision like that church
[1:08:11] and we all have you make a decision like
[1:08:14] that what happens after a while you step
[1:08:15] back and you say something's wrong and
[1:08:17] it's not wrong because the way is hard
[1:08:19] it's wrong because there's no peace in
[1:08:21] the hardship amen that you're going
[1:08:24] through something and you start to say
[1:08:26] why is it that this is getting to me so
[1:08:28] badly and you realize I made this
[1:08:29] decision I made this choice I took this
[1:08:32] step on my own
[1:08:34] amen and what happens is you're
[1:08:36] suffering and there's no rest there's no
[1:08:39] goodness coming out of that suffering
[1:08:40] and what I found in these situations is
[1:08:43] that when we do these things what we end
[1:08:44] up doing is turning our guns on other
[1:08:47] believers because what happens if we is
[1:08:49] we've walked away from the word if only
[1:08:52] in that small area of our life I'm not
[1:08:53] saying you've walked away we've walked
[1:08:54] away from everything but in one area
[1:08:56] we've walked away and what happens is
[1:08:58] when we walk away from the word there's
[1:08:59] no correction and when there's no
[1:09:01] correction we think we're right all the
[1:09:03] time and then we start looking at other
[1:09:05] people and trying to correct
[1:09:06] them and what happens is God says no
[1:09:10] problem and he just steps right back
[1:09:13] completely and he lets you walk that
[1:09:15] path alone and what comes out is fruits
[1:09:17] and the fruits show who was in it and
[1:09:19] who wasn't because if evil fruits come
[1:09:21] out of it it wasn't God but if good
[1:09:23] fruit comes out of it then it was God
[1:09:25] there's suffering both ways there's hard
[1:09:27] ways whether you it's a hard way whether
[1:09:28] you walk with God or you walk of your
[1:09:30] own nature and your own free will but in
[1:09:33] the end the fruits will show who was in
[1:09:35] it whether it was me or whether it was
[1:09:37] God Amen you might have a hard time in a
[1:09:39] decision like this but it's never going
[1:09:41] to be productive because you left God
[1:09:43] behind and so you walk backwards you go
[1:09:45] backwards you backslide and what do you
[1:09:48] have to do you have to come back to him
[1:09:50] that's the only way back Peter would
[1:09:52] talk about this he says for this is
[1:09:53] thankworthy if a man conscience toward
[1:09:56] God and your grief suffering wrongfully
[1:09:58] so if because of what you believe you
[1:10:01] endure hard things that's
[1:10:04] good he says but what glory is it if
[1:10:06] when you are buffeted for your faults
[1:10:08] you shall take it patiently if you're an
[1:10:10] alcoholic and you lose your job that's
[1:10:14] not suffering
[1:10:16] righteously you lost your job because
[1:10:18] you're an alcoholic you lost your family
[1:10:21] because you're an alcoholic and so you
[1:10:22] say well I'm just going through it and
[1:10:24] it's so that's not suffering righteously
[1:10:26] you're suffering because of your poor
[1:10:28] decisions Peter says we're not supposed
[1:10:31] to be there he says but if when you do
[1:10:33] well and suffer for it you take it
[1:10:35] patiently this is acceptable with
[1:10:38] God I've dealt with this with people
[1:10:40] many times through life not just as a
[1:10:42] minister but just in general well people
[1:10:44] will make wrong decisions and then they
[1:10:47] sit there and they say but I'm going to
[1:10:48] make it
[1:10:49] through what's the
[1:10:51] point go back don't make it through go
[1:10:55] back stop going forward go back to where
[1:10:57] you left God Amen he's waiting there
[1:10:59] where you left
[1:11:01] him you know Jonah's that perfect
[1:11:03] example to me of suffering without a
[1:11:05] purpose suffering Without a Cause cuz he
[1:11:07] flat out disobeyed God God said go to
[1:11:09] Nineveh and instead he jumped on a ship
[1:11:11] to tarus nearly killed everyone on board
[1:11:13] because God put up a big storm and so
[1:11:15] Jonah had to finally admit I'm the
[1:11:17] problem he says get me off the boat and
[1:11:19] everything will be okay and so they
[1:11:20] heaved him over the ship and as soon as
[1:11:21] he hits the water then the water goes
[1:11:23] flat and everything's okay and what
[1:11:25] happens is a whale comes and he swallows
[1:11:28] Jonah and Jonah spends three sweaty
[1:11:31] stinky seaweedy rotten fish nights in
[1:11:33] the belly of the whale
[1:11:35] repenting and after 3 days God has that
[1:11:38] whale vomit him up on the shores near
[1:11:40] Nineveh and turns it into something for
[1:11:42] God's glory and that's the privilege of
[1:11:45] a child of God that's the privilege of a
[1:11:47] child of God Romans 8:28 still holds we
[1:11:49] know that all things work together for
[1:11:51] good God will take your poor decisions
[1:11:54] and he will bring them to to a place
[1:11:55] where you can give him glory but there's
[1:11:57] still a price to be paid and Jonah's
[1:11:59] price was 3 days in the belly of a whale
[1:12:01] with a lot of
[1:12:02] nastiness and I don't think he ever
[1:12:04] forgot that I don't think he ever forgot
[1:12:07] that amen you're still a child of God
[1:12:10] but there's a price that has to be paid
[1:12:13] and then you've got to come back to
[1:12:14] where he was and we see that in the
[1:12:15] parable of the prodical son that the
[1:12:17] father never left the word the father
[1:12:19] never left his land he stayed where he
[1:12:21] was but he kept an eye out and as soon
[1:12:23] as that son came in view on on his land
[1:12:25] he ran to get
[1:12:26] him he'll go anywhere you are on his
[1:12:29] word if you'll come back to his word but
[1:12:31] he says he never went and found him out
[1:12:32] in the
[1:12:33] world he knew better he knew where daddy
[1:12:36] was he knew where safety was he knew
[1:12:37] where food was and so God says you got
[1:12:39] to come back to me now you know where I
[1:12:41] am you know where you left me you got to
[1:12:44] come back to it amen God's always
[1:12:46] merciful he's always gracious but the
[1:12:49] way of the transgressor is hard amen and
[1:12:51] you've got to walk back and sometimes
[1:12:52] that's the hardest thing isn't that the
[1:12:54] most humiliating thing is walking back
[1:12:56] and saying that was me and not him it is
[1:12:58] it's a tough time Moses found out
[1:13:00] there's a hard way of transgressors and
[1:13:03] sometimes it's not that we're trying to
[1:13:04] do wrong it's that we're trying to do
[1:13:06] something in our time cuz Moses was born
[1:13:09] a deliverer he was born a special child
[1:13:11] from birth he had a call in his life he
[1:13:13] knew the word of God as it related to
[1:13:15] him amen but Moses transgression was
[1:13:17] presuming that he knew when God wanted
[1:13:19] to do it and so all he ended up with all
[1:13:22] of this in the end was he had one dead
[1:13:24] Egyptian he lost the influence on his
[1:13:26] own people and he was banished to the
[1:13:28] desert for 40 years that's what Moses
[1:13:30] transgression caught him cost him Amen
[1:13:32] brother Brown would say this he says
[1:13:34] Moses found out his way didn't work and
[1:13:37] as Moses learned the hard way so have I
[1:13:39] learned in that way no doubt but many of
[1:13:41] the people here today sitting here or
[1:13:43] standing here has learned it the same
[1:13:44] way it's a hard way he says it's best to
[1:13:47] surrender your will to God's Will and
[1:13:50] hold a conference with him God what do
[1:13:53] you want me to do God what do you not
[1:13:56] want me to
[1:13:58] do but we look at all that he says it's
[1:14:01] a hard way but we're not preaching on
[1:14:03] the hard way this morning we're
[1:14:04] preaching about the harder
[1:14:05] way amen the child of a the the the path
[1:14:08] of a child of God is often far harder
[1:14:11] and we opened up with the book of Peter
[1:14:12] and Peter said this he says wherein ye
[1:14:14] greatly Rejoice though now for a season
[1:14:17] if need be ye are in heaviness through
[1:14:20] manifold Temptations I want you to catch
[1:14:23] that thing now first thing Peter said
[1:14:25] says it's only for a season there's only
[1:14:29] a time for the trial the trial is not
[1:14:31] infinite it does not go on forever but
[1:14:33] there is a trial there's a season for
[1:14:36] these things and sometimes a season is
[1:14:38] you have to give of yourself for
[1:14:39] somebody else and sometimes you have to
[1:14:41] let go of yourself so God can change you
[1:14:43] sometimes it's for their benefit
[1:14:45] sometimes it's for your for for your own
[1:14:47] and so many times we're asking God God
[1:14:49] changed the situation and God's promise
[1:14:52] was not that he would change the
[1:14:53] situation God's promises that he would
[1:14:55] change you that he would change me and
[1:14:58] so many times what God's saying is I'll
[1:15:00] change the situation if it's ever needed
[1:15:03] but let's work with you first and see
[1:15:05] what needs to be done in you because so
[1:15:07] many times the change that needs to
[1:15:08] happen is in me not in that situation
[1:15:11] and I know I've said this many times but
[1:15:12] I want to repeat it this morning the
[1:15:14] greatest change has to be in here and
[1:15:17] then after that so many times we find
[1:15:19] the situation doesn't really matter that
[1:15:20] much it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[1:15:23] God will give us a peace God will give
[1:15:24] us rest Church the greatest testimony I
[1:15:27] have is not that God has met my
[1:15:28] financial need that God has given me
[1:15:30] Health that God has given me a home that
[1:15:31] God's given me a family the greatest
[1:15:33] testimony I have today is that I'm not
[1:15:35] what I was yesterday and I'm not what I
[1:15:37] was last month and I'm not what I was
[1:15:39] last year and he's continuously changing
[1:15:41] me into His Image that's the testimony
[1:15:44] I've got that's the promise he gave me
[1:15:46] is he give me a new heart and a new
[1:15:48] spirit and then he put his Spirit within
[1:15:50] me and he' make me walk according to his
[1:15:53] word that's what I've got this morning
[1:15:55] that's what youve got this morning
[1:15:56] that's the testimony of the Overcomer is
[1:15:59] that you are no longer yourself you are
[1:16:01] a child of God walking according to the
[1:16:03] word of Jesus Christ
[1:16:05] amen Peter says manifold Temptations oh
[1:16:08] I hate these scriptures don't we hate
[1:16:11] them manifold temptations that means
[1:16:14] many and
[1:16:16] different it means that he's not just
[1:16:19] punching you in one spot he doesn't just
[1:16:21] have one spot but it's things going on
[1:16:23] in every aspect of your lifetime and
[1:16:26] that's what Paul was talking about
[1:16:28] crushed it just seems like we've got an
[1:16:31] onslaught these days one thing goes away
[1:16:33] and there's another thing and sometimes
[1:16:35] you're fighting three battles at the
[1:16:36] same time you don't know where to put
[1:16:37] your energy amen you don't know where to
[1:16:40] put it various trials sometimes it's one
[1:16:44] thing today another thing tomorrow and
[1:16:46] sometimes it's everything today those
[1:16:47] are the rough days nothing's going right
[1:16:50] everything goes wrong you know we used
[1:16:52] to sing that song as kids no body likes
[1:16:55] me everybody hates me might as well eat
[1:16:57] worms every you ever feel like that
[1:16:58] where you're just like I might as well
[1:16:59] just sit down and give up cuz nothing's
[1:17:02] going right and nobody actually really
[1:17:03] likes me
[1:17:05] either it's true we get there don't we
[1:17:08] we get so burdened by the effects of
[1:17:10] things but Peter comes behind he says
[1:17:13] that the trial of your faith it's a
[1:17:16] trial of whether or not you really
[1:17:18] believe he says be much more precious
[1:17:20] than of gold that perisheth he says when
[1:17:23] this is all done you you'll be so happy
[1:17:25] you went through this you'll value the
[1:17:28] experience of these trials he says
[1:17:30] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:17:32] found unto praise and honor and Glory
[1:17:35] when at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:17:39] amen we're going to go through events
[1:17:41] we're going to go through situations and
[1:17:42] trials in this life hardships and scars
[1:17:45] and all these different things but Peter
[1:17:47] says they'll do one thing they will be
[1:17:49] to the praise and honor and Glory when
[1:17:53] Christ appears
[1:17:55] now the world will look at this and say
[1:17:56] well that's when he comes to get us and
[1:17:58] I don't disagree but you've got to
[1:18:01] remember when it comes to purification
[1:18:03] when does he
[1:18:06] appear he appears when his reflection is
[1:18:09] seen in that which has being
[1:18:11] purified what happens as we go through
[1:18:14] these things in life and what is it
[1:18:16] doing church it's producing Jesus Christ
[1:18:18] in you and in me and so when you start
[1:18:22] to see that it's Christ in me the hope
[1:18:24] of Glory that it's bringing out
[1:18:26] something that you didn't even know was
[1:18:28] there and through all the scraping and
[1:18:30] the beating and the trials and the
[1:18:33] heat all of a sudden he appears in your
[1:18:35] life and you say Thank You Lord thank
[1:18:37] you Lord I'm still walking forward I'm
[1:18:39] still growing I'm still maturing amen we
[1:18:42] go through these things and it produces
[1:18:44] the life of Jesus Christ in us remember
[1:18:46] his appearing right now is in you and I
[1:18:49] that's what people are saying amen these
[1:18:51] things were always in Us by the
[1:18:52] attributes by the thought of God and
[1:18:54] then the Holy Spirit comes in and it
[1:18:56] brings it up into life amen but these
[1:18:58] things we go through what's it there to
[1:19:00] do it's to produce the life of Jesus
[1:19:03] Christ amen in plain view in you and
[1:19:05] I that's what this life is for is to
[1:19:08] produce the life the character and so we
[1:19:10] can look back on these things but what
[1:19:13] Peter's trying to do is we can look back
[1:19:15] on it and say God was in it Peter's
[1:19:17] trying to get us to the point to say God
[1:19:18] is in it from the front rather than from
[1:19:20] the back because we're children of God
[1:19:23] that we go through these things with
[1:19:25] purpose amen you look at purification I
[1:19:28] was watching this yesterday how they
[1:19:30] they produce iron ore and iron ore Gres
[1:19:32] from dirt to a pure metal and there's a
[1:19:35] lot of processes and it's a lot of dirty
[1:19:38] and it's a lot of scraping and it's a
[1:19:40] lot of mess and what comes out in no way
[1:19:43] reflects what goes in it seems like and
[1:19:45] it's a lot of things going on at the
[1:19:46] same time amen it's a lot of beating a
[1:19:49] lot of
[1:19:50] mixing if if iron or had feelings it
[1:19:53] wouldn't feel good but what comes out is
[1:19:56] far better than what went in because
[1:19:58] it's taken it's gotten rid of everything
[1:20:00] that was impure and it's brought in that
[1:20:01] which was in there in the first place
[1:20:03] amen I want to share this scripture with
[1:20:05] you and this is one of the greatest
[1:20:07] scriptures I know of as it relates to us
[1:20:09] as Believers and how God develops Us in
[1:20:12] these things amen because you'll see in
[1:20:14] the scripture that no believer ever
[1:20:16] walks into a situation and God just gift
[1:20:18] wraps them an amazing
[1:20:21] thing it never happens
[1:20:25] everybody has to go through trials and
[1:20:27] testing everybody's got to be proven
[1:20:29] because what God is coming back for is
[1:20:31] character he's coming back for character
[1:20:34] amen and so everyone had to go through
[1:20:36] training and testing to develop that
[1:20:38] character above in them above all things
[1:20:41] to reign with Christ we have to have the
[1:20:43] character of Christ amen people think
[1:20:45] they get things from God because they're
[1:20:46] children of God no you get things from
[1:20:48] God because you act like you're a child
[1:20:49] of
[1:20:50] God there are things we have because we
[1:20:52] are children listen you can be healed
[1:20:54] when whether you're a brat in Christ or
[1:20:56] you're a mature believer in Christ
[1:20:57] that's the children's bread but if you
[1:21:00] want responsibility in this life you've
[1:21:02] got to start acting responsible like a
[1:21:04] Believer amen You' got to act mature so
[1:21:06] this scripture in Psalms 105 it's God
[1:21:08] speaking of his favor to the Seed of
[1:21:10] Abraham amen that's the children of God
[1:21:13] and that means it's relevant to us
[1:21:14] because we are his spiritual seed we're
[1:21:15] the faith Seed of Abraham this morning
[1:21:18] amen because we have the faith that we
[1:21:19] did that he did but he says moreover
[1:21:22] he's speaking now this is the favor of
[1:21:23] God watch
[1:21:25] moreover he called for a famine upon the
[1:21:27] land and he break the whole staff of
[1:21:29] bread so God made things difficult he
[1:21:31] brought a famine to Abraham's people
[1:21:34] that were under the Covenant and he made
[1:21:35] them
[1:21:36] hungry and then it says he sent a man
[1:21:39] before them even Joseph who was sold for
[1:21:42] a servant so stop and consider this
[1:21:44] Joseph is a prophet of God and he has
[1:21:47] done nothing
[1:21:48] wrong Joseph has lived his life
[1:21:51] righteously when God gives him a vision
[1:21:53] or a dream he relates it exactly the way
[1:21:55] it was he didn't add anything to it he
[1:21:57] spoke the word of God as it came to him
[1:22:00] and because of that his brothers faked
[1:22:02] his death told his father he was dead
[1:22:05] and they sold him into the into
[1:22:07] slavery but God doesn't say he sold him
[1:22:09] into slavery God says or or sorry he
[1:22:12] says it doesn't it doesn't treat it that
[1:22:14] way like this was just happen St it says
[1:22:17] God
[1:22:18] sent sent in other words God is in it
[1:22:22] this was God's hand moving and God's and
[1:22:24] moving here in a plan to meet the needs
[1:22:28] of the Seed of Abraham is through Joseph
[1:22:30] and the way he does it is he sells him
[1:22:32] into
[1:22:34] slavery Church Joseph has all the
[1:22:37] reasons in the world to be offended to
[1:22:40] be hurt to be disappointed to turn his
[1:22:42] back on God because he's done nothing
[1:22:44] wrong and God sells him into
[1:22:47] slavery that's God's hand on Joseph's
[1:22:51] life amen so so Joseph goes there and
[1:22:56] he's a slave to Piper captain of the
[1:22:58] king and then Piper's wife comes on to
[1:23:01] Joseph he turns him down she she she
[1:23:03] accuses him of assault and so what does
[1:23:06] God do now Joseph having done everything
[1:23:08] right with Piper God says whose fo whose
[1:23:11] feet they hurt with feeds and he was
[1:23:13] laid in Iron so God now takes him now
[1:23:15] not just from slavery but now he's a
[1:23:17] felon through no fault of his own Joseph
[1:23:20] acted honorably in every single thing
[1:23:23] that he did and now God puts him in
[1:23:26] prison he did the right thing and he
[1:23:29] pays a price for
[1:23:34] it verse 19 until the time that his word
[1:23:39] came it says the word of the Lord Tried
[1:23:43] Him the Amplified says until the time
[1:23:46] that his word of Prophecy came true the
[1:23:48] word of the Lord tested and refined him
[1:23:52] what Peter said there's a season
[1:23:55] there's a there's a time for the trial
[1:23:57] there's a time for the test and there's
[1:23:58] a time for the graduation amen there's a
[1:24:01] time for the the battle and there's a
[1:24:02] time for the victory the scripture says
[1:24:04] until the time was right for God's word
[1:24:07] to be fulfilled Joseph was tested to see
[1:24:09] if he believed the
[1:24:11] word amen that's the harder way we're
[1:24:13] talking about the word was there the
[1:24:15] word had been given that Joseph was
[1:24:18] going to be in authority over his
[1:24:19] brothers that they would bow down before
[1:24:21] him and then what does God do is he
[1:24:23] drives Joseph down into the
[1:24:28] ground wrecks his
[1:24:31] life destroys his
[1:24:33] influence to say Joseph are you going to
[1:24:35] believe that word are you going to fall
[1:24:37] away and get
[1:24:38] offended church but there's a time where
[1:24:42] the time that his word came Hallelujah
[1:24:45] and in the moment in a twinkling of an
[1:24:47] eye Joseph went from a slave and a felon
[1:24:51] to sitting at the right hand of the king
[1:24:54] King like that just like that amen it
[1:24:58] says the king sent and loosed him even
[1:25:01] the ruler of the people and let him go
[1:25:03] free he made him Lord of his house and
[1:25:06] ruler of all his substance and to bind
[1:25:09] his princes at his pleasure and teach
[1:25:11] his Senators wisdom can you imagine
[1:25:13] remember what happened is the king had a
[1:25:15] dream and he couldn't remember the dream
[1:25:17] much less he needed an interpretation of
[1:25:19] it and he asked around and nobody could
[1:25:21] do it and then finally uh I don't
[1:25:23] remember it was a the cup Bearer I think
[1:25:25] it was the cup Bearer that would that
[1:25:26] had been spared and the cup Bearer said
[1:25:28] hey I know a guy I know a guy in prison
[1:25:31] that helped us and he he interpreted my
[1:25:33] dream maybe he can help you and so
[1:25:35] Pharaoh comes and he brings Joseph
[1:25:37] before him and so Joseph is standing
[1:25:39] there now he's a slave he's a felon he's
[1:25:41] a prisoner he's in his prison clothes
[1:25:43] he's no doubt dirty and ragged and he
[1:25:46] stands there and he tells the kid the
[1:25:47] Pharaoh what his dream was then he tells
[1:25:50] him what his dream means and then
[1:25:52] Pharaoh says well what do I do about
[1:25:53] this we're going to have these great
[1:25:54] years of plenty we're going to have
[1:25:56] seven years of famine and at the end of
[1:25:57] the famine there's going to be nothing
[1:25:59] left it's going to be worse than it ever
[1:26:00] was what do I do and Joseph said find a
[1:26:02] wise man and put him in charge and he'll
[1:26:04] take 20% of of what's brought in every
[1:26:06] year and he'll put it aside and we'll
[1:26:08] make it through and the King says you're
[1:26:10] the man and Joseph in a moment goes from
[1:26:14] Rags to Riches he gets the Garment of
[1:26:16] the king he gets the king's apparel he
[1:26:18] gets the King's Jewelry he gets the Ring
[1:26:20] of authority on his finger and he's
[1:26:22] standing now at the right hand of the
[1:26:24] King acting in the king's purpose and
[1:26:28] plan like that that's the day that his
[1:26:31] word
[1:26:32] came but until then it tried him and it
[1:26:35] tested
[1:26:36] him why am I saying this is because it's
[1:26:40] a harder way to walk with the
[1:26:43] word because God sets the timeline not
[1:26:48] you it's all in him it's all in him we
[1:26:51] don't get to push it amen and so often
[1:26:53] it seems like nothing's changing but the
[1:26:55] problem so often is we're looking at the
[1:26:57] outside and saying nothing's changing
[1:26:59] but we don't realize what has been
[1:27:00] happening all along and if Joseph I
[1:27:02] don't know Joseph was a type of Christ
[1:27:05] nearly perfect he only ever asked is did
[1:27:07] one one thing that we know that was
[1:27:08] wrong I mean I'm not saying that's it
[1:27:10] but the scripture records he asked his
[1:27:11] father to lie about being a Shepherd
[1:27:13] because the Egyptians looked down on
[1:27:14] Shepherds so he said tell them you raise
[1:27:15] cattle but as far as we know Joseph
[1:27:17] didn't lay a foot wrong lay a hand wrong
[1:27:20] all his
[1:27:22] life he's there and he's enslaved and
[1:27:24] he's in prison and his attitude's right
[1:27:26] his approach is right he he acts of his
[1:27:28] own free will he he works hard and does
[1:27:31] all of these things and God blesses him
[1:27:32] and what was it showing it was producing
[1:27:34] character in Joseph so that when the
[1:27:36] time came he would not use his power for
[1:27:39] Revenge but he'd use it for the goodness
[1:27:41] of his family and for those around him
[1:27:43] amen God's working on the Inside Man so
[1:27:46] often church and that's what takes a
[1:27:48] while is there's no quick fixes there's
[1:27:51] no quick fixes amen God's got to produce
[1:27:53] character and character has to be tested
[1:27:55] before it can be put into action in
[1:27:57] God's service amen and then like I said
[1:27:59] before sometimes the outside situation
[1:28:01] really doesn't need to change because
[1:28:02] once you've got character you're able to
[1:28:04] walk away from situations you're able to
[1:28:06] let people go you don't get offended the
[1:28:09] same way you can you you can take
[1:28:11] somebody to prayer rather than take them
[1:28:13] before the Throne of judgment and so
[1:28:15] that's all God's trying to do the way of
[1:28:17] the transgressor is hard and when you
[1:28:19] look around this this world though so
[1:28:21] often they get all of their good stuff
[1:28:23] up front you can work 60 hours a week
[1:28:25] and make tons of money and get further
[1:28:27] ahead in your career than somebody else
[1:28:29] you get a bunch of money you can spend a
[1:28:31] lot of money you can buy a big house you
[1:28:32] can have a nice vehicle you can go on
[1:28:34] Great Vacations you can get Prestige or
[1:28:36] influence and all these things and it
[1:28:38] seems like it's all good but then
[1:28:40] further down the road you find out
[1:28:41] there's a price to be paid and when your
[1:28:43] marriage falls apart and now you're so
[1:28:45] stressed out that you're into drugs
[1:28:47] you're into alcohol your kids aren't
[1:28:49] turning out so good everybody's gone and
[1:28:51] what you're left with is stuff that has
[1:28:53] no
[1:28:54] value there's no there's no value in
[1:28:57] these things certainly nothing of
[1:28:58] Eternal value it's hard to come to the
[1:29:00] end of the road and realize that you
[1:29:02] don't have anything of value I've got
[1:29:04] I've got my own family that's in this
[1:29:06] situation amen it's my father's birthday
[1:29:09] today 72 years old and for all we know
[1:29:11] he could be gone tomorrow and he's
[1:29:13] sitting there and he's looking around
[1:29:15] and if he's honest with himself he can
[1:29:17] see I have nothing of value and our only
[1:29:20] prayer is God have mercy God have mercy
[1:29:23] that they'll see their condition in
[1:29:25] these things amen and that they'll come
[1:29:26] back to
[1:29:27] him CU It's A Hard Road but Joseph see
[1:29:31] God front loads the heavy stuff and then
[1:29:33] the joys is at the end usually but he
[1:29:36] gives you peace to go through it he'll
[1:29:38] give you peace to go through it the
[1:29:40] harder ways you get everything up front
[1:29:42] and then it hits in the back end and you
[1:29:43] can't undo it anymore you can't undo it
[1:29:46] there's no promise in the suffering that
[1:29:48] comes with the hard way of a
[1:29:49] transgressor but I want to jump forward
[1:29:51] for the last portion of the service this
[1:29:53] morning because we spoke of Jesus in the
[1:29:55] last couple of services how that he had
[1:29:57] to make his own choices through life and
[1:29:59] he had to choose the harder way he had
[1:30:01] to choose the way that meant rejection
[1:30:03] that meant persecution that meant people
[1:30:05] trying to kill him amen people trying to
[1:30:06] destroy his ministry and he had to
[1:30:08] choose that way because the word said he
[1:30:11] would but remember he was the word and
[1:30:13] we read last service that he says I come
[1:30:15] to do thy will oh God it's written of me
[1:30:17] in the volume of the book I come to do
[1:30:19] thy will he was the word made flesh and
[1:30:21] so because it's imprinted on him he
[1:30:23] cannot deny himself it's literally built
[1:30:26] into him to do it I'm saying this
[1:30:28] morning it's built into you to do it as
[1:30:30] well but you got a different rapper than
[1:30:32] he did and that's where the battle is so
[1:30:34] many times but you look at Jesus
[1:30:35] ministry leading up to Calvary he raised
[1:30:38] the dead he healed the sick he opened
[1:30:40] blind eyes he healed the lepers he
[1:30:42] created and and multiplied things he
[1:30:44] walked on waterers he calmed the storm
[1:30:46] he stilled the sea he cast out demons he
[1:30:49] set people free and we would say that is
[1:30:52] the Apex that is the peak of his
[1:30:54] ministry and yet church if he never died
[1:30:56] and rose again it would have been for
[1:30:58] nothing temporal only for that people
[1:31:02] only for That season amen it wouldn't
[1:31:03] have had Eternal significance for you
[1:31:05] and I if he would have just lived his
[1:31:07] life and gone on Amen but I want you to
[1:31:10] see something as we start to close on
[1:31:12] this thought we're talking about the
[1:31:13] harder way and I'm saying the harder way
[1:31:15] is a choice for every one of us he says
[1:31:18] now before the Feast of the Passover
[1:31:21] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[1:31:23] that he should depart out of this world
[1:31:25] under the father having loved his own
[1:31:27] which were in the world he loved them
[1:31:29] under the end under the end even when
[1:31:31] they walked away even when they forsook
[1:31:33] him even when they betrayed him he says
[1:31:36] and supper being ended the devil having
[1:31:37] now put into the heart of Judas a
[1:31:39] scariot Simon son to betray him watch
[1:31:41] this now Jesus knowing that the father
[1:31:44] had given all things into his hands and
[1:31:48] that he was come from God and went to
[1:31:50] God so Jesus knows what's going to
[1:31:53] happen remember I'm Mount
[1:31:54] Transfiguration Elijah and Moses come
[1:31:56] down they tell him what's happening they
[1:31:58] tell him what's going to happen in
[1:31:59] Jerusalem they tell him what he's
[1:32:01] supposed to do that he's going to go
[1:32:02] there be betrayed give his life by
[1:32:04] horrible crucifixion for Humanity so
[1:32:07] notice there's a time like Joseph where
[1:32:09] the word of God is going to try Jesus
[1:32:12] he's had a trial of sorts in his
[1:32:13] ministry but it's been with signs and
[1:32:15] wonders and power and authority he
[1:32:16] always won but now he's got to step into
[1:32:18] a different trial CU he's going to have
[1:32:21] to trust the word completely
[1:32:26] amen Jesus is not in a position where he
[1:32:28] has no choice it says God has given all
[1:32:31] things into his hands he's talking about
[1:32:33] that flesh man now that man has to
[1:32:35] choose am I going to go ahead or am I
[1:32:38] going to back away amen he has to choose
[1:32:41] do I do what the word says I should do
[1:32:44] or do I do what my flesh really would
[1:32:46] prefer that I do
[1:32:48] amen it's on his shoulders it's his
[1:32:51] decision to make remember the Lambs that
[1:32:53] were sacrif throughout the Old Testament
[1:32:55] had no choice but this lamb has to
[1:32:58] choose to give his life the Lamb of God
[1:33:00] has to choose to give his life it
[1:33:02] couldn't be taken from him we had he had
[1:33:04] to give it amen we're speaking on the
[1:33:06] harder way and this is the harder way to
[1:33:08] look at the word and say that's where
[1:33:10] I'm going to stay no matter what it
[1:33:12] costs me to get the reward of God you've
[1:33:14] got to have the full word halfway get
[1:33:17] you halfway results and let me tell you
[1:33:19] halfway to Eternity is not enough and
[1:33:21] then you got to go all the way with God
[1:33:23] and we look at Jesus he says therefore
[1:33:25] does my father love me because I lay
[1:33:27] down my life that I might take it again
[1:33:30] no man taketh it from me but I lay it
[1:33:34] down of myself he chose to lay it
[1:33:38] down he says I have power to lay it down
[1:33:41] and I have power to take it again now he
[1:33:44] knew he had power to lay it down but the
[1:33:46] power to pick it up again was in faith
[1:33:48] in the word he had to believe the same
[1:33:51] way that you and I did church amen he
[1:33:53] says the this commandment I have I
[1:33:55] received of My Father Like I said Jesus
[1:33:58] is the word made flesh that word is
[1:34:00] imprinted in him and yet the flesh would
[1:34:02] not desire to go through what he's about
[1:34:05] to go through the beatings the whipping
[1:34:07] the nakedness the public shame and then
[1:34:10] to finish it off crucifixion amen his
[1:34:12] heart's desire is to fulfill the word
[1:34:14] but he's got a complete revelation of
[1:34:17] the pain and suffering that's coming his
[1:34:19] way and in his flesh he does not want to
[1:34:22] go through it
[1:34:24] nobody wants to go through a beating
[1:34:26] nobody wants to go through a hard time
[1:34:28] nobody wants to be stripped naked in
[1:34:29] public nobody wants to do that amen
[1:34:33] testing isn't easy for anyone including
[1:34:36] Jesus and he knows what's coming through
[1:34:38] there and and you talk about a crushing
[1:34:40] weight that's on him we look at what it
[1:34:42] talks about him in the Garden of
[1:34:44] Gethsemane and says and he was withdrawn
[1:34:46] from them about a Stones cast and kneel
[1:34:48] down and prayed saying father if thou be
[1:34:51] willing remove this cup from me I don't
[1:34:54] want to do it that's what we would
[1:34:55] say but he says if you're willing he
[1:34:59] says but nevertheless not my will but
[1:35:01] thine be done and there appeared an
[1:35:03] angel unto him from Heaven strengthening
[1:35:05] him and being in agony he prayed more
[1:35:08] earnestly why because he's got to go
[1:35:11] through with it he's chosen to go
[1:35:13] through with it and watch the effect it
[1:35:15] says his sweat was as it were great
[1:35:17] drops of blood falling down on the
[1:35:20] ground church you think you face hard
[1:35:22] decisions this is hard decisions Paul
[1:35:25] said he was he was crushed under despair
[1:35:28] but Paul never Paul never sweated
[1:35:31] blood th this is called hemat hydrosis
[1:35:35] it's an actual medical condition and for
[1:35:37] someone like Jesus who had no known
[1:35:39] diseases or conditions the only thing
[1:35:41] that would cause us would be extreme
[1:35:45] stress sometimes we're laying in bed and
[1:35:47] we can't sleep cuz we're stressed out
[1:35:49] cuz the bank account doesn't have what
[1:35:50] we need in it cuz things just aren't
[1:35:52] going our way we've got a big test
[1:35:53] tomorrow we've got a challenge at work
[1:35:55] we're going to have to stand up for what
[1:35:56] the word says but how many of us have
[1:35:58] sweated
[1:35:59] blood Christ is under such
[1:36:03] extreme revelation of what awaits him
[1:36:07] that it is causing him to swep blood out
[1:36:08] of his
[1:36:11] body so why'd he go
[1:36:14] ahead why did he go ahead blood pouring
[1:36:18] out of his body from the stress and yet
[1:36:21] he says I'll do it
[1:36:25] he was the word made flesh he could not
[1:36:28] deny himself he couldn't deny what he
[1:36:31] was the word will do what the word says
[1:36:33] it was his very makeup his very nature
[1:36:35] was to do what the word said because he
[1:36:38] was the word but Paul would say it this
[1:36:40] way looking back at Gethsemane he says
[1:36:42] looking unto Jesus the author and
[1:36:44] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[1:36:47] that was set before him endured the
[1:36:50] cross despising the shame and is set
[1:36:52] down at the right hand of the Throne of
[1:36:54] God in other words Jesus was looking at
[1:36:56] what awaited him at the end of the trial
[1:36:59] to take him through the trial he was
[1:37:02] saying what's going to be at the end is
[1:37:03] worth going through what faces me in the
[1:37:05] next couple of days amen he understood
[1:37:08] the pain but beyond the pain he saw a
[1:37:10] joy that was greater than raising the
[1:37:12] dead and Healing The Sick because what
[1:37:14] he saw at the end there was a
[1:37:16] restoration of the family of God into
[1:37:18] relationship with God that was the great
[1:37:21] joy he saw it was you and I he was he
[1:37:23] was looking and he saw you and I at the
[1:37:25] end of this amen he saw Paradise opened
[1:37:27] up he saw the righteous gathered back to
[1:37:29] God not just the temporal healing of our
[1:37:31] bodies and sicknesses and issues but he
[1:37:34] saw an eternal value that was going to
[1:37:36] come out of this life that he gave amen
[1:37:39] so he gave up his position he gave up
[1:37:41] his power he gave up his authority he
[1:37:43] gave up his own will for you and me and
[1:37:48] he took my sin and he took your sin upon
[1:37:50] him and everyone else's sin and it
[1:37:52] dropped on him
[1:37:54] Paul says this it says for he ha made
[1:37:56] him to be sin for us who knew no sin
[1:37:59] that we might be made the righteousness
[1:38:00] of God in him Church what he's saying
[1:38:02] there is he literally became our
[1:38:06] sin he was our literal sin remember he
[1:38:09] was God
[1:38:11] manifested and now he becomes sin
[1:38:15] manifested you talk about a paradox you
[1:38:17] talk about a a paradigm shift he goes
[1:38:21] from the highest of the high to to the
[1:38:23] lowest of the low in a moment he goes
[1:38:26] from being Anointed God in flesh to the
[1:38:30] entire weight of all of our sins every
[1:38:33] sick thought every nasty thing every
[1:38:35] horrible thing drops on him and in a
[1:38:38] moment he is separated from
[1:38:43] God he goes from Anointed God to
[1:38:46] rejected of God that's what the book of
[1:38:48] Isaiah says
[1:38:51] rejected he went from being pleased
[1:38:53] pleasing to God to not even be able to
[1:38:56] be in his
[1:38:57] presence a total separation from God in
[1:39:01] a moment that's what he chose for you
[1:39:03] and I
[1:39:04] church he went from Jesus the Christ to
[1:39:07] Jesus of
[1:39:09] Nazareth of his own free will and died
[1:39:12] in agony on a cross screaming my God my
[1:39:17] God why hast Thou forsaken
[1:39:19] me total separation total darkness from
[1:39:22] God and yet his love for us the joy that
[1:39:25] he saw kept him nailed to that cross he
[1:39:27] could have left remember what he told
[1:39:30] pilate he said I can call for 12 Legions
[1:39:33] of angels He could have left at any time
[1:39:36] as they started ripping the flesh off of
[1:39:38] his back he could have said take me
[1:39:40] out as they were punching him in the
[1:39:42] face and pressing the Thorns into his
[1:39:44] head he could have said take me away as
[1:39:47] he's up there on the cross heaving
[1:39:49] trying to catch his breath he could have
[1:39:50] said take me away I don't want to finish
[1:39:53] finished the work but he didn't because
[1:39:57] he saw what was waiting at the
[1:40:04] end that God should love a sinner such
[1:40:07] as
[1:40:11] I can you imagine that
[1:40:14] transition from absolute Purity and
[1:40:16] righteousness into total filth what that
[1:40:19] would do to us and yet his body was
[1:40:22] built to handle the trial to handle the
[1:40:26] test that body was built to take the
[1:40:29] pain and the suffering and the anguish
[1:40:31] of total separation from God from
[1:40:33] physical pain humiliation his body was
[1:40:37] built to bear that
[1:40:38] burden I don't care where you're at this
[1:40:40] morning you're built to Bear the burden
[1:40:43] because you're a part of the word the
[1:40:45] same as he was the part of the word Paul
[1:40:47] said this he says there has no
[1:40:49] temptation taken you but such is common
[1:40:51] to men in other words what God puts on
[1:40:54] you is not above your
[1:40:57] Humanity God's not putting a
[1:40:59] supernatural burden on your on your on
[1:41:01] your natural body but what he's given
[1:41:04] you you're able to handle he says but
[1:41:06] God is faithful who will not suffer you
[1:41:08] to be tempted above that ye are able but
[1:41:11] will with the Temptation also make a way
[1:41:14] to escape that ye may be able to Bear it
[1:41:18] that word temptation see we think that's
[1:41:20] about well you know don't look at this
[1:41:21] or don't do this or that but it doesn't
[1:41:24] it means to stay with the word of God
[1:41:27] that word temptation means the trial of
[1:41:29] a person's Fidelity their integrity
[1:41:32] their virtue or their constancy he says
[1:41:36] it's the same Temptation by which the
[1:41:38] devil sought to divert Jesus the Messiah
[1:41:41] from his Divine errand so in other words
[1:41:43] the trial of your faith the Temptation
[1:41:44] that you face in life is trying to get
[1:41:46] you away from your Divine errand what's
[1:41:49] that to fulfill the word of God for your
[1:41:52] age to to be what God has called you to
[1:41:54] be everything that Satan is doing is
[1:41:56] trying to claw you away from the word
[1:41:58] and say I give up it's not for me and
[1:42:01] it's only in a little spot
[1:42:03] usually he's not trying to take you out
[1:42:05] of church he's trying to take you out of
[1:42:07] the
[1:42:07] word you can keep coming to church and
[1:42:09] you keep making decisions that you turn
[1:42:11] away the word in this spot this spot
[1:42:13] what happens is it's a crack and it
[1:42:14] grows throughout your foundation and
[1:42:16] pretty soon Life Starts to crumble
[1:42:17] because your foundation's
[1:42:19] broken doubt and fear are cancer to a
[1:42:22] believer
[1:42:23] and they crack that Foundation amen when
[1:42:25] we get away from the word of God but
[1:42:28] Christ was built to take this amen and
[1:42:29] he did he endured as a man he went to
[1:42:32] the whipping post as a man he didn't
[1:42:33] give up at any time he held himself
[1:42:35] there and in the end he gave his very
[1:42:38] life because he believed the word that
[1:42:40] said he'd pick it up
[1:42:42] again we have to lay our lives into God
[1:42:46] into his hands but Christ we don't just
[1:42:48] lay our life we he we don't lay our life
[1:42:50] he had to give his life
[1:42:53] we give our lives and we stay alive he
[1:42:55] had to give his literal life believing
[1:42:58] the word that says he'd raise him up he
[1:42:59] would not suffer his body to see
[1:43:01] corruption
[1:43:03] amen he goes to the cross and he dies
[1:43:06] before the other two thieves do why he
[1:43:10] didn't die from blood loss he didn't die
[1:43:12] from shock he died before the two of
[1:43:14] those because he chose to remember what
[1:43:17] he says on the cross he says it is
[1:43:19] finished he had fulfilled all that he
[1:43:21] needed to fulfill up to that point
[1:43:23] and all that was left was to give his
[1:43:25] life and so he said it is finished and
[1:43:27] he gave up the ghost he gave his life
[1:43:30] away he released it he set it away
[1:43:33] amen it's finished and maybe like
[1:43:36] Joseph's life there was many thousands
[1:43:38] of years before looking from an outside
[1:43:40] view that looked like the darkest moment
[1:43:41] in
[1:43:42] history the Son of God dead laid in a
[1:43:46] tomb the Earth broke open in a in an
[1:43:48] earthquake and the sun was hidden for
[1:43:51] three hours I think it was and and the
[1:43:53] Earth was just declaring the enormity of
[1:43:55] what had just happened God had died the
[1:43:59] Flesh of God had died if we want to put
[1:44:00] it that way and then a body broken
[1:44:03] destroyed laying dead all the hopes of
[1:44:06] that Messiah crumbled and broken laying
[1:44:08] in a tomb that he didn't even
[1:44:10] know but under the surface
[1:44:13] Hallelujah there was something going on
[1:44:15] that nobody could
[1:44:17] see there was something happening when
[1:44:19] he died that made an eternal impact
[1:44:23] moving forward for the rest of humanity
[1:44:25] amen because the man Jesus Christ
[1:44:27] stepped into his theophany he stepped
[1:44:30] into his spiritual body and he went
[1:44:32] somewhere
[1:44:34] amen why he kept walking with the
[1:44:38] word I want to this is a long set of
[1:44:40] quotes as we start to close this morning
[1:44:42] I've got two pages left he says then
[1:44:44] where did he go when a man dies does
[1:44:47] that finish it no sir he had to die that
[1:44:49] way because God's Bible said he would
[1:44:51] die that way he says and he trusted
[1:44:54] God's word that's the reason he could
[1:44:56] say in his life destroy this Temple and
[1:44:58] I'll raise it up in 3 days he knew that
[1:45:00] God's word could not fail oh my if he
[1:45:03] could rest solemnly upon that believing
[1:45:05] that God's word could not fail how much
[1:45:08] more can we rest as solemnly that we
[1:45:10] have been born again by the Holy Ghost
[1:45:12] and it a witness in our heart right now
[1:45:15] that we know that Our Redeemer Lives and
[1:45:17] will come again someday he said rest
[1:45:19] assured that those that are in Christ
[1:45:21] will God bring with them he says there
[1:45:23] he was he knew that not one cell of that
[1:45:26] body could corrupt 72 hours corruption
[1:45:29] sets in that's the reason he never
[1:45:31] stayed the three days he died on Friday
[1:45:33] afternoon and was up on Sunday morning
[1:45:35] but it was within those three days
[1:45:37] within those three days he was to rise
[1:45:39] again because he trusted God's word he
[1:45:43] says here he goes where did he go when
[1:45:45] he left the Bible said he descended he
[1:45:47] went and preached to the souls that were
[1:45:49] in prison that repented not in the
[1:45:52] longsuffering of the days of Noah his
[1:45:54] soul his Spirit his theophany of his own
[1:45:57] being went down he says let's follow
[1:46:01] him up on Earth they're mourning they're
[1:46:04] crying they've lost
[1:46:06] hope and yet the word is still being
[1:46:08] fulfilled right beneath
[1:46:10] them he says I can see him on that
[1:46:13] Friday afternoon after his death knock
[1:46:16] on the door of the regions of the Lost
[1:46:18] let's follow him a minute he says the
[1:46:20] door opens there was women there was men
[1:46:22] there were young ladies they were old
[1:46:23] they were all together in that hideous
[1:46:25] place called the prison of the Lost
[1:46:26] Souls but in that mournful place there
[1:46:29] Jesus walked to the door everything had
[1:46:31] to witness he was the son of God because
[1:46:33] they had been preached to in the long
[1:46:35] suffering of the days of Noah and they
[1:46:37] were without Mercy without hope because
[1:46:40] they had transgressed and the door was
[1:46:42] shut in their face he says and he knocks
[1:46:45] on the door of hell he said I am he who
[1:46:48] Enoch spoke of I'm the seed of the woman
[1:46:50] that was to bruise the Serpent's head
[1:46:53] every word of God has been fulfilled
[1:46:55] I've just died Yonder at Calvary and I
[1:46:57] have purchased my church he says and
[1:47:00] when he did the devil came out and I can
[1:47:02] just hear him say oh you so you finally
[1:47:04] arrived I sure thought I had you when I
[1:47:06] killed Abel he says you see when that
[1:47:08] seed was promised in the Garden of Eden
[1:47:11] the devil had constantly tried to
[1:47:13] destroy that seed and the seed of Abel
[1:47:16] and the coming of Seth was just the
[1:47:18] death burial and resurrection of Christ
[1:47:20] that seed must continue and he tried to
[1:47:22] destroy it he Saidi thought I had you
[1:47:24] when I destroyed Abel I thought I had
[1:47:26] you when I destroyed the prophets I was
[1:47:27] positive I had you when I beheaded John
[1:47:30] but now after all you've arrived I've
[1:47:32] got you
[1:47:33] now can you imagine all those people
[1:47:36] sitting there listening to this
[1:47:37] conversation going back and
[1:47:39] forth he says I can hear him say Satan
[1:47:43] come here he says he is boss now reaches
[1:47:47] over and grabs the key of death and hell
[1:47:49] off his side hung it on his own side he
[1:47:51] says I want to serve notice on you
[1:47:54] you've been a bluff long enough he says
[1:47:57] I am the Virgin born son of the Living
[1:47:59] God my blood is still wet on the cross
[1:48:01] and the full debt is paid you have
[1:48:03] rights no more you are stripped give me
[1:48:06] those keys he says that's right turns
[1:48:09] around and gives him a good healthy kick
[1:48:11] and slams the door together and says
[1:48:12] stay in there I'm boss from now on
[1:48:16] Hallelujah he says he had the keys to
[1:48:19] death in hell and he took them after his
[1:48:21] resurrection he said I've got the keys
[1:48:23] of death and Hell Peter had the Keys of
[1:48:25] the Kingdom Satan had the keys of death
[1:48:27] and hell but now Jesus has got them he's
[1:48:29] boss here he starts up it's getting
[1:48:31] Easter time is passing fast now we can
[1:48:35] sit there and we can Rejoice on that but
[1:48:37] I want you to recognize something
[1:48:39] because there's something else going on
[1:48:41] in the background because there's people
[1:48:43] that have been laying in the regions of
[1:48:46] the Lost for thousands of
[1:48:49] years Abraham Isaac Jacob Sarah David
[1:48:56] Samuel in a place set aside they can't
[1:48:59] go into the presence of God under the
[1:49:00] blood of bulls and goats they live their
[1:49:02] entire lives by the word and the promise
[1:49:05] of God and then they die and where do
[1:49:07] they go not into the presence of God and
[1:49:10] for thousands of years they stay
[1:49:13] there and they say we live by his word
[1:49:16] we die by his word but where is his word
[1:49:24] where's the
[1:49:26] promise why is God not with us thousands
[1:49:30] of years but I don't believe they were
[1:49:32] sitting there like that church I they I
[1:49:34] believe they were saying he's coming
[1:49:36] he's coming he promised he's coming and
[1:49:38] so he's coming
[1:49:40] amen but yet they were not in the
[1:49:42] presence of God and so when Christ comes
[1:49:44] down and starts speaking I believe Faith
[1:49:46] started to lift up a little bit more and
[1:49:48] they said here we go here we go he says
[1:49:50] but there is another group where is
[1:49:53] where's Abraham where are they at where
[1:49:55] are those fellows that trusted God's
[1:49:56] word has he forgotten them did Death
[1:49:58] annihilate them was that all of it he
[1:50:00] says never never God has to keep his
[1:50:04] word he says I can see him and I see
[1:50:06] Abraham and Sarah walking around there
[1:50:08] and after a while something knocks on
[1:50:10] the door Abraham goes and opens the door
[1:50:12] and says honey come here look here look
[1:50:15] here that's the very same one that stood
[1:50:17] with me under the oak that day he's
[1:50:19] Abraham's God we've been speaking on the
[1:50:22] godhead and Abraham sees that man and he
[1:50:25] says that's him that's him that's him I
[1:50:28] recognize him does he look the say no
[1:50:31] but it's him I recognize him why cuz
[1:50:34] he's fulfilling his word he's finishing
[1:50:37] the job he says then I see Daniel
[1:50:40] looking over his shoulder and say that's
[1:50:42] the rock that was hewed out of the
[1:50:43] mountain just as certain as I'm standing
[1:50:45] here I see job raise up and say that's
[1:50:48] my redeemer that I said I knew that
[1:50:49] lived and someday he would stand upon
[1:50:51] the Earth my body may not be but a
[1:50:53] little Spoonful Of Ashes but in 15
[1:50:56] minutes from now I'll be in it again he
[1:50:58] says that's him Ezekiel looked over the
[1:51:00] top and said I've seen that same person
[1:51:02] as a wheel in the middle of the wheel
[1:51:04] turning way up there in the middle of
[1:51:06] the air then up comes Enoch and Enoch
[1:51:09] said I saw him coming with 10,000s of
[1:51:11] his Saints to execute judgment there was
[1:51:14] the Old Testament
[1:51:16] Saint
[1:51:17] waiting sure they were under the
[1:51:20] atonement of blood they could not go in
[1:51:23] the presence of God God Of Heaven
[1:51:24] because gold and sheep blood could not
[1:51:26] take away sin but he said my brethren
[1:51:28] I'm the one that you think I am I'm the
[1:51:30] seed of that woman I'm the son of David
[1:51:32] I'm the Son of God I'm the Virgin born
[1:51:34] one my blood has atoned for it you
[1:51:36] waited under the blood of sheep and
[1:51:38] goats but now my blood atones and you're
[1:51:40] free he says let's go up it's getting
[1:51:44] almost Easter Hallelujah in the moment
[1:51:47] in a twinkling of an
[1:51:50] eye you look at the scriptures remember
[1:51:53] this happened really really
[1:51:55] fast cuz Christ doesn't come up for 3
[1:51:58] days but the scripture says as soon as
[1:52:00] this happens the graves are opened
[1:52:03] literally boom
[1:52:07] done and all of a sudden Abraham and
[1:52:09] Sarah are walking around Jerusalem and
[1:52:12] they were seen of many people for days
[1:52:15] and days and days and then they're
[1:52:16] caught up with Christ
[1:52:19] amen he says oh that glorious on that
[1:52:22] glor glorious Easter morning when he
[1:52:23] rose from the dead the Bible said
[1:52:25] according to St Matthew 27 that many of
[1:52:27] the saints that slept in the dust of the
[1:52:29] earth Rose and come out of the graves
[1:52:31] who was it Abraham Isaac Jacob job those
[1:52:34] who by spiritually revealed Revelation
[1:52:37] knew that the Redeemer would stand on
[1:52:39] the earth someday he says that's them
[1:52:42] the first fruits of those that slept
[1:52:44] there they walked in the city I can see
[1:52:46] Sarah and Abraham young and handsome and
[1:52:48] full of life never to be old no more
[1:52:51] never to be sick no more never to hunger
[1:52:54] no more walking around in their body see
[1:52:59] Sarah had a body change before but this
[1:53:01] was a body change that would never
[1:53:03] change Sarah still died Abraham still
[1:53:05] died even after their body change but
[1:53:07] this was now the word being truly
[1:53:09] fulfilled remember what Peter said
[1:53:11] waiting for a Salvation to be revealed
[1:53:13] in times ahead this was Abraham and
[1:53:16] Sarah's salvation in times ahead they
[1:53:18] got the fullness of a body change they
[1:53:20] got the fullness of their salvation
[1:53:22] Church you look at Abraham's life was
[1:53:24] his life the harder way you compare him
[1:53:27] to lot who had the harder life up front
[1:53:31] lot's was a lot
[1:53:32] easier but in the end what did lot have
[1:53:34] he' lost his wife to
[1:53:36] Salt he had incestual relationships with
[1:53:39] his daughters to turn into thorns in the
[1:53:42] side of the people of
[1:53:44] God Abraham's walking around intense
[1:53:48] Dusty windy noisy smelly
[1:53:52] but in the end Abraham's way though
[1:53:55] harder brought the greater the greater
[1:53:57] reward
[1:53:58] amen but he died remember the scripture
[1:54:01] says in Hebrews says these all died
[1:54:04] having not received the
[1:54:05] promise but on Easter morning they
[1:54:08] received the promise they received the
[1:54:11] full promise and they waited in faith
[1:54:13] all that time believing that he would
[1:54:16] come and get them
[1:54:18] amen Church you're here to walk the
[1:54:22] harder way
[1:54:23] way and you're built for it you're meant
[1:54:25] for it amen it's a part of you you can't
[1:54:27] deny this anymore than you could walk
[1:54:29] away from your own skin because you're a
[1:54:32] part of the word we sing that song
[1:54:34] something keeps holding
[1:54:35] me there's times where we get so tired
[1:54:39] there's times where I don't feel like
[1:54:40] studying there's times I don't feel like
[1:54:41] preaching but guess what I get up and I
[1:54:43] do it anyways there's times where I
[1:54:45] don't feel like reading my Bible but
[1:54:47] guess what I read it anyways there's
[1:54:49] times where I don't feel very spiritual
[1:54:51] but that doesn't change anything
[1:54:52] that's just feelings that's just mental
[1:54:54] battles that's just struggles that's
[1:54:56] just tiredness that comes in this life
[1:54:58] but something happens and something
[1:54:59] Rises up and I put another foot forward
[1:55:02] that's all I'm asking you this morning
[1:55:03] to do is keep putting your feet forward
[1:55:06] there's joy in the morning amen weeping
[1:55:10] only lasts for a night the song says
[1:55:13] It's always darkest right before the sun
[1:55:15] comes up they say but there's joy that
[1:55:17] comes in that morning amen you're meant
[1:55:19] to produce the word for this age amen
[1:55:22] trust God if you're weak this morning
[1:55:24] ask him for strength don't try and go
[1:55:27] through it like
[1:55:28] you're you know King
[1:55:32] Kong say Lord I need you Lord I'm
[1:55:36] struggling Lord It's a battle Lord you
[1:55:37] see my faith is being tested Lord you
[1:55:40] see the struggles you see the weight I'm
[1:55:42] bearing you see where my mind's at Lord
[1:55:44] will you give me a peace and a rest
[1:55:48] amen you know we think the harder way
[1:55:50] and I'm sure when I said that that title
[1:55:52] we go back to what happened with brother
[1:55:54] brandom and remember what happens is
[1:55:56] he's in a meeting and there's a message
[1:55:57] given in tongues to
[1:56:00] him it says because thou Hast chosen the
[1:56:03] narrow way the Narrow Path the harder
[1:56:06] way thou Hast walked of thine own
[1:56:10] choosing he says Thou H has picked the
[1:56:12] correct and precise decision and it is
[1:56:14] my way because of this momentous
[1:56:16] decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits
[1:56:19] thee what a glorious decision thou Hast
[1:56:21] made
[1:56:23] and he would say that's what he says I
[1:56:24] know what that means because I've I've
[1:56:26] seen beyond the vi you know I went
[1:56:28] beyond the curtain of time and I saw
[1:56:30] that bride that was there that end time
[1:56:32] bride that comes out of that seventh
[1:56:34] Church age under my Ministry and he says
[1:56:36] and I recognize that but he would say I
[1:56:38] don't know what this next purse means he
[1:56:40] says this in itself is that which will
[1:56:43] give and make come to pass their
[1:56:45] tremendous victory in the love divine he
[1:56:47] said what does that mean he says I'm not
[1:56:48] really sure near the end of his ministry
[1:56:50] I believe he understood it but up front
[1:56:51] he didn't know what it was was but
[1:56:53] there's a beautiful promise there but
[1:56:54] watch what he says now he says why he
[1:56:57] says why did I get this why is this was
[1:57:00] this message given to me why did God
[1:57:02] affirm me this way he says not because
[1:57:05] we had to do it he says he didn't beat
[1:57:08] me into it he didn't force me into it he
[1:57:09] didn't say you got to pick this way he
[1:57:12] says and not because it's just an easy
[1:57:14] way he says you can be popular you'd be
[1:57:17] have everybody patting you on the back
[1:57:19] money flowing in from everywhere for
[1:57:21] radio or television and so forth he says
[1:57:23] they would just take it and televise it
[1:57:25] but he says I don't believe in taking
[1:57:27] God's things and putting them out on
[1:57:28] such vulgarity and stuff of the world I
[1:57:30] don't believe in all this hooping up and
[1:57:32] making something that isn't I believe in
[1:57:35] just letting it alone wait he says God
[1:57:39] he's God let him do with it what he
[1:57:41] wants to we are servants just serve the
[1:57:44] Lord just do as God said this is where I
[1:57:47] want to finish this morning he says man
[1:57:50] in the midst of it all though is for
[1:57:52] forced to make a decision amen God bless
[1:57:55] you let's stand if you
[1:57:57] would forced to make a
[1:58:00] decision my way or his
[1:58:02] way the hard way or the harder
[1:58:07] way and the thing that gets us through
[1:58:09] the harder way is the fact that we can
[1:58:10] see there's something that's waiting at
[1:58:12] the end amen amen you got to give up
[1:58:15] what you have now temporally for
[1:58:17] something that's Eternal at the end and
[1:58:20] that's all that the decision to serve
[1:58:21] Christ is is that you say I'm going to
[1:58:22] lay down this so I can gain that amen
[1:58:26] and if we can keep our mind on that if
[1:58:29] we can keep our mind that he promised
[1:58:31] that there's a purpose for every trial
[1:58:34] for every sickness for every situation
[1:58:36] for every hardship for every season that
[1:58:38] we struggle in it'll help us get through
[1:58:41] that remember what Paul said
[1:58:44] though Rejoice ever more pray without
[1:58:48] ceasing and give thanks in everything
[1:58:51] for this is the will of God in Christ
[1:58:53] Jesus concerning you amen it's all in
[1:58:56] his hands there's a purpose there's a
[1:58:59] plan for it Christians are the only
[1:59:01] people in this world that suffer for
[1:59:03] their own good and it's the purpose and
[1:59:05] it's the plan of God so where you're
[1:59:07] struggling this morning and when I say
[1:59:09] struggling I don't mean where you're
[1:59:10] weak but where there is a battle this
[1:59:12] morning recognize there's a victory
[1:59:14] waiting at the end of this that's far
[1:59:16] greater than what's gone into it amen
[1:59:19] there's a law of physics that says you
[1:59:21] can't it out more than you put in God is
[1:59:24] outside of that God takes what you do
[1:59:26] and puts in and he multiplies it and he
[1:59:28] makes it an
[1:59:29] overabundance above what you could ever
[1:59:31] ask or think amen that's the kind of God
[1:59:33] we're serving this morning when we give
[1:59:35] up our will when we give up our mind
[1:59:37] when we give up our desires and we say
[1:59:39] Lord I'll take the way with your
[1:59:41] despised few he says that's wonderful he
[1:59:43] says I'll give you more than you could
[1:59:44] ever contain in this life and in the
[1:59:46] Life to Come amen haven't we haven't we
[1:59:49] got a testimony of that this morning
[1:59:51] that he's always brought us through and
[1:59:54] it's been better on the other side than
[1:59:56] it was where we started amen amen let's
[1:59:59] go to him now Heavenly
[2:00:02] Father Lord you've called us on a
[2:00:05] highway lord it's a it's a highway of
[2:00:07] hardship it's a Highway of Holiness it's
[2:00:09] a highway of Separation Lord It's a
[2:00:12] highway of surrender Lord and there's a
[2:00:14] great battle that goes on between our
[2:00:16] soul and this flesh that wants its own
[2:00:18] way but Lord we're committing ourselves
[2:00:21] to your word by by your spirit this
[2:00:22] morning Lord that as we Face these
[2:00:25] situations we Face decisions day by day
[2:00:28] that we would look to the end and decide
[2:00:31] based on that Heavenly Father Lord that
[2:00:33] we would see the promise of your word
[2:00:35] Lord and that promise Lord that
[2:00:36] Revelation that your word can never fail
[2:00:39] will carry us through Lord God lord you
[2:00:42] see your children here this morning Lord
[2:00:44] we have many needs we have those that
[2:00:46] aren't here because they are sick this
[2:00:47] morning Lord I pray that your spirit
[2:00:49] would go to them Lord that it would
[2:00:51] bring Deliverance that it would bring
[2:00:53] healing to the home Lord that it would
[2:00:54] go to a hospital bed and it would bring
[2:00:56] a total Deliverance for Young Noah Lord
[2:00:59] that it would come into our lives that
[2:01:00] we would come into our families our
[2:01:02] marriages Lord that our decisions could
[2:01:04] reflect the fullness of the word of God
[2:01:07] Lord that we might receive the joy that
[2:01:08] comes at the end of those things Lord
[2:01:10] Jesus Lord give us strength for the
[2:01:12] battle Lord I know many are weary
[2:01:17] here Lord Satan's a good
[2:01:19] battler Lord he always comes at us he
[2:01:22] never stops Lord but your word says when
[2:01:24] the enemy comes in like a flood the
[2:01:26] spirit of God will raise up a standard
[2:01:29] Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would
[2:01:30] raise up a standard this morning Lord
[2:01:33] that it would bring the word to our
[2:01:34] remembrance Lord that we would seek it
[2:01:35] out and that you would pour more of
[2:01:37] yourself in Lord God Lord that they
[2:01:39] could see that you're on their side Lord
[2:01:43] that you back up your word in their
[2:01:45] lives Lord may we have a testimony day
