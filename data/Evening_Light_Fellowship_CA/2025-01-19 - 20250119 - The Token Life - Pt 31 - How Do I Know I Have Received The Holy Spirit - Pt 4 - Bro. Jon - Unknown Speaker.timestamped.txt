[43:27] and we can just enter into worship
[43:29] together it makes a difference in the
[43:30] service so God bless you each one for
[43:33] doing that amen we remember Sister Becky
[43:36] of course is has not been feeling well
[43:37] she's home sick this morning brother
[43:39] Doug Gail also wanted to bring another
[43:41] prayer request my friend Roy from that
[43:43] that I've dealt with through work um
[43:46] he's come he sits at the back you
[43:47] remember the east Indian young man he's
[43:49] in India now for a couple of months with
[43:51] his mother she's quite sick he hasn't
[43:53] shared with me the details he's he's
[43:55] quite personal about these things but
[43:57] he's over there trying to deal with that
[43:59] so we're asking God's grace I told him I
[44:00] would mention it I'd be praying but I
[44:02] bring it to the saints that God would
[44:04] move there not just in her life and her
[44:06] body but in his as well amen we want to
[44:08] remember also Martha Penney brother Mark
[44:10] and sister Morin's daughter who is
[44:12] supposed to be having a baby very soon
[44:14] it's been a couple days now since
[44:15] they've induced but uh we want to just
[44:18] remember her and her husband Chris that
[44:20] all will go well she's she's not a young
[44:22] chicken anymore that's for sure and so
[44:25] we want God to just grant Grace to her
[44:27] and to the baby as well amen amen
[44:29] Matthew 7:1 15 says this beware of false
[44:33] prophets which come to you in sheep's
[44:35] clothing but inwardly they are ravening
[44:38] wolves ye shall know them by their
[44:41] fruits do men gather Grapes of thorns or
[44:44] figs of thistles even so every good tree
[44:47] bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt
[44:49] tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good
[44:52] tree cannot bring forth evil fruit
[44:54] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[44:56] good good fruit every tree that bringeth
[44:59] not forth good fruit is heun down and
[45:01] cast Into the Fire wherefore by their
[45:04] fruits ye shall know them amen God bless
[45:07] you you can have your seats this morning
[45:08] we're continuing our service or our
[45:10] series on the Holy Spirit and I want to
[45:12] take a thought again of how do I know I
[45:14] have received the Holy Spirit and as you
[45:16] can imagine by our scripture this
[45:18] morning we're going to be focusing on
[45:19] the fruit of the spirit but not so much
[45:22] this this morning I want to set a
[45:23] foundation set an example in the word
[45:25] and then by God's grace next Wednesday
[45:27] we will go into the the fruit of the
[45:29] spirit itself but we covered a lot of
[45:30] ground last service um what is the
[45:32] evidence of the Holy Spirit and we said
[45:34] that it is to receive the word amen we
[45:37] spoke how that he will the Holy Spirit
[45:39] if you've received him will lead you
[45:41] into all truth he'll guide you into all
[45:42] truth but not just for the purpose of
[45:44] knowledge but for the it's for the
[45:46] purpose of manifestation it's so that
[45:48] you can be the word amen and it will
[45:50] cause you to grow and mature in Christ
[45:53] and we talked about how there's a word
[45:54] for a young Christian there's a word for
[45:57] a a a middle-aged Christian and then
[45:59] there's a word for an experienced
[46:00] Christian if we could put it that way
[46:01] and that's not based on your age in this
[46:03] world but it's based on how long you've
[46:05] been serving Christ and we talked about
[46:07] how Paul said to desire Peter said to
[46:09] desire the sincere milk of the word if
[46:11] you're early in your relationship with
[46:13] Christ if you've just received the Holy
[46:15] Spirit don't try and live above your
[46:16] experience get the things settled in
[46:18] your life you know and we talked about a
[46:20] a Sanctified life and getting your
[46:22] clothes right and getting your your your
[46:24] friendships right and getting your job
[46:26] right and and getting your priorities
[46:28] right and then after that God starts to
[46:29] work then on your your attitude and your
[46:31] motives and your objectives and your
[46:33] your nature and these different things
[46:34] and how we look at situations and so you
[46:37] take the principles and you learn those
[46:39] as you're early in your walk and then
[46:40] you start to apply them and they start
[46:42] to have a greater and greater effect in
[46:44] your life until your life is now being
[46:45] lived by the word and it's the word that
[46:48] starts to produce itself through you
[46:50] amen amen but we want to know that the
[46:52] word is our foundation it is everything
[46:54] we build on is on the word of God we
[46:56] don't don't build our Christian walk on
[46:58] an experience we don't build our
[46:59] Christian walk on a church or on a camp
[47:02] or what we did or what we didn't do amen
[47:04] if our experience lines up perfectly
[47:06] with the word of God then what do we do
[47:08] we place it on the word we don't we
[47:11] don't we don't place our life on our
[47:13] experience we place our life on the word
[47:15] so if our experience matches up with the
[47:17] word then we place it on there and we
[47:18] can build on that because it matches up
[47:20] but our resting place is not in the
[47:22] experience our resting place is that our
[47:24] word our life lines up with the word of
[47:26] God that's what we're trusting in now
[47:28] Paul would talk about this in the
[47:30] Corinthian Church and let me say this
[47:31] church if we want to stay humble I
[47:33] suggest we read the the books of
[47:35] Corinthians because that was the most
[47:37] problematic church that Paul had and
[47:38] you'll see the greatest correction comes
[47:40] through the Corinthians because they
[47:41] were a young
[47:43] church this wasn't Paul's Church Paul's
[47:45] church was Ephesus but we have
[47:47] Corinthians amongst us we're all we all
[47:49] have a little bit of Corinthian in us if
[47:51] I could say that this morning amen we
[47:53] all have a little bit of the Corinthian
[47:54] Church inside of us and that's because
[47:56] we're growing we're growing we're
[47:58] maturing we're not at the the Apex of
[48:01] our of our Christian walk yet we haven't
[48:03] gone in a resurrection in a Rapture and
[48:05] so we've got all a little bit of the
[48:07] Corinthian Church inside of us if I can
[48:09] put it that way whether we want to admit
[48:10] it or not and Paul says this he says for
[48:13] other Foundation can no man lay than
[48:16] that which is laid which is Jesus Christ
[48:19] it's amazing I've said before the
[48:20] Catholic church so many times that that
[48:22] they picked Peter as The Rock on which
[48:25] the church is built and and Paul comes
[48:27] along the prophet to the age and he says
[48:29] you can't lay any other Foundation
[48:31] except one and that's Jesus Christ the
[48:34] Revelation that we are basing our
[48:36] Christian walk on is the revelation of
[48:38] Jesus Christ and that's what Peter got
[48:41] who do you say that am he said Thou Art
[48:43] the Christ the son of the Living God
[48:46] that was the rock for Peter's Foundation
[48:48] that was the rock that the church was
[48:50] built on Amen and so we've got to be
[48:52] built on the word of God as it comes to
[48:54] us listen they had a revelation of Jesus
[48:57] Christ in Luther's day and they had to
[48:59] build on that then they had a greater
[49:00] one in Wesley's day and then when isusa
[49:02] Street came the Pentecostals had even
[49:04] another Revelation but then Malachi 4
[49:07] came and he produced the full foundation
[49:09] so we could produce the full pyramid of
[49:11] the fruits of the spirit in the nature
[49:13] of Jesus Christ today that's what we've
[49:15] got to build on Amen as it comes as the
[49:18] Holy Spirit takes us into it that's what
[49:20] we build our lives on Paul says now if
[49:22] any man build upon this Foundation gold
[49:25] silver precious stones wood hay and
[49:28] stubble now I want you to see something
[49:30] here that's a that's quite a variety of
[49:34] materials and guess who chooses what we
[49:36] build there you
[49:39] do he didn't say if God build he says if
[49:42] any man build so there's a choice here
[49:44] the foundation is chosen for us but
[49:46] what's placed on that is up to us to
[49:49] determine amen and I want you to see
[49:51] here we can build the wrong thing on the
[49:54] right foundation amen you can do the
[49:56] wrong thing for the right reason you can
[49:59] take the word and build a kingdom for
[50:01] yourself build influence build money uh
[50:04] whatever it might be and that doesn't
[50:06] make it right it just means the
[50:07] foundation's right but you'll see people
[50:10] that'll use the foundation of the world
[50:11] to build themselves up instead of Christ
[50:14] up but he says you can build this out of
[50:16] gold silver precious stones wood hay
[50:19] stubble stubble is just what's left in
[50:21] the field after the Harvest is you don't
[50:23] want to build anything out of stubble
[50:26] there's no strength in those sorts of
[50:28] things Paul's saying you can build
[50:29] whatever you want it's up to you but
[50:32] here's the catch verse 13 Every Man's
[50:36] work shall be made manifest in other
[50:39] words it's going to be shown what it
[50:40] really is it's going to shown if it's
[50:41] strong enough he says for the day shall
[50:43] declare it because it shall be revealed
[50:45] by fire and the fire shall try every
[50:48] man's work of what sord it is so there's
[50:51] a trying and a testing and a proving
[50:53] time for everything that we've done in
[50:55] this life and this test is going to
[50:57] prove if it's built to stand if it has
[50:59] Eternal value or if it has temporal
[51:02] value and what's going to test it Church
[51:05] the word it's always judged by the word
[51:08] of God Amen no one escapes this testing
[51:11] the bride doesn't escape this testing
[51:13] Every Man's work is going to go through
[51:15] this and every professing every
[51:17] professing Christians as well he says
[51:19] now in verse 14 if any man's work abide
[51:22] which he had built thereupon he shall
[51:25] receive a reward reward so if our life's
[51:28] work it it can stand the test of God's
[51:31] word then we receive a reward now I'll
[51:34] tell you this I don't this is just me
[51:36] you can take it or leave it I don't
[51:38] believe that that's based on church
[51:40] anity that's based on Church attendance
[51:42] but I believe it's Souls there's only
[51:44] one thing that's going over there church
[51:46] and that's souls and so our reward is
[51:48] those that we have brought to a place
[51:51] where they recognize I am a child of God
[51:54] that's our reward that's waiting for us
[51:56] over there God is interested in Souls
[51:58] Above All Else he says a soul is worth
[52:00] 10,000 worlds that tells me what our
[52:02] reward is going to be I believe is that
[52:04] it's those that we have brought to
[52:06] Christ but he says if any man's work
[52:08] shall be burned he shall suffer loss but
[52:11] he himself shall be saved yet so as by
[52:14] fire if you're a child of God you can't
[52:16] be lost that's what he's saying here you
[52:18] cannot be lost but your work can be for
[52:21] nothing you can come to a place where
[52:23] everything you've done is destroyed
[52:26] and yet your soul is still saved you can
[52:29] waste this life even as a child of God
[52:32] what a shameful place I don't want to be
[52:34] found at that day having wasted my life
[52:37] and just gotten in by the skin of my
[52:38] teeth by predestination anden I want to
[52:41] do what God wants me to do here in this
[52:43] life I don't want to see it all crumble
[52:45] and fade away as that time draws near
[52:48] but that means we've got to check up
[52:49] with the word amen but I want you I want
[52:52] to kind of build a picture this morning
[52:55] because we can look at what Paul's
[52:57] saying here and we can say well that's
[53:00] works because he says if any man's work
[53:03] so we can focus on the idea of Works
[53:06] amen but the the question is what kind
[53:08] of work will stand and what kind of work
[53:10] will fall because I want a work that
[53:12] stands I don't want to go through and
[53:14] put a bunch of effort in and then find
[53:16] out that I did the wrong kind of work
[53:18] now we're preaching this morning on how
[53:20] do I know I've received the Holy Spirit
[53:22] but I want you to see the work that the
[53:24] Holy Spirit does in our lives we finish
[53:26] with this quote last service and I want
[53:28] to pick it up there as we start to paint
[53:30] a picture this morning brother Bram said
[53:32] for the and the word is supposed to
[53:34] transform you from what the things of
[53:37] the world are into the image of Sons and
[53:39] Daughters of God then if you accept that
[53:42] word it'll transform you from a son of
[53:45] the world a daughter of the world to a
[53:47] son and daughter of God he says look at
[53:49] you and here how many have had that
[53:51] experience every one of us we've had
[53:53] that experience because it was spoken
[53:57] God's what the spoken word is the
[53:58] Original Seed the word was spoken it was
[54:01] believed and the word came forth and
[54:04] fell into the bed of the heart and there
[54:06] it grew right out of it he says it's
[54:09] transforming yourself his holy spirit
[54:11] transform the seed word into its
[54:15] likeness like if a pear tree brings
[54:17] forth a pear an apple tree and apple
[54:20] things like that his word will bring
[54:22] forth Sons and Daughters of God that's
[54:25] what it's supposed to to do so the
[54:27] purpose of the holy spirit is to bring
[54:29] life to the seed word of God in every
[54:32] child of God Amen and when the word
[54:34] comes alive it has to produce
[54:37] itself it has to produce itself a pear
[54:40] tree doesn't produce apples a pear tree
[54:42] produces Pairs and so if the word is
[54:44] inside of you and it comes alive it's
[54:46] got to produce the word which will
[54:48] produce a child of God so what does it
[54:51] look like let's go back to our opening
[54:53] scripture and I I I started a bit deeper
[54:55] in it but I to take it from this point
[54:57] this morning a few verses before where
[54:59] we started and Jesus said enter ye in at
[55:02] the Straight Gate that word straight
[55:04] means narrow tight for wide is the gate
[55:08] and Broad is the way that leadth to
[55:10] destruction and many be there be which
[55:12] go therein listen The Wider the door the
[55:15] more people are going to walk through he
[55:17] says because straight is the gate and
[55:20] narrow this word narrow here it means
[55:23] conflicting pressing troublesome
[55:27] if you were to go into the mall and
[55:28] there was a tiny little door and only
[55:30] one person can fit through would you go
[55:33] there and fight with everyone to go
[55:34] through it or would you go to the big
[55:35] broad
[55:36] doors our tendency is to go where life
[55:39] is easy the path of least resistance
[55:41] amen but he says but straight is the
[55:44] gate and narrow conflicting pressing
[55:45] Troublesome is the way which leadth unto
[55:48] life and few there be to that find it so
[55:51] the way to eternal life is narrow it's
[55:53] constricting it's Troublesome it's not
[55:55] easy amen as we walk with God we're
[55:58] going to face hard times and even the
[56:00] entrance to that path is a difficult one
[56:03] because it involves personal death it
[56:05] involves a dying out amen we can't
[56:07] expect to walk into heaven a waltz into
[56:10] heaven perhaps would be a better word on
[56:11] a bed of ease and luxury and comfort and
[56:14] entertainment and everything perfect
[56:16] that's not the way that God promises it
[56:18] he says no it is a tight way it is a
[56:21] narrow way it's a walk a road a journey
[56:24] and it's not a walk that's easy it's not
[56:26] for the faint of heart but it is a path
[56:29] of our own
[56:30] choosing we have so many choices to make
[56:33] and we have results to match our choices
[56:35] and I want to take this from a from a a
[56:37] Viewpoint that brother Bram brings of a
[56:39] quote about brother brandham and lot and
[56:41] he puts it this way we're talking about
[56:42] straight As the gate now he says you see
[56:45] when Abraham was sitting under his tent
[56:48] because he had made a
[56:51] choice lot was sitting in the gate of
[56:53] Sodom and Abraham is sitting in this
[56:57] tent we would look at that and say who's
[56:59] the greater man who's made the better
[57:02] decisions in
[57:04] life he says and that choice he says be
[57:08] because he had made a choice and that
[57:09] choice is brought before every person
[57:11] that's born in this world the tree of
[57:14] Good and Evil is setting before every
[57:15] person and when lot his nephew and their
[57:18] herdsman begin to argue about the
[57:20] grounds Abraham being a just man said to
[57:23] them just let there be no arguments
[57:25] Among Us you you just choose your way of
[57:28] going that place he says comes into
[57:31] every believer's life and it's before
[57:32] you this morning and it's before
[57:34] me he says
[57:37] lot didn't think that he was going to
[57:43] backslide he says but he went to looking
[57:46] towards Sodom where things were easy
[57:48] notice his intention is not to walk away
[57:50] from God the promises of God but his
[57:53] choice was tied to comfort not spiritual
[57:57] growth and lot valued
[58:00] certainty over the promise of God that's
[58:04] what he chose there he says and there
[58:06] are many times we look towards the easy
[58:08] way I'll join the certain certain church
[58:10] and you see nobody will say anything
[58:12] against it because it's the biggest
[58:13] church in the city listen lot was the
[58:15] most spiritual man in lot in
[58:19] Sodom L was the greatest believer there
[58:22] but lot was backslid in church being
[58:24] better than everyone else doesn't
[58:26] doesn't make you right L was still in a
[58:29] backsliding condition even though he was
[58:31] there and because he knew better he was
[58:34] in worse condition than they
[58:37] were because he was where he knew better
[58:39] than to be amen being better doesn't
[58:42] make us right we've got to stay with the
[58:45] word that's where we know that we can be
[58:47] right he says it's the easy way many
[58:49] times we do that when we're wrong that's
[58:53] flat we make the wrong choice he says
[58:56] and Abraham the only thing he could do
[58:58] was take second choice and sometimes
[59:01] second choice is better than first if
[59:03] it's taken like that notice it wasn't
[59:05] long when lot saw the big city but he
[59:08] didn't see his wife turning to a pillar
[59:10] of salt though and he didn't see the
[59:13] fire burning up the city see he couldn't
[59:15] see what was in the future because he
[59:17] was so B he was so focused on what he
[59:20] was going to get out of the
[59:21] deal he says but Abraham took the way
[59:24] with the Lord's despised few he stayed
[59:27] in the deserts he said remember if you
[59:29] follow Christ you'll be hated by people
[59:32] for all that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[59:34] shall suffer persecutions and if you
[59:37] come to Christ you'll not come by any
[59:39] church or any denomination or any Creed
[59:41] we're talking about straight is the way
[59:43] and narrow as the
[59:44] gate he says you'll come by the blood
[59:47] that's the only Avenue in and you cannot
[59:50] bring anyone with you he says you'll
[59:54] come alone and stand on your own
[59:56] confession and your own faith you'll not
[59:59] ride on in on the pastor or on your
[1:00:01] mother's faith you'll come as an
[1:00:03] individual when you come to God he says
[1:00:05] and yet many times we make these foolish
[1:00:08] choices he says you'll never leave that
[1:00:11] door the same person you come in you
[1:00:13] can't do it you've got a choice to make
[1:00:16] make it for Christ this morning they
[1:00:18] thought everything that belonged to the
[1:00:21] church would be saved Jesus said
[1:00:23] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[1:00:25] way and but few there will be that will
[1:00:27] find it he says let me warn you this
[1:00:29] morning church be careful he says these
[1:00:33] words it takes time
[1:00:36] today in our self-righteous
[1:00:39] self-sufficient generation of hypocrisy
[1:00:42] that we're living in we've got to take
[1:00:45] the time to make sure we're on the right
[1:00:49] path and if everybody else is going this
[1:00:52] path let me tell you it's wrong Christ
[1:00:55] is is not found in the mainstream never
[1:00:58] has never will be it's few there be that
[1:01:02] will find
[1:01:03] it why is it a narrow gate because it's
[1:01:06] only one GH through at a
[1:01:08] time like he said I'm not going in cuz
[1:01:10] mama's going in I'm not going in with my
[1:01:11] pastor I'm not going in because I'm
[1:01:13] attending evening Light Fellowship I'm
[1:01:15] going in because I have accepted the
[1:01:18] work of Jesus Christ at Calvary by his
[1:01:20] blood my faith is in the finished work
[1:01:23] and I go through that gate to get into
[1:01:25] him that's the only way that we can come
[1:01:27] in amen we can't say well if you go I'll
[1:01:30] go remember I I've told this before when
[1:01:34] when uh I first asked to get baptized it
[1:01:36] was because Adam was getting baptized
[1:01:38] and Matt was getting baptized and then
[1:01:39] my brother Nate was getting baptized and
[1:01:41] I said I'm going to go in too cuz I was
[1:01:43] worried people will think I was a bad
[1:01:45] kid because I wasn't going to get
[1:01:46] baptized when they were you know what my
[1:01:48] parents did they said no that's not the
[1:01:51] reason to get baptized you're not going
[1:01:53] in because they're going in you got to
[1:01:55] go in because you want to go in amen so
[1:01:58] we don't go in because other people are
[1:02:00] going in we go in because there's
[1:02:02] something inside of us that says I've
[1:02:04] got to walk through that door there's a
[1:02:05] deep that's calling to the deep and
[1:02:07] though we may not go through the first
[1:02:09] time yet we'll keep coming back to that
[1:02:12] door because there's something beyond
[1:02:14] that door that's calling to our soul
[1:02:15] amen there's something inside of us that
[1:02:18] is being pulled to that door as hard as
[1:02:20] narrow as lonely as it is there's
[1:02:23] something that keeps coming back until
[1:02:25] we come to the place where we say I'll
[1:02:27] walk my way with the Lord's despised few
[1:02:29] like that song says though none go with
[1:02:31] me still I will follow I'm going to have
[1:02:33] to leave you guys I'm going on with
[1:02:34] Christ I'm going to go through the
[1:02:37] word Jesus continues he says now here's
[1:02:40] where we started beware of false
[1:02:42] prophets which come to you in sheep's
[1:02:44] clothing but inwardly they are ravening
[1:02:47] wolves so notice the contrast the
[1:02:49] outside looks the same for
[1:02:52] everyone but inside is a destructive
[1:02:54] nature and there their Gain is based on
[1:02:56] your loss if they can take it away from
[1:02:59] you then they're going to benefit amen
[1:03:01] these are not people we want to have in
[1:03:03] in in a position of Authority or
[1:03:05] influence because they'll use it for
[1:03:07] themselves but how are we going to
[1:03:09] recognize them cuz they look just like
[1:03:12] you and
[1:03:13] I they act the same way you and I do it
[1:03:15] would
[1:03:16] seem Jesus gives us the answer verse 16
[1:03:19] he says ye shall know them by their
[1:03:23] fruits do men gather Gra of thorns or
[1:03:26] figs of
[1:03:28] thistles no if you wonder what the
[1:03:31] answer is there no nobody goes to to to
[1:03:35] Thorns to find a grape vine to find
[1:03:37] grapes it's not there he says even so
[1:03:40] every good true tree bringeth forth good
[1:03:43] fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth
[1:03:45] evil fruit and then he he he doubles
[1:03:48] down on it he says a good tree cannot
[1:03:51] cannnot it's impossible bring forth evil
[1:03:55] fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring
[1:03:58] forth good fruit
[1:04:00] amen it's an impossibility you can't
[1:04:03] remember the scripture says you can't
[1:04:04] have both sweet and salty water out of
[1:04:06] the same Fountain it's not the way it
[1:04:08] works it's going to be one or the other
[1:04:10] and this life is the same way and people
[1:04:13] are the same way what we have to do
[1:04:14] though is give it time to see if it's
[1:04:17] good fruit or bad
[1:04:19] fruit and and we can get caught up in
[1:04:22] this idea that they'll bring forth good
[1:04:24] fruit eventually
[1:04:26] that's as may be but don't eat from the
[1:04:28] fruit until it's good I have seen people
[1:04:31] and I know people and and they they'll
[1:04:33] take somebody and the the consistent
[1:04:36] fruit out of their life is bad and yet
[1:04:38] they'll keep trusting
[1:04:40] them they'll keep following them they'll
[1:04:42] keep listening to them church we have to
[1:04:45] be gracious but we also have to be
[1:04:46] honest we have to use our discernment
[1:04:49] and if the fruit that keeps coming out
[1:04:50] is bad I'm not saying that person is a
[1:04:53] bad tree I'm saying they may not have
[1:04:55] what you think they have
[1:04:58] yet there is a change that needs to
[1:05:01] happen amen if the fruit keeps being bad
[1:05:03] there's something wrong with the tree
[1:05:05] there's a problem with the tree he says
[1:05:08] every tree that bringeth forth not
[1:05:10] bringeth not forth good fruit is heun
[1:05:12] down it's cut down and is cast Into the
[1:05:14] Fire Jesus doesn't say just keep
[1:05:17] believing he says listen it's going to
[1:05:20] come to an end if it doesn't produce
[1:05:21] good fruit there's only one thing it's
[1:05:23] good for and that's firewood now now
[1:05:25] that's not for you and I to do we don't
[1:05:28] do the cutting down and we don't do the
[1:05:29] burning we don't put people in we don't
[1:05:32] pull them in and we don't push them out
[1:05:33] that's for sure that is the work and
[1:05:35] that's the sovereignty of God that will
[1:05:37] do that amen remember what Jesus said in
[1:05:39] the parable the wheat and the and the
[1:05:40] tears he says I'll send my
[1:05:43] laborers to gather the tears to be
[1:05:46] burned and the wheat into the
[1:05:49] burn now they don't do the burning they
[1:05:51] do the Gathering and how do we gather
[1:05:54] there's only one way a laborer Gathers
[1:05:56] by the word by the word I don't have to
[1:05:59] gather you in to a barn or for burning
[1:06:03] you'll do it alone based on your
[1:06:04] response to the word of God see I'm not
[1:06:07] here remember what the Book of
[1:06:09] Revelation says near the end it says the
[1:06:10] the spirit and the bride say one thing
[1:06:13] come so you'll either come or you won't
[1:06:17] but the Gathering is based on hearing
[1:06:19] the word and if you hear the word you'll
[1:06:20] come and if you don't hear the word
[1:06:22] you'll stay out there and you're
[1:06:23] gathered you'll do your own Gathering I
[1:06:25] don't have to do anything for it amen
[1:06:28] our message is always come but we have
[1:06:30] to be frank and honest about
[1:06:32] situations remember what Paul said Paul
[1:06:34] said Mark
[1:06:36] them which cause or beware of people
[1:06:39] that cause divisions and offenses in
[1:06:41] other words he says don't give them
[1:06:44] ammunition don't feed
[1:06:47] that but then Paul would also say mark
[1:06:50] them that live the kind of life that I
[1:06:53] live see we've got to be able to be
[1:06:55] Frank and honest about where we're at in
[1:06:57] our life and our pattern is Christ and
[1:06:59] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[1:07:01] if you see somebody that lives a
[1:07:02] Christian Life pattern after them and if
[1:07:05] you see somebody that doesn't then for
[1:07:06] Pete's sake don't pattern after them and
[1:07:08] don't feed the
[1:07:11] dragon pick let's let's pick who we're
[1:07:13] going to copy we've got good Christian
[1:07:16] examples in this church that have lived
[1:07:17] a life that is that is reflected the
[1:07:19] life of Jesus Christ let's pick
[1:07:22] those but not one of us is perfect not a
[1:07:25] one of you is perfect we pattern after
[1:07:28] our El elders but not a one of them is
[1:07:31] perfect but we ought to take their
[1:07:33] example Jesus continues he says
[1:07:36] wherefore by their fruits ye shall know
[1:07:38] them so how do we figure out who's a
[1:07:40] wolf and who's a
[1:07:42] sheep same way we do with trees by their
[1:07:44] fruits by the product of their life if I
[1:07:48] could put it that
[1:07:49] way now watch this because it's very
[1:07:52] deceptive not everyone that saith unto
[1:07:54] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:07:56] kingdom of heaven but who will he that
[1:07:59] doeth the will of My Father which is in
[1:08:02] heaven so a declaration that I have
[1:08:04] accepted Jesus Christ is not sufficient
[1:08:06] here that's not going to get me there I
[1:08:08] can even call him my Lord but if I don't
[1:08:12] do what he tells me then he's not my
[1:08:14] Lord he is my Lord in name but he's not
[1:08:16] my Lord inde deed remember the parable
[1:08:19] of the two sons where the father said go
[1:08:21] work in the fields and he says yes I'll
[1:08:23] go do it and he goes tells the other son
[1:08:25] go work the fields he says no but he
[1:08:26] says the one that said yes didn't go do
[1:08:28] it and the one that said no repented and
[1:08:30] went and worked later and he says which
[1:08:32] one really loved the father they said
[1:08:33] the one that went and worked he said no
[1:08:35] but then he went and did it the other
[1:08:37] one had he he could he could with his
[1:08:38] mouth confess his love but his life
[1:08:40] wouldn't do
[1:08:41] it amen so the proof of his being my
[1:08:45] Lord is that I do his will not my will
[1:08:49] the proof is not that I do good things
[1:08:52] the proof is that I do what he wants me
[1:08:53] to do amen
[1:08:56] and it doesn't always look carnal when
[1:08:57] we're doing our own things when we're
[1:08:59] doing our dead works it doesn't look
[1:09:00] carnal watch what Jesus said he says
[1:09:03] many shall say to me in that day here's
[1:09:04] what they did with their life Lord Lord
[1:09:07] have we not prophesied in thy name is
[1:09:09] that a good thing didn't we just read a
[1:09:11] couple Services ago where Paul said I
[1:09:12] would that every one of you prophesy
[1:09:15] more than speaking in tongues I want you
[1:09:16] to prophesy the greatest gift in the
[1:09:19] church would be prophecy because that's
[1:09:20] thus sayeth the Lord and they'll come in
[1:09:23] that day and they'll say didn't we bring
[1:09:25] a genuine thus sayeth the
[1:09:28] Lord and in thy name have cast out
[1:09:31] Devils well
[1:09:33] hallelujah what a work to cast out
[1:09:35] Devils to free somebody from the
[1:09:37] Dominion of
[1:09:38] Satan and in thy name done many
[1:09:40] wonderful works but as we've said before
[1:09:43] you can stick Judas in this group you
[1:09:44] can stick Caiaphas in this group that
[1:09:46] prophesied you can stick balam in this
[1:09:48] group that prophesied and yet they were
[1:09:51] not sons of
[1:09:53] God Amen they are out of God's Will and
[1:09:57] yet they have signs and wonders
[1:09:58] following they have good works they have
[1:10:02] all sorts of the supernatural showing in
[1:10:04] their life and they think they've done a
[1:10:06] lot for the kingdom of God but remember
[1:10:09] what I think ought to be done is not
[1:10:11] what he thinks cuz his ways are higher
[1:10:13] than my ways and his thoughts are higher
[1:10:15] than my thoughts and so they come and
[1:10:17] they've used what they have in a way
[1:10:19] that they think best but Christ is
[1:10:21] sitting there saying you didn't come
[1:10:22] talk to me about it you did what you
[1:10:24] wanted to do do doing wonderful Works
[1:10:27] does not make them
[1:10:29] good he says and then will I profess to
[1:10:32] them this is Christ's response I never
[1:10:35] knew you depart from me you that work
[1:10:37] iniquity these were people that knew to
[1:10:39] do something and they didn't do it and
[1:10:41] they elected to do a different work with
[1:10:43] their life they built on the foundation
[1:10:46] but they built something of their own
[1:10:48] making and we find that their
[1:10:50] foundation's not even right as we come
[1:10:52] down to in a
[1:10:53] second what did they do Church they turn
[1:10:56] down the word and the next verse
[1:10:59] confirms it he says therefore whosoever
[1:11:02] heareth these says of mine whoever hears
[1:11:05] the word and doeth them I will liken him
[1:11:09] unto a wise man which built his house
[1:11:10] upon a
[1:11:11] rock as we said before Peter's not the
[1:11:14] rock Peter fell Peter made mistakes even
[1:11:16] after his conversion Peter's not it
[1:11:19] Jesus said if you hear and do what I
[1:11:21] tell you that's the rock that's the
[1:11:23] revelation of Jesus Christ not on a
[1:11:25] fallen man so whoever hears these
[1:11:28] sayings is is like a wise man who built
[1:11:30] his house upon a rock and the rain
[1:11:32] descended and the floods came and the
[1:11:34] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[1:11:37] it fell not it was founded for it was
[1:11:40] founded upon a Rock Church you'll notice
[1:11:43] as we go through these scriptures the
[1:11:45] difference between a Believer and
[1:11:46] unbeliever is not the
[1:11:48] storms being a child of God does not
[1:11:50] exclude us from Hard Times from storms
[1:11:52] of life from circumstances that are
[1:11:54] uncomfortable but what is different is
[1:11:56] how we come through those storms because
[1:11:58] they come through this storm a wise man
[1:12:00] that's founded on the revelation of
[1:12:02] Jesus Christ the word comes through the
[1:12:04] storm and nothing has happened to him
[1:12:08] the storm has had no
[1:12:09] effect the house is still
[1:12:12] strong but watch this and everyone that
[1:12:16] heareth these sayings of mine and doeth
[1:12:18] them not what's the difference between a
[1:12:20] child of God and a child of Darkness
[1:12:23] child of God will do the work he'll live
[1:12:25] by by the
[1:12:26] word he says whoever does him not shall
[1:12:28] be likened unto a foolish man which
[1:12:30] built his house upon the sand now the
[1:12:34] sand is far more beautiful than the rock
[1:12:37] can you imagine building your house on a
[1:12:38] beautiful beach in
[1:12:40] Hawaii right down by the water you could
[1:12:43] build it so that at high tide it comes
[1:12:45] just a foot away from the house and you
[1:12:47] get up in the morning and the sun is
[1:12:49] shining the sun is rising and you step
[1:12:51] out with your cup of whatever hot
[1:12:53] beverage you prefer and you step out
[1:12:55] into the sand and the warm water it's a
[1:12:59] way better place to build than a rock
[1:13:01] visually it's a lot more satisfaction to
[1:13:03] building on the
[1:13:05] beach but he says then the rain
[1:13:07] descended and the floods came and the
[1:13:09] winds blew and beat upon that house and
[1:13:11] it fell and great was the fall of it
[1:13:14] Church you can't have a great fall if
[1:13:15] you didn't have a great building it's a
[1:13:18] big thing when these things fall these
[1:13:19] will be great Ministries outwardly
[1:13:21] speaking with signs and wonders and
[1:13:23] gifts of the Spirit but they will fall
[1:13:25] because they did not build on the
[1:13:27] correct Revelation they did not build on
[1:13:29] the word of Jesus Christ how many times
[1:13:31] have we seen people like this people
[1:13:34] with great
[1:13:36] enthusiasm people with great gifts great
[1:13:38] Ministries great knowledge even we would
[1:13:40] say great Revelation And yet when times
[1:13:43] come situations come storms rise in life
[1:13:46] what happens is they crash and they
[1:13:49] burn and you say where did that come
[1:13:51] from that man's been pastoring for 20
[1:13:54] and 30 years and now he's gone where
[1:13:56] what what was he living
[1:13:58] for where was his experience how did it
[1:14:01] fall away so quickly and what do they do
[1:14:04] they step away from this path of
[1:14:05] Holiness and righteousness and they go
[1:14:08] back to what they came out of so long
[1:14:10] ago or else they go and wander in a
[1:14:12] Barren desert because they can't go
[1:14:14] fully back cuz they know too much but
[1:14:18] they're in a religious limbo because
[1:14:19] they can't stay where they were and so
[1:14:22] they wander around now in their Newfound
[1:14:24] freedom but they have no home because
[1:14:26] nobody's like
[1:14:27] them it's amazing that people that have
[1:14:30] left this message they know so much that
[1:14:32] they can't go back to
[1:14:34] denomination but they've
[1:14:37] Fallen they've fallen and so they're
[1:14:39] left in a place where what do they do
[1:14:41] they dabble in their freedom and they of
[1:14:43] all men most miserable they have nowhere
[1:14:45] that they fit great is the fall of their
[1:14:48] house the scripture says ministers song
[1:14:50] leaders deacons and their wives and
[1:14:52] children along with them people that
[1:14:55] gave Decades of their life to the gospel
[1:14:57] only to fall
[1:14:59] away why they didn't build on a right
[1:15:03] foundation that's it they built you
[1:15:06] can't say they didn't build Church they
[1:15:07] built they were faithful in their
[1:15:09] building but they built on the wrong
[1:15:11] thing and can I say it this way they
[1:15:13] were built on the revelation of a man
[1:15:16] not on the revelation of the son of man
[1:15:19] they were built on the revelation of a
[1:15:21] prophet of their pastor of a perfection
[1:15:25] that did not exist except in Christ and
[1:15:29] when men failed when this message failed
[1:15:32] according to them whatever it might be
[1:15:34] they fell with it because they weren't
[1:15:37] built on the strong Foundation they
[1:15:38] weren't built on a rock and everything
[1:15:40] came tumbling down around
[1:15:42] them people that were built on this idea
[1:15:45] that if you know the truth you're a
[1:15:49] Believer but remember it says the truth
[1:15:51] will set you
[1:15:53] free you shall know the truth and they
[1:15:55] said I know the truth but the truth has
[1:15:57] to set you free I remember a lady that
[1:16:00] walked away and she said all my life
[1:16:02] I've wanted a tattoo on my ankle she
[1:16:05] hadn't been set free and she'd harbored
[1:16:08] that all of her life and hid it while
[1:16:10] she was allegedly serving the lord all
[1:16:13] she wanted was a butterfly tattoo on her
[1:16:15] ankle what a horrible place to
[1:16:18] be sister Moren would you like a
[1:16:20] butterfly tattoo on your ankle have you
[1:16:22] been hiding something from us this
[1:16:23] morning she's back there laughing at me
[1:16:25] that's why I'm picking on her can you
[1:16:27] imagine why she hadn't experienced the
[1:16:30] freedom of the word she hadn't had her
[1:16:32] nature
[1:16:33] changed and she was miserable the whole
[1:16:37] time because why her house was not built
[1:16:40] on a foundation that wouldn't
[1:16:45] move we read this scripture last service
[1:16:48] actually that I'm about to read in
[1:16:50] Hebrews 6 but I'm going to read the part
[1:16:51] that I skipped over because the part I
[1:16:53] skipped over was for this service not
[1:16:55] for last service so it's where it
[1:16:56] belongs this morning I
[1:16:57] believe remember he read this he says
[1:16:59] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:17:01] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[1:17:03] Perfection onto maturity we read that
[1:17:06] last last service where we said when
[1:17:07] you've when you've established the
[1:17:09] principles of the word when you've done
[1:17:10] what the word tells you to do now it's
[1:17:12] time to go into maturity it's not
[1:17:14] Doctrine now it's
[1:17:16] manifestation amen it's to become an
[1:17:18] adult in Christ not laying again the
[1:17:20] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:17:22] and of Faith towards God the doctrine of
[1:17:24] baptisms laying on of hands resurrection
[1:17:27] of the dead and eternal judgment and
[1:17:28] this will we do if God permit but he
[1:17:31] says this this is what we skipped he
[1:17:32] says for it is impossible for those who
[1:17:35] were once enlightened once enlightened
[1:17:38] they're not now but they were and have
[1:17:40] tasted of the Heavenly gift they got a
[1:17:43] sampler but they didn't get the full
[1:17:44] meal and were made partakers of the Holy
[1:17:48] Ghost and have tasted the good word of
[1:17:51] God and the powers of the world to come
[1:17:53] so they they've tasted Ted they've tried
[1:17:55] they've been a part of it but they
[1:17:57] aren't it it's external to them but they
[1:18:01] have an experience with just about
[1:18:03] everything that God has to offer if we
[1:18:05] could put it that way this
[1:18:06] morning they know what it's like to be
[1:18:08] in good meetings anointed preaching
[1:18:11] tremendous works of the spirit healing
[1:18:14] signs wonders tongues whatever you pick
[1:18:16] your your your whatever you want to say
[1:18:18] this morning amen they are witnesses of
[1:18:20] just about everything that God has to
[1:18:22] offer in terms of the feel and the
[1:18:25] emotion and the hearing and all of these
[1:18:27] different
[1:18:28] things he says it's impossible if they
[1:18:30] shall fall away to renew themselves
[1:18:32] again unto repentance seeing they
[1:18:35] crucify to themselves the Son of God
[1:18:37] aresh and put him to an open shame
[1:18:40] there's got to be somebody to fulfill
[1:18:42] this scripture church that's the sad
[1:18:44] part of it there's got to be somebody to
[1:18:47] fulfill it and who are these people he's
[1:18:49] not talking about Sons and Daughters of
[1:18:51] God these are not children of God Amen
[1:18:54] when youve received re the Holy Spirit
[1:18:55] you're you're sealed to the day of your
[1:18:57] Redemption you cannot be lost but he's
[1:19:00] saying these people can be lost amen the
[1:19:02] holy spirit is our token it's our proof
[1:19:04] that we pass from Death unto life the
[1:19:06] prophet of God would talk about these
[1:19:07] people and he says they are caral
[1:19:09] believers who go through the form of
[1:19:12] reformation the form not the
[1:19:16] process they don't actually receive the
[1:19:18] holy spirit in another place he calls
[1:19:20] them borderline
[1:19:22] Believers so they go through all all the
[1:19:25] doctrines they go through all the
[1:19:27] principles they know it they understand
[1:19:30] it but yet they haven't received it amen
[1:19:35] so they're doing everything they can to
[1:19:37] be a Christian but they're not they're
[1:19:40] doing everything they're they're doing
[1:19:42] everything by the book and in the end he
[1:19:43] says they've got to walk away because
[1:19:46] they haven't been sealed they haven't
[1:19:48] truly received him watch how this comes
[1:19:50] Now watch how deceiving it is brother
[1:19:52] Garfield did a study on Deception that
[1:19:53] that I referenced last service and the
[1:19:55] deception we face today is the anointing
[1:19:57] of the spirit on a person but Christ is
[1:20:00] not in the person remember in leoda they
[1:20:03] have everything were riched increased
[1:20:06] with Goods have need of nothing they
[1:20:07] have every gift every
[1:20:10] manifestation everything look at look at
[1:20:12] when they uh El Eleazar went to to get a
[1:20:15] bride for
[1:20:16] Isaac what did he come with he came with
[1:20:19] a message an
[1:20:21] invitation he came with gifts and he
[1:20:24] came with a means to get her back to
[1:20:26] Isaac but if she never went back to
[1:20:29] Isaac she could never produce the
[1:20:31] promise but she could have every gift of
[1:20:34] Isaac without having met Isaac and it's
[1:20:36] the same thing today you can have every
[1:20:39] aspect of Christ except Christ every
[1:20:43] benefit Every Blessing every gift you
[1:20:45] name it it's possible to have that but
[1:20:47] yet in in Revelations 3 it says he is
[1:20:49] outside the church
[1:20:51] knocking they have everything except him
[1:20:54] and he's knocking to come back into the
[1:20:56] church amen every feeling every every
[1:20:59] every aspect that he could offer except
[1:21:01] himself so that can include a Sanctified
[1:21:04] life that can include good preaching hey
[1:21:07] I've heard some of these Pentecostal
[1:21:08] Brothers preach they can
[1:21:11] preach
[1:21:13] absolutely but what is it their soul is
[1:21:16] still governed by
[1:21:18] self-will that's what a wolf is it's
[1:21:21] governed by self-will they have not
[1:21:23] surrendered to the word of God which is
[1:21:26] his will and therefore they are LED of
[1:21:27] their own desires and their own Wills
[1:21:29] amen that's who Jesus was talking about
[1:21:31] in earlier
[1:21:32] scriptures he says but watch this he
[1:21:35] says for the Earth which drinketh in the
[1:21:37] rain that cometh down of upon it and
[1:21:40] brings forth herbs meat for them by whom
[1:21:43] it is dressed receives blessing from God
[1:21:45] so rain is sent specifically for the
[1:21:48] good
[1:21:48] things so we plant vegetables we plant
[1:21:51] fruit trees we we plant Gardens we plant
[1:21:53] wheat and grains and these different
[1:21:55] things the rain is meant to produce that
[1:21:58] which helps us sustain our
[1:22:00] life and so he says the rain comes down
[1:22:02] and all of those good things they take
[1:22:04] it and they produce
[1:22:07] themselves but verse eight that which
[1:22:10] Bears thorns and briers is rejected and
[1:22:13] is nigh un cursing whose end is to be
[1:22:16] burned that same rain falls on the
[1:22:18] thorns and the
[1:22:19] Briars the exact same rain Church there
[1:22:23] is no difference
[1:22:25] there's no difference in the word or the
[1:22:27] anointing in the reality God doesn't
[1:22:30] just send his son on good people we all
[1:22:34] get the
[1:22:35] sun we don't get it much in Newan land
[1:22:37] but we get it and guess what it doesn't
[1:22:39] matter if you're a good person bad
[1:22:40] person good farmer bad farmer the Sun
[1:22:42] comes the rain definitely comes and it's
[1:22:45] it's indiscriminate amen but what they
[1:22:48] produce under that same benefit of God
[1:22:52] is thorns and briers why cuz they're
[1:22:55] thorns and Briars you can't be what
[1:22:57] you're not amen they can't help it the
[1:22:59] rain brings out what they are and that
[1:23:01] is that their end purpose is to be
[1:23:03] destroyed by fire now let's go back to
[1:23:05] Jesus I'm taking my time this morning to
[1:23:07] set a foundation really for Wednesday
[1:23:09] but I want you to understand from the
[1:23:11] scripture that being under the hearing
[1:23:12] of the word of God does not make you a
[1:23:15] Christian going to church doesn't make
[1:23:17] you a Christian being a good person
[1:23:18] doesn't make you a Christian it's Christ
[1:23:20] in you that makes you a Christian and
[1:23:23] there nothing else will do it amen
[1:23:24] you've got to have his spirit inside of
[1:23:26] you not just around you or near you or
[1:23:28] even working with you it has to be
[1:23:30] inside of you it has to seal you amen
[1:23:33] that's what the new birth is Jesus says
[1:23:35] this Matthew 5 but I say unto you love
[1:23:39] your enemies bless them that curse you
[1:23:42] do good to them that hate you and pray
[1:23:44] for them which despitefully use you and
[1:23:46] persecute you we're going to get real
[1:23:47] Down to Earth this morning this is
[1:23:49] pastoral preaching this is
[1:23:52] Jesus love your enem enemies bless them
[1:23:55] that curse you do good to them that hate
[1:23:57] you and pray for them which despitefully
[1:23:59] use you usually when we pray for those
[1:24:01] that despitefully use us it's Lord Smite
[1:24:06] them let's be
[1:24:08] honest sometimes we're more like
[1:24:11] David but we're supposed to be the
[1:24:13] bride mercy and
[1:24:17] Grace he says that ye may be the
[1:24:20] children of your father which is in
[1:24:21] heaven for he makes his son to rise on
[1:24:24] the east evil and on the good and
[1:24:26] sendeth reain on the just and the unjust
[1:24:29] so God doesn't hold his His blessings
[1:24:31] back from bad people it's still it's
[1:24:34] still available if I could put it that
[1:24:36] way you can come into this church and
[1:24:38] never accept it and still receive many
[1:24:40] blessings from being here listen sitting
[1:24:43] under the preaching of the word and
[1:24:44] doing the basics will make you a better
[1:24:45] citizen it'll give you a better family
[1:24:47] it'll give you a better marriage there
[1:24:49] are all sorts of blessings here your
[1:24:50] kids will be better for having gone to
[1:24:52] church 100%
[1:24:55] but that's not
[1:24:56] Christ that's just the sun and the rain
[1:25:01] amen remember what Paul said these were
[1:25:04] people that were once enlightened they
[1:25:05] were sitting in the light of God's word
[1:25:07] they tasted of the Heavenly gift they
[1:25:09] were partakers of the Holy Ghost they
[1:25:11] had felt the presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:13] they had seen his work in their midst
[1:25:16] and they tasted the good word of God and
[1:25:18] the powers of the world to come these
[1:25:19] things were genuine Church they were
[1:25:22] sitting under the real rain they were
[1:25:23] sitting under the the real son amen it
[1:25:25] was God doing something but the problem
[1:25:27] is that they weren't
[1:25:29] wheat they were briers and Thorns they
[1:25:32] weren't children of God Amen and so
[1:25:34] though they could experience the
[1:25:35] pleasure and the benefits of God in
[1:25:37] their flesh and even in their Spirit
[1:25:39] their soul could never receive it and
[1:25:41] they could never get the new birth of a
[1:25:42] total
[1:25:43] change they could never surrender full
[1:25:47] control because they weren't a child of
[1:25:50] God he says so you see the same rain
[1:25:53] that makes the weak grow makes a cockle
[1:25:55] Burg grow and therefore I got the
[1:25:57] picture there's your carnal
[1:25:59] Confessor that's right in the
[1:26:02] church he might shout jump
[1:26:06] she let's be Equitable this morning she
[1:26:09] or
[1:26:10] he could jout shout jump dance speak
[1:26:14] with tongues but his fruits he's a
[1:26:16] Cocker and there's the other one they've
[1:26:18] got the same Spirit the Holy Spirit can
[1:26:20] drop right in a bunch of people and a
[1:26:22] hypocrite can Shout by the Holy
[1:26:25] Spirit just the same as a cockle Burg
[1:26:27] can live by the rain that sent that's
[1:26:29] what Paul's speaking of here but it's
[1:26:31] impossible for a cockle bur to become a
[1:26:34] wheat or a weat a Cocker he says it
[1:26:37] depends on what seed is sewed in your
[1:26:38] heart if you come to church just because
[1:26:41] you're afraid of hell if you join church
[1:26:43] because you don't want to go to hell
[1:26:45] you're still a cockle bur if you join
[1:26:48] church just to be popular you're still a
[1:26:50] cockle bur if you did all these formal
[1:26:53] things that's to be done and that's all
[1:26:55] you have he says you're still a Cocker
[1:26:58] there are formal things we need to do
[1:27:00] you need to repent you need to be
[1:27:02] baptized properly in the name of the
[1:27:03] Lord Jesus Christ amen those are good we
[1:27:06] do them because the word tells us to but
[1:27:08] they are leading us to the New Birth
[1:27:10] they are not the new birth itself amen
[1:27:12] the new birth is when you receive Christ
[1:27:15] personally not just accept his work at
[1:27:18] Calvary accept
[1:27:20] him because he's savior but you need him
[1:27:23] as Lord Lord and that's where most
[1:27:26] people Falls they accept him as Savior
[1:27:27] but he doesn't come in as
[1:27:30] Lord why because I can't live this life
[1:27:33] if he's not living it through me it's
[1:27:35] the only way I'm going to do it and so
[1:27:37] that new birth takes us from acting like
[1:27:39] a Christian to being a Christian you
[1:27:41] don't have to act anymore we can live
[1:27:43] out the word of God by the spirit he
[1:27:45] says now catch this as we at the end
[1:27:47] here he says but a real genuine
[1:27:50] Christian presses towards perfection
[1:27:54] presses towards maturity that word
[1:27:57] Perfection is scary our Perfection is
[1:28:00] never sinless perfection in this flesh
[1:28:03] don't ever try for it don't ever think
[1:28:04] you're going to achieve it I don't care
[1:28:06] who says it we have no sinless
[1:28:08] Perfection Christ is our sinless
[1:28:10] Perfection that's why we needed him is
[1:28:13] because this can never do it but we're
[1:28:15] going to cover a bigger a bigger
[1:28:18] question on that in a later service but
[1:28:20] he says the real genuine Christian
[1:28:22] presses towards perfection until the
[1:28:25] world is dead and you become a new
[1:28:27] creature in Christ Jesus he says then
[1:28:30] it's impossible for that man to ever
[1:28:33] fall Hallelujah if God fills you with
[1:28:35] the Holy Spirit you can never fall in
[1:28:37] God's eyes listen this flesh will fail
[1:28:41] this flesh will fail every single day
[1:28:43] amen we're going to answer that question
[1:28:44] can you have the Holy Ghost in sin I'll
[1:28:47] tell you the answer is you can't sin but
[1:28:48] you can
[1:28:49] fail
[1:28:51] absolutely amen but what happens is God
[1:28:55] doesn't give you the Holy Spirit and
[1:28:56] then take it
[1:28:58] away but you can lose the feeling of it
[1:29:01] you can lose the joy of it you can use
[1:29:03] this lose the satisfaction the
[1:29:05] contentment the rest absolutely but your
[1:29:09] soul is
[1:29:10] sealed but you can't lose him amen why
[1:29:13] because our feelings are subject to so
[1:29:14] many influences if you're a woman your
[1:29:17] hormones alone what a battle you face
[1:29:20] sisters and then we have the emotions
[1:29:22] from work and we have the emotions from
[1:29:23] inter actions with people and we have
[1:29:25] the highs and lows of our finances and
[1:29:27] our health and all these different
[1:29:28] things that are playing in amen we can
[1:29:30] lose the feeling of the Holy Spirit but
[1:29:31] we can't lose the Holy Spirit if we've
[1:29:33] been sealed let's let the word speak to
[1:29:35] us again I hope you're with me because
[1:29:37] this should be a comfort this morning
[1:29:39] this should be a comfort that we've been
[1:29:40] sealed brother Braham says this he says
[1:29:44] I don't act clean and pure and holy to
[1:29:46] make myself a
[1:29:47] Christian but Christ in me lives that in
[1:29:51] me and I love him and if I do anything
[1:29:54] wrong it condemns me right there I'll
[1:29:56] say God forgive me now catch this every
[1:30:00] day I've got to ask forgiveness every
[1:30:03] day and you do
[1:30:05] too he says certainly you do now watch
[1:30:08] Paul's words as we're we're at the last
[1:30:10] third of this service this morning Paul
[1:30:12] says this in Ephesians 4 and grieve not
[1:30:15] the Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed
[1:30:18] unto the day of redemption let me ask
[1:30:20] you a question this morning can a True
[1:30:23] Believer grieve the Holy
[1:30:28] Spirit
[1:30:29] absolutely absolutely we can not in a
[1:30:32] way that takes him out of your soul but
[1:30:35] in a way that takes his effect out of
[1:30:37] your life absolutely we can see the
[1:30:39] distinction because brother R says we
[1:30:41] make choices every day and we fail every
[1:30:44] day amen and what we choose whether it's
[1:30:47] to stay with the word or go with what
[1:30:49] somebody or something else says or
[1:30:51] influences us to do if we listen to the
[1:30:53] word or if we'll listen to our emotions
[1:30:55] or our flesh or our boss our employer
[1:30:57] whatever it might be if we make the
[1:30:58] wrong choice the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:31:00] leave our
[1:31:01] soul it doesn't leave it the soul is
[1:31:04] sealed as we just read but now we're
[1:31:06] influenced by something else and so the
[1:31:08] effect of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives
[1:31:10] is gone out and now we're acting on our
[1:31:13] own so guess what when I lose his effect
[1:31:16] guess who loses
[1:31:18] power me because now I'm left with what
[1:31:20] I can bring to the table which is
[1:31:23] nothing my power is not effective in my
[1:31:26] Christian walk amen now I'm walking I
[1:31:28] don't have support I don't have
[1:31:30] encouragement I don't have strength I
[1:31:32] don't have Direction because it's got to
[1:31:34] come from me and that's going to fail
[1:31:35] real quick amen we have no power without
[1:31:39] the Holy Spirit In Our Lives amen so
[1:31:41] when we grieve the Holy Spirit what do
[1:31:42] we lose we lose the feeling and the
[1:31:46] effect of his presence that's it amen
[1:31:49] that awareness of the anointing on you I
[1:31:52] if you're a Christian I believe you felt
[1:31:53] this by this time you can there there
[1:31:55] are times where you can feel his
[1:31:58] presence it is not always there at least
[1:32:00] it's not for me maybe somebody's there I
[1:32:03] don't always feel his presence but I
[1:32:04] know he's with me but but the feeling
[1:32:08] the sensing of his presence is what you
[1:32:10] lose when you
[1:32:12] grieving amen and with that go all the
[1:32:15] benefits of that feeling if I could put
[1:32:17] it that way all
[1:32:19] right that can fall away the feeling of
[1:32:22] his presence can fall away church and if
[1:32:25] you feel it that doesn't make you more
[1:32:26] saved and if you don't feel it that
[1:32:28] doesn't make you unsaved it has nothing
[1:32:31] to do with your salvation amen but what
[1:32:34] we do when we grieve him is we get
[1:32:38] cold let me put it this way we lose our
[1:32:43] heat you might be hot but you'll go to
[1:32:45] lukewarm you might still be better than
[1:32:47] 99% of the world but you're not where
[1:32:50] you ought to be and from there comes
[1:32:52] formality
[1:32:54] comes
[1:32:55] starchiness critical Spirits dismissive
[1:32:59] attitudes I speak by
[1:33:01] experience right when we let something
[1:33:04] come between us and his Fellowship all
[1:33:07] we're left with catch this is our own
[1:33:10] fellowship and guess what I'm a
[1:33:13] miserable
[1:33:23] cuz this self Rises
[1:33:26] up and that's never going to be a good
[1:33:29] thing when the only person I can
[1:33:31] fellowship with is me I'm of all men
[1:33:33] most miserable let me put it that way
[1:33:35] and you will be too if you come into my
[1:33:37] presence that way it takes Christ to
[1:33:39] make me worth being around think of even
[1:33:41] the gifts of the Holy Spirit the gifts
[1:33:43] of the holy spirit are meant for him to
[1:33:45] anoint us to do or say
[1:33:48] something you can have that gift without
[1:33:50] the Holy Spirit and it can operate by
[1:33:53] your
[1:33:55] will but when it operates by your will
[1:33:58] what happens Church it'll fail it'll
[1:34:02] fail because it's meant to be used by
[1:34:04] him not by us a gifted preacher a man
[1:34:07] that's got a gift to preach the word of
[1:34:10] God can come here this morning and he
[1:34:12] can preach a sermon and you know what
[1:34:13] it'll do if he's not
[1:34:15] anointed nothing oh it'll stimulate us
[1:34:18] intellectually it may make us shout but
[1:34:21] it won't have an eternal effect because
[1:34:23] the holy spirit's not in it if I'm not
[1:34:26] anointed this morning my words will fall
[1:34:28] right over this pulpit and go right
[1:34:30] there even if I have a gift he's got to
[1:34:34] be in
[1:34:36] it so the question is Brother John how
[1:34:38] do we grieve the Holy Spirit does
[1:34:41] anybody here want to grieve the Holy
[1:34:43] Spirit no so how do we not grieve
[1:34:47] it and how do we grieve it watch Paul's
[1:34:50] focus on
[1:34:52] this this is real living now we're
[1:34:54] getting down to the meat of this I'm a
[1:34:56] practical preacher and I love how Paul
[1:34:58] can take the greatest of mysteries and
[1:35:01] then he can come right down and he can
[1:35:02] put a finger right on my
[1:35:04] life and bring it down to where we live
[1:35:07] so we can look at the word and say am I
[1:35:09] there or am I not there how do we grieve
[1:35:12] the Holy Spirit we grieve it by
[1:35:14] succumbing to our
[1:35:16] nature our fleshly carnal nature rather
[1:35:19] than the spirit of Christ see when you
[1:35:22] really get down to it we backslide
[1:35:23] because we let something get between us
[1:35:25] and the word that's what it is and Satan
[1:35:28] then does a wonderful job of stirring up
[1:35:31] our flesh in our
[1:35:32] emotions to react to situations and
[1:35:35] circumstances and that's where we start
[1:35:37] to grieve the Holy Spirit watch what
[1:35:39] Paul says we're in Ephesians 4 now I'm
[1:35:41] taking this out of the
[1:35:42] Amplified just so we can really hit the
[1:35:44] mark this morning Paul says he says
[1:35:47] grieve not the Holy Spirit to do that
[1:35:50] we've got to get rid of some things he
[1:35:52] says let all bitter bitterness and
[1:35:55] indignation and wrath passion rage and
[1:35:59] bad temper we don't we don't we don't
[1:36:02] have that here this
[1:36:03] morning sister Priscilla and sister Leah
[1:36:05] both
[1:36:06] grinned you've been
[1:36:09] caught
[1:36:13] no surely surely
[1:36:16] not but do you have any of this in your
[1:36:18] house brother Bob no no it's a trick
[1:36:21] question
[1:36:25] resentment anger and animosity and
[1:36:28] quarreling we've got this in our
[1:36:31] house brawling absolutely you got boys
[1:36:35] you got this clamor contention and
[1:36:39] slander evil speaking abusive or
[1:36:42] Blasphemous language be banished from
[1:36:44] you along with or with all malice spite
[1:36:47] ill will or baseness of any kind oh my
[1:36:51] this is what Grieves the Holy Spirit
[1:36:55] and he says so get rid of all of this
[1:36:58] but you can't just get rid of things you
[1:37:00] got to bring something in behind it you
[1:37:02] got to fill the Gap you got to fill the
[1:37:04] void he says and become useful and
[1:37:07] helpful and kind to one another
[1:37:12] tenderhearted
[1:37:13] compassionate understanding oh I love
[1:37:15] this lovingheart God help us to be
[1:37:18] lovingheart
[1:37:20] forgiving one another readily and freely
[1:37:24] as God in Christ forgave
[1:37:27] you see we can focus so much on a
[1:37:30] Sanctified life to keep from grieving
[1:37:32] the Holy Spirit right and we should
[1:37:36] scripture says be ye holy for I am Holy
[1:37:38] I'm not saying don't do that but we
[1:37:40] ought to keep our life clean but we can
[1:37:42] live the cleanest of lives by the dos
[1:37:44] and don'ts if I could put it that way
[1:37:45] this morning and still grieve the Holy
[1:37:49] Spirit are you with me this morning Paul
[1:37:52] preached plenty about living a life
[1:37:54] that's pleasing to Christ in terms of
[1:37:56] our works and what we allow in our life
[1:37:58] but now he's coming to how we
[1:38:00] act our
[1:38:03] attitudes actions and reactions
[1:38:07] conversations suppressing the fleshly
[1:38:09] feelings so that Christ can come
[1:38:13] through brother brah says it this way he
[1:38:15] says we are not of this World Church
[1:38:20] that means we live by a different set of
[1:38:21] rules a different set uh principles of
[1:38:24] morals we're motivated differently we
[1:38:26] have different
[1:38:27] values and standards our life is
[1:38:30] different in every way cuz we're not out
[1:38:32] of this world we are different from the
[1:38:35] world we live a different life a
[1:38:36] separated life we're never to live the
[1:38:38] life of the world and be a Christian
[1:38:40] we're to live an outstanding life a
[1:38:43] different life not in such social ranks
[1:38:45] he says but I mean we are to live a life
[1:38:47] of genuine
[1:38:49] Holiness can we say
[1:38:51] Amen but what's the purpose purpose that
[1:38:54] the fruits of the spirit might be seen
[1:38:57] in US of meekness and gentleness and
[1:38:59] patience longsuffering Faith the fruits
[1:39:02] of the spirit so what's the the purpose
[1:39:04] of a life of Holiness is to contribute
[1:39:06] to the growth of the fruits of the
[1:39:08] spirit in our life it's to keep from
[1:39:10] hindering our spiritual growth and also
[1:39:12] getting us to a place where we can help
[1:39:14] others in their spiritual growth it's to
[1:39:17] keep us in the right attitude the right
[1:39:18] mindset so that the spirit of Christ can
[1:39:21] flow through us and make us a help a
[1:39:23] hindrance to the kingdom of God so when
[1:39:26] we when it comes to grieving the spirit
[1:39:28] what does Paul focus on he talks about
[1:39:31] our emotions he talks about our actions
[1:39:33] our reactions he talks about our
[1:39:35] conversations our offenses our hurts
[1:39:38] where we rub shoulders with
[1:39:44] whom right
[1:39:46] here this is where it
[1:39:49] matters this is the body of
[1:39:51] Christ amen
[1:39:54] Paul's saying don't let your
[1:39:55] interactions with each other grieve the
[1:39:57] Holy
[1:39:59] Spirit don't rest in the fact that we
[1:40:01] live a clean life if what follows that
[1:40:05] life is arguments and bitterness and
[1:40:08] resentment
[1:40:11] amen God's wanting a bride that has his
[1:40:15] nature not just his outward appearance
[1:40:18] cuz remember our outward appearance he
[1:40:20] says in Revelations 3 he says that take
[1:40:23] take on a what take on a white robe of
[1:40:26] his righteousness our appearance is in
[1:40:29] his righteousness not our own but the
[1:40:31] nature inside is supposed to be that of
[1:40:34] Christ Paul's saying your nature needs
[1:40:36] to line up with his and really yours
[1:40:39] needs to go
[1:40:40] away so that he can have the
[1:40:43] preeminence he says you ought to be the
[1:40:45] best of the best when it comes to
[1:40:47] dealing with each other with each other
[1:40:50] amen listen to this
[1:40:53] Ram says the other night when I was
[1:40:54] coming over here a few nights ago the
[1:40:57] Lord met me in the room there just a
[1:40:58] vision the same as I see here at the
[1:41:00] platform and said here's what's the
[1:41:02] matter with the church they've got so
[1:41:04] much selfishness
[1:41:06] everywhere he didn't just say this he
[1:41:09] says now who's he talking
[1:41:11] about the Church of the Living God he's
[1:41:15] not talking about make Believers he's
[1:41:16] not talking about denominations he's
[1:41:18] saying True Believers the Church of the
[1:41:20] Living God has got so many differences
[1:41:23] and so much this and that till they
[1:41:25] grieve the holy spirit away from them
[1:41:27] and that's just exactly what it
[1:41:29] is how do we fix it
[1:41:32] brother and brother and sister until we
[1:41:35] humble
[1:41:36] ourselves and become the lamb what's the
[1:41:39] nature of a lamb sacrificial lays down
[1:41:42] its life so the dove can light on us
[1:41:45] again and bring joy and peace and
[1:41:48] satisfaction and a burning desire in our
[1:41:50] hearts to see others saved and come to
[1:41:52] God we are simply fighting the winds
[1:41:55] what's he saying he's saying you've lost
[1:41:57] the joy the peace the satisfaction and a
[1:41:59] burning desire in your heart to see
[1:42:01] others saved because you've gotten
[1:42:06] selfish this flesh is very very
[1:42:09] selfish and that's what gets us in
[1:42:12] trouble it's unconverted it's unchanged
[1:42:15] it's
[1:42:18] unregenerated he says if you don't
[1:42:21] humble if we don't don't humble
[1:42:23] ourselves and become the lamb we are
[1:42:25] simply fighting the winds anybody ever
[1:42:28] tried to fight the
[1:42:30] winds does the wind care if you fight it
[1:42:33] or
[1:42:34] not we get up
[1:42:38] there would you say brother John you
[1:42:39] sure showed the wind there he'll never
[1:42:41] touch you again the wind doesn't care
[1:42:44] what I do when I move my hand it just
[1:42:46] comes right in and it Blends right back
[1:42:47] to where it was the air doesn't care
[1:42:49] what I do it just flows right back you
[1:42:52] can't beat the Wind Church
[1:42:54] he's saying all we're doing if we don't
[1:42:57] do this is we're fighting a battle we
[1:42:59] cannot
[1:43:04] win he says don't never let anything
[1:43:08] rise up and put bitterness in your soul
[1:43:11] no matter how bad everyone ever treats
[1:43:12] you or anything don't ever don't be
[1:43:15] guilty of letting that thing anchor in
[1:43:17] your soul it'll grieve the holy spirit
[1:43:19] away from you it certainly will remember
[1:43:22] what brother Bram says you can't stop
[1:43:23] the birds from flying over you but you
[1:43:26] can stop them from building a nest
[1:43:29] amen when somebody's done me wrong when
[1:43:33] somebody's done you wrong you know how
[1:43:34] you get over what they've done wrong
[1:43:36] start thinking about what they did
[1:43:38] right and me I can look at every single
[1:43:41] person in this church and they've done
[1:43:43] wonderful things for me and I'm thankful
[1:43:46] for it so the minute that sister Lydia
[1:43:49] does something she shouldn't do to me
[1:43:51] you know what I'm going to think about
[1:43:52] all the time she's come up here and
[1:43:55] she's played faithfully and she's sat
[1:43:57] there faithfully and taking notes in the
[1:43:59] service
[1:44:00] Faithfully how she's played with the
[1:44:02] kids how she's been kind to the children
[1:44:06] not that she didn't shake my hand after
[1:44:07] service like she didn't on
[1:44:09] Wednesday I don't know if she did or not
[1:44:11] I go around and shake hands so if we
[1:44:13] missed it's my fault but my point is I
[1:44:15] can choose to remember what sister Lydia
[1:44:19] doesn't have or I can choose to remember
[1:44:22] what sister Lydia
[1:44:23] ads amen remember what Paul said
[1:44:26] whatsoever things are pure honest of a
[1:44:29] good report I want to think the best
[1:44:31] about sister Lydia because sister Lydia
[1:44:34] is a part of this body I hope you don't
[1:44:36] mind me picking on you this morning
[1:44:37] sister Lydia but you're sitting there so
[1:44:38] calmly and quietly I figure you're okay
[1:44:40] with it and you haven't started blushing
[1:44:41] yet
[1:44:42] so what do we do we want to focus on
[1:44:45] what is good because we're here for what
[1:44:48] we have not for what we don't you add
[1:44:51] nothing to the body with what you don't
[1:44:53] don't have so that means you're not here
[1:44:54] for what you don't have you're here for
[1:44:56] what you do have and I'm going to focus
[1:44:58] on what you've got rather than what you
[1:44:59] don't got whether you like it or
[1:45:02] not
[1:45:07] amen but you know what there's nobody
[1:45:09] can hurt you like another
[1:45:12] believer there's nobody can hurt us like
[1:45:15] another believer why because we've got
[1:45:19] expectations we've got expectations for
[1:45:21] how they'll Act how they'll talk how
[1:45:24] they'll support how they'll encourage
[1:45:26] and when they fail and we
[1:45:29] do it hurts us it hurts us amen and we
[1:45:34] all have our areas of
[1:45:37] weakness and Satan knows how to push
[1:45:40] those
[1:45:41] buttons Satan is a master of psychology
[1:45:45] he knows how to push our buttons amen
[1:45:48] and so he tries to orchestrate
[1:45:50] situations where your buttons are
[1:45:52] getting p push push push push push all
[1:45:54] day every day to get us in a
[1:45:57] tizzy
[1:46:00] amen you know how he does it he points
[1:46:03] out brother Bob's mistakes instead of my
[1:46:07] mistakes
[1:46:09] right that's what he does he gets me to
[1:46:12] look at him instead of me I'm going to
[1:46:15] lose the front row here pretty quick if
[1:46:16] I keep choosing the ones in the front I
[1:46:17] see sister Mor and brother Mark mov back
[1:46:19] they knew what was coming
[1:46:25] see I could take that as an
[1:46:27] insult sure I could you say brother John
[1:46:30] that to be childish Church get me in my
[1:46:33] flesh and I can match anybody for
[1:46:34] childishness and so can you
[1:46:38] amen I'm with you this morning this is
[1:46:40] not a preaching to you this is a
[1:46:41] preaching to us this is rubber meets the
[1:46:44] road Christianity this morning
[1:46:48] amen if God showing it ain't God that
[1:46:52] shows me brother Bob's problems except
[1:46:55] as a matter of
[1:46:57] prayer that's it that's it and if it's a
[1:47:01] big enough problem I'm going to go to
[1:47:03] brother Bob and say brother Bob you've
[1:47:05] got a problem and I'm telling you as a
[1:47:08] brother you've got a problem not cuz it
[1:47:10] affects me cuz it affects him I'm there
[1:47:14] to help him not to help me that's what
[1:47:17] the spirit of God does is it will help
[1:47:19] the other person the gift is for him not
[1:47:22] for me
[1:47:23] so if I go in selfishness to correct
[1:47:25] brother Bob you know what's going to
[1:47:27] happen
[1:47:29] nothing maybe his Christianity will help
[1:47:31] him to accept it but it's not God in it
[1:47:34] it's me in it it's me trying to do it
[1:47:37] the only person that can change in any
[1:47:40] situation is
[1:47:42] me I can't rely on you or you the entire
[1:47:47] group from left to right I can't rely on
[1:47:49] you to change because I don't even know
[1:47:52] if I'm right in the situation I don't
[1:47:53] even know if I've got the situation
[1:47:54] figured out if I'm entwined in it then
[1:47:57] I've got I've got a stake in it how do I
[1:47:59] know my vision's clear but what I've got
[1:48:01] to be able to do is go to the word and
[1:48:04] say Lord will you show me what I need to
[1:48:07] do because if I'm dealing with
[1:48:09] bitterness if I'm dealing with anger if
[1:48:11] I'm dealing with resentment if I'm
[1:48:12] dealing with a dislike toward my brother
[1:48:14] and
[1:48:15] sister that problem is mine not theirs
[1:48:20] it's mine to deal with amen so it's the
[1:48:23] word that can show me those things it's
[1:48:24] the word that can discern those things
[1:48:27] and it takes humility to back up and say
[1:48:29] Lord I'm not going to worry about what
[1:48:31] brother Bob did to
[1:48:32] me Lord what did I do how did I
[1:48:36] contribute and Lord if you'll talk to me
[1:48:38] if you'll show me my part by God's grace
[1:48:41] I'll try and
[1:48:43] change by Your Word by your
[1:48:47] spirit and here's the thing this is
[1:48:50] again I speak from experience
[1:48:57] I notice
[1:48:59] Trends and if I've got the same
[1:49:03] Trend guess who the common denominator
[1:49:05] is in every situation it's me I was
[1:49:09] talking to a man a while back been
[1:49:11] through three
[1:49:13] marriages I said are you going to get
[1:49:16] married again he said no I said why not
[1:49:19] he says I've realized that all of my
[1:49:22] marriages have failed he says and the
[1:49:23] common denominator is
[1:49:25] me that takes
[1:49:27] humility he's saying I ain't no good at
[1:49:30] marriage so I'm not going to put another
[1:49:32] woman in that position thank
[1:49:37] God but if we keep walking into the same
[1:49:41] issue the common denominator is me not
[1:49:44] the other people if I keep losing my job
[1:49:47] Church the problem's not the jobs the
[1:49:50] problem's me if I keep leaving churches
[1:49:52] the problem is not the churches the
[1:49:53] problem's me if I keep leaving marriages
[1:49:56] the problem's not the marriage the women
[1:49:57] in the marriage the problem is me that's
[1:50:00] where we've got to be able to see
[1:50:01] ourselves amen God needs to change me
[1:50:04] not the situation if he can change me
[1:50:07] then whether he changes it or not I'll
[1:50:08] be okay moving
[1:50:10] forward the moment we genuinely
[1:50:14] think I said this
[1:50:17] before CET trait we think we're right
[1:50:20] all the time
[1:50:23] yeah some of you may not have that cetes
[1:50:26] we have to deal with thinking we're
[1:50:27] right all the time and the minute I
[1:50:30] think that I've lost my humility and I'm
[1:50:34] on a path of getting knocked down
[1:50:36] because Pride go for Before Destruction
[1:50:39] and a hotty spirit before a fall I'm on
[1:50:41] the way down if I think you're the only
[1:50:44] one that needs to
[1:50:48] change two quotes as we close
[1:50:53] but B says now don't
[1:50:56] fuss I wrote in my notes if all you can
[1:50:59] do is fuss walk
[1:51:02] away why CU it's the flesh that's
[1:51:07] fussing it's the flesh that needs time
[1:51:09] to settle down and it's not immature to
[1:51:12] say I need to settle down before I move
[1:51:15] forward with this I've been in
[1:51:18] situations where if I had tried to press
[1:51:20] forward in the matter in the moment I'd
[1:51:22] have killed that person not literally
[1:51:26] but I'd have spoken out of turn I'd have
[1:51:28] expressed anger that shouldn't be
[1:51:29] expressed I'd have said things that
[1:51:30] should never have been said and so I've
[1:51:33] got to be able to back away and settle
[1:51:36] down and say I'm going to let this have
[1:51:37] a little bit of time to cool off why so
[1:51:40] the spirit of God can come
[1:51:41] out because we've all got flesh we've
[1:51:45] all got emotions
[1:51:46] amen remember I've said before don't
[1:51:48] spank your kids when you're angry why
[1:51:51] the purpose of a spanking is not to
[1:51:52] express anger it's to
[1:51:55] teach it's to show a consequence and if
[1:51:58] you add your anger to it you reduce the
[1:52:01] teaching to one of Retribution and
[1:52:03] revenge
[1:52:04] even don't do it in Anger likewise don't
[1:52:08] deal with your brother and sisters in
[1:52:09] Anger let the flesh get settled down so
[1:52:12] that the spirit of God can come out he
[1:52:15] says don't fuss temper breeds temper
[1:52:18] first thing you know you grieve the holy
[1:52:19] spirit away from you and you'll be
[1:52:21] fussing back
[1:52:23] listen if somebody's fussing with me
[1:52:25] I've got to be able to say listen I
[1:52:26] don't think we're getting anywhere with
[1:52:28] this let's walk away and come back in a
[1:52:29] day or two we're allowed to do
[1:52:32] that but he says if you first thing you
[1:52:35] know you'll be fussing back see what
[1:52:37] happens is we take our license to act
[1:52:39] out because they're acting out well he
[1:52:42] got angry so I can get angry well she
[1:52:45] told on me so I'm going to tell on her
[1:52:47] well they didn't do this so I don't do
[1:52:49] that and what we're doing is we're
[1:52:51] reflecting the person rather than
[1:52:53] reflecting the word and that's not going
[1:52:55] to get anybody anywhere we think that
[1:52:57] two wrongs will make it right I'm
[1:52:59] allowed to be as childish as they are
[1:53:01] that's not the way it works if they
[1:53:03] don't apologize then we shouldn't have
[1:53:04] to apologize no that's not the way a
[1:53:06] Christian
[1:53:08] acts like I said I I I I didn't share
[1:53:10] the details but my son got scammed on a
[1:53:13] part off Facebook and my flesh went
[1:53:16] there and I'd figured out how to get let
[1:53:18] make that man lose his job and
[1:53:20] everything I'd figured it out
[1:53:23] but I didn't do it but what was it the
[1:53:25] flesh rose
[1:53:27] up the flesh rose up because I want
[1:53:29] Justice I want a man to act like a man
[1:53:32] rather than act like a child and he
[1:53:33] wouldn't do
[1:53:36] it what I had to do humble myself and
[1:53:40] say Lord that's that's the
[1:53:43] flesh that ain't me that ain't what I
[1:53:45] want to be and lay it down and walk away
[1:53:48] into God's grace I've never had an issue
[1:53:49] with it
[1:53:50] since but I had to let the flesh settle
[1:53:55] down he says then the Holy Spirit takes
[1:53:58] its flight temper breeds temper but he
[1:54:00] comes back with and love breeds love be
[1:54:03] full of love Jesus said by this will all
[1:54:06] men know you're my disciples when you
[1:54:07] have love one for another that's the
[1:54:10] fruit of the holy spirit is love he says
[1:54:13] and did you know you're a little Creator
[1:54:15] yourself certainly you've seen people
[1:54:18] that you just love to be
[1:54:20] around we do don't we
[1:54:23] he says just that loving type of person
[1:54:26] just as kind you like to be around them
[1:54:29] how do they do it why are they like
[1:54:32] this they create that atmosphere oh you
[1:54:37] say they got a special
[1:54:38] gift he says by the life they
[1:54:42] live you need to live the right kind of
[1:54:46] Life by the way they
[1:54:49] talk uhoh
[1:54:53] how great a fire the tongue
[1:54:57] kindleth we'd all be better off without
[1:55:02] tongues fact
[1:55:05] Checkers
[1:55:07] right they create that atmosphere three
[1:55:11] ways the way they
[1:55:13] live sorry two the way they talk he says
[1:55:16] their
[1:55:18] conversation the more you talk about bad
[1:55:21] things the more those bad bad things
[1:55:22] will affect your
[1:55:26] life if you're dwelling on
[1:55:28] negativity Your Atmosphere will be
[1:55:31] negative if you're dwelling on
[1:55:34] positivity which is the word guess what
[1:55:36] you'll have a positive attitude not
[1:55:40] talking psychology here but there is a
[1:55:41] certain element of psychology listen if
[1:55:44] we're facing Str struggles and trials
[1:55:46] and tribulations and all we talk about
[1:55:49] is those things whoever got better
[1:55:52] talking about how bad things are going
[1:55:53] to
[1:55:54] get we don't that's
[1:55:58] psychology it we're never going to walk
[1:56:00] away feeling better because we talked
[1:56:01] about how bad things are going to
[1:56:05] be they create that Atmosphere by the
[1:56:07] life they live the way they talk their
[1:56:10] conversation he says then you've seen
[1:56:12] those that every time you shun them all
[1:56:15] the time they want to talk about
[1:56:16] something evil and talk about somebody
[1:56:18] say oh my there they come they're going
[1:56:19] to criticize somebody there he's in here
[1:56:21] now he's going to talk talk about this
[1:56:22] man you just hate to get around them see
[1:56:25] they create seemingly pretty nice people
[1:56:29] but they create that
[1:56:30] atmosphere now here he comes down we're
[1:56:33] going to walk away from the church this
[1:56:35] morning with this on our minds and the
[1:56:37] things that you think on the things that
[1:56:40] you do the actions the things you talk
[1:56:44] about create un
[1:56:48] atmosphere amen God bless you let's
[1:56:50] stand together if we would this morning
[1:56:52] like I said we wanted to go into the
[1:56:54] fruits of the spirit but I had this kind
[1:56:55] of set up in my notes already and it
[1:56:58] kind of produces where we're going to go
[1:57:00] now cuz I want the fruit of the spirit I
[1:57:02] want love joy and peace and patience and
[1:57:04] kindness and these different things amen
[1:57:06] but he says listen you've got to set an
[1:57:09] atmosphere the things you think on the
[1:57:11] things you do your actions the things
[1:57:14] you talk about create an
[1:57:16] atmosphere you talk about the word
[1:57:18] you'll get a word result you talk about
[1:57:20] things that are bad you'll get a bad
[1:57:21] result
[1:57:23] and it'll Cloud your mind and it'll
[1:57:24] Cloud Your Atmosphere it'll cloud cloud
[1:57:26] your attitude and pretty soon nobody's
[1:57:28] going to want to be around me if all I
[1:57:29] talk about is a bad things listen Monday
[1:57:31] could be a real bad day for
[1:57:34] Canada
[1:57:36] economically who
[1:57:38] cares it's all going to burn it's all
[1:57:40] going to go I got a body change waiting
[1:57:44] I got a Rapture to make I got work to
[1:57:47] do this kind of work man we got to get
[1:57:51] out of here and let me tell you unless
[1:57:52] it gets hard we're probably not going to
[1:57:54] want to get out nearly so much things
[1:57:56] are going to come but I'm not going to
[1:57:58] dwell on it I'm going to dwell on that
[1:58:01] being a sign of the positive that's
[1:58:03] coming amen that as you see these things
[1:58:06] look up your Redemption draws nigh I'll
[1:58:09] focus on the Redemption not on the fact
[1:58:11] that it's going to hell in a hand
[1:58:13] basket we can do that same thing in
[1:58:15] amongst
[1:58:16] ourselves whether it's within the body
[1:58:18] outside of the body don't focus on what
[1:58:21] is not
[1:58:22] focus on what is by the word focus on
[1:58:26] the Promises listen when Abraham made
[1:58:29] his choice with
[1:58:31] lot what he chose did not look good
[1:58:35] compared to lot but his had a promise
[1:58:37] attached to it and he got his promise
[1:58:41] and lot lost his wife had an incestuous
[1:58:43] relationship with his daughters as a
[1:58:46] drunk he didn't see that coming but he
[1:58:50] chose that which had no promise attached
[1:58:53] we walk a narrow road a tight Road a
[1:58:56] pressing road but it's got a promise
[1:58:59] along it and it's got a promise at the
[1:59:01] end of it amen and that's what we want
[1:59:03] to dwell on as Believers amen God bless
[1:59:07] you let's bow our heads Heavenly
[1:59:11] Father Lord the last words I see on the
[1:59:14] notes before me say don't
[1:59:17] fuss Lord I pray you help me not to fuss
[1:59:22] not to pick pull
[1:59:26] poke chew things over and over lord
[1:59:31] God lord I pray you help me to take your
[1:59:33] word help us each one to dwell on those
[1:59:37] things which are good and right and pure
[1:59:39] and of a good report Lord to dwell on
[1:59:41] those things which have
[1:59:43] promise to dwell on those things which
[1:59:45] have healing Deliverance strength
[1:59:48] encouragement Lord and yes the
[1:59:50] correction that we need as well
[1:59:53] Lord I pray you help us to set a right
[1:59:56] atmosphere Lord your Prophet said the
[1:59:58] right attitude towards any promise of
[2:00:01] God can bring it to pass in your
[2:00:03] life Lord we need your promised word
[2:00:07] every single bit of it this morning Lord
[2:00:09] God help us to set the right atmosphere
[2:00:12] I
[2:00:13] pray Lord not looking to the
[2:00:16] others looking in your
[2:00:19] word let that be our yay and amen
[2:00:24] Lord give us patience one for
[2:00:26] another Lord we're all
[2:00:29] growing some are ahead of us some of us
[2:00:31] are
[2:00:33] behind Lord but give us patience one for
[2:00:36] another let us recognize each as a part
[2:00:38] of the body they have their place they
[2:00:41] have their purpose they have their value
[2:00:43] Lord and let us focus on
[2:00:46] that or for Jesus said by this shall all
[2:00:49] men know you're my disciples that you
[2:00:51] have love love one for another help us
[2:00:54] to love Lord
[2:00:56] unconditionally graciously mercifully
[2:00:58] Lord with a loving heart we pray in
[2:01:01] Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[2:01:04] amen I know I sing it a lot but pour
