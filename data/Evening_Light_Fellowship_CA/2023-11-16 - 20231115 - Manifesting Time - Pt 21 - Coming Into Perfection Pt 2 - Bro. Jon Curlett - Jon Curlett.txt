pray Lord grant us a touch this evening in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you let's turn if we would to 1 Corinthians 13 again 1 Corinthians 13 amen welcome brother Matt up to the front seats here amen it's good to take a break and appreciate the hard work that he puts in as a deacon and soundboard and video system and all those things but it's good to see him take a break as well I've served many years 10 12 years as a deacon and doing all those things actually all the things that he's been doing and is done and and let me tell you you give up something to do that you lose part of the service because you're being careful and you're watchful for other things not related to the preaching and whatnot and you pay a price for that but I believe God has no unpaid debts amen and that he's met the need as well but we're thankful for what brother Matt's done but we do welcome his opportunity to sit in the service and not have to look around and watch around the same way he does when he's at the back there amen certainly appreciate the prayers for Blanca and the boys as they head to California for three weeks on Saturday and just praying God's traveling mercies to them and his keeping Grace to me uh Lord willing I'll head head out to to go moose hunting uh after service on Sunday the 26th or the 27th whichever one that is so I'll be gone for a week Lord willing but I'll be back the following Sunday and brother Paul will take the Wednesday Service as he usually does Amen so keep him in prayer as well amen we're going to continue in what we started last service in 1 Corinthians 13 and Paul says though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol you know he says I become he says something changed something made me like that he said I become like a noisy gong I wasn't always a noisy gong but something happened he says and it can't be charity that does those things though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing verse 8 says this charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things amen God bless the reading of his word you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing on this thought of manifesting time and I'm taking a second service on this thought of coming into Perfection and we know that this idea of coming to per Perfection Paul says this is what happens after you've done through the doctrines and after you've done the first works and after your faith in in the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ and you know it's amazing that the focus we have on Doctrine in the message because really that's foundational and Paul's saying you got to get the foundation right and youve got to build a certain way but you can't stay just on that Foundation you can't just rest on the fact that you have a foundation but a foundation is meant for something to be built on and in the message we have the doctrine and we we've got to have the right Doctrine if you get the doctrine wrong then everything else is going to be wrong that's the structure it's the backbone it's the skeleton of the Christian walk and but the the simple fact is is that Doctrine is the most comfortable place to stay as a Christian right you can just say well this is what I believe and this is what it says and and this is what makes us different and in the in the message really so many thing the thing that makes us the the most different is our Doctrine when you go and you start talking about godhead and you start looking at original sin and even marriage and divorce and these different things uh predestination the way that we truly believe it it's not preached anywhere else generally speaking and you might hear a little bit of it here and a little bit there but in the full body that we have of Truth as we believe it you won't find that anywhere else and it's easy to sit there and say that's what makes us different and it is what makes us different but it's not our resting place it's not where we stop it's it's not the only thing that that we care about you know with with a little bit of study even our young people could confound many theologians today there's a a sister that I know from out west and she was doing a degree and it had nothing to do with religion but as one of her electives she had to do a religion class and so the professor had them write a paper on a certain Doctrine or a certain theological idea and so for her it was easy she just went to the message and she looked up what brother brandham said and she looked at the scriptures that he had pulled out of the scriptures and so she put it into her own words and she put it together and she handed it into him and he came to her later on and he said where did you get this he said you didn't come up with this why cuz he'd never seen the word put together that way he had never seen the the the Pieces come together in the way that she had put it together but he said you didn't come up with this why I believe he recognized Revelation when he saw it and she said I believe that God sent a prophet in this age and he was restoring us back to the full truth of the scriptures and this is what he taught us and this is what I believe but he was amazed it blew his mind the understanding that she had as a sister not as a minister not as a theologian but just a person that had been raised under the doctrines and truths of this message the full word being restored that this man that had taught it for a lifetime and studied it a lifetime she brought him something in a way that he had never seen it before but that's not the end of it that's not the end of it and Paul said you know we read in the scriptures where he says had leaving behind the doctrines and and of faith in Jesus Christ and of repentance of dead works and and these different things he says let us go on to Perfection from that place don't don't don't throw that away but you've got to move on from there you've got to come up from that place amen it's not enough Paul said to have this intellectual conception of of Doctrine or even the Mysteries we want the Mysteries we need a revelation of the Mysteries but it has to be a revealing not up here but a revealing that comes through us because that's what it's supposed to do it's supposed to change us it's supposed to do something inside of our lives and Paul said though I understand all Mysteries all Mysteries he's the prophet of the age if there's somebody that understand understood the Mysteries it was Paul and Paul said though I understand all Mysteries and have all Faith to move mountains without this Divine love without this charity he says I am nothing I am nothing there's no lower form than nothing you can't get lower than nothing you know what nothing is lower than nobody cuz nobody's at least a person there are no good person but at least they're a person but a nothing isn't even a rock or a piece of dirt or mud nothing means you don't exist there is nothing about you that would cause anybody to take notice of you you're are completely unworthy you're unnoticeable Paul says I'm nothing not just nobody but I'm nothing if I don't have that and that's what brother Brandon would get at when he get into the token in these things he says whatever you do make sure you get it because that's what's going to make you something that's what's going to make you something in the kingdom of God Amen brother Brandon would say this the in the message the working of the Holy Spirit CU he's trying to remind the people you the problem often isn't how you start it's how you get it's what you come into things change in our life and we start to think something of ourselves he says but long ago you remember when your heart used to be so tender and pure before God oh you didn't mind the troubles my it's all right just let it go on he says the first thing you know when you got that temper up and said I'll get back at him the dove took her flight the Holy Spirit cannot stand anything but gentleness God's gentleness and peace and loving no matter how much you know how much theology you know how you can stick your chest out and how well you can preach that doesn't mean nothing Paul confirmed it he's just repeating Paul's words here I am nothing Paul said he said if that quiet gentle quiet loving spirit of God doesn't rest on you it's all gone he says everything else is gone there's nothing there that's worthy to talk about you're nothing he says no matter how many gifts you can show no matter though Paul said though I can speak in tongues like men and angels I could have enough Faith to move mountains and Have Not That gentle Meek love I am nothing he says that's where your trouble lays remember last time we we talked about that that idea that we we're we're lips but no life we speak but we don't live it or or or we're words and no walk and there's nothing of true Eternal value unless you can come into this place which is the eternal life of God the Divine love of God otherwise you know what we are good citizens at best good citizens nothing wrong with a good citizen but good citizens aren't going into Rapture God's not calling out good citizens God's calling out a bride that's spotless that's perfect under the hearing and the application of the word of God in their life but Paul you know I don't want to focus so much on the idea that we're nothing but we're going to continue in that for a little bit but I want to start with what charity is first because we want to see how we compare to charity cuz Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13 which we just read he says charity never faileth now now here's a here's something in life that we're never supposed to do and and if you're married you'll know this you are never supposed to make anything in absolute you're never supposed to say you never do this or you always do that because it's never true it's never true when we're talking about something somebody has as a habit they may often do it they may mostly do it they may regularly do it but they don't always do it or you say you never do this well no I do it occasionally but I don't do it as much as I don't do it and so what happens is we turn it into an absolute but Paul now this is the prophet speaking this is the holy spirit speaking through Paul says charity never fath that's an absolute and there's only one absolute you'll ever find and that's God God is the only absolute the word of God is the only thing and that word never fail it that word fails means never fails it never runs out it never becomes Obsolete and it never comes to an end that means you can't go around it you can't go above it you can't go under it you can't go through it it's everywhere and it surrounds and it's all powerful and it has it's the greatest thing that God could ever give us he says but whether there be prophecies they'll fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away and we spoke last service about how this expression of Charity has to come down into an Earthly expression and it's in how we treat people and how we respond or how we don't respond as the case may be but we know that humanly speaking eventually we hit the end of our rope there there just comes a point where we where we can't take it anymore we where stress gets to us where life gets to us where tiredness gets to us where the kids get to us the spouse gets to us the boss gets to us whatever it is and we hit the end of our rope and humanly speaking when we hit the end of the Rope bad things happen it that's the way it is but Paul says here there's something that we have available to us there's a remedy there's a resource that never fails that never fails and it's called charity it's a Divine love but otherwise without it what happens is eventually we get to the point where we say enough is enough and we we go to that person that's been throwing us under the bus we go back and we start saying the thing same things that the person's been saying about us we start giving as good as we've been getting and charity has no place in it but Paul says when you come into charity charity will take you on when you hit the end of the Rope charity will keep you acting the way you're supposed to act even if you don't want to there's no end to it you can't use up all of this charity Paul says when it's in you there is no end to it because he said charity is longsuffering it's kind it doesn't Envy it thinks good things about people doesn't get arrogant it loves the truth and it's able to Bear every burden that's put on it that's a phenomenal thing you know we we're looking for super materials today you know in engineering we've got carbon fiber Nano tubes and and we've got these these wonderful materials that we have now that can take massive amounts of straight straight uh of load and and they're extremely light and we can do amazing things with them but there's nothing we have that can take an infite load everything get has a breaking point but Paul says charity never breaks never runs out it never even weakens it just is and it stays there and it's unmoving and it's unbreakable and you can't change it we're we're a supernatural people we believe in a supernatural God and when it comes to this sort of thing it's a supernatural event in our life it's a supernatural experience because all of those other things were attributes they're built into us the the the seven things we talked about from faith all the way up to brotherly kindness as a child of God God's put them in your heart to do those things David had those things without the Holy Ghost you'll see it through the prophets you'll see it through the Believers throughout the Bible they had these things without having the Holy Ghost it's the nature of a Believer to have them but now we're coming into something that's beyond that and it's a resource that remedy I was talking about that's been made available to us and it's the one thing it's funny Paul says add to this charity and yet we can't add it we can't add it we can receive it but we can't get it we can take it but we can't earn it it's a gift that's freely given to us I can't do anything to make myself have this but I can go to the one that offers it and I can go through the process he requires that he'll give it to me amen if I'll come in in in the right way but we know that this is the greatest Supernatural thing in our life because it never fails he said there's there's gifts and there's tongues and prophecies and all these things people fail Ministries fail parents fail spouses fail Believers fail brother br's going to tell us how how how how much we can fail here when we read some quotes in a bit but he says charity never fails so that means it's not me I got to worry about what I got to worry about is do I have the charity that never fails I'll always fail eventually I'll always fail but if I've got charity and I can surrender to charity then as long as I'm surrendered to charity everything will work out I won't fail I can't fail amen everything man has come up with has failed everything that that that that we deal with in life has failed every every idea every technology has failed but yet Paul says charity never fails and I want you to catch this because he said what he's saying is without charity we're nothing we're nothing without the holy ghost in your life you are nothing when it comes to things of Eternal value amen we're we're a noisy gong we're Hypocrites we're failur we're incapable of getting out of Our Own Way much less helping somebody get out of their problems amen but I want you to catch this as much as we are nothing without charity with Charity we are still nothing that's the point is to stay nothing when you've got it because otherwise you'll fail because you're in the way of Charity the idea is to stay small when you get it to stay humble to make yourself nothing to get in a position where we truly believe that in this flesh dwells no good thing as the scripture says but if he's dwelling in it then that's all the goodness that we're looking for Amen brother B would say this speaking of Believers he says no matter whether they don't know their ABCs or not they can know Christ certainly never can get too low may God always keep that Spirit In Me sure I want that spirit in me I will not think I'm better than somebody else he says I could stick my chest out and say all the people stand when I come in or I have the greatest campaign of them all he could say those things thingss he could say that people stood when he came in the room he did have the greatest campaigns in the history of the world as far as we know it terms of size half a million people 30,000 come to the altars at one time signs and wonders like we've never seen since the times of Jesus he could say all these things he said who am I anyhow but the clay that God has made let me humble myself that his life will be reflected he said lets all Christians feel like that he says knowledge gets us nowhere we're not preaching Ignorance by any means we've got educated people in here we've got people that use the education and knowledge on a daily basis and uncommon knowledge they've had to go to school and get training they've had to get training on the jobs and we're not preaching about ignorance amen but when you tried knowledge you'll realize that eventually knowledge Runs Out Your Capacity for knowledge runs out and that's why you go to something greater than you is because you are the limitation there's more knowledge than I have capacity so I'm the limitation when it comes to knowledge and yet the knowledge if I could have it all would do me no good I would still come to the end of the of the road of knowledge it can only get me so far amen when it comes to the supernatural life of the believer knowledge is not our key knowledge is not the key faith is the key that opens the door knowledge doesn't open the door we need knowledge we've got to knows the these things I was reading in Acts the other morning where brother where brother Paul brother Paul yes exact ly Paul comes to the the this Altar and it says it was to the unknown God their knowledge ran out they knew there was something more than what they had but they didn't know his name or her name they didn't know who or what it was and Paul said let me introduce you to the unknown God the thing you've been missing the thing you know you need I'll I can tell you all about them and Paul LED them to a Christ and and and it was these and and he brought them to the Holy Spirit and these different things but knowledge is not our resting place but it's a part of the journey to get the Holy Ghost you've got to know who God Is by experience but you got to know him by his word and that means you've got to have knowledge it's a part of those seven attributes we talked about but we don't come before the Throne of God with our knowledge or our understanding we don't come to him with Lord I know there's no point brother brah said God loves to have his word repeated back to him so you don't come with your knowledge you come with his and you say Lord your word says and your word tells me this and your word tells me to do this and your word tells me to do that but you don't come in and sayl I know this or I know that no I know what your word says and that's where my faith rests but job was a perfect man according to God job was a perfect believer but job talked to God when things got tough and job got a little caught up in himself if you look in the scriptures why job thought he was something instead of nothing job got out of position God God had declared job to be the greatest believer on the planet job was so good that God bragged about him to Satan that that's how amazing job's Christian walk was if I could put it that way and yet what happened when things got tough job started looking at himself and thinking I'm too good for the problems that God has laid on my doorstep and job started thinking of himself to be great in comparison to God or even worthy of comparison to God and God didn't take it too well in job 40 then this is what God said it said moreover the Lord answered job and said shall he that contendeth shall he that argues with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth God let him answer it so job job got dad got got dad job got God riled up and God said job are you serious you're going to argue with me and you're going to instruct me about what's going on are you serious and job answered the Lord and said behold I am vile sometimes church I think we really need to realize we're vile outside of the shed blood of Jesus Christ we are vile you know I was thinking on this just in preparation for this service and there is so much to shake our heads at in this world you look at people and you don't know whether to laugh cry or slap you just don't it is a mess out there and you know what it is easy to think that with our intelligence with our Common Sense we would never end up with th in the place that those people are thinking the things they do believing the things they do doing the things they do acting the way they act believing we think we would never get there but but for the grace of God we would be there because without the grace of God we wouldn't have had the parents we did we wouldn't have the family lineage we had we wouldn't have the genetics we did it is the grace of God in every aspect of our life that makes us able to to be what we are here today job said I am vile what shall I answer Thee I will lay my hand upon my mouth he said once I have I spoken but I will not answer yay twice he talked twice he said but I will proceed no further job was in a hole but he wasn't going to dig it any deeper he shuts up he says I'm just going to put my hand over my mouth and be quiet I'm vile now God talks to job for the next couple of chapters and job finally gets the big picture and realizes really what he is in job 42 it says then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou can do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge he says therefore have I uttered that I understood not he he said I said something I didn't understand truly he said and things too wonderful for me which I knew not God showed him things that he had no clue about hadn't even thought about and God said job tell me this and tell me this and tell me this and tell me this and job said I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know in his heart because he had his hand over his mouth he couldn't answer he says here I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare unto me I have heard thee by the hearing of the ear he says but now mine ey seeth thee now mine ey seeth me he saw something he hadn't seen before he says wherefore I abhor myself and repent in dust and Ashes you reminded me of what it says in Revelation 3 when it's speaking to the Leo Dean Church age it says you're rich increased in goods and have need think you have need of nothing he says and you know not that your poor wretched miserable blind and naked and don't even know it job in the presence of God just hearing God give a little dissertation for a couple chapters realized I'm nothing I know nothing I have nothing I'm bringing nothing to the table here and I'm just going to shut up and listen for a while job didn't just repent because repentance is the key remember we've said it before brother Braham said the Zeal for this age is to repent to say I I am nothing compared to what I'm supposed to be I'm nothing compared to what God has for me and if I can stay in that place of understanding I'm nothing then he'll bring me into the riches of his goodness and Grace of the word but that word abore we think of that it's not a common word today but we think of it as as to to hate or dislike but it's deeper than that abhor means to refuse to reject to despise so so job said I refuse myself I reject myself I despise myself what's he rejecting his short-sighted knowledge his lack of understanding his idea that he knows something he's learned to reject himself so that God could do something greater in his life than has ever happened job's had a great life he's a tremendous believer he's been blessed he's done great charitable Works he's got a a fantastic relationship with God but as great as job is he is still His Own Worst Enemy he's still the one that gets in the way and he was thinking that he was something amen the only thing that holds us back in our lives that holds God back in our lives is us I'm My Own Worst Enemy especially when I get to thinking that I'm something that I know something that I have a some sort of depth or anything I may have more than I used to but in the big picture I'm still nothing and I know nothing brother R will put it this way he says but then the real real thing is this nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling oh God naked come to thee for dress oh I most humbly come Christ confessing that I am nothing and there's nothing Within Me receive me oh God he's combining the the verses of that song and and some words of his own he says then God receives you now you might not even know your ABCs you might not know coffee from split peas you might not know right from left hand it don't make any difference what you don't know there's only thing there's one thing you must know that Jesus Christ took your place as a sinner and you take your place to stand in his righteousness Now watch how this looks confessing every day that you're wrong and love him with all your heart and your whole motives be set towards him he says you'll make Heaven before your feet Hit the Floor Lord I'm wrong and your word is Right Lord I love you help me to show it and Lord let my motive be to express you today he says if you do that you'll make Heaven he says that's all there is to it for the life that was in Christ has to be in you or your lost that's hard preaching but it's simple it's simple keep your eyes stayed on him keep your motives stayed on him motives he would say this in the message influence before we can get influence we've got to one recognize God that's a knowledge and that's an experience he says then we've got to be clean we've got to be Sanctified he says and then we've got to be humble and the only way you can be humble is you die to yourself and say I'm nothing he says we've got to get ourselves down and know and just keep imagining and knowing how little you are we tend to do the opposite as humans imagine how great we are he says get to imagining how little you are he says you are nothing I am nothing none of us is anything but he is all he is worthy of all praise oh Lamb of God what we need is to go back to the temple we need to go back to the altar of God and to make an altar in our own Hearts where that we can surrender ourselves and then see the Lord God of hosts come down in this last days and do what he did when he was here here first he says then you'll understand it and cry woe is me but see the problem with job is that job got into a rough place and he lost everything and job got indignant job was thinking I've been too good of a Believer for this to happen to me Jo thought his job thought his Perfection was about what he did and if you look in in the in the Book of Job if you go into chapter 31 it says that they the the the the the four that gathered around him shut up because they saw that job was righteous in his own eyes and if you read in Job 31 all he can say is I did this I I I I I he says when somebody was sick I I helped them out when they had needed food I gave it to them when there was poor I gave them money I shared everything I had I did everything I could there was nothing more you could have expected of my life I I I I I he got self-righteous what was it see remember job sacrificed every day and the scripture says he did it even for his children lest they made a mistake and didn't know about it but job forgot that he sacrificed for himself too if he was so perfect he wouldn't need the sacrifice but yet he sacrificed as well job forgot that his Perfection was through the grace of God not through his works it's not just what he did or what he didn't do but it's the fact that he was born in sin shaped in iniquity the same as the rest of us that he needed that sacrifice before him amen not job's actual performance was his Perfection but it was the grace of God and we know job got straightened out in the end and that was the grace of God it's the grace of God that keeps coming back to us you know if we were some great person if you know can you imagine you know brother Joe or brother Chad as as owners of a company or brother Mark as a senior manager or something and and you have some guy that just starts his first day and he comes up and starts trying to tell you how to do things and what you're doing wrong that's that's the the equivalent of job coming to God coming up and saying you shouldn't do this to me and you shouldn't do that and I've done this and I've done that God straightened him out most of us would just fire a person that did that to us God doesn't fire his children he brings them through the fire it brings them to a greater Revelation a greater understanding a greater place and job walked out of this with a revelation that he said My Redeemer Lives that was the greatest desire of job's heart and he came out of it but it took a conversation with god where job had to Humble himself and then God showed job the very thing that he'd been looking for through all of it but Paul had a better Revelation up front you know why cuz Paul got humbled immediately Paul had to get knocked off of his literal high horse and God knocked the took the sails out of his his wind out of the wind out of his sails knock the wind right out of him literally and he he lands and he realizes I'm nothing I I'm Antichrist Paul was a literal Antichrist for the first part of his life amen job had this Rich imagination of his own goodness but Paul said everything I have it's but dung it's poop it's nothing it's worthless I'm nothing and in that he would take us all the way over to Galatians 2 because Paul knew that his ability to be Godly was just as just as as good as his ability to fly he couldn't do it so Paul would tell us in Galatians he says I am crucified with Christ in other words Paul's saying I'm dead just as Christ is as Christ was I am dead I died with him and I'm still dead that's what he's saying I'm still dead but then he gives us this Paradox he says but nevertheless I live but there's a difference now in the life that he's living because he says yet not I but Christ liveth in me he says I'm still dead but there's a life in me and it's Christ that's living in me and that's why I can be the person I am today and do the things I do I was reading in the scriptures where it said God did special Wonders by Paul's hand God set him on a pedestal God did things through Paul that he didn't do through anybody else why because Paul realized I'm nothing he said the life I live he says uh which I now live in the flesh I now live in the flesh he used to live a life In the Flesh he's living another life but he's living a different life he's living by the same word but it's through the different lens why because he's got a holy ghost now he's got charity in his life and it's doing something different in him he applies the word he was blind but now we can see he said the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Paul's Paul's the one that's calling us to Perfection and he takes time to remind us that this is not going to be through your works this Perfection we have is not through our Deeds but it's through Christ himself it's through faith in Christ it's by the love of Christ it's the love of Christ in you it's the love of Christ for you it's the love of Christ that's doing the work in each and every one of us brother Adam puts this in that that same message of Hebrews he says perfected speaking of us absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us are you above Temptation he says never but I'm sinless spotless and blameless but not above Temptation do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and God could no more judge us than nothing he couldn't be righteous he's already judged Us in him and when he judged Christ he judged me he judged you and he can't judge me again because he took my judgment if I've been redeemed he is the one that he's looking at remember Paul never said we never fail Paul said charity never fails Perfection isn't of us it's on the one that's inside of us amen we were judged in Christ when he died on Calvary and our Perfection is in a perfect sacrifice and God's looking now he looked at that that that lamb that died there that Bloody torn whipped shredded naked bleeding sinless man that of his own will and by his own love gave his love for you gave his life for you and I and he's looking at that that the reason he can see Perfection is because he's looking at that he doesn't even have to look at us he's looking at the Perfection of Christ amen and so if that's what he's looking at if we're going to go into Perfection it has to be a going into Christ Christ the person the word living out inside of each and every one of us amen that is perfection Christ is our Perfection that's our place of perfection that's our per of Person of expression uh of perfection and we're coming from God and we're going back to God and that's what he's looking at he's looking at our position in Christ he's looking at our place in Christ brother B says this he is that Fountain no other Fountain I know nothing but the blood of Jesus I'm a stinker he says the prophet of the age the seals have been opened it's a new book it's an open book and he says I'm a stinker I'm a renegade this is a an adopted son of God Prophet to the age seven Church age messenger the angel to the age and he says I'm a stinker and I'm a renegade unless we think anything of ourselves he says every one of us is if we stopped the service there what would we do he says but before God we are perfect he says be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how can you be because a perfect one represents us there that Fountain is there every day fresh not something stagnated something but fresh every day that washes away all my sins he is that Fountain we're talking about coming into Perfection realize that we are nothing and saying that he is my sufficiency he is My All In All he is My Sacrifice he is my representation if every day we'd realize that we'd be so much closer I think keep it before us how's it going to happen how are we going to come into this Perfection how do you come in this Divine love this agape love this charity we're talking about brother Bram says this that's the way it is living for Christ you just love him with all your so heart soul and mind and go on that's all there's no evil can come out that's right cuz in here all things you're dead you are dead and your life is hidden God through Christ sealed in there by the Holy Spirit how's the devil going to get you when you get that charity he says just keep loving God and it cannot fail how can the devil get you you're sealed you're settled you're anchored we're on the boat to China he says you take a box car they'll start loading it and loading it on the track many of you people here know I know some of you that load cars they'll go around they'll call for so much here and so much there but before that car can be sealed the inspector has to come along he looks through and he sees that everything is in there is tight and everything is ready tight and ready he says it's going to its destination well if there's anything loose and he's afraid it'll break he'll say take her out fix her over again until you get it and when it's all together tightened and packed and set down that he'll slam the doors and seal it and no one can break that seal until it goes to its destination he says is that right he says that's the way it is where it says in Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed into the day of your Redemption he says you got some loose rattles God will take it out of you and fix it up before you're sealed into the kingdom this is a shaking time this is a time where everything that can be shaken will be shaken amen we're when we're coming into the statue of a perfect man it's knocking out everything that's loose it's knocking out every bit of sand it's knocking every bit of humanity of all the Frailty that we have and it's putting in the attributes of God and it's strengthening and building us up in the stature of Christ and it's breaking us first and molding us and shaping us and then firming us up so that our life can be changed amen remember brother BR says he puts real material into the house that he builds it's tried and tested and it's been gone through the the quality assurance program and it's known what it is it's a known quantity that it's going to stand the test of time why don't we change why do we let the rattles stick around what is it he says you can't get in there with the rattles what is it that holds that back it comes from a refusal to hear or obey the full word of God Hebrews 12 Paul said see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he ha promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken this New Covenant this this this gospel is taking out those things that can be shaken he says as of things that are made things that are man-made things that are human that's all got to go he says that those things which cannot be shaken May remain God will shake anything that's not Eternal and move it on out so that all that's left is the stuff that'll stand the test of time you go to Revelation 3 and and and and John writes there that that it says hear what the spirit say to the churches that's what gets the rattles out because what happened is that the holy spirit's trying to say something but it's not coming by me or you it's coming by an Angel there's only one person ever got to hear what the Holy Spirit had to say for this age and that was the seventh Church age messenger and without that we know nothing we're in denomination but he comes and and the Seven Angel messenger comes and he shook up the denominations and he shook up the warm and fuzzy feeling that they had in that day because remember they were just putting their name on the books and signing this and they were baptizing this and sprinkling that and and getting their card of fellowship and thinking I'm going to make it and he said you can't do that you got to get the Holy Ghost you can't stop at gifts you got to get the person you got to get the giver of those gifts and what did he do he shook everything up and some people went and they said I can't take I can't be shaken and so they went and huddled in a corner with their other four but there were people that were called out and said that's me I know there's more and so they walked away from those things that can be shaken to come into something that could not be shaken and what was it it was the fullness of the word of God and he went in and he tore apart all of those doctrines and he tore down all of those denominational barriers he didn't care if you were black white yellow or red he didn't care about your education level he didn't care if you went to school he didn't care what your what Your the theological background was he didn't care what your family was he cared if you would hear the word and that's all he was looking for was somebody that would hear what the spirit was saying to the churches if you ever hear the word of God it'll shake your life it will shake your life to the very core it has to because there are things that can be shaken that have to be taken out without the shaking they'll remain amen what did the prophet messenger do he called a people to an overcoming position in Christ he preached Jesus Christ the same yesterday to today and forever he showed them their position in Christ and said you're not just called to it but you're prophesied to be in that place you're prophesied to be in a place of Victory and this word will come and it'll Shake us to the core it doesn't muck about it doesn't baby us it doesn't cudle us but it lays it in your lap it lays it in your lap and says this day that's what Moses did that's what Joshua did this day I give you the word choose choose you this day whom you will serve but as for me and my house we'll serve the Lord he laid it in their laps and Moses did it I've been reading Deuteronomy and my personal devotions and and and Moses I mean he wrote book after book of all this and then Deuteronomy he goes through and he does a CO's notes of everything they need to do he says you weren't here for the first bit you might have been too young you weren't around to see the original Miracles you wouldn't remember it he says so I'm going to lay it all out for you again and this is just days weeks before they go into the promised land he laid it it in their laps and he says here's what happens if you accept the word and here's what happens if you don't amen you know I was going through old me emails uh earlier this week and I had about 18,000 in my inbox going all the way back to 2004 and I realized I didn't really need them and as some of you know I'll use my phone as a dictation device and when inspiration strikes I'll just hit the the button on it and start recording and it transcribes it and I put it in an email and then I send it to myself cuz it'll H it can happen at work it can happen driving in the car can happen anywhere out for a walk and so I'd sent myself an email as I was going through these emails something caught my eye and I read it and it it just had this question here it said this why do people go to something at their level to get Deliverance or change or answers when what's at their level hasn't given them what they need already why do we go to something that's where we're at if where we're at isn't working if where we're at hasn't given us the answers we need remember what the a the the angel said to John he said come up hither he had to get up into the heavenlies he had to come up a little higher before he could understand things that were going on but in other words if if we look at this saying why do we think we can stay where we're at and get results we haven't yet gotten no I'm not talking about if you've been training and you can only lift 100 lb and and that means you'll never lift 120 if you fail today if you keep training that going to happen but if you hit a plateau that's what we're talking about is a plateau if you've been doing something if you've been uh walking a certain way if you've been training a certain way eating a certain way practicing learning and you can only come to here and then you stay there for a long time you've got to come up to a different level to move past that plateau and it's the hardest thing to do in weight training is you can work so hard but you get to a point where you can't progress and you've got to break the cycle and you got to do something different to get your muscles shocked out of their way but as a Believer we're not looking for shock but we're looking to come up higher you can come so far and you can get so much Victory and you can get so close to God but there comes a point where something's got to break something's got to change otherwise you're going to stay where you are you you know what the the old saying is right if you keep doing what you're doing you'll keep getting what you're getting and that's the way it is for us we never stand still brother brandham said he said we're either moving forward or backsliding and if you're not moving forward you're backsliding because the word of God keeps pushing us forward amen we've got to come up to a higher place and that's what Paul is saying with Charity you know when he said that he said I'll read it here he says for we know in part we prophesy in part he's saying we're not where we ought to be but there's a there is more to come and there's a way to get there amen we've got a taste we've got a portion we've got a spoonful we got a measure but Perfection is coming coming Perfection is available and it's through this Divine love he says but when that which is perfect is come you know he says when not if what a promise if it was if you'd Wonder but he says when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away with that means there's a change between what we were and what we were doing and what we will be and what we will be doing and what we have something's got to happen in here something's got to happen that's different amen something's been done away with and something new has come and taking its place amen Paul's calling us to go into Perfection if if nothing's changing then what's happening is we're moving backwards we're stagnating and we can't be stagnant as Christians amen that means if there's more for us then there's a higher calling there's a higher place there's a higher sincerity there's a higher sanctification there's a higher humbling a lower humbling maybe we could put it that way a higher humbling takes you lower there's our Paradox for the day amen there's a greater love a greater Deliverance a greater Revelation there's a greater relationship to be had and it's going to come with me dying out to myself amen but look at this we're we're actually close to closing here this evening but look at this vision of the future that brother bradam gives us it's amazing because he does this in 1957 way before the seals are coming through and these different things but I want you to catch this Vision he says I believe it's coming to a time where Paul said where there's prophecies it shall fail where there's tongues they cease he says I believe it's coming to a time till when the saints will get together like this and just a love spirit will sweep over the audience and just every person in there all that's wrong will be taken out it'll be such a presence of the Holy Spirit he says I believe while we're to lay hands on them and pray for them now it's a contact maybe of a minister anointed and laying hands on just as a blessing to God but I believe it's coming to a time when God's church is going to be so called out so called out like that where the Saints will sit together and the Holy Spirit will just come in just woo just like it was on the day of Pentecost see and just heal the people raise up the people and great things he saysi beginning to see it happen he says ' but I believe the time is coming where it's going to be on a higher standard than that why he says after all these things is done away that which is Love Will endure forever see it's the love of God we'll just be standing preaching like this or talking and just the love will just settle over the building he says my he says you see this is the day of preaching this is the day when we got to move in and get Sinners and pull them out see what I'm I mean that's what the preaching of the word is for is to the Sinners and to bring them out but now we have to watch in there he says signs and wonders are done by the laying out of hands and so forth because it's preaching but I believe the time is coming when she's just about he says the church is about anchored away I read that and I ask the question does it matter whether you come to church you're not going to get that experience dreaming I know I'm preaching to the choir cuz you're here and we thank God that you know what when we're sick we can stream or if we're traveling we can do that but I like what brother Chad told me there a while back he said people something I'm I'm paraphrasing brother Chad people are choosing to stream services so much that they'll end up streaming the marriage supper of the Lamb you know I I listened to brother Donnie talk about this and he said you know that scripture where it says forsake not the assembling of your yourselves together all the more as you see that day approaching he says it means in person because you have to be there as a part of that body in the presence of the Lord in the presence of the Holy Spirit that's preaching that's bringing that word to a people there's something about getting together that's essential to this amen but what is it people have sacrificed being in the atmosphere and the worship and the praise and putting their shoulder to the wheel and also getting the lumps rubbed off of them for convenience for a lifestyle or for the ability to control the message and the minister that they hear it's sad you can't be a part of that Vision I just read and sit in home and stream I'm not talking about people whose Church you know churches have fallen apart and they're stuck and they can't get anywhere we're not talking about that but people that choose to do it I say you can't be a part of this Vision that's hard but it's true you need to be there in person amen this is a house of perfection a house of correction rather but that correction takes us to Perfection cuz Ephesians 4 says that he gave a fivefold Ministry for what the perfecting of the Saints until they come in unity you're not in unity out on a computer somewhere you're in unity when you can look your brother or sister in the face you can shake their hand you can put up with them on the good days and you can put up with them on the bad days and you can love them when they're nice to you and you can love them when they're not so nice to you and you can help them when they don't deserve it and you can help them when they do deserve it and in a little bit of it they'll help you out too you might actually get something out of it amen but I'm glad to be here tonight I'm glad to be here gathered with Saints with Believers of like Precious faith that want to come in and hear the preaching of the word that want to get in the presence of God that want to worship God that want to thank God for what he's done and what he's doing anden there's something about gathering with the people of God that does a special thing I believe but I'm glad we can hear a word that calls us higher and not get offended cuz guess what to be called higher we have to real realize the need to understand that there's more we have to realize that we don't have at all that we have less than maybe we thought we did and that takes a humbling that takes a humility in our lives amen but it's a power that God gives through the preaching of the word that washes us and keeps us clean and unifies us and draws us together and knocks those little lumps off of us in the process amen how are we going to get there as we start to close brother Bram said this he said he speaking of Christ showed us how it's done what did he do how did he do it by the word that's how he did it for he was the word and Jesus said if you abide in me and my words in you you're back to word again the Word of Promise The Word of Promise This is an age of Promise it's an age of Prophecy it's an age of fulfillment he says what is the Word of Promise to every Christian greater is he that's in you than he that's in the the world we're talking about charity and he says greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world then how do I overcome he says it's not me but it's the word that's in me the word is God then I overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me if you abide in me my words in you then just ask what you will he says just keep pressing up you're coming to the top as sure as anything he's encouraging us then he says see you got to come to the top he's not he's not telling he's not trying to put pressure on us as the musicians come he's not trying to put pressure on us he's trying to say you're coming to the top you're going to come to the top you got to come to the top because the word says they'll overcome the word says they'll have Victory the word says there'll be a change in their life the world says the word says that it's going to be manifested in the Believers he's saying you got to come to the top God has already ordained it God has already spoken it God has already written it and he's given you an opportunity to read it and put your name in there and say I'm a part of that that overcoming I'm a part of the victory I'm a part of that resurrection and Rapture I'm a part of that manifested word for this age why cuz the word says it'll overcome greater is he that's in you put your name there greater is he that's in me let's not put it on brother Josh let's put it on brother John let's not just put it on brother Dale let's put it on sister Blanca greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world how are we going to overcome perfect love what keeps us going what keeps us growing accepting the word of God it that simple it's so simple brother Bram I know I've said this many times and I'll I'll probably say till the day we're taken away says you want to get closer to God read your Bible and pray it's the simplest thing the simplest thing feed on the word meditate on the word ruminate on it chew on it you know what ruminating means it's what cows do they got four stomachs they eat it once then they bring it back and then you chew it again and then they do it again and they do it again they keep going over and over and over until they get every bit of nutrition out of it it's not a oneand done oh I've read that before I've heard that before oh I've seen that before no it's a day by day filling washing working experience of Christ in our lives through the word amen let's stand together if we would what's it doing this word is saying come up higher come up into Perfection come up into Christ come in a little closer come in a little deeper let go a little more they have that old song Let Go the shoreline get into the deeper waters the the cathedrals used to sing that song uh step into the water go out a little bit deeper wet your feet in the waters of God's love that's what he's asking us to do step out trust me believe believe that I'm working in you I'm working with with you amen he's got it all in control Church he's just looking for a people that'll say Lord you have the preeminence I'm trusting you I'm looking to you you're the source of life you're the strength you're the patience you're the rest you're the joy everything I have is in you Lord and then just rest and dwell on it and dwell on it you know brother Braham said dwell on he says and imagine how little you are but don't stay there imagine the greatness of the God I'm listening to God in Simplicity brother Braham says the greatness of God is that he can make himself small that he can make himself simple in thinking of all of the littleness of us don't forget the bigness of the god that's living inside of us amen that in all of that littleness and all of that nothingness and that nobody that we are yet God dained to come down and come and live inside of us and say this is my word for today you're the word you're the word you're the word that's where you stand today in Christ you're the word made flesh today amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I'm reminded of Lord that prophecy that was given to over brother brandom Lord when he made those hard decisions and it says this is your victory in the love divine Lord we're called to make hard decisions Lord we're C to live a life Lord that doesn't come with a lot of fanfare and recognition Lord and many times it may feel lonely Lord it may feel tiring and hard Lord it seems like we just go from Battle to battle but Lord may we recognize that greater is he that is in me than he that's in the world Lord that we've got a resource we've got a strength we've got a life we've got a person inside of us Lord that has overcome death hell in the grave and every demon that's in it Lord we're resting in you this evening Lord may we just recognize our place Lord in all the Frailty and faults that we have Lord we may we recognize the greatness of the god that lives inside us Lord and may it encourage us day by day Lord as we go before you in prayer Lord as we bring our needs as we bring
