[1:14:43] let's believe now
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] and believe with a complete belief
[1:14:49] no question no doubt amen
[1:14:52] we believe it is written
[1:14:55] amen hallelujah we believe the word of
[1:14:58] god
[1:14:59] hallelujah
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:01] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:15:07] yes amen
[1:15:08] all things are possible
[1:15:12] [Music]
[1:15:15] lord i
[1:15:18] believe
[1:15:21] amen and amen praise the lord god bless
[1:15:23] you turn with me to the book of romans
[1:15:26] chapter 4.
[1:15:32] sorry to keep you standing but again
[1:15:35] sometimes we we go we go to just natural
[1:15:37] things of life and we stand longer than
[1:15:38] this
[1:15:40] amen that's right sometimes people stand
[1:15:43] for them for an hour for this an hour
[1:15:44] for that
[1:15:45] they're in there they're in the things
[1:15:47] of the world so brother let's go let go
[1:15:49] and let god have his way
[1:15:51] take and we'll stand as long as he wants
[1:15:53] us to stand
[1:15:54] amen and amen in romans chapter 4 and
[1:15:58] beginning to read at verse 1
[1:16:02] what shall we say then that abraham our
[1:16:04] father as pertaining to the flesh hath
[1:16:07] found
[1:16:09] for if abraham were justified by works
[1:16:13] he had we're off to glory but not before
[1:16:16] god
[1:16:18] for what saith the scripture
[1:16:20] abraham believed god
[1:16:23] and it was counted unto him for
[1:16:26] righteousness
[1:16:28] amen
[1:16:29] now to him that worketh is the reward
[1:16:33] not reckoned of grace
[1:16:35] but of debt
[1:16:37] but to him that worketh not
[1:16:40] but believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:16:42] ungodly amen
[1:16:45] is faith is counted for righteousness
[1:16:49] amen
[1:16:50] praise the name of the lord
[1:16:53] so what does god see your righteousness
[1:16:56] amen
[1:16:58] well no
[1:16:59] i'm a sinner and so on yeah but you're
[1:17:02] saved by grace through faith
[1:17:04] amen so the righteousness he see in is
[1:17:07] faith
[1:17:08] your faith
[1:17:09] believe us thou this
[1:17:11] amen
[1:17:13] so again verse five to him that worketh
[1:17:15] not but believeth on him that justify at
[1:17:19] the ungodly
[1:17:21] his faith is counted for righteousness
[1:17:25] so how much of righteousness has god
[1:17:27] seen us today
[1:17:29] almost righteousness is god's seeing you
[1:17:30] today
[1:17:32] brother it's based on your faith
[1:17:35] he's looking for faith
[1:17:37] believe us thou this
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:41] verse 6 even as david also described the
[1:17:43] blessedness of the man unto whom god
[1:17:46] imputeth righteousness without works
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:51] but righteousness will produce works
[1:17:55] amen
[1:17:57] amen it's not the works producing
[1:17:58] righteousness it's the righteousness
[1:18:00] producing the works
[1:18:02] oh don't think well i just believe and i
[1:18:04] just go on because god god sees my faith
[1:18:07] and amen and he knows i believe yeah but
[1:18:11] if you believe you're going to go forth
[1:18:12] and it's going to be manifested in your
[1:18:14] life
[1:18:15] oh yeah it's going to reflect amen the
[1:18:17] word was made flesh
[1:18:19] to redeem us spiritually
[1:18:22] now the words make flesh redeeming us
[1:18:24] physically
[1:18:25] taking us from time to eternity taking
[1:18:27] us out of these bodies into glorified
[1:18:29] bodies amen by the grit to change us
[1:18:32] by the grace of god
[1:18:34] so again he said in verse six even as
[1:18:36] david also describeth the blessedness of
[1:18:38] the man unto whom god imputeth
[1:18:42] righteousness without works thank god
[1:18:45] amen through and it's through christ
[1:18:49] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:18:51] are forgiven
[1:18:53] and whose sins are covered
[1:18:56] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:18:59] not impute sin
[1:19:02] amazing
[1:19:03] this is amazing grace
[1:19:05] hallelujah
[1:19:06] and cometh this blessedness
[1:19:09] then upon the circumcision only or
[1:19:13] he said upon the uncircumcision also
[1:19:16] yes
[1:19:17] circumcision and on circumcision amen
[1:19:20] because it is by faith
[1:19:23] for we say that faith was reckoned to
[1:19:25] abraham for
[1:19:27] righteousness
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:30] it's not what i do here and do there
[1:19:32] it's what i'm believing
[1:19:33] amen and it's to stand that i'm taking
[1:19:36] for the truth the stand that i'm taking
[1:19:38] for the word of god amen
[1:19:41] so again verse 9 cometh this blessedness
[1:19:43] then upon the circumcision only or upon
[1:19:46] the uncircumcision also for we say that
[1:19:49] faith was reckoned to abraham for
[1:19:52] righteousness it was his faith
[1:19:55] how was it then reckoned when he was in
[1:19:57] circumcision or in uncircumcision not in
[1:20:00] circumcision but in uncircumcision amen
[1:20:04] because what god was looking for and
[1:20:06] what god saw in abraham was faith and
[1:20:08] what god is looking for in us is faith
[1:20:11] amen hallelujah that we believe god that
[1:20:15] we love the lord that we believe his
[1:20:17] word amen
[1:20:18] praise the lord
[1:20:19] brothers just let god see that faith in
[1:20:22] you of what god has done what god is
[1:20:25] doing and what god will do amen so does
[1:20:29] god see that in that faith in you that
[1:20:30] you believe it i believe god did this
[1:20:33] thank you lord i believe you're doing
[1:20:34] this thank you amen i believe you're
[1:20:36] going to do this thank you jesus amen
[1:20:39] brother this is the righteousness that
[1:20:41] god's looking for
[1:20:42] amen but brother there are those that
[1:20:44] believe yesterday

[1:30:25] thousands that believed it and honored
[1:30:27] wesley and there was more that believed
[1:30:29] it but the pentecostals all
[1:30:33] it also says you know what
[1:30:35] the power of the anointing was so so
[1:30:37] great when it comes to the pentecostal
[1:30:38] revival and the restoration of the gifts
[1:30:41] that it went around the world
[1:30:44] and it shocked the world
[1:30:47] that's the truth
[1:30:48] it went we went further than bennett and
[1:30:50] then luther went further than wesley
[1:30:52] went further than all the others amen
[1:30:54] but the pentecostal and the baptism of
[1:30:56] the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit
[1:30:58] amen oh it has such an influence and
[1:31:00] strike
[1:31:01] all around the world

[1:31:12] to keep you standing amen you can you
[1:31:14] can be seated amen
[1:31:22] see

[1:31:28] grace
[1:31:31] and he cometh and he said cometh this
[1:31:33] blessedness
[1:31:34] or rather verse 8 it says blessed is the
[1:31:36] man to whom the lord will not impute sin
[1:31:39] that's tremendous
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:44] it is it is the man with faith it is the
[1:31:48] man that believes what god has given him
[1:31:50] to believe in that day and in that hour
[1:31:52] amen so do we do we have the faith that
[1:31:56] god wants us to believe in this day and
[1:31:57] in this hour
[1:31:59] well is it going to be different from
[1:32:00] what from what this one had or that one
[1:32:02] at it's going to be what luther had plus
[1:32:05] what wesley had plus and what the
[1:32:06] pentecostal said plus amen unto light to
[1:32:10] the fullness of the word is revealed to
[1:32:12] give us the faith that we need to get
[1:32:14] out of time and into eternity amen
[1:32:17] because all down truth all down through
[1:32:18] the old testament there were there was
[1:32:21] by grace through faith
[1:32:22] abel offered unto god the more excellent
[1:32:24] sacrifice amen
[1:32:27] but again it went on and then by grace
[1:32:29] through faith god did this by grace
[1:32:31] through faith he did that to this one to
[1:32:33] job and and isaiah and jeremiah amen and
[1:32:37] on and into malachi amen and what did it
[1:32:40] produce it produced the
[1:32:43] the redeemer
[1:32:44] it brought jesus christ on the scene
[1:32:46] amen god was reflecting jesus and lee
[1:32:49] and abel god was reflecting in the in
[1:32:51] the prophets amen unto finally the word
[1:32:54] was made flesh in jesus amen to redeem
[1:32:57] us physically amen and then god came
[1:33:00] down in the baptism of the holy ghost on
[1:33:02] the day of pentecost and he began to
[1:33:04] reflect amen the revelation of jesus in
[1:33:07] the first age the second age all down to
[1:33:09] the to the last age amen until he would
[1:33:12] come for the resurrection and the
[1:33:14] rapture for the bright amen and again
[1:33:16] let me say it again to redeem us
[1:33:18] physically
[1:33:20] praise the name of the lord understand
[1:33:22] that i have been redeemed spiritually
[1:33:24] but now god has given us the revelation
[1:33:26] of redemption physical amen brother as
[1:33:29] he came down himself amen and flesh to
[1:33:32] reflect it he came down into himself in
[1:33:34] flesh to show redempt we well he didn't
[1:33:37] need to he didn't need spiritual
[1:33:38] redemption but he did it for you and me
[1:33:41] amen he laid down his life for you and
[1:33:44] may but then he picked it up again
[1:33:46] brother is not just oh yeah they all
[1:33:48] answer the old testament what did they
[1:33:50] do as abel did abel laid down his
[1:33:52] sacrifice a lamb
[1:33:54] and they laid down this and laid down
[1:33:55] this now we know brother abel had faith
[1:33:59] cain had wisdom
[1:34:02] oh yeah cain knew
[1:34:05] oh yeah they knew this they knew that
[1:34:07] and abel knew this and abel knew that
[1:34:09] and cain knew this and cain knew that
[1:34:10] amen but brother
[1:34:13] abel had faith
[1:34:16] and that's why that's why that that it
[1:34:18] produced the sacrifice
[1:34:21] amen of the lamb
[1:34:24] but
[1:34:26] cain never had that faith
[1:34:29] cain had wisdom again but he never had
[1:34:30] faith
[1:34:32] no
[1:34:33] so you you might have the wisdom of the
[1:34:35] word and you might have the wisdom to
[1:34:36] know this and to know that amen oya cain
[1:34:39] knew that god would require a sacrifice
[1:34:41] god they knew that god would require
[1:34:43] this oh he felt god should have this or
[1:34:45] should have that oh yeah because you
[1:34:47] know we we were we were this
[1:34:49] adam and eve was this and oh yeah and
[1:34:51] they sinned and now look where we are
[1:34:53] and so on so this is what cain was going
[1:34:55] to do and like i said he offered all
[1:34:57] these things
[1:34:59] but abel oh he just he just didn't agree
[1:35:01] with that he couldn't he couldn't he
[1:35:03] couldn't comprehend that at all
[1:35:05] amen now understand he knew that he knew
[1:35:08] that god required a sacrifice amen but
[1:35:11] he was going to give him what you know
[1:35:12] what he was growing in the field give
[1:35:14] him this and give him that and he didn't
[1:35:15] think that abel was doing right and
[1:35:18] going out to take a lamb and kill the
[1:35:20] lamb and let all the blood go air and
[1:35:22] there
[1:35:24] he went and killed abel
[1:35:26] yeah
[1:35:28] he wouldn't kill the lamb but he killed
[1:35:29] abel
[1:35:31] oh my brother sister god help us
[1:35:34] amen let's keep our attitude right in
[1:35:36] our spirit right
[1:35:38] amen toward one another
[1:35:41] but just just consider that and whether
[1:35:43] we could go on and administer that
[1:35:44] concerning the spirits they they came on
[1:35:46] cain and the spirit that was unable amen
[1:35:49] look look at the look of the results
[1:35:50] that they brought in cain's life and
[1:35:52] look at the results that they brought in
[1:35:54] abel's life so brother
[1:35:56] when it comes to the spirit that's in
[1:35:57] your life when it comes to the spirit
[1:35:58] that you have amen
[1:36:00] what what what's it producing in you
[1:36:03] look what it produced in cain look what
[1:36:05] it produced in abel amen
[1:36:08] look what it produced in the producing
[1:36:11] enlightened lot look what are producing
[1:36:13] this one and that one and in
[1:36:15] in adam
[1:36:16] amen
[1:36:17] noah
[1:36:18] yeah
[1:36:19] god help us
[1:36:21] brother it's good to have this and good
[1:36:23] to have that wisdom yeah but let it let
[1:36:25] it what about the faith is going to
[1:36:26] produce
[1:36:28] amen i know this and i know that amen oh
[1:36:30] yeah we think that's all we got to do is
[1:36:32] know it and just say acknowledge this
[1:36:34] and acknowledge that but let it produce
[1:36:36] faith
[1:36:38] yeah the word
[1:36:40] brother without faith it is impossible
[1:36:43] to please god

[1:36:47] and faith cometh by hearing
[1:36:50] and hearing the word amen sister
[1:36:53] that's right

[1:36:56] pleases god it's not just the idea that
[1:37:00] that i believe in god and i believe
[1:37:02] there is a god and i believe god did
[1:37:04] this and i believe god did that but
[1:37:05] what's god doing
[1:37:07] oh god's going to do this what's he
[1:37:09] doing

[1:37:14] this god did this god's going to pass
[1:37:16] and future but they could not recognize
[1:37:19] god in the present tense
[1:37:21] amen
[1:37:23] what is god doing
[1:37:26] cain oh yeah the past tense revelation
[1:37:28] and the future tense was there
[1:37:30] everything to be all right now and i'm
[1:37:31] going to offer this as a sacrifice to
[1:37:33] the lord amen but abel it was different
[1:37:37] yeah it was going to be a blood
[1:37:39] sacrifice
[1:37:41] and that blood sacrifice go on to
[1:37:42] another one and on to another one amen
[1:37:45] pointing to jesus
[1:37:47] oh yeah but cain didn't didn't see that
[1:37:49] cain didn't understand that
[1:37:51] brother what do we understand what do we
[1:37:53] see
[1:37:54] amen what did luther understand what did
[1:37:57] luther see amen i tell you what luther
[1:37:59] saw brother there was the third or
[1:38:02] fourth generation of the lutherans that
[1:38:03] didn't see it
[1:38:05] no
[1:38:07] no because if they did they would have
[1:38:08] went on with wesley
[1:38:10] amen
[1:38:11] unless he saw it
[1:38:12] amen as i said that as i explained to
[1:38:15] you that wesley got the revelation he
[1:38:17] got in a cottage meeting
[1:38:20] that's right when it comes to
[1:38:21] sanctification he got that because why
[1:38:24] he was in a he was in a uh
[1:38:27] lutheran cottage meeting
[1:38:29] the brothers were where the the brothers
[1:38:31] that were having the cottage mean they
[1:38:32] were lutherans

[1:38:36] believed what god revealed through
[1:38:37] luther amen concerning justification
[1:38:40] they were preaching it preaching and
[1:38:41] preaching and that's why that's why that
[1:38:43] john wesley amen that he got the

[1:39:34] what the prophet god said no he said i
[1:39:37] don't know

[1:40:04] anything about the salvation army
[1:40:06] and i said yes he did
[1:40:10] and i told him oh he said i didn't know
[1:40:12] that
[1:40:14] now that i said that the pentecost had
[1:40:16] organized or the the methodists are
[1:40:18] organized so quickly that god raised up
[1:40:20] william booth with red hot salvation
[1:40:23] he said to take them on to
[1:40:25] the pentecostal baptism of the holy
[1:40:28] ghost
[1:40:29] and the gifts of the spirit amen
[1:40:32] brother we've got to recognize what god

[1:40:35] we're gonna recognize what god did what
[1:40:37] god is doing amen by the grace of
[1:40:40] almighty god oh my brother and again
[1:40:43] there are saints that again in going
[1:40:44] through the messages there last night
[1:40:46] and i was saying omar this is amazing i
[1:40:49] said this was 1953 that the prophet of
[1:40:52] god was saying this and he was preaching
[1:40:53] this and saying this oh i said he's
[1:40:55] recognizing i said that he
[1:40:57] that he's he's maybe not exactly saying
[1:41:00] what he should say preaching what he
[1:41:01] should preach and he acknowledged that
[1:41:03] we said oh my ministry he said it is not
[1:41:05] what it should be
[1:41:07] oh i said what
[1:41:09] and he said oh yes no he said i should
[1:41:11] should do this i should do that i didn't
[1:41:12] do this i didn't do that
[1:41:14] yeah
[1:41:15] but then
[1:41:17] by the grace of god
[1:41:19] god started delayed on his on his on his
[1:41:21] heart
[1:41:23] what he needed to preach and what he
[1:41:24] needed to share with us the
[1:41:26] burden that he needed to give
[1:41:28] the revelation that we needed
[1:41:30] amazing oh yes and where where is where
[1:41:33] did you find that too right here in this
[1:41:35] in this book
[1:41:36] called hebrews
[1:41:38] huh
[1:41:39] it's there in this book
[1:41:41] that he explained oh yeah the change in
[1:41:44] his ministry that was coming
[1:41:47] by the grace of god
[1:41:48] amen he felt that he that he should
[1:41:50] should do this but he didn't do it
[1:41:53] he should have done that he didn't and
[1:41:55] it should have preached this and he
[1:41:56] didn't
[1:41:57] no because he didn't understand that he
[1:41:59] didn't catch that but eventually god
[1:42:00] began to reveal to him on into the
[1:42:03] opening of the word
[1:42:05] seven seals
[1:42:06] brother god help us amen wisdom good but
[1:42:10] what about faith
[1:42:12] what about faith
[1:42:15] wisdom is one thing
[1:42:17] i'll tell you this
[1:42:19] the one that highlights wisdom is the
[1:42:21] devil
[1:42:23] huh oh he does oh yeah the prophet of
[1:42:25] god said that's the devil but he said
[1:42:28] faith is god
[1:42:30] amen he said as it was in the garden of
[1:42:33] eden he highlighted that and he said go
[1:42:35] back to the garden of eden and he said
[1:42:36] god had given the word to give them the
[1:42:38] faith that they needed but is the devil
[1:42:40] come down he said what for he said to
[1:42:43] share wisdom
[1:42:45] oh yeah yes god said i know this and i
[1:42:48] know that you know this and you know
[1:42:50] that
[1:42:50] brother don't let the devil trick us
[1:42:52] into just putting the emphasis on the
[1:42:54] letter of the word
[1:42:56] we need the spiritual revelation of the
[1:42:58] word
[1:42:59] amen to know the motive and the
[1:43:02] objective that god had in saying what he
[1:43:04] said doing what he did amen revealing
[1:43:06] what he revealed amen brother it wasn't
[1:43:09] just to give us a knowledge oh i want
[1:43:11] you to know this i want you to know that
[1:43:13] he wants us to experience
[1:43:17] this
[1:43:18] he wants us to experience that not just
[1:43:20] to know it just too many got the
[1:43:22] knowledge of it too many god this
[1:43:23] revelation this idea in essentially an
[1:43:26] intellectual revelation amen oh yeah i
[1:43:29] know this and i know that yes but they
[1:43:31] don't have the spiritual revelation in
[1:43:33] their hearts
[1:43:34] so she's to recognize what god is doing
[1:43:38] in them
[1:43:39] you recognize what god is doing in the
[1:43:41] word amen brother sister you're in the
[1:43:43] message oh thank god again
[1:43:48] for it
[1:43:50] but the prophet said the message is not
[1:43:52] in you
[1:43:55] i already know that
[1:43:58] because all they were it was in their
[1:43:59] heads and they knew this and they could
[1:44:01] they could say that oh yeah the the
[1:44:03] bible says this is it this is it but
[1:44:05] brother brown was referring and putting
[1:44:07] the emphasis on the life that they were
[1:44:09] living
[1:44:11] amen brother are we not not becoming
[1:44:14] intellectual
[1:44:15] are we becoming more and more spiritual
[1:44:21] there's a lot of intellectual believers
[1:44:23] but i'm but there's very very few
[1:44:25] spiritual believers
[1:44:29] spiritual
[1:44:30] yeah
[1:44:32] they're not putting the emphasis brother
[1:44:33] on on on the just the letter of the word
[1:44:37] it's the spirit of the word that's
[1:44:38] influencing their everyday living
[1:44:40] let's see
[1:44:46] in the church in the in this series on
[1:44:48] the hebrews let me share with you uh
[1:44:54] he said oh brethren
[1:44:56] he said let me stop here for a minute
[1:44:58] he said no matter he said how much the
[1:45:00] word is preached he said how well you
[1:45:03] like the way it's been preached
[1:45:05] unless you yourself are a partaker of
[1:45:09] the word
[1:45:10] it won't do you one bit of good
[1:45:14] amen brother when the minute the
[1:45:17] ministry of the word you've got to
[1:45:18] partake of it

[1:47:08] she never had god in her heart
[1:47:10] amen
[1:47:12] brother
[1:47:13] let's let's let's go and let god have
[1:47:14] his way to stop this foolishness of the

[1:47:34] here for a minute no matter how much the
[1:47:35] word is preached how well you like the
[1:47:37] way it's been preached unless you
[1:47:39] yourself are a partaker of that word it
[1:47:41] won't do you one bit of good
[1:47:44] amen well it's like that sister eat
[1:47:47] full food loved it
[1:47:49] then throw it up

[1:47:52] spiritually
[1:47:54] oh
[1:47:55] i like this preach breaks breaks breaks
[1:47:58] yeah then they're going to throw it out
[1:48:01] when they go at the door they throw it
[1:48:02] up
[1:48:05] that's the truth
[1:48:07] i'll tell you this brother if they're
[1:48:09] digesting it in their souls amen as you
[1:48:12] digest natural food it becomes a part of
[1:48:13] your body
[1:48:15] amen
[1:48:16] you're going to your brother you're
[1:48:17] going to reflect it in in your everyday
[1:48:19] living

[1:48:31] come out and it's going to amen it's
[1:48:33] going to reflect
[1:48:34] in the life you live spiritually
[1:48:38] so again let me say are you religious or
[1:48:40] you're spiritual
[1:48:43] again let me highlight that i did show
[1:48:45] you the quotes where the prophet god
[1:48:46] said you are religious
[1:48:50] but he said you're not spiritual
[1:48:53] he said you are in the message but he
[1:48:55] said the message is not in you
[1:48:59] make your calling and election short
[1:49:02] make sure you're in the message is in
[1:49:04] you
[1:49:06] exactly
[1:49:07] amen
[1:49:09] because if the message is in you you'll
[1:49:11] leave himself out through you
[1:49:12] amen it's not through your head your
[1:49:15] your tongue and brother we got we got to
[1:49:18] live it not just talk it
[1:49:20] walk it not just talk it

[1:49:23] message but they're not they're not
[1:49:25] going to live the message they're not
[1:49:26] going to walk the message
[1:49:29] talk talk talk talk talk
[1:49:31] oh yeah
[1:49:32] to me it's like again like that sister
[1:49:34] oh she can talk the message oh believe
[1:49:36] the message thank god for the message
[1:49:37] and then go then go and eat a food
[1:49:40] meal and then go in and throw it up
[1:49:43] deliberately
[1:49:47] what was in control
[1:49:48] it wasn't god it was her pride
[1:49:51] amen
[1:49:54] pride was in control of your life
[1:49:56] is it god in control is it the word in
[1:49:58] control of your life is god governing

[1:50:04] care if even if it's your what you do in
[1:50:06] your home what you're doing in your
[1:50:08] fellowship what you're doing your job

[1:50:14] as i've said before even when i was
[1:50:16] working in in in the retail business
[1:50:18] for a number of years and even into even
[1:50:21] into management and oh yeah they knew
[1:50:24] they just knew
[1:50:26] they would only ask me to do certain
[1:50:27] things and or just to avoid this avoid
[1:50:30] that they said well we know that you
[1:50:31] know you don't you believe this and that
[1:50:33] so on
[1:50:34] i said yeah oh yeah they respected my
[1:50:36] faith
[1:50:39] and they wouldn't they wouldn't expect
[1:50:41] me to do this wouldn't expect me to do
[1:50:42] that and there was times when they
[1:50:44] wanted me to do this why didn't we do
[1:50:45] that and it was i remember an issue one
[1:50:47] time and i said listen i said i said no
[1:50:50] no i said if you want to do that you do
[1:50:52] it but i said i'm not going to do it
[1:50:56] and they said oh i understand
[1:50:59] you know what they wanted me to do
[1:51:01] they want me to lie to a customer
[1:51:05] to leave the wrong impression with a
[1:51:07] customer

[1:51:40] your family your friends your neighbors
[1:51:42] no matter who you're dealing with you

[1:51:49] just for the sake of this for a sake of
[1:51:50] that don't you do that
[1:51:53] but i tell you because god sees it as a
[1:51:55] spirit of unbelief
[1:51:58] oh yeah god will judge you for it
[1:52:02] amen
[1:52:03] so brother sister god help us to be
[1:52:05] partaker of the word
[1:52:07] let the word be in control
[1:52:10] brother amen what for he said he's
[1:52:13] encouraging here to make sure the wisdom
[1:52:15] you got is mixed with faith
[1:52:20] hebrews chapter 4
[1:52:22] amen
[1:52:24] he said unless you yourself are a
[1:52:26] partaker of the word
[1:52:28] it won't do you one bit of good
[1:52:32] you got to be a partaker of the word
[1:52:34] you got to eat the word you got to
[1:52:36] digest the word you got and if you
[1:52:38] digest it it's going to be in control
[1:52:41] yeah
[1:52:42] oh yeah your family knows it
[1:52:44] yeah
[1:52:45] as i said
[1:52:46] that that one time just one member of my
[1:52:49] family did challenge me on it but most
[1:52:51] of my family just they just respected it
[1:52:53] you know when as i said if they invited
[1:52:56] us to a certain gatherings birthday
[1:52:59] parties or whatever they they've called
[1:53:00] me and says

[1:53:04] would that affect your belief your faith
[1:53:07] we know that you believe this you
[1:53:08] believe that so we don't want to do
[1:53:10] anything that that would be contrary oh
[1:53:12] i said
[1:53:13] okay i said i respect you thank you oh
[1:53:16] yeah

[1:55:47] department's doors and so on just faith
[1:55:52] and uh thank god to god be the glory
[1:55:55] that i did here

[1:56:02] mr lush i don't know if you know this
[1:56:05] but he says
[1:56:06] there's a number of businesses in this
[1:56:08] area
[1:56:10] that have expressed
[1:56:12] their desire for you to work for them
[1:56:15] i said what me yes he said i've heard it
[1:56:18] he said i've talked to them and they
[1:56:20] they they said oh yeah but we we want
[1:56:22] him we would love him to come and manage

[1:56:58] up
[1:56:59] he promised it
[1:57:00] amen
[1:57:02] so brother
[1:57:04] the bible says that what this one did or
[1:57:06] that one did the gospel preached
[1:57:09] he said did not profit them not being
[1:57:11] mixed with faith
[1:57:14] he said in them that heard it
[1:57:17] brother so the gospel the message of the
[1:57:20] hour
[1:57:21] it may it can't prosper you if it's
[1:57:23] mixed with faith and you're receiving it
[1:57:25] into your heart into your soul thank you
[1:57:26] lord hallelujah and when you go out the
[1:57:28] word goes with you the words in control
[1:57:30] you can't get away from it amen the
[1:57:33] anointing amen no matter no matter what
[1:57:36] you do where you go and who you're going
[1:57:37] to meet you're going to you're going to
[1:57:39] reflect jesus
[1:57:41] you don't have to be talking about jesus
[1:57:43] but just that your spirit and your
[1:57:45] attitude is going to be christly
[1:57:48] oh yeah
[1:57:50] not that you're going to talk about
[1:57:51] christ not going to talk about the word
[1:57:54] it's just that your attitude and your
[1:57:55] spirit
[1:57:56] how you're going to act in in this
[1:57:58] situation are you going to react in that
[1:58:00] situation you're going to deal with this
[1:58:02] you're going to deal with that you're
[1:58:03] going to deal with it as a christian
[1:58:04] would
[1:58:08] they might might they might have to come
[1:58:09] and say what are you a christian
[1:58:13] so some have expressed that about other
[1:58:16] believers and say because they know by
[1:58:18] the way you act not what you're saying
[1:58:21] is what you're doing
[1:58:25] there are those that say it but they
[1:58:26] don't do it
[1:58:28] there are those who go and talk faith
[1:58:30] but they're really not going to live it
[1:58:33] and i'll tell you this
[1:58:35] do you know the unbelievers out there
[1:58:36] recognize that
[1:58:38] they do it's right brother they
[1:58:39] recognize it
[1:58:42] they know that you can talk it but you
[1:58:43] don't live it
[1:58:45] oh my god have mercy have mercy lord
[1:58:54] listen
[1:58:56] again
[1:58:58] he said the word preached did not profit
[1:59:00] them
[1:59:01] not being mixed with faith in them that
[1:59:04] hurt it
[1:59:05] whether they got the wisdom of the re of
[1:59:07] the letter of the word but they don't
[1:59:09] have the faith
[1:59:11] out of the heart they got it in their
[1:59:13] heads but not in their hearts
[1:59:15] if it's in their heads
[1:59:17] they love jesus
[1:59:19] oh yeah amen they respect jesus and and
[1:59:22] they don't want to offend jesus
[1:59:24] they don't want to offend his word they
[1:59:26] don't want to offend any of his children
[1:59:28] so you're going to go forth and just
[1:59:30] just
[1:59:31] live according to the leadership of the
[1:59:33] holy ghost
[1:59:36] but now don't think because i know
[1:59:37] there's a lot of believers think that
[1:59:38] they got to be talking the word they got
[1:59:40] to be you know talking about jesus talk
[1:59:42] about that no no
[1:59:46] you don't have to talk it
[1:59:47] walk it
[1:59:51] and you you're there you're in the
[1:59:53] spirit so that when if there's a time
[1:59:54] comes that god wants you to talk and
[1:59:56] you'll talk it
[1:59:58] but brother there's times when god don't
[2:00:00] want you to talk it he wants you to walk
[2:00:01] it
[2:00:03] amen because i tell you it's not what
[2:00:05] you're going to say it's going to
[2:00:06] influence that person it's the lady you
[2:00:08] live
[2:00:11] amen well yes they're gonna they're
[2:00:12] gonna recognize that
[2:00:15] now what you're saying is is what you do
[2:00:19] as i've said that we've had neighbors
[2:00:20] tell others oh
[2:00:22] that that
[2:00:23] couple there they're christian they're
[2:00:25] what oh yes they're christian
[2:00:29] but again i never told them
[2:00:32] that we were
[2:00:34] but they just knew the way we acted and
[2:00:35] so on and and when we put one of our
[2:00:38] houses one time we had there we put it
[2:00:40] off for sale and this uh one of the
[2:00:42] ladies that lived there
[2:00:44] her daughter wanted wanted to get a home
[2:00:46] in that area and she was appointed to
[2:00:48] her daughter she said oh right there lo
[2:00:50] she says good wonderful
[2:00:55] and she said
[2:00:57] he's a pastor
[2:00:59] pastor's wife lives there
[2:01:01] what
[2:01:03] a pastor
[2:01:04] yes she said pastor
[2:01:07] oh no no
[2:01:09] no no she said i'm not going to buy that
[2:01:11] house
[2:01:13] no why
[2:01:15] she said he's a pastor
[2:01:17] yes she says considering she said what i
[2:01:19] would do in that house she said i won't
[2:01:21] want to do it
[2:01:24] god bless her
[2:01:26] oh yes
[2:01:27] she said considering she said what i
[2:01:28] would do and what i would allow she said
[2:01:30] no no
[2:01:32] she wouldn't do it she wouldn't buy it
[2:01:35] amazing
[2:01:37] well god would respect her for that
[2:01:40] every attitude was right and her spirit
[2:01:41] was right because she
[2:01:43] she respected the ministry so she
[2:01:45] wouldn't go in there and and do this and
[2:01:47] do this and do that in that house
[2:01:50] so god be the glory amen bro
[2:01:53] that's right
[2:01:54] oh god help us to reflect jesus
[2:01:59] i tell you we weren't myself sister baby
[2:02:01] we didn't go around being religious and
[2:02:04] just showing off this and tell them
[2:02:05] about god tell them about the lord tell
[2:02:07] them about jesus no no we just live the
[2:02:10] life
[2:02:11] everyday living
[2:02:15] but they recognize the influence
[2:02:19] and they appreciated it
[2:02:22] so i said thank the lord
[2:02:24] and we'll give the glory to god
[2:02:28] amen
[2:02:30] listen
[2:02:31] again he said
[2:02:32] that the word preached did not profit
[2:02:34] them
[2:02:35] because it wasn't mixed with faith
[2:02:38] the word preached behind this pulpit
[2:02:40] amen whether it's your servant
[2:02:43] your pastor whether it's our brother
[2:02:45] jonathan or brother mark amen the word
[2:02:47] ministered
[2:02:49] won't profit you if it's not mixed with
[2:02:51] faith
[2:02:53] yeah
[2:02:55] we can get up and minister the word of
[2:02:57] god and you can say yeah
[2:02:59] sounds good
[2:03:00] in your head or in your heart
[2:03:04] you've got to be in your heart
[2:03:06] you've got to recognize it in your heart
[2:03:08] you've got to let it come in and feed
[2:03:09] your feed you on the inside of the
[2:03:10] inside
[2:03:12] amen amen amen praise the lord
[2:03:14] hallelujah
[2:03:16] oh yeah
[2:03:18] whether whether if i'm listening to
[2:03:19] brother mark or if i listen to brother
[2:03:21] jonathan minister
[2:03:23] i'm not here i'm not listening to it up
[2:03:25] here
[2:03:27] it doesn't stay here
[2:03:28] it just goes on down
[2:03:31] into the heart
[2:03:34] the prophet god said that that's where
[2:03:35] you got to receive the words in your
[2:03:36] heart
[2:03:38] but there's a lot of people just getting
[2:03:39] it up here
[2:03:41] oh yeah they come in get the word go out
[2:03:43] and leave it behind
[2:03:44] they leave the word behind
[2:03:47] yeah but as others they come in receive
[2:03:49] the word take it with them
[2:03:52] amen and brother hallelujah and they're
[2:03:55] not outside but they'll the word of the
[2:03:57] holy ghost should bring the word to

[2:04:22] brother i thank god for the for the
[2:04:24] education that i had and where where i
[2:04:26] was educated in that in that
[2:04:28] school that i was in

[2:04:49] but again
[2:04:50] they knew eventually that it was it was
[2:04:52] my christian
[2:04:54] and as i said even one teacher
[2:04:59] that came up to me
[2:05:02] and he said
[2:05:05] and that teacher he always referred to
[2:05:06] all of his students as mr and miss

[2:05:18] that's in his ass oh yes he said you're
[2:05:20] going to be a pastor
[2:05:23] and he wanted to know where i was going
[2:05:24] to take it to take my training
[2:05:27] he said are you going to would you go to
[2:05:30] memorial university
[2:05:32] for training i said i said no brother
[2:05:34] i'll leave that with the lord
[2:05:36] i said that's in god's hands not mine
[2:05:39] oh yes he said okay and i remember years
[2:05:42] ago several years later many years later
[2:05:45] that i was in in the avalon mall there
[2:05:47] and i and this this man came over and
[2:05:49] greeted me
[2:05:51] that teacher
[2:05:54] he was he was much older than

[2:05:57] i didn't know him
[2:05:59] oh yeah he was right there again
[2:06:01] spiritual
[2:06:03] god bless you
[2:06:05] and he and he when i told him about the
[2:06:06] church i always said i knew that i knew
[2:06:08] he'd be a pastor i said you did oh yes
[2:06:11] yeah
[2:06:13] and i remember one time he was having he
[2:06:15] had that that
[2:06:16] that teacher he also had a bible class
[2:06:19] back in school then they don't have it
[2:06:20] now but then they had a religious class
[2:06:24] and just uh teaching this and teaching
[2:06:26] that
[2:06:27] well most most uh
[2:06:29] schools did have it and he and i
[2:06:31] remember one one day i came in a bit
[2:06:34] late
[2:06:34] i was late
[2:06:37] and uh
[2:06:39] and
[2:06:40] when i he was already going through his
[2:06:43] already into his class and the religious
[2:06:46] class and when i got in and sat down he
[2:06:48] said oh he said mr lush he said welcome

[2:07:03] yeah
[2:07:05] yeah
[2:07:05] and i did express to him what i felt
[2:07:08] because he certainly his church believed
[2:07:11] a certain thing and taught a certain
[2:07:12] thing
[2:07:13] and i said well i said a scripture says
[2:07:14] this
[2:07:17] oh
[2:07:19] he said i never heard that before he was
[2:07:21] shocked he said thank you
[2:07:25] thank you
[2:07:26] now he said i didn't understand
[2:07:28] i said okay
[2:07:31] amen
[2:07:32] now he's his wife he didn't
[2:07:34] go along with what i was saying but he
[2:07:36] did
[2:07:38] praise the lord
[2:07:40] brother
[2:07:42] i pray grace that what you believe
[2:07:43] you've got it mixed with faith
[2:07:48] spiritual
[2:07:49] revelation
[2:07:50] not just intellectual knowledge
[2:07:52] spiritual revelation in the heart
[2:07:55] it's not what you believe here it's what
[2:07:56] you believe here
[2:07:58] because what you believe here is to
[2:08:00] control what you believe here
[2:08:02] amen the anointing comes out of the
[2:08:04] heart into your spirit
[2:08:06] into your mind praise the lord but
[2:08:09] there's many they have the anointing in
[2:08:11] their heads and in their minds but not
[2:08:13] in their heart
[2:08:15] no
[2:08:16] you can have the anointing in your in
[2:08:17] your head you can have the anointing in
[2:08:19] your spirit but not in your soul
[2:08:23] the prophet of god warned us
[2:08:25] of that
[2:08:26] he said make it make sure he starts in
[2:08:28] the heart
[2:08:30] thy word have i hid in my heart
[2:08:34] that i might not sin against thee
[2:08:37] grace
[2:08:39] amen the word in the heart in control
[2:08:43] by the grace of god not in the head
[2:08:45] because in the head or you can just
[2:08:47] bypass it
[2:08:48] no no grace
[2:08:54] brother make sure the word is mixed with
[2:08:56] faith
[2:08:57] in the heart
[2:08:59] not just knowledge in your head
[2:09:02] listen
[2:09:04] not being mixed with faith
[2:09:06] it didn't work
[2:09:08] he said they sing the miracles of moses
[2:09:11] he said that's pretty good
[2:09:12] he said they walked over they've seen
[2:09:15] seen him perform miracles and they seen
[2:09:17] the pillar of fire
[2:09:19] and he said heard them talk about it
[2:09:22] but he said it wasn't mixed with
[2:09:24] personal faith
[2:09:25] it didn't
[2:09:26] have the influence
[2:09:28] that god wanted to have in their lives
[2:09:32] as soon as they got to the wilderness he
[2:09:35] said they began to murmur
[2:09:37] and complain
[2:09:39] and god said because they doubted it was
[2:09:42] sin
[2:09:44] don't doubt nothing he said believe
[2:09:48] don't doubt no matter how hard the case
[2:09:50] is believe it
[2:09:53] but they begin to murmur and god
[2:09:55] overthrow them in the wilderness
[2:09:58] amen
[2:10:00] but with whom was he grieved the bible
[2:10:02] says for forty years
[2:10:04] was it not with them that sin
[2:10:07] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[2:10:10] amen
[2:10:12] brother there are those that come out
[2:10:13] under the revealed word
[2:10:15] die under it
[2:10:17] but not saved
[2:10:24] yeah
[2:10:26] i've experienced much of that over the
[2:10:28] years
[2:10:30] many a so-called professing believer
[2:10:31] died but
[2:10:33] i don't think they went to heaven
[2:10:35] what was the problem
[2:10:37] it was their spirit
[2:10:39] it was their attitude
[2:10:42] maybe their reaction
[2:10:46] yeah
[2:10:47] it was contrary to the word
[2:10:49] contrary to the message of the hour
[2:10:52] brothers make sure your spirit is right
[2:10:55] make sure your attitude is right
[2:10:59] do you have the
[2:11:00] spirit of jesus do you have the attitude
[2:11:02] of jesus
[2:11:06] would they think that you were jesus how
[2:11:08] close would you how close would you be
[2:11:10] in your character
[2:11:11] like jesus
[2:11:18] brother
[2:11:19] sisters if we believe in the
[2:11:20] resurrection
[2:11:22] and we're believing in the rapture
[2:11:24] we're going to have the spirit and the
[2:11:26] attitude and the character of jesus
[2:11:29] it took that spirit that attitude that
[2:11:31] character to lay down his life and to
[2:11:34] pick it up again
[2:11:36] and lord is going to take that spirit
[2:11:37] and that attitude and that anointing
[2:11:40] for the right for the for the rapture
[2:11:43] it took that takes that spirit to change
[2:11:45] us spiritually and that's going to take
[2:11:46] the same thing to change us physically
[2:11:49] he came down 2 000 years ago
[2:11:52] and was made flesh
[2:11:55] oh yeah
[2:11:56] and the word was made flesh and dwell
[2:11:57] among us and the word did this the word
[2:11:59] did that discerning the thoughts and
[2:12:00] intents of the heart and the word came
[2:12:02] down was made flesh in the bride and he
[2:12:04] did this did this did this
[2:12:06] yeah
[2:12:08] just think of the ministry that was
[2:12:10] revealed in the prophet it wasn't
[2:12:12] william branham
[2:12:14] it was jesus
[2:12:16] no he didn't do that through all roberts
[2:12:18] he didn't do that through the other
[2:12:19] evangelists the signs and the wonders of
[2:12:21] miracles under pentecost oh no
[2:12:23] this was the calling of the bride in the
[2:12:25] bright age
[2:12:27] and it was jesus that had come down to
[2:12:28] receive us unto himself to redeem us
[2:12:31] physically
[2:12:33] he came down
[2:12:34] and redeemed us spiritually and he came
[2:12:36] in us amen bringing us all onto the
[2:12:39] resurrection rapture
[2:12:41] for the redemption physical
[2:12:44] into glorified bodies
[2:12:48] amen
[2:12:49] but the problem of god got up and as
[2:12:51] i've said he come to the pulpit and many
[2:12:53] times and he would say now he said this
[2:12:55] is not me
[2:12:57] it's not no he said i can't do this
[2:13:01] and he couldn't
[2:13:03] he said this is jesus
[2:13:06] that's right
[2:13:07] it wasn't like oral roberts or or the
[2:13:09] other evangelist and they would get the
[2:13:11] sick and they would pray for the sick
[2:13:12] and sometimes they'd only be there to
[2:13:14] give a prophecy or whatever for that
[2:13:16] person but here come a prophet
[2:13:18] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[2:13:20] the heart amen past present future amen
[2:13:23] declaring healing oh yeah signs wonders
[2:13:26] and miracles
[2:13:27] but
[2:13:28] it wasn't like an evangelist
[2:13:30] it wasn't like he needed the five full
[2:13:32] ministry
[2:13:33] no no it was beyond the fivefold
[2:13:36] ministry
[2:13:37] it was jesus
[2:13:39] because he the problem god kept
[2:13:41] repeating and kept highlighting to us
[2:13:43] this is not me said i can't do this
[2:13:47] he said i got to get out of the way so
[2:13:48] he can do it
[2:13:51] brother get out of the way so he can he
[2:13:53] can live the life that he wants to live
[2:13:55] in you
[2:13:56] get out of the way yeah so he can be the
[2:13:59] witness that he wants to be in you
[2:14:00] reflect jesus
[2:14:02] not religion
[2:14:04] you're not going to just reflect the
[2:14:05] church reflect jesus
[2:14:08] amen
[2:14:09] by the grace of god
[2:14:12] listen
[2:14:14] the problem is he said it is not mixed
[2:14:16] with personal faith
[2:14:18] for as soon as they got to the
[2:14:20] wilderness and they begin to murmur and
[2:14:22] it says they doubted he said it was sin
[2:14:25] don't doubt nothing please let's not
[2:14:28] doubt what god has done don't doubt what
[2:14:30] god's doing
[2:14:32] oh well god sent a prophet yes but there
[2:14:35] was more to it than that there was the
[2:14:36] opening of the word there was a
[2:14:37] revelation of the mystery of god in
[2:14:39] these in these last days the revelation
[2:14:41] of our lord jesus christ
[2:14:43] for the res for the for the resurrection
[2:14:46] and the rapture by the grace of god
[2:14:49] brothers
[2:14:51] is he giving us the faith for the
[2:14:53] rapture
[2:14:55] what are we putting the emphasis on what
[2:14:57] are we really believing for what are we
[2:14:59] really looking for
[2:15:05] i trust by grace we're looking for the
[2:15:06] rapture
[2:15:08] we're looking we're expecting the change
[2:15:10] physically
[2:15:12] brother make make your calling election
[2:15:14] short make sure you've got to change
[2:15:15] spiritually
[2:15:18] amen
[2:15:19] oh yeah make sure you change your change
[2:15:21] from the inside
[2:15:22] because if you're if you're not changed
[2:15:24] from the inside you won't be changed
[2:15:25] outside
[2:15:27] we're going to be changed from the
[2:15:28] inside out
[2:15:30] it's god working from the inside out
[2:15:34] praise the lord see he's working in your
[2:15:37] heart in your soul in your spirit and
[2:15:39] through your mind to bring this to bring
[2:15:41] the flesh subject to the word
[2:15:43] whether it's justification
[2:15:44] sanctification wesley the pentecost
[2:15:47] gifts of the spirit and the baptism of
[2:15:49] the holy ghost brother until finally
[2:15:51] he's taken absolute control
[2:15:54] of the body
[2:15:56] to change it from time to eternity
[2:16:01] oh
[2:16:02] luther was was justified praise the lord
[2:16:06] and he went and then he preached and he
[2:16:07] preached and he preached
[2:16:09] the the lutheran the methodists were
[2:16:11] sanctified and they preached and
[2:16:13] preached and preached
[2:16:14] but they weren't looking up
[2:16:17] as i said they were looking they were
[2:16:19] just going here going there
[2:16:22] yeah
[2:16:25] the salvation army and the pentecostals
[2:16:27] oh they went and they preached and
[2:16:29] preached and preached oh my oh my
[2:16:32] what revivals they had but i'll tell you
[2:16:34] this
[2:16:36] the bride revival now
[2:16:38] is not moving here moving here doing
[2:16:40] this doing that now look up
[2:16:44] all the others they just moved on
[2:16:46] moved on moved on do this do this preach
[2:16:49] it here preach it there
[2:16:51] but the ro there rises a generation
[2:16:53] hallelujah and god gives the revelation
[2:16:56] to look up
[2:16:59] because redemption is at hand
[2:17:02] it is finished
[2:17:06] if we were if we were living back in the
[2:17:08] pentecostal age we'd be we wouldn't be
[2:17:10] looking up we'd be just going here going
[2:17:12] here preaching this preaching oh come on
[2:17:14] come on this is what god has done this
[2:17:15] is what god has done now we want to
[2:17:17] preach this is what god's doing look up
[2:17:20] you've got to look up
[2:17:23] if you want the rapture you want to be
[2:17:25] changed you've got to look up
[2:17:27] because our faith is not in here here
[2:17:29] here our faith is here
[2:17:32] come on
[2:17:34] lord i feel the pull
[2:17:36] by grace
[2:17:38] amen
[2:17:41] he said please
[2:17:42] don't doubt nothing
[2:17:45] believe
[2:17:46] don't doubt no matter how hard it the
[2:17:48] case is believe it
[2:17:50] amen
[2:17:53] but again it says with whom was he
[2:17:54] grieved forty years
[2:17:56] and he said was it not with them that
[2:17:58] had sinned doubted
[2:18:00] whose carcasses fell in the wilderness
[2:18:04] and all of them that came out of egypt
[2:18:06] only two went into the promised land
[2:18:10] of the original
[2:18:13] generations that came out of egypt two
[2:18:15] went to the promised land
[2:18:18] he said listen
[2:18:20] out of the whole antediluvian world in
[2:18:23] the days gone by there were eight souls
[2:18:25] saved out of billions
[2:18:27] straight is the gate and narrow is the
[2:18:29] way but few there be that find it that's
[2:18:32] the truth
[2:18:35] he says some people say brother branham
[2:18:38] what about all these thousands that the
[2:18:40] bible said will appear
[2:18:42] just remember how many has died in each
[2:18:45] generation
[2:18:46] that's been christians down through the
[2:18:48] ages he said they'll all resurrect
[2:18:52] that makes up the body
[2:18:54] he said you expect there be hundred a
[2:18:57] hundred billion in this america come out
[2:19:01] he said of this world
[2:19:02] they said no he said there might be 50
[2:19:06] come out
[2:19:09] of america
[2:19:10] 50.
[2:19:16] grace
[2:19:17] i'll tell you as time goes on it's going
[2:19:19] to be less and less and less
[2:19:24] it's going to get fewer and fewer and
[2:19:26] fewer
[2:19:28] because it becomes more and more
[2:19:29] religious to them but not spiritual
[2:19:33] brother
[2:19:36] we got the wisdom god give us the faith
[2:19:40] we got the knowledge
[2:19:42] but do we have the faith
[2:19:45] oh yeah
[2:19:46] you can have the knowledge of what god's
[2:19:48] done
[2:19:49] the knowledge of what god's doing but do
[2:19:50] we have the faith to look up
[2:19:55] amen god did this god did that god is
[2:19:58] doing this god's doing that
[2:20:00] so what what effect should it have on
[2:20:02] you
[2:20:03] and on on me well it should bring us to
[2:20:06] the place
[2:20:07] bring us to the to the revelation that
[2:20:08] it's over it's finished now lord but
[2:20:10] look for the rapture
[2:20:12] every day
[2:20:13] looking for the
[2:20:14] rapture every day looking for the change
[2:20:17] of our bodies
[2:20:20] remember don't leave it with god he left
[2:20:22] it with us
[2:20:25] god came down and give the word
[2:20:27] now it was up to able to able to go and
[2:20:30] fulfill the work
[2:20:33] up to able to go and do what god
[2:20:35] revealed to him
[2:20:37] amen
[2:20:38] brother now it's up to us to go and do
[2:20:40] what god has revealed to us
[2:20:42] how how does it control you
[2:20:46] does it influence you
[2:20:48] god help us
[2:20:51] let me say again he said you expect that
[2:20:53] there be a hundred billion in this
[2:20:56] america he said
[2:20:59] in this world today but he said there
[2:21:01] might not be 50 come out
[2:21:05] grace
[2:21:06] in the name of jesus grace to us
[2:21:10] brother
[2:21:11] that's in the hebrew series
[2:21:15] maybe in the 1950s i believe it was so
[2:21:18] god help us brother
[2:21:20] that in this hour
[2:21:22] god
[2:21:24] has given us wisdom
[2:21:26] to give us the faith we need
[2:21:29] for
[2:21:31] the resurrection and rapture
[2:21:34] brother it's not just a focus on what
[2:21:36] they've done in previous ages it's the
[2:21:39] focus on what god is doing
[2:21:42] amen there's still too many that are
[2:21:45] focusing on what god did
[2:21:47] yeah well pentecost
[2:21:48] yes or focus on what god did
[2:21:51] in in in the ministry of a prophet
[2:21:53] malachi 4 the first poll the second poll
[2:21:56] but what about the third poll
[2:22:01] the third poll
[2:22:03] is rapturing faith
[2:22:06] it is
[2:22:07] yeah go read the
[2:22:09] go read or listen to the message that he
[2:22:11] preached on the rapture
[2:22:13] 1965.
[2:22:18] the third pull is rapturing faith
[2:22:21] so he said he left it
[2:22:24] yeah
[2:22:26] and not long after that god called him
[2:22:27] home
[2:22:29] why because he got to the place where he
[2:22:31] knew the first pull was done the second
[2:22:33] pull was done the third pull was was
[2:22:35] done now he said here i do here i go he
[2:22:38] said back into evangelism
[2:22:42] why
[2:22:43] because
[2:22:45] he had he administered the word of god
[2:22:48] when it comes to the first poll in his
[2:22:49] ministry and the signs and the wonders
[2:22:51] signed his and the discernment of the
[2:22:53] thoughts and intents of the heart past
[2:22:55] present and future and then the opening
[2:22:57] of the word
[2:22:58] amen
[2:22:59] so it was all done it was all finished
[2:23:01] the third poll was over
[2:23:03] for him
[2:23:04] amen but not for the bride
[2:23:07] that's why after it was all done all
[2:23:09] over with in 1965 he said here i go he
[2:23:12] said back into evangelism
[2:23:14] yeah and god took him home
[2:23:17] why because now the emphasis was on the
[2:23:20] word and the calling of the bride
[2:23:25] grace
[2:23:27] brother
[2:23:30] we have the wisdom of god but grace to
[2:23:32] give us the faith that god
[2:23:35] is looking for
[2:23:37] brother wisdom versus faith
[2:23:41] grace grace grace
[2:23:45] he said
[2:23:46] when he preached this sermon
[2:23:48] on wisdom versus faith
[2:23:54] you see
[2:23:57] he said
[2:23:58] what is the wisdom we're talking about
[2:24:01] he says something that will not agree
[2:24:06] that all this word is the truth
[2:24:09] it is something that will take away from
[2:24:11] the truth expressing itself as a higher
[2:24:14] knowledge
[2:24:15] more wisdom
[2:24:18] no
[2:24:22] he said and if wisdom of that sort come
[2:24:24] from satan is children lived by that
[2:24:27] wisdom
[2:24:31] and he said if the wisdom of that sort
[2:24:34] and he said if the faith of god
[2:24:36] came through god
[2:24:38] and he said god's children lives on
[2:24:40] faith the bible said the just lived by
[2:24:44] wisdom
[2:24:46] and they said the congregation said no
[2:24:49] he said the just lived by faith
[2:24:53] amen not what we can learn but what
[2:24:57] we can believe
[2:24:59] amen
[2:25:02] he said let's take wisdom first wisdom
[2:25:05] has reasoning
[2:25:07] but faith has no reasoning
[2:25:10] wisdom has
[2:25:12] reasonings
[2:25:14] now he said what are we doing trying to
[2:25:16] do this morning follow what the lord
[2:25:18] said lay out food you're going to need
[2:25:21] it one of these days lay up food and
[2:25:24] this is where he come to preach this
[2:25:25] wisdom versus faith he said the lord
[2:25:27] told me to lay out food it's because
[2:25:29] you're going to need it
[2:25:31] and we do
[2:25:33] after all those years we need it
[2:25:35] to know what god has done yes to know
[2:25:38] what god is doing
[2:25:40] we need to know
[2:25:43] and to know what god will do
[2:25:47] there's too many that are still focusing
[2:25:49] on what god did
[2:25:51] oh god sent a prophet god's not a
[2:25:52] prophet yeah what was he doing
[2:25:55] the prophet's gone
[2:25:57] what's he doing now
[2:25:58] oh well he sent the prophet revealed the
[2:26:00] word what are you doing with the word
[2:26:03] now we got to get into the word and
[2:26:06] getting into the word will give us the
[2:26:07] faith for the rapture
[2:26:10] grace to us
[2:26:14] he said what are we trying to do this
[2:26:16] morning
[2:26:18] follow what the lord said lay up food
[2:26:21] by grace
[2:26:23] amen to god be the glory
[2:26:25] listen
[2:26:31] he said the bible says
[2:26:37] the serpent said unto the woman ye shall
[2:26:39] not surely die
[2:26:42] what was satan doing he was reasoning
[2:26:44] with eve and he was getting need to
[2:26:46] reason
[2:26:48] with the word
[2:26:49] and there's many trying to reason with
[2:26:51] the message
[2:26:53] no
[2:26:56] he said
[2:26:57] reason he said god is too good god's too
[2:27:01] merciful he loves you too much and you
[2:27:03] hear that same old devil today
[2:27:06] he said god's too good to do this god
[2:27:08] won't do this god won't punish he said
[2:27:10] he'll do just exactly what his word said
[2:27:13] he will do
[2:27:14] believe it
[2:27:17] he says you shall not surely die that's
[2:27:19] what he said to eve
[2:27:21] see what she's trying to do
[2:27:23] he's trying to get her to reason with
[2:27:25] him
[2:27:26] in a minute that you reason on god's
[2:27:29] word then you're losing faith
[2:27:32] he said don't have no
[2:27:34] yes knows maybe
[2:27:37] he says stay right with it
[2:27:40] he said eve had the right approach but
[2:27:42] she listened to his reasoning
[2:27:45] so he said there's just so many people
[2:27:46] today he said that has the right to
[2:27:49] knowledge
[2:27:50] he said that knows that this word should
[2:27:52] be god's word and it is god's word but
[2:27:55] they stand and let some seminary student
[2:27:58] he said reason them out
[2:28:00] he said reasonings
[2:28:02] he said we're cast
[2:28:04] we're to cast down reasoning
[2:28:07] amen
[2:28:12] now he said what's
[2:28:14] started these things he said in the
[2:28:16] garden
[2:28:17] he said it was reasoning
[2:28:19] the enemy the devil getting eve to
[2:28:22] reason
[2:28:23] he said faith has no reason he said you
[2:28:26] don't reason at all but faith you
[2:28:29] believe
[2:28:30] you leave it with the lord
[2:28:33] amen
[2:28:35] everything that can be presented
[2:28:36] contrary satan will do it and he'll try
[2:28:39] to reason
[2:28:40] you
[2:28:42] can't do it
[2:28:46] you leave it with god
[2:28:49] he said don't reason he said believe no
[2:28:51] matter what the circumstances don't pay
[2:28:53] no attention to circumstances believe
[2:28:56] stay with the word
[2:28:59] amen
[2:29:03] but eve
[2:29:04] she responded to the devil she said oh
[2:29:07] she said we'll die
[2:29:09] and he says surely god won't do that
[2:29:12] but he knows what you'll be
[2:29:14] wise to
[2:29:15] putting his wisdom against god's word he
[2:29:18] said there's the wisdom i'm talking
[2:29:19] about he's a wisdom against faith
[2:29:23] he said there's the battle the first
[2:29:25] battle
[2:29:26] and god's word
[2:29:27] held steady and true when they partook
[2:29:31] of the forbidden
[2:29:32] they died
[2:29:34] brother
[2:29:35] don't reason
[2:29:37] just believe the word
[2:29:39] amen
[2:29:46] he said what does wisdom do
[2:29:49] wisdom
[2:29:50] oh he said
[2:29:52] now you know
[2:29:53] we couldn't do that in this time we must
[2:29:55] do it anyhow
[2:29:57] he said tries to
[2:29:58] wisdom is trying to find an easier way
[2:30:02] amen it tries to make the bible say
[2:30:04] things that it does not say
[2:30:07] oh yeah
[2:30:11] wisdom the better way
[2:30:13] the modern
[2:30:14] way
[2:30:16] an easier way
[2:30:17] stay with the word
[2:30:20] he said wait just a moment
[2:30:23] he said what was it the devil tried to
[2:30:25] do with wisdom
[2:30:27] make god's word say something that it
[2:30:29] didn't say
[2:30:31] and he said so that's the way it comes
[2:30:33] today
[2:30:34] amen
[2:30:36] when brother don't reason
[2:30:38] there are those that take the message of
[2:30:40] the hour they're still taking the word
[2:30:42] of god and reasoning
[2:30:44] to justify
[2:30:48] what they want to do
[2:30:51] you got to follow god's leadership
[2:30:54] stay with the word
[2:30:57] he said when they try to make god's word
[2:30:59] say something that it doesn't say well
[2:31:01] i'll tell you brother branham you ain't
[2:31:03] got the right interpretation
[2:31:06] the bible said the prophecy is of no
[2:31:08] private interpretation he said why ain't
[2:31:11] it of private interpretation because the
[2:31:14] word of the lord came to the prophets
[2:31:17] it is interpreted by the prophet
[2:31:21] not a private interpretation no
[2:31:24] the prophets already interpreted to you
[2:31:27] and he said there it is
[2:31:28] written right there that's the way it's
[2:31:31] supposed to be
[2:31:33] amen
[2:31:34] god's way
[2:31:37] amen praise the lord
[2:31:41] he said god's thoughts is as eternal as
[2:31:43] god amen and he said that ain't skim
[2:31:46] milk brother
[2:31:48] and he said this sauce is what he was
[2:31:50] that's you too
[2:31:52] and he said what's your thoughts
[2:31:54] he said our is what you are
[2:31:57] no matter what you try to live by
[2:31:59] something else your thoughts is what you
[2:32:02] are and he said you might go along and
[2:32:04] act like a nice fellow but in your heart
[2:32:07] you are an adulteress
[2:32:08] or whatever it is that's what you are
[2:32:11] your thoughts
[2:32:12] amen and god's thoughts was his word and
[2:32:15] that was him in him and it was god so
[2:32:19] brother the enemy is there to control
[2:32:21] our thoughts
[2:32:22] but let god control your thoughts
[2:32:25] let god keep your thoughts and
[2:32:27] in line with his word let god keep your
[2:32:29] thoughts under the control of his word
[2:32:31] amen let the holy ghost
[2:32:33] control your thoughts
[2:32:35] by the grace of god amen
[2:32:39] so lord help us is my prayer
[2:32:43] and again there's many other thoughts
[2:32:44] concerning wisdom
[2:32:46] versus faith
[2:32:48] god help us
[2:32:49] to stay with faith
[2:32:55] if it's the holy ghost wisdom don't let
[2:32:57] the devil pervert it
[2:32:58] if it's the holy ghost wisdom don't let
[2:33:00] the devil add to it
[2:33:03] if it's the holy ghost wisdom don't let
[2:33:04] the devil take away from it
[2:33:06] he's there to add a word or take a word
[2:33:09] amen god help us
[2:33:12] don't reason believe
[2:33:16] he said look at cain and abel
[2:33:20] he said abel was going by faith but cain
[2:33:23] wisdom
[2:33:25] he said like his mother he took
[2:33:26] reasoning
[2:33:28] wisdom his own wisdom a beautiful
[2:33:30] sacrifice he had the flowers he had the
[2:33:33] fruit of the field
[2:33:35] and said surely god will receive my
[2:33:37] sacrifice
[2:33:38] i built a lovely altar i have it so
[2:33:41] pretty it's so decorated just like this
[2:33:44] easter will be and he said they'll spend
[2:33:46] he said millions of dollars across the
[2:33:48] nation to put easter flowers on some
[2:33:50] altars
[2:33:52] he said the altar wasn't made for
[2:33:54] flowers
[2:33:55] he said it's for sacrifice
[2:33:57] he said you just show the same old
[2:33:59] spirit of cain
[2:34:00] and he said it's the same old devil from
[2:34:02] eden
[2:34:03] oh yeah because there's under under the
[2:34:06] this easter and even thanksgiving days
[2:34:09] and so on they're going to
[2:34:11] fill the altar with beautiful things
[2:34:14] kill the altar with food and this and
[2:34:16] that and something else brother put
[2:34:18] yourself on the altar
[2:34:19] amen
[2:34:21] that's what god wants
[2:34:23] you
[2:34:25] it's not what oh you can do this you can
[2:34:27] do oh this is nice lord thank you
[2:34:29] all the vegetables you're going to grow
[2:34:30] all this you're going to get all you're
[2:34:32] going to do
[2:34:33] it might be close
[2:34:34] whatever
[2:34:36] no put yourself on the elder
[2:34:38] god wants you
[2:34:42] so he can use you
[2:34:44] amen it's not using the vegetables he's
[2:34:46] not using the clothes he's not using
[2:34:48] that he's using you
[2:34:50] your life
[2:34:51] amen
[2:34:54] i'll finish with this
[2:35:00] praise the lord
[2:35:01] he said surely god will receive my
[2:35:03] sacrifice i built a lovely altar i have
[2:35:06] it so pretty it is so decorated and
[2:35:09] again he said just like easter will be
[2:35:11] and they'll spend millions of dollars
[2:35:13] across the nation to put easter flowers
[2:35:15] on some altars and the altar wasn't made
[2:35:18] for flowers
[2:35:19] he said no he said you just show that
[2:35:21] same old spirit of cain he said that
[2:35:24] same old devil from eden he said you
[2:35:26] know that the man was sincere
[2:35:29] because it meant life or death to him
[2:35:31] and then them people
[2:35:33] don't think they're hypocrites they're
[2:35:35] sincere
[2:35:39] he said listen
[2:35:41] that don't do it
[2:35:42] it's truth not sincerity
[2:35:47] you can be sincerely wrong
[2:35:50] yeah
[2:35:51] so what about the truth
[2:35:53] is it truth governing you today is the
[2:35:55] truth controlling you today is it
[2:35:57] because of the truth that you're here
[2:35:58] today
[2:36:01] yeah well there's
[2:36:04] there's still others that would come
[2:36:06] here they would come to church
[2:36:09] one time we had to deal with that
[2:36:12] and i remember
[2:36:14] there was a gentleman used to go to
[2:36:15] church here one time
[2:36:17] he doesn't go to any church now of
[2:36:18] course
[2:36:20] and
[2:36:22] when he went to the mainland he met
[2:36:23] believers from here and he's saint
[2:36:25] john's he said oh okay he thought they
[2:36:27] would go to this church and he said no
[2:36:31] no
[2:36:32] you didn't go to our brother's church
[2:36:34] no
[2:36:36] and he said why not
[2:36:40] although he wasn't
[2:36:42] going to church at the time it's not
[2:36:43] going to church now
[2:36:45] but still
[2:36:46] he was
[2:36:47] encouraging them that they should have
[2:36:48] come to the church here they said no
[2:36:52] they said that brother
[2:36:54] they said he got no sense of humor
[2:36:56] he says he won't even laugh
[2:37:00] and the brother said what
[2:37:04] might laugh
[2:37:05] he said it can't be the same one i know
[2:37:08] he said he's left with me
[2:37:11] and they said no
[2:37:13] wouldn't have nothing to do with
[2:37:15] because again i remember that quote that
[2:37:17] couple used used to be here
[2:37:18] and one time this year some years ago
[2:37:21] and uh they didn't go to church for a
[2:37:22] while but
[2:37:25] they did they couldn't take the ministry
[2:37:26] of the word
[2:37:28] and because uh
[2:37:30] and
[2:37:31] when they left his wife did call me on
[2:37:33] the phone
[2:37:35] and tell me later she said oh brother
[2:37:37] she said he couldn't take the word
[2:37:39] he said because she said oh we after
[2:37:42] after you preached he said we after the
[2:37:44] service we go out and we would drive
[2:37:46] around for an hour and he would be
[2:37:48] criticized and then talking about the
[2:37:50] what you preached i said what oh yes she
[2:37:53] said she said he just didn't like it
[2:37:56] and so on
[2:37:57] oh i said okay thank you but she she she
[2:38:00] appreciated it amen
[2:38:03] the word
[2:38:04] so
[2:38:05] so again brother sister
[2:38:07] i trust by grace we're coming not just
[2:38:10] to get all
[2:38:11] a good feeling
[2:38:13] well if you're if you're receiving it in
[2:38:15] your heart
[2:38:16] you'll feel good
[2:38:18] if you're perceiving it in your head no
[2:38:20] you won't feel so good
[2:38:22] you know
[2:38:23] god help us
[2:38:25] brother that we're going to be spiritual
[2:38:28] and be sincere
[2:38:30] not carnal
[2:38:32] not intellectual
[2:38:33] but spiritual
[2:38:37] brother abel was spiritual
[2:38:40] cain was carnal
[2:38:41] oh yeah
[2:38:43] grace that we're gonna that we
[2:38:45] appreciate the word
[2:38:46] so he said brother
[2:38:48] truth and sincerity is what we need
[2:38:55] praise the lord
[2:38:59] but he said listen
[2:39:05] he said people don't want to suffer
[2:39:09] and he said that's what's the matter
[2:39:11] today
[2:39:12] he should they come right now and
[2:39:14] believe this word if they didn't have to
[2:39:17] get out of their church if they didn't
[2:39:19] have to be laughed at made fun of no
[2:39:22] they want botany life
[2:39:24] some kind of a wisdom well this life is
[2:39:27] just as good as that
[2:39:30] well that's what if they feel but he
[2:39:32] said it's not he said i'll show you
[2:39:35] where that comes just in a minute he
[2:39:39] said the lord willing
[2:39:41] he said abel by what wisdom theology no
[2:39:46] he said abel by faith
[2:39:48] offered unto god a more excellent
[2:39:50] sacrifice
[2:39:52] and by faith in what by faith
[2:39:56] he said in the word
[2:39:58] he said it was just his father mother
[2:40:01] him and his half brother how in the
[2:40:03] world could it be he said what did he
[2:40:05] have faith in he said
[2:40:08] faith in botany
[2:40:10] no
[2:40:11] faith in this or that no he said he had
[2:40:13] faith in the word because he wanted to
[2:40:16] know why he was out of the garden
[2:40:19] amen
[2:40:20] and god had revealed to him why
[2:40:23] and that's why he made the sacrifice he
[2:40:25] made
[2:40:26] but cain never had that full revelation
[2:40:29] that abel had
[2:40:30] amen that's why he came when offered
[2:40:33] the fruit of the field and what he had
[2:40:35] grown and so on on the altar
[2:40:38] brother
[2:40:40] god wants you to offer yourself
[2:40:44] give yourself to god give your life to
[2:40:46] jesus
[2:40:47] amen
[2:40:51] listen
[2:40:54] the mother would have to say because i
[2:40:56] listened to a lie of the devil because
[2:40:58] this boy here was born and he said
[2:41:00] that's why god put us out
[2:41:04] well he said i can't even get around the
[2:41:06] gate
[2:41:07] and he said there's a chair up there
[2:41:08] with a sword guarding that tree of life
[2:41:10] and so on
[2:41:12] and he says so by wisdom
[2:41:14] cain
[2:41:16] he said you know that not nothing the
[2:41:20] not knowing the word
[2:41:22] but just by thought by wisdom he made a
[2:41:25] nice place and made it pretty and
[2:41:27] beautiful
[2:41:28] but abel by faith
[2:41:32] he saw
[2:41:33] what was in botany life
[2:41:36] he saw it was a sexual affair through
[2:41:39] blood
[2:41:41] there you are brother
[2:41:42] wade over the top of that one time and
[2:41:45] by faith his children still sees it amen
[2:41:50] cain tried to make it nice
[2:41:53] pretty
[2:41:54] but abel
[2:41:56] was facing reality
[2:41:58] of what happened
[2:42:00] let's face the reality
[2:42:04] brother
[2:42:05] there's none righteous no not one
[2:42:08] physically in our new birth in our in
[2:42:10] our natural birth
[2:42:12] it takes an uber
[2:42:14] and then
[2:42:15] we're coming into the revelation of the
[2:42:17] righteous jesus
[2:42:20] he is our righteousness
[2:42:24] amen oh god give us that faith
[2:42:29] not just intellectual belief but that
[2:42:31] real faith
[2:42:33] that i well jesus and we read it in
[2:42:35] romans that he is our righteousness
[2:42:39] he is my righteousness he is your
[2:42:41] righteousness that's why we got to honor
[2:42:43] jesus re reverence jesus amen by the
[2:42:46] grace of god
[2:42:48] let jesus have control
[2:42:52] let jesus control your thoughts your
[2:42:54] words your deeds well well i just got to
[2:42:56] do all i gotta do is believe jesus
[2:42:58] believe that he was he was he was no he
[2:43:01] is
[2:43:02] amen not be was he is
[2:43:05] he's the same yesterday today forever
[2:43:08] not he was
[2:43:09] he is the same
[2:43:13] god help us
[2:43:18] by faith abel
[2:43:20] saw the revelation the vision
[2:43:23] and brought a living running blood
[2:43:25] because life was in the blood
[2:43:28] and he said life is in the stem of the
[2:43:30] flower and it's botany life which has no
[2:43:33] feeling
[2:43:37] and he said i was in hopes that this
[2:43:39] would soak him
[2:43:41] amen
[2:43:42] that came that the
[2:43:44] the cain was offering the things without
[2:43:46] feelings
[2:43:47] but abel
[2:43:49] was offering the lamb with feelings
[2:43:54] he said i was a man through wisdom going
[2:43:56] to understand
[2:43:58] and he said when the whole bible and the
[2:44:00] whole church of god is built upon the
[2:44:02] divine revelation by faith upon this
[2:44:05] rock i'll build my church
[2:44:09] amen
[2:44:11] finish with this
[2:44:12] satan's got more wisdom in that word
[2:44:15] than all the preachers thrown together
[2:44:18] he's got more wisdom than all the
[2:44:19] priests and everything he's got more
[2:44:22] wisdom but he can't have faith
[2:44:24] faith will make it live
[2:44:26] faith would make him repent
[2:44:29] will make him get away from his
[2:44:31] organization
[2:44:32] he's got wisdom so he just stays with
[2:44:35] the word
[2:44:36] amen
[2:44:37] god help us to have the faith that
[2:44:39] pleases god
[2:44:41] amen
[2:44:42] for without that faith it is impossible
[2:44:45] to please him
[2:44:47] grace
[2:44:49] that the word will strike us right
[2:44:51] amen
[2:44:57] again the thought from
[2:44:59] the messenger he said
[2:45:03] we see him meeting after meeting
[2:45:05] and sometimes we just sit just as cold
[2:45:08] and indifferent
[2:45:10] and say yes i know the scripture says it
[2:45:13] oh i've seen it done he said we have no
[2:45:16] enthusiasm it don't seem to strike us
[2:45:19] right
[2:45:20] there don't seem to be that something
[2:45:24] so he said listen
[2:45:28] he said taking a match and striking it
[2:45:31] if the match he said hasn't got the
[2:45:33] sulfur right on the head of the match it
[2:45:35] cannot strike
[2:45:36] and it's you can rake and rake and rake
[2:45:38] but he said if some chemicals has killed
[2:45:41] the sulfur
[2:45:42] he said it will not strike trying to
[2:45:44] light a match
[2:45:46] and he said there will be no light but
[2:45:48] if that chemical that sulfur is still on
[2:45:50] there when it strikes he said it will
[2:45:53] light
[2:45:54] and when the true genuine vindication of
[2:45:56] the scripture of this last day the
[2:45:59] message and you see the presence of
[2:46:01] jesus christ that you had heard what he
[2:46:03] done in his life and hearing the
[2:46:05] scripture say
[2:46:07] is the same
[2:46:08] yesterday today and forever
[2:46:11] and just before the sodom condition is
[2:46:14] fired over with the wrath of god see
[2:46:17] jesus return amongst his people
[2:46:19] formed in human flesh and do the same
[2:46:22] thing he done
[2:46:23] my it ought to strike our souls to glory
[2:46:27] and it ought to do something to us
[2:46:30] amen
[2:46:32] praise the lord
[2:46:33] brother it ought to bring us into a
[2:46:35] rapturing faith for the glory of god
[2:46:38] amen
[2:46:40] grace
[2:46:42] that by faith the holy ghost controls
[2:46:44] you and controls me
[2:46:46] amen
[2:46:49] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[2:46:51] god they are the sons of god
[2:46:54] i trust by grace you're here because the
[2:46:56] holy ghost led you here to hear the word
[2:46:58] today
[2:47:02] some was for this brother this sister
[2:47:05] something else was said for that brother
[2:47:06] or that sister
[2:47:08] i trust
[2:47:09] you were in the spirit to receive it
[2:47:13] for ye have not received the spirit of
[2:47:15] bondage again to fear but you have
[2:47:17] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[2:47:20] we cry
[2:47:22] father father
[2:47:25] and the spirit itself bears witness with
