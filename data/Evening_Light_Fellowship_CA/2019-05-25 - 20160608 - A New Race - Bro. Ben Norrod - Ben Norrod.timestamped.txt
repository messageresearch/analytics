[37:15] [Music]
[37:35] [Music]
[37:37] a man praise the name of the Lord
[37:40] hallelujah
[37:41] god bless you you just want to take just
[37:45] a moment of time before our brother
[37:47] comes again in the liberty to say what
[37:50] he wants to say as the Lord leads them
[37:52] and they can nice - brother you can
[37:55] minister as long as you want and again
[37:57] as the Lord anoint seem by the grace of
[38:00] God so we'll we'll just take take it as
[38:04] being from the Lord as also our brothers
[38:08] visit and our sisters visit with us from
[38:11] from Tennessee and we thank the Lord for
[38:15] our brother Ben Nora and sisters
[38:18] Samantha sister Samantha so the Lord
[38:21] blesses and we have we have experienced
[38:25] a very kindred spirit with our brother
[38:28] and sister
[38:29] a very common spirit the Bible says they
[38:32] had all things common when the Holy
[38:34] Ghost fell on them so as the bride and
[38:37] all the members of the bride they have
[38:39] all things common - because why we had
[38:42] the same anointing and the same spirit
[38:45] by the grace of God our brother he comes
[38:48] as not as a pastor but as an evangelist
[38:51] to minister to us and I remember another
[38:55] evangelist administered for us some
[38:57] years ago and well the new Philander's
[39:02] know him and many others know him and it
[39:05] was our brother Bill Leggett and he said
[39:09] I thank God he said that he made me an
[39:12] evangelist and not a pastor so he said
[39:16] all I've got to do he said has come
[39:18] preach lay it in and leave and he said
[39:23] now he said it's up to the pastor he
[39:26] said after I'm gone he said - I'm here
[39:29] to drive in the nails because the Bible
[39:31] does refer to driving nails into the
[39:33] house of God so he said I'm going to
[39:36] drive in the nails and after I gone he
[39:38] said the pastor can clench them or he
[39:41] said he can pull them out so he said I'm
[39:43] gonna leave that with the pastor so we
[39:45] want our brother
[39:47] then Nora tonight to have that attitude
[39:49] that spiritual alien drivin the nails a
[39:53] man and God by the Holy Ghost is going
[39:55] to clinch it or or if necessary God by
[40:00] the Holy Ghost will pull up the nail but
[40:03] we'll leave that with the Lord because
[40:04] we believe our brother is going to
[40:06] minister the word to us a man and this
[40:10] is not in a denomination oh there we've
[40:13] been called out of that so he can he can
[40:15] minister what God wants us to minister
[40:18] you got ministry what God wants him to
[40:20] minister you got Minister what you need
[40:22] to hear a man not what the church wants
[40:26] you to preach but what God wants you to
[40:27] preach by the grace of God so be in
[40:30] prayer for our brother Bhim as he comes
[40:32] tonight and as I said before he will
[40:35] minister for us on Friday as well and on
[40:39] Sunday morning and Friday night the
[40:42] service will be seven o'clock now 7:30
[40:45] was seven o'clock and the regular says
[40:48] time on Sunday morning
[40:50] so being prayer for our brother tonight
[40:53] being prayer for the service on Friday
[40:55] and on Sunday amen and giving them the
[41:00] Liberty say whatever God puts on your
[41:02] heart brother preach it lay it in I said
[41:05] because it will be what we have need up
[41:08] by the grace of God so we're going to
[41:11] stand and sing I love him and we're
[41:13] going to turn it over to our brother bin
[41:15] glad to have him here
[41:17] amen again how we feel that kindred
[41:21] spirit I'll fellowship with our brother
[41:24] and sister amen so we thank the Lord for
[41:26] that and our brother and sister
[41:28] understand is going to sing a couple of
[41:31] songs for us tonight as well and the
[41:36] brothers put the effort into getting the
[41:39] piano changed and for our brother and
[41:43] sister so that we'd have this piano here
[41:46] instead of the old one and that they
[41:49] took out just just just this last week I
[41:53] guess so we pray God will bless it for
[41:57] our brother and sister as they sing
[42:00] and play by the grace of God hey man so
[42:03] this list lets believe with all of ours
[42:05] that God is with us and listen there are
[42:10] two voices they're trying to get your
[42:14] attention tonight it's now me and
[42:17] brother Ben it's not me or brother Bob
[42:23] but Satan and Jesus which voice are you
[42:30] listening to and I trust by the grace of
[42:34] God that you're listening to the voice
[42:37] of Jesus amen
[42:40] now remember Saints voice is going to
[42:42] sound good you try to justify this
[42:45] justify that and just drop in a negative
[42:48] word here or there but let's believe
[42:51] with all of our hearts and let's listen
[42:52] to Jesus amen let Jesus speak and if
[42:58] there's anything Jesus is going to
[43:00] respond to it'll be his word amen so I
[43:04] pray the grace of God that that
[43:05] anointing will be upon you the anointing
[43:08] of the Holy Ghost
[43:09] the anointing of the of our Lord Jesus
[43:12] Christ not the Antichrist anointing
[43:16] remember the Antichrist anointeth he
[43:19] does not all we think that's out there
[43:21] no he can be right here to get us to
[43:24] deny one word that is the Antichrist
[43:27] anointing so I pray the grace of God
[43:30] that will be under the Christ anointing
[43:32] a man not the Antichrist anointing that
[43:36] we believe the word of God the word
[43:39] that's ordained to call us out yes but
[43:43] it's ordained to get us ready to earth
[43:47] for the going in of the bride of the
[43:50] Lord Jesus Christ let's go out but let's
[43:54] not be left behind let's go in amen
[43:57] be ready for the resurrection and the
[44:00] rapture the climax the change amen
[44:04] so let's believe that God's going to
[44:06] increase our faith tonight amen let's
[44:09] sing it as our brother bin comes and we
[44:11] welcome him
[44:13] all of us welcome our brother tonight

[1:00:40] verse 15 who is the image of the
[1:00:42] invisible God the firstborn of every
[1:00:44] creature for by him we're all things
[1:00:46] created that are in heaven and that are
[1:00:49] in earth visible and invisible whether
[1:00:52] they be Thrones or dominions or
[1:00:54] principalities or powers all things were
[1:00:58] created by him and for him and he is
[1:01:02] before all things and by him all things
[1:01:05] consist
[1:01:07] and he is the head of the body the
[1:01:10] church who is the beginning the
[1:01:13] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:01:16] things he
[1:01:17] y'all getting the idea that God wants to
[1:01:18] take this church over for himself all
[1:01:21] these he's makes you wonder it's not
[1:01:24] about a church not about a prophet or a
[1:01:26] preacher
[1:01:26] it's about he
[1:01:29] don't know how to say a man now here

[1:01:34] now in all things you might have the
[1:01:36] preeminence for it please the father
[1:01:38] that in him should all fullness dwell
[1:01:40] when having made peace through the blood
[1:01:43] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[1:01:47] things unto himself by him are you
[1:01:51] getting the message yet this is about

[1:02:17] and Lord as we bow our heads to your
[1:02:20] presence we are coming in a humble
[1:02:22] manner Lord and humbling and belittling
[1:02:25] ourselves before your presence knowing
[1:02:26] that before me stands tonight the
[1:02:29] purchase of your blood I have no ability
[1:02:31] within myself Lamb of God to help these
[1:02:34] people or to encourage or do anything
[1:02:36] Lord of a supernatural manner being a
[1:02:38] natural man but lord I pray that you
[1:02:41] would come and anoint that little
[1:02:43] deposit of yourself down in my life
[1:02:45] tonight the Lord I could get myself out
[1:02:47] of the way that you could use me to
[1:02:49] speak to these your children
[1:02:50] Lord God I pray that you would anoint
[1:02:53] their eyes and their ears that they
[1:02:55] might be receptive all that you would
[1:02:57] want to speak to us tonight Lord I pray
[1:02:59] that you would just have your free
[1:03:01] course and that Lord if there be
[1:03:03] anything at all that you'd want to lead
[1:03:05] me in another direction off my notes in
[1:03:07] a different channel I submit myself to
[1:03:10] you tonight
[1:03:10] to do all and everything you desire to
[1:03:13] do Lord Jesus if you want to keep us
[1:03:16] here all night long until tomorrow
[1:03:17] morning let the little glory of God
[1:03:19] falling around Lord we won't look at the
[1:03:21] clock we won't be anxious we won't be
[1:03:23] nervous
[1:03:24] we'll set ready listening and father for
[1:03:26] all that you will speak to our hearts
[1:03:29] and Lord God I believe we'll leave here
[1:03:31] saying our hearts have burned within us
[1:03:33] I pray that you would anoint the needs
[1:03:35] of the requests of your children
[1:03:37] standing here tonight every hand that
[1:03:38] was lifted every heart that would have a
[1:03:40] precious need upon it up
[1:03:42] your spirit would just be mindful of
[1:03:44] those things and I commit the service
[1:03:46] now both speaker and listener to thy
[1:03:49] hands in Jesus name Amen god bless you
[1:03:52] may be seated
[1:03:54] [Applause]
[1:03:59] when you go to looking at this what Paul
[1:04:01] speaks of in the first chapter of this
[1:04:04] book of Colossians it really illuminates
[1:04:08] the position of the body of Christ and
[1:04:12] the position of Christ himself and for
[1:04:15] many of the chapters that you will read
[1:04:17] in Colossians Ephesians Galatians and
[1:04:21] the different text that deals with
[1:04:22] Christ's headship this here in these
[1:04:25] verses that we've read seems to be the
[1:04:27] one that has the most elimination to it
[1:04:30] and for whatever reason that God
[1:04:33] directed the Apostle Paul to speak these
[1:04:35] words just in this manner he not only
[1:04:38] just speaks of Christ's headship but he
[1:04:41] actually goes all the way to the
[1:04:43] beginning of creation and he closes it
[1:04:45] off at the end showing the three-fold
[1:04:48] purpose of God showing the development
[1:04:51] if as it were of the body of Christ
[1:04:52] showing the creation the virgin-born
[1:04:55] creation of the Lord Jesus he takes all
[1:04:57] of these things and wraps them together
[1:04:59] and these few verses that we read here
[1:05:01] now what's wonderful about the way that
[1:05:04] Paul says this is he is giving to us an
[1:05:07] understanding of more than just Jesus
[1:05:10] coming to the earth now we realized that
[1:05:12] of course that before Jesus was actually
[1:05:15] born that God record by the Redman hears
[1:05:17] the smoke as a paragraph 88 that God was
[1:05:20] forming himself he said toward flesh and
[1:05:23] they're the logos or the theophany of
[1:05:25] God became the image of God who was the
[1:05:29] image of the invisible now you pick this
[1:05:31] up in verse 15 now Paul is describing
[1:05:34] that just in that manner that he is the
[1:05:37] image of the invisible God but then he
[1:05:40] goes on this next a little part if
[1:05:42] you're looking at it they're the
[1:05:43] firstborn of every creature now right
[1:05:46] there in just a few little sampling of
[1:05:48] words we have Genesis chapter 1 all the
[1:05:51] way back before creation and now we're
[1:05:54] bringing it all the way up to Matthew
[1:05:55] chapter 1
[1:05:56] all the way into Revelation chapter 1 in
[1:05:58] just a few words right there on that
[1:06:00] first verse now by the help of the Lord
[1:06:02] tonight I want to try to break down some
[1:06:04] of these parts and go back into that and
[1:06:07] show for example how that God started as
[1:06:10] we say now we know the Lord is eternal
[1:06:11] of course but in our mind as human
[1:06:14] beings we always look for a place to
[1:06:16] start
[1:06:17] and as we go and look at the creation as
[1:06:20] the creation begins to unfold as the
[1:06:22] Holy Spirit begin to open up as brother
[1:06:25] brems said God had a thought in his mind
[1:06:27] they begin to dwell on that thought and
[1:06:29] brother BAM said the thoughts of God
[1:06:31] became his desires and as he thought on
[1:06:34] certain things he desired after him you
[1:06:36] know what that's like
[1:06:37] when you had a certain and purpose or
[1:06:39] achievement something you really wanted
[1:06:40] to do it just seemed like the more you
[1:06:42] thought about it the more of a hunger
[1:06:44] started developing inside of you and the
[1:06:46] more your thought and the more you
[1:06:47] thought the worse it got anybody know
[1:06:49] what I'm talking about
[1:06:50] well that's the way it was with the Lord
[1:06:52] Jesus Almighty God before the foundation
[1:06:54] of the world begins to thank brother
[1:06:56] brems said of what things would be now
[1:06:59] remember before there was creation Sun
[1:07:02] Moon star Jupiter Mars Saturn Pluto all
[1:07:05] of these planets we see around us all of
[1:07:07] the creation on the earth before there
[1:07:09] was angels before there was anything God
[1:07:12] himself was the great eternal now we
[1:07:15] know that this eternal being
[1:07:17] never did begin never did end and yet he
[1:07:20] dwelt there for the bem said with his
[1:07:22] thoughts all he could think of on a
[1:07:23] daily basis as we would think of it is
[1:07:26] just these thoughts that he had in his
[1:07:28] mind and as God began to think and want
[1:07:31] to fellowship with these thoughts he
[1:07:33] realized that the only way that he could
[1:07:35] truly fellowship with these thoughts it
[1:07:38] would have to go beyond meditation it
[1:07:40] would have to go beyond just simply
[1:07:42] thinking upon these things but would
[1:07:44] have to actually manifest that which was
[1:07:47] in his mind he said for the man I know
[1:07:49] all this oh I know you do but we need to
[1:07:52] hear it again sometimes because I think
[1:07:54] we fail to see that the very purpose of
[1:07:57] creation itself was based upon God's
[1:08:00] desire to fellowship with you his whole
[1:08:04] desire his whole unction everything
[1:08:07] about him was he wanted to fellowship
[1:08:10] and share his eternal life with
[1:08:12] humankind now we realized that when the
[1:08:14] Spirit of God begins to move as we see
[1:08:17] him there in Genesis 1 he moves on the
[1:08:19] face of the waters there's always a
[1:08:21] purpose when God begins to move we've
[1:08:24] seen there in Genesis 1 begin moving and
[1:08:26] we watch him down through the creations
[1:08:27] of time down through the dispensations
[1:08:29] of time he's always moving that's the
[1:08:32] thing about the Lord Jesus he's never
[1:08:33] stopped he's never went backwards
[1:08:35] he is always moving forward never moving
[1:08:38] backwards his plan and his program is
[1:08:41] ticking right along just like it should
[1:08:43] be there's nothing out of cater I know
[1:08:45] we get to think it in our mind that
[1:08:47] sometimes things are out of order I Got
[1:08:49] News for you there is not one single
[1:08:52] thing tonight that is falling out of
[1:08:54] order it is moving exactly the way that
[1:08:57] the Spirit of God desired that it would
[1:08:59] move before the foundation of the world
[1:09:02] praise the Lord somebody the devil
[1:09:05] hasn't pulled anything over on God
[1:09:07] friends trudeau or Obama or Trump or
[1:09:11] Hillary or none of them have got any
[1:09:13] kind of a special understanding that God
[1:09:15] don't have the Holy Spirit knows the
[1:09:18] very end from the beginning
[1:09:20] amen praise the Lord for that now notice
[1:09:23] again look at verse 15 I just want to
[1:09:25] take my time for a little bit break some
[1:09:26] of this down and then either help the
[1:09:28] Lord will run like we're our hair's on
[1:09:30] fire and we're not a mile from water now
[1:09:32] watch again who is the image of the
[1:09:34] invisible God now here as we see the
[1:09:37] very breaking of creation we go back
[1:09:39] into the book of Genesis and we hear
[1:09:41] brother Branham say that God began to a
[1:09:43] create as he begin to create you said
[1:09:45] the first creation was light somebody
[1:09:48] there was over Grand Falls past Sunday
[1:09:50] you heard me preaching on this now that
[1:09:52] God began to form himself into an image
[1:09:55] that man could see and you say brother
[1:09:57] bin see absolutely in Houston we get a
[1:09:59] picture of the pillar of fire we could
[1:10:01] seem we could actually view him with our
[1:10:04] eyes we can feel him with our flesh do
[1:10:07] you realize that the Spirit of God so
[1:10:09] long for you to be able to come in
[1:10:11] contact with him that when that first
[1:10:14] little breaking of the light of God that
[1:10:16] first little breaking of that little
[1:10:18] halo that little logos that broke
[1:10:20] I imagine the heart of Almighty God was
[1:10:23] just bursting the joy knowing he was
[1:10:26] only just a few minutes away in eternity
[1:10:28] if a thousand years is like a day in his
[1:10:31] mind he thought I'm only a few minutes
[1:10:33] away from being able to become so
[1:10:35] tangible that my children will be able
[1:10:38] to handle me they'll be able to speak to
[1:10:40] me they'll be able to feel I will be
[1:10:42] able to feel for them oh my that's the
[1:10:45] kind of God he wanted to be to you and I
[1:10:47] he didn't want to be a judge he didn't
[1:10:49] want to come down and just be a judge
[1:10:51] ready to throw us in hell for any little
[1:10:53] mistake or anything we've done wrong but
[1:10:55] he wanted to become tangible hallelujah
[1:10:59] that we could feel the presence of God
[1:11:01] that we could converse that we can
[1:11:02] fellowship with him Oh
[1:11:04] [Applause]
[1:11:05] oh that ought to make a message person
[1:11:08] shout watch us now look again the image
[1:11:11] of the invisible God now if we take that
[1:11:13] little section right there now you have
[1:11:16] Genesis all the way to Malachi he was
[1:11:20] God above us he was God above us not God
[1:11:25] with us as of yet but he was God above
[1:11:28] us they would see him in the temple he
[1:11:31] would become so great they couldn't even
[1:11:33] minister because of the outbreak of his
[1:11:35] presence he would become an image that
[1:11:38] they would be able to see descend down
[1:11:40] into the tabernacle as the sacrifice
[1:11:41] would go up they'd be able to look and
[1:11:43] say that's gone back there but there was
[1:11:45] so much more he had in his heart then
[1:11:48] just to be viewed from a distance you
[1:11:51] understand what I'm trying to prove see
[1:11:52] you tonight
[1:11:52] I want you to know that this God that we
[1:11:55] claim we serve he wants to become very
[1:11:57] personal to you tonight he wants to be
[1:12:00] more than just a book that you read come
[1:12:02] on somebody he wants to be more than a
[1:12:04] song that you sing he wants to be more
[1:12:06] than just something we talk about his
[1:12:08] Sunday dinner but he wants to become the
[1:12:10] very life source of your heart Oh
[1:12:12] hallelujah
[1:12:14] to the Lamb of God he wants to become
[1:12:16] something that absolutely can become the
[1:12:18] essence of who you genuinely are I hear
[1:12:23] but the men saying Christ is a mystery
[1:12:25] he is the center of life of the
[1:12:29] revelation and he said Christ's life in
[1:12:32] you makes him the center of your life is
[1:12:35] wet yeah and then he flips it around and
[1:12:37] he said in Christ's life and you makes
[1:12:39] you the center of the life of the
[1:12:41] revelation you understand heaven and
[1:12:44] earth came down and embraced and hugged
[1:12:46] and kissed and guess who got caught in
[1:12:48] the middle of the smack ha ha ha whoo
[1:12:51] praise the lord senba honey
[1:12:52] amen that's right the Holy Spirit
[1:12:54] absolutely embraced humanity now watch
[1:12:58] him now as he brings it down to the
[1:12:59] firstborn of every creature now this is
[1:13:02] where we want to go along for just a
[1:13:03] little bit if you turn me in Matthew
[1:13:05] chapter 1 verse 22 now let's just review
[1:13:07] just a little bit some of these more
[1:13:09] simplistic things that we already know
[1:13:11] but just to get a picture of where I
[1:13:13] want to try to go tonight Matthew
[1:13:15] chapter 1 verse 22 now notice as Matthew
[1:13:20] begins to relate the picture of the
[1:13:22] virgin birth I love how he opens this up
[1:13:25] with his reflection upon the Prophet
[1:13:29] saying now watch now all of this was
[1:13:30] done that it might be fulfilled which
[1:13:32] was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet
[1:13:35] saying behold a virgin shall be with
[1:13:38] child now watch and shall bring forth a
[1:13:42] son and they shall call his name
[1:13:44] Emmanuel which being interpreted is what
[1:13:48] God with us now could you imagine in
[1:13:52] your mind what this must have made God
[1:13:55] feel like when he moved on this prophet
[1:13:58] many hundreds of years prior to the
[1:14:01] prophecy coming in where God spoke out
[1:14:03] and said a virgin shall conceive brother
[1:14:06] BAM said let's think of Isaiah he might
[1:14:08] have been actually a little bit
[1:14:09] embarrassed when God said it because for
[1:14:12] the human mind it doesn't make sense
[1:14:13] that a virgin would conceive everybody
[1:14:17] is pretty well acquainted with how we
[1:14:18] got here and last I checked virgins
[1:14:21] don't conceive praise the Lord
[1:14:24] so there had to be a program laid out
[1:14:27] that God would bring himself into
[1:14:30] humanity hallelujah and he would bring
[1:14:33] himself tangible to humanity and he
[1:14:37] would do so in a way that would be above
[1:14:39] the fall in the Garden of Eden now you
[1:14:42] go back to the beginning you realized
[1:14:43] that the sexual program is what broke
[1:14:45] the thing in the beginning whenever Eve
[1:14:47] come it's adultery with the serpent she
[1:14:49] turns and gives to her husband but them
[1:14:51] said she never the serpent that morning
[1:14:52] her husband that night one act he said
[1:14:54] to children now because of this this
[1:14:57] this first transgression this fall in
[1:15:00] the Garden of Eden then every person
[1:15:02] that comes to this earth comes as a
[1:15:05] breaker of God's Word already he said
[1:15:07] the day you eat thereof is the day you
[1:15:10] die so the moment you take the breath of
[1:15:12] life you have already broke the word of
[1:15:13] God it doesn't matter how many churches
[1:15:15] you join or how religious you might get
[1:15:17] or how many quotes you might memorize
[1:15:19] the moment you break the matrix of your
[1:15:22] mother's womb you have already broke the
[1:15:24] word of God to move somebody and by
[1:15:27] breaking that word of God he that is
[1:15:29] guilty of one he is guilty of every bit
[1:15:31] of it
[1:15:32] you understand we come to this world
[1:15:34] without even a prayer without even a
[1:15:37] chance at anything whatsoever
[1:15:39] but there was a prophecy hanging out
[1:15:41] there a virgin shall conceive praise God
[1:15:45] he desired he wanted to know what it
[1:15:48] would be like to experience what we go
[1:15:50] through in this life what it would be
[1:15:52] like to be a human being
[1:15:53] but he knew that he could not come to
[1:15:55] sexual route or he would be a breaker of
[1:15:57] the word himself and I'm gonna go on
[1:16:00] record and say something right now
[1:16:01] Joseph was not his father
[1:16:05] Mary was not his mother God was his
[1:16:10] father God was his mother if not you and
[1:16:14] I are still in the sin tonight praise
[1:16:17] the Lord somebody yeah that's exactly
[1:16:19] right now you said we better be it
[1:16:21] oh no she never provided not one falling
[1:16:24] cell not one germ not one cell not one
[1:16:27] atom not one molecule of the human body
[1:16:31] could be transmitted to Jesus or else we
[1:16:33] are absolutely insane all together he
[1:16:36] was created
[1:16:37] the fall he was created above the fall
[1:16:41] in the Garden of Eden so when he spent
[1:16:43] there he can say who can accuse me of
[1:16:45] sin nobody could cast the stone at me
[1:16:48] that's how you could keep the word like
[1:16:50] he was because he was virgin more me
[1:16:52] don't you understand if we would have
[1:16:54] come to the through the virgin route as
[1:16:56] it were we would have never been
[1:16:57] breakers of God's Word we would have
[1:17:00] come just like he came the whole group
[1:17:02] were hey hey man
[1:17:04] but once we received this this
[1:17:06] engrafting of the fall that took place
[1:17:08] in the garden of Eve we're already a
[1:17:09] breaker of God's work and we don't even
[1:17:11] have a chance but here this virgin to be
[1:17:13] conceives Jesus I made this remark many
[1:17:17] times the devil might have been doubting
[1:17:19] who he was he sees Mary standing there
[1:17:22] cooking you called him buns we call them
[1:17:26] biscuits mm-hmm she might have been
[1:17:28] cooking some sausage and biscuits and
[1:17:30] all of a sudden the smell hits her nose
[1:17:32] is she the devil says I've seen that
[1:17:35] before about three or four months down
[1:17:38] the road she starts swelling in her
[1:17:39] stomach the devil says I've seen that
[1:17:42] before
[1:17:43] after so long the braxton-hicks start in
[1:17:46] she starts having the pre birth pains
[1:17:47] and she'll cry out the devil says I've
[1:17:50] seen that before
[1:17:51] goes along right to the birthing part
[1:17:53] water blood life placenta umbilical cord
[1:17:57] the devil said I've seen all that before
[1:18:00] but you see friends the mystery wasn't
[1:18:02] what was on the outside the mystery was
[1:18:04] what was on the inside
[1:18:07] come on somebody the mystery was hiding
[1:18:11] on the inside when you see me you really
[1:18:13] don't see me but you see the outside
[1:18:15] that holds the real mystery
[1:18:17] oh my notice he said he was the creator
[1:18:19] of those things that were visible or
[1:18:22] invisible Oh glory to God now watch here
[1:18:27] in verse 23 again behold a virgin shall
[1:18:28] be with child shall bring forth a son
[1:18:31] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:18:33] which is being interpreted God with us
[1:18:35] then Joseph being raised from sleep and
[1:18:38] did as the angel of the Lord had bidden
[1:18:40] him took unto him his wife and he knew
[1:18:42] her not until she brought forth her
[1:18:44] firstborn son and he called his name
[1:18:47] Jesus this was his firstborn God's
[1:18:53] firstborn now this one son is going to
[1:18:57] bring many sons under repentance but
[1:19:01] they're under the Covenant of this old
[1:19:02] race you see brother mem tells us in
[1:19:05] condemnation by representation every one
[1:19:07] of us was represented by Adam and being
[1:19:10] the head of this human race were under
[1:19:12] that canopy of sin there's no way that
[1:19:15] we can escape but you understand there's
[1:19:17] not enough religion in the world to
[1:19:19] change the way you were born there's not
[1:19:22] enough self-help books there's not
[1:19:24] enough psychology there's not enough
[1:19:26] preachers there's not enough nothing to
[1:19:28] change the way that you were born and
[1:19:29] this worked we all come the same route
[1:19:33] so that goes to prove friends it's gonna
[1:19:35] take the grace of God to get us out of
[1:19:36] here it's gonna take more than being a
[1:19:39] good reformer a reformed type person oh
[1:19:42] I don't smoke I don't drink I don't cuss
[1:19:45] but how was your born resort somebody oh
[1:19:49] I don't lie but how was your born oh I'm
[1:19:52] a church member but how was your bar
[1:19:55] because your birth will tell who is your
[1:19:59] headship now go back to Colossians
[1:20:01] chapter 1 let's look at that just a
[1:20:03] little bit look at again verse 15 now
[1:20:06] watch now Paul is beginning to show us
[1:20:09] that with a new birth we get a new
[1:20:12] headship you understand there's not a
[1:20:16] Muslim there's not a Buddhist there's
[1:20:18] not a Sikh a Jain or a Christian or a
[1:20:21] Catholic that ain't in the same boat
[1:20:23] every one of us before religion is even
[1:20:26] introduced into our life every one of us
[1:20:27] is born into this sexual program there's
[1:20:30] no way in the world you can escape it
[1:20:32] last I checked ain't no test-tube baby's
[1:20:34] been born yet First Lord ain't open no
[1:20:38] genetic modifications and if they do so
[1:20:41] they take sinful life and they modified
[1:20:43] to do something else even if they get
[1:20:46] smart enough to almost recreate in a
[1:20:47] sense it's still sinful mankind
[1:20:50] producing a body don't you understand
[1:20:53] there's no hope except for the new birth
[1:20:54] of the Lord Jesus Christ to become
[1:20:57] indoctrinated that's good it might make
[1:20:59] you a moral person but moral people
[1:21:01] don't go to heaven save people do please
[1:21:07] God
[1:21:08] oh my look at her get in verse 15 who is
[1:21:11] the image of the invisible God the
[1:21:13] firstborn of every creature here we go
[1:21:16] he's becoming now into the image of the
[1:21:19] invisible God and the image of this
[1:21:22] invisible God is now born think about it
[1:21:27] the image is now birth before they could
[1:21:34] see him in the temple they could look
[1:21:36] over there and see him stick it and
[1:21:37] stickiness his wings out as it were the
[1:21:40] Holy Spirit and flying out there above
[1:21:42] that Tabernacle but now he's a baby the
[1:21:48] image of Jehovah is now dwelling in a
[1:21:52] blood cell over to God
[1:21:55] no wonder Satan despised that prophecy
[1:21:59] in some much until he moved on modern
[1:22:01] day politics to try to stop the move of
[1:22:04] that deliverer
[1:22:05] because he knew if that blood could be
[1:22:07] created that if God could embody himself
[1:22:10] and God could dwell amongst humanity
[1:22:12] that he could save humanity from their
[1:22:14] conditions don't kid yourself friends
[1:22:18] the devil had some knowledge about what
[1:22:20] was going to happen because in pilots
[1:22:22] all you have two men standing there and
[1:22:24] they say what shall we do with this
[1:22:27] Jesus called the Christ remember who was
[1:22:30] there with him don't you Barabbas but
[1:22:32] that was not his first name Barabbas was
[1:22:35] his surname his first name was Jesus
[1:22:39] somebody please tell me how did the
[1:22:42] devil know the redemptive name of God it
[1:22:45] goes to prove he has some understanding
[1:22:47] and what was getting ready to happen
[1:22:49] he knew somehow he had the ability to
[1:22:52] look into the prophecies of the hour to
[1:22:54] look at the cycle of God's moving and
[1:22:56] realize God was about ready to visit
[1:22:59] humanity he was about ready to power and
[1:23:04] power in the humanities way to be able
[1:23:06] to birth us into a different channel
[1:23:11] every prophet in the Old Testament
[1:23:13] foreshadowed it Ezekiel said I'm gonna
[1:23:16] put my spirit within your spirit and no
[1:23:19] doubt the devil stopped and thought in
[1:23:20] that how's he gonna do that
[1:23:21] how is he gonna put his spirit within
[1:23:24] their spirit they've got a sinful heart
[1:23:26] they came to the world with a sinful
[1:23:28] nature that old man that they was born
[1:23:31] with that thing has got to die but if
[1:23:35] they die how will they ever be reborn
[1:23:36] he had no understanding of death burial
[1:23:39] and resurrection no understanding that
[1:23:41] God
[1:23:42] who was the Great Creator he was gonna
[1:23:45] actually Tabernacle on the inside when
[1:23:47] he looked at this Tabernacle here he
[1:23:49] didn't realize it represented a man that
[1:23:52] would one day be full of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:54] but man tells us an Auburn Kentucky he
[1:23:56] said just as the ark dropped into its
[1:23:59] proper sockets he said so as the Holy
[1:24:01] Spirit dropping into his proper channel
[1:24:03] that's into the heart of man it will
[1:24:05] oh thank you Lord Jesus now notice as he
[1:24:10] becomes born this invisible God now
[1:24:13] becomes birth look verse 16 for by him
[1:24:16] we're all things created now watch here
[1:24:18] heaven earth visible invisible he said
[1:24:25] what you say if you saw the Son of Man
[1:24:27] ascending and descending and angels up
[1:24:29] and down before Abraham was I said how
[1:24:35] can you been a man 50 years old how can
[1:24:38] you say before Abraham was you were
[1:24:40] because Jesus had a revelation of who he
[1:24:42] was that's how he knew just like I can
[1:24:45] say that when I hear that the very word
[1:24:47] of God is eagle food I leave this other
[1:24:49] thing out here in the world I've been
[1:24:51] been formed the living image of the
[1:24:52] Living God
[1:24:52] I hear from a theophany you say how can
[1:24:55] you say that because I've got a
[1:24:56] revelation of where I came from come on
[1:24:59] somebody I've got a revelation of where
[1:25:01] I came from I'm not the son of homeroom
[1:25:03] women or Manning car by the Holy Ghost
[1:25:07] I've been placed here I've been born an
[1:25:12] image Genesis 1:26 point 7 laughs make
[1:25:16] man and Adam steps on the earth brother
[1:25:24] brems said he had his toes sticking in
[1:25:26] the ground his arms sticking out like a
[1:25:28] dead tree and blasphemous names a
[1:25:31] prophet of God said he had breath
[1:25:33] because he breathed his lungs breathed
[1:25:35] but he said you didn't have a living
[1:25:37] soul until God breathed into his
[1:25:40] nostrils the breath of life well think
[1:25:45] about it friends there'd be many people
[1:25:47] on this earth sitting right here tonight
[1:25:48] message searches that's got breath in
[1:25:50] their lungs but they ain't got no holy
[1:25:51] breath they've got breath to be able to
[1:25:54] use their breath to quote quote says
[1:25:56] repeat scriptures but they ain't got no
[1:25:58] breath inside of their soul to make him
[1:26:00] a living being with Christ all things
[1:26:04] were created by him and for him amen he
[1:26:08] is before all things and by oh things
[1:26:12] consist all right now watch now that
[1:26:14] just as soon as he breaks in to the
[1:26:17] birth part
[1:26:18] watch what he starts doing he starts
[1:26:21] reclaiming the headship over his body in
[1:26:25] verse 18 he is the head of the body
[1:26:29] friends nobody in the Old Testament
[1:26:31] talked like this nobody talked about him
[1:26:35] being headship why there was no headship
[1:26:38] as far as long as they were under the
[1:26:40] animal sacrifice how could he truly be
[1:26:42] their head when a man would walk in and
[1:26:44] they would kill the lamb he would paint
[1:26:46] over their sin and that sin was still
[1:26:48] laying inside of his heart how could he
[1:26:50] ever truly genuinely be their headship
[1:26:53] but all what is Paul telling us that
[1:26:55] there will come an hour when he will be
[1:26:57] not only just the invisible God and in
[1:27:00] the image of the invisible God not only
[1:27:03] will he be the Creator but he will
[1:27:05] become the head of his body now last I
[1:27:12] checked my head and my body are the same
[1:27:14] right I got a Benjamin head I know it's
[1:27:18] ugly but I don't have a duck body I
[1:27:22] don't have an elf body I don't have a
[1:27:25] chicken body I may act like a chicken
[1:27:27] every now and then but I'm human being
[1:27:30] last I checked ah praise the Lord
[1:27:32] come on now don't be afraid to say a man
[1:27:35] it ain't gonna hurt you none come on now
[1:27:37] I might have a human head but I don't
[1:27:39] have an alligator body why my body is
[1:27:42] the same as my head so if the head was
[1:27:46] virgin-born
[1:27:47] if the Hat was the image of the
[1:27:50] invisible God sighs does the body have
[1:27:53] to be the same as the head so I here for
[1:27:57] them said rising in the Sun she is him
[1:28:00] Oh hallelujah as the husband and wife or
[1:28:06] one so is she wanted him watch his the
[1:28:09] head of the body the church what's that
[1:28:12] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:28:16] the dead now I like this next part verse
[1:28:23] 20 if you look at this again having made
[1:28:25] peace through the blood of his cross now
[1:28:30] I'm gonna say something I won't don't
[1:28:32] want you misunderstand me but we speak
[1:28:35] of the cross of Calvary how wonderful it
[1:28:37] is thank God
[1:28:38] they'll never get away from the cross
[1:28:40] you needed all the days of your life I
[1:28:42] still need to revisit it from time to
[1:28:44] time I don't know some of you hold the
[1:28:46] chairman's in here maybe you don't even
[1:28:47] know what I'm talking about but rest of
[1:28:49] us human means we understand I need the
[1:28:52] cross of my life now don't misunderstand
[1:28:54] what I'm getting ready to say but really
[1:28:56] it was not the rugged cross that saved
[1:28:59] me really in a way but it was a deeper
[1:29:02] cross than just that cross because any
[1:29:05] man could hang on a tree and die a
[1:29:07] crucifixion death but now listen close
[1:29:09] it was a deeper cross than that that
[1:29:13] caused my salvation it was when God
[1:29:16] crossed himself with humanity and when
[1:29:20] God crossed himself with humanity to
[1:29:23] become one of us it was really that
[1:29:25] cross that produced my salvation at the
[1:29:28] other cross I hope you hear what I'm
[1:29:31] saying to you any man could die any man
[1:29:34] could shed his blood but there was only
[1:29:36] one that was that blood cell broke open
[1:29:38] that the power of the Holy Ghost could
[1:29:41] break back on humanity and birth them
[1:29:44] into a new race altogether
[1:29:47] it was more than just a man dying on a
[1:29:50] piece of wood but it was the cross from
[1:29:52] them said God stretched out his tent he
[1:29:55] [Applause]
[1:29:56] stretched out his jet and he crossed
[1:29:59] himself with mankind that's really the
[1:30:04] cross that saved me because without that
[1:30:07] cross there would have been no other
[1:30:08] cross brother Gerald without that cross
[1:30:10] that would have been no other
[1:30:11] manifestation all there was two themes
[1:30:14] dying on the other side of him and when
[1:30:16] they said it is finished when their life
[1:30:17] went out of their body it didn't produce
[1:30:19] salvation for you and I why there was no
[1:30:21] cross between God and man but the man in
[1:30:25] the middle also what I fell in love with
[1:30:27] his cross is what produced life and
[1:30:30] salvation for you and I hang on
[1:30:37] everybody but unless you become cross
[1:30:39] with God you ain't getting out of here
[1:30:42] either
[1:30:43] you've got to cross yourself with him he
[1:30:46] became me that I could cross myself with
[1:30:49] him come on somebody come on somebody
[1:30:51] preach with me yes I have to cross
[1:30:54] myself with him can become like him how
[1:31:00] are you a sex born man how are you going
[1:31:02] to become virgin born well you see I'm
[1:31:05] not like Nicodemus I don't plan on
[1:31:07] climbing back into mamas womb but
[1:31:10] there's another womb he's working on the
[1:31:12] womb of my heart the womb of my mind the
[1:31:14] womb of my chat my soul my headquarters
[1:31:17] as it were the very control tower of Who
[1:31:20] I am that's the part he's working on the
[1:31:23] inside
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:26] mmmm said if he could ever get you to
[1:31:28] agree with the word he said he would
[1:31:31] burn out kill out that old nature you
[1:31:34] were born with friends I'm afraid to
[1:31:38] many people think that the Church of God
[1:31:40] is a reforming station hello
[1:31:44] they think it's a social club they come
[1:31:47] here to get psychological help they come
[1:31:49] here to get a psychological
[1:31:51] understanding to be revamped in their
[1:31:53] brain the way they think about things
[1:31:55] that's not salvation
[1:31:56] praise Lord I can help other people
[1:31:58] another situation but that's not
[1:32:00] receiving the Holy Ghost receiving the
[1:32:02] Holy Ghost comes by one way death burial
[1:32:05] and resurrection oh I wish somebody
[1:32:07] would help me preach I'm talking about
[1:32:09] death Bharath and that's your women to
[1:32:12] die and the other way you can die is you
[1:32:15] got to pick up another cross you got to
[1:32:20] pick up another cross not a cross
[1:32:22] between your mom and your dad not a
[1:32:24] cross between you and the preacher but
[1:32:26] you've got to cross yourself cry stop
[1:32:28] stop with that word so that you can
[1:32:30] become one with him excuse me praising
[1:32:37] lemon confit had he made peace through
[1:32:41] the blood of his cross now you realize
[1:32:44] Jesus walking down the street he could
[1:32:47] have stumbled fell scraped his knee
[1:32:49] blood run out that was not the
[1:32:52] reconciliation of my sins why there was
[1:32:55] no death attack
[1:32:56] to it remember atonement could only take
[1:33:00] place when death was attached to the
[1:33:03] shedding of blood as a boy he might have
[1:33:06] been working on something cut his finger
[1:33:07] the blood run out that was not for the
[1:33:09] remission of my sins why no death
[1:33:12] attached to it that's why I had to go to
[1:33:14] the cross because the only way you can
[1:33:16] birth a new race there's got to be a
[1:33:18] death first are you hearing me there's
[1:33:22] got to be a death first if there was no
[1:33:24] death there can be no atonement attached
[1:33:26] to it so he had to die you say I wish he
[1:33:29] wouldn't have but he had to he had no
[1:33:32] choice but to die so that the blood
[1:33:34] could be attached the shake could be
[1:33:37] attached to the atonement could be
[1:33:38] attached to the shedding of blood it
[1:33:43] wasn't good enough for that priest to
[1:33:45] walk up her and just cut the back of the
[1:33:46] leg of that lamb let it bleed a little
[1:33:48] bit and say well you've done your
[1:33:49] religion you got the token mommy and
[1:33:51] daddy I believe for you go on mm-hmm
[1:33:56] praise the Lord Lord y'all got real
[1:33:58] quiet maybe I hit a nerve there come on
[1:34:03] now it had to be more than that it had
[1:34:05] to be more than just a slight shedding
[1:34:08] of blood but remember said when Abel
[1:34:10] took his lamb and threw him on the altar
[1:34:12] he said he took a rock and hack him to
[1:34:14] pieces
[1:34:14] why because only resurrection comes at
[1:34:17] the time of giving of all life is the
[1:34:21] only way you can bring forth
[1:34:23] resurrection that's why you cannot
[1:34:25] halfway give yourself and expect to be
[1:34:27] all the way resurrected you can't just
[1:34:31] come to church and be a social member
[1:34:33] and expect to have full resurrection
[1:34:34] you've got to lay yourself open before
[1:34:37] that word and say okay God any part of
[1:34:39] me be it my soul my spirit my memory my
[1:34:43] imagination my conscience my reason
[1:34:46] whatever it is you hack me to pieces
[1:34:48] you've got to cut me if you've got to
[1:34:51] slice me and dice me you've got to tell
[1:34:54] me why
[1:34:56] do what you got to do so I can attain to
[1:35:00] resurrection
[1:35:04] oh my made peace through the blood of
[1:35:10] his Christ by his cross rather by him to
[1:35:14] reconcile all things unto himself so the
[1:35:18] only way I can be virgin-born is I've
[1:35:20] got to be a part of the virgin bore one
[1:35:23] that's why the Bible said we're hid in
[1:35:25] Christ to God if he saw me for the Bob
[1:35:30] what do i what am I gonna offer to him
[1:35:32] all I have to do is pull my pedigree and
[1:35:35] he can tell where I was born and when I
[1:35:37] was born and where I was born hat I have
[1:35:39] no other credentials as a human being
[1:35:42] outside of my birth certificate
[1:35:44] what else could I offer there would be
[1:35:46] any higher any greater you understand
[1:35:49] why that Catholic doctor doctrine of
[1:35:51] apostolic succession could never be true
[1:35:53] because you've got a man barred in sand
[1:35:56] saying that he was born in such a way
[1:35:59] that he can be infallible absolutely
[1:36:01] impossible if you believe the doctrine
[1:36:05] of serpent seed at all there's not even
[1:36:07] a prophet that can be born there wasn't
[1:36:09] born understand not a prophet not a
[1:36:12] preacher not a pastor not nobody every
[1:36:15] single one of them were born under this
[1:36:18] sin veil the sin canopy our pedigree
[1:36:21] chases back to how we were born all but
[1:36:24] listen to me there's something that the
[1:36:26] devil could do to Jesus when it was time
[1:36:28] to lose loose his assault on him he
[1:36:31] could hack at him spit on him pulled his
[1:36:33] beard he could even cut his arms and his
[1:36:35] legs off if God would have permitted him
[1:36:36] plucked his eyes that done all manners
[1:36:38] of evil if God would have permitted him
[1:36:40] but there's one thing the devil couldn't
[1:36:41] touch his birth
[1:36:46] hallelujah come on somebody he couldn't
[1:36:49] touch how he was born he was the virgin
[1:36:52] born son of God there was no way you
[1:36:54] could touch that pedigree and if you are
[1:36:56] in Christ and you have been blind again
[1:36:59] you supersede everything that that fell
[1:37:02] in the garden to be utilized by man who
[1:37:04] said that when you received the baptism
[1:37:05] of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:06] he said God takes you across to the
[1:37:08] other side of the chasm you go all the
[1:37:13] way back before Adam if you're a son of
[1:37:16] God watch this now I hallelujah Romans
[1:37:26] chapter 8 verse 28 let's look at
[1:37:31] something for just a moment Romans 8
[1:37:35] verse 28 my preaching that faster you
[1:37:39] listen in that slow which one god bless
[1:37:44] you new fees hard I look out there and
[1:37:46] your hair is blown white back oh good
[1:37:51] that's all right I never hurt nobody yet
[1:37:53] yet yet Romans 8:28 just the devil
[1:37:59] that's all I heard now this is familiar
[1:38:02] to us but I want to I want you to read
[1:38:04] it with me in the context of what we're
[1:38:05] talking about we know that all things
[1:38:08] work together for good to them that love
[1:38:11] God and that's wonderful he doesn't stop
[1:38:14] there to them who are the called
[1:38:17] according to his purpose now notice how
[1:38:22] Paul begins to describe the purpose of
[1:38:25] God verse 4 not for whom he did foreknow
[1:38:28] you say that's the purpose of God full
[1:38:31] knowledge was a part of his purpose
[1:38:33] to know what you would do before you
[1:38:36] done it that was part of his
[1:38:37] foreknowledge oh oh my goodness he also
[1:38:42] did oh there's that word again
[1:38:45] predestinate brother babe said that's a
[1:38:49] bad word to use with an untrained
[1:38:51] congregation and that's right
[1:38:55] because many folks take that word pretty
[1:38:56] yet well glory to God I can live
[1:38:58] anywhere I wanna I'm predestinate
[1:38:59] hallelujah I'm gonna be there always ask
[1:39:01] predestinated to what right to be
[1:39:07] conformed to watch our predestination is
[1:39:09] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:39:14] so the entire purpose of God was he
[1:39:17] wanted us to take on the image of his
[1:39:19] son do you understand this is why that
[1:39:22] we're trying to be like Jesus we are
[1:39:25] trying to be like Jesus because that's
[1:39:27] the entire path
[1:39:29] the entire mystery of God was so that
[1:39:33] you could be like him and he could be
[1:39:34] like you that's why I say friends God's
[1:39:37] mystery had nothing to do with just
[1:39:39] opening seals or sounding trumpets
[1:39:41] that's wonderful but the real mystery
[1:39:44] behind all that was you I'll give you an
[1:39:50] example of what I mean let's let's just
[1:39:52] assume this is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:54] right every name it was ever going to be
[1:39:57] honor this bride members was placed on
[1:39:59] that book before the foundation road you
[1:40:01] believe us right this is the Lamb's Book
[1:40:03] when Adam lost it God put seven seals
[1:40:06] around that book he hid the potential
[1:40:11] and the predestinated value of who you
[1:40:13] were he hid it underneath seven seals
[1:40:16] and underneath them seals everything you
[1:40:20] would ever be was hiding in that book so
[1:40:23] when he brought those seals what was
[1:40:25] really the purpose of breaking those
[1:40:27] seals because of who was hiding
[1:40:29] underneath those seals
[1:40:31] you understand the coming of the Lord is
[1:40:33] not an event the coming of the Lord is
[1:40:35] just another further part of my
[1:40:37] relationship with jesus christ the
[1:40:39] rapture the resurrection is just a
[1:40:41] non-stop part in the personal revelation
[1:40:44] that i have between him and i as well
[1:40:50] the people said well i hope to make the
[1:40:51] rapture Monday
[1:40:52] well I'm not hoping I've got confidence
[1:40:56] that if I can follow him today
[1:40:57] when there ain't no wraps are ahead of
[1:40:59] us if I can follow him right now when
[1:41:01] there ain't no squeeze coming on but I
[1:41:03] can follow him right now when I'm on the
[1:41:04] mountaintop then I've got a pretty much
[1:41:06] cuz I've got a I'm pretty well convinced
[1:41:08] that when things get bad if I can
[1:41:10] following I can follow them do the bad
[1:41:11] stuff too and if I can follow them
[1:41:14] through the bad stuff it might be 500
[1:41:16] years before the rapture resurrection
[1:41:18] please God don't say that's true but I
[1:41:20] might could be a hundred years for all
[1:41:22] we know
[1:41:22] before rapture resurrection but I'm not
[1:41:25] looking for an event as though I would
[1:41:27] miss a party somewhere it's an everyday
[1:41:32] walking with Him and when it comes time
[1:41:35] to go to the rapture that's just another
[1:41:37] step in my walk with whoo glory to God
[1:41:41] now listen Jimmy Enoch walked with God
[1:41:45] and he was not there's been cosmonauts
[1:41:49] there's been astronauts he was the first
[1:41:52] was not
[1:41:58] right he walked with God he had this
[1:42:01] testimony they please God do you
[1:42:06] understand
[1:42:07] Enoch wasn't even looking for a rapture
[1:42:10] when God took him he woke up every
[1:42:14] morning just like he always did read his
[1:42:16] Bible he prayed he focused on the Lord
[1:42:18] God and decided whatever he wants today
[1:42:20] that's what I want his dying of his will
[1:42:23] and his opening up to the will of God
[1:42:25] and God said in hockey I like you so
[1:42:28] much boy I'm not gonna wait all these
[1:42:30] hundreds of hundreds of years to get you
[1:42:31] out of paradise what you just come on
[1:42:32] talk to me for a little while oh hey man
[1:42:37] he wrapped him or he took him or
[1:42:39] raptured him up why because he had a
[1:42:41] testimony that he was pleasing to the
[1:42:43] Lord now look at what Paul said he said
[1:42:45] that he might be the firstborn that he
[1:42:47] might have the headship had the
[1:42:50] preeminence glory to God have a body
[1:42:53] that would be pleasing unto him for whom
[1:43:02] he did foreknow he did predestinate to
[1:43:05] be conformed to the image of his son so
[1:43:08] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:43:11] many brethren moreover he did
[1:43:15] predestinate whom he did then he also
[1:43:17] called and whom he called y'all still
[1:43:21] got jesus' telephone number you got to
[1:43:25] have the right number to call because if
[1:43:26] you don't got the right number you'll

[1:43:30] somebody God give us the divine

[1:44:54] the Lord Jesus will be moving at 1
[1:44:56] billion miles per second hey y'all they
[1:44:58] never made a camera fast enough to catch
[1:45:00] that there's not a crystal there's not

[1:45:06] another kind of net that can catch him

[1:45:11] she's hooked up in the revelation of the
[1:45:12] eye and she's watching she knows what of
[1:45:15] the thought that it might be the
[1:45:21] firstborn among many brethren
[1:45:23] then he predestinated he called and whom
[1:45:27] he called oh I'm so glad I answered the
[1:45:29] phone amen then he also justified and
[1:45:35] whom he justified
[1:45:39] he has also glorified do you know what
[1:45:43] justified really means as though you
[1:45:45] never did it in the first place how can
[1:45:48] you be justified if you've still got a
[1:45:51] pedigree that chases back to your birth
[1:45:52] date you don't have a pet if you're a
[1:45:57] child of God full of the Holy Ghost your
[1:45:59] pedigree don't just chase back to your
[1:46:00] birth date you've got another pedigree
[1:46:03] they tell me that a racehorse
[1:46:05] that you can take it to this pedigree
[1:46:07] line and chase it all the way back to
[1:46:09] its great-great great-great
[1:46:10] great-great-grandfather it can prove
[1:46:11] that it's bloodline is pure that's why
[1:46:14] it's a thoroughbred racing horse move em
[1:46:16] send adoption that's what I love about
[1:46:17] our true Christian they're like a
[1:46:19] thoroughbred racehorse they can prove
[1:46:22] it's fabulous to the foundation of the
[1:46:25] world oh my let's turn on Ephesians
[1:46:32] chapter 1 oh praise the Lamb of God just
[1:46:38] get warmed up to start preaching here
[1:46:39] any minute
[1:46:41] hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus o
[1:46:47] children of God aren't you glad you
[1:46:49] answered the phone I'm so so glad that I
[1:46:55] answered the phone Alyce let's look for
[1:46:57] just a moment now I don't want to take
[1:47:00] your mind to something here for just a
[1:47:01] minute how that Paul makes this from
[1:47:04] Martin at it is you just hold your place
[1:47:06] up let me read you Romans 5:17 18 for by
[1:47:09] one man's offense death reigned by one
[1:47:11] much more they which receive the
[1:47:14] abundance of grace and of the gift of
[1:47:16] righteousness shall reign in life by one
[1:47:19] Jesus Christ their force by the offence
[1:47:22] of one judgment came upon all men to
[1:47:24] condemnation that's you and I and we
[1:47:26] can't escape it we're absolutely born
[1:47:29] into condemnation even so by the
[1:47:33] righteousness of one the free gift came
[1:47:37] upon all men on the justification of
[1:47:39] life now the word did you hear justic
[1:47:40] eight justification means the act of God
[1:47:43] declaring men free from guilt and
[1:47:46] acceptable to him
[1:47:50] you might have had enough guilt to float
[1:47:53] a boat if guilt was like water it might
[1:47:56] have floated it down the river huh
[1:47:58] absolutely you know what I'm talking
[1:48:00] about
[1:48:01] surely you remember when are you as a
[1:48:02] center hmm Dipendra when you was out in
[1:48:05] the world and one more like that you
[1:48:07] weren't looking for God you had no
[1:48:08] interest in God but thank God he was
[1:48:10] looking for you I would just walking
[1:48:13] along minding my own business and I kept
[1:48:15] hearing the phone ring someone huh
[1:48:16] where's that phone coming from thank God
[1:48:19] I found out where it was that notice
[1:48:24] declares you free from guilt how Christ
[1:48:27] Himself brings to you a releasing of
[1:48:32] that first pedigree god oh don't miss
[1:48:35] that he releases you from that first
[1:48:38] birth or that first nature Oh God and he
[1:48:43] actually marries you to this nature of
[1:48:46] Jesus Christ Prince Annette what Peter
[1:48:48] told us he said that we would be
[1:48:50] partakers of the divine nature
[1:48:52] I'm not partaking of your nature you're
[1:48:55] not protecting a mine we're not for
[1:48:56] taking a brother branham Christians
[1:48:58] aren't branham's or Luthor's or Wesley's
[1:49:00] they're children of God their sons and
[1:49:03] daughters of God come on now that
[1:49:06] pedigree has nothing to do with flesh
[1:49:08] what do tell us in st. John one not born
[1:49:10] by the will of flesh not born by blood
[1:49:12] but born by the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:49:18] now I want you to watch this for just a
[1:49:20] moment
[1:49:21] going into Ephesians chapter 1 now
[1:49:24] you'll notice that as Paul begins to
[1:49:27] describe what happens when a Christian
[1:49:30] really hears the voice of God now
[1:49:33] there's a process that a man and a woman
[1:49:37] has to go through in order to really
[1:49:40] receive God's redemption in their heart
[1:49:43] now I'm not preaching just now just
[1:49:45] receiving the Holy Ghost but there's a
[1:49:47] hidden or invisible part that lays down
[1:49:51] inside of much of this that we need to
[1:49:53] look in order to understand it fully
[1:49:55] there is a process but when first a
[1:49:59] person believes God absolutely has faith
[1:50:01] in the Word of God they hear the word of
[1:50:03] God they leave all the worldly and so
[1:50:05] forth like that there's something that
[1:50:07] happens from the time they hear to the
[1:50:10] time they're sealed now what we're
[1:50:12] getting ready to read Paul makes it
[1:50:13] sound like that is just a instantaneous
[1:50:17] thing sometimes it absolutely is
[1:50:20] but if you'll notice I just love how it
[1:50:23] says this let's drop down fusions
[1:50:25] chapter 1 let's just pick it up here at
[1:50:27] verse 13 so much of that we could read
[1:50:31] but just to conserve time now now watch
[1:50:34] in whom ye also trusted now watch these
[1:50:38] little steps after you heard the word of
[1:50:42] truth
[1:50:42] stop right there I want you to stop now
[1:50:46] what happens after a person hears truth
[1:50:50] now think for a moment Jesus tell us
[1:50:53] about it
[1:50:54] he just as Luke 8 mark 4 Matthew 13
[1:50:57] talks about the parable of the seed in
[1:50:58] the sower works his faith expressed by
[1:51:00] them said that the ground was prepared
[1:51:03] or predestinated before the seed could
[1:51:05] fall into it so if they were to bring
[1:51:08] forth 50 fold or a hundredfold ever what
[1:51:10] it was their ground was predestined you
[1:51:13] say but I want to be a five-time it
[1:51:14] person God Mabel to made you one that
[1:51:17] doesn't mean you're less than the body
[1:51:18] of Christ because I've seen somebody
[1:51:21] with one time it'd be a bigger blessing
[1:51:22] than a guy with five
[1:51:25] Berni that reminds you about the woman
[1:51:27] they cleaned out the stable when Dwight
[1:51:28] Moody got saved for his little heart you
[1:51:32] know the story I'm talking about she
[1:51:34] feels led by the holy ghost to have a
[1:51:35] meeting so she goes and rinses stable
[1:51:37] and hires a preacher and she cleans out
[1:51:39] the stable nobody shows up for the
[1:51:41] revival except for one little
[1:51:43] long-haired boy by the name of Dwight
[1:51:44] Moody
[1:51:45] mmmm said he led a million people to
[1:51:46] Jesus Christ for one time and had a
[1:51:49] whole lot more benefit than some of the
[1:51:51] guys sit in the big Cathedral with five
[1:51:53] legs Lord somebody why the ground was
[1:51:57] predestinated to bring forth the way God
[1:52:00] wanted him to break ball you can't help
[1:52:01] but be what you are
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:06] can I say something that's the problem a
[1:52:10] lot of people in this message friends I
[1:52:11] don't mean to sound like a critic I'm
[1:52:13] just making a general honest observation
[1:52:15] that's the problem a lot of folks in
[1:52:17] this message they're not satisfied with
[1:52:18] God made them you can do a whole lot
[1:52:22] better job just being what God made you
[1:52:24] then try to make yourself something that
[1:52:25] you're not there's an old southern
[1:52:27] expression for the bad news you can't be
[1:52:29] nothing you hate you know how y'all drop
[1:52:31] your Aegis we pick them up
[1:52:34] we pick up what the new fad
[1:52:36] Newfoundlands if they drop off that's
[1:52:39] right then Southern's and say you can't
[1:52:40] be not natural hind that's right that's
[1:52:43] right if God makes you be a certain
[1:52:44] thing you cannot break that mold jesus
[1:52:48] said a man cannot to a stature by taking
[1:52:50] thought yes what he is by the grace of
[1:52:52] God that's why certain housewives in the
[1:53:01] message who feel like they should be
[1:53:02] preachers or private clothes closeted
[1:53:06] deacons hey friends we got a lot more
[1:53:08] people in the clouds around this message
[1:53:09] and homosexual we've got closeted
[1:53:11] deacons and closeted pastors and
[1:53:13] closeted trustees and closeted song
[1:53:14] leaders and they do all their work
[1:53:16] behind the scenes you know insanity well
[1:53:19] that man he may he may have the title
[1:53:21] Deacon but sometimes he gets home and
[1:53:23] that little woman explains to him how to
[1:53:24] run the church uh-huh you know what
[1:53:28] you're doing you're not doing what God
[1:53:30] called you to do God called you to put
[1:53:32] one lip on the other and pray and hold
[1:53:34] that man up in prayer not get into men's
[1:53:35] business and run the church whoo thank
[1:53:38] you Jesus don't know where that come
[1:53:39] from but it came anyhow come on now
[1:53:42] you understand what I'm saying to you
[1:53:44] like that preacher one time was
[1:53:46] preaching away and God said this and God
[1:53:48] said that and said in God and God said
[1:53:50] honey I just cannot read your writing
[1:53:52] can you make this more plain as we go
[1:53:59] and whom also after that you heard the
[1:54:03] word of truth after you hear it the word
[1:54:05] falls on that ground if you're not true
[1:54:08] able to take the seed of God it doesn't
[1:54:10] matter how much that man preaches to
[1:54:11] your what he preaches to you he could be
[1:54:13] the most eloquent or he could be the
[1:54:15] worst in the bunch and that's a matter
[1:54:17] how many quotes he quotes are how many
[1:54:19] scriptures he reads or the lack thereof
[1:54:21] it's the ground whether it's gonna be
[1:54:24] able to receive that word or not
[1:54:26] some of the greatest preachers in the
[1:54:28] world because I wish brother Bama
[1:54:29] brother Brad was here he couldn't change
[1:54:31] it
[1:54:31] he couldn't affect you any more than
[1:54:33] what you are right now because the word
[1:54:36] of what you are if it can't be effected
[1:54:38] through me or brother Gerald or some
[1:54:40] other preacher ever how God would called
[1:54:41] me in every who had called where he
[1:54:43] would call him from if you can't effect
[1:54:45] that word in your life coming from a
[1:54:47] nobody like me brother BAM wouldn't help
[1:54:49] you not because it's the same word might
[1:54:51] be the different vessel but it's the
[1:54:53] same word come on church
[1:54:55] it's the same word of God so if you
[1:54:57] can't be affected here you would be
[1:54:58] affected over there people so a lot find
[1:55:01] him and brother Branham was here well
[1:55:03] what are you doing about it now because
[1:55:05] what you are now is what you have been
[1:55:06] down because how you are prepared that
[1:55:09] is who you are like it or not we are who
[1:55:13] we are
[1:55:14] hey I've done exam come to terms a long
[1:55:17] time ago I'm ugly and probably gonna
[1:55:19] remain ugly be quiet Sam I'm not gonna
[1:55:23] let you breathe hurt I have church
[1:55:28] splits over that all the time but watch
[1:55:34] oh I just love the way he says this
[1:55:36] after you heard the word of truth the
[1:55:38] gospel of your salvation and whom also
[1:55:41] her that she believed you were sealed
[1:55:45] with the Holy Spirit of promise okay no
[1:55:48] way you go to matthew samara excuse me
[1:55:50] March 16 he said he that believes his
[1:55:52] baptized to save he that believes not
[1:55:54] his damned
[1:55:54] that doesn't mean simple believing like
[1:55:56] Paul's say in here but brother Bremen
[1:55:58] tells us in March 16 that the believer
[1:56:00] is actually the nature part of that
[1:56:03] person so as he said Jesus said Matthew
[1:56:05] 16 they believe in their baptized he
[1:56:07] said that's because by nature that
[1:56:10] person is a believer he said are you a
[1:56:13] human
[1:56:13] he said yes said the human things follow
[1:56:15] you said yes he says so do these things
[1:56:18] follow a believer because that's what
[1:56:20] they are it's a part of their makeup as
[1:56:22] a Christian they speak with new tongues
[1:56:24] they raise the dead they cast out devils
[1:56:26] if they take up deadly things it doesn't
[1:56:28] harm if they drink deadly things it
[1:56:29] doesn't hurt them that's the nature of
[1:56:32] that person
[1:56:33] but now Paul is saying after you heard
[1:56:38] he indicates to us that somehow there's
[1:56:42] a search that goes on to try out whether
[1:56:45] or not you are truly a believer all
[1:56:48] right now let's go into the invisible
[1:56:49] part of God the sermon goes forth the
[1:56:52] man here's what's being preached he says
[1:56:53] hey man I believe that's the truth God
[1:56:56] does a search at the very moment that he
[1:56:58] believes and he goes back and he
[1:57:00] searches through the pages of the Lamb's
[1:57:02] Book of Life
[1:57:03] and if his name is not tied to that
[1:57:07] title deed then there is no reciprocated
[1:57:10] evidence on the other side you
[1:57:12] understand his evidence his title deed
[1:57:14] says he'll have the Holy Ghost because
[1:57:16] that Holy Ghost is promised to a
[1:57:18] believer so after he hears the word of
[1:57:21] truth this is why that people don't get
[1:57:22] the Holy Ghost when they believe because
[1:57:25] when they believe there's no search that
[1:57:27] goes on are you hearing me when they
[1:57:30] believe there's no search that happens
[1:57:32] but sure they believe God goes back and
[1:57:35] he does a title search is this alright
[1:57:38] gerald lush says he believes right here
[1:57:40] he is on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:57:42] the moment that the title search and his
[1:57:44] name is tied back to that title deed
[1:57:46] then the Holy Ghost reciprocates back to
[1:57:48] him the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:57:50] then he is sealed with the Holy Spirit
[1:57:52] of promise do you understand this is the
[1:57:55] reason why some people can not get the
[1:57:56] Holy Ghost there's no name on the title
[1:57:58] deed they can cry they can scream they
[1:58:02] can holler they can beat at the altar
[1:58:03] they can have 15 people lay their hands
[1:58:06] on them if their name is not on that
[1:58:07] title deed of redemption before the
[1:58:09] foundation of the world no matter what
[1:58:11] they may act like there will be nothing
[1:58:13] that can be reciprocated because the
[1:58:15] Holy Ghost is an inheritance to the
[1:58:17] elect
[1:58:20] I'll never saw that before the Holy
[1:58:23] Ghost is an inheritance to the elect of
[1:58:26] God oh my
[1:58:28] it is my right to receive the baptism of
[1:58:32] the Holy Ghost
[1:58:33] it is my inherited right sure see the
[1:58:38] indwelling us so he ties it back to the
[1:58:43] steed an angel of God with mem said the
[1:58:46] judging angel the marking angel says did
[1:58:48] he hear it
[1:58:48] yes he heard it did he believe it yes he
[1:58:52] believed it all right
[1:58:53] title search now is his name on the book
[1:58:57] no no it's not revenge you just said he
[1:59:02] believed you can believe every day of
[1:59:04] your life and still die and go to hell
[1:59:09] that pinched you a little bit didn't you
[1:59:12] believing ain't gonna get you there we
[1:59:14] are not Baptist that's your cue to say a
[1:59:18] man I'm just giving you a spot we are
[1:59:22] not Baptist we don't believe the moment
[1:59:24] you believe you got it what did Paul say
[1:59:26] there in Acts chapter 19 he said telling
[1:59:28] about the Holy Ghost under a policy I've
[1:59:30] got all this teaching and they said you
[1:59:32] see the Holy Ghost said she believes
[1:59:33] that we'd haven't heard there was a Holy
[1:59:34] Ghost is it how was you baptized if
[1:59:40] probably believing was it then why don't
[1:59:42] you look at them believing Christians
[1:59:43] and say well you got it already
[1:59:44] anybody Jesus is the Son of God don't
[1:59:46] you want to sure we believe that pallas
[1:59:49] taught us that much he taught us that
[1:59:50] the Messiah was come to remember the
[1:59:52] brother M said that when he met that
[1:59:53] group in acts 19 that Apollo's was
[1:59:55] formerly their pastor Paul takes them
[1:59:58] over they become the Ephesian Church
[2:00:00] later how to lose somebody but believing
[2:00:05] was not the criteria well glory to God
[2:00:08] we will have a staring contest or what
[2:00:11] that's up to you you can either say a
[2:00:14] man to what's right or you can hold on
[2:00:15] to that little tradition you got in your
[2:00:16] brain
[2:00:17] believing does not get you there oh I
[2:00:19] believe God sent a prophet the devil
[2:00:22] believes God sent up wrong
[2:00:24] do you realize that the devil believes
[2:00:27] that Jesus is the Son of God he runs the
[2:00:29] Bible said he trembles at such a belief
[2:00:32] but believing ain't gonna get you in the
[2:00:34] rapture
[2:00:34] oh I agree you got to believe unto you
[2:00:38] can't have doubt I agree with you there
[2:00:39] but believing by itself doesn't make a
[2:00:41] title search there's got to be a title
[2:00:44] search it goes on and says is his name
[2:00:45] on the book and he says that in Calamba
[2:00:48] he believes that's time back in there
[2:00:50] yes there he is lady you see in church H
[2:00:52] he's a part of that 3rd 4th generation
[2:00:54] comes along believing that message
[2:00:56] yeah right there he is in the book
[2:00:57] hallelujah send him the Holy Ghost what
[2:01:04] happens if their foolish virgin no title
[2:01:06] deed that's why the door comes up and
[2:01:09] shot they want it with everything
[2:01:12] they've got inside of them but they
[2:01:13] can't get it they have no name on the
[2:01:15] book with no inheritance y'all are
[2:01:20] looking at me like you don't even know
[2:01:21] what I'm talking about I know I'm
[2:01:24] pinching you on that because you said ho
[2:01:26] but we got to believe we got to believe
[2:01:28] but what happens after you believe I'm
[2:01:31] challenged you do not to think on this
[2:01:33] and not you ain't gonna back me up I
[2:01:35] ain't gonna get nervous you quit praise
[2:01:39] the Lord absolutely all you say but if
[2:01:42] they believe the message they can
[2:01:43] believe the message day and night it
[2:01:45] doesn't bring a change unless the Holy
[2:01:48] Ghost comes down and says yes they
[2:01:52] believe it hmm three a man's two eye
[2:01:57] blinks couple head nods do it okay all
[2:02:04] right hang on everybody
[2:02:06] future home a 264 remember Saturday when
[2:02:09] you accept the Holy Ghost is when the
[2:02:11] Holy Ghost accepts you
[2:02:16] how do you know it accepted me he's done
[2:02:18] a title search he's all dude was my
[2:02:21] faith matching the Word of God did my
[2:02:23] faith tie back into this word could he
[2:02:25] go back in there and say yes his name is
[2:02:27] on that title cuz if he couldn't there's
[2:02:29] no way you can receive the baptism the
[2:02:30] Holy Ghost don't you understand
[2:02:32] that's why brother Branham said when
[2:02:33] this book is lifted in the form of the
[2:02:34] bride and she's raptured resurrected out
[2:02:37] of here that they're going having altar
[2:02:38] calls but nobody can get saved why
[2:02:40] there's no more book to be saved with
[2:02:42] you there's no more members that's on
[2:02:45] that book to be safe every name has been
[2:02:48] splashed underneath that coal rock so I
[2:02:50] feel like preaching now oh every name
[2:02:54] has been splashed underneath the crops
[2:02:56] of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:02:58] and there's no he's got to claim on in
[2:03:03] the form of redemption I set it up here
[2:03:08] in grandpa's let me say down here
[2:03:10] there's a difference in being saved and
[2:03:12] being redeemed you step out here on this
[2:03:15] park I'm on tonight and you see a
[2:03:16] cellphone
[2:03:17] say it's brother Gerald cellphone I
[2:03:19] grabbed him brother Gerald you dropped
[2:03:21] your phone brother here here's your
[2:03:23] phone I've saved it
[2:03:24] I kept it we're getting stepped on but
[2:03:26] let's say we walk out there on the
[2:03:27] parking lot I pick it up and say hey Ben
[2:03:30] you dummy
[2:03:31] you lost your cell phone laying on the
[2:03:33] parking lot I didn't save it I redeemed
[2:03:38] it why it belonged to me originally
[2:03:45] being saved is one thing but to be
[2:03:48] redeemed you had to be up there before
[2:03:50] the foundation of the world you had to
[2:03:52] be on that book by the atom before there
[2:03:54] was a speck of Stardust automatic your
[2:03:57] name had to be represented with that
[2:03:59] title deed redemption for the remm said
[2:04:01] the first name it went on it was his own
[2:04:03] the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:04:05] placed his name there
[2:04:06] he said he dipped in this blood he laid
[2:04:08] on them on the pages of the Lamb he said
[2:04:10] he put every name and I put on my oh no
[2:04:14] wonder I got to be baptized in his name
[2:04:15] live in his name walk in his name
[2:04:17] preached in his name cast out devils in
[2:04:20] his name overcome the enemy in the last
[2:04:22] days name with his name before there was
[2:04:27] a world but just my you were sealed with
[2:04:33] that Holy Spirit of promise verse 14
[2:04:35] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[2:04:41] y'all thought there's this good wait
[2:04:45] until we get just a little bit more a
[2:04:46] little bit more a little bit more Oh
[2:04:49] mine too the full downpayment comes this
[2:04:52] is just a little tiny bit of what it is
[2:04:57] and brother if it feels this good now I
[2:04:59] can't wait to see I can't wait to see
[2:05:02] what this full thing is going to be when
[2:05:04] God gives it to us it is the earnest of
[2:05:07] our inheritance on to the redemption of
[2:05:10] the purchased possession let me say
[2:05:13] again who is that purchased possession
[2:05:16] you
[2:05:21] now why can't I get people to see that
[2:05:23] our home the purchase under the prize of
[2:05:27] his lorry that he might have the
[2:05:32] preeminence is amongst the Box he's gone
[2:05:36] oh listen to this and serves we'd see
[2:05:39] Jesus God is the divine healer and all
[2:05:43] that God can do for you he did it in
[2:05:45] Jesus Christ your work of redemption for
[2:05:49] soul and body is already completed what
[2:05:55] good would it do to put me in my soul in
[2:05:58] eternal life into my soul and give me a
[2:06:01] body that dies what good would it do me
[2:06:03] to have eternal life in my heart and not
[2:06:05] have a body that follows so part of my
[2:06:08] redemptive promise in my inheritance is
[2:06:10] he works on soul first then body follows
[2:06:14] lady don't you worry about him gray
[2:06:17] hairs on him stooped shoulders it may
[2:06:19] turn gray or turn loose one of the other
[2:06:21] but don't you worry about it he said
[2:06:22] every hair of your head is numbered why
[2:06:26] he's got it recorded in the title deed
[2:06:28] of redemption come on somebody he's got
[2:06:30] it recorded in that deed what you look
[2:06:32] like but then said God took a picture of
[2:06:34] you before the foundation of the world
[2:06:35] when you were at your best and he stuck
[2:06:37] it in his file so that he could know
[2:06:39] that he could be able to reflect back
[2:06:41] what you were supposed to look like at
[2:06:43] your change
[2:06:48] everybody hang on now this is a 15
[2:06:52] gallon bucket but they're quoting the 10
[2:06:54] gallon bucket y'all don't know gallons
[2:06:55] you know leaders only but brother Mannis
[2:06:58] says even to your rapture is already
[2:07:04] completed I am so glad he did not say V
[2:07:07] rapture because that is an event that I
[2:07:09] may or may not participate in but it
[2:07:12] didn't say the rapture he said your reps
[2:07:15] that's what I'm talking about this is a
[2:07:17] personal extension of my already walk
[2:07:20] with God the same God that brought me
[2:07:23] resurrection in my heart
[2:07:24] amen is the same God all right that's
[2:07:28] gonna bring rapture in my body later on
[2:07:33] it's not just an event all the rapture
[2:07:36] is an event the rapture is an event I
[2:07:38] hear people say that stuff so much I
[2:07:39] feel like I'm signing up for a rally
[2:07:41] somewhere another it's not an event it's
[2:07:45] an extension of my walk with him when
[2:07:49] there's nothing else he can get me down
[2:07:51] here in time he'll say there's only one
[2:07:52] thing else I can give to you
[2:07:54] you've possessed everything listen
[2:07:56] brother brems said that before the
[2:07:57] people of God go out of this world
[2:07:58] they're gonna go out overcoming
[2:08:00] everything that there is to overcome
[2:08:02] listen to me death itself is gonna be
[2:08:05] overcome before we leave here hello
[2:08:08] somebody we are gonna put our foot right
[2:08:12] on the neck of death lower the gun we
[2:08:15] are going to put our right on the
[2:08:18] neck of death before we get out of here
[2:08:23] I'm not waiting to die before overcoming
[2:08:25] death
[2:08:26] I'm already overcoming it
[2:08:29] you said what you're getting stupid
[2:08:30] shoulders your hair is starting to fall
[2:08:32] out here that may be but listen what
[2:08:34] Jesus said st. John 5:24
[2:08:36] he that hears my word and believes on
[2:08:41] him that sent me
[2:08:42] once the title search is done he shall
[2:08:45] not come into the judgment but he has
[2:08:47] passed already past tense he's passed
[2:08:50] from death unto life I am NOT waiting
[2:08:53] for I'm not waiting for that day when we
[2:08:55] all of a sudden becomes sons of God I'm
[2:08:58] not waiting for a squeeze for the power
[2:09:00] of God to be manifested the very thing
[2:09:02] we've been waiting on it's right here
[2:09:04] before our eyes and it's been laying in
[2:09:06] the revelation of the word I'm not
[2:09:07] waiting on 3rd pullback it's already
[2:09:10] here you might disagree with this next
[2:09:15] thing but I don't believe the bride is
[2:09:18] gonna go out of here speaking squirrel's
[2:09:19] I don't believe she's gonna go out of
[2:09:21] here speak in the storms I believe she's
[2:09:24] gonna go out of here an absolute
[2:09:25] possessor of this old enemy that she's
[2:09:28] been packing around this first
[2:09:30] generation birth this first pedigree I'm
[2:09:34] not worried about controlling storms I'm
[2:09:36] worried about controlling the temper and
[2:09:38] impatience and this tongue and these
[2:09:40] thoughts if I can get myself under
[2:09:42] divine control hey hey the prophet of
[2:09:46] God said a man far I surrendered to God
[2:09:48] he is a man that is omnipotent
[2:09:50] [Applause]
[2:09:52] I've said it many times a real key to
[2:09:54] becoming a Christian is let go and let
[2:09:57] God you want to be a real Christian
[2:09:59] that's the only way you can be a real
[2:10:00] Christian let go and let God but we're
[2:10:04] trying to hold on too much you don't
[2:10:06] think so look around some of these
[2:10:08] churches around the message they're
[2:10:10] holding on to everything even preachers
[2:10:11] around this message building
[2:10:12] million-dollar buildings and preaching
[2:10:14] the rapture is just above us there y'all
[2:10:18] didn't shout too loud about 10 but that
[2:10:20] matters truth anyways people talking
[2:10:24] about wanting to get out of here their
[2:10:25] life doesn't prove they want to get out
[2:10:26] of here because they're holding on to
[2:10:28] everything they can hold on but a real
[2:10:30] child of God my brother my sister and
[2:10:33] somebody that wants to let go and let
[2:10:41] the Holy Ghost have total control you
[2:10:46] want third pull power learn how to
[2:10:49] control that nature you were born
[2:10:55] somebody said to me one time we're the
[2:10:58] band that's your problem they said you
[2:11:00] just absolutely believed that the bride
[2:11:02] is gonna be an invincible army I said I
[2:11:04] don't want to believe it I believe I'm
[2:11:06] part of it another fella said to me you
[2:11:10] mean to tell me you think the bride is
[2:11:12] undefeatable I said that's what the
[2:11:13] Prophet said he said smoke emergency she
[2:11:16] can't be defeated I said do you believe
[2:11:18] what Paul said he said I guess I said do
[2:11:21] your don't you said yeah I believe it I
[2:11:22] said then what did Paul say he said not
[2:11:24] famine not peril not sword not
[2:11:27] destruction not the devil not sickness
[2:11:29] not denomination not even your sap can
[2:11:32] separate you amen from the Lamb of God
[2:11:35] that is in Christ Jesus
[2:11:36] nothing can separate you from his life
[2:11:40] [Music]
[2:11:42] Amen if I'm here then I'm not the
[2:11:45] devil's that's simple but that's
[2:11:48] profound
[2:11:49] if I'm hears I'm not the devil's God
[2:11:55] listen to this improving his word God he
[2:11:59] God came down after going through this
[2:12:02] time not human life
[2:12:03] now every son said you eating her born
[2:12:06] of that natural sexual birth the way you
[2:12:08] come when it comes to a place where you
[2:12:12] go through water baptism Holy Ghost
[2:12:13] baptism he said then the Holy Ghost
[2:12:16] comes down at the fire baptism and
[2:12:20] claims this creation the same as it did
[2:12:24] him oh I don't want you missed this he
[2:12:27] said the Holy Ghost and God is the same
[2:12:29] spirit so it comes down and claims this
[2:12:32] body for the resurrection do you realize
[2:12:36] that when you receive the Holy Ghost God
[2:12:38] stakes a claim in you it doesn't matter
[2:12:43] they feed you the lines that stake is on
[2:12:46] the earth it doesn't matter if they drop
[2:12:48] you in the sea if there was any
[2:12:49] believers in that wreck over there in
[2:12:51] Titanic and they're laying underneath
[2:12:52] the ocean there's a stake down at the
[2:12:54] bottom of the ocean with their name on
[2:12:56] it glory to God cut off sematic there's
[2:12:58] no way you can set or no way you can
[2:13:00] tell him app so when it comes time to
[2:13:02] claim all that was resumed that was laid
[2:13:05] in God's mark when it comes time he just
[2:13:07] looks for those claims the devil says
[2:13:10] but I got him they came through that
[2:13:13] sexual Channel you sisters excuse me for
[2:13:15] this I gotta say the way brother I'm
[2:13:16] saying these things but if she come to
[2:13:18] that that first birth that natural
[2:13:20] Channel oh my why you were born off that
[2:13:23] tree of knowledge of good and evil
[2:13:24] and the devil said I've got a claim on
[2:13:26] them but then God turns around and says
[2:13:30] that your claim came after my claim
[2:13:34] [Applause]
[2:13:37] because they're claimed goes all the way
[2:13:41] back before the foundation before you is
[2:13:43] even created I don't know I don't think
[2:13:47] you got that in somebody before the
[2:13:50] devil was even created there was already
[2:13:52] a claim come on somebody
[2:13:54] oh thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord
[2:13:57] that was a claim oh he had claim on your
[2:14:03] life before the devil was even created
[2:14:05] before it could even cause trouble
[2:14:07] there was already a claim so Satan comes
[2:14:13] on says but I got there aided the tree
[2:14:15] of knowledge of good and evil
[2:14:17] he says they might have done it but that
[2:14:18] was just the flesh part there's a part
[2:14:21] that goes beyond that flesh if we could
[2:14:24] get the Church of the Living God to
[2:14:25] understand those two laws you would see
[2:14:28] some overcomers in the body of Christ
[2:14:30] the problem of people in this message
[2:14:32] friends I'll say this is an evangelist
[2:14:35] because I've been around a few places
[2:14:36] every now and then I can tell you this
[2:14:39] the problem a lot of people miss message
[2:14:40] friends is they've got an infallibility
[2:14:42] belief about themselves and nobody they
[2:14:45] can make mistakes and I believe they can
[2:14:46] do anything wrong they believe they're
[2:14:47] infallible every word they say does this
[2:14:50] say the lotus1 they have a you know
[2:14:51] sometimes spiritual whatever it's just
[2:14:54] that's god it's God not every spiritual
[2:14:57] thing that happens is God sometimes the
[2:15:00] devil could give you spiritual things
[2:15:02] hello Church brother I said everything
[2:15:05] that comes spiritually he said you check
[2:15:07] it out with the word of God and make
[2:15:08] sure it fits with the Word of God
[2:15:10] hey man if it doesn't dovetail it didn't
[2:15:13] come from God it came from the devil all
[2:15:16] the way we got to sin that ability
[2:15:17] believe the best of the message see with
[2:15:19] the elite with the elite we're the ones
[2:15:21] that walks on water and speaks squirrels
[2:15:23] and existence glory to God and we can't
[2:15:25] even keep hate out of our heart half the
[2:15:26] time
[2:15:31] hey man we've got this idea that
[2:15:34] everything we do is God no wonder the
[2:15:37] Lord Jesus has to reach over and pull
[2:15:39] the rug out from underneath us sometimes
[2:15:40] just to prove to us we ain't the one in
[2:15:42] charge and brother I want to tell you
[2:15:45] he's gonna keep on pulling the rug out
[2:15:47] from underneath us until we learn who's
[2:15:48] really the boss around this situation
[2:15:50] and I'm here to tell you it ain't me
[2:15:52] they brother branham it ain't Joseph
[2:15:53] Brennaman ain't no other Brennaman over
[2:15:55] nor on and Smith and whatever it's
[2:15:57] Almighty God I think somebody said the
[2:16:03] other day somebody asked them where
[2:16:04] their headquarters was said in heaven
[2:16:08] that's where my headquarters is at hand
[2:16:10] I don't answer to Arizona I don't answer
[2:16:12] to to Indiana I don't answer to some
[2:16:15] other place I answer to him that's why
[2:16:17] it's brother Gerald said I can come in
[2:16:19] here and preach the gospel free we're
[2:16:20] not a denomination we're led by the
[2:16:22] Spirit of God they that are led by the
[2:16:24] Spirit of God they are that sons have
[2:16:26] got man I don't have to check with the
[2:16:30] President or a bishop overseer is it
[2:16:32] okay for me to preach holiness is it
[2:16:34] okay for me to preach about women not
[2:16:35] cutting their hair is okay for me to
[2:16:36] preach okay be rich all I have to do is
[2:16:38] get on my knees for the jobs of Lord
[2:16:39] Jesus is this pleasing to you tonight
[2:16:41] and said yes my son it is and go preach
[2:16:43] it hallelujah I'm not here to please
[2:16:46] nobody but him hey man my mind pleases
[2:16:50] Almighty God well we've got this elitist
[2:16:54] mentality we walk higher than everybody
[2:16:57] else that's why we look down our nose at
[2:16:58] sinners and look down our nose at other
[2:17:00] people because we believe we're higher
[2:17:01] than them last I checked you got two
[2:17:04] arms two legs two eyes hopefully a brain
[2:17:06] like everybody else
[2:17:10] hallelujah
[2:17:12] come on aha there's somebody say preach
[2:17:17] it like that right right you're the same
[2:17:20] as everybody else
[2:17:21] times your birth differ from anybody
[2:17:24] else's birth my granny had an expression
[2:17:27] you put your pants legs on one leg at a
[2:17:31] time like everybody else but I believe
[2:17:36] the Prophet I believe the message I
[2:17:37] believe I believe I believe and by that
[2:17:39] we try to say that somehow God will
[2:17:42] honor our own personal faith just
[2:17:44] because we say we believe really it's
[2:17:47] not when we wouldn't say we believe it
[2:17:49] but it's when God can look down on the
[2:17:51] inside of me and say that Ben he
[2:17:53] genuinely believes every word that I
[2:17:54] said he has confidence in what I said to
[2:17:59] be the truth like a man said one time
[2:18:00] God said so I believe in that settles I
[2:18:03] said brother not to be different but
[2:18:04] whether you believe it or not that
[2:18:05] settles it anyways well he can look at
[2:18:10] me and say he believes he absolutely
[2:18:12] believes with all of his heart that this
[2:18:15] word is right and God comes down with
[2:18:17] fiery baptism and he seals me with a
[2:18:20] holy spirit of promise and what does
[2:18:22] that mean it means he puts his seal
[2:18:24] approval or his a man over my life that
[2:18:28] is my child that is my bride that is my
[2:18:30] wife I a man her life some people in
[2:18:34] church don't believe in a man in the
[2:18:36] very way they got to hold it goes as God
[2:18:37] said a man that's my bride that's my
[2:18:45] child
[2:18:46] Oh glory oh my that's what makes us a
[2:18:51] man it's him a man in through that's
[2:18:55] right oh my listen to this man tells us
[2:19:00] just different places oh so many places
[2:19:02] I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to find
[2:19:04] a place to jump off pick yourself Friday
[2:19:05] but you just looked so many different
[2:19:08] spots that I could just pull in here
[2:19:09] brother I'm talking about we was in the
[2:19:11] chicken yard you don't remember the
[2:19:13] story he said we were egos all along you
[2:19:15] remember you that chicken yard here in
[2:19:17] Mama's voice didn't turn you from a
[2:19:18] chicken poof and you become an eagle he
[2:19:21] was already an eagle
[2:19:22] praise the Lord he was already an eagle
[2:19:25] that's the reason when you heard the
[2:19:26] voice for the Bob you said oh that's
[2:19:27] what I've been looking for that sounds
[2:19:29] like to me now if you've been a chicken
[2:19:31] chicken there would have been no poof
[2:19:32] this is not Benny Hinn this has been
[2:19:34] eagle the hens are for the hens but
[2:19:39] we're talk about Eagle food brother yes
[2:19:42] sir hey the Holy Ghost
[2:19:45] absolutely calls you to be watch you
[2:19:48] were before the foundation of the world
[2:19:49] there is no escaping the fact that if
[2:19:52] you were a member of the body of Christ
[2:19:53] you always was a member of the body of
[2:19:55] Christ how could you change that because
[2:20:00] if you come from God you couldn't have
[2:20:01] been some sinner or something come out
[2:20:03] of God and then turned over into a saint
[2:20:05] there you know sin and God come on
[2:20:07] church if it was God and he was the
[2:20:10] father then every son's gotta be like
[2:20:13] town dog produces a dog and a cat
[2:20:17] produces a cat somebody tell me what God
[2:20:20] produced but mom used this type he
[2:20:30] called it in the science that's good the
[2:20:38] one place he said there a chip off the
[2:20:39] old block
[2:20:47] notice this oh thank you Lord Jesus
[2:20:51] can I go just a bit further yeah god
[2:20:53] bless you thank you so much this is this
[2:20:56] in 2nd in 6 verse 2 he say if I have
[2:21:00] heard thee in a time accepted and the
[2:21:02] day of salvation have us Accord thee
[2:21:04] behold now is the accepted time behold
[2:21:08] now is the day the salvation Galatians 4
[2:21:12] 3 even so we when we were children were
[2:21:14] in bondage under the elements of the
[2:21:17] world but what happened God sent forth
[2:21:20] his son made in the likeness of a woman
[2:21:23] he came in this likeness of sinful flesh
[2:21:25] he took on the cross the real cross so
[2:21:29] that he could take on an old rugged
[2:21:30] rugged cross that by the death of one
[2:21:33] the testimony has no effect of the
[2:21:35] testator's dead
[2:21:36] once he died he goes into the ground
[2:21:38] brother brems said he descends down to
[2:21:40] the regions of the loss he takes the
[2:21:41] keys from hell and death from the devil
[2:21:43] he goes over and empties out paradise
[2:21:45] huh after he goes back up in his sins he
[2:21:48] leads captivity captive remember said he
[2:21:50] has a private resurrection presents
[2:21:51] himself as the Lamb of God the sacrifice
[2:21:53] he comes back down Mary tried to touch
[2:21:56] him said don't touch me I haven't yet
[2:21:57] ascended he said but I go to my father
[2:21:59] and your father
[2:22:00] I go to my god and your God do you
[2:22:05] notice how he laced them together why
[2:22:07] the work of redemption had already been
[2:22:08] completed it was no longer just God
[2:22:11] above us but it was my god and your God
[2:22:13] my father in yah why now we're becoming
[2:22:18] one and members in particular there's
[2:22:20] only one body Luther they might have
[2:22:23] been a different group from us but
[2:22:24] there's still a part of us once they
[2:22:26] might have been a different part but
[2:22:27] there is still a part of us and do I
[2:22:30] even dare mention 1906 in the
[2:22:32] restoration of the gifts some people
[2:22:34] this message pass out when you talk
[2:22:35] about gifts in the first place but
[2:22:38] that's just as much a part of me as any
[2:22:39] other part of Revelation in the Word of
[2:22:41] God somebody said do you believe in
[2:22:43] speaking in tongues I said yes I believe
[2:22:45] God has a tongue so what do you believe
[2:22:50] in the gift of faith I said that's how I
[2:22:51] believe God has faith you believe in the
[2:22:54] gift of wisdom yes I believe God has
[2:22:55] wisdom amen if we yield ourself to the
[2:22:58] things of God we don't just become a
[2:23:00] part of it just one and so in a great
[2:23:01] while but we become absolute conduit say
[2:23:04] man that it can channel his life and his
[2:23:06] power through us my under the rudiments
[2:23:14] of this world look again Luke 17 and the
[2:23:17] day that Noah entered in the ark verse
[2:23:18] 26 through 30 in the days of son of man
[2:23:21] it be the same way they ate they drank
[2:23:22] they married wives gave in marriage huh
[2:23:25] in the days of lot they ate they drank
[2:23:26] they bought they sold they builded they
[2:23:28] planted it what in the world has this
[2:23:30] got to do with the sinful generation
[2:23:31] don't you see they had their minds on
[2:23:33] everything else except for becoming one
[2:23:36] with Jesus Christ there were more
[2:23:38] concern with planting and building and
[2:23:40] this and that the other and to stop and
[2:23:42] to hear the message of Noah crying out
[2:23:43] of the window that Ark out there
[2:23:45] standing on the door saying it's going
[2:23:46] to rain it's going to rain God revealed
[2:23:48] to me it's going to rain
[2:23:49] is gonna flood the entire world and
[2:23:51] those that aren't in this art they're
[2:23:53] gonna embarrass are gonna be destroyed
[2:23:54] get in for the saving of your household
[2:23:56] they said all Noah we've considered
[2:23:58] today but I gotta go finish building my
[2:24:00] house down the road down there I've got
[2:24:02] to go marry somebody yeah I gotta go
[2:24:03] bury somebody you know what Jesus said
[2:24:05] he said a man that would do that and
[2:24:07] turn his face from the cross he said
[2:24:09] he's not even widely to follow me but
[2:24:11] man picks it up in July for the gospel
[2:24:13] and he said a life that is widely the
[2:24:15] gospel is a life without excuses come on
[2:24:19] somebody if we're going to be one with
[2:24:21] God we've got to drop the excuses
[2:24:23] I can't I shouldn't I won't I'm not able
[2:24:26] to listen the Holy Ghost series he said
[2:24:27] that's what the Holy Ghost come to do
[2:24:29] has to take all them cans away from you
[2:24:34] but he become one so that we could
[2:24:37] become one he became intertwined with
[2:24:40] humanity that we could become
[2:24:42] intertwined with the oh thank you Lord
[2:24:47] Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Oh hallelujah
[2:24:54] just a little bit further relevant said
[2:24:57] look these churches these grafted vines
[2:25:00] you can grab citrus fruit you can take
[2:25:02] an orange tree put lemon I'm telling you
[2:25:03] we could go on all night like this
[2:25:04] there's just so many of these places
[2:25:06] lemon and it'll grow man grafted in
[2:25:08] organizations grafted into it he says
[2:25:10] what man done he said slimming all the
[2:25:12] time it'll grow because it's stuck out
[2:25:14] in the church's name he said but let me
[2:25:16] tell you if that tree ever puts forth
[2:25:18] another branch if it was an orange tree
[2:25:20] in the beginning when that branch comes
[2:25:22] forth it would be an orange in the end
[2:25:24] he said into the power of God ever puts
[2:25:27] forth another Church somebody say hey
[2:25:29] man he said it'll be another Pentecost
[2:25:32] write another book of Acts will be wrote
[2:25:36] behind it because it's the Church of God
[2:25:38] why this was the purpose of God that he
[2:25:41] might get preeminence God into Christ
[2:25:43] Christ into the church getting
[2:25:44] preeminence over the whole body I feel
[2:25:46] like speaking in tongues right now talk
[2:25:48] about speaking in tongues I feel like
[2:25:49] changing my language altogether here for
[2:25:51] a little while oh oh take it out
[2:25:54] that he might have one gather at what
[2:25:56] Paul said one of the invisible visible
[2:25:58] Thrones principalities they might
[2:26:00] gathered wild things in Christ Jesus one
[2:26:05] that's why when he takes this Lamb's
[2:26:07] Book of Life and he breaks him seals off
[2:26:10] there
[2:26:10] it wasn't just those on the earth
[2:26:12] rejoicing John but it was those in that
[2:26:15] other dimension looking on there was
[2:26:17] rejoicing why it's time for oneness
[2:26:19] invisible and miserable is coming
[2:26:20] together that's why I don't mind telling
[2:26:23] you mom and dad may have gone on great
[2:26:25] grandma and grandpa might have went on
[2:26:26] but if they died in the faith they're
[2:26:29] only a breath in that other dimension
[2:26:31] it's just a little bit faster than our
[2:26:34] eyes brother mom said there's three
[2:26:36] heavens he said the first ones out here
[2:26:37] that we fly in a plane you know I flew
[2:26:39] into heaven on the way over here your
[2:26:41] first one the second heaven the solar
[2:26:43] system he said that third is that faster
[2:26:45] dimension oh my he said Jesus will pass
[2:26:48] through the clouds when he returns back
[2:26:49] how will he do it he'll be passing so
[2:26:51] fast moving so quickly through the third
[2:26:53] heaven second heaven first heaven that
[2:26:55] the world won't even see him passing oh
[2:26:57] but there'll be an elected bride
[2:26:58] standing on the earth ready with their
[2:27:00] garments you hear the wagon wheels in
[2:27:02] the distance Oh am i the Pentecostal
[2:27:04] Baptist methis will be laughing they'll
[2:27:06] be saying why don't you sit down and
[2:27:07] wait she says I can't
[2:27:08] I might wrinkle my dress I got to keep
[2:27:10] on spotted unwrinkle from the things of
[2:27:12] the world she'll hear the rancher son
[2:27:14] coming in the distance ah and she'll say
[2:27:17] that I told you that promise to get me
[2:27:21] and then it'll be the third showdown
[2:27:24] [Applause]
[2:27:26] listen to me we're gonna go home if
[2:27:29] you're really a child of God you don't
[2:27:31] have to prove yourself because if you're
[2:27:33] really his he'll prove who you are if I
[2:27:38] preach the word of raising the dead and
[2:27:40] God believes his word through me I don't
[2:27:43] have to stand around and say oh you're
[2:27:45] raised the dead it raised the dead when
[2:27:46] it comes time for God to raise the dead
[2:27:47] God will prove his own word is right
[2:27:50] I don't have to get on these websites
[2:27:52] and defend the word and defend the
[2:27:53] message and defend this and defend that
[2:27:55] if God's a God of his word he'll defend
[2:27:57] his own words as a matter of fact it's
[2:28:00] beneath me as a son of God to belittle
[2:28:03] myself down two o'clock and fight with
[2:28:05] the chickens when I should be sailing in
[2:28:07] the heavenlies of God amen he said the
[2:28:09] pants don't Scott I'm full of the real
[2:28:11] you saved you Pentecostal from the top
[2:28:14] of my head to the soles of my feet
[2:28:17] because brother BAM said Pentecost was
[2:28:20] God yo was shot until I said that uh-huh
[2:28:28] you know why we get afraid of that word
[2:28:29] Pentecost but if he never puts forth
[2:28:32] another branch he said in rebel unit the
[2:28:34] visible you in the brightest editor
[2:28:35] bring forth some of them screaming
[2:28:37] shouting tongue speak in acts 2:38
[2:28:38] youngins people only believe in the
[2:28:40] supernatural in the church are waiting
[2:28:42] for brother Branham to put up a tent or
[2:28:43] shoot a brown bear but I'm telling the
[2:28:45] power of God is here right now Jesus
[2:28:47] Christ the same yesterday forever he's

[2:28:53] denomination he's here to quicken the
[2:28:55] bride back to the word that she came
[2:28:57] from in the bag again his whole purpose
[2:29:03] of being here right now why did he
[2:29:05] descend so that he could quicken the
[2:29:07] seeds the seeds in the ground he wants
[2:29:09] to quicken he come down 1963 it was a
[2:29:12] head right didn't Paul say he's a head
[2:29:14] then had no body just a head
[2:29:17] you know what the head was looking for
[2:29:18] rest of his body
[2:29:23] but REM said his searches looking
[2:29:26] longing begging looking for somebody's
[2:29:29] heart that he can make love to I wonder
[2:29:31] are we going to end this search tonight
[2:29:33] are we gonna end this search he's been
[2:29:36] looking since the opening of the seals
[2:29:38] for a body that would become like his
[2:29:40] own glorious spot for a doctrine that we
[2:29:42] become like his own glorious doctrine
[2:29:44] for a faith that would become like his
[2:29:46] own glorious faith pour out for a power
[2:29:48] that we become like his own glorious
[2:29:49] power come on somatic well she could
[2:29:52] have been life with his life let me
[2:29:53] understand it's that back Church hit on

[2:30:04] and the vine you are the branches son
[2:30:06] can do nothing in himself with what he
[2:30:08] sees the father doing why he's energized
[2:30:10] by the main core the roots have the
[2:30:13] power the roots brings it up through the
[2:30:14] body the body produces the branches here
[2:30:16] Amen that's right I don't have the power
[2:30:20] to raise the dead neither to you I don't
[2:30:22] have the power to see visions neither to
[2:30:24] you but if that life of God ever gets
[2:30:26] stirred up inside of me and he wants to
[2:30:28] put me asleep even to show me a vision
[2:30:30] brother been said sometimes they'll
[2:30:31] close my eyes - show me a vision your
[2:30:34] old men will dream dreams and your men

[2:35:47] steadfastly in Apostles doctrine and
[2:35:50] fellowship breaking of bread and prayers
[2:35:52] daily daily fear came upon every soul
[2:35:57] signs and wonders many signs and wonders
[2:35:59] were done by the apostles all that we
[2:36:01] believed were together and had all
[2:36:02] things in common
[2:36:03] sold their possessions Goods part of
[2:36:05] them all men has ever had need and their
[2:36:07] continuing daily daily in one Accord in
[2:36:11] the temple breaking house from brick and
[2:36:13] bread from house to house rather did eat
[2:36:15] their meat with gladness and singleness
[2:36:16] of heart P praising God having favor
[2:36:19] with all the people in the Lord added to
[2:36:20] the church daily such as to be saved
[2:36:22] a man what was it the reason they could
[2:36:24] come into the things of God like their

[2:36:43] and breathe and drink and live and live
[2:36:45] and die by then you don't really have a
[2:36:47] revelation of this message because if
[2:36:49] this message really sinks in your heart

[2:36:52] Nazarene or a Baptists or a Pentecostal
[2:36:55] or a Methos or go back to the world for
[2:36:57] that matter after you drank from the
[2:36:59] clear waters of eternal life turn around

[2:37:37] Acts 541 they departed from the presence
[2:37:40] of the council rejoicing that they were
[2:37:42] kind of worthy to suffer shame in his
[2:37:44] name daily in the temple daily in every
[2:37:47] house they cease not to teach and preach
[2:37:49] Jesus Christ acts 1710 the Brethren

[2:37:53] Berea they came to the theatre of the
[2:37:55] synagogue of the Jews these were more
[2:37:57] noble than those in Thessalonica in that
[2:37:58] they received the word with all
[2:38:00] readiness of mind and searched the
[2:38:02] Scriptures daily whether those things
[2:38:05] were so
[2:38:06] first Thessalonians 2:9 to remember
[2:38:08] brethren are labor in travail laboring

[2:38:35] part of this word listen to me you got

[2:38:44] a more interested in football if you're

[2:39:04] promoters what they think is what they
[2:39:07] consider the measuring tape for
[2:39:08] everything else in the church but
[2:39:10] there's only one standard that we all
[2:39:12] live by a man and whether we're a new
[2:39:14] firm
[2:39:14] whether we're in China or Africa or
[2:39:16] America or everywhere we are the word is
[2:39:18] the standard and if you're not in that
[2:39:20] word daily you will miss him when he
[2:39:22] shows up husband said all he knows that

[2:58:40] prophet God sent a prophet God sent a
[2:58:41] promise that was a nun to nineteen and
[2:58:44] 77 you want to know the significance of
[2:58:46] 77 that's one of the significance and
[2:58:49] that's where that's when that's when the
[2:58:51] begin to get into the hearts and minds
[2:58:53] of the people about why God sent a
[2:58:55] prophet and what he had when he come
[2:58:57] what he did when he came why was that
[2:58:59] again and then the move from the
[2:59:00] messenger to the message right by the
[2:59:03] grace of Almighty God
[2:59:05] and there's anything we heard tonight it
[2:59:08] was the message hey man when you talk
[2:59:10] about a revelation of a mystery there
[2:59:13] are two Aeneas
[2:59:13] the bride will understand with our
[2:59:16] brother Ben preach tonight but I turn
[2:59:19] that just religious people not going to
[2:59:21] understand that oh the bride is going to
[2:59:23] catch it's not for them it's for you
[2:59:27] because this is this kind of preaching
[2:59:29] and this kind of kinky there's going to
[2:59:31] get us out of here
[2:59:32] we gotta believe it we gotta stand on it
[2:59:35] and say that's that's that's not just
[2:59:38] the saying brother band and thus saith
[2:59:40] the Lord a man a man a man god help us
[2:59:43] to recognize God in his ministry hey man
[2:59:47] not just God he William Branham but God
[2:59:50] in the ministry because now a the public
[2:59:53] God said he said Oh someone said in the
[2:59:55] seals will that will the bride ever ever
[2:59:57] ever ministry he said yes he says the
[3:00:00] fivefold ministry exist Minear versus
[3:00:03] the day of Pentecost and it's gonna be
[3:00:05] right there right on to the end God said
[3:00:08] the Prophet but now the ministry has
[3:00:10] taken an eye and brother--he any and you

[3:00:17] ministering the mystery of God tonight
[3:00:19] to us again hallelujah
[3:00:21] there was tremendous rather than a ganda
[3:00:25] the the angle that I which he approached
[3:00:28] the angle a which he brought it out amen
[3:00:31] we heard this we heard that we heard
[3:00:33] this which I said well I believe this I

[3:01:38] there to catch the mind of God and he
[3:01:40] said the father comes down and he expose
[3:01:43] it to the ministry and he said the

[3:01:55] did it should be the same God for the
[3:01:57] word when he went back there it started
[3:02:01] with the mind of God the tops of God I
[3:02:03] say well hallelujah oh praise the Lord a

[3:06:35] thank you Jesus we were in heavenly
[3:06:43] places tonight hey man look for the god
[3:06:46] this reminds me a lot of a quote in
[3:06:48] spoken word is the original seed where
[3:06:51] your prophet said when God told Adam
[3:06:54] replenish and multiply the earth your
[3:06:58] prophet said that Commission that
[3:07:00] uncoming promise was never fulfilled
[3:07:02] because Lord God Eve got deceived the
[3:07:06] serpent got into the womb of a deceived
[3:07:08] woman before her head Adam got there but
[3:07:13] your prophet carried on and said Lord
[3:07:15] that that Commission that he gave Adam
[3:07:18] was an eternal purpose which could not
[3:07:21] fail and in this day we had a prophet
[3:07:24] who said why is Satan howling why is he
[3:07:28] ingredient why does he want to tighten
