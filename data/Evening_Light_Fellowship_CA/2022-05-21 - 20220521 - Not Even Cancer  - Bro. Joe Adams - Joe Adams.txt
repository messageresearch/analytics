brought us to this place this time tonight lord this service and we don't believe that it's by accident we don't believe father is by happenstance but truly lord we believe tonight that this is a predestinated moment and i'm asking father that you would just come and you would take your liberty tonight and you would be the guest speaker lord that you would begin to discern right now father even the very thoughts and intents of the heart lord that you would go particularly to the needs of your people father lord i've shut myself aside this evening and made preparation and prepared but father we're counting on you now lord we're counting on your anointing we're asking lord you would come father lord i have scriptures and quotes and thoughts lined up but god we're not looking to the efforts of a man but we're looking to you to come and put it all together tonight father and speak expressly to us god and minister as you would choose to father tonight we just want to give ourselves freely now to you lord we're not going to be bound by time or we're not going to be bound by different circumstances lord we just want to bind every hindering spirit tonight and just say lord take your liberty tonight move lord there's been a lot of effort put out for these meetings this weekend a lot of coordination father and we just asked it lord don't let those things be in vain but god reward the believers reward the those of the officials orders they put all this effort together lord it's not to see a man but us to lord is to feel your presence and we invite you tonight father we invite your presence to come and lord we invite your holy spirit to just come and move as you would choose to father may we not try to put you in our own little box and we'll put parameters around you tonight but may you just move as you choose to father every heart every life dear god we're just praying that you would minister tonight god we just thank you now we just pray you'll bless the word lord not only the giving of the word but the receiving as well lord for we ask these things tonight in jesus name if you have your bibles and we'll have you stand [Music] i tell you i just love the worship i love the worship in this small church you just feel the impact of the worship and it just feels so wonderful so good uh i feel at home here so i know that i've heard that the newfies like to ask the guest do you like it here do you like it here you think you'll come back well i can honestly say my wife and i fell in love with this place with you you all as a church the beautiful scenery and and look y'all can count bless us later we brought y'all some sunshine for a couple days we brought that all the way from louisiana we know you don't get it very often we get it all the time but we just want to say thank you for making us feel at home here thank you for making us feel comfortable last night being the first night of services a new preacher and a lot of times you just kind of have to break the ice settle the nerves and you guys just kind of made it just worried just you just jump in and start preaching and i just want to say thank you for that made us feel at home and we enjoyed the breakfast with the brothers this morning i want to say thank you for doing that for us and for the sisters taking my wife and doing that for her so it's just been great we it's and this is only the second day we're here for a week praise god so yeah we're excited we're excited but i just wanted you all to know we feel right at home here and you know that's the one thing about it when you're dealing with believers and those of like precious fate there's no little uneasiness and you got to work the little quirks out we're just brothers and sisters and you know we may sound a little bit different brother by shell you he loves my accent he wishes he had it versus his indian accent so i'll be glad to trade places with you but i don't know how that'll work for me in the south but hey we'll figure that one out but uh you know i understand i have a little bit of a southern drawl so if y'all want to talk to me after service be i'll be glad to talk to you i may not have much voice but we're not going to hold you tonight i want to say sister gail we do have this here we will keep this handy as we preach the word tonight and as we end it we'll have prayer over these needs i believe we've already had prayer but we will have prayer once again um and i want to speak to you tonight we're going to pick back up where we left off yesterday evening we spoke on god does impossible math and we also kind of gave it a subtitle of nothing will stand before your prayer and tonight i want to take that a step further not even cancer and we're going to go back we're going to pick up faith one more time as we drop down and there again i don't have any clocks working tonight y'all said hey just take your liberty i'm not prone for preaching more than four hours so you're okay that's a joke and y'all got it so great brother lush is like you preach as long as you want we're going home amen if you take your bibles here we're going to look in first john 5 and verse 13. first john 5 and verse 13. and these things have i written unto you that believe they believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that you have eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the son of god notice now god wants you to know and he wants you to have faith in the name of the son of god and that in that name is where you find eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the son of god and in verse 14 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us now i know if you're like us down in the states there's times that your prayer doesn't seem to go above the ceiling but the bible says we can have confidence that when we ask anything according to his will he hears us he hears your faintest little whisper of a prayer god is mindful of it verse 15 and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have our petitions that we desired of him you can have your seats this evening and i'm just going to go ahead and make myself comfortable we look here in john 15 and verse 7 as well it says if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you may bear fruit so shall you be my disciples as a father has loved me so have i loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full and the message where i think pentecost fell brother madam will tell us he goes he wants us to ask and to believe that our joys would be full what a mighty god that we serve tonight that he wants you to ask of him not only for for him to display his character so that but for that your joy as a child of god as a son of god your joys can be made full because you know that your prayer is not falling on deaf ears but the god that you serve is inclined to your prayer he's inclined to your whisper excuse me he knows what you have need of and the prophet of god said he wants you to ask abundantly who am i he said ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed he says get on out there in some kind of faith move on out for big things that's my kind of god he's saying look don't put parameters on me don't don't put me in a little box don't don't limit what i can do i want you to ask for big things let me tell you how many you got a need tonight i know a god that can meet that need let me put it like this i know a god who will meet that need if you come with the right kind of faith tonight appropriated taking god in his word having confidence in what he said that he will do if you ask anything in my name i'll grant your prayer and we're going to work this thing all the way through in here tonight because we want to make sure we have a balance right see big things is just as easy to receive as little things big things now we're dealing with not even cancer i would assume cancer print a really big thing maybe here in newfoundland y'all got a cure to cancer we don't in louisiana cancer is a big thing but i got a big god and i got big faith in a big god to no matter what i face he's able he's able tonight to meet your need he's able tonight to meet your need he's a god who's never been defeated he's never lost a battle the problem of god said look he goes i've never seen god go into a battle but when he didn't come out packing the victory god sent somebody to newfoundland this weekend for what to come out packing the victory he's got sons and daughters here tonight they're going to leave service tonight packing the victory why because your faith is being elevated not in a man but in the son of man here he is again in flesh proclaiming the same word the same gospel the same healing power the same deliverance the same holy ghost he's the same in every detail except the corporal body that's the god that we serve let me just say it like this sir we are seeing jesus not that we want to sin we are seeing the manifestation we are seeing the supernatural we are seeing the display of the son of man we are seeing god made flesh [Music] then it was a one-man ministry now it's a body ministry same sign same wonder same everything only thing that's different is the corporal body notice of what he says now but things is just big things is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all well that makes it pretty simple doesn't it but sometimes believing is not easy he says he goes and you got faith you just got to know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it right to work and it'll be just fine so that's why i spent all of last night building a foundation on faith and pace myself for this weekend see we got faith we understand that through the preaching of the world last night that each of us here we have faith some of us have higher levels of faith but nevertheless we have faith and the problem of god would say an inspiration he goes he goes you ask for a great thing god wants us to ask for big things my god he don't run out of blessings up there you can't ask too much could you imagine a little fish about this song out in the middle of the ocean's end i better not drink of this water because it might dry up now louisiana we don't have much water you guys got a ton of water out there could you imagine a little fish oh i better drink of this water sparingly it may all dry up he says that's just as it's unreasonable to think that that little fish has to be scared of the water dried up much less a son or daughter of god believing that we can exhaust the inexhaustible fountain there's no way that we can ask too much from god there's no way but what god can't supply your need there's nothing that we can run out of god is here and he's here in his service tonight he's here to meet your need he says well that's just unreasonable as it would be or is reasonable or it's more reasonable to think that god will run out of blessings see all heaven belongs to you a lot of times young people you see your mom and dad or you see the deacon we think wow they got the life or you see the great preacher the well-knowns man they got it made but all of heaven belongs to you not to the man you exalt on a pedestal but to you tonight the same blessings the same god the same promise the same everything belongs to you but notice here in matthew 17 and verse we'll look here in verse 14 tonight when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him saying lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sorrex and of times he followed into the fire and often to the water and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then jesus answered and said or jesus yeah jesus answered and said oh faithful and professed generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour then came the disciples to jesus apart and they said why could not we cast him out and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief these are disciples those that walked with him slept in the same vicinity as he slept in and traveled with him and they sing the supernatural and he says because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of a mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence to your underplace and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you amen sometimes i think we read the stories in the bible and that's all we do is just read well this is just like a newspaper article well that's just great no there's something hidden in that scripture there's somebody that he didn't just put that there just to fill up pages or words on a page but god is telling a body if you can have this kind of faith and the mustard seed is the smallest seed that there is the prophet god will tell us now in the original he says in the original lexicon it says if you should say to this mountain be ye lifted up and thrown into the sea and not doubt in your heart but believe that this is being done you shall have what you say i say it's time time that the bride of christ starts believing what the word says not about the world but about you tonight let's start believing what it says about us there is going to be a bride and she is going to take a body change and there is a bride and god hears our prayer and when she finds herself in affliction we know that god will deliver her out of all of her afflictions but see we sometimes be looking at these things and the prophet of god will say he goes we're looking for things so spontaneous okay here's where we settle down just for a few minutes he goes you look at that mountain see we want that mountain to remove just like that but god don't operate that way all the time he can but he doesn't do it all the time because it's based on faith but he says we're looking for things to be so spontaneous but see what did he mean he says you look at the mountain you say be thou lifted up and thrown into the sea and then in your heart believe that what you have said has taken place maybe just one little grain of sand begins to move you never see the sand because on the back side of the mountain but god sweeps down with the wind and picks up one grain of sand that one grain of sand is an answer to prayer because you asked god moved this mountain from my life and god sweeps down and all of a sudden you don't understand why that door that you hold that you were asking god opened this door for me and that door shut what was god doing god was lifting up a grain of sand because he has something greater for you god knows what he's doing church i've been praying that god moved me out of the hospital system for three years and door after door after door began to be shut but what was god doing god was honoring my faith he was moving one grain after another grain after another grain after another grain and finally the whole mountain moved and i'm no longer there and now i got peace like a river until i got joy like a fountain why because i waited on god to do the work but see we want it spontaneous see that grain begins to move you might not be able to notice it but there's something in your heart says it's being done that's faith you may not see it you may not feel it but something's anchored in your heart it is being done you'll have he says you have what you say see that's the faith many of us are prayed for at night and the next morning say well there's no difference i don't feel any difference he says there's where we are failing notice now that doesn't have to show one thing but if thou believeth in thy heart that what you say is being done you shall have what you say that's it see if you believe that what you say has already taken place and don't have to feel it or see it he goes i believe it that's the reason that it takes place it's because i believe it and that's what we're trying to get you to get to this weekend is to believe it not based on emotion or not based on feeling not based on intellect not based on anything but the word of god it declares that it's yours it's declared that it's for you and this doesn't say that it's going to be instantaneous but it does say it will be done mark 11 23 for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he's saying now let's go into mustard seed i'm not a biologist or a botanist but you know what i got a prophet and he was telling me what to say so i'm just going to say it tonight he said the mustard seed is the smallest among all seed come on if you study the message you know that that's right but there isn't nothing we'll mix with the mustard seed see it's all mustard you can't mix it with kale or nothing to make it grow it's all mustard if you got that much faith all faith not mixed up with something else he said ask what you will and it will be given unto you he says what but it can't be wavering it's got to be genuine mustard faith that's what i'll tell your faith may be the smallest that it could be but as long as it is genuine mustard seed faith based on the word of god it ain't mixing with man's ideas it ain't mixing with psychology it ain't mixing with all these other things that they're trying to do denominationalism it's based on the word of god let me tell you you can hold on brother you can hold on and god will meet that need it may not be tomorrow it may not be next week it may be 10 years but god is moving because mustard seed faith is responding that's what god is looking for we want it spontaneous but god said just have mustard seed faith don't let it mix with unbelief don't let it mix with anything he goes i understand now the angel of god sometimes when a blessing is being pronounced upon you he may not be able to get to you right then well this is big ain't it the angel of god sometimes when he's blessed when a blessing is being pronounced upon you he may not be able to get to you right then it might not be just instant healing but as you believe in your faith he says but as you believe your faith will make you whole your faith will make you whole i expected when i became the cfo of the hospital i mean it was going to be great grand and glorious i was going to have a career careers was i mistaken it was a crash course but god was refining the gift that was on the inside of his servant and i prayed for three years get me out of here change the situation so i got more work i got more work you know we want we want to be perfect right some of you do somebody's like i ain't really worried about it but why would peter why would they tell us about the trial of your faith more precious than gold there's things that we got to look at in the word and we want it to happen overnight but god's like hold up let me refine you let me cut the let me chip away the loose edges or or the sharp edges let me buff on you a little bit and smoothing you up and make you shine for the world to see what god can do in a life what god can do in a fallen humanity what god can take from the from the rubble and lift up and make a son of god look i wasn't always a christian i wasn't i didn't i wasn't born in a christian home i wasn't born in a christian family i didn't go to a church i got saved when i was 21 years old and then tonight i got saved i wanted to commit suicide i tried to pull my car off in a ditch but a voice came down and spoke to me turn your car around i said oh whoa then he said again turn your car around i turned my car around went back home knelt beside the bed i said god if you don't do something with this life i'm gonna take it i don't even have a desire to live but a brother says i can testify to you tonight when i woke up the next morning everything changed god came down because my god had a seed that he placed there not anything that i had to do with it but god planted it there and god was going to get that seed whether i was in church or not in church god was going to bring me to the truth because why because god will always produce a predestinated seed it will come to progression amen mustard seed faith though it hasn't been easy life's not easy sure it's not easy here but it's life but we have the promises of god see now he goes you might want it just instant healing but but as you're a believer your faith will make you oh some people have spontaneous faith great faith deep faith that's a miracle some of them have faith about this deep and it takes a little while some have mustard seed faith very little but just stay with it it will bring you out just stay with it don't give up don't quit there's many times i ask god god are you sure about this lord i really don't want to go to work today this is miserable you can you sure you know what you're doing that's our humanity right but just stay with it stay with it stay with what am i telling you stay with it oh you may not have spontaneous faith to bring a miracle on the scene but that doesn't matter god can still do it but if he doesn't do it he's still he he's not god he doesn't stop being god because he doesn't meet your need according to your desires he's going to meet your need according to his desire according to his plan and he's just taking a seat do you really believe do you have the faith that you claim that you have mustard seed of faith well baby says now some people has great big faith like this anything can happen the next has faith this deep takes a little bit longer next had faith this deep takes a little while some have faith like a mustard seed but see if it's mustard seed fake genuine face hold on to it just keep believing he says now it'll become marble faith and then it'll become grapefruit faith and then it'll become mountain faith if you'll bring it right out until you just just stay with it hold on to it it'll bring you right straight to the light if you'll stay with it mustard see faith growing to marble faith gets a little bit bigger then it becomes grapefruit faith then it becomes mountain faith not only mountain faith but mountain moving faith for whatever things you ask in my name i'll get it he says you know some people has great big faith like that they can be healed in a moment some have faith that much can be healed in a week some have mustard seed faith takes them a long time but just follow it it's genuine it'll bring you to the light just hold on to it and keep moving it'll bring you out you just keep holding on to that faith it'll bring you through if it's real mustard seed you know he says mustard don't mix with nothing he don't care what the other churches are doing he don't care what they're mandating he ain't looking to man he's looking to the word mustard seed faith is rightly divine words and god said i can have this i don't care what i got to go through i don't care how long it's going to take i got it it's anchored it's genuine it ain't mixing he goes you can't mix with kale you can't mix it with spinach and so forth but you he goes you can't mix mustard with nothing it's solid faith though it may be ever so small you plant it it becomes the biggest of all bushes mustard seeds some of you does not need to plant your faith plant your little mustard seed of faith and let it start blossoming quit expecting god to do it overnight say god i'm ready i'm gonna water this faith day after day after day i'm not gonna dig that seed up and say oh how you doing today now i'm gonna plant it in faith and i'm gonna water it with my praise and i'm gonna thank you god and i'm gonna watch it grow and watch it grow and watch it grow in my family and watch get a hold of my children and watch it grow on my job watch it grow here watch it grow in my church why god watch god add to it here and god add to it here see what is it mustard seed faith he says when real faith takes hold in the heart it's not intellectual it's not a reason no more it's real it's the spirit of god witnessing through you god's word is true he goes i stay right with it yes sir and that is what brings the results that is if that's good enough for a prophet it should be good enough for us stay with the word until it produces what it said it'll do you know you think about it brother brandon had a stomach issue for years years he had a stomach issue and then finally toward the end of his ministry did he finally get delivered all these i think it was what 1965 before he finally got delivered on the wings of a snow white dove all his life he prayed for countless people watched him be healed watch them be delivered and yet he's struggling in his own body and yet we want instantaneous faith sometimes god doesn't move like that but god honored his faith he held on and believed that god can heal that one surely god can heal me if god touched that one surely god will touch me and here he is a man of god praying night after night having discernment and spiritual signs and different things taking place and pronouncing this one healed and this one healed and yet sitting there afflicted in his own body but he did not stop believing he kept trusting god not only for himself but for others that he laid hands on god i know you called me for this moment god i know that i'm an ordained prophet and here i am on the scene for this moment to do what to call out a pride or call out and elect to call out a people for your name's sake [Music] we looked at ephesians 3 we'll look at it again tonight it says now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think according to the power that worketh within us notice now this word exceeding abundantly means more than is necessary hallelujah god can do more than is necessary brother mark you got way more kids he can do more than necessary just got to believe it's got to believe let me tell you god's arm's not short that it can't reach down and his ear is not deaf or heavy that he can't hear the faintest prayer gotta meet you we've seen it church i'm telling you i'm going to share some testimonies toward him but i've seen the supernatural move i've seen god display himself and manifest since not only in my own ministry but in other ministries we've seen god you can't tell me there's not a god you can't tell me that this message is not right you can't tell me that god doesn't still produce signs and wonders you can't tell me that we're not seeing the days of christ he's here again so this word exceeding abundant means supremely much more than all extraordinary surprising uncommon more imminent more remarkable more excellent oh church i want you to know today god will do he will exceed your greatest expectations whatever you can fathom in your mind god can exceed that tonight whatever you can come up and speak out of your mouth god can do exceeded abundantly above all that you can even think tonight i say light your faith luke to believe lord i believe you tonight i believe you for my family i believe you for my healing i believe you for my children i believe you for salvation i believe you for the holy ghost god i believe you tonight i'm letting my faith loose tonight god nothing will stand before the believer's prayer not even cancer [Applause] god can do more than what is necessary i like the more you know it's one thing to have this cup here and it's feel pretty good right what if you just keep adding to it keep adding to it and uh-huh i'm not god i don't want to make a mess but if we just keep patting to it and god says keep on filling up i can do more than that's necessary all your knees in the cuff but i'll keep filling up till it overflows because that's the god that we serve now here this is what we're going to come to this is our our keynote scripture or not scripture but quote tonight he said there was an angel came down into a room and he told me way back back before i was born there was for excuse me before dane to have a gift of divine healing and he came and he told me in a room one night that god has sent a gift and it was the gift of divine healing for the people notice who it's for it wasn't for the prophet it wasn't for the ministry it was for the people the gift of divine healing was for you for i is for us the people he said it was for the people and he goes and if i could get you to believe me he says believe me now he says and would be sincere when i prayed that nothing would stand before the prayer i said therefore speaking face to face with the supernatural being i believe it with all my heart and if i can get you to believe me with all your heart he said that's what moves god and then you're healed see your faith has saved you you see what i mean your faith to believe has saved you not what you worked up to a thought in your mind but what you really know the very evidence of things not seen see i don't believe this quote is just for physical healing but i believe god sent a prophet and that prophet was to break that word out to a people a people that was a special class of people that was going to believe this message and not only was it for healing but it's a it's a message or it's a quote it's to help us understand how do we get things from god how do we approach god how do we address ourselves as ministry and as believers see i don't believe it's just for physical healing but i believe it's whatsoever things we have need of if we can believe it nothing will stand before the prayer amen nothing will stand before the prayer see your belief in god's word as it pertains to you not me as a man because if you don't know how to rightly divide the word i can be feeding you a bunch of hogwash and you're just gumming it down but no but as you rightly divide the word as it pertains to you god will respond to your faith that's why we all have to be students of the message we have to be students of the word so we know what is being preached lines up with the prophet of god because it's not a prophet's message it's god's message that he sent down through a prophet and it's the message for the people to get a body ready for a rapture see you got to believe look otherwise we find here your belief in god's word as it pertains to you is what will move god to respond to your need amen see your faith pulls god to your need think about the woman at the well she had not the woman at the well but the one with the bloody she her faith told her if she could just touch to him of his garment she was forbidden to come into the city because she had a blood issue she was not allowed but there was something anchored in her heart when she heard that he was passing by he was coming through the streets let me tell you there wasn't enough crowd there wasn't enough criticism there wasn't enough laws in the land that was going to keep her from receiving what she had need of something anchored out on her face anchored down and she had to fight her way through the crowd she had to fight her way through the shame she had to fight her way through the embarrassment but when she got to him something left him and came into her virtue left him why was it because she had faith that if i could just touch him not only him but just to him of his garment i know i'll be made whole and if i can get you to believe that much tonight that if you can just touch to him of christ's garment tonight you could just feel his presence in this church then you would get your need man you may have to fight your way through a little bit of unbelief you may have to fight your way through the crowd tonight let me tell you church fights your way through he's there he's passing by he's coming through newborn this weekend what to minister to your need oh he's asking look your faith in what he will do will pull the very virtues out of this word and bring you healing and bring you deliverance and bring you to your knees and you'll see god manifest himself but you got to believe what the word says about you i understand we don't believe in being selfish do we but tonight is a night to be selfish i want it for me i want it for me god if you don't move on anybody i want it to me for me god i want to be self i want all that you have for me god i'll tell you what i want all that you got for my neighbor but you got to believe that it's for you psalms 34 and verse 17. i'm just taking my time tonight not sure where we're gonna go in the morning but we'll figure that out in the morning psalms 34 and verse 17 the righteous cry and the lord heareth the righteous cry they cry out to god they pray and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles see the lord is not unto them that are of a broken heart and he saveth such that of a contrite spirit see the bible says in verse 19 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all many are the afflictions nowhere does it say that there's one thing that you're not able to overcome it doesn't say that there's one thing that's so much bigger than god that god's not able to deliver and if you fall into that trap you just own your own no it says many are the afflictions of the righteous i mean you're righteous tonight then you can have the assurance that god will deliver him out of them all whatever you're going through man whatever the affliction may be today you've got a promise that god won't leave you there but god will deliver you from that position and from that place and god will establish you on the word of god and your faith will be increased now this word affliction here means malignant unpleasant evil unhappy misery and i'm sure that many of us can attest we've had some very miserable days lord knows i have but it means malignant and that word malignant means tending to produce death and when we think of malignant we think of malignant sea we think of cancer we think of a threat to human life we think of death yeah so god said brother madam says in the message redemption in completeness he says when you get the holy ghost you attend to a lot of obstacles man you're thinking man i got the holy ghost now it's going to be a flowery bit of ease no buddy all the guns are hell appointed on you but he says many are the afflictions of the righteous but god delivereth him out of them all god brings you right up facing with it so he can show you his power and goodness see god brings you right up facing with the trial with the affliction with whatever you're going through just so he can show you his power and his goodness sometimes we think it's all about us come on i know you're sub-human here or more than human not so but pro so whatever the word is you know sometimes we think man we are just better than anything else in the world i used to think that about myself i got humble real quick you don't have to aim in that no no no you don't well unless you talk about yourself but see we as a believer have a promise so no matter whatever we're facing god will deliver but you got to have faith you got to have mustard seed faith to hold on to the end amen see he'll not let one thing destroy you he'll not let one thing no matter what the affliction is that you're facing whether it be a physical affliction a mental affliction a financial affliction a spiritual affection god will deliver because that's his word see god's not obligated to anything but his word god is obligated god has to respond and god has to keep his word in order to be god and if he said many are the afflictions of the righteous god's not going to let the righteous die in their affliction he's going to raise him up out of it because that's god's word we will not be overcome by the affliction we will not be overcome by the malignancy you say well brother joe many people died i mean people died with cancer yeah the bible says as we read last night in hebrews they died in faith they all died in faith but the thing was they saw the promise of god they embraced the promise of god my father-in-law had a lung condition in his in his life and he fought for every breath and every day he would say i'm healed by the grace of god i'm healed by the grace of god and he would fight for breath and fight for breath and fight for breath and when he took his last breath he wasn't he god the devil didn't get the victory over his life no god transported him he took him home and gave a new set of lungs well he died in faith believing that god was still his healer and once you recant that god didn't do it that's when the devil wins but the devil never wins with a real son and daughter of god because they're believing to the end if it means you take your last breath here your last breath here is your first breath in eternity brother sister let me tell you talking about a new body you talking about a healing you talking about a deliverance i'm talking about a supernatural explosion you're talking on streets made with gold ain't no more symptoms ain't no more trout ain't no more afflictions in why you've been transported to your real body you didn't die god didn't lose you that affliction didn't overcome you no god just change your dwelling place [Applause] [Music] but we got to quit thinking about all of it on the cardinals well they died no a believer doesn't die a christian doesn't die no you hold on to that testimony god is my savior god is my healer he says where in first peter 1 and verse 6 wearing greatly rejoiced though now for a season if need be you're in the heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes don't be tried with fire might be found unto the praise and honor and the glory of the appearing of jesus christ now the trial of your faith how many of you likes trials oh about had somebody put their hand up i saw them oh no psych i know what that is right or y'all say yeet here is that how y'all do that y'all you got something on there man we just move on but we find nobody raises their hands pick me god for a trial but god picks you anyway and he brings you up facing with it so he can show you his power and his goodness to you so let's look we're talking about cancer tonight so we're going to dive in here on cancer and look what the prophet of god will say about that because we're going to tie all this in nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer but all hinges on faith and that's why i'm preaching to your faith i don't have another ministry this is all i got is faith and i love god with all my heart i know what he's done for me and i've seen the supernatural and i'm here to declare he's a living god for your need tonight and if you've got a need tonight i'm here to tell you gotta meet that need if you come and you appropriate the right kind of faith he says now a cancer in the natural realms would be a scavenger a buzzard eats dead things a cancer comes from a bruise a bruised cell usually is where it comes from the cell is bruised all mashed up the cell is backslidden if something happens in there that fails to get the function of the blood to it right he says and through their satan the author of death which god is the author of life satan the author of death puts a demon in there called the devil a demon called cancer and cancer is not his name medical science just gives it that name he said the word cancer comes from the word craft and then it means with little legs and things and it runs out he says and like other diseases they're given medical terms he said then that little cancer comes in there first it's a spirit he says then it gets into a backslidden cell or a bruise cell and that cell he goes he goes a brew cell or a cell that's not operating right so i want to flip this just for a minute that's the natural what about the spiritual okay so the cancer comes first it comes as a spirit or a demon that attaches itself to a bruised cell see and if we're not careful maybe somebody in our church somebody here somebody somewhere else can get a cancerous spirit in their spirit see for instance you take a person who gets hurt somebody says something they get offended they get wounded satan is going to try to attach a spirit to that bruise to that hurt and then all of a sudden a complex grows from that and all of a sudden that person begins to pull back and all of a sudden that person begins to pull away all of a sudden you start seeing little commotions that happen in the church you need a quote don't you i got you one don't worry here you go he goes now that's what happens in church when he gets someone failing to operate with the church someone failing and pulling off and getting indifferent that's a cancer in the church it's a devil in that person that's right and that causes the whole church to be sick he said the best thing to do is have a spiritual operation now when somebody one of our friends gets cancer we don't throw our friend aside do we we begin to pray for him so when somebody gets cancer in the church we don't cast them aside we begin to pray god perform a spiritual operation take this thing out of their life take this thing out of their heart god that's a brother that's a sister they're wounded and this spirit this this cancer spirit has attached itself and now they fail to operate in tune with the church he says but this little cell backslid the cancer come in there for back on the natural and the cancer then it lays and then the first it's the spirit then in the form it forms teeny little cells of its own notice it begins to take on its own life and this little cell becomes first he goes i couldn't call the big words for it but the first form of life is a cancer it's painless he said no one knows that it's happening take somebody who has cancer they don't know that it's happening until those little cells become big enough cells to where it makes a lump or it makes a mass or it does something they don't know what's going on but all the time it could be months it could be years over a time frame and yet this spirit began or this cancer begins to form its own life and that same thing happens in the spiritual aspect as well see a spear can come into that bruised cell a little tiny cell begins to form a little cell then you find you got a complex and that complex begins to look at everything wrong with everybody begins to look at everything wrong with the church begins to look at everything wrong with the ministry and all of a sudden that little cancer cannot receive from the word but the first stage is it's painless it's just a spirit they don't even know that they got it but over time it begins to develop and it begins to respond and it begins to act out and it begins to manifest itself amen now this little cell is born brother says this is god's provided way of healing he says now this little cell is born it must feed so in order to feed it has to feed on your bloodstream just like you fed on the bloodstream when you was in your mother's womb you fed on the substance that she ate and so forth and so does cancer feed on the substance of your body it's one little cell then it grows it begins to feed and another cell breaks out and another cell breaks out and another cell breaks out and after a while is cell on cell tumor cataract whatever it may be grows bigger bigger bigger bigger larger spreading out more sales more sales more sales he says in the first thing you know it begins to zap so much blood till the young lady begins to feel sick he says what is it it's poison it's death it runs into every little fiber of your body that it came down into the tissue stretching its legs down weeding out like the roots of retreat going all around rapping through the intestines and up through the spine and the doctor comes along and he opens them up he says nothing can be done the man to the best of his knowledge saying everything that he knows see there it is he's so the patient back up it's finished there's nothing that can be done you take the person all apart he goes but you couldn't find it anywhere couldn't find it all anywhere there it is the patient is hopelessly helplessly gone as far as a doctor is concerned there's nothing more that they can do nothing more but god said not even cancer not even cancer the doctors may not be able to get it all with a great physician let him perform the procedure let him perform the surgery so we find now when he told them if you can get the people to believe you and you be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer so we find here in first corinthians 5 and verse 7 the bible will tell us purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feasts not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth amen now notice that word purge means to cleanse thoroughly cleanse thoroughly if we're gonna keep the feasts with the with the new leaven and be a new lump then we gotta we gotta make sure that our worship is pure our worship is free from malice and that word malice means malignancy free from a cancer spirit free from jealousy free from grudges free from complexes free from wickedness toward another see the bible would tell us let let us lay aside every weight and run the race that is set before us lay it all aside let every weight every sin that so easily besets us and the weight there means encumbrance anything that's going to hinder you from performing your best put it aside and run this race if you've got a complex put it aside and run this race if you're holding on to something that somebody said to you and you just won't let it go you've got to forgive in order that you can be forgiven put it aside and run the race if you want to be healed you want to be delivered you got to put those things aside and you got to be thoroughly cleansed we got to purge out the old leaven and we don't want the old leaven mixed in our worship we want pure worship we want godly worship we want an anointed worship and what am i telling you church when they slayed the lamb in the exodus what did they do they had to eat the lamb but they ate the lamb with the with the unleavened bread of spirituality and truth while god was showing the two together he was going to show you i am the bread of life that comes down from god out of heaven and don't you mix my word with some man's idea make the word pure keep the word that's what we're fighting for in this hour is to have a pure word a true word a word that'll change your body a word that'll change your life a word that'll heal you when you're sick or whether that'll save your life or we're going to go after your young people but we cannot allow leaven to mix in with our worship the word leaven here it means it's a species of corruption being produced by fermentation which in such cases tends to putrefication we don't want leaven in our worship if we had leaven in our worship would be no more than a denomination being manhandled do this do this have everything scripted you know when you're going to do this you know when you're going to do that they give you a flyer it's a no we don't want that we want pure unleavened worship and they said they had to eat the leaven with bitter herbs and this was designed to put them in mind of their bitter in in severe bondage that they were had in egypt i believe we're eating on those bitter herbs now god is telling you don't get used to this place don't get used to this place you see the gay pride you see the lbgtq you see all these movements this ain't just canada this ain't just united states it's a worldwide sweet because while satan is preparing his eating he's saying don't get used to his eating i got you another eating i'm taking you back i'm telling i brought you out of that i brought you out so i can take you in church don't settle for what you're looking around here well this is all that life was going to be i'm just a new fee no you're not just a new fan you're the bride of jesus christ and all things are possible if i can get you to believe tonight amen see no christians can have or give evidence of sincerity and not be willing to put away all sin no christian can have malice an ill will toward their brother or sister and claim to have sincerity and be come into the house of god and worship with a pure heart we can't wish to get even with one another or with another one and claim to oh raise our hands and we're super spiritual not if you're really sincere you'll make that thing right before you come into the house of god before you put your gift at the altar you're gonna make it right see we were told to purge out that leaven purge out the fermentation which leads to putrification purge it out we want our worship to be pure we want our hearts to be pure we want our homes to be pure watch what you allow into your home purge it all out and let me say this if we plan on witnessing miracles if we plan on witnessing healings we must keep anything from hindering the sincerity of our worship even in such a small church as this keep it protect the pulpit watch what's coming over this desk we want pure anointed word amen whether it be an evangelist whether it be a teacher whether it be a pastor whether it be whatever it may be it's got to be pure and it's got to be anointed see we must allow the holy spirit to move as he chooses and that's what we want to do tonight we won't allow the holy spirit to move as he chooses to move in this service i didn't come here tonight with a pre-prescribed motion or idea of what the service is going to do i'm saying god you move how you choose to but i can tell you one thing when i was before we left brother john's house things began to swirl in that downstairs basement and i began to feel something god's going to do something supernatural tonight i told my wife i said i'm feeling something i said i don't know what it is but i believe god is going to do something special god is going to move in a special way tonight oh church why am i not just telling you this just to fill a bunch of time i'm telling you this to get you in the right atmosphere so that you can believe so that all things will be possible for you to believe tonight god can only do for you as you already confess that he's done it god must be we got to let god be willing to move in each and every heart as he chooses amen we want god to move we have too many men today manhandling to worship shutting down on the anointing of the holy spirit and we find their churches are sitting dead i'm not going to go into all this because that's not what we're here for tonight but if we're planning on taking a body change we got to let the one that can change the body move in this local body he's got to be able to change right here tonight change our ideas change our views change our perspective change what we're looking at change how we're looking at it look at the word with spirituality look at the word with the unleavened bread not mixed with any man look we can't mix our own unbelief with it and expect to receive from god we can't mix our own ideas and expect to receive from god we can't interject psychology and expect to receive from god we can't put programs and ideas and self-help this and that into this message and expect to receive from god no matter what you're facing you got to face it with the the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth that you know that you met god's requirement and god has hand picked you for it and god's gonna bring you through it so no matter what it looks like we gotta purge out the old leaven and keep the feasts keep the worship keep the worship with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth now abraham we know the story of abraham i'm just going to go somewhere we'll come back but we're going to look at abraham just for a minute abraham was expected to believe something has never been done he was given a promise and abraham had faith he had faith to believe it was going to be in eight months he had faith in believing that something was going to happen the next day that she was going to feel different he had faith 25 years later that god was still going to bring the promise to pass he had faith when even hagar sarah gave him hate guards to bring forth the promise but god said it's not hagar that i'm going to bring it through i'm going to bring it through sarah and then when sarah judged him faithful when sarah saw herself in the promise when she saw that god not only anointed abraham because look sarah was tied to abraham and in one place brother branham said that sarah laughed in herself she laughed within herself and he said god should have struck her dead right there but god couldn't strike her because she was part of abraham she was part of the promise let me tell you in your unbelief should god should have struck you down but god can't strike you down god can't why because you're a part of the promise you're connected with christ let me tell you faith you had that revelation tonight and it really dropped down in your heart let me tell you there'd be no trial that you would face that would overcome you because you know i'm tied to the promise no matter what i gotta go through no matter how long it takes i'm tied to the promise god you should have struck me down but you can't strike me because i'm tired to the word we're gonna bring forth the promised son god's gonna have a bride she's gonna be without spot she's going to be without rico she's going to be without blemish she's going to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh power of his power life of his life she is going to be the very manifestation she is him oh believe that tonight what is god doing he's getting the bride ready [Music] they said abraham was not weak in faith this bride ain't weak in faith hope that we've heard about it by a rapture though we heard about it abraham's body was now dead sarah's womb was dead yet the bible says he staggered not at the promises of god but he stood strong in faith giving glory to god being fully persuaded that what he promised he was able to do notice the bible tells us man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that perceives that a mouth of god see abraham wasn't living just on natural substance alone he was living on the promise of god god you gave me a promise and i know no matter how bad i get how decrepit i get how sore i get how tired i get how old i get how wrinkled i get i'm gonna have that son because you gave me the promise and not only that when he that son was born and god said take your son isaac and i want you to go off from up on that mountain god know he said god if you was able to give me one from the dead then you can raise him back up from the dead why he said the lad and i are going to worship and the lad and i are going to return that's the kind of faith that we got to have god you brought me to this trial i don't know how i'm going to get through it i don't know how i'm going to get over it but i know one thing god you're going to bring me through it because your word declares that you'll not put too much on me but what i'm able to bear so no matter what he faced how sick he got how old sarah got how crabby she got she got crabby i know you sisters don't want to hear that she did so she was in no mood to enter entertained those angels when they came by that day he was all out of sorts i took that as crabby that's the southern interpretation of all out of sorts i know y'all don't get like out here you're not southern you all get all out of sorts we get crabby but see abraham didn't struggle at the promise he believed the word of god oh if i can just get you to believe the word that's what i'm trying to do he believed the word though he didn't see it though he didn't feel it he made preparations for it 25 years later sarah how do you feel honey yeah i'm feeling okay oh but one day man three men come walking in one day he met the angel himself abraham i'm gonna have dinner with you where's your wife sarah called her by name tied her to the promise i'm telling you sir if i can get you to believe right now you judge him faithful got to produce that promised son got to produce that prayer request got to produce that child you're looking for got to do it see he trusted god and god gave the promise and god was able to manifest the promise he didn't struggle with the promise of god he didn't struggle though he was old he didn't struggle because when he looked at sarah and she was all wrinkled no he staggered not at the promise of god and god was hiding in abraham and sarah's life what he was going to do with the bride body in the end time what was he saying he's going to change our bodies back though it looks impossible get ready for the change god's going to do the supernatural see abraham didn't look at his old age he didn't look at these things he looked at the promise and brother man says no matter what it looks like we don't look at what we see we look at what we do not see is that right see the word seed doesn't mean he says that to see doesn't mean to look at the word c means to understand you have to accept it by faith and then when he comes into you you understand amen you accept healing the same way stay right with it not what you look at but what you believe what you understand to be the truth it says what you're looking at the unseen then stay with it amen all right now so he says it lays in your faith it lays in your faith let me just share a quote that i was listening to before i came to service tonight brother graham says come reverently sister believing nothing is impossible with god this is obama gilead in 1959. father as she holds the word of life in her hand may it become real to her for her desire in jesus name notice may she come reverently but he says this at the end this is what i wanted to say if you believe it with all your heart raise your hand in the commission of the holy spirit by the word of the living god i pronounce every one of you healed according to your faith see god's word says he's a healer by my stripes you are already healed so if you want healing tonight then you've got to appropriate the faith to produce the healing and some of you have mustard seed some of you have grapefruit faith marble faith some of you have mountain faith but you all have faith so just hang on to it until it manifests he said now that sickness this is in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in 1952 he said that sickness whatever you have if that is pulling on you you see it's going to try to put everything in your mind to keep you from believing that this is the truth he says this which is coming now me speaking to you is trying to get you to believe that it is the truth he says now here that's the warfare see satan's put in your mind it's not for you oh the pain the symptom the situation this that and the other but that's why we preach faith because i'm trying to get you he says me speaking to you now is trying to get you to believe that it is the truth he says that's the warfare he says if you'll believe it he said then this here the holy spirit will pronounce the blessing satan has to leave it has to be amen he said but brother it will take your faith to heal you so why did god allow a prophet to come and do all the supernatural this sign that sign this sign that sign prophet god will tell the main purpose that god is doing this is to try to get you to believe his son jesus christ died raised from the dead and is living among us tonight the same as he was standing there visible like you and me he and some of these other people are now he goes don't make any difference whether you have a prayer card the only thing i'm trying to do is to get you to believe the lord jesus christ and he will heal you you don't have to have a prayer card if you notice there's more healed out in the audience than there is that comes to the platform and here so we want to find we're going to come back to our our screen or our quote tonight the angel told me if you can get the people to believe you notice what he says not believe me as a man but believe the message i'm telling you don't believe me as a man because as a man i can fail you because as a man i will fail you because as a man i will i do have failures i'm not perfect but believe the message that i'm telling you see brother baby will say now listen to the order of it he says ministers especially so he's telling the ministers now he's trying to tell us how do we approach god to get our healing he says minister's expression now here it is now listen close if you get the people to believe you he said and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before your prayer see how we put it all on a prophet because we take that first quote in 1947 where the angel lord told him if you can get the people to believe you believe you you know and he says you know and be sincere when you pray nothing will stand before the prayer but here we find in 50 he's a few years later the prophet of god comes back and he's telling us as ministers he's telling us as believers this is how you get your needs met from god you got to believe as a congregation my responsibility is to preach to you a level of faith to bring your faith up to believe the promise and to be sincere when i pray and then nothing will stand before your prayer amen see that's why we preach faith that's why i'm trying to get you to believe that's why we preach a living god we don't preach a dead god we don't preach a god of psychology we don't preach a god of circumstances we preach a living god that you can take him out of your little box that you put him in and watch that god move watch that god work watch that god have a motion if he wants to be emotional we let that god move with emotion if we want to sit there and god wants to be somber and he wants to be solemn we will accept god in that motion too we don't put limits on god we let god move as he chooses to move god can still do the miraculous notice that's why we preach we preach both the mechanics which is the word but we don't only preach the word because the bible says the letter killeth but the spirit gives the life so we preach the mechanics and the dynamics of the word what good is just having the mechanics what good is having a nice ferrari sitting outside if it ain't got no juice it ain't got no spark it's just all pretty look i ain't looking for pretty i'm looking to get down the road i'm not worried about how my worship looks i just want to get down the road how would i worship a living god it may be ugly but it don't matter he loves my worship glory it's got fire in it it's taking us somewhere we're moving beyond the humanity we're moving beyond our own self-made ideas and we're moving up into a level we're moving up to an atmosphere of faith where all things are possible notice that's why we preached a living god we preach a god that honors our faith individually to see miracles to see healing to see deliverance to see a god personal see god that's what he wants he wants to be personal to each and every one of you not just for your pastor not just for the ministers not just for the deacons and the song people and and all that god wants to be personal to you to you young people god wants a personal relationship that god can take a young girl and keep her and keep her pure keep her virtuous keep her in a modest look and keep her free from the world keep her from the scars of life god can do that but it starts with an atmosphere that's why we come to create an atmosphere we don't come and we just shut down on the ministry no we come we have a part to play god help me do my part help me create an atmosphere that lies can be changed notice now why why did the angel identify cancer see cancer was one of the greatest threats to the human life if not the greatest threat in the early 1900s up until the 19 mid 1940s see it wasn't until the mid 1940s or late 1940s the medical science began treating cancer and their first forms of treatment was with penicillin and sulfur therefore when somebody received the diagnosis of cancer they were a dead man walking they knew there was no hope of recovery you know maybe they they they they fear gripped their life and they fretted about how much pain how much suffering what were they going to have to go through and many times they gave up on life but the prophet had an angel would come to him in a room and says you got a gift and this ain't your gift this is the people's gift this is a gift of divine healing and i'm telling you not even the greatest threat to life will stand before the prayer amen if you can get them to believe and if you will be sincere when you pray not even cancer will stand before their prayer not even the greatest threat to life oh church not even if you could just just just grab hold of that tonight not even the greatest threat to life mark 9 and verse 23 jesus said unto them if thou can't believe all things not some things all things are possible to him that believeth mark 21 and 21 jesus answered said unto them verily verily i say unto you he that has faith and not doubt shall not only do this which is done in a fig tree but also if you shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing you shall receive see god doesn't put limits on what you're able to ask god doesn't put limits he says all things if you can believe it i'll perform it if you can believe it i'll perform it whatsoever you ask the father in my name i will do it all things are possible for them that believe and the bible will tell us as we learned last night in hebrews 11 verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh that god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so you say brother joe as they asked brother branham does everybody get well he says everybody that truly believes gets well that's a quote does everybody get well brother branham everybody that truly believes gets wealth thousands have been healed he said now the brazen serpent when they lifted up that serpent not all of them were healed but those that looked upon it and believe were healed all those that came down to the pool of bethesda all of them wasn't healed but those that had enough faith to get close enough when the angels stirred the pool and they were the first ones to get in they got their need met the same god responds the same way today church it's based on your faith and if i can get you to believe all things are possible see the thing of it is the thing it is he says is to get the people to believe that this is the truth so brother john brother for the lush our responsibility is to get to people to believe amen church your responsibility and i'm gonna share this with you your responsibility is to believe well brother i don't feel it that doesn't matter your responsibility is to believe he says i'm gonna pray for you this is in the angel and the commission be good for you to go back and listen to this he said the gift is not the discernment the gift is to pray for the sick and to get them to believe you get you give what i mean nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer he goes i'm gonna pray for you you believe i believe with all my heart and i lay hands over on them and pray for them asking the blessing in the name of the lord jesus and pass them on he says they're supposed to go away rejoicing believing that they're going to get well the crippled is supposed to believe that they're going to walk the blind is supposed to believe that they're going to see so our responsibility as to ministry is to get you to believe but it's also to be sincere to enter into prayer with you with love with empathy with sincerity so that we can move the situation we can move god's heart to that need but it takes it takes us working hand in hand and i believe that's why god had an angel come down and speak to a prophet he says it all but so that we could have what we have needed he says now notice this is in the angel that came to me and his commission this is another sermon 55 he said regardless of what they have he designated god who's my judge knows that he designated cancer said nothing if you can get to people to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer earnestly contend for the faith he designated cancer would be healed and he said come here notice he did it the angel designated cancer he knew what the greatest threat to life was he says and if you'll be sincere when you pray and get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer he says he spoke cancer that's the only disease that he said so no matter what disease you have tonight no matter what your situation is tonight if you will believe if you will believe see it's what you believe believe in god first believe in the son of god believe in jesus christ believe in the holy spirit believe in angels and then you've got to believe me that i'm telling you the truth do you believe that now that's wonderful so he's showing you got to believe these things but then you've got to believe what i'm telling you is the truth so as we're preaching tonight and we preached last night we're here trying to build your faith to get you to believe you got to believe it some of you raised your hand said you got a need you raised your hand said you need god to respond i will tell you this if you believe like god will respond you can believe tonight god will deliver you it may not be instantaneous but god will perform the work he goes you got to believe it got to testify you got to confess it and god will bring it to pass as we start wrapping this up because we have been we've been a little bit good see god can never go back on his word god can ever go back on he said my word will not return to me void so we know that brother bam is not the one that heals us the signs of discernment does not heal us but it's our faith to believe is what heals us and god used the signs god used to want us to catch the attention of the people to elevate their faith listen what he says here he says divine healing is the bait that you put on the hook the fish doesn't see the hook he just takes debate and gets to hook so that's the way it is he says people see the supernatural the phenomena of the supernatural god healingly sick he said and then they reach for that and the first thing you know the first thing you know they're right in the arms of the lord jesus with great faith to believe but they see the supernatural they hear about the supernatural they witness the evidence of the supernatural and they reach out in their right in the arms of christ with faith to believe for their own self so not even cancer now we find ministry as i'll address us for a minute sincerity we must be sincere when we pray we must be sincere if you can get them to believe and that's our responsibility but we have a responsibility and that's to be sincere and if we look here in the paradox lebron will talk about this he said a voice came there and he said there's great danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that is death when it strikes you and i heard the weeds smashing down and i looked and there come a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds and i thought i wonder what this is i know when this is a vision i've seen it see what kind of animal or what kind of beast it is and it crawled up on the highway and as soon as i i got sidon i knew it was a mamba he said as a man was an african snake and he says he says which is the most deadly bite of all things there's nothing as poison as a mamba and he says now the snake here of course represents death he said that comes the mamba his debt he's death he said he's so fast you just can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and he propels himself with the back of his tail and he's just and then he's gone he hits you in the face and usually he stands up high strikes hard and when he hits you you've got just a few breaths to your finish see it don't only paralyze you but get into the bloodstream it gets into the nerves and everything and you just die in a few seconds and then native boys and track boys you can say mama and they'll butt their heads together and scream because it's death just as soon as you see see when it hits you he says now he was on the highway he goes there he was on the highway and i thought as i looked at him and i said he looked angry at me and he licked out his tongue and here he come but when he got right close to me he could run up fast and then he would just get slower and slower and just quiver and stop and then something would hold him off and he couldn't bite me i think the prophet knew where he stood i think he had faith in his own gift he had faith in his own ministry and he would turn around on the other side and he'd try to approach from this side he would get back and he'd start and he'd swish right towards me and get slower and slower and slower and then to a stop then shake like that and he would move back and he couldn't strike me but notice he said he turned and he looked at my friend and away he went after my friend i see my friend just jumping way in the air over him and over him and over him trying the thing was trying to strike at him and i thought if it ever hits him it'll be instant death and no wonder everybody's so scared because when the thing hits you is instant then and he was just striking at him like that and i threw my hands up i said oh god have mercy on my brother and i said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him and just then the serpent turned to me and when i said that he looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you have been given power to bind him the worst or in it you have been given given power to bind him the worst or any and i said god what must i do and he said there's one thing brother lush one thing brother john one thing what must i do he said there's one thing that you must do you must be more sincere you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere and he said well god forgive me for my insincerity let me have sincerity and when i raised up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like i my whole body was just charged with some and i looked at that serpent and when he started towards me he couldn't do it yet and i said satan in the name of the lord jesus christ i bind you he's in that serpent the blue fl uh smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made like an s sign a capital s sign made backwards the and sign in the n means by this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own life his own self to death around his head and when he made that backward zest that sign that conjunction you see he choked it to death and the brother was free so we find sincerity we have a part to play we have to be sincere and that same voice came again and said you can also unbind him and he says satan that i might know i unbind you when i did he started coming to life again wiggling and i said i bind you back in the name of jesus and when he didn't the smoke flew out of him again and he choked himself right back and turned the crystal you say brother joe how do we unbind him unbelief your unbelief unbinds the serpent but i want you to know you have power to bind him again you may have been given in to unbelief but that doesn't ruin you you just got to be more sincere you got to be believing for the supernatural god you can do what your word declares that you would do he says now this is in another message count down jeffersonville jesus asked jesus said you asked the father anything in my name and i'll do it if you ask and not doubt but when you pray to believe that you receive what you asked for it would be given to us said even you could say to this mountain be moved and not doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass then you can have what you've said father we know that this is the truth we we watch it day by day there's no fault in your word it's because we can't be at the spot sometimes of our faith won't move us up there we flustrate and doubt but this morning we're trying to come lord with new hope holding on to lifeline of christ and his promise so notice it's not his word his word is right sometimes we frustrate it but god didn't respond in my time frame that doesn't matter he's still god don't allow frustrations don't allow doubt doubt to unbind the serpent in your life hold god is true god is faithful notice he says you have power to buy serpent the worst or any now as i end with this last story this is the story of the maniac at oregon many of us probably very familiar with this story but we find here this maniac he was just released out of jail or prison or something for breaking a another minister's jaw on his shoulder and brother brown said he was at a place there were 60 600 people sitting there now counting those that was on the outside and everybody was breathless and this man he he come up to brother branham and he threatened brother brown he made a challenge to brother branham and he you know he hocked up a lugia and spit it in his face trying to get the prophet of god to get in his flesh try to get him into his humanity i don't know about you but i wouldn't like nobody spitting in my face but this prophet stood there and he was just waiting he was going i wonder what's wrong with this man but you know brother batman talks about only he says only love can defeat satan what is love sincerity he says this man is some some lady's or husband some father to some children maybe he's married maybe he's got children he doesn't know me he doesn't feel this way toward me some spirit has got a hold of him and he's like this but he said because you've made a challenge to the spirit of god you made a challenge to the spirit of god he said the spirit of god accepts the challenge he goes and because of that you'll fall over my feet he said the presence of almighty god no matter what it is he's healed he said the very he's a very present help in a time of trouble he said don't be afraid stand on your ground when you face off with these these kind of people when you face off with a man or a woman who's possessed with a demon spirit he says stand your ground don't be afraid now i was sharing with some of the brothers at lunch today and i'll share just one of the stories with you with our louisiana youth camp on a sunday morning there was a young girl come outside and they wanted to have a minister some of the deacons had already prayed with us she had a little bit of fear and anxiety and she just didn't feel right to go back into service yet and i was coming up after an all night of praying for different ones and we had another case the night before saturday night that took us an hour and a half to get the young lady delivered but she finally was delivered but we find here that she needed more prayer and they called call for brother joseph let him go over there and pray for i was i think i was the only other minister there at the time that wasn't preaching the rest of them were sleeping you know how that is right and so i go over there and i begin to talk to her she's i just i got a little bit of anxiety a little bit of fear just wondering what i saw last night with my friends is this gonna come on me and i just politely put my hand on her shoulder begin to pray for and when i did that spirit began to speak out i don't like you i don't like you i said well good i don't like you either see i wasn't afraid because i knew my commission god had called us to cast out serpents cast out devils to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover see we want god to heal but god also delivers god also sets free and this spirit says i'm not going to let her go i said shut up in the name of the lord jesus christ you don't speak anymore and i began to pray for her and we cast that devil out and her body just relax there was a sister from brother donny reagan's church that stood there and or sit there and she said when that thing went to speak out i didn't know i needed to get up and run scared her to death she's never been a part of that but see that's the commission we're not playing church god is real and we have been commissioned to lay hands on the sick we have been commissioned to cast out satan we have been commissioned to preach the gospel with sincerity and we find when this maniac here all these preachers on the platform left the platform left the prophet of god up there by himself 128 pounds and this man some 260 and he had already broken a man's jaw or broken a man's shoulder but he chained and challenged brother branham he challenged the spirit of god and when he challenged the spirit of god the spirit of god accepted a challenge what are you saying brother joe i'm telling you tonight that that devil of hell has challenged you that you can't have your family you can't have your health but i want you to know tonight there's a holy ghost here and it accepts the challenge it accepts your talents and he's here to fight for you he's here to deliver you man went to swing back when he did a prophet of god said satan in the name of jesus christ come out of him and he said he swirled around and around and he fell over his feet and two little policemen that he led to the lord earlier that week they said why is he healed he said no is he delivered he said no he said he's not healed he's not delivered he worships that thing it's because he thinks he's right if he he would have been delivered if he would have repented of his spirit amen but notice oh i just love this he said because you challenged the spirit of god tonight you'll fall over my feet he goes i don't know he goes i didn't know i said that he goes that was the spirit talking and it done took over them he said there was both challenges made he goes no sir he worships that spirit he brings it right back to him because he thinks he's right see he isn't healed he goes at that time when all those demons in there the chief man was defeated he said then they just began to rise up out of wheelchairs out of cots out of stretchers out of everything else and walk why because it was the end of the meeting while everybody was healed they walked out when satan was defeated the whole audience believed with one accord and they went out now if satan is defeated in one case then why can't we do the same i'll tell you in the name of the lord jesus down with satan down with his propaganda down with his unbelief and not with the spirit of god [Applause] he said the greatest devil the chief of all devils is unbelief because that's the only sin there is that's the only sin is a sin of unbelief he said but when the chief of that tribe of demons had made the challenge and lost you see he says that's when the spirit of god struck the building and everything was healed the devil made his challenge and the holy spirit challenged him back i'm declaring to you tonight church healing life fellowship there's a god and he's alive and he's accepting the challenge tonight he's accepting the challenge tonight we hear the story if we look here in numbers 13 as we bring this to a close we bring it to a close and he says they returned from searching the land after 40 days and they went and they came to moses and aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and they brought back word unto them and to all the congregation and they showed them the fruit of the land my they showed them the evidence of healing they showed them the evidence of the supernatural cancer healed tumors falling off borders falling off to the lady shaking the sheets where did it go where did it go crippled legs being made well little boy come through the platform with braces on his legs and the prophet of god said there he goes right there and the place goes into pandemonium because why he just five minutes before come through there and the prophet of god pronounced him healed pronounced him well and five minutes later he walked into his healing he walked into his deliverance what are you saying bro i'm telling you we have evidence of the land they come back producing the evidence we came unto the lamb whether thou sentences and surely it bloweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people are strong to dwell in the land and the cities are all walled up and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak and the malachi's stroll on the land of the south and the hittites jebusites emma rice they dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell in the sea in the coast of jordan and caleb oh i pray that god has a caleb here tonight caleb stealed the people caleb stealed the people caleb saw the same things
