you will lord him lord that we will come obedient to your word in all things we ask in jesus name amen amen lord bless you all as we come into his presence once more we're so glad let's turn in our scriptures to uh john 3 verse 3. welcome you all here to this morning and thankful for song service and bringing this to the place that we need to for the word as we come forward and like i said this is going to be just a sunday school lesson so so let's read here uh john three and then i'll begin talking about being born again and uh this is uh the main scripture here for that and we know it is the first thing that jesus taught when he naked nicodemus visited him so we want to just rehearse these scriptures as we go into the word and that we all settle into this john 3 3 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god so you don't see the kingdom of god unless you have a new birth and you don't see the kingdom of god so unless you have a new birth because you don't you you don't see anything you don't see the motions or the actions or the activities that we have of a new birth without that and the moving of the kingdom of god we're blind to it and these things are hidden from the natural man right so unless we see these things that's why the world goes around the way they do because they do not see those things that spiritual activity that goes on that god is hidden from the world from the wise and now is it being revealed through that experience that born-again experience i just want to quote here uh first corinthians 2 14 you don't have to turn but it says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can we know them because they are spiritually discerned amen they're spiritually discerned so verse 4 nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man may be born of water and spirit and the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god so it takes a new birth to see or to comprehend or to understand what god is doing in this kingdom without it you'll never enter into it it's a necessity verse 6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that's what that which is born of the spirit is fair is spirit so that's such an important thing because there's two births there's one bite of flesh and there's one by the spirit and it came because of the fall and we'll get into that more later so there are two birds one of the flesh and one by the spirit amen you may be seated maybe god had its blessing to the reading of his word so i'll go into this topic here about being born again and it's really just started as a sunday school thing when the sunday school was out there i filled in for paul one time and when i went in and sat down that's all i came to my mind was being born again that topic you know that was just uh all i could speak to there and then we had a another session i filled in for paula again another session and we went more into being born again so uh some of the slides here at the beginning it's just a little background of what we talked about at that point so some people here would would see those things and uh it would be new to others i hope i hope i didn't show it again but i've done that before so we just want to just give a little bit of background first and we'll as we go into that and i hope we all get something out of it here today and i don't get too thirsty amen so just going back into the beginning in genesis 1 1 and it says in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth now we know and we just had a little bit of discussion about this last time when we were in the sunday school just to explain that the in genesis 1 1 the earth wasn't like completely new created and we know that there was there was a earth and brother branham alludes to it he didn't go into it a whole lot but he does explain that there was a civilization before and it was destroyed and it could have happened many many many trillions of years ago we don't know he doesn't go into it because he because in terms of uh this earth today and this what god revealed here it just pertained to this time these 6 000 years but before that there was and the words that were used here in terms of create in the hebrew if they go into the hebrew it wasn't like created new it was just formed yeah it was just formed and brown goes into that in a number of quotes and we had to go into that a bit into the sunday school just to explain those things because it was kind of new to them but that's what happened so so there was a a previous uh creation of just there was some kind of previous creation or civilization and then the earth was cursed everything was wiped off so it probably explains dinosaurs all those things the city and the things they find that are very old that was in the earth because it was just reformed but in in that in that period of genesis 1 1 it was covered by a mist it was dark and even though that there was things in there that could grow they couldn't grow because the sun couldn't reach it because of that mist that was over and here i have is a darkness or a mist so then and then the sun was already created in genesis 1 and the mist was over and in genesis 2 the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep so so that was the existence that started as we know when god you know like started to express his word in that period and that's what the earth looked like and that's what we believe and and in here what happened then is that that god said let there be light so he took away that darkness and then the sun reached the earth and those those things started to grow and then it brings forth what was in that earth that was planted in that earth and very much is that brotherhood said that that type's also the human soul right so that when we we because of the fall when we came into existence there was a darkness upon us so we we see here that it that the man themselves also mirrored the earth in the same way it was it was produced and what happened in the beginning after the fall we read john 6 here and whatever that inner being is that there's an image of god we're going to call that the seed and it was overshadowed by the worldly nature of genesis 2. so this darkness that was over the earth was really the what same darkness over us as it was explained in ephesians 2 and it says where in times past ye walked according to the course of the world because of the birth that soul is overshadowed by the prince of the power of the ear the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so that's the darkness that was upon us where we couldn't see there was nothing could grow that seed that was there could not germinate because of the darkness because the word could not reach it right and that's what happens to everyone and that seed you know we look at it we call it the soul the seed it's the word right it's it's it's the word of god that's in you it's a germ it's a the lowest form of of life that's in that soul is the word of god and that's what gets quickened because that's the part of god that's in us is that seed the rest of it is all was kind of came to our natural birth but that one one piece in there that soul when that word of that light hits that germ seed the word of god it quickens right and it comes to life and that's what happens so that that darkness then moves out of the way just like it did with the earth and then the word can reach it that's the principle but abraham taught so here in quote in the law of grace the first man went away under the law under animal's blood it couldn't change his heart because a animal life won't compare with human life trying to go slow so here under the law they used animals blood but didn't have the the life in it that would that would cleanse away the sin it would only do it for a year when they did a sacrifice in jewish days so the animal can't give the human blood the animal can't do it because his life is a different life and an animal has a life but not a soul an animal is a living being but not a soul there's nothing of a germ seed of god in there right so that soul being that seed that word an animal is a living being but not a soul but god puts soul on man so then my so then my soul what is the soul the nature of the spirit so he explained it so what is the soul is the nature of the spirit and the problem is that nature that's of my spirit and that's what you go through you're born with you go through life and then that's what comes to face to face when that word is quickened and what you have to deal with so what has to change the nature has to change your nature right and we know the nature of man and the nature of god is two different things and the spirit the spirit controls the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body so here we are again in this setup so we see this the soul part and this so what happens was when the light here when the sun went through to the earth here and and generated that seed that that was planted in the earth from that god put there from the first first civilization now starts to come forth so all the trees and everything you read it in genesis 1 it all starts to come forth once that sun starts to hit the earth simple simple basics so then with man once also that that darkness is taken away and the word of god hits that soul then you see that new nature in that that gold part there and then but you're still dealing with the old nature right so you know it's still on on your flesh that fleshly part you'll always have that with you you'll always have that element of that in your that you'll deal with as long as you're in this body you'll always be fighting that spirit it's just the with the word you just you just come to a place where you bring it under subjection you bring it under control so god divides himself and then gathers himself together so really when you look at the plan of god here in the earth you know all all of those like seed is seed is uh sown and then it's it grows and then it's gathered back together and god has the same principle he he he puts out that seed in in in each one of us and then it grows and then he comes back and gets it that's himself he's he's putting himself out there and then he's bringing himself back and that's the basic plan of god right and that's what we go through now is we know we're going back to god we came from god we're going back to god if you weren't in god and he didn't sow that seed in you then you're not going back there a simple fact so it's not about us it's about him what he's doing right so if you're not there in the beginning you won't be there in the end you know that's cold hard facts and that's all come out in the in the in the message you know because there's you know there's things you could never you could never really put it together before you know in terms of uh you know elect and then there was foolish virgin and wise virgin and you just couldn't put all the scriptures to apply to that because there's really things that apply to the elect because you know it said he chose us you know we didn't choose him and i know i never choose i chose him i had nothing to choose him from choose him there was nothing in me to choose him i couldn't in my own mind even recollect that you know just being under that nature under that darkness you're dead so then when you're quickened it's already done it was done from the foundation you were chosen and now here you are and you're quickened and now you're just starting to realize you go to the altar but that's only just formality that's only tradition really you're just finding out something that you never knew that something's drawn you you know and that's what's drawn you is that word for your data shining on that on that seed right and bring it forth and that's why you're here today and there's what's amazing is only a few it's only a few especially in this hour he places himself in the earth then broods over it to find part of him from the beginning so he goes looking for it right the holy spirit goes goes to find that seed right and uh because it's buried in there in all these humans and all sort of things his seed is here and when found then it begins the process in them called the new birth that's what happened that's what he calls the new birth so the new birth is really two parts it's you're born up by the spirit you're quickened that is quickened and then you're baptized with the holy spirit that's the new birth he pulls that which is part of himself as we said and he's casting a net but gets more than fish so he he he he's the word is is out there and it's cast out just like jesus talked about you know and as fishers of men and going out and pulling in fish but you get everything from the sea right so it's a lot of things that come in together with it and we know that we've seen it in here and it comes in here and it's it comes in but it never stays because god chooses what comes in and what stays right he does right so for for us as christians we're open to everything right we're open to to we don't know you never know you'll never know because we don't know the future i don't know anybody here is really really truly you know the seed because we don't know the future you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow right then you never know if he's not right you never know and i know it was i think like jenkins who said he said uh god knows god knows who who is and who isn't right and he only tells you and he doesn't tell anybody else so you have to you have to that's why you never judge right because you can't you know we can't see a head like that so so you know and if you don't know what at the beginning you'll eventually know sometimes it takes a long time you know before you understand that you were but it's just a little slow turn and then you kind of see it but it's a lifetime process we know because as we said that old nature is there still like putting out but it has no power it has no power right because once calvary was finished the planet redemption was finished and satan had no power which means that he can't come and condemn you he can condemn you he'd give you all kinds of condemnation but he can't go to god and say he did this there's no good he has no power he has no power anymore it it means nothing to god god said what are you talking about right there's nothing there's nothing there it's gone let's see forgetfulness and then once it passes through to see it for forgetfulness once you go through there it's righteous righteousness you have righteousness and if god has given you anything he never takes it back right if he's given you uh the holy ghost he'll never take it back if he's given you it's just like the lutherans they have justification and they still have it right wesleyans still have sanctifications they you know methodists all of them all those that came past that still have it he will never take it away pentecost have what they had at the beginning they still have it they still have the gifts of the spirit you know and they but they don't move on right just they and righteousness you know it's like if you see where abraham and uh sarah laughed right i said he said sir why'd you laugh right but then abraham when he said you know you're gonna have he laughed but god said nothing to him right he was righteous he's casting a net but gets more than fish it's preached to all but god doesn't pick and choose because of some preconceived idea he doesn't right it's really he's just going he's looking for his own he's sweeping the earth looking for it and he'll find it he he will not lose one because he went and one he had a hundred sheep one one was lost and he went and found us he won't lose any of them you can't because it's god it's a part of him that sees part of him and he's not going to be incomplete at the end you know it's is that's why the last one has to be in he says this one because that one is his the other will never receive the call nothing in it to receive the call right it just doesn't happen you see it yourself and it could be religious as anything and you present the word and they just walk away but you don't condemn him up because we don't know up the road he could you know remember tim pruitt saying there was one person and he was he just wrote him off there's no way that he could ever be he was such a cruel and hard man and he got saved yeah and uh but brandon had it with that that man bert yeah so here uh just quickly over in the mind of god here and brother brown talked about yard goods and he talked about here a pattern and god laid out his his material and then he takes his pattern and he puts it in and that that was his elect right he took that that was that was his that would be his bride and then there was a remnant and the rest of it probably said it folds up and puts it away and use it some other time and that's that doesn't say that it's not it's not the part of god it's all part of god this is in the mind of god it's in the mind of god it'll all come back to him in the end right so just just uh run through this quick there for i had this for the sunday school here the elect is god's seed or as we know is the wise virgin and they have the holy ghost they had the oil right now and they have eternal life they went in when the in the end they went in they had the oil and they went in john 5 24. let's put random often quoted revelation 3 21 i just won't go into it so in the remnant it is god's seed it's the fooling foolish virgin but they had no holy ghost they had no oil now when you look at that scripture in matthew 24 just explain that there you know it does talk about have all but you know the oil represents the holy ghost and if god gives you the holy ghost you you cannot he will not take it back and it's if you look in 24 it says that they they they didn't have the holy ghost they had it and they lost it and that doesn't happen to people but it happens to churches so in luther's day they had the holy ghost they had the oil but after a number of generations it went so in that case it's a double meaning it talks about people but it also talks about churches it talks about those church ages where they will be given the word for their day but they will lose it up the road you know a couple of generations when ma when it's their revelation starts to mix in with the to the thoughts of man and the the things of god uh things of god is not pure anymore then the holy holy ghost moves moves from it and you see that right in the early church also you see it in the early church where paul and them are sending out warnings that this it's going it's not going good here you know this is starting to fall and it did it fell in that first second third age until in the fourth age it was almost gone right off the earth right in the in the dark ages there was hardly any seed there left at all you know and we know why we know why because you know in those seven church ages uh you know there was a portion of god in those in the first age right up on second age third age there was just it was the son of god period and they had a message for their age but it wasn't the whole message because it was lost from the beginning but then in you know in one age you might have justification was the message and sanctification wasn't but in the justification age they didn't have sanctification so they didn't have it all right it was only a partial part of that whole message but in the last age we saw it all restored back again the way it was in the first stage and it had everything right and goddess everything so they just had a portion of and that was the son of god age it's another topic altogether so no no moisture there in for the remnant justified sanctified clean life they don't go on to the holy ghost they have justified sanctified they live a holy life but they don't go on to the holy ghost so they didn't get into the door in matthew 24. they went into the tribulation and that was the foolish virgin and this well taught there in the message went through the tribulation so that was god's remnant from the mind of god that was those two categories there and the unbeliever is the serpent seed born a man no seed they don't have anything to receive god and we'll just talk about that in the next slide and they go through the tribulation so here the elect they go into the rapture or the first resurrection and the millennium they go through the millennium there is no judgment they took their judgment at calvary they were in christ just like eve eve was in adam the bribe was in christ just like eve came out of the side of of adam the soldier went up and hit the side of jesus with the sword and the bride was came out right she appeared then in that first stage second resurrection and they go they will go they will go to the second resurrection they will go through the judgment they will not be there at the tribulation then they are granted eternal life so after after the first resurrection there's there's there's no word just you're you're you're based in on on works right new new heavens and earth they will be there outside the city because they are part of god right but they will not be in the city and and then the unbeliever will go through the second resurrection the judgment no eternal life the lake of fire but there will be some that will come in on their works right we know that we see that in matthew 25 because there will be mercy for some right who are good to the bride amen so god is just amen so that's that's the view of election so blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly voice according this is what i mentioned before is he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that's the scripture he has chosen us right we didn't choose him he choose us i know that for a fact i didn't i didn't go looking for god until he started to started to quit he quickened you right he quickened something that made you start to what's going on here uh i'm changing something's happened to me i'm not like i used to be people are saying you're not like you used to be you know you start doing things you didn't do before you never thought you were doing your life you know and you were starting to read things that you never and things started to disappear in your life and you had no desires all this started to happen and that's what happened he's he's there looking for you right he's called hey john now this is uh this is from uh john's presentation uh his sermon he did on predestination which was a really good there on predestination that he preached like 2020 and i transcribed it and uh no no i'm sorry that's the next one i saw election there but these are just some scriptures there on election four many are called but few were chosen praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved so this is not wide open here you know the big net coming in anyone comes in and then decides i'm going to follow christ then okay i get into heaven that's not the way it was right there was a a group ordained to be saved [Music] it says and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life there's a group that was ordained to eternal life that god came looking for right so all this came out in the first age and it was lost in the other ages and has come out in this age right we're seeing it now brother man preach it over and over again moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified and whom he justified then he also glorified so how would he bring him in by being born again they had to be born again and that's the process and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that it's thirst come and whosoever will so this is an interesting scripture i really like it because it says the spot that's in the last part of the bible it says the spirit and the bride they're together now right they're the voice they're the voice that that you hear right it's the the spirit and the bride and then he also has a whosoever path so there is a a part for whosoever who can decide to come right yes who can decide to follow jesus who hears the word and wants to do it and and this is the foolish virgin really who decide that right and they will take the water of life freely right so they're still uh like a free will right free will that you can follow these things so it's still there but the bride the bride is the elect it has no choice it will come whether you like it or not and if you won't come he'll take your life right and we've seen that with brother bryan's brother right and other people they just said no that's it and god took their life because they had to come did they get the reward no they lose their reward right but it has nothing to do with being elected because they were part of god that's he was in if i can go backwards oh here we go so here redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner god by his death and the shed blood brought back his own he brought back the spoken word seed bride my sheep hear my voice and they follow me you you always were a sheep right always were sheep as we we were in the thoughts of god and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our father calling us and recognizing that we are the sons of god right so that's this is from john's presentation here that's what happens when you truly hear the word for the first time when it finally drops down into your heart that's when you recognize that you are a child of god and then you recognize you're not a sinner saved by grace right you're not you're you're a child of god your sins are all gone into the thing god doesn't even recognize he doesn't see it so then you you come to an another level that you know the devil is telling me and my flesh all the things i've done but you know that was things that he put on me that god took away and put in the sea of forgetfulness and gave me his righteousness and god just sees righteousness so why am i a sinner saved by grace anymore no i'm a child of god right brother brown said in the last in his last sermon and almost in the last page he said i'm no longer a son of charles daniella branham i'm a son of god we heard his voice and we cried out as did the prodigal son save me o my father i am returning to thee a son of god can go a long time before he recognizes that he is a son he can he can it could take a while right and you know this whole process is a lifetime you know the whole process of coming into maturity and coming into the adoption and that's a whole other you know level right where god can you're out of the way totally you're out of the way totally you've surrendered your life totally there's nothing that you're going to do and you see it you see it in uh uh abraham right and he he sold a go to glendale to leave er and go to the land he goes there he says i don't like this he goes to egypt you know that's not what you're supposed to do right you're supposed to stay here in this land that i give you you know canaan he said no i didn't like his famine here i'm going that's not the way it works for an adopted son but when god said to him take your son up there and and kill him sacrifice him no hesitation right yes and that's the way we come right or jacob or take any of them they learned the hard way brother branham look what he had to go through right and at the end of it no question no questioning whatsoever no god i'm not going to do that that doesn't happen so here you see the field and it talks about here another parable putting forth onto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like an unto a man who sows good seed in the field so this is this is this god going and putting out the seed into the hearts of people right we know the interpretation here we have a field and below is the soil it says he sold good seed a good man sowed good seeds matthew 20 13 but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way so that's the situation we find ourselves in now god put the seed out there he didn't put bad seed out there someone came and put bad seed out there it was the devil and and he was asleep didn't know right so now all of a sudden you got all that serpenty an enemy comes now and he sold a different kind of seed bad seed that the tears are weeds and he had a perfect crop there and he he only had good seeds in there so now you see his his crop and it it comes to to full life just go through this quick here but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the servants say this is at the end now we're at the end when all this is starting to come up right so the servants of the household didn't see this till the end in our age right yes you start to understand hey there's good and bad here right so the servants of the household come and they said unto him sir thus so not so good seed in the field from whence then has it tears you only sowed wheat seed when but were seeing weeds mixed in with it so no one no one knew it you know you kind of oh boy look here's good and bad you know where all these weeds come from he said unto them an enemy has done this the servant said on him well we'll thou then that we go and gather them up and they said uh look uh there's weeds out there so do you want us to go out there and cut out all the weeds but he said no less while you gather up the tears you root up the weed with them right so you could have someone here if you want to put it to us you know there could be uh you know there's families there's could be families in here and someone is bad and you kick them out the church and the other ones who are good seed but they're upset with it and you know you've you've really kind of you know offended them and they leave the church and they get rooted up and go you know that's that's kind of the type so he says just leave it you know let god let god handle it here but he said he says when they said to come forth they're going to look exactly the same they're going to look very similar initially they're going to look the same because it's just a little green sprig so let both grow together until the harvest and the time of the harvest and i will say to the reapers gather eat together first of tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into the barn so just one more on this then jesus sent the multitude away went into the house and the disciples come up to him and saying declare us the parable of the tears of the field and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good sweet is the son of man we're going to say good seed it's the children of god the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sold them is the devil the harvest at the end of the world of reapers of the angels is wonderful he explains all this isn't it so therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be at the end of the world so that's what's happening in our time right and birdman says it's later and you're thinking i think i'm thinking about that later than you think later than you think you know i think later and i thought that later in the year than you think means it's already happening right and it's probably happening in the message you see different things pop up and they gather together over this certain doctrine and tie together and go over here and it could be the it happened already right in the previous diagram we had satan's children we had god's children in the perfect plan of god this diagram shows the perfect plan of god the thoughts of god are only the good seeds the original field only has good seeds in it and it was a surprise right it was never meant to be it wasn't a perfect will god never did it right he allowed it but he didn't do it and satan comes in and this happened in the garden of eden when he seduced eve and he injected his own seeds in there and added to the crop but in the original mind of god the bad seeds did not exist only the good seeds existed the bad seeds don't get back in the end right they weren't in the mind of god that's the point when you look at predestination and the choosing of god god didn't come along and all these seeds good and bad were in the ground it's not that he turned them down but he didn't choose him because they were never there in the first place because somebody else planted the seed into the field he wasn't picking randomly there's a perfect will of god and it only includes good seeds but somebody comes in and corrupts it and god's got to do something about it and we are in our life always trying to figure it out what's going on here right because you're seeing different things happen like that that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit so that's that's the review okay that's what we did last time in the sunday school so the field is is the world the good seed are the children of king just to jump off from there but the tears are the children of the wicked one so if we look here you've got the children of the kingdom and you have now we're just going to go through history and see what happened with all this so you got the children of the kingdom and the children of the wicked one and then you have good seed and you have bad seed and you have the son of man who went to seoul and you had the devil working working on the other side so when you see adam he was he was born you have to be born again right you have to be there's two ways to be born by the by the flesh or by the spirit and adam was born by the spirit now really when you're born by the flesh we would we would just call it the sex birth right that's how you come upon this earth and we can all identify with that right having been and having done it right that you know you bring forth that's that's that's what happened in the garden of eden but adam wasn't that way he was born by spoken word not true sex so and and he he had great power he had great power he had the whole earth he had the book you know he had it all and and i believe he could go up to heaven come down and he could see those things and god came to see him and he could travel but his jurisdiction was just the earth right and the earth was a part of god also the earth is within the mind of god also if you look at that before the foundation the earth was there also the earth is going to be redeemed back just like the humans it's in the in the seals as one that comes back right it'll be burnt over but it'll be uh it's still there because it was in the mind of god it's just not people it's also like things like that like the earth so john in john 1 12 13 but as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood who were not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of god but of god it was the ones that were born of god it was born by the spirit so the person can be born of blood a person can be born of blood right so that's that's true the sex birth that it it can be done like that and not necessarily be born of god right and it can be born of the will of flesh so you could the couple could decide we're gonna have one right and they have one you know that can go on in the world today and god is all behind it and says but it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be like it was in the original plan of god where this one would be here in eternity you know this could happen and the scripture also said it can be born of the will of man where flesh gets in right and it produces a child but there is a birth of god so then after that was the fall and then through the sex birth you see the first three coming cain abel and said so if you're if you're born through sex birth you're on the right side here that's where you are everyone is right and we know there's a lot over here right so if you go through the old testament 4 000 years it's all everyone was born this way right so you could have the anointing of god and the prophets would have the anointing on their spirit or they would have anointing on their flesh of god and the presence of god but there was no one born again we understand that right there's no one where that gene seed was quickened right so in you know just a couple of the uh important periods where in genesis 6 1 just before noah's day the sons of god saw the daughters of men and they were fear and that took them wives of them so there was a mixing here there was a crossover that is the first time that happened where these two lineages where where uh kane went off and he was he he was exiled and there was a whole lineage started and over here was able it was k seth and his lineage was started here but they mixed in 6-1 that's when they the the sons of the the daughters of men and the sons of god mixed and then they lost track of it you know but then but then the flood came and it started again with the three sham and jam so under the law then in in leviticus under the law it talks about that redeemer so they went every year with their sacrifice every year this animal sacrifice that we've read about there and it didn't have it it didn't produce uh uh you know it didn't it used animal blood right to make a sacrifice for one year where their sins were forgiven but every year they had to repeat and to repeat and it was in they were in jail for the rest of time they couldn't get out of it because there was no one who could who could uh fulfill this scripture in the law that a human could die and pay the price for that right because there was no such human right there was no such kin they couldn't do it all through the kinsmen redeemer so so they couldn't do it so here in in in in 700 bc you see the scripture says that the prophecy that came forth therefore the lord himself wonderful prophecy shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive whoa that would work right you could produce a human here who didn't have the original sin right who didn't have that sin who could die for those those who did did have that sin and they could be redeemed right this is a plan this is good so that's what you see through the old testament that there was only adam here who was ever born of god who didn't need that but now adam i didn't do it but he did come over to the right side right because soon as he sinned he was he was put over here under that and he needed a redeemer adam did right and he joined with with eve but he needed to redeem her himself because he after a while he was he was like us and you know i i kind of i sensed god around you know and he's trying to tell me something and you know trying to figure out what to do you've all been there you know trying to figure out the will of god adam fell right into that i'm sure right because he he just lost that presence of god he had that darkness he had that ephesians 2 darkness come over and he was subject to his flesh you know imagine a conviction he had lost my animation so here we go i got half it here i didn't check that over anyway i now you see the enter so now coming into the new testament we see mary she was in the same boat solas uh so she is we know she's the one that's going to fulfill uh 7 14. so all those years from 700 bc right up to this this time when mary came on the scene you know jews tried to figure out what that was and they try to and just like regular humans they try to figure out what god is trying to say in his prophecy and they say oh that's fulfilled knows not and you know because you know the law of god is he doesn't he doesn't uh uh reveal anything until it's it's being fulfilled right you know god is the interpreter of his own word you know that message so that's what happens and we saw that in our age and uh you know when the seven seven seals or the seven church ages he doesn't really reveal anything until the seventh you know and he so in the seventh age then a prophet comes and reveals about all the ages and then and the seven said he reveals about all the seals and in the trumpets well he didn't right because the seventh seventh trumpet is not revealed until 11 revelations 11 15 144 000 in the two prophets so then when that seventh trumpet is revealed then the other seals were trumpets will be revealed one to six and seven but brother brown didn't know about five and six because it fell in his period so he didn't know something about remember he went defeat the to preach the feast of trumpets and god said no can't do it right he couldn't do it but he did get now he did and he just went and talked about the feast of trumpets that's what he talked about but he did understand five and six because it related to first world war and second war and all that so he didn't understand that god god showed him that and showed us us but we don't know the fullness of that and only the jews will get that in that case and this is the case here with mary right so he had so let's just turn the scriptures there to uh revelation uh sorry luke luke uh there's somebody guess before mary came out there one i got it written here not good for following my notes sorry it's in the animation there so luke 128 i didn't have it all here because it would take up too much room luke 128 and the angel came came unto her and said hail thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women so we know the scripture pretty good and then she saw him and she was troubled at his saying and cast it in her mind what manner of salvation this should be she's totally unaware of all this right and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou has found favor with god god bless her and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb so here's coming here's coming now a a new this is born again here right something is going to conceive in mary but not true sex right it's going to come through god right and this way it was supposed to be in the beginning and thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus there's a lot in that verse he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be saying i shall not a man shall i i think i know not a man so she goes back to the other birth right the sex birth and the angel answered and said the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overcome thee therefore also that holy thing that shall be born in thee shall be called the son of god that's you right that's us you know the holy ghost comes over us and it's quickened in us that seed and we become not the son of god but a son of god and thirty-six and behold the covenant by cousin elizabeth she also has conceived a son sex birth in our old age and this is the six months with her who has called who was called barren but with god nothing shall be impossible for mary said behold the handmaid of the lord beat unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her amen this wonderful scripture so here it is in 35 that we just read so through the spoken word jesus came into being right that man who came into being so all here over in in isaiah 7 14 and that's prophesied that just spins around wait and it will be fulfilled everything that god says will be fulfilled and then zoom adheres to time and the angel comes angel gabriel comes to mary and says you know this is it this is the fulfillment of it no one knew it no one understood it no one would have believed it but this is what happened and mary believed it and she had to believe it right and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory of the only begotten son of god full of grace and truth matthew 27 52 when the graves were opened and many bodies of saints were which have slept a row so we cut we come down through it and we see all the old testament saints that we saw in the previous slide who didn't all of these are they stayed in there in the in the with god we we know where they were you know they were in in that place there and it talks about where it talks about uh lazarus and he was in the bosom of abraham and they could see him and there was a great gulf fixed but they could see over there you know the the rich man and he could see and he wanted lazarus to come over right so it was a great gulf yeah so here now at the end at the end once we're at calvary then once in in matthew 27 they were all resurrected with jesus so the price has been paid the the kinsmen redeemer has fulfilled that blood sacrifice and all of these people that you know uh looked forward to that prophecy being fulfilled now have been redeemed right yeah so there and we see it in psalms where they you know open your gates open your gates that's when jesus let him out of there and they went from that place where they were with that great gulf fixed they went in to the sixth dimension underneath the altar that's where they went so so they were taken out of there and they were redeemed so they had to wait for that to be fulfilled and then they were they had to sacrifice and take it out wonderful right god's plan so they really moved over here they were they were in that condition now where they would be going back into uh the presence of god in that resurrection right so the plan of redemption when jesus said it was finished the plan of redemption was that the price was paid really it was just satan didn't have any power he lost everything it went back to christ and but there was still more to be redeemed but this is the way they were going to be redeemed right they opened the way now with the redemption that they would be the holy ghost would come upon them and they would be you know a change right and they would have the new birth right glory so that's what happened here my sins were paid for when it was finished my healing was paid for when it was finished all that happened in isaiah 53 jesus christ allowed them to lay the stripes on his back so that i could be healed right so we're already healed right everyone is already healed why would i refuse that why would i refuse what he has already paid for for me right so it's all there you just accept it and of all the things you know when i you know i think you know with me i've come down to you have to believe especially us under the abrahamic covenant because we're under the royal seed that jesus did it all uh god said he was going to do all of it we didn't have to do anything it wasn't a conditional covenant it was totally unconditional right and we just had to believe abraham he's the father of faith he just believed so we don't give ourselves faith i don't give you faith god gives us faith right so he gives us faith and then he rewards you he gives you faith to believe right that's all he got to do is believe and then he rewards you for the faith you have that he gave you hebrews 11. glory so really you need faith to believe under our covenant right which is the royal city of abraham amen and that covenant is still still open right yeah so we just have to believe you have to believe that i i just fooled up my my things my animation then pentecost see we're going down through history here right see how god did this right through through the spirit and through the flesh and this is how he worked it all out right my view so then you see the disciples coming up here in the pentecost and they received the holy ghost right all of these received the holy ghost and you know they were fearful first and then the spirit came down it was quickening the seed and they re they they were quickened and also received the holy ghost there was a hundred the disciples the 120 that were in the upper room all received it and then there were three three thousand souls that were saved these were the first ones over here on the on the left receiving this right born-again experience and then of course going out to the gentiles after paul turned from the jews went to the gentiles and those were ordained as we said earlier i just got a little repeated here then they gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about 3 000 souls that were born again not by the spirit not by the flesh but by the spirit and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved and when the gentiles heard this and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed right so these these are going to go this is the bride we're talking about this is going to go there's no you know you might think that you're deciding whether you're doing this or not but you're not this is this is elect god's family is birthed by the word amen so the world on the other side still carry on the same born by sex and unless you get over to this column you're not going to be there you'll be you'll be resurrected in the second resurrection but you go to the judgment none on the r on the left will be going through the judge you don't want to go to the judge you don't want to go in there with your with your own works right and try to prove what you did you did because the the flesh the flesh you know is just powerful except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god except the man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of god that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit right as jesus taught and that's the way it is today it's a flesh birth and a spirit birth and then after the church ages it was strictly the bride and then the rapture we see the jews in 144 000 coming under the same message and had to be born again right just like because it's it's open now they don't have to do a sacrifice anymore they don't know it because they're blinded but they have to be born of the spirit the holy ghost has to overcome them uh come upon them and quicken that seed that's in them amen i just like this here uh this is you know it talks about being born again in verse 22 but it says seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently and i just wrote this out here seeing you have purified your just to explain this this party says every time you line up to the word you're chipping off part of the old nature purifying the soul the soul itself is pure it came from god but there is this whirly nature overshadowing and we have a tendency to lean into that but how do i get my soul washed you walk in the spirit obey the word in the spirit and you can't do it yourself but by walking in the spirit god can cause you to start living the word with every little step of obedience there's chipping way of the old worldly nature purifying the spirit so this uh quote here quickly uh and that's what the christian does when you're planted in the christ jesus everything that you have need of is in earth's journey is is in you when you receive the holy spirit i think it's priscilla and the only thing that you have to do is drink drink and push out and push out just drink till you can't drink no more right if you need a if if you have need of divine healing go to god's word and drink from it until you push it out right if you need more of god just keep drinking and pushing out and christ is the inexhaustible fountain of life and if you're planted in him the only thing you have to do is drink of his goodness and push out whatever you have need in this search journey and this is nice here it's all drinking resting peace it's not what you struggle and strive and pull at you defeat the very purpose that you're representing when you do that amen just rest in god right lovely quote so you know you the more you put in there and and the opposite unfortunately the the the opposite is true too the more the other stuff you drink in it will push out right but you're drinking the good stuff and all of that comes out you know what god has desire for you right for that glory scripture being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever therefore the word of god brings a birth i just threw that in there so here just going back to this picture and you see that the uh uh the the this first part the flesh the body part is a it now it it doesn't become a position of dominion i gotta cut off here over here this once a man is born again he's quickened and in his soul and then this is the the domination this is the position of domination this is the one that's in control now right and but this flesh still stays as a position of influence they're in a place of influence they still and i got to fade it out but it it has the old nature has the has the attributes of you know adultery fornication all those things you know that's in that spirit that we see in the news there and with different people but then also and you can still have that but you had to bring that under control right you had to bring all those things under control you'll have him until you know i remember his sister sister uh sadie and dying and she was still fighting you know you're still fighting those things right you know but uh you know you'll have him right up to the end because you're in that flesh right and the flesh is just tormenting all the time the devil don't leave you alone and he knows your weak spot right you know he knows your weak spot i just got a good quote on that after and and also here with the new nature god's nature is love joy peace all of those things so that becomes the position of domination right dominion right so now there's a union and now you are a new creature in the soul the old nature is burned out of you your new nature is god and the spirit shifts with the nature but the old nature is always there to haunt you because you are still in this body that has the old nature the old nature loses the position of dominion but it moves down to a place of influence so it will torment you and bring up stuff and satan will bring up stuff but he has no power he can't go to god and say look what he did god god says i don't see it you know i i don't see it it's all gone in the sea of god's forgetfulness and you know the righteousness is upon you so god doesn't take it into account at all so satan doesn't do that anymore it's a waste of time but he'll torment you it will try to condemn you over the things that is that you did in the flesh but it has no power right it has no power and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of bangor provoking one another and being one another and it also says you know uh resist the devil and he'll flee from you and james but it also says before the verse before that was submit your life to christ it says before that so that's uh that's a condition there so this is what i talked about here in uh in the days of daniel's time to re how can i overcome he says there were four overcomers that could stand the test of the fire and the lion so talking about the three hebrew children and daniel now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he that comes to god must first be tested tested with the word that's god's test do you believe it he that cometh to god must be tested that only shows a true child then be tested and when the test comes on you can't overcome less there's a test give to you and when and when and when test is given when the test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and jesus says to him that overcometh the test the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you what's the greatest thing that ever happened to you is your test right to overcome and we know that's in revelation there i believe it's written in the scripture peter said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's all it's a testing time it's one good evidence of us that god is with us and when we're tested for all children of god are tested and tried right so there's something comes with it right and there's something in us all different but you know we have to overcome and that's our test that's right help us this is another part here i'll just finish up with this one i'm an hour and five minutes sounds like the churches these days doesn't it i have five more minutes and as i may so say levi also who receive a tithe pay at tithes in abraham so bernab talks about this many many times and he says that levi paid tithes in abraham right when he was in abraham so if you look at these four generations and brother brown says now look now you begin to be germanized as your body in your great grandfather so brother brown used to go back four generations when he said perry greenlee went back he goes back four generations he sees him in there in four generations just like levi right remember the story there green told that yeah yeah no no no so he he says perry green here's his shoe and he goes describes his father and then his grandfather and his great-grandfather he said you had a different name then you you had a different name green wall or something i don't know what it was and so he goes back four generations that's what he sees and this is this is where he's coming off here because he says that levi that that germ that tiny little germ started in abraham for levi and that's why he was accredited for tithes because he was in abraham right that's right so he says now you begin to be germanized as your body and your great grandfather the germ began begin to begin to become active did you know that so levi started to become active in abraham right why why here it says levi pay tides when he was in the loins of abraham his grandfather is that right now if you were germatized in your great grandfather come out through your grandfather down to your father then then in and that's how you become germanized for your body interesting you know you begin in your germ of life when you become dramatized in your great grandfather that scripture levi pay tithes in the loins of abraham his grandfather all right put but your germ your life your soul began in the creation of god in the beginning that germ right sons of god shouted for joy right that's where you began in the creation of god in the beginning didn't jesus tell us to save us i knew you before the foundation of the world called us ordained us to be ministers of the gospel and so forth it's the for for for ordination of god and the natural types of spiritual right so it goes back four generations so very i sent you except a corner we fall into the ground and die it abideth alone if i but if i die it brings forth much fruit and we know that scripture right in john and we saw that in the dark ages where it's pretty well the church almost completely died and went into the ground and then it came out in the luther's age in the in that fifth church age so i i just heard two so jesus said that that corn of corn of wheat that germ was planted then that was him right that was him he went there and it came up here in luther in justification because the natural types are spiritual so if we talk about those three ages this is where this is where the germ of life came in here for this age right so we were really back there because our germs started back in that day when he went into the ground right so usually with first usually with the the church ages first generation second and third generations it starts to fall and you see in matthew 24 the holy ghost the holy spirit the oil ran out right so after a few generations it starts you know things start getting in there and it starts to denominate and that's what happened in the the in the lutheran age and they just go straight line they take no turn they just go on and they think they're going to retirement that's what heaven is to them right they just seem to die and they go on i just obeyed this but but but what happened is that just denominated god left it and he started up another another age right in the western age under the blood and then another three generations it dominates and goes on we see that you see it in the church it starts to change right it denies the word then from the next stage lutherans couldn't take wesley some could some made the jump right but a lot couldn't right yeah so then the third age comes along and then three generations and broadband usually only gives it five years right five years then the man man mixes in with the generations he talks about that in later scene age and then it denominates and it goes on right and really if you look at from what we had in the what that study we did on the three city ages really the seed that they have is really back here in pentecost right back here they didn't really go on in here for the other feast that we're into now which is the trumpets the atonement and the tabernacles right so we're we're seeing they just stop right they just believe this they don't go on they don't want it they have no need of it they just because it's not in there the first ones the first ones were the seed right the first ones that received it but it changes god keeps moving and in the message when the seals were open here and it would happen if this went for longer it would happen in this age it would have to right but in this age you know the church would go on but there's a rapture coming and would take that that group that goes out but the rest will go on whoever's left who is here by association whatever reason who god did weren't in god's mind in the beginning they will just go on into the tribulation with the rest right here you know god have mercy right so that's what happens so here it was god man he was the son of god he was a new new creation man and god met and joined he was the first of the new race he is the head of the new race therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creation all things have passed away behold all things are become new in the later scene age but now he's standing in the midst of the church and he stands there revealing who he is in this last age he calls himself the author of creation of god this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of the church the heavenly bridegroom created his own bride as a spirit of god he came down and created in the mary in the virgin mary the cells from which his body was born i want to repeat that he he created the very cells in the womb of mary for that body it was not enough for the holy spirit to simply give life to a human or ovum supplied by mary god created you for this day for this hour so he can man manifest himself through you completely this this is the fullness right and and the only way that you're going to get there is you have to surrender your life completely completely to this right and because he will not share it so he he has to have full control so that he's in there he wants to do what he wants to do when he wants to do it and he doesn't want no one hindering them and that's you right so you have to surrender that and you saw that with the other ones that i referenced abraham or jacob or brother branham you know they had to surrender that their will so it's not like i want to do this it's not god's you know what is your will you know if it be according to your will right he created you for this time and you were to come to the very image of him that's guaranteed it's his spirit that works in you he's bringing you to that perfection he's bringing you to the very image of himself but you have to let him he'll do it anyway but it's much easier if you let him and if you don't you will carry on like the rest of the church and go into a tribulation right but his seed will go in his seed in this age will go in that rapture right and all the other seed from the other ages will come first and then you know they will rise first right when it finally drops down into the heart that's when you recognize that you are a child of god second last slide so you see later to see it now i had you know i have a real question about laodicea it's just me i'm just thinking about it and you know i just don't think that in the seven church age that god is talking to the elect i think it's the foolish virgin because when you look down to it there's nothing in there for the elect you know because he doesn't say one good thing about him you know there's nothing in philadelphia he says he doesn't say any bad thing in the philadelphia church age everything is good he doesn't say one bad thing in that letter to the philadelphians the sixth age but in the seventh he didn't say a good thing you know so i just wonder if really it was for the elect at all and i know like uh in the man age you know that man spirit which is denominations it started in luther and that was over lutheran aged western age and i think that went up to really the the the latest scene age because it was still very denominational it was denomination and it and in the later scene age it was very much denomination until 62 and 63 and brother brown said in spoken word he said i haven't come to that uh office of a prophet yet right that's right he says that in 62 at 63 he does he comes in to see us and everything changed then right then it was the man age then there was no more it was the eagle age the eagle really came into place and then it never happened so i really wonder if if if that later the same age it's just so bad right and what we're living in is so bad now i mean it's so it's getting so bad now with woke and all of that stuff and the sodom condition and it's good it's a sudden condition because it wasn't a sodom condition it wouldn't we wouldn't be in the last age right when a prophet come so it's a good thing it's there for that reason only right but it's good it's there and noah's age you know given in marriage and all of that that's that's here also right and it shows that we're in the last stage with a prophet coming on the scene so i just it's such a mess and we're we're in there with it that's what this shows is that we're into it but we're getting called out but it's a big question what you come out with right and what you take with from that age because we can get caught up with so much stuff you know this is the preaching part but you know we can get caught up with this stuff that we just have to get above it we just can't be pulling stuff over into that what i showed that rapture going up that church you know we have to be free free from that because on the only way that god is going to to you know occupy himself within us if we are totally given over to him right 100 you know and you can't be dragging a lot of this stuff that we like and desire and everything like that over and over i just don't think we're going to because in before we're talking about god's creation this is a new creation adam's creation everything god everything in the right column goes into the tribulation into the into uh into lake fire everything right everything that doesn't belong to god and we're getting shaken now right you see everything's shaking right you see and now like like you're seeing uh what's happening in ukraine that's the whole world's involved that that's a shaking right that could go any which way right and you know we see that's the beast power coming up now and taking control and that's why putin lost because he took on the the beast power now you can't take the beast power and that's the one the trolls controls the economy and all of those kinds of things and putin is feeling it right you can't do that and i sent out that note from jason watkins right and he explained it real well but you know with covet the whole world's watching and ukraine the whole world's watching and you know like everything is getting shaking and we're getting shaking i'm getting shaking i just feel myself right you know and churches are getting shakings and there's a shaking going on and brother brown said there would be you know it would happen in this age and it shows the sign of the end you know because he he's getting ready to make his final move you know the man was of the old order of creation now in union with christ he has become a new creation of god this new creation is not the old creation made over or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is a new creation it's another creation distinct from the other older one he's the first of the creation he was god created in the form of man now by his spirit he's creating many sons unto himself god's a creator creating himself a part of his creation i'm just firing through this now because it's like we are no longer a part of adam's creation adam's creation does not apply to us that's over there on the left there see the people in the world are under adam's creation and they will suffer and die under adam's creation the bride is in a different creation who are god men god women living within our human vessel to bring us to every image of of himself and we we have to come there we if you want to associate with the world and do the things of the world then you will die in adam's creation right romans 1 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound and in the commentaries that shall we continue under the old creation that grace may abound or shall we get into christ once you're in the christ then you're part of grace amen last slide revelation 3 14 this was talking about the beginning of the creation of god right and here how can i overcome and we ask that you you go out among the people he's praying here at the beginning and speak out that predestinated seed out there lord and bring it around in some way that the light will fall across the path lord for we believe that the hour is getting late the sun is swiftly sinking in the west then will soon be that time shall be no more time in eternity will blend together when god and his people blends together and we've as and we pray god that at that time that we will be numbered among those that will be blended into christ that's called his pride that's our prayer amen amen and the beginning amen lord bless you let's stand one
