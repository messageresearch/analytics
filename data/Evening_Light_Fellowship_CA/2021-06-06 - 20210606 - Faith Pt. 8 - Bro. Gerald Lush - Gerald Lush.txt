it's being spiritual amen by the grace of god so i trust that we really mean and really put our hearts into what we're seeing and what we're thinking and what we're praying amen amen amen don't come in here with the thoughts out there leave that leave that behind you amen to know this that is again the prophet reminded us the first one in church is the devil that's right oh yes he's the first one so he's easier to catch shoes here to catch young or old amen to make us negative amen just to put our faith down and put our religion up amen just be just just be religious just sing and and you can do this you can do that yeah but make sure it's in the spirit make sure it's in the holy ghost amen not the on holy ghost amen so remember satan is here and he he knows the word sure yeah god said right from the beginning amen he knew the word in genesis and he definitely definitely knows the word in revelation amen right down to the end of time and again he's come down with the bible says come down with great wrath knowing his time is short amen amen so we pray the grace of god that we got we got wisdom amen but again robert preached on wisdom versus faith amen but it's not intellectual wisdom we have spiritual wisdom it's in our souls amen but the the devil is still there oh yeah he knows what he knows what the same he knew he knew the message that god gave adam and eve and he knows the message that god has given us amen he said to them yeah if god said but and again he's saying to a lot of believers yeah as god said but amen just say get behind me satan i don't need your butts amen by the grace of god but he's there and and unfortunately there's many a believer that's that's believed the butts amen and again oh yeah i believe the message but again you've got to understand too that he only changed one word for eve amen but she believed them she made man he caused her to doubt and and go on oh yeah we're going to believe god or the devil amen in these last days who are we believing god or satan because god through the word through the message of a prophet he's laid it in what has happened and what is happening and what will happen and warning us that it's going to get worse oh yeah more deceiving so we're praying by the grace of god that we're going to have the simplicity of faith just to stay with the word amen and not necessarily understanding everything but it's believing what god has said and believing what god has done and believe what god is doing by the grace of god amen so god help us as we go into what he wants us to go into and that's his word amen come back to the word stay with the word know what the word said if you want to defeat the enemy defeating with the word amen that's our weapon amen but again of course the word is is activated by faith amen and do we have the kind of faith that god recognizes god is going to bless and do we have the evil yes even the kind of faith the devil recognizes amen and he he knows it and that's why that he's attempting to to change it that's why he's attempting to get you to believe it little air little there and so on oh yeah oh brothers is getting worse and worse and worse amen and just think after all that god did and after all that god revealed and you know when that sister asked the prophet and they oh uh what would you do or something like that if god actually gluten and pic pick the bride of christ she'll pick the believers out of this generation for the rapture oh and he oh my he said i might find a dozen why we got more than a dozen here so do we have the faith that god is looking for in in the dozen of do we have the faith that god is looking for in his seed in the last days and truly we are in the last days amen so please don't ignore it don't forget it and don't allow what what we want here in our flesh to overcome what god wants amen we're going to give preeminence not not to again our feelings even though they're sometimes religious but no we gotta have have the spiritual revelation of what god is doing amen we know what he did and so on and god bless what he did but now he's looking for something that that it's a present tense amen praise the lord so i pray grace to help us as we get go again into the word brother that we will truly have a true anointing that we'll truly have a holy ghost anointing amen amen and be careful be on your guard because the devil is there and he can anoint you yeah well he anointed eve and caused her to believe what he said amen so brother pray grace that we're they're coming here under the anointing of the holy ghost it's the anointing of christ in us the hope of glory amen by the grace of god that's what keeps us moving on moving on moving on amen do this do this no just go on and praise the lord amen to god be the glory amen so i pray grace as we get again into the word and into some more thoughts that i want to share with you regarding faith i was i figured maybe that in the last message we would finish it but again i i could have stopped and went on again maybe but uh to another subject but again it's it's been really on my heart and in my mind and my soul for quite a while and can't seem to back away from it because god wants to reveal this god wants us to know this and god wants us to know that amen so the lord has anointed me and he's been that put that burden on me amen to continue with the thoughts on faith amen and again this could be the conclusion of it i don't know but again we want to leave it with with with the lord amen because again i believe it's significant because the bible challenges our faith god challenges our faith believe us thou this amen and he and he challenge them with this challenge with that believers though this what about peter's faith and when he went when he walked under water well on my computer there that comes up that screensaver there pictures and i see one there of peter and jesus on the waters peter's in the water jesus is underwater as a lord i said oh no i said uber painted that good but i said he failed to recognize one thing because he had he had the painting of jesus there as if jesus was nervous and i said lord i said you're not nervous you created it it's under your control and and he should have been just relaxed in in the picture and walking because why even over there was peter done in the water and he was reaching out to peter to get him back up amen so i pray grace brother oh my see again that all due respect to the painter and god bless him or whoever it was amen but again there was a lack of that complete revelation that jesus wasn't nervous jesus knew he he wasn't going to sink into the water like peter did and he's not there watching himself oh oh oh that's the way that i what i saw under in the painting i said lord that's not what you wanted i said jesus walked on that like we would walk on the carpet here yeah or we would walk out there in the streets somewhere amen not nervous not afraid that we're going to stumble no no not by any means so i pray grace that we're going to have the real faith amen and again what is the real faith it is the faith that has no questions and has no doubt amen amen it believes god that's right this is absolutely tremendous for you to go out and do this or you either go ahead and do that amen you why because it's your faith you're believing god you're not worrying about the devil amen as one of the brethren brought out sometime regarding the challenge of satan just obviously he said just tell the devil the word amen quote the word go on amen so i pray the grace of god that we got we got more power over satan than satan got over us by the grace of god amen lord bless us let's stand and sing only believe all things are possible only believe yes believe the word amen believe jesus amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah all things are possible amen thank you lord hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah thank you jesus amen [Music]

yes all things are possible because we believe amen we absolutely believe the word of god amen amen yes jesus [Music] amen now i believe [Music] now i believe [Music] amen praise the name of the lord turn with me to luke chapter 24. luke 24 praise god for his word this is absolutely amazing the word the word of god amen and brother it's god's word genesis to revelation and the prophet highlighted the fact he said that one time he said i stood there and he said i had a bible in one hand and he said he had the something from the indian faith as it were and a book in the other hand and he said he just raised it up and he said there's only one that's right amen and the one of course was right is the word of god amen because amen when it comes to the word of god it's amazing how long this word has been with us amen it goes back even before time and as it comes right on down to time and into eternity my praise the lord by this word brother again if i pray grace that we are the seed of god believing the word amen you know what it does it gives us the faith and that's what we want to conclude today the lord willing is the thoughts we've given you on faith it's absolutely amazing amen and i want to share with you the number of times that faith is used in scripture where where shoes why it's jews and so on this is absolutely amazing so we know lord brother that that it's not just the the the religion out there no no because they got they got the writings of i don't know what his name is now and uh writings of them in a book and well that to them it's a bible like this one is to us amen but they but again what with the one that they're believing is still in the grave amen knowing that and there are those that that daily constantly there's somebody outside the grave on their guard oh yeah and then they did it then next some more comes in and fills in the more coming to fill in yeah but the power of god said well he said he's still there but he said the grave that we we remember is empty amen that's right amen he said jesus is not in the grave praise the name of the lord hallelujah i pray you're not in the grave spiritually amen that you're alive amen and god and god is in control praise the name of the lord you can go out and brother amen not talk it go and live it amen the power and the anointing of the holy ghost in me that's who's living the life why is it that oh you you reflect some of these things that are written in this book and i said yeah why because you are the seed of god amen through the word praise the lord it's like the brother wrote me and he said oh he said i don't believe the bible he said i read it three times and he said it's full of mistakes and i did as i said i wrote back and and say well i said god wrote his bible in a way i said to bring it what's in you amen god wrote in such a way to bring out what's in the believer the make-believer the unbeliever amen oh yeah so they can read it and the devil will show them and they all the wrong believers or they'll read and the devil will show them this and they'll add this take away this and yeah and they're they're make believers amen so this as the proud of god said there's three kinds of believers and he's the true holy ghost believer a make-believer and an unbeliever amen and he referred to them those other ones not the believer but to the make-believers he said they're judas tyrion's pretended brothers amen so i pray the grace of god that we're not in a pretended brotherhood amen we're in the holy ghost brotherhood amen so that we have we have we both had the same life the same hunger the same thirst the same love for the word of god and for god oh yes by the grace of god so god help us as we will endeavor to go to the word and bring forth some more thoughts regarding faith and it's absolutely amazing yeah it's amazing it's amazing that we still have this book it's amazing oh that brother as it was in the beginning so it is in the end faith comes by hearing the word amen there's no other place for to find the faith that pleases god but only in this book amen that i believe as i challenged that brother and i said this this this this so i said are you a believer or a make-believer i said you let me know never heard from them amen so i pray god that we are believers amen brother not just in our heads in our hearts and that's where god is looking for the word is in your heart that's where god is looking for your faith it's in your heart amen by the grace of god faith what is faith amen it's absolute complete trust in god and in his word amen no question no doubt amen faith answers all questions and dissolves all doubt amen amen praise the lord so in luke chapter 24 and let's begin to read it verse 13. amen and pilate when he had called to gather the chief priests and the rulers of the people saith unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i have examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him no nor yet arid for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him i will therefore chastise him and release him grace for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into the prison but pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them but they cried saying crucify him crucify him and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath eat done amen grace of god i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go grace and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed grace and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required and he released unto them him that was that forced sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to their will brother brother let's not focus on yeah oh the on caesar's law you could do this and they could do that yeah but let's focus on the law of god amen and as they led him away they laid upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also be wailed and lamented him amen god bless this word your baby seated and turn with me to the book of john chapter 5. amen considering all that the scripture expounds concerning faith we could go we could minister on and on and on for a long long time but i believe we can start on it and go on into the glory preaching the same thing amen and i'll i'll highlight some of those things to you concerning faith and and the preeminence of faith as in the word of god amen because considering the the preemis of faith as in the purpose of god the plan of god amen if there's anything in his purpose his plan or his pattern that god is looking for is faith amen so do we have the faith that pleases god amen he had the faith that pleased the devil amen how many of us got the faith that pleases god it's not what i want is what god wants amen and again not what not what the devil wants we want what god wants it's getting giving the preeminence to god it is a preemis giving yeah we're giving preeminence to his word we're giving preeminence to his his plan amen and his pattern that's why we're here because why because out there we were caught in that and we were not caught up in a revelation of the plan of god or the purpose of god just religion amen and man was getting the glory out of man amen get more and more and more added to the church but jesus i tell you this brother when jesus started to him he had too many how many preachers feel like they got too many but jesus felt he had too many and he and that's why brother he knew who knew what was going to happen when he when he said this and he said that and when he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you've got no life in you amen and i did 70 or 80 of his disciples walked back they said who can receive this just consider now the signs and the wonders and the power that jesus gave them to go do this go do that and they did it amen but when they came back and giving the glory to god amen and jesus challenged their faith amen and god is challenging our faith amen and then the oh yeah probably god said any faith is tested he says it's going to produce goods amen any faith that's tested is going to be revealed it's going to manifest itself in your life amen praise the lord and amen god is going to be able to show the world look there's faith that that that brother he got faith that sister she got faith amen gracious lord that we have the faith that pleases god amen not the faith that praises religion not the faith that pleases the just the the pastor amen or the minister it's the faith that pleases god amen so brother without no wonder the bible says without faith we can't please him we got to have faith and again the faith that he that he reveals amen and brother why is god revealing this why is god revealing that because we're going to give you the faith that will bring you closer to him amen your relationship with him and his relationship with you is becoming greater and greater because of the faith you have amen amen again that's why the way it says without faith it is impossible to please him amen so i trust we have the faith this morning that pleases god amen to god be the glory amen john was it chapter 5 and let's begin it read verse 39 amen god help us to do this search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which bear witness of me amen bear witness of jesus and he will not come to me that ye might have life i receive not honor from men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you brother jesus challenging their faith i am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name and ye will receive oh yeah they recognize this ministry that ministry we want him we want him we want jesus and jesus used that ministry that's fine praise the lord but let's give the glory to jesus not to the ministry amen amen that's right brother praise the lord amen and he said ye will not have come to me that ye might have life brother and anything we're looking for now is eternal life amen and then we're looking for no brother is not religion it's the revelation of the rapture amen that's taken us out of time and into eternity amen that we're leaving time and brother i tell you as we get close to that hour that that the bible warns us off the end of all things eternity is going to get more and more real to us amen and we're going to have less and less and less interest in time and more interest in eternity but i tell you this when it comes to concerning the rapture and and the resurrection unfortunately brother sister there's going to be a lot of believers a lot of people out there brother and and they're so caught up with this world and they're enjoying this world they're enjoying this i do this i do that no they're not focusing on him they're not focusing on jesus they're not focusing on the resurrection they're not focusing on the rapture amen and remember again to go to go in the rapture to get out of there we got to want to go amen and brother god whatever god has as ordained down through the ages he has given man whether in luther's age westernization of pentecostal age it was a hunger and thirst for a greater relationship with god amen they they want they wanted the oh to know god they wanted to love god amen so god did this and god did that amen but eventually just became formal and just religious but not spiritual amen because god is looking for spiritual sons and daughters of god amen so we're not interested in this world well i don't oh you can get caught up with your job oh yeah i i oh this is good lord uh would you delay your coming for another day uh so so i can i can do this oh yeah that's been on my heart for for quite a while i said the attitude of the spirit that people got because they're so caught up with the world oh oh lord no no no i i i can't go next week i can't go until may maybe the end of the year oh yes it's hard to believe that that people would have that that idea oh yes they do they they have that opinion and that feeling amen they they want it in their time not in god's time no wonder again the prophet of god said god is waiting on us amen amen wait what waiting for that revelation to take preeminence in our lives amen that morning noon and night we can't get away from it the resurrection the resurrection the rapture amen and we have a picture out here that i took out of a magazine that certain brother was was was printing amen and there in in the picture amen there's two brothers sitting in a room one looking at a window and the other one said he'd sit down with his bible in his hand yeah that's that's the drawing that they did and the question is they said how are you looking for the rapture amen and oh that man was there with a pair of binoculars and he was looking out the window what was he looking for rapture amen he's going to miss it amen but the other brother he was sitting down reading his bible what was he looking for the rapture amen amen why because the bible is going to reveal to us that you know the rapture how's god going to do it when is god going to do it amen by what means what will he use to to get us into the rapture amen by the grace of god to bring forth and again let us say it again the prophet of god said he said the dead are waiting on us amen god is waiting on us that's the truth but too many are being caught up with the world and the things of the world and brother that's that's why we are exhorted there in in the epistle of john bear with me amen it said right here in yeah first john and it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world and if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him amen and it is loving what you're doing is loving what you can do it's loving that you can go do this you can go do that oh yeah and it's not not necessarily sinful but it's challenging your faith oh yeah you can get you'll be caught up in this caught up in that out there in the world and it's not really sinful or anything like that but it is entering your faith and your and your and it's what does it do it's trying to get you more cut out with this and with this and with this rather than the resurrection of the rapture brother to be caught up with the resurrection rapture you've got to be in contact with another dimension amen you've got to be under control by the anointing and power that's in another dimension by the grace of god what dimension was jesus in that he oh i can't stay no longer with you i got to go brother he had such a power there such a revelation such a faith in that flesh that he was in oh yeah he wasn't he wasn't caught up with what's going on in the world he was cut out what was going on in that other dimension amen and he oh he felt the pool back to eternity yeah he felt the blow back to eternity and who can't go up he said but he that came down even he that is in heaven that was himself he was going to go he wanted to get back to that to that body amen that he was in praise the lord representing amen it's ministry to you and me to redeem us amen and brother hallelujah he was focusing on the word the word the word what god was promising and prophesying amen and he knew he was approaching that hour when he would get out of here back to eternity but he also knew that but he would suffer amen but how how about you and me amen are we as conscious of eternity as jesus was amen are we as conscious of the resurrection rapture as jesus was amen he knew i i come to do this and then i'm going back home and he was getting near the end of his ministry getting to that place amen where oh he would fulfill what he was ordained to do to redeem us amen and brother and the believers have after that the believers amen we're fulfilling what they were ordained to do to take their stand for the word amen and laid their lives down for the word amen as jesus laid his life down for them now we lay our lives down for the word amen so you're not living for yourself you're living for the word amen this is the word because we're living in this day we're living in this hour amen by the grace of god oh yeah we see this going on in the world oh praise the lord well you know what the world thinks oh oh the lord's coming the lord is coming what what do you mean oh yeah he promised he'd come back again and we see all these signs yes but it's a sign of the resurrection and the rapture amen amen and now it is christ in the bride but for to bring to pass the resurrection and the rapture amen so brother for the elect of god the seed of god as it was with jesus so it is with christ in our flesh that we hunger and thirst for the resurrection well we can't get away from it we want to we want the rapture amen we want to get out of here into time where there is no more sin amen we want to get into that dimension where there is nothing negative everything is positive amen and the love is genuine oh yeah it's not a put on it's a real genuine love by the grace of god amen he loved us and he oh yeah this is the kind of love he wanted to get in us amen and because of what he did and the revelation of jesus the revelation of god amen doing this doing this doing that amen is producing in the broad a love for him we love you jesus and it struck me a couple days ago i was thinking about it i said lord forgive us forgive us lord not considering what you did for us now considering what you endured for us oh my lord don't don't let us take it for granted oh yeah i'm saved because jesus did this did that oh but he did it to challenge our faith and he did it that way to bring forth his plan in your life his purpose in your life his pattern in your life to bring forth love amen brother and that's why he's doing it for you and me bring forth love amen as he loved us so we would love him amen and again love not the world neither the things that are in the world and if any man love the world and the love of the father is not in it the world and the things in the world amen or you can say well it's not this is not sinful no there's nothing wrong with that yes the only thing wrong with that is that it can enter you from getting into rapture that's the only thing wrong with it and amen you're getting caught up with these these things going on in the world and you can do this you can do that amen oh yeah anything they're doing is doing to do to get your fellowship to get your your love for that all your attention you're distracting it from jesus or to all that's going on oh yeah praise the lord if you're doing this they're doing that amen thank god for the witness that we have had with i don't know their names now but there was a a group in our group a man and his wife and they were singers here in newfoundland some years ago and a number of years ago we dealt with them and we have fellowship with them and eventually of course his wife died many many years ago but i remember going visiting him one time and and we came out and we were talking about this talking about that and he said pastor he said i got to agree with you he said what you're saying is exactly right and he said i see the same thing amen yeah and what what church did they originally belong to i think it was roman catholic and and they were there when we visited them just to tie with the word amen i i don't know where he is now but his wife died not quite a few years ago and it was a number of uh just a few years ago that we i had the last time i had communion with them not communion but i have fellowship with them amen and we're discussing certain things at the time at that time of the year it was something the world was getting cut out with everybody's getting caught up with yes it is it is and he said pastor he said i agree with you he said i'm not getting caught up with that he said to me that's that's that's worldliness amen oh god rest his soul wherever he is amen so brother i trust by grace where that they not they didn't get caught up with the foolish that's going on in the world and get attracted to oh we got to go here i would like to be part of this and part of that yeah no brother if you're a seed of god you want to get back to eternity that's the truth amen morning noon and night will this be the day of the resurrection will this be the hour for the resurrect please lord help me the lord that i'm not i'm not looking with a pair of binoculars i'm looking for the word amen amen and as i look into the word i find that more and more and more of the word is being fulfilled more and more of the word is coming to pass amen so i pray grace lord that we're going to be on our guard amen for the resurrection we're going to be on our guard for the rapture brother of anything god has done in this hour amen through the word of god through the message of the hours to give us that perfect faith that's right amen that's not caught up with the world but it's caught up with what god is doing amen that we're more caught up with that more more sensitive to the resurrection more sensitive to the rapture than we are to the foolishness of this world amen and like i said there's a lot of things you could get involved over there not necessarily sinful but if i'll tell you this it's the devil amen distracting you from what god's doing amen and he knows what to do like he knew what to do with eve oh yeah when he saw her go do go go here go here go there do this do this yeah and so he he was right there but it not none and to give it to her and to make her believe that she was still in the faith or you still got faith yeah yes god said but i say unto you and so on amen and now satan is in this hour and brother it's not just trying to get you out there into into absolute sinful things no just right now it's just trying to just to distract you from what god's doing to what you can get involved in you can do this you can do that get there behind me satan you can do that amen amen praise the lord amen but god through the word is looking for our full attention oh yeah now give half of it to god and then oh i'll do the rest no it's got god in control completely amen god in control morning noon and night amen jesus was our example amen he came and lived that life amen not just to lay it down but he wanted to live that life so you'll know what god's requiring of the life you live amen and then he went and laid it down to redeem us and brother it's like i said it struck me i said oh lord you did that to redeem me lord please there's too many takes for granted there's too many lord it takes them too lightly i said how many are really getting into the revelation of redemption and what and the price that jesus paid for us the pain he endured the agony he went through it was for you again it's just like our i heard our brother green preaching one time and and he was talking about you know who crucified the lord where are those that did it and he said he walked somewhere and he went down some steps and he saw on the side there was a mirror and he saw himself in the mirror oh he said that's who crucified the lord yeah we want to blame this one blame that one brother he did it for you amen he did it for me and i said lord you you endured that that agony that suffering that pain and that death to redeem me my god have mercy on me i said lord forgive me brother that's why the bible encourages us to identify with him in his suffering yeah we thank god for what he did now lord we want to identify with you what you did amen brother oh we're going to get happy we're going to be at this have this have that yeah we'll have it when we get the glory amen the devils are distracted in this world and in this dimension amen but jesus is there to get us out of this dimension and into another one and that's when we're really going to have the eternal divine love of god as i said oh my to get into that realm where there's no more sin and there's no more nothing negative nothing no now we're not not just caught up with this cut out with that now we're caught up with eternity we're caught up with god caught up with the seed of god for the glory of god amen so where's your faith taking you amen or is just making you more relaxed in this world faith is not not ordained to do that amen let's get the right revelation of god amen for the glory of god and again as as they were saying in that fellowship it wasn't here but and we're all a lot of believers and the deacons of a certain church and and this preacher and this preacher and that preacher oh yeah and uh and there was a preacher there and also from uh from the united states he's gone on now but again the the deacons were talking about the word and discussing this discussing that and they turned to that preacher and they said oh they said brother answer me a question and uh he said what is the importance of the seals the seven seals mystery revelation and he said always said uh because he said oh yeah jesus he said pray preached on this preached on that and he said is is the seals he said brother if the seals is important he says some preachers say and the preacher they asked he said well he said he brother ministered on the seals but my brother brown ministry he said on the church ages he ministered a series on daniel he did this series and so on and he said uh and the seven seals he said was not just another series and i i oh lord i said they need more understanding and i said excuse me brother i said i don't mean to disagree and i said all due respect to you but i said brother brown i said did preach a series on the seals he did preach a series on daniel and and on the jews and so on and i said but it wasn't the same as his series on the seals well what what do you mean i said well i said before the seals he kept pointing to the seals that god was going to do this and god was going to do that and then after the seals i said he kept pointing back to the seals i said why because i said the seals were significant to give us a greater understanding of the church ages a great understanding of the daniel series it was the mystery of god being revealed to give us rapturing faith oh that right well brother that's what i feel now i said we can agree to disagree so we left it with that but not long after that i and now that i was sitting at a table with that preacher again and another preacher and he asked questions asked this to the preacher and he answered this way he answered that way and i said well i said brother the word says this because the question that he answered you know was in the word but the pastor the preacher that was answering he didn't i like that and to finally i let him answer and i said well i said i said brothers i said again don't mean to disagree keep our spirit right and our attitude right but the word says this and the word says that of course later not long after that that brother preaches a series on the word doctrine what do you mean oh because there's so many preachers out there talking about the word the word the word amen oh yeah the word says this this is the word this is the word and he preached oh yes there's preachers after now he said they got that word doctrine that's all they're talking about the word the word the word says this and the word says that no yeah and i said no it's not that i said it it's giving jesus the glory giving jesus to preeminence praise the lord amen so brother alpha god help us amen to get into the faith stay in the faith live in the faith amen and let our lives reflect the faith and what is the faith it is the revelation of what god requires and what god wants us to have amen the resurrection the rapture amen whatever god wanted to do he'll send down the anointing to create in in his seed sons and daughters regardless of the age that it is amen the holy ghost is there to create and bring forth the hunger and thirst for virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and the fullness of the goddess and the baptism of the holy ghost amen it was made flesh made flesh in the bride now it was made fresh in jesus now it's made flesh and the bride amen by the grace of almighty god because they were all pointing to pointing to calvin all pointing to jesus and now we're all playing to the revealed word in this hour amen oh yeah they crucified him then now they crucify him now and unfortunately there's even believers that are crucifying him amen god's doing this they don't want to believe that god's doing that didn't want to believe this no no brother or uh they're there now they're getting carnal as i said lord don't come today because i got things to do and lord i i well you know what you you're enjoying that and you're loving those things more than you love him amen that's the truth because i i've gone through those scriptures a number of times as the lord i said what does it mean that they love the world love not the world he said neither the things that are in the world and he said if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him if we're more caught up with these things going out to the world no the love of god is not in us amen if the law of god is in us brother it just turns everything off shuts it down cuts it off cuts us off from all what's going on over there we're not gonna get caught up with this and with that no indeed we're caught up with the revelation of jesus caught up with the revelation of the yeah the resurrection of the rapture and the marriage supper of the lamb amen just too many as i said over the years they got caught up with this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine amen but ignoring exactly why god did all of that amen what's god looking for now brother he's gone beyond looking for the looking for this doctrine and that doctrine you believe this you believe that oh yeah all of that points to the resurrection rapture that's what he wants that's the faith he's looking for amen amen resurrection and rapturing faith is what god is looking for that's right in you and in me amen so how many of us are dying to more and more and more to the world and becoming more and more alive to the word amen because amen we've got to come to this place the bible says the spirit and the bride say come right amen the prophet said interesting he said as long as the bride is there on earth he said there's grace that's right amen sorry brush brother we're going to have grace keep your attitude right your spirit right amen oh don't don't get caught up well look what what happened to judas oh he was in the word and he had this and he had that and the oh yeah he believed he was believing jesus jesus that amen but he was the one that betrayed jesus you know what he felt why in the world did judas do that he had the letter of the word amen and he felt maybe oh if if i do this then jesus would be he'd be forcing jesus to bring victory to the jews yeah because they were looking for victory from from the power that was reigning in israel of rome and they they were reigning israel they're controlling israel and they wrote and he wanted jesus oh jesus is going to do this the messiah is going to do this and so he felt well if i betrayed him he said he's going to he's going to just he's not going to let them do this he'll stand and do declare his power stop there stop there stop this no first he had to redeem us amen and then come back to share his life with us amen to encourage us that as he laid down his life for us we laid in our lives for him amen we're looking for jesus brother sister let's focus on christ amen considering what he did for us let's focus on him yeah the price that he paid what he suffered and amen we got and what your you want to declare your love that you have for how many of us love jesus there are those that love this they love that the oil comes to the world amen again again they were loving the world and they're loving the things of the world yeah not necessarily absolutely sinful things but it's a spirit of unbelief it's a spirit of unbelief that you believe this but you don't won't believe that i don't think this is necessarily god means for us to do this or that what did he do he was the example amen our lord jesus christ grace of god amen bear with me see sorry amen again let me read it again search the scriptures amen for in them you think ye have eternal life oh search it because in them you think you got eternal life amen and they are they which testify of me amen but he says and ye will not come to me that ye might have life amen do you stay with the word the whole word nothing but the word that you might have eternal life amen for i receive not honor from men but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you amen and says i am come in my father's name and ye receive me not if another come shall come in his own name im ye will receive how can ye believe which receive honor of one of another and seek not the honor that cometh from god only amen god in control of our lives amen so i want to share with you some thoughts concerning the word and faith in the bible amen and the faith that the bible refers to is a strong conviction of the truth amen amen so do we have that strong conviction of the truth so the truth is going to control us and not just the letter of the word the truth the spiritual revelation and brother when it comes to it comes to faith that in the bible in the entire bible faith is referenced 231 times faith but notice the difference between the old and new testament in the old testament faith is reverence and respected and referred rather reverence and how many times and we know how many times that faith is in the old testament faith is in the old testament two times two yeah two just mentions faith and it's in deuteronomy and uh another one there advocate the prophet evident amen he mentioned faith once and deuteronomy is mentioned once that's all i thought my they would mention faith many more times no but in the new testament faith is referenced 229 times amen yeah amen why because through the through the new testament it is faith faith faith god has done this but where is your faith to believe it amen and the book of hebrews faith is mentioned 31 times so what if i were to preach on rev hebrews chapter 11 how long would it take me amen considering that in hebrews 11 faith is mentioned 23 times one chapter god help us amen that we're going to catch the revelation of faith or faith is a revelation yeah but we need the revelation of faith that's amen brother that we're going to get the real true revelation amen not the devil's impersonation of it and the satan is there to impersonate the revelation of faith amen so it is two times in the old testament and 229 in the new testament two in the old and it is referenced in to see 21 times that's what no yeah his reference no sorry in the old testament two times elia and in the in the old testament there's 36 six books in the bible in the old testament 36 books and the only mention faith twice amen and in the in the new testament there's 21 books in the new testament 21 and faith is mentioned 229 times 2 in the old 229 in the new amen brother are we putting our emphasis on the faith of the old testament or the new amen the grace of god and brother of the 229 times in the new testament in the book of hebrews faith is mentioned 31 times amen and in hebrews chapter 11 out of the 31 is 23 times in hebrews chapter 11 in one chapter so we could go say all right we're going to we're going to we're going to minister on hebrews 11. faith allah going to take us amen brother matthew can certainly take the clock down if we started on that amen brother because faith is mentioned 23 times in chapter 11. so brother is faith as important to us as it is in the word amen amen do we really seriously consider faith are we really seriously amen judging our faith by the word amen do we have faith in god absolutely amen god gave adam and eve the faith that they needed but the eve loved the devil to allow the devil to add to that faith just a word amen and put the world in the mess that it's in yeah god help us so brother out of the 229 times faith is in the new testament amen oh yeah the old testament faith deuteronomy and advocate and then on down to the new testament oh again bear with me 21 times thirty editing 36 books of the old 21 in the new amen and again faith is mentioned just twice in the old and 229 in the new by the grace of god and i i do have it listed here in all the books of the bible or the new testament our faith oh yeah just think of that how many times did john mention faith in the book of john once once amen and in the book of jude faith is mentioned twice in the book of revelation faith is mentioned four times amen of what god was looking for in his church in the church ages amen i trust he finds in us the faith that he's looking for now at the end where it's over with so what faith is god looking for well the prophet of god said god did this god revealed this god revealed that and he said what was it for he said to give us perfect faith amen what do we need perfect faith for we need perfect faith to get out of here into the resurrection and into the rapture amen brother the perfect faith god wasn't looking for the old testament but in the perfect faith in the new testament god's looking for in the churches and especially in the last days amen and again faith and this is where is mentioned the most in the new testament what book has got faith amen brother it's romans the book of romans amen challenging our faith in god and also amen because in romans faith is mentioned 34 times yeah and in the oh what about the book of hebrews brother they talk about faith yeah brother in hebrews faith is mentioned 31 times yeah 31 verse 34 in the romans but in the book of hebrews 31 times amen and brother of all the book of hebrews out of that 31 faith is mentioned 23 times in hebrews hebrews chapter 11. amen 23 times the importance of faith brother without faith you can't it is impossible to please god do you have the faith that i got faith i got this but you have the faith that pleases god amen so god help us to have the faith that he's looking for amen god else had the faith that brother that is ordained and predestinated to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen praise the name of the lord oh there's going to be a resurrection it's going to be going to be this the rapture yes but god is ordained according to the scripture you read the bible and see what god has done see what god's going to do and what he what he what he's doing in this hour is what revealing the mystery of god to give us rapturing faith so that we'll recognize the end we'll recognize that's gone and what we're looking for is what god as god as and what god is doing amen by the grace of god so i pray grace that we're going to have the faith that pleases god in these last days and if there's any faith that god's looking for it is perfect faith he's looking for why why in you and me yes because he fires god's concern work with that excuse amen considering what god has done we're with without excuse if there's anything god feels that he that he's right and expecting is perfect faith amen amen so god help us brother because god has sent the holy ghost ahead amen to creating us a hunger thirst for what he's going to do and what is he going to do resurrection rapture for the gentiles then he'll go back to israel so god help us we're not going to not going to get in god's way amen we're going to fall into a man we'll fall into the perfect will of god amen the pentecostals they just wanted more of what god did 100 years ago he want more of that more of that more of that no no because what god is doing is steps to go forward by grace i'm leading you on to this leading you on to that well what he did through pentecost was good amen but was opening the way for more and more of the power of god amen more and more the word to be revealed and to give us faith that god wants us to have now god help us not just for faith to say oh i believe god sent a prophet good why did he send the prophet amen let's get into why he sent the prophet as i've said i believe on wednesday that a number of for years believers just preached gossip and a prophet god sent a prophet and finally even i was highlighting it um among the preachers around the world that no that that that's not our evangelism that's right no no not by any means and yet many preachers around the world and especially in america and canada and england they're all they're all preaching goddess and a prophet god has sent a prophet and they sent their evangelists over to over to africa they sent their evangelists to india all over the world what for tell them god has sent a prophet yeah no now but of course that changed there rose another generation amen it was in 19 year old 70s and i sure 70 early 70s and on to 1977 is when when when the emphasis preachers begin to put themselves on the word amen that god has sent a messenger and he's revealed the word and revealed the mystery of god to give us faith for the resurrection rapture amen again brother brown did say to brother level he said brother lee he said irvine bale he said the older generation around this message back then in 1960s and he said they'll be gone before the rapture comes on he said they won't be here you should they'll be waiting for it in another dimension amen and brother that's the truth that older generation has gone on 55 years how close are we to the resurrection how close are we to the rapture i be brother i'll tell you this those who are close to it and those who are getting ready for it the faith that they live and the faith they manifest is going to be different they're going to look different talk different act different well yeah they're going to annoy that i believe they're going to get more and more and more separated onto the lord they're going to get more and more separated under the word more and more separated unto the revelation of what god's doing amen to give us rapturing faith by the grace of god and again in the message perfect faith august 1963 he said see he says so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith amen because the bible says faith is the substance of things over amen so god makes it more more real to us by faith by faith he reveals it to us and what's the only thing we can live for we're looking for the rapture we're looking for the resurrection we want to get out of here i pray god that that our young brothers and sisters here have that same revelation they want to get out of here amen not being caught up with the world or the things of the world but let's be caught up with the word amen so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you get you're getting you're getting into a bright material are you bright material amen well he said when you live by faith you're getting into bright material amen when you're getting ready for the rapture and the resurrection you're getting into bright material amen are you bride material not just church members right material and he said you're getting into a rapturing condition and he said that means for each one of us not just the pastor but rather he said deacons trustees and that means for the laity and every individual walks in a world with god alone amen god help us amen amen that we'll go forth with that life by the grace of god that we walk in the world with god alone that's right amen and he said you're baptized into his kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god amen and he gives the orders and you pack them out amen and he said whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere and he said you walk right on and if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it amen praise the lord now can't talk me out of it i caught up with this i come from there and i'm going back to there this is how i'm getting back amen praise the lord hallelujah but yet those believers get caught up with the foolishness of the world oh i'm a believer so you know i i believe the message yeah but again let me say it again make sure the message you're in the message the message is in you how many believers are in the message but how many believers got the message in or they're in the message not yeah message in them that's right amen if the message in you is going to produce a certain action certain reaction that's right oh yes you got a certain attitude you got a certain spirit you live a certain way talk a certain way amen but christ has got the preeminence spiritual you're going to live a spiritual life not a carnal life just not a religious life it's a spiritual life amen he said not a shadow of doubt nowhere and he said you walk right on and if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it oh god have mercy he said you go right on just the same and he said now issues are coming into perfect faith how many of us are coming into perfect faith your life will reveal it your attitude your spirit yeah oh what what gives him the life that he got what gives him the attitude that he got the spirit he got we got a revelation one revelation we got a revelation of the resurrection the rapture and he's and he's more caught up with that than he is what's going on in time god help us he said you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail now he said that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith so it is now with those who have perfect faith are mystic to others so are you a mystic to the world because of what you believe are you a mystic to the world regarding what you feel what you think what you say your conversation your life the life you're living is it a mystic to the world come on brother tell you it's gotta be more than just being here is not a mystic no it's living living a different life go there there's a life that controls you life controls you amen whether you're whether you're in fellows or with family or friends or neighbors no still the holy ghost controls you amen and he said you're a mystic to others oh they're always talking about this they don't do this they don't go here they won't do this they won't do that no oh no it's just a religion they're just they're just believing for the rapture they're believing for a resurrection they just wants that to come amen god's waiting on you that's why god's waiting on our bride's waiting on us too yeah the dating christ are waiting on us amen and brother the more we stay with the word and the more the world gets crazy the rather greater and greater we become a mystic to others oh yeah absolutely different jesus when he got started to get into his word amen oh my the more and more that he that he revealed the more and more that he preached the less and less of the others that wanted to believe him that wanted to follow him oh yeah my my my sue are you a mystic to others yeah you might be a mystic to your family you know ah that's what they believe now i'm sure brother chad is a mystic amen now he's a mystic to i always say is a mystic to family and friends neighbors either mystic even two church course amen yeah who's he well once you learn you won't forget praise the lord god help us to be a mystic yeah i can go back into church i attended and i said oh that brother was a mystic there all of the life that he lived or or might have been a woman in the life that she lived i was really mystics why because because they just live for god they live for jesus amen they're living for the resurrection living for the rapture or they were considered crazy maybe in in their thoughts in the conversation or they're just religious fanatics well jesus i guess they consider jesus a religious fanatic yeah and crucified him amen why because he was laying the word down to challenge their faith to make sure what is your faith what do you believe or what they just believed god was gonna send the messiah and that he would be born maybe in in the house of one of the one of the high priests in israel yeah and he would he would be raised up and do this and he'd raise up he would control them not just spiritually but to control them politically you know how on he would take control and give and deliver them from the from the power of the of the romans that's what a lot of people believe the messiah was to do yeah that's the messiah they wanted what for to make their natural lives different not their spiritual yeah amen so i pray grace brother that the god in his word is yeah he's challenging us our spiritual lives amen so we're going to live different talk different act different be separated oh yes completely it just happens amen but you know what we're you know where it brings us it brings us to that place where the prophet said we could just be a girl a boy or a man or a woman and he said you bring you to that place and he said you'll raise your hand and say lord we're coming home amen not lord will you take us if he's waiting on you he's waiting for you to come amen amen so we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us now to resist is to just simply turn him down just resist him and that is just walk away from the devil or from his thoughts amen bear with me again i'll try to bring it too close amen oh yeah i've shared this with the church a number of times he said this is coming into that third pole amen and it's the third pool of the open word in the mystery of god and he said i'm working out something and is taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in and he said to kind of raise faith in a bracket is it where you have never noticed it before he said not a faith but a perfect faith amen and he said built up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword amen that's right brothers it is the word believe us now this that's it believe us thou this amen well i believe the message what wait a minute you believe it but are you is it in you and are you in it amen yeah there's a lot they say they they they believe the message but they're not in the message and the message is not in them and as i said the prophet preached that to his own church he said you're in the message but the message is not in you what he preached that to his own people yeah he did nearing the end of his own ministry amen and brother what a challenge that caused brother ram to go off the earth the way that he did oh yes there was something going on in jeffersonville and he was on his way back to challenge it he's on his way back to correct it and to line it up amen he said this and he said that he knew somewhere he knew what was going what was going on amen but he was going back to challenge the individuals that were guilty of it you know god help us and god took him off the scene as on the internet there's somebody that saying they don't believe that william brown was the prophet and they'd left them left the message of william branham and they're highlighting you know well he was just a man and he couldn't do this he couldn't do that and they said then when we consider the way that god took him off the scene he said well you know if he was if he was a prophet of god and he was in the word of god and lined up with god and all that then why would god allow this to happen to take him off the scene well brother prophets in the bible i have gone off the scene with with something worse than that amen oh yeah most definitely go back to the word amen but that's on the internet and this is why they feel that we don't randomly don't they don't don't accept them don't accept this message and so on and there's a there's a gentleman there a young man they're giving that i guess he's in his 30s giving that faith because he was born and raised in the message but he's not a message believer and then there's another sister there that was born i guess raised in the message not a not a believer no no now they're another taking the negative stand toward the word toward what god has done oh yeah and just think some of them were their parents witnessed william branham their parents dealt with william branham oh yeah brother they just need to read the bible and they'll see a god allowed this this one to be taken that to be taken after seeing well look at the 68 million christians that laid down their lives during the dark ages oh yeah oh they were they were killed they were crucified they were burnt and everything else oh yeah again it's like he told that sister that if she didn't repent and and turn away from the what they were taking their stand for christianity that they were going to kill it they're going to kill her daughter just a young girl she said kill her she said i'll meet her in glory amen amen and again they were tormenting another another gentleman and praise the lord and uh oh yeah and they were sort of stretching him and stretching him and stretching him then they noticed this funny he's not reacting oh he seems like he feels good and they were putting more and more pain on him and then finally they stopped oh he said don't stop they said don't stop don't you feel it oh yes he said but it's wonderful he said wonderful he said see right there he said he said there's two angels right there stood stood next to the place where they had him tied down he said keep on going keep on going why he wasn't feeling any pain they were shocked yeah but he laid down his life for the gospel oh praise the lord brother considering 68 million suffered what they suffered did what they did endured what they endured laid down their lives and we think we can do anything we're just believers i think we'd be more than willing to suffer for the gospel sake more than willing take our stand for jesus more than willing to take our stand for the resurrection to rapture considering what all of them did when they laid down their lives as i said that and it happened in france and they were killing the people killing them killing them and they were charming after head because of their stand for the gospel and this man come by and he saw he saw them take this woman and took him up there and they were going to put her down and cut her head off and oh and this gentleman he saw he said wait wait wait wait no no he said don't do that he said let her go and he said take me take me take you yes take you yes he said let her go he said i'll i'll take her place yeah so they took her up and released her took him put him down and cut his cutie he was laying down his life for god not just for her it was for the lord they really did that they really did it amen so brother god help us that we'd be more than willing to take separation onto this word oh we'll be glad to have that separation amen amen because the more and more we experience that we can look up look up oh god grace amen he said i'm working out something to kind of raise faith into a bracket where you have never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect faith build up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a deserter of the thoughts of the heart and he said and what he said we are coming now to the perfection because people has to come to this in order for the rapture amen the ministry is is ordained amen and god is using the ministry to bring it to this perfection that's what god's been working on all those years here since our brother gerald's been here and now our brother jonathan corlett amen so we're what he's laying in the word leaning the word then to get the bride line up with the word line up with the word die to self-strap more of that word is in you more that word is manifested in your flesh amen praise the lord but we could also come to that place that jesus came to to lay down your life physically yeah but before that happens bride's taken home yeah thank the lord why because it's the hour of the resurrection listen he said we're coming now to that perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture and that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured faith and i'm looking for it it means a lot of shaking down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of god amen that's the truth without the lord in control we won't make it not my will lord thine be done grace that will have the right anointing and leadership in our lives by the grace of god it's like one time that sister barnes was doing something in her home and a visitor came and knocking on the door it was a believer and she opened the door for the believer to come in and by that time the believer had gone in through her main porch there and was up to the door going into her kitchen and so sister brown went there to open that door and when she opened that door the this believer said oh my oh my there's such a spirit she said he said here oh my it bothers me sister burns said sister she said it must have come with you because she said she said i have felt nothing but the holy spirit amen so she said you you brought it she said it's not me amen praise the lord oh yes sister brian was very oh yeah she was very conscious of what was going on and so on oh yes it's like i said to the time when that pentecostal couple was there with that child that used to swear and they told sister burns about it and they said oh she swears and we just can't get her to stop it oh sister bryan said oh my i'll pray for her. and i've thought sister brown has been on getting to getting the meal for him for that family and like i said when sister brian was slicing some bread there or something in her in her pantry and she heard the child started to swear and sister burns laid down the knife she laid down the bread and she stood and she turned around she walked out and walked walked through the door of the hallway leading into her living room and the child and her met in the doorway and this young girl yeah and sister byron said satan in the name of jesus christ come out of the child amen amen and oh something happened to the child anyway she stopped swearing yeah and two years later they came back and said sister thank you she hasn't sworn since sister brian's cast that evil spirit out god help us to be in the spirit amen led by the spirit amen because maybe there's a time when certain things that you've witnessed certain things you've experienced that god wants you to stop it sister burns did amen and it wasn't like i said it wasn't like t.l osborn who said he was a noisy a noisy pentecostal and and felt that that that you had to scream at the devil bawl at the devil shake the person and so on to get them healed amen no it's just a person sister byron just spoke the word yeah very quiet and here and here the child was delivered and as i said about when you see that film again of the 20th century prophet and you see our brother i don't know if you see him there or not brother osborne and he like it was shocked william what shocked our tommy osborne was the way that brother benham would cast out evil spirits i remember they used to do it the way the pentecostals did it the way tail osborne did it the way oral roberts would do it hey allen would do it and all the other evangelists back in those days and they and they they go and pray for the person and they shake the person and then they scream satan come out but they're absolutely shocked when william branham almost whispered it says satan come out of this child in the name of the lord jesus christ and then oh he said amen she said satan is gone now he said you're deliberate why because they thought william brandon would have to scream ball loud and they thought he would have to take the child or shake the child you know maybe maybe try to make the devil afraid or scared no no do i think that the devil scares the devil his faith holy ghost faith amen so i pray grace the brother it's not the natural stuff it's the spiritual what's more important what is what is what impresses the lord it's your spiritual life yeah so god help us and he said again the people have to come to this in order for the rapture and that's what's holding their way right now waiting waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured faith amen grace and brother to get into that you've got to you've got to keep under the ministry rapture rapture rapture resurrection amen look up the coming of the lord i pray grace when we come to look up we look up into the word and that you will notice that picture there in the hallway with the the man with the binoculars looking for the rapture he's looking at the window where's the rapture where's the rapture all the rapture's right here what that's up there yeah but the dead in christ will rise first right here then we which our line remains should be caught up together with them then we go off to meet jesus amen so i pray the grace of god give us that simple holy ghost faith we need it brother for me people got faith for this they got faith for that brother let's start with holy ghost faith start with a rapturing faith amen if we got a rapturing faith oh it's going to catch us all away from all the things that the devil is doing amen grace to us amen now he said don't you love him he said just think right here now already begun a work in your body and your healing because that he promised it would happen and he said did you catch what i was saying tonight and have you got the riddle he said as it is written if ye say to the mountain now he said don't doubt but believe what you said amen it's not he's it's not what he's saying it's what you say he put the word in in your lap he laid out later there for you're responsible amen he's done it he's delivered he's done this he's done that amen so now he wants you to go and manifest it oh i need this i need that okay speak the word lord why don't you do it no no no i give it i'm i'm well he's anointed he was in you so it's not you that speaks it's christ in you that speaks amen god help us amen if he say to the mountain and he said not if i say to it if you say it be thou cast into the sea and he said it'll go yeah because jesus said to that fig tree curse that no one eat of you forever and when they come back the fig tree was was dead yeah he spoke to it and he challenged them if you say to the mountain he said he'll do it god help us have that faith he said i'm your brother standing as your brother an intercessor try my best to hold you before god and i'm here right before the white throne he's appointing my finger to that bloody sacrifice and speaking through his name it is done amen thank god again that's the message a wonderful message perfect faith i figure as i advance my church what we believe in seeing as our advanced the people are and how they're really ready to take the sword and walk out in the front line and say i challenge satan i challenge you and you can't make me disbelieve anymore what are these things done for so that people will believe and the word was made flesh in you amen life in you made life in you amen he said the word of god is sharper than any two-edged sword any even discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen think of that the word of god is that a discerner of the intents of the heart amen powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the divining asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and mare of the bone amen the word made flesh hallelujah the word operating in human flesh by physical signs by material signs by scriptural signs perfectly to bring you or to bring to you a perfect faith for a perfect rapture amen rise he said and shake yourself pitch yourself the spirit is here and he knows you and you've got one thing to do and that's to believe it and accept it amen do you believe it he knows what's in you he knows what you are he knows what your desire is he knows what you have need of god help us have that simple faith by the grace of god amen perfect faith grace oh he said where should we be there's or that's perfect faith no vision just speak the word never saw the squirrel he just said the scripture what was it speak it and don't doubt and i took god at his word amen whatever you ask and if you say to the mountain be moved don't doubt he said but believe that what you have said will come to pass amen and he said that puts you back in the word now that's not skim milk and he said it puts you back i know it's going to jump over the top of you here because i can't anchor but real and he said genuine faith catches that right now praise the lord god be the glory god help us well perfect faith for the resurrection perfect faith for the rapture how are we going to get that well faith comes by hearing the word faith comes by hearing the message that god has given us in these last days to give us rapturing faith to give us faith of the resurrection amen by the grace of almighty god god help us it's not waiting for him to do it brother he's so he has come down with a greater and greater manifestation in the flesh amen to the extent that you do it he put it in you you speak the word amen by the grace of god god help us oh we want jesus do this jesus do that jesus do that no no jesus wants you to do it amen because the power that was in jesus is in the right god help us i'll finish with this here see your life proves what you are amen brother your life proves what you are your actions your reactions your attitude motives or objectives well it proves what what what governs you yeah proves what you are on the inside of the inside you're a christian if you're really truly born again amen my brother sister that's it you're it's not you that lives it's christ living in you christ we may like i said christ was made flesh to redeem us spiritually now christ is made flesh again to redeem us physically yeah in the flesh of the bride amen all god helped us to believe by the grace of god amen your life proves what you are your life how you live and how you talk and how you walk it doesn't make a difference if if you're in school if you're in home if you're in your job no matter what it is you're a christian and you act like a christian you talk like a christian you give the glory to god it's like when i was in in a store a huge store uh here in saint john's and uh i in one area there i saw a young man he was he was one of the team there working there and i'm not sure what brought the conversation between him and me and something came up and uh but just concerning something natural during the store and oh i looked at his name oh i said the lord bless you and i said that's good i said you put down chris christopher not chris i said some people just take the rest of it off i said but i said you you know what it means he wasn't sure to be christ-like and i said chris christopher and a lot of people just take said take it off he just put down chris not christopher so i said i said the lord bless you brother i said keep keep that keep the name and i said the lord the lord will honor you well we said thank you yeah so i don't know if he was a christian or not but i just struck me and so on because i used to when i would go to that certain store i used to go well sister betty was shopping and getting groceries and things that i would go around to different sections that i i'd be working there i work in in this in the store i'll be putting this together putting that together doing this oh yeah and they said others were coming what you don't work here do you no i said but i suggest my nature i said i i'm used to doing this stuff i said i've done that for years oh he said amazing thank you and i would do this again do this again you know amen and they would come and say thank you thank you thank you for what you're doing yeah i was trying to give you an example to them amen by the grace of god amen so brother says no matter where you are who you are you're going to be christian and what is a christian christ like amen you're christ like so how many living that life out there in the world among the world family friends and neighbors again are you living a christ-like life amen so that is not you is christ in you it's jesus living in you so if it's jesus living in you how would jesus react in in that situation oh jesus reacting in another situation amen what would jesus say what would jesus do amen oh brother god help us to truly lay down our lives for him and brother if you lay down your life for him you lay down your life for one another amen if he died for you you're willing to die for one another oh yeah grace of god oh he says see your life proves what you are we read it and he said the same thing christianity does your faith you have confidence in one another it's pure and there is something real and that you can't show it to somebody else you've got it yet he said you got it and your actions will prove it amen so he said and when you got pure unadulterated faith like your love is to your companion then you prove it the way you act and he said you ain't complaining no more you know it's done so he said see he said love and faith has to go together and he said they are kids folks and he said love produces faith amen god help us have the love that produces faith the prophet preached on faith by experience if you have faith and your faith is tested it will produce goods amen if your faith is tested and again the prophet highlighted have faith in god amen and he preached on there is a fundamental foundation for faith amen the faith the foundation for faith is the word of god amen and again the prophet highlights that works is faith expressed so as your works express your faith what you do amen for for one another as believers that's that's first and foremost then that shows your faith amen by the grace of god and then it goes on to others what you do to others is expression of your faith amen again it's not you that lives christ is living in us and he said again and besides this there's a lot of other booklets in there on faith and he said faith without works is dead because he said works is faith expressed amen and faith is the substance amen by the grace of god real true holy ghost faith and one more wisdom versus faith amen you can you can know the word and still not have faith it is written it is written it is written but brother you got to have a love for it as it loved you and you lay down your life for the word amen as the word laid down his life for you by the grace of god amen so i pray lord in the name of jesus give us faith a greater faith a greater faith and brother it comes through the word faith comes by hearing the word trusting that you heard the word today and i'll give you the faith that god's going to look for you after the service faith that's going to control you yeah faith that's going to lead you a faith that's going to counsel you amen oh yeah so the grace of god be with us soul body and spirit again he said i have a greater witness than that of john for the works which the father had given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father has sent me amen and what you do and how you do it amen they bear witness that you're a christian and the father himself which has sent me at born witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent m ye believe not amen grace search the scriptures for in them you think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me well brothers and scriptures is testifying of him the scriptures is testifying of the bride and the bridegroom and the resurrection and rapture amen god help us to keep moving on keep looking up for the resurrection keep looking up for the rapture amen and when i say look up in your faith not your eyes out there and you need a pair of binoculars no you don't need that brother well if you need a binocular it's got to be spiritual in your heart amen it's tremendous when you see that that brother sitting down in the chair reading his bible why because he's looking for the rapture amen and rapturing faith is in the word god bless you let's stand amen let's sing let's see 375 years i spent in vanity and pride carry not my lord was crucified amen and knowing not for it was for me he died

his brother hates noah's brother tom's son and then and he said he goes to see brother tom and he usually prays for him and while he's in the hospital and uh of course brother tom is right into that and uh you know he's there to say amen and so on so we'll pray the grace of god to help brother tom amen and of course he's 80 i think 86 years old shall the lord bless you as he presses on because i
