[1:25:56] you're gonna have the spirit that jesus
[1:25:57] said amen oh yeah well the disciples
[1:26:00] were gonna condemn jesus because of his
[1:26:02] attitude toward the scribes and
[1:26:03] pharisees and so on amen but jesus in
[1:26:06] the grace that he was showing his
[1:26:07] disciples he was showing to the scribes
[1:26:09] and pharisees oh yeah he knew who they
[1:26:12] were he knew if they could believe or
[1:26:14] not but yet he was extending grace to
[1:26:16] them
[1:26:17] brother god help us to add that grace to
[1:26:20] family friends and neighbors we're not
[1:26:22] there to condemn when they're they're

[1:26:29] amen to encourage them
[1:26:31] by the grace of god
[1:26:33] amen so
[1:26:34] and yet there's a lot of so-called
[1:26:36] believers
[1:26:37] and because of their attitude and spirit
[1:26:39] or the family looks down on them not
[1:26:41] only because why because they're there
[1:26:43] to condemn this and condemn this and
[1:26:44] condemn this brother
[1:26:46] if you're if you're a christian you're
[1:26:48] there to reflect jesus amen
[1:26:51] and if you're going to reflect jesus oh
[1:26:52] my what a spirit you're going to have
[1:26:54] what anointing you're going to have amen
[1:26:56] you're going to reflect the word you're
[1:26:58] going to point them to the word amen
[1:27:01] amen and you're going to reflect the
[1:27:03] love of god

[1:27:23] attitude and the right spirit stay with
[1:27:25] the word but keep your attitude right in
[1:27:27] your spirit rate amen by the grace of
[1:27:30] god jesus was there
[1:27:32] brother o praise the lord his attitude
[1:27:34] is spirit was the attitude and spirit of
[1:27:36] redemption
[1:27:38] he wanted to redeem them
[1:27:39] amen hallelujah so i pray that grace of
[1:27:42] god that we want by the grace of god but
[1:27:45] the witness we give to bring them to
[1:27:47] redemption for the glory of god brother
[1:27:52] we want to start with faith
[1:27:54] but then we got to move
[1:27:55] to sight
[1:27:57] and god wants to make that that faith
[1:27:59] flesh in us
[1:28:01] amen it's not just thoughts in your head
[1:28:04] and feelings you know in my mind and so
[1:28:06] on that you can't explain no no faith
[1:28:10] faith is going to be the life of god
[1:28:12] faith is going to be the word of god yes
[1:28:13] but he's not there to condemn you he's
[1:28:15] there to encourage you
[1:28:17] amen with the word
[1:28:19] so again
[1:28:22] i'm not sure what what verse it was
[1:28:25] let's go to verse 3 concerning the word
[1:28:28] and he said all things were made by him
[1:28:30] and without him was not anything made
[1:28:32] that was made
[1:28:34] in him was life and it was eternal life
[1:28:37] and the life was the light of men amen
[1:28:41] you've got eternal light life you've got
[1:28:43] light amen the light of god
[1:28:46] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:28:48] the darkness comprehended it not
[1:28:51] and there was a man sent from god whose
[1:28:54] name was john the same came for a
[1:28:57] witness
[1:28:58] to bear witness of the light
[1:29:01] that all men through him might believe
[1:29:05] he was not that light
[1:29:07] but
[1:29:08] he was sent to bear witness of that
[1:29:10] light amen he was said to reflect that
[1:29:13] light amen and so we are also of course
[1:29:18] now through the baptism of the holy
[1:29:19] ghost we also become the light the light
[1:29:22] was with us the light is in us amen
[1:29:24] moving us on to eternity by the grace of
[1:29:27] god
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] and he said that was the true light
[1:29:32] which light of every man that cometh
[1:29:33] into the world and he was in the world
[1:29:36] and the world was made by him and the
[1:29:38] world knew him not
[1:29:41] amen
[1:29:43] he came unto his own and his own
[1:29:44] received him not
[1:29:47] but as many as received him to them gave
[1:29:50] a power to become the sons of god
[1:29:53] even to them that believe on his name
[1:29:57] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:29:59] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:30:02] but of god
[1:30:05] amen and
[1:30:07] then it says and the word was made flesh
[1:30:09] and dwelt among us got news the word is
[1:30:12] made flesh again and dwells among us
[1:30:15] the word is made flesh and dwelt in us
[1:30:18] amen
[1:30:20] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[1:30:23] the only begotten of the father full of
[1:30:26] grace and truth amen trusting that we
[1:30:29] have that grace and we have that truth
[1:30:32] in us amen
[1:30:34] a confirmation a witness
[1:30:36] the word made flesh in you
[1:30:39] the word may flesh in me
[1:30:41] amen and if it's truly flesh in us amen
[1:30:44] brother we got grace and we got the
[1:30:46] truth by the grace of god
[1:30:49] turn with me to john chapter 5
[1:30:53] amen
[1:30:57] to reflect the light of the world is to
[1:30:59] reflect jesus
[1:31:00] to reflect the light of the world is to
[1:31:02] reflect his word amen
[1:31:04] because the word is light
[1:31:07] and in him is no darkness at all
[1:31:09] john chapter 5 and beginning to read at
[1:31:12] verse 14.
[1:31:18] after where jesus findeth them in the
[1:31:20] temple and said unto him behold thou art
[1:31:23] made whole sin no more
[1:31:26] lest the worst thing come unto thee
[1:31:29] amen he has redeemed you
[1:31:31] the man departed and told the jews that
[1:31:34] it was jesus which had made him whole
[1:31:38] and there did the jews persecute jesus
[1:31:41] therefore did the jews persecute jesus
[1:31:43] and sought to slay him
[1:31:45] because he had done these things on the
[1:31:48] sabbath day his spirit was right his
[1:31:50] attitude was right
[1:31:51] but again they were judging him by the
[1:31:52] letter of the word
[1:31:54] amen
[1:31:56] because he did this on the sabbath day
[1:31:58] and jesus answered them my father worker
[1:32:00] the other two and i work and therefore
[1:32:02] the jews sought the more to kill him
[1:32:05] because he had not only had broken the
[1:32:07] sabbath but
[1:32:09] said also that god was his father making
[1:32:12] himself equal with god
[1:32:14] grace lord that we're going to make
[1:32:16] ourselves equal with god
[1:32:18] because the word was made flesh in
[1:32:20] christ and christ has made flesh in you
[1:32:22] and me amen by the grace of god
[1:32:25] hallelujah and brother i've highlighted
[1:32:28] even this concerning the sabbath here to
[1:32:30] certain
[1:32:32] of people that i know of that believe in
[1:32:34] a saturday sabbath and that you got to
[1:32:37] you got to keep saturday sabbath not
[1:32:38] sunday and so on so i've expressed to
[1:32:41] them i said well i said one of the
[1:32:42] reasons they crucified jesus was because
[1:32:44] he broke their sabbath and they said
[1:32:46] what
[1:32:47] i said yes
[1:32:48] i said the sabbath you're trying to get
[1:32:50] us to keep i said i said jesus broke it
[1:32:54] amen and i said oh i want to let you
[1:32:56] know too and i said it's not sunday
[1:32:58] no no i said you cease from your dead
[1:33:00] works of sin not one day a week you
[1:33:02] cease from your dead works of sin seven
[1:33:04] days a week
[1:33:05] amen and you enter into god's sabbath
[1:33:09] i said our lord jesus christ amen
[1:33:12] oh never heard that before well i said
[1:33:14] you've heard it now
[1:33:16] amen and that's the truth
[1:33:18] amen
[1:33:19] so brother sister
[1:33:20] i trust we're we're experiencing god's
[1:33:22] sabbath
[1:33:23] amen that we are in his sabbath seven
[1:33:26] days a week why because we cease from
[1:33:28] our dead works of sin seven days a week
[1:33:30] amen by the grace of god praise the name
[1:33:33] of the lord
[1:33:34] hallelujah
[1:33:36] so brother sister i pray grace god help
[1:33:39] us
[1:33:40] with our faith
[1:33:41] to move to sight
[1:33:44] and that will go from faith
[1:33:46] to experience amen now we've got faith
[1:33:49] but they got no experience
[1:33:51] no no only oh yeah i believe this that's
[1:33:54] the letter of the word i believe this i
[1:33:56] believe that and but it's all in their
[1:33:57] heads but brother god is in the heart
[1:34:00] amen
[1:34:02] the law was all for the law the old
[1:34:05] testament it was mainly on you know in
[1:34:07] their heads it was the letter of the
[1:34:09] word and so on don't do this don't do
[1:34:11] this don't do that you got to do this do
[1:34:13] this do this but jesus came amen to put
[1:34:16] the power and the anointing of the world
[1:34:18] of the life on the inside in their
[1:34:20] hearts so brother sisters not that they
[1:34:22] had to go by the letter the word oh i
[1:34:24] got to do this i got to do this i can't
[1:34:25] do this i can't do that no no now
[1:34:28] because you're born again it's your
[1:34:29] nature
[1:34:30] amen it's the nature of god in you it is
[1:34:32] the nature of jesus in you amen and by
[1:34:35] the grace of god you're going to go
[1:34:36] forth and bring forth the word and the
[1:34:39] will of god you're going to go forth and
[1:34:41] stay with the word of god amen you're
[1:34:43] going to go forth and be a witness of
[1:34:45] the will of god for the hour and for the
[1:34:47] age in which you're living amen brothers
[1:34:50] night to go and when just witness her oh
[1:34:52] yeah yesterday yesterday yesterday this
[1:34:54] this god did this god did that what is
[1:34:56] god doing amen and what will god do amen
[1:35:01] again for for religion around the world
[1:35:03] is mainly focusing on what god did but
[1:35:06] but how many are caught up with what god
[1:35:08] is doing
[1:35:09] how many are really into the revelation
[1:35:11] of what god is doing oh yeah they got a
[1:35:13] revelation of what god did back down
[1:35:15] down through the ages but what about
[1:35:17] what god doing now brother amen don't
[1:35:19] mind there was a time when god did this
[1:35:21] and and he was looking for the faith of
[1:35:24] of this this son or this daughter to
[1:35:26] believe what he was doing in their day
[1:35:28] and in the hour because again you read
[1:35:31] hebrews 11 it is by faith that abel
[1:35:33] often offered unto god a more excellent
[1:35:35] sacrifice amen why because according to
[1:35:38] the hour that he was living in according
[1:35:40] to the the day he was living amen
[1:35:43] according to the will of god for that
[1:35:44] hour amen he add the revelation of the
[1:35:47] will of god amen back there and brother
[1:35:50] what he did he went out and offered this
[1:35:52] sacrifice it was based on his faith it
[1:35:55] was based on what god had revealed to
[1:35:57] abel
[1:35:58] amen brother what cain did wasn't based
[1:36:01] on the revelation of
[1:36:03] god in cain's heart and soul not by any
[1:36:05] means because god didn't require what
[1:36:07] cain had there amen but brother i tell
[1:36:10] you this god required what evil at amen
[1:36:13] came oh yeah maybe we would appreciate
[1:36:15] what cain had oh this is wonderful
[1:36:17] hallelujah oh my we we got enough here
[1:36:20] uh that we can go live on this now for
[1:36:22] the next few days maybe live on it for a
[1:36:24] few weeks or whatever why because cain
[1:36:26] had made a sacrifice there of all the
[1:36:29] things that he grew growed on a farm
[1:36:31] amen but here's abel down there as i've
[1:36:33] said before here's abel down there at
[1:36:36] his altar amen abel what are you going
[1:36:39] to do
[1:36:41] abel you took this lamb you killed it
[1:36:43] you shed his blood and his blood is all
[1:36:45] over you and his blood is all over over
[1:36:47] the altar
[1:36:48] to cain it was a mess amen
[1:36:51] but to to to abel it was redemption
[1:36:54] amen to abel it was salvation oh my
[1:36:58] brother and sister and the stand that we
[1:37:00] take and brother and the separation that
[1:37:02] it brings us
[1:37:03] when it comes to the word amen we take
[1:37:06] our stand for the word and brother we
[1:37:08] let the word have control and the word
[1:37:10] brings us to a soul to separation from
[1:37:11] unbelief amen
[1:37:14] because god's word calls for a total
[1:37:16] separation from unbelief amen praise the
[1:37:20] lord brother whether regardless of the
[1:37:22] age which the word is revealed brother i
[1:37:25] tell you this those that believed it
[1:37:26] were totally separated from unbelief
[1:37:29] amen brother amazing how that when god
[1:37:32] when god where god revealed it to what
[1:37:33] to john wesley or martin luther rather
[1:37:36] when god revealed to him another amen it
[1:37:38] served him from unbelief oh yeah it
[1:37:41] separated him from the church that he
[1:37:43] was associated with it's not that he had
[1:37:45] anything against the church he took his
[1:37:47] stand for the word and when they
[1:37:49] challenged him concerning what he was
[1:37:50] preaching concerning what he was saying
[1:37:53] about the just shall live by faith oh
[1:37:56] luther we're going to do this we're
[1:37:58] going to do that and son don't do this
[1:38:00] don't you do that don't you don't you
[1:38:01] say this and luther said here i can
[1:38:03] stand i can do no other may god help me
[1:38:06] amen that's right and so and they
[1:38:09] threatened they weren't going to kill
[1:38:10] him but luther
[1:38:11] just walked out amen and of course we
[1:38:14] know that some of the soldiers there
[1:38:16] took luther and hid him away why because
[1:38:18] they wanted to save his life
[1:38:21] but he was taking his stand for the word
[1:38:23] for that hour amen and he walked on and
[1:38:26] the lutherans they walked on with that
[1:38:28] revelation until amen until god gave
[1:38:31] another revelation and they they added
[1:38:33] that to the word of god amen it was god
[1:38:35] heading to his word god revealed his
[1:38:36] word justification sanctification
[1:38:39] baptism of the holy ghost gifts of the
[1:38:40] spirit amen and now the revelation the
[1:38:43] word to give us faith for the rapture
[1:38:46] amen faith for the resurrection because
[1:38:48] that's the hour we're living we're not
[1:38:50] we're not living in lutheran luther's
[1:38:51] age or wesley's age
[1:38:53] or the pentecostal age amen we're living
[1:38:55] in a bright age
[1:38:56] amen and brother and what god requires
[1:38:59] in this age or just sure he requires
[1:39:02] justification sure he wants us to
[1:39:04] believe in sanctification sure he wants
[1:39:06] us to believe in the baptism of the holy
[1:39:08] ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen
[1:39:11] but what else does he want us to believe
[1:39:12] he wants us to believe that we're living
[1:39:14] in the hour of the second coming of the
[1:39:16] lord and the rapture amen this is the
[1:39:19] hour that he wants us to look up amen by
[1:39:22] the grace of god it's not just not just
[1:39:24] looking to lutheran wesleyan and the
[1:39:26] pentecostals no no we're looking up for
[1:39:28] the resurrection and the rapture because
[1:39:30] what god did in this hour what god did
[1:39:33] in this age in the ministry of the
[1:39:35] prophet amen brother it wasn't pointing
[1:39:38] us to william branham he was pointing us
[1:39:40] to jesus amen he had come down to
[1:39:43] receive us all
[1:39:44] amen he had come down to rapture us oh
[1:39:47] yeah oh not william brandon no not by
[1:39:49] any means it was our lord jesus christ
[1:39:52] amen because brother the ministry that
[1:39:54] was manifested
[1:39:56] he didn't do it jesus did it
[1:39:59] because as he said many times now he
[1:40:01] said i'm waiting on him because i can't
[1:40:03] do this
[1:40:05] yeah amen
[1:40:06] brother so brother how many of us are
[1:40:08] waiting on him now
[1:40:10] amen but not just for these signs and
[1:40:11] wonders amen discerning the thoughts and
[1:40:14] intentions of the heart do this do this
[1:40:15] do that amen how many of us are waiting
[1:40:17] on jesus for the resurrection and the
[1:40:19] rapture amen because brother they were
[1:40:22] point they were appointed to jesus in
[1:40:23] luther's hour and and in colombia
[1:40:26] columbia rather and and lutheran wesley
[1:40:28] and and
[1:40:29] pointing to jesus amen jesus was because
[1:40:32] they needed this justification they
[1:40:34] needed sanctification they needed them
[1:40:36] after the holy ghost they needed the
[1:40:38] gifts of the spirit but now we need the
[1:40:40] rapture
[1:40:41] amen because god has brought us that
[1:40:43] thus far and god has brought this
[1:40:45] perfection this perfection amen so

[1:40:50] the perfection of faith to take us into
[1:40:52] a resurrection perfection of faith take
[1:40:54] us into the rapture amen and brother
[1:40:56] like i said it's not just god waiting on
[1:40:58] us but it's the dead in christ waiting
[1:41:00] on us amen

[1:44:32] sign and not just believe in the second
[1:44:34] sign but to get their attention to
[1:44:36] believe the word amen because there's
[1:44:38] anything that we need to do in this hour
[1:44:40] in this age is to believe the word of
[1:44:42] god to believe thus saith the lord to
[1:44:45] believe it is written what for

[1:45:20] and a greater understanding that we
[1:45:22] would keep move on and as mature sons
[1:45:25] and daughters of god amen but then
[1:45:28] came that great revelation of the

[1:45:47] and again they're waiting on us please
[1:45:50] in the name of jesus
[1:45:53] again like all those that are going on
[1:45:57] and they're in there right now we know
[1:45:58] that
[1:45:59] the body they was in physically is all

[1:46:08] and to get into that glorified body
[1:46:10] they're waiting on you and me amen
[1:46:13] praise the lord and god is waiting on us
[1:46:15] to believe for the resurrection to
[1:46:18] believe for the rapture it's not just
[1:46:21] believe this doctrine that doctrine this
[1:46:24] this this idea and that idea amen but
[1:46:26] it's to believe what god is focusing on
[1:46:28] in these last days
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:32] we're not here to call for what luther
[1:46:34] luther was calling for wesley or no no
[1:46:36] god has given it to us we know that we
[1:46:38] believe it we're moving on amen or the
[1:46:40] pentecostals amen brother sister i pray
[1:46:43] grace that we got the revelation that

[1:46:52] anything god's looking for in me is the
[1:46:54] resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:46:58] not just the the the doctrine of
[1:47:00] justification sanctification the gifts
[1:47:03] of the spirit no brother
[1:47:05] we ought to we ought to move on now
[1:47:07] let's go on
[1:47:08] just think
[1:47:09] god was increasing all that he did down
[1:47:11] for the ages oh he increased it
[1:47:13] increased it increased it of course the
[1:47:15] enemy was there to bring in the darkness
[1:47:17] amen but god was there to bring back the
[1:47:19] light
[1:47:20] amen amen but there's going to be so few
[1:47:24] but it's so little light yes but it be
[1:47:27] and we know that in this last stage when
[1:47:29] the angel drew this
[1:47:31] drew this ear
[1:47:33] the angel came into branham tabernacle
[1:47:35] when brother branham was preaching on
[1:47:36] that and the angel came in and went over
[1:47:39] and he drew it on the wall
[1:47:40] yeah
[1:47:41] and the prophet of god said yeah he said
[1:47:43] when he drew this on the wall he said it
[1:47:45] was all dark
[1:47:46] you see it was total darkness
[1:47:48] and he said i put that there he said
[1:47:50] just to represent the bride
[1:47:53] he said but she's going to be so small
[1:47:55] amen but the churches they're in total
[1:47:57] darkness spiritually when it comes to
[1:48:00] the revelation of the will of god for
[1:48:02] this hour for this age they're in total
[1:48:04] darkness amen but the bride she's got
[1:48:07] the light she's got the revelation amen
[1:48:10] that god is ordained but again
[1:48:13] we know that according to the scriptures
[1:48:15] there's going to be very very very
[1:48:17] little faith
[1:48:19] when the son of man comes
[1:48:21] will he find faith
[1:48:24] on the earth
[1:48:26] i trust mother gracie finding faith in
[1:48:29] you
[1:48:30] faith in me for the resurrection faith
[1:48:32] in you faith in me for the rapture o my
[1:48:35] lord help us
[1:48:37] as i said
[1:48:39] all down through the ages the like
[1:48:40] lutheran wesley pentecostals brother
[1:48:42] morning noon and night they couldn't get
[1:48:44] away from what to them what god was
[1:48:46] working on oh justification
[1:48:47] justification said oh praise the lord
[1:48:49] they were so excited with it they're so
[1:48:52] thrilled with it amen god has sanctified
[1:48:54] us god has done this god has done that
[1:48:56] god is doing this amen get into the
[1:48:58] resurrection and and and so on oh praise
[1:49:02] the lord god the baptizer with the holy
[1:49:04] ghost thank you lord thank you lord
[1:49:06] you're doing this you're doing that
[1:49:07] you're the healer amen oh yeah because
[1:49:10] as as a remember the church went went
[1:49:12] from light into darkness and then from
[1:49:15] dark darkness into light amen to get
[1:49:17] into the resurrection and rapture amen
[1:49:20] and and the healing oh yeah healing
[1:49:22] healing healing amen through the
[1:49:24] pentecostal revival all they really got
[1:49:27] into god was the healer but then they
[1:49:29] began to put more and more and more
[1:49:31] focus on just healing the body they were
[1:49:34] sick so you we just with these stripes
[1:49:36] were healed yes but but they didn't go
[1:49:39] on and on and on to the complete healing
[1:49:42] change of the body
[1:49:45] just just heal the body of this sickness
[1:49:47] heal the body of that sickness and so on
[1:49:49] yeah but god through the through the
[1:49:51] message of the hour through the revealed
[1:49:52] word is taking us on to the right to the
[1:49:55] faith but for to change our bodies
[1:49:58] from time to eternity amen to change our
[1:50:01] bodies from
[1:50:03] physical
[1:50:04] yeah what is going to be physical too
[1:50:06] but but not not under under the curse no
[1:50:09] no
[1:50:10] into into eternal from time to eternity
[1:50:13] amen praise the lord
[1:50:16] he praise the lord he's going to turn us
[1:50:18] all back young
[1:50:20] there won't be an infill of days neither
[1:50:22] an old man that has not fulfilled his
[1:50:23] days that's what the bible says praise
[1:50:25] the lord amen why because
[1:50:28] we're all going to be turned back to our
[1:50:29] our just young men and
[1:50:31] and and women young brothers and sisters
[1:50:33] amen maybe in our early 20s you know but
[1:50:36] they're not we're not going to be
[1:50:38] there's no no not going to be nobody
[1:50:39] they were gray hair
[1:50:40] no not by any means
[1:50:42] amen brother no wrinkles no old age and
[1:50:45] so on oh this one is a senior citizen
[1:50:47] that was no no no
[1:50:49] we were but not will be amen
[1:50:53] because he is ordained we're going to go
[1:50:55] into
[1:50:56] the old will be young there forever amen
[1:51:00] transformed in a moment of time as it
[1:51:02] says the bible says there won't be any
[1:51:04] name man that is not fulfilled if
[1:51:05] there's an old man and no there won't be
[1:51:07] an infant of days no no
[1:51:10] because the baby no matter you know if
[1:51:12] even are some of the young here you know
[1:51:14] if they are predestinated and god knows
[1:51:16] the heart
[1:51:17] god knows the heart
[1:51:19] amen
[1:51:20] brother when we get there oh they're
[1:51:22] going to be maybe around 20 years old 21
[1:51:24] years old amen again it's like the
[1:51:27] division or the the testimony that i
[1:51:30] read a few years ago of a
[1:51:33] i think it was a sister not sure
[1:51:36] or somebody that they did stepped out of
[1:51:38] time and they went in went into eternity
[1:51:41] and when they did
[1:51:43] they saw this one they saw that one and
[1:51:45] they saw this person they said were you
[1:51:48] they said you don't know me
[1:51:50] no
[1:51:51] they said
[1:51:52] well god let them know that back there
[1:51:55] just to reveal this to her
[1:51:57] amen he said oh i was your brother
[1:52:00] she said you were yes
[1:52:03] but he was he was a a child that died
[1:52:06] when he was very small but over there
[1:52:09] he was he was a mature young man
[1:52:13] you yes he said that's me
[1:52:15] she's you're only a baby no he said
[1:52:16] there's no babies there
[1:52:18] he said this is me now
[1:52:20] oh yeah
[1:52:21] no no babies
[1:52:23] and yet there was a time when you know
[1:52:25] we thought we were taught that we
[1:52:27] believe that when we get to heaven or
[1:52:29] there's going to be old people and
[1:52:31] there's going to be
[1:52:32] babies and so on no
[1:52:34] the old will be young there forever
[1:52:37] transformed in a moment of time that's
[1:52:39] right
[1:52:40] as the bible says there won't be no no
[1:52:42] man that hasn't fulfilled his days
[1:52:44] neither infinite days no no
[1:52:46] praise the lord because the redemption
[1:52:48] is going to put us back we've got way
[1:52:50] god wants us
[1:52:51] amen
[1:52:53] and we're going to be in glorified
[1:52:55] bodies
[1:52:56] by the grace of god
[1:52:59] so brother
[1:53:01] i don't know when it comes to
[1:53:02] recognizing family and friends from here
[1:53:04] when it comes to recognizing husbands
[1:53:06] and wives no
[1:53:08] at least we won't we won't be referred
[1:53:10] to each other as husbands and wives
[1:53:12] again as william branham went beyond the
[1:53:14] curtain of time and he saw all the
[1:53:16] believers from the hour and the age that
[1:53:18] he lived in and all of a sudden these
[1:53:21] two sisters came came running to him oh
[1:53:23] they said wonderful praise the lord you
[1:53:25] made it
[1:53:26] and and they
[1:53:28] he said what
[1:53:30] oh they referred to my brother
[1:53:32] when he realized oh that was that was
[1:53:34] his wife
[1:53:36] well he was married twice because his
[1:53:38] first wife died when they were very
[1:53:40] young and then then his second wife of
[1:53:42] course she didn't go on until 1970. they
[1:53:44] were 71 and there they were but he
[1:53:47] didn't are they recognizing why because
[1:53:49] they were young
[1:53:51] they were much younger
[1:53:53] and
[1:53:54] to just maybe around 20 years old 21
[1:53:57] years old and so i always said you were
[1:53:58] there yes she said
[1:54:00] she said you taught this you told us
[1:54:02] this you told us this and so on yeah
[1:54:06] and then finally they told him that he
[1:54:08] had to go back because he still had
[1:54:09] something to do
[1:54:11] amen
[1:54:12] so brother i think he would be back
[1:54:14] there now he's in a young body

[1:54:29] little older than what they are there
[1:54:30] now our young brothers and young real

[1:58:52] soul body and spirit but now the bride
[1:58:55] is coming into the revelation of the
[1:58:56] rapture
[1:58:58] soul
[1:58:59] body and
[1:59:00] spirit brother i trust we're going
[1:59:02] beyond
[1:59:03] the spirit beyond the soul we're getting
[1:59:06] it's going to get more and more real to
[1:59:08] us
[1:59:08] hallelujah until it changes us
[1:59:12] from time to eternity
[1:59:14] it changes us into glorified bodies by
[1:59:17] the grace of god
[1:59:19] god help us
[1:59:25] we
[1:59:26] as the prophet said we are in
[1:59:28] a changing dispensation
[1:59:32] amen
[1:59:34] and not just changing as it were we were
[1:59:36] changed from
[1:59:37] from from sinners to saints
[1:59:40] yes amen
[1:59:41] but we're now being changed from time to
[1:59:43] eternity
[1:59:45] eternity in control
[1:59:50] let me share with you these thoughts
[1:59:51] that he expressed in one of the last
[1:59:53] messages that he preached
[1:59:56] december the 4th 1965.
[2:00:00] now
[2:00:01] and two weeks later god called him home
[2:00:04] yeah
[2:00:05] and this message was
[2:00:07] the rapture
[2:00:09] and really
[2:00:10] he's highlighting the conditions
[2:00:12] for the rapture
[2:00:14] amen
[2:00:15] brother god help us to highlight the
[2:00:17] conditions
[2:00:18] to go from time to eternity
[2:00:21] amen
[2:00:24] he said it's really nice to be here and
[2:00:26] i guess those don't sound like jokes but
[2:00:28] sense of humor he said which the lord
[2:00:30] himself had a sense of humor you know
[2:00:34] and he referred to herod and he said go
[2:00:36] tell that fox
[2:00:38] of course in that day it was it was
[2:00:40] a joke
[2:00:42] referring to eric as a fox
[2:00:45] yeah
[2:00:46] and he said
[2:00:47] go tell that fox and so on
[2:00:50] and he said he had a sense of humor
[2:00:53] and he said when i was a little boy he
[2:00:54] said i used to come out to listen
[2:00:57] because i was a boy preacher
[2:00:59] just a young fellow a chap
[2:01:02] and you know he said just a kid
[2:01:05] went through school no education and
[2:01:08] they come to hear my broken words
[2:01:10] my kentucky english
[2:01:13] amen
[2:01:15] it's like
[2:01:16] i expressed to
[2:01:19] one of brother brown's sons one time
[2:01:20] when they were translating
[2:01:22] uh
[2:01:24] certain messages
[2:01:26] from the tapes and and they
[2:01:29] and a certain message there brother
[2:01:31] brown said this said this and this and
[2:01:33] when i listen it on tape oh it's
[2:01:34] different so i had to i emailed them and
[2:01:38] i said i just want to let you know
[2:01:41] i said
[2:01:42] as brother gerald lost i said every
[2:01:44] newfoundland he said i i said i'm a bay
[2:01:46] person
[2:01:47] and i said sometimes i said i talked
[2:01:49] like a bayman and i used bayman's words
[2:01:52] and i said i want you to understand that
[2:01:53] the prophet of god was a kentucky
[2:01:55] hillbilly
[2:01:56] and i said sometimes i said he used
[2:01:58] kentucky hillbilly words and not regular
[2:02:01] normal english words and i highlighted a
[2:02:04] certain paragraph there in this one of
[2:02:06] the books where they had they had
[2:02:08] translated what he said and i said
[2:02:10] that's not right
[2:02:11] i said you didn't you didn't put the
[2:02:12] right word in
[2:02:14] i said he said this and this is what he
[2:02:15] meant
[2:02:17] sorry and and i said so this is the word
[2:02:19] that you should put in
[2:02:21] and then in the next paragraph i said
[2:02:22] this is what he said there i said this
[2:02:24] is a word you should put
[2:02:26] i said there was a kentucky ill belly
[2:02:29] and i said a kentucky ill believed
[2:02:31] that he was using and this is what it
[2:02:33] meant and of course they said thank you
[2:02:35] and they changed it because they
[2:02:37] understood then that it what he was
[2:02:40] saying amen
[2:02:42] so brother
[2:02:44] because why brother regardless of who
[2:02:47] you are what you are god's going to
[2:02:48] god's going to make you a witness
[2:02:50] oh yeah where whether if you're a new
[2:02:52] flander you'll be witness as a new
[2:02:53] flander would you're going to be a
[2:02:56] this this person or that person that's
[2:02:58] the way god's going to use you as a
[2:02:59] witness god help us but there that will
[2:03:01] stay with the word
[2:03:03] amen
[2:03:04] regardless if you say it this way or i
[2:03:07] say it that way it's going to be the
[2:03:08] same thing amen the same revelation
[2:03:14] and he said you know
[2:03:17] he said i he said i speak kentucky
[2:03:19] english
[2:03:20] and he said
[2:03:22] and oh my hits and hates
[2:03:26] my totes and carry and so on
[2:03:29] so he said uh so now he said after you
[2:03:31] get you got older and he said you've got
[2:03:33] to have something more than that
[2:03:35] when i was a child i spake as a child
[2:03:37] and i thought as a child amen
[2:03:40] but as he matured of course he made it
[2:03:42] more and more clear to them
[2:03:44] and now he said it's time to walk
[2:03:46] straight line right down that highway to
[2:03:48] glory
[2:03:49] and i said i do believe that we are
[2:03:51] living in the closing scenes of this of
[2:03:54] the history of this world
[2:03:56] i truly believe that the coming of the
[2:03:58] lord is closer perhaps than we think
[2:04:02] and concerning all that's been going on
[2:04:03] in the world in the covet 19 issue it is
[2:04:06] another witness
[2:04:07] we're at the end
[2:04:09] it's finished
[2:04:11] it's finished
[2:04:14] no more revivals
[2:04:16] gone
[2:04:17] the next as i said the next revival will
[2:04:19] be to the jews
[2:04:21] but god is finished with the gentiles
[2:04:24] amen
[2:04:26] he said there is too much supernatural
[2:04:28] vindication of god's written word of
[2:04:30] this hour for something not to be
[2:04:33] approaching us now
[2:04:35] and he said see he said it would be
[2:04:37] astounding to you just to let you know
[2:04:40] what is really taking place
[2:04:43] he saw what we didn't see
[2:04:45] he saw what that generation didn't see
[2:04:48] and we as believers we are seeing what
[2:04:50] the generation
[2:04:51] is not seeing
[2:04:54] rather they're hoping that this is going
[2:04:56] to happen they're hoping that that's
[2:04:57] going to happen it's going to change
[2:04:58] like this change like that but you and i
[2:05:00] know that it's the end
[2:05:03] it's the finish
[2:05:04] amen
[2:05:08] and he said listen
[2:05:10] he said many of you strangers perhaps
[2:05:11] hear these men get up and make these
[2:05:14] remarks about a message of this hour and
[2:05:16] he said what they are getting at is
[2:05:18] god's promise of this hour
[2:05:21] it's what god is saying amen
[2:05:25] and he said there's one chance out of 10
[2:05:28] million he said if a man told you a
[2:05:30] certain thing would happen it would
[2:05:31] happen at a certain time and he said
[2:05:33] then he said the place it would happen
[2:05:36] and he said one chance out of about a
[2:05:38] hundred million and he said then he said
[2:05:41] the time it would happen
[2:05:42] and he said it goes on and on and on and
[2:05:45] the way it will happen
[2:05:47] so when we see it so perfectly each and
[2:05:50] every time turn we
[2:05:52] then we turn right back to the
[2:05:54] scriptures back to the word amen
[2:05:57] and he said and the holy spirit brings
[2:06:00] out and just puts the whole word
[2:06:02] together and makes a picture
[2:06:05] he said just to show the hour that we
[2:06:07] are living
[2:06:09] we are changing
[2:06:10] dispensations
[2:06:12] amen
[2:06:14] why he said we are at a corner
[2:06:16] amen
[2:06:18] everybody laying bricks right down the
[2:06:20] same row like a certain denomination
[2:06:22] starts and starts rolling down the roll
[2:06:24] it's all right but when you get to them
[2:06:27] turns where you have to turn back the
[2:06:29] other way he said god isn't building a
[2:06:32] wall
[2:06:33] he said god is building a house
[2:06:37] but
[2:06:39] down through the ages when god started a
[2:06:41] certain
[2:06:42] revival they just kept on going but
[2:06:44] brother they had to go and turn amen
[2:06:47] another revival then go and turn another
[2:06:49] revival now they just kept on going
[2:06:52] and even in this hour they kept on going
[2:06:54] with the pentecostal revival and it just
[2:06:56] became a denomination
[2:06:58] yeah
[2:06:59] but god moved on beyond it all
[2:07:02] to the bride revival
[2:07:04] and i pray grace whether that we're not
[2:07:05] going to
[2:07:06] just continue on in her bride revival
[2:07:09] this way with this doctrine this
[2:07:10] doctrine the prophet said this the
[2:07:12] prophet said that well now let's move on
[2:07:14] to the rapture
[2:07:15] amen move on so that brother sister what
[2:07:18] god is going to give us the faith that
[2:07:20] he that he wants us to have
[2:07:23] knowing that but the faith you need for
[2:07:25] the rapture
[2:07:28] and many of us got faith for the rapture
[2:07:31] that means got faith for the
[2:07:32] resurrection
[2:07:35] and many of her many of us are really
[2:07:37] really angry and thirsting for the
[2:07:39] resurrection and the rapture
[2:07:42] remember luther was hungry and thirsting
[2:07:44] for justification
[2:07:46] wesley was angry and thirsty for
[2:07:48] sanctification and others as well
[2:07:51] and
[2:07:51] pentecostals were hung and thirsting for
[2:07:53] the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[2:07:56] gifts of the spirit amen
[2:07:58] but brother what are we hungry and
[2:08:00] thirsting for
[2:08:02] all those ages that come and they're all
[2:08:04] gone
[2:08:05] amen oh yeah
[2:08:07] because the revival is not there like it
[2:08:08] used to be in in luther it's not there
[2:08:10] like it used to be in wesley or the or
[2:08:13] the though the old-fashioned army or the
[2:08:15] pentecostals
[2:08:16] i tell you the revival is not there like
[2:08:18] it used to be among the bride
[2:08:20] believers 50 years ago
[2:08:24] when god first sent the prophet
[2:08:27] oh yeah well they were all excited
[2:08:30] they're all running after william
[2:08:31] brandon running there running there amen
[2:08:34] but god he laid in the word and god took
[2:08:36] him
[2:08:37] why because they were focusing on him
[2:08:39] but not on the word
[2:08:42] god help us to focus on the word amen
[2:08:46] and brotherless god help us to focus on
[2:08:48] the faith
[2:08:50] that the word is ordained to give us
[2:08:53] brother it's not just to get us to
[2:08:55] believe this believe this oh yeah thank
[2:08:57] god he revealed this doctrine he
[2:08:59] revealed this mystery this mystery
[2:09:01] brother brother all of it is to move on
[2:09:03] to the resurrection move on to the
[2:09:04] rapture
[2:09:05] because that's the next thing god wants
[2:09:08] to do
[2:09:10] for the gentile world
[2:09:12] after he takes the bride out you'll go
[2:09:14] on to the jews
[2:09:16] yeah
[2:09:19] god help us
[2:09:20] remember he said god isn't building a
[2:09:22] wall
[2:09:23] god is building a house
[2:09:26] so he goes down and turns
[2:09:28] goes down and turns goes down and turns
[2:09:31] amen
[2:09:32] pray graciously
[2:09:34] amen that god was working on us
[2:09:37] working on us i pray grace that he's
[2:09:40] he's bringing forth the bride
[2:09:43] amen
[2:09:44] in his image to bride
[2:09:48] so god is building a house
[2:09:50] and there's many cuts and turns that
[2:09:52] he's predicted here in the bible
[2:09:54] and he said
[2:09:56] it must be according to the blueprint
[2:09:58] if it isn't it's got to be torn down
[2:10:01] again
[2:10:02] amen
[2:10:03] why it's god building the house
[2:10:07] of the word
[2:10:08] building the house of the bride
[2:10:10] by the grace of god
[2:10:13] amen
[2:10:14] and he prayed he said we praise god for
[2:10:16] his goodness and the fellowship of you
[2:10:18] people and the open doors that the lord
[2:10:21] has given us and i've always contended
[2:10:23] that he said i believe
[2:10:25] in the people in denominations but he
[2:10:28] said i don't have much time to exhort
[2:10:31] denominations
[2:10:32] because each one builds a fence around
[2:10:35] himself
[2:10:36] amen
[2:10:39] i believe it's brother david little
[2:10:41] saying about well
[2:10:43] he was raising some ducks and said the
[2:10:46] river came up and each duck you know
[2:10:48] that wanted fellowship with one another
[2:10:50] they couldn't do it because they was all
[2:10:52] fenced up but when the water got so high
[2:10:55] it just floated the ducks out of the pen
[2:10:59] i think that's the way to do it he said
[2:11:01] the water is coming up and we and what
[2:11:03] is it the water the reveal word
[2:11:05] amen
[2:11:08] and he said we can get out of the pen
[2:11:10] fellowship with one another and you know
[2:11:13] i have the real love of christ in our
[2:11:16] hearts
[2:11:18] how many got that baptism of divine love
[2:11:21] grace
[2:11:29] let me try to finish right here
[2:11:35] he said i don't stay right in your
[2:11:36] church and scatter out light
[2:11:39] he said be a real christian
[2:11:42] and he said a real
[2:11:44] loyal genuine saint
[2:11:46] any man that believes in god will
[2:11:48] appreciate a person like that
[2:11:51] have a right attitude a right spirit a
[2:11:53] right motive and a right objective
[2:11:57] the will of god for your life
[2:12:00] amen
[2:12:04] then he goes on to say and he goes into
[2:12:06] the book of psalms that we we read
[2:12:09] and he said i want to speak on a real
[2:12:11] strange subject
[2:12:14] amen
[2:12:17] he said the subject of the rapture
[2:12:20] and we believe that there will be a
[2:12:22] rapture
[2:12:24] god help us
[2:12:28] luther
[2:12:29] he focused on
[2:12:31] on what god gave him
[2:12:33] wesley focused on what god gave him the
[2:12:35] pentecostal focused on what god had
[2:12:37] given them
[2:12:38] what are we focusing on now
[2:12:42] well the lutherans are not focusing
[2:12:43] really not now but they did back then
[2:12:47] four or five hundred years ago and the
[2:12:48] methodists and the old-fashioned
[2:12:50] salvation army they focused on what god
[2:12:52] had given them back back in that day but
[2:12:54] certainly not focusing on it now
[2:12:56] and the pentecostals the restoration of
[2:12:59] the gift the baptist the holy ghost
[2:13:00] they're not focusing on it like they
[2:13:01] used to
[2:13:02] as i said i was
[2:13:04] born and raised in the salvation army
[2:13:06] and moving here into saint john's we
[2:13:08] eventually ended up in the pentecostal
[2:13:10] church and i was with pentecost for a
[2:13:12] number of years but i tell you not it's
[2:13:14] not the pentecost that i was a part of
[2:13:17] back then
[2:13:18] no no
[2:13:21] it's become so cool and so
[2:13:22] denominational
[2:13:24] but where is the revival
[2:13:26] well it's moved on to the bride amen
[2:13:31] amen we believe we believe what god did
[2:13:33] what god did now we believe what god's
[2:13:35] doing
[2:13:36] amen so what what is god doing he's give
[2:13:39] he's separating us separating the bride
[2:13:42] and he's getting the bride together in
[2:13:44] the in the reveal word to give us
[2:13:46] rapturing faith to get out of here
[2:13:48] and then
[2:13:50] he goes back to the jews
[2:13:52] he left israel came to the gentiles now
[2:13:55] he's leaving the gentiles going back to
[2:13:57] israel
[2:13:58] amen that's according to the word that's
[2:14:00] the promise
[2:14:02] god help us
[2:14:03] brother that we're going to respond to
[2:14:05] what god has done and what god's doing
[2:14:08] to the gentiles to give us the
[2:14:09] resurrection to give us the rapturing
[2:14:12] faith that we need
[2:14:14] amen to be changed in a moment in the
[2:14:16] twinkling of an eye and cut into
[2:14:18] eternity
[2:14:20] how many really really want to go
[2:14:29] and he read again the psalms 27
[2:14:32] the lord is my light and my salvation
[2:14:35] whom shall i fear
[2:14:37] the lord is the strength of my life of
[2:14:40] whom shall i be afraid
[2:14:43] let's respect god
[2:14:44] let's respect his word let's respect
[2:14:46] what god's doing
[2:14:51] redemption is in what god is doing
[2:14:54] what he done yes but now what he's doing
[2:14:58] god help us
[2:15:01] he said when the wicked even my enemies
[2:15:03] and my foes came upon me to heat up my
[2:15:06] flesh they stumble and fell
[2:15:09] though the hole shouldn't be again about
[2:15:11] me my heart shall not fear and the war
[2:15:14] would rise against me in this will i be
[2:15:17] confident
[2:15:18] it says one thing have i desired of the
[2:15:20] lord that i will seek after that i may
[2:15:22] dwell in the house of the lord all the
[2:15:25] days of my life god help us
[2:15:27] to behold the beauty of the lord
[2:15:30] and to inquire in his temple
[2:15:33] amen

[2:15:36] shall he hide me in the pavilion in the
[2:15:38] secret of his tabernacle shall he hide
[2:15:40] me and set me up on a rock grace

[2:15:57] resurrection
