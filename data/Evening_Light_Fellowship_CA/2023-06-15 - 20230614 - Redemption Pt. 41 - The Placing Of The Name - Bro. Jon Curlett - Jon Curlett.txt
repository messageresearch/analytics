that's not here tonight we pray Jonathan as well Lord in your name we're asking it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 16 John chapter 16. amen welcome sister Hannah Friesian with us all the way from BC she's spending just a couple months she's almost done a just a short work rotation there in in Halifax and then she's headed back but we know her from back in our time in BC so it's good to have her here amen and as you may have noticed we've we've switched the slide deck up so I got some feedback from the deacons that the the white letters on the black background was a little tough for some people so we've gone white background with black lettering so by all means let us know if it works better for you it doesn't matter to me what colors we use or don't use so just uh just see how it works the service we've only got one screen working here tonight but just let us know how it goes amen amen John chapter 16 says and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full these things have I spoken unto you in Proverbs but the time cometh when I shall no more speak unto you in Proverbs but I shall show you plainly of the father at that day ye shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I will pray the father for you amen God bless his word you may be seated this evening and we are of course continuing on our series on Redemption and I I want to take a title this evening of the placing of the name and we've spoken about this adoption ceremony for quite some time about the son that approved himself and he had gone through the tests and the trials and he was ready to to step into the responsibilities and the expectations that were about to be laid on his shoulders and I want to focus on on one part of the ceremony money that was very special because when the child was born they were given a name and that name was their identity and so you know today like like my son I would have a Jonathan or a Jensen or a Samuel when that child was born he was given a name and often his name was that of the father or if not of the father then of the grandfather it was often a name that was matched up with with the family lineage and even if you think about John the Baptist when he was born and and they they asked what's his name going to be and Elizabeth said it's going to be John and they said but no one in your family is named John why are you naming him John and so they said to Zacharias is this right is she right and you remember he had to get the tablet he had to write his name as John and they were all amazed and they thought what is this all about and as soon as he said his name is John then he could talk again because it had been fulfilled what the angel had said to him and and then he shouted and he praised and because what the promise had come into effect but he had to give the right name to that child so when the child was born they would have a name so my son would be named Jonathan but that the ending of the ceremony then what happened was the father would attach his name to the son's name and until the son was ready for adoption he was just Jonathan or Jensen or Samuel as we would say today but my name would not be attached to his so what we would have today is is we'd have our name and then the father's name was really the surname if I could put it that way so today Jonathan's name or Jensen's name is Jensen but at his adoption ceremony he would become Jensen curlette because everyone knows who the curlets are and they know it by my name and they know it by my father's name I took my father's name and so then my sons take my name and the father's name is passed from generation to generation but only only if you're an adopted son so if you don't come to adoption they don't want you to have their name because you're going to disgrace the family name you're not worthy of the family name you didn't prove yourself you didn't go through and pass the training and stick it out the way that they expected and so you could be a son all your life but you couldn't get the father's name until that adoption ceremony so anybody the the beauty of the father's name is this that if anyone you know knows Jensen then he could walk up and they would say well what's your name and he would say Jensen well that doesn't mean anything but as soon as he says Jensen curlette then they're going to say you're a part of the curlette family do you know Jonathan curlette do you know Lanny curlette do you know Corgi curlette and these different ones if we look back through our generations and so as soon as the curlette name is attached then they know who to associate them with and in those days they would say that you would be uh you know if you look at Simon Peter it was Simon barjona and that word bar means son of so it was Simon son of Jonah and so all they would say is what's your name and he would say Simon and if he was adopted barjona and then they would say well where are you from well I'm from uh Capernaum or Galilee or this one's and they'd say oh so you must be so-and-so Center and they'd know everything about you and your family and your heritage and your history and everything just based on who your or what your last name was who your father's name was and so we look at these things and so you had to have the right character to have the name you had to be you had to be worthy of being associated with what your father had developed now he set the criteria not you and when he believed that you were ready to carry his name then at the ending of that ceremony he would say this is my son and he would attach his name to the son and now the Son and the father would have essentially the same name and now the Father Like I said wouldn't identify that boy as his son until he was adopted because he didn't want a good for nothing associated with his name now if he was a good for nothing himself he didn't care that would work out okay but for a real father for a man that have real Integrity in these things it was it was critical that that son would have a the sort of character that would reflect what the father has and even if you look I was I was doing some reading on the birthright last week and there was even a provision in the scriptures in the Old Testament before Grace that if your son wasn't good then you could take him you could take him to the gate you could take him out to and in front of the elders and you'd say my son is slothful he's a drunkard he's no good he's all of these things and then you could take him outside the city and stone him young men beware we don't want to go back to the law do we but literally why because you didn't want an Associated person with your name that didn't have the character of the family traits and so you could actually get rid of that son but the thought I'm coming to is that there's a lot of character that has to go with that name because there's power in the name there's Authority that comes with that names there's a responsibility that comes with it and you think about famous people good or bad and you understand the power of a name so today if your last name is Hitler it doesn't matter how good you are it doesn't matter how educated you are it doesn't matter how much you've tried to prove yourself doesn't matter how much money you give yourself to charity you know and these different things you're going to struggle to make friends and influence people why because your daddy or your granddaddy or your great-granddaddy killed millions of people out of racial prejudice so I guarantee you if your last name's Hitler you're not going to be the CEO of a multinational corporation you're probably never going to work in Human Resources either why because there's something associated with the name there's power with the name and in this name it's a limiting power it closes doors to you but if your last name is Gates on the other hand it doesn't matter what you look like it doesn't matter whether or not you give to charity it doesn't matter how educated you are how intelligent you are if they know or they believe that you're associated with Bill Gates then that's going to open doors to business opportunities to school opportunities to Friendship opportunities to all sorts of things primarily on the basis of the name of your father why because he's counted as one of the richest men in the world he's counted as intelligent he's counted as having influence worldwide and so if you have his name then they believe that you have an opportunity to tap into what that name brings because of who your father is amen you could do the exact same things as the person that's last name is Hitler and get a completely different response now let me make a point there because you can do the exact same things that a Christian is doing and get a completely different response because you're of a different nature because you're under a different name somebody that's Hitler does one thing maybe they give a million dollars to charity and it still won't do Malika good and then you do it under the name of gates and every door is opened and they're throwing parties and you're in the news and all of these things why because there's power in that name a name opens doors it gives you connections it gives you opportunities and it can even bring you benefits you haven't earned and you don't deserve now that's what Grace is for us that's what Grace is for us is we get so many things we don't deserve but if you look around the world and you look at especially rich kids and these different things they get all these benefits and they attribute it to themselves somehow and it makes them worse not better but they get all sorts of benefits because of who their father is or who their mother's side on the flip side again it can it can lead you down bad paths for one person a name is great and for another it's not the name Trudeau today in some circles it'll make you a celebrity and in other circles it'll make you a Target the last name Trump in some circles it'll give you business opportunities and others it closes doors and and people look on you with this stain it depends on who it is that's looking at you and what their personal beliefs are in these different things it doesn't matter what you've done the name often determines what sort of a reception you're going to get but let's take this back to the scriptures I just that was just kind of my preamble to set us up for this this morning so let's go back to the scriptures in John 5 43 Jesus said I am come in my father's name he's talking to the priesthood he says ye receive me not now there was a group that received him and there's a group that didn't just receive him they received all of him because there's a distinction because remember when Nicodemus came they said we know that a man can only do these things if God is with them they received a portion of what Jesus brought but they couldn't receive it all and that's no good because if you receive only a portion it makes you one thing and that's lukewarm it makes you compromised it makes you half miserable and never happy but there was a group that came and they accepted everything and remember after he preached and he said unless you eat the the Flesh of the body of the son of man and drink his blood and afterwards they said this is a hard saying how can anybody understand it and they they were sorrowful but they left and then he went to the 12 and he says will ye also go and Peter said to whom else can we go Lord thou Hast the words of eternal life Peter didn't understand it Peter didn't understand it but he said you have the words of eternal life we'll stick with you until we understand these things but there was a group that couldn't understand it but look at this brother Braham says I wanted you to be sure to see that it's the anchor we have he's talking about Peter we are not anchored by a church we're Anchored In Christ you see he is that only way he's the only place of safety the only place that God ever put his name and God said he would meet the people in the place that he chose to put his name not in any gate but in the gate that he chose and in that place he would meet the people and there only Peter says Thou alone has the words of Life The Word of Life is with you so we've got to stay with you no matter what he says and we find out that God never put his name anywhere but in his son Jesus Christ as the son always always always always always takes the name of the father and we'll get into this much much later but we know the bride also always takes the name of the husband there's two types going on there but there's a deeper Revelation here because they were all looking for the Messiah they were groaning they were crying out for it they were under the oppression of the Romans life was miserable and they were all calling for it they were expecting it they were looking for it they were all good Believers in that sense they had a common desire and that was for the Messiah to calm amen but when it stood in front of them the vast majority of them missed it only 120 made it into the Upper Room everybody else missed it why because they put their own interpretation to it they believe the word but they believe the word by their own interpretation and so when God came with his interpretation of what the Messiah was they completely missed it and they couldn't see all the way to the truth and the life that was in their midst listen to this Jesus said I come in my father's name and you receive me not then the father put his own name which is Jesus in the son and he's the way he's the door he's the house he's where God chose to put his name listen he says God never put his name in me he never put it in the church he never put it in the Methodist Baptists or Catholic but he put it in Christ the anointed Emmanuel Emmanuel God With Us that was God's intention was to be with us not to just be God the Father above us but God with us so that he could transition from with us to in US but they had to recognize the with us before they could get to the in us if you miss the with us then you weren't going to have very much luck getting to the in us for that day he says and the name is in the word because he is the word amen what is he then now catch this he says the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God this is the key to this entire service the man the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God he says no wonder Flesh and Blood had not revealed this to you but who I am and Upon This Rock I'll build my place of worship and the gates of hell can't shake it down he says amen old Living Church of God Living Church of God stand in the Firm Foundation on Jesus Christ alone you can sing the song but if you're not on Christ the word you're a teetering faltering sin but Upon This Rock Christ he said my word so there was a group that accepted it and that's the one that was able to go all the way and then from there they could take it and they can pass it on to somebody else but they had to recognize the interpretation of the word of God for their day before it could come into something that was in them they had to catch it externally before it could come internally because the message always comes through what a prophet it always comes through a messenger it always comes as a first fruit it always comes as a wave offering but there was a group that couldn't receive it all and Jesus talks about why in John chapter 8 and he says Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and come from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word listen to this church he says you are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him none no truth when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it I went to the Amplified for that portion that says he's a liar and the father of it and it says when he speaks of falsehood he speaks what is natural to him sinning is not a sin to a sinner it's natural brother Brown would even say it so far as a sinner does not sin why because he is sin it is his nature he says a pig doesn't do piggish things a pig is just a pig he says but a Believer is the one that has the the potential to sin because they are not sin and so it can be something that's out of them but he says a sinner isn't sinning they're just doing what's natural to them to us it's a sin to them it's completely natural but he says what he's when he speaks of falsehood he speaks what is natural to him for he is a liar himself and the father of lies and of all that is false and you're going to run into people and perhaps you already have that profess that they're a Christian maybe even within this message and they'll say that they're a Christian but when push comes to shove they'll live something different than what the word says they'll say what the word says because the priesthood said the word back to Christ day in and day out they always came with the word the word the word but when it came time to live it their life was different than his and he was the word interpreted he was the word manifested and they weren't so saying it is not enough but how you live it has to match up to the pattern amen that's what we're looking for so whatever it is remember their words what happens is if you look closely that the life doesn't match and if you listen closely the words they say don't quite match either and it's just a little twist here and it's a little twist there but if you've got discernment you'll catch there's something else going on in this person's life they don't have a word absolute something is blending something is compromising it and whether it's an external influence maybe it's a spirit whatever it might be maybe they're reading something maybe they're watching something it's something different and it's twisting it just that little bit and you say aha there's something wrong here because that's the word but it's not the full word it's not the balance of the word sometimes they're just unconverted and they need the new Earth and it's that simple listen we're raised in the message most of us that doesn't make you right until you get the Holy Ghost you're unconverted and so you're going to be a little bit twisted because you're not in Christ yet you got to get in Christ to get it so I've said this myself over the pope of many times use me as an example I sat and I listened and I understood and and with with the teaching that brother Gerald gave us and brother Mark gave us in Sunday school I felt I was very well qualified to discuss Doctrine but my perception of the life of a Christian was completely skewed because I was not a Christian I didn't have a new birth I didn't have the Holy Ghost I had all of the letter and none of the life and so that Twisted the way I looked at things and that's the same thing you'll see with people if they're unconverted There's Hope for them but that doesn't mean they're there yet and then some people are just like the priesthood they're just religious like the word in Jesus day and they can speak the literal words but they can't live the interpretation of the word for their day and that makes them a liar they don't even realize they're lying because what it's natural to them they're under a religious spirit just as the priesthood was Jesus said you are of your father the devil and they're priests they're they're the the arguably the most holy people the best according to the law but he says you've completely missed it and you can't even accept the word for your day and he says that makes you a liar because you say one thing but you do another that's what makes you a liar in Mark 13 it says for many shall come in my name he says I come in my father's name he says there's going to be many coming in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many and I don't have this in my slides but I wrote it down here in Matthew 7 22. remember Jesus said many will say in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and he says and I will say unto them I never knew you'd depart from me ye that work iniquity you knew what to do and you didn't do it but you did a bunch of other things in my name and you went around and you said I am Christ I am a Christian I'm coming in Jesus name and he says and I was never a part of it he didn't say they didn't do the works he said I wasn't a part of it they couldn't have been of him and that means there's only one other father that they can have and that's Satan that's a hard line that's a hard line to draw on the sand but he says because I wasn't a part of it there's only one other influence that can be and that is satanic it's not up to us to judge a person's Eternal destination listen if it was up to us and we looked at where people are at here today then Paul the Apostle would have been he would have been in the burning fires of hell as Saul wouldn't he he'd have never made it Peter after he denied Christ we'd have said that said Peter you had three opportunities and you you messed it up you're just not a real believer look at Jacob the shyster the deceiver the cheater the liar all these different things we'd have put him out and yet he was a son he was a child of God so it's not for us to put him out amen but we are supposed to be able to judge whether somebody is speaking the truth because we've been given a word we've been given a message that tells us what that truth is not just in word but in life as well because the life has to follow the word the life has to follow the word every single time may not all that say Christ Our Christ and not all that say Christian or Christian not all that say message believer our message believer right we've got to have discernment in these things Hebrews 5 14 says but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by what reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil you can't have discernment up front it's got to be exercised in other words what you've got to do is you've got to say this is what I believe is correct in this situation this is what I believe is correct about this person this is what I believe is correct about what's going on and then you've got to go and you've got to check it later and say was I right don't just Breeze over it I was wrong no God will find out why you were wrong listen I work with the deacons and we deal with situations and what happens afterwards we sit down we have a discussion we say did we get it right or did we not get it right and if we didn't get it right why didn't we get it right what did we do what did we mess up so that we don't do it the next time why we're exercising our discernment to learn and grow as we go because you don't start at the top you don't start with muscular discernment you got to build your way into it and the Holy Spirit has to be working and you've got to learn what's the Holy Spirit and what's my opinion and what's my memory and these different things so he's saying what you can't just say because somebody says I am this that they are that you've got to judge them according to the word and you've got to have discernment that's been exercised and proven ever been caught out by surprise by a professing Christian or professing message believer I remember when I was back in a different church and and when believe the sign came we had just a bunch of them walk out we lost half the deacons we lost the associate pastor we lost one of the song leaders and just in a moment they just walked away and some of them been serving the lord for 20 30 35 years and just in a moment they walked away and what we realized then was that it was not life it was a lifestyle it's easy to live a lifestyle that is Christian because there are benefits to a Christian lifestyle it's wonderful to live by the word of God even if it's not life to you because there are so many benefits to this you'll have a better life if you live by this regardless of whether or not you have the Holy Ghost it's a better way of life but it's not life you need the life to make it live and so what you realize very quickly is that those people did not have life and that's when they then later on you know a year out and they say you know I always wanted a tattoo even while they're in the message I always wanted a tattoo I always wanted to do this I always wanted to do that and you realize well that really wasn't the holy spirit in them then and you realize it was just a lifestyle they were raised in it but they did not have it amen but here's the thing some of them weren't a surprise and as a deacon I've learned to to follow people and and in this case I've said this many times over the pulpit and this goes back decades now social media gives us deacons and Ministry great insight into what's going on in people's lives and I would tell my wife I'd say this person's on the way out this person's on the way out and this person's on the way why because of what they liked what they repeated what they shared and what they commented on it showed me what they were feeding on and they didn't have to say a word to me in church because I could see what the pattern was there but then when you talk to them in church and you go to their home for fellowship and they'd say these little things and you'd catch something you'd say that's a bit odd or you'd say and this is going to sound self-righteous but I wouldn't even think to go down that road or I wouldn't even think to bring that into my home and they'd start saying well I like this or I like that and no it's no harm this and you start say whoa there's something bigger going on here and pretty soon what happened is they walked away and and and literally within the next year or two of those people that left they went into atheism they went into divorce they went into becoming a drunk they went into single pregnancy and they went into being alone with marriages destroyed virtually everyone I know had their lives destroyed within three years why because they were living a lifestyle without the life sometimes we get caught in the middle of things and we've got to have discernment and we've got to try and make a decision who's right and who's wrong you know how you do it first you pray you pray second you go to the word the full word all the word and number three look at the long-term fruits that you can see because the fruits of the past will be the fruits of the future what they've had before they'll have in the future and if you look at what has been the pattern along you'll usually see that someone is usually right and somebody's usually wrong it's very simple to do it that way right we don't have to go in and try and discern this situation sometimes you just have to discern the people and that'll usually tell you who's right and who's wrong in these things but there's always been two groups and we're at a Harvest Time and this is the this is the heart this is where the fruits are known good or bad this is where it's coming out amen then this is where we're going to find out remember brother Brown says you're going to be surprised who made it and you're also going to be surprised who didn't make it but this is a shaking time but it's a proving time and it's a time where everybody gets to see him we're going to be surprised if we haven't already by the fruits that come out of some of our lives I trust we're going to be surprised in a good way amen Lord help us to produce the good fruit amen as Paul said not as if I have attained already amen but trusting that that what he's done already he'll continue amen he'll be faithful to complete it Jesus would say or this is again Jesus continuing then said the Jews unto him he says now we know that thou Hast the devil because after this you know he said you're of your father the devil and they went back and Abraham's our father and all these different things and he said before Abraham was I am and he comes into this but he says now we know that thou Hast the devil Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou says if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death are thou greater than our Father Abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead who make us thou thyself Jesus answered if I honor myself my honor is nothing the biggest sign of somebody that needs a new birth is that they can tell you everything great about them and nobody else can the priesthood had their lineage they had the proof of their lineage they have proof of their faithfulness to the law they have proof of this they have proof of that and Jesus said you're everyone dead just like the prophets the fathers are every one of them he says you're dead you're white and sepulchers but he says if I honor myself my honor is nothing my reputation can't come for me it has to come from you your reputation has to come from the people next to you not of yourself he says it is my father that honoreth me so we don't pat ourselves on the back it's got to come from the father he says of whom you say that he is your god yet ye have not known him but I know him and if I should say I know him not I shall be a liar like unto you Jesus was a hard preacher at times he says if I said I didn't know God I'd be a liar just like you are but I know him and I keep his saying he's just twisting the knife he's just calling them out and you'll find in scriptures in different portions they walk away and they are so angry this is when they want to kill him because he has laid bare who they are he's made completely obvious who they are and that's when they wanted to kill him not with the signs and wonders when he showed them who they really were that's when they started to try and kill him and they started with his reputation and then they finished with his body he says your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad then said the Jews unto him thou are not yet 50 years old and hast thou seen Abraham and Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you before Abraham was I am now if we look at what Jesus is talking about in scripture and really we're giving the big picture view of who Jesus Christ is Jesus said Abraham was glad to see me in his in my day in his life do you know there's a day of the Lord for each one of us there's a day of the Lord where he comes to each one of us personally and directly in our lives and he says Abraham was glad for it not everyone's glad before because if they don't recognize her they turn it down it's judgment but Abraham was glad because it meant something to him but when did Abraham see him Abraham saw him in Melchizedek but the the day that he's talking about in my day when Abraham was glad was when Elohim stepped down and it was Elohim because remember Abraham called him Lord he stepped down into a body and he brought two Messengers with him and he sat down under a tree and he ate a steak and he and he and he drank and and he had a meal with Abraham and then he told Abraham he says I'm about I personal pronoun pronoun am about to bring the promise to pass in your life and about the time is it supposed to happen in the cycle of a woman Sarah's going to have a baby Abraham was glad why because God came down and said the promise is about to be fulfilled that's why Abraham was glad there was something going on in his life but God didn't have a reveal name back then he had titles and he had expressions and these different things but he didn't have a revealed name and if we go back to the time of Moses and I'm just teaching here tonight it says that Moses said unto God behold when I came under when I come unto the children of Israel and shall say unto them this is his burning bush experience the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall I say unto them and God said unto Moses I am that I am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel I am has sent me unto you and God said moreover under Moses Thou shalt thus say unto the children of Israel the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob has sent me unto you this is my name forever what I am and this is my Memorial unto all generations what a name church I am the ever-present ever living God not just I was and not just I will be but I'm here right now that's how God wants to be identified is here and now that's the revelation of Jesus Christ that's the mystery of the revealing of Christ is that it is not just yesterday and it's not just forever but it is today right now and this is the name he said is forever is the I am the I am you can count on this name amen if I could put it that way but where was God in this situation God was in a Celestial body he was in a a pillar of fire and he was hiding in a bush and he was speaking and he was seen but he wasn't being manifested he was in existence but he wasn't in manifestation and God was wanting to drop down now into manifestation and he had to get a prophet to do this thing God was talking to Moses why because God was trying to come into the physical world God was trying to step down from the heavenlies into react into a a a a a a an action into a situation with the with his family and he continues he said and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows for I am come down personal pronoun I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians so God's saying I've come down now and I'm here and it's been 400 plus years but I'm down now to bring the promise to pass which I said unto them and where did that I am reside for the next 40 odd years with Moses he was with Moses the entire time remember the people put him out and the people put him away but he was always right there with my with Moses so remember where we read that brother Brahm said the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God so when God interprets his word when God vindicates his word when God brings his word to pass that is the manifestation of his word for that day that is the manifestation of his name for that day so what was Moses going down as he was walking into Egypt he was the manifestation of I am for that day what was it what was the name that he was manifesting I am come down to deliver thee that was the name that Moses was coming in he was coming in the name of I am come down to deliver and how do we know because he came down and he delivered them that was Christ the word right there Moses was literally the word for his day that was Jesus Christ being revealed that was God being revealed amen but it was only for a season but for That season Moses was the word made flesh brother Branham says this he says Noah was the Vindicated word for his day do you believe that and then he says well his message won't work today Moses was the Vindicated word of his day do you believe that it won't work for now John was the Vindicated word you believe that it wouldn't work in the days of Jesus certainly not he said the law and the prophets were until John and since then the Kingdom of Heaven the apostles them who set forth the Bible here come Luther out in Reformation his words and his church won't work today Wesley's won't Pentecost won't but it worked in their day why because it was the word for their day and that made it effective but today what is it they caught the inspiration of the word for their day God came down and Vindicated it in them personally and they lived it out and that was the revealing of God for that age and they didn't just capture it and they didn't just hear it and they weren't just inspired but they became the word for their day brother Bradham said that's why you can't separate the messenger from his message because then we'll get into this he's got to receive it and then he's got to become it to deliver to the people so that they'll have something to believe not just words but they'll see a life change they'll see a life manifested that's why they're the first fruit that's why they're the wave offering amen they didn't just have it but they became it it wasn't just something they could carry but it was the ungrafted word that was in their hearts and in their lives amen we have to come to the same place where we don't just say Amen but we say let it be so be it let it be in my life Lord let this word live in me don't let me just acknowledge it with intellect in mind but let me capture it inside of me and let it come out that's what we're looking for is the what the manifested word for our day amen what is it the manifestation of the name is God of God is in the doing not just the receiving don't stop at receiving because if you truly receive you'll do because if you truly hear you'll be a doer of the word and not a hearer only if someone were to ask you and Moses day and say where is God they'd say he's right there they point to Moses remember we talked about he had the The Shining face and these different things he'd been in the presence of God so much and when Moses said something it happened remember brother Brown talked about him we've shared the courts where he says when you say something something happens when Moses said something it happened why because he was the manifested word for his day and they'd point to Moses and then when it was Joshua's day they point to Joshua and they'd say that's where God is right now God is in that man God is manifested in that one why because God was working in them to produce the promised word for their day that's how they knew that God was with them was they could see the word coming to life in that person's life we've got to see the same thing happening today it can't just be God With Us it's got to be God in us very familiar scripture in first John he says ye are of God do you realize where you come from this more this evening church you are of God you come from God he says and little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you in you than he that is in the world what is it it's God in us it's Christ in us the hope of glory as we read last service God has to be in us not just by us not just with us but in us because that's the victory that we need more than anything is victory over self and that means he's got to be king and he's got to be Lord not just savior he's got to be in us working from the inside out where we can say he is me and I am him we are the same thing that's the invisible Union of the Bride In Christ we're talking about names today and I want to tie in this thought of the promise being tied to a name change of the word of God being tied to a name change and we're looking to build a big picture before we really start to dig into to our portion on this and I'm going to go straight to the end of the Bible in Revelation it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to Eid of the Hidden Manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it brother Braham says this he says it was a white stone meaning not his own righteousness but God's Own righteousness and in this Stone was a name a name that no one knew but the one who received it himself he says he knew it but no one else could know it but him Now watch how he tells us what this means he says so when you hear these guys flatter you telling theirs they're John their Paul their Mary they're this that or the other don't you believe it because if it was he'd never say nothing about it in other words if you're a big shot in God's kingdom if you're one of the the called Messengers or if you're this or that or you have a great gift he says you won't go around talking about it because it's not you in the first place he says it's a name it's a recognition that is for you and you alone and you don't go around spreading it around he says don't you believe it because if they were he never say nothing about it see that's right he has to keep it to himself he knew no one knew but he himself but he knew why because every perfect Overcomer receives a new name in that way everyone so what's he saying he's saying the messenger because he's talking in the church ages there's a messenger at each one and he says in this church age he says that man is going to realize who he is but he can't go tell everyone what he is why because they've got to receive it by revelation they've got to understand what's going on they've got to place them in the scripture and figure out what's going on so they can receive the word for their day he says he can't just go around and tell everyone who he is and you'll see Jesus didn't do it only in a very few instances was he obvious about what he said and it was usually to his disciples and it was only at the very end where they said art thou the Christ and he said thou Hast said it you said it he said didn't say I'm not saying he's saying you're right but I'm not going to say it but you said it and I'll confirm that what you said was right because they're not going around making a name for themselves because it isn't about them it's about the name that they're revealing which is Christ the word now righteousness he says here it's God's Own righteousness righteousness is the works of God and the works of God is the will of God and the will of God is the word of God for you in your day can you follow that through the works of God is the will of God which is the word of you so if you do the will of God you receive righteousness because righteousness means to do good and we do lots of good we've read the scripture there in in Matthew 7 where it says that they'll come in that day and say do we not do many wonderful Works in their name and all these thy name and all these things and they did what they thought were good works but it wasn't the will of God so therefore it wasn't good and that's where the world gets messed up today is because they say well and I talked about I think about the the car dealer I spoke with a little while ago and he says well I think I've done good doesn't matter what you think good is determined by that which is good and there's only one good Jesus said and that's God so if God says it's good it's good and otherwise it's not good it's not even acceptable it's it's filthy rags it's vomit it's lukewarm it's it's tainted by your preference by your desire for something yourself you've got yourself injected into it so God doesn't do it but our idea of good is never correct and that's why we have to go to the word and that's why we have to find the will of God for our age we said before Noah was righteous because he did what God Said remember Noah was not a particularly righteous man afterwards was he no I had all sorts of Hang-Ups Abraham all had all sorts of Hang-Ups lots of these Great Men David had Hang-Ups but they did the will of God and it was accounted to them for righteousness because they did what he said and God didn't look at the rest that was under the blood of the Lambs and Bulls and these different things but he looked at what they did was right and he says and the scripture says that it was what it was accredited to them for righteousness why because they did what God told them to do so to be righteous today I can't go and do Noah's work it's the word what Noah did is in the word it's the word of God but it's not the word of God for today so if I go out and I build an ark and I try and bring in a bunch of animals I'm doing the word but it's not righteousness because it's not the word for my day that's why we needed a prophet Messenger to come and tell us here's the word for your day here's what you're supposed to be focused on here's what you're supposed to be doing so to be righteous today I have to do the will of God which is the word of God for today and that's where righteousness is and that's why he's given us it says he's given us his righteousness what did he do he came and gave us our his word he gave us his word for our day and said this is what's going to get you over the line this is what's going to clothe you this is what's going to cover you is my word and as long as you've got that then that's going to be okay but brother Branham says every perfect Overcomer receives a new name in that way so the question is how do we get a new name where do we find it what's the name how's it given to you the clue is in the scripture we just read back here in Revelation 2 it says a new state a stone with a new name was written and we look in that and God is identifying here the man for that church age just like he did Moses and Samuel and all these great prophets and remember brother Brown says you get all through the church ages you get all the benefits of everyone before you you get all of it he says that's available as you move past it each one gets what's behind them plus what is allocated for their age as well but he's identifying that man and that that angel messenger just like he did Moses and Samuel and all those great prophets and he's putting that name in that man and what is his name his name is the word it's his first identified name is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God remember that's his first name but that man is not God but he speaks as God because he's catching what the holy spirit says and he's bringing What God Says to the people and that's where God's name is is in the man that brings his word he's a messenger not an author catch that he's a messenger not an author he's a microphone not a speaker it's the Holy Spirit speaking he's just the microphone amen he comes under Authority with authority he comes under Authority with authority now God knows who that man is and then he lets him know who he is he lets them know his day he lets him know his message and then he sends him out there amen we read in the Book of Revelation for each Church age where it says to him that overcometh doesn't say to them it says to him singular to one person that overcomes he says I'm going to go and I'm going to give him all these overcoming rewards but yet you'll hear me preach and every other preacher that knows his Bible and they'll say but we get all the same thing and brother Branham would say this and I don't have the quote here but it was in my notes and when he read this this the scripture we just read he said he says he noticed he says him singular he says this reward is only to the messenger for that age and yet I'm up here like I said in every other minister we know is sitting there and saying that we all get the reward but the scripture says it's only to him it's only to the angel messenger what is it see he has to overcome first that's the beauty of what we saw in the in the in the life of the of our Prophet William Branham is that we saw God moving and creating that vessel for adoption we literally saw the development of a prophet in a way that we've never been able to see through time we saw insights he told us all sorts of personal things he showed us where he messed up he showed us where he did right he showed us how not to make mistakes he did all these things and he had to literally remember he fought for so long he had these visions and these different things and he fought for so long and he tried to get away from it and he tried to push it away and he had all these preachers saying get away from it it's not of God it's satanic and he had to fight his way through it until he could come to the place in the scripture where he recognized what that gift was and then he moved with that gift and then as he moved with that gift and he went from first pull to Second pole and then the angel comes down he tells him as Moses had the different signs you're going to have the two signs and I send you as a messenger and he had to literally believe that message he had to believe what the Holy Spirit was saying to him and then he had to let it take effect in his life so that when he went and he preached it he was living it not just talking it and that was literally God revealed in this age that's why brother Brown would say those that say I'm God are closer to the truth than those that say I'm not but he would say I am a son of man which is a Ministry revealing the son of man which is Christ the word but it was Christ revealing himself through that man amen and that what they were trying to do was get the holy the people to hear what the Holy Spirit was saying to the church age that's why we believe in a prophet today amen we're Gentiles we're not Jews and yet we believe in a prophet because we're in a gentile dispensation of seven Church ages and he said I'm going to send Messengers to every Church age and that's the only one one that's our only opportunity to overcome is to hear what the holy spirit said to that man otherwise you are lost why because you've got to catch the word for your day you've got to understand what the revealing of the word is you've got to understand what the interpretation is the revealing of God for your day and it was in a man named William Branham not just for him but for the rest of us because it's got to go from him to us remember what was he doing we had to have a prophet see in the first church age message or the church age First Church age messenger had to be a prophet because he was what he was revealing the Grace Covenant that was we needed a prophet for that to bring the word and afterwards it was falling away from it and then as we come back we need a prophet to restore the word in between you just have reformers brother Brandon would say that's it just reformers trying to get us back to it but we got to the point we were so far away from the truth that we needed a prophet to come and restore us back to what it actually meant to be truth because they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit Azusa Street and in truth that's what we needed was the truth after it we needed the spirit to Quicken that to bring us to true life and you can't have true life unless you have the truth itself Amos 3 7 has never gone out of style God never removed this from his Bible it says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets that's it that's it there's always got to be a prophet when God's going to do something he sends it to a prophet no it doesn't always have to come to a prophet Prophet like we would say brother Bradham because we've got five full ministry prophets as well brother Brown would say that the the the uh the New Testament Prophet is a preacher and you'll see that in God's using men with gifts and he'll bring something to them and some of them is through dreams and visions and and tongues and these different things and then sometimes it's just as simple as the preaching of the word over the pulpit but they are literally prophesying and they're speaking the words of God into your life and it's up to you to catch whether that's God or not and it's life to you if you receive it and it's death if you don't but we come to that question how to receive the same reward that the messenger does scripture says only he gets it but yet I'm sitting here saying we all get it I get it you get it we're all in this together but for one the word has the same effect if you receive the word it has the same effect that it does on him so you receive the word that the prophet brings then you'll get what the prophet had not the gifts necessarily but you'll get the you'll get the effect of the word in your life because if you receive the same word it's got to have the same effect the life has the life the life will produce the life every single time right we said he's a first fruit offering and it's proof that the message he brings works that's what you know my wife and I have talked about this many times and and kind of her statement has been there's a reason why we believe brother Branham and it's because he lived a life that we've never seen anybody else live since the days of Christ since the days of the Apostles nobody did it nobody did it the way he did it with such with such transparency I think as well Brian will put it this way he says God needs no one to interpret the word to him I was reading in Isaiah the other day where he says show me who's ever taught God show me who's ever counseled him no one we got nothing to offer God he interprets it himself by vindicating it he says by making it real not just preaching making it real and When God says he'll do a certain thing then he does it and there's no more question to it that's the way he does it so God has made a way for us God loves his children he loves his people he wants to help them he wants to help you more than you want help if you can just get that in your heart that God is more willing to help you than you are to help yourself that's love he says but he has a way and that's the only way that he'll work is through his way you must come to his terms not your terms his terms he says you want it a certain way but he gives it to you his way in Moses day no doubt they said I don't want to go on a big boat full of stinky animals that are just going to make noise noise the rest of the time you know what I want a luxury cruise I want a big yacht I want a big 15-story Cruise liner where we got food the whole time and entertainment and everything and maybe they went and built a different kind of boat but it wasn't God's design and they didn't have a cruise right you might want the right thing but you got to receive it the way that he gives it and that's always been the problem hasn't it the problem is to receive it the way God brings it rather than bring your own interpretation or this is the way God's got to do something in my life but there's a second promise we're talking about why do we get it when it says only the prophet gets it or the messenger for that age remember Matthew 10 41 it says he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward now how does a Prophet come does he come in his name did Elijah come in the name of Elijah did Samuel come in the name of Samuel did Moses come in the name of Moses no when a prophet comes he comes in what the name of the Lord because they would say thus saith the Lord they wouldn't say thus saith Samuel because it wasn't their message they weren't coming in their name they were coming in the name of the Lord so whoever truly receives that Prophet with a real Revelation understands and receives that that is coming from God himself that's what we're recognizing when we read a message book we believe that is the holy spirit speaking to this church it points us back to here this is our absolute but that message points us back to this time and time again I love how brother Jason Watkins says he says I have tried and I haven't found anywhere where that message doesn't line up with this word why because the Holy Spirit can't disagree with his word in leadership in preaching in Doctrine in life it doesn't matter it's got to line up with the word amen so we receive that prophet in the name of the Lord and so when that Prophet speaks we say that is not a man speaking that's God speaking and you've received him in the name of what the prophet you don't receive it we don't receive this message in the name of William Branham William Branham would never want it in fact he said I have to leave the I'd have to leave the field because they're putting me in a place where I'm not supposed to be but we receive it as from God because he came in the name of the Lord and brother Brown would say that's thus saith the Lord that's thus saith the Lord that's thus saith the Lord that's thus saith the Lord nothing else I was sharing with one of the brothers the other day where brother Graham said he said I could sit here maybe and God would show me who the next president is going to be and so I tell you his name and I'll tell you when it's going to be he says and what would that do he says it'd just make me a big name it would have nothing to do with the kingdom of God and nothing for the kingdom of God but it would make me a big name and you know what most of the so-called prophets out there trying to do predict presidents and when the last election came and Trump got put out almost every single one of them had prophesied that he was going to be in why because they were trying to build a name they were trying to build a following remember brother Brandon he saw the big university and he saw the big headquarters for those different um those different evangelists and different ones and and he said wow the Lord must just not trust me you know what it was God kept him from that because he was building for the kingdom of God and look at every one of those men and what do they do they go and they build a kingdom for themselves and they fall in the end why because they got off the road of coming in somebody else's name they didn't come in the name of the Lord they came in the name of Oral Roberts or these different ones and these different things amen Moses why did he say who do I say sent me because Moses said I can't come in my name my name's mud they knew I was a deliverer I knew I was delivered and I messed up so I can't come in the name of a deliverer because I already tried that and it didn't work so he says you got to give me a different name to come in he says you got to give me your name because my name's no good for this Church our name's no good for what we're about to do it's not going to work he says when he met Moses he had not a name yet he didn't have a revealed name yet if I could put it that way he wasn't at that stage of his Plan of Redemption and he told Moses I am that I am then when we see Jesus on Earth speaking in Saint John the sixth chapter he said I am that I am they said why you're a man not over 50 years old and you say you've seen Abraham he said before Abraham was I am and I am was the one The Burning Bush the pillar of fire that was in the burning bush in the days of Moses the I am the I am so Moses had a new name now and it was what I am what was it manifesting Deliverance like I said he came in the name of I am come down to deliver thee that was the I am for that day we've got a different I am today we've got a different I am what is it our I am is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever our I am is the bride of Christ Mrs Jesus Christ and we'll get into this probably in the next service or two amen but he came down as I am come down to deliver that was the I am that he was coming for in that day and his purpose was revealed in his name catch that his purpose was revealed in his name he came down as I am come down to deliver and so Deliverance was what must follow and he was the word revealed and manifested in his day remember brother Brahm said the word interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God and Moses came and he did what he manifested the name of God I am come down to deliver and he delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians brother man puts it this way he says so much word is allotted to each generation basically saying so much only a little bit or only a portion is allotted to each generation watch now he says God sends someone in there and identifies that word by his interpretation of himself someone to what interpret God not just say it but interpret it by what identified manifestation remember what brother Brown would say I literally read this just in in the the office there he said the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you that means you are an interpretation of Christ that means I am an interpretation of Christ not the fullness that's already happened in Christ but there's a portion that's allotted to you for this time and this season and it's up to you to manifest it Moses didn't get a name change personally my name's going to stay is Jonathan curlette as long as I'm on this Earth Moses name stayed the same but he came in the name of I am and when they asked him who sent you he says I am and he said I am come down to deliver and I'm here to deliver and they had to believe it and receive it in order for it to go right and Moses didn't have to do all this hype and dancing and shouting and everything he had one experience church one experience with the burning bush with the pillar fire and he was sealed for life we never see Moses backing off we never say Moses saying I don't believe it Moses was go go go go go and he believed God absolutely from then on takes one real experience one real experience to give you your revelation of who you are in Christ and you'll never walk back that's why Jesus said no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom means you haven't got your name changed yet means you haven't got your identification yet of the word for your day but let's come back to that phrase brother Branham said he said every perfect Overcomer receives a new name in that way so he says there's a name change that's associated with over company there's a there's a name change that's associated with the word becoming flesh there's a name change associated with the promise of the word coming into your life and it's God's doing not ours we don't change our name God changes our name the father changes the name of the son the husband changes the name of the wife at the marriage amen why God controls the timing the father controls the timing for the adoption he says did you notice Abraham was called Abram but when God went to use him he changed his name to Abraham when God's ready to use him he changes his name he says Sarai was s-a-r-a-i was Sarai but when God was going to use her he changed her name to Sarah Sarah the princess he says did you know that Jacob was supplanter and a supplanter is a deceiver but when he wrestled with the Lord all night long and overcome and was blessed God changed his name Jacob to Israel a prince with God and it's actually a prince having power with God Paul was called Saul until he met the holy spirit in the form of a light that shined down upon him and his name was changed from Saul to Paul Simon when he met Jesus he changed his name to Peter listen he says and when Jesus overcome his name was changed and he will reveal that name he that will be with him overcome as he has received a new name and I'll reveal my new name to him see I look that up I'd never heard it before and it's a new name that's going to be revealed later because down here we'll see that there's only one name given here but there's another name over there that he'll be known by he says and every Overcomer I mean among them such as that them leaders and so forth now all the children of Israel didn't get their name changed of course that's right but those High leaders when they overcome they have received a new name he says see how it dovetails in just perfectly now don't get caught up on this idea of high leaders meaning well only the ministry or only the elders no no what he's saying is only the elect only the elect got those name changed right Abraham was special he was a father but he was the elect Sarah was mostly in doubt half of her life and yet she was what she was the elect she was elected to overcome she was elected to have the child she was elected to go through things and get a body change in these different things you've got a name change if you're a part of the elect group remember not all that art say Christ Our Christ not all that say Christian or Christian not all that say message believer message believer but the true sons of God and the true Daughters of God they'll be identified because there's a name change that's given to them he says and to show him what he was going to do he's talking about Abraham he changed his name in the 17th chapter and he changed Sarah's name that's right watch those names they mean something why did he change Jacob's name to Israel why did he change Saul's name to Paul why did he do all those things he says after he overcome and entered into his glory he said that his name was changed in Revelation it's given a promise to those that overcome he would make known his new name that's right every time they overcome they were given a new name so there's a name change associated with overcoming Abraham when he finally overcome he was taken from the name of Abraham and said You shall not be called Abram anymore but shall be called Abraham notice he says Abraham has overcome had overcome and then he gets the name change but where was he overcoming in Abraham's life he didn't have Isaac yet but he had a name change before he had Isaac and brother Brown says he had overcome by then he says give him part of his name tacked it onto him Elohim h-i-m and H.A.M Elohim in other words he says I am the father of all things what was he doing he was saying I am doing this he says it's me it's God that's doing it you're getting my name added to yours because I'm the one that's working in you and with you but notice it was only a part of his name why because it was a type it was a type it wasn't perfect it was a type it was partial he said see and I'm making you a father of Nations so I've changed and I give you part of my name father of Nations ham see Elohim Abraham he says and he was the father of nations in other words the name change took effect that's what he was saying God changed his name and then he made him what the name was now it didn't look like it did it he gave him one son one son and that was the Fulfillment of father of many nations that's why I said most people are going to miss it it's going to be so simple that they'll think that it has to be some Grand thing the father of many nations was one son and that was the Fulfillment of the Overcomer in that age he says oh isn't that beautiful to that old man an old woman a hundred years old now he says the promise is fixing to be fulfilled he gives them the name change and the name change means something's about to happen something's about to change the promise is about to occur the word is about to be manifested God is stepping on the scene and he's going to do it because it's his timing now let's look at this as we start to close just one last thing to nail it down in Matthew it says and Jesus answered and said unto him he's talking to Simon Peter he says blessed art thou Simon barjona Simon son of Jonah that's his natural heritage that's his natural family Simon have been adopted he had a daddy and his dad's name was Jonah he said for flesh and blood is not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter here's your new name Simon barjona your new name is Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it he didn't build the church on Peter Peter in the Greek is Petra and it means rocker Little Rock Peter was not immovable Peter still needed a new birth Peter was still carnal Peter was still sinful amen but once he got the new birth he was solid and Peter never went back after he got the new birth after the upper room experience he went from a man that could not identify himself with the ministry of Christ to a man that could go out and preach to everybody that was there that's what a name change does for us Church but it's got to go through a new birth in this age amen but what is it on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand that's where the Revelation is amen but he gave him a new name because it was pointing to what he was going to do in Peter's life that's what's going on here he's saying Peter there's something good coming for you down the road and he's changing his name and he's saying I've got a purpose personal purpose for you and you'll stand when you've got to stand you're going to fail before then and Peter did fail but you're going to stand when it matters and when you stand it's going to have an effect because the name that I've given you is representative of the work that I'm going to do in your life and how I'm going to use you for the kingdom of God it might be a fight don't think it's not a fight don't think Peter didn't have to fight but he'll stand when God needs him to stand because he's been given a name that represents the word for him amen he said and I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven what was the name signifying what was the name change signifying something's about to happen Peter Peter you got a great revelation but you got a ways to go but I'm letting you know you got a different name because there's a purpose for the word to be manifested in your life and it's about to come get ready Peter there's something coming for your life amen let's stand together if we would you know Peter went through a lot over those next few months the name change means something's about to happen you know what that means there's often a gap Abraham and Sarah at most had at least nine months to wait before they had that baby who knows how long it was before she started to show that she was pregnant but we we know a body change happened very quickly and that was a sign that there was more to come and we look at Peter and he had to go through a lot before he got to the promise being fulfilled he slept he fell he failed he backslid he denied Christ and then he went back and he fished naked on his boat but that didn't stop the promise of God why because when he gives you his name it means his word has to be fulfilled because his name is his word and his word will not return unto him void amen he turned him into a fisher of man from a man that couldn't even admit that he knew Christ that's a 180. that's a big transformation he was our Bluster and and and and bragging and and this sat and the other and then when the time came he couldn't stand but Jesus said don't worry Peter I prayed for you I prayed for you I gave you a new name I revealed myself to you and when you're converted he says go strengthen everybody else with the strength that I've given you brother Brian would say this is our last quote he says he met a man one time and his name was Simon and he changed his name to rock Peter why he had the keys is that right he changed his name and made him a rock Peter had the keys because he was the one who had the keys to the kingdom a new name a new name written in this rock that no one knows but he himself he knows who he is but he can't tell others see no one knows but himself see Peter knows he had the keys but you didn't hear him bragging about it see these guys who brag about what they are is usually nothing uh-huh he says a White Rock and ended a new name not his own name but he's somebody else that only he himself knows he that's got the rock the name he said see special Manna to feed the church remember that's why this third poll that's why this end time bride of Christ is not going to be a public show I was talking to somebody a while ago and they said well why don't you go tell people all about this why don't you go tell people who you are in this sentence the other thing I said because that's not what we're called to do we're not supposed to go and make a show we're not here to cater to the whims of this world but we give eternal life by giving them the word that's the only way we can do it when Peter opened the the the the the kingdoms and he opened up to the Gentiles what did he do he didn't go with a lock he went with the word and he went and he opened it up and then as he went there then it was opened up and all of a sudden everybody started coming in and these different things and it's no different today we go and we express what the word but don't go around and say I'm this and you're not I'm better than you I've got power to do so I've got power to do that and no no no why because we're led by the spirit of God but we give the word everywhere we go we live it above all other things and then we share it as well amen it's not going to be a public show we're not here to tell everybody what we are but we're here to tell him I come in the name of the Lord when we speak people ought to realize there's somebody else's speaking you know when we have Roy come here and he doesn't understand what's going on but he knows it's something different he knows it's something different he's not sure where to place it yet that's what it ought to be when people look at us they say you know our speech ought to betray us you know our speech out of betrayed so people ought to look at what we do and how we do it and why we do it they ought to say there's something different about those people and we ought to be say yeah I used to be just like you maybe not just like you some of us because we've been raised in Christian homes but I used to think like you do and guess what I got changed I got a new name I'm a New Creation in Christ my wife shared something with me the other day and it it was a person saying you know what but I was born like this and Christ said back that's why you need a new birth amen we were all born different than where we are right now remember we needed a new birth and when we did that we took on a new name what Christ Christian Mrs Jesus Christ is what brother Brandon would say the Bride of the Living God Amen there's a name change that's given to us we've got a different name now and it means what that there's a word that's going to be manifested that is being manifested in our lives today amen that's all we're trying to do live the word for our day Not Another Day and not what somebody tells us to do I think that's the greatest danger is that we get in and we try and give a message in a way that the person wants it and it never works it never works but we've got to give it as he gives it to us and then they can take it or they can turn it down and all we've got to try and do is be salty in it all amen just be salty amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord you've called us Lord are you predestinating us you Justified us you Sanctified us you've placed Us in Heavenly places in Christ Lord you've given us a new name Lord you've given us your name Lord You've entrusted us with your word not just to speak it Lord but to live it and Lord we're asking Lord that like Moses did and like Samuel did and like David did and the apostles did Lord that we'd not just be hearers Lord but we be doers as well heavenly father that each one of us Lord would take that portion of the word that's allotted to us Lord and that we'd live it out nor not look at what each one is doing Lord but look to ourselves in the word and say let your word live in me Lord would you grant us Grace each one Lord let our days be Lord season with salt Lord that people will be thirsty around us Lord that they desire the life that we have Lord and that we point them to you always Lord May our witness May Our Testimony be that we've got a life-changing God that's living inside of us and then he's got Open Arms of Grace for each and every one and all remembering the many sick amongst us playing your touch Lord for them each one Lord

[Music] amen hallelujah praise the Lord [Music] amen amen praise the Lord if you want to just have a seat for a minute or two um I need to just update everybody on what's happening with the next phase and that is the carpeting that's uh I guess everybody figured that one out by now so carpeting is is next to be done and uh it looks like now Monday is the time when it will start it's a three-day job and uh and I guess maybe at least three days so it'll start sometime Monday and I don't know exactly the time but so it'll go into certainly into Wednesday uh maybe even into Thursdays for all I know so it's likely um it's likely that we won't be having service I don't think maybe the deacons can they have no service right okay so it won't be a service on Wednesday night that's right protocol is going to be available as well so uh so there won't there won't be a service and as well before I forget we won't um we won't be eating out there on Sunday either in the fellowship hall because that's going to be full of all these pews and everything else that we can and we can stuff in there so what what this is is kind of is a call for volunteers okay from the brothers in particular we we're going to need some help was what we have to do is as you can see now we've moved out to pews from boat Wings here and put them in the in the fellowship hall uh next thing we have to do is we have to take up all this carpet and all all the borders that are around as well so a little bit of work to that then when you get those up then we got the brackets to take out of the concrete floor so and I I'll probably be at that a little bit uh myself and uh Brother David during the day in polymeric maybe uh to try and get up some some of the carpet to make it easier we will leave a few pews uh here for Sunday okay so we're all spread apart here now but we won't be spread apart too much on Sunday because we're going to take some of those as many as we can dare take out uh and and get them into the fellowship hall and then what that means is that just like we did the last time we were getting ready for the painting uh after after church on Sunday we're going to need the brothers again to be able to take uh take the rest of the pews out and take the pulpit out and take the organ over the next of those next few days so what I'm asking for sun Saturday if uh is for some brothers to come and give us a hand to take out those big pews there and to help rip up the carpet whatever is not done everything is going to be careful like from back here right to the door so you can see there's a bit of work that has to be done we don't have to move the piano I don't think that's the only thing that won't come out and I can't come off the floor out of this out of this particular room so what the installers have told us is that we had a few bodies here lifted they'll Slide the carpet out air in okay we'll slide it out ourselves but we will um we might just need a couple of us and they they volunteered to give us a hand to uh to put in the new carpet underneath drop the panel down and we're back in business okay on that point so um that's what will happen there uh I would ask that even starting tonight if you have anything at all in your Pew take it out take it home with you uh like your you know your books or Bibles ending for the kids and that please take it out because as you know it could get mislaid and when you can do it a Sunday as well you can start tonight but at least by Sunday get get everything out of the pew take it home and then when we have service again you can you know bring back what you got to bring back so uh and uh please keep the pews after every service of course keep them keep them tidy as you have been so we I'm sure the cleaners appreciate that um so um yeah so I know that Matthew and thanks especially to brother Isaac here he's been working hand in hand with Matt past couple of nights uh to do to do the work over there in the booth there are pulling wires and they're soldering and they're doing all kinds of stuff and under guidance of brother Levi so uh that that's uh that's work that is ongoing and they may end up able to put I mean about a day on brother Isaac going out of town for a day or two it'll be back Friday evening and they'll be here is over here on Saturday to help as well so uh when we we appreciate that for sure so uh anybody that's not here um I will say I'll send an email out anyway just confirming that whoever could be here on Saturday morning it may not take all day I don't know what I really don't know how long it's going to take because I don't know how how difficult it's going to be to rip up that carpet I know the border is a little tricky but uh I know here it's not going to be too bad it's but hopefully within a few hours we might have we might have it done but uh if you could just spare as much time as possible that would be a great help to this to this whole trustee and the other old trustees any help any helps appreciate it so I that's about all I wanted to say I just I just felt it was time for me to update everybody uh on behalf of the trustees just to uh just so that you knew what's what's going to happen so things are going to get a little bit hectic a little bit busy but and I think Matt Smith said it's for even setting up the the technical aspects here to video the audio and all that stuff they still got more work to do and it's going to be just like that that happened there you know a little Fade Out there's going to be some technical difficulties periodically so patience my mother always said patience is a virtue of possess it if you can right so let's um that's just being for one for another God has brought us this far and I believe it'll bring us right through to the end and this is apparently be a between the next uh between this and the next couple of projects that we got to finish up the roof and uh repair to the pavement outside those will be the biggest things left to do and what what better man and them are doing once that's done we should be able to just I I shouldn't say it too loud but have a kind of a easier summer you know like where we can just catch up back home me for one so that's uh that's all I wanted to say that uh we can sure appreciate your help and cooperation and at least your prayers Okay so let's work together as as one body so thanks for for that and uh I will send an update to especially to those that we're not here would need to know uh okay thanks so you want to stand again let's just pray Heavenly Father we want to thank you once again for your grace Lord and most of all Lord we want to thank you for your word Lord the word that we heard tonight father and pray that you would help us Lord to absorb that word father and take it into our hearts Lord and father let you father manifest that word within us Lord we thank you Father for Lord for showing us who we are Lord in this late time
