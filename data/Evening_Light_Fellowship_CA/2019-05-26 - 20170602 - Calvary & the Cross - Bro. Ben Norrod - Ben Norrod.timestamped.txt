[15:57] you mind lord bless you thank God for
[16:01] his strength if there's ever an hour
[16:03] that we needed it is now and some would
[16:07] think well maybe it was the early ages
[16:10] when 68 million lay down their lives yes
[16:14] the Holy Ghost was there and they were
[16:17] encouraged a man they saw beyond the
[16:20] curtain of time and wanted his step
[16:22] there and and to lay down their lives or
[16:26] they were going from this dimension to
[16:28] another but in this hour they weren't
[16:32] living in this hour they weren't living
[16:33] in this age where and it is written that
[16:36] that there's going to be very few saved
[16:38] they want to live it in this hour where
[16:40] it is written if he didn't cut time
[16:42] short there be no flesh saved so we
[16:46] thank God for his strength to keep us
[16:49] moving on his strength to keep us
[16:51] pressing on it is straight to keep us
[16:54] praising the Lord amen and encouraging
[16:56] us in the promise for this day and age
[17:00] in the promise that they were looking
[17:03] forward to that you and I are looking to
[17:06] the reality of it the resurrection and
[17:08] the rapture the change of our bodies can
[17:11] go in again going from time to eternity
[17:15] amen and if you're the bride and you got
[17:18] the Holy Ghost and you want to go you
[17:22] want to go from time to eternity Jesus
[17:25] yeah and I excuse me for repeating it
[17:29] but again in the Alpha ministry he was
[17:32] there for thirty three and a half years
[17:34] and he wanted to go a man well I've been
[17:39] here for almost 16 almost 69 years and I
[17:43] want to go by the grace of God so he
[17:47] knew where he come from he knew why he
[17:49] was here and he wanted to go back to
[17:52] where he come from amen
[17:54] so we know where we come from we know
[17:56] why we're here and we want to go back to
[17:59] where we come from we want to get into
[18:01] that personal fellowship with our Lord
[18:03] Jesus Christ amen in a glorified body a
[18:07] mansard rod Elpis brothers sister
[18:09] that we're going to be calling for it
[18:11] and praying for it and believing for the
[18:14] change and again to remind you what the
[18:17] prophets say that God is waiting on you
[18:21] God is waiting on me don't wait on the
[18:24] Lord you'll miss it
[18:26] God has given us the revelation so that
[18:29] we're going to move into it by the grace
[18:31] of God by faith on a daily basis getting
[18:34] closer to the Lord look up because your
[18:37] Redemption draws nigh a man so the Lord
[18:40] ever bless you and we welcome our
[18:44] visitors our sister Priscilla's mom and
[18:47] dad all the way from Tucson wondering
[18:50] where this weather came from a man so
[18:53] thank the Lord a man thank the Lord that
[18:57] it's been warm for a couple of days and
[18:59] believing that our brother and sister
[19:00] brought it with the a man so we need it
[19:04] and around and our brother worthington
[19:10] from UConn he went back a little or too
[19:12] early and he missed it
[19:14] a man so trusting that he'll get it up
[19:16] there as well in the Yukon but he
[19:19] enjoyed his trip here and thoroughly and
[19:23] I was talking to his pastor for quite a
[19:26] while yesterday
[19:27] so we'll keep them in prayer they need
[19:30] prayer it's only he's only part of us a
[19:32] very small fellowship I believe it might
[19:34] be 15 15 brothers and sisters and most
[19:39] of them are sisters so remember our
[19:41] brother Willie our yes Dwayne
[19:44] Worthington and his past pastors brother
[19:47] Willie and McGowan I believe and so pray
[19:51] for them the grace of God be with them
[19:53] and the grace of God of course to the
[19:56] bride around the world because things
[19:59] are getting worse
[20:00] amen but the bride looks up for hers
[20:03] getting better amen and the hope is
[20:06] getting more precious by the grace of
[20:08] Almighty God we're a man the world is
[20:13] going to give birth to the to this bride
[20:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ and again to is
[20:19] something else regarding the Bride of
[20:21] Christ
[20:22] we're not the father
[20:23] God said in 64 were not going to a
[20:26] wedding he said we're going to a
[20:28] marriage supper he said we're married
[20:31] here a man so I pray God that it become
[20:36] more and more real to us that that we're
[20:38] married and that we are we are obligated
[20:41] to him our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[20:45] the bride is subject to the bridegroom
[20:47] amens I trust that we are subject to him
[20:50] in his leadership in our lives day in
[20:53] and day out god help us brother
[20:55] and I pray that Jesus is wildly I hope
[20:59] he's as real to you as the person
[21:01] sitting next to you a man I could say
[21:04] shake hands with Jesus
[21:06] where where well shake hands to the
[21:09] person next six sitting next to you
[21:12] you're shaking hands with Jesus because
[21:14] he is it is it is Christ in flesh Amen
[21:18] because the brother the part of God said
[21:20] that the bride is the alpha or the Omega
[21:24] rather the bridegroom was the Alpha he
[21:26] said the bride is the Omega a man so is
[21:30] Christ in the bride Christ made flesh
[21:32] and to bring on that resurrection to
[21:36] bring on that rapture the change of our
[21:38] bodies so God's grace be with us so the
[21:41] Lord bless you and we're praying grace
[21:43] to our our brother being nor out and
[21:45] sister nor artists they fellowship with
[21:47] us we look forward to the hearing of the
[21:49] word and we look forward to the if they
[21:53] have a on their hearts to sing as they
[21:56] did here the last time God blessed us
[21:58] with their singing God has blessed us
[22:01] with the Ministry of the word and
[22:03] trusting and believing that God will do
[22:05] it again amen
[22:07] so let's do this let's appreciate it
[22:09] let's let's hold on to it because the
[22:13] hour is coming when when you're when you
[22:15] will hear it for the last time that's
[22:17] right when when I may be our brother
[22:19] will minister for the last time will
[22:21] hear the ministry for the last time
[22:23] they're part of God said the hours
[22:24] coming when will won't even be allowed
[22:26] to pray for the sick easier they'll
[22:28] shoot you and so on if you pray for the
[22:31] sick so that hour is coming and it's not
[22:34] far away
[22:35] because the worldís world is getting
[22:37] more and more religious but less
[22:39] spiritual and they want us to they want
[22:41] us to be religious but not spiritual it
[22:45] will be spiritual in their eyes it's
[22:47] fanaticism you know it's to try and say
[22:49] oh you've got to do this you got to do
[22:51] that and you got to live this way gonna
[22:52] live that way no they just want to live
[22:54] related religiously Wednesdays and
[22:57] Sundays or maybe just Sunday and just
[23:00] just occasionally here and there no it's
[23:03] giving your life for him it's not you
[23:06] the lives it's not me that lives that's
[23:08] tremendous as Paul said but it's Christ
[23:10] that live within me amen so I trusted
[23:13] you yes amen I trust that we can all say
[23:17] amen to that to that to that statement
[23:20] to that revelation now you could go over
[23:23] there and you could look back through
[23:25] your life and say well that's not me
[23:26] that's Christ in me
[23:28] a manner back through this day that's
[23:30] not me that's Christ in me help us Lord
[23:34] so we can truly honestly say that it's
[23:37] not me that lives his Christ that liveth
[23:39] in me
[23:40] amen so the Lord ever blessed us and
[23:43] we're going to turn to service to our
[23:45] brother being to give them as much time
[23:49] as the Lord leads foreseen and/or the
[23:53] hearing of the word I said I said if

[23:57] said I might ask for a refund amen
[24:03] and yes because we want we want the

[24:16] wants us to have and don't had a word

[42:55] Amen so so so thankful for the Lord
[42:58] Jesus tonight aren't you happy to be a
[43:01] Christian Amen it's just a privilege and
[43:04] an honor to be named by the name of
[43:06] Jesus Christ and sir appreciate the Lord
[43:09] tonight amen I want to the Lord helping
[43:13] us I want to turn tonight to Matthew
[43:17] chapter 27 I will speak to you tonight
[43:22] on this this thought to the place which
[43:27] is called Calvary to the place which is
[43:31] called Calvary I will read three places
[43:35] tonight start Matthew then I want to go
[43:37] to mark 15 and then Luke 23 just a
[43:40] couple verses out of each chapter but
[43:42] just to get a kind of a well-rounded
[43:45] picture if you will of this particular
[43:49] scene of Calvary Matthew 27 verse 40 and
[43:54] saying thou that destroyest the temple
[43:57] bill to sit in three days save thyself
[44:01] if thou be the Son of God come down from
[44:04] the cross likewise also the chief
[44:07] priests mocking him with the scribes and
[44:11] elders said he saved others himself he
[44:15] cannot save if he be the king of Israel
[44:18] let him now come down from the cross and
[44:21] we will believe him we will believe him
[44:24] cannot can I draw your attention to who
[44:26] it is talking this isn't the chief
[44:28] drunks the chief prostitutes the chief
[44:31] gamblers these are the chief priests
[44:35] this is the preachers if you'll notice
[44:37] right the very ones that missed him ones
[44:40] are supposed to know him they're the
[44:41] ones that missed him
[44:43] right mark 15 verse 30 mark chapter 15
[44:48] verse 30 then we'll go to the Book of
[44:51] Luke now each each one of these are
[44:53] Calvary pictures truly but I want to try
[44:56] to show by the help of the Lord the
[44:58] different viewpoints that each rider
[45:00] gives each one has a certain vantage
[45:03] point of which they portray this and I
[45:05] want you to see each part of it
[45:07] mark 1530 saved thyself and come down
[45:11] from the cross likewise also the chief
[45:13] priests mocking said among themselves
[45:17] with the scribes he saved others himself
[45:20] he cannot save let Christ the King of
[45:24] Israel descend now from the cross that
[45:28] we may see and believe what a statement
[45:33] you know it troubles me about that
[45:35] they're looking right at him in the last
[45:40] few hours of Jesus's life scripture
[45:43] after scripture after Scripture is being
[45:46] fulfilled like watching popcorn pop in a
[45:49] pan seven hundred and some-odd
[45:51] scriptures are being fulfilled they're
[45:53] looking at the word being completely
[45:55] manifested it went right over top of
[45:58] their heads let us see and believe what
[46:02] a what a terrible thing to go to
[46:04] condition to get into and they that were
[46:07] crucified with him reviled him now let's
[46:12] go to Luke 23 verse 33 and I want to
[46:17] kind of close the opening part of this
[46:20] reading with this particular chapter
[46:22] because here's where brother Brennan
[46:23] draws his subject for there they
[46:25] crucified him and this is this is on
[46:27] purpose here to pull this in Luke 23
[46:31] verse 33 when they were come to the
[46:33] place which is called
[46:35] Calvary there they crucified him they're
[46:45] the most holy city
[46:47] they the most holy people crucified the
[46:53] most terrible punishment any man could
[46:54] ever be put through him the prince of
[46:57] life there they crucified him not the
[47:02] drunks not the mongers not the
[47:04] liars message people praise the Lord
[47:10] somebody message people that's the ones
[47:15] that crucified shame in shame but it's
[47:19] happening again it's happening in the
[47:22] day we're living it message people once
[47:23] again are looking right at the word and
[47:25] they're crucifying the effect of it they
[47:27] really don't realize that when they're
[47:29] against Pentecost against the moving of
[47:31] the Spirit and on and on and on they're
[47:33] actually doing the very same thing to
[47:34] Jesus that these people done 2,000 years
[47:37] ago
[47:42] that's right let's pray together Lord
[47:47] Jesus what could we say about such a
[47:49] text Lord the very depth of it almost
[47:53] baffles are mine but Lord we're looking
[47:57] to you denied to come and make this
[48:00] plain for us help us to see and
[48:02] recognize that which you would want to
[48:04] speak to our hearts tonight I pray Lord
[48:07] that you had just moved me out of the
[48:09] way Lord that I might be a vessel used
[48:11] Lord and that you would come and speak
[48:14] through my lips and that you would
[48:16] manifest your great word right here
[48:18] amongst the people god this little group
[48:20] gathered up in here Lord to hear the
[48:22] word of the Lord may you just open their
[48:24] hearts that they might receive all that
[48:26] you'd have for him open their eyes that
[48:28] they can see that which is necessary to
[48:30] see is God we are hungry and desires to
[48:33] hear you speak to us we pray you take
[48:35] your word now Lord and may you break it
[48:37] to us manifest it to us may you anoint
[48:41] us Lord that we might be recipients of
[48:43] all that you would say now as we look
[48:45] into the Word of God for this last day
[48:48] Lord of where we're living in the name
[48:50] of Jesus Christ amen and amen god bless
[48:54] you you may be seated
[48:58] what a picture surely these people most
[49:03] likely didn't really recognize the depth
[49:06] or the the type of anointing that was
[49:11] falling upon them here they are with the
[49:14] Bible as we would say in their hand they
[49:17] have the ability to read the same
[49:18] prophets quotes they have the ability to
[49:21] read the same statements to hear the
[49:23] same type of preachers preaching and yet
[49:26] when the word is manifested before them
[49:29] of what they've been preaching about and
[49:31] reading about they were so blind they
[49:34] couldn't really see what it was hanging
[49:35] in front of them you know it goes to
[49:38] prove to us that unless God opens up
[49:41] your eyes there's no way that you can
[49:43] see it even if it's right in front of
[49:45] your face that's why I say to people
[49:47] many times if you can see what God is
[49:50] doing in the last day if you can see
[49:52] what the Holy Spirit is doing in this
[49:54] great hour you ought to be the happiest
[49:56] person that ever walks shoe-leather
[49:58] because there'll be millions upon
[50:00] billions of people trillions even that
[50:02] will never be able to comprehend nor
[50:05] recognize the word as it's been
[50:08] fulfilled in the day they're living in
[50:09] they'll make excuses for this and make
[50:12] excuses for that and oh you know I I
[50:14] believe the message and they'll have all
[50:16] of that but yet blind blind cannot see
[50:20] what it is that Christ wants to do with
[50:22] the elect of God with the Bride of God
[50:24] with the people of God and no doubt
[50:26] there'll be people that will be quoting
[50:28] quotes plumb up to the rapture and be
[50:31] recognizing certain scriptures all the
[50:34] way up to the rapture there'll be part
[50:36] of church services as we would say all
[50:38] the way up to the time the bride is
[50:40] taken out of here but yet blind still
[50:43] cannot see the full effect of what God
[50:46] has done for the people in the last day
[50:48] now to take these scriptures and to
[50:51] weave them together I I want to start at
[50:55] the initial foundation of what it is we
[50:58] believe in Christianity which is the
[51:01] cross of Calvary and I want to take this
[51:03] cross this old rugged cross and I want
[51:06] to talk about it for a little while but
[51:07] then I want to preach a little bit later
[51:09] about your cross because it was
[51:11] Jesus that has a cross alone but it's
[51:14] you and I that has a cross as well and
[51:16] we'll find in a little while that Jesus
[51:19] identified that we must pick up our
[51:22] cross and follow after him so the the
[51:26] part of Calvary that I believe has truly
[51:29] been ignored and the days we're living
[51:31] in in the the suffering of the Lord
[51:34] Jesus and the purpose of Calvary and
[51:37] what Calvary is to you and I has been so
[51:40] downplayed that if a man preaches on
[51:42] Calvary well he's not even touching the
[51:44] revelation of the hour but I Got News
[51:45] for you unless we preach the cross in
[51:49] conjunction with the opening of the word
[51:51] and all these other great revelations
[51:53] you'll never get a person in the rapture
[51:55] if you preach the cross alone that'll
[51:58] never get them ready to go out of here
[51:59] if you preach Revelation alone without
[52:02] the cross that'll never get them out of
[52:04] here you must marry both of them
[52:06] together in order to get the full
[52:08] revelation are you with me to be able to
[52:11] take the bride of Jesus Christ out of
[52:12] here and what you'll find is that there
[52:15] are many people around the ranks of this
[52:16] message that are following Jesus but
[52:19] they're doing so without a cross on
[52:21] their back and there's no way that you
[52:24] can truly follow him unless you're
[52:26] willing to go to the cross yourself now
[52:29] let me just read you a couple of things
[52:31] here just to kind of get a start here on
[52:33] on this about crucifixion some things
[52:36] that you may not have known about
[52:37] crucifixion but it is actually something
[52:40] that goes on even to this day in other
[52:43] parts of Asia there was just a case with
[52:46] the Isis group not long ago some young
[52:49] men and women had refused to deny
[52:51] Christianity and as a result they
[52:53] crucified these young people and left
[52:56] their bodies out to be destroyed by the
[52:59] Sun and by animals and what more just
[53:01] left them hanging out so crucifixion is
[53:04] actually a process that goes on even to
[53:07] this day and really there's never been a
[53:10] death that has been as gruesome or as
[53:13] brutal or as painful as crucifixion a
[53:17] lot of the reason why that it was such
[53:19] an intense thing is because that often
[53:22] the person that was being crucified will
[53:25] left there for days upon him and they
[53:28] learned how to work the the prisoner as
[53:31] they was hanging on the cross where they
[53:33] would feed them just enough give them
[53:35] just enough food in water so that they
[53:38] would go on living just from even more
[53:39] days beyond what they would have expired
[53:41] and the purpose of it was was not just a
[53:44] torture the victim or the person that
[53:47] was being crucified the thief or the
[53:48] criminal ever what it was but the deeper
[53:51] reason was because the government wanted
[53:54] to flex their muscle to the eyes of the
[53:56] people and let them know you cross us
[53:59] we're gonna cross you if you get my
[54:01] meaning
[54:02] they meant to show forth a message now
[54:05] Jesus himself was acquainted with the
[54:08] imagery of the cross when he walked here
[54:11] upon the earth because many times
[54:12] walking into a city or even at different
[54:15] spots around the city history records
[54:18] that there would be crucifixions
[54:19] actually going on all around the place
[54:21] they didn't always take them all the way
[54:23] up to Golgotha every time but many times
[54:25] entering into the city that would be
[54:28] maybe one or two or three outside the
[54:30] city hanging there crucified sometimes
[54:32] dead sometimes tied to the cross and
[54:35] still living and they would use this as
[54:37] a method to send a message to the rest
[54:40] of the people we will not deal with
[54:42] kindly with people that are against
[54:45] government or anti-government we will
[54:47] not deal with anybody that reproaches
[54:49] the king or that stands against our way
[54:51] of doing things so the imagery of the
[54:54] cross was their way of sending the
[54:57] message that we will not tolerate your
[55:00] disrespect or your disloyalty and yet
[55:03] here Almighty God takes this very same
[55:05] image that the government used as a
[55:08] symbol of their disrespect or so forth
[55:11] to the people for disrespecting them and
[55:13] Jesus hanging on the cross it becomes a
[55:15] symbol to every devil out of hell you
[55:18] break the word you defy the word right
[55:21] here's where you were defeated if on
[55:22] this cross right here it's a wonderful
[55:25] imagery when you look at the depth of it
[55:26] of what it is and then you realize of
[55:29] course that the the victim is that hung
[55:31] upon the cross often they would either
[55:34] beat
[55:35] tied to the cross or they would be
[55:37] nailed to the cross many times in the
[55:38] form of an X or in the form of a T and
[55:40] they would take a post and stick it into
[55:43] the ground
[55:43] oftentimes this to 300-pound posts would
[55:45] be sunken to the ground and then the
[55:47] hundred-pound crossbeam would be
[55:49] attached to the back of the person as
[55:51] they would walk up what we would call
[55:53] Via della Rossa the pathway to Calvary
[55:56] and they would take this cross this
[55:58] cross beam and strap it to the back of
[56:00] the criminal or the prisoner and they
[56:03] would have to walk himself now see this
[56:05] was also a part of the humiliation it
[56:07] was also a part of sending a message to
[56:10] others you mess with us we're gonna get
[56:13] you now remember this was capital
[56:15] punishment under this time period so it
[56:18] would be the same as you and I walking
[56:20] in sitting down in a little room
[56:22] watching somebody being strapped to a
[56:24] gurney and lethally injected or walked
[56:27] over to another place sat in the
[56:28] electric chair
[56:29] somebody throw the switch and burn up in
[56:31] the electric chair it was capital
[56:33] punishment now could you imagine the way
[56:36] that this must have looked to the
[56:37] disciples that followed the Lord Jesus
[56:39] and here we are brother Samson we're
[56:41] sitting inside of a room and they tied
[56:43] they tied Jesus into the electric chair
[56:45] throw the switch
[56:46] one punches the other hey that's my
[56:48] Messiah in there that looks strange but
[56:52] yet to the eyes of the public that's
[56:54] exactly what it looked like when Jesus
[56:56] was being crucified he was being
[56:58] crucified under capital punishment this
[57:01] did not happen to innocent men this did
[57:04] not happen to those that was just given
[57:06] a you know well you're just you know we
[57:09] just we just don't like you if they they
[57:11] had to absolutely commit a vicious crime
[57:15] and be taking so taken so seriously that
[57:19] when Rome would go to crucify this
[57:22] individual they was using that as I said
[57:24] to send a message this is a serious
[57:26] person this person right here is
[57:29] somebody not to be reckoned with can I
[57:31] tell you something that's what the cross
[57:33] still represents when you see Jesus hang
[57:36] in there it is a force that the devil
[57:38] should never reckon with it is a symbol
[57:40] of the bride
[57:41] excellence and power and glory because
[57:45] before the beacon can come a
[57:46] resurrection before there can come a
[57:48] defeat of Hell there must be the cross
[57:51] first must be the cross first they would
[57:57] display these victims as a warning to
[58:00] those that would attempt descent you
[58:03] don't like this government you don't
[58:04] like the way we run things this is what
[58:06] happens to people like you you know like
[58:08] what King says this is what happens to
[58:11] people like you you don't like the way
[58:13] we tax it like the way we do well let us
[58:15] show you how we handle business like
[58:18] that it's the same old devil when people
[58:20] try to make examples out of folks that
[58:22] break the law and man and they try to
[58:24] give them harsher punishments and what
[58:26] maybe they're worthy of doing what
[58:28] setting an example somebody break a
[58:30] small law and so they'll they'll put 20
[58:33] extra years on him in prison when they
[58:35] could have given five months to do what
[58:38] send a message and Rome wanted to send
[58:42] the message anybody that comes against
[58:44] our government we're gonna take him out
[58:47] all the while playing right into the
[58:49] hands of Almighty God because out of all
[58:52] the ways that God chose for Jesus to die
[58:54] it was the cross that he chose to
[58:56] manifest the death of the Lord Jesus
[58:59] Christ if we think of it in modern terms
[59:02] he could have died in a chariot race he
[59:03] could have been robbed by a thief and
[59:05] stabbed he could have been shot with a
[59:06] gun or ever what it maybe could have
[59:08] been bludgeon by something he could have
[59:10] died anyway but he took the cross as an
[59:13] example for how Christ was going to be
[59:16] lifted up between heavens and earth as a
[59:18] symbol the most horrible punishment that
[59:22] a man could ever endure and remember
[59:24] this is not this kind of scene that Mel
[59:26] Gibson painted in his in his Passion of
[59:29] the Christ brother BAM said that you can
[59:31] in the movie if you've ever seen the
[59:33] film you can still recognize Jesus some
[59:35] but brother Brendan said when they put
[59:37] Jesus on the cross they had beat him
[59:39] beyond recognition
[59:40] you couldn't even recognize him anymore
[59:42] he looked like a piece of meat hang in
[59:44] there not a man he knew that the Bible
[59:47] said that his bones would stare at him
[59:50] and they did so whenever they took that
[59:52] cat of nine tails that often did dip it
[59:54] in some kind of sticky type substance
[59:56] and run it through glass and what more
[59:58] and as they would take that kind of nine
[1:00:00] tails and whip it on the back it would
[1:00:02] grab ahold of flesh and rip strips of
[1:00:04] meat off the back of the person and here
[1:00:07] Jesus going to Calvary with his ribs
[1:00:08] showing through well they'd rip the meat
[1:00:11] right off of his body this isn't just a
[1:00:13] Hollywood film with a little trickle of
[1:00:15] blood going down his face he was taking
[1:00:18] the cross which was one of the most
[1:00:21] horrible things a man could endure
[1:00:23] freeze God
[1:00:25] now you notice the victims were left on
[1:00:28] display as a warning to others as want
[1:00:32] you to catch this crucifixion was
[1:00:35] usually intended to provide a death that
[1:00:39] was particularly slow and painful
[1:00:43] whatever means that was necessary and
[1:00:47] expedient to that goal that's what they
[1:00:50] studied that's what they learned how to
[1:00:53] do and they became master perfectionist
[1:00:56] at holding a man at death for days and
[1:01:00] not letting him die you remember when
[1:01:03] they went to give Jesus to stop a lot of
[1:01:05] times we look at that as that was a
[1:01:07] merciful action it was not when they
[1:01:09] went to give him the salt the purpose of
[1:01:11] that was keep him hydrated long enough
[1:01:13] he'll hang on a few more hours well
[1:01:16] Jesus refused it it was just as just a
[1:01:19] furtherance of the hastening of the
[1:01:21] death of the Lord Jesus they wanted to
[1:01:24] hold that man there to make him suffer
[1:01:26] not because they care about what the man
[1:01:28] was or what he did they wanted to send a
[1:01:30] message to other people we are the great
[1:01:33] Roman government and you do not cross us
[1:01:37] we'll show you exactly what we're made
[1:01:39] of why would Jesus have chose such a
[1:01:43] place this place called Calvary Adam
[1:01:46] every place that God could have chose
[1:01:48] for the Lord Jesus why would he have
[1:01:50] made such a decision for Jesus to do to
[1:01:53] go to this place why couldn't he just
[1:01:55] get a disease and go off into the corner
[1:01:57] and die and then somebody just tell us
[1:01:59] he died for us because there was a
[1:02:01] purpose behind the cross
[1:02:03] that he could not avoid he had fulfilled
[1:02:05] everything in life that God had designed
[1:02:09] for him to fulfill remember brother mem
[1:02:12] said God cannot take you off this planet
[1:02:14] until your purpose in life is done and
[1:02:16] everything that the Lord Jesus needed to
[1:02:20] complete was over his next step in
[1:02:24] following the will of God was the cross
[1:02:28] his next step what's the cross what good
[1:02:34] would have done him to have great
[1:02:35] miracles signs and wonders raised the
[1:02:37] dead we shout glory to God Jesus never
[1:02:41] preached a funeral but if he would have
[1:02:43] refused to move to the cross all of that
[1:02:46] would have been absolutely void and
[1:02:47] pointless because he had to be so
[1:02:51] obedient to the will of God that when he
[1:02:54] laid the cup of the winepress of the
[1:02:57] wrath before the Lord Jesus he had to
[1:03:01] say father if it be thy will let this
[1:03:03] cup pass from me but nevertheless not my
[1:03:06] will but thine be done
[1:03:09] so you see the purpose behind the cross
[1:03:12] now I just want to take this slow just
[1:03:14] so you get some of these points the
[1:03:16] purpose behind the cross to Rome wants
[1:03:20] to put a man on display just so forth
[1:03:24] their great power and God used
[1:03:28] governmental action to show forth his
[1:03:31] own power I hope you're listening to him
[1:03:33] because brother BAM said down in the
[1:03:34] last day that there would be a boycott
[1:03:36] against the bride
[1:03:38] you heard the brothers say just a few
[1:03:40] moments ago their governmental power
[1:03:41] would squeeze against the elect of God
[1:03:44] they would try to stop them from
[1:03:46] preaching stop them from praying for the
[1:03:47] sick stop them for this stop them from
[1:03:49] that but in the hand of governmental
[1:03:51] power that's when the bride will shine
[1:03:54] forth and that's when the third pole
[1:03:56] will come to its fullness and you'll see
[1:03:58] what that has been temporarily
[1:03:59] manifested manifested in his fullness
[1:04:03] because anytime satan goes to squeeze
[1:04:06] his big fat fingers around the neck of
[1:04:07] the bride it's like trying to hold on to
[1:04:09] a bar soap in the shower hey it just
[1:04:13] slips right on out come on somebody you
[1:04:15] can't hold on to the elect of God she's
[1:04:17] got an exit strategy hey she's got away
[1:04:21] [Applause]
[1:04:24] Satan new looking at Jesus if this man
[1:04:29] is who he says he is and we're about to
[1:04:32] see something really great here so the
[1:04:36] devil and Devils moved on the chief
[1:04:38] priests hey come off the cross and will
[1:04:42] believe you say you who you are see the
[1:04:44] devil knew that everything that was
[1:04:46] prophesied of the Messiah he could see
[1:04:48] the type see Jesus could see the shadows
[1:04:50] he could see everything lining up in
[1:04:52] conjunction with what was supposed to
[1:04:54] happen and if this was truly the Lamb of
[1:04:57] God is John the Baptist said the devil
[1:04:59] heard it he knew what was being said
[1:05:01] about Jesus he knew exactly what was
[1:05:03] being prophesied of him and he knew if
[1:05:05] that man was who he said he was he was
[1:05:08] in some real trouble
[1:05:09] so his last-ditch effort to try to
[1:05:13] torment our Lord God was to come down
[1:05:17] and move on these people if you be who
[1:05:19] you say you are
[1:05:20] the crowd will see and will believe you
[1:05:25] know that's something about the Lord
[1:05:26] Jesus is something about real Christians
[1:05:28] too when you learn to turn off all of
[1:05:30] the naysayers and turn off all of the
[1:05:32] gossip and turn off all of the critics
[1:05:34] and turn off all that stuff once you get
[1:05:36] your eyes single that you're following
[1:05:37] the will of God you don't matter what
[1:05:39] anybody else says I do only that which
[1:05:41] pleases my father
[1:05:43] Amen that's what he had on his mind
[1:05:45] that's what he had in his heart no
[1:05:47] matter what they said he was gonna stay
[1:05:49] with the will of God we know the Holy
[1:05:53] Spirit left Jesus in the Garden of
[1:05:55] Gethsemane we know that he went to
[1:05:57] Calvary died as a man yet at the same
[1:06:00] time it's very man that the Holy Spirit
[1:06:03] had moved off of again seventies
[1:06:05] remember he's becoming a sinner for our
[1:06:07] sake as they walked up to Calvary not as
[1:06:10] a savior not as a saint but as a sinner
[1:06:14] and dying as a sinner he becomes our
[1:06:16] Savior dying as a sinner he becomes a
[1:06:19] saint of the Most High but he had such a
[1:06:25] character about him that when Peter got
[1:06:26] mad and cut off mouthpieces ear he was
[1:06:29] able to attach it and you know what you
[1:06:31] couldn't even find a sword mark when he
[1:06:32] got done with it you know that tells me
[1:06:35] God believes in perfect justification
[1:06:37] when you mess up he can put the ear back
[1:06:39] on and not nobody can find the mark come
[1:06:43] on somebody that's why God forgive you
[1:06:45] and I that's the way he forgives me he
[1:06:47] forgive me so much that it's not even
[1:06:49] held against me it's as though I never
[1:06:51] done it same man on the cross of Calvary
[1:06:55] father forgettable what was it his
[1:06:58] character of who he really was it held
[1:07:02] no matter what was going on around him
[1:07:04] the cross of Calvary this place called
[1:07:09] Calvary now to look at this for just a
[1:07:12] moment in the way that Jesus was
[1:07:16] crucified on Calvary we understand as
[1:07:20] the Bible said he yielded up the ghost
[1:07:22] now this word and I might have shared
[1:07:24] this with you last year allowed me to do
[1:07:25] so again the word yielded that he used
[1:07:28] us there as though a general would be
[1:07:30] dismissing his troops and the Bible said
[1:07:33] that Jesus yielded up the ghost or
[1:07:36] yielded up himself when he died so not
[1:07:40] even death itself could call the shots
[1:07:43] on when Jesus would take his last breath
[1:07:45] he was all the way in charged to the
[1:07:48] very end when he dismissed his spirit
[1:07:50] and said it is finished hallelujah to
[1:07:54] show why he is not only the conquer but
[1:07:56] he's in control of every circumstance
[1:07:59] oh I hope somebody's hearing me tonight
[1:08:02] he is not only in control of every
[1:08:04] situation but he is the God that
[1:08:06] controls life he's the God that controls
[1:08:09] death he's the God that controls
[1:08:11] circumstance there
[1:08:12] nothing that gets without the reach of
[1:08:15] his great fans oh I hope we realize that
[1:08:18] one's sickness is coursing through our
[1:08:20] body and troubles are passing through
[1:08:22] our home and problems are arising at
[1:08:24] work and whatever more I hope when we
[1:08:27] look at the cross that emblem of grace
[1:08:29] and mercy that Jesus was showing and
[1:08:33] testifying I am in control of everything
[1:08:37] [Applause]
[1:08:40] the devil tried to get him to lose
[1:08:42] control let the Christ the King of
[1:08:46] Israel they didn't believe that dirty
[1:08:49] hypocrites had no no no right to use his
[1:08:51] name in such a manner they didn't had no
[1:08:55] right didn't love him they didn't have
[1:08:57] no mercy for him they had no right to
[1:08:59] use his holy name in such a scoffing
[1:09:01] manner that Christ that the king of
[1:09:04] Israel let him come off the cross if
[1:09:08] Jesus could have told him he'd like to
[1:09:10] probably look back at him and said I
[1:09:12] coming off this cross y'all ain't got
[1:09:14] enough money for me there's not enough
[1:09:18] that you could offer me to come off of
[1:09:21] this because I am here bound by the will
[1:09:24] of God by what the word said I'm
[1:09:26] supposed to do because I've got some
[1:09:28] sick children down the road that body
[1:09:31] strikes from my body they will be healed
[1:09:33] by the right hand down on the throne of
[1:09:51] my father and you'll sit down in the
[1:09:52] throne with me what kind of message can
[1:09:57] we learn from the cross this is what we
[1:09:59] can learn that when you think it could
[1:10:02] get worse and it's about as bad as it's
[1:10:05] ever going to get and you think man it's
[1:10:07] only going to get worse from here just
[1:10:09] remember if you're being obedient to the
[1:10:10] will of God in your life what looks like
[1:10:13] it's only getting worse and worse and
[1:10:14] worse means it's something really great
[1:10:16] great greats coming down the road
[1:10:18] somewhere
[1:10:19] praise be to God that's the reason why
[1:10:23] you must understand that out of death
[1:10:25] life is birthed out of death
[1:10:28] remember won the fair one that when the
[1:10:30] Greeks came to Jesus and they said sighs
[1:10:32] we would see Jesus he said except the
[1:10:33] corner wheat died
[1:10:35] there'll be no life it took death to
[1:10:40] bring forth life I listen to me if you
[1:10:44] want eternal life it only comes through
[1:10:47] death you cannot hang your Christianity
[1:10:52] up in a closet and pull it down on
[1:10:54] Sundays and Wednesdays and expect to
[1:10:57] make the rapture if it took a cross for
[1:11:00] Jesus it's gonna take cross for us hi
[1:11:05] let's look at this for a little bit
[1:11:06] Matthew chapter 10 verse 38 now let's
[1:11:10] look now at the words of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:12] now here's what's amazing to me is that
[1:11:14] in this particular chapter whenever he
[1:11:16] comes to this this is about six chapters
[1:11:20] preceding Matthew 16 where Jesus gives
[1:11:23] the keys of the kingdom to Peter okay
[1:11:25] once Jesus makes this remark out of all
[1:11:29] the things he could have said it makes
[1:11:32] you wonder why did he point to the cross
[1:11:34] I mean it's it's a simple thing why
[1:11:37] didn't you say if you want to follow
[1:11:38] after me such-and-such me anything but
[1:11:42] the cross but Jesus points to the cross
[1:11:46] what a strange thing it's almost like
[1:11:50] you kind of knew he was gonna have to go
[1:11:51] that way somehow Matthew chapter 10
[1:11:55] verse 38 because I'll show you what the
[1:11:57] cross represents in just a moment but
[1:11:59] I'm kind of giving you a cliffhanger on
[1:12:01] purpose I want you to think if I give
[1:12:03] you the answer now you shut down time to
[1:12:04] go home and we're we gonna eat all that
[1:12:07] Matthew 10 verse 38 and he that taketh
[1:12:10] not his cross and followeth after me is
[1:12:17] not worthy of me how men wants to follow
[1:12:20] Jesus for an
[1:12:23] takes across takes across without the
[1:12:28] cross you cannot be his follower because
[1:12:32] it only comes through the cross that you
[1:12:35] could become a true disciple of his who
[1:12:39] you always shouting now you don't know
[1:12:41] what to say do you right you see how
[1:12:43] what it does to us this is why the
[1:12:45] people of this message I fear that many
[1:12:48] of the preachers coming on they're too
[1:12:49] positive about things or the bride and
[1:12:52] Friends people don't even halfway
[1:12:54] understand what these real message
[1:12:56] terminologies mean they haul our bride
[1:12:59] the holler elected they holler all that
[1:13:00] and a half the people in messes don't
[1:13:01] even know what you're talking about yet
[1:13:04] they want to move into deep things move
[1:13:06] into supernatural things move into
[1:13:08] spiritual things but listen to me very
[1:13:11] carefully it's gonna take a cross to get
[1:13:15] us right with God before we can ever
[1:13:17] move forward into anything spiritual
[1:13:19] it's gonna take this old rugged cross
[1:13:21] right here in our life if we try to
[1:13:24] bypass this we try to skip past this
[1:13:27] part and move on to the blessings it'll
[1:13:29] never work it'll never work now I know
[1:13:32] you're not stupid but two plus two is
[1:13:34] still four you got to have two before
[1:13:36] you get to two hit for that right you
[1:13:39] gotta do the first thing before you can
[1:13:41] do the second thing you cannot move on
[1:13:43] to conquering devils and conquer inhale
[1:13:44] and raise him on the throne all of that
[1:13:47] comes through the cross makes me wonder
[1:13:51] friends how many people in this message
[1:13:53] are following the message without a
[1:13:55] cross on their back notice this the
[1:14:04] guiltiest of criminals the basest slave
[1:14:07] robbers and authors of insurrections
[1:14:11] would often be placed upon the the cross
[1:14:15] of punishment borrowed by the Greeks and
[1:14:18] the Romans from the Phoenicians the
[1:14:20] Romans have fixed down to the time of
[1:14:22] Constantine the Great the punished even
[1:14:25] Roman citizens by this way of the cross
[1:14:30] nobody was exempt the cross holds of
[1:14:35] meaning
[1:14:36] to whosoever will on the negative side
[1:14:41] they all could be criminals liars
[1:14:43] thieves or they could be peaceable men
[1:14:44] that maybe roam just sought out to make
[1:14:46] an example of nobody was exempt from the
[1:14:52] cross let me tell you preacher deacon
[1:14:56] trusty housewife farmer factory worker
[1:14:58] painter nobody is exempt from this cross
[1:15:01] I'm preaching about right here today
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:05] nobody is exempt from their own personal
[1:15:09] Calvary you must have it you must have
[1:15:14] it to get resurrection life you must
[1:15:16] have this who you say but brother Ben
[1:15:19] I'm already saved I'm already born again
[1:15:21] great you still need a cross you still
[1:15:24] need the cross in your life mmm that's
[1:15:28] right
[1:15:28] what's your Matthew chapter 16 now now
[1:15:30] what this is after Jesus gives Peter the
[1:15:33] keys to the kingdom they brother left
[1:15:37] said a moment ago the Omega well we read
[1:15:39] the Alpha now let's read the Omega of
[1:15:41] this Matthew 16:24 then jesus said
[1:15:45] unders disciples If any man will come
[1:15:47] after me ah here we go let him deny
[1:15:51] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:16:00] me
[1:16:01] so the cross a man will take up is a
[1:16:05] cross of self-denial it's easy when
[1:16:12] somebody builds the faith to deny the
[1:16:14] devil it's easy when you build up the
[1:16:16] right kind of faith to deny critics and
[1:16:18] gossipers and everything else but how
[1:16:21] does a man deny himself how do you deny
[1:16:27] who you are don't y'all look at me like
[1:16:31] a bunch of serums and angels and holy
[1:16:33] people you know what I mean to you we
[1:16:37] have this idea in our brain that if I
[1:16:39] just overcome the devil I've overcome it
[1:16:41] all you're only getting started bub
[1:16:43] that's once you overcome the devil the
[1:16:46] biggest of all the overcoming these
[1:16:47] come that's the overcoming of your own
[1:16:49] self see if it greater-than overcoming
[1:16:52] the devil remember the prophet of God
[1:16:54] said this room could be full of Devils
[1:16:55] I'll just paraphrase
[1:16:56] he said this room could be full of
[1:16:58] spirits and not one thing would affect
[1:17:00] you until you allow it to affect you do
[1:17:03] you yield yourself and listen to me the
[1:17:05] end Matthias will read it in a moment
[1:17:06] the enmity in the Garden of Eden wasn't
[1:17:09] even so much the devil as much as it was
[1:17:11] Eve Satan might have pounded away at her
[1:17:16] day after day but it wasn't until Eve
[1:17:19] brother Ben said lusted after a PhD and
[1:17:22] opened up her mind to hear what the
[1:17:24] devil had to say that's what caused the
[1:17:26] great enmity because Satan was the devil
[1:17:30] was the devil was the devil all the way
[1:17:32] back and there's no telling how many
[1:17:33] hundreds of years might have passed that
[1:17:35] Satan wants that woman and she was
[1:17:36] veiled behind the Word of God but what
[1:17:39] caused the enmity not the devil human
[1:17:42] will caused the enmity and human will
[1:17:47] still causes the enmity go see somebody
[1:17:50] separate themselves from God watch them
[1:17:52] prefer their self over the word and it
[1:17:55] automatically separates them from
[1:17:57] anything spiritual ooh y'all are hanging
[1:18:02] in there pretty good you're doing better
[1:18:03] my folks did Wednesday night that's for
[1:18:05] sure I thought some of them was gonna
[1:18:08] pass that on me for sure now watch this
[1:18:11] Jesus now say let him deny himself and
[1:18:14] take up his cross and follow me he tells
[1:18:17] them to Matthew 10 take up the cross he
[1:18:19] gives Peter the keys to the kingdom
[1:18:21] shortly before he goes back and says
[1:18:23] Alpha and Omega take up your cross can
[1:18:30] you imagine how this must have looked
[1:18:32] when Peters by the fire and Jesus as we
[1:18:36] would think of it as being strapped into
[1:18:37] the electric chair aren't you one of
[1:18:40] them oh I'm a boy he didn't want to end
[1:18:44] up on a cross next to him as they found
[1:18:47] out even walking with Jesus he might
[1:18:49] have been next he's a coward won't even
[1:18:52] stand there that fire burned that woman
[1:18:54] looking ahead and say you're one of them
[1:18:56] I can tell by the way you talk
[1:18:57] every time you talk you're talking about
[1:18:59] mysteries and seals and thunders and
[1:19:01] revelations a lot of them Charles said
[1:19:06] woman I am NOT and in one place the
[1:19:10] Bible said after he says the third time
[1:19:12] the crowed Jesus was standing in a
[1:19:14] place that he could turn and look at
[1:19:15] Peter as if to say I told you so you
[1:19:21] think you're strong you think you've got
[1:19:23] power but don't you understand the cross
[1:19:26] proves one lesson that once a person
[1:19:30] denies themself they're not only denying
[1:19:33] their ability for salvation to save
[1:19:36] themselves but they're also denying that
[1:19:40] ability to be strong to be the leader to
[1:19:44] be powerful to be smart to be savvy to
[1:19:53] be the lead guy or lead gal they're
[1:19:57] tacking all of that to across as you see
[1:20:00] when friends people get on the cross
[1:20:01] right they don't have the pride like you
[1:20:03] see swelling in some people around this
[1:20:05] message they don't if they're really
[1:20:08] attacked to this cross right here they
[1:20:09] are dying a humiliating death and let me
[1:20:13] tell you it is humiliation for a man a
[1:20:15] woman to have to ignore what they think
[1:20:17] about a matter and take the word
[1:20:18] sometimes over what they even think
[1:20:20] themselves because a smart man might
[1:20:23] look and say it doesn't make sense
[1:20:25] a whale swallowing up Jonah well then
[1:20:27] well don't have a big enough thought for
[1:20:29] it but if the man is willing to put
[1:20:31] himself on a cross he'll go back in the
[1:20:33] world we'll say it was a prepared fish
[1:20:34] not a whale he had a throat that he
[1:20:36] could swallow that profit on it or not
[1:20:38] the word would be the predominant thing
[1:20:40] but if a man's not on the cross he'll
[1:20:43] put up a website he'll put up proof
[1:20:45] you'll put up evidence that's a man not
[1:20:51] on the cross close friend of mine just a
[1:20:55] few weeks ago I was actually surprised
[1:20:58] in a way but another way I was I told my
[1:21:02] wife a year ago so wouldn't surprise me
[1:21:03] a bit if this boy actually walked off
[1:21:05] matter fact Barry's gonna be there
[1:21:07] either this week in her next weekend
[1:21:09] gonna try to help the church
[1:21:11] this man walks to the platform and says
[1:21:13] I'm done with the message I was reading
[1:21:16] a Jehovah Witness book and found out
[1:21:18] that some of the things they got there's
[1:21:19] some things that brother Branham
[1:21:20] preached and on and on and so this man
[1:21:23] Jehovah Witness who's an utter fanatic
[1:21:25] he had the message and that's where
[1:21:26] brother Branham got well I thought what
[1:21:27] a bunch of nonsense and hogwash I have
[1:21:32] no doubt that brother Ben didn't study
[1:21:33] after many learning men I have no doubt
[1:21:36] he was an angel of God tying loose ends
[1:21:38] together I have no doubt that he talked
[1:21:41] about Larkin and Charles taze Russell
[1:21:42] and and and Whitfield and all these I
[1:21:44] have no doubt that he studied after many
[1:21:47] of those men but at the end of the day
[1:21:48] it was God's revelation that he placed
[1:21:51] before the people not Charles taze
[1:21:53] Russell or Luther or any the rest of
[1:21:55] them but a man that is tied to the cross
[1:22:00] he's willing to lay aside what he thinks
[1:22:03] no matter how good it looks no matter
[1:22:05] how much proof may be laying before him
[1:22:07] listen to me friends you think this
[1:22:09] thing is over about people getting
[1:22:11] discouraged and leaving the message
[1:22:12] we've only really begin to see the the
[1:22:14] brunt of it coming on now it'll get
[1:22:17] worse because the situation is going to
[1:22:18] going to get harder sir church situation
[1:22:20] Church circumstances are going to get
[1:22:22] tougher and tougher and tougher it's
[1:22:24] going to be fewer places you can go and
[1:22:26] have confidence in fewer preachers you
[1:22:28] can have confidence in on and on and on
[1:22:31] and on but listen to me it is he that is
[1:22:33] tacked to this old rugged cross that
[1:22:36] will endure no matter what's going on
[1:22:38] around him or what everybody might say
[1:22:40] if they're attacked to this cost then
[1:22:42] stay with the will of God and ignore
[1:22:44] everything everybody else has said not
[1:22:47] my will but thine be done oh Lord
[1:22:49] [Applause]
[1:22:49] [Music]
[1:22:52] people that aren't on this cross
[1:22:55] something in the world is going to get
[1:22:57] them something in theology is going to
[1:23:00] get them something and their family is
[1:23:02] going to get them but if they're
[1:23:05] attacked to this cross everything they
[1:23:06] are is being crucified and yielded no
[1:23:10] matter if you're a PhD or a or an OD
[1:23:18] that's a matter of you the smartest guy
[1:23:20] or the dumbest guy when you go to the
[1:23:23] cross it levels the playing field for
[1:23:25] every person hanging there amen that's
[1:23:28] what I love about this crate this crate
[1:23:30] wedding supper we're being made ready
[1:23:32] for now we'll go sit there no doubt the
[1:23:34] chairs will be this high and then this
[1:23:37] high and then this high because as it
[1:23:39] was in history when a king would prepare
[1:23:41] a banquet he would have all of the
[1:23:43] certain guests at certain heights sit at
[1:23:46] certain parts of the chair that way when
[1:23:48] he walked out looked across that great
[1:23:49] table every person was sitting on the
[1:23:52] same field they were setting the level
[1:23:54] and no one above the other no one below
[1:23:56] another and let me tell you that's the
[1:23:58] reason I believe that I've got the same
[1:24:00] Holy Ghost that brother Branham had I've
[1:24:02] got the same Holy Ghost that Paul in
[1:24:04] them had I'm not less sir I'm not least
[1:24:06] I've got the same life in me that was in
[1:24:10] the Lord Jesus Christ himself and then
[1:24:13] can you say the same thing but a man
[1:24:19] tied to this cross here look at things
[1:24:22] differently he'll perceive things
[1:24:24] differently he might actually look at
[1:24:27] somebody and say you might be right
[1:24:29] about that I know that's miraculous
[1:24:32] around the message because everybody
[1:24:33] believes their opinions the absolute but
[1:24:37] a man that's tied to this cross he's not
[1:24:40] looking for a way to get a leg up he's
[1:24:44] not looking for an advantage
[1:24:46] he's yielding himself completely that
[1:24:50] Almighty God could take him over and out
[1:24:53] of the brokenness of his life can bring
[1:24:56] forth glory and bring forth power we
[1:25:04] need the cross we need it more now that
[1:25:07] we've ever needed it we preach to our
[1:25:09] young people around the message about
[1:25:11] brother Branham and about the message
[1:25:13] that's true but let's not forget they
[1:25:15] need to get on a cross before they start
[1:25:16] getting in anything deeper I'll show you
[1:25:19] just in just a few very short moments
[1:25:21] how that many people around this message
[1:25:23] if they're not careful they're gonna be
[1:25:24] following the message without a cross on
[1:25:26] their back and it's not going to do them
[1:25:28] any good
[1:25:29] send them to hell as Jesus demanded that
[1:25:33] a man first die die to himself deny
[1:25:35] himself died his thoughts I don't care
[1:25:37] how much they quote the message that
[1:25:39] ain't gonna put him in unless they're
[1:25:41] willing to hang on an old rugged cross
[1:25:42] died to their ideas and be born again by
[1:25:45] the Holy Ghost how do you a man Luke
[1:25:51] chapter 9 verse 23 and he said to them
[1:25:55] all If any man will come after me let
[1:25:59] him deny himself appear to nuuma
[1:26:04] apparent anemia to affirm that one has
[1:26:10] no connection with someone to forget
[1:26:14] oneself lose sight of oneself lose sight
[1:26:17] of one's own interests a pair of the
[1:26:21] meal good lord that's easy to do when it
[1:26:25] comes to the devil behind me Satan but
[1:26:30] to deny my own interest to deny what
[1:26:34] pleases me what makes me happy to deny
[1:26:38] that when the Word says this you say
[1:26:43] that ain't easy course it's not it ain't
[1:26:45] easy to die being on an old rugged cross
[1:26:49] doesn't make it easy for any of us
[1:26:51] praise the Lord it's not supposed to be
[1:26:55] easy it's not supposed to be an easy
[1:26:57] thing it wasn't easy for Jesus to admit
[1:27:00] that he was going to have to give up
[1:27:01] life he didn't want to die but the man
[1:27:04] who said he didn't when he's laying
[1:27:07] there and gets 70 he's thinking about
[1:27:08] his disciples thinking about his friends
[1:27:10] he knows what's landing ahead of him he
[1:27:13] needs he's seen crucifixion before and
[1:27:15] he knows what they're gonna do to him
[1:27:18] when they get ahold of him
[1:27:19] they're gonna make a real example out of
[1:27:22] Jesus he knows that and in his flesh he
[1:27:28] didn't want to die same thing with us
[1:27:33] there's many things that we hold on to
[1:27:36] because they're what interests us but
[1:27:41] are you willing to get on a cross if
[1:27:43] that's what it takes to obtain eternal
[1:27:45] life that's the question I want to know
[1:27:49] about many of the people I preach to are
[1:27:51] we willing to get on a cross because
[1:27:52] remember without the preaching of the
[1:27:54] cross there is no salvation friends if
[1:27:59] we've forgotten these principles that
[1:28:01] I'm preaching to you tonight have we put
[1:28:03] them so far out of our mind because
[1:28:04] we're busy talk about seals and thunders
[1:28:06] and statue of perfect man and on and on
[1:28:08] part of that is void if a man's not
[1:28:11] willing to die and deny himself they go
[1:28:15] get him nowhere ain't go getting nowhere
[1:28:19] Luke 9:23 said to them all If any man
[1:28:21] will come after me let him deny himself
[1:28:23] and take up his cross daily and follow
[1:28:29] me you want to follow Jesus we have to
[1:28:35] daily take up a cross daily we have to
[1:28:38] deny ourselves and deny what we want if
[1:28:42] the word says this way then we go that
[1:28:44] way that's usually the way it operates
[1:28:47] Bible says this we go that direction but
[1:28:50] when a man gets on a cross he said God
[1:28:52] the only direction I want to go is which
[1:28:55] way that words pointing the word says
[1:28:57] this I want to follow right with that
[1:28:59] word I do not not South the way I'll
[1:29:01] follow along with the revelation of God
[1:29:09] hello Riddick God now y'all are kind of
[1:29:11] looking at me like I did Wednesday night
[1:29:15] this is hardening this is tough be
[1:29:18] honest it's tough this is kind of
[1:29:22] preaching when they say with a rubber
[1:29:23] doesn't meet the road cuz you understand
[1:29:26] this is the part of Christianity that
[1:29:28] has so been forgotten around the ranks
[1:29:30] of this message we do you believe God
[1:29:32] sent a prophet yes I believe you believe
[1:29:33] that message yes I'm gonna read to you
[1:29:35] in just a few moments a man that
[1:29:38] followed the message to the letter but
[1:29:41] had no cross on his back and wound up in
[1:29:43] hell because of it mm-hmm
[1:29:47] Luke chapter 14 verse 27 well y'all
[1:29:51] ain't shouting but I didn't expect you
[1:29:53] to but this is good and this is true and
[1:29:57] this is going to help you nonetheless
[1:29:59] right Luke 14 verse 27 and whosoever
[1:30:03] does not bear his cross his cross his
[1:30:08] cross and come after me cannot cannot be
[1:30:16] my disciple you want to be his disciple
[1:30:19] then you got to have a curls without the
[1:30:23] cross there is no discipleship hey
[1:30:26] there's one thing about it they'll never
[1:30:27] be able to deny that true Christianity
[1:30:31] is represented in the ability of one
[1:30:34] person to completely deny self to let
[1:30:38] have it let the Christ have the right
[1:30:40] away you understand friends many times
[1:30:43] when people hold on to opinions I think
[1:30:45] I feel I this I that you're talking to a
[1:30:47] person's never been on the cross if
[1:30:52] they've ever been on the cross right
[1:30:53] whew I got you quite as a Presbyterians
[1:30:56] they ever get on the cross ride it's not
[1:30:58] I think I feel I believe it's the word
[1:31:00] said the Prophet said the message said
[1:31:02] the Bible said Paul said Peter said
[1:31:04] that's a crucified life a crucified life
[1:31:08] in that way does not allow themselves to
[1:31:11] put themselves before the word they
[1:31:16] can't do it I believe it will come to
[1:31:19] pass as I've told you before that people
[1:31:21] will wind up in hell because
[1:31:22] they have become their own absolute what
[1:31:26] they think is the way they think of what
[1:31:28] they believe is what they believe in you
[1:31:29] cannot budge them I don't care how many
[1:31:31] quotes or scriptures you show them that
[1:31:33] person is never been on a cross before
[1:31:36] it's when a person's been on a cross you
[1:31:38] show them the word Amen that's right
[1:31:40] that's the word you show them the
[1:31:42] message
[1:31:43] Amen that's what I believe it that's a
[1:31:46] person on the cross when you hear them
[1:31:49] that's a person not on the cross you've
[1:31:53] never seen anybody crucified saying hey
[1:31:56] they just yield themself Mark chapter 10
[1:32:04] verse 21 now let's look at this message
[1:32:06] boy message man this is a message man
[1:32:12] the rich young ruler this is a message
[1:32:16] person hello praise the Lord
[1:32:24] this is not somebody from the outside a
[1:32:27] Pentecostal and on a Memphis Baptist
[1:32:29] Presbyterian this is a message kid y'all
[1:32:34] look at me funny got something on my
[1:32:35] face well this is who he is he's
[1:32:39] following the message of the hour the
[1:32:41] message of the hour is what Moses
[1:32:43] preached they're following a prophet
[1:32:45] they're following a message they belong
[1:32:48] to a message church they got message
[1:32:50] preachers come on somebody these are
[1:32:55] message people this is a message boy
[1:32:57] right here Jesus said you know the
[1:33:00] commandments Lord I've kept from my
[1:33:06] youth up what wasn't that enough
[1:33:10] following the message following the
[1:33:12] Prophet what not enough well Jesus
[1:33:14] didn't think so
[1:33:15] and this is why read with me when he and
[1:33:20] jesus beholding him loved him and said
[1:33:25] unto him one thing that thou lackest
[1:33:29] go thy way sell whatsoever thou
[1:33:32] to the poor and thou shalt have treasure
[1:33:34] in heaven hold glory to God don't you
[1:33:37] see it was money
[1:33:38] no it wasn't read deeper take up the
[1:33:44] cross and follow me listen close the
[1:33:49] problem was not money the problem was
[1:33:52] the man who was in love with his money
[1:33:56] did you hear me it wasn't the money it
[1:34:00] was the man himself he wasn't willing to
[1:34:03] put denial to himself delay all of that
[1:34:07] aside for the will of God okay you
[1:34:10] understand it may not be money for you
[1:34:12] but something else is laying in there
[1:34:15] just like this man here there's some
[1:34:18] something that the devil knows an old
[1:34:19] kid yourself the devil knows you he
[1:34:22] knows me he studies our life
[1:34:24] he knows what entices us what pleases us
[1:34:26] what makes us happy what he knows and
[1:34:32] all it takes is for the right
[1:34:33] proposition in the right time at the
[1:34:35] right moment when you're the most
[1:34:37] vulnerable and all it takes is one
[1:34:41] little bad decision and now this ain't
[1:34:47] like modern Pentecost once you're saved
[1:34:49] tomorrow you're not sure if he was we
[1:34:52] believe once you got to hold a ghost
[1:34:53] you've always got it but let's be honest
[1:34:56] just as this kid right here was
[1:34:59] following the message without a cross on
[1:35:00] his back so are there thousands around
[1:35:03] the world following this message without
[1:35:05] a cross on their back and they do things
[1:35:11] for God for each laborer
[1:35:13] heal the sick raise the dead cast out
[1:35:16] devils and their following of Jesus they
[1:35:20] follow him all the way up to the white
[1:35:22] throne judgment and that's where I'm
[1:35:24] Matthew chapter 7 Jesus looks down on
[1:35:26] them and they've said we follow the
[1:35:28] message we preach we've labored in your
[1:35:31] name
[1:35:31] and Jesus said turn around for me please
[1:35:37] you have no cross on your back where's
[1:35:41] your cross oh you know what I believe
[1:35:44] the Prophet I didn't ask you that
[1:35:46] I said where's your cross well aura I
[1:35:50] don't have one he said and I don't know
[1:35:52] who you are either depart for me you
[1:35:55] worker of iniquity I never knew you if
[1:36:02] we're Fellowship of the suffering of
[1:36:04] Christ we have to tack our self-denial
[1:36:08] to the cross of Calvary that's the cross
[1:36:12] for you and I today it's being able to
[1:36:16] tack our will our obedience everything
[1:36:19] we are attack into an old rugged cross
[1:36:21] hallelujah to be able to say Lord Jesus
[1:36:25] I'm still too in control of my life so I
[1:36:28] crucify that part of me let me tell you
[1:36:31] many of you sitting here tonight you
[1:36:33] want answers to questions you want
[1:36:34] answers to circumstances you want to
[1:36:36] figure out why you're still too in
[1:36:39] control of yourself that's why that's
[1:36:42] why God is calling us tonight to step
[1:36:44] back and take a look at the old rugged
[1:36:46] cross because right there lies many of
[1:36:49] the answers were looking for it's when a
[1:36:56] person comes back to this place of such
[1:36:58] crucified attitude and crucified life
[1:37:01] then the answers just start multiplying
[1:37:05] the answers to your questions will
[1:37:07] multiply when you start recognizing the
[1:37:10] reason this didn't happen is because you
[1:37:12] were still holding on here and the
[1:37:14] reason this couldn't happen because you
[1:37:15] were standing in the way of God come on
[1:37:19] now yo I know you can say Amen louder
[1:37:22] than this come on help me message kid
[1:37:30] all of these I've kept from my youth up
[1:37:32] but he had no cross it doesn't do them
[1:37:36] any good be able to quote the message
[1:37:38] quote the Prophet and tell all the
[1:37:39] revelation if they don't have a cross on
[1:37:42] their back it doesn't know good you say
[1:37:46] don't say that is the word then I'll
[1:37:48] challenge this I'll challenge your
[1:37:49] thought with this thought if a man's not
[1:37:52] willing to die to himself then according
[1:37:55] to brother branham he's still a sinner
[1:37:56] so what good does it
[1:37:58] him to memorize message quotes and
[1:38:00] message scriptures if he's still a
[1:38:02] sinner my wife read it to me this
[1:38:05] morning brother Bremen said if any man
[1:38:06] was to deny any supernatural working of
[1:38:08] God he is still a setter
[1:38:11] he's an unbeliever he's not willing to
[1:38:15] tak himself to an old rugged cross no
[1:38:19] matter how much he memorizes or how much
[1:38:21] he learns or she
[1:38:23] without this crucified life right here
[1:38:25] all they've done is compiled a bunch of
[1:38:27] things in their mind and that'll all be
[1:38:30] used against him at the day of judgment
[1:38:32] because then Jesus is going to say you
[1:38:33] knew this and you knew that and you were
[1:38:35] aware of this and you read this in the
[1:38:37] message and you read this in the Bible
[1:38:38] well I then you deny yourself and get on
[1:38:41] the cross it's true I'm preaching that
[1:38:49] lay do sins if I was preaching this in
[1:38:51] the emphasis church they they'd be
[1:38:52] tearing the walls out of the catacombs
[1:38:53] right now right but this is the age of
[1:38:59] people's rights what we want is what we
[1:39:02] want I'm sorry this is not Burger King
[1:39:04] you cannot have it your way the pinna
[1:39:10] that sounds hard I mean it's supposed to
[1:39:13] be easy
[1:39:15] this crucified life this is what real
[1:39:18] Christianity looks like
[1:39:22] but it's not the Christian has been
[1:39:24] presented to us be a good boy be a good
[1:39:27] girl
[1:39:28] there's no such thing as your goodness
[1:39:29] unless you're willing to tak it to a
[1:39:30] cross listen to me your goodness ain't
[1:39:33] gonna get you into heaven your goodness
[1:39:35] ain't gonna keep you out you're a sinner
[1:39:36] from birth and until God straightens
[1:39:38] that out you are on your way to hell
[1:39:41] that's why we need a cross in our life
[1:39:44] to deny everything about ourselves
[1:39:46] I know goodness about me I told Sam
[1:39:53] there tonight sitting down in Missouri
[1:39:56] he's a little old cabin they put us in
[1:39:58] back here and I sit back up there and
[1:40:01] then her and I was talking and I just
[1:40:03] was just kind of opening my heart to her
[1:40:06] and I said you know I think this is
[1:40:07] where the biggest problem is among the
[1:40:09] ranks as we travel what we see more than
[1:40:11] anything else is people just don't want
[1:40:14] God to be boss whatever he wants to do
[1:40:19] he's gonna do it whether I say yes or no
[1:40:22] or maybe or up or down or left or right
[1:40:24] or white or black he's gonna do what he
[1:40:26] wants to do anyhow but people try to
[1:40:29] boss God around and make him do what
[1:40:30] they want him to do and how could I as
[1:40:33] his creation say back to my Creator I
[1:40:37] want you to do it in a certain certain
[1:40:39] way I have no rights that's why I've got
[1:40:41] to tack myself to an old rugged cross
[1:40:44] how could I ever say to em I think it
[1:40:48] ought to be this way save that person
[1:40:50] don't say that how could I ever say to
[1:40:52] an Almighty God that knows the end from
[1:40:54] the very beginning I've been said
[1:41:00] marriage and divorce he could throw me
[1:41:02] in the dust anytime he wants to but how
[1:41:04] dare I try to throw him sheep sheep have
[1:41:11] no rights Barret can call snake can bite
[1:41:15] a tiger can growl but a sheep just lays
[1:41:18] itself out and lets the Shearer take its
[1:41:22] wool from it you know fight you don't
[1:41:25] struggle you don't wrestle come on now
[1:41:27] and Jesus was the Lamb of God and
[1:41:30] remember the only nature that the Holy
[1:41:31] Spirit can mate with is that lamb like
[1:41:34] disposition
[1:41:36] or to God and unless we've got that in
[1:41:39] our unless we've got that kind of
[1:41:41] attitude you no matter how much of the
[1:41:44] message of the Bible we've memorized it
[1:41:46] won't serve one purpose until we're
[1:41:49] willing to crucify ourselves thank you
[1:41:55] Jesus
[1:41:57] mark 8:34 what he called the people unto
[1:42:03] him with his disciples also he said unto
[1:42:05] them whosoever will come after me let
[1:42:08] him deny himself and take up his cross
[1:42:10] and follow me again and again and again
[1:42:14] and again and again and over and over
[1:42:17] and over again Jesus keeps preaching
[1:42:20] this theme because you realize the cross
[1:42:23] for Jesus was an entirely different
[1:42:26] reason than what Rome put him there for
[1:42:28] I've already established to you what
[1:42:30] Rome's purpose was to send a message
[1:42:31] about their power and authority but
[1:42:34] Jesus's cross really took place in the
[1:42:37] Garden of Gethsemane
[1:42:39] whatever he yielded his human will to
[1:42:43] what God his father wanted him to do
[1:42:44] that was the real cross what came ladder
[1:42:48] what came at the end was only what Rome
[1:42:50] had done to him my way of death but
[1:42:53] really he had already but went through
[1:42:55] his crucifixion when he gave up his own
[1:42:57] will and submitted it to God his father
[1:43:00] do you understand that the results of
[1:43:02] what happened in Gethsemane is what
[1:43:04] produced the resurrection later if Jesus
[1:43:07] would have not been willing to give up
[1:43:08] himself he would have never been able to
[1:43:10] lay his life down nor take it up but
[1:43:13] because he was so submitted to God who
[1:43:15] was his father he had the ability to lay
[1:43:18] down the son of man lays down as AI and
[1:43:21] picks it back up again because of the
[1:43:27] cross the emnity was not the devil the
[1:43:34] emnity was human will Satan just used
[1:43:39] human will to interject himself in the
[1:43:42] human race but the real real culprit of
[1:43:44] why Satan was able to overwhelm the
[1:43:47] woman in the Garden of Eden was
[1:43:48] because she yielded her human will over
[1:43:50] let the devil do to her whatever he
[1:43:53] wanted to do to her we'll say something
[1:43:57] now everybody hang on you can only do
[1:44:01] and live as you let God do and live in
[1:44:04] your life and you can only be overcome
[1:44:07] as much as you let the devil overcome
[1:44:10] you the power of yielding surrendering
[1:44:18] brother said one of the greatest weapons
[1:44:20] that he ever saw was the power of
[1:44:22] commitment being able to commit it over
[1:44:25] to God and say God it's yours not mine
[1:44:27] it's yours
[1:44:29] I deny myself I got to you Jesus can I
[1:44:35] go a bit farther thank you greater than
[1:44:40] Solomon is here search needs tonight not
[1:44:44] a soft hybrid something soft and flabby
[1:44:48] like the church is if you don't know
[1:44:50] what soft and flabby is just look up
[1:44:51] here he said the church makes a
[1:44:58] confession baptized and then you're a
[1:45:01] Christian he called that soft and flabby
[1:45:03] well isn't that the same formula that we
[1:45:06] plug in for message people believe the
[1:45:08] Prophet believed the message be baptized
[1:45:11] you believe the seals are open hey man
[1:45:13] you said there was I believe it believe
[1:45:17] it or not a cop for sure so what you're
[1:45:19] telling me right
[1:45:20] I believe it but without the cross in a
[1:45:26] person's life all of that is just
[1:45:29] sympathizing with the message I hope
[1:45:35] you're getting this church
[1:45:37] it's just sympathizing and brother BAM
[1:45:43] called it soft and flabby hard to run a
[1:45:48] race when you're soft and flabby
[1:45:50] believe me I speak from experience
[1:45:57] brother brems said to be a Christian is
[1:46:01] self-denial not self-affirmation not
[1:46:06] positive thinking I'm a great person I'm
[1:46:08] gonna be good today I'm gonna be smart
[1:46:10] huh that might help you as a believer to
[1:46:14] speak positively about your walk with
[1:46:16] God but we're not talking about positive
[1:46:18] affirmation of the believers walk we're
[1:46:21] talking about what it means to be a
[1:46:22] Christian altogether positive thinking
[1:46:25] mind over matter we'll never make a man
[1:46:27] what he's supposed to be you know other
[1:46:29] thing that I'll make him is when he's
[1:46:30] willing to get on a cross and the nice
[1:46:32] health friends do you understand why
[1:46:37] altar calls and the message don't work
[1:46:39] anymore
[1:46:39] because we try to get people saved
[1:46:42] without taking them to the cross I don't
[1:46:45] mean just the cross of Jesus but I mean
[1:46:47] their cross make a confession
[1:46:50] you want to be I want to be I want to be
[1:46:52] saved yeah you saw I'm sorry for my sins
[1:46:55] I want to be a cruiser yes I want to be
[1:46:57] a Christian and then when they walk out
[1:46:59] from the altar the very next day they go
[1:47:01] back to doing what they want to do and
[1:47:03] how they want to do it and the way that
[1:47:04] pleases them and they do their own thing
[1:47:06] and then everything they said at that
[1:47:08] altar was an absolute lie they can say
[1:47:12] their minute at the time but their life
[1:47:13] proves it really wasn't genuine
[1:47:16] you'll want to see an altar call really
[1:47:19] work for people put them on own cross
[1:47:21] when they're up here you wouldn't deny
[1:47:24] self you're willing to walk away oh I
[1:47:26] guarantee you brother you put up the
[1:47:28] test to him like that makes it a whole
[1:47:30] lot harder I have one guy tell me
[1:47:33] brother be and that sounds hard I said
[1:47:35] they ain't supposed to be easy dummy
[1:47:39] right well that's itself - now take up
[1:47:43] your cross deny yourself follow me daily
[1:47:46] today people are so soft well I got up
[1:47:52] this morning and the devil started
[1:47:53] telling me I'm not a Christian and I I'm
[1:47:56] not saved if he was a dead man on a
[1:47:58] cross it wouldn't affect you because
[1:48:02] dead people don't react
[1:48:07] there's the lord levan said you take a
[1:48:10] man he's dead he's dead you kick him he
[1:48:12] don't kick back you talk about him he
[1:48:14] don't talk back why he's dead
[1:48:17] let a man deny himself and die to
[1:48:20] himself no matter what people say about
[1:48:22] him or what anybody else said the only
[1:48:24] matter the devil said no matter what
[1:48:26] they say they're dead be not afraid with
[1:48:34] him said Christianity is self-denial
[1:48:43] Laurie you know get any quieter we're
[1:48:47] gonna have to call this the evening
[1:48:49] light Presbyterian Church the evening
[1:48:52] light Methodist which age you want to
[1:48:54] choose brother let us figure that out as
[1:48:55] we go along and if you understand what
[1:49:03] I'm preaching to you tonight only the
[1:49:06] elect is going to be able to make this
[1:49:07] live right here only the elect foolish
[1:49:10] virgin need not apply
[1:49:13] anybody else need not apply only the
[1:49:16] elect can really do what I'm talking to
[1:49:17] you about tonight because this right
[1:49:19] here is a quality that only a real
[1:49:22] believer can apply to their lives it's
[1:49:25] impossible for them to do otherwise
[1:49:27] because of a man's not really built in a
[1:49:29] way where he can die out to himself then
[1:49:31] it's just a bunch of words and Church
[1:49:33] association but you let paint glory to
[1:49:36] God the elect have the ability to deny
[1:49:40] themselves because they know that their
[1:49:42] self has nothing to do with getting out
[1:49:44] of here in the rapture not saved it
[1:49:47] works that any man could boast but by
[1:49:49] the grace of God been so long since
[1:49:55] message preachers have preached on the
[1:49:57] cross that people really don't
[1:49:59] understand what it means anymore to them
[1:50:03] it's just a cheap emblem that we use you
[1:50:08] know kind of like a cloud or a picture
[1:50:12] it's become so common to people that the
[1:50:15] cross is just an emblem everybody wears
[1:50:17] it
[1:50:18] Satan worshippers turn it upside down
[1:50:20] put it in earrings and on and on and on
[1:50:22] witchcraft folk use it in a different
[1:50:24] way as an emblem for their witchcraft
[1:50:26] and Christianity but what they don't
[1:50:30] understand is it's not just the cross of
[1:50:32] Jesus but it's their cross as well
[1:50:34] everybody loves the cross of Jesus after
[1:50:37] the fact but you're a cross is what's
[1:50:39] gonna make a difference whoo you need a
[1:50:49] five-minute take a big breath break
[1:50:56] Romans chapter 3 verse 25 now watch how
[1:51:00] how the Apostle Paul words this about
[1:51:02] our perpetuation now I just want to show
[1:51:05] you now what this propitiation is we
[1:51:10] hear this term often is applied to the
[1:51:12] cross of Calvary Romans 3:25 the
[1:51:15] propitiation but I just want to show you
[1:51:17] what this is
[1:51:18] well whom God has set forth I'm not
[1:51:21] Jesus now to be a propitiation through
[1:51:24] faith in his blood there you realize
[1:51:28] it's not the blood of Jesus that saves
[1:51:30] you no it's the faith in his blood that
[1:51:35] saves you but the venom said if you had
[1:51:37] a charger of the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:51:39] sitting upper like that you could dip
[1:51:41] your finger you could wash your face in
[1:51:42] it it wouldn't do not one thing for you
[1:51:44] but faith in that blood can change the
[1:51:47] center to a safe change a drunk into a
[1:51:53] sober man a liar into a truth-teller and
[1:51:56] change him all together well hallelujah
[1:51:57] somebody and change him all together
[1:52:00] faith in the blood of Christ
[1:52:02] can turn his whole world upside down so
[1:52:08] what good does it do for them to have 15
[1:52:09] skulls of John the Baptist and 14 cross
[1:52:12] of Calvary nails and that has nothing to
[1:52:15] do with it and we're getting about as
[1:52:18] bad and a message with our relics pieces
[1:52:21] of brother Rams floor and I've got a
[1:52:27] piece of his sleeping bag I've got a
[1:52:29] piece of his shirt I've got a piece of
[1:52:31] his tie I got a piece of
[1:52:32] God does that matter to anybody right
[1:52:40] whom God has set forth to be a
[1:52:42] propitiation through faith in his blood
[1:52:44] to declare whose righteousness his his
[1:52:52] righteousness
[1:52:53] well what about mine what am I chopped
[1:52:56] liver
[1:52:57] don't I have righteous don't I have
[1:52:59] anything no no not at all
[1:53:01] that had been pertinent he would have
[1:53:03] said something about it but he skipped
[1:53:04] it because there was no need even
[1:53:06] mention it it's his righteousness for
[1:53:12] the remission of sins that are past
[1:53:14] through the forbearance of God thank you
[1:53:22] Jesus that watch the word propitiation
[1:53:24] simply means a victim it is spoke of in
[1:53:29] the Old Testament of the covering of the
[1:53:30] Ark and the holy of holies when the
[1:53:33] sprinkling of the blood by the victim on
[1:53:38] the annual day of atonement the victim
[1:53:40] signifying the life of the people and
[1:53:43] the loss of which had merited by their
[1:53:46] sins this victim was offered to God oh
[1:53:49] listen that God by this ceremony would
[1:53:53] be so appeased that he would look down
[1:53:57] on him and say from this day forward to
[1:53:59] another year I'll no longer look at you
[1:54:02] as a sinner I can no longer see you as a
[1:54:07] sinner for one calendar year you are no
[1:54:11] longer as centered in my eyes oh my god
[1:54:14] I hope you're hearing what I'm getting
[1:54:15] ready to say to you the sprinkling of
[1:54:18] the blood of Jesus at Calvary means that
[1:54:20] once not one time and then another and
[1:54:23] then annually but once once and for all
[1:54:25] the Bible said once he sprinkled the
[1:54:29] blood over my life he never never never
[1:54:34] never can ever see me again as a sinner
[1:54:38] we sing the song I'm a sinner saved by
[1:54:41] grace that's absolutely incorrect once
[1:54:43] you are saved you're no longer a sinner
[1:54:45] you're no longer just a no you're no
[1:54:48] longer a sinner in the eyes of God once
[1:54:51] you are saved it's over he always sees
[1:54:55] you through them eyes of grace why he'd
[1:54:58] offered his life as a living victim in
[1:55:04] Romans 12:1 when he said I beseech you
[1:55:09] brethren by the mercies of God that you
[1:55:10] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:55:12] the word sacrifice there is victim
[1:55:16] so Jesus became the victim so that I
[1:55:18] couldn't be wouldn't be a sinner anymore
[1:55:21] and I've got to become a victim I've got
[1:55:25] to become a victim it's the only time in
[1:55:27] the Bible you're allowed to be a victim
[1:55:29] [Laughter]
[1:55:31] somebody it's the only time you're
[1:55:34] allowed to be victimized is when you're
[1:55:36] giving your life as a victim to him
[1:55:39] never again never again can I be looked
[1:55:43] at as a sinner that makes me feel so
[1:55:46] good I feel like shall we glory to God
[1:55:51] my my my
[1:55:54] thank you Lord Jesus in 1st John chapter
[1:55:59] 2 verse 2
[1:56:00] well my clock says 6:18 up here I got
[1:56:03] plenty we're just getting started anyway
[1:56:05] [Music]
[1:56:07] [Laughter]
[1:56:09] 1st John 2:2 and he is the propitiation
[1:56:12] or the victim for our sins listen to me
[1:56:20] Jesus lived thirty three and a half
[1:56:23] years from creation from birth from
[1:56:27] childhood from adolescence to adulthood
[1:56:30] to Christ to it on Transfiguration to
[1:56:34] adoption all the way up to the Garden of
[1:56:36] Gethsemane not one time thirty three and
[1:56:39] a half years did Jesus ever feel guilty
[1:56:41] for sin in his heart not one time
[1:56:48] because there was no sin found in him he
[1:56:52] was spotless
[1:56:53] he was virgin and there was nothing in
[1:56:56] him that would ever make him lay in the
[1:56:58] bed of a knight tears coming out of his
[1:57:00] eyes like you did us God I need you
[1:57:02] somewhere god I need mercy I something's
[1:57:05] wrong with me Lord I Jesus never not one
[1:57:08] time ever felt the touch of condemnation
[1:57:12] or gilding his heart of being a sinner
[1:57:13] not one time and it wasn't until
[1:57:17] Gethsemane that he offered himself a
[1:57:21] victim do you understand this man that
[1:57:25] we call the Lord Jesus how perfect he
[1:57:27] was had never understood what it was
[1:57:31] like to be a sinful feeling no idea had
[1:57:35] no idea what it meant to feel the burden
[1:57:37] or the weight of a convicted heart he
[1:57:40] never felt it never not one time and
[1:57:44] then he sees the cup sat down right
[1:57:48] before him and he realizes this is more
[1:57:51] than a cross this is more than have my
[1:57:54] skin tore from my body this is more than
[1:57:56] people beating me to they can't
[1:57:58] recognize me this is more than a crown
[1:58:00] of thorns going on my head I've got to
[1:58:03] actually become guilty for every sin
[1:58:07] bride or not bride I've got to become
[1:58:12] guilty for everything they do so past
[1:58:19] present and future yes God poured out
[1:58:24] the winepress of his wrath and Jesus
[1:58:27] became a living victim did you imagine
[1:58:31] walking up to Calvary 33 and a half
[1:58:34] years he'd never know what it like to
[1:58:35] feel like to be a homosexual or to be a
[1:58:38] murderer or to be any other type of
[1:58:41] thing he never knew what it felt like to
[1:58:43] be a liar but now as he walks up to
[1:58:47] Calvary he can feel lying he could feel
[1:58:49] lust he can feel murder he can feel
[1:58:51] thievery he can feel this he can feel
[1:58:53] that
[1:58:54] no wonder he looked down on his own
[1:58:56] children no wonder he could not Harbor
[1:59:00] bitterness in his heart because for
[1:59:01] thirty three and a half years he never
[1:59:04] felt what it was like to be burdened
[1:59:07] with sin but here he is hanging on
[1:59:08] Calvary's cross and now he can look at
[1:59:11] them and he can understand why they feel
[1:59:14] the way that they feel
[1:59:21] holy to God glory to God he can feel he
[1:59:26] can see he can sense he can relate no no
[1:59:40] one who can look honorable such mercy
[1:59:42] and say Father forgive him they just
[1:59:45] don't know what they're doing because he
[1:59:49] could feel it for the first time in his
[1:59:52] life he could feel it but he was willing
[2:00:00] to become a victim Oh God
[2:00:05] god help me
[2:00:08] I'm not virgin born I've lived all my
[2:00:12] life with that mark of sin on my life
[2:00:14] but God helped me as a believer to
[2:00:18] become a victim so that you can mold me
[2:00:22] and birth me and make me into a son and
[2:00:25] daughter of God now just as he went
[2:00:30] without feeling that condemnation
[2:00:32] that's what Paul said he said when we
[2:00:34] cross the line between mercy and
[2:00:35] judgment he said a person can never come
[2:00:37] back to mercy
[2:00:38] but you flip that around we cross the
[2:00:40] line between judging judgment and mercy
[2:00:42] then you could never get back to that
[2:00:44] judgment part and now since I've been
[2:00:46] born again
[2:00:47] I've lived every day of my life not
[2:00:49] knowing what condemnation was all about
[2:00:52] a man because there is that nation to
[2:00:58] damage her in Christ Jesus
[2:01:01] they're free a victim a living victim
[2:01:13] first John 4:10 here's love not that we
[2:01:15] loved God but that he loved us and sent
[2:01:21] his son to be the victim for our sins
[2:01:27] now watch this first Corinthians chapter
[2:01:29] 1 verse 17 I'll give you a moment to
[2:01:32] turn in I want you to read this with me
[2:01:33] right here this this especially this
[2:01:35] part here first John 1 verse 17 18 I
[2:01:40] hope you're not getting tired I'm just
[2:01:43] getting warmed up first corinthians 1
[2:01:46] verse 17 for christ sent me not to
[2:01:50] baptize but to preach the gospel what's
[2:01:54] stranger mark well that's it that the
[2:01:56] purpose of preaching get him to the
[2:01:59] water get him to repent get him saved
[2:02:03] well this is that what a preacher is
[2:02:05] supposed to get him in the message
[2:02:08] listen what Paul says here if this don't
[2:02:10] do anything to you tonight nothing
[2:02:12] you've heard thus far does anything you
[2:02:14] do not let this affect you right here
[2:02:16] he said not what the wisdom of words
[2:02:20] lest the cross of Christ listen should
[2:02:25] be a made of none effect which the word
[2:02:27] kino mains me make void of no reputation
[2:02:30] make empty deprived of force render vain
[2:02:33] useless hollow thoughts
[2:02:37] Paul said if my words can put you in
[2:02:41] that it makes the cross hollow useless
[2:02:47] and false listen to me carefully message
[2:02:53] people not only that not it's not the
[2:02:56] words of a preacher that puts you in
[2:02:59] it's your response to those words and
[2:03:02] whether you get on a cross after he
[2:03:04] preaches
[2:03:05] or not because there be many people that
[2:03:10] heard what Paul said there was many in
[2:03:11] his third pool of the day that heard him
[2:03:14] preach and they would blind it out
[2:03:15] couldn't hear another word he said go to
[2:03:18] the Gentiles they rejected what I've
[2:03:20] said so just hearing the words of a
[2:03:23] prophet won't put you in come on
[2:03:27] somebody but it's after you hear the
[2:03:31] words of that prophet preach are you
[2:03:34] willing to get on the cross or not
[2:03:36] listen to me and don't misunderstand a
[2:03:38] word I'm saying that's where a lot of
[2:03:40] these folks have believed just listen to
[2:03:41] the tapes and it's gonna put them in or
[2:03:42] believe brother BAM is gonna put them in
[2:03:44] or just hold on to what the preacher
[2:03:46] says gonna put them in they're missing
[2:03:48] the ballgame altogether because that's
[2:03:50] not how you play the game of life if you
[2:03:52] want to win you got to get on the cross
[2:03:54] if you want resurrection you got to get
[2:03:56] on the car listening to the tape will
[2:03:58] only make you a 2-fold than what she was
[2:04:01] before you got to be willing to get on
[2:04:03] the cross well I was somebody's hearing
[2:04:07] me for the preaching of the Cross is to
[2:04:12] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[2:04:18] which are saved
[2:04:19] ah and us that are saved come on save
[2:04:29] people it is the power of God in other
[2:04:35] words let me put it in my phrases it
[2:04:38] takes what's been preached and makes it
[2:04:41] the opposite of null and the opposite of
[2:04:43] void and the opposite of ineffective it
[2:04:46] makes the word effective it makes the
[2:04:49] word have substance it makes the word
[2:04:52] have a have a feeling inside of your
[2:04:56] heart you know how when you're listening
[2:04:57] to the messages you've heard it over and
[2:04:59] over again but all of a sudden somehow
[2:05:01] you you give up a part of yourself and
[2:05:03] God answers back with some great
[2:05:05] revelation and it's just almost like it
[2:05:07] was just it's just so real I brother
[2:05:08] general said and like somebody's
[2:05:09] standing next to you was so real don't
[2:05:13] you relax what that was you got on a
[2:05:15] cross and when you got on the cross he
[2:05:18] answered back with the
[2:05:19] power of God from that cross and made
[2:05:21] that whatever it was real to you in a
[2:05:23] way the devil or websites or mommy or
[2:05:26] daddy or preachers nobody could take it
[2:05:27] out your heart ever again the power of
[2:05:30] God put it in there because it's
[2:05:31] something that that cannot be explained
[2:05:33] it's like going through that little room
[2:05:35] and the devil woman standard the
[2:05:36] clipboard tell us what it's all about we
[2:05:37] can't that's exactly the way it is you
[2:05:39] cannot explain a revelation from God all
[2:05:42] you can say is it was the power of God
[2:05:51] relations 5:11 we're not far now but
[2:05:58] still a little ways to walk relations
[2:06:03] 511 total Gerald make sure y'all get
[2:06:05] your money's worth
[2:06:11] Galatians 5:11 and I brethren if I yet
[2:06:17] preach circumcision why do i yet suffer
[2:06:21] persecution
[2:06:22] in other words y'all say that if a man
[2:06:25] is circumcised that's what will make him
[2:06:27] saved so I preached it and y'all still
[2:06:30] ain't happy then he asked him this
[2:06:35] question then as the offence of the
[2:06:37] Cross ceased so in other words your
[2:06:41] circumcision or uncircumcision isn't
[2:06:43] gonna put you in or take you out those
[2:06:47] days are over those days are over
[2:06:53] you imagine hard this must have been for
[2:06:55] these men that was these Galatians that
[2:06:56] was going around preaching to be a
[2:06:58] Christian you had to be circumcised in
[2:06:59] your flesh if you was a circumcised you
[2:07:01] really didn't give your heart to God
[2:07:02] reminds me of people around this mess if
[2:07:04] you're a Christian you won't have
[2:07:05] facebook and you won't do this and you
[2:07:07] won't do that
[2:07:08] legalism legalism legalism y'all looking
[2:07:15] at me pretty hard okay my turn people in
[2:07:22] this message will make a devil out of
[2:07:24] anything because the bottom line is
[2:07:26] they're really not secure and they're
[2:07:28] hard that they've got to hold a ghost
[2:07:29] themselves that's why they got to make
[2:07:31] everything
[2:07:32] sinn same people that fussing crow about
[2:07:36] Facebook are the same ones that lay on
[2:07:37] the telephone 24 hours a day years ago
[2:07:40] the telephones just as much a devil as a
[2:07:42] Facebook is you got to hold a ghost the
[2:07:46] Holy Ghost will tell you what's right
[2:07:48] what's clean and what's wrong it's
[2:07:51] exactly right
[2:07:53] people criticize brother Brennan for
[2:07:55] going down and watching the 10
[2:07:56] commandments been preached against
[2:07:59] television shouldn't you stay away from
[2:08:00] that he knew what was right he knew what
[2:08:02] was wrong but Ram wasn't a dummy he knew
[2:08:06] how to follow the Holy Ghost you know
[2:08:09] we've done around this message you live
[2:08:11] a certain way sister's long hair long
[2:08:16] dresses brothers no shorts no jewelry
[2:08:21] all right everything just straight then
[2:08:26] I'll ask you the same question and Paul
[2:08:28] asked these people then as the offence
[2:08:30] of the Cross ceased so holy living is
[2:08:35] what puts you in huh well then why Jesus
[2:08:41] died because I read this morning where
[2:08:43] brother Branham said if there was
[2:08:44] anything you could have done about it
[2:08:46] Jesus died in vain come on somebody
[2:08:50] [Applause]
[2:08:53] so we measure people's holiness by the
[2:08:55] size of the heels the sisters wear yo
[2:09:00] y'all are getting quiet it don't scare
[2:09:03] me it just makes me know that you need
[2:09:04] to learn how to say a man when the
[2:09:05] Heat's on
[2:09:06] I believe in holiness I believe we need
[2:09:12] more of it but my holiness or abiding by
[2:09:15] holiness is not going to put me in a
[2:09:17] rapture no no that ain't what puts me in
[2:09:20] the rapture what puts me in the rapture
[2:09:22] is my faith in the finished work of
[2:09:25] Calvary and God sending back the token
[2:09:28] life as a result of that faith into my
[2:09:31] heart vindicating yes you are a believer
[2:09:34] here's the Holy Ghost is the evidence
[2:09:38] remember because it's not what I accept
[2:09:41] the Holy Ghost it's when the Holy Ghost
[2:09:42] accepts me man that makes me feel
[2:09:49] Pentecostal right nothing I could do
[2:09:54] about it if I could do something about
[2:09:57] it where the jail why he died what was
[2:10:01] the purpose of him dying if I can make
[2:10:03] something happen but here's why we do it
[2:10:05] no message all right buddy you believe
[2:10:07] the message that's what brother Bram
[2:10:08] said here oh you do oh man you're a
[2:10:11] believer oh oh everybody believe are you
[2:10:13] the guy how about this about this
[2:10:15] serpent see down here
[2:10:16] oh yeah see that how about this about
[2:10:17] marriage and divorce yeah that's exactly
[2:10:19] right
[2:10:19] mmm oh no no no no - stay right there
[2:10:21] with that word right there now oh you
[2:10:23] believe the bat I believe the message
[2:10:24] all right you got it boy you're on your
[2:10:26] way when's the last time we ever drugged
[2:10:33] him up and said you want to be saved you
[2:10:37] want to be right with God
[2:10:43] I got a hip you up on the cross all
[2:10:51] right let's get started now we're not
[2:10:54] supposed to do die but but what about
[2:10:59] all this other Oh we'll get to that
[2:11:01] eventually first we need you to die this
[2:11:08] is where our altar calls have went wrong
[2:11:10] because we tried to take him to step 5
[2:11:13] instead of taking them to the first part
[2:11:18] without the cross the message will not
[2:11:22] have the effect on us that we need it to
[2:11:25] have it's still part of the Bible this
[2:11:29] is still Bible preaching and I my Bible
[2:11:32] tells me I don't know what your says
[2:11:34] over here in Newfoundland but mine says
[2:11:35] he that adds to or takes away his part
[2:11:37] will be taken out I don't want to take
[2:11:39] that part out of the word just a bit
[2:11:48] further forgive me Galatians 6 verse 12
[2:11:54] as many as desire to make a fair show in
[2:11:58] the flesh they constrain you to be
[2:12:01] circumcised only lest they should suffer
[2:12:05] persecution for the cause of Christ for
[2:12:08] neither they themselves who are
[2:12:10] circumcised keep the law so do as I say
[2:12:17] not as I do that's what that means
[2:12:22] basically hmm huh but desire to have you
[2:12:32] circumcised that they may glory in your
[2:12:37] flesh let me tell you you know why that
[2:12:42] guy's a believer I told him how to dress
[2:12:44] I told her I died verse 14 but God
[2:12:49] forbid that I should glory Paul says
[2:12:52] save
[2:12:54] a man in the cross of our Lord Jesus
[2:12:59] Christ by whom the world is crucified
[2:13:02] unto me and I under the world the
[2:13:20] fusions chapter 2 verse 16 watch this
[2:13:23] and he may reconcile reconcile both
[2:13:26] under God in one body by the cross
[2:13:30] having slain the enmity thereby don't
[2:13:35] you understand he rendered the devil
[2:13:37] Pallas when he yielded up his human will
[2:13:44] Satan could not drive a razor blade into
[2:13:48] his experience when Jesus yielded his
[2:13:54] human will incarnate assembly
[2:13:56] he was brother many said he was so
[2:13:59] yielded to his father and brother Ram
[2:14:05] called it a toxin he said they would use
[2:14:07] a guinea pig and practice on a guinea
[2:14:09] pig how to make sure a toxin held and he
[2:14:13] said when the inoculation came to Jesus
[2:14:15] it had to be tested to see if it would
[2:14:18] hold or not well all right and he said
[2:14:21] when he came to get fattening and the
[2:14:23] devil tried to get him to trade the
[2:14:24] cross for the world and for peace and
[2:14:26] for this that the other
[2:14:27] and Jesus yielded his human will for the
[2:14:30] cross and for what the father wanted but
[2:14:34] remember said it proved the inoculation
[2:14:36] from heaven how it held in death it held
[2:14:41] in trials it held in suffering and
[2:14:43] greater than he could defeat the devil
[2:14:46] because he yielded his human will said
[2:14:52] father not my well
[2:14:55] I don't settle down I'm gonna start
[2:15:02] speaking another language in man
[2:15:03] oh brother Bob I'm into my heavenly
[2:15:10] places with y'all are not Jesus Thank
[2:15:19] You Lamb of God one body by the cross
[2:15:23] having slain the L&T thereby you say but
[2:15:26] the enmity is the devil right but the
[2:15:29] results of how the devil was slain was
[2:15:34] because Jesus did what Eve would not do
[2:15:37] Eve yielded herself to the devil's lie
[2:15:40] Jesus refused to yield don't you
[2:15:43] understand
[2:15:44] I just preached to you how can I
[2:15:46] overcome that is the essence of how you
[2:15:49] can become an overcomer it's not whether
[2:15:51] you pray through or eat cereal with
[2:15:52] angels or have great supernatural things
[2:15:54] all of that comes with the life of a
[2:15:56] believer but when a matter one can
[2:15:58] become so consecrated to God until the
[2:16:01] devil take touch up there so that's what
[2:16:12] Jesus that's how we overcome and that's
[2:16:15] how you and I that's how he slain the
[2:16:26] enmity because he was willing to yield
[2:16:31] himself
[2:16:37] thank you
[2:16:40] Philippians 2 verse 8 mighty God we
[2:16:45] thank you thank you or chief Olympians 2
[2:16:53] verse 8 being found in the fashion as a
[2:16:57] man why the Bible say this couldn't left
[2:17:01] this part out this whole thing about the
[2:17:04] matter why is that important at all
[2:17:05] don't you realize Paul was trying to
[2:17:08] show this human
[2:17:09] and he had to show this human element
[2:17:13] because it was through the human element
[2:17:15] that Christ came to the greatest
[2:17:17] overcoming of his life we're not going
[2:17:20] to overcome God or the devil rather as
[2:17:22] angels we're not going to overcome as
[2:17:25] infallible people will rid of God
[2:17:28] somebody but the bride I'm talking about
[2:17:31] the real elect of God is going to
[2:17:34] overcome this evil Age of Satan's eater
[2:17:36] that we live in as a man follow the Holy
[2:17:41] Ghost yielded to the Holy Spirit
[2:17:46] you're not going to overcome overcome
[2:17:49] the devil as being an infallible person
[2:17:51] that never makes a mistake but actually
[2:17:53] compromise you're gonna be the guy
[2:17:55] that's always messing up but it's so
[2:17:58] yielded to the Holy Ghost that when you
[2:17:59] do you say Lord I'm sorry forgive me
[2:18:01] keep working on me keep working on me
[2:18:03] Jesus it's that kind of attitude that's
[2:18:08] gonna put a man on the cross and
[2:18:10] bringing out the resurrection Jesus
[2:18:18] could have we have every reason why I
[2:18:19] shouldn't go I got more revivals I can
[2:18:22] preach I got more dead I can raise I got
[2:18:24] more but the will of God his next step
[2:18:26] in life was the cross of Calvary and
[2:18:29] believe this or not it was the greatest
[2:18:31] part of his ministry and the only thing
[2:18:33] that superseded it was the resurrection
[2:18:34] power when he raised on the third day
[2:18:40] Philippians 3:18 being found in fashion
[2:18:45] as a man he humbled himself and became
[2:18:47] obedient unto death Paul says even the
[2:18:50] death of the cross even the death of the
[2:18:54] cost founders of fashion as a man he
[2:18:56] humbled himself became a beaten to the
[2:18:57] death of the cost of Liberty 3:18 from
[2:18:59] any walk of whom I told you often and
[2:19:01] now tell you weeping they're the enemies
[2:19:04] of the cross of Christ let me work on
[2:19:07] your mind for a moment in our thoughts
[2:19:09] we thank enemies to the cross we think
[2:19:11] of people that are maybe picketing signs
[2:19:13] outside of churches and down with God
[2:19:15] and blaspheming God but really
[2:19:18] an enemy to the cross of Christ is any
[2:19:20] person that would try to lead somebody
[2:19:23] to Jesus Christ or to follow Jesus
[2:19:26] Christ without coming through the cross
[2:19:28] route so a preacher or some preacher or
[2:19:31] some leader or somebody in the message a
[2:19:34] father or whatever it might be that
[2:19:35] would try to lead people into the
[2:19:37] message without coming through the cross
[2:19:39] they have made themselves an enemy to
[2:19:42] what the cross stands for because the
[2:19:46] cross wasn't about Jesus dying as part
[2:19:49] of it sure it wasn't about him taking
[2:19:52] stripes that's part of it sure but to be
[2:19:55] many that was healed by those stripes
[2:19:56] that never go on to the fullness of what
[2:19:58] the cross meant that's right there'll be
[2:20:00] many for the mention a prostitute walks
[2:20:02] on the platform have faith to be healed
[2:20:03] go right off at a worse thing to come on
[2:20:05] or six months later never serve God
[2:20:07] another day in her life the stripes was
[2:20:09] a temporal thing for you and I brings
[2:20:11] our resurrection brings all these other
[2:20:12] things but the purpose of the cross was
[2:20:15] deeper than just divine healing the
[2:20:18] purpose was to show that a man could so
[2:20:23] yield himself to God that he could take
[2:20:26] away the enmity hang on everybody but
[2:20:31] the bride is going to become so yielded
[2:20:32] to the Holy Ghost that while she's
[2:20:35] living on this earth and Satan's Eden
[2:20:36] she's going to overcome every emnity
[2:20:39] every devil every spirit every evil come
[2:20:43] on now she's gonna whip everything
[2:20:46] contrary to the word not when the
[2:20:48] rapture come but before she's taken out
[2:20:50] of here she's gonna put her feet on
[2:20:52] everything there is to put her feet on
[2:20:54] and then why she knows how to slay the
[2:20:57] enmity she heald's herself over
[2:21:04] Colossians 1:20 and having made peace
[2:21:10] through the blood of his cross by him to
[2:21:14] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[2:21:17] I said whether they be things in earth
[2:21:20] or things in heaven now listen Christ
[2:21:24] was not just going to reconcile that
[2:21:27] which was on the earth because remember
[2:21:29] there's some people that had already
[2:21:30] crossed over into paradise
[2:21:32] that needed this work of reconciliation
[2:21:34] - and every one of them died died like
[2:21:40] men died like women every one of them
[2:21:43] went to the grave that be a death Quran
[2:21:46] Zac gone dead every one of them with the
[2:21:50] same way every man's ever going to go
[2:21:52] that lives in a human body but in order
[2:21:55] for Jesus to reconcile and make peace
[2:21:58] between God and man it had to be taken
[2:22:02] through a cross now remember the cross
[2:22:06] wasn't just two pieces of wood but
[2:22:09] remember brother Branham said God
[2:22:11] crossed himself with humanity stretched
[2:22:17] his tent so there was actually a greater
[2:22:20] cross on the hillside of Calvary than
[2:22:22] just the old rugged cross but it was the
[2:22:25] cross between God and man and in that
[2:22:28] cross between God and man God had
[2:22:30] crossed himself with humanity he
[2:22:33] reconciled the world unto himself so it
[2:22:41] wasn't just the old rugged cross that
[2:22:42] saved me but it was that rugged there
[2:22:45] was that cross between God and man that
[2:22:47] saved me as well maybe you're not
[2:22:52] getting it but that cross is how come
[2:22:55] you and I could be saved if God didn't
[2:22:57] become us we could never become him come
[2:22:59] on somebody so we had to cross himself
[2:23:02] with humanity and by doing so ever he
[2:23:05] was able to reconcile in one body
[2:23:10] heavens and earth and all things beneath
[2:23:14] the earth and all things around the
[2:23:16] earth he could bring reconciliation
[2:23:18] through the cross while he hung on the
[2:23:21] cross
[2:23:22] [Applause]
[2:23:28] Colossians 2:14 blotting out the
[2:23:33] handwriting of Ordinances that was
[2:23:36] against us maybe you don't understand
[2:23:41] this I hope you can I think you can I
[2:23:45] believe you can but there was a
[2:23:48] handwriting of Ordinances what a man
[2:23:52] walked into the temple his sin was wrote
[2:23:55] down on this book right here they take
[2:24:00] the lamb sprinkle the blood and that sin
[2:24:04] was covered but next year if he walked
[2:24:06] in and had the same problem and they
[2:24:09] found that sin on the book he was stoned
[2:24:11] without mercy under two and three
[2:24:14] witnesses but Jesus he said lo I come in
[2:24:19] the volume of the book meaning the sins
[2:24:21] it was wrote down and the sins that
[2:24:23] wasn't wrote down the handwriting
[2:24:27] remember God keeps a record of
[2:24:28] everything that's ever been done or ever
[2:24:30] will be done that handwriting of the
[2:24:33] book of sin as it were symbolically
[2:24:36] speaking this little book of sin we
[2:24:38] could say that had every sin that man
[2:24:40] would ever commit God knew it from the
[2:24:42] very beginning when God became a man
[2:24:44] Jesus went to the cross he took that
[2:24:46] book and he tacked it to himself that's
[2:24:49] what the Bible said which was contrary
[2:24:52] to us and took it out of the way nailing
[2:24:55] it to his cross so as it was he took
[2:25:00] this book of sin every sin you'd ever
[2:25:02] commit things you didn't even realize
[2:25:04] was Sam was against you and he took that
[2:25:06] sin book and tacked it to the cross took
[2:25:11] his blood and wrote his blood all over
[2:25:13] the outside hallelujah to the lamb of
[2:25:16] God he took that blood and washed away
[2:25:19] every sin that would ever be committed
[2:25:22] by the elect of God that's the reason
[2:25:25] why I could die in him in Calvary be
[2:25:27] with him in hell and take the keys and
[2:25:29] race with him on the third day because I
[2:25:31] was already justified when he took my
[2:25:34] and now to the cross of Calvary and no
[2:25:42] matter how hard the devil prize he'll
[2:25:44] never get this book off that cross my
[2:25:54] Jamie I wish I wasn't old now that way I
[2:25:56] could shout like I want you Hebrews 12:2
[2:26:03] what a great scripture to finish on
[2:26:06] looking unto Jesus the author and the
[2:26:10] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[2:26:13] that was set before him endured the
[2:26:17] cross I have a hard time getting my mind
[2:26:27] how that he had any idea what I was
[2:26:30] gonna be or how was gonna be or how was
[2:26:32] gonna go about being it I have a hard
[2:26:34] time figuring out into the sea of people
[2:26:37] that he'd have to weave through and wade
[2:26:40] through how he had me on his mind but
[2:26:45] that's what makes him so great because
[2:26:48] he doesn't see even a flea bad as I but
[2:26:51] what he don't know how much talos in the
[2:26:53] eye he don't see a sparrow go hungry but
[2:26:57] what he don't send down your McDonald's
[2:26:58] french fries it was too stealing you
[2:27:00] threw him out the window
[2:27:00] Jesus was feeding sparrows with him come
[2:27:04] on somebody he knows he knows he knows
[2:27:08] everywhere we are and everywhere we're
[2:27:10] going to be and everything we've ever
[2:27:11] been in his mind he saw us in this way
[2:27:14] of perfection he saw us in the way of
[2:27:17] maturity as manifested sons of God but
[2:27:21] he also knew the way we would come to
[2:27:23] this earth the only way that we could
[2:27:25] ever raise up to that great place in God
[2:27:27] is he would have to take what we came to
[2:27:31] this world in sin iniquity speaking lies
[2:27:34] he'd have to take every bit of that upon
[2:27:35] himself and tak it to a cross now if my
[2:27:40] sins are gone then the only thing that I
[2:27:43] can do after that is from here on out
[2:27:45] every day of my life so
[2:27:47] under my will to what his word has to
[2:27:51] tell us that's what I meant preachers
[2:27:54] nowadays are too nice they're preaching
[2:27:57] positive thinking they're preaching
[2:27:58] positive living and and and and heaven
[2:28:01] and God and rapture and all of that's
[2:28:04] great but it makes me wonder we've got a
[2:28:07] whole generation of people coming up now
[2:28:08] and many of may never really heard the
[2:28:10] cross preach like they need to hear it
[2:28:12] preached and many of them know how to
[2:28:15] start that's the reason why some of the
[2:28:18] young people sit around this mess is I
[2:28:20] don't even know if I got to Holy Ghost
[2:28:21] none it's because they've never been
[2:28:23] taken to the foot of the cross and shown
[2:28:25] how to die out so that Jesus could be
[2:28:27] made new in their life that's the reason
[2:28:30] some of us still struggle with things
[2:28:31] trying to figure out what's the answer
[2:28:33] what's the solution what's the we got to
[2:28:35] go to the cross that's the answer you
[2:28:38] want rapture you want resurrection
[2:28:40] you've got to go to the crops that's the
[2:28:44] only things gonna take us there
[2:28:47] god help me to stay tied to an old
[2:28:50] rugged cross
[2:29:06] so so so so so much more than I could
[2:29:10] say but as we say at home I think you
[2:29:13] get the gist of it if we don't
[2:29:19] understand perhaps what that means by
[2:29:23] self-denial let me give you a small
[2:29:25] example it's as if a person walking
[2:29:30] through their day would have certain
[2:29:32] thoughts that they meditate on certain
[2:29:34] things they could they they contemplate
[2:29:36] it could be with the word could be not
[2:29:39] with the word but we we entertained
[2:29:41] through our mind different thoughts a
[2:29:44] lot of times if we're not careful what
[2:29:47] the devil does is he uses them thoughts
[2:29:49] to start building a case of something
[2:29:52] either something's trying to trap you
[2:29:53] into or discourage you with or ever what
[2:29:56] it is but this is why Paul said first
[2:29:58] Corinthians 10 bring every thought to
[2:30:01] the obedience of Christ
[2:30:04] this is what crucifying yourself really
[2:30:07] looks like bringing every thought to the
[2:30:10] obedience of Christ no matter what it is
[2:30:12] make sure it lines up with the word at a
[2:30:15] young man write me today brother band
[2:30:17] I've had a certain dream into certain
[2:30:19] dreams this way and I saw this figure
[2:30:20] and it was this way and that way and I
[2:30:22] said brethren this is the problem with
[2:30:24] dreams nowadays brother branham said if
[2:30:26] it's not a prophet in the land it cannot
[2:30:28] be a simple thing to be interpreted it
[2:30:30] must be a direct message like you said
[2:30:32] fear not to take Mary thy wife there was
[2:30:34] a direct message symbols and all that
[2:30:37] stuff remember said those things aren't
[2:30:38] for us today
[2:30:39] so when you see dreams I can't they're
[2:30:41] full of symbols you either need to take
[2:30:43] you a pepto-bismol before you go to bed
[2:30:44] or quit eating burritos for the nights
[2:30:46] over I'm talking to you Joe
[2:30:54] because those are not inspirational
[2:30:55] things but you see how quickly people
[2:30:58] will take a dream or some kind of
[2:31:00] supernatural to start building a case
[2:31:02] and a lot of times the devil knows that
[2:31:04] down the road if they hold to that fault
[2:31:06] like you talk about that gun shooting a
[2:31:07] certain way you said if it gets off just
[2:31:09] a little bit up here when it gets way
[2:31:11] down to the target it's way off down on
[2:31:12] the end of it down there and say that's
[2:31:14] where we have to be the most careful a
[2:31:16] certain thought go through our mind you
[2:31:18] make sure that thought is crucified with
[2:31:21] Christ on Calvary because that thought
[2:31:24] may be the very thought that leads to a
[2:31:25] believe the sign web site or it leads to
[2:31:27] a preacher that's not telling the truth
[2:31:29] or leads to a dot dot dot get lead
[2:31:34] anywhere that's why we need to bring
[2:31:37] every thought Oh B D n't to the mind of
[2:31:40] God God help me help me God help me
[2:31:46] please help me more tell me it's
[2:31:50] practica thank you Lord Jesus for your

[2:42:47] Jesus in Jesus name thank you lord
[2:42:56] I was gonna go an entirely different way

[2:43:05] the special you brought tonight I wanna
[2:43:08] sing that again that's where I got the
[2:43:10] inspiration for this tonight I was gonna
[2:43:12] go a different way all together but
[2:43:13] sister was singing and as she was
[2:43:16] singing I just somehow seemed like the
[2:43:18] Holy Spirit is real sweetness that go
[2:43:19] this way instead oh I've got the hay on
[2:43:22] the fourth we'll get to it for the

[2:43:47] [Music]

[2:44:20] [Applause]
[2:44:28] [Music]
[2:44:49] strange
[2:44:50] [Applause]

[2:44:58] [Applause]
[2:45:49] time
[2:45:50] [Applause]
[2:46:06] [Music]
[2:46:27] [Music]
[2:46:34] [Applause]
[2:46:36] [Music]
[2:46:41] [Applause]
[2:46:42] [Music]
[2:46:49] amen praise the Lord thank God for the
[2:46:52] word Amen than I trust by grace it's a
[2:46:56] revelation to our hearts Amen then we
[2:46:59] also bear a cross and I was thinking of
[2:47:03] the scripture and our brother was to
[2:47:05] have his looking forward looking for it
[2:47:07] and that as our brother was ministering
[2:47:11] concerning you know to know him and the
[2:47:13] power of his resurrection and again I
[2:47:17] keep remembering with our brother Bill
[2:47:19] Hagin said years ago and I was that was
[2:47:21] in the church and that was back on the
[2:47:23] platform somewhere and he was that he
[2:47:25] was ministering and he sent he quoted
[2:47:27] that verse and he said in Pentecost we
[2:47:30] only quoted the first line and he said
[2:47:32] we said to know him in the power of his
[2:47:34] resurrection we stopped and he said but
[2:47:37] now he said we need to go on and he said
[2:47:39] to know him also in the Fellowship of is
[2:47:43] suffering a man and to do that we have a
[2:47:46] cross severe a man so and again there
[2:47:50] was a song and the song is take up that
[2:47:52] cross and follow me and it says I hear
[2:47:55] the blessed Savior call how can I make a
[2:47:59] lesser sacrifice when Jesus gave us all
[2:48:03] a man so there's a cross for us to bear
[2:48:06] by the grace of God where any easy there
[2:48:10] to enable us to bear he's there to give
[2:48:12] us the strength to bear it and I mean
[2:48:14] there's also a scripture that came to my
[2:48:16] mind and in my heart right I believe and
[2:48:19] our brother read it a million our
[2:48:22] brother read that brothers is tremendous
[2:48:24] I trust we will not forget it
[2:48:26] don't go I don't know go and try to live
[2:48:28] your life and think well Jesus did it
[2:48:30] all Jesus did it all but we're going to
[2:48:32] identify with him in the Fellowship of
[2:48:34] his suffering amen he suffered now we
[2:48:37] suffer amen
[2:48:39] in appreciation for what he has done he
[2:48:42] suffered for us now we're going to we're
[2:48:45] going to endure this and endure this and
[2:48:46] endure that for his sake and for the
[2:48:49] glory of God and then the any reference
[2:48:53] Luke for Dean and I ministered I'm not
[2:48:55] not long ago concerning those who are
[2:48:58] called to the marriage
[2:48:59] the lame and refused and because they
[2:49:02] were selfish they weren't they didn't
[2:49:05] want to bear no cross they wanted to do
[2:49:07] what was in their own eyes but was right
[2:49:09] in their own eyes and so on and you know
[2:49:11] and they said we'll go call this one and
[2:49:13] he said I can't come because I bought
[2:49:15] some land I got to go check it and I
[2:49:17] can't come because that I bought five
[2:49:19] yoke of oxen and I got to do this I
[2:49:21] can't come because I got married and I
[2:49:23] can't do this and he had and he said
[2:49:26] well he said they won't taste with my
[2:49:27] supper no no they were not willing to
[2:49:30] they were not willing to lay it all
[2:49:31] aside pick up their cross and go and go
[2:49:34] in obedience to the master to the king
[2:49:37] amen
[2:49:38] they made to pay a price you got it you
[2:49:41] got it first see and crying let that be
[2:49:43] crucified what you want to do what does
[2:49:45] God want to do a man then let it England
[2:49:49] here will be crucified so if we're going
[2:49:51] to do the will of God no even the powers
[2:49:53] resurrection and in the Fellowship of
[2:49:56] its suffering amen god help us amen so
[2:50:01] then again a knee and he went on and he
[2:50:03] said they won that I can taste some of
[2:50:05] my supper and he's a good into the
[2:50:07] highways and byways to give the lame the
[2:50:09] halt the blind brilliant even those that
[2:50:12] were occurring crosses those that had a
[2:50:14] cross willing to carry across a man and
[2:50:17] not complaining by the grace of Almighty
[2:50:20] God they were going to use this as an
[2:50:22] excuse or that as an excuse I can't
[2:50:24] afford it and I can't I can't do this
[2:50:26] and I can't do that no no they they they
[2:50:29] honored it by the grace of Almighty God
[2:50:31] and Jesus said none of them those that
[2:50:35] men which were bidden shall taste of my
[2:50:37] supper none god elvis not all believers
[2:50:41] are going to taste of the summer as he
[2:50:43] as he said that all believers are going
[2:50:44] to be in the resurrection and rapture
[2:50:46] any man only those that had that have
[2:50:49] laid down their their lives and
[2:50:51] they picked up a cross a man says that I
[2:50:56] walked one day along a country road and
[2:50:58] there a stranger journey to bend blow
[2:51:01] beneath the burden of his road it was a
[2:51:03] cross a cross I knew a man sir we all
[2:51:06] that crosses to bear they made every one
[2:51:09] of us there's the challenge of our faith
[2:51:12] by the grace of God amen and he said
[2:51:16] right here and he said if any man come
[2:51:19] to me and hate Nadia's father and mother
[2:51:23] and wife and children and brethren and
[2:51:25] sisters and his own life but that's a
[2:51:28] cross that's a cross it's not not doing
[2:51:33] what I thought I want to do I do what
[2:51:35] God wants me to do and he said he cannot
[2:51:38] be my disciple it can't be my disciple
[2:51:41] and our brother quoted verse 27
[2:51:44] whosoever does not bear his cross and
[2:51:48] come after me cannot be my disciple to
[2:51:52] bear the cross of total separation unto
[2:51:54] the Lord the better the cross has taken
[2:51:57] your stand for Jesus regardless a
[2:51:59] million and on down he said he says so
[2:52:02] likewise whosoever he be of you that
[2:52:06] forsaken not all that he has he cannot
[2:52:09] be my disciple
[2:52:11] that's tremendous rather than revelation
[2:52:13] of the cross it is absolutely tremendous
[2:52:16] wonderful so I trusted that you will not
[2:52:19] forget what God has spoken tonight and
[2:52:22] if necessary go get a coffee and listen
[2:52:25] to it again and listen to it again and
[2:52:26] listen to it again
[2:52:27] amen and say lord help me to take my
[2:52:30] take the cross amen
[2:52:32] by the grace of Almighty God so there is
[2:52:35] a cross to bear it may a might have to
[2:52:38] do with your your personal light it
[2:52:40] might have to do with your family your
[2:52:42] friends your neighbors they might have
[2:52:44] to do
[2:52:44] your your your your income I don't know
[2:52:47] but God knows but we bear it but what is
[2:52:50] what God allow it all that for to test
[2:52:52] our faith and then to bring out the
[2:52:55] Christ in us amen what he did not my
[2:52:58] will father then be done amen
[2:53:01] those though those that were invited to
[2:53:04] the supper you know with the land and
[2:53:06] the oxen and the marriage and all that
[2:53:09] they were going to say not my will
[2:53:11] father thine be done
