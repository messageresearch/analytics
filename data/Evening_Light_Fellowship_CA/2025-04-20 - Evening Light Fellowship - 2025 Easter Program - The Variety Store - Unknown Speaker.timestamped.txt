[9:36] Thank God bless you. I want to welcome
[9:38] each one of you here tonight to our
[9:40] special program we're doing for Easter.
[9:42] And this has been certainly a long time
[9:44] in the making. I think it's three and a
[9:46] half almost four months since uh Sister
[9:48] Priscilla kind of put together a plan
[9:50] for what we were going to do here
[9:51] tonight. And as you can see, we've gone
[9:53] all out. Certainly for us, we've gone
[9:55] all out. Maybe hundreds of dollars
[9:57] spent. So I appreciate everything that's
[10:00] gone into this. This is a whole team
[10:01] effort that's come in. I think about
[10:03] half the church is involved in some way
[10:04] or the other. And uh certainly
[10:06] appreciate brother Matt, brother Vichel
[10:08] working on the audio visual. Uh we've
[10:10] really had to expand our system to allow
[10:12] everyone to be miked up the way they are
[10:13] tonight. So lots of hard work, lots of
[10:16] days and evenings and weekends and those
[10:18] sorts of things. So before it happens,
[10:20] we want to say thank you and we
[10:21] appreciate everything you've done. We
[10:23] appreciate the willing attitude, the
[10:25] vigorous cooperation that we've seen
[10:27] from each one and just trusting it'll be
[10:30] a blessing tonight. Welcome all of our
[10:31] visitors. I don't know all of you by
[10:33] name. I know we have some from Ankor
[10:34] Academy. I think the Collinses and the
[10:36] guys brought along a whole slew of
[10:38] people as well. So, God bless you.
[10:40] Marilyn Taylor's here with us again
[10:42] tonight and different ones. So, God
[10:43] bless you. Trusting this will be a a
[10:45] wonderful time as we we do this tonight.
[10:48] I'm just going to open with a word of
[10:49] prayer and then we'll we'll do our our
[10:51] song if that's okay. Let's bow our
[10:53] heads. Lord Jesus, Lord, it's a
[10:56] wonderful weekend that we spend, Lord,
[10:57] to remember the price that you paid at
[10:59] Calvary, Lord. But we're not just here
[11:02] to remember the price, Lord. But we're
[11:03] here to remember the benefits as well,
[11:05] Lord. That when you rose again, Lord,
[11:07] that you said that spirit would come
[11:08] back and it would live inside each one
[11:10] of us and it would produce Christ and
[11:12] flesh all over again in just a little
[11:14] bit in each one. So, Lord, we're
[11:16] thankful tonight, Lord, that we have
[11:17] your spirit dwelling in us, Lord. And
[11:19] we're praying that as we do this for
[11:21] your glory and your honor, Lord, that
[11:22] you would minister, that you would
[11:24] speak, Lord, that you would touch our
[11:25] hearts and lives, Lord. that you would
[11:27] bring freedom and healing, Lord, to
[11:29] those that are here and listening and
[11:30] watching this today. Lord, bless those
[11:32] that are participating that have put so
[11:34] much effort in. Lord, may you pour out
[11:36] on them a wonderful blessing that they
[11:38] can't contain each one. Lord, just have
[11:40] your way now. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[11:42] name we pray it. Amen. Amen. Let's stand
[11:45] if we would and we're going to sing that
[11:46] song, Marvelous Grace, before the play
[11:48] starts.
[11:49] [Music]
[11:54] Marvelous grace of our
[11:59] loveing
[12:02] Lord. Grace that
[12:06] exceeds our sin and our guilt.
[12:14] Yonder on
[12:18] Calories
[12:23] Mount there where the blood of the
[12:30] lamb was spilled.
[12:36] Grace.
[12:39] Grace.
[12:41] God's
[12:44] grace. Grace and will
[12:49] pardon and
[12:51] cleanse with
[12:55] thee.
[12:57] Grace. Grace.
[13:01] [Music]
[13:03] God's grace.
[13:06] Grace that is
[13:10] greater than
[13:13] all our
[13:16] sin. Dark is the stain that we
[13:23] can not hide.
[13:28] What can
[13:31] avail to wash
[13:34] it
[13:37] away? Love there is
[13:42] flowing a
[13:51] cra you may
[13:55] be today.
[14:01] Grace,
[14:04] grace.
[14:06] God's
[14:09] grace, grace that will
[14:13] pardon and
[14:16] cleanse with me.
[14:19] [Music]
[14:22] Grace,
[14:24] grace,
[14:27] God's
[14:29] grace, your grace that is
[14:34] greater than
[14:37] all our sins.
[14:43] Fulous
[14:45] sment and
[14:48] mashless
[14:51] grace and
[14:53] free
[15:03] sto who are
[15:05] longing to
[15:08] see his face.
[15:13] bear you this
[15:16] moment his
[15:19] grace
[15:22] receive grace.
[15:25] [Music]
[15:27] Grace
[15:30] God's
[15:33] grace grace that will
[15:37] pardon and
[15:40] cleans
[15:43] with grace.
[15:48] Grace.
[15:51] God's
[15:54] grace. Grace that is
[15:58] greater than
[16:01] all our sin.
[16:07] [Music]
[16:22] Ephesians 2:8. For by grace are ye saved
[16:26] through faith, and that not of
[16:28] yourselves, it is the gift of
[16:30] God. 1 John
[16:32] 4:9-10. And this was manifested the love
[16:35] of God towards us because that God sent
[16:38] his only begotten son into the world
[16:40] that we might live through him. Harion
[16:43] is love not that we loved God but that
[16:46] he loved us and sent his son to be the
[16:49] propitiation for our sins.
[17:21] [Music]
[17:45] The cough that
[17:49] separated
[17:51] me from Christ my Lord.
[17:59] It was so vast the crossing I could
[18:05] never
[18:11] afford. From where I was to his
[18:16] domain it seemed so far.
[18:24] My cry dear Lord I cannot come to where
[18:32] you
[18:35] [Music]
[18:37] are. He came to me.
[18:43] He came to
[18:49] me when I could not
[18:53] come to where he was. He came to me.
[19:02] That's why he
[19:07] died on
[19:13] Calary when I could not
[19:18] come to where he was. He came to me.
[19:29] He came to me when I was
[19:34] bound in chains of
[19:40] sin. He came to me when I possessed no
[19:47] hope with him.
[19:53] He picked me up and drew me gently to
[19:59] his
[20:04] side. Where to take in his sweet love I
[20:10] now abide.
[20:17] He came to
[20:21] me. He came to
[20:27] me. When I could not
[20:31] come to where he was, he came to
[20:38] me. That's why he died.
[20:44] Oh
[20:49] Calary, when I could not
[20:53] come to where he was, he came to
[21:01] me. He came to me.
[21:07] He came to
[21:11] me when I could not
[21:15] come to where he was. He came to me.
[21:24] That's why he
[21:28] died on
[21:34] Calary. When I could not
[21:38] come to where he
[21:41] was, he came to me.
[22:00] When I could not
[22:03] come to where he
[22:06] was, he came to me.
[22:11] [Music]
[22:30] ation of Christianity. It's the mercy of
[22:32] God that bought you a Calvary and you
[22:34] are God's love gift to Christ. And if
[22:37] God gave a gift to Christ, Christ keeps
[22:39] his gift.
[22:42] [Music]
[22:51] [Music]
[23:10] [Music]
[23:37] [Music]
[24:05] Ain't
[24:06] it a Christian?
[24:12] Ain't it be a Christian?
[24:16] [Music]
[24:19] on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[24:23] Friday, Saturday and all day with a
[24:32] Christian. Ain't it grand? Your neighbor
[24:36] ate it.
[24:40] Ain't
[24:41] it your neighbor?
[24:47] And Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
[24:50] Thursday, Friday sat and all they
[24:54] saw your neighbor ate
[25:00] it. It followed Jesus ate
[25:06] it. A
[25:09] grand Jesus made a grand.
[25:14] on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
[25:18] Friday,
[25:22] Saturday of Jesus at a grand
[25:40] [Music]
[25:59] What the
[26:18] All the world felt bright since I got
[26:21] right. Now I sing and pray and shout.
[26:26] All my burdens have been lifted. Since
[26:29] the Savior brought me out, I will tell
[26:34] the world both far and near. as I travel
[26:38] here
[26:39] below. That I'd rather be an oldtime
[26:43] Christian than anything I know.
[26:47] I'd rather be an old time Christian than
[26:52] anything I know. There's nothing like an
[26:56] old time Christian with a Christian love
[27:00] to show. I'm walking in the grand old
[27:04] highway and I'm telling everywhere I go
[27:09] that I'd rather be an old time Christian
[27:12] than anything I know.
[27:22] Ah, Pastor David, I need to speak with
[27:24] you. Yes, Mr. Emanuel. I'd like you to
[27:27] open a variety store here for me, David.
[27:29] I'll send along some helpers for you and
[27:31] make sure you never run out of stock.
[27:33] It's not always going to be easy, but
[27:35] I'll be with you always. Yes, sir. I'd
[27:37] be happy to serve you here.
[27:47] [Music]
[28:51] heartache.
[28:55] broken
[28:59] pieces ruin when
[29:02] land are wide. You died on
[29:10] Calary. Your
[29:14] touch is what I long for.
[29:20] You have
[29:23] given life to
[29:29] me. God will serve
[29:34] me because I love
[29:39] thee. You have
[29:43] gi life to me.
[29:50] I was
[29:53] [Music]
[29:54] nothing until you found
[29:59] me. You have
[30:03] given life to me.
[30:11] I was
[30:14] nothing until you found me.
[30:21] You have
[30:24] given life to
[30:46] me. What do you think, Mr. Emanuel,
[30:49] you've done well, David. Now feed my
[31:03] sheep. Come in all those who are weary
[31:06] and heavy laden. Come buy me gold tried
[31:08] in the fire, white white raignment that
[31:10] you may be clothed and that you may see.
[31:13] Everyone that thirsts, come ye to the
[31:15] waters. and eat. He that hath no money,
[31:18] come ye, buy and eat. Yay, come by wine
[31:21] and milk without money and without
[31:23] price. We have crowns of beauty, oil of
[31:26] joy, garments of praise. There's balming
[31:29] Gilead, honey from the rock, the sweet
[31:31] fruit of the spirit, the bread of life,
[31:33] and so much more. Welcome
[31:37] everyone. How can I help you today?
[31:49] Sorry. From the angel of the covenant.
[31:52] Oh, I tell you, Christians don't realize
[31:55] the privilege that we have. It's like
[31:56] we're going down here to a big arcade or
[31:59] going to a great big variety store. And
[32:01] you go into the variety store and you
[32:03] look over here. Here's some here. You
[32:05] like that? Now, when I get into a
[32:08] variety store, I like to look around a
[32:10] little. Don't you all? Especially if it
[32:12] was mine. And I see something up high.
[32:14] I'll get me a ladder and I'll go climb
[32:16] up, look at it, investigate it, see what
[32:19] it looks like. That's the way it is in
[32:21] Christ Jesus. By one spirit, we're all
[32:23] baptized into God's big variety store,
[32:26] Jesus Christ, wherever we have peace,
[32:28] joy, happiness, longsuffering, goodness,
[32:32] gentleness, meekness, Holy Ghost, powers
[32:34] of God, speak with tongues,
[32:36] interpretation of tongues, divine
[32:38] healing, glory, shouts, and wisdom.
[32:41] Hallelujah. All these things are ours to
[32:43] every believer. It belongs to you.
[32:53] [Music]
[33:28] I like
[33:30] [Music]
[33:42] Come by here, my
[33:47] Lord. Come by here.

[35:01] Lord come.
[35:13] [Music]
[36:04] Excuse me, Pastor David. I've been
[36:06] struggling with fear. It's overwhelming
[36:09] and I rightly don't know what to do.
[36:12] Fear is a powerful force, but it doesn't
[36:14] have to control you. God's word says,
[36:17] "For God has not given us a spirit of
[36:18] fear, but of power and of love and of a
[36:21] sound mind." Let me introduce you to
[36:23] someone.
[36:29] Hello, Olivia. God's promises are true.
[36:32] You don't have to be afraid. Trust in
[36:34] the Lord with all your heart and lean
[36:36] not on your own understanding.
[36:41] I want to trust him, but it's just so
[36:43] hard.
[36:49] Ha! You think you can just trust and
[36:52] make me disappear? I've been with you
[36:54] far too long, Olivia. The Lord is my
[36:56] light and my salvation. Whom shall I
[36:58] fear? The Lord is a stronghold of my
[37:00] life. Of whom shall I be afraid? Fear
[37:03] thrives in your doubt, but God's
[37:04] promises are stronger. Be strong and
[37:07] courageous. Do not be afraid or
[37:08] terrified because of them. For the Lord
[37:10] your God goes with you. He will never
[37:12] leave you nor forsake you. I choose to
[37:16] trust Jesus.
[37:21] Thank you, Pastor David. I feel ladder.
[37:26] The truth will set you free, Olivia.
[37:28] Hold on to his promises.
[37:38] [Music]
[37:54] You have covered
[37:57] me with a melody.
[38:01] Ready. You surround me
[38:05] with a
[38:09] song of
[38:11] [Music]
[38:13] deliverance from my
[38:15] [Music]
[38:17] eneies. Till all my
[38:21] fears have
[38:25] gone. I'm no
[38:27] longer a slave. save to
[38:33] fear. I am a child of
[38:40] God. I no
[38:43] longer a slave to
[38:46] [Music]
[38:49] fear. I am a
[38:52] child of God.
[38:55] [Music]
[39:12] Pastor David, do you think I'm doing a
[39:15] good job? I mean, I try, but sometimes I
[39:19] worry I'm not hopeful enough. You're
[39:22] doing great, Andy. God has equipped you
[39:23] with everything you need. Just keep
[39:25] trusting him.
[39:28] Thanks, pastor. Uh, what do you think
[39:31] about my new haircut? Is it too short?
[39:35] Is it too long? I probably should just
[39:40] wear a wig, you know. Do you think I
[39:42] should wear a wig?
[39:45] It looks fine, Andy. Nel's keep helping
[39:47] those who come through that door. Thank
[39:49] you, pastor.
[40:02] from faith by experience. Now, faith is
[40:05] a substance. It's like this. What if you
[40:08] found me somewhere starving to death and
[40:10] I told you I was hungry and one loaf of
[40:12] bread would save my life and you would
[40:14] reach into your pocket and give me 25
[40:16] cents and say, "Here, brother Brandham,
[40:18] you don't have to starve. I'll give you
[40:20] 25 cents to get a loaf of bread." Now,
[40:23] I'd be just as happy with the 25 cents
[40:25] as I'd be if I had the bread. Why?
[40:28] Because I've got the purchase power of
[40:30] the loaf of bread in my possession. Now,
[40:32] I cannot eat the 25 cents, but the 25
[40:35] cents will buy the
[40:37] bread. And now, faith is the 25 cents.
[40:40] If you've got the faith in your heart,
[40:42] you're just as happy with the faith that
[40:43] your crippled hand will move as you
[40:45] would be if you were moving it. Because
[40:48] faith is the purchasing power of your
[40:49] healing. Now, maybe with the 25 cents,
[40:52] I'd be just as hungry as I was before I
[40:54] received the 25 cents. And I might have
[40:57] to go several miles before I could get
[40:58] the loaf of bread. I might have to go
[41:00] through the brier patch, up the
[41:02] mountains, cross over the bridge, wait
[41:04] through the water. But all the time I'm
[41:06] going, I'm rejoicing because I've got
[41:08] the purchasing power of that loaf of
[41:09] bread.
[41:19] [Music]
[42:09] All I have to do is stop.
[42:13] [Music]
[42:19] All
[42:20] [Music]
[42:23] afternoon strength for
[42:29] today for
[42:32] tomorrow. My
[42:39] go is
[42:42] follow my know.
[42:49] [Music]
[42:58] All I have to do is
[43:02] fall for
[43:06] today. And all I need for
[43:11] [Music]
[43:15] tomorrow is all I have to do
[43:20] is love.
[43:22] [Music]
[43:24] [Applause]
[43:32] [Music]
[43:46] What are you doing for brother?
[43:51] [Music]
[44:08] Pastor David, I've been holding on to a
[44:11] promise from God for so long, but my
[44:13] faith is weakening. I don't know if I
[44:15] could keep believing.
[44:17] Let us not go or we worry while doing
[44:19] good. For in due season we shall reap if
[44:21] we do not lose heart. God's timing is
[44:23] perfect. Mark, don't give up.
[44:30] You're wasting your time,
[44:33] Mark.
[44:41] Look. Why do you keep believing? Maybe
[44:44] the promise isn't for you. Maybe God has
[44:46] forgotten you. What if? What if it's not
[44:49] meant to be?
[44:51] [Music]
[44:56] Now, faith is the substance of things
[44:58] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[45:00] seen. God's promises are yes and amen.
[45:03] Don't let unbelief steal your hope.
[45:06] You are wasting your time, Mark. Look
[45:09] around. Where's the fulfillment of a
[45:11] so-called promise? For we walk by faith,
[45:14] not by sight. Mark, remember that God's
[45:17] word does not return void. His promises
[45:19] will come to pass in his perfect time.
[45:22] You're a fool to keep waiting. I I want
[45:25] to believe. I do, but it's just so hard
[45:27] to wait. But those who wait on the Lord
[45:30] shall renew their strength. They shall
[45:32] mount up with wings like eagles. They
[45:34] shall run and not be weary. And they
[45:36] shall walk and not faint. God is
[45:39] faithful. Mark, don't lose heart.
[45:42] I will wait on the Lord.
[45:45] I will wait for the Lord. My soul waits
[45:48] and in his word I do hope.
[45:51] [Music]
[45:54] Thank you, Pastor David. Thank you,
[45:55] Faith. I won't give up. I'll keep
[45:58] trusting in God. Hold fast your
[46:00] confession mark. God is with you.
[46:06] [Music]
[46:18] I can
[46:21] hear my
[46:24] savior
[46:27] calling. I can
[46:30] hear my
[46:34] savior calling.
[46:38] I can
[46:40] hear my
[46:42] [Music]
[46:44] Savior
[46:47] calling. Take thy cross
[46:51] now.
[46:53] Follow,
[46:56] follow
[46:59] me where he
[47:03] leads me up. I will
[47:09] follow where he
[47:12] leads me.
[47:15] I will
[47:19] follow where he
[47:22] leads me.
[47:25] I will follow.
[47:30] All the
[47:36] wind
[47:38] all the
[47:43] [Music]
[47:51] way from the unconditional covenant that
[47:54] God made with his people. Then God
[47:57] appeared to Abraham. He said, "Come out
[47:59] and look around now. See what you own.
[48:01] Amen. Oh, I like that. Come out and look
[48:03] it over. Walk from the east to the west.
[48:05] It's all yours. You took your way with
[48:07] the Lord's despised few. Now you're heir
[48:09] of all of it. Amen. It all belongs to
[48:12] you now, Abraham. I give it to you
[48:14] unconditionally. You don't deserve it,
[48:16] but I give it to you anyhow. Amen. Oh, I
[48:19] don't deserve this, but he gave it to me
[48:20] anyhow. So, I'm going to walk east,
[48:22] north, west, and south, and see what I
[48:24] own in the kingdom of God. All things
[48:27] are mine. Amen. Let's get up and walk
[48:29] around. See how it looks. My, it feels
[48:32] good. Take God by faith.
[49:19] [Music]
[49:41] Oh, that rug
[49:44] cross, the selfless pain he
[49:50] bore. He breathed his final
[49:55] breath that I would
[50:00] be by his body that was
[50:06] broken. Precious blood freely shed.
[50:12] The spotless lamb of
[50:16] heaven has for ever conered
[50:25] death. Jesus is my
[50:30] healer. He is
[50:32] everything I need.
[50:36] He alone has
[50:40] triumphed over sickness and
[50:46] disease. Fear, where is your
[50:51] power? The cross is your
[50:56] defeat. Jesus is my healer.
[51:02] He has won the victory.
[51:26] Oh, how great a
[51:29] love I'm helping perfect peace.
[51:35] For he walks with me through
[51:40] valleyies, understands my
[51:44] suffering. Every joy and every
[51:50] sorrow, every
[51:52] triumph, every
[51:55] loss, I know
[51:57] everything is
[52:00] covered by the shadow of the cross.
[52:06] I know
[52:08] everything is covered by the shadow of
[52:14] the
[52:20] cross. Jesus is my
[52:24] healer. He's
[52:27] everything I need.
[52:31] He alone has
[52:34] triumphed over sickness and
[52:40] disease and fear. Where is your
[52:45] power? The cross is your
[52:50] defeat. Jesus is my healer.
[52:56] He has won the
[52:59] victory. Oh Jesus is my
[53:05] healer. He has won the
[53:15] victory. Everything bows at his
[53:20] name. Everything bows at his name.
[53:27] Sickness, darkness, chains break at the
[53:32] name of
[53:36] Jesus. Everything bows at his
[53:41] name. Everything bows at his name.
[53:48] Sickness, darkness, chains break at the
[53:53] name of
[53:57] Jesus. Oh, everything bows at his
[54:02] name. Everything bows at his
[54:07] name. Sickness, darkness, chains that
[54:12] break at the name.
[54:15] The name of
[54:18] Jesus. Everything bows at his
[54:23] name. Everything bows at his
[54:28] name. Sickness, darkness, chains, break
[54:33] at the
[54:35] name, the name of Jesus.
[54:43] Jesus is my
[54:46] healer. He's
[54:49] everything I
[54:52] need. And he alone has
[54:56] triumphed over sickness and
[55:01] disease. So fear, where is your
[55:06] power? The cross is yours to defeat.
[55:14] Jesus is my
[55:17] healer. He has won the
[55:23] victory. Jesus is my
[55:27] healer. He has won the victory.

[56:16] Pastor was just working in my barn just
[56:20] singing and praising the Lord as as I
[56:22] worked and God's
[56:24] prot and and praise the Lord I'm healed.
[56:29] Glory to God. That's wonderful, Mark.
[56:32] Thank the Lord. Would you like to give a
[56:34] testimony at our prayer meeting
[56:35] tomorrow? Oh, yes. I'd be happy to do
[56:38] that, pastor. It's a long time coming.
[56:41] I've walked through many valleys, as you
[56:43] know, but God has kept his word and been
[56:45] with me all the
[56:50] way. I just had to come and tell the
[56:52] good news.
[56:55] I better get back now. I left in such a
[56:58] hurry. I didn't tell Martha. Goodbye,
[57:00] pastor. Thank you. See you tomorrow.
[58:35] I would love to tell you what I think of
[58:42] Jesus since I found in him a friend so
[58:48] strong and
[58:52] True. I would tell you how he changed my
[58:57] life
[59:00] completely. He did something that no
[59:04] other
[59:05] friend could
[59:10] do. No one ever cared for
[59:15] me like Jesus.
[59:20] There's no other friend so
[59:24] kind as
[59:27] he. No one else could take the sin and
[59:33] darkness from
[59:37] me. Oh, how much he cares for me.
[59:46] Oh my life was full of sin when Jesus
[59:50] found
[59:53] me. All my heart was full of
[59:57] misery and
[1:00:00] w. Jesus placed his strong and loving
[1:00:05] arms around
[1:00:09] me and he led me in the way I ought to
[1:00:15] go.
[1:00:16] Thank you,
[1:00:18] Lord. No one ever cared for
[1:00:23] me like Jesus.
[1:00:28] There's no other friend so
[1:00:32] kind as
[1:00:36] he. No one else could take the sin and
[1:00:41] darkness from me.
[1:00:47] Oh, how much he cares for
[1:00:54] me. Every day he comes to me with new
[1:01:02] assurance. More and more I
[1:01:06] understand his words of love.
[1:01:12] But I'll never know just why he came to
[1:01:17] save
[1:01:19] me. Till someday I see his blessed face
[1:01:29] above. No one ever cared for
[1:01:35] me like Jesus.
[1:01:42] No other friend so
[1:01:45] kind as
[1:01:48] he. No one else could take the sin
[1:01:54] darkness from
[1:01:59] me. Oh, how much he
[1:02:03] cares for
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:35] Pastor David,
[1:02:38] I've been struggling. I walked away from
[1:02:40] this place years ago, thinking all of
[1:02:43] this was a waste of time. But I was
[1:02:45] wrong. Come to me all you who labor and
[1:02:48] are laden. And I will give you rest.
[1:02:50] It's never too late to return. Judy,
[1:02:52] I've been so bitter, angry at God, angry
[1:02:55] at you. It's been eating me up inside. I
[1:02:58] don't want to live like this no more,
[1:03:00] pastor.
[1:03:01] [Music]
[1:03:09] There ain't no fear in love, but perfect
[1:03:11] love cast out fear. God's love can heal
[1:03:14] your heart, Judy. Will you let him in? I
[1:03:17] don't deserve it, but I want to come
[1:03:18] back. I want to be free.
[1:03:21] If we confess our sins, he is faithful
[1:03:23] and just to forgive us our sins and to
[1:03:25] cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[1:03:27] God's grace is greater than your past,
[1:03:29] Judy.
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:46] I
[1:03:48] need his
[1:03:51] cleansing blood.
[1:03:54] I
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:57] know
[1:03:58] now I'm
[1:04:02] coming
[1:04:06] home. Oh,
[1:04:08] wash me
[1:04:12] wer
[1:04:14] than the snow.
[1:04:16] [Music]
[1:04:19] Lord, I'm
[1:04:22] coming
[1:04:31] home. I'm
[1:04:34] coming home.
[1:04:39] Never
[1:04:41] more
[1:04:47] to
[1:04:49] open
[1:04:51] wide. I
[1:04:54] armed the
[1:04:57] Lord.
[1:04:59] Lord, I'm
[1:05:02] coming home.
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:14] Thank you, pastor. I feel free.
[1:05:18] Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is
[1:05:20] a new creation. Old things are passed
[1:05:22] away. Behold, all things have become
[1:05:25] new. Welcome back, Judy.
[1:05:38] from Abraham and deceited after him. Do
[1:05:41] you see it? Don't look yourself. Look at
[1:05:43] your sacrifice. God doesn't look at you.
[1:05:46] He looks your sacrifice, which is
[1:05:48] Christ. Don't look at yourself. I'm not
[1:05:50] worthy. You're not worthy. Nobody's
[1:05:52] worthy. But he is the one. I'm not
[1:05:55] counting on what I've done, what I am,
[1:05:57] or I'll never make it. But I'm looking
[1:05:59] at what he's done. That's where I'm
[1:06:01] trusting what he's done. He's my
[1:06:03] sacrifice. I'm not worthy of healing. No
[1:06:05] sir, Lord. I ought to have died long
[1:06:07] ago. Never even been born. But I live. I
[1:06:11] got eternal life. I'm going to heaven.
[1:06:13] Why? Because he's because he's done it
[1:06:15] for me. He was the one. He took my
[1:06:18] place. So he makes me a perfect son of
[1:06:20] God, perfect daughter of God. His
[1:06:22] sacrifice did it, not mine. I had
[1:06:25] nothing to do with it. I was born all
[1:06:27] out of shape anyhow. But I tr But I
[1:06:29] don't trust in what I've done. I trust
[1:06:31] in what he's done. See what he was.
[1:06:34] That's what did it.
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:38] Amazing love that always was has ransom.
[1:07:44] on this heart of
[1:07:50] mine. The light of the whole
[1:07:55] universe gave his life so I could
[1:08:01] shine. I said,
[1:08:04] "Lord, I'm not
[1:08:07] worthy that you should die for me.
[1:08:14] He said,
[1:08:16] "Child, don't you
[1:08:19] wory. I formed your
[1:08:26] destiny. You are
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:30] blameless.
[1:08:33] Blameless. For I have paid the price."
[1:08:44] Shameless,
[1:08:47] inocent, filled with the life I
[1:08:53] gave.
[1:08:55] Me thought he had you bound, but the
[1:09:03] evidence was never
[1:09:06] found. You are beautiful.
[1:09:10] [Music]
[1:09:14] and blame
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:27] blessing love with his own
[1:09:31] blood has washed my sins away.
[1:09:40] The perfect lamb was
[1:09:44] crucified that I might stand
[1:09:49] justified. I said,
[1:09:53] "Lord, I'm not
[1:09:56] worthy that you should die for me."
[1:10:03] He said, "My
[1:10:05] child, can't you
[1:10:09] see? You are a part of
[1:10:15] me. And you are
[1:10:19] blameless,
[1:10:22] blameless, for I have
[1:10:26] faith Christ.
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:32] Shameless,
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:35] innocent, filled with the life I
[1:10:41] gave. Never thought he had you bound,
[1:10:47] but the
[1:10:49] evidence was never
[1:10:52] found. You are beautiful.
[1:11:00] and
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:05] blameless.
[1:11:07] Accusers rise on every side and demand
[1:11:14] justice be served.
[1:11:18] But the mighty judge with his own blood
[1:11:24] has
[1:11:26] sovereignly
[1:11:30] declared. You are
[1:11:34] blameless.
[1:11:37] Blameless for I have paid the price.
[1:11:47] Shameless,
[1:11:48] [Music]
[1:11:50] inocent, filled with the life I
[1:11:56] gave. Meyer thought he had you bound,
[1:12:02] but the
[1:12:04] abotence was never
[1:12:07] found. You are beautiful.
[1:12:15] and blameless.
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:13:09] I want
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:43] I
[1:13:46] believe I believe God.
[1:13:49] I believe God. It shall be done
[1:13:55] even trust and
[1:14:01] oy. I believe God.
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:19] Hey.
[1:14:22] [Music]
[1:14:47] Oh my god.
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:15:53] Enough variety
[1:15:57] Lord, get away,
[1:16:05] boy. I'll tear this door out my bare
[1:16:21] hand. Burns.
[1:16:25] I've had enough of this hogwash you call
[1:16:30] hope. You and this store and that you
[1:16:34] make there are ruining everything.
[1:16:37] Satan, you're not welcome here. This
[1:16:40] door is belongs to the Lord Jesus
[1:16:41] Christ. And you have no power here. I
[1:16:44] don't need your permission to be
[1:16:46] anywhere. Do you really think that those
[1:16:48] promises there could stop me? Do you
[1:16:51] really think your little God's words
[1:16:53] could undo the power I have over every
[1:16:56] one of these people? The power you have
[1:16:58] is nothing good compared to the power of
[1:17:00] God. His promises are true and his word
[1:17:02] is a sword that cuts through all your
[1:17:04] lies. Lies. Look around you, boy. This
[1:17:09] whole world is full of suffering and
[1:17:11] pain and
[1:17:13] despair. I have more power than you
[1:17:16] could ever imagine. Yet you think a few
[1:17:19] little words can make a difference. It's
[1:17:21] not just words, Satan. It's the truth.
[1:17:24] And the truth sets people free. The
[1:17:26] power of God's promises is in his love,
[1:17:28] his grace, and his faithfulness. Your
[1:17:31] power is built on fear and deception.
[1:17:33] But it crumbles in the face of God's
[1:17:34] light. But I've already claimed so many
[1:17:38] lives. I fill them with Well, let's see.
[1:17:41] Yes. I fill them with doubt and sickness
[1:17:44] of every kind and and despair.
[1:17:48] What I'm trying to say, boy, if you can
[1:17:51] follow
[1:17:52] me, these people, they belong to me. You
[1:17:58] may have them for a moment, but they
[1:18:00] belong to God for eternity. And he is
[1:18:02] calling them back to himself one by one.
[1:18:05] Right? The Lord is not slow in keeping
[1:18:07] his promises as some understand Sonus.
[1:18:09] Instead, he's patient with you, not
[1:18:11] wanting anyone to perish, but everyone
[1:18:13] to come to repentance. are
[1:18:17] lonely. You have said your peace, boy.
[1:18:20] Now I wish mine. I'll make them forget
[1:18:24] every last promise of your little god.
[1:18:27] I'll drain them of every last drop of
[1:18:29] hope. I'll bring them to their knees,
[1:18:32] begging for a mercy that'll never come
[1:18:34] until their breath slips from their
[1:18:36] sorry frame and their bones rot in a
[1:18:39] desert far from the reaches of mortal
[1:18:41] kin.
[1:18:43] Submit yourselves then to God. Resist
[1:18:45] the devil and he will flee from you.
[1:18:47] Right? You have no authority here,
[1:18:48] Satan. I do. The store is a place of
[1:18:50] God's light and you cannot extinguish
[1:18:52] it.
[1:18:57] Who are you?
[1:18:59] The joy of the Lord is your strength.
[1:19:01] Satan, you can't stand against the power
[1:19:04] of God's promises. These people are
[1:19:07] weak. They doubt. They fear. Come on. M
[1:19:12] for this purpose the son of God was
[1:19:14] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:19:16] works of the devil. Your lies have been
[1:19:18] exposed. Satan Jesus has already won the
[1:19:21] victory of Calvary.
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:30] For I walk by faith and not by sight.
[1:19:33] God's people are stronger than you
[1:19:34] think, Satan. Their faith in God's word
[1:19:36] is steadfast.
[1:19:39] Right.
[1:19:40] joy and peace and believing that you may
[1:19:42] abound in the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:46] Now, there is no fear in love, but
[1:19:50] perfect love cast out fear. God love
[1:19:52] drives out your target, Satan. You are
[1:19:55] defeated. Get out.
[1:19:57] [Music]
[1:19:59] Hear me now. This isn't over, pastor.
[1:20:03] I'll find a way back into their lives. I
[1:20:06] always do. For the light stands the
[1:20:08] darkness and the darkness has not
[1:20:09] overcome it. You may try but God's light
[1:20:12] will always prevail and so will his
[1:20:14] promises. No they
[1:20:17] won't. Oh no. Oh no no
[1:20:21] [Music]
[1:20:26] no. Not him
[1:20:28] again. And they overcame him by the
[1:20:30] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:20:32] their testimony. Satan, you're done
[1:20:35] here. The blood of Jesus has already
[1:20:37] sealed your fate.
[1:20:41] What are you going to do?
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:52] [Music]
[1:20:54] The spirit of the Lord is upon me
[1:20:56] because he has anointed me to preach the
[1:20:58] gospel to the poor. He has sent me to
[1:21:00] heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim to
[1:21:02] proclaim liberty to the captives and
[1:21:04] recovery of sight to the blind, to set
[1:21:06] at liberty those who are oppressed. Keep
[1:21:08] up the good work, Pastor David. The
[1:21:10] harvest is great and the laborers are
[1:21:12] few.
[1:21:18] Can't believe I forgot my
[1:21:22] David. Did you see that? Satan didn't
[1:21:24] even stand a chance. That's right, Andy.
[1:21:27] Jesus already won the victory. We just
[1:21:29] need to stand firm in his promises.
[1:21:33] I know I wasn't in the battle, but I was
[1:21:36] praying really, really
[1:21:39] hard. I wasn't praying on my knees.
[1:21:44] Should I have been praying on my knees?
[1:21:46] Please tell me if I messed up, pastor.
[1:21:48] You did great, Andy. Prayer is powerful
[1:21:50] and your support means everything. Now,
[1:21:52] let's keep this door open for those who
[1:21:54] need
[1:21:58] it. Remember, Jesus paid it all at
[1:22:01] Calvary. His love is unmmerited and
[1:22:03] unconditional, for he met God's
[1:22:05] requirements as the lamb of God. God's
[1:22:08] promises and grace are unlimited. We
[1:22:10] only need to believe and have the faith
[1:22:11] and patience of Abraham. Keep holding on
[1:22:14] to his promises. No matter what, God

[1:31:10] greatest love of story.
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:32:00] Amen. Wasn't that wonderful? Amen. I
[1:32:03] love the progression there of taking
[1:32:05] some notes as we went through and
[1:32:07] started with he came to
[1:32:08] me. You know, scripture says, "No man
[1:32:11] has sought God." He says, "He seeks us
[1:32:13] and then we seek him." It's his call
[1:32:15] that brings us to him. And you notice
[1:32:17] that when they were portraying the
[1:32:18] different ones. He didn't go for the
[1:32:20] strong. He didn't go for the powerful.
[1:32:22] He didn't go for the faithful. He didn't
[1:32:24] go for the smart. He went for the weak.
[1:32:26] He went for the broken. He went for the
[1:32:28] the horrible.
[1:32:30] those that were just couldn't they just
[1:32:32] couldn't get out of their own way.
[1:32:34] That's the ones that he came to. You
[1:32:35] know, Paul the Apostle, he said, "I'm
[1:32:37] the chiefest of sinners." And that's the
[1:32:39] one that God picked to lead that first
[1:32:41] church age to to bring the majority of
[1:32:42] the New Testament was a man that had
[1:32:44] persecuted Christ himself. So, it's not
[1:32:47] based on what we do. Everything that we
[1:32:50] have here today as believers is because
[1:32:51] of what he's done. Amen. And that's what
[1:32:54] we're celebrating this weekend is what
[1:32:55] he did. And what he did paved the way
[1:32:58] for his spirit to come back so he could
[1:33:00] do it all over again through you and I.
[1:33:02] Because he said, "The works that I do,
[1:33:03] you shall do also." And we heard here,
[1:33:05] he said that the works of Christ is to
[1:33:07] destroy the works of the devil. And
[1:33:10] that's what he's doing here today is
[1:33:12] he's destroying the works of the devil
[1:33:13] in your lives. He's bringing us out of a
[1:33:15] life of sin. He's bringing us out of a
[1:33:17] life of self. He's bringing us out a
[1:33:18] life of fear and despondency and despair
[1:33:21] and all these things that this world has
[1:33:23] built up because Satan is the the god of
[1:33:26] this evil age. But he has a bride that
[1:33:28] he has prepared. He's got a bride that
[1:33:30] he has called. And he's got a bride that
[1:33:32] he's working in by the power of his Holy
[1:33:34] Spirit to have an overcomer in this age.
[1:33:36] Amen. That's what this is about. It's
[1:33:38] not us. It's Christ in me, the hope of
[1:33:41] glory that finishes his works and take
[1:33:43] us takes us all the way into eternity.
[1:33:45] Amen. God bless you, Sister Priscilla.
[1:33:47] Everyone that helped. I'm in the back
[1:33:49] watching the whole time and I see what
[1:33:51] Brother Matt's back there doing with the
[1:33:52] helpers on the audio visual and the
[1:33:54] running back and forth and checking and
[1:33:56] fixing. I say God bless you. What a
[1:33:58] tremendous, tremendous job. I think we
[1:34:00] should give them all a hand.
[1:34:01] [Applause]
[1:34:09] Amen. May maybe we'll do a matinea
[1:34:12] tomorrow again.
[1:34:14] probably not. We're just going to sing
[1:34:16] one more song and then we're going to
[1:34:18] have a word of prayer and we've got some
[1:34:20] refreshments out in the in the
[1:34:21] fellowship hall. If you just go out to
[1:34:23] the sanctuary, turn right, you can go in
[1:34:24] there. You're welcome to stay. We'd love
[1:34:26] to have anyone stay and talk and just
[1:34:28] meet the meet the cast and shake their
[1:34:30] hands, get their signatures maybe, and
[1:34:32] uh and just enjoy some food afterwards
[1:34:34] and some fellowship. So, we're going to
[1:34:35] sing this song, Oh, How He Loves You and
[1:34:38] Me, and then we'll pray. If we just
[1:34:40] stand
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:44] together. Oh, how he loves you and
[1:34:54] me. Oh, how he loves you and
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:04] me. He gave his life.
[1:35:09] What more could he
[1:35:14] give? Oh, how he loves
[1:35:20] you. Oh, how he loves
[1:35:25] me. Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:35:36] Jesus to
[1:35:38] Calary did
[1:35:44] go his love for
[1:35:48] sinners to
[1:35:53] show. And what he did
[1:35:57] there brought hope from despair.
[1:36:04] Oh, how he loves
[1:36:07] [Music]
[1:36:12] you. He loves you and
[1:36:18] me. Amen. Let's bow our heads, Lord
[1:36:22] Jesus. Lord, how thankful we are, Lord,
[1:36:25] that we don't have to worry, that we
[1:36:28] don't have to fear, Lord, when the
[1:36:29] trials of this life come against us.
[1:36:32] Lord, you've given us a spirit that
[1:36:34] conquers all fear. Lord, it's a spirit
[1:36:36] of love and of a sound mind. Lord, of
[1:36:39] faith in your word. And Lord, we're
[1:36:41] walking by faith tonight. We're trusting
[1:36:43] in your word, Lord. We're not trusting
[1:36:45] our feelings. We're not trusting what we
[1:36:47] can see. We're not trusting the evidence
[1:36:49] around us, Lord, but we're declaring by
[1:36:51] your word those things that which are
[1:36:53] not, it seems, as if they are. Lord, I
[1:36:56] pray you help us to trust in the
[1:36:57] finished work of Calvary. Lord, that
[1:36:59] when you sent your spirit back, you sent
[1:37:01] it to finish that work in our lives,
[1:37:03] Lord Jesus. Lord, we're thankful for the
[1:37:05] sacrifice that you paid. Lord, we're
[1:37:07] thankful for the blood that covers us,
[1:37:09] Lord, that the we've taken on your
[1:37:11] righteousness as you took away our sin,
[1:37:13] Lord. And we stand before you as we
[1:37:14] heard tonight, blameless, Lord. Sinless,
[1:37:18] spotless, Lord. You start a work, you
[1:37:20] always finish it, Lord. And we're
[1:37:22] trusting you to take us all the way
[1:37:24] through to the end, Lord. You see every
[1:37:26] heart here. You see every life, Lord.
[1:37:28] You see the needs that we have everyone.
[1:37:31] Lord, we ask that your spirit would move
[1:37:32] by your word, Lord, to heal us, to
[1:37:35] cleanse us, to sanctify us, Lord, to
[1:37:37] deliver us, Lord, to draw us to you, to
[1:37:39] save us to the uttermost, each one we
[1:37:42] pray. Lord, thank you for this group.
[1:37:44] Thank you for this people, Lord, that so
[1:37:46] faithfully put their effort forward for
[1:37:48] your glory and for your honor. Lord, I
[1:37:50] pray you bless us now. Bless these
[1:37:52] refreshments that we eat, our
[1:37:53] fellowship, and time together. for each
[1:37:55] one. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:37:58] ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
