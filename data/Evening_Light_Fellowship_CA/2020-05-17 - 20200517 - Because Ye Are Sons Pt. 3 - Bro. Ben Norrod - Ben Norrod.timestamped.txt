[54:52] amen but that's that's all right but
[54:54] anyhow now we're gonna look here Joshua
[54:56] chapter one and one down to verse 6 now
[54:58] I I want to take for a subject this
[55:01] morning we've been speaking the last
[55:02] couple days on because your sons and and
[55:07] I've thrown a lot of little titles and
[55:09] thoughts and things out there to you but
[55:10] I want to keep with the same theme this
[55:13] morning so for the recording this
[55:15] morning from brother Matt in them that
[55:18] is this would be because you are sons
[55:21] again this morning but I want to take
[55:23] kindly for a subject and and and I want
[55:25] to look at no shortcuts to adoption no
[55:29] shortcuts to adoption and what we're
[55:31] going to look at and as we've been
[55:32] studying this weekend about adoption and
[55:34] what it means to be an adopted son of
[55:37] God remember daughters that includes you
[55:39] as well and and what it means to be an
[55:42] adopted son we saw last night that when
[55:45] the inspector is looking for something
[55:47] in order to inspect or looking at
[55:49] something in our lives he's not looking
[55:52] for great miraculous power he's not
[55:54] looking for some supernatural output
[55:56] some supernatural workup and all that
[55:59] comes with the Christian life of course
[56:01] but what we have to understand is that
[56:03] the inspector God himself is looking for
[56:06] he's looking for the character of Jesus
[56:09] Christ and that doesn't always have
[56:12] maybe a display to the whole world it's
[56:15] just maybe your spirit of influence your
[56:17] school your work or wherever you might
[56:18] be your family but we want to look at
[56:21] this adoption part what I want to do
[56:22] this morning I want to take the children
[56:24] of Israel as a pattern for what we want
[56:26] to try to talk about for a little while
[56:27] alright verse 1 now after the
[56:29] of Moses the servant of the Lord it came
[56:31] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[56:34] the son of nun Moses ministers saying
[56:38] Moses my servant is dead now and just to
[56:42] bring this in right quickly you you
[56:43] understand this was probably a difficult
[56:45] thing for these people to really
[56:48] comprehend and no doubt the man that had
[56:51] brought them out of Egypt now if you can
[56:52] picture in your mind being slaves and in
[56:56] servitude and now this great prophet of
[56:58] God has wrought miracles left and right
[57:01] there's been all kinds of great things
[57:02] done plagues and everything has fallen
[57:04] he's taking you through 40 years of this
[57:06] wilderness and now they they punctuate
[57:10] this man's life by letting the people
[57:11] know Moses my servant is dead now that's
[57:15] that's quite a remark and they knew the
[57:19] potentials that lay within the Ministry
[57:22] of this prophet now but what's the
[57:24] command of God did not stop at Moses
[57:28] death just the same as it didn't stop
[57:30] with brother branham's death there was a
[57:31] greater purpose that the message brought
[57:33] after Moses left us after brother
[57:35] Branham left us there's a greater
[57:37] purpose there here's the purpose now
[57:39] therefore arise go now that's the
[57:43] message today if you want to talk about
[57:45] what is the opening of the seals what is
[57:47] the message of the hour what is the
[57:48] evening light that's the message to you
[57:50] and I now arise and go go over this
[57:54] Jordan Dow and all this people under the
[57:56] land which I do give them and even to
[57:59] the children of Israel every place that
[58:02] the sole of your foot shall tread upon
[58:05] that have I given unto you as I said to
[58:08] Moses for the wilderness and this
[58:10] Lebanon even unto the great river the
[58:12] river Euphrates all the land of the
[58:14] Hittites and under the Great Sea toward
[58:16] their going down at the Sun shall be
[58:18] your coast there should not be any man
[58:20] able to stand before the all the days of
[58:23] thy life as I was with Moses so I will
[58:27] be with thee I will not fail thee nor
[58:31] forsake thee be strong and of good
[58:33] courage for unto this people shout thou
[58:36] divided for inheritance to the land
[58:39] which I swear unto their fathers to give
[58:41] them now of course
[58:41] Lord speaking to Joshua and these words
[58:43] and these verses but now once this
[58:45] message is communicated to the children
[58:47] of Israel you imagine what they must
[58:49] have thought they had no experience with
[58:51] Joshua
[58:51] they had no background with Joshua as
[58:53] far as him taking a stick in dividing
[58:56] waters and calling plagues down and
[58:58] getting in the face of Pharaoh and
[59:00] standing there and confronting Pharaoh
[59:02] they had no experience like this with
[59:04] Joshua
[59:05] so they imagined the people were
[59:07] probably a little you know kindly
[59:08] awkward maybe feeling about the whole
[59:10] situation and as it always is with the
[59:13] changing of a leader
[59:14] there's always an awkwardness there and
[59:16] and people of course brother brems said
[59:18] one time about natural shepherds he said
[59:20] how hard it was to train sheep to the
[59:22] voice of another Shepherd it's the same
[59:24] way in the spiritual as well but the
[59:26] changing of a guard or the changing of a
[59:28] leader it's quite difficult but God is
[59:31] telling Joshua you go do the work
[59:33] you take the ministry on and you take
[59:35] these people over and as I was with
[59:38] Moses I'll be with thee now once you
[59:40] notice something Joshua doesn't call
[59:43] down one plague Joshua doesn't challenge
[59:46] not one Pharaoh Joshua doesn't open not
[59:48] one Red Sea so in contrast to the
[59:52] Ministry of Moses what Joshua was gonna
[59:55] do is a whole lot smaller in a way just
[59:57] by the outside look of it then what we
[59:59] see out of Moses the death angel may
[1:00:02] pass through Egypt and and then the
[1:00:05] Passover is established and all these
[1:00:06] other things are happening now Joshua
[1:00:08] does great things no doubt he's a great
[1:00:10] warrior of God but in comparison visibly
[1:00:13] speaking to the things that God did with
[1:00:16] Moses it doesn't look as big coming to
[1:00:20] Joshua as it did with Moses when the
[1:00:22] angel of the Lord meets him there at the
[1:00:24] foot of Jericho and tells him to march
[1:00:26] around
[1:00:27] it's just Joshua and the Lord there and
[1:00:29] and many of the experiences that Joshua
[1:00:31] had the people simply had to trust that
[1:00:34] Joshua was being obedient to the Lord
[1:00:36] and that was a hard thing to do because
[1:00:38] the visibility of it wasn't as clear
[1:00:41] with Joshua perhaps as it was with Moses
[1:00:44] every time they looked at Moses he was
[1:00:46] up there on the mountain the pillar of
[1:00:47] fire was hanging on him his face was
[1:00:49] glowing with the glory of God and then
[1:00:51] they look at Joshua standing there with
[1:00:52] a sword in his hand
[1:00:54] no glory no no cloud no pillar of fire
[1:00:56] hanging over him he doesn't have a stick
[1:00:58] in his hand he's got a sword in his hand
[1:01:00] and now they're being asked to trust
[1:01:02] this man to do the same job as I was
[1:01:05] with Moses as I'll be with you so this
[1:01:08] was a difficult thing for these people
[1:01:10] but now remember as they are progressing
[1:01:13] in their maturity what you would say was
[1:01:16] visible is beginning to diminish a
[1:01:19] little bit more and God is beginning to
[1:01:21] focus upon the character of these people
[1:01:25] the position of these people
[1:01:27] all right let's pray over the word and
[1:01:29] I'll let you be seated father thank you
[1:01:30] for the reading of the word today Lord
[1:01:32] Jesus we know that as we read the Bible
[1:01:35] we know that the Holy Spirit is here
[1:01:37] right now this morning as we're gathered
[1:01:40] here in 2 and 3 to be able to take this
[1:01:42] word and break it to our heart so I ask
[1:01:44] you to do so father as you bless both
[1:01:46] speaker and listener and the remainder
[1:01:48] of this service and all that's been
[1:01:49] accomplished for that glory in the name
[1:01:51] of Jesus Christ and the church said amen
[1:01:54] and greetings to everybody online
[1:01:56] the invisible audience as well as the
[1:01:59] visible thank you to brother Gerald in

[1:02:29] part of the great program of God now you

[1:02:49] just a spot here from you must be borned

[1:02:53] kindly base my thought on just for a
[1:02:56] little bit and and brother branham is
[1:02:58] speaking about shortcuts in this if
[1:02:59] you'd like to look at this it's you must
[1:03:01] be born again
[1:03:02] it's paragraph 146 and 147 if you if you
[1:03:06] like to go back in

[1:03:19] if you need to or if you want to and and
[1:03:21] and and listen at some of the statements
[1:03:23] here from brother Branham but if you
[1:03:25] listen to this now brother bream starts
[1:03:26] out by saying shortcuts he said tonight
[1:03:28] they're out here today and they're going
[1:03:30] on and tomorrow they want to preach he
[1:03:32] said Pentecostal people letting him do
[1:03:34] that he said yeah they want a shortcut

[1:03:57] there's no shortcuts you come the way of
[1:04:00] Calvary you come the way of the brass
[1:04:02] altar you come the way of the brazen
[1:04:04] serpent you die you said you actually
[1:04:06] die oh god why can't I say it right
[1:04:08] you die literally die to yourself die to
[1:04:12] the things of the world and are born to
[1:04:14] do a man who says no world the things of
[1:04:16] the world is dead there's no shortcuts
[1:04:18] see they want to come right quick now
[1:04:20] watch this carefully they don't want to
[1:04:22] grow we grow in the Lord
[1:04:25] it takes growth and experience now think
[1:04:29] of that for just a moment it takes
[1:04:31] growth and experience people are told
[1:04:33] out on the west coast now oh we've got
[1:04:35] the immortal baptism we baptize you in
[1:04:37] water you turn back to a young man right
[1:04:39] here young woman yes sir they got
[1:04:41] Elijah's garments they've got manifested
[1:04:43] sons of God he said yes sir brother
[1:04:45] God's getting manifested sons right now
[1:04:49] manifested tell them all about this now
[1:04:52] watch what he says tonight you're a
[1:04:54] sinner and tomorrow you're a manifested
[1:04:56] son of God
[1:04:57] what do y'all reckon brother brems says
[1:04:59] to this maybe I could get it up here
[1:05:02] where you can see it I'll just let you
[1:05:03] see the word if you can if I can get my
[1:05:05] my picture in there can you see it
[1:05:09] nonsense he says nonsense today you're a
[1:05:13] son of God tomorrow you're a manifested
[1:05:15] son of God nonsense where did you get
[1:05:18] that in the word
[1:05:20] babies are not born men they're born
[1:05:24] babies and grow to men all right now you
[1:05:27] remember last night I was speaking to
[1:05:30] you a little while about what it would
[1:05:31] take to get us there remember I talked
[1:05:34] about the tree being planted by the
[1:05:35] rivers of water and we took David and
[1:05:37] how that David was anointed the King
[1:05:39] positionally placed the seed was placed
[1:05:42] by the rivers of water and all of that
[1:05:44] was established as it needed to be
[1:05:46] established but it took time to grow
[1:05:49] there now if we take our Bible and go to
[1:05:51] Galatians chapter five let's just I
[1:05:53] don't have it wrote down here but I want
[1:05:55] to just grab this verse for just a
[1:05:56] little bit because I think there's a
[1:05:58] beautiful thing in here that we could
[1:05:59] talk about for just a moment to kind of
[1:06:01] get kind of get the understanding of it
[1:06:05] down now Galatians chapter 5 let's just
[1:06:08] grab that right quick and then I want to
[1:06:10] look at some of these fruits of the
[1:06:12] spirit for just a moment and see and and
[1:06:16] and and just just I want to just add to
[1:06:18] your understanding a little bit about
[1:06:20] where these fruits come in at now if you
[1:06:22] will just just read just one verse with
[1:06:24] me here at the top then we're gonna skip
[1:06:26] down verse well let's just pick up verse
[1:06:30] 16 how about that
[1:06:31] he said this I say then walk in the
[1:06:34] spirit fifth chapter sorry fifth this
[1:06:36] chapter help you know if you were the
[1:06:37] chapters that would fifth chapter and
[1:06:39] then verse 16 then I say then this I say
[1:06:42] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:06:44] fulfill the lust of the flesh all right
[1:06:47] now dropping down you will notice as you
[1:06:50] read down through there that he speaks
[1:06:52] of what all of the fruit if we could
[1:06:54] call it this way the fruit of wickedness
[1:06:56] is in a person's life now I just want
[1:06:59] you all to think of this if a person is
[1:07:01] bearing forth from the tree of knowledge
[1:07:02] of good and evil then everything in 17
[1:07:06] 18 19 20 and 21 is what they're going to
[1:07:08] produce out of their life so until the
[1:07:12] individual is eating from a different
[1:07:14] seed eating from a different tree
[1:07:16] manifesting and bearing from a different
[1:07:19] life source they will always produce
[1:07:21] this alright listen close Church it
[1:07:23] doesn't matter if the person you're
[1:07:25] talking about is even religious if
[1:07:29] they're not born again all of this in
[1:07:32] this part right here and these verses
[1:07:33] here
[1:07:34] no matter how religious they might be no
[1:07:36] matter how many books they might quote
[1:07:37] from no matter how many times they pay
[1:07:38] ties or worship the Lord or sing or play
[1:07:40] a preach or whatever they do if they're
[1:07:42] not born again this is going to manifest
[1:07:45] out of their life in some way or another
[1:07:47] they're gonna have things such as
[1:07:49] ambient adulteries fornications
[1:07:51] lasciviousness witchcraft see hatred
[1:07:55] emulation revel ins you know in other
[1:07:59] words reveling as others rioted 'no sin
[1:08:02] other words you know cause and havoc
[1:08:04] stirring up problems creating issues and
[1:08:07] and and all such like this now
[1:08:09] all that do these things shall not
[1:08:11] inherit the kingdom of God now those are
[1:08:13] those that are born these are those that
[1:08:15] are born off of that tree of knowledge
[1:08:16] and good and evil all right everybody
[1:08:18] with me so far say Amen all right so
[1:08:20] then the knowledge of good and evil then
[1:08:22] no matter how religious they might be on
[1:08:24] the outside remember the devil last
[1:08:25] night standing for that religious white
[1:08:27] cloak on in that first horse he's just
[1:08:29] as religious as he can be and don't
[1:08:31] forget this church for the Living God
[1:08:32] bride never let this escape your mind
[1:08:35] the devil is not a drunk laying in a
[1:08:37] gutter somewhere neither the devil is
[1:08:39] religious amen don't ever forget that he
[1:08:42] is a religious creature he is a
[1:08:43] religious being always has been from the
[1:08:45] very beginning so then these things that
[1:08:48] are produced out of somebody's life
[1:08:50] these are the fruit of this wicked tree
[1:08:53] of this wicked life this is what people
[1:08:55] were produced out of their life now you
[1:08:57] say brother band I see a couple of these
[1:08:59] things Conley working from you well
[1:09:01] that's right your flesh will produce
[1:09:02] these things however if you are born
[1:09:05] again then as Peter said we've been kind
[1:09:08] of touching on it you can catch it in
[1:09:10] first Peter there he said we are born of
[1:09:12] incorruptible seed all right
[1:09:14] incorruptible seed has been birthed on
[1:09:16] the inside of us while we're still
[1:09:18] living in a corruptible body see
[1:09:20] corruptible seed on the outside
[1:09:21] incorruptible on the inside so what does
[1:09:24] that do puts you in a war then you have
[1:09:26] the outside desires fighting against the
[1:09:29] inside desires we know all this but it's
[1:09:31] just a just a review just to kind of get
[1:09:33] down to a point here but then once that
[1:09:35] once that spirit then takes root and
[1:09:38] then begins to produce the life of
[1:09:40] Christ then idolatry witchcraft hatred
[1:09:43] wrath strife seditions heresies all of
[1:09:47] these things
[1:09:47] then become subject hallelujah and
[1:09:50] praise the Lord a man subject to the
[1:09:53] word that is birthed on the inside of
[1:09:55] you Amen do you see that Amen in other
[1:09:58] words a Christian might fight and
[1:10:00] wrestle with sedition they might wrestle
[1:10:02] with heresy they might be trapped up in
[1:10:05] seducing spirits they might get trapped
[1:10:08] up in different things witchcraft and
[1:10:10] other things you say how in the world
[1:10:11] could a Christian get trapped up in
[1:10:13] witchcraft well the Bible said rebellion
[1:10:15] is as the sin of witchcraft so you could
[1:10:18] get trapped up in having a rebellious
[1:10:20] spirit on you and things of that nature
[1:10:21] but if the life of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:10:25] I'm trying to find a place to put my
[1:10:27] Bible because I'm feeling awful
[1:10:28] Pentecostal right now amen but if the
[1:10:30] life of Christ is on the inside of you
[1:10:33] then it will bring all of those things
[1:10:36] subject to the word that is laying on
[1:10:38] the inside of you and where there was
[1:10:40] witchcraft and rebellion and all these
[1:10:42] other things then the Holy Spirit will
[1:10:44] grab that and bring it subject to the
[1:10:46] word so you're not doing that no more
[1:10:47] those things are over that's all
[1:10:49] relevance said how do you know you work
[1:10:51] wicked he said your desires changed a
[1:10:53] man that's the one best way to figure
[1:10:55] out whether or not the tree has been
[1:10:57] birthed if it's been produced all right
[1:10:58] now if we pick up the in Galatians
[1:11:01] chapter 22 now I want you to really take
[1:11:04] this carefully you've read it a million
[1:11:06] times but let's read it deeper today
[1:11:08] than what we've ever read it but I like
[1:11:11] that word but because it gives a change
[1:11:12] of direction and now if I like what
[1:11:15] Scofield says here if you've got a
[1:11:17] little Scofield Bible there's a mark
[1:11:19] there number one next to but he said
[1:11:21] that Christian character is not mere
[1:11:22] moral or legal correctness but
[1:11:25] possession and manifestation of nine
[1:11:29] Grace's which is right these these
[1:11:31] fruits of the spirit these nine fruits
[1:11:33] of the spirit are the manifestation and
[1:11:35] like what Scofield said here he said it
[1:11:37] is the character in expression toward
[1:11:39] man so all of these things are not moral
[1:11:42] and legal correctness let's just take
[1:11:45] for example these these works of
[1:11:47] darkness and things on the bad side you
[1:11:49] know a person could teach them self
[1:11:51] train themselves they could you know
[1:11:53] discipline their mind to not commit
[1:11:57] adultery
[1:11:57] all right the Pharisees were such people
[1:11:59] they could train them
[1:12:01] so to live a more moral correctness or
[1:12:03] they could live according to the law a
[1:12:05] legal as Schofield said here a legal
[1:12:07] correctness all right but that doesn't
[1:12:09] mean that by doing so by by squashing
[1:12:13] and quashing some of these these actions
[1:12:16] that doesn't mean that the fruit of life
[1:12:18] the fruit of the Spirit is growing on
[1:12:20] the inside of the heart oh I hope you
[1:12:23] get that church I hope you understand
[1:12:24] you visible and invisible I want you to
[1:12:26] listen to rather been carefully it
[1:12:28] doesn't matter if a person even learns
[1:12:30] how not to manifest these works of
[1:12:33] darkness and all they put on is a legal
[1:12:36] correctness without the birth of the
[1:12:39] spirit that is a manufactured holiness
[1:12:41] and not a holiness that comes from a
[1:12:43] birthing of the Holy Spirit amen does
[1:12:47] everybody get that all right if you do
[1:12:48] say man now now the fruit then of what
[1:12:54] capital SPI RIT of the spirit so the
[1:12:58] fruit we're referring to now remember
[1:13:00] this is the fruit of the Spirit not the
[1:13:02] fruit of your training not the fruit of
[1:13:05] your discipline not the fruit of your
[1:13:07] teaching not the fruit of what my mama
[1:13:08] told me not to do it so I don't do it or
[1:13:12] I'm told to love so I do so because
[1:13:14] that's what I'm supposed to do but these
[1:13:16] and I want you to think now I want you
[1:13:18] to think real deep about the scripture
[1:13:19] because this is a real blessing to you
[1:13:20] if you can if you can get a hold of this
[1:13:21] if you can latch onto this this will
[1:13:23] change your life the fruit of the Spirit
[1:13:25] then is not a mental or moral legal
[1:13:29] discipline or legal discipline but the
[1:13:32] fruit of the Spirit is the actual
[1:13:35] birthing out from the nature of God to
[1:13:40] interrupt your own nature did you get
[1:13:46] that the fruit of the Spirit hallelujah
[1:13:50] I got glory bumps all the way down my
[1:13:51] back I hope you got that the fruit of
[1:13:54] the Spirit is actually something that
[1:13:57] interrupts is the birthing of God in you
[1:14:00] that interrupts your human nature it
[1:14:04] disrupts your life I want you to think
[1:14:08] about that just a minute now you think
[1:14:10] what Jesus said when he talked about
[1:14:11] coming in and doing things and
[1:14:14] all of that remember what he said I come
[1:14:15] to bring a sword division in other words
[1:14:17] I come to interrupt things I come to
[1:14:21] interrupt families I come to interrupt
[1:14:22] churches I come to enter that's what
[1:14:24] Jesus's purpose was when he came to the
[1:14:26] world you said I come to bring division
[1:14:27] and separate and so on and so forth in
[1:14:29] other words interrupt I come to
[1:14:32] interrupt stuff alright now once you
[1:14:34] realize every person preacher and all
[1:14:37] set right here produces and manifest
[1:14:40] these evil works out of their way in
[1:14:42] some way well you say I've never
[1:14:44] committed adultery I'll be careful
[1:14:45] remember what Jesus said when a man
[1:14:47] looks on a woman to lust he's already
[1:14:49] been there see he's already went to that
[1:14:51] place fornication and so forth
[1:14:53] uncleanliness well we could go a hundred
[1:14:55] of different ways with that remember the
[1:14:57] Lord Jesus and the Beatitudes he brought
[1:14:59] these things down to more than just a
[1:15:01] moral or an actionable something
[1:15:04] something we do physically or with our
[1:15:05] bodies or something like that but Jesus
[1:15:08] brought these down to even hating hatred
[1:15:10] you say I've never had hatred but if
[1:15:12] you're angry with your brother without a
[1:15:13] cause jesus said in doing so it's hatred
[1:15:17] you just same as killed him you don't
[1:15:19] have to take a gun shoot somebody just
[1:15:21] speak against their influence I was
[1:15:24] saying it the other day I said that's
[1:15:25] the thing about leaders and preachers
[1:15:26] and people like that we have to put up
[1:15:28] with people falsely accusing us of
[1:15:30] things all the time that's one of the
[1:15:31] greatest battle that a preachers got
[1:15:33] nearly if you could if you could
[1:15:35] overcome everything everybody says about
[1:15:37] you and what everybody talks about you
[1:15:39] if you can get people to believe you
[1:15:41] beyond all that nonsense what you're
[1:15:42] doing pretty good as a leader because
[1:15:45] the minute you start doing good and
[1:15:46] helping people I guarantee somebody's
[1:15:48] got some critic about it well I don't he
[1:15:50] don't say it the way I like it and you
[1:15:51] don't do it the way I like it and all
[1:15:53] that well that's the beautiful thing
[1:15:54] about preaching they didn't hire me they
[1:15:56] can't fire me and I'm not put on this
[1:15:57] earth to please them and say it the way
[1:15:59] they want it I'm here to preach the
[1:16:00] gospel and that's the way it's being
[1:16:01] preached amen amen that's right and said
[1:16:04] well but I wish they wouldn't yell at us
[1:16:06] all that hollering we don't like that
[1:16:07] stuff well if you felt like I felt the
[1:16:09] anointing on me like I feel you might do
[1:16:12] a little hollering too and then on the
[1:16:14] other side I wish they'd holler and more
[1:16:15] and then I feel like well if you were
[1:16:17] settled and grounded in the word you
[1:16:19] might settle down a little bit instead
[1:16:20] of running here and there and jumping
[1:16:22] without any kind of a real message of
[1:16:24] God we're seeking for balance friends
[1:16:27] oh you got people you know and probably
[1:16:29] not in y'all's church but you know how
[1:16:31] it goes
[1:16:32] well I don't know why Bob sings that
[1:16:33] song all the songs so you could sing as
[1:16:35] a song there why does he pick that song
[1:16:37] well you see everybody got a critic
[1:16:39] about something everybody got something
[1:16:41] they got to say about some another well
[1:16:43] why does sister Myrna Playa get why
[1:16:45] don't she play a flute I think she'd be
[1:16:48] better with a flute instead of a guitar
[1:16:49] some little old thing like that they've
[1:16:51] always got some critics somehow another
[1:16:53] so if we can learn to overcome all of
[1:16:57] the hubbub and all the hearsay and all
[1:16:59] that stuff that goes on around us and
[1:17:01] focus on what the Holy Spirit wants for
[1:17:04] our lives that's the main objective of
[1:17:07] this last day because if the devil can
[1:17:10] confuse you and get your eyes off on
[1:17:12] every other thing in the world yes see
[1:17:14] because you're not fooling me I know how
[1:17:16] we are as humans we gauge whether we're
[1:17:18] doing well or not by based on what we
[1:17:20] hear from other people you know somebody
[1:17:22] comes and tells you hey you're pretty
[1:17:24] good Christian well you walk a little
[1:17:26] taller that day and you know and and and
[1:17:28] you pray a little bit deeper and you
[1:17:30] might even say some thees and thous in
[1:17:31] your prayer closet amen we have a
[1:17:35] tendency to gauge yourself based upon
[1:17:38] what the external is seeing out of our
[1:17:41] lives but I want to encourage you this
[1:17:42] way I want you to think of this way it
[1:17:45] is not that is not the way we gauge
[1:17:48] whether or not the Holy Spirit is acting
[1:17:50] how we know the Holy Spirit is growing
[1:17:52] and acting is there is an absolute
[1:17:55] interruption of your nature
[1:17:58] when you want to do something and then
[1:18:01] sup on the inside of you goes well you
[1:18:06] ought to be thankful for that little
[1:18:07] because that is interrupting your human
[1:18:11] nature it's bringing and producing a
[1:18:13] result out of you that wouldn't normally
[1:18:16] have been there why do y'all reckon that
[1:18:17] people do these things so much the bad
[1:18:19] stuff now why do I reckon people do you
[1:18:22] think they feel bad after they cussed
[1:18:24] you a blue street because what about for
[1:18:26] nanoseconds after the light turned green
[1:18:28] you didn't mash on your gas pedal and go
[1:18:30] oh I'm screaming up the road and they're
[1:18:32] blowing their horn and sticking their
[1:18:34] fingers up at you in all that you make a
[1:18:36] feel bad about that they get on the
[1:18:39] internet and they fuss
[1:18:39] other people about it they said this
[1:18:42] dummy got in my way I couldn't believe
[1:18:43] it I honked at him shot there for four
[1:18:45] nanoseconds like I had to take a breath
[1:18:48] before he started moving
[1:18:50] you see that's people that's the way
[1:18:51] they are they don't feel bad about none
[1:18:53] of that stuff but what makes you feel
[1:18:55] bad Church something's there to
[1:18:57] interrupt you oh yeah come on don't look
[1:19:01] at me that way now every one of us every
[1:19:03] one of us we've got the same potentials
[1:19:06] as everything that I read right here all
[1:19:08] of us have had that temptation to blow
[1:19:11] the horn and a holler get out of the way
[1:19:14] you dummy get out of the way what's the
[1:19:16] matter with you gas pedals on the right
[1:19:18] don't you know how to drive who give
[1:19:20] that guy his license on and on and on
[1:19:23] and on and on but what interrupts you
[1:19:25] and makes you feel like you know maybe I
[1:19:27] should be a little sweeter about this
[1:19:28] yeah he might not be too bright you
[1:19:30] might know where the gas pedal is but
[1:19:32] bless his heart at least he's in a car
[1:19:33] driving he could be walking no legs or
[1:19:36] some kind of thing I mean what makes you
[1:19:37] think of things in a manner in which
[1:19:39] that you you try to you try to give the
[1:19:41] guy little rope huh are you with me huh
[1:19:45] what makes you do that
[1:19:46] what are up ssin causes that change in
[1:19:49] you it's the fruit of the Spirit that's
[1:19:52] living down inside that born-again heart
[1:19:54] raise the Lord and that borned again is
[1:19:58] producing an interruption that changes
[1:20:01] the whole scheme of the things alright
[1:20:02] just look at the contrast to this the
[1:20:04] fruit of the Spirit is what what's that
[1:20:06] first word somebody tell me love well
[1:20:11] that's the exact contrast to hatred all
[1:20:14] right now I don't know if you I don't
[1:20:15] know if some of you Eagles are gonna be
[1:20:17] chickens this morning and not be brave
[1:20:18] enough to admit this but have you ever
[1:20:21] battled hatred anybody want to be
[1:20:23] courageous today
[1:20:24] alright see a few heads nodding and hand
[1:20:26] it going there you go alright well what
[1:20:28] makes you sister Leah what makes you
[1:20:30] keep going and getting a gun and just
[1:20:31] blowing their brains out just say done
[1:20:33] with them huh
[1:20:35] or running over them with one of your
[1:20:37] with a quad or some kind of thing like
[1:20:39] that what makes you just what makes you
[1:20:42] just keep from going out there and just
[1:20:43] just I mean just waylaying them huh what
[1:20:46] makes you all stop that brother Matt
[1:20:49] what is it inside of you that keeps you
[1:20:51] from going and getting your moose hunter
[1:20:53] your big Moose gun and just blowing
[1:20:56] their big toes off to take that huh
[1:21:00] what causes the difference in you that
[1:21:04] not now I'm making it kindly ridiculous
[1:21:06] in other words so you can make it a
[1:21:07] little bit clearer picture to you
[1:21:09] because you could say specific things
[1:21:10] but I just want I just want to get you a
[1:21:12] general picture of it what makes you do
[1:21:15] it
[1:21:15] what interrupts your thoughts whatever
[1:21:19] she's took your hairbrush for the 400th
[1:21:21] time and you'd like to commit murder
[1:21:23] right there on the scene losing your
[1:21:25] hairbrush Sam's always taking mine I got
[1:21:27] three girls in the house four girls
[1:21:29] captain Sam I haven't had a hairbrush
[1:21:31] since 1998 amen they're always stealing
[1:21:35] my work amen and it makes me feel bad
[1:21:40] because I want to comb what hair I got
[1:21:41] left you understand what makes you what
[1:21:46] makes that something that comes up you
[1:21:48] said boy I'd like to get them man I'd
[1:21:51] like to get them oh the angel halos are
[1:21:54] just aglow in this morning look at you
[1:21:56] folks you so sainted I thought that was
[1:21:58] just a blur on the computer no that's
[1:22:00] the holy aura of Christ coming off you
[1:22:02] little angels this morning I'm sure
[1:22:04] ain't none of you ever had these things
[1:22:06] in your mind have you
[1:22:07] ah words a man Church but what stops you
[1:22:14] what makes it different for you than for
[1:22:17] everybody else very simply put what
[1:22:20] makes it different is the interruption
[1:22:22] of love contrasts and fights and battles
[1:22:27] that hatred that lays in the human flesh
[1:22:30] you see it something raises up on the
[1:22:34] inside of you that says uh uh don't you
[1:22:37] think you should pray for that fella oh
[1:22:39] it's just a hairbrush bin you'll be all
[1:22:42] right what is it that stalks you out of
[1:22:47] your tree don't say psychology because
[1:22:50] some people make they've used human
[1:22:51] psychology that's true but listen no
[1:22:54] matter how good your psychology is it
[1:22:57] cannot contrast genuine hatred that lays
[1:22:59] inside the human being
[1:23:01] it cannot do it takes the love of God
[1:23:04] the absolute love of God to contrast and
[1:23:07] fight that other part of it now remember
[1:23:09] what we're talking about no shortcuts to
[1:23:10] adoption we got to get right to the meat
[1:23:12] of this
[1:23:12] all right then joy I just did I don't
[1:23:15] know if some of you been seeing the
[1:23:16] little minute clips I've been doing on
[1:23:19] Facebook a little minute videos and I
[1:23:21] just did one on happiness and and it's
[1:23:24] hard to condense all that down in just a
[1:23:26] few moments time but I did a little clip
[1:23:28] and I was sharing with some folks that
[1:23:30] some of the premiere studies on the
[1:23:33] science of happiness the one thing they
[1:23:35] found out of tens of thousands of people
[1:23:37] plumb down in elementary school children
[1:23:39] was that there was no way that a person
[1:23:41] seeking for fame or money or being
[1:23:44] better looking or some kind of thing
[1:23:46] like that that every time a person in
[1:23:48] that condition even an elementary kid
[1:23:49] seeking for being some sports star was
[1:23:52] more unhappy than the person that worked
[1:23:55] on stuff from the inside Family Values
[1:23:57] and committing to the Lord and and and
[1:24:00] relationships and friendship those were
[1:24:02] people that were genuinely happy folks
[1:24:04] that sought for more money you
[1:24:06] understand not just making money but
[1:24:07] always seeking for more money trying to
[1:24:09] get that next level financially and hit
[1:24:12] the big time
[1:24:12] those people were genuinely unhappy all
[1:24:15] the time so what makes a Christian happy
[1:24:17] which is the question I asked that a day
[1:24:19] in my little one-minute clip what's what
[1:24:21] makes us genuinely happy and the Bible
[1:24:24] said the joy of the Lord and the book of
[1:24:27] Habakkuk said the joy of the Lord is
[1:24:29] where I get my my happiness from so this
[1:24:33] joy now I want you to think about this
[1:24:35] this joy can be manifesting itself in
[1:24:38] you even when emulation strife rav-4
[1:24:42] negation idolatry hatred variance
[1:24:43] emulations and all that is going on
[1:24:45] around you even though your life is
[1:24:48] influenced by all of that the joy of the
[1:24:51] Lord can manifest itself in the midst of
[1:24:54] all of that nonsense Amen that should
[1:24:58] have got a great big hallelujah praise
[1:25:00] the Lord because the joy of the Lord
[1:25:03] isn't necessarily something you feel the
[1:25:06] joy of the Lord is something that keeps
[1:25:07] you positive keeps you striving keeps
[1:25:10] you pushing on even though everything
[1:25:13] else around you
[1:25:14] is not that way you know what give that
[1:25:18] woman when that man walked in there and
[1:25:20] said you want to see a Christian come
[1:25:21] home drunk staggering around brought his
[1:25:23] buddies in there and said you want to
[1:25:24] see Christian I'll show you one took him
[1:25:25] eggs and slammed him against the wall
[1:25:27] and you know I don't like my eggs that
[1:25:29] way woman now she didn't start laughing
[1:25:31] uh god bless you honey
[1:25:34] god bless you it's not that kind of joy
[1:25:37] but she's meekly bowed her head swept up
[1:25:41] them eggs singing must Jesus bear the
[1:25:44] cross alone what done that for the joy
[1:25:46] of the Lord was her strength she had a
[1:25:48] joy knowing that God was on her side and
[1:25:51] if God was for her who could be against
[1:25:53] her somebody say hey man I don't know
[1:25:57] yet the joy the Lord gave her a
[1:25:58] positivity that even a negativity the
[1:26:01] joy that come from this the positivity
[1:26:03] that come from this type of joy gave her
[1:26:06] positivity in the midst of negativity hi
[1:26:09] friend this ain't mind over matter mind
[1:26:11] you this is something a whole lot deeper
[1:26:12] than mind over matter it is the word
[1:26:14] being birthed out now we'll just take
[1:26:17] one more here just quickly and that is
[1:26:19] faith all right faith is a long-range
[1:26:22] vision it sees way on down the road
[1:26:23] faith is a burly man with muscles and
[1:26:25] holds the sword of the word and faith is
[1:26:28] a powerful is a powerhouse and powerful
[1:26:30] and all that all right but faith is a
[1:26:33] contrast to everything else you are in
[1:26:36] your human nature that's why no matter
[1:26:37] how much you try to believe it up here
[1:26:39] it must eventually make that journey
[1:26:41] from here down to your heart to where
[1:26:43] faith takes a whole but you realize
[1:26:46] faith here isn't just necessarily
[1:26:47] believing God but faith could be
[1:26:49] interpreted it could also be used as
[1:26:51] faithfulness being loyal being faithful
[1:26:54] to God all right now with all of that
[1:26:58] said now now let's revisit for just a
[1:27:01] moment the quote I was reading to you
[1:27:03] here where brother Branham said these
[1:27:05] things take time he said that's the
[1:27:08] problem with the church they get down
[1:27:10] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he said
[1:27:12] in the next day they want to be out
[1:27:13] casting out Devils
[1:27:14] he said they want to be doing this or
[1:27:16] that or the other now what he's trying
[1:27:18] to tell us is these things are a process
[1:27:21] all right so love doesn't come out of
[1:27:24] your heart automatically it may take
[1:27:26] some time for that
[1:27:27] kind of love to grow into you this is
[1:27:31] one thing I'm so thankful about the Holy
[1:27:32] Ghost watching over our lives and being
[1:27:34] mindful of us because there's many times
[1:27:36] that works of the flesh would have
[1:27:38] overcome us but the Holy Ghost come in
[1:27:40] and chopped it off and said no way no
[1:27:42] way you're not going that far when I was
[1:27:45] in Mexico number of years ago there was
[1:27:46] a brother and he was a little ragged
[1:27:49] looking fella I mean just just terrible
[1:27:51] didn't even have a tie and I give me my
[1:27:54] title to my neck and I hand put it on
[1:27:55] him and I said he was an older man I
[1:27:57] said there you go Padre acid the father
[1:28:00] in other words the Padre I said here you
[1:28:02] go Padre and he he just started smiling
[1:28:04] and crying he gripped that tied he said
[1:28:06] that you great servant of God would gift
[1:28:09] this tie to me we'll come to find out
[1:28:11] that this man was somebody that had such
[1:28:14] a prayer life that God would give him
[1:28:16] visions and so he was down praying and
[1:28:18] and and all at once he sees this man and
[1:28:21] he doesn't recognize this man but he
[1:28:22] sees the street he sees the area he's at
[1:28:24] and in this vision the Lord showed him
[1:28:27] that another man had molested his girl
[1:28:29] and this man with a gun in his hand was
[1:28:32] walking down the street was gonna go
[1:28:33] blow that man away and so here he goes
[1:28:35] down and the brother recognizes the
[1:28:37] street he charges in this whole little
[1:28:40] almost dilapidated the poor little thank
[1:28:42] you barely walk and he's charged it in
[1:28:44] you imagine is just quick as he could go
[1:28:46] and he sees this man almost reaching the
[1:28:49] house with his pistol in his pocket he
[1:28:51] walks up and gets him by the arm puts
[1:28:53] his hand on that pistol and he said and
[1:28:54] his horse in Spanish and he grabbed a
[1:28:56] hold of his arm in that pistol laid his
[1:28:58] hand kind of over the pocket like and
[1:29:00] said don't do what you're gonna do jesus
[1:29:01] loves you and the man stopped for a
[1:29:04] moment and he said I told the Lord if
[1:29:06] God loved me at all and God cared about
[1:29:08] me and almost mindful of this situation
[1:29:11] somehow the Holy Spirit would intervene
[1:29:15] and interrupt this situation and that's
[1:29:17] exactly what God did laid his hand right
[1:29:19] on in the pit pistols in his pockets you
[1:29:21] couldn't have saw it you know walk
[1:29:22] around big old coat on something like
[1:29:23] that he put his hand right where the
[1:29:25] pistols at put his hand on his arm like
[1:29:26] that and said don't do what you're going
[1:29:28] to do the man fell on his face before
[1:29:29] God repented right there on the street
[1:29:31] now I said that to say this now that
[1:29:33] when I first heard that story as a
[1:29:35] Christian I said to myself brother man I
[1:29:38] said oh I am as short as sure
[1:29:40] can be man I need to get down to
[1:29:43] business with God because these are
[1:29:45] experiences that bride needs to have
[1:29:47] these experiences and then the Holy
[1:29:51] Spirit showed me something those things
[1:29:55] don't always happen right away now you
[1:29:59] ever stop to think why do we fast why do
[1:30:03] we pray more than one time about things
[1:30:04] why don't we continue fighting and
[1:30:06] wrestling in prayer about issues it's
[1:30:09] the same reason when you're looking at
[1:30:11] your garden out there and you know it's
[1:30:12] gonna produce fruit you know it will as
[1:30:15] you can see the leaves everything is
[1:30:16] healthy the grounds right the water
[1:30:19] content the nutrients the Sun everything
[1:30:21] is just exact right spot and you're
[1:30:24] looking at that plan and you're saying
[1:30:25] to that little plan I know you're gonna
[1:30:26] produce tomatoes this year I know you're
[1:30:29] gonna produce beans squash whatever it
[1:30:31] may be I know you're gonna bring forth
[1:30:33] but it takes time and you can stand
[1:30:37] there and scream at it you could annoy
[1:30:39] no ever top of that that plant so all
[1:30:41] right now do it but it doesn't happen
[1:30:44] until it grows into that plants life now
[1:30:49] many years later the experiences like
[1:30:53] that as I grew in the Lord experience is
[1:30:55] not exactly but similar things we can
[1:30:59] say equal or lesser value perhaps I
[1:31:01] don't know similar things in ministry
[1:31:03] stuff would happen while I'm preaching
[1:31:05] and praying for people and different
[1:31:07] things God would do and all that and and
[1:31:09] and I would think to myself years ago I
[1:31:11] thought something but the Bible I
[1:31:13] thought something's got to be wrong with
[1:31:15] me because if I'm the Christian I'm
[1:31:18] supposed to be all of this supernatural
[1:31:21] stuff would be happening around me do
[1:31:24] you understand that the greatest
[1:31:26] supernatural thing that could be
[1:31:28] happening is happening right now would
[1:31:32] you like to know what it is you're
[1:31:35] growing
[1:31:38] it doesn't get any bigger than that now
[1:31:43] all that will produce out of your life
[1:31:46] you know it'll eventually show up just
[1:31:49] like Elizabeth my oldest daughter she
[1:31:52] bought up I call it a chrysanthemum and
[1:31:55] it's not a criminai it's liable to be a
[1:31:57] daffodil I don't know what it is it's a
[1:31:59] pretty flower but anyhow I say it wrong
[1:32:01] every time I said I've been calling it a
[1:32:04] petunia for a week but I know that ain't
[1:32:05] that it's not even a flowers a petunia
[1:32:07] don't think but anyhow I looked down up
[1:32:10] the thing and it had buds all over you
[1:32:12] know and I told her I said hey that
[1:32:14] petunias gonna grow out of course she
[1:32:15] rolls her eyes at me daddy don't do do
[1:32:17] nothing right and I I looked at it and I
[1:32:21] thought nah man it's about ready to
[1:32:23] burst open a week and a half later I was
[1:32:26] still looking at the same buds and I
[1:32:29] mean it looked like it was on the verge
[1:32:31] of just now I know y'all have still got
[1:32:34] 14 foot of snow out there you probably
[1:32:35] haven't seen the flower as of yet but
[1:32:37] but I know it's coming there it does
[1:32:39] exist even a new burl and you do get
[1:32:41] some good weather every now and then I
[1:32:42] know that man but I looked at that thing
[1:32:47] two weeks two weeks I looked it looked
[1:32:50] like him flowers just swelling out like
[1:32:52] they're getting ready just pop open at
[1:32:54] any moment two weeks I watch for that
[1:32:56] plant to start growing I waited and
[1:32:58] waited and waited I got look at it I
[1:33:00] started talking to it I said petunia
[1:33:02] what's the matter with you
[1:33:04] horse first thing he told me is my name
[1:33:06] ain't petunia hallelujah but as I was
[1:33:13] studying it and I was looking at it I
[1:33:18] recognized I recognized the greatest
[1:33:23] thing that could be happening for that
[1:33:24] plant was taking place it was growing
[1:33:27] and in a matter of days all of a sudden
[1:33:32] from one night to the next I walked out
[1:33:35] there in this great big beautiful flower
[1:33:36] it opened up and it was laying right out
[1:33:38] there and just a just a matter of
[1:33:41] moments from one night to the next
[1:33:42] morning the second that Sun come out in
[1:33:46] the morning it already bloomed out and I
[1:33:49] could have got frustrated looking at it
[1:33:51] and you know where I'm Adam I walk with
[1:33:53] God I should be casted out Devils give
[1:33:56] it a little time the bud might be ready
[1:34:00] to open up and it might be on the verge
[1:34:02] of opening but never ever ever ever ever
[1:34:06] rush nature allow it to do what it's
[1:34:10] supposed to do because if you don't
[1:34:12] you'll stop and kill the growth of that
[1:34:14] thing altogether you have to allow it to
[1:34:16] move at the right moment I wonder if
[1:34:19] that's what Solomon was thanking when he
[1:34:20] wrote those words God makes all things
[1:34:22] beautiful in his time now you look down
[1:34:28] at your lives you know I've got all
[1:34:29] kinds of faith I believe God sure you do
[1:34:31] you might be like that little flower get
[1:34:33] ready to burst open but just give it
[1:34:35] time just allow the Holy Spirit to come
[1:34:38] in there and allow it to just grab all
[1:34:40] the nutrients it's need it needs because
[1:34:43] remember while it's in that little
[1:34:44] budding state it's protected the second
[1:34:47] it opens up it's got to have that
[1:34:49] vulnerability to not only be able to
[1:34:51] take an assault you understand the
[1:34:54] weather's going to beat on it the sun's
[1:34:55] gonna hit on it and all that so it's got
[1:34:57] to be ready to open up not to mention
[1:34:59] it's got to be ready to give because
[1:35:01] bees and what more I got carpenter bees
[1:35:03] all over my my front porch and they come
[1:35:05] over there and they've got the little
[1:35:06] yellow on their legs where they're
[1:35:07] taking pollen from that flower it's got
[1:35:10] to have enough inside of it to not only
[1:35:11] give but take the beating on the outside
[1:35:14] you would not want to rush that
[1:35:16] prematurely in other words you can't
[1:35:20] take a shortcut now it's been easy to
[1:35:24] reach down and start peeling that little
[1:35:26] flower open say come on I want to see
[1:35:27] your bud get out here and in some cases
[1:35:31] you might have been able to open it up
[1:35:32] and see the bud but if you took a
[1:35:34] shortcut you would have heard it you'd
[1:35:37] have heard it but I said they want to
[1:35:38] take a shortcut to heaven he said
[1:35:42] there's no shortcuts
[1:35:43] he said you literally die to yourself he
[1:35:46] said they don't want to grow and that's
[1:35:49] right they don't want to grow
[1:35:51] he said they want to come right quick
[1:35:55] how many times have you seen that even
[1:35:57] in message preaching sometimes I'm not
[1:35:59] being critical or preachers but I'm just
[1:36:01] I think we need to straighten out and
[1:36:02] address some of these issues we hear
[1:36:04] even
[1:36:05] message preaching sometimes year where
[1:36:06] the bride we're ready for the rapture
[1:36:08] we're gonna take maybe 4 1 how does that
[1:36:13] preacher know that he don't know Jesus
[1:36:14] didn't know the day nor the hour and I'm
[1:36:16] certainly not gonna be silly enough to
[1:36:20] look at the people of God and say we're
[1:36:21] ready I don't know you might we might be
[1:36:24] like that little budding flower and if
[1:36:29] I'm not careful I might rush it all
[1:36:31] we're manifested sons of God we're ready
[1:36:33] to take on the devil better be careful
[1:36:35] brother because whenever the tide turns
[1:36:37] and it's time for this bride to come to
[1:36:40] the final showdown of this final hour
[1:36:42] and her stand out before the world I'm
[1:36:44] talking about mark of the beast the
[1:36:46] squeeze church is shutting Evert you
[1:36:48] can't buy nor sell when that hour comes
[1:36:50] when we start kind of crossing into that
[1:36:53] little time period for that short quick
[1:36:55] work when the elect of God has got to
[1:36:57] stand on this earth and perhaps speak
[1:36:59] food by creative power on her table
[1:37:02] you better believe she better be ready
[1:37:04] for that moment because if you're
[1:37:06] Russian she won't be able to take the
[1:37:08] pressure and she won't be able to give
[1:37:10] what it takes remember but I've been
[1:37:12] talk about the third pole and spoken
[1:37:14] word he said when the farmer needs water
[1:37:16] for his crops I give you your water your
[1:37:18] rain in Jesus Christ name and there will
[1:37:22] come an hour when the bride will face a
[1:37:23] great persecution now I don't believe
[1:37:25] the bride goes through tribulation by no
[1:37:27] means not at all I think a lot of the
[1:37:30] stuff that people are carrying on about
[1:37:31] I think it's because they've got a
[1:37:32] doomsday mentality I don't believe we're
[1:37:36] gonna be living in in our basements
[1:37:37] eating k-rations and you know and having
[1:37:39] to save up jugs of water and in you know
[1:37:42] neat freeze-dried fruit for six months
[1:37:44] and stuff like I don't believe the
[1:37:45] brides that are gonna see things like
[1:37:46] that now there's no doubt there'll be a
[1:37:48] cross over time where there'll be a
[1:37:50] persecution there'll be a squeeze
[1:37:52] they'll be all of that but most of what
[1:37:53] people are thinking is what the food is
[1:37:55] purged and they're gonna see the church
[1:37:56] is gonna see it we won't see it anybody
[1:38:00] ever try to squeeze a bar or soap in the
[1:38:01] shower
[1:38:02] anybody ever squeeze it really hard got
[1:38:05] a idea what happens to that bar or soap
[1:38:07] when you squeeze it really hard and
[1:38:12] so is there gonna be a squeeze sure this
[1:38:14] gonna be a squeeze they gonna probably
[1:38:15] shut churches sure that gonna shut them
[1:38:17] down show there's gonna be a lot of
[1:38:18] persecution come on but the harder they
[1:38:21] squeeze this where the Brad ago Luke
[1:38:22] should is pop right out of here and
[1:38:24] wraps the resurrection to be all over
[1:38:26] with all right now no shortcuts we
[1:38:29] cannot take a shortcut in our new birth
[1:38:31] experience we cannot shortcut our way to
[1:38:34] adoption because again when that hour
[1:38:36] arrives that the bride is going to have
[1:38:38] to stand there in a fight on Showtime
[1:38:40] remember the final showdown is between
[1:38:41] Jesus and denominations and if you are
[1:38:44] God walking in shoe leather if you are
[1:38:46] Jesus Christ and shoe leather you
[1:38:49] understand if you are the manifestation
[1:38:52] of these sons and these daughters when
[1:38:55] that hour comes that the world turns
[1:38:57] against you the little Fowler that
[1:39:00] little flower better be ready to open up
[1:39:01] and take the pressure so we can't rush
[1:39:04] it just like in the new birth I hear
[1:39:07] people make altar calls come on down
[1:39:10] here and get born again you don't know
[1:39:12] but what it may take months for that
[1:39:13] person to get things out of their life
[1:39:14] and get situations straight now where
[1:39:16] the Lord can even deal with them in the
[1:39:18] right way and I've got to where anymore
[1:39:21] that when I make an altar call I don't
[1:39:23] try to make it absolute I say to them
[1:39:25] come get a start
[1:39:27] come get it start start out somewhere
[1:39:29] start out serving the Lord start out
[1:39:31] getting your faith right get some things
[1:39:33] you know moved around
[1:39:34] we try to shortcut it well glory to God
[1:39:37] you come down here I'm gonna lay my
[1:39:39] hands on you and I'm gonna pray for you
[1:39:40] and the moment I touch you that things
[1:39:42] going to disappear maybe not maybe not
[1:39:46] there might be things and there are
[1:39:48] things let me just say it this way there
[1:39:50] are things attached to our trials that
[1:39:52] are for our character development I I
[1:39:55] know that's that's a cheap way out of it
[1:39:57] that's a cheap way out of it I know
[1:39:59] that's a but that's easy to say sure but
[1:40:01] we're going by the Bible now the Bible
[1:40:03] tells us that all these things are
[1:40:06] working together for the good of them
[1:40:07] that love God you believe it say Amen
[1:40:09] yes absolutely they work together for
[1:40:12] the good of them that love the Lord so
[1:40:15] there's no shortcuts in this now when
[1:40:17] Joshua kind of coming on down in the
[1:40:20] message now and when Joshua was told now
[1:40:23] to
[1:40:24] arise and go over this Jordan I'm
[1:40:26] looking back again Joshua 1 and verse 2
[1:40:28] and now when Moses my servant now is
[1:40:32] declared dead he tells them to rise and
[1:40:34] go over now if you'll watch there God
[1:40:37] tells him in verse 2 as we've read it
[1:40:39] many times as Bible readers he's going
[1:40:41] to give him the land but look there in
[1:40:42] verses three four and five the second he
[1:40:45] promises them that land there's Hittites
[1:40:48] Jebusites and all kinds of other I'd
[1:40:49] sitting right in it now it looked like
[1:40:53] if God wanted to make this easy for them
[1:40:57] just take a big broom and sweep all that
[1:40:59] trouble out of there and that way the
[1:41:01] people go in and get to land that's the
[1:41:04] shortcut you you understand what fast
[1:41:10] food is right
[1:41:11] fast food is the ability to get your car
[1:41:14] and get it drive down to a drive-through
[1:41:17] and have a hamburger and a french fry in
[1:41:19] a matter of about ten minutes rather
[1:41:22] than get the meat out make some good
[1:41:25] pork in there with its shape at
[1:41:26] hamburger and season it up well you done
[1:41:30] halfway through your burger from a
[1:41:31] drive-thru by the time you get rid the
[1:41:33] burgers ready to grill drive-throughs
[1:41:37] are essentially a shortcut to cook it I
[1:41:42] don't I don't doubt that every now and
[1:41:44] then a shortcut needs to be taken
[1:41:47] believe me when I tell you when I'm on
[1:41:49] the road the last thing I want to do is
[1:41:50] have to pull over the side of the road
[1:41:51] get my grill out of the back of my car
[1:41:53] and and try to cook it up I kind of
[1:41:56] enjoy McDonald's drive-through in those
[1:41:57] situations so we can't take shortcuts
[1:42:04] well you're the bride you're the bride
[1:42:07] you're the bride yes but if you are the
[1:42:09] bride there's no shortcuts to your
[1:42:11] manifestation you are going to have to
[1:42:15] fight the battles you are going to have
[1:42:18] to go through the hard times you are
[1:42:20] going to have to face adversity because
[1:42:24] remember what we said in Galatians love
[1:42:26] is a contrast to hatred faith is a
[1:42:28] contrast to doubt joy is a contrast to
[1:42:32] all these other things there's a direct
[1:42:34] opposite that has to be manifested out
[1:42:37] of your heart
[1:42:38] to fight that other side so these aren't
[1:42:41] things that just and then there it is
[1:42:45] that's right you should be a much better
[1:42:47] Christian than what I am you can't be
[1:42:49] any more than what God has allowed you
[1:42:51] to grow to this very point right here
[1:42:53] and even in revelation and understanding
[1:42:55] of the Word of God something I want you
[1:42:57] to keep in your mind friends is as
[1:42:59] you're learning and growing and
[1:43:01] developing as a Christian always
[1:43:03] remember that no matter how many
[1:43:04] scriptures you read of a day no matter
[1:43:06] how much of the Bible you read or how
[1:43:08] much of the message you listen to no
[1:43:09] matter how much you press to understand
[1:43:11] it if God is not ready to reveal it to
[1:43:14] you it'll set right there on that shelf
[1:43:16] until God stands ready to say okay now
[1:43:17] you can see it see there's no shortcuts
[1:43:22] to it we get the cart before the horse
[1:43:24] and we get to get it all mixed up and
[1:43:26] and the fact of the matter is there may
[1:43:28] be things that God is placing within our
[1:43:30] lives that will lead up to that climax
[1:43:33] but we have to go through these other
[1:43:34] little things in order to get there to
[1:43:36] it see and then in verse 5 he tells them
[1:43:38] there should not be any man able to
[1:43:40] stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:43:42] life but that's up to you that's on
[1:43:44] conditions because when you look at this
[1:43:47] Joshua and then they lost some battles
[1:43:49] remember one akin stole the wedge of
[1:43:51] gold in the garment Babylonian garment
[1:43:53] all that and they lost man I said they
[1:43:56] lost battles but they was able to win
[1:43:59] ultimately because they didn't take the
[1:44:03] shortcut and they stayed right with what
[1:44:04] God told him to do and man is always
[1:44:06] wanting his shortcuts
[1:44:08] Elijah's garments manifested sons of God
[1:44:10] and now today the shortcut is oh we
[1:44:14] believe the message oh we believe the
[1:44:16] prophet oh we're the bride we're the
[1:44:17] bride were the elect we're the bride
[1:44:21] that's true but that's like standing
[1:44:23] there that tomato plant and screaming
[1:44:24] you're a tomato you're a tomato you're
[1:44:26] tomato yes but I must feed it
[1:44:29] I must allow it to grow until it can
[1:44:32] manifest what's on the inside of it now
[1:44:34] brother Bram called that nonsense to say
[1:44:37] you're born again tonight manifest the
[1:44:38] Son of God tomorrow nonsense where do
[1:44:40] you get that in the word now let's look
[1:44:43] at the overcoming promise for a little
[1:44:45] bit Revelation chapter 2 and verse 7
[1:44:49] and want to look just a moment at what
[1:44:52] the overcomer is now I'm gonna start
[1:44:54] digging into some reading here for just
[1:44:56] a little bit and and and I'm not even
[1:44:59] looking at the clock and I'm not gonna
[1:45:01] go pay attention to it and and if you're
[1:45:03] smart you shouldn't either because you
[1:45:05] just get discouraged if you think I'm
[1:45:07] going too long amen amen but I'm just
[1:45:09] going to go on anyhow and and and now
[1:45:12] let's pick up revolution 2 & 7 he that
[1:45:14] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:45:17] saith unto the churches
[1:45:19] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:45:23] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[1:45:25] midst of the paradise of God
[1:45:26] alright now in the ephesian church age
[1:45:29] now this is not the church age book but
[1:45:31] the ephesian church age message is
[1:45:32] pretty good up to 39 brother BAM said
[1:45:34] now look friends here's the way you
[1:45:36] overcome first you have to overcome then
[1:45:42] you can eat the fruit simple isn't it is
[1:45:50] that's pretty easy but how hard is it to
[1:45:54] get that sunk deep into your heart when
[1:45:57] it comes to this preaching we're over
[1:45:59] comers we're the bride we're gonna we
[1:46:01] we've got promises oh gods give us great
[1:46:05] promises uh-huh he has every promise in
[1:46:11] the book is mine every chapter every
[1:46:12] verse leave a line that's true that's
[1:46:15] true come on now church that's true but
[1:46:19] there's no shortcuts to get them there's
[1:46:22] no shortcuts to receive it they're all
[1:46:26] right listen close to my words there is
[1:46:28] going to be a fight sure there is
[1:46:37] there's got to be overcoming before
[1:46:41] there can be eating that's laying right
[1:46:44] there in the scripture all right so what
[1:46:45] do we do with a lot of the preaching we
[1:46:46] hear you can cast out devils you can
[1:46:49] raise the dead you can speak the word
[1:46:51] you we know that like we read in
[1:46:54] Galatians chapter 5 you'll have love
[1:46:56] you'll have faith you'll have patience
[1:46:58] you have all these other things that's
[1:46:59] true
[1:47:00] but there is a process
[1:47:02] that will take you there now what
[1:47:05] troubles me so much when I hear a lot of
[1:47:07] the preaching going on now is it is it
[1:47:10] seems like seemingly ministers have
[1:47:12] focused on the eating of the Tree of
[1:47:14] Life and they're not focused on okay how
[1:47:16] do I overcome to get there and brother
[1:47:21] this is the kind of preaching that we
[1:47:23] need to get us ready to eat in the Tree
[1:47:25] of Life I love to hear somebody
[1:47:27] encourage me and tell me I'm an
[1:47:28] overcomer I'm a Victor nothing could
[1:47:31] stand before me just like Joshua he said
[1:47:33] no man can stand before you but don't
[1:47:36] forget before he said that in verse five
[1:47:38] he tells him in verse four the land is
[1:47:40] full of Hittites same parallel right
[1:47:43] here in Joshua's shown right up in
[1:47:45] Revelation you've got to overcome first
[1:47:47] before you can eat of the Tree of Life
[1:47:49] now what we need help with is the
[1:47:51] overcoming part all right let's be a
[1:47:54] little bit plain for a moment you look
[1:47:56] at people in this day and age that claim
[1:47:58] the message of the other claim they
[1:47:59] believe this property to claim they
[1:48:00] believe it's truth they struggle with
[1:48:03] drugs and I don't mean like heroin and
[1:48:05] things like that they struggle with
[1:48:06] recreational drugs they're hipped up on
[1:48:09] uppers and downers and left errs and
[1:48:10] riders and enters and outers they're
[1:48:13] depressed 90% of their days huh come on
[1:48:17] somebody talk to me huh they struggle
[1:48:21] with this they struggle with that they
[1:48:23] struggle with the other but now it'd be
[1:48:25] easy as a preacher and y'all might like
[1:48:29] me a little bit better I guess maybe if
[1:48:30] I jumped on here and said you're the
[1:48:32] bride glory going to rapture glory
[1:48:35] hallelujah well you'd be shot your shoe
[1:48:38] heels off but the minute you walked out
[1:48:41] them back doors back there and you got
[1:48:42] yourself in that old world out there I'm
[1:48:46] the bride okay how do I love that guy
[1:48:49] who hates me how do I pray for that one
[1:48:54] that's despitefully using me
[1:48:57] you see it's wonderful to preach the
[1:49:00] Tree of Life but we've got to understand
[1:49:02] how do I overcome you understand us that
[1:49:06] title brother branham's message how can
[1:49:07] i overcome how how do i do it
[1:49:09] you wanted the people to understand it
[1:49:11] now Revelation chapter 2 verse 11
[1:49:14] all right he's a half an ear let him
[1:49:16] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:49:17] churches
[1:49:18] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[1:49:21] the second death well what about the
[1:49:23] first one
[1:49:28] let me Alden you want to look up from
[1:49:30] your Bible you heard me going I don't
[1:49:35] make eye contact maybe here to notice
[1:49:36] that got me he shall not be hurt of the
[1:49:44] second death well what about the person
[1:49:45] what about them Christians being hung
[1:49:48] out there on the gun burn at the stake
[1:49:51] covered in oil fed to lions never
[1:49:57] promise that about the first I said the
[1:49:59] second death wouldn't hurt you but what
[1:50:01] about the first one
[1:50:15] see to handle
[1:50:19] to him that overcometh will I give to
[1:50:21] eat of hidden manna see and I'll give
[1:50:29] him a white stone and in the stone a new
[1:50:33] name written which no man knoweth saving
[1:50:36] he that receiveth it all right now you
[1:50:39] you recognize that this hidden manna
[1:50:42] comes to those that overcome it now
[1:50:44] remember the white stone was taken they
[1:50:48] seemed to think they seemed to think
[1:50:53] that the that the white stone is I just
[1:50:58] try to simplify this but the Romans
[1:51:01] would pass that to another one as a
[1:51:03] symbol of victory after the battle was
[1:51:05] over with they take a white stone and
[1:51:07] often put a name on that stone of the
[1:51:11] one that they had overcome some kind of
[1:51:13] victorious name would be wrote upon that
[1:51:15] stone and they would keep it almost as a
[1:51:16] memento or a memorial of the battle now
[1:51:19] again proving that the battle alright
[1:51:21] then
[1:51:22] verse 26 now revelation 2:26 he that
[1:51:24] overcometh and keepeth my works unto the
[1:51:26] end to him will I give power over the
[1:51:30] nation's oh so we're gonna have power
[1:51:34] over the nation's huh but the nation's
[1:51:39] have got to be out of control before you
[1:51:41] can have power over them sit him Sam
[1:51:44] Revelation chapter 3 verse 5 he that
[1:51:47] overcometh chapter 3 and 5 the same
[1:51:52] shall be clothed in white raiment and I
[1:51:55] will not blot out his name out of the
[1:51:57] book of life but I will confess his name
[1:51:58] before my angels and before my father
[1:52:02] see he'll be clothed
[1:52:04] alright revelation 3:12 he that
[1:52:07] overcometh will I make him a pillar and
[1:52:09] the temple of my god and he shall go no
[1:52:12] more out I will write upon him the name
[1:52:14] of my god in the name of the city of my
[1:52:16] god which is New Jerusalem which cometh
[1:52:18] down out of heaven from my god and I
[1:52:21] will write upon him my new name all
[1:52:24] right now verse 21 3 and 21
[1:52:26] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:52:28] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[1:52:32] overcame
[1:52:33] and sat down with my father in his
[1:52:35] throne all right now all of these
[1:52:39] promises all of these promises that they
[1:52:43] represent the inheritance of the
[1:52:46] believer so for you and I in this last
[1:52:49] age every one of these overcoming
[1:52:52] promises we read are going to be given
[1:52:54] to you and I every single one of them
[1:52:57] we won't lack in any of these blessings
[1:53:00] but notice in every single verse who was
[1:53:05] the promise to to him that overcometh so
[1:53:14] no shortcuts you got to go straight
[1:53:17] through and cut through now revelation
[1:53:19] 21 and 7 all right if I'm moving too
[1:53:24] fast just write them down and and catch
[1:53:27] them because III know sometimes I move a
[1:53:30] little quick and I don't mean to but
[1:53:34] that's Pentecost makes me move that
[1:53:35] quick Amen Alleluia that Holy Ghost is
[1:53:39] it surges right revelation 21:7 he that
[1:53:43] overcometh shall inherit what all things
[1:53:49] that's right and I'll be his God and he
[1:53:52] shall be my son now in all things that
[1:53:57] we inherit remember the message hidden
[1:53:59] light been said now only believers only
[1:54:01] the elect comes into that God have
[1:54:05] chosen you he said revelation 2 he that
[1:54:08] overcometh its promise to overcomers
[1:54:10] alright now listen close he said you
[1:54:13] said I overcome smoking
[1:54:15] that ain't what he's talking about
[1:54:16] there's a whole lot more that goes to
[1:54:19] Christianity besides not smoking
[1:54:22] cigarettes or drinking whiskey he that
[1:54:24] overcometh shall inherit all things and
[1:54:26] he's reading from revelation 21 we read
[1:54:28] through there he said he will be my son
[1:54:30] I will be his God and he said listen I
[1:54:32] will give him a hidden manna I'll hide
[1:54:34] him away I'll give him the hit part made
[1:54:38] the hidden things of the world of the
[1:54:39] outside curtain that they don't know
[1:54:41] nothing about hallelujah he says though
[1:54:44] they eat manna but they don't know
[1:54:46] nothing about
[1:54:46] this I'll give them the hidden manna
[1:54:48] give him a stone with the name in it you
[1:54:50] said you get what I mean
[1:54:52] entering into the adoption or the hidden
[1:54:56] place with God amen so it's more than
[1:55:02] just saying well I controlled my temper
[1:55:06] a little bit I guess I'm doing pretty
[1:55:07] good no in order for Joshua and them to
[1:55:12] inherit everything God said they had to
[1:55:14] fully displace every hittite III there
[1:55:20] was out all circled out through those
[1:55:21] lands they had to displace dis possess
[1:55:25] every single one of them in order for
[1:55:26] them to go in there and get the full
[1:55:28] inheritance they had to run everyone I'm
[1:55:30] out well you know I got saved and I quit
[1:55:34] listening at worldly music good for you
[1:55:36] but there's no shortcuts to this you
[1:55:37] cannot jump from that all the way to
[1:55:40] manifest as sons of God you got to keep
[1:55:41] growing look at all these promises we
[1:55:45] got to grow into hidden manon white
[1:55:49] stones white raiment he's writing his
[1:55:54] name upon us the name of the city of my
[1:55:56] god being his son all of that has got to
[1:55:59] be manifested in the child entering into
[1:56:02] the adoption or that hidden place with
[1:56:05] God so in order to come into that there
[1:56:07] has to be a lot of work that goes in to
[1:56:11] manifest in that Christian way now in
[1:56:13] adoption for the remm said here in part
[1:56:15] 1 now Canaan does not represent the age
[1:56:17] of the millennium it only represents the
[1:56:21] age of the overcomer the dispensation of
[1:56:25] overcoming because in Canaan they killed
[1:56:27] they burned and they took cities now
[1:56:32] you'll notice that God told Joshua arise
[1:56:35] and go over this Jordan remember that
[1:56:38] all right now do you realize that in
[1:56:41] April which is about we're just a little
[1:56:43] bit past April now but during that time
[1:56:46] Jordan was 5 times its normal size that
[1:56:51] brother brems says here it looked like
[1:56:53] any good military leader would have
[1:56:55] known different than that
[1:56:59] and at that time there was no
[1:57:01] possibility of being able to cross that
[1:57:03] Jordan but remember God was there
[1:57:08] opening up the Red Sea with Moses and he
[1:57:10] said as I was with Moses I'll be there
[1:57:12] with you he calls upon God with great
[1:57:16] power God comes down and in their
[1:57:18] present crisis he opened up Jordan and
[1:57:21] they crossed over all right I remember
[1:57:23] Jordan in the month of April when the
[1:57:25] hills of snow was melting up in Judea up
[1:57:27] on that mountain up there Mount Hermon
[1:57:29] and so forth its icy snow water gushing
[1:57:31] through that muddy twisting river down
[1:57:33] there see that water coming down the
[1:57:35] mighty general Joshua and when Jehovah
[1:57:40] moved back they said that powder dry
[1:57:43] land glory walked him right across it in
[1:57:46] the month of April all right now
[1:57:49] remember the type here is Jordan
[1:57:51] representing death but represents
[1:57:53] separation that's where the believer
[1:57:55] must come he must first recognize that
[1:57:59] he's a sinner now taste some in our
[1:58:02] message churches we need a little bit of
[1:58:04] that kind of preaching going on amongst
[1:58:05] our pews because being born and the
[1:58:09] message has nothing to do with whether
[1:58:10] you got saved or not you got to get
[1:58:13] saved first you got to recognize you're
[1:58:15] a sinner and you need a Savior I noticed
[1:58:19] in Sister Jennison I'm so happy to see
[1:58:21] her still going for the Lord and a man
[1:58:22] and got a Bible in our lap just so happy
[1:58:24] about that
[1:58:25] see that's what salvation does for a
[1:58:26] person nobody has to lay hands on your
[1:58:28] shake you this way or grab your job
[1:58:30] makes a hallelujah speak in tongues just
[1:58:32] get saved and watch the Holy Ghost take
[1:58:36] over from there he knows how to do all
[1:58:39] this we just have to be obedient to it
[1:58:41] and God blessed his sister Jen I'm so
[1:58:43] happy to see the Lord moving in your
[1:58:45] life that and and and grateful that
[1:58:48] God's got some young people that can
[1:58:50] really represent Christ in this terrible
[1:58:53] age this terrible age and he made you
[1:58:56] redheaded that's good that's a good
[1:58:57] thing that little fire fire the Holy
[1:58:59] Ghost - there - amen
[1:59:01] how do you amen they go have to be some
[1:59:05] redheads in the rapture brother em said
[1:59:06] so he said to be redheads brown heads
[1:59:08] and whatever force there had to be some
[1:59:09] redheads there that's right
[1:59:10] alright so come down to Jordan the
[1:59:12] washing of the water the separation of
[1:59:14] the water by the blood all right being
[1:59:18] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to
[1:59:22] omit him or permit him into the journey
[1:59:24] see but now remember the Jordan River
[1:59:29] now I'm giving you just a little bit of
[1:59:31] what this is all about
[1:59:32] now the Jordan River is a source of
[1:59:35] fertility all right upon a large plane
[1:59:39] called kick origin which is a little
[1:59:42] spot right in through there with its
[1:59:44] like called the Garden of God right in
[1:59:46] that area where they have real luxurious
[1:59:49] big beautiful vegetation growing out
[1:59:51] there all right but in Genesis now the
[1:59:55] Bible just kind of gives scattered
[1:59:57] references to about this Jordan but now
[2:00:00] Jacob crossed the Jordan and it's
[2:00:04] tributary in order to reach her on
[2:00:07] that's in Genesis 32 and it is noted as
[2:00:10] the line of demarcation between the
[2:00:13] two-and-a-half tribes that was settled
[2:00:15] to the east there and numbers 34 15 all
[2:00:18] right in the ninth ribes in the half
[2:00:20] Manasseh the tribe Manasseh that led
[2:00:22] Joshua was settled to the west
[2:00:23] that's Joshua 13 and now in Bible
[2:00:27] history Jordan appears as a scene for
[2:00:30] several miracles the first taking place
[2:00:32] Jordan near Jericho when the Israelites
[2:00:36] under Joshua this is Joshua 3 15 through
[2:00:38] 17 and then the later of the
[2:00:40] two-and-a-half tribes settled east of
[2:00:42] Jordan and built a large altar on its
[2:00:44] banks as a witness now watch this now as
[2:00:47] a witness between them and them other
[2:00:48] tribes remember they piled up stones
[2:00:52] Jordan was also the spot that Elijah and
[2:00:55] Elijah crossed over on dry ground so
[2:00:58] even Elijah to perform that other
[2:00:59] miracle and it's also the spot when the
[2:01:01] axe head floated in the water were the
[2:01:05] children of the prophets threw that
[2:01:06] piece of wood in the water and so forth
[2:01:08] amen and the axe had floated right there
[2:01:11] in Jordan alright the Jordan was also
[2:01:14] cross
[2:01:15] the scene of a battle in which
[2:01:20] representing death representing
[2:01:22] separation is seen in many battles okay
[2:01:24] now now now you you take this type
[2:01:27] alright just just pull this all together
[2:01:29] in your mind and you realize that God in
[2:01:33] the very beginning they're just getting
[2:01:35] started and God places them up against
[2:01:40] an absolute impossibility
[2:01:43] now friends they're not even ready for
[2:01:45] this they've not been trained how to
[2:01:48] cross tributaries they have not been
[2:01:49] trained and how to fuel it across these
[2:01:52] places all they've got is a little
[2:01:56] experience in a little faith and just a
[2:01:59] little let me just put it that way just
[2:02:01] a little that's all they've got and now
[2:02:06] here's the great mighty general Joshua
[2:02:07] stand after this River could coursing
[2:02:09] down
[2:02:09] tens of thousands of hundreds of
[2:02:11] thousands of gallons of water coming
[2:02:13] down right in front of Moore he go and
[2:02:14] do hell I don't know well I know what
[2:02:18] Moses would do if he was here then
[2:02:20] Joshua Milo oh but as I was with Moses
[2:02:24] so he said he'd be with me now you see
[2:02:28] what I'm trying to show you friends is
[2:02:31] the Jordan River was a scene where many
[2:02:35] great miracles took place and this
[2:02:40] little spot right here God took his
[2:02:44] children right to that river again and
[2:02:46] again and again and again well I hope
[2:02:50] you get what I'm saying we won't just
[2:02:53] experience a Jordan just one time in our
[2:02:55] life and go Kru thank god that's over
[2:02:58] with you may have to repeat it again and
[2:03:04] again and again if you want to say this
[2:03:08] way generations of your life you may
[2:03:11] have to come right back up against this
[2:03:13] you may have an axe head experience you
[2:03:14] may have an elijan elijah elijah
[2:03:16] knowledge experience you may have Jacob
[2:03:19] crossing with this tributary of trust in
[2:03:21] the tributary with this group you might
[2:03:23] have all these different experiences
[2:03:24] they just keep wrapping around again
[2:03:27] and again and again and again and again
[2:03:29] how many times does the sunlight in the
[2:03:31] water rain down and beat down on that
[2:03:33] flower before it starts manifesting
[2:03:34] again and again and again and again all
[2:03:39] right then here in 1st Corinthians
[2:03:41] chapter 10 it said they were baptized
[2:03:43] under the Red Sea they were baptized
[2:03:47] under the Red Sea which Moses means
[2:03:49] drawn out his very name drawn out now
[2:03:52] then
[2:03:53] and that's Exodus chapter 2 verse 10 if
[2:03:56] you'd like to look at that where the
[2:03:57] child brought unto Pharaoh's daughter
[2:04:00] and became her son she called him Moses
[2:04:03] because I drew him out of the water and
[2:04:05] then he said they were baptized under
[2:04:08] that Red Sea all right now from the time
[2:04:11] they left Egypt going through the Red
[2:04:13] Sea now they go into the wilderness and
[2:04:16] there's a 40-year journey there and from
[2:04:20] forty years they come to the river and
[2:04:22] as they come to the river now they've
[2:04:25] got to cross over and Moses dies and
[2:04:30] maybe somebody might have said we ain't
[2:04:32] never going to make it you know and
[2:04:35] Moses got aggravated Adam don't you
[2:04:37] remember the story whenever they was
[2:04:40] going through the wilderness and you
[2:04:41] know how it is with kids in the car are
[2:04:42] we there yet are we there yet are we
[2:04:44] there yet are we there yet that's pretty
[2:04:45] much the way they've done Moses for
[2:04:47] about 40 years every time I'm sure I'll
[2:04:48] be there yet they about run him crazy
[2:04:55] but they were baptized sure under the
[2:04:57] Red Sea they were baptized what I've
[2:04:59] been baptized praise the Lord
[2:05:00] but remember there's going to be many
[2:05:03] more stages that's going to come to this
[2:05:05] adoption you cannot take the shortcut
[2:05:08] you must cross Jordan some things are
[2:05:13] going to go away some things are going
[2:05:17] to remain in other words Moses could
[2:05:19] type out in many different ways in our
[2:05:21] own life Moses could be a direct type of
[2:05:25] the help that God would allow us to have
[2:05:28] for a season you realize the Lord allows
[2:05:31] little helps and things in our life till
[2:05:33] we get strong enough to fight the battle
[2:05:35] ourselves
[2:05:37] we get discoursing I think in our mind
[2:05:39] well ten years ago when I was serving
[2:05:41] the Lord boy people prayed for me and I
[2:05:43] had friends I had this now I got nothing
[2:05:46] Moses my servant is dead now it's time
[2:05:50] for you to stand on your own two feet
[2:05:51] now it's time for you to go not
[2:05:54] depending upon the prayers of a Moses or
[2:05:57] somebody else like that to get you out
[2:05:58] of trouble when you get in it now God's
[2:06:01] gonna make you face the issue Alleluia
[2:06:05] oh you're getting quiet and they got
[2:06:09] nothing to do it being long-winded you
[2:06:10] just I know I'm writing the Tator patch
[2:06:12] that's right see all right now he tells
[2:06:15] us added option part one again is forgot
[2:06:16] forty-six he said now believers Caleb
[2:06:19] and that Caleb and Joshua outfit going
[2:06:21] on to the promised they moved over into
[2:06:22] the land took the land settled down in
[2:06:24] the land as a possession we never
[2:06:27] stopped at justification we never
[2:06:29] stopped at sanctification let's go on to
[2:06:31] the baptism of the holy spirit let's not
[2:06:34] stop at believing on the Lord Jesus
[2:06:35] being baptized let's not stop at that
[2:06:38] because he cleaned us up from a life of
[2:06:40] sin but now we pressed on into a
[2:06:44] position to the promise of the baptism
[2:06:46] of the Holy Spirit for this promise unto
[2:06:48] you them that are far off all right so
[2:06:51] the impressing on not just being cleaned
[2:06:53] up by the Holy Spirit but pressing on
[2:06:56] until when we come into our true
[2:06:58] position with Jesus Christ now let me
[2:07:01] skip for just a little bit and I'm
[2:07:03] coming to the end now and and and praise
[2:07:06] the Lord and hallelujah thank you Jesus
[2:07:08] for all of these great notes but if I if
[2:07:11] I try to go through every little
[2:07:12] scripture I got down here you'd be here
[2:07:14] this time tomorrow and and and and I
[2:07:17] don't know if Skype will let us stay on
[2:07:19] here this long in fact they might start
[2:07:21] charging this room and board if we keep
[2:07:23] this up for a little while I think all
[2:07:24] right now remember when Jesus calls his
[2:07:28] disciples let me just hit the highlight
[2:07:30] of this and then let's quit all right if
[2:07:32] when Jesus calls his disciples don't
[2:07:34] forget many of them didn't know what
[2:07:38] their position was how many remembers
[2:07:40] that Matthew was a tax collector now
[2:07:42] Peter was a fisherman all right and even
[2:07:46] afterwards even after
[2:07:49] Jesus calls Simon Peter the swatching
[2:07:53] with a second that Jesus is gone the
[2:07:56] moment Jesus is gone you know him and
[2:07:59] John rest I'm done
[2:08:00] they said I go fishing they didn't even
[2:08:06] recognize their position I mind you
[2:08:08] Jesus had already told Simon Peter I've
[2:08:10] give you the keys there he's standing
[2:08:15] with the keys to open up heaven close
[2:08:17] heaven
[2:08:18] he's got the keys in his hand to offer
[2:08:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to anybody
[2:08:23] that wanted it as many as the Lord our
[2:08:25] God shall call Jesus goes off to see him
[2:08:28] what Pete well I got let's go fishing
[2:08:30] what do you want to do pee I don't know
[2:08:32] I hear they're bitin pretty good down
[2:08:35] there on the Sea of Galilee they didn't
[2:08:39] recognize her position but I remember
[2:08:42] Jesus had already renamed him Simon son
[2:08:47] of Jonas I call you Petra Peter which is
[2:08:51] a little stone he had already positioned
[2:08:54] him remember the sons of thunder called
[2:08:58] him banan juries some of these people
[2:09:01] these disciples were the very ones that
[2:09:04] in the beginning never recognized their
[2:09:06] potential even though Jesus had placed
[2:09:09] him and positioned them and gave it to
[2:09:10] him how did Peter ever get to the spot
[2:09:14] to preach acts 2 and 38 he had to deny
[2:09:17] the Lord he had to be a cussin preacher
[2:09:19] he had to weep bitterly he had to go
[2:09:21] hide himself in shame he had to sit in
[2:09:23] the upper room scared to death they're
[2:09:24] gonna drag him off to prison he went
[2:09:27] through that whole process now all of a
[2:09:30] sudden they're sitting there reading
[2:09:31] their Bible maybe and he comes across
[2:09:33] Joel's prophecy this is that and with
[2:09:37] him he's in his hand he sticks the key
[2:09:39] in the lock
[2:09:39] opens it up and he realizes oh I got it
[2:09:42] now Holy Ghost comes at once this is
[2:09:47] that that was promised for this promise
[2:09:49] is unto you to your children as many as
[2:09:51] the Lord our God shall call it was a
[2:09:52] process but even Peter himself was the
[2:09:57] one that said in other words let me
[2:10:00] paraphrase it we love Paul but sometimes
[2:10:02] Paul is hard to understand
[2:10:05] now what I'm trying to show you friends
[2:10:07] is what brother Bram is teaching us what
[2:10:09] the Bible teaches us there's no
[2:10:11] shortcuts in this and don't shortchange
[2:10:15] yourself to say oh I'm a believer sure
[2:10:18] you are but take your time allow the
[2:10:21] Holy Spirit to develop things in you
[2:10:23] don't get it that's a hurry to be a
[2:10:26] manifested son of God this is the way
[2:10:28] you should pray Lord let me be ready for
[2:10:32] the things I need to be ready for and
[2:10:36] let me make myself ready for the things
[2:10:40] that you want to make me ready for
[2:10:42] because if we get in a big push and
[2:10:45] we're trying to push past something
[2:10:47] we're get in trouble no shortcuts
[2:10:49] through this we have to go the long hard
[2:10:51] road and it is it's challenging it's a
[2:10:54] hard way sometimes but if God be for us
[2:10:57] who can be against us all right standing
[2:11:02] your feet with me god bless you you've
[2:11:03] been patient you've been lovely you've
[2:11:06] been wonderful and I didn't preach too
[2:11:08] long now from start to finish it says
[2:11:10] two hours 27 minutes which means
[2:11:12] including the half hour silence I only
[2:11:15] kept you from start to finish about
[2:11:17] maybe an hour and a half give or take
[2:11:18] something like that all right you ain't
[2:11:20] gonna die you're still living everybody
[2:11:22] put your hands on your pulse you'll feel
[2:11:24] your heart is still beating a man it's
[2:11:26] still there all right you're in good
[2:11:27] shape now and and if your heart is still
[2:11:32] beating then that means you've got an
[2:11:33] opportunity to come a little higher move
[2:11:38] a little further I love you friends god
[2:11:40] bless you let's pray together can we
[2:11:43] Lord Jesus with the many knees that's no
[2:11:47] doubt associated with this little
[2:11:48] audience of people those that are
[2:11:50] visible those that are invisible I would
[2:11:53] be foolish to say within myself God come
[2:11:56] down and do supernatural great things we
[2:12:00] want that Lord but the longer I serve
[2:12:03] you the more I realize that things have
[2:12:05] to work according to your plan and your
[2:12:08] will and Lord Jesus if things just
[2:12:12] aren't associated with your plan if
[2:12:14] there's other reasons
[2:12:16] behind things we don't want to rush it
[2:12:18] Lord the second we get into trouble our
[2:12:21] instinct is get out of the trouble Lord
[2:12:23] sometimes you just let us sit right
[2:12:25] there because we have to learn we have
[2:12:27] to grow we have to develop from the
[2:12:29] things that we go through the Father I
[2:12:32] pray for your children strengthen every
[2:12:34] one of them give them your confidence
[2:12:36] your courage give them faith in their
[2:12:39] heart to stand there on the promise of
[2:12:41] God and grow until everything begins
[2:12:44] coming together just like I said they're
[2:12:46] about Jordan Lord we have to cross this
[2:12:48] area many times in our life again and
[2:12:50] again and again the Lord Jesus may the
[2:12:53] Holy Spirit take us in your great care
[2:12:55] wrap your great arms around us and make
[2:12:58] us one with thy Holy Spirit hallelujah
[2:13:02] that we might be able to step forward in
[2:13:04] march forward in the newness of life
[2:13:06] bless everyone visible and invisible may
[2:13:08] the Holy Ghost heal bodies touch minds
[2:13:11] encourage the discouraged save the lost
[2:13:14] do great things bring and restore the
[2:13:16] backslider every what it might be Lord

[2:19:42] the lord for the ministry of her brother
[2:19:43] being the ministry of the word and
[2:19:46] beneath your brothers sister that if the
[2:19:48] revelations that we need it the
[2:19:51] revelation that amen that that you need
[2:19:53] that i need that that the bride needs
[2:19:55] whether it's you here in this assembly
[2:19:58] or those at home so we give God the
[2:20:00] glory for our brother band he's been a
[2:20:01] blessing in the past he's been a
[2:20:03] blessing today and we believe the Lord
[2:20:06] to the Lord I receive a blessing to us
[2:20:08] again in the future so the invitation is
[2:20:10] there for our brother band to still come
[2:20:12] and to fellowship with us we would be
[2:20:15] wonderful if we could go to brother
[2:20:17] Bob's or paula marks and have fellowship
[2:20:19] with brother bin today a man but we look
[2:20:23] forward to that again the Lord willing
[2:20:25] and if the Lord tarries when it comes to
[2:20:28] the resurrection and the rapture so we
[2:20:31] thank the Lord for the further
[2:20:32] revelation of the word again I trust by
[2:20:36] grace that what God has brought brought
[2:20:38] us through our brother bin will put us
[2:20:40] on our toes amen
[2:20:42] to make our calling and election sure
[2:20:44] and to do it God's Way amen now I know
[2:20:48] that if I could I got three or four
[2:20:51] pages of notes here I could go on for
[2:20:53] another hour and a half or two hours but
[2:20:55] I won't do that so we think I was
[2:20:58] trusting that our brother bed would go
[2:20:59] on for at least another hour and I
[2:21:02] wasn't conscious of the time I just felt
[2:21:05] you know go on and on and on and on so
[2:21:07] god bless your brother Ben and we look
[2:21:10] forward to hearing your ministry again
[2:21:12] maybe the next time dude you'll be in
[2:21:15] the pulpit not brother journal so the
[2:21:17] Lord will bless you and our sisters
[2:21:19] Samantha yes Samantha god bless you for
[2:21:23] your singing as well so to God be the
[2:21:25] glory and again I appreciated the
[2:21:28] ministry on Friday Saturday Sunday and I
[2:21:32] felt it was a confirmation of many
[2:21:34] things that I've already preached a man
[2:21:37] a confirmation of many things that I
[2:21:39] have I have I lighted when it comes to
[2:21:42] not just coming in and saying I'm a
[2:21:44] believer again what is the prophecy the
[2:21:46] Prophet said he said oh you say you're
[2:21:48] really your believer you're in the
[2:21:50] message yes he said what the message is
[2:21:52] not in you and he was saying that to his
[2:21:54] two believers in his own church that's
[2:21:57] the truth and rather we can say that to
[2:21:59] a lot of believers around the message
[2:22:00] today they're in the message but the
[2:22:02] message is not in them they may it and
[2:22:04] we could to prove it we could go back to
[2:22:07] what our brother being ministered on
[2:22:08] that his last three services amen let's
[2:22:11] just make her call the election
[2:22:13] shortlist let's take it serious
[2:22:15] what God has brought us through our
[2:22:18] brother amen you will live when you're
[2:22:21] gonna make your call and election short
[2:22:22] base it on what you heard today racing
[2:22:25] on what you heard from our brother man
[2:22:26] these last three services Amen praise
[2:22:30] the Lord thank God he wasn't there just
[2:22:32] to say oh you're a believer so don't
[2:22:33] worry you're going into the rapture no
[2:22:35] no a man he was bringing out the word
[2:22:37] and what God is going to require of his
[2:22:41] sons and daughters amen where God is
[2:22:43] going to expect to be sons and daughters
[2:22:45] and again as the prophet of god has said
[2:22:47] he said the daily christ's are waiting
[2:22:50] on us
[2:22:51] they veil what are they waiting for for
[2:22:54] us to come through the revelation of who
[2:22:56] we are and he said God is waiting on us
[2:22:59] don't we don't go he's waiting on you
[2:23:01] praise the name of the Lord and brother
[2:23:04] it's been a long time now and God has
[2:23:06] been trading us amen
[2:23:08] God has been teaching us encouraging us
[2:23:10] a man to come to the position of sonship
[2:23:15] amen
[2:23:16] so that oh it's like like the folks or
[2:23:20] maybe it used to be on the Pope on the
[2:23:22] out there in the in the porch and it
[2:23:26] said that your name on the check is just
[2:23:28] as good as this amen
[2:23:31] amen amen why because we got the same
[2:23:33] authority because we are the sons and
[2:23:36] daughters of God by the grace of God
[2:23:39] amen so the devil the devil knows it as
[2:23:42] he said the devil is religious and we
[2:23:45] believe I've highlighted that a number
[2:23:46] of times in the service that God has
[2:23:49] laid on our hearts here so again thank
[2:23:51] the Lord for the word because we are
[2:23:56] sons a man and daughters please in the
[2:24:01] name of Jesus don't ignore your your
[2:24:05] position don't ignore what you are a new
[2:24:08] you are we got to have that faith amen
[2:24:12] oh definitely you're going to talk to
[2:24:14] the Lord you're going to talk to your
[2:24:15] father
[2:24:16] is it be old what manner of love the
[2:24:18] father has bestowed upon us now we
[2:24:19] thought why because now we got the
[2:24:21] revelation of father father father a man
[2:24:24] a man don't think about your natural
[2:24:27] father or your natural mother thing with
[2:24:29] your spiritual one but the natural
[2:24:31] passes away but the spiritual goes on to
[2:24:34] eternity praise the name of the Lord
[2:24:36] so God blesses a man will turn it to
[2:24:40] brother bow but let's sing the song o
[2:24:43] come and go with me to my father's house
[2:24:46] and God bless our sister Ida
[2:24:48] avancez the seer and again it was it's a
[2:24:52] blessing to have her with us and it was
[2:24:54] a blessing for us a couple of days ago
[2:24:56] to meet with our sister Kordell a man oh

[2:25:10] talking to us a man it was wonderful so
[2:25:13] god bless sister Cardella
[2:25:14] and also to say that our brother john
[2:25:17] Kadesh i feel that he has moved to
[2:25:20] quebec
[2:25:22] and his new address is Quebec but he's
[2:25:25] very close wherever it is in Quebec is
[2:25:27] very close to Ottawa apparently I think
[2:25:29] that's where he works and what things
[2:25:31] are going on and with regards to his
[2:25:33] education I'm not sure I'm waiting to
[2:25:35] hear from him again but he yesterday he
[2:25:38] said his greetings to all the Saints
[2:25:41] here and he expresses its appreciation
[2:25:45] for the brother Ben's ministry a man and
[2:25:49] because apparently he must but areas
[2:25:50] online and it was a real blessing to him
[2:25:54] a man so let's keep our brother John in
[2:25:56] prayer amen
[2:25:57] again to those who are not familiar he's

[2:26:28] these to the Saints here and He loves us
[2:26:31] he said and even any-any he was blessed
[2:26:33] by our fellowship and also brother Jacob
[2:26:36] Jonah from Ghana
[2:26:38] he says his Greece for the Saints again
[2:26:41] because they're having a hard time said
[2:26:43] there as we are here a man and
[2:26:46] apparently they're not they're not

[2:26:51] poor Church the same as we're not
[2:26:53] allowed to meet here they're under the
[2:26:55] same rules the same regulations and so
[2:26:57] on and again as the things are closed
