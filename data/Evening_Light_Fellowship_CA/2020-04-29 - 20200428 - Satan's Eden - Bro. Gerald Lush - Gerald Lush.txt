in the early days and we had something going on in the church you know this people had come in and they were kind of taking over and for the barriers there and he was preaching this time for the journalist Miguel and I bought for the bottling up to he was getting ready to go up to take over the service assaulters and he kind of said well I do you know to me and I wrote down and robert towne asked very I guess it was kublai delegating at all and then Bob got up and he and he sang 3:21 I'm glad I'm one of them because I wrote it in the book and right above Astbury and he just went up and sang the song that I wrote it next to yeah and it worked so he did nice berry I'm glad I'm one of them and one of the and the old only believed books it's still in there a Sperry and when I see there are people [Applause] [Music] yeah [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] [Applause] one [Applause] [Music] [Applause] those espeak [Music] Hey [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] they [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] one [Applause] so bad [Applause] [Applause] whoa [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise the Lord a man [Music] [Applause] so [Applause] [Music] again [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] what praise the Lord wonderful to see such an audience hey man praise the name of the Lord I trust the others are tuned in by the grace of God a man I'm praying also for the other ministry brethren and I guess across the cattle united states maybe around the world there's got a minister of the same way a man and again as I said our brother Donny Reagan felt bad because he was missing the people in the congregation and and I feel the same way a man I I come expecting to see everybody but then when I come out it's different that's the truth I I leave home thinking well well I'm gonna preach this to to everybody but thinking that I'm going to be looking at them but again I trust by by the by the grace of God that God is looking at them a man and I was expectancy sister Maureen I guess we were satisfied with the guitars a man so God God's grace to us in the land the Lord's blessings be upon us as we go into the word this evening and so they just to ask you to keep of course the prayer requests the ones that brother Mark requested tonight and also to keep sharing our daughter in prayer she's been having pain and she was due to see a doctor earlier but because of what's going on it was postponed until September it's a long time so unless of course maybe something comes up and that she's really got to to see it or something got to be done we pray the grace of God to step in amen so the Lord Lord be with her amen and we with the Saints again that are not here but with saints that are online and but even if brother Chad's online we won't hear is a man's or Alleluias if we do I guess somebody be complaining in in his neighborhood any man so the Lord bless him a man and the Lord blessed the other Saints as well our brothers and sisters the grace of God be with a man there might be some here or locally and there could be others across the island and the Lord blessed them and also just to remind you that we were hoping maybe to get our brother Carmen Carmen Mills to minister for us sometime and he's ministers in New Brunswick but when we'll be able to get a minister I'm not sure because he usually ministers in New Brunswick on Wednesdays and brother Carr ministers on Sundays so we pray there the grace of God to work it out for us and maybe if if we would like to get him the minister for us on a Sunday that he would be able to do it even in New Brunswick so and again the situation here of course is the same there that they they can't have the many in in the audience as well so I don't know if things are changing in New Brunswick or not they were I think Andrew Bosley was trying to change it so we'll see what what happens and the grace of God be with us and I don't know how much longer this is going to continue here where we won't allow people to come so we leave it with the Lord and to see what the Lord will will arrange we know that we'll just be on our guard let's be on our guard because this is this is a sign of the end and these things are going to increase more and more and more this is going to happen well after this is over something else could happen that's right so I pray the grace of God to to give us his wisdom and his leadership and we're going to take our stand for the truth they'll still take our stand for the word of God and again there were certain churches that though they were not allowed to meet inside there and I'm not sure what what kind of a church it was but they got the people to gather outside in their cars and in their vehicles in the parking lot and the preacher of course stood on the on the steps outside and ministered to them yeah and I notice also that there was a young sister that went up on the steps on this on the bridge we call it the deck as she played to get to her thing and the others were just sitting in their cars in the parking lot so God blessed them for taking their stand a man so we pray the grace of God be with us and I'm be honest praying grace at the Lord Allah will allow the Saints to get back into the into the assembly get back into the church amen for the glory of God so God be with us and the Lord help us in these last days we're living at the closing time so let's be on our guard amen they're saying only believe all things are possible only believe praise the Lord keep everybody in prayer only be only be all things are possible only be only Billy only all things are possible only be Jesus is here is here all things are possible [Music] Jesus is here Jesus is here gee recession all things are possible Jesus is here Lord I believe Lord I mean all things were possible Lord I be a man Lord i Bailey Lord all things are possible Lord I be a man Lord we're coming with a confession that we believe help thou our unbelief nor we're praying grace for the anointing of the Holy Ghost Lord is going to a race is going to rub out Lord any unbelief any doubt Lord to rub out any race any questions father that the enemy might put in our flesh might put in our minds father my grace that will believe the word that we believe it is written we believe thus saith the Lord a man that what you have revealed to us lordy in our hearts what you have revealed to us in our souls we believe no question Lord and no doubt so we pray in the name of Jesus for the quickening power father to make the word live in us to make the word alive in us make us Lord to go forth and follow to reflect the word so again Lord that it's not me that lives but it's Christ that living in me father it is the word that's being lived out in us that while there were Alleluia as Jesus was the word in flesh so now now we believe more that we are the word in flesh because of your anointing because of your presence because of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Alleluia more than you have promised Lord to make us and the word 1 so what I pray grace father that we'll have that understanding that revelation Lord and that we're going to yield continually father to let the word of preeminence in our lives that the word have preeminence Lord in our thoughts our words and our deeds so again that is not me it's Jesus is not my brothers in his Jesus and not my sisters in his Jesus amen Lord what a testimony well lord I pray grace in the name of Jesus than we are dead to ourselves and that we're alive to you we are so dead to ourselves father that it takes Jesus to in us it takes Jesus to reflect himself in us a man who is not our ideas is not our thoughts is not our motives not our objectives milord is Jesus father as he went forth reflecting the word God help us to go forth reflecting the word amen Christ in us the home of glory Lord that he laid down his life for us and picked it up again nor that we be able to lay down our lives and by the power of the Holy Ghost pick it up again in glory for the glory of God grace or God to be with us tonight grace to be with us in this auditorium grace to be with the Saints online or in the name of Jesus I pray for the moving of the Spirit of God Alleluia ever in our Lord that we need that anointing it is this our a man not flesh but the anointing of the Spirit so what I pray for the the anointing Lord in my brothers and sisters in their homes tonight I pray with the anointing of the Holy Ghost with us father though it's only been your just with five of us Lord that I gathered we pray in the name of Jesus nor that you're with us and that the angels of God are with us your angels as the Bible says in camps around about us to protect us that the angel is there with us tonight so the grace of God the will of God the Word of God and preeminence for the glory of God amen in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ a man and a man hallelujah now I believe no Billy amen hallelujah all things are possible now I believe daily No we hope things are possible now I be a man preach the Lord God lishus turn with me to Genesis chapter 4 the book of Genesis chapter 4 as we go into the word and again I want to go in and highlight what you heard during our last service as we heard the tape on Satan's Eden I wanted you to hear it but at the same time I want to highlight certain things that the prophet of God said and I trust that his that God has written it in your heart and in your soul so that we're not going to forget it but what I want yeah we need to understand this why we need we need to catch this because that's the enemy that we are dealing with it is Satan well we're so glad for the revelation of the word in flesh our Lord Jesus Christ but then there's the impersonation of that word and that's the devil a man and we go from and many are going from worshiping Jesus to worshiping Satan but they think that this is the deceit of the age they think they're worshipping Jesus they think they're worshipping Jehovah but they are worshipping the devil and millions as the prophet of God and I highlighted that quote to you in the in the previous message that the problem of God said there are millions and billions worshiping the devil so brothers sister and not only that just think if they're worshiping the devil they're just not up there there there are so-called religious people then they may be going to a church attending the certain church but and worshiping and think the worshipping Jesus they think the worshiping Jehovah but my wonder what reality it's absolutely amazing to think that they're worshipping Satan just think of that the Satan has so deceived the world and Satan as know not just the world of there but brother I know that Satan is deceiving a believer professing believer that says he believed this message to believe this they believe that but instead they're worshipping Jesus to worshipping Satan amen and they said that they're going to discover it at the end of the age when what when they missed the rapture and again they questioned the rapture I thought there was to be a rapture yeah how does anyone that's believable rapture those around this message and there's something we know of course there are those out there when it comes to Pentecostals or the my I can't the wonders of Pentecost out there United Pentecostal and so on but again there's going to be many many around the message that are going to ask the question and he's going to say to them what do you say to others he said yeah it's already caught me you didn't know it a man they failed to recognize and will bring that out eventually because there are some quotes that the property Lord has showed me regarding the rapture what the part of God was trying to remind us up and and bring to our attention that the rapture is not there the rapture is here and the rapture is not going to happen the rapture is going on now and he brought this out there even during the revelation of the seven seals and he said what was God doing he said he's giving us wrap through faith and what is right through faith it is the revelation of the rapture a man and it was tremendous some of the things that God reminded us of through the Prophet when he said the rapture is going on the rapture is taking place now a man just think that was over fifty years ago maybe fifty five years ago so I pray God we're not going to miss the rapture and brother when I said not miss the rapture let's not miss the revelation of the rapture a mayor Ezra's Luther caught the revelation of justification the other sanctification the bastion of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit grace that we're not going to miss the revelation of the rapture amen and this is way many are going to mister rapture because they missed the revelation oh they got a doctrine they got the religion but they don't have the spiritual faith for the rapture amen and the thing that not that we aren't going to be raptured I am being raptured more and more and more in more and more easier given turn it over to God God has taken control until eventually he was changed in a moment in the twinkling and I so God Elvis brother that we're not going to be deceived by the devil a mayor and a brother that we're going to be in God's Eden not Satan seed by the grace of God and in Genesis chapter 4 and I'll try not to be too long but again as I was thinking don't hold your breath he met and in Genesis chapter 4 and verses 1 to 4 PI and Adam knew his new Eve his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord but she had twins and this first one wasn't Adams it was a serpent and she again bare his brother Abel but just saying she said I gotten a man from the Lord well Satan was was was that there were her God because she believed him more than G OVA she allowed him to cause her to doubt what G / said they meant and it says an improv time know as she again bare his brother Abel and Ava was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering but under Cain and is offering he said he had not respect does God have respect unto our offering God ever expect unto your offering god grace to us amen again but under Cain and his offering he had not respect and Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell god bless his words you may be seated and turn with me to the book of Romans I share with you the scriptures then get to some of the thoughts and the quotes again on the message Satan's Eden and in Romans chapter 8 and verse 1 to 4 and there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus if you are in Christ Christ in you and it says who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we're not walking from the outside we're walking from the inside a man walking in the word for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh a mayor and for sin condemned sin in the flesh made in the likeness of our flesh a man and God in him and through him condemned sin in the flesh praise the Lord verse two again with the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death grace thank God for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh a man it is tremendous that he has forgiven our sins but as even more tremendous that he has forgotten them a man I don't know if you're aware of the young preacher not necessarily a message preacher but he's been preaching for a number of years but he was born without arms and without legs and he is on the internet and on YouTube and people are amazed that he would be a preacher people are amazed that he would believe in God being born without arms being born without legs but yet he's preaching the gospel amen and he believed that he is called of God and he travels around the world this is absolutely amazing because there's many a preacher brother that God has given arms God has given legs and brother they just not interested really and in going around the world not interested in doing this or doing that for God but this young man he is I would assume that he would be in his 30s now but he ministered one point there administered in a prison and that is online and he is ministering to prisoners and the chapel or the area where they gathered there are many many many prisoners and he well he can't stand behind a pulpit so they have to put a table on the platform and they place him on the table and he and brother and he doesn't have arms or hands to open his Bible so the only thing you God basically is one for well and it's not really a full foot but it looks like something sticking out there on and on the bottom but he used it as a foot and that's the thing that he that he uses to move his Bible around and the hope in his Bible yeah amazing absolutely amazing that he that he that he's there in such a condition but he's still preaching the word as God has revealed to him and and well as it was preaching all mine he struck them many many times and it cause of the just to applaud and clap and clap and clap and shout prisoners but the thing that really struck them was a statement that he made concerning forgiveness he said I want you to know he said that when you receive Christ as your Lord and your Savior he forgives your sin but he said I want you to know he said that he not only forgives your sin he said he forgets your sin he said you remember your sin but he doesn't well it struck them and then they just wanted to applaud and give God the glory praise the Lord hallelujah wonderful they had not heard it before he said your sin is forgiven and forgotten he said but it's it's in your mind it might be in your flesh but he said has gone from God a man because he said it is forgotten so it's again to remind us concerning the forgiveness in our Lord Jesus Christ why he condemned sin in the flesh a man and in the eyes of God according to your faith he doesn't remember seeing oh my lord I pray amen I pray that we got their faith amen then with all praise the Lord what I have confessed what I sought forgiveness for that he has forgiven and he met and he has cast it into the sea of his forgetfulness praise the name of the Lord Alleluia I'll tell you this the devil won't do that but God does it take the Lord the devil wants to remember but God doesn't want to remember so I pray grace as we approach God in prayer a man no matter what the need is there you go there with that revelation he has forgiven and he has forgotten and he doesn't look down at you and see that all your you did this you did this no no if you if you had faith it's gone he doesn't see it any man he sees all the I tell you what he sees he only sees the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ amen because according to your faith he has imputed the righteousness of Jesus to you he took your sins I put in the sea of forgetfulness amen and took the righteousness of Jesus and placed it in your life amen this was absolutely wonderful thank God for that faith ain't man so the grace of God there brother that we are righteous in his in his presence we are righteous in the kingdom of God by the grace of God and he said why he condemned sin in the flesh and verse four that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us amen and he should have walked not after the flesh but we walk after the spirit amen I pray the grace of God than what you do whether it's your thoughts your words and your dates you're led by the spirit it is the will of God that you're expressing God in your thoughts you're expressing God in your words and your dates really you're expressing Jesus that's right when it comes to the thought you think you're going to express now and to think and the words and the deeds a man it's reflecting Jesus what it's why the same way that Jesus would walk the same way that Jesus would think what Jesus would do in the flesh 2,000 years ago now he's doing it in you amen amen he laid down his life now we lay down our lives praise the Lord so amen Suites countries in control of our thoughts he's in control of our words he's in control of our deeds the Spirit of God the will of God controls thought word and beat god help us amen god elvers let go and the god of his way no wonder that Jesus did what he did they did it how much more we got to do it not my real father thine be done amen because there's a battle going on between the the devil and Jesus a man to control us in thoughts words and dates amen brother amen as I said before he can our soul God is in our soul crisis in our soul to control our spirit and through their spirit to control your thoughts and your failings amen because we said the poll of God has said he said your mind is is the what is the devil's watchtower he said the soul is God's Watchtower a man and there and there is a battle going on between the soul and your spirit the Holy Ghost and your flesh amen God is my God in your soul is controlling your spirit even the senses of your spirit a human spirit and through that he's controlling your mind and your senses and your feelings by the grace of God amen because why but he's got the devil to fight because the devil is in your mind the devil is in your thoughts the Devils in your fairies amen so by the grace of God we want to die more and more and more to finally more and more of our thoughts more and more of our words and more and more of our days are under his control a man is controlled by Jesus so that brother your thoughts are Jesus thoughts and your words are Jesus words and your dates are Jesus deeds amen this is absolutely tremendous brother if it's not me that lives as Christ said living in me brother then he's gay he's getting you getting more and more control of our thoughts words and deeds amen till one day we let go Alleluia faith takes control and we're gone amen and we're gone in the resurrection were gone in the rapture by the grace of Almighty God brother he got control of Luther and yet we know Luther still did this and still did that but he knew he was justified oh yeah many of many today they today Christians today wouldn't do certain things that Luther did I won't mention what it was but Luther T there's something to that but yet he went forth and he was praising God and preaching the justified by faith he was justified he had that faith amen my brother but then God went on a little further with John Wesley amen because amen the justification is good but now sanctification that's good that they said to separate you from their separate you from that amen to get you ready for the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so he would take this away take that away to desire for this the desire for that take it all away sanctification amen amen then you're ready for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen CEI will restore said the Lord and beginning with Luther you were going on - Wesley going on - the Pentecostals well that's good but as I said previously that it that he didn't stop with the Pentecost amen and the Father God said this is the problem he's a Pentecost he said doesn't read doesn't recognize the crowning of the Pentecostal message amen and it's them it was the Mary was the the ministry of a prophet wherein God came to crown the Pentecostal message now listen they oh yeah brother Aeterna this that even under the Pentecostal message they knew that the next thing to happen was the rapture oh yeah they believe the Pentecostal message was going to put them in the rapture but no the Pentecostal actually gave him the bed they give their faith for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit but not the rapture amen because the probably God highlights us what they got a what God's through the revelation of the mystery of God and of the opening of the seven seals he said God is giving the bride the revelation of the rapture giving the bride he's a rapturing faith Amen or brother gaga did God say oh yeah thank God for justification thank God for sanctification thank God with a baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit thank you Lord hallelujah you're there to minister to me you're there to help me amen yeah but now the Lord is looking down and he's waiting on us to come to Rajshri faith we wants to get us out of here he was doing all of this I will restore say the Lord he was restored this restore that bring so Rob Shri faith amen why because that's what God wants to do he wants to get us out of here he wants to get us back into eternity he wants to better get us back in the glory he wants to get us back into the kingdom of God not just obey a by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and experience he puts me in contact with the king no God amen he wants to put me in the kingdom and in a glorified body like unto his glorious body so brother we're not going to all my brothers sicilus really as understand that what we believe in what we are we're doing is the kept it's capstone of the Pentecostal message is the crowning of the Pentecostal message brother you can't look down your noses as I said first when I come to this word and only that they're believers are still doing and they look down their noses at this is their you know the Lutheran's and the Methodists and the Baptist they look down their noses at the Pentecostal don't do that amen brother thank God for what it was that they represent thank God for what the others represent amen bellowing brother listen we'll go on to the rapture amen so that God that's got me that is art affected my life what what God started in Luther what God started Wesley what God did in the Pentecostals has got the desired effect in my life what God wants to do in you and in me a million brother like we can we can't get into rap through faith without that no no no definitely not by the grace of Almighty God is God God added to this God added to that God editor that now praise the Lord hallelujah thank God for the Pentecostal revival yeah that's good but are you going to go from here oh well praise the Lord we got the Gibson and we got the bathroom of the Holy Ghost that's wonderful and we believe there's going to be a rapture well praise the Lord what's God going to do to get us in the rapture oh well he'll just give us a in in the Pentecostal revival they just thought we'll just get a greater and greater anointing no no amen it went through what God had done God was going to take him on to the opening of the word God would take a bird to the revelation of the mystery of God amen praise the name of Lord the old me of the Saturn SEALs revelation take a man in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished by the grace of God a million and it wasn't Pentecost and N and it wasn't Luther it wasn't Wesley it wasn't others amen but yet brother sister it was God and what and what's going on now is God but the same that is that's going to get fewer and fewer and fewer and terror a million the play went okay a guy a went to a climax and there was a tremendous Lutheran revival a greater Wesleyan revival and then there was a greater and a greater and a greater Pentecostal revival a man that went around the world a man but now what God is doing now is being rejected a man is not being recognized well they recognize that Luther Wesley Pentecost and the other revivals that God had they recognized it all this was God that was God this was wonderful that was wonderful and he went around the world but then come to Pentecost read the message revival for the opah the word to gave us a man give us faith not just for right or justification to give us faith not just with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit but to give us rapturing faith amen amen amen and the Prophet I lied said in the seven seals that the message the seals the mystery is to give us rapturing faith and he said the let us know the rapture is not going to happen the rapture is going on now a man sir brother how many of us are listen I believe this I'm gonna say many are being caught up the more we get the more that were caught up there further away from the world will get amen the more they were caught up by rat-free faith the more spiritual will be more spiritual will be in our thoughts more spiritual will be in our words and our dates a man brother knew oh my god Abbess but there's a lot of believers I tell you this brother God's not in their thoughts not by any means God's not in their words when God's not in their deeds no by any means but if you're dead its Christ I live it in you he is in your thoughts words and deeds a man you ain't man you think spiritual you're talk spiritual and you're going to act spiritual you're gonna reflect the word a million brother and yeah and when it comes to your brother and your sister and the Lord a man you're gonna be spiritual you're hardly glued to them a man no mind consider what Jesus did consider Jesus attitude a man consider the love that he had oh my even to the place where he went down to the way to the to the yacht to the well and and that woman was there and then he went over and he did this for this one he did that for that one a man and only that when when he was walking one time in in the city there and he look and here come here come a funeral oh yeah and they were carrying the body of a young man and it was behind was his mother that was weeping and crying because her son had died amen and then Jesus went over right all he had compassion and much company had compassion for that one how much world we'd have compassion for one another how much more are we to have lived for one another and concern for one another that your heart is going out Lord help brother so-and-so help sister so and so Lord she needs your help please Lord I pray in the name of Jesus strengthen that brother strengthen that sister encourage that brother sister where Jesus did it the why he should stop and he called the boy come boy and he rose from the dead just thing he rose from the dead and he and treaty turned him over to his mother amen there's no indication of no testimony that they're going to believe on Jesus note says way that they were believers or or that they were you know back in that day that they were going to follow Jesus they just went on rejoicing and praising God because why because too many back in that day Jesus was a prophet now that he was Messiah but they even though they though they didn't believe in VMs they believe many believe them to be a prophet who do men say that I the Son of man named he was a prophet but he was the god prophet but they never recognised that hey man but they went on well Jesus let him go on that's J whatever whatever was going to happen was going that Evan and brothers same with you and me brother I tell you this if we're the seed of God we lay down our lives for one another oh yeah we're there were there oh yeah to make sacrifice of one another encourage one another amen pray for one another old god I pray help brother songs to help sister stones the Lord in the name of Jesus Lord I pray your grace to give us strength amen what they need northern maybe they're maybe they're enduring this maybe they got a they got to suffer this but lord I pray be with them and help them amen so brother I know that if we got the Spirit of God if we got the spirit of Jesus if it's Christ and you you're going then you're going to add the thoughts of Jesus you're gonna have that you're gonna have the words of Jesus you're gonna have the deeds of Jesus amen but how many believers how many believers have we met how many believers call with over the years have reflected Jesus or they just William Branham or is it or not William Branham is that brother so-and-so no they told me the message they give me the message and sister souljah they give me the message yeah but what about Jesus it's like I've heard I've heard believers say you know oh I'm a believer I believe the message but again let me remind use too many believe in the message but they're not in the message whatever either the message is not in them they're in the message but the message is not in them amen brother they're those are their even even other other denominations there are those are there in Pentecost but Pentecost is not in them brother I experienced that when I when I was associated with Pentecost amen and as time went on it was getting more and more and more that were Pentecostal but Pentecost wasn't in them that's the truth and they were getting away and more for further and further away from the Spirit he wasn't controlling that it was really they were religious but they weren't spiritual oh yeah I began to see this happening you know when I was racing in the end a certain sand in a certain church and they were they were there were more spiritual people there oh yeah yeah when I mean I was just young and I was in in the church that I was raised in or mine the denomination and I and what was going on they were spiritual but it got to the place where they got more and more religious and less spiritual amen I recognized the day and as he as a young boy I recognized it as a teenager in Pentecost a man now I'm beginning to see it even around the message they are religious but they are not spiritual amen if they're spiritual than Jesus is in their thoughts Jesus is in their words and Jesus in their deeds and not just in your words amen there are those that can talk this and talk that but what about thinking what's your what's your thoughts a man and what about your deeds oh well I'm in the message yeah but the message is not in them I mean I know iíve seen believers out there I'm in the message I'm in the message I'm in the message well the message not in them how do you know that because why because of their thoughts words and especially not just a word but their deeds thoughts and deeds anything is not Christ not reflecting Christ anyway it's reflecting more and more reflecting their human physical feelings their physical emotions amen do not does not the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their heart in their hearts amen they might add the bathroom of the Holy Ghost in their flesh but not in their hearts probably God said you can be healed and go to hell yeah and you can add the bastion of the old it goes in your flesh and go to hell god help us brother that we can amen that people can be in the message and go to hell because the message is not in them amen why they're not spiritual if the message is in you your spiritual and the messages at us we are spiritual in our Saltz we are spiritual in our words and we are spiritual in our deeds not not and again oh well that person says sound spiritual well wait wait a minute they might might be just religious if you haven't got the Holy Ghost you want discern spiritual from read religious grace of God give us the Holy Ghost in our sin our souls so that would deserve spirits probably God discerned it oh yeah he would get in in the anointing of the Spirit and let the smitten let it take control and he would discern whether this person added in their flesh or just in in or in their soul we knew he knew no wonder that the Prophet was disappointed no whether he felt grieved sometimes during prayer during a prayer praying for the sick grace of God to us amen let the spirit and will of God be in our thoughts our words and our deeds amen are your thoughts the will of God are your words the will of God are your deeds the will of God or is it just human we don't with a little bit of religion oh yeah many like that god help us amen that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us well not after the flesh but after the spirit are you walking after the spirit are you walking according to the Holy Ghost amen you can get the spirit of a preacher you get a better brother branham on you you get the spirit of a preacher on you you get the spirit of this person on your that person on you but how many got the Holy Ghost amen on the inside the inside so it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen turn with me again in Romans chapter eight again but as verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen so the Spirit of God is controlling your thoughts words and dates amen you are the son of God you're a daughter of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but yet received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen you look at that God is your heavenly father God is your father amen amen and because he's your father he's really truly sincerely your father by the Holy Ghost that's why you go and you all you think like your father you act like your father and you talk like your father that's why Jesus he talked like his father act like his father a man a man he walked like his father praise the Lord oh yeah I sometimes I can I can see your your natural natural parents in you oh yeah in the believers not just here but I talked to those at home as well amen oh yeah I see I see the the nature of of the natural mom the nature of my natural dead or grandma or grandpa yeah see that well what I'm looking for is the nature of Jesus the nature of God in control amen all that nature is still there but if you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're born to get your new creature in Christ amen the nature of God the nature of Jesus takes control a man got more preeminence than that worldly nature grace for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for year not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you see the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen brother the new birth puts us in God's Eden religion puts us in Satan seen a man as spiritual experience with God is God's Eden a man religious experience Satan's Eden and if you're in God's Eden you're worshipping God if you're in Satan's Eden you be worshipping the devil this is on mothers is almost unbelievable but it's true no wonder Jesus would say certain things and then he said believe us though this what well I'm this and I'm there believest thou this what you're asking me to believe that yeah god help us do you believe who you were grace of God mother let's make sure we're not where we are in Satan's Eden but make sure we're not worshipping Satan as many many minutes unfortunate on our to believe isn't it we wouldn't believe that if we were in in in a denomination of church this church or that church disti nomination that denomination not years ago we wouldn't believe this we wouldn't believe that oh oh this is Satan's e and Satan is the god of this denomination they're worshipping Satan we wouldn't believe it they thought they were worshipping God well it's unfortunate again that it's even around the message some think they're worshipping Jesus but they're worshiping the devil why because they got a religious spirit and again this is why the proud of God I lights these sermons before the Lord took him home he was nearing the end of his journey but he wanted to leave these these thoughts with us amen he wanted to leave it with us he said now he said there's certain things he says not striking me the way that it should not striking you the way that it should but he knew that down the road it was going to strike them there was a generation coming and it was strengthened the way that it should grace of God to us it's is striking us the way that God intends were to strike us amen so that we recognize it and we're on our guard and maybe this is why the Lord is leading me to to take so much time on the god of this evil age and now Satan's Eden amen is to put us on our guard a man to be on our guard when it comes to the different spirits that are moving in the air remember he said there's going to be false Christ's false anointed ones yeah false this all false this one and then the prophet of God said remember it's not a false Christ it's false Christ he said anointed preachers yeah and they're trying to get to getting control over this one control over that one god help us that Jesus got control over us amen Jesus brother Brown said that's your problem he said you can't see the other angel he said I am NOT the son of man he said I am a son of man revealing Dees on me any man but he knew that they were focusing on him they saw him but they didn't see Jesus brother I trust by grace that they that was that we're witnessing to the world that we're living in is going to see Jesus in us amen there's a prophet as I lighted that we go in we get into glory amen and we're going to judge those out there that refuse to believe and all that I didn't see Jesus I didn't see this and he said he will reflect you on on the screen and him why he lived in you amen you expressed his thoughts his words and his deeds it was Jesus God help us Amy let's be on our guard by the grace of God in Satan's Eden be on your guard let's make sure we're not worshiping Satan thinking we're worshiping Jesus do i brother this is not coming that bad as a brother journal it's gonna be worse because jesus said if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved because he said it's going to get so bad it would deceive the very elect if possible it's a bad it is deceive the very elect brother had to be close to the truth it had to be close to the likeness of Jesus yeah religious or we believe this we believe this we believe that you know oh my or they must be Christian no the devil believes it but he's not Christian god help us as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear no God help us but you ever see the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father a may and our father father father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God not the children of the devil but his Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God by the grace of God we're born of God and if children that heirs and heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together Alleluia will glorified with Jesus by the grace of God amen oh my time Galatians chapter 2 amen Galatians chapter 2 Oh grace of God and just one verse there verse 20 god help us I am crucified with Christ how are we are you crucified with him amen nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me a man tremendous a million this is tremendous I pray grace in the name of Jesus that is the truth for your life amen that we are crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me amen and my thoughts and my deeds and my words is Jesus because in my flesh I wouldn't be able to do it but it's Jesus yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which ain't Alleluia the light which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God a million were governed by faith the Word of God Christ in us the hope of glory by the faith of the Son of God just like I live by the faith of the Son of God amen it's not me it's Christ in me no no not me no if you're a seed of God you're going to manifest it that nature is going to come out when he comes in the nature comes out he said as I live by the faith of the Son of God he said who loved me and gave himself for me praise the name of the Lord and he said in verse 21 I do not frustrate the grace God for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain no he didn't come by the law they come by the grace of God in our Lord Jesus Christ and the life we live is by the grace of God in our Lord Jesus Christ amen I trust you didn't hold your breath amen just share with you a couple of thoughts because one of the Brethren felt it was good that if I if I did God of this evil age and then Satan's Eden that if I went on to the anointed ones at the end time oh that's good that's good I said well praise the Lord we'll see as that see what the Lord lead us to do a man because the next mr. got here is 90 was at the end time brother it's a revelation of the what we're dealing with in the last days not in Luther's day not in Wesley State oh they had to deal with it but not on the measure that you and I got to deal with it no no because they knew Thursday was so small but God gave him the faith to overcome that and Wesley Said's the same thing the Pentecostal age more and so on but now rather we need it now under the resurrection and the rapture God's looking for more than justification sanctification and the baptism and the gifts cause looking for they perfect day yeah perfect faith amen what what do we need perfect faith for the rapture and Jesus needed to lay down his life and pick it up again now we need it to lay down our lives and pick it up again in the rapture and the resurrection amen why God's waiting on us now and the dead in Christ are waiting on us what for for the resurrection amen and the rapture are you ready are you getting ready are you spiritual or religious pray God that you don't have a religious spirit that you got the Holy Ghost amen and if the Holy Ghost in you he's bringing forth the word that we need for to give us rupturing faith amen what's ordained of God in these last days and it's it said that most believers brother are not conscious of what God's doing they know what God did but what's God doing oh well God brought us out of denominations into the message yeah but what what's he doing now oh we're in the mercies now yeah but what faith do you have the messages ordain predestinated to give us rapturing faith look like man look what Luther's message give him look what but Wesley's message give him the Perry castles work or what look what I give them what's he giving us grace to us amen maybe it won't be able to give all the quotes you heard the message brother sister if you if you got the book go get it and read it or if you got a tape call listen to the tape again yeah it's like I highlighted one time I preached and brother Danny also Church some years ago and I said look I said I wanted to do wonder do get the message this way I said little by little by little by little I said and so on I should see this I said I see see his underlying I said when I first read the message I underlined it what struck me I underlined this and her lying there and I said then I read the message again and when I read to mess it again oh I said I highlighted it I said it's it's orange highlighted there and I highlighted this I said because it struck me it is maybe it is strike me the way that I that I did when I first read it but it struck me after because why a man goddess adding to our faith our faith is increasing our revelation is getting more and more and more and I said oh look at this I said now is green well why because all I said when I read it the third time I said it struck me I said this struck me and I went and I are lighted it green and I goes on to another there's another color here and and it's yellow and so on different colors oh yeah green and and yellow not very much Sarah but it's yellow oh they they help that way well they've never heard that before I said yeah but I said don't just read it wants to say well I read it I read that message well go read it again because the first time you read it this struck yo that struck you the second time you read it something else is striking amen and the third time and go on or not why a Amen got us free destiny to God's foreordained a time for it to strike you a man as the powder gasa dis is not striking him the way it should never never struck them the way that it should but its generation coming that it would what for because that generation didn't have to go into rapture they'd be waiting on us to come to resurrection reffering faith amen brother Branham is waiting on us grace of God amen so brother god help us again like I said I won't be able to go in her and read all all of these things we'll see what the Lord will give just briefly he said I want to speak to you something to bring something easier to enlighten you he said the promise of God for this age meaning tell me in 1965 August that he hadn't preached enough to enlighten us concerning the resurrection concerning the rapture concerning his ministry because during the opening of the seven seals and so on no he said I want to speak to you something to bring something to enlighten to you the promise of God for this age what's the promise that he's going to highlight it's the rapture he says something he said not that somebody else in some other day but something for this day and he said those things are all right we all refer to those things but I thought I would try to bring something to your mind he said with these scriptures I've got written here and that would enlighten you easier to know and to make you a better soldier amen what after the opening of the after the preaching of of the series on Daniel as they're preaching of the series on the church ages preaching the seven seals he's now he felt that he had to preach this Satan Vidan that he had to preach this to enlighten us and I'll tell you this brother a lot of believers need to read it and read it and read it and read it and let it put them on their toes put him on their guard amen unless they be deceived by the devil lest they be in Satan's Eden more than in God's Eden lest a be worshiping the devil thinking they're worshiping God so he said I want to bring this to you and he said I would try to bring something to your mind with these scriptures and I've got written here that would enlighten you to know and to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now if we need to be enlightened then how much more do we need to be enlightened now and it's getting more deceiving and especially in the light of what's going on around the world I tell this bringing out a lot of things oh yeah in a lot in a lot of countries oh my oh my oh my where is faith well Jesus was right that it was so little he said when the Son of Man comes will he find date belief in the whole body of revealed truth you will find that much V very little of that could that that's what our brother highlighted here and in his notes he said when he can't really find faith and he said what faith is that he said it said belief him the whole body of revealed truth yeah no he's not gonna find much faith in that I tell you there's a lot of believers don't really believe believe the revelation of the whole body of reveal truth because it's why is there it's theater separator separate us separate us more and more from the world and the things of the world a may and make us more and more conscious of God but Jesus is in control of our thoughts words and dates more and more and more until finally we're spiritual from the inside out amen brother we wanted to separate they they'll separate from us their brother brother Brown did say the bride will have will have some friends oh yeah and Carlos ordained some friends there for the bride but it's not you're going out to them they'll be there to respect you oh yeah not believe what you believe but they'll be friends yeah but most people are pull away pull away or they're religious to religious no or not or spiritual or spiritual spiritual in our thoughts spiritually in our words spirits and our deeds hey men because I turn you this Jesus then control your thoughts okay with the devil is there to give you a wrong thought about your brother give a wrong thought about this sister wrong this one I thought of a Donald forget div segment those Sabres not the things that be of God get away she again has been on my mind concerning where the Lord told brother branham don't condemn that woman he said you can condemn what she does but don't condemn her he said some of them are my children amen he's called it a bride for the rapture but again they're not all lost God help us keep it right at it to keep the right spirit amen there's gonna be friends of the bride grace of God well one of these days we're gonna need them oh yeah we're gonna need him most you're going to walk away from us but there's gonna be a few there still respect us grace of God three siddhattha scripture said got written here that will enlighten you to know and to make you a better soldier grace God a better soldier the message Satan seen make you a better soldier so you'll know your enemy you have a greater revelation of your enemy your enemy won't deceive you grace a man he said better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now he said that you will learn the tactics of the enemy amen and there's a lot of believers have been deceived by the devil they never learned the tactics of the enemy and he says you can block everything before he gets to you he said that is the main thing to learn to keep the punches off you as much as you can amen god help you then when the devil punches you you'll punch him back get behind me Satan you can have that back but don't don't turn around and punch somebody else punch the devil too many punching this one punching that one punches this brother function that sister punching this this person that person no don't do that keep your attitude right keep your spirit right he said I don't believe there ever was a day that I had ever read in history there has been greater days of persecution when the children of God were put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we never had a day like this day we're now living it is the most cunning and the most deceitful day and when I see that it brings this that the question has to be more on his toes today than ever in any age why because the enemy is there with a religious spirit you take you take what you believe no matter how right it is in your doctrine and instead of a spiritual you make your religious it becomes a religion not a spiritual experience so the brother branham is warning us warning venom tabernacle of the age that we're living in of the deceitfulness of the if there's ever an hour that we needed to have the revelation of the sequence is this hour that we be not deceived please don't let the disc devil deceive you and your thoughts your words your deeds you can think wrong act wrong or or talk wrong you and then again you might see more this is all right that's all right no no it's it's not the will of God is it the will of God in your thoughts is it the will of God in your words is it the will of God in your deeds because we think oh well I I can do this I can do that I guess and they say that we say this we say something to be careful you could condemn yourself you know caught up mercy on us see God told the Prophet be careful what you're saying about that person because some of them are my children what yes not bright but they're gonna be there and again it's just like that in the restaurant you know you know the story that he was sitting there and he looked over and saw that woman sitting there at the table and I think her hair was dyed maybe and chopped off and wearing worldly clothes and she was and he was criticizing her yeah and that's when the angel called him aside and showed him the vision and brother Braun saw his mistakes going on what he made when he was young and he saw them going up and Jesus caught him it would have condemned him and brother Brown and the Lord told brother Brown we said there goes you but for the grace of God he said don't condemn her you can condemn what they do but don't condemn them god help us keep your spirit right keep your attitude right any man let's reflect salvation reflect redemption in our thoughts words and deeds a man he said now he said the cunningness of the devil makes people he should believe their Christians when they are not and makes them believe they're believers when they're not believers god help us that we love the Lord we love his word and we're living for Jesus we're living for his word thank you Jesus this is wonderful the Blessed hope that your word gives me of the resurrection the rest thank you Jesus don't leave me behind lord please I pray Lord that I want missed the rapture by the grace of God he said the cunningness of the devil makes people believe that they're Christians when they are not it is a more cunning day than it would be when you had to seal your life away with your testimony oh yes it's more cunning more deceitful now than it was back there when people laid down their lives physically God's asking us to lay down our lives spiritually mentally emotionally lay it all down and let's reflect Christ the most deceitful day that ever lived so close that it would deceive the very elect of God if it were possible for him to deceive is a world that is lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God I'll finish with this quote here and it's only page five amazing listen he said the god of this world today the worshipped person of this world today is Satan and the people are ignorant of worshipping Satan but his Satan impersonate himself impersonating himself as the church they worship Satan thinking that they are worshipping God through the church you know don't think you're worshiping God even in this church honest you've got it the revelation of him in your heart because it could be the devil deceiving you he said they worship Satan thinking that they are worshiping God through the church but it is the way Satan has done it a man grace to us people are ignorant Lee worshiping Satan he's a thinking they're worshiping God grace to us in the name of Jesus he said the deceitfulness of the church today he said the people he said worship Satan in this day and they think they are worshipping God but they're worshipping Him to accrete a man-made denomination creates that has brought the people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever known no matter how much the Word of God promised for this day is preached dedicated they still want leave it are they gonna believe Satan teen are they gonna believe the god of this evil page remedy really believe it and a lowered to put them put them on their toes put them on yogurt put you on your guard so you're gonna be careful amen to make your calling and election sure amen be on your toes so you're going to you're going to be on your guard what for to make sure that you're you you got the right thoughts great words and the right deeds and you got the right anointing of Jesus in your life that Christ is in control a man not a religious spirit not the devil a man not the god of this evil age Satan but it's gonna be Christ the God of righteousness and holiness amen so brother this is why God has got ordained the Prophet - what for - mitt it to preach these messages put us on our toes so that we're gonna be on our guard gray step oh yeah he'll not be deceived to believe that we're a Christian when we're not not me to say to believe that we're believers who were not that's the deception of the enemy just think he deceived it even in in in the Garden of Eden God's Garden of Eden he come down into CDPH just just think he had the word but he added to the word hey man no heat for all Ya Ya Ya God has said those then but those should he suggest should not surely die God said you surely you will surely die but I tell you now Adam didn't didn't wasn't deceived no no Adam knew what was going on but he put himself in seeing to save the woman just think of that praise the Lord the first Adam - singing at him thank God for grace amen I led to stop there brother sister grace grace grace do not be deceived in a world full of deception nor help us not to be deceived for the glory of God in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you lest an amen we're sing glory to his name and turn to our brother mark they meant down at the cross where my Savior died down where for cleansing from sin I cried there to my heart was the blood applied thank you Jesus glory to his name hallelujah there

also I would highly recommend and if our brother Matthew did it or not that he did text me a paragraph and the challenge was finds was it's 1616 Bible words in in the paragraph I found all 16 now and there were something that wasn't so easy to find so I would I was child as a brother to send it to all the believers a man see if you can find the 16 Bible books of the Bible and that's what it is 16 books of the Bible and there is one there that you should have no problem finding and that is job a man but you got to know the difference between job and a job a man so you'll find that that book it was good it was really really good it was a challenge it's very in a sense of this challenge to our faith when it comes to believing the Word of God a man and of course the first one the first book it
