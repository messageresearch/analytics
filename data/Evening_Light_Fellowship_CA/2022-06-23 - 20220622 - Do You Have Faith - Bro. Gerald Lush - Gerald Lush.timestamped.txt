[56:45] so god's grace to us all
[56:47] right and turn with me again to luke
[56:49] chapter 18 and let's begin to read at
[56:51] verse 1.
[56:54] i want to share some thoughts with you
[56:56] on the
[56:57] subject that our brother
[56:58] jonathan collette has been ministering
[57:00] on for a number of times and that is
[57:02] faith
[57:03] but i just want to go a little further
[57:05] with it and to take a different approach
[57:08] to faith
[57:09] and to go beyond just saying faith is
[57:12] this faith is that but let want to
[57:14] challenge faith do you have faith amen
[57:18] and his faith in control
[57:20] of your life are you governed by faith
[57:22] as the bible says sons and daughters of
[57:24] god are led by the spirit of god and
[57:27] brother if it's the spirit of god it's
[57:28] faith amen
[57:30] father it's all faith because without
[57:32] faith it is impossible to please him
[57:36] amen so brother i trust by grace that we
[57:38] have faith
[57:40] and we have the faith that pleases god
[57:43] amen well brother he's got it
[57:45] predestinated he's got it for ordained
[57:48] the faith that he that he wants you to
[57:50] have in the day you're living in in the
[57:52] hour you're living in and the age you're
[57:53] living in this is what god wants you to
[57:55] believe amen now i understand again by
[57:58] the grace of god that god wants the
[58:01] bride to believe this amen because he's
[58:03] given er of faith that brother sister
[58:06] he's not giving the others there's many
[58:09] others that profess to be christians
[58:10] many others professionally believers
[58:12] yeah but they're not all going in the
[58:14] rapture
[58:15] they're not going to be united with
[58:16] jesus as as the bright bride amen to the
[58:20] right group
[58:21] amen because why because we're going to
[58:23] be in the city we're going to basically
[58:25] make up the new jerusalem amen where
[58:28] others are going to be outside the city
[58:30] amen so they're not bright but they're
[58:32] still going to be there that's why i
[58:34] always try to encourage believers look
[58:37] keep your attitude right your spirit
[58:38] right to those out there because i've
[58:40] experienced it over the years
[58:42] but you know
[58:44] with fellowship with believers oh my
[58:46] they'd be looking down their noses at
[58:48] all of them are there and this one over
[58:50] there oh they go to this church they go
[58:51] to that church you better leave them
[58:53] amen and leave it in the hands of the
[58:55] lord amen
[58:57] because by the i trust by the grace of
[58:59] god that we'll see them outside the city
[59:02] amen and they'll be coming to the city
[59:05] just to fellowship with us we'll go
[59:07] outside the city to fellowship with them
[59:09] amen keep your spirit rape and your
[59:11] attitude right and understand again
[59:14] because again there are many that don't
[59:15] understand it amen that there
[59:18] many are called
[59:20] few are chosen
[59:22] but the calls are not lost
[59:24] amen so i believe that they're going to
[59:26] be there amen but there is he's got he
[59:29] chose the bride out of all that was
[59:31] called he chose a right amen so that
[59:34] we're going to sit with him in his
[59:36] throne praise the name of the lord oh
[59:39] the bible says oh there this is what
[59:40] it's going to bring there the bible says
[59:42] leaders and and
[59:45] rulers and so on in the world there are
[59:47] those that are going to be faithful
[59:48] they're those that are going to be
[59:49] christian and they're going to bring
[59:51] their glory and their honor into the
[59:53] city amen
[59:55] we're going to be in the city but
[59:57] they're just going to come in and visit
[59:58] and go back amen they'll live outside
[1:00:00] the city but i pray grace of god that we
[1:00:03] are amen we've got our we've got our our
[1:00:06] passport we've got what we need so that
[1:00:09] we oh yeah we we got access to the city
[1:00:12] oh yeah
[1:00:13] others don't have access they can come
[1:00:15] in and visit when we're there but they
[1:00:16] got to go back out again and live
[1:00:18] outside the city oh brother it's going
[1:00:20] to be a wonderful place and a wonderful
[1:00:22] spirit
[1:00:23] oh that's going to be wonderful do you
[1:00:25] think that there's going to be not going
[1:00:27] to be any unbelief there's not going to
[1:00:28] be any doubt there's not going to be no
[1:00:30] devil amen nothing nothing negative
[1:00:33] everything's going to be positive
[1:00:35] whether it's those outside the city
[1:00:37] whether it's the bride in the city it's
[1:00:39] going to be that positive spirit that
[1:00:41] positive faith amen that we believe and
[1:00:44] just saying
[1:00:45] why is it going to be like that because
[1:00:47] there won't be no devil there
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:50] he knows the time is short
[1:00:52] he knows his time is short or just what
[1:00:55] is time yes he knows his time is short
[1:00:58] do we know our time physically is short
[1:01:00] but not spiritually
[1:01:02] amen because we're going to enter into a
[1:01:03] glorified body
[1:01:05] by the grace of god please in the name
[1:01:07] of jesus have faith
[1:01:09] praise the lord we're not going into a
[1:01:11] dream no no it's not not a dream no no

[1:01:15] be a real city we're going to be real

[1:01:19] going to be a real king and we're going
[1:01:20] to be the queen
[1:01:21] amen by the grace of almighty god so
[1:01:25] shall god be the glory god help us to
[1:01:28] have that faith amen that pleases him
[1:01:32] brother it's the faith it requires of
[1:01:34] the bride
[1:01:35] he's not asking that faith of them out
[1:01:38] there but he's asking that faith of
[1:01:40] those that you have professed to be the
[1:01:41] bride you expect
[1:01:44] in eternity to go into the city live in
[1:01:46] the city amen to have to have the rights
[1:01:50] in the city god help us
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:55] and in
[1:01:57] luke chapter 18 verse 1 he said and he
[1:01:59] spake a parable unto them to this end
[1:02:03] that men not always to pray and not to
[1:02:07] faint amen always commit everything to

[1:02:17] you forget god

[1:03:56] and not only that faith has to control
[1:03:58] us
[1:03:59] it's not you controlling faith it's
[1:04:01] faith controlling you
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] and that's what i want to challenge us
[1:04:06] onto tonight amen

[1:04:36] question it
[1:04:38] if you might question this if it's
[1:04:39] revealed this is revealed that's
[1:04:40] revealed why why this why that you
[1:04:43] listen you don't question faith you
[1:04:45] follow it
[1:04:47] because you're led by the spirit of god
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:52] and again verse 1 and they speak a
[1:04:54] parable unto them to this end that men
[1:04:57] not always to pray
[1:04:59] and not to faint
[1:05:01] let's not faint or get weak in our faith
[1:05:04] saying there was in a city a judge
[1:05:07] which feared not god
[1:05:09] neither regarded man
[1:05:12] and there was a widow in that city and
[1:05:14] she came unto him saying avenge me of
[1:05:17] mine adversary
[1:05:20] and he would not for a while but
[1:05:23] afterward he said within himself though
[1:05:25] i fear not god
[1:05:27] nor regard man yet because this widow
[1:05:30] troubleth me
[1:05:32] i will avenger
[1:05:34] lest by
[1:05:37] her continual coming she weary me
[1:05:40] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[1:05:43] judge saith
[1:05:45] and shall not god avenge his own elect
[1:05:49] which cried day and night unto him amen
[1:05:54] are we calling on the lord
[1:05:56] morning noon and night
[1:05:58] are we in fellowship with him are we in
[1:06:00] contact with him amen
[1:06:02] because why in this world we constantly
[1:06:05] have need of him
[1:06:06] amen
[1:06:08] and brother we get out of this world
[1:06:09] we're going to need him
[1:06:10] we need him to take us all through this
[1:06:12] through this through this
[1:06:14] amen when we get into eternity we'll
[1:06:16] need him
[1:06:17] amen praise the lord
[1:06:19] so brother i pray grace that we have a
[1:06:22] real real real faith amen that we truly
[1:06:26] believe god
[1:06:27] amen and that faith is controlling us
[1:06:31] we're not controlling it
[1:06:33] amen
[1:06:35] so brother and shall not god avenge his
[1:06:37] own elect which cry day and night unto
[1:06:40] him though he bear long with them
[1:06:44] i tell you that he will avenge them
[1:06:46] speedily
[1:06:48] nevertheless
[1:06:49] when the son of man cometh shall he find
[1:06:53] faith
[1:06:54] on the earth
[1:06:56] amen
[1:06:58] god's grace that he's finding that faith
[1:07:00] in you and me
[1:07:01] god bless you you may be seated
[1:07:05] turn with me to
[1:07:06] romans chapter 1
[1:07:09] share with you some scriptures
[1:07:11] concerning faith
[1:07:18] and again the faith not just
[1:07:20] a faith that says well i believe in god
[1:07:24] oh and i i believe the message
[1:07:26] brother it's a faith that controls us
[1:07:29] amen it's a faith that governs us it's a
[1:07:32] faith that leads us
[1:07:33] amen and it's just not us saying well i
[1:07:36] believe in god and and i believe the
[1:07:38] message i believe this is this is right
[1:07:40] here the the the prophet and what he
[1:07:42] preached there what he said there and
[1:07:44] what god said here in the bible amen
[1:07:47] brother it goes beyond just saying i
[1:07:50] believe it it goes it goes to the extent
[1:07:52] to the to the to the opportunity where
[1:07:55] it controls you
[1:07:56] amen
[1:07:57] do you i tell you that that proves
[1:07:59] whether or not you really really believe
[1:08:01] it if it controls you and if it governs
[1:08:04] all that you do
[1:08:06] morning noon and night
[1:08:07] amen because i tell you this that we are
[1:08:10] the seed of god we are the sons and
[1:08:12] daughters of god there's no way that we
[1:08:14] can we can we forget god there's no way
[1:08:17] that we can go through the day and not
[1:08:19] think about god no way we can go through
[1:08:21] a day and not talk to god amen
[1:08:24] and not not consider eternity and not
[1:08:26] consider
[1:08:27] well the new heaven and the new earth
[1:08:29] not just going to heaven but going to a
[1:08:31] new heaven and a new earth by the grace
[1:08:34] of god
[1:08:35] but because that's where we come from
[1:08:36] and that's where we want to get back to
[1:08:38] amen so i pray the grace of god help us
[1:08:41] to have that faith that pleases god
[1:08:44] amen the faith that pleases god is not
[1:08:47] just to say i believe that i believe
[1:08:49] genesis 1 and i believe this right there
[1:08:51] i believe this this doctrine right here
[1:08:53] oh yeah i believe that right there in
[1:08:54] revelation
[1:08:55] brother do we believe the plan purpose
[1:08:58] and pattern of god amen are we there to
[1:09:01] promote the plan and the purpose and the
[1:09:04] pattern of god are we there to to to
[1:09:06] constantly give ourselves into his under
[1:09:09] his control and say lord not my will
[1:09:12] thing be done
[1:09:13] amen we're here to live for him we're
[1:09:15] here to do what he wants us to do amen
[1:09:18] when he wants us to do it where he wants
[1:09:20] us to do it and how he wants us to do it
[1:09:22] so is god in control of your life amen
[1:09:26] well i got faith but i'm talking but if
[1:09:29] you really got the real faith that god
[1:09:32] wants you to have he's in control
[1:09:34] because lord brother sister too to have
[1:09:36] that faith he has to control
[1:09:39] your thoughts your words and brother if

[1:25:41] jesus praise the lord and brother he
[1:25:44] comes to give you that revelation
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:48] he comes
[1:25:50] to convict you of your need of him
[1:25:53] and brother if he justifies us amen
[1:25:56] by the faith of jesus we're justified
[1:25:59] amen by the grace of god we need jesus
[1:26:03] he sanctifies us we need him
[1:26:05] amen

[1:26:13] the seed of god sons and daughters of
[1:26:15] god this is true that it's not you
[1:26:17] living it's jesus living in you
[1:26:20] that's i am
[1:26:22] is that your your nature
[1:26:25] when you act a certain way you react in
[1:26:28] a certain way is it jesus
[1:26:30] are you really conscious
[1:26:34] of jesus
[1:26:35] are you really conscious of your godly
[1:26:37] nature
[1:26:40] most are not they're conscious of
[1:26:41] doctrines and theology but not their
[1:26:44] nature
[1:26:46] and brother without this
[1:26:48] you're not going to eternity
[1:26:51] without this you'll not be you'll never
[1:26:52] be in the resurrection you won't be in
[1:26:54] the rapture
[1:26:58] you've got to have the nature of jesus
[1:27:00] amen
[1:27:02] to identify with the resurrection
[1:27:04] and the rapture

[1:28:40] by the grace of god
[1:28:42] there's too many
[1:28:44] controlling their faith
[1:28:46] it's just doctrine

[1:35:15] experience this in dealing with man and
[1:35:17] and being rejected by man and by brother
[1:35:21] god also predestinated it so that we
[1:35:23] would have to bring out this you bring
[1:35:25] out this in you bring up that in me look
[1:35:27] what he brought out in himself in jesus

[1:36:10] christians
[1:36:11] laid down their lives
[1:36:13] they were killed
[1:36:16] because they were christians
[1:36:18] because they took their stand
[1:36:21] for the word in their day

[1:36:43] faith that we will need in that hour
[1:36:48] that we have the faith wherein that we

[1:37:18] trust they do did he know your your
[1:37:20] faith

[1:37:49] god help us
[1:37:54] let's see
[1:37:55] galatians chapter 2
[1:37:59] verse 17 again
[1:38:01] but if while we seek to be justified by
[1:38:03] christ we ourselves also are found
[1:38:06] sinners is therefore christ the minister
[1:38:09] of sin
[1:38:10] god forbid
[1:38:12] for if i build again
[1:38:14] the things which i destroyed i make
[1:38:17] myself a transgressor
[1:38:20] why through the law am dead to the law
[1:38:23] that i might live unto god
[1:38:26] amen oh brother sister
[1:38:29] are you living for god
[1:38:32] are you living for god
[1:38:33] do you know god
[1:38:35] do you really know
[1:38:37] do you really have fellowship with him
[1:38:41] when you humble yourself in the in in
[1:38:43] the evening
[1:38:44] the day is over it's finished you really
[1:38:46] humble yourself they to thank god for
[1:38:49] for what he did for you for his grace to
[1:38:51] you through the day
[1:38:52] did you or did you experience any grace
[1:38:54] through the day
[1:39:00] amen
[1:39:01] i pray grace to us
[1:39:03] amen that at the end of the day we want
[1:39:05] to thank god for grace
[1:39:08] amen
[1:39:09] thank god for
[1:39:11] for helping us strengthen us encouraging
[1:39:14] us amen protecting us
[1:39:17] oh what do you protect us from
[1:39:21] well
[1:39:22] ask the lord you
[1:39:24] let him know
[1:39:26] he'll let you know
[1:39:28] amen oh brother
[1:39:31] see that you may you
[1:39:33] you may go through the day and think oh
[1:39:35] no well the lord didn't do this oh yes
[1:39:37] he did
[1:39:38] there are things that the devil would
[1:39:40] would have done to you and if god wasn't
[1:39:42] on the scene
[1:39:43] you you pay a big price
[1:39:46] oh yes because i tell you this the
[1:39:48] devil's come down with great wrath
[1:39:50] knowing his time is short and brother i
[1:39:53] tell you the devil is there to attack
[1:39:55] the believer
[1:39:57] but the angels of god are there god is
[1:39:59] there to protect you
[1:40:02] so don't think oh well i went through
[1:40:04] the day nothing happened this didn't
[1:40:05] happen that didn't happen that's right
[1:40:08] why because of the grace of god
[1:40:11] because if god was there to protect you
[1:40:13] the angels of god were there to protect
[1:40:15] you
[1:40:17] and brother if they weren't oh what you
[1:40:19] would endure
[1:40:20] what the devil would do to you
[1:40:22] brother let's thank god for his grace
[1:40:24] through the day
[1:40:27] amen
[1:40:30] we take things too
[1:40:32] many believers take things too lightly
[1:40:37] yeah
[1:40:38] but i tell you if you really got the
[1:40:41] revelation
[1:40:42] of redemption of salvation
[1:40:44] oh no you don't take anything lightly
[1:40:46] thank you jesus
[1:40:47] that you brought me through this day
[1:40:51] yeah
[1:40:52] or don't take it for granted oh that's
[1:40:55] all right i just made it through the day
[1:40:57] that's all right
[1:40:58] don't own by yourself say thank you
[1:41:00] jesus
[1:41:02] why because the devil was there
[1:41:05] oh yeah but god was there to protect you
[1:41:07] from the devil
[1:41:11] don't think you oh
[1:41:13] i never had no problems and i read this
[1:41:15] why
[1:41:16] i pray god that you got the
[1:41:17] understanding the revelation
[1:41:21] of what he has done and what he's doing
[1:41:22] to protect you
[1:41:25] just think
[1:41:28] if he didn't protect you what would
[1:41:30] happen to you
[1:41:32] thank god for such grace
[1:41:35] amen
[1:41:41] so he said again in verse 17 if while we
[1:41:43] seek to be justified by christ we
[1:41:45] ourselves also are found sinners is
[1:41:47] therefore christ the minister of sin god
[1:41:50] forbid amen and if i build for again the
[1:41:54] things which i destroyed i make myself a
[1:41:56] transgressor
[1:41:58] he said for i through the law am dead to
[1:42:00] the law that i might live unto god amen
[1:42:03] yes live to the lord
[1:42:06] and verse 20 he said i am crucified with
[1:42:09] christ
[1:42:10] nevertheless i live
[1:42:13] why because we got his resurrection
[1:42:16] power is anointing
[1:42:17] yet not i
[1:42:19] but christ liveth in me
[1:42:22] praise the lord
[1:42:23] and the life which i now live in the
[1:42:26] flesh i live by the faith
[1:42:29] of the son of god
[1:42:31] oh grace brother
[1:42:33] that we have his faith
[1:42:35] amen
[1:42:36] considering his faith what he did
[1:42:39] for us and what he's doing we need that
[1:42:42] faith
[1:42:44] hallelujah
[1:42:48] so he said and the life which i now live
[1:42:50] in the flesh i live by the faith of the
[1:42:53] son of god
[1:42:55] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:43:00] amen
[1:43:01] by grace
[1:43:03] so he said i do not frustrate the grace
[1:43:05] of god for if righteousness come by the
[1:43:08] law then christ is dead in vain
[1:43:12] but
[1:43:12] it came by grace
[1:43:14] not the law
[1:43:15] it came by the love of god
[1:43:17] not the law amen and he
[1:43:21] voluntarily laid down his life and was
[1:43:23] crucified that we would live
[1:43:26] amen
[1:43:27] and we would experience
[1:43:29] his faith
[1:43:31] and it says
[1:43:33] i now live in the flesh
[1:43:35] i live by the faith of the son of god
[1:43:40] who loved me
[1:43:41] and gave himself for me thank you jesus
[1:43:45] praise the name of the lord go with me
[1:43:47] to another scripture to
[1:43:50] ii peter chapter 1
[1:43:54] 2 peter chapter 1.
[1:44:00] again wanting to emphasize
[1:44:05] perfect faith
[1:44:06] wanting to emphasize faith that controls
[1:44:09] us
[1:44:11] amen
[1:44:12] it's not just to think about what is
[1:44:14] your faith well i believe this i believe
[1:44:16] this i believe that when it comes to
[1:44:18] doctrine and and theology no no
[1:44:22] faith
[1:44:23] is christ in us
[1:44:25] amen controlling us
[1:44:28] praise the lord
[1:44:29] so brother not you controlling faith but
[1:44:32] let faith control you
[1:44:37] and what is faith
[1:44:38] faith is a firm conviction
[1:44:42] producing a full acknowledgement of
[1:44:45] god's revelation
[1:44:48] and truth
[1:44:49] do we have that firm conviction
[1:44:52] amen by the holy ghost
[1:44:54] producing a full acknowledgement of
[1:44:57] god's truth god's word god's revelation
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:01] yes our faith is our personal surrender
[1:45:04] to jesus
[1:45:06] amen we have surrendered to him
[1:45:09] amen our faith
[1:45:12] is the life inspired
[1:45:15] by surrendering to jesus
[1:45:17] amen
[1:45:19] the life you reflect
[1:45:21] is a testimony that you have surrendered
[1:45:23] to him
[1:45:24] amen it's not you in control it's jesus
[1:45:27] in control
[1:45:28] not you that lives is christ living in
[1:45:30] you just think of that no matter what
[1:45:32] you're doing where you're going is
[1:45:33] christ in you
[1:45:35] the job you're doing is jesus doing it
[1:45:39] if it's not you that lives christ lives
[1:45:40] in you your brother is controlling
[1:45:43] what you're doing how you do it when you
[1:45:45] do it where you do it
[1:45:48] that's why that
[1:45:50] oh yeah
[1:45:51] you're not gonna you're you're gonna be
[1:45:53] different from all the others that you
[1:45:54] work with

[1:45:57] the others that you that you have
[1:45:59] fellowship with sometimes out there in

[1:53:28] chapter 2
[1:53:32] first peter chapter 2
[1:53:35] and verse 21.
[1:53:41] for even iran to were ye called because
[1:53:44] christ also suffered for us
[1:53:46] leaving us an example
[1:53:49] that ye should follow his steps
[1:53:53] so we're following the steps of jesus
[1:53:57] and brother it's not just following a
[1:53:59] man's this man or following this woman
[1:54:02] you know what no no
[1:54:04] it's the following the steps of jesus
[1:54:07] amen
[1:54:08] let's go back in
[1:54:10] you can go back rather and just just
[1:54:12] read the gospels
[1:54:15] wherein they give the give the
[1:54:16] revelation of jesus in matthew mark luke
[1:54:19] john
[1:54:20] amen and let's compare our lives to the
[1:54:23] life of jesus
[1:54:26] compare our attitude to jesus attitude
[1:54:29] our actions and reactions to his
[1:54:32] is tremendous
[1:54:35] oh well we can't live that life can we

[1:55:14] hereunto were ye called because christ

[1:55:48] not just committed himself to him
[1:55:52] that judges righteously
[1:55:55] who his own self bear our sins in his
[1:55:58] own body on the tree that we being dead
[1:56:01] to sins should live unto righteousness
[1:56:04] by whose stripes ye were healed
[1:56:08] i pray grace lord through the power
