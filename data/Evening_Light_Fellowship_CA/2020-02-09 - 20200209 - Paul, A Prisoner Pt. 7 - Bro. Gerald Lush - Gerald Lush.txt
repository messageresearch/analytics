Myers history back of course and brother honey and just a lily amen oh yes sister ina or bless you amen so keep keep on another in prayer even the Saints than out here and especially here for the Paul and sister Kimberly amen so it's a new world for them most definitely it's not only a new bro but it's gonna be a challenge to them they met because they got more responsibility now God's gonna require more of them a man today than he did before then so the Lord God's grace to a brother called Paul and sister Kimberly and to the Saints not able to come today the Lord bless them so we'll see I was thinking maybe a ministry on a certain subject and I ministered on a many many years ago I think was an empire avenue the church that was there but maybe what we'll do first we'll hear the problem of God preached on it and know that I've ministered maybe a number of times on it back many years ago and the tapes might be in the basement because it was it was tapes they're not CDs and definitely not DVDs now we're living in a very changing world a man so we're pretty grace of God that it says the world changes we're changing he meant but we're changing from time to eternity the world is going from going from time to hell and we would pray the grace of boy because God says go make a new heaven and a new earth amen and I don't know but how many believers are really really looking for it but I'm hungry and thirsting for the new heaven and the new earth I'm tired of this one oh brother journal journal you're just getting old or brothers not it's not old age it's it's spiritual revelation you have the Holy Ghost brother as Jesus was only 33 years old and 33 yeah and he was longing to get out of here yeah and he was popular among certain above the disciples back then oh yeah he did science he did wonders never fall following Jesus or do this do this do this well come to the end of his ministry so I believe that we're coming to the end of the ministry again amen it was the end of new Thurs ministry the end of Wesley's ministry the end of William Booth ministry and many other preachers the end of the Pentecostal ministries but decay man in to the ministry of Malecha Malachi 4 oh well it's in the bride now well our ministry's coming to an end yeah it's finished I received an email from a brother and he had listed all that all that's going on in the world negatively and all the people that have died with this died with that died with this die with that millions and millions of millions and I said Lord I said that's the germ warfare the Prophet warned us up they met and brother was not going to come it's here now and a number of years ago brother George Smith his sister Rebecca they did they did an article in the India monthly letters on the germ warfare and they said it's not going to be new new germs or new new this and new that it's going to be the old are going to come back a man and they are because they were highlighting certain things a certain number of people that had died as a result of a certain disease it was one of the old fashioned diseases but but they're coming back and man is getting less and less control over it yeah so the grace of God be with us brother let's make sure that we're under the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen not religious leadership but brother it's gotta be old ego spiritual leadership by the grace of God a man so we're going to hear brother ran on minister and it's just less than an hour and a half for short and minister on leadership and he preached it in december the 7th 1965 and that's just a couple of weeks before the Lord took him home they met and brother he also ministered in November a message called the invisible Union and he was getting harder and harder and harder and brother in leadership is in California on the end of message invisible Union of the bride it was in Shreveport Louisiana brother Jack Morris Church and brother this was the service that he began with and it was being broadcast over two by telephone back then to a lot of other churches and after brother Brown finish preaching on the invisible Union the bright Oh brother Jack Moore got a number of calls it says don't let william branham preach again and well don't let him preach the next service the next service and but and brother Jack Moore went everywhere looking for William Branham oh yeah he thought he was in that hotel but he had moved out of that hotel to a cheaper one yeah and he couldn't find him he went everywhere looking for William Branham where is he where is he couldn't find him so when the time came for the service he brother Bell was there to preach because why because brother Jack Moore never found him and never met him to say brother we won't have you preach now thank you for what you did and so on no so brother Brown went on and preached another four or five messages hey man a brother he was getting was getting to the place where he was being totally told like Jesus totally rejected a man and again the religious people are there even the evangelists out there the denominations are there they were crucifying Christ was not winner Branum it was the word he met they were against the word so we thank God that the Lord allowed him to go on and minister on the other subjects a man very important so the Lord blesses and we pray the grace of God bless us in the message on the leadership and again I think this was the second last message before the Lord called him home bear with me yes he preached leadership and the last message he preached was communion yeah and yet you got believers taking what we don't we did we don't have to take communion to mark what they should go the last message was on communion and brother exhorted it that we got we got to take it and as I said as long as we're in this flesh we need to take it yeah till we get out of this and into glory amen thank God for his word brother this less saying only believe all things are possible only believe Oh all evilly [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] honestly and sincerely believe father not religiously but spiritually I believe in Lord history what we're believing or the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ nor that you are the Living God and that you are the same yesterday today and forever you're the Living God then you're the Living God now you're the Living God tomorrow and nor we're looking for the change to bring us into the presence of the Living God so we're praying the Grace and and the anointing and presence of the Living God in us a man father bringing for that change for the resurrection that changed for the rapture that changed to get at a time and into eternity that changed more that we're going to sit with you in your throne a man the change Lord that we're going to hallelujah we're going to partake of the marriage supper of the Lamb to God be the glory so Lord we're asking for your 90 of your presence Alleluia the Living God with us the Living God in us a man that had the Living God giving us the faith that we need in this late hour so what I pray in the name of Jesus Christ father for the moving of the Spirit and their going forth of the word father to give us the faith that pleases you father today father a man we know the faith that pleased you yesterday we know the faith that you're looking for tomorrow but father grace that we'll have the faith that you're looking for today amen father that we are that that see God we are the sons and daughters of God hallelujah and Lord we're looking for honoring for thirsting for father one you have promised in this our Lord we feel sometimes that we've gone beyond time the Lord Elvis to keep believing that we're going beyond the Kurt of time in your eternity hallelujah so lord I pray grace in the name of Jesus Christ for the anointing of the Holy Ghost in our lives the anointing of the Holy Ghost in control of our lives the anointing of the Holy Ghost for this hour the leadership in our lives that we are again as it is written the sons and daughters of God that are led by the Spirit of God amen grace of God that will make our calling and election sure to make sure that we're led by the Spirit amen and led by the Holy Spirit grace to us and we commit ourselves into your care with the going forth of your word through your servant the Prophet amen help us to believe help us a realize Lord that is you speaking to your bride through your servant Amen Lord it's a revelation that we need if there's ever an hour Lord that we need the revelation of leadership it's this hour to make sure that we're under your leadership a man that were not led by the devil we're not led by spirits of unbelief but we're led by the Holy Ghost it is Christ in us Lord grace that we believe Lord that we are here because it's your leadership more than what we have planned it is your leadership we want you to lead us where you want you to guide us with a million Lord grace please Lord that we not lose the revelation of our relationship with you grace in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God a man and a man and a man hallelujah now I really [Music] amen praise the Lord Lord bless your turn with me to Romans chapter 8 I share with you the scripture and then we'll move to the message of the Prophet on leadership amen and to keep our sister Kimberly in prayer and brother Paul and the Saints that are not with us today the grace of God be with them and also I'm asking you to remember our daughter Sharon in prayer understand that she's to have surgery within a few days and prayed the grace of God to be with her during that surgery and it's I think it's a cyst somewhere in her body that the doctors want to remove because it has increased in size so we pray the grace of God be with them and pray on a daily basis yes for Sharon pray on a daily basis for brother Mark's family and your own family that are that are not serving the Lord the grace of God pleading the token life of the blood of Jesus amen against the enemy that's influencing their lives amen so the Holy Ghost takes control amen in Romans chapter 8 and verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen I pray the grace of God that we walk not after our flesh and fleshly leadership but it's a spiritual only Ghost leadership for the law of the spirit of life is pray in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death the enemy can't condemn us no more a man because in Christ he can only see the righteousness of God for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen go with me to verse 14 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen the grace of God be with us that we're led by the Spirit of God the sons and daughters of God crying father father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God amen a trust we have that that witness our trust we have that testimony that we are thus we're not religious or were just not members members of a Bible believers church we are the sons and daughters of God amen too many identify themselves there were just Christians and we go to church and we do this we do that now you've got to have the revelation that you are the sons and daughters of God if you are born again you're born by the Spirit of God amen so what what birth is more important is not your natural one it's your spiritual they may so the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs and heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together a man God best his word amen the Lord bless you you may be seated as we go into the message on leadership preached in Covina California December the 7th 1965 and again to remind you that it is the second last message that the Prophet preached and I believe it was significant and I believe it's important a man he acknowledges he says that it that what he was preaching was hard a man but he said that's the hour we're living he said we got we can't help it we got to do it a man her brother and and I believe message preachers need need to need to have that revelation because they're forever a time brother that we need to get ardor and ardour and ardour as we get closer and closer to the change amen closer and closer to the reality of the resurrection and the rapture oh yeah God through the minister is going to get ardor and put more pressure more pressure on the on the elect more pressure on the bride a man to make your calling and election sure God's grace to us amen Lord bless you I can't help being a more I just got to be what I am and we I don't mean to be different it's just that I I'm living at a changing time we're as long as you're building the wall one straight way it's all fine then the orbicularis keel right down the road but when you have to turn the corner that's where the time and we're not building a wall we're building a house to see so these terms has to come they come in the age of Martin Luther John Wesley in the Pentecostal age it's here again so we it's hard to turn the corners but I'm so thankful for to God even though hard too rough it's been the people has responded 100% so we're very grateful thank each one again and now before we opened the boot let's speak to the author if you will just a moment while we bow our heads dear gone we are grateful to you tonight for the privilege of knowing Jesus Christ our Savior your son in the free pardoning of our sins and to know that his blood is sufficient that's covered all of our sins and our iniquities they're so blotted out and put in the sea of God's forgiveness and his bride will stand at the wedding supper pure unadulterated to marry the son of God how we thank thee for this all sufficiency in the faith to know that we do not trust in our own merits but in his merit alone for what he did for us we're so grateful thank you for the the success that these brethren had overseas in the countries over there where there hungered and thirsting for God I pray Lord that if they go back again at those children that they brought into the kingdom will be great grandmothers and grandfathers of the children at they bring in also granted father bless us together tonight may the Holy Spirit give to us the things that we have need of close our mouths to the things that we should not say and open our hearts to receive what you would tell us granted father in Jesus name we pray amen now let's turn in the Bible to a little text that I would like to speak on for a while tonight and it's found over in st. mark the tenth chapter and I have a few years ago when I would speak I would I wouldn't even have to write a note I could remember it and I didn't have to take a pair of glasses to read down the Bible but since I passed 25 now twice some County a little hard for me to do like it used to do as like a war in our car but I'm still running I want to keep on chugging along till it's I go to scrap heap to be molded over that's the promise st. Luke the tenth chapter and began at the I believe I said the 21st verse if I can find it here some were mistaken his st. mark I'm sorry Saint Mark the tenth chapter and the twenty beginning with the 21st verse I want to read let's get to 17th first rather and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeling down to him and asked him saying good master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto him why call us out me good there's is none good but one that is God I don't know what's the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother and he answered instead of him master all these have I observed from my youth then said then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing that I'll like us gold our way and sell whatsoever thou has and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasures in heaven and come and take up a cross and follow me and he was said at that saying and he when we grieve for he had great possessions may the Lord bless the reading of his word now we're going to speak tonight on a subject I want my text to be follow me and a subject leadership that's a strange but I thought maybe today and praying now been so long and each night right down the line on the message that I have the Lord has given to me to speak on I thought tonight over in this new chapter I would approach it from a different standpoint and many times we've talked on this toilet the rich young ruler and many of the ministers share my brother no doubt if approached it in many different ways and I will try to approach it in a different way tonight and I ever had this of leadership this remember this that each one of us young and old your first step that you ever made in your life someone had to lead you that's right and your last step you ever make someone will be leading you someone has to lead god has likened us unto sheep and if anyone knows about raising sheep and the nature of sheep while you know that a sheep cannot find his way around he has to be led even in the slaughter pens we find that they bring the sheep there and he's led up into the slaughter by a goat a goat leads them up then when he gets up to the other chute he jumps out the sheep goes right on into the slaughter so they we find that a sheep cannot find his way around I remember an experience I had with one one time I was State game warden in Indiana and I've been out in the field and I heard something the most pitiful cry and it was a little lamb that lost his mama and he couldn't find his way to her and the mother couldn't find her way to the to the little lamb now picked the little fella up and how quiet he laid against me and I went along there my hands holding a little fella and crying and as I heard him hide and just snug his little head down against me it seemed like he knew that I was going to help him about all Rock of Ages cleft for me pick me up in the arms of the Lord Jesus just be content as I know I'm I'm going to go home to be with my loved ones now thought at the end of my life's journey just bring me in your arms Lord like that but I know I'll be carried across the river then don't the other side where there'll be no sorrows and sicknesses and things and I'll be with the loved ones that I've loved and if you study nature there's a great thing in nature everything that I that I look at and God has made he's the author of nature nature runs in continuity all nature runs about the same you notice everything as I have said I believe last evening at nature testifies of God if you never had a Bible you can still watch nature and know that this Bible is the truth I had the privilege of being around around the world I've read the different phases and I've seen different religions than Mohammed's and I've read the Koran and seemed to seeks the Jains and Muhammad's and the Buddha's and lot more but yet each one of them they have a philosophy and a book of Creed and a book of laws and so forth but our Bible is the truth and our God is the only one that is right because each one of them has support to aggrieve some where were their founder is still laying but Christianity ports to an open tune and can live in the presence of the one that was put in there he is alive it's not a God that was it's a God that is not a I was or will be but I am and all nature runs in continuity as I've said talking on our church ages which we have the books now it's coming out the water it out about my writing of the church ages and how that we see the church how it's matured come up just exactly like all nature does and we is talking the other day about how the Sun rises in the morning it's a little baby real week not much strength to it at all and as the day goes on it gets stronger stronger about eight o'clock it enters school like a young boy or young girl and then about eleven o'clock it's out of school and it's ready for its it's the service and then a cross till about three o'clock it changes in the middle life into old age and then dies in the afternoon is that the end of the Sun no it comes back the next morning to testify that there is a life a death a barrel a resurrection we watched the trees how they move and what they do I was some time ago down in Kentucky I I like to squirrel hunt huh went out in the fall a year there to squirrel hunt with a friend of mine and it's got very dry anyone ever hunted great squirrel know that how hard it is to slip up on him Windham the leaves just crack one and all Houdini is a amateur escape artist to those fellows how they can get away then trying to shoot eye shots at 50 yards it takes some good hunting to get your limit today so mr. wood a friend of mine a converted Jehovah Witness was with me and we said I know a farm over here where these a man that's got a lot of we call in there hollers how many what a holler is a lot part of Kentucky you from enhancing and that's why I'm from them like you're one of the chapters not long go ahead tell us your brother Williams name brother they said we will now stand and sing the national anthem anthem Nauset bar my old Kentucky home for nobody Jordan with me so that's the only anthem I knew and so on we as a we was all right so please have preferably interpret now is bleeding at the nose let us pray dear God as Lord art is a great healer and I asked that your grace and mercy will touch this dear woman just now and stop that but as a believing people who symbol together the lady has come here to enjoy the word of the Lord and the fellowship of the people and I asked you Lord just now to rebuke the enemy and stop the blood in Jesus Christ's name Amen and we believe it all with the little story just to kind of get a feeling before we get right down in a few notes I've got written here in some scripture now he said well this old man will go over seemed he's got a lot of horrors in his place he said but he's an infidel he said if he just about cursed us out if we went over there I said but we're not getting Oh squirrels here we've been camping two weeks and was dirty and beard all out on her face yeah he said well let's go over so we went a few miles down about 20 miles I've been in the country down there once before for three nights at a Methodist campground or they'd been some great things the Lord had did a great healing service amongst the Methodist people and then we went way back over some hills and hollers and ridges and you just have to know Kentucky to know it what kind of place you had to get into and while we went back there we come to a house and there said an old man - old man sitting out there with the old hats locked down or their face and and he said there he is and said he's a tough one said he hates upward of a preacher he said so I said well I just better set the car we won't get to hunt at all I said you go in and asked him if we can hunt so he got out started walking in he spoke to them and in Kentucky always you know it's coming in so forth and so he wound up there and he said I just wondered if we could hunt awhile on your place the old man sitting there about 75 years old to back over running down his mouth he said spit is it what's your name he said my name is wood he said are you any relation to old man Jim did you sleep he said I'm Jim's boys that I'm banks yeah well they said old man Jim was an honest man said certainly help yourself he said I said are you by yourself he said naw I my pastor is out there he said what is that my pastor is out in a car said he's hunting with me he said would you don't mean you've got the lowdown to you have to told a preacher with you

he said look you see that all chimney stand up there yes I was born up there are 75 years ago instead I've lived right here in these hills all around through all these years and instead I've looked towards the skies above here and there and surely in all these 75 years I would have seen something it looked like God didn't you think so I Stewart depends on what you're looking at here what you're looking for he said well he said I certainly don't believe there is such a creature and I'll be you fellows just simply get out and swindle the people out of their money and everything and that's way it goes I said well you're American citizen you have a right to your own own thinking he said there's one guy one time that I heared of he said and I would sure if he ever get to talk with that person I liked it they asked him a few questions I said yes sir you said it was a preacher you might know it said he had a meeting up here and camels feel not uncle in a church yard a verb a campground and he said I forget his names that used to be Indiana and and I said oh yes sir and brother would say well I don't think and so he said I said what about him he said well he said old lady somebody up on the hill said you know she was dying with cancer and said wife and I would go up there of a morning to change your bed they couldn't even raise her up high enough to put her on the bed and said this had to pull a draw she and said she was dying she'd been to Louisville and said the doctors that give her up and said she was going to die and her sister went up that meeting said that preacher was standing up fell on a platform look back over the audience and call this woman by name and told her when she left she took a handkerchief and punted her her purse and called this woman's name down here 20 miles below here said how she was suffering with cancer water named wasn't all she'd been through said take that handkerchief and go lay it on the woman and said the woman will be healed of her cancer instead they come down here that night said honest I heard all four screaming up there I thought they had the Salvation Army turned loose on top of the hill up there said well I said I guess old sisters dead said well tomorrow we'll go and get the wagon and imma take her out to get to the main road and said so they can take her to the Undertaker and said that we waited no need to go up that time of night said it's about a mile up on the hill here said we went up there the next morning you know what happened that's an ulcer he said she was sitting there eating fried apple pies and drinking coffee with her husband I said you mean that he said yes sir oh I said naw mister you really don't mean that he said what bothers me is what how did that man in ever in this country and knew that and I said oh you don't believe it he said it's the truth I said you believed that these Easter won't go right up the only hill I can prove it to you he's preaching back to me now I picked up a apple and and I said can I have one of these apples I rubbed it on my clothes he said well the yellow Jacksons are eating him up I guess you can ant ones and I said well I bit into it I so that's a nice apple he said oh yes said you know what I planted that tree there or 40 years ago or something like at us or is that right yes sir and I said well uh and every year I said I noticed we haven't had no frost just early August and I said then leaves are far off the trees yes sir that's rice coming all fall be whatever early when this time I said yes sir change of subject and he said I said well you know on strange I said how that SAP goes out of that tree I said Nellie's falls off and yet there's no one there there having had no frogs to kill the leaf and he said well he said what's that got to do with what we're talking about and I said well on I just wonder your mama always said give a count up for open hanging itself you know son just give me plenty of rope so he 109 he said well yes what's that got do is I said you know God brings them apples up you enjoy those apples and le's he said the shades and so forth it goes down to follow the year I said comes back up again with the apples and with the leaves again and he said all that's just nature see that's just nature I said well of course that's nature I said that's nature but somebody has to control nature see he said you tell me now what does that he said well it's just just naturally nature I said who is it it says to that little leaf now and I said now the reason that leaf falls off it's because the SAP goes down into the root and what if that sap stayed up in the tree through the wintertime what would happen said we kill the tree well I said now what intelligence that runs that step down into roots let's get out of your now it's coming fall the year get down in the roots and hide and stay down into the roots like a grave and then next spring comes back up again brings up more apples and brings up more leaves and things he said that's just nature it'll do it said the weather the changing and old coming all fall I said said a book and water on the post out there and just if nature none sit down the vote on the poster brings it back up against it well he said you might have something I said think of it while we go hunting and he said well you said humph where you want to I said I want to come back if you'll tell me what intelligence runs that sap out of that tree down into the roots to stay all winter and come the next winner I'll tell you that's the same intelligence - told me about that woman up there said told Jim I said yes sir you said you're not that preacher I said would you know his name said yes I said Branham he said that's him I said that's right and you know one led the old man to Christ right there on his own testimony and a year later I was down there and pulled a car Indiana license owned in the yard they'd moved away hid died and still want to come back there stood his wife to really break the offer I thought I had permission to huh and she come out there she said can't you read us and she said did you see those signs saying no honey and I said yes ma'am but I said I have permission you do not have permissions he said and said we've got this peut place posted for many years I said well sister I was wrong and I'm sorry he said sorry nothing maybe Indiana license on there set up here you're the bulrush people I said could I just explain it I said she who gave you permission I said I don't know just I said it was an elderly man a setting hot guy on her porch when I was down here last year we was talking about God see and she look she said are you brother Branham I said yes ma'am she said forgive me I didn't know who you were should I want to tell you testimonial is last dying hours you raised up his hands and praise God said he died in Christian faith miss caraway to God if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately crime there's something in nature watch the birds watch the animals watch everything and you watch nature watch the little dove how he flies what a different birdie is see he he doesn't have any gold he can't eat like the crow can see he has no gall in him he doesn't have to take a bath in the water because he's got something on the inside of him it cleans me from the inside out see that's why the Christian is that's why God represent himself and and a dove deeper calls and the Jesus was represented as a lamb always in nature you'll find God and God liken us on to she that has to be led did you ever notice how a priestess terminology sometimes a goal that those dove coming down on the lamb to lead the lamb and it led him to the slaughter that that dove now that that dove could not have descended upon any other type of animal because they both had to be of the same nature see if the dog would have lit up on a wolf and he would have snorted or growl the Dove would have took its flight well that's the same way now and are your ways the Holy Spirit just takes this flight and goes away it's got to have the same nature the bird of the heavens the Dove the meekest animal on earth the land they can agree together and when the Holy Spirit comes upon us and makes us new creatures then he could lead us but we try to live the same alive it won't work it just won't work now the first step you've probably ever taken in your life speaking of leadership it was probably the hands of some kind own mother them hands maybe still tonight out there some cemetery somewhere but that was a hand that helps you to make your first step then at your mother taught you how to walk and you make a few steps then fall down and get up and you thought you were doing great things then she turns you over to the schoolteacher and then she begin to lead you to an education how what you must do and how you must learn and and so forth like that then after the school teacher got through with you then you returned back your father got ahold of you then when your father got older to eat touch you perhaps your business how to be a successful businessman how to do things right your mother taught you how to be a housewife how to cook and so forth like that then after they got through with you then your minister or priest got a hold of you but now who leads you that's the question now now we're all led by something tonight we have to be we relate notice now let's look at this young fellas what had influenced him let's look at the this young businessman we would call him because he was a businessman he was a great successful man let's look at his leaders perhaps first his mother had taught him as a little boy the things that he should do his father had mating such a fine success maybe lefted him and elect him an inheritance because he was a ruler himself perhaps his father was gone so he is a businessman he was uh let's call him today I like a Christian businessman or he was a religious businessman I think would be the best quotation this man was religious he was by no means an infidel and he had been taught by his mother how to do right how to walk how to dress himself he had been taught by his father a great business and how to be a successful man and his business was successful and father and mother had been raised up in the church and have pointed him to the priest and the priest had made him a real religious man therefore he was a fine cultured man he was a fine boy with good character if Jesus Christ looked at him and loved him there was something about the boy it was real right or the Bible said here we find out a mark and jesus beholding him loved him yes jesus beholding him loved him so therefore they must be something real outstanding about this young fellow he was I had a good character good character reading he was a man that was raised right intelligent smart intellectual successful in business and a religious man he had a lot of good characteristics that was outstanding so much that it attracted the attention of Jesus Christ the Savior but when he was confronted being successful in all these other things nothing had went wrong he was perfectly cut out right measured upright intelligent right education his success he's smart a fine businessman probably belong to a business man's group some were there in Palestine he might have belonged to a business man's fellowship like we have your no doubt he did because businessman has always had fellowships with another one with the other calls just like birds of a feather they have things to talk about and if this for the religious man they don't want to talk about the man that runs the barroom and all of that because they have nothing in common we've got to have things in common so Christians has things in common with Christians sinners has things in common with with sinners and societies and whatever they are they have things in common this young boy probably belonged to a business man's fellowship and he was religious as he could be because Jesus in questioning here he said I have kept these Commandments observed them all from my youth that's right see he had been brought up right taught right and everything but when he was confronted with the the thought of eternal life now I want you to notice of all this character that he had he knew he did not possess eternal life now all of our societies our church our membership and the things that we hold so dear are American societies and everything is very fine there's nothing to be said against that and our Christian businessmen society here is a great thing it's been an open door for me too oh my interdenominational thoughts that we are Christians there is no one no one denomination can claim us real Christians because you belong to God denominations are man-made and Christianity is heaven-sent but in all these things that we have as good as they are as fine as we come together and is nice of meetings as we have and social understanding that we have yet we are each one confronted with eternal life no matter how successful we've been in business how successful we've been and what a great church remember we are we work how we try to do things right still if it's not done in the right way it is a worship of God in vain Jesus placed that the same way as I stopped here for a moment he said in vain do you worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of man now thank a sincere honest worship with the sincerity of your heart to God and still be in vain it begin that way with Cain at the Garden of Eden sincere worship but was rejected very religious still rejected it's three-port last week week 4 last of the business man's meeting a breakfast hours several hundreds of people together I took two and a half hours to speak on doing God of service without being God's will no that sounds strange but we've got to channel ourselves into God's provided channel and God's Way of doing it no matter how much we think it's right it's got to be according to the word of the Lord or it's in vain Cain worship but it wasn't cording to the word of the Lord the Pharisees worship but not according to the word of the Lord and in this particular message to the businessman I taught this David he wanted to do the Lord of service and he was right and what he said he said is it right for the Ark of the Lord to be done let's bring it up here in the days of the king the other king and he succeeded he said it's not right they never consulted the Lord by the ark but we must do it now that's correct what they should he said we should go get the ark and we could consult the Lord and that's right he was down in another country so we got to bring it up here get up here and put it on I'll sure and worship the Lord now notice he went in the wrong channel to do it he consulted the captains of 50s and hundreds and thousands they all was consulted everyone see it was the will of the Lord the blacker it was the Lord the word of the Lord sometimes you had to put it in its right place or it's not the will of the Lord I'll let that soak deep and you'll get a general conception of what I'm trying to say I don't want the church to fall into the steps that you found over there in England long hair and painted face man and pervert we don't want that no matter how religious it sounds and how much Elvis Presley can sing religious songs he's still a devil I'm no judge but by their fruits you know them he's a Pentecostal that don't make a bit of difference me your fruits bear record what you are I'm at the screen comes up behind me because speak in tongues he gets out he could heal the stick in Jesus said many of them will come to me in that day Lord have not done this and that not say depart from me you that work iniquity I never even knew you we've got to be real genuine Christians and the only way we can do that is confronted with this question here of eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that comes from God and he foreordained every creature that would ever have it just as you were the chain and your father he was a chain in God one of his attributes to begin with or you'll never be there you come forth in the bedding ground of your mother your father didn't know you you were in his lines and when you come forth in the bedding ground of the mother then you become a human being in the made in the image of your father now you can fellowship with him in the same thing by God if you've got eternal life the life that you come in the natural life physical life that was by your father and the only way you can come born-again is the only way is that has to be from your heavenly father is attributes all the father has given me will come to me you're here because your name were placed on the Lamb's Book of Life before there was even a foundation of the world exactly right you're a gene a spiritual gene out of your heavenly Father a part of God's Word that beast toys I've said then you must with Jesus when we share because he was the word you suffer with him died with him buried with him and rose with him and I was sitting in heavenly places in him notice David thought everything was fine and he consulted all these people and they everyone began to dance and shout and scream they had all the religious motions that there was but still it wasn't God's will to go down and bring the Word of God back to the house of God but you see God always in all ages worse through one wait his first decision is his only decision because he's perfect in his decisions he never does nothing except he first reveals it to his servants the prophets exactly that's why this the church age that we live in there's no church no Methodist Baptist Pentecostals or anything else can ever put this church into the bride it'll have to be the answering of Malachi 4 for God to send a prophet to be revealed to calls that's the only way our church is denominated throw the thing into a mess and huddle it's like they've always been and God always sends the prophets and there was Nathan standing in the land of vindicated prophet before god and he wasn't even consulted and they went down there and calls a life of an honest man and so forth and took the ark instead of putting on a shoulders of a Levi stew packet they put it on a cart to pack it all together messed up see if you don't go according to the the will of God and the way that God has give us to go they always get it messed up and take it off in some organization denomination some message and there you go I think it's always been done that way that's the same thing that this boy was confronted with he come in in a member of maybe the Pharisees are Sadducees are some great order of that day he was religious as he could be he said I've observed these Commandments have been taught since there was a youth see and she's just love depart but he refused to be God he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him each our life Norris he bleed there was something different than what he had or he remember said good master what must I do now see you want to do something self that's what we do we want to do something herself the gift of God is a free gift God give it to you don't do one thing for he ordained it to you and you're going to have it Hey notice he knew it was her he believes in it and wanted it but when he was confronted with how he had to do it he was different from his ritual he was different he could hold his money and blong onto the church that he belong to and so forth but jesus knew that annuity hoarded this money and he said go sell all you've got he'd give it to the poor and come take up your cross and follow me you'll have treasures in heaven but he couldn't do it there are other leaders and he had had in his youthful days had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided wave which was Jesus Christ the only one who holds eternal life the only one that can give you not the church can't give you eternal life not your neighbor not your pastor not your priest not your Creed only Jesus Christ Himself can give you eternal life come on I good you are what you could do it once you start doing you've got to accept the person of the Lord Jesus Christ then when you do that he is the word and then your life fits right in the word and it manifests itself to this age that you're living in no one had to do that for the word to be manifested in his age now what if Moses come along said we know what Noah done we're taking no-one's word we'll do it this way Noah did it we'll build a Ark and float down the Nile River and go out of Egypt what wouldn't work see that was another age Jesus couldn't come with Moses message Luther couldn't come with the Catholic message the Wesley couldn't come with the loser's message the Pentecost couldn't come with the Wesley a message and a bride can't be farmed in the Pentecostal denomination it just can't do it that's exactly right she's done organize and went out here and there she sets just like the rest of it's a shuck just like the live comes up through the sea that rider is I spoke the other night that writer that wrote this book and not cause he criticized me so that said I was a devil if there was such a thing so he said he didn't believe in God he said that God could fold his arms and set up and watch them martyrs through the early ages and claimed I have power to open the Red Sea and let them women and children be tore to pieces by lines and so forth and then said he was a loving God so there's no such a creature see the fellow without inspiration of the word fails to see it the first part of wheat the bridegroom had to fall into the earth and order to rise again so did the first bride that was born at Pentecost had to go through that dark ages like any other seed be buried in they had to die they must do it but it started sprouting again and Luther in the first revelation it did look back to see that whenever was the light of that day the lost dog then went on into the tassel Wesley and from the tallest land of Pentecost the show when you see into the wheat when he comes forth the corner wheat a man that's raise wheat you go out and see that wheat farm in there it looks just exactly like the green but if you'll take a tweezer and sit down and take that wheat and open up there's no grain there at all it's just a choke and then what is its farm there to hold a green sea and then the first thing you know the life left thee there's the stock to go into the tow so let the Stossel go into the shop it leaves the ship and goes into the wheat three stages see of it and then forearms the wheat outside of the three stages Luther Wesley Pentecost exactly see no doubt you can't interrupt nature now look every three years add your message as went for sent from God they organized this has been 20 years there's no organization it won't see now the shuck has to pull away give the weed a chance to lay before the Sun to ripen um the message coming right back into the church again farming the body of Jesus Christ just like the first rich one that went into the ground now to see the eternal life the life sure that the stop back here carried the life certainly it did but to see when it become the stalk and it was finished the organization the life I got on it - Wesley come on out and once each one I've won a big blade don't look like the grain but when the little pollen comes like there on the shutter on this dog the pollen of the tassel it looks a whole lot like the green but when he comes down to that shook it's almost there did Jesus say in the last days Mathew 24:24 the two would be so close to it would to see they're very genes predestinated the elected ones if it was possible almost like the real thing so in the last days now you see it sweet time now it's getting harvest time this is not Luther's age this is not Pentecost age this is a bride and as Moses called a nation out of a nation Christ today is calling a church out of a jury you see the same thing a type take them to the glorious eternal promised land now to refuse that person that's doing the calling Christ no matter if you're a pic also Methodist loser whatever you are you've got to this age nothing against them not at all but in this age now you've got to accept like they did in that age the person of Christ which is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us the same yesterday today and forever in Hebrews 13:8 believe you must accept that person of eternal life and what life Luther had was justification Wesley had sanctification added to it the Pentecost had the restoration of the gifts coming back in an attitude but now it's completing in the body you see the three phases of it and out of that then when the resurrection comes to life that will leave to them Lutheran's this one out the life that lived in the Methodist and went up the life of one of the Pentecostals will all be raptured out of the ground in the body of the bride to be taken in before Jesus Christ glory to God oh it's exciting it's the truth we've turned a corner we're looking towards heaven watching farther come as a cap on the pyramid as we would say this coming back the church must be resurrected soon and we must get ready and the only way you can is not say well I belong to the same ways I belong to the women's Tunis or whatever it is all in there I belong to church you got that don't mean a thing our fathers shouted in dance that's perfectly all right that Missouri but today you're confronted not with the organization they made but with the life it's going on with you Jesus Christ this young fellow had done the same thing Moses wrote those Commandments but you see the same God that wrote the commandments by His Prophet was the same thing he prophesied the day would come I'll raise up a prophet like a nun to me it'll come to pass that all they don't hear him will be cut off back in the denominational shuts into All Souls they must go on July and today don't say I'm Pentecost I belong to this I belong to that that don't mean nothing you've got to accept the person right eternal life confronts every one of us don't forget that no other leaders you see it adds such a hold on their people says talk well we belong to this and we belong to that it had such a whole line but what a fatal thing to reject the leadership of eternal life now that life is present tonight that's right the Holy Spirit is here which is Christ in spirit born his spirit the anointing is sure a little while the world sees me no more yet ye will see me for I'll be with you even in you to the consummation to the in the world Jesus alone can lead you to that eternal life there's no church no denomination no preacher no priest no nothing else can lead you to it you must be led by him the only one that can lead you could you imagine lead you out of his word which that's him and if he is the and you're a part of him won't you be a part of the work the word that God wants to pour the waters of salvation upon today to identify him today like the apostle's identified like Luther like Wesley like the people in their days identified and this is another age it's the word the word said these things that we're seeing taking place now is predicted to take place in this hour so accept Jesus Christ and let him lead you through the eternal life though he to achieve this young fellow he had achieved all good things you school been fine as a good boy no doubt it been good as a real father and listening to his daddy in business he'd been a good a good boy good to his parents he'd been loyal to his priest he'd been loyal to his church he'd been loyal to the commandments of God but he lost the greatest thing and the rest of them that mean very much to him when he turned down the leadership of eternal life Jesus Christ notice this leadership confronts every one of us today the same thing as it did that young man we no matter how religious we are you may be Catholic you may be Baptist Methodist or you may be Pentecostals or whatever you are this same thing confronts you tonight eternal life that's acceptance of Jesus Christ we're given this opportunity some time in life we have to confront the thing just like this young man did because you are a mortal being and you're giving that you're giving the opportunity of choice you have a choice God made it so you can choose if he put Adam and Eve on free moral agency so they could choose and then they made the wrong choice and si can do two more to you than he did to them he's got to put you the same thing so you can choose our reject you have a choice let's look at some of them you have a choice as a young man whether year ago to have an education around you have that choice you can walk to abuse not have it you just reduce it you have a choice of your condom I'm going to hurt just a little bit here you can go out let your hair grow down and be a beetle or some of these ignoramuses or you women you can look like a decent human being or you could be one of these weird creatures that if you have out there that brood eyes and water head haircuts and things are completely against the Word of God which is absolutely contrary not even offer it could offer a prayer to be accepted that's true exactly right so what the Bible said but what's happened to your church you've seen so much television so much things the world is so easy for your ol atom nature to drift into that to act like the rest of them may I repeat this again in the kosha in the offering of the Tollman in the days of Moses when Moses brought the children out there was to be seven days that there was to be no eleven among the people anyone knows that in Exodus no eleven should be found in your tap at all seven days that seven days represent a full seven Church ages no eleven now what is that no Creed no world jesus said if you love the world are the things of the world the love of God is not even in you and we're trying to mix that you can't do it you've got to come to one thing to believe you're either gonna breathe God you're gonna believe your church you're gonna be the world or you cannot mix it together and you can't hold them all things that the other church before you did you've got to take the message of the hour he said what was left over don't let his state till morning to come into this other age burn it with father be destroyed that the age that you're living in the message of this age it's got to be brought out of the scriptures and vindicated and proved by God that is God doing so then you either he see that are rejected that's eternal life leadership of the Holy Spirit leading his church we can still know long time let's move just keep moving along the choice of your conduct you could you can't mix it now you're in a far god against God and that outward expressions shows exactly what's on the inside the cocklebur many of you think I got two badges only goes I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to hit don't sir you have the baptism the Holy goes to every hour in your life is still be lost and go to hell the Bible system it's exactly right look here you are a outside person you have five senses it contacts that outside body God gave you five states is not to contact him your earthly home see taste feel smelling here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets conscience love so forth five outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts are physical your spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul that soul is that gene they come from God and like a baby farmed in his mother's womb when the baby comes into the to the mother's womb but the little germ he crawls into the egg it doesn't form one cell a human the next the dog the next to cap the next to horse it's all human self because it's building off of an original human self and when a man has been born again by the Word of God predestinated an eternal life called the elected it'll be worth a god Oh topper word word on words not a denomination creed and then a word to create what you can't have that lemon in it only one eternal life Jesus Christ the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among Brennan you feed my children you're saying the across the mission fields to the world to bring the message I got to be sincere with you what I'm looking at maybe you don't see that's what I'm here to try to tell you it's not because I don't love people it's because I do love people corrective when I see the slipping of the church going on say well we did this we and look around with the church to see them it just worked then look here the Bible it's got to be that with the Inza lukewarm lady of san church age putting Jesus out the word you never call you a goat culture she said as many as I love I rebuke a chest him taking the word and pound it on and telling you're wrong and that's reason I love you if you open the door let me in I'll come in and sup with you no church she don't put out of that she's headed for that kaminnikov council that's where she's gone right back into room where she come from Anna it's exactly I've got that ruled all paper from 25 years ago for 33 years ago and there it is not only that's ruled in the Bible from vision she's gone back he's no we're saving it's gone it's gonna be that way God's calling individuals I stand at the door and knock any person what individual out of a thousand it might be one out of a million as I said a few nights ago when Israel come up out of Egypt there were just two million people come and just to me I just want to people went in one out of a million do you know that Caleb in Joshua and Jesus when he was on that they said our fathers eat matter learners we're keeping the traditions and we're doing this we don't worry then he said I know your father's deep man on the winners and there everyone eternally separated they're dead when the spring comes from the male or female is the million aches comes his immediate germs come and out of all them little germs of the kind if it's a if it's from the male cow or the man or whatever it is there's just millions of germs a million germs working in there there's only one of those germs it's our danger life for these one egg or their fertile to meet it that's dry only one egg it'll be just like this body here sitting here and the germ comes from God what's that little germ come up among all these other germs and wiggle around and run all past them go over here and find that fertile egg and crawl right into it the rest of them dies what if it was that way with the church today one out of a million see where it would be straight is a gate areas away and few there will be that I'll find it most broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there will be it going there right is that Tris program I don't know but I miss quoting scripture now your are deign to live you see it if your our dynasty if you're not our daddy to sit you wants it except they have eyes but they can't see ears and can't hear how thankful you should be Church how you just straight your step up from these things I should be on fire for God that's your eyes the hosts what you see your ears here's the things you see the leadership why did you come here tonight hear a message like this branded across the world by the churches as a fanatic why did you come the Holy Spirit led you yeah listen circumcised cut away the things of the world except the leadership of Jesus Christ or your parish assures the world you have a choice of conduct how you conduct yourself that's up to you you have a choice of life you go out and take your wife you want to take a wife you want to take what is complimentary to your to watch you or you plan your future home to be could you imagine a man a Christian man going out and taking one these modern Rick at us for a wife could you imagine what's the man thinking about what type of homes to go to head he takes a striptease a bonus all for the street out here a Street prostitute or say no wait a minute how does she dress yourself wear a short Sanitation Street prostitute oh you say no brother no tight skirts look like you're poured into Street prostitute Jesus then whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her in his heart then he's got to answer for that and what'd she do she presented herself who's guilty think of it you say they don't make any other goals they got Goods and sewing machines so excuse Ritchie and this is not a joke this is thus saith the Lord from the scripture it's exactly true friend I'm an old man I have got much longer to stay but I've got to tell you the truth if this is my last message it's the truth see don't sister don't brother and you fellows it's hanging on to a Creed and knowing the Word of God being vindicated right before you the baptism of the Holy Ghost in these realities that we have today and then because of your Creed turn away from it how can you be a son of God in there now the Word of God that's predicted for this last days that we're having here how can you do it how can the Bible call this as I said last night about a king one time down in the South when they had the colored I never sold for slaves well there's no more in just a used car market you get a bill of sales on alarmed in a little place I read when they were a broker come along goodbye Simon he said well now they're sad you'd have to whip them make them work because its way from home they're sold slaves and they in a foreign country they know nothing about and never be back home again and they were said you had to whip a make a board but this broker come by a certain plantation one young follower his chest out his chin up he didn't have to whip him he was right up he kept the morals the rest of the broker said I'll buy him he said he's not for sale don't go buy him because he's not for sale he said well what makes him so much difference then is he the boss arrest em said no so do you feed him different no he's a slave eats out there the galley with the rest of them so what makes me so much difference he said I wondered myself to have found out over in Africa or they come one where the Boers bottom and bottom over here sold for slaves over there his father is a king of the tribe and yet an alien away from home he knows he's the son of a king so he conducts himself that way what a rebuke of the Christianity we're supposed to represent God in eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God he alone has eternal life and we are products of his because we're jeans of his spirit then we should conduct ourselves women in man like the Bible said for us to do not Jezebel's of the street and Ricki's of the organization but Christian gentleman sons and daughters of God born to the Spirit of God manifesting the light in our days is scattering it right how far we've drifted from watch the same thing this boy did here he rejected it refused eternal life because it would cost him his social standing it cost india slitters his luxury of money it cost him his fellowship in the church it costs a lot of things he no no I was go to cost him he was a sensible boy and he felt that he couldn't pay the price yeah he thought I used to trust my religion and go on but down in his heart he know there was something about Jesus Christ was different from their priest of that day coming a genuine born message of God is different from the old trend when I divine Healy went forth not long ago you notice how the impersonators followed it I never won everybody in them organizations stay in there did anyone know that there had to be a message follow that while God don't entertain us here trust our attention with something and when he attracts our attention then he's got his message look when he first first come on the earth and start his ministry Oh young rabbi we want your ear in our church we bring come on down here the young prophet oh he wants you over here come here but one day he stood up said I and my father are one Oh mix yourself card except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you he's a vampire we have nothing to do with that them apostles set right there thousands lefty but those apostles were ordained to life he said so they couldn't explain it they believed it they stayed right with you because said no man could do these works even the priest note that Nicodemus said we know Sanhedrin Council that no man could do these works except it be from God the Peter on the day of Pentecost of Jesus of Nazareth I mean approved of God among God was with him look at the Scriptures what the scriptures say but do Jesus let's search the Scriptures in them you think you have eternal life they are what testifies of me if you were to know Moses you know me from Moses wrote that I would come in the form that I would come in he come as the son of man he comes in three names it's God three like Father Son and Holy Ghost same God his three attributes now the whole sold justification and sanctification Luther Martin in the Pentecostal same thing three attributes three station Street Church ages same thing water blood and spirit August is you go along the three elements it takes you back into the body like it brings you from your national birth pipes your spiritual birth the babies born the first things water X blood and life that's where you come into the kingdom about the same way that's where the church comes in the same way same thing now notice on these three things God as formed is forming his body now we find that in here that you have a right in your choice you choose the girl you want a marriage extension all right then another thing you have a choice of whether you want to live or whether you don't want to live you choose now between life and death you can live that boy had that choice he's success and everything else a religious man but he's known that when he's fogarty himself I've observed all these Commandments since I was a youth but he note he didn't have eternal life see and he had a choice to accept it or to refuse it and he turned it down that was the most fatal mistake he could ever made the rest of it what the mountain doesn't mount unless you take that choice now let us follow him history and see warrior daddy to see where he's short on I look he was a his rich man he's a businessman he was a ruler and he was a religion man all that today we'd say boy he's a genuine Methodist Baptist or Pentecostal he's he's a real fella real nice boy fun nothing to say about it friendly nice sociable and everything Noah morals about him you didn't probably smoke drinker run around of shows and dances and whatever we call today is when classic Christian but that he's eternal idea daddy what we're talking about he might have been loyal to his church of what you probably was but you see and what did it lead him to great popularity let's say if he was a preacher he could have been got a better Church he could be in a state transmitter a vision it leads you to popularity and it ready to riches and to fame it might do the same thing today you have a great talent to sing I thought of that young man and while we're sing that song here I give that to the devil now I get that how differ between him and apples Presley and some of these Pat Boone in a group like that Ernie for God's grace singers and take their talents that god-given talents and use it to inspire them the works of the devil that's right some great singers selling their god-given talents for fame in this world to become somebody how could you become any more of a body and you could have been somebody than to be a son of God Oh kept you on the whole city the whole world and you haven't except the leadership of eternal life for the Holy Spirit Christ how you go to who are you anyhow you're a dead mortal dead estate of trespass religious as you want to be his faithless you want to be to the church preacher if you want to be in a pulpit but to turn down you die he was a great success he was a great success here in his life certainly we find him or we knows then we find this fella that he went we fall him a little bit we see he were gone a great successful and we were falling through the Bible we noticed that he he we find him a rich man he's got such great big places he is entertaining the judge did the mayor city er what board is up on top of his roof and he has great banquets and plenty of waitresses and women girls and everything else around and it's a beggarly at the gate named Lazarus he sweeps the crumbs off train we know the story the next thing it goes on successful just like the churches - they're getting a businessman sitting here telling me right here in California that the church has to tell the labor union what to do this time in church and state again it's right you seek your rowdy in there you take the mark of the beast not knowing it if you ever bought one of my tapes get this one I get when I get home the trail of a serpent and you see where it's that see where this ends up at going home now to speak at the Lord building it's about four hours so I couldn't keep it above the meeting like this I have to go up everywhere the church suffers with me Stallone patiently notice but now even listed to teach sometime in your home notice this now we find out that he was a great success then we find him later till he was a greater success until he said I have got so much boy year to made a real genuine God this day with me even my barns to swell down they're bursting I've got so much die said oh so take the rest but what he done at the beginning he rejected the leadership of Jesus Christ his church his intelligence his education and all relative to a success all the Jews loved him he give to them he helped them he might have done this sound the other but you see he rejected the through the leadership of Jesus Christ to eternal life and that the Bible said he said thou fool tonight your soul is required now we find the next place inhale lifting up his eyes and seeing that better that he turned out the street in the bosoms of Abraham what a fatal mistake how that the churches had had I've been alright in the way that they went but they still hadn't had eternal life it reminds me of a sermon I preached you're not long ago of thinking man's filter you've not a head it I was going walking through the woods a squirrel hunting this fall and look down and of course I can't call the cigarette company you dort and there later a cigarette pack laying there and I just passed by looking first in the woods I seen that package laying there look back again it said a thinking man's filter a smoking meds taste start walking through its and Holy Spirit said turn it pick that up now reach down it picked it up a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste I thought American firm here selling this under disguise but to their own American citizens a faking man's filter you and a smoking man's taste I was at the World Fair with you Brian Hernan bring her name up there when he giving all that test now he put one secret draw the across the marble and took the rim wiped up the nicotine and put it on a rat's back a white red in his seven days just the four cancer he couldn't walk and they said you know we say a filter said it's a gimmick sells more cigarettes it takes so much nicotine to satisfy that devil it's right and when you take a filter cigarette it takes four cigarettes to take the place to one it's a gimmick to sell you more cigarettes you cannot have smoke unless you got tolerant are you got cancer sea otters and the blind Americans looking for a rabbit to come out of a hat somewhere they fall apart you can't have it it's death I don't care what you wear you go it's death anyway you go a thinking man's filter a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all he's got any thoughts at all well I thought that's just gonna comply to the churches I think as God got a filter yes in every church has got a filter it's right they built the ones that comes in and they let a lot of death into how could you ever draw a denomination through God's filter how could you do it how could you draw a bob haired woman through that filter tell me how could you ever draw a woman that wears slacks through there was the denomination for the put on a garment pertains to amazing see God's tiller would catch her out there it wouldn't let her come in but the church has got their own filters so I say that there is a thinking man's filter that's God's Word and suits a holy man's taste let's try to hold him in not a church man but a holy man's face the cause is pure holiness unadulterated Word of God there is a thinking man's filter and church member advise you to use that one cause it brings in the world and one lump of it is death one lump Levens or one little leaven leavens the whole lump whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it his part will be taken from the book of life at the Garden of Eden what calls death and all this sorrow ever heartache every little dying baby ever rattling the throat ever amber screaming every hospital every graveyard was because Eve doubted one word not all of it it's just perverted now God said man there he was to keep every word of God now that's the first to the Bible in the middle of Bible Jesus come and he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Ellen not as part of him everyone in the last the Bible revelations 22 Jesus give the testimony of himself the revelation of these other Bible is Jesus Christ and he said whosoever shall take one word out of here or add one word to it his part will be taken to the book of life now you go through that thinking man's filter you'll have a holy man's taste when you come out of there you'll have a saintly taste sister you that where are those clothes think of it you're going to you Stanford used to my husband I'm first used to my boyfriend I'm a virtuous girl but what about that sinner looked at you when he answers for adultery who did it guilty see written in the word so it's see all via peeking woman via Thank You mr. David my but what if it does happen to be that way he said so in one word Kate fail the great man told me not long ago call me into the truth so I'm go away hands on you brother brandy ruining her ministry preach the stuff safe I said Indian ministry that the Word of God will ruin all to be rude see he said I'll lay hands on he said you said to pray for this thing I said to you be those things brother he said no but it's not our business I said whose business is to then well he said that's a pastor's business I look at the congregation see every year I pass through preaching these things nothing sure they get it next year come back more than ever it goes to show that many are called but the leadership is the Holy Spirit frame it leads you and guide you into all truth when he the Holy Ghost has come now think of that take the thinking man's filter that's the Bible not your Creed not your church you'll be lost take the thinking mids filter that's where that boy didn't think he took the church filter he become popper great man but in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torment now you take the thinking man's filter Jesus Christ the word and you'll desire a holy person's taste because it'll satisfy that if you've got the Holy Spirit in you this satisfies it if the Holy Spirit is there you sell well I don't think that means any difference look what you've done right there same thing Eve done right back in the same place now let's go a little farther now let's take leave that man in there that didn't use the thinking man's filter he refused to accept the leadership of Jesus Christ to eternal life now let us take another rich young businessman ruler with the same opportunity this man had and except he accepted the leadership of Christ now there's two of them in the Bible that we're going to talk about that when we see that refused it now let's take this man another rich young businessman and a ruler and he accepted the leadership the Scriptures tell us about this fellow if you want to mark it down in Hebrews 11 23 to 29 Moses by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the afflictions of God esteeming the reproach of Christ greater treasures and all the treasures of Egypt he accepted eternal life Moses the Steve the the the reports of Christ greater treasures than all the treasures the world had Moses esteem that the greatest now this rich man didn't and Moses was a rich young ruler to become a pharaoh he was Pharaoh son it was heir to the throne he looked out to the impossible a bunch of mud dobbers a bunch of slaves but by faith he saw the promise of God through the word his people would sojourn in a strange land for 400 years but would be brought out by a mighty hand and he has seen that all the treasures of the Egypt for he forsook Egypt not knowing where he was going he was led by Christ he forsook and he had his foot on the throne and had been been the next Pharaoh in Egypt but he has seen the reproach of Christ the reproach to be called that odd one we call that phonetic that take his place with the mud dobbers and the fanatics because he's seen that the hour at the scripture was promised to be fulfilled was Darren Oh charts wakeup case you see the same thing tonight the hour has been promised is honest a steam the approach of Jesus Christ greater riches and all the fellowship of any buttocks father and mother Church anything else follow the leadership of the spirit let us follow this Christ for him if you have this the Moses for a little while that I did that let's watch his life the first thing what he accepted to take the reproach of Christ and forsake his education forsake all his wisdom he was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and all of his popularity his throne his Sepulchre his kingship his crown everything he had he rejected and this other fella wanted it and refused Christ in this man refused that and accepted Christ and quickly what happened he had to separate himself hallelujah the word means praise our God it's too bad it we're forgetting it he rejected the Thrones and the popularity he could have had young girls for the wives by the hundreds and he could had separate curse under each it through the world the world laid right at his feet and he was aired every bit of it but looking in the scripture seeing the day he was living in and note that's something any the predestinated seat of God went to where I don't care how popper you could be or how this you could be you're gonna be a press were you could be a pastor you could be a dis than the other but at that word of eternal life but God's Word has been for our deigned into you and you see the thing at hand it goes to her movie huh start coming out then together and he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter because he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater treasures and all the riches of Egypt or the world steena watch what he done he father quickly he was ousted from his people the people that once loved him if I cost you everything you got he might cost you your home if I cost you your friendship it might cost you your sticks and so party it might cost you your place at the Kiwanis it might I don't know what it'll cost you but it'll cost everything that's where you're pertains to the oil you'll have to separate yourself you'll have to do it Moses laid everything aside and went into the desert with a stick in his he came days after days passed and what if he thought he made a mistake No many times people start out to say oh I'll do it door to god I said let somebody laugh at you make fun of me probably I was wrong he said they they cannot stand chaste Talmud or bastard children and not the children of God see there worked up any emotion see these seed that I've talked about a while ago that's so let us start with it was an owner with the spirit and he done all kinds of all you they and when your spirits anointed you can it's a real genuine Holy Ghost and you can still be a devil or you say brother been false prophets the Bible said the last days to be false prophets jesus said there shall arise false Christ's now Fox Jesus is now nobody stands still for that but false Christ Christ means The Anointed One Vamsi ignored they are anointed but they are false at the bottom of it do great signs and wonders speak in tongues thanks to the spirit preach the gospel judas iscariot simeon her no our bigger campuses prophesied Balaam the hypocrite sure done all the signs everything all the religious moves but you see you put a cover seat and a weak seat in the same bed and pour the water down upon them and honor them they are both rejoice they'll both grow by the same water there's sunshine so they're just they are just the rain falls on the Justin yawns oh but father fruits you shall know them how can you keep from lining up with the word you wanna meet the water falls under Justin young listen our jesus said they will come to me in that day said Lord Lord and not I cast out Devils have not done prophesied have not I've done great things in your name you stay you workers of iniquity depart from me I don't even know you go into eternal hell it's been prepared for the devil his angels see what a word falsely worship in vain striving envy what do you do that when you don't have to do it while take a substitute when the heavens is full of genuine you don't have to do that now we find Moses anointed nothing could turn you back his own brothers turning down that doesn't stop him one day out there he met God face to face with a pillar of fire hanging in a bush let Moses take off your shoes your ground you're standing on his holy for across my people and I've heard of their groins and I remember my promise of a word I'm coming down and would have sent you down there to take a mental certainly he met God face to face he talked with him he's commissioned by God God come right back that same pillar far and vindicated that prophet standing right there on the mountain proved that it was when he took his hands and performed all kinds of miracles and things oh they had the impersonators well sure there were chambers to chamber stood I've done the same thing they did but who was the original 40 to start from it had come from the ward was of the hour and you know that stained things promised to get in the last days as jammers and Janis wish to Moses solo these men of reprobate mind concerning the truth and the rice days to do the same thing had person ate everything right on in the same going home going to its watering a dog to its vomit you Pentecostals they come out of them organizations years ago and cursed them your fathers and mothers and you turned right back around it done same thing that they did and now just the same water in vomit if it made the church vomited out in the early Pentecostal a you to make it vomit out again today it has to be always the shuk has to come the tall soul can't be the only one the shuk has to come see the carrier now we're living in the last days watch the things it's promised for the hour what's this moses confirmed no when he got out there some of these old brother turn up get steamed or to make an organization they said you act like you're the only Holy Mother Munoz the whole congregations holy said Korah Dathan let's choose out minute there's something Moses he felt sorry for him he went out and Lord fell down fully or said God said separate yourself from them I had enough of it just opened up the earth and swallowed him up he noticed Commission God don't deal with organizations he don't deal with groups he deals with individuals right always not in groups individuals one person in the main station said I said at the door and knock and if any man not any group any man will hear my voice hi Jeremy I'll come in to him and stuff see if a Dominican year how can how could this microphone now produce my voice other unless it was made us I could scream against that board all my might did one do nothing because sisters are Dean a maid created a microphone and if the word of God is in you from for ordination of God in you my sheep hear my voice they know my our stranger they won't follow it's got to be that first all that the father has given me they will come every one of them see now he goes on at the lives in here the only past noticed when he come to the end of the road we're closing now because it's getting late 25 minutes 13 notice not home that's early about two or three o'clock we guess they say it's get a little bit late but now I preach to many not all that long preached the same gospel in his day wall he killed himself and Paul with that same anointing with that same gospel ladies body upon you come to life they were interested the church is being farmed something was taking place notice what taken place here Moses when he come down this rich man when he come down there young ruler we talked about all religious and long to church and everything behind educated to find business manually when he come to the end of the road he began to scream there's no word step where is his leadership if been led by his church which is dead he'd been led by the dead world it wasn't nothing for him to step into but what the world had prepared for it hell but here comes Moses a faithful servant to esteem the reproach of Christ greater treasures and all the riches of Egypt he come to the end the road an old man 120 years old walk up on the mountain and you know what a deathbed before he looked over into the promised land he look like everybody side that was his leader the rock he stepped up on the rock in the angels of God packed him away into the glory of the glory of God into the bosoms of God why eight hundred years later he was still being led by his leader we find him over a man Transfiguration stand her with Elijah talking to Jesus before he went to the cross 800 years after death the the one that he esteemed the reproach of his ministry greater treasures and all the popularity of the world and all the money of the world his leader was still leading he was led his leader he led through the death the shadows of death he was read to the grave hundreds of years later there he stood again because as his youth he had chosen the leadership of the Holy Spirit his name will be great when there is no more Egypt for treasures when the pyramids are dust is no more Egypt Moses will be a model among man because he accepted the leadership of Christ instead of going the way his church went there's others that did the same thing look at yo he walked with God for 500 years and then he had a testimony that he pleased God God had verified it and said there's no need of you dying just come on up on this afternoon anyone up boiling out Bob head women and everything as he did in his day jesse bells are the paint on actually got so full of it and don't already cut it on that priest making fun of him and everything else he walked down at the river one day and just across the river wasn't horses hitched to a bush over there a chariot of fire and horses a bar he stepped right on through his robe off to the next prophet Diwali and went up into heaven he accepted the leadership of eternal life because it was Christ that was in Elisha oh yes sir what was it follow me now you must choose your leader you've got to choose it friends look at God's looking-glass survival and see where you're at tonight a little story a little kid one time lived out the country never seen a Mara they came into the city to see his mother sister and she had a home in the old fashion homes used to have a mirror on the door I don't know where you remember that or not but this little boy had never seen him mara so he's playing around the house he looked in it he looked out little boy he awaiting a little boy waited he pulled his ear a little boy pulled his ear and some long ikat he kept walking up close they turn on said mama that's me that's me what do you look like what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader choose the day you choose life or death your choice will determine your eternal destination what you choose remember Jesus said follow me and you're invited tonight to do so and to follow him to eternal life you must come on his terms that's right the word not upon the creed not upon the public opinion not upon what anybody else thinks about it but Oh what God said about it you say well brother brahmanna woman's as good as she can be she does this not old man it went through this I can't help what they done God's word he said let every man's word be aligned mind be the truth you've got to come on his terms come on his conditions the word you cannot come to your creed you cannot come through the nomination you cannot mix it like that there's only one thing you can do accept it on his terms that you're willing to die to yourself and all your thoughts and follow him get rid of all the things in the world and follow me I know that's a stern message brother but I didn't come here and choose a message to the people just trying to make them sing shout holler I've been in heathen meetings where they done the same thing I'm interested in your life I'm a servant of God that's got to answer to God someday in the ministry that the Lord has given me has vindicated itself thousands of times before yet remember jesus said follow me follow me get rid of what you've got and follow me that's the only way to have eternal life that's the only remedy he give this man is the only remedy he give this businessman it's the only remedy he gives anybody his choice he makes this decision it's perfect every time and we must follow him it is the only way to have eternal life so the leadership of God is follow the thin cated word of the hour by the holy ghost that'ss powerheads I'm gonna ask you a question I want you'd be real sincere I want your sister to play this for me I can hear my sustainer calling old altar call and then other sister as we see just with what's going on today now with your hands down just stay for a minute look let's take a place did you read the newspaper last week what that man in England said that crucifixion of Jesus Christ was only a fake it was only fixed up between pilots and him did you see what this American see Logan said he said that Jesus well just cut to sleep or Mandrake we do many of the lodges vote back here in Genesis were talked to the Mandrake we it'll put you to sleep like you're dead your heart hardly beats for two three days at a time and when they give him the dinner to regard they said that was Mandrake weed and they put him up there in a tomb any slip up there for three days of course 21 that does he found him walking right now could you imagine that theologians seminary make believe then how in the world first place the Bible said he refused it when they put the vinegar and gall in his mouth and another thing if that be so then why did those disciples who come and stole him wait why did they give their life and more than employee and falcão their stuff not even worthy to die like he died turn him upside down and sideways on the crosses and think and if they were no but he was a hypocrite and then one cells being hypocrites how would they give their life for him like that oh it's this intellectual day that we're living in education civilization and the modern trend of the day is all of the devil civilization of the devil yes sir the Bible said it is this civilization has dead when we have a civilization like this the other world no sir would have a different kind of civilization education all these things there are the devil science perverting the natural things making something else look what they've done to you now when young ladies and the Reader's Digest said week after month before last I believe us The

only be about 500 people in the rapture that's living you'll be changed or taking all Christendom together Catholic and all he's over 580 people see it claims Christianity and one out of a million be 500 people there's that many people missing every day across the world that we can't even count for him see it'll come and you won't even know what people go on preaching and saying see and it'll all be passed like Jesus if they said to disciple said why don't say the scribes say at last must first come he said he's already coming you didn't know him but they did to him what they said they would do you know that you're not right with God and you'd like to be remembered to God that God would set your heart right with God would you just humming out and this very still moment raise your hands I don't care who you are would you do it just I raise my hands to God God bless you [Music] how are you looking in the mirror I asked you a Christ name are you looking to God amen praise the Lord

by the grace of Almighty God brother again I was going to highlight some things concerning the rich young ruler and the prophet of God I lighted it much of it my brother I pray grace that we're gonna learn from it to make well we say make our calling election short make your leadership Shore Amen that you're under the anointing of the right spirit with the right attitude by the grace of God please in the name of Jesus don't take it for granted don't take it's just so it's just another message by William Branham and so on no it's one of the last messages he preached and a number of times he mentioned his own his own going they wasn't gonna live much longer and he was only but basically he was only here for about two two weeks after he preached this a man he preached this on the 7th and see I got a note here considering the date of the accident he preached another 7th on the 18th the Lord called no you know just think he knew he knew and he again like I said during the Easter of 1965 he said err I see myself I see myself he said my life coming to an end he said 56 years old yeah he had just celebrated his 56th birthday but he saw his life come to an end a man so brothers sister the grace of God to us and it was the Lord laying this on his heart concerning leadership well brother I tell you it is any message we need to do we need to hear at the end of a prophetic ministry of William Branham was leadership Amen because why because it is anything we need to be sure is the leadership we have in our lives today well leadership is not leadership leading us into a church leading us into a denomination or leading us into this doctor or that doctor but brother we need the leadership that's going to take us into what God is doing in this hour and what is it it's the resurrection and the rapture brother let's not be under the leadership of what the devil is doing what is God doing and am I am i under that leadership so God is using me to do what he wants to do a man he's got he's got to elect there somewhere predestinated for Dane in whom he is going to bring to bring into manifestation the resurrection and the rapture brother no wonder that that Jesus questioned Martha Martha believe us though this that he was the resurrection and he was about to delay of his life laid down but he said but do you believe this I am the resurrection and then he laid down his life and pick it up again amen so the grace of God to us brother to make our leadership Shore to make sure it's the court ended now how do we know that well then let the leadership lead you according to the word and according to what God is doing a man not what he's done brother when it comes to William Branham when it comes to the doctrine the mystery of the seven seals that's all history God did it but brother why did he do it brother listen Ephesians said it is by grace through faith we are safe and that not of ourselves that the gift of God faith is God's leadership God did what he did to give us the faith that would lead us into the resurrection and the rapture amen then the Prophet is highlighted the fact that what God has done he said what for he says to give us rapturing faith a man Luther got caught up with what God revealed to him Wesley got caught up with God God revealed to him and the salvation army as well and and then the Pentecostals they got caught up with God God was doing in their day the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit they live for it and died for it well though well we got on the private-eye lighters into this message now we've gone on so what it was God looking for us now Luther yes Wesley yes Pentecost yes plus the right age and what's in the right age the resurrection and the rapture hey man because as I said another message November 65 invisible Union a man it is is the heavenly bridegroom coming down a man for his bride he remember he came and redeemed his bride a man but now he comes to get his bright and there's an invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride and it's all praise the Lord it's going to be climax with the resurrection and the rapture to God be the glory please we're looking at the world we see this happening that happening this happening oh yes all brother and even just even though our weather it's not not normal no more because they're all they're all talking about climate change and it because why because there's something change you know 30 set in space yes scientists is acknowledging that now that why is all this happening why is that happening well they said it's something going on up there what is it brother it's God bringing make it bringing make it an end of it he's God what is he gonna do he's gonna destroy the this evident this earth a man he sees all guys gonna have a new heaven and a new earth and the prophet of God said well basically he said God is going to put the the the old leaven and the earth he sits through the same thing he put you through and that's the new birth he said it'd be like a new birth a new heaven and a new earth I'm offering four I'm longing for it I'm thirsty for it I'm I'm sick of this old brother if you got God in you you got Christ in you you hate it you hate Jesus hated it like I said we're gonna had the same attitude Jesus said and what did you just say oh he said much longer what I'd be with you Oh can you imagine would be the influence said they had on Jesus for him to say that how much longer shall I be with you oh gee Oh faith and so on I found some notes that somebody had given me and they were trying to preach on or not preach on it but trying to show me that when it comes to the scripture we should you want to that we should practice this in the stresses in the scripture and that's the lane on Avance you know the lands on this one lands on that one and so on and there's all all kinds of Scripture in that they had written down and give to me to prove that we should be laying ants on one another laying hands on one another oh and I said well I said amazing but I suggest three or four scriptures here said they've overlooked I said the the faith that pleases Jesus that please Jesus wasn't a laying out of hands amen brother exactly the faith that please Jesus will speak the word only yeah it's like the like the met the Centurion he said Lord I'm not worthy you should come into my house but and what was it Oh brothers sister and it wasn't it one of his sons and wasn't the daughter was this waste that was sick it was a servant a servant but he had that he had that concern for his servant yeah he wanted his servant healed and he saw not worthy I'm not worried you come under my roof he said Lord but he says speak the word only and my servant surely shall he be healed and live and Jesus was amazed he said I have not found no so great faith he said no not in Israel oh that's what he was looking for and he said praise the Lord he said go he said as you have believed so you'll find hallelujah and his servants came but better as since your servant to see you he's healed he said what went and it was exactly the same time that Jesus spoke the word praise the Lord rather God we got to get away from the physical into the spiritual it's not the lane I'll advance naturally it's believed the Word of God brother boy that's like the problem God says you can't believe for healing are you gonna believe for the rapture hey it and they're not gonna lay hands on you for the rapture you gotta believe the word God has given us the word that put us into the resurrection put us into the rapture oh I mean it's got the faith of the Centurion hey man or the woman that Jesus referred to as a dog no way she said hold my daughter sickest meat this he's that and he says not meet to take the children's bread and give it to dogs he wasn't gonna lay ends on the on her daughter but she said I want you to just just pray for whatever it was her thoughts and Jesus she said lord I am a dog and the dog gets the crumbs from the master's table oh that faith Oh animes Jesus truck Jesus all wonderful he said as you have believed so you'll find your daughter and she was healed praise the Lord God give us that faith Amen for the resurrection for the rapture not believe oh this is gonna happen God's going to do this God's already done it amen the Centurion oh my he believed he said now Lord you just speak the word everything gonna be all ready well he spoke the word for the resurrection spoke the word for the rapture it's all right let's just get out of here and get into the resurrection rapture for the glory of God don't put too much emphasis on the natural and then what we push through spiritual behind us Oh Lord yeah that'll happen no we mean that will happen you got to make it happen you know you got to make it happen that's why the Prophet says God's waiting on you because we jnanis he said and know that the day increase awaiting us praise the Lord brother he said I am the resurrection rapture now he's in the bride the bride is the resurrection rapture hey man grace of God god help us to believe and now I believe but God help us to claim the promise of the Resurrection and the rapture God happens to claim the promise of the change amen brother God gonna do anything else no he's not gonna do anything else to give us the resurrection or
