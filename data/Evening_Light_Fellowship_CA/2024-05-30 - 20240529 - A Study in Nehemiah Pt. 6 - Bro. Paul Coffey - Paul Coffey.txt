Lord may we just come away a Little Closer to You Lord than when we were before we got here we just thank you Lord for all that we've done we love you so much Lord we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen okay so let's turn to Psalm 27 starting at the 11th verse it's the Rapture Psalm brother randam did in the The Rapture message before he passed on so let start at verse 11 teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are resen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord all right you may have your seats all right so this is part six in our study in Nehemiah I think the last time we talked about was other February and March so as always we'll do a quick review and uh this won't take long because it's we're no longer in the meat of the dates and all the kings and all that stuff is going to be a little bit more simple to do a review which is good for some people all right so the first point that we went through last time was that Nehemiah was not a royal he was not of Royal Blood he was not like Daniel um he wasn't a priest uh like Ezekiel was who was a first priest and then became uh a prophet when he went to Babylon or a scribe like Ezra but he was just a regular believer he was just a simple man just working away in his position and God came to him we talk about the two major themes of NE Nehemiah being restoration and maturity and how we saw that in nehemiah's life and his initial reaction to the news that he heard so he hears about the state of Jerusalem as we know at this point Jerusalem is it has the temple the temple has been restored the mixed marriages have been fixed through Ezra's um efforts but the state of Jerusalem's walls and its Gates were in disarray okay and which meant that at that time Gates and walls are for protect for protection and without protection you're open to any Thief you're open to any attack by all of Israel's enemies and at that time there were many enemies okay the Babylonians Rob the scenes because the Persians were were ruling but Israel's enemies never went away the moabites the am ammonites the amalekites all the different ones they were always there the Philistines they were always trying to take away from Israel okay so the people were in a constant state of angst and fear and distress because at any given moment what they thought they had could be gone any second their children could be kidnapped their wives could be kidnapped they could be killed their possessions stolen their crops stolen it wasn't in a good place okay so Nehemiah actually hears about this from his brother okay his brother brings it back to him tells about the state of Jerusalem and Nehemiah gets an immediate burden for the situation and then his reaction to that is that he goes into immediate prayer okay and this is the first indication that we see of nehemiah's maturity and how he reacts to trouble and stress he doesn't rely on the armor of Flesh he doesn't try to figure it out himself he goes to the main source of wisdom through prayer so that was essentially the gist of everything we went through and we talked about how his approach to God was perfect because he starts off by acknowledging God as God then he reminds God about his word and his Covenant with his people he reminds God this is the Covenant that you gave to your people through Abraham this is what you gave you swore by yourself to uphold this Covenant therefore you are obligated to follow this Covenant through no matter what he admits the sins of the people he includes himself in the sins of those of the People by repenting and says our fathers have sinned I have sinned we repent of that but we need your help now and he makes appeal to the Lord to give him favor to the king who was uh I think it was Darius at the time time could have been someone else it definitely wasn't Cyrus I forget his name now it's one of the huar or ar xeres or something so the the the the main thing that we went through all with all this was that Nehemiah approached God in the correct way he made his appeal to God and then left his request in God's hands for Gods to take for God to take over So today we're going to go through what followed that in terms of his conversation with the King how that went and his first initial uh journey to Jerusalem and how all that went okay so let's go to Nehemiah 1:1 I'm going to have all the scriptures up here it's up to you if you want to follow along I'm probably going to be moving pretty quickly if you want to you can so verse 11 so this is the very last verse in chapter one where Nehemiah is finishing up his prayer to the Lord and just to kind of get us back on the same page oh Lord I beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper I pray thee thy servant this day and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this man for I was the king's bear cup Bearer okay so a king's cup Bearer during the ancient times is is one of the most critical roles in the king's court okay cuz the king's court had multiple positions you had the the the advisers The Magicians the astrologers but the king's cup bearer was someone who had access to the king constantly okay he was there for every single meal of the king which meant that he had unprecedented access to the most powerful person in the Kingdom at the time okay and the role of the cup bearer was that he had to bring food and drink to the king and he had to drink it and taste it himself and for the reason for that was to check if it was poison or not so this the the the the person that the king would have chosen for this role had to be someone that the king first of all trusted with his life okay meaning that the person that he chose had to be trustworthy he had to be vetted he had to be a man of character a man of integrity because due to his amount of access to the king if you a want to get rid of the king who's who better than the cup bear if you want to get the ear of the king who better than the cup bear who's there three times a day so this role was a very coveted role it was a very uh valued role it was you know it was a very prestigious role okay so by Nehemiah being in that role in the first place especially as a Jew at that time was unprecedented okay but we see throughout this time in history God raises his sons of God into unprecedented positions you see it with Daniel you see it with the three Hebrew children for whatever reason God wanted these Godly men in these prestigious positions okay and at that point is probably just to show forth his glory through through those men especially with Daniel the what a witness Daniel had on that Kingdom so the key here is that Nehemiah due to his access could very easily just go straight to the king and say this is what I need you know the state of of Israel Israel is one of your provinces it's not a good place you know if if things keep on going people could Rebel he could use all this all this logic and all this this politicking to get what he wants he has the full right to he has the ear of the king the king trusts him the king likes him but he doesn't do that okay because ultimately according to the scripture here the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord as the rivers of water he turneth it withersoever he will because Christians don't politic Christians trust Christians wait and they're willing to go through some suffering of waiting in order for the right time okay because God is a god of timing we we see throughout scripture and I've taught it in Sunday school many times that if you're not willing to wait any anything that you do during that time that is outside of the timing of of of God is fully on your own head you look at Abraham and ishmail Abraham has been given a pro promise of his son there's a time of waiting okay and Sarah is looking at her own body thinking there's no way the promise can come through me and she works on her husband saying there's no way that it can to happen through me Abraham listens and they created an ishmail and that problem has continued down to this day because they didn't allow their faith to cover the circumstances because they weren't willing to wait they created a whole mess was there Grace of course there's Grace but it's better just to wait on the Lord's timing because you're save yourself a lot of scars you save yourself a lot of hurt so again by him not taking advantage of his position we see another sign of his maturity and his Integrity this a man that knows God opens the doors I don't kick down doors I have full right right I'm I'm I'm a Jew I'm a son of Abraham I am an administrator I am I'm in a position of great influence and I could change the situation but anything we do in our own flesh by our own will is going to turn to dust and it's going to end badly okay so we come then to chapter 2 and just beginning of verse one it says it came to pass in the month Nissan in the 20th year of AR ex xeres the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king so just going to pause here for a second so the Jewish calendar has different names obviously we go by the the Greco Roman one and the month of Nissan is equivalent to march today right previously at the beginning of chapter 1 it says that Nehemiah hears about the state of jerus in the month chisu which is present day November okay so he hears it in November and nothing happens until March which is a five-month gap so for five months he gets this burden but he doesn't move right away for five months he sits he waits and he prays despite having access to the king three times a day day in day out okay and why is that God has perfect timing Nehemiah knows not to move until God says go and that's character character has has the strength to be able to withstand the pressure of waiting and within that there's a faithfulness that we see in Nehemiah and brother BR has a great quote here that talks about faithfulness and patience being hand in hand now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in James 1:3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there's absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience how Godly how highly God regards his outworking of our patience is seen in James 1:4 but let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting for God this is the process of character development and patience is a virtue patience requires strength because you see it like whether or not you make a request and it just sounds like there's nothing God's not answering God's not moving it's frustrating but what God is teaching us is that if we're willing to wait he will reward us according to our hearts the desires of our hearts but if we move ahead of him it's going to be trouble okay so we go to uh the next verse here so it came to pass in the month Nan in the 20th year of art exes the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king now I had not been Before Time sad in his presence wherefore the king said unto unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou are not sick this is nothing else but sour of heart then I was very sore afraid and said unto the king let the King live forever why should not my countenance be said when the city the place of my father's supplers lith waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire then the king said unto me for what Dost thou make request so I pray to the god of heaven so first of all here he waits for the opportunity to open to him okay he's not bringing this to the king he's letting it come to him he's waiting for the perfect time when the king does make the request you see here he's saying so I pray to the god of Heaven which is an instantaneous prayer because the next verse is literally saying he gives what he um essentially tells the king what what he's wanting so in that moment despite having praying through that five-month period and that five-month period he's praying not only is he praying he's praying through okay and there's a difference between praying about something and praying through about something praying is simply you pray about it and then you move on praying through is when you're so serious about something that you're you're not wanting at all to be outside of the will of God and what happens when you pray through is that you get away from your own desire you get neutral and that's key to finding the will of God is that you have to be neutral you have to be willing to hear the the word no okay and that's the problem when people just pray about something and then they move they're not wanting to hear the honest truth about what is actually good for them and if it's going to bless them but if you're willing to pray through you're leaving behind any selfishness any desires that you may want because at the at the end of the day what is best for us is God's perfect will not his permissive will and if we're willing to go through work cuz it is work you have to pray through any any major decision even minor decisions we ought to be praying through about it and willing to sit there and wait for the answer and there's times where it comes quick and there's times where it comes slow because what ultimately what God is developing in you is the ability to to sit there despite silence despite not feeling his presence despite not feeling the blessings of God for you just to sit there and to pray and to pray and to pray and to pray and to pray until you finally get an answer because it's it's kind of like when when um you know you're you're in a ship stormy seas and there's no hope and you throw the anchor over the side that Anchor It Takes Time For That anchor a to hit the hit the the the seabed but then it will drag along the floor if it's sand until it hits something that strikes it and once it strikes the Bedrock then that anchor grips and holds and during that entire time of that anchor going down those Sailors are just waiting and waiting for that anchor to hit something strong their only hope is in that anchor hitting something strong so when that anchor finally hits that rope or or the chain goes tot and that doesn't matter what happens above no matter how high the winds go that boat is going nowhere because it's relying on something stronger than itself that it can't see despite what's going on and that's the key to prayer is that when you toss your prayer to God it may take time it may take time and it's dragging along the seabed it feels like nothing's happening but if you stay with it if you stay with it and pray and pray and pray and pray through finally you get the answer and it's unbre breakable it's unmovable no matter what happens to you no matter what people say to you it's not going to shake you and that's what praying through is is getting past yourself it's getting past yourself and taing into that eternal life that's inside of you without anything interfering without any noise without any distractions and I've I've had my own life where it's just if if you don't do that there's uncertainty and you just you're always questioning whether or not you're supposed to be there so there there's a rest and there's an assurance that comes from praying through you know it's it's that song what what needless sorrow what needless pain we Bear all because we do not give it to God In Prayer it's needless you know what the problem is the problem is is that there's a constant pressure to move on to the next thing there's always something to do there's always something that comes up I I was doing my devotions the other day and um I hate it when I sleep in because you got to you know get your devotions in and you got all these notifications coming at you and I was doing my devotions and I have I left my my laptop open and my phone on and it was 15 dings in a matter of 45 seconds it's likeing and if you're trying to read your Bible or pray it's it's mind-numbing and all those things are just pulling you every time to check it and that's the way that the devil has designed the world today is that it's it's constantly pulling at you trying to shift your attent your attention away from him to something trivial cuz at the end of the day if you don't answer your phone if a client is is is calling is it the end of the world no is is this super urgent thing super urgent at the at the end of the day no if God wants you to pray pray for a bit you know you don't need to pray for eight hours but give God his time and he'll take care of you seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you so it's just it's imperative it's imperative that like you learn how to follow his leading but it requires your spirit getting quiet because it's it's like in Isaiah he talks about in quietness and in in uh in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength so getting your spirit quiet especially in this age because everything's spinning so fast you have so much technology you have so so many things pulling at you that your spirit can't handle brother BR literally says it the lateran age has so much technology and is evolving so quickly that the human Spirit literally cannot handle it that's why you see much anxiety and and Neurosis depression and all these things brother and said it it's because of technology so that's why it's our job to put these things have to be in their place in order for us to be in our place to keep our focus and attention on him because if we do that then his voice is clear his voice is strong everything has faded away you're in the inner Veil then he can lead you he can position you he can bless you there there there there's nothing getting in the way so that's that's the fight the constant fight God help us okay so in terms of this instant prayer that he does you know I'm I'm a planner I'm an organizer and I love having time for things but you don't always get that and if there's times where God Will Spring major decisions upon you that require instant decisions and that's why it's critical to be prayed up in those moments so that you're not in those moments you're not confessing everything that you've done repenting of everything get everything clear and then you can pray you don't see this here there's an King ask he prays good to go okay so he does an instant prayer okay and when you look up the instant inseason and out of season in the Amplified it says be ready when the time is right and even when is not keep your sense of urgency whether the opportunity seems favorable or unfavorable whether convenient or inconvenient whether welcome or unwelcome okay and what this means is that you can't the Bible talks about the the the man who Waits for favorable weather will never ever have a harvest if you're constantly waiting for everything to be perfect around you you'll never do anything because you're relying then on your conditions to be perfect all the time for you for a for you to be happy and content and all these things no that our contentment is not in that we're content despite the circumstances yeah me and Joe were just talking about today where it's just Paul had to learn to be content despite his circumstances the the the the prophet of first first age had to learn that he didn't have it just by getting the holy ghost or by being the preeminent man of his age so we have to be in a place where When God says go go if it's not perfect fine you know this here is a perfect example of me buying the house I want I had all these plans I had literally rows and rows and rows of calculations of interest rates and uh you know The Upfront deposit that you needed it was just rows and rows and rows Kim hated it because I I I literally talked to her one day for six hours straight about finances and she was exhausted she did not after that anytime I mentioned finances she's like I don't want to hear it I I literally can't handle it so we go we go to the states Michael gets Co we get we have to rush him to the hospital two nights in a row that was a $2,000 God Bless America hospital bill okay we made a decision to go down states to uh Kim's grandmother's uh yeah Kim's grandmother's uh funeral and then after Michael gets uh goes to the hospital time we're like I I felt you need to get back home so that's more money so I'm I'm I I literally remember to this day I was in the bathroom downstairs in my mother-in-law's house in the bathroom with my head my my hands were in my head and I was just like so much for the house so much for the house just money gone and I and it distinctly remember there's a voice just dropped down said you need to learn to trust me me with your finances I was like fine because for me it's just I I I love budgeting I love having my little pockets of savings that I can pull from and it's nice and safe and secure it's nice little cocoon that I can Retreat to and be safe without any fear but God was saying nope you rely on that way too much take out the feathers on the way home so the first thing was God provided every bit of money for the return ticket coming home completely down to the down to the scent totally covered other PE like people just started sending money out of nowhere I didn't ask for it just came just came on the way home I check VM when we land that's when uh the government was giving out the $500 price of living checks I like oh that's nice cuz 500 for me 500 Kim okay great and then literally we land within probably 5 to 10 days we found the house had just enough money for the down payment had uh everything we needed for the lawyers fees everything I needed to get a new wood stove everything down to the dime I had just enough despite all this money gone God provided down to the scent and ever since then he's required me to trust me with his finances with my it's not my money it's not my money and I've had to learn it and cuz you know it's just I try to take after dead be financially astute and be a good Steward and but when God wants it to teach you a lesson you're fighting the air if you're just trying to just go all these different ways of getting security but our security is within the word and it's within him and it's no different than say me and Kim like I I if I want Kim to trust me I want to Kim to trust my decisions for her I want her to to know that I will provide for her when she needs it I may say no sometimes but when I do say no it's for a good reason I want her to trust me and God wants to trust God wants us to trust him to trust us with our desires for our wishes for our need needs no matter what it is he wants us to trust him and eventually it's like a snowball when you start trusting him with the small things then you start trusting him for the bigger things and that's how you get go to the Rapture it's a day-by-day process of line upon line and learning to trust him that's it it isn't this big I got to pray and pray and pray no it's it's it's daily walking with thee all right moving on so this is NE responding to the King after praying in that moment and I said unto the king if it be if it pleased the king and If thy servant have found favor in thy sight that thou would send me unto Judah unto the city of my father sepers that I may build it and the King said unto me the que Queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when will thou return so it pleased the king to send me and I set him a time moreover I said unto the king if it pleased the king let letters be given to uh given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till I come over into Judah and a letter unto ASAP The Keeper of the king's Forest that he may give me Timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which app pertain to the house and for the wall of city and for the house that I shall enter into and the King granted me according to the good hand my God upon me so at this point this five months praying God gives neiah desire of his heart but the key thing that he is Nehemiah is his authority Nehemiah now has the Persian King's Authority the Persian Empire at this time are the main Empire of the world they defeated Babylon they are the they are the great Kings okay so because he has the authority now and he has a seal on those papers those letters any person that he shows that seal to has to obey it if they don't obey it they are open or really they're at risk of the Wrath of the King of Persia so the full weight of the Persian Empire is now behind Nehemiah the full weight anyone who disobeys in Nehemiah is disobeying Persia so this uh quote he says in 64 scriptural signs of the time say for instance a policeman standing out in the street he weighs 110 lbs and here comes a whole row of traffic at 80 M an hour 300 horsepower engines in them and they're buzzing down the street 300 horsepower engines why that little fellow doesn't have power to stop one of them but just let that bad shine and raise up his hand listen at The Brak squeak watch them slide sideways it is in his power the stops him it his authority and the church has an authority from Jesus Christ in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues if they take up servants or drink deadly things it'll not harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that's his given Authority now why if the same little policeman is afraid to raise his hand and step out in that traffic he better take off the uniform present the badge back because he'll never make a policeman neither will he ever make a Believer as long as we're afraid to exercise the authority that's been given us by Jesus Christ we have Victory we don't have to fight for victory we already have Victory he conquered for us not us he conquered for us we're not the mighty conqueror he is the mighty conqueror and this is key to us because he's saying that man in himself he's 110 pounds does not have the power to stop those cars it's the badge the badge it has the power to stop those cars so he's not has the power within himself to do that the badge has the power behind any Authority is the power and when we're given the Holy Ghost we're presented with a token and that token is the authority that says all Heaven and Earth belongs to God which means that you have to listen to him so when we present that token it's saying all of Heaven is behind this token you cannot stand up to it you do not have the power within yourself but God has the power and when you present that token it's showing Authority and that power is behind that Authority okay but the key thing is is that you have to show it you have to present your token when you go to prayer to God you have to present your token to God saying this is the purchase price of your blood you said in your word that buy buy your Stripes I am healed if you present that he has to honor that then it's a matter of time it's not always an immediate yes it could be a maybe it could be a matter of time but our job is to present it you have to hold it out you have to present it to the situation in order for God to move on it that's the key thing that he's saying there if he doesn't have the courage to step out then he is no good to him but you have to step out you have to move out into the situation in order for God to start moving but Authority is a is a tricky thing because it has to be in the right Channel and you look in scripture and and you see that uh a person that is fit to rule is always given Authority they never take it okay and what's key there is that Authority always comes from a higher authority you look at uh Aaron Aaron is made high priest by who Moses who is the word Prophet for that time Aaron is not taking the authority he's being given it by Moses to be the high priest you look at Joshua Joshua is given Authority by Moses to be the next leader he doesn't take it you look at Gideon gide Gideon was commissioned by the angel Gideon doesn't take it it's a higher authority coming to Gideon David was given Authority by Samuel when he was anointed okay always a higher authority giving Authority okay key thing about authority authority is always under another Authority there's no person on their own that they're their own entity there's only one person who's not under any Authority that's God the other person who tried to get out and not have any uh to be their own authority was the devil I will I will Ascend as the most high I will be as stars of the heavens Etc so when anyone takes Authority it's always an antichrist spirit because it it it started in heaven Satan not being content in his position in heaven was cast out because of Pride and because he tried to take authority and that carries on down you look at absum absum tries to take authority from his father the king in order to be the king you look at Jezebel Jezebel takes Authority away from the priesthood and from the prophets to be the Priestess the prophetess of Baal okay so all of these situations where the person is taking Authority the mo of is always wrong they're not willing to wait they think they can do a better job than the person who's doing it their heart is um really puffed up with pride because you saw it with with the devil he was puffed up with pride wanted to do it himself okay so it always the motive is always wrong and then the fruits of it are wrong and always ends in death you look at absum ends in death look at Jezebel ends in death you look at the Devil ends in death the death he gets cast into the Lake of Fire so when someone takes Authority it shows they have an antichrist spirit because God's people are always willing to wait they're always willing to be ready to be given Authority because the key to Authority is that you have to be ready to handle it God cannot give authority to someone who cannot handle it otherwise you'll destroy with it and that's always the principle you have to wait if you're not willing to wait you'll hurt people and in that process of waiting you develop the character and the ability to handle that Authority and it's always a process of time anything that's given quickly is never appreciated but secondly there there there's no appreciation for the authority and what that Authority could do that's why uh David is such a a blessed character in The Bible because he no matter how many times he has the opportunity to kill Saul he doesn't do it because if his kingdom begins in blood it ends in blood but he also knows that God anointed him for a purpose and for a time and when that time was up he would be ready to rule so the the the the the principle is that you have to wait and it can even come down to relatively minor things or uh in this case not minor but you look at Saul Saul was in a situation he's told by the prophet to wait until I come it's seven days and it looks like Samuel is late Saul panics and takes the position of a priest and offers the sacrifice and what that happen and when that happens Samuel immediately shows up and God has to take away that Authority why because Saul stepped from his position and Authority as a king into the position and authority of a priest which are two very different things a because God had a bloodline that require that that was that wase predetermined by God to handle the word for that time and what Saul was doing was that he was taking Authority in a position that wasn't his and God immediately takes the kingdom away from him immediately because God doesn't play around does not play around and it was the first time once he took that Authority for the first time done because God if if if Saul did it the first time he would do it a second time and that that's how Saul was it would would have continued and same thing for us no matter how small it is you have to wait for the predetermined time that God has appointed for you to take that position only then will God be able to bless it because it has to come from him to you if you take it for yourself thinking that I can do a better job than him or her or whatever it may be it's going to begin badly and it will end badly the fruit of it is always death so Nehemiah has been given the king's Authority the full weight of the Persian kingdoms behind him so we're going to look now at where Nehemiah is in scripture because Nehemiah is not just mentioned in Nehemiah he's mentioned in Daniel so if you go to um Daniel 9 verse 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to finish transgression and to make an an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in Everlasting righteousness and to seal up div vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score in two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in Troublesome times okay that last line is nemiah and brother Bram confirms this in two places Nehemiah went and got an order from the King and built the wall and some time the walls and it will be built in Troublesome times and many of us remember when it was built they had a mortar Block in one hand and a sword in the other to watch the enemy and it will be built in Troublesome times so over a 100 years before Nehemiah has been sent on a mission to Jerusalem he has been prophesied in scripture to do that okay so he is now living within the vision he is living within prophecy he has a place in scripture he has the full weight of the Persian Empire behind him he has the favor God and he has a burden for the situation and he has been prepared for this role through the many years that he's been serving the king Faithfully without complaint without anything so this man has been specially picked by God to do the work that he has been given so not only does he have the full weight of the Persian Kingdom Beyond him he now has the full weight of the Heavenly Kingdom behind him so any person who comes up against him is coming up against almighty God so once that move of God begins rolling because this was prophesied 100 years before and God knew that there was going to be appointed time of waiting before this would be manifested and during that time especially after the the the temple was built it just the work just stopped and the people suffered and they groaned and they suffered and they groaned but they didn't know that God during that time was preparing a man God was answering their prayers behind the scenes without them knowing it and that's why you have to be patient within your trial because God does not work by sight he works by faith and if we have the faith to be able to see the Unseen you will have the strength to be able to endure until your faith becomes sight if we walk by sight it wouldn't be faith and faith is hard faith is hard for the flesh the flesh wants it easy the flesh wants it now but God is training his people not only to be a blessing here but to rule over there and that's why we have to go through all these sufferings so once that move of God begins rolling nothing can stop it all of Heaven is now behind Nehemiah and Satan was going to rise up against Nehemiah Time After Time After Time and we're going to start talking about the The Men Who came up against him and they're a great example of how the devil works because the devil will try different tactics with you he's constantly trying to find a weakness or a port hole or a back door in which you are weak and that's why you got to be in your position because within your position is protection okay within that that position you have authority and that Authority has protection from above and without that you're on your own and you're going to suffer for it so God was going to keep raising that standard and to deliver Nehemiah so brother BR has this great quote here from 63 just once more just one more time lord yes when they tried to fence in the power of God they found out that they could not do it Sanson picked up those great big iron gates that would have weighed tons walked up on the hill with them and laid them down certainly nobody was going to take after him they know better and when a man comes in the anointing of the Holy Ghost and with the word of the Lord with thus sayith the Lord you better have better sense than try to attack it cuz you'll find the there's a hand of the Living God and it's heavy it's heavy and God was going to deliver Nehemiah from the many attacks of Satan in order for him to do the job that he needed to do here so in terms of those three men we see them here now in verse 9 then I came to the governors beyond the river and I gave them the king's letters now the king had sent captains of the army and Horsemen with me when selat the horonite and tobiah the servant the amonite heard of it agreeed them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel so there's two men mentioned here there's a third man in the next few verses but he's only mentioned twice so these two selat and toaya are our two main villains and we see exactly what character they made of by their reaction here it griev them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel so toaya is mentioned here as an amonite and amonite was the uh one of the descendants of the daughters of lot we all know how that began uh which the amonites were one of the the groups that God had driven from the promised land for the Israelites and he was a leader um he was a governor portion of Samaria there whereas selat he's called a horonite right so a horonite is someone from the city it's a city of Moab called horum okay and Moab was the other descendant of the other daughter of lot okay and same the those people came from the same uh product so he was a moabit who was a leader and he was a leader in Samaria and he was a leader of the Samaritans and we talk about the who the Samaritans were they were the mix of the northern tribes of Israel with the Assyrians and Etc so if we go to the next slide here selat is a perfect type of Satan and sin so the town that he's from it means anger the word selat in Assyrian means sin is quickened that same word in Babylonian means May sin give him life and finally in Hebrew it means Bramble Bush or enemy in secret let's go to the next one so our Bramble Bush a Bramble Bush right here is any rough Tangled prickly shrub especially Hardy plant Bramble bushes can also become a nu and garden sending down strong suckering roots amongst Hedges and shrubs and being particularly resilient against pruning many consider a weed to its tendency to grow neglected areas and it's sharp tough Thorns which can be hard hard hazardous sorry to children and pets so just put in sin and it all works it's a nuisance it sends down strong suckering roots it's particularly resilient against pruning it's considered a weed to its tendency to grow neglected areas and it has sharp tough thorns and it's hazardous to children and pets so a bramble bush is anyone who's fell into a raspberry bush that's a Bramble Bush it hurts and it pokes and it tears and it's not pleasant and they grow in the weirdest places and there's always a trap when you're raspberry picking you you step and it's 40 feet down despite there being a bush it's awful so sambat is a type of a Bramble Bush and you look at the the the Bramble Bush there on the right look how how big those Thorns are and that's what sin is sin's going to tear you apart it grows in neglected areas if you neglect areas of your life do not be surprised to see that and good luck clean it out it's going to it's going to take some pain it's G to have some cuts and you're going to be bleeding afterward it's going to be H sin neglected is going to be hazardous to your children it's going to send strong suckering roots to steal nutrients from what is valuable in your life it's especially hearty it's resilient to pruning sin is resilient it's strong and it requires you to be on top of it and how do you get ahead of it you got to apply the token you have to be a Watchman of your home you have to be a Watchman of your heart and a watch and man always says a Watchman looks out he looks around he looks behind him and he looks within him everywhere is accounted for there are no areas that an enemy can sneak in and that's the way that a Believer is supposed to be you're supposed to be constantly applying the token to every area of your life outside around you behind you in you everywhere it's like when they were spreading the blood don't don't put on sparely soak it soak the lentil and that's the way that God wants it in our lives apply the blood liberally because otherwise sin has an opportunity to grow and it starts off as a seed that grows into a choot that eventually ends up like this so s blat the Bible's very clearly saying this guy is not going to be a good time he doesn't have nehemiah's best interest in mind and you see here he just keeps on popping up in most random of places Nehemiah will kick him out and then you see later in scripture samad's son has married or Sam's daughter has married the high priest so Nehemiah comes in and is like get out he literally body and bones takes it wasn't selat it was the um it was toaya nemiah literally comes into the temple sees Tobi there and says take some body and bones and throws them out of the temple and I'm about to read why he does that so if we go to Deuteronomy 23 so Tob is the amonite and sand blat the Mite an amonite and or mite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to their 10th Generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever because they met you not with bread and with water in the way when you came forth out of Egypt and because they hired against thee balam the son of beor of pethor of mes Mesopotamia to curse thee nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken unto balam but the Lord thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because the Lord thy God loved thee Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days forever that was how the Jews were supposed to treat amonites and moabites and you see now why Ruth had such a hard time it was not an easy decision that Ruth made because she was coming in as this and there was a reproach on that that's why it's such a beautiful story because it's just total restoration and God wipes it clean and puts her right into the lineage of Christ so Nehemiah as a Jew being trained in the law knows that an amonite and a moabite you do not seek their peace nor their prosperity all th days forever okay so we go to the next verse so I came to Jerusalem and was there three days and I arose in the night and I and some few men with me neither told I any man what my God have put on my heart to do a Jerusalem neither was there any Beast with me save the Beast that I rode upon and and I went out by Night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well into the dung port and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire then I went onto the Gate of the fountain and onto the king's pool but there was no place for the Beast that was under me to pass then went I up into the night by the Brook and view the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned and the rulers knew not whether I went or what I did neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work so what Nehemiah is essentially doing is that he arrived but then he wanted to see the situation for himself so he goes out by night and Views every single gate in every portion of the wall and seeing okay what is salvageable here what is really bad what requires the most amount of attention and as any good project manager would do he then is probably this just me talking he's probably triaging this and determining okay this needs the best people on this gate this gate is really bad so it's going to require the skill set and going down the line he is not just going off the word of his brother he's going and seeing it for himself because his job was to restore and he's going to be a good Steward so he reviews the condition of the city and then he goes to talk to the people cuz up until this point he has not said anything he's not given his purpose to them so verse 17 then said I unto them ye see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lith waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the house the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more reproach then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me as also the king's word that he has spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hand for this good work so at this point the people are like a sheep without a Shepherd they haven't done anything they have no hope they have no leader they have no strength they have no ability to push back on their enemies and therefore the condition of the land has stayed as such God sends a man and Nehemiah goes into to them and essentially gives them his testimony and his vision okay and his vision is this is what God has blessed me to do he has blessed me so far we're going to do the good work and they catch the vision and rise up with him to do the good work so God is using a Godly Man to take the situation by the horns okay and in a time of chaos God always Rises up somebody to start initiating the work because God has to use men he has to use women to fix things whatever it may be okay you see it in um brother B talks about all it requires is one praying person it could be a child could be a woman could be a housewife could be anything them praying God just needs one to bring God on the scene to start a work John just talked about it with that woman who set she had a burden for those meetings paid for the venue just gets one sold and deal Moody and that man just went a fire so that's all God needs is one person given over to him yielded in their place positionally positioned for them to move and for God to move through them cuz that's all he needs he needs a conduit what's a conduit it's just a pipe it has no characteristic of its own other than just being a vessel so it just that whatever needs to go on top of it goes out the other end and that's how we are God pours in his spirit and it should go out to bless others so if we read here in the seven Church age book The Ephesian Church J he says now I want to see I want to say that I believe in leadership but is not the leadership of men I believe in I believe in the leadership of the Holy Ghost coming through the word I believe also that God has sent Men set men in the church men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order I believe that I believe also that the church is ruled over by men that God sends to take charge by but that rule is by the word so that is not men really ruling but the spirit of God for the word and spirit are one and that's critical because it's not men of their own accord doing their own wish it's men yielded to the Holy Spirit led by the Holy Spirit doing the will of the father because without it you look at this model and in that first church age that Spirit of niol nianis looks similar to that men taking charge men leading but the difference here is that these men are led by the spirit which means that they're a servant to the people not a tyrant to the people what nickel adism did is that it cut off the source of the spirit to the people so that the people had to go through them to God okay so the balance there is that the church should always be in Perfect Balance where the pastor is not over the church he's a servant to the church the deacons are not over the church Church they're a servant to the church the the church gives these men The Authority by the Holy Spirit and then those men by The Authority that's given to them by the people put things in order keep things in order do the will of the Father by the authority of the people so it's always in Harmony and when it gets out of whack you see it where the the pastor starts ruling the the church it it's it's Anarchy and it crushes the people and you you'll see it I I've seen it when I visit other other churches there's one brother especially in Brother Paul's church that came from another church and it was like that where the pastor just it was abusive not physically but it was just he held them over hell constantly and it was just a place where it was really he was ruling over the people and and you saw that poor man just never really got over it he was always in a state of it just it constantly in fear of of God's Wrath rather than living in Liberty because when it's out of or like in God's kingdom it's like that scripture says every joint supplieth when it's in harmony there's liberty but when it's not when you have someone who is who has decided to rule over the people with an iron fist it crushes the people it cuts off the move of the spirit in the people and the people suffer and break down down because of it so that's why that is so important men who are led by the spirit of God but have the humil humility to know that they are a servant because without it you have tyrants so the other thing here is that the people after so many years of just living in a state of disarray are Fally catching the vision and they're finally getting the faith that that that Nehemiah has for the job and faith can be contagious sometimes because you look at it when you got someone who who truly believes and is doesn't care what anyone else says it will start overriding unbelief because where light is it overcomes darkness and that's why confession is so key and that's why the right confession is is so critical is because when you start confessing by the word through faith and Paul talks it has to be mixed with faith the word has to be mixed together with faith in order for it to be strong and when you start proclaiming by faith where there your healing or testimonies or whatever that faith will start to catch on and move through the church and you see it here with Nehemiah he has caught the vision for what he needs to do and he then brings that Vision to the people and says work with me you're going to either work with me or you can leave and the people rise up with him to do the good work so that faith is so critical and this is a famous quote here Faith knows where it's standing Faith's got big muscles in a hairy chest and when he raises up with his big muscles everything contrary sits down he lets out a scream and it sounds like a panther screaming and every Jack Rabbit takes to his den face the boss all things are possible to them that believe all things well you say I might ask God too much brother brandom you can't ask him enough he loves to do it for you and he also says faith is the master of all circumstances because it's connected to someone who's unchanging and sees all things and if you can just tap into that into that source is anything too hard for God so you just start applying it to your situation by faith and God can then begin moving and it will set everything in its place unbelief has to when When Faith really takes control unbelief has to sit down all right so we see the first standoff between Nehemiah and samat and tobiah but when samat the horonite and tobah the servant the ammonite and gesim the Arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that you do will you rebel against the king then answered I them and said unto them the god of Heaven he will prosper us therefore we as servants will arise and build but you have no portion no right no Memorial in Jerusalem so the key thing here their first reaction is to scorn them to mock them and that's always the devil's reaction when you have been given a touch by God what is the first thing that happens when you step out of the church he starts picking away at that experience now that was just em motion nah that was for someone else nah n that's not for you you don't you don't have you don't have the faith to do that remember what you did last night yeah no that's not for you that's what he does he he he seeks to Rob to steal and to destroy anything he says is a lie anything he does will not prosper and that's their first reaction here they hear that Nehemiah and the people have risen up to do the good work and their first reaction is to laugh them to scorn and to despise them the second thing they do is that the lie to them will you rebel against the king Nehemiah literally has the papers in his hands with the king's seal on them and yet they're saying no you're rebelling is the king that's why you don't take anything from the devil as truth anything he says is a lie he will always contradict truth no matter what happens so nehemiah's reaction is according to that scripture that we just read in Deuteronomy an anite and a moabite have no place in the congregation of the Lord so that's why he says here you have no right no portion no right nor Memorial in Jerusalem you have nothing here you and I have nothing in common you will share nothing here and you will not have any part with us and that's the key thing key thing here with Nehemiah he knows who he is he's a Jew a part of the Covenant of Abraham in his land doing God's bidding and what God told him to do in restoring Jerusalem he has been prophesied in Scripture that this would be done in troubl sometimes he has the king's Authority and he has God's Authority for for the job but equally as important he knows who his enemy is where they are and scripture and what their end is so by knowing who his script who his enemy is he can put them where they belong and the key thing for us is that we know we should know who we are but we ought to know who our enemy is and when he comes up against this you put him back where he belongs and if he comes on your land you pick him up and you put him back where he came from and if he keeps on doing it a thousand times you do it a thousand times back because he is now outow on your land that is your portion and if he tries to come across it you have every right and full authority to kick him off so they have zero rights and Satan has zero rights to your life if he puts his hand on you he has to take it off and if he keeps his hand on there is because you've allowed him that's why we keep our life clean we keep everything under under the blood you live the best you can every day so that when Satan does come up against you you have every right to kick him off so we read here in the uh seven church8 book again now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they can get a true revelation of two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit deser and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thed today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power of him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them so Satan has no right he has no claim no Memorial in your life and that's why he fights who you are so much and there gets a point where he he won't deny the word to you because you know that you will not walk away from the word but he will make you deny who you are he'll make you doubt who you are in Christ no no you're not you're not fit to take that promise because of X Y and Z he'll give you every reason in the world if God accepted Rahab all of you are fine you're fine because if God can accept her there is no ditch so deep that he is not deeper still so there is Grace for each and every one of us and if he's brought you in into his into his heart and he has giv you his holy spirit then that's it that's it he who started the good work will finish it it's not you who finishes it it's him what's the number one goal of a Believer get the Holy Ghost what's the goal after that get in your position what's the goal after that stay in your position that's it that's the gospel that's it anything more convoluted than that I is frankly it's it's Satan because that's where we get into our own minds of I have to be this way or I have to be this big something you're not anything until God gives it to you can a man add a cubit to a stature no it's by God's grace that you have anything because what it does it levels the playing field for those those people like John the discipline the German rigidity and I can do it and I will conquer God has to allow balance there and I'm the same way I will if if if the gospel was all works I would love it because it's no thinking required a plus b equals c no thinking it's easy but what God wants is us to be reliant on him that no matter what how strong your strengths are you're always reliant on him it's not your discipline it's not your inner strength yes I can get up every day and I can read two chapters pray for two hours before the sun even Rises like no it's not that it's not that there's times where it's going to be a a very quick prayer while you're making the kids breakfast and if that's it for the day and it's heartfelt and that's all you can do there's Grace for that should that be every day no but there's always Grace for where you're at and God is obligated to take care of you once he's accepted you it's not for you to do the type is Ruth Ruth is a rank Heathen who was of the religion where they offered children on altars of fire she comes into the land she decides to walk in the way she then gleans in the field and she's working working working until she Catch catches the attention of Boaz when she's has the cloak of Boaz on her her working time is over because what what that what that what that cloak over her meant was you're under my protection now which means that your problems are my problems you don't have to fight anymore you don't have to worry no more you can just come to me and then I take care of it for you no matter how impossible it is because I have made a promise to you and I'm not like a man who lies when I swear I swear by myself because my word is so strong no one can separate me from you and I will take care of you because I made a promise by myself that I would take you to the end and that is God's unconditional Grace Covenant to you you don't not have to work for it you don't have to think for it you just got to believe it and wait on him and he'll take care of the rest anything more than that I'm sorry but as a Catholic Spirit there's no Penance when you do wrong you don't whip yourself you don't flail yourself you don't do confession for eight hours you don't come up to the altar 14 times in a single month I've done it got the T-shirt Martin Lu poor Martin Luther would he got to the point where the priest hated him cuz he confessed for so long he would get out and get back in because like I just thought something bad they hated him with a passion because is that liberty no the moment you sin you put it in the blood it's done no guilt there's no more condemnation to them that that that totally forget that scripture how that end you know it the whole point is that there's no condemnation there's no guilt because you have come under him he now sees you through blood all he hears is your voice he sees nothing and then there's Grace for each day for you to overcome the next thing and it's you going to him saying I need help with this and as Boaz did and I love this scripture where Naomi says it to Ruth that man will not rest until this work or restoration is over for you he will not rest his job now was to work her job was to rest and what did what did Boaz say to her stay here I'm going to give you these wheat sheaves you feed on this while I come back to you and when I come back to you it's going to be done and no matter how how small or how big the problem is you can have the confidence to be able to go to him and say this is my problem and he takes it but you got to give it and leave it you can't give it and hold it because what's the hardest thing for a human to do surrender relinquish control give up your rights that's the hardest thing to do is to is to open really open yourself up to whatever may happen it is terrifying Ling I hate it I can't stand it because what it is there's a comfort there's a comfort in control there's a comfort in doing things yourself and and trying to solve your own problems because you know it's going to happen is but at least you're in control and you know what could or could not happen with God he requires you to give it leave it and then step back and just allow it to happen What come what may but but he then has the Liberty to actually fix it correctly at the root rather than constantly cutting off at the top so God is so willing so willing to be an active God in your life and the only one holding him back is you and it could be for a myriad of reasons legit reasons you know you you see the things people suffer and it's a lot and it can get in the way of their relationship with God but if you want to grow where the BR talks about it where it's you'll see a a stock of corn and it's growing it's growing but then there there could be Rock land on it and it bends the corn wheat or the the the cornstock over but it it will keep on growing cuz not cut off from the Life Source but it will grow crooked because that rock is on it so it'll grow crooked and it will go up and if you take that rock away the the thing is away the thing that was holding you back is gone but you're still bent in that shape you still feel the same because you've been in that position position for so long and brother Lon uh compounded uh expounded on this and he said the longer that rock is there the longer it takes for it to to be restored that's why you see childhood trauma things that happen in your childhood take the longest to go is because it happens when you're the youngest and when you're the most vulnerable so when that thing comes off of you you feel the same you're delivered but it's it's still you still feel the same because you're still in the same shape what brother Lonnie said is that what fixes that dwelling in the presence of the Sun and as you grow and feed on the word pray and just dwell in his presence that Brokenness will start to straighten out and there comes a point where it doesn't you can't even see where the the Brokenness was so it doesn't matter how you feel is the thing gone or not and if it is gone just dwell in his presence and you'll come out perfectly whole so dwell dwell lay in the presence of the Sun and let that greenness bake out of you because more often than not that's the part where Satan gets to us you feel the same but you're not the same he's taking care of the problem you just got to believe believe it's gone if he said it's true believe it and you'll come out whole fixed resilient and able to resist it no matter what it is and you can plug your problem in there okay we uh we're getting to the end here we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God gives us for God has a law in his word is a law and God in this word made certain claims to the church therefore we have a right to enforce these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it because we can take our God's agent because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit go right down in our knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the lands to enforce it's by the land for the land but the law of the spirit of God is to force Satan to give up that which he has unrightfully deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women children sickness of the body he placed upon the people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church has given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and force this upon him so when you are called by God into your position you have all of Heaven behind you and like shamgar before he got to a point where he was sick and and tired of the same thing happening every year they come and steal everything and I'm tired of it and God worked a miracle through him he took an ox go with just a stick with a piece of iron in the in the top of it and the First Strike should have broken it but I forget how many he killed it was like 700 or so and brother banam just talked about him so much because it was such he was a he was a farmer he was a housewife he was a you know project manager he was a count planner he was a hearing aid thing person he was a waiter you know it just it doesn't matter like it simple people who get tired of the same thing happening every day and they're saying enough is enough I have full legal rights in this situation and I'm tired of it and I'm going to start enforcing it and John said it the other day you don't need to do this great thing all you got to do is resist and how do you resist by the word that's it not this huge great effort Christ showed it he showed that the weakest believer could resist Satan just by giving Satan the word you don't have to take any of it so show Satan your token and he has no right to he has every right to flee he has to flee so if the musicians want to come up we can stand so if you read here in Isaiah 41 thou whom I have taken from the ends of the Earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou my servant I have chosen thee and not cast thee away fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee y I will help thee yeah I'll uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness behold all they that were in sense against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee Shall Perish Thou shalt seek them and shall not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing as a thing of not for I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not I will help thee it's all him wait on the Lord and He will strengthen thine heart wait I say on the Lord and God knows where you're at we all got different problems different issues and whatever it may be God sees it he hears it and there's an appointed time there's an appointed time for everything everything has an expiration date and you look at it's in Isaiah as well the amplifi does it really well and it talk talks about the Assyrians and went and it says it so well because it says when the Assyrian is within sight of his goal then God comes down and hws them like a lumberjack hewing trees and he cuts the head off when the enemy is within sight of his goal God comes down on the scene if you want a scripture that shows what happens when God finally shows up on the scene read Psalm 18 you can pull up verse one I will love thee oh Lord my strength the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my Buckler and the Horn of my salvation and my high tower I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised so shall I be saved from my enemies the Sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid the Sorrows of Hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even to his ears then the Earth Shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured C coals were kindled by it he bowed the heavens also and came down Darkness was under his feet and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yay he did fly upon the wings of the wind he made Darkness his secret place his Pavilion round about were dark Waters and thick clouds of the skies at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hailstones and coals of fire the Lord also thundered in the heavens in the highest gave his voice hailstones and coals of fire yay he sent out his arrows and Scattered them and shot out Lightnings and discomforted them then the channels of water were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke O Lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils he sent me from above he took me he drew me out of many Waters he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the Lord was my stay he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me for I've kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God for all his judgments were before me and I did not put away his statutes from me I was also upright before him and I kept myself from my iniquity therefore had the Lord recompense me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands and his eyesight with the merciful thou will show thyself merciful with an upright man thou will show thyself upright with the pure thou shall show thyself pure and with the forward th will show thyself forward for thou will afflict The Afflicted people th will save The Afflicted people but will bring down high looks for thou will light my candle the Lord my God will lighten my darkness and this is when this is when it's first God God comes down on the scene and the difference with God is that he doesn't do all of he doesn't do all the victory himself he wants you to taste victory for yourself you look at the those kings he put them all in a cave shut them up kill all of them and then he brought the captains he brought the captains to that cave and he said bring them out he said put your feet on their necks what is that showing they are beneath you they are defeated you are above them they will never rise you are the Victor this part next is God saying all right now it's your turn he wants you to have a part in it but it's only by him through you that you can do it so if we go to the next verse for by Thee I have run through a troop and by my God have I leaped over a wall as for God his his way is perfect the word of God the word of the Lord is tried he is a buckler to all all those that trust him for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God it is God that GTH me with strength and maketh my way per perfect he maketh my feet like Hines feet and Seth me upon high places he teacheth My Hands to War so that a bow of Steel is broken by my arms thou has also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand ha holded me up and thy gentleness hath made me great thou has enlarg my steps under me that my feet do not slip I have pursued my enemies and overtaken them neither did I turn again till they were consumed I have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are Fallen under my feet for thou is GED me with strength unto the battle thou subbed under me those that rose up against me thou has also given me the necks of my enemies that I may destroy them that hate me they cried and there was none to save them even unto the Lord but he answered them not then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets thou has delivered me from the strivings of the people and thou has made be the head of the heathen a people whom I have not known Shall Serve me as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers shall submit themselves unto me the strangers shall fade away and be afraid of their close places the Lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my salvation be exalted it is God that avenge me and subdueth the people under me he had deliver me from my enemies yay thou has lift me above those that rise up against me thou has delivered me from the violent man therefore Lord I give thanks unto thee Oh Lord among the Heathen and sing praise Praises unto thy name great Deliverance giveth he to his King and he showeth Mercy to his anointed to David and to his seed forever more who is his seed we are his seed that is how God reacts to your problems when the appointed time has come he delivers you and he strengthens you for war so that you can be the Victor and I love the part of it because it says he beats them to Dust Till You can't even find a shred of them left and when God's Victory is done it's complete it's total and it's it's there's nothing left of the enemy and he does that in order to show you that when that enemy is destroyed in your life you don't have to fear it ever again ever he destroys it destroys the memory of it and removes the desire so it cannot return ever again again but what it requires is surrender giving God control being in your position and letting him move through you let's pray dear Jesus Lord we just thank you for this day we just thank you Lord for your word Lord and Lord it's just it's so living and we're just thankful Lord that it just applies to every situation that we can possibly
