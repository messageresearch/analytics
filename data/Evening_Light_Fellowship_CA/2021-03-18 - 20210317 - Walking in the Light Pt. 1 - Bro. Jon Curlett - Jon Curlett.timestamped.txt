[27:29] coming in
[27:30] and not a lot of support here in the
[27:32] song leader and
[27:33] these different ones so i always
[27:35] appreciate it always appreciate when
[27:37] brother
[27:39] when brother paul can do some picking
[27:40] instead of just strumming it's always
[27:42] says it's a beautiful thing on those
[27:44] slow songs you know really enjoy that
[27:46] and man if you'll turn the scriptures
[27:47] tonight to first john chapter one
[27:49] very familiar scripture again uh
[27:53] just want to clarify one thing brother
[27:54] darin carr hasn't had surgery yet it's
[27:56] going to happen but he's waiting on a
[27:57] slot so
[27:58] he asks us to be in prayer for not only
[28:00] that for when he has a surgery but also
[28:02] that
[28:03] he would get the surgery because he
[28:05] needs it matt i'm getting a bit of
[28:06] feedback here i don't know if that can
[28:08] be adjusted at all but uh
[28:10] remember that and then i spoke with
[28:11] brother ron spencer as well this week
[28:13] and
[28:13] nothing i say here is is not public
[28:16] knowledge but uh he's been having a real
[28:18] battle there
[28:19] when he spoke he preached this last
[28:21] sunday but the sunday before he wasn't
[28:22] able to make it through the service he
[28:24] stopped about 15 minutes in
[28:26] just completely out of strength so i
[28:28] reached out to him this week to see how
[28:29] he was he did preach this sunday for
[28:31] about 35 minutes so
[28:32] he's better and as he says boo devil
[28:34] he's there to show whose side he's on
[28:36] and what he believes
[28:37] but he says it's been a real struggle on
[28:39] his body his energy levels are very low
[28:41] because he's going through constant
[28:42] chemo so he's on another 12 week round
[28:44] of treatments again so
[28:46] definitely asks and appreciates the
[28:48] prayers of the saints amen
[28:50] amen in our scriptures first john
[28:51] chapter 1
[28:54] says that which was from the beginning
[28:56] which we have heard which we have seen
[28:58] with our eyes
[28:59] which we have looked upon and our hands
[29:01] have handled of the word of life
[29:04] for the life was manifested and we have
[29:06] seen it
[29:07] and bear witness and show unto you that
[29:10] eternal life
[29:10] which was with the father and was
[29:12] manifested unto us
[29:14] that which we have seen and heard
[29:15] declare we unto you
[29:17] that he also may have fellowship with us
[29:20] and truly our fellowship is with the
[29:21] father
[29:22] and with his son jesus christ and these
[29:25] things we write unto you
[29:27] that your joy may be full this then is
[29:30] the message which we have heard of him
[29:31] and declare unto you
[29:33] that god is light and in him is no
[29:36] darkness
[29:36] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[29:39] with him
[29:40] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[29:43] the truth it doesn't say have not it
[29:45] says we do not the truth
[29:47] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[29:50] the light
[29:51] we have fellowship one with another and
[29:53] the blood of jesus christ his son
[29:55] cleanseth us from all sin if we say
[29:59] that we have no sin we deceive ourselves
[30:02] and the truth is not in us
[30:03] now he's not saying here that we are
[30:05] sinners he says he's speaking of before
[30:08] you came to christ he says if we have no
[30:09] sin
[30:10] you'll never come to repentance you'll
[30:11] never come to that place and then we're
[30:13] in a sinful condition before we ever
[30:15] accept christ and people that say i have
[30:16] no need of repentance
[30:18] i haven't done anything wrong those are
[30:20] the ones that are absolutely lost
[30:21] because they can't even come to a place
[30:23] of repentance but for the believer there
[30:25] is no sin in us and we've covered that
[30:27] in previous services where
[30:28] where uh the prophetoss he says when the
[30:30] seed of god is in you then how can you
[30:32] be a sinner
[30:33] because you are of god and there's no
[30:35] sin in god therefore there's no sin in
[30:36] you
[30:37] it's just planted in a sinful body amen
[30:40] so he's not saying you're that that that
[30:42] we are sinners here he's saying that you
[30:44] have to recognize that you were in a
[30:46] sinful condition
[30:47] and that you're going to be fighting
[30:48] that day in and day out amen
[30:50] that your perfection is not in your body
[30:52] your perfection is in your soul because
[30:53] that's where god resides
[30:55] verse 9 says if we confess our sins he
[30:58] is faithful and just to forgive us our
[31:00] sins
[31:00] and to cleanse us from all
[31:02] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[31:04] not sinned
[31:05] we make him a liar and his word is not
[31:08] in us and many came to redeem us and
[31:10] how come he has to redeem us if there's
[31:11] no sin here to separate us from him amen
[31:14] you can have your seats this
[31:15] evening amen again certainly good to
[31:18] have uh
[31:19] our amen corner back with samuel here
[31:21] and i see that
[31:22] brother matt coffey's younger uh brother
[31:24] is here or something because
[31:26] that can't be brother matt with a clean
[31:28] face amen so
[31:29] anyways good to see him i'm sure he's uh
[31:31] he's done that for work purposes not
[31:33] because it makes him look more handsome
[31:34] so
[31:36] anyways uh this evening i'm going to
[31:38] start another uh
[31:40] a short series and uh i was just
[31:42] dwelling on some things in the scripture
[31:44] that we read dropped into my heart and i
[31:45] went to just some thoughts were coming
[31:47] so i started putting them into the
[31:48] computer and that and
[31:49] when i went to put it in i found a file
[31:51] that had this exact name from 2017
[31:53] and i've been doing some some uh
[31:56] proofreading for brother mark on the
[31:57] lonnie jenkins commentary and whatnot
[31:59] and there was a couple things that
[32:00] jumped out at me in there and i just
[32:02] thrown them into a file really quickly
[32:03] and
[32:04] left it there and hadn't picked it up in
[32:05] four years almost or three and a half
[32:06] years
[32:07] four years i guess now at this point so
[32:10] anyways
[32:11] this is it this is we're not actually
[32:12] going to get to what we what i had in
[32:14] there
[32:14] but it kind of just sparked some of this
[32:16] so this evening we want to speak on
[32:18] walking
[32:19] in the light amen and as with all of the
[32:21] preaching i do we don't just want to
[32:22] just teach and give us a foundation but
[32:24] we want to make it personal
[32:25] we want to look at ourselves in the
[32:26] light and in the mirror of the word
[32:28] and and we want to move on from there
[32:30] amen we don't just want to sit here and
[32:32] know that things are right but we want
[32:33] to be
[32:34] in the rightness amen we want to be
[32:35] right we don't just want to know right
[32:38] amen this is something that has to be
[32:39] applied every day we have a daily walk
[32:42] with god and we want to grow with him
[32:44] in the things that he's showing us amen
[32:46] we don't want to stand still
[32:47] standing still is brother brown says
[32:49] you're never standing still
[32:50] he says you're always going backwards or
[32:52] forwards now sometimes you're only
[32:53] moving forward a little bit
[32:54] and sometimes you're only moving
[32:56] backwards a little a little bit but he
[32:57] says you're never standing still when it
[32:58] comes to your position in christ
[33:00] he's always growing you or else you're
[33:02] backsliding that's a tough thing to
[33:03] think sometimes and it's a
[33:05] it's a good thing for us to ask though
[33:06] at the end of the day is did i move
[33:08] forward or did i slide back today
[33:10] where did i end up compared to where i
[33:11] was yesterday amen
[33:13] but we definitely don't want to be
[33:14] standing still brother bram says this
[33:16] just to
[33:17] kind of fire us up a bit he says no
[33:19] matter what stage of the battle you're
[33:20] in
[33:21] if you backed up and said i'm afraid of
[33:23] divine healing
[33:24] i'm afraid of this that or the other i'm
[33:27] afraid about the baptism of the holy
[33:29] spirit
[33:30] speak and go forward no retreat
[33:33] don't come back there's nothing to back
[33:35] up to
[33:36] amen having left behind those things
[33:38] that are behind us what do we do we
[33:40] press toward the mark of the prize of
[33:41] the high calling amen
[33:42] he said god is always go forward
[33:46] if it is in the line of duty the line of
[33:48] his word
[33:49] go on and move on well say i know
[33:52] someone went into fanaticism
[33:54] but that wasn't you see your duty is to
[33:56] go forward
[33:57] until god gets through with you you just
[34:00] keep moving forward and as long as we're
[34:03] here as long as we haven't gone into
[34:04] rapture
[34:05] god's still working on us god's still
[34:06] growing us god's still strengthening us
[34:08] god's still changing us
[34:09] god's still sanctifying us he's doing
[34:11] all these things it's a constant work
[34:12] until we go in that rapture
[34:14] so according to what the prophet says
[34:15] theirs we should always be moving
[34:17] forward amen
[34:18] never backward the only time you move
[34:20] backwards when you've left him
[34:21] right you've got to come back to where
[34:23] he was that's the only time you go back
[34:24] but that's why he says if you're in the
[34:26] line of duty the line of his word
[34:28] always press forward and then always
[34:30] push the battle
[34:32] so for speaking on walking in the light
[34:34] the first thing we have to
[34:35] lock down is what is light amen if we
[34:37] want to walk in the light there's a lot
[34:39] of people walking in the light of
[34:40] of today that they would think you know
[34:42] with the different thoughts and the
[34:43] different isms and
[34:45] and the way that society is going these
[34:47] days a lot of people believe they are
[34:48] enlightened
[34:49] and every age has thought they were
[34:50] enlightened i'm sure the cavemen thought
[34:52] they were enlightened you know when they
[34:53] first struck fire and
[34:54] the wheel first was created in these
[34:56] different things and they thought they
[34:57] were very enlightened
[34:58] and today we certainly think that we're
[35:01] enlightened don't we
[35:02] but we want to make sure that we're
[35:03] walking in the light that this scripture
[35:05] is talking about
[35:06] and so we have to nail down what is that
[35:08] light
[35:10] so let's go to the scriptures first
[35:11] first john 1 verse 5
[35:13] and this is what we just read it says
[35:14] this then is the message which we have
[35:16] heard of him
[35:18] of christ and declare unto you that god
[35:20] is light
[35:21] and in him is no darkness at all so that
[35:24] scripture says that god is light
[35:26] but if we go to psalms 119 105 it says
[35:28] thy word is a lamp
[35:30] unto my feet and a light unto my past so
[35:33] now we have god is
[35:35] light then we have the word of god is
[35:37] light
[35:38] and so that gives us a little fuller
[35:40] viewpoint and then john 1
[35:42] very familiar scripture probably my
[35:43] favorite scripture it says in the
[35:45] beginning was the word and the word was
[35:47] with god and the word was god
[35:49] the same was it in the beginning with
[35:50] god all things were made by him without
[35:53] him was not anything made that was made
[35:55] in him was life and the life that was in
[35:58] him
[35:58] was the light of man and the light
[36:01] shineth in darkness and the darkness
[36:02] comprehended it enough
[36:03] means the darkness did not overcome it
[36:05] so now we've got a word in the beginning
[36:07] and then we've got the word is god
[36:09] and then the word is a light to my path
[36:11] and then it says the word was made flesh
[36:12] in christ
[36:13] and so christ is life and now the life
[36:15] of christ is the light of men
[36:17] so we have light equals god equals word
[36:19] equals christ equals life
[36:21] equals light of men that's a lot of
[36:23] different things for light to be
[36:25] if you were to say today what is light
[36:26] they'd say well whatever's coming out of
[36:28] this light bulb or that light bulb or a
[36:29] different light bulb
[36:30] that's light or whatever is coming out
[36:32] of the sun or these different things
[36:33] that's light but when we look in the
[36:35] word we see that life is manifested in
[36:37] many different ways
[36:38] and then there's not just a single
[36:39] flashlight a scriptural flashlight that
[36:42] shows light
[36:43] amen it comes in different ways because
[36:46] why light is an expression of god
[36:48] and we even when we look at god we have
[36:49] god the father god the son god the holy
[36:51] spirit those are expressions of god it's
[36:53] ways that god shows and reveals himself
[36:55] or ways that he acts but they are all
[36:57] one and the same god
[36:59] so when we look at light if light is the
[37:00] same thing as god then we know that
[37:02] light is going to also have different
[37:04] expressions or manifestations amen
[37:06] the very first thing god did was what he
[37:08] created light
[37:09] the very first creative act was light it
[37:12] wasn't to bring these this into
[37:13] existence or that into existence
[37:15] it was light and light doesn't have it's
[37:17] not solid it's not tangible
[37:19] light is one of the strangest things i
[37:21] won't go into it it just came to me but
[37:22] light acts like a wave
[37:24] and light acts like a particle and it's
[37:26] the only thing in the world that does
[37:27] those things
[37:28] it can bend it can turn it can be
[37:29] affected by gravity and yet
[37:32] it's an amazing thing its properties are
[37:34] very strange in the in the physical
[37:36] world amen
[37:37] but the very first thing that god did as
[37:39] a creative act as we see in scripture
[37:41] was light
[37:42] it was the pillar of fire amen brother
[37:43] branham says this he says let's just
[37:45] picture now as a little drama so you can
[37:47] get it
[37:48] let's see coming out of the space where
[37:49] there's nothing he's going back to
[37:51] genesis 1 1
[37:52] and 2 and 3. he says let's make it a
[37:54] little white light like a mystic light
[37:56] like a halo and that was the logos that
[37:59] went out of god in the beginning
[38:01] that was the son of god that came out of
[38:03] the bosom of the father amen a son
[38:04] cannot be an original
[38:06] it cannot be an original has to be
[38:07] created amen it has to come from
[38:09] something
[38:09] and brother brahm says god gave birth to
[38:11] himself and that he made
[38:13] himself a body to step into because he's
[38:15] a spirit he gave himself something to be
[38:17] seen and manifested in
[38:18] and he says that was the son and he
[38:20] called that christ
[38:21] right he called that he called that the
[38:23] son of god amen
[38:25] and that's what was in the beginning
[38:26] that was the word and the word was with
[38:28] god
[38:29] and the word was god and the word was
[38:31] made flesh and dwelt among us in the
[38:33] beginning was god and then out of god
[38:34] came the logos
[38:35] a part of god that went out of god
[38:39] so again we have all these descriptions
[38:41] we've got the light of god equals
[38:43] equals the word equals christ equals
[38:45] life equals the light of men
[38:46] and we want to make sure that we don't
[38:48] miss where that light is
[38:50] in each and every manifestation amen
[38:52] because if you look through the
[38:53] scripture
[38:54] you'll see that people got tripped up a
[38:55] lot of times because they didn't
[38:56] recognize god in its
[38:58] in his time and place brother brahm goes
[39:00] as far as to say noah was god's light
[39:02] right and all these different ones were
[39:03] god's light but there's not like i said
[39:06] a god flashlight that you can identify
[39:08] that's a flashlight that's identified in
[39:10] the scripture that means that's god's
[39:11] that's the light of the day it's not
[39:13] that simple unfortunately amen
[39:15] so god doesn't change and the light of
[39:18] god doesn't change
[39:20] but how and where that light is
[39:21] manifested is what changes and that's
[39:23] what you've got to be
[39:24] if you're going to walk in the light
[39:25] you've got to see where is god's light
[39:27] today
[39:28] amen so the light changes
[39:31] in that it goes from this one to this
[39:33] one or this way or that way or this
[39:34] person or this ministry or these
[39:36] different things
[39:37] and every time you've got to be able to
[39:38] catch the the light as it turns a corner
[39:41] and goes another way as it steps into
[39:42] another vessel as it steps into another
[39:44] message
[39:45] as it steps into another ministry you've
[39:46] got to be able to grasp those things
[39:48] so watch how this works and this is just
[39:50] a very simple example of this
[39:51] but we could see it all through the
[39:53] light all through the scripture amen
[39:55] so this is jesus talking about john he
[39:57] says ye sent unto john
[39:59] and he bear witness unto the truth but i
[40:01] receive not testimony from men but these
[40:03] things i say that ye might be saved
[40:06] speaking of john he was a burning and a
[40:09] shining light
[40:10] and ye were willing for a season to
[40:12] rejoice in his light
[40:14] so he's speaking to his own disciples he
[40:15] says look john was a
[40:17] john was a light he isn't a light now
[40:19] but he was a light
[40:21] and while he was a light you were happy
[40:23] for that time
[40:24] to rejoice in his light okay
[40:27] that phrase a burning and a shining
[40:29] light says that means that he was a
[40:31] continuously burning lamp
[40:33] that projected light and the key point
[40:35] there is that you can't just have the
[40:36] light you've got to project
[40:38] the light what did jesus say you what
[40:40] man that that has a candle and puts it
[40:42] under a bushel right
[40:43] you don't have it and then hide it right
[40:45] and god doesn't do that he doesn't give
[40:47] you light so that you can hide it
[40:48] but if you have it you have to project
[40:50] it that's the requirement
[40:52] if you're going to have the light of god
[40:53] is it's got to be projected amen it's no
[40:55] good if it's not showing outside of the
[40:56] vessel
[40:57] we're not looking for an inner light
[40:59] we're looking for a light that goes
[41:00] through to the outside amen
[41:02] so john's life john's ministry was a
[41:04] beacon to the people
[41:06] right you had all these priests you had
[41:08] the sadducees and the pharisees and
[41:09] they're going day in and day out and
[41:10] they're
[41:11] bringing the law to the people and
[41:12] they're bringing the law to the people
[41:14] and the people aren't getting anything
[41:15] out of it
[41:16] right nothing's happening it's a dead
[41:17] formal cold religion and then john walks
[41:19] out of the
[41:20] the wilderness and he's yelling prepare
[41:22] ye the way of the lord
[41:23] and he's yelling at the priests and the
[41:25] sadducees and he's saying you you
[41:27] vipers and you this and you that what's
[41:29] he doing
[41:30] he's saying something big is about to
[41:32] happen and he's shining a light in there
[41:34] in the darkness of the dead
[41:35] denominationalism that was going on
[41:37] there
[41:37] and he's saying you got to recognize
[41:39] guys something big is about to happen
[41:41] messiah is on his way he may even be
[41:44] here now i don't know
[41:45] he says but he is coming and i'm here to
[41:47] prepare the way for him
[41:48] i'm not worthy to even undo his shoelace
[41:50] but he's coming
[41:51] listen up the time is now so he has a
[41:55] message and the light is in
[41:56] john's message right then amen
[41:59] and then the people had to catch that if
[42:01] they stuck with the pharisees and
[42:02] sadducees
[42:03] they couldn't move on but if they get
[42:05] out onto john's message now all of a
[42:07] sudden they've got a chance to walk in
[42:08] the light
[42:09] i mean they've got a chance for god to
[42:10] do something with them but john's only
[42:12] got a forerunner's message
[42:14] he's not the light but he has light in
[42:17] him he's the light of god for his day
[42:18] the anointing of god
[42:20] is on john john has the holy spirit the
[42:22] scripture says
[42:23] right john has the holy spirit on him
[42:25] he's a forerunner of what's coming
[42:27] and he's preaching now something's
[42:28] coming and you better catch a hold of it
[42:31] but jesus says after the fact john was a
[42:33] light
[42:35] but he's no longer a night anymore what
[42:37] does jesus say after this
[42:39] right john chapter one the next day so
[42:41] this is speaking of john
[42:42] it says the next day john seeth jesus
[42:44] coming unto him and saith behold the
[42:46] lamb of god which taketh away the sin of
[42:48] the world
[42:49] this is he of whom i said after me
[42:51] cometh a man which is preferred before
[42:53] me
[42:54] for he was before me and i knew him not
[42:56] but that he should be made manifest to
[42:58] israel therefore am i come baptizing
[43:00] with water
[43:01] john had no idea jesus was the messiah
[43:03] until this very moment and their cousins
[43:06] right their cousins and he has no idea
[43:07] that this is a messiah but as soon as
[43:09] jesus comes in
[43:10] john identifies him and how does he do
[43:11] it he says and john bear records saying
[43:14] i saw the spirit descending from heaven
[43:16] like a dove and it abode upon him
[43:19] so he said the holy spirit comes down
[43:21] and it sits on that man and that's how i
[43:23] know that he's the son of god
[43:25] and i knew him not but he that sent me
[43:28] to baptize with water which was god
[43:29] himself
[43:30] the same said unto me upon whom thou
[43:32] shalt see the spirit descending
[43:33] and remaining on him the same as he
[43:36] which baptizes with the holy ghost
[43:39] and i saw and bear record that this is
[43:41] the son of god
[43:42] again the next day after john stood and
[43:45] two of his disciples
[43:46] and looking upon jesus as he walked he
[43:48] says behold
[43:50] the lamb of god now watch what happens
[43:52] here now
[43:54] and the two disciples heard him speak
[43:56] and they followed
[43:57] jesus so jesus testifying of john says
[44:01] john
[44:01] was a light but john's light went out
[44:06] why because the anointing now goes from
[44:08] john to somebody else
[44:10] the thing that john is prophesying about
[44:12] the thing that john is warning about has
[44:13] now come
[44:14] so john's message is over john has no
[44:17] message so
[44:18] we look here in verse 37 says this two
[44:20] disciples heard them speak and they
[44:21] follow jesus
[44:22] that seems a little bit cold doesn't it
[44:24] oh they've been with john for years and
[44:26] they've been his disciples and they've
[44:27] served him they followed him faithfully
[44:28] and they've gone through
[44:29] the trials and tribulations and john
[44:31] says behold the lamb of god
[44:33] and they leave him but that's what a
[44:35] believer does
[44:36] is that when they recognize the
[44:38] fulfillment of the ministry then they
[44:39] follow the fulfillment they don't stay
[44:41] with the ministry
[44:42] amen they're moving with the light of
[44:44] god as the light of god moves they're
[44:46] walking in the light
[44:47] they're not just saying i recognize john
[44:49] they're saying i recognize
[44:51] the the fulfillment of john's message
[44:53] and on that basis i'm going to keep
[44:55] moving on from john
[44:56] and john doesn't worry about it he says
[44:58] what i must decrease
[45:00] and he must increase why because his
[45:03] message has now been
[45:04] fulfilled what god had said was going to
[45:05] happen has happened
[45:07] john doesn't have a message anymore and
[45:09] he basically just goes around
[45:10] antagonizing people until his head gets
[45:11] cut off
[45:12] why i must decrease and he's got to
[45:14] increase because the light is moving on
[45:16] the anointing
[45:17] is now on somebody else amen and jesus
[45:20] acknowledges that
[45:21] he says he was a bright and shining
[45:22] light but he isn't anymore the lights
[45:24] moved on
[45:25] to who where does it go
[45:30] jesus said john 8 12 then spake jesus
[45:32] unto them saying
[45:33] i am the light of the world he that
[45:36] followeth me
[45:37] shall not walk in darkness but shall
[45:39] have the light of life
[45:40] so jesus said the light was with john
[45:42] john was the light
[45:44] but now i'm the light the light is with
[45:46] me
[45:47] it was with him you had to hear him to
[45:49] see me but as soon as you saw me you had
[45:51] to move to me because this is where the
[45:52] light is now
[45:53] and if you stick with me you won't walk
[45:55] in darkness but if you stuck with john
[45:56] even though you recognize john's
[45:58] ministry
[45:58] you be in darkness now because you
[46:00] haven't made the step change that god is
[46:02] is moving in the word amen but there's
[46:05] an effect that happens with this amen
[46:07] it says there he that followeth me shall
[46:10] not walk in darkness
[46:11] but shall have the light of life he
[46:13] didn't say that about john's ministry
[46:15] john's ministry didn't have this effect
[46:16] it didn't disperse darkness
[46:18] but what it did do is point to something
[46:20] else that was coming there was a light
[46:21] there that revealed
[46:23] something that was coming it was a
[46:24] prophetic light showing what's going to
[46:25] come
[46:26] but if you walked in john's ministry
[46:28] that didn't have the light of life in it
[46:30] it was just bringing you to the place of
[46:32] light of life amen
[46:33] it was pointing you to something but it
[46:35] wasn't that thing
[46:36] right john's way gave me gave john's
[46:40] message gave way for a message that
[46:42] would remove your sin that would
[46:43] eliminate its effect over you john says
[46:45] i'm
[46:45] i'm baptizing you unto repentance but he
[46:48] says here's one that's going to baptize
[46:50] you
[46:50] what with the holy ghost john's just
[46:53] trying to get the people's hearts ready
[46:55] but he says there's someone's coming
[46:56] that's going to change your life
[46:57] right not just clean you up a little bit
[46:59] but this is one that's going to change
[47:00] you
[47:01] eternally amen and now the words what
[47:04] what happens to the light the light now
[47:06] goes from words in a man's mouth
[47:08] to flesh and that's what people miss
[47:10] every time is they miss it from going
[47:12] off the page
[47:13] of the scripture or off the spoken word
[47:15] of the minister the prophet or the
[47:17] whatever it might be and now becoming
[47:19] flesh that's the shift that everybody
[47:21] misses
[47:21] they can read it in the word they can
[47:23] hear it over the pulpit but they can't
[47:24] put it in a person
[47:25] that's where we fail every single time
[47:28] amen
[47:28] so now the light so just think about
[47:31] this
[47:32] this is going to maybe be a bit of an
[47:33] obvious thing but if the people have
[47:35] recognized john's message
[47:36] and they all they did was they kept
[47:38] playing john's tapes what good would it
[47:39] have done them
[47:42] they didn't have tapes they didn't have
[47:44] you know i know this but if all they had
[47:46] done is kept playing john's sermons in
[47:48] the river jordan day in and day out and
[47:49] day in and day out
[47:50] if they recognize john as a prophet
[47:52] minister
[47:53] as a prophet messenger and they kept
[47:56] playing his tapes
[47:57] but they didn't recognize it when jesus
[47:58] came then what good would it have done
[48:00] them amen
[48:01] amen does that make sense because why
[48:05] that's where a message church is going
[48:06] to fail every time amen
[48:07] is they're going to say god sent a
[48:09] prophet but they haven't realized the
[48:10] light has moved on from the prophet
[48:12] amen the message is still right but the
[48:14] light didn't stay in that message it's
[48:16] now moved from
[48:17] words on a page to a people amen
[48:21] amen and that's what jesus is talking
[48:23] about so he says look i've got the light
[48:25] but then jesus says there's going to be
[48:27] a shifting now because i'm going to
[48:29] leave
[48:29] the light that you've recognized the
[48:31] light that you accept is going to leave
[48:33] so what's what's
[48:34] going to happen now where's the light
[48:35] going to go matthew 5 it says ye
[48:38] are the salt of the earth and if the
[48:40] salt have lost his savior
[48:41] wherewith shall it be salted it's
[48:43] thenceforth good for nothing
[48:44] but to be cast out and to be trodden
[48:46] under foot of men
[48:47] ye are the light of the world a city
[48:50] that is set on a hill cannot be hid
[48:52] remember what we said if you've got the
[48:53] light inside of you it has to be visible
[48:55] it's no good
[48:56] to have it inside but it's not seen on
[48:58] the outside the purpose of light
[49:00] is to show things and then we read that
[49:02] scripture in ephesians
[49:03] that which maketh manifest his light the
[49:05] thing that reveals is light
[49:07] light has a purpose and is not to be
[49:09] hidden amen is to be used
[49:12] so it says ye are the light of the world
[49:14] so this is all this is only in matthew
[49:15] 5. this is early in jesus ministry and
[49:17] he says you are the light of the world
[49:19] but he just said he was the light of the
[49:20] world but now he's saying ye are
[49:22] neither do men light a candle and put it
[49:24] under a bushel but on a candlestick they
[49:26] elevate it right
[49:28] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[49:29] the house let your light so shine before
[49:32] men that they may see your good works
[49:34] and glorify your father which is in
[49:37] heaven
[49:38] so jesus comes to the point now and he's
[49:40] speaking prophetically here
[49:42] right jesus is speaking prophetically he
[49:43] says i'm the light but ye
[49:45] are the light now if you looked at them
[49:47] after jesus left
[49:49] they were not the light not initially
[49:51] were they because
[49:52] jesus dies peter denies him in the
[49:55] courtyard before he ever gets crucified
[49:57] they're scattered all over the place
[49:58] they're hiding in the rooms until he
[50:00] comes out
[50:01] and then even after jesus is resurrected
[50:03] and
[50:04] and ascends in these things they're
[50:06] still hiding in an upper room
[50:08] right there is no shining of a light
[50:10] there is no city on a hill experience
[50:12] here
[50:13] what is it the light is is not in their
[50:15] hands yet but yet jesus says you are the
[50:17] light
[50:18] he's prophesying that there's going to
[50:19] come a time where this light is going to
[50:21] go for me
[50:21] and it's going to shift onto you and you
[50:23] guys are going to take my place on this
[50:24] earth
[50:26] so they're up there and they're all
[50:27] huddled in the upstairs right they're
[50:29] hiding from the authorities they're
[50:30] hiding from the priests
[50:32] it doesn't look very much like the light
[50:34] is coming out does it but then they have
[50:36] the pentecostal experience where the
[50:37] baptism of the holy ghost happens for
[50:39] the first time on a group of people
[50:41] and peter comes out and within the first
[50:42] hour he converts 3 000 people
[50:45] that's what a city on a hill looks like
[50:46] that's what a candle that's been pulled
[50:48] out
[50:48] from under the bushel looks like is when
[50:50] the light is lit by the power of god
[50:52] then there's nothing that's going to
[50:53] hold it back and all of a sudden you see
[50:54] peter makes a dramatic shift now
[50:56] from hiding upstairs to going out and
[50:58] speaking boldly and remember the
[51:00] the priest came to them and they tried
[51:01] to hold them back they said we're going
[51:03] to put you in jail
[51:04] you can't preach about jesus and what
[51:05] they do they walked right out the door
[51:06] and they started preaching about jesus
[51:08] there was no holding them back when that
[51:09] light had come to fulfillment
[51:11] and the prophecy that jesus speaks of
[51:13] here had become a reality
[51:16] amen jesus christ the man was gone but
[51:18] now he had a new body
[51:20] and it was called the church amen the
[51:21] elect the called out ones
[51:23] and there was where the light was now so
[51:26] again
[51:26] you recognize jesus as the messiah but
[51:29] you don't you've got to make the corner
[51:31] and say all right that was light but now
[51:33] where's the light
[51:34] because again you could sit there and
[51:35] you could pray jesus tape all day long
[51:38] but the light had moved into a prophet
[51:39] called paul and now he comes and he
[51:41] starts to set the church in order
[51:43] he starts to correct the mistakes he
[51:45] starts to set them on a foundation
[51:47] a perfect love for the next seven church
[51:50] ages
[51:50] and if all you did was sat there and
[51:52] listened to jesus's words you're gonna
[51:54] have a problem because now
[51:55] jesus is speaking through a prophet
[51:57] right you had to keep moving you can't
[51:59] stand there and wait
[52:00] on jesus's words you can't play jesus
[52:02] messages over and over because jesus is
[52:04] speaking again and he's speaking through
[52:06] a prophet now named paul
[52:07] and the disciples in these different
[52:08] things amen
[52:10] so if every the easy criteria for asking
[52:14] if you're walking the light is are you
[52:15] pointing backwards
[52:16] or are you pointing to here or are you
[52:18] pointing forward because if you're
[52:19] pointing back
[52:20] you're not walking in the light you've
[52:23] got to be pointing to today
[52:24] and it's got to be leading you into
[52:25] tomorrow amen that's how you know if
[52:27] you're walking in the light
[52:30] like i said that's where message
[52:31] churches fail so often is that they're
[52:33] pointing back
[52:34] to a day where the prophet was the only
[52:36] thing that god was moving in
[52:38] right and he was having healings and
[52:39] this and that and the other thing and so
[52:41] when all what they're doing is all
[52:42] they're doing is they're playing a tape
[52:43] what are they doing
[52:44] they're saying god's still back there
[52:46] god's not here anymore
[52:47] god's not moving in ministry right the
[52:50] very the very thing that the prophet
[52:51] said the bride has a five-fold ministry
[52:54] amen that that is the bride's ministry
[52:56] the very prophet that said it they don't
[52:57] hear that and so they play a tape over
[52:58] and over again and what are they saying
[53:00] the holy ghost no longer moves on men
[53:02] the holy ghost no longer moves on women
[53:04] in that way
[53:05] that it stopped when that prophet died
[53:06] in 1965 and the word of god is not being
[53:09] opened or expressed anymore
[53:10] you just have to listen to those tapes
[53:12] what happened they haven't made the
[53:13] corner
[53:14] they haven't turned the corner because
[53:15] it had to come off of those message
[53:16] tapes they had to come off of those
[53:17] message
[53:18] books and show us the light of the word
[53:21] and make it jump off the page so that it
[53:22] could be revealed in us each one amen
[53:25] what don't get stuck at william branham
[53:27] you can't get stuck at
[53:29] he was it you got to go on on to the
[53:31] where the light says
[53:32] you are it right the lights moved on and
[53:34] where is it it's in a bride of christ
[53:36] now amen
[53:37] amen the message is still true this is
[53:40] how rumors get started right john said
[53:42] brother branham is obsolete
[53:43] no no i'm saying the message is true
[53:46] right jesus words were true but you have
[53:48] to take all that jesus said
[53:50] otherwise you wouldn't recognize paul
[53:51] coming otherwise you wouldn't recognize
[53:53] the baptism of the holy spirit you
[53:54] wouldn't recognize the pentecostal
[53:55] experience jesus told us all those
[53:57] things
[53:57] and then it happened and then you had a
[53:59] prophet comes he says all these things
[54:00] are going to happen he points us back he
[54:02] restores paul's message
[54:03] and he tells us these are all the things
[54:05] that are going to happen for the bride
[54:07] so why are we looking at william branham
[54:09] he came for a bride
[54:10] he came to prepare a bride he came to
[54:12] bring a bride to introduce her to jesus
[54:14] christ
[54:15] and if we're sitting here talking about
[54:16] william branham all day long then what's
[54:18] happened
[54:18] we've missed the light of jesus christ
[54:20] that's in our mid statement
[54:21] that's working and drawing a bride to
[54:23] himself amen why because the message is
[54:26] never
[54:26] words it's always a person it's always
[54:30] got to be a person the message is always
[54:31] going to be a person the word
[54:33] has always got to be a person that was
[54:34] the point of all this was to make it a
[54:36] reality
[54:37] in our lives not just leave it as dead
[54:38] words on a page amen
[54:40] and it has to keep moving because what
[54:41] does the scripture say that that life
[54:44] that life light life was the light of
[54:47] men
[54:48] a life right it's got to be living it's
[54:50] got to be moving it's got to be
[54:51] breathing it's constantly going forward
[54:53] and that's why it says walk in the light
[54:55] it doesn't say stand in the light says
[54:56] you got to walk in the light
[54:57] because it's continually growing
[54:58] continually drawing us up to christ amen
[55:02] but paul doesn't just leave it at the
[55:04] apostles because that's what's so easy
[55:05] to say
[55:06] as well the pentecostal thing and this
[55:07] is what brother branham dealt with in
[55:08] his day wasn't it they said divine
[55:10] healing was only for that day
[55:11] and the power of god was only for the
[55:13] apostles brother braham says no sir
[55:16] why because paul didn't say that paul
[55:19] didn't say it was only for the apostles
[55:21] it was for everyone i mean the baptism
[55:22] of the holy ghost if you've got the holy
[55:24] ghost and i've got the holy ghost then
[55:25] there's no difference now there's gifts
[55:26] and callings
[55:27] and we know that men have great gifts of
[55:29] healing and faith and these different
[55:30] things discernment and whatnot
[55:32] that's different but every single one of
[55:34] us has the same god within us and every
[55:35] one of us has the same option the same
[55:37] authority
[55:38] the same power to cast satan out to heal
[55:40] to change situations
[55:42] all of these things amen it's all within
[55:44] the bride
[55:46] this is paul talking about us now he
[55:47] says but ye brethren
[55:49] are not in darkness now this is to the
[55:51] thessalonians that's not just men
[55:53] that's a bunch of people this is to a
[55:54] church
[55:57] he says you're not in darkness that that
[55:59] day should overtake you as a thief
[56:01] ye are all the children of light and the
[56:04] children of the day
[56:05] we are not a we we are not of the night
[56:08] nor of darkness
[56:09] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[56:12] but let us watch
[56:13] and be sober amen so the elect church
[56:16] the bride of christ are children of
[56:17] light we come from god
[56:18] we come from god light right and
[56:21] therefore we are light
[56:22] what we are is what our father is right
[56:24] so for children of light we ought to be
[56:26] from a father of light
[56:27] amen guess what there's a scripture that
[56:30] says that
[56:31] james chapter 1 says do not air my
[56:33] beloved brethren
[56:34] every good gift and every perfect gift
[56:36] is from above
[56:38] and cometh down from who the father of
[56:41] lights
[56:42] with whom is no variableness neither
[56:45] shadow of turning
[56:47] means there's no change there's no
[56:48] darkness there's nothing that that
[56:50] flickers with the light of god
[56:52] right there's not this pulsing thing you
[56:54] know like a campfire or something
[56:56] or you know as a battery wears out on a
[56:57] flashlight and it starts to dim and then
[56:59] flicker and these different things
[57:00] with god it's just solid light all the
[57:02] time and it's never changing
[57:04] of his own will begat he us
[57:07] with the word of truth that we should be
[57:10] the kind of first fruits
[57:12] of his creatures and then so paul or
[57:15] james is saying look
[57:17] every good and perfect gift comes from
[57:18] above and it's from the father of lights
[57:21] but who's he talking about he's talking
[57:22] about children of light
[57:24] he says it's coming from the father of
[57:26] lights amen
[57:28] none good as brother joel says except
[57:29] god himself so he says anything good you
[57:32] have in your life which is something
[57:33] that is of god
[57:34] must come from god and god only gives
[57:36] you things that he's going to use
[57:37] amen that's something for him to use
[57:39] amen
[57:41] and any kind of gift is going to be
[57:43] anything from god is something that
[57:44] projects
[57:45] the life and the love of god right
[57:48] that's it's got to project god a gift of
[57:49] god is going to project god because it's
[57:51] going to have a supernatural it's going
[57:52] to have a scriptural
[57:53] it's going to have a heavenly purpose
[57:55] it's not just for earthly good amen
[57:57] now brother brandon preaches this
[57:58] ceremony called there's a man here that
[58:00] can turn on the light
[58:01] and most of us have probably read it or
[58:03] heard it at some point and brother
[58:04] branham's in there
[58:05] and he's talking he's telling this story
[58:07] you remember how they went into a cave
[58:09] and they were so deep into the cave that
[58:12] the only way that you could see in there
[58:14] was if they had the lights turned on
[58:15] and while they're in the middle of the
[58:17] tour of the cave the lights go out
[58:20] and nobody has a flashlight nobody has a
[58:22] candle nobody has anything and
[58:23] everyone's screaming and yelling and
[58:24] they're upset and they're scared
[58:26] and somebody says don't worry i know a
[58:29] man
[58:29] that can turn on the lights right and so
[58:33] when we read
[58:33] when we read that message when we hear
[58:35] that message we start to think that it's
[58:36] about taking away fear and
[58:38] taking away worry and these different
[58:39] things and that but there's a lot more
[58:41] in that sermon if you start to dig into
[58:43] it and i'm going to just
[58:44] use this as a bit of an example because
[58:45] we're talking about children of light
[58:47] here
[58:48] and brother brahms starts to show a
[58:49] little bit of what he's really trying to
[58:50] get at here because
[58:51] he's going to do a prayer line right and
[58:53] he's going to be praying for the sick
[58:55] and he's trying to build up the faith of
[58:56] the people
[58:57] but remember this is not a message just
[58:59] for the people of that day
[59:01] this is a message for a bride that's
[59:02] going to be coming and listening to this
[59:04] and they're going to be catching the
[59:05] deeper meaning behind this
[59:08] listen to these quotes as we go through
[59:09] he's here he says now the hour has come
[59:12] for this word to be vindicated he sends
[59:16] the light
[59:16] now this is what he says the light is
[59:18] the word made manifest
[59:21] like he did in the beginning he sends
[59:23] the word and it proves itself
[59:25] there's light and he always separates
[59:28] the same is now
[59:30] as eternal little lights in the
[59:32] beginning
[59:35] notice that little phrase there he says
[59:36] eternal little lights in the beginning
[59:38] who's that
[59:40] that's me and you right the sons of god
[59:42] shouting for joy before the foundations
[59:44] of the world
[59:44] he's talking now about a people he's not
[59:47] talking about turning on your faith he's
[59:49] not talking about turning on your
[59:50] healing only he's talking about
[59:51] turning on the eternal lights from the
[59:54] beginning now
[59:55] right it's time for those little lights
[59:57] he's talking about those little eternal
[59:59] lights to get turned on
[1:00:00] how by the power of god in their life
[1:00:03] this is what a messenger is bringing in
[1:00:04] this age
[1:00:05] is he's bringing the power of god back
[1:00:06] to its full restoration in a way that'll
[1:00:09] make you the light not just him the
[1:00:10] light amen
[1:00:12] right how do you separate light from
[1:00:14] darkness
[1:00:16] how do you separate light from darkness
[1:00:18] you turn the light on don't you
[1:00:20] how do you turn a light on if we have
[1:00:22] these light bulbs here
[1:00:23] let's say that's a child of god okay the
[1:00:25] light bulb's the child of god
[1:00:27] it has the potential for light but how
[1:00:28] do you actually get it to give light
[1:00:30] you got to turn it on don't you you got
[1:00:32] to put some source of energy to it
[1:00:34] right you've got to turn on the switch
[1:00:37] and once it's on
[1:00:38] now we've got light in the old days they
[1:00:40] had a candle you had to have a source of
[1:00:42] light
[1:00:42] to turn the light on right you had to
[1:00:44] light the candle you had to get a flame
[1:00:45] started
[1:00:46] and then once it was started it wouldn't
[1:00:47] go out but you still had to have that
[1:00:49] source and he's saying here
[1:00:50] this is about that this is about turning
[1:00:52] on those little eternal lights
[1:00:54] that were with god in the beginning he
[1:00:57] continues he says
[1:00:58] there is a man present don't get scared
[1:01:01] no matter what they say i've seen it
[1:01:03] come to the spot
[1:01:04] where i didn't know where to move next
[1:01:06] but he is always present
[1:01:08] the never failing presence he is always
[1:01:11] there
[1:01:11] he can turn on the light yes sir he's
[1:01:13] just waiting seeing what you're going to
[1:01:15] do
[1:01:16] he can flip the switch anytime he wants
[1:01:18] to yes sir
[1:01:20] he says there's a man here can turn on
[1:01:22] the lights now this is what he's talking
[1:01:24] about turning on the lights from
[1:01:25] there are those who said in the regions
[1:01:27] of the shadow of death
[1:01:30] some of them now watch this some of them
[1:01:32] under cancer
[1:01:34] some of them under the death of
[1:01:35] denomination
[1:01:37] some of them under creed's death some of
[1:01:39] them under
[1:01:40] traditional death and all them kinds of
[1:01:42] death
[1:01:44] and they have seen a great light the man
[1:01:46] that flashed the lights then
[1:01:48] is the same one who said in the
[1:01:49] beginning let there be light that same
[1:01:52] god yesterday today and forever he is
[1:01:54] present today
[1:01:55] right here now don't get scared he
[1:01:58] can turn on the lights so there's people
[1:02:00] there that are there for healing but
[1:02:01] he's saying this is not just about
[1:02:03] healing
[1:02:04] this is about getting you out of the
[1:02:06] darkness that you've been drawn into
[1:02:07] through denominationalism through dead
[1:02:09] traditions and these different things
[1:02:10] he's saying you need your light turned
[1:02:12] on and there's a man here that can do it
[1:02:14] and he's not just here to heal your
[1:02:16] bodies he's here to heal your souls
[1:02:18] right he's here to turn the light on
[1:02:19] that was there before the foundation of
[1:02:21] the world
[1:02:21] and he's just waiting to see what will
[1:02:23] you do
[1:02:26] amen he's preached the word amen the
[1:02:28] light for our day is shining but now
[1:02:29] he's talking about turning on the lights
[1:02:30] plural
[1:02:31] the light of the word is coming but he
[1:02:32] says let it light your light
[1:02:34] you are the lights let it light you up
[1:02:36] now let the power of god let the word of
[1:02:38] god have the effect on you
[1:02:39] that it's wanting to do but i'm saying
[1:02:41] there's a god here that can light you on
[1:02:43] fire there's a god here that can fill
[1:02:45] you with the holy ghost
[1:02:46] there's a god here that can make you
[1:02:47] just the way he saw you in the beginning
[1:02:50] amen there's a god here that can take
[1:02:51] you from a sinner to a saint there's a
[1:02:52] god here that can take you from sick to
[1:02:54] well
[1:02:54] there's a god here that can take you and
[1:02:56] make you his life for this day
[1:02:59] right it's not just about sickness it's
[1:03:00] not just about the difficulties we face
[1:03:02] he's wanting to make us his light for
[1:03:04] this day he's saying accept the light so
[1:03:06] you can be the light
[1:03:08] accept the words that i'm saying except
[1:03:10] the position that i'm laying before you
[1:03:12] accept what i'm laying in front of you
[1:03:14] and let god do a work in you that you'll
[1:03:15] never see if you stay where you are
[1:03:17] you've got to step into this light and
[1:03:19] then you've got to start walking in
[1:03:20] today man
[1:03:21] don't hold back don't resist he's saying
[1:03:22] trust god and let him do the work in you
[1:03:24] that he wants to do
[1:03:26] he says this to be a christian
[1:03:29] means to be christ-like today how many
[1:03:32] people that call themselves christians
[1:03:34] if you said
[1:03:35] are you christ-like they'd be able to
[1:03:37] say
[1:03:38] yeah that's me because most of them it's
[1:03:42] just
[1:03:42] formal right i go to church
[1:03:46] i'm identified with the bible in some
[1:03:49] form or fashion
[1:03:50] i am a christian but if you said are you
[1:03:53] christ-like
[1:03:54] in every facet they'd probably not be
[1:03:57] able to say that amen
[1:03:59] they'd hem and ha they'd put it for
[1:04:00] another day they'd say that's not
[1:04:01] required today
[1:04:02] things have changed amen but there's no
[1:04:05] variable this there's no shadow of
[1:04:06] turning in the light that we're talking
[1:04:07] about
[1:04:08] it doesn't change he says no go go no
[1:04:11] place you wouldn't want to be if christ
[1:04:13] would come
[1:04:14] remember the service the other day where
[1:04:15] i said if christ was coming tomorrow
[1:04:16] what would you change
[1:04:18] how many of us did it how many of us did
[1:04:20] what dropped into our heart after that
[1:04:22] service or during that service and said
[1:04:23] lord i won't do that
[1:04:24] i'll put that away i'll put that friend
[1:04:26] away i'll put that situation away
[1:04:27] so brother i'm saying here he's saying
[1:04:29] dude don't go any place you wouldn't
[1:04:31] want to be if christ would come
[1:04:33] say nothing you wouldn't want to be
[1:04:34] saying when christ comes
[1:04:37] ouch amen if you some of the things we
[1:04:40] say if christ were to come down right at
[1:04:42] that moment what would we be thinking
[1:04:44] is that a rapture ready thought
[1:04:48] doing nothing that you wouldn't want to
[1:04:50] be doing when christ comes that's a
[1:04:52] that's a great metric to go by isn't it
[1:04:55] what am i doing if christ came right now
[1:04:57] what would he think what would he say
[1:04:59] think nothing
[1:05:01] so we've moved from doing now to
[1:05:03] thinking even think nothing you wouldn't
[1:05:05] want to be thinking when christ comes
[1:05:07] keep your one motive
[1:05:09] your heart centered on calvary amen walk
[1:05:12] in the light as he is in the light and
[1:05:14] we have fellowship one with another
[1:05:16] and the blood of jesus christ god's son
[1:05:18] cleanses us from
[1:05:19] all unrighteousness amen the father of
[1:05:23] lights is trying to turn on the lights
[1:05:24] for this age and he sent a prophet to do
[1:05:26] it
[1:05:26] amen that prophet's message is still
[1:05:28] here amen to open the word to us to
[1:05:30] quicken us
[1:05:31] to show us the things that are meant for
[1:05:33] us but brother bram says he's waiting to
[1:05:35] see what you're gonna do with it
[1:05:37] amen but one thing as i pointed out with
[1:05:39] peter once he turns on that light
[1:05:41] it'll never go up that's the beautiful
[1:05:44] thing is once you give
[1:05:45] in once you give him that opportunity
[1:05:47] when you sincerely come to him and say
[1:05:48] lord i'm going to let you turn on my
[1:05:50] light
[1:05:50] he'll turn it on and it'll never go out
[1:05:52] peter never walked back
[1:05:54] peter vacillated a lot amen he walked on
[1:05:56] the water and he sank in the water and
[1:05:57] he was
[1:05:58] out there drawing a sword and chopping
[1:06:00] off ears and proclaiming that he'd never
[1:06:02] leave christ and then denying him
[1:06:03] you know a couple days later but once he
[1:06:05] got his fire
[1:06:06] once he got his fire lit it never went
[1:06:08] out after that aim and it didn't matter
[1:06:10] what they did to him
[1:06:11] didn't matter what they tried to do to
[1:06:12] him what they threatened him with he
[1:06:13] never stopped until he gave his very
[1:06:15] life for christ amen
[1:06:17] and he said i won't even be crucified
[1:06:18] the way he was i'm going to go upside
[1:06:20] down
[1:06:20] that's a man that's confident where he's
[1:06:22] going amen
[1:06:24] to accept a death like that amen he
[1:06:27] never deserted it
[1:06:28] why not why didn't he do it brother
[1:06:31] braham says it this way he says i ask
[1:06:32] the question a christian
[1:06:34] as in what is a christian he says that's
[1:06:36] christ in you
[1:06:38] so it's not just christ like now he says
[1:06:40] a christian is when christ
[1:06:41] is in you and if christ is in you then
[1:06:44] the word is in you
[1:06:45] and then if the word is in you when the
[1:06:47] light is shining
[1:06:48] how are you going to walk out of it see
[1:06:51] that's the question that's what's in now
[1:06:54] the light the evening light's shining
[1:06:56] the bride tree
[1:06:57] is blooming like i said once that fire's
[1:07:00] lit it never goes out
[1:07:01] right once he's done a work he doesn't
[1:07:03] ever pull it back doesn't ever put it
[1:07:05] out he's always going to be there am i
[1:07:06] dim
[1:07:07] at times we'll talk about that a little
[1:07:08] bit later it might get dim at times
[1:07:10] things might be surrounding it a bit
[1:07:12] trying to block it out trying to hide it
[1:07:13] from view
[1:07:14] but the fire will never go out the light
[1:07:15] never goes out amen
[1:07:18] and then we read in the opening
[1:07:19] scripture about how god is light and i
[1:07:21] want to go back to that
[1:07:22] just for this last half of the sermon
[1:07:24] here amen because we want to make it
[1:07:26] we want it this is where we really want
[1:07:28] to get personal with it so this is first
[1:07:30] john 5
[1:07:31] 1 5 it says this then is the message
[1:07:33] that we have heard of him and declare
[1:07:34] unto you
[1:07:35] that god is light and in him is no
[1:07:37] darkness at all
[1:07:38] amen there's no variables variableness
[1:07:41] or shadow of turning
[1:07:42] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:07:44] him and walk in darkness
[1:07:46] we lie and do not the truth doesn't say
[1:07:49] we know not the truth it says we do not
[1:07:51] the truth amen knowing it and not doing
[1:07:53] it it's not going to get you very far is
[1:07:55] it amen so the first effect of the light
[1:07:57] of god in your life is that there won't
[1:07:58] be darkness there
[1:08:01] all right there's total separation from
[1:08:02] darkness why what is darkness
[1:08:05] darkness is not created by itself you
[1:08:07] cannot get a dark light you can get a
[1:08:09] flashlight but you can't get a dark
[1:08:11] light
[1:08:11] darkness is defined by the absence of
[1:08:13] light if light is not there then you
[1:08:15] have darkness but if light is there
[1:08:17] by definition darkness cannot be there
[1:08:19] amen that's what he's saying is look you
[1:08:20] can't say you're in the light and have
[1:08:22] darkness at the same time
[1:08:23] it's like saying i'm sweet and sour at
[1:08:25] the same time it's like saying i have
[1:08:26] salty water and fresh water at the same
[1:08:27] time scripture says that can't happen
[1:08:29] can't get salty water and sweet water
[1:08:31] from the same fountain amen
[1:08:33] and then so spiritually speaking
[1:08:35] darkness is the absence of god
[1:08:37] right because it says god is light so
[1:08:40] spiritually speaking
[1:08:41] if god is in your life there can't be
[1:08:44] darkness there can't be sin there can't
[1:08:45] be unbelief there can't be these
[1:08:46] different things
[1:08:47] and like brother brahm said just a
[1:08:49] second ago he said a believer can't get
[1:08:50] out of the light because the light is in
[1:08:52] them
[1:08:53] right but now what's satan going to try
[1:08:55] and do
[1:08:56] because if he can't put out the light
[1:08:57] then what's he got to try and do
[1:09:00] cover it right he's going to try and put
[1:09:02] up barriers he's going to try and put up
[1:09:03] blockades he's going to try and put up
[1:09:04] walls and roofs and these different
[1:09:06] things
[1:09:06] over that light in your life so that
[1:09:08] that can't be seen
[1:09:09] and then he's got a great access weight
[1:09:11] to it as we've covered before because
[1:09:12] he's got
[1:09:13] a body that is completely unredeemable
[1:09:16] right and he's got a mind and he's got a
[1:09:18] spirit that he can work through
[1:09:19] to try and attack us so what he's trying
[1:09:21] to do is build up blockages in there
[1:09:23] he's trying to put things on us that
[1:09:24] will hold up our testimony
[1:09:26] and then he's trying to put things in
[1:09:27] our way that will keep us from
[1:09:29] expressing the purity
[1:09:30] of the word of god amen but to
[1:09:33] counteract that what happens
[1:09:35] because i want to be careful here
[1:09:36] because you can look at this and you can
[1:09:37] say well brother i've got a bad habit in
[1:09:39] my life does that mean i don't have the
[1:09:40] holy spirit
[1:09:41] no not at all has nothing to do with it
[1:09:44] in fact but
[1:09:45] what happens is as satan is trying to
[1:09:47] walk through and build these things up
[1:09:49] around you the holy spirit is going
[1:09:50] around trying to knock them down
[1:09:52] amen so we have all these different
[1:09:53] doors in our life
[1:09:55] and the holy spirit once you get it
[1:09:57] starts walking around in your life
[1:09:58] and it's got a flashlight and it's
[1:10:00] knocking on the door and then it's going
[1:10:02] in it's shining around saying what do we
[1:10:03] have inside here
[1:10:05] right that's what's happening in there
[1:10:07] and the question is is there a lock on
[1:10:08] the door
[1:10:10] are you on the inside holding it as
[1:10:11] tight as you can because you don't want
[1:10:13] the holy spirit to see what's in there
[1:10:14] or are you going to let it in and say
[1:10:16] absolutely come in here
[1:10:18] and yeah there's some things in here i
[1:10:20] don't want you to see
[1:10:21] but it's better that we get rid of this
[1:10:23] now rather than deal with the effects
[1:10:25] later
[1:10:25] satan's trying to get you to keep the
[1:10:26] door shut the holy spirit say no no
[1:10:28] let's go in here let's shine the light
[1:10:30] let's see what's really going on in this
[1:10:31] portion of your life amen
[1:10:33] that's the battle that's going to be
[1:10:34] happening there so you say i've got a
[1:10:37] bad habit
[1:10:37] yes have you let the holy spirit in
[1:10:39] there and let him have a look let him
[1:10:40] have it
[1:10:41] let him have some time to deal with it
[1:10:43] rather than just buried under
[1:10:44] and say i have no sin as the scripture
[1:10:46] says right i don't have any problems i
[1:10:48] don't have any issues
[1:10:50] right that's a hypocrite
[1:10:53] right it's not a hypocrite to say lord i
[1:10:55] have faults and failures it's a
[1:10:56] hypocrite to say i don't
[1:11:00] but paul says look if you're stuck in
[1:11:02] unbelief if your life doesn't reflect
[1:11:04] the life of christ
[1:11:05] you don't have the holy ghost it's
[1:11:06] literally that simple he says look you
[1:11:08] can't have light and darkness at the
[1:11:09] same time
[1:11:10] and if when i look at your life i see
[1:11:11] darkness not light then there's a
[1:11:13] problem
[1:11:14] right you can't say you have the holy
[1:11:15] ghost here you don't have the life and
[1:11:17] the light of god in you yet
[1:11:19] there's got to be a separation of that
[1:11:20] darkness in that light and it only comes
[1:11:23] by the light
[1:11:23] how do you separate it right god in the
[1:11:25] beginning separated the light from the
[1:11:27] darkness and that's again what god is
[1:11:29] doing
[1:11:29] he says that's what he did in the
[1:11:30] beginning and that's what he's doing now
[1:11:32] god separates light from dark in the
[1:11:34] beginning he said let there be light
[1:11:36] now remember there can be no light
[1:11:38] outside of the word of god
[1:11:40] the very sun out there is the word of
[1:11:42] god vindicated
[1:11:43] there was gross darkness upon the earth
[1:11:45] fog and mist upon the earth and god said
[1:11:46] let there be light
[1:11:48] now what if no light came then it
[1:11:50] wouldn't do them no good to speak
[1:11:51] but when he said let there be light and
[1:11:53] light came into existence
[1:11:55] vindicating that his word was right that
[1:11:57] light we live by today now he's speaking
[1:11:59] of the natural sun here because we live
[1:12:00] by
[1:12:00] the natural sunlight on the earth right
[1:12:03] all botany life is it
[1:12:04] well almost all of it requires light
[1:12:08] sun goes out we have what eight eleven
[1:12:10] minutes before we die
[1:12:12] i think is the way it works it takes
[1:12:14] that long for the light and the heat to
[1:12:15] get here
[1:12:16] then you lose the residual heat of the
[1:12:17] earth and then we all just become big
[1:12:19] popsicles
[1:12:20] so we live by the light of the sun but
[1:12:22] now he makes the transition he says and
[1:12:24] the only light we can have today
[1:12:27] in the church is god vindicating his
[1:12:30] light in this generation
[1:12:31] amen it's not just words he says it's
[1:12:34] vindicating so there's a reality that
[1:12:35] has to come
[1:12:36] god at the beginning separated the light
[1:12:38] from the darkness he has
[1:12:39] always done that what does he do he
[1:12:42] presses that
[1:12:43] by the coming light he presses the
[1:12:45] darkness to the other side of the earth
[1:12:47] if you've ever seen a satellite video of
[1:12:49] the earth as the sun is rotating around
[1:12:51] the
[1:12:51] as the earth is rotating around the sun
[1:12:53] you'll see what happens is as the earth
[1:12:55] rotates
[1:12:56] that light pushes the darkness further
[1:12:57] and further and further and it just goes
[1:12:59] around around the world why because the
[1:13:00] light
[1:13:01] as earth turns that light is chasing
[1:13:03] darkness all the way around
[1:13:04] he says it's the same thing the light of
[1:13:06] the word is in there and it's going to
[1:13:07] chase darkness all the way
[1:13:09] all in and out of your life and there's
[1:13:11] going to be a chasing going on
[1:13:12] why to push it out because the light's
[1:13:14] got to have preeminence and then the
[1:13:16] light's got to dominate in your life he
[1:13:18] says and that's exactly what's coming to
[1:13:20] pass now
[1:13:21] it's just before day the morning star
[1:13:23] has come out to hail the day coming
[1:13:25] and the holy spirit is showing its light
[1:13:27] it's coming at a time
[1:13:29] when the dark light and darkness will
[1:13:30] have to be separated one from the other
[1:13:32] now listen to this he says the church
[1:13:34] and its order will take the order of the
[1:13:36] day
[1:13:37] and christ and his light word promise
[1:13:41] will go in the rapture that's the total
[1:13:44] separation of light and darkness right
[1:13:46] he's saying listen
[1:13:47] you've been on the earth long enough
[1:13:48] bride of mine now it's time for the
[1:13:50] light to come up here because total
[1:13:51] darkness now is going to come down on
[1:13:52] the earth
[1:13:53] right that's the only thing that's left
[1:13:57] for them to do
[1:13:58] it's a day today is the dawn
[1:14:01] of a new day for many who are looking
[1:14:04] for his coming so he says there's got to
[1:14:07] be a separation of light and darkness
[1:14:08] but what we see today is people that are
[1:14:10] trying to blend
[1:14:11] light and darkness right when you look
[1:14:13] at a denominational christian
[1:14:14] then what are they trying to do they're
[1:14:15] trying to take part of the word and part
[1:14:17] of the world
[1:14:18] and they're trying to put it together
[1:14:19] and make it work and it can't work that
[1:14:21] way amen
[1:14:22] you can't have both those things
[1:14:23] simultaneously and it produces a true
[1:14:25] light
[1:14:26] something's got to give something's got
[1:14:28] to something's got to give way to the
[1:14:30] other amen
[1:14:31] you can't have a little bit of god in
[1:14:34] your life
[1:14:34] it's got to be all god amen it's a it's
[1:14:37] a life or death
[1:14:38] situation it's an all or nothing amen
[1:14:42] said this in first corinthians he says
[1:14:43] know ye not that a little leaven
[1:14:45] leaveneth the whole lump now we're not
[1:14:47] all bread makers here
[1:14:48] but my wife is a bread maker and when
[1:14:50] you put leaven in
[1:14:51] right if you put yeast in you don't have
[1:14:52] to put very much in do you
[1:14:54] you put in just a little bit and then it
[1:14:56] spreads through the whole thing because
[1:14:57] yeast are
[1:14:58] crazy little boogers and they just grow
[1:15:00] and grow and grow and they spread out
[1:15:01] throughout that whole thing don't they
[1:15:02] a little bit of leaven a little bit of
[1:15:04] yeast goes a long ways
[1:15:07] right he says once you get it in there
[1:15:09] the whole thing's tainted
[1:15:11] or if you want it it's a good thing
[1:15:12] right obviously for for bread but you
[1:15:14] can put in a little and then say well
[1:15:16] it's just a little now
[1:15:17] no he says it grows it magnifies itself
[1:15:19] and it ruins the whole thing
[1:15:20] or it fills out the whole thing purge
[1:15:22] out therefore the old
[1:15:24] leaven that ye may be a lu a new lump
[1:15:27] as ye are unleavened for even christ our
[1:15:30] passover is sacrificed for us
[1:15:32] well we might think well they have some
[1:15:34] of the words so isn't that light in
[1:15:35] their life
[1:15:36] right they accepted a little bit here
[1:15:37] and they accept a little bit there isn't
[1:15:39] that light
[1:15:40] it's not what the scripture says it's
[1:15:41] not what the prophet taught us amen to
[1:15:43] reject
[1:15:43] the light of god is to accept the
[1:15:45] blindfold of satan and all you're doing
[1:15:47] is you're saying they've got a couple
[1:15:48] pinpricks through there that let light
[1:15:50] through
[1:15:50] and somehow that means that they've got
[1:15:52] sight they don't
[1:15:53] they've got enough to just blind them
[1:15:55] amen that's the only thing they've got
[1:15:57] there amen they become immune to the
[1:15:58] word of god
[1:15:59] but the brahm said any man who rejects
[1:16:01] the light receives the same thing that
[1:16:03] they did
[1:16:04] become midnight blackness to them the
[1:16:07] same light that was made a light for the
[1:16:09] children of israel to walk by blinded
[1:16:11] the eyes of pharaoh and his army
[1:16:12] and the same holy ghost gospel that you
[1:16:14] call nonsense
[1:16:16] that'll carry the church to glory but it
[1:16:18] darkens the eyes of the modern
[1:16:20] theologian
[1:16:21] tonight amen blinds them
[1:16:24] to what god is doing the same holy ghost
[1:16:28] in power that resurrected jesus christ
[1:16:31] that's in this building tonight blinds
[1:16:33] the eyes of the modern day preacher and
[1:16:35] his church
[1:16:36] we've been reading brother branham's
[1:16:37] life story for years now i feel like
[1:16:39] and it's amazing how many people would
[1:16:41] come into those meetings
[1:16:43] and they'd say that's not god and they'd
[1:16:44] see person after person walk away healed
[1:16:46] healed healed healed they'd see the
[1:16:48] discernment of the thoughts and intents
[1:16:49] of the heart
[1:16:50] and him i mean you didn't even have to
[1:16:52] stand by him he'd turn his back and do
[1:16:53] all these things
[1:16:54] and discern it and they'd look at it and
[1:16:56] they'd say that is not
[1:16:58] god it's like what are you doing
[1:17:01] like literally it's like jesus said look
[1:17:03] if you can't believe my words believe my
[1:17:04] works
[1:17:05] what are you doing look at what i'm
[1:17:06] doing you say you've got everything and
[1:17:08] you can't do anything
[1:17:09] and you're saying i have nothing and yet
[1:17:11] i'm doing everything there's a problem
[1:17:13] here there's a paradox in your argument
[1:17:15] right
[1:17:16] and he says here the same holy ghost
[1:17:17] said resurrected jesus christ that's in
[1:17:19] this building tonight
[1:17:20] blinds the eyes of the modern day
[1:17:22] preacher and his church
[1:17:23] and that's the thing that's blinded them
[1:17:25] has given light since the resurrection
[1:17:27] of jesus in the day of pentecost
[1:17:29] god will do it can you explain it no
[1:17:32] i can't explain it i can't explain the
[1:17:34] way god does things
[1:17:36] i mean i can't even explain the gift
[1:17:37] that's inside of me why do i i couldn't
[1:17:39] even try and fathom
[1:17:40] some of the things god does amen the the
[1:17:43] perfection and the sovereignty of god to
[1:17:45] move in our lives and to change things
[1:17:47] to set things up it boggles me it blows
[1:17:50] my mind how god can do things
[1:17:52] amen and when i see a ministry like
[1:17:53] william branham's and somebody comes
[1:17:54] behind that says that he's off the word
[1:17:56] listen something's wrong there
[1:17:59] something's wrong
[1:18:00] something's wrong
[1:18:04] god will do it can you explain it but if
[1:18:06] you don't accept light
[1:18:07] it'll become darkness to you and i think
[1:18:09] it's because we're trying to explain it
[1:18:10] sometimes that we
[1:18:11] turn it away we can't explain it and so
[1:18:14] we say that's not for me
[1:18:17] it'll become darkness to you you'll
[1:18:18] criticize it that's what's happened
[1:18:20] isn't it
[1:18:21] they couldn't explain it so they'll
[1:18:23] criticize it they'll call it holy roller
[1:18:25] and you might as well have a millstone
[1:18:26] hanged at your neck and drowned in the
[1:18:28] depths of the sea
[1:18:29] he says you blasphemed the holy ghost
[1:18:32] and there's no forgiveness
[1:18:34] god help us god help each one we've seen
[1:18:36] what's happened you know in this day
[1:18:37] with believe the sign and these
[1:18:38] different ones
[1:18:39] there's a minister sat at my table in
[1:18:40] edmonton and i see now he's putting
[1:18:42] videos on youtube about why he's left
[1:18:44] the message this is a very well-known
[1:18:45] man
[1:18:45] his grandmother was i believe healed
[1:18:47] miraculously in brother branham's
[1:18:49] services him and his father have been
[1:18:51] ministers for decades after decades
[1:18:53] since brother brahm left
[1:18:54] and he's just walked away he blasphemed
[1:18:57] the holy ghost
[1:18:58] amen it's a scary thing to do brother
[1:19:01] braham says there
[1:19:01] is no forgiveness look
[1:19:05] every man that rejects light goes blind
[1:19:07] and walks in darkness because you don't
[1:19:09] accept the light
[1:19:10] amen god sends ministers that preach the
[1:19:12] gospel
[1:19:13] he sends signs and wonders among men to
[1:19:15] vindicate it to be the truth and men
[1:19:16] reject it
[1:19:17] there's nothing left but darkness for
[1:19:19] you he says walk in the light while the
[1:19:21] light is shining my brother
[1:19:22] receive the light christ is the light
[1:19:24] he's come to bring light to you
[1:19:27] it's not just to shine it but it's to
[1:19:28] bring it to you so that you can be the
[1:19:30] same thing
[1:19:31] but those who rejected light receive
[1:19:33] darkness and every man
[1:19:34] and woman tonight who rejects light
[1:19:36] walks in darkness
[1:19:37] not knowing where he's going he's
[1:19:39] staggering along pretty good
[1:19:41] popular with the people but i wonder how
[1:19:44] he stands in the presence of god
[1:19:46] right rich and increased with goods and
[1:19:49] think you have need of nothing he says
[1:19:50] you're poor
[1:19:50] miserable blind wretched naked and know
[1:19:52] it not that's what they're doing they're
[1:19:54] saying we've got it we've got it we've
[1:19:55] got it
[1:19:56] and he's saying you don't have anything
[1:19:58] but you think you do
[1:20:00] right you think you do i mean like i
[1:20:02] said the gospel of jesus is an all or
[1:20:04] nothing
[1:20:04] proposition you can't walk half in and
[1:20:07] half out can't step
[1:20:08] in step out step in step out amen
[1:20:12] as we've read in the scriptures you have
[1:20:13] to choose life right choose life
[1:20:16] that you might live stay in it amen we
[1:20:18] have to go all the way and stay in it
[1:20:19] and eat it and drink it and feed on it
[1:20:21] and speak it and live it
[1:20:23] and then until what it becomes a daily
[1:20:25] reality in every single one of our lives
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:28] once god has opened the word to you once
[1:20:31] he's revealed his requirement to you
[1:20:33] this is what this message did
[1:20:35] right it showed god's requirement
[1:20:38] show god what and and then from that
[1:20:40] point what does god do
[1:20:41] he holds us responsible for it once he
[1:20:43] has said it
[1:20:44] we're held responsible for it and it's
[1:20:47] that simple
[1:20:48] he lays it in your lap that's what
[1:20:49] brother gerald has said so many times he
[1:20:50] says i'm going to lay it in the people's
[1:20:51] lap
[1:20:52] so brother braham said i'll lay it in
[1:20:53] their lap and it's up to you what you do
[1:20:55] with it
[1:20:55] but now i'm not responsible i've given
[1:20:57] it to you now it's your responsibility
[1:20:59] for what you do to it amen
[1:21:00] and if you obey it it's life and it's
[1:21:03] light
[1:21:04] right and if you disobey what is it it's
[1:21:07] death
[1:21:08] if you're a believer it's not death it's
[1:21:11] pain
[1:21:12] or it's death in this sense and let me
[1:21:14] put it this way it's separation from god
[1:21:16] and you know what happens is you go into
[1:21:17] your prayer closet
[1:21:19] and you've got a steel roof
[1:21:22] right and your prayers are going up and
[1:21:23] they're bouncing off
[1:21:25] and god doesn't hear it right you're
[1:21:27] separated from the fellowship of god and
[1:21:29] we're not going to touch on fellowship
[1:21:30] tonight this is going to be at least a
[1:21:31] two-part series
[1:21:32] okay we're not going to go in there
[1:21:33] tonight but what happens is you're
[1:21:35] separated from god in that you lose the
[1:21:37] fellowship
[1:21:37] don't lose your soul right your eternal
[1:21:40] destination has not changed but you lose
[1:21:41] the fellowship because you're not
[1:21:43] walking the light you're not obeying
[1:21:44] what he's told you to do
[1:21:46] right and so your prayers are hitting
[1:21:47] the ceiling they're bouncing right back
[1:21:48] to you
[1:21:49] and you're sitting there saying what's
[1:21:50] wrong what's wrong what's wrong and he's
[1:21:51] saying look i told you what to do just
[1:21:52] do it
[1:21:53] all right amen we tend to think of
[1:21:57] darkness as
[1:21:58] you know oh i'm doing something i
[1:21:59] shouldn't do or this you know i i'm
[1:22:01] around people i shouldn't or i've got
[1:22:02] this habit or i've got this situation
[1:22:04] but
[1:22:04] that's not always what darkness is
[1:22:06] sometimes it's when god says come here
[1:22:09] do this or do that and we don't do it
[1:22:11] then we're going into darkness because
[1:22:12] we're disobeying what he's asked us to
[1:22:14] do right
[1:22:15] it's not all bad we don't want to look
[1:22:17] at this as a you know as the light has
[1:22:18] always been a thing that's bad because
[1:22:20] oh it's showing me all the
[1:22:21] negative side of me and the things that
[1:22:22] he needs to work on and that's not all
[1:22:24] it
[1:22:24] at all i mean god's trying to lead us
[1:22:26] he's trying to guide us he's trying to
[1:22:27] bring us through this life and he's
[1:22:29] saying walk with me
[1:22:30] and there's going to be some tough
[1:22:31] things that i'm going to bring out here
[1:22:32] but there's going to be some amazing
[1:22:34] things that i'm going to bring out as
[1:22:35] well because light doesn't just show the
[1:22:36] bad it shows the good it shows the word
[1:22:38] of god it shows you your position in the
[1:22:40] word of god
[1:22:40] and so if you can listen to both if you
[1:22:42] can handle both of those sides then
[1:22:44] you're going to do pretty well
[1:22:45] amen if you can take not the criticism
[1:22:47] because he's not criticizing us for
[1:22:49] being
[1:22:49] weak for being you know for having
[1:22:51] sinner elements or for having an
[1:22:53] unredeemable body in these different
[1:22:54] things
[1:22:55] what he holds us accountable for is when
[1:22:56] we won't do anything about it when we
[1:22:58] won't give him
[1:22:58] access to do something about it he's not
[1:23:01] mad at us because we're
[1:23:02] we're in sinful flesh he gets angry when
[1:23:04] we don't allow him to do something about
[1:23:06] it amen
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:14] this is jesus he says remember the words
[1:23:17] that i said unto you
[1:23:18] the servant is not greater than his lord
[1:23:19] if they have persecuted me
[1:23:21] they also they will also persecute you
[1:23:24] if they have kept my saying they will
[1:23:26] keep yours also
[1:23:28] but all these things will they do unto
[1:23:29] you for my name's sake because they know
[1:23:31] not him that sent me
[1:23:33] now listen to this he says if i had not
[1:23:35] come and spoke unto them
[1:23:37] they had not sinned but now they have
[1:23:40] no cloak for their sin he's the light
[1:23:44] he didn't come to judge jesus said i
[1:23:46] came to save
[1:23:48] he came to say but if you turned him
[1:23:50] down it turned into judgment
[1:23:52] and what he's speaking of is he's
[1:23:53] speaking of the sadducees and the
[1:23:54] pharisees men in general but especially
[1:23:55] those priests
[1:23:56] he says look they were fine until i came
[1:23:59] and exposed them for what they were
[1:24:01] and they didn't change and now they have
[1:24:02] no cloak for their skin it's for their
[1:24:04] sin
[1:24:04] there's nothing now to hide them from
[1:24:06] the eyes of the people the people can
[1:24:08] see what they really were and they're
[1:24:09] going to keep seeing what they are
[1:24:11] because i've hidden them and now there's
[1:24:12] no ignorance right god winked at
[1:24:14] ignorance but now the lights come
[1:24:16] it showed you what you are it showed you
[1:24:17] where the weaknesses are it showed you
[1:24:19] where the problems are
[1:24:20] and now it's up to you if you're going
[1:24:21] to handle it or not and they couldn't
[1:24:23] handle it
[1:24:23] amen and they put them to death but he
[1:24:26] says until that point
[1:24:27] they'd have gotten away with it and they
[1:24:28] did get away with it right because they
[1:24:30] were under the law and as long as they
[1:24:31] kept doing the law then they were okay
[1:24:33] as long as they kept sacrificing that
[1:24:34] lamb and these different things they
[1:24:35] were okay
[1:24:36] but when the lamb of god comes and shows
[1:24:38] them that the light of god is moving on
[1:24:40] and they reject it they're out all right
[1:24:43] he says and now you've got no covering
[1:24:44] you can't put a jacket on now you can't
[1:24:46] put your clothes on and hide the fact
[1:24:47] that you're a sinner
[1:24:48] i've completely exposed you for who and
[1:24:50] what you are and until you come to this
[1:24:52] light you'll continue to be that way
[1:24:53] you'll be you'll be open for everyone to
[1:24:55] see it's the emperor has no clothes all
[1:24:56] over again right
[1:24:58] right brother braham says this
[1:25:01] he says i was preaching one time in a
[1:25:02] methodist church and i said
[1:25:04] smoking cigarettes is not a sin
[1:25:06] committing adultery is not a sin
[1:25:08] taking the lord's name is not sin it was
[1:25:11] too much for one sister she raised up
[1:25:13] and said pray tell me reverend branham
[1:25:15] what is sin i said unbelief
[1:25:18] you do those things because you do not
[1:25:20] believe
[1:25:21] that's exactly now listen to this he
[1:25:23] says the reason
[1:25:25] you refuse to walk in the light of the
[1:25:27] word is because you disbelieve the word
[1:25:30] he says and that makes you an unbeliever
[1:25:34] amen now this sounds all very dark
[1:25:37] very sobering but like i said it's not
[1:25:39] all dark and sobering when we're talking
[1:25:41] about the light
[1:25:42] a lot of it can be judgment but guess
[1:25:44] what he's not here to judge a bride
[1:25:46] this is our time of judgment it's true
[1:25:49] right this is when the bride is tried
[1:25:50] and tested and it's proven what's in her
[1:25:53] right but now it moves on because we're
[1:25:54] going to judge the saints
[1:25:56] right and that's only because we're here
[1:25:58] as light shining for him
[1:26:00] we are the witness that judges the
[1:26:02] people of our age
[1:26:03] amen and guess what i'm not going to
[1:26:05] judge the people that were in the 1600s
[1:26:07] that wasn't my age i'm going to judge
[1:26:09] the people in the 2000s and
[1:26:11] you know and and these different things
[1:26:12] why because that's my age that's when i
[1:26:14] was my witness
[1:26:15] right there's got to be a reality of god
[1:26:17] in me and it's going to be because i
[1:26:18] believe that word and i've accepted it
[1:26:20] and it's going to because i let that
[1:26:22] light have a complete work inside of me
[1:26:24] i've let god's word into every part
[1:26:26] of my life amen hey we're children of
[1:26:28] lights
[1:26:29] we're children of light and we come from
[1:26:30] a father of lights that's a good thing
[1:26:32] right we're not children of darkness
[1:26:34] we're not children of sin we're not
[1:26:36] we're not a child of hell so this light
[1:26:38] is going to be a good thing in our life
[1:26:39] but it's not always going to feel good
[1:26:41] is it
[1:26:42] if you're a christian and you've been
[1:26:43] filled with the holy ghost you know this
[1:26:44] is not an easy walk
[1:26:46] this is not a difficult this is a
[1:26:48] difficult walk in that it's going to
[1:26:49] test
[1:26:50] and it's going to try your courage it's
[1:26:52] going to test your patience
[1:26:54] in ways that you have never it's going
[1:26:55] to test your love
[1:26:57] right all in ways that you never
[1:26:59] expected that it was going to
[1:27:01] why that's the difficulty of the light
[1:27:03] is as it's going to bring out the
[1:27:04] darkness
[1:27:05] but it's going to drive it out amen it's
[1:27:06] going to press it out of your life and
[1:27:08] what's left is going to be a good thing
[1:27:10] ephesians 5 tells us all about it says
[1:27:12] but ye were sometimes darkness
[1:27:16] we were right but now
[1:27:19] ye are light in the lord then he says
[1:27:22] walk
[1:27:23] as children of light for the fruit of
[1:27:25] the spirit is in
[1:27:26] all goodness and righteousness and truth
[1:27:29] proving
[1:27:30] what is acceptable unto the lord so look
[1:27:32] at this if god is dropping things into
[1:27:34] your life
[1:27:35] and you're responding to them the right
[1:27:37] way and you are quick to hear and obey
[1:27:39] it has a beautiful effect on you and
[1:27:42] paul says here he says the fruit of the
[1:27:43] spirit is what
[1:27:44] all goodness all righteousness all truth
[1:27:47] where
[1:27:48] in your life in your job in your
[1:27:50] marriage in your home
[1:27:51] in your relationships in your church in
[1:27:53] your ministries
[1:27:54] all of this is what the light is doing
[1:27:56] in your life because it's pushing out
[1:27:58] darkness
[1:27:58] and it's bringing the fruit of the
[1:28:00] spirit out and replacing the things that
[1:28:01] were so jumbled up and so messed up
[1:28:03] before amen
[1:28:04] right because god proves his word by
[1:28:06] bringing it to pass and if you'll let
[1:28:08] the word come in then the word is going
[1:28:09] to bring forth what it said it was going
[1:28:11] to do
[1:28:11] and then it's not coming to judge you
[1:28:13] it's coming to cleanse you and then
[1:28:15] we're cleansed by the washing of water
[1:28:16] by the word so it's going to have a good
[1:28:18] effect
[1:28:19] it's just that not all washing feels so
[1:28:22] good
[1:28:22] who's that comedian i heard this very
[1:28:25] briefly the other day on the radio
[1:28:26] remember there was that
[1:28:27] christian community talked about that
[1:28:29] that homeless man was or something that
[1:28:30] was a bit different
[1:28:32] and and god was working on him he used
[1:28:34] this man to really develop this man's
[1:28:36] character
[1:28:36] he was all dirty and everything he had
[1:28:38] the guy and and you know he did little
[1:28:40] bits with them he had him over for
[1:28:41] supper
[1:28:42] and these different things and whatnot
[1:28:43] and then god said take him to disneyland
[1:28:44] with his family
[1:28:46] and so he did i think his name was
[1:28:47] norman anyways
[1:28:49] he talks about one day he said norman
[1:28:53] how about we give you a bath and he said
[1:28:57] you know we got norman in the bath you
[1:29:00] know and he said we started to
[1:29:01] put the water on and you know we poured
[1:29:04] the water on it got very dirty we let it
[1:29:05] out we put another one in more and more
[1:29:07] he says and then i put some shampoo in
[1:29:08] his hair
[1:29:09] i started to rub around and normally
[1:29:13] he says and pretty soon i realized that
[1:29:15] his hair was not brown
[1:29:16] it was white it had just never been
[1:29:18] washed you know in such a long long time
[1:29:20] what norman wasn't too sure about the
[1:29:23] bath but once norman got into the bath
[1:29:25] and started seeing the effect of the
[1:29:26] bath
[1:29:27] pretty soon norman was okay with the
[1:29:29] bath right
[1:29:31] why he just needed somebody to sit there
[1:29:33] and give him a little bit of time
[1:29:35] develop a bit of trust with him and then
[1:29:37] get him to the place where he could
[1:29:38] clean up his life a little bit
[1:29:39] you know this man wasn't all there right
[1:29:41] he was a little bit simple in these
[1:29:42] different things
[1:29:43] but he says pretty soon i saw and then
[1:29:46] the white hair started to come up you
[1:29:47] know
[1:29:48] and all of a sudden norman gets out he
[1:29:49] doesn't recognize himself in the mirror
[1:29:51] because he looks so different what is it
[1:29:53] the washing of water
[1:29:55] right and it's no different for us you
[1:29:56] know we're pretty stinky
[1:29:58] we're pretty dirty in some places in our
[1:30:00] life and just because we've come to
[1:30:01] christ and accepted him
[1:30:02] does not mean that we're clean as in
[1:30:04] literally clean the blood of jesus is
[1:30:06] what covers us
[1:30:07] but there's a cleansing of the washing
[1:30:09] of water and that's the thing that we've
[1:30:10] got to submit to
[1:30:11] and sometimes it's not always a gentle
[1:30:13] rubbing on your scalp is it
[1:30:14] sometimes you got to take the pressure
[1:30:16] washer out because you got stuff that's
[1:30:18] gummed up and so hard and crusty in your
[1:30:20] life
[1:30:20] that he's really got to get at it amen
[1:30:22] right he's got a chip at it and he's
[1:30:24] really got a knock at it
[1:30:25] and we've got to be able to sit there
[1:30:26] and take that but the ideal situation is
[1:30:29] the guy going hmm while you rub
[1:30:30] your scalp right let it in easy don't
[1:30:33] let it get to the point where he's got
[1:30:34] to get in there and start knocking it
[1:30:35] off
[1:30:36] amen what it's showing you who you are
[1:30:40] norman didn't realize what he was until
[1:30:41] that guy really started showing him
[1:30:43] hey you're actually a normal person you
[1:30:45] know you've got real qualities inside of
[1:30:47] you you can be clean
[1:30:48] these different things and the light of
[1:30:49] the word is doing the exact same thing
[1:30:50] in our lives a minute showing us
[1:30:52] who you are showing you what you're made
[1:30:54] for showing you what your purpose is
[1:30:56] amen the light of the word today is
[1:30:58] calling us to be overcomers so it's
[1:30:59] going to show us
[1:31:00] in an overcoming light that's what we're
[1:31:02] going to be walking in day in and day
[1:31:04] out day in and day out
[1:31:05] and it's going to be what putting every
[1:31:07] satanic pressure and influence under our
[1:31:09] feet
[1:31:09] because it can't stand in the light of
[1:31:11] the word it's going to be pushing the
[1:31:12] darkness out
[1:31:13] and all that's going to be left is the
[1:31:14] light of the word and that's going to
[1:31:15] give you the faith that you need to get
[1:31:16] out of here amen
[1:31:19] first john 5 verse 4 says for whatsoever
[1:31:22] is born of god
[1:31:24] overcometh the world and this is the
[1:31:26] victory that overcometh the world
[1:31:28] even our faith brother braham said this
[1:31:30] no matter how little
[1:31:32] if you're a little wash woman that could
[1:31:34] be all of our sisters staying home
[1:31:36] washing our clothes and cleaning up the
[1:31:38] house and these different things okay
[1:31:39] put yourself in there
[1:31:41] or if you're just a brother that doesn't
[1:31:42] know his abcs
[1:31:44] don't make any difference who you are
[1:31:46] you are in christ
[1:31:48] triumphed over all things and your
[1:31:51] authority
[1:31:51] is over every demon and every power
[1:31:55] that the devil has you're in christ
[1:31:58] triumph and then how are you going to
[1:32:00] realize that unless you're walking with
[1:32:01] him every day
[1:32:03] amen because if you start standing and
[1:32:04] looking around then you start to
[1:32:07] get a little worried right but if you
[1:32:08] keep walking if you keep putting one
[1:32:09] foot in front of the other
[1:32:10] you don't have too much time to take in
[1:32:12] your surroundings because you're too
[1:32:13] busy staying with him
[1:32:14] and looking at what he's showing you and
[1:32:16] looking what he's showing you and then
[1:32:17] when he's showing you those things and
[1:32:18] something steps in front of you
[1:32:20] and then you remember in in pilgrim's
[1:32:23] progress
[1:32:24] right and christian's going there and
[1:32:25] there's the two lions standing
[1:32:27] there and they're they're trying to get
[1:32:28] at him and they're blocking the path
[1:32:31] and he's scared to go past until he
[1:32:33] recognizes that if he just stays right
[1:32:35] in the middle
[1:32:36] then he'll be fine and he walks through
[1:32:38] and the claws of the lines are just
[1:32:39] inches away from him
[1:32:40] but he's in the path and when the light
[1:32:42] is there to show him that there's a
[1:32:44] pathway through
[1:32:44] he keeps walking and those lines can't
[1:32:46] touch him amen it's the same thing here
[1:32:48] when you're walking in the word
[1:32:50] when you're walking with god daily when
[1:32:51] your prayer life is good when you're
[1:32:53] reading the word
[1:32:54] when you're listening to the messages
[1:32:55] when you're dwelling on the good things
[1:32:56] of god
[1:32:57] then what happens is it starts to show
[1:32:59] you a light through everything that
[1:33:00] you're going through
[1:33:01] and starts to show you that satan has no
[1:33:03] no hold on you right he can't touch you
[1:33:05] he can't block you he can't hold you
[1:33:06] back he can't trip you up it's going to
[1:33:08] keep exposing him time in and time out
[1:33:10] and it's going to start exposing you in
[1:33:11] a good way showing you that god is with
[1:33:13] you
[1:33:14] god is in you god's got your back and
[1:33:16] god's going to carry you through amen
[1:33:18] amen it's a walk it's not a christian
[1:33:20] stand still it's a christian walk
[1:33:22] and we've got to keep moving we've got
[1:33:23] to keep pressing the battle amen
[1:33:25] our lives are continuously being
[1:33:26] sanctified you know
[1:33:28] if there's one thing i've recognized you
[1:33:29] know i'm 41 years old
[1:33:31] and there's still sanctification going
[1:33:33] on because as god presses
[1:33:35] in other things have to give way because
[1:33:37] i only have so much time in my life
[1:33:39] i only have so much capacity to handle
[1:33:40] things in my life and so if i've got
[1:33:43] anything in there and god needs my time
[1:33:45] god needs my energy god needs my
[1:33:47] strength god needs my focus
[1:33:48] something else has to suffer so he's got
[1:33:51] to take something out
[1:33:52] and it's not that what i had was wrong
[1:33:54] it's that it's just taking up place that
[1:33:56] god needs in my life
[1:33:57] and so that's what sanctification is is
[1:33:59] it's not always taking out the bad
[1:34:00] things
[1:34:01] that's what initially it is right he's
[1:34:02] taking out the bad habits the bad
[1:34:04] friendships and
[1:34:05] these different things but then it moves
[1:34:06] into taking out the things that are
[1:34:08] holding back
[1:34:08] him having a greater effect in your life
[1:34:11] and that's where i see
[1:34:12] he's working more on me these days is
[1:34:14] because by now i should be pretty done
[1:34:16] with the bad stuff
[1:34:17] you know i would think but he's got lots
[1:34:20] to do to start chipping away those
[1:34:22] little things that are taking up the
[1:34:23] time
[1:34:23] sucking the time out of my life sucking
[1:34:25] the energy out of my life
[1:34:27] bringing a focus that is on things that
[1:34:28] are not of god amen
[1:34:31] amen we're not going to be ready for the
[1:34:32] rapture if we stand on our laurels and
[1:34:34] say i've repented
[1:34:34] i've been baptized and i've got the holy
[1:34:36] ghost and then we stand around waiting
[1:34:37] for christ to come take us home
[1:34:39] that's not the bride he's called for
[1:34:40] amen but the brahman said this
[1:34:43] israel had to keep journeying they were
[1:34:45] called out
[1:34:46] but he says they had to keep journeying
[1:34:47] when they stopped they backslid
[1:34:50] they had to keep moving every night they
[1:34:52] built a new fire every night
[1:34:54] just kept moving on and that's what
[1:34:56] we've got to do what luther had was fine
[1:34:59] that was for luther's
[1:35:00] day what wesley had was fine that was
[1:35:02] wesley's day what the holiness had that
[1:35:04] was fine that was their day
[1:35:05] we're living in another day and now
[1:35:08] we're moving on and there will be a day
[1:35:10] after us
[1:35:11] it'll come just the same but let's walk
[1:35:14] in the light
[1:35:14] while the light is here
[1:35:18] amen we're called to be a witness we're
[1:35:20] called to be a light to a wicked an
[1:35:21] adulterous nation
[1:35:23] and it's only going to happen if we're
[1:35:24] walking with him and day in and day out
[1:35:26] and then we're going to close with this
[1:35:28] brother bram says this he says
[1:35:30] the hour is here i listen when he says
[1:35:34] the hour is here
[1:35:35] because if the hour was here in 1964
[1:35:39] the hour is done in 2021.
[1:35:43] we are so close amen the hour is here if
[1:35:45] i could have been back there before the
[1:35:47] days that the world was created and
[1:35:49] looked down and seen the whole thing and
[1:35:50] the father said to me
[1:35:51] what day would you want to live i would
[1:35:53] say now right now
[1:35:54] this is the hour this is the greatest
[1:35:57] hour that the church has ever moved into
[1:35:59] just before the coming of the bridegroom
[1:36:02] oh the real church of the living god
[1:36:04] ought to be on fire
[1:36:05] burning with the light of the gospel
[1:36:07] being vindicated among them
[1:36:09] not just spoken over them we rejoice in
[1:36:12] the speaking of the word but he says no
[1:36:13] no no
[1:36:14] what you want is you are going to be on
[1:36:16] fire with the light of the gospel being
[1:36:18] vindicated among you in your life
[1:36:22] not just my life in all of our lives
[1:36:24] amen being vindicated why
[1:36:26] or how with god expressing his word day
[1:36:29] in
[1:36:29] and day out in your life amen giving you
[1:36:33] victory
[1:36:34] giving you strength giving you courage
[1:36:36] giving you the right motive and
[1:36:37] objective giving you love joy peace
[1:36:39] patience all the fruits of the spirit
[1:36:41] and signs and wonders following amen
[1:36:44] we want god's power moving in our midst
[1:36:47] in our lives amen
[1:36:48] when we lay hands on somebody when we
[1:36:50] pray for situations our expectation is
[1:36:53] god
[1:36:53] is going to move because it's a finished
[1:36:57] work if his word has said that he does
[1:36:59] it
[1:36:59] then we believe that it is a finished
[1:37:01] work and all we're doing is waiting for
[1:37:02] him to choose his time amen
[1:37:04] we want every single aspect of it amen i
[1:37:07] don't want to sit up here
[1:37:08] and and preach wonderful doctrine and
[1:37:10] beautiful sermons if we can even get me
[1:37:12] to that place
[1:37:13] but i want the power and demonstration
[1:37:15] of the holy ghost in
[1:37:16] the word that's going over this pulpit
[1:37:19] discerning the thoughts and intents of
[1:37:20] the heart
[1:37:21] healing the sick amen bringing out satan
[1:37:24] kicking him out of the people in this
[1:37:25] church him and we want that in every one
[1:37:27] of our lives as
[1:37:28] as priests of the house for our us us as
[1:37:30] husbands and fathers
[1:37:32] we should be able to do that in our very
[1:37:33] own homes amen we don't have to be a
[1:37:35] minister to do that
[1:37:36] we are each one called to do that amen
[1:37:39] the real church of the living god ought
[1:37:41] to be on fire burning with the light of
[1:37:42] the gospel being vindicated among them
[1:37:44] rise and shine for the light has come to
[1:37:46] you the light
[1:37:48] of this day isaiah was the light of his
[1:37:50] day
[1:37:51] noah was the light of his day why he had
[1:37:54] the word manifested say how did noah
[1:37:57] have the word manifested
[1:37:59] he said this is what's going to happen
[1:38:01] and then he made preparation
[1:38:03] so that it wouldn't take him down that's
[1:38:06] the word manifested
[1:38:07] is that it's preparing you to get out
[1:38:09] from under the judgment that's coming if
[1:38:10] you don't accept the light that you're
[1:38:12] speaking of
[1:38:13] and the gospel the bible words for this
[1:38:15] day
[1:38:16] is the light of the day he says what a
[1:38:19] glorious time
[1:38:20] that we are living and many musicians
[1:38:22] can come if they want amen
[1:38:23] he says what a glorious time that we are
[1:38:25] living but
[1:38:26] we have to be in the light it's not a
[1:38:29] glorious day if you're an unbeliever
[1:38:30] it's not a glorious day if you don't
[1:38:32] have the holy ghost it's not a glorious
[1:38:34] day if god's not moving and working in
[1:38:35] your life amen
[1:38:36] but as long as we welcome the light of
[1:38:38] god in our lives as long as that faith
[1:38:40] is being built up
[1:38:41] as long as he's cleaning us out as long
[1:38:43] as he's changing us as long as he's
[1:38:44] growing us
[1:38:45] then we have confidence him and then we
[1:38:47] can look up
[1:38:48] then we can say if he's going to come
[1:38:50] tomorrow i know he's going to take me
[1:38:51] because he's been working on me all this
[1:38:53] time
[1:38:53] and then i'm not sitting back i'm not
[1:38:55] relaxing you know
