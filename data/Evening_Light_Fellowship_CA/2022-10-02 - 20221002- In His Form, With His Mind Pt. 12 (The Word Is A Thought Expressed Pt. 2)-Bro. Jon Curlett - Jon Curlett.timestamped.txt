[52:52] accepted in the Beloved
[52:56] Lord you paid a great price
[52:59] and or nothing we could ever do or say

[53:07] we have
[53:10] you can use it

[53:21] we ask your grace now for the service
[53:24] speak to hearts and souls we pray
[53:27] in Jesus Christ's name we ask him amen
[53:30] amen thank you musicians
[53:33] and if you turn the scriptures to First
[53:35] Corinthians chapter 2
[53:39] First Corinthians chapter 2.
[53:41] start at verse 9 amen just a few brief
[53:43] updates I just got a message from Sister
[53:46] Kimberly she said that Michael slept
[53:48] well through the night and he's still
[53:49] sleeping so
[53:52] thankful for that what a what a trip
[53:54] they've had
[53:57] as Paul says he says I don't know what's
[53:59] wrong he says Satan's always being mean
[54:00] to me
[54:02] amen anyways God's grace to them and
[54:05] certainly glad to hear that Michael's
[54:06] doing better also talked to brother Ed
[54:09] hammermeister last night and he said
[54:10] brother Dale Walsh lager should be
[54:11] arriving next weekend so the deacons
[54:13] will be reaching out to him to see kind
[54:15] of what his plans are and make some
[54:16] arrangements there so that we have some
[54:18] certainty about what to expect but
[54:20] certainly pray God's grace and traveling
[54:22] mercies to him as he uh as he moves over
[54:24] to Newfoundland as well
[54:26] amen First Corinthians 2 verse 9 says
[54:28] but as it is written I had not seen nor
[54:32] ear heard neither have entered into the
[54:34] heart of man the things which God hath
[54:36] prepared for them that love him
[54:38] but God hath revealed them unto us by
[54:40] his spirit for the spirit searches all
[54:42] things yea the Deep things of God for
[54:45] what man knoweth the things of a man
[54:47] save the spirit of man which is in him
[54:49] even so the things of God knoweth no man
[54:51] but the spirit of God in other words you
[54:54] can't it takes the spirit of God to know
[54:55] the things of God Amen a a chicken can't
[54:58] understand the things of a man because
[55:00] it doesn't have the spirit of a man
[55:01] inside of him and uh and Paul is saying
[55:04] here he says you've got to have the
[55:04] spirit of God to understand and know the
[55:07] things of God it won't come through the
[55:08] way of a man who's thinking or knowledge
[55:10] it says now we have received not the
[55:12] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[55:15] is of god that we might know the things
[55:17] that are freely given to us of God which
[55:20] things also we speak not in The Words
[55:22] which man's Wisdom teaches but which the
[55:25] Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual
[55:27] things with spiritual but the natural
[55:30] man receiveth not the things of the
[55:32] spirit of God for they are foolishness
[55:34] unto him neither can he know them
[55:36] because they are spiritually does
[55:38] discerned
[55:39] but he that is spiritual judges all
[55:41] things yet he himself is judged of no
[55:44] man for who had known the mind of the
[55:46] Lord that he may instruct him but we
[55:49] have the mind of Christ amen God bless
[55:52] you you can have your seats may you
[55:53] bless the reading
[55:55] of his word and we want to continue
[55:57] again in our series on in his form and
[55:59] with his mind and we're going to take
[56:00] the second part of of this idea that the
[56:03] word is a thought expressed amen and I
[56:05] want to we're building up to something
[56:07] and and I'm just going to take my time
[56:09] this morning I don't want to jump too
[56:11] too quickly I want to lay in a real
[56:13] Foundation before we get kind of to the
[56:15] purpose of this entire Series in the in
[56:17] the next service Lord willing but I want
[56:19] to take us back to this quote I read at
[56:21] the beginning
[56:22] and brother Brown says notice the
[56:24] harmony of the father and the son Jesus
[56:27] never did anything until it was first
[56:28] showed him by the Father John 5 19 he
[56:31] says this harmony is now to exist
[56:34] between the groom and his bride he shows
[56:36] her his Word of Life she receives it she
[56:39] never doubts it therefore nothing can
[56:42] harm her not even death for if the seed
[56:44] be planted the water will raise it up
[56:47] again here is the secret of this the
[56:49] word is in the bride as it was in Mary
[56:52] the bride has the mind of Christ for she
[56:55] knows what he wants done with the word
[56:56] she performs the command of the word in
[56:59] his name for he has she has thus saith
[57:02] the Lord but as we start to dig into
[57:04] this deeply this morning I want you to
[57:06] recognize one thing and that's if the
[57:08] word of God isn't In You by
[57:09] predestination you'll never get to what
[57:11] we're talking about amen if it's not in
[57:13] you to start then there's nothing can
[57:15] ever be done to put it in you later
[57:16] brother Branham says eternal life has no
[57:18] beginning and it has no end so therefore
[57:20] you either already always had it or
[57:23] you're never going to have it amen you
[57:25] will have people that will live
[57:26] Everlasting in the Kingdom that are not
[57:29] a part of the bride of Christ but they
[57:30] never had eternal life they never had it
[57:32] from the beginning to the end amen we
[57:34] preach the gospel of whosoever will may
[57:36] come and then we preach that why because
[57:38] I don't know who's in and I don't know
[57:39] who's out and honestly I don't want to
[57:41] know who's in and who's out amen let's
[57:43] God judge that but if you look into the
[57:44] scriptures and you see the sort of
[57:46] people that God called guess what we'd
[57:48] have probably put most of them out Paul
[57:49] when he was Saul had an antichrist
[57:51] spirit and persecuted the true church
[57:53] Peter was wishy-washy in the face of
[57:55] persecution amen we just said what's in
[57:57] that man's life he has nothing he's he's
[57:59] doing the wrong things he can't stand up
[58:01] for himself he he won't stick to the
[58:03] true path and so he's definitely out but
[58:05] yet these were Pinnacles and and pillars
[58:08] in the church right so it's not what we
[58:11] see right now but it's what God sees
[58:12] from eternity from the start to the end
[58:14] that's what determines who and is not a
[58:16] seed of God Amen it's somebody that he
[58:18] saw in his mind before it all began
[58:21] Job 14 says this it says I will pray the
[58:24] father and he will give you another
[58:25] comforter that he may abide with you
[58:27] forever even the spirit of Truth whom
[58:30] the world cannot receive because it
[58:32] seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye
[58:35] know him for he dwelleth with you and
[58:37] shall be in you so there's an elect
[58:39] people Jesus is saying that will both
[58:41] see and hear and receive the spirit of
[58:44] God for their age amen and they are
[58:46] elected they are predestinated it is not
[58:48] by chance it is it is not just because
[58:50] they happen to be in the right place at
[58:52] the right time but God foreordains this
[58:54] and they are there to receive what God
[58:56] has for them at their particular time
[58:57] amen otherwise those people can't
[58:59] receive it because they were never a
[59:01] part of God and they never will be a
[59:02] part of God Amen he doesn't add you into
[59:04] the family you either our family or
[59:06] you're not brother Brown puts it this
[59:08] way he says so God in the beginning was
[59:10] life the Eternal one and in him was
[59:12] attributes and those attributes became
[59:14] words and the word became flesh Jesus
[59:18] was the Redeemer and to redeem means to
[59:20] bring back if he has to bring it back it
[59:23] has to be somewhere to be brought back
[59:24] to so there's something to the word
[59:27] redeem the root is deem meaning you are
[59:29] you are deemed you are you are are
[59:31] considered your place someplace you're
[59:34] you're considered to be acceptable so if
[59:36] you are deemed then to redeem you means
[59:38] to bring you back to your acceptable
[59:39] place to to be suitable Amen to be
[59:42] accepted and so if he's redeeming it's
[59:44] because you already were something he's
[59:47] not taking you to something but he's
[59:48] taking you back to what you used to be
[59:50] amen so he has to bring it back it has
[59:53] to be somewhere to be brought back to so
[59:55] you see all people will never be able to
[59:58] see it because all people wasn't in the
[1:00:00] beginning in God's thoughts
[1:00:02] he says and this is in in the the church
[1:00:05] age book he says so it's a little more
[1:00:07] wordy as you might notice it is most
[1:00:09] evident from these scriptures that no
[1:00:11] man of himself can hear God that ability
[1:00:14] has to be given him of God and he quotes
[1:00:17] Matthew 16 17 where Jesus answered and
[1:00:19] said unto him blessed art thou Simon
[1:00:21] barjona for Flesh and Blood had not
[1:00:23] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:00:25] which is in heaven putting these verses
[1:00:27] together we see there's only one group
[1:00:29] of people and that is a very special
[1:00:31] group of people who are able to hear
[1:00:34] what the spirit says in each age and
[1:00:37] they are not special because of
[1:00:38] themselves
[1:00:39] okay that's the first thing we want to
[1:00:42] recognize is you're not special because
[1:00:43] of who you are you're special because of
[1:00:45] what he made you in the beginning amen
[1:00:47] there's nothing we bring in this flesh
[1:00:48] our our righteousness our goodness is as
[1:00:50] filthy rags the scripture says so we're
[1:00:52] not special because of anything we're
[1:00:54] doing or anything we've made ourselves
[1:00:56] or anything we brought ourselves to or a
[1:00:58] condition or anything like that he says
[1:01:00] it is one special group that receives
[1:01:02] the Revelation for each age that group
[1:01:05] is of God because the group that cannot
[1:01:07] hear is not of God
[1:01:09] John 8 then he says Jesus said unto them
[1:01:12] if God were your father you would love
[1:01:14] me for I proceeded forth and come from
[1:01:16] God neither came I of myself but he sent
[1:01:19] me why do you not understand my speech
[1:01:21] even because you cannot hear my word ye
[1:01:25] are of your father the devil and the
[1:01:28] lusts of your father ye will do he was a
[1:01:30] murderer from the beginning and Abode
[1:01:32] not in the truth because there is no
[1:01:34] truth in him it didn't just come to him
[1:01:37] but he says there's no truth in him
[1:01:38] there's nothing to respond there's no
[1:01:40] truth in him to respond to the truth
[1:01:42] that he's hearing amen there is no
[1:01:44] antenna to catch the thought or the mind
[1:01:46] of God there's nothing there to receive
[1:01:48] it it doesn't exist and so he can hear
[1:01:50] nothing if you take a radio and you
[1:01:52] break the antenna off of it what can
[1:01:54] that radio receive nothing
[1:01:57] it's a radio it's a human I'm human just
[1:01:59] like a sinner that can't receive God or
[1:02:01] someone that's not a child of God but I
[1:02:03] have an antenna and they don't why
[1:02:05] because he gave me an antenna that's
[1:02:07] tuned to his frequency
[1:02:09] now here's the thing they have an
[1:02:10] antenna but they only have one frequency
[1:02:12] and that's to hear what the influence in
[1:02:14] the word of Satan
[1:02:16] that's the only thing they're tuned to
[1:02:17] one thing and I'm tuned to another and
[1:02:18] guess what
[1:02:19] that nothing can change it nothing can
[1:02:22] change it you are what you are
[1:02:24] he says there is no truth in him when he
[1:02:26] speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own
[1:02:28] for he is a liar and the father of it
[1:02:31] and because I tell you the truth you
[1:02:33] believe me not
[1:02:35] then he says the group that can and does
[1:02:37] here what the spirit is saying and
[1:02:39] receives the Revelation thereof is that
[1:02:41] group described in First Corinthians 2
[1:02:43] 6-16 which we just read or most of it
[1:02:46] they are the ones who have the spirit of
[1:02:48] God they are the ones that are born of
[1:02:49] God they are baptized into the body of
[1:02:52] the Lord Jesus Christ by his Spirit they
[1:02:55] are baptized with the Holy Ghost amen so
[1:02:58] there is a group of predestinated people
[1:02:59] and when they hear this voice it has an
[1:03:01] effect amen it causes them to change in
[1:03:04] the first quote the prophet of God says
[1:03:05] the bride receives the Word of Life from
[1:03:08] Christ and he types it as a pregnancy
[1:03:10] right because the church is always a
[1:03:13] woman and Christ is always obviously of
[1:03:15] course typed as as the male so the thing
[1:03:18] you have to realize is that it's not a
[1:03:20] pregnancy and that you put something in
[1:03:22] that wasn't there because the word of
[1:03:25] life is in you already if we take this
[1:03:27] naturally to a woman she has an egg
[1:03:29] there yeah she has something that can be
[1:03:31] quickened but until she's with the man
[1:03:33] it can never be quickened she can never
[1:03:36] bring forth life amen but she has an egg
[1:03:38] there that can be quickened by the seed
[1:03:40] of that man and he says until you're in
[1:03:42] the presence of God until you are
[1:03:45] intimate with God the life that is
[1:03:47] within you cannot be born it cannot come
[1:03:49] forth it cannot start to produce and
[1:03:51] build itself into a real life
[1:03:54] and here's the thing you've got to
[1:03:56] remember that the seed inside of you the
[1:03:58] egg inside that woman can only be
[1:04:00] quickened by the seed of somebody just
[1:04:02] like her amen so you cannot be quickened
[1:04:05] by another seed a woman cannot be with a
[1:04:07] dog and produce life amen but if a god
[1:04:10] bride can be with God then it can bring
[1:04:12] forth God out of her life if a word
[1:04:14] bride can have a word seed inside of her
[1:04:16] then she can take the word and it
[1:04:18] quickens what is inside of her and it is
[1:04:21] the only thing that will Quicken is the
[1:04:23] only thing that will be quick and it was
[1:04:24] the only thing that will cause a
[1:04:26] quickening is when what is Insider comes
[1:04:28] in contact with the life that is outside
[1:04:30] of her in the man it's got to be the
[1:04:32] same thing and everything else will die
[1:04:34] you can put seed after seed after seed
[1:04:37] inside of that woman and it can cause
[1:04:39] all sorts of problems but it'll never
[1:04:40] bring life it's not going to happen amen
[1:04:44] that is the Revelation here is that when
[1:04:46] you come in contact with that which is
[1:04:49] already inside of you then life comes
[1:04:50] forth and nothing there nothing else
[1:04:53] will bring it forward and you can go
[1:04:55] time and time you can go around and
[1:04:57] around the mountain and nothing will
[1:04:59] happen until you come in contact with
[1:05:00] the life that he placed inside you
[1:05:02] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:04] hallelujah amen you have to oh if we can
[1:05:08] only catch that nothing's gonna cause us
[1:05:10] to live the way his presence will cause
[1:05:12] us to live the way his word will cause
[1:05:14] us to live when we truly let him be with
[1:05:17] us
[1:05:18] amen amen when we truly let him be
[1:05:19] intimate with us amen not just a
[1:05:22] relationship for the facade and for the
[1:05:25] the eyes of the world and the people in
[1:05:26] the church but when we truly let him
[1:05:28] come into us and give us what we have
[1:05:30] need of to Quicken that which is inside
[1:05:32] of us amen
[1:05:36] brother Brahm says you you're in a time
[1:05:38] space and the only thing that's Eternal
[1:05:40] is something that had no beginning or no
[1:05:42] end anything Eternal never had a
[1:05:44] beginning or it never will have an end
[1:05:46] see if you're a part of God the spirits
[1:05:49] that the spirit that's in you never had
[1:05:51] a beginning or it never will have an end
[1:05:53] and you're Eternal with the spirit of
[1:05:57] with the spirit that's in you so then
[1:05:59] what the what happens is what then in
[1:06:02] the presence of God by the hearing of
[1:06:04] the word that portion of God inside of
[1:06:06] us is quick into life and it starts to
[1:06:08] grow amen we realize who we are we
[1:06:10] realize who he is we realize what he's
[1:06:12] trying to do we realize that there's a
[1:06:14] purpose and a plan for us here and then
[1:06:16] what we hear the word of faith and that
[1:06:18] word of faith quickens what's inside of
[1:06:20] us and it starts to grow and build and
[1:06:21] multiply amen where you have one cell
[1:06:23] and then you have two and then it goes
[1:06:25] two to four and four to six or four to
[1:06:27] eight and then eight to sixteen and the
[1:06:29] more you're in it the quicker it expands
[1:06:31] amen because every cell is doubling
[1:06:32] doubling doubling doubling
[1:06:34] yeah so if you're not quickening if
[1:06:37] you're not growing then why is it
[1:06:38] because you're not sitting under the
[1:06:40] hearing of the word of faith amen that
[1:06:43] you're not getting yourself what in the
[1:06:45] thing that feeds your soul because
[1:06:46] there's only one thing that feeds the
[1:06:47] bride of Christ and that's the word of
[1:06:49] God Amen you can try the self-help books
[1:06:51] you can try education you can try all
[1:06:53] the things you want to try but there's
[1:06:54] only one thing that's going to feed the
[1:06:56] soul of the bride and that is the word
[1:06:57] of God because why that's the only thing
[1:07:00] that will cause the word to multiply
[1:07:02] amen it's got to have the same kind of
[1:07:04] food it's got to have the same source
[1:07:06] that its origin comes from amen it's got
[1:07:08] to be under the same sort of thing amen
[1:07:11] what happens otherwise otherwise it sits
[1:07:13] there and it gets stagnant and other
[1:07:14] things start to grow right other things
[1:07:16] start to build up and pretty soon what
[1:07:18] happens is you have what a miscarriage
[1:07:20] because it didn't continue to grow when
[1:07:23] the baby stops growing we've got a
[1:07:25] problem the food supply is cut off it's
[1:07:27] going to someplace else in the body amen
[1:07:29] so we got to make sure that what we're
[1:07:31] feeding ourselves is the right thing
[1:07:32] amen John 6 63 says it it is the spirit
[1:07:35] that quickeneth the flesh profiteth
[1:07:38] nothing
[1:07:39] the words that I speak unto you they are
[1:07:41] spirit and they are life
[1:07:45] that's what they have to be otherwise
[1:07:47] they do what
[1:07:48] they just become the letter that kills
[1:07:50] amen but their spirit and their life so
[1:07:53] the question this morning is is this
[1:07:55] life to you today can you honestly say
[1:07:57] this word is life to me amen can you say
[1:08:01] that without this word I will be dead
[1:08:04] my wife and I were walking this week and
[1:08:06] I said something along the lines of the
[1:08:08] world today is all about trying to find
[1:08:10] balance and fit the right things into
[1:08:11] their life and it'll never work because
[1:08:14] they're not doing it Through The Eyes Of
[1:08:15] God
[1:08:16] what do they do they're trying to strive
[1:08:18] for work-life balance we've all heard it
[1:08:19] right what work hard to get ahead but
[1:08:22] don't work so hard that you have no
[1:08:23] other life amen I have enough money to
[1:08:25] get what you need and have some fun
[1:08:27] besides exercise regularly get a good
[1:08:29] partner to share life with be educated
[1:08:31] and up to date to what's going on in the
[1:08:33] world travel see new things get New
[1:08:35] Perspectives support every cause and
[1:08:37] love everyone because everyone deserves
[1:08:39] to be happy amen do what's good for the
[1:08:41] earth and the environment stop climate
[1:08:43] change
[1:08:43] right and then for some go to church
[1:08:47] okay that's what it looks like for the
[1:08:50] world right now that's what a balanced
[1:08:52] life looks like for the world but the
[1:08:53] problem is that they're going about it
[1:08:55] based on their determination of what is
[1:08:57] the right balance for their life they're
[1:08:59] going about it with the thoughts of man
[1:09:01] and the way thereof is always what death
[1:09:03] it's not going to lead them to
[1:09:05] satisfaction it's not going to lead them
[1:09:06] to peace or rest it's not going to get
[1:09:08] them where they need to go
[1:09:10] amen and how many people do you see
[1:09:12] especially the most famous ones I think
[1:09:14] are the greatest example and they have
[1:09:16] hundreds of millions maybe billions of
[1:09:18] dollars and yet their lives are in
[1:09:20] shambles and they've got to take so many
[1:09:22] medications and so many drugs and they
[1:09:24] go through so many marriages and so many
[1:09:26] partners and they they wreck and they
[1:09:28] they binge and then they do what half of
[1:09:30] them go in go go by Suicide right
[1:09:34] why because they tried to bring a
[1:09:36] balance to it they tried to reach
[1:09:37] something and there is no end to it amen
[1:09:40] Satan's carrot is always dangling you
[1:09:42] never get to eat the carrot with Satan
[1:09:44] he just keeps moving it out moving it
[1:09:45] out moving it out moving it out why you
[1:09:47] take yourself all the way to destruction
[1:09:48] amen and then they look at all of this
[1:09:51] and if things aren't going well then
[1:09:53] what do they do whether you just say I'm
[1:09:54] going to put my time in different
[1:09:55] buckets I'm going to add a little bit
[1:09:57] more of this I'm going to change the
[1:09:59] balance in my life so that I feel better
[1:10:01] so that I so that things are going going
[1:10:03] better I looked this up while I was in
[1:10:05] the office 69 percent of Americans are
[1:10:07] overweight or obese today
[1:10:09] how's that balance working out for us
[1:10:11] I'm lumping Us in with the Americans
[1:10:14] not looking around the church actually
[1:10:15] we're doing pretty good but but when you
[1:10:17] look at the nominal World 69 of
[1:10:20] Americans are overweight how's the
[1:10:22] balance working out for you why do you
[1:10:24] do that because you don't pick the right
[1:10:26] Foods because you don't exercise because
[1:10:28] you don't have the right balance in your
[1:10:30] life
[1:10:31] we can't lead ourselves to balance we
[1:10:33] can't take ourselves to where we need to
[1:10:34] go away man
[1:10:36] so if we look at this for the unbeliever
[1:10:38] this is what a balanced life looks like
[1:10:39] and you see we have lots of wonderful
[1:10:42] little boxes here and I'm not saying
[1:10:43] they're all equal I'm just that's the
[1:10:45] way Excel works really nicely right but
[1:10:47] when you look at what they pull or
[1:10:49] bounce life through it's through what
[1:10:50] personal preferences
[1:10:52] opinions
[1:10:54] not just their own but those around them
[1:10:56] Family Values
[1:10:58] genetics
[1:10:59] guess what there are there are there are
[1:11:02] people that have proclivities towards
[1:11:04] alcoholism
[1:11:06] to be promiscuous
[1:11:07] failed marriages overeating sickness all
[1:11:11] these things pain avoidance it's the
[1:11:13] biggest one avoid pain I'll do anything
[1:11:15] it takes to not be uncomfortable
[1:11:18] appearances that's right how do I look
[1:11:21] physically how do I look at my work
[1:11:24] what's my reputation
[1:11:25] and then what the expectations of others
[1:11:27] and that's just a few I could have gone
[1:11:29] on and on and on but that's all the time
[1:11:31] I have for it but that's what they're
[1:11:33] pulling their balance life through is
[1:11:34] all of these different filters all of
[1:11:37] these ideas that they have and the ones
[1:11:38] that they value from people that are
[1:11:40] even outside of their life you know what
[1:11:41] half of the things people are doing
[1:11:43] today are based on what people like on
[1:11:44] on social media that they've never met
[1:11:46] and never really know anything about
[1:11:48] right it's all for the like that's all
[1:11:50] for the thumbs up it's all for the heart
[1:11:53] the heart and the you know not their
[1:11:55] heart but you know what I mean I'm
[1:11:56] saying right but when we look at what
[1:11:58] the Believers
[1:12:00] life looks like in terms of this balance
[1:12:02] we better see something different
[1:12:04] we better see something different all
[1:12:06] those boxes will be there
[1:12:08] and others but the way that it's managed
[1:12:11] in their life is going to be completely
[1:12:12] different First Corinthians says this
[1:12:14] for ye are Bob with a price therefore
[1:12:17] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:12:20] spirit which are
[1:12:23] gods so you're you're in a body you're
[1:12:26] in a life that does not belong to you
[1:12:29] so it's not yours to control
[1:12:31] amen you've got to answer to who owns it
[1:12:34] amen glorify God not only in your body
[1:12:37] sometimes we're so focused on the body
[1:12:39] but he says and in your spirit
[1:12:42] what does your spirit look like the
[1:12:44] thoughts you think the attitudes you
[1:12:46] have
[1:12:47] your discernment
[1:12:50] the things you say in your mind that are
[1:12:52] different than the things you do because
[1:12:54] you know you're supposed to do the right
[1:12:55] thing but you think something that's a
[1:12:56] little different but you say but I'm
[1:12:58] supposed to do this because I'm a
[1:12:59] Believer
[1:13:00] right you glorify them on the outside
[1:13:02] but in the inside the hearts it's a
[1:13:04] little further away than what your
[1:13:06] actions should suggests he says you got
[1:13:07] to do you got to bring the full package
[1:13:09] amen what is it to glorify God in your
[1:13:11] spirit means there's something inside of
[1:13:13] you that's greater than what's outside
[1:13:14] of you
[1:13:15] amen that that's not going to determine
[1:13:17] how you how you do things inside how you
[1:13:19] think and your attitudes and your
[1:13:21] motives and objectives First Corinthians
[1:13:23] also says ye are Bob with a price be not
[1:13:26] ye the Servants of men well John I've
[1:13:29] got to work yeah we've all got to work
[1:13:30] don't we but your boss is not your boss
[1:13:33] amen you're your boss because you answer
[1:13:36] to Christ he's the boss
[1:13:38] amen I I think I've told this story
[1:13:41] before but brother Cadre Diggs tells the
[1:13:42] story of a young man who was at a job
[1:13:45] and it was a good job and he was in a
[1:13:47] place that didn't have a lot of good
[1:13:48] jobs and they changed his shift on him
[1:13:51] and they wanted him to work evenings
[1:13:54] and that was fine with him but he says
[1:13:56] I'm sorry but on Wednesday nights I
[1:13:58] cannot work because I have church
[1:14:00] and they said if you can't work
[1:14:02] Wednesdays then we're gonna have to lay
[1:14:04] you off you know what he said lay me off
[1:14:09] but what he didn't realize
[1:14:12] was that he was their best worker
[1:14:17] and so they said say what he said yeah
[1:14:19] lay me off I'm I'm gonna have to leave
[1:14:21] the job then
[1:14:23] so they went and they huddled and they
[1:14:25] came back the next day and they said
[1:14:26] here's what we need you to do
[1:14:28] you come in they said how much time do
[1:14:31] you need on Wednesdays to go to church
[1:14:33] and get back he says well I need to be
[1:14:35] out of here by 6 30 and I don't know
[1:14:38] what time I'm going to be back
[1:14:40] right because guess what Satan will do
[1:14:42] he'll he'll pin you into a nine o'clock
[1:14:43] departure won't he just when it's
[1:14:45] getting good and then you got to leave
[1:14:47] for work he said so I don't know what
[1:14:49] time I would be back every service every
[1:14:51] Wednesday and they said well tell you
[1:14:53] what you come in and you work till 6 30
[1:14:55] and then you walk out that door and you
[1:14:58] don't clock out and when you get back
[1:15:00] you pick up where you left off whenever
[1:15:02] you get back okay that's how God rewards
[1:15:06] those that diligently seek Him He said
[1:15:08] I'm willing to leave it and they said
[1:15:09] who that's not going to work out well
[1:15:11] for us I guess we can accommodate you
[1:15:13] amen amen
[1:15:16] Paul points out we're not our own we're
[1:15:19] bought with a great price
[1:15:21] amen and we're supposed to live like
[1:15:22] that price is something we can pay back
[1:15:24] even though we know we can't a man that
[1:15:26] we're to Value it above all other things
[1:15:29] Colossians 3 17 says and whatsoever ye
[1:15:32] do in word or deed do all in the name of
[1:15:34] the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and
[1:15:36] the father by him now I've said this one
[1:15:38] before but for any True Believer their
[1:15:40] life is based on the will of God which
[1:15:42] is the word of God that's quickened and
[1:15:44] revealed to them
[1:15:45] so therefore we read about that quote
[1:15:47] where he says the bride knows what to do
[1:15:48] with the word and she has thus saith the
[1:15:50] Lord and we're talking about a mature
[1:15:52] bride this is for mature people now what
[1:15:54] we're getting into but we're checking on
[1:15:55] our maturity this morning if I could put
[1:15:57] it that way right but the the idea of
[1:15:59] this is that whatever you're doing
[1:16:01] you're supposed to be able to say God
[1:16:03] has put his name behind it amen
[1:16:05] amen that whatever you would say how I
[1:16:07] spent my day how I Spent My Time Each
[1:16:10] portion of it is stamped with the name
[1:16:12] of Jesus Christ thus saith the Lord thus
[1:16:14] saith the Lord that what I did on my
[1:16:16] phone was I saith the Lord that what I
[1:16:17] did in my computer was I saith the Lord
[1:16:19] what I did when work was done was I
[1:16:21] saith the Lord the people I talk to the
[1:16:23] things I said the way I spend my time is
[1:16:25] thus saith the Lord because why it's
[1:16:27] supposed to be able to give thanks to
[1:16:29] God and Father in the things you're
[1:16:31] doing
[1:16:31] so if you can say that then something's
[1:16:34] crept in that isn't of him isn't it amen
[1:16:38] you better stop and see where you left
[1:16:39] them then so often what we're doing is
[1:16:42] we're presuming because we have had
[1:16:43] unexperience with God that the way we're
[1:16:46] walking is his way
[1:16:47] and that couldn't be further from the
[1:16:49] truth think of Samson
[1:16:50] how many times did Samson remember he
[1:16:53] was messing around where he shouldn't
[1:16:54] have been messing around and he kept and
[1:16:56] he'd wake up and he'd destroy the
[1:16:57] Philistines he'd destroy the Philistines
[1:16:59] to destroy the Philippines Philistines
[1:17:00] until he gave away his secret she shaved
[1:17:02] his head and he got up just like the
[1:17:04] last time the last couple of times and
[1:17:06] said I will go out and he knew not that
[1:17:10] his strength had left him yeah why
[1:17:12] because he had broken his Covenant he
[1:17:14] had given it away he had lost the tie to
[1:17:16] God and he went out and what they do
[1:17:18] they overpowered him easily brother
[1:17:20] Brown said Samson wasn't some big
[1:17:21] muscular dude yeah he was a little
[1:17:23] scrawny tiny little man because he only
[1:17:26] performed Feats of Strength when what
[1:17:27] the spirit of God Came Upon him right so
[1:17:30] it wasn't anything he did in the first
[1:17:31] place amen you've got to be able to say
[1:17:33] is god with me and if he's not then go
[1:17:35] back and find him where in the path of
[1:17:37] his perfect will right where you left
[1:17:39] him amen so as a Believer we don't have
[1:17:42] a little compartment you know for for
[1:17:45] for career and another one for
[1:17:46] relationships and exercise and fun and
[1:17:48] pleasure and all these things right
[1:17:49] that's the way the world works but for
[1:17:51] the believer we have one thing and that
[1:17:53] is what the word of God
[1:17:55] and everything else has to fit in and
[1:17:57] through the word of God so you just have
[1:17:59] the word of God and everything
[1:18:01] automatically or will automatically come
[1:18:04] into its place and balance within your
[1:18:06] life if you run it through the word of
[1:18:08] God now Matthew 22 says Master what is
[1:18:11] the greatest commandment of the law and
[1:18:13] Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the
[1:18:14] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[1:18:16] thy soul and with all thy mind this is
[1:18:18] the first and great commandment
[1:18:21] so this is the filter of our life right
[1:18:23] here
[1:18:24] then in John 14 15 says if you love me
[1:18:26] keep my Commandments
[1:18:29] I Love You Lord remember he spoke of the
[1:18:31] Israelites he said this is a people that
[1:18:32] with their lips they draw an eye to me
[1:18:34] but their heart is far from me yeah amen
[1:18:36] he says you're going to do it if you
[1:18:38] believe it if you really love me you're
[1:18:40] going to do something amen you're not
[1:18:41] going to just sit there and say Lord I
[1:18:42] love you I love your word I love the
[1:18:44] message of the hour no your life is
[1:18:46] going to reflect it because you'll be in
[1:18:47] obedience to what you're hearing amen
[1:18:49] it'll become a very part of you amen
[1:18:51] amen so everything that is within our
[1:18:54] life is supposed to come under the
[1:18:55] authority and through the filter of the
[1:18:57] word of God Amen and if there's
[1:18:59] something new that ought not to be then
[1:19:00] something is slipped through we've let
[1:19:01] the Phil we've put a hole in the filter
[1:19:03] and we put the hole in the filter don't
[1:19:06] we we put it in there it's not there we
[1:19:07] put it in there we open up we say well
[1:19:09] that's not what it means or that doesn't
[1:19:10] apply to me or God has Grace no no no no
[1:19:13] no you put the filter then you're going
[1:19:15] to reap
[1:19:16] amen you're going to reap the problem
[1:19:17] because scripture says uh you know God
[1:19:20] is Not mocked whatsoever a man shall
[1:19:21] shall sow that shall he also reap see
[1:19:24] because the word says there's a
[1:19:25] consequence for everything that we do
[1:19:27] and you think well I'm a Child of God
[1:19:28] he'll just forgive me no that's not the
[1:19:30] way it works he will forgive you but the
[1:19:33] difference between you and the world is
[1:19:34] that when it when the bad thing happens
[1:19:36] to you when the correction happens to
[1:19:37] you you'll learn from it right that
[1:19:40] he'll turn it into something good
[1:19:41] because it'll pull you away from that
[1:19:43] thing you're doing from those people
[1:19:44] you're around from whatever it is that
[1:19:46] you've done that's outside of the word
[1:19:48] of God and he'll turn that around and
[1:19:50] he'll get you to learn a lesson so that
[1:19:52] you don't do it again
[1:19:53] right rest of the world they'll just get
[1:19:55] hurt and they'll come back and do it
[1:19:56] again and again and again and again
[1:19:57] because they like it too much amen but
[1:19:59] he'll show you you don't want to do this
[1:20:01] because of the effect it has in your
[1:20:02] life
[1:20:03] so what it looks like now for the
[1:20:04] Believers that we have all of these very
[1:20:06] same things but we just have one thing
[1:20:09] and the thing that surrounds all of this
[1:20:11] is the word of God and if it can't get
[1:20:13] through the word then it doesn't get in
[1:20:14] here
[1:20:15] it can't get in there right and we
[1:20:18] talked about it last time whether
[1:20:19] whether it's it's money
[1:20:21] that never has the preeminence
[1:20:23] gotta provide amen the entertainment we
[1:20:26] have you run you really can't do much in
[1:20:28] terms of entertainment these days
[1:20:30] in terms of anything with the world has
[1:20:32] it's just not there anymore education
[1:20:34] where we go what we do how we spend our
[1:20:36] time
[1:20:36] what it takes us away from all these
[1:20:38] things they feed into these different
[1:20:39] things amen
[1:20:42] I read this quote just before I came to
[1:20:44] the pulpit
[1:20:46] and so I don't have it in my slides but
[1:20:47] brother Bram said this in the message
[1:20:48] enticing Spirits he says give me a
[1:20:50] preacher give me a Christian give me a
[1:20:53] housewife that's a Christian give me a
[1:20:56] farmer or a factory worker that'll put
[1:20:58] God first in everything and I'll show
[1:21:01] you a man that'll be successful in spite
[1:21:03] of all the devil can put on him he seeks
[1:21:06] God first amen amen I was talking with a
[1:21:10] brother this week and and sharing just
[1:21:12] just some of the things that God has
[1:21:14] done for me in my career and my
[1:21:16] testimony to him has never been that it
[1:21:17] was always because I was the best or the
[1:21:19] greatest or the smartest or the most
[1:21:20] capable but that God gave me favor with
[1:21:23] my bosses and I've always said that I'm
[1:21:26] not a stupid person I'm well educated
[1:21:27] but there's lots of smart well-educated
[1:21:29] people out there Amen in the big pond
[1:21:33] I'm a little fish
[1:21:34] and yet by Grace God has treated me like
[1:21:36] a big fish in those ponds and it's his
[1:21:38] grace that's done and I've never I've
[1:21:40] never thought otherwise you know and I
[1:21:42] was encouraging him to seek what the
[1:21:43] will of God and seek the kingdom of God
[1:21:45] first rather than what success because
[1:21:49] God will give you as much success as you
[1:21:50] can handle
[1:21:52] that's it and then when you reach the
[1:21:54] Pinnacle of what he thinks you can
[1:21:55] handle then he'll leave you there and
[1:21:57] you'll be fine with it and you'll be
[1:21:58] content with it because you followed him
[1:21:59] all along the way right
[1:22:01] brother or Paul says this in Romans 6 he
[1:22:04] says no you not that to whom you yield
[1:22:06] yourself servants to obey his servants
[1:22:08] ye are to whom you obey whether of sin
[1:22:11] unto death or of obedience unto
[1:22:13] righteousness so in other words whatever
[1:22:14] you spend your time and money and energy
[1:22:17] on that's your master
[1:22:19] so if you're seeking one thing and it's
[1:22:21] outside the word of God then your master
[1:22:23] is outside the word of God but if you're
[1:22:25] seek him first the kingdom of God and
[1:22:26] it's according to the word then it's
[1:22:28] going to lead you into what
[1:22:29] righteousness he says everything else
[1:22:31] leads to death
[1:22:32] but God be thanked that ye were the
[1:22:34] Servants of sin
[1:22:36] until the new birth we all were whether
[1:22:38] we were raised in the message raised in
[1:22:39] a Christian Home rarely did anything
[1:22:41] like the Rich Young Ruler you're still
[1:22:43] what the Servants of sin but ye have
[1:22:46] obeyed from the heart that form of
[1:22:49] Doctrine which was delivered unto you
[1:22:51] being then made free from sin ye become
[1:22:54] the Servants of righteousness
[1:22:57] brother man puts it this way in the
[1:22:58] spoken words the original seat he says
[1:23:00] the Bible has got to be in you the word
[1:23:02] is a seed he says as long as it's laying
[1:23:05] here just like this it won't do nothing
[1:23:08] but when it comes in here when it comes
[1:23:10] in the heart then it begins to manifest
[1:23:12] by the Holy Spirit The Works of God Amen
[1:23:15] listen now he says them Visions come
[1:23:18] power comes humility comes
[1:23:21] oh we love the power and we love the
[1:23:23] Visions wouldn't we how about the
[1:23:25] humility
[1:23:26] he says all your know-it-all is gone I'm
[1:23:29] gonna stop here because I've got to
[1:23:30] quote maybe I'll share the full thing in
[1:23:33] another service but brother Brown said
[1:23:34] when you see a person that's got the
[1:23:36] answer to everything that's contrary to
[1:23:38] the word
[1:23:40] wow what about prophets brother John
[1:23:43] remember when the the woman came the
[1:23:45] shooter my woman I believe came to to to
[1:23:48] the prophet and he saw she was troubled
[1:23:51] and and he says I don't know what's
[1:23:53] going on God has hidden this thing from
[1:23:55] me right brother Brown says God only
[1:23:57] reveals To His prophets and the servants
[1:23:59] the things they need to know that's it
[1:24:01] so they don't have an answer for
[1:24:02] everyone they're not called to give an
[1:24:04] answer to everything but they have what
[1:24:05] they need to know he says all your
[1:24:07] know-it-all is gone you become nothing
[1:24:09] Christ becomes alive you die he lives
[1:24:13] there it is because he died I live when
[1:24:15] I die he lives again and when I die he
[1:24:18] promised me life and I died out to
[1:24:21] myself so in order I can have his life
[1:24:23] and how do I do it by taking his word
[1:24:26] his seed put it in put a seed in here by
[1:24:29] faith and believe it and then it
[1:24:31] produces exactly what the Bible said
[1:24:33] amen the prophet's giving instruction
[1:24:35] and he says you've got a seed inside of
[1:24:37] you because that's the sieging of God
[1:24:39] but you've got to keep what taking the
[1:24:42] word of God and planting it into your
[1:24:43] life to produce the fruit of the spirit
[1:24:45] you've got to be packing inside of you
[1:24:47] to feed your soul so it will produce the
[1:24:49] Life of Christ amen amen once you have
[1:24:52] the experience it's got to keep fed amen
[1:24:54] you got to keep pushing it you got to
[1:24:55] keep watering you you got to keep giving
[1:24:57] it the same thing that started it amen
[1:24:59] right it's got to be the same thing that
[1:25:01] started amen otherwise it's just going
[1:25:03] to wither and die on the vine so to
[1:25:05] speak amen
[1:25:06] otherwise what happens
[1:25:09] it'll try and choke out the life of God
[1:25:10] inside of you amen and I'll try and what
[1:25:13] eat up the fruit of the spirit it'll
[1:25:15] steal the fruit of the spirit is what
[1:25:16] it's going to do amen it'll steal your
[1:25:18] discernment it steals your passion to
[1:25:19] serve God and it'll draw you away from
[1:25:21] The Fellowship of the Saints
[1:25:23] yeah it's easy to see it's easy to see
[1:25:26] because people get less and less
[1:25:27] satisfied with their life then they
[1:25:29] start to pull away from the church they
[1:25:30] start to pull away from the word of God
[1:25:31] and then pretty soon they're out there
[1:25:33] doing their own thing
[1:25:34] why because they didn't keep feeding
[1:25:36] their experience amen and here's the
[1:25:38] thing
[1:25:39] this is blunt if it dies like that it
[1:25:42] never started in the first place because
[1:25:44] what once it starts it can never die
[1:25:46] once the the new birth does not die
[1:25:48] can I put it that way the new birth does
[1:25:50] not die
[1:25:52] why because it's eternal life quickened
[1:25:54] inside of you so if you're going out and
[1:25:55] coming in going out and coming in
[1:25:57] there's a problem because that's not the
[1:25:58] way eternal life Works amen once and for
[1:26:01] all right it's done you're sealed to the
[1:26:04] day of your Redemption until you get to
[1:26:05] that place it'll be in and out in and
[1:26:07] out in and out doesn't mean you're not a
[1:26:09] child of God just means you haven't
[1:26:10] received a new birth yet amen
[1:26:13] let's look at another quote just to
[1:26:15] settle this thought
[1:26:16] this is speaking of Jesus it says notice
[1:26:18] see his sinless nature expressed what he
[1:26:21] was
[1:26:22] he then if his sinless nature God
[1:26:24] expressed himself through that sinless
[1:26:26] nature it shows that our nature is evil
[1:26:28] why because the things that we express
[1:26:30] by Nature are evil
[1:26:32] so he says what's in because the things
[1:26:34] you do are evil that means that what's
[1:26:35] inside of you is evil to start with
[1:26:38] and no matter how much we try to patch
[1:26:40] it up how much we try to indoctrinate it
[1:26:42] with other things it's got to become
[1:26:44] sinless like he was and then God's word
[1:26:46] can flow through it
[1:26:48] now listen to what he says he says that
[1:26:50] doesn't mean perfection in yourself you
[1:26:52] can't be that praise the Lord that I
[1:26:54] don't have to worry about the Perfection
[1:26:55] part yeah
[1:26:57] he says but you see even our people are
[1:27:00] getting away from the practice of
[1:27:01] Holiness in other words they're saying I
[1:27:03] can't be perfect so I don't need to
[1:27:04] worry so much about what I look like
[1:27:06] about the things I do the things I say
[1:27:08] how I spend my time money and energy it
[1:27:10] doesn't matter because he's my sinless
[1:27:11] perfection
[1:27:13] but that's not it that has nothing to do
[1:27:15] with it
[1:27:15] he says we begin to let down so many
[1:27:18] bars see
[1:27:19] so he's saying what you've got to come
[1:27:21] back to what the Highway of Holiness
[1:27:23] he says we got to come to that place in
[1:27:25] our profession he is our example he is
[1:27:29] our sin Bearer and then if we profess
[1:27:32] that he is our Peacemaker he's our
[1:27:33] propitiation then if we profess that
[1:27:36] then that is supposed to reflect him
[1:27:38] back in us why because we're looking to
[1:27:42] him the author and finisher of our faith
[1:27:44] it says and we are a written epistle a
[1:27:47] Looking Glass that people can see Christ
[1:27:50] in us we're reflecting him and then
[1:27:52] people can look at us and see him right
[1:27:55] because the moon reflects what the light
[1:27:57] of the sun she has no light of her own
[1:28:00] right he says and now if they don't then
[1:28:04] we're looking at something else and
[1:28:06] we're not looking to him
[1:28:07] he says if they can't see Christ in you
[1:28:09] the problem isn't necessarily them but
[1:28:11] maybe you're looking at the wrong thing
[1:28:12] too
[1:28:13] now listen they're still not the
[1:28:14] majority of the world will never
[1:28:15] recognize Christ in us okay I'm not
[1:28:17] saying that but he's saying if somebody
[1:28:19] that ought to recognize Christ doesn't
[1:28:20] recognize Christ and the problems in you
[1:28:22] not in them
[1:28:24] says Look to Him all the ends of the
[1:28:25] world and live that's the only way you
[1:28:28] can he says a man can't be that in
[1:28:31] himself there's no way to educate it to
[1:28:33] it there's no way to join it there's no
[1:28:35] way to baptize it there's no way of
[1:28:37] doing nothing to it only kill it and
[1:28:41] then let it be born again and the new
[1:28:43] nature comes in that's the only way kill
[1:28:46] that nature of yourself and then the
[1:28:48] world becomes a living thing it just
[1:28:50] expresses itself through you see then
[1:28:53] you're looking in the Looking Glass when
[1:28:55] people sees you as a mirror because you
[1:28:58] know God has made a way
[1:29:00] catch this people won't read the Bible
[1:29:02] so God has made you a Bible
[1:29:06] you are what you do people is looking at
[1:29:10] you
[1:29:11] Glory listen
[1:29:13] the only thing most people are reading
[1:29:14] the Bible for is to go in and and catch
[1:29:17] what somebody says is a contradiction or
[1:29:19] that it supports their social agenda or
[1:29:21] their latest politics or ideologies and
[1:29:23] whatnot nobody's looking at it to truly
[1:29:25] understand it and be a part of it
[1:29:26] they're just looking at to pick and
[1:29:28] choose the things that support the
[1:29:29] little the little isms that they have
[1:29:31] amen
[1:29:32] but the prophet of God we're talking
[1:29:34] about remember the word is a thought
[1:29:35] expressed and so much of the focus is on
[1:29:38] what we're going to say you know and and
[1:29:40] third poll and spoken word and all these
[1:29:42] things and the prophet of God's pointing
[1:29:43] and he says the first way the word is a
[1:29:45] thought expressed is in your life
[1:29:47] amen you're the word of God for the
[1:29:49] people to read they won't read the Bible
[1:29:51] maybe they won't read it maybe they
[1:29:52] don't even know about it but they can
[1:29:54] see you and notice how you live and that
[1:29:56] is the expression of the word of God to
[1:29:58] them and it will be their judge at the
[1:30:00] final day your life will be their judge
[1:30:04] my question is can your life stand up
[1:30:07] to that amen amen what kind of attitude
[1:30:10] are we to have
[1:30:12] if he could turn his head when they
[1:30:13] slapped him and spit him and punched him
[1:30:15] and all these things what are we to be
[1:30:16] able to do
[1:30:17] amen what are we to be ignorant of
[1:30:21] listen we're in this world not of it and
[1:30:25] yet so often we know so much about the
[1:30:26] things that have nothing to do with the
[1:30:27] kingdom of God now some of it's just
[1:30:29] because we're in the world and you you
[1:30:31] hear things and you see things but let
[1:30:32] us not be seeking those things which
[1:30:34] have nothing to do with the kingdom of
[1:30:35] God Amen
[1:30:37] second Corinthians 3 says Do We Begin
[1:30:40] Again to commend ourselves or need we as
[1:30:43] some others Epistles of commendation to
[1:30:44] you or letters of combination
[1:30:45] Commendation from you Paul's saying do
[1:30:47] we need a letter of recommendation to
[1:30:49] come into the church
[1:30:50] he says ye are our Epistles written in
[1:30:54] our hearts known in red of all men Paul
[1:30:55] says you Corinthian Church what has
[1:30:58] happened in your life since you've said
[1:30:59] under the teaching of the word through
[1:31:01] US you're our proof you're our letter of
[1:31:04] recommendation now if you notice the
[1:31:06] Corinthian Church was one of the worst
[1:31:09] that gives me hope
[1:31:12] that the ones I received the most
[1:31:14] instruction and perhaps some of the
[1:31:15] greatest frustration from Paul for their
[1:31:17] their lack of fervency in their ins and
[1:31:19] outs and their UPS you know all these
[1:31:22] different things that Yeti says still
[1:31:23] you're our Epistles seen him right about
[1:31:25] men there has been a change and it's
[1:31:27] taken you in the right direction amen
[1:31:29] don't get caught up on how bad you are
[1:31:32] look at what you used to be and look at
[1:31:34] where you are now and say if there's a
[1:31:35] difference then praise God he's moving
[1:31:37] me amen and he'll move you along he'll
[1:31:39] get you all the way to the Finish Line
[1:31:40] amen Paul's saying you're our proof of
[1:31:42] what we preach that it's true and it's
[1:31:44] real he says for as much as ye are
[1:31:47] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[1:31:50] Christ Minister by US Written not with
[1:31:52] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[1:31:54] God not in tables of stone but in fleshy
[1:31:57] tables of the heart
[1:31:58] that that phrase manifestly declare
[1:32:00] means to make actual invisible
[1:32:03] so in other words it is the literal
[1:32:05] interpretation of what Paul preached
[1:32:08] he says you are the literal
[1:32:09] interpretation of my word church
[1:32:11] Corinthian Church as bad as you are
[1:32:13] you're the literal interpretation of the
[1:32:15] word that I've been preaching to you
[1:32:16] amen what is it the word is a thought
[1:32:18] expressed they became the word that was
[1:32:21] spoken to them and they received it with
[1:32:23] joy and what did it do it produced the
[1:32:25] life of the word that was there amen
[1:32:26] amen amen amen it's not just about
[1:32:28] saying the right thing it's about
[1:32:30] recognizing the word and then expressing
[1:32:33] that out through your life amen that's a
[1:32:35] that's always the first sign of the
[1:32:36] Believers the first expression is what
[1:32:38] that they have a life change brother
[1:32:40] brother Brandon would would talk about
[1:32:41] Peter and John he says in scripture says
[1:32:43] it he says they looked on them and they
[1:32:45] saw that they were ignorant and
[1:32:46] unlearned but they knew they had been
[1:32:49] with Jesus
[1:32:51] ignorant and unlearned but yet they knew
[1:32:53] they had been with Jesus amen something
[1:32:55] that changed Peter wasn't wishy-washy
[1:32:57] anymore Peter had boldness Peter was
[1:32:59] actually eloquent enough to convince 3
[1:33:01] 000 Souls not by eloquence but by what
[1:33:04] the Holy Spirit flowing through him
[1:33:06] giving them the word of life and they
[1:33:07] received it with joy into their hearts
[1:33:09] amen like I said we're talking about a
[1:33:11] mature bride now and all we're doing is
[1:33:13] checking up on our maturity this morning
[1:33:15] amen and this is not a half in and half
[1:33:17] out Pride this is an All or Nothing
[1:33:19] bride and she is committed holy to the
[1:33:21] word of God amen amen and you can't move
[1:33:24] forward with god without separating from
[1:33:25] the things of the world cannot do it
[1:33:28] brother Bob says this about the
[1:33:29] scripture he says ye are written
[1:33:31] Epistles red of all men he says I
[1:33:33] translate that turn it around this way
[1:33:34] see just turn around you are Epistles
[1:33:36] that has been written because you can't
[1:33:38] add nothing to it you can't add nothing
[1:33:40] to the word he says that's red of all
[1:33:42] man manifest the word of God in other
[1:33:44] words and Peter and John to show it when
[1:33:46] they went up there they perceived there
[1:33:47] it is this is what I was talking about
[1:33:48] they perceived they were ignorant and
[1:33:50] unlearned they had no education but they
[1:33:52] take a notice that they have been with
[1:33:54] Jesus see they were ignorant and
[1:33:56] unlearning but they were written
[1:33:57] Epistles see read that they had been
[1:34:00] with Jesus because Jesus was manifesting
[1:34:02] himself through them Christ veiled in
[1:34:05] their flesh
[1:34:07] remember saying in his form Christ
[1:34:09] veiled in their flesh manifested made
[1:34:12] alive
[1:34:13] he says like he was in Moses when the
[1:34:16] word was in Moses he was God in flesh
[1:34:19] that'll choke every denominational
[1:34:22] believer
[1:34:24] when the word was in Moses he was God in
[1:34:27] flesh when it was in Jesus it was God in
[1:34:30] flesh see the only thing he'd done was
[1:34:32] change his mask not his word and not his
[1:34:35] nature he's the same yesterday today and
[1:34:37] forever he only changed his form he
[1:34:40] changed from Noah to Moses he changed
[1:34:42] from Moses to David from David and
[1:34:44] Joseph on down until he come to the
[1:34:46] fullness of the godhead bodily see it's
[1:34:48] still the same God Amen he says I hope
[1:34:50] that gets through see it is the same God
[1:34:53] but he just takes on another Veil
[1:34:56] he says now notice Made Alive
[1:35:01] it's for us he says and today when the
[1:35:05] word is manifested in human vessels
[1:35:07] plural because everyone will put this on
[1:35:10] Malachi 4. yeah
[1:35:12] yeah Malachi 4 this is what he's talking
[1:35:14] about he says human vessels plural veils
[1:35:18] plural it's absolutely the word
[1:35:22] fulfilled in that day which comes back
[1:35:24] to God Amen his word will not return
[1:35:27] unto him void he says being baptized
[1:35:30] into him according to First Corinthians
[1:35:32] 12 we become identified with him amen
[1:35:36] amen
[1:35:37] speaking of Moses he says but you see he
[1:35:40] identified himself as God's Prophet for
[1:35:42] what he said come to pass then they
[1:35:44] knowed he had the word of the Lord
[1:35:46] Pharaoh had Spears but Moses had the
[1:35:49] word
[1:35:50] so when they got to the Sea the spears
[1:35:53] all went under the sea now most people
[1:35:55] would have said I'll take the spears
[1:35:57] over the word every time but when they
[1:35:58] came to what the separating Waters the
[1:36:01] waters consumed the Spears and the word
[1:36:03] walked right on through
[1:36:04] amen when they went to the Sea the
[1:36:06] spears all went undersea and Moses took
[1:36:08] Israel across the sea on dry land why
[1:36:11] because he had the word and he was the
[1:36:14] word of that hour Moses was the word may
[1:36:18] manifest for that hour Elijah was the
[1:36:20] word may manifest for that hour Christ
[1:36:22] is the word made manifest and the
[1:36:24] promises that he made
[1:36:26] a little while in the world seeth me no
[1:36:28] more you shall see me for I'll be with
[1:36:30] you even in you to the end of the world
[1:36:31] the works that I do shall you do also he
[1:36:33] says he promised these things what is it
[1:36:36] it's the characteristic of God
[1:36:39] displaying his word like he did in all
[1:36:43] ages this is not a new thing this is not
[1:36:45] just for the the laodicein or the bride
[1:36:48] age this he's been doing it all along
[1:36:50] that's why brother Brahm says after the
[1:36:52] Seven Seals he says the Bible became a
[1:36:54] new book and if you can't see who Christ
[1:36:56] if you can't see Christ in every page go
[1:36:59] back and read it again because he's been
[1:37:02] revealing himself all the way through
[1:37:04] from Genesis to Revelation so he's not
[1:37:06] just doing it with them but he's got to
[1:37:08] take it all the way to us amen
[1:37:10] amen I'm trying to paint a picture here
[1:37:13] this morning because so much we're
[1:37:14] caught up in this idea of I need to have
[1:37:16] faith to to to have the spoken word or I
[1:37:19] need to have faith to have the third
[1:37:21] poll amen it's not about you and I just
[1:37:23] getting enough Faith to say something
[1:37:25] and it happens the way we said it it's
[1:37:27] so much bigger than that and it's so
[1:37:29] much simpler than that Amen brother
[1:37:31] Graham said Moses had the word for the
[1:37:33] hour and Moses was the word of that hour
[1:37:35] and then Moses was the word may manifest
[1:37:37] for that hour so what the key is not
[1:37:40] necessarily faith in and of itself but
[1:37:42] the key is do you have the word of God
[1:37:44] for you for this hour because that's
[1:37:48] what made the difference with Moses amen
[1:37:50] Moses was always a deliverer you always
[1:37:54] were a child of God you always were the
[1:37:56] bride of Christ that is not in question
[1:37:58] amen but he wasn't always the word
[1:38:01] manifested why because he went and he
[1:38:04] kills that Egyptian and then he tries to
[1:38:06] judge the children of Israel what ahead
[1:38:08] of his time he was still a deliverer but
[1:38:11] until he came into the presence of God
[1:38:13] until he her he met the I am until he
[1:38:16] got a commission of what to do and how
[1:38:18] to do it and to whom he should do it he
[1:38:20] was not the word but as soon as he got
[1:38:22] that he became the word and nothing
[1:38:24] could stand before him why he had found
[1:38:27] the word for his hour he stepped into it
[1:38:29] and brother Graham says that was Christ
[1:38:33] that was Christ right there he wasn't
[1:38:36] dead up to that point he was always
[1:38:38] going to be it but he wasn't it yet
[1:38:40] until he had that burning bush
[1:38:42] experience until you have your burning
[1:38:45] bush experience you're not going to be
[1:38:46] the word made flesh
[1:38:48] doesn't mean you aren't going to be just
[1:38:50] means you're maybe not it yet and I'm
[1:38:53] not speaking like I'm the same as Paul
[1:38:54] not as if I have attained by any means a
[1:38:56] seat this morning no man amen I we're
[1:38:58] all in this together and I'm preaching
[1:39:00] it to me as much as I am to you amen but
[1:39:02] the thing is the word for your hour is
[1:39:04] what makes you display the attributes of
[1:39:06] God that he has ordained for you amen
[1:39:09] for you we're not going to display all
[1:39:12] things to all people we're not all
[1:39:15] called into the ministry we're not all
[1:39:16] called We're Not all men we're not all
[1:39:18] women amen we're not all called to be
[1:39:20] educated we're not all we're so
[1:39:22] different God has just a an absolute
[1:39:25] variety
[1:39:26] of attributes and guess what he gives us
[1:39:29] a bunch of different people to express
[1:39:30] them yes yes amen because the fullness
[1:39:33] is now in a multi-member body not in any
[1:39:35] one of us individually
[1:39:37] right yes yes so the question is what
[1:39:39] does God want you to display
[1:39:41] I'm looking for what he wants me and you
[1:39:44] look for what he wants you and that's
[1:39:46] when you'll step into the word and
[1:39:47] that's when you'll step into what third
[1:39:49] pull that's when you'll step in the
[1:39:51] spoken word because you'll know exactly
[1:39:53] what he wants you to do with the word
[1:39:56] that he has given you amen amen not just
[1:39:59] the word pick this up and try and make
[1:40:01] every little bit of it live in your life
[1:40:02] and you won't do it why because it's not
[1:40:04] all meant for you brother Brian would
[1:40:06] even go so far you talk about you say
[1:40:07] listen Moses didn't go around building
[1:40:09] arcs
[1:40:10] the word was there that's the word the
[1:40:13] word was there but that was not Moses
[1:40:15] word and David didn't live by Moses word
[1:40:17] in the sense of Moses doing what he had
[1:40:19] to do each and every one of them got
[1:40:20] their own marching instructions from God
[1:40:22] Amen
[1:40:23] John 5 and they said unto him
[1:40:26] what shall we do that we might work the
[1:40:28] works of God
[1:40:30] okay you're saying brother John how do I
[1:40:31] find out what I'm supposed to do this is
[1:40:33] the answer
[1:40:35] Jesus answered said unto them this is
[1:40:38] the work so they asked Works he said
[1:40:41] this is the work of God that you believe
[1:40:44] on him whom he have sent
[1:40:46] brother Bible point to this and say the
[1:40:48] word of God is the work of God is to
[1:40:50] receive the word of
[1:40:51] the word of God for your age and for
[1:40:53] your hour amen that doesn't just mean
[1:40:56] the prophet of Malachi 4. but it starts
[1:40:59] there we believe because we've received
[1:41:00] this message amen because we paced
[1:41:03] ourselves in our time in our age in our
[1:41:05] Bible and so that no that lets us know
[1:41:07] that there had to come a Malachi 4. so
[1:41:09] we hear him but it doesn't end when he
[1:41:10] leaves the scene does it because the
[1:41:12] spirit keeps talking to us
[1:41:14] amen why because you have the spirit in
[1:41:16] you it wasn't only in brother Branham
[1:41:18] yeah yeah it's got to be in you
[1:41:19] otherwise you're dead
[1:41:21] right yes sir you've got to receive the
[1:41:24] ones that God sends and guess what they
[1:41:26] might look like men because what they
[1:41:28] are men
[1:41:29] you've got a prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:41:31] you've got a five-fold Ministry amen the
[1:41:34] Bible calls them angels and the Bible
[1:41:36] calls them Messengers
[1:41:37] and guess what it's dressed in a suit
[1:41:39] and looks like Jonathan Curley that's
[1:41:42] what we're stuck with
[1:41:44] amen amen but yet it is the voice of God
[1:41:48] amen right it's thundering out it's not
[1:41:50] just one prophet it's all of us under
[1:41:52] that inspiration but guess what we will
[1:41:54] not contradict that Prophet because that
[1:41:56] is the voice to the age and we'll read
[1:41:57] it right here right now Revelation 3
[1:41:59] says and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:42:01] the laodiceans right
[1:42:03] how many angels
[1:42:05] one there's only one Angel messenger
[1:42:08] there's only one Angel Messenger to
[1:42:10] laodicea he says these things saith thee
[1:42:12] amen the faithful and true witness the
[1:42:15] beginning of the creation of God so
[1:42:17] who's talking is this an angel just
[1:42:19] talking
[1:42:21] no it's Christ amen amen the message is
[1:42:24] going to be spoken by a man but that is
[1:42:26] just a voice it's God by the Holy Spirit
[1:42:29] speaking to the last Church age right
[1:42:32] so guess what you better know who that
[1:42:34] angel of laodicea is you better know
[1:42:36] because there's only one voice that'll
[1:42:38] take you to eternal life that I'll point
[1:42:40] you to the word for your hour and get
[1:42:43] you oriented correctly so that you know
[1:42:45] what to focus on and how to get there
[1:42:47] amen then we jump to verse 20 it says
[1:42:50] behold I
[1:42:52] personal pronoun who the faithful and
[1:42:55] true witness Jesus Christ behold I stand
[1:42:58] at the door and knock
[1:43:00] If any man hear my voice
[1:43:03] is it the voice of William Branham no
[1:43:05] sir
[1:43:05] sir no it's the voice of Christ through
[1:43:08] amen through a son of man a son of man
[1:43:12] right it is the voice of the Angel
[1:43:14] speaking to us and it says what if they
[1:43:17] will hear my voice and open the door why
[1:43:20] you've got to receive him that has been
[1:43:22] sent to you amen right if any man hear
[1:43:25] my voice and open the door then I
[1:43:28] personal pronoun the person of Christ
[1:43:30] will come into him and sup with him and
[1:43:33] he with me this is not a relationship
[1:43:35] with William Branham William Branham is
[1:43:38] not here this is a relationship and
[1:43:40] fellowship with Christ Alone amen we
[1:43:42] have no man between us and Christ The
[1:43:45] Voice opened the door and then Christ
[1:43:46] walks in if William Brennan walks in
[1:43:49] then we are idolaters
[1:43:50] right it's that simple yes sir amen I
[1:43:54] read that I just wish I could make it
[1:43:56] stand out to you the message does not
[1:43:58] tie us to a man amen the message gets
[1:44:00] you to open the door of your personal
[1:44:02] private life so that Christ himself can
[1:44:05] step in into your life your Private
[1:44:07] Affairs and you can have fellowship with
[1:44:09] him and him alone
[1:44:11] right to hear the voice of this age to
[1:44:14] catch the message of this age has one
[1:44:15] primary effect and that is that it will
[1:44:18] allow Christ to your life and there's
[1:44:19] only one person fellowshipping around
[1:44:21] that table there's only one influence
[1:44:23] there's only one voice there's only one
[1:44:25] channel that's coming at you amen and
[1:44:27] there's what no matter how many voices
[1:44:29] are outside yelling at that door you
[1:44:31] cannot hear them because you've got the
[1:44:33] voice sitting in front of you you're
[1:44:35] tuned into it and you can't hear
[1:44:36] anything else amen the scripture says
[1:44:39] there's only one voice my sheep hear my
[1:44:41] voice and another what they can't hear
[1:44:44] he says they hear my voice and I know
[1:44:47] them and they follow
[1:44:49] there's only one voice that we can hear
[1:44:51] amen there's only one way we are going
[1:44:53] to have that fellowship and that's if we
[1:44:54] open the door to Christ and then we shut
[1:44:56] the door after he's in amen amen amen
[1:44:58] amen once that door is closed once he's
[1:45:00] in why would we ever open it to anything
[1:45:02] else why would we ever allow another
[1:45:04] voice another influence another Doctrine
[1:45:06] another idea why would we open that up
[1:45:08] to another man another Ministry even why
[1:45:12] would we do that when we have Christ the
[1:45:14] the faithful one the great emancipator
[1:45:16] the amen the faithful and true witness
[1:45:18] the promise Giver the promise keeper
[1:45:20] sitting across the table from us why
[1:45:23] were we open to any other voice
[1:45:24] why were we open to an eighth messenger
[1:45:27] come on why were we open the new no we
[1:45:29] don't need it because the person of
[1:45:31] Christ is with us amen
[1:45:35] amen 21 says to him that overcometh that
[1:45:37] means there's going to be an overcomer I
[1:45:39] mean that means there's going to be an
[1:45:40] overcomer if there is a prize if there's
[1:45:43] a reward then that means somebody's
[1:45:44] gonna overcome amen I believe it's me I
[1:45:47] believe it's you this morning he says to
[1:45:49] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:45:51] with me in my throne even as I also
[1:45:54] overcame and am set down with my father
[1:45:56] and his throne he that hath an ear let
[1:45:59] him hear what the spirit say to the
[1:46:00] churches again who's talking to the
[1:46:02] church
[1:46:03] they hear the voice of the human
[1:46:05] messenger amen but who's speaking it's
[1:46:07] the Holy Spirit every single time and
[1:46:11] you've got to recognize what remember
[1:46:13] brother gel says this so many times he
[1:46:14] says they don't recognize the other
[1:46:17] angels
[1:46:18] he recognized he was an angel but he's
[1:46:21] pointing to what the angel of the Lord
[1:46:22] behind him that's doing all of this
[1:46:24] Abraham says I'm just a microphone
[1:46:27] amen what's he telling you Church what
[1:46:30] does this message do
[1:46:32] what's the effect of the message in the
[1:46:34] believer's life amen what it says that
[1:46:36] even though you're in a chicken yard
[1:46:37] you're an eagle
[1:46:39] amen even though you're in Fallen flesh
[1:46:42] you're a child of God that even though
[1:46:44] your family habits and traits and
[1:46:46] genetics are in your body yet you are a
[1:46:48] new creation in Christ
[1:46:51] what is it it's letting you know who and
[1:46:52] what you are amen
[1:46:54] amen and even though you've got Desires
[1:46:56] in your flesh that you don't want you've
[1:46:57] got a life inside of you that will
[1:46:59] subdue it and take you all the way over
[1:47:01] into a Rapture in a resurrection amen
[1:47:02] what's he doing he's telling you who you
[1:47:04] are and he's tying you back to him
[1:47:07] he's letting you know that this is not
[1:47:09] the start of something just this is
[1:47:11] something that started before you ever
[1:47:13] really knew about it amen he's tying it
[1:47:15] back to Eternity so that you'll
[1:47:16] recognize that it's going to go on
[1:47:17] forever and ever and what's he doing he
[1:47:19] takes his word and he says I wrote this
[1:47:21] about you this is for you this is to
[1:47:23] have an effect on you this isn't just
[1:47:25] about me but it's for you so that you
[1:47:27] can see what's yours to see what I've
[1:47:29] done see what I'm going to do to have
[1:47:30] faith that I'm going to take you all the
[1:47:32] way through these things amen what is it
[1:47:34] that's why we're not building arcs
[1:47:36] that's not we're not out there building
[1:47:37] armies to take natural lands we're not
[1:47:39] here to take Canada back we're not here
[1:47:41] to take the states back amen we're here
[1:47:43] to go what to a city whose Builder and
[1:47:44] maker is God Amen where pilgrims and
[1:47:47] strangers here amen amen
[1:47:49] what is it where Rapture bound
[1:47:51] and like John he's saying come up a
[1:47:53] little higher and dig a Little Deeper
[1:47:55] amen step out a little more have a
[1:47:58] little more faith
[1:47:59] confess and believe and move forward
[1:48:01] amen amen this book this is the word of
[1:48:04] God that we call a Bible is all about
[1:48:06] God's plan to redeem you and I back to
[1:48:07] him amen amen and what it's trying to
[1:48:10] get us in this time and in this Fallen
[1:48:12] flesh to express the word attributes
[1:48:14] that he gave us before there was ever a
[1:48:17] star before there was ever a light
[1:48:18] before there was ever a planet on this
[1:48:20] Earth but in his very mind amen
[1:48:23] brother Brown says this what I mean
[1:48:24] attributes was his thoughts and a word
[1:48:27] is a thought expressed and then that was
[1:48:29] in his thinking and when he said let
[1:48:31] there be and there was let there be and
[1:48:32] there was he says and now remember you
[1:48:34] Christians were his thoughts before
[1:48:36] there was a world and you are a
[1:48:38] manifestation of his thinking
[1:48:40] that gives me a lot of a lot of that
[1:48:43] makes me feel pretty good
[1:48:44] even in following condition that I am
[1:48:46] what a manifestation of his thinking
[1:48:48] before there was even a world you were
[1:48:50] in Christ and God in the beginning that
[1:48:52] makes you then you see his subjects and
[1:48:55] the whole thing is God himself
[1:48:58] materializing himself tangible so he
[1:49:01] could be handled seen and so forth
[1:49:04] that's what God is the whole thing he's
[1:49:07] not talking about Christ he's talking
[1:49:08] about you that God could be tangible
[1:49:11] could be handled
[1:49:13] and then the word is a thought expressed
[1:49:16] this is the mature bride's life that
[1:49:18] we're looking at amen God's just trying
[1:49:20] to get you and I to see one thing and
[1:49:21] that's that the word must be expressed
[1:49:23] and it's going to happen to you in you
[1:49:25] and it's going to happen in me amen amen
[1:49:27] it's not going to happen because we say
[1:49:29] it it's going to happen because he
[1:49:32] already said it he already thought it
[1:49:35] it's a finished work because his word
[1:49:37] cannot return to him void so we're not
[1:49:39] here to just start coming up with things
[1:49:40] by faith and I'm going to say this I'm
[1:49:42] going to say this and I'm going to do
[1:49:43] this and I'm going to do that no it's to
[1:49:45] catch what he has already said what he
[1:49:47] has already ordained in the time that he
[1:49:50] has ordained it and then you catch it
[1:49:51] and you believe it and you confess it
[1:49:54] and you speak it and it happens exactly
[1:49:55] the way you said it amen it is not about
[1:49:58] going out with some magical power that
[1:49:59] I've got the authority of Heaven behind
[1:50:01] me no I've found my place in the word
[1:50:04] and based on that I'm speaking right and
[1:50:07] it's not pain avoidance and it's not
[1:50:09] just to be blessed but it's to do what
[1:50:11] God has already ordained in your life
[1:50:15] brother Brown says this and I quoted it
[1:50:17] before but I want to dig into it a
[1:50:19] little bit
[1:50:20] we're starting to close he says look
[1:50:22] Christ in you makes him the center of
[1:50:25] light oh sorry
[1:50:27] we'll skip it that's fine look Christ in
[1:50:29] you makes him the center of life of the
[1:50:32] Revelation see Christ's life in you
[1:50:35] makes him the center of the Revelation
[1:50:36] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[1:50:39] complete revelation of Christ
[1:50:42] we we all say Amen to that Christ in the
[1:50:45] Bible makes it the complete revelation
[1:50:46] of God he says Christ in you
[1:50:50] makes you the complete revelation of the
[1:50:52] whole sick thing see what what God is
[1:50:55] trying to do
[1:50:57] it right the complete revelation of what
[1:50:59] he's trying to do today now this age
[1:51:02] this time in a gentile bride what is the
[1:51:05] new birth then it is the revelation of
[1:51:07] Jesus Christ personally to you amen see
[1:51:10] not you joined a church you didn't join
[1:51:13] the message you shook a hand you've done
[1:51:15] something different you said a Creed you
[1:51:16] promised to live by a code of rules but
[1:51:18] Christ the Bible he is the word that was
[1:51:21] revealed to you
[1:51:23] he says that no matter what anybody says
[1:51:25] what takes place it's Christ Pastor
[1:51:27] priest whatever it might be it's Christ
[1:51:29] in you that is the Revelation that the
[1:51:32] church was built upon remember he says
[1:51:33] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:51:35] personally to you then he says it's
[1:51:37] Christ in you
[1:51:39] okay
[1:51:41] so I could spend a year on that and we
[1:51:42] probably couldn't unpack that entire
[1:51:43] thing I meant but I want to just cover
[1:51:45] that that thought there he says it is
[1:51:47] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:51:48] personally to you he says this is the
[1:51:49] new birth
[1:51:51] so the first thing there's a revelation
[1:51:54] of who Jesus Christ is
[1:51:56] to you
[1:51:58] savior Master Lord healer provider
[1:52:00] deliver a comforter guide and all these
[1:52:01] things it's the nature and attributes of
[1:52:03] God being revealed to you right and the
[1:52:06] first thing is always what savior right
[1:52:08] he's your savior right and then he's
[1:52:10] your healer and he's all these different
[1:52:11] things but he's revealing what he is to
[1:52:13] you it's an external revelation of what
[1:52:16] he is to you personally okay so he's
[1:52:18] letting you know that what it's not just
[1:52:20] words on the page amen but it's there's
[1:52:23] a God that backs it up amen it's it's
[1:52:25] the actor and the nature boots of God
[1:52:26] Amen how how does he reveal it by the
[1:52:28] things we go through in life by the good
[1:52:30] things and the not so good things we see
[1:52:32] what all of the aspects of God you can't
[1:52:34] know he's a Healer unless you get sick
[1:52:35] man you can't know uh Deliverance unless
[1:52:38] you get bound and then you you can't
[1:52:40] know provision unless you get needy
[1:52:42] write down all these things you can't be
[1:52:44] you can't know a savior unless you're
[1:52:45] lost so all these things so it's the
[1:52:47] revealing of God himself to you but then
[1:52:50] there is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:52:52] to you which is the word revealed to you
[1:52:54] for the purpose of what your life
[1:52:56] expressing it
[1:52:58] because remember brother Brown says the
[1:52:59] revelation of Jesus Christ to you and
[1:53:01] then he says it's the Revel of the
[1:53:02] revelation of Jesus Christ in you amen
[1:53:04] so what is it that's the part of the
[1:53:06] Christian Walk Of God showing you
[1:53:08] himself amen the second part is showing
[1:53:12] you yourself
[1:53:14] first thing showing him the next thing
[1:53:16] showing you who you are and what it's
[1:53:18] Christ in you he says that's the
[1:53:20] Revelation that the church is built on
[1:53:22] so the outside thing the external
[1:53:24] revelation of Jesus Christ to you what
[1:53:25] is it it's the understanding and
[1:53:27] recognition and belief of all that he is
[1:53:29] by the word
[1:53:31] and then the second revelation of Jesus
[1:53:32] Christ you personally is what the
[1:53:34] understanding recognition and belief of
[1:53:36] who you are through Christ by the word
[1:53:39] you've got to receive an outside thing
[1:53:41] so you can become the inside thing amen
[1:53:43] so what's outside can come inside and
[1:53:45] you can start to express it amen brother
[1:53:47] Brian will put it this way he says now
[1:53:48] you're expressed after his word has come
[1:53:51] in you to light up this age
[1:53:55] wow
[1:53:56] wow remember
[1:53:58] when the angel Drew this perfectly there
[1:54:00] was no light
[1:54:01] brother Brown says I had permission to
[1:54:04] put a little thing in there to represent
[1:54:05] the bride but why was it dark because
[1:54:07] the bride is not in laodicea
[1:54:09] Christ is outside and they're outside as
[1:54:11] well right so there's just a bunch of
[1:54:13] individual homes here where the light is
[1:54:14] inside right but there is no group there
[1:54:17] is no no body there the bride has
[1:54:19] stepped out of that later cnh she's in a
[1:54:21] bright age and she's not part of it
[1:54:23] because she came out of her my people
[1:54:24] that's right right so she's not in there
[1:54:26] anymore but he says now you're the light
[1:54:28] of the age you are expressing God's life
[1:54:31] in you because you are a son or a
[1:54:33] daughter of God therefore you get what I
[1:54:35] mean see you're now made you're sitting
[1:54:37] in this church tonight because your duty
[1:54:39] is to express God to this nation and to
[1:54:42] this people and this neighborhood where
[1:54:44] you associate
[1:54:45] hey man God help us to do it and God
[1:54:47] help the people to recognize it yeah I'm
[1:54:49] reminded when sister Maureen was in that
[1:54:51] grocery store and the man was seeking
[1:54:53] God and and he saw her and he said I saw
[1:54:55] an angel
[1:54:59] can they say that about all of us I'm
[1:55:01] not lifting sister Brenda up or sister
[1:55:02] Maureen up but I'm saying can they
[1:55:04] recognize the light of God
[1:55:07] right
[1:55:09] can they recognize that
[1:55:10] can they realize there's something
[1:55:12] different about you and it's above and
[1:55:14] beyond anything they've ever seen or
[1:55:16] heard or run into contact with him right
[1:55:19] wherever you are God knew that you would
[1:55:21] be here because you have to be one of
[1:55:23] his genes or his attributes you have to
[1:55:25] you had to be and if you ever if you've
[1:55:28] got eternal life then it always was
[1:55:30] eternal life and God before there was a
[1:55:31] foundation
[1:55:33] before there was a world knew that you
[1:55:34] would be here
[1:55:35] and when the word or the water the
[1:55:37] washing of the water of the word fell
[1:55:38] upon you it was expressed in a being he
[1:55:41] says now you have fellowship with your
[1:55:43] father God just as you have with your
[1:55:45] Earthly father see you're citizens of
[1:55:47] the king not citizens only but you are
[1:55:49] children Sons and Daughters of the
[1:55:51] Living God if it be that the eternal
[1:55:53] life dwells in you now then if it was
[1:55:56] Jesus was the fullness of God manifested
[1:55:58] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:55:59] bodily therefore when he came to the
[1:56:02] Earth and was manifested in flesh you
[1:56:04] were hearing him then because he was the
[1:56:06] word amen he says in the beginning was
[1:56:08] the word the word was with God the Word
[1:56:10] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:56:11] dwelt Among Us the word was made flesh
[1:56:14] therefore you walked with him when you
[1:56:16] were in him when he was on Earth you
[1:56:18] suffered with him and you died with him
[1:56:20] you was buried with him and now you are
[1:56:22] risen with him and manifested attributes
[1:56:25] of God setting in Heavenly places
[1:56:27] already raised resurrected to New Life
[1:56:31] and setting in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:56:33] Jesus he says oh that means so much
[1:56:35] nowadays
[1:56:37] because now is the time for it
[1:56:40] church that means so much to us to see
[1:56:43] ourselves positionally placed in Jesus
[1:56:47] Christ
[1:56:48] I mean let's stand together if we would
[1:56:50] the musicians could come
[1:56:52] let's be sure we're solidly here this
[1:56:54] afternoon amen that we're on a a firm
[1:56:57] foundation we're talking about speak the
[1:56:59] word but the first thing that he focuses
[1:57:01] on is what letting Christ in that
[1:57:03] relationship letting the word come in so
[1:57:05] that it can flow out in one place and
[1:57:07] that is through your life amen amen do
[1:57:10] we have that relationship
[1:57:12] do we have that relationship can we say
[1:57:14] I have a relationship with Jesus
[1:57:17] not just do I have a relationship
[1:57:18] because I believe the message or because
[1:57:20] I go to church or I pay my tithes or any
[1:57:23] of these things but do I have a REV do I
[1:57:25] have a a relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:57:27] personally can you say I've talked to
[1:57:30] him
[1:57:31] and then he talked to me because we're
[1:57:33] sitting at a fellowship table right it's
[1:57:36] not just a ladder going up and down
[1:57:37] we're not just sending emails to God but
[1:57:40] what are we doing he's sitting at a
[1:57:41] table and he's fellowshipping with us
[1:57:43] amen you want to make sure you're on
[1:57:45] Fellowship terms with Jesus amen how do
[1:57:47] you know when you're in a strong
[1:57:48] relationship
[1:57:50] when you can say anything
[1:57:52] not just when you talk about how good
[1:57:54] and great and and wonderful things are
[1:57:56] but when you can talk about what the
[1:57:57] failures the faults
[1:58:00] amen when you can repent and say you're
[1:58:01] sorry in a relationship and the other
[1:58:03] person can receive it without
[1:58:05] condemnation that's how you know you're
[1:58:07] in a strong relationship amen so often
[1:58:09] we say we're in a relationship because
[1:58:10] we're giving all the good things to God
[1:58:11] but what about the bad things
[1:58:13] amen is repentance found in our
[1:58:15] relationship yeah
[1:58:16] amen when I can go to my wife and say I
[1:58:20] messed up
[1:58:21] that's when I know that I've I've got to
[1:58:24] a place where I trust her enough to to
[1:58:26] allow myself to be vulnerable that way
[1:58:28] and where she can come back at me and
[1:58:30] say the same things to me and and share
[1:58:31] those faults and failures amen
[1:58:34] what was it that caused the first church
[1:58:35] to Fall Away
[1:58:38] he says they left their first love
[1:58:42] didn't say you never had it he says you
[1:58:44] left it
[1:58:45] what happened they let the thoughts of
[1:58:46] men they left the ideas and the
[1:58:47] leadership of men come in and so often
[1:58:50] that's our problem is we've gotten away
[1:58:51] from our first love
[1:58:53] amen we've lost the relationship and
[1:58:55] we've covered it up with message
[1:58:56] Doctrine
[1:58:57] that's not the relationship
[1:58:59] like I said last service Hattie Wright
[1:59:01] did not know all about the Seven Seals
[1:59:03] and spoken word and third pull but yet
[1:59:05] she reached God in a way that most of us
[1:59:06] probably never have
[1:59:08] amen amen what is it it's relationship
[1:59:10] it's a closeness with him so that what
[1:59:12] the life inside of you has come to life
[1:59:15] that the egg has been quickened amen
[1:59:17] that that life is Flowing out of you
[1:59:19] amen
[1:59:20] maybe we've just gotten away from time
[1:59:21] with him
[1:59:23] right man we've got to talk we've got to
[1:59:26] talk to him can't just read the word you
[1:59:28] got to pray you got to have a
[1:59:29] conversation with them amen he's at the
[1:59:31] table if you've let him into your life
[1:59:33] he's at the table can you imagine if I
[1:59:35] could set a table here in a visible
[1:59:37] Jesus Christ was right there how I
[1:59:39] wouldn't be able to hold you back would
[1:59:41] I
[1:59:43] be it there's a table set for you every
[1:59:44] single day
[1:59:45] if you've let him in he's just waiting
[1:59:47] he's just waiting at the table for you
[1:59:49] to sit down and talk to him amen
[1:59:51] and then come back to our first love
[1:59:53] right amen if that's what they lost and
[1:59:55] that was the alpha church then what does
[1:59:56] the Omega Church have to do its
[1:59:58] restoration must go completely back
[1:59:59] through that tight relationship with
[2:00:01] Jesus Christ amen what does that word
[2:00:03] restore what do we have a restoring
[2:00:05] message for
[2:00:06] is to restore us back to the
[2:00:07] relationship
[2:00:08] it's not just uh the doctrines are just
[2:00:11] the structure that's just to keep us
[2:00:13] from misplacing our feet yeah right it's
[2:00:15] to keep us on the right path but it's to
[2:00:17] restore us back to fellowship with God
[2:00:18] so that now he has an intimacy with us
[2:00:20] where he can trust us with his word
[2:00:22] completely
[2:00:23] amen let's just bow our heads together
[2:00:26] Heavenly Father we're so thankful for
[2:00:28] your goodness to us for your presence
[2:00:29] and the service today Lord
[2:00:31] Lord from the start even to now Lord we
[2:00:33] are so appreciative of it
[2:00:35] Lord I believe I can say with certainty
[2:00:37] that there's a table set here

[2:00:47] daughter

[2:00:53] fears our hurts our offenses Lord even
[2:00:56] the very things that cause us shame

[2:25:37] Hallelujah foreign
[2:25:45] service line
[2:25:57] I'm reminded where your Prophet says
[2:26:00] Lord
[2:26:03] when you recognize that this message is
[2:26:05] Eagle food
[2:26:08] you've heard from your theophany
[2:26:14] Lord I can say father God personally
[2:26:17] Lord that I heard
[2:26:20] from my theophany this morning Lord
[2:26:23] from that place of perfection Lord
[2:26:27] calling me to perfection
[2:26:30] [Music]
[2:26:31] as your Prophet says Lord
[2:26:36] [Music]
[2:26:38] John was on the Earth
[2:26:40] [Music]
[2:26:42] but when you said come up higher
[2:26:48] [Music]
[2:26:49] but he was left on the Earth but his
[2:26:51] Spirit was in the throne room
[2:26:55] Lord God
[2:26:56] our bodies were sitting here father
[2:27:00] but Lord God that voice Lord
[2:27:04] by the sermon of this morning Lord
[2:27:07] call us father God to Heavenly places
[2:27:10] Lord
[2:27:11] just like the cold brother John who read
[2:27:14] Lord
[2:27:15] it means so much now
[2:27:22] Lord God I could almost father God
[2:27:26] turn around and see my body father God
[2:27:29] Seated on the bench Lord
[2:27:32] you lifted our Spirits father God
[2:27:37] into that Throne Room Lord
[2:27:42] where the lamb had the book father
[2:27:46] and you opened it up Lord
[2:27:48] foreign
[2:27:54] we saw our names
[2:27:57] like your Prophet says Lord
[2:28:00] when the book was open
[2:28:04] John saw John
[2:28:09] and he rejoiced
[2:28:12] he might have been happy when he saw
[2:28:14] Elijah
[2:28:15] he might have been happy when he saw
[2:28:18] Moses
[2:28:20] but when the Bible says all Heaven and
[2:28:24] Earth
[2:28:24] heard him shout hallelujah glory honor
[2:28:29] everything beneath the Earth in heaven
[2:28:34] it was when John saw himself
[2:28:37] [Music]
[2:28:40] I just love what brother John said Lord
[2:28:44] The Voice Lord was to open the door
[2:28:49] not for brother Branham to step in
[2:28:53] it was for you to step in not
[2:28:58] and I can say Lord you stepped into my
[2:29:00] heart
[2:29:03] like brother John say it's not the
[2:29:05] restoration of Doctrine per se
[2:29:08] that's just a path
[2:29:12] but Lord God
