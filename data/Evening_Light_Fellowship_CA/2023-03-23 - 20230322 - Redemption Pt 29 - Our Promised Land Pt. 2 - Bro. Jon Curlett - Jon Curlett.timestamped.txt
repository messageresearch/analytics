[45:54] as we've sung it Lord may it be a prayer
[45:57] that's on our lips Lord and just coming

[46:15] Lord that we would follow the leading of
[46:17] your Holy Spirit Lord God Lord that we

[46:22] out we ask heavenly father and Lord even
[46:24] as we're gathered here tonight Lord may
[46:26] we take one step closer to glory Lord
[46:28] one step closer to Eternity one close
[46:31] one step closer Lord to a life spent
[46:33] only with you where nothing can touch us
[46:35] ever more Heavenly Father Lord encourage
[46:38] your people tonight we pray Lord correct
[46:40] us where we need it Lord forgive us
[46:42] where we fall short Lord and just touch
[46:44] us we pray in Jesus Christ's name we're
[46:47] asking it amen amen God bless you if you
[46:50] would turn in your scriptures to Joel 2.
[46:53] amen thank you musicians
[46:55] it's uh
[46:57] it's always a pleasure to sit there and
[46:58] listen to the song service and I have to
[47:00] say I do enjoy it where I don't have a
[47:02] bass amp six inches from my head the way
[47:05] we used to you know I can enjoy it in
[47:06] its fullness not in its you know that
[47:09] that suddenness of of them sitting on
[47:10] the other side of the wall while you're
[47:12] trying to prepare for service so I
[47:14] always enjoy it's good to have brother
[47:15] Paul back with us and he wasn't feeling
[47:17] well brother David's back and he wasn't
[47:19] feeling well and different ones so
[47:21] welcome them back good to have brother
[47:23] Josh and sister Rochelle I've been
[47:25] enjoying the song Services you know I
[47:27] was thinking back there that we've gotta
[47:29] we've got good song leaders they have a
[47:31] blend
[47:32] it's not all old and it's not all new
[47:34] it's not all shouting and dancing songs
[47:37] it's it's a blend of those things uh
[47:39] there's a minister a message Minister
[47:41] said recently says you know we've we
[47:43] don't sing the old hymns anymore and he
[47:45] he basically said the new songs are no
[47:46] good but I believe if the holy spirit's
[47:49] here and you can have a young preacher
[47:50] preach an anointed sermon then you can
[47:52] have a new person that can write an
[47:54] anointed song and we can worship by the
[47:56] new and we can worship by the old amen
[47:58] the holy spirit's not dead we still have
[48:00] musicians we still have songwriters
[48:02] today that can that can catch the the
[48:04] influence and the leadership of the holy
[48:06] spirit for these things so I'm glad to
[48:07] have it and I enjoy listening to it it's
[48:09] probably the biggest thing I miss
[48:11] ministering as much as I have been is
[48:13] that that ability to just come in and
[48:15] just sit there and just relax and
[48:18] worship God and and it's it's different
[48:19] when you're sitting in the office of
[48:21] course but it's good to hear it I'm
[48:23] certainly glad to have brother Josh and
[48:24] sister Rachelle back amen appreciate
[48:26] your prayers for Selena she's doing much
[48:28] better I think Lord willing she will go
[48:30] to work tomorrow but we just kind of
[48:31] kept her home tonight abundance of
[48:33] caution we don't want to be passing
[48:35] covert to anyone unnecessarily we've
[48:38] mostly been staying away from her so and
[48:40] we'd spend some time with different ones
[48:41] in the church so we said it doesn't
[48:42] really make a difference if we're not
[48:43] here tonight or not so where everybody
[48:45] came so so we're here and just trusting
[48:48] the Lord to protect us each one amen
[48:50] Joel 2 28 very familiar scripture 4 says
[48:53] and it shall come to pass afterward that
[48:56] I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[48:59] and your sons and your daughters shall
[49:01] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[49:03] your young men shall see visions and
[49:06] also upon the servants and upon the
[49:08] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[49:11] my spirit amen God bless you you can
[49:13] have your seats this evening we are
[49:15] continuing with our Redemption series as
[49:17] you might imagine and I want to take a
[49:19] second part of this this idea that we
[49:21] started last service on our promised
[49:23] land and we spoke about the Covenant
[49:25] that God had made to Abraham and to his
[49:27] seed and we showed you the scripture
[49:29] that we are Abraham's seed because we
[49:31] are in Christ and we are children enough
[49:33] Faith amen we are not children of
[49:34] performance we're not children of Good
[49:36] Deeds but we are children of faith and
[49:38] we come from God and we go to God and
[49:40] we're going to kind of dig into how how
[49:41] he spoke of that even when he spoke of
[49:43] Abraham and these things and we know
[49:45] that because we are a part of that
[49:46] abrahamic line because we are the
[49:49] spiritual Seed of Abraham we have access
[49:51] to the same Covenant that Abraham did
[49:53] and and just to give a bit of a
[49:54] background here to to bring those up to
[49:56] speed that weren't here and just to kind
[49:58] of set the tone for the service this is
[50:00] this is the Covenant we read last time
[50:02] and it was what God Said to Abraham and
[50:04] he says I will establish my Covenant
[50:06] between me and thee and thy seed after
[50:09] thee in their generations for an
[50:12] Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[50:15] thee and to thy seed after thee and we
[50:17] see here that this was unconditional God
[50:20] didn't say if you're good children then
[50:21] I'll be a good dad or if you're bad
[50:23] children that I won't be a dad but he
[50:25] says I'm going to be your father to you
[50:26] I'm going to be a God to you and he
[50:28] didn't say it's dependent on anything
[50:29] that we did it was completely
[50:31] unconditional and so if you are a child
[50:33] of Abraham which means you are a child
[50:34] of Faith by the word of God then there
[50:36] is nothing you can do to change the fact
[50:38] that God is your father amen that you
[50:40] come from God and you go back to God in
[50:41] these things but I want to set up a
[50:43] contrast because so often we can get
[50:45] caught up in the Israelite Covenant and
[50:47] not the abrahamic Covenant because if we
[50:49] look in Leviticus 26 we see that God
[50:52] said this he says if you walk in my
[50:55] statutes and keep my Commandments and so
[50:56] do them then I will give you rain and
[50:59] due season and the land shall yield her
[51:01] increase in the Trees of the field shall
[51:03] yield their fruit and your threshing
[51:05] shall reach under the Vintage and the
[51:06] Vintage shall reach under the sowing
[51:08] time and you shall eat your bread to the
[51:10] full and dwell in your land safely and I
[51:12] will give you peace in the land and you
[51:14] shall lie down and none shall make you
[51:16] afraid and I will rid evil beasts out of
[51:18] the land neither shall the sword go
[51:19] through your land and he will continue
[51:21] on for the sake of time I didn't put it
[51:23] there but he says but if you don't then
[51:25] you're going to have problems with your
[51:27] Harvest you're going to have problems
[51:29] with your health you're going to lose
[51:30] your land you're going to be dressed
[51:32] given over by the different nations that
[51:34] will come in and I'll use them to
[51:36] chastise you in these different things
[51:37] and the point I'm making is that Israel
[51:39] had a performance-based covenant when it
[51:42] came to holding the land when it came to
[51:44] the possession of the land and the
[51:46] blessings that were in their land they
[51:48] had to actively choose to follow God in
[51:50] order to get the land and to hold on to
[51:52] the land because remember God brought
[51:54] them into his into Canaan land and he
[51:56] drove the occupants out of the land but
[51:58] what happened after that was completely
[52:01] dependent on the Israelites
[52:03] whether they have Victory whether they
[52:04] had wealth whether they had food in the
[52:07] in the fridge or in the cupboard whether
[52:08] everything was going well or everything
[52:10] was going to bed was completely
[52:11] dependent on their performance to the
[52:13] word of God if they were obedient or
[52:16] disobedient that determined if they
[52:17] could even hold on to the land that they
[52:19] got
[52:20] their attitude their faithfulness all
[52:22] these things were what tied them to that
[52:24] land and if it went downhill if they
[52:25] weren't according to the word of God
[52:27] then they got booted out of the land and
[52:29] they were made slaves and they they lost
[52:30] all the benefits and the blessings
[52:33] but that's not our covenant praise the
[52:35] lord it's not our covenant that it's
[52:36] dependent on our performance in these
[52:38] things amen we as Gentiles had failed
[52:41] God time and time again if we look at
[52:43] that time in the Israelites in the time
[52:45] of Canaan and even on on from there we
[52:47] weren't even a part of of God as it was
[52:49] in the children of Israel they were a
[52:51] chosen people they had the word they had
[52:53] the prophet said all these things and
[52:54] everything was focused on them and yet
[52:56] they never seemed to succeed
[52:58] and God said I'm going to use another
[53:00] people to drive you to jealousy and he
[53:02] was saying I'm going to go to the
[53:03] Gentiles by grace and I'm going to make
[53:05] a people and I'm going to make a bride
[53:07] out of them and then I'm going to come
[53:08] back and take a Remnant out of you but
[53:10] he says I can't do it with them for
[53:12] performance because they don't even know
[53:13] what they're supposed to do they don't
[53:15] even know I exist they're serving other
[53:16] gods or they're serving no Gods at all
[53:18] they're living according to the dictates
[53:19] of their own heart and they're a mess
[53:22] and we see even in this age that's where
[53:24] the Gentiles are today is we're a mess
[53:26] I don't believe as message Believers
[53:28] we're a mess but the world is a mess
[53:30] because they don't even know God
[53:32] brother brother Chad had one he had
[53:35] Jeremiah asked me a question the other
[53:37] day and he said brother John he says
[53:39] people that are in a church that believe
[53:40] the Trinity when they worship God does
[53:42] he accept it
[53:44] I said which God
[53:47] because they're worshiping three
[53:49] even if they don't recognize they're
[53:50] worshiping three they don't even know
[53:52] the god that they're worshiping so if
[53:54] they're not worshiping him in spirit and
[53:56] in truth then their worship is not
[53:57] sacrificed because the requirement of a
[53:59] Believer today is to worship Him in
[54:01] spirit and in truth and if it's not
[54:03] right then how can he accept it and if
[54:05] you don't even know the god you're
[54:06] serving then how can he accept your
[54:07] worship so we have to know these things
[54:10] and he came to us and it was by grace
[54:11] and Paul would reflect on this in
[54:13] Ephesians 2 he says wherefore remember
[54:16] that ye being in time past Gentiles In
[54:19] the Flesh who are called uncircumcision
[54:21] by that which is called the circumcision
[54:23] in the flesh made by hands he says the
[54:25] Jews called you the uncircumcised
[54:26] outside of the Covenant
[54:28] he says that at that time ye were
[54:30] without Christ being aliens from the
[54:33] Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[54:35] from the covenants of Promise having no
[54:37] hope
[54:38] no hope and without God in this world
[54:41] but now in Christ Jesus ye who are
[54:44] sometimes were far off are made nigh by
[54:47] the blood of Christ for he is our peace
[54:50] who hath made both one and hath broken
[54:52] down the middle wall of partition
[54:54] between us
[54:56] so we come all the way into the New
[54:57] Testament and Paul points back to the
[55:00] abrahamic Covenant and he ties the
[55:01] Gentiles into it and he comes up with a
[55:03] new description for it and it's called
[55:05] predestination
[55:06] because predestination is the choosing
[55:09] of God it's not the choosing of me it's
[55:11] not the choosing of you because we have
[55:13] we see it even the world today we have
[55:15] people that will reach out to God and
[55:17] nothing happens
[55:19] and then you have people that are
[55:20] walking along walking down the road and
[55:23] then God just comes in and he Taps him
[55:25] on the shoulder and he says you're a
[55:27] child of mine and I want you to know it
[55:29] and I need you to know because I've got
[55:31] to do some amazing things in your life
[55:33] and so you have to come out and you have
[55:35] to walk separate and you have to be with
[55:36] me it reminds me of brother Mark's
[55:38] testimony just sitting there reading a
[55:40] newspaper reading an ad and something
[55:42] comes out and what was it it was God
[55:44] saying you're my child and he's sitting
[55:46] there saying say what
[55:48] he probably didn't even know what was
[55:50] happening at that moment but it was God
[55:52] coming down no different than Abraham
[55:54] Church and when God steps down and he
[55:56] lets you know that you're his child it's
[55:58] no different than Abraham that's exactly
[56:01] what he's doing is he's letting you know
[56:02] I put something in you I chose you
[56:05] before you ever chose me and now I'm
[56:07] telling you about it and the fact that
[56:09] you can even recognize me and
[56:10] acknowledge me and come back to me
[56:12] proves that I chose you in the beginning
[56:13] that's the only reason you can do it
[56:16] we are children of Abraham because God
[56:18] calls us the same way and we respond the
[56:21] same way and it's by faith even though
[56:22] we had no idea what it was to be a child
[56:24] of God before that maybe
[56:26] Paul would say this in Ephesians 1 he
[56:28] says that in the dispensation of the
[56:30] fullness of time he might gather
[56:32] together in one all things in Christ
[56:35] both which are in heaven and which are
[56:37] on earth even in him notice he says
[56:39] gather together in one one place one
[56:42] body it's one Spirit we know and then we
[56:45] talked about it last service how Israel
[56:46] had one land and we have one body and
[56:49] that means we're all gathered in a place
[56:51] but each of us has our place within that
[56:54] place each of us has a portion within
[56:56] that portion each of us has a a position
[56:59] or a purpose within that body if I could
[57:01] put it that way so theirs was a natural
[57:03] land ours is a spiritual land and it's
[57:05] the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[57:07] brother Brandon will call it it's the
[57:08] bride of Christ he says in whom also we
[57:11] have obtained an inheritance being
[57:13] predestinated according to the purpose
[57:16] of who
[57:17] of him that worketh who worketh all
[57:20] things after the counsel of his own will
[57:22] so here we see what it means to have an
[57:25] unconditional Covenant and he calls it
[57:26] predestination here it's the choosing of
[57:29] God beforehand and Paul says he did it
[57:31] by his purpose and by his will
[57:34] it's not by our influence it's nothing
[57:36] we could say or do even now it's nothing
[57:38] we did back then but we cannot influence
[57:41] the choosing of God it's a done deal
[57:43] when he's done it and then we just have
[57:45] to step into it amen it's been done
[57:47] since before the foundation of the world
[57:49] he says why that we should be to the
[57:51] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[57:54] Christ that's one thing about an
[57:55] unconditional Covenant is that you don't
[57:57] get any Glory out of it because it's not
[57:59] reflecting you it's reflecting the one
[58:01] that made the Covenant in the first
[58:02] place but I want you to realize that
[58:04] this predestination word doesn't just
[58:07] reflect the choosing of God but it
[58:09] reflects the idea that there is a will
[58:11] of God and there is a purpose of God
[58:12] behind the choosing because otherwise we
[58:15] just stop at justification say he chose
[58:17] me and I'm accepting the finished work
[58:19] of Calvary and we'd stop there but the
[58:20] reason we're speaking on Redemption is
[58:22] to take us to the idea that he has
[58:24] called us for a purpose
[58:26] and it's a purpose of his will and it's
[58:28] a purpose of his making and so that
[58:30] means that each and every one of our
[58:32] Lives is specifically built to bring us
[58:35] to what we need to be
[58:36] we talk about the master Potter and
[58:39] being submitted to the master Potter's
[58:41] hand in everything that we do in life is
[58:43] God working to bring us to that portion
[58:45] of the word that we're supposed to
[58:47] reflect and it's the literal attributes
[58:49] of God that he's placed inside of you
[58:51] that are supposed to be brought out in
[58:53] each and every one of us and it's
[58:54] already determined and like I said
[58:56] before the only question is will you go
[58:57] easy or will you go hard
[58:59] that's the only part you play is will
[59:01] you surrender and submit and relax and
[59:04] just say Lord you've got me and I'm
[59:06] going to trust you or will you fight and
[59:08] hold and struggle onto things all your
[59:09] life
[59:10] listen you're going to let go eventually
[59:12] because it'll hurt too much to hold on
[59:14] because you keep messing things up
[59:16] we keep not you
[59:19] we keep think messing things up I I I
[59:21] sometimes I do I say you but I'm
[59:23] preaching to the collective you we're
[59:24] all we're all there I'm sitting in there
[59:26] with you amen Ephesians 5 Paul would say
[59:28] this he said husbands love your wives
[59:31] even as Christ also loved the church
[59:34] past tense done deal
[59:36] he says the church and gave himself for
[59:38] it that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[59:40] with the washing of Water by the word
[59:42] that's something that he was going to do
[59:43] before he after he loved her there's a
[59:46] he loves her and then he does something
[59:47] with it and then it says that he might
[59:49] future tense presented to himself a
[59:53] glorious church not having spot or
[59:55] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[59:58] should be holy and without blemish so in
[1:00:00] other words he loved you past tense and
[1:00:02] then he said in motion all the events
[1:00:04] that are going to take place and all the
[1:00:06] things and all the remedies and all the
[1:00:08] solutions to make you what he wants you
[1:00:10] to be
[1:00:11] that's the unconditional Covenant of God
[1:00:14] Paul would say this in Ephesians 2 for
[1:00:17] by grace are you saved through faith and
[1:00:19] that not of yourselves it is the gift of
[1:00:21] God the Salvation is a gift and the
[1:00:24] faith itself is a gift not of Works lest
[1:00:26] any man should boast
[1:00:29] four excuse me for we are his
[1:00:32] workmanship
[1:00:34] we are his workmanship created in Christ
[1:00:37] Jesus unto good works which God hath
[1:00:40] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:00:42] them so we have a path we have a purpose
[1:00:44] we have good works that he has ordained
[1:00:47] that he has set out for each and every
[1:00:49] one of us to do and he says you're built
[1:00:51] for that purpose and when you do that
[1:00:53] purpose you're walking perfectly before
[1:00:55] God and he doesn't see anything else all
[1:00:57] he sees is what you're doing that's
[1:00:59] according to his his predestinated plan
[1:01:01] for your life
[1:01:03] to wrap it up
[1:01:04] in first John 4 4
[1:01:07] John says ye are of God little children
[1:01:11] and have overcome them he's talking
[1:01:14] about the spirits that deny Jesus Christ
[1:01:16] he says you have overcome them because
[1:01:18] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:01:20] that is in the word I looked at that
[1:01:22] phrase there ye are of God and I said
[1:01:24] there's more to that than meets the eye
[1:01:26] and I hadn't looked into it but I just
[1:01:27] said there's got to be more there
[1:01:29] because it triggered another scripture
[1:01:30] which we'll read in a moment but I dug
[1:01:32] into it and in the commentary it said
[1:01:34] this is one of the poorest translated
[1:01:36] words in the Bible because that word of
[1:01:39] is it can mean anything and it means
[1:01:41] nothing to us
[1:01:43] but as I dug into it it said that word
[1:01:45] of means a separation from something
[1:01:48] which there has been a close connection
[1:01:53] he says so you are from something with
[1:01:57] which you had a close connection so in
[1:01:59] other words you were originally part of
[1:02:00] something and now you're not there's
[1:02:02] been a division that's occurred but he
[1:02:04] says you come out of something and he
[1:02:06] says you come out of God
[1:02:08] but then they in the commentary it says
[1:02:10] this word of has a two-layer meaning and
[1:02:12] it means you came out from but then it
[1:02:15] says you are going to
[1:02:17] so in other words he says it makes it
[1:02:20] outcome oriented when he says you are of
[1:02:22] God it means you come from something and
[1:02:25] then there's an impact that takes place
[1:02:27] in your life and it returns you back to
[1:02:29] where you came from it's restoring you
[1:02:32] back to what you were this word of
[1:02:34] littering means you are the redeemed
[1:02:37] in that little word of it means you come
[1:02:39] out of and you go too and there's
[1:02:41] something in behind it that has an
[1:02:43] impact that's pushing you it says it's
[1:02:45] outcome oriented it means you're the
[1:02:47] redeemed of God and because of that you
[1:02:49] have to go back to him
[1:02:51] origin is Destiny for the believer
[1:02:54] and that's what we're being restored
[1:02:56] back to is you've got to be restored
[1:02:58] back to your original position and John
[1:03:00] says you are from God and therefore you
[1:03:03] must go back to God that's what this
[1:03:05] means here you're taken from a source
[1:03:07] and that word means that you're being
[1:03:09] affected by that source to draw you all
[1:03:11] the way back to where you were in the
[1:03:12] beginning
[1:03:13] it's a path that's already laid out of
[1:03:15] out for you if you look at this closely
[1:03:18] and it reminded me even as I was reading
[1:03:20] that of Jesus and it says that Jesus
[1:03:22] knowing that the father had given all
[1:03:24] things into his hands and that he was
[1:03:26] come from God and went to God listen
[1:03:30] that's the exact same Revelation that we
[1:03:32] have to have is that we recognize we
[1:03:34] come from God and therefore like Christ
[1:03:36] we must go back to God there's a
[1:03:38] restoration there's a Redemption amen we
[1:03:40] are his purchased possession we are we
[1:03:43] are the bone of his bone we are the
[1:03:45] Flesh of his flesh our names are
[1:03:47] engraved in the palms of his hand and he
[1:03:49] said I won't lose any one of them and
[1:03:51] when he says you are of me that means
[1:03:53] you always will be of me and you will
[1:03:55] always be with me and you'll be a part
[1:03:57] of me and I can't lose any one of you I
[1:04:00] won't lose any one of you he declared I
[1:04:02] won't lose a single one of you amen so
[1:04:05] like I said the only problem is will we
[1:04:07] surrender will we let him have his way
[1:04:09] in our lives
[1:04:10] Romans 8 28 Paul says and we know all
[1:04:13] things work together for good to them
[1:04:15] that love God to them who are the called
[1:04:17] according to his purpose there is called
[1:04:20] and then there is thee called
[1:04:22] within the call there is the call
[1:04:24] because everybody hears the gospel and
[1:04:26] some feel a tug but some are the actual
[1:04:28] called remember the the parable of the
[1:04:31] net and they cast it out and they
[1:04:32] brought in fishes but they only chose
[1:04:34] some of the fishes all of those fishes
[1:04:36] got called but only a few were chosen
[1:04:38] they were the ones that he was looking
[1:04:39] for and the gospels the same way
[1:04:41] the thing is we don't know who that is
[1:04:43] so we treat everyone the same
[1:04:46] it says for whom he did for no past
[1:04:50] tense he also did predestinate past
[1:04:53] tense to be conformed future to the
[1:04:56] image of his son that he might be the
[1:04:58] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[1:05:00] whom he did predestinate past tense then
[1:05:03] he also called past tense and whom he
[1:05:06] called them he also Justified past tense
[1:05:08] and whom he justified them he also
[1:05:10] glorified past tense you are sitting in
[1:05:13] the sight of God in Heavenly places in
[1:05:15] Christ Jesus as if you never did it in
[1:05:17] the first place you are sinless
[1:05:19] Perfection you are glorified in his eyes
[1:05:22] right now in the presence of God because
[1:05:24] of the work that the lamb did even
[1:05:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:29] and Paul would take this and he would
[1:05:31] say then what shall we say then to these
[1:05:34] things what do we do with it
[1:05:36] what do we do with it what will we say
[1:05:38] about this he says if God before us who
[1:05:41] can be against us
[1:05:42] he that spared not his own son but
[1:05:45] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[1:05:47] not with him also freely give us all
[1:05:49] things Paul's sitting there and he's
[1:05:51] saying recognize your position
[1:05:54] recognize what he's done for you it's a
[1:05:57] finished work it's done Church you don't
[1:05:59] have to worry you can rest and trust
[1:06:02] that where you are today is where he
[1:06:04] wants you to be and as long as your
[1:06:06] conscience is clear and you're not
[1:06:07] holding him back he's going to keep
[1:06:09] moving you forward you can rest that you
[1:06:12] are literally exactly where God wants
[1:06:13] you to be in life today Paul's saying
[1:06:16] he's made a way and he's already
[1:06:18] finished the work in his mind and your
[1:06:20] name is written in a book that there's
[1:06:21] no erasing
[1:06:22] there's no erasing the names that are in
[1:06:24] the Lamb's Book of Life cannot be erased
[1:06:26] like the rest of the book
[1:06:28] that's where you sit today
[1:06:30] that's the unconditional Covenant that
[1:06:32] we're sitting under today is that it is
[1:06:33] a finished work and he has already
[1:06:35] prepared and worked out a way for you to
[1:06:37] return back to him and all we're doing
[1:06:39] is getting back to him now we're going
[1:06:41] to get back to him and all we got to do
[1:06:42] is go through the getting back to him
[1:06:44] part that's the trial of our faith every
[1:06:46] every time amen
[1:06:48] Paul says it here he says listen if
[1:06:50] God's for us who can be against us who
[1:06:53] can stop God
[1:06:54] listen we've seen it in the natural
[1:06:56] we've seen it in Egypt when they tried
[1:06:58] to stop God and in the end they were
[1:07:00] crying for mercy and then when they got
[1:07:02] caught up and decided to try again then
[1:07:03] God destroyed them all and time and time
[1:07:06] again we see what happens when this when
[1:07:09] Satan comes against the children of God
[1:07:10] and every time he is rebuffed and pushed
[1:07:12] back why because God cannot be defeated
[1:07:15] he cannot be defeated he cannot be
[1:07:17] stopped amen his word cannot return to
[1:07:19] avoid it void as the scripture says amen
[1:07:22] Paul will continue in Romans 8 and he
[1:07:24] says nay in all these things we are more
[1:07:27] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:07:30] us he says for I am persuaded that
[1:07:33] neither death nor life nor angels nor
[1:07:36] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:07:38] present nor things to come
[1:07:41] what does that mean Church don't worry
[1:07:42] about what's happening today
[1:07:44] don't let that get you down and then
[1:07:46] don't borrow trouble from tomorrow
[1:07:48] either because sufficient to the day is
[1:07:50] the evil thereof but don't get worried
[1:07:52] about it don't borrow that trouble amen
[1:07:54] Paul says listen nothing that's going on
[1:07:56] nothing that's going to happen can
[1:07:58] separate us from the love of God he says
[1:08:01] nor height so when it's taller than you
[1:08:03] when it's bigger than you don't worry
[1:08:06] nor death
[1:08:07] when it's too deep and you can't go
[1:08:09] under it when it's too tall you can't go
[1:08:11] over it or go around it he says don't
[1:08:13] worry he says nor any other creature
[1:08:15] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:08:17] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:08:19] lord
[1:08:20] listen church he has decided that you're
[1:08:22] going to return to him and nothing in
[1:08:25] this world will stop it
[1:08:27] that's the unconditional Covenant it's
[1:08:29] not based on performance it's based on
[1:08:32] his promise amen
[1:08:34] I want to go back to that that was the
[1:08:37] warm-up
[1:08:39] that was the warm-up hey man now we're
[1:08:40] going to jump back to what we've read
[1:08:42] about in in the last in the last service
[1:08:44] if you'd hit that next slide please
[1:08:45] Genesis 15 1. it says after these things
[1:08:48] the Lord the word of the Lord came to
[1:08:51] Abraham in a vision saying fear not
[1:08:53] Abram I am thy shield and I exceeding
[1:08:56] great reward amen I want to drive it
[1:08:59] deep again that this is not a
[1:09:01] performance-based walk it is a
[1:09:04] promise-based walk and it is his promise
[1:09:06] that we are resting on Amen we're not
[1:09:09] where we are and doing what we're doing
[1:09:10] because we've done such a good job
[1:09:13] it's because he's done a work in us and
[1:09:15] that's why we're able to stand and
[1:09:17] that's why we're able to hold firm and
[1:09:19] that's why we're able to to hold hold
[1:09:21] steady when the enemy comes in like a
[1:09:22] like a flood in these different things I
[1:09:25] was reading it or listening in adoption
[1:09:27] this morning where brother Branham says
[1:09:28] that that in the in the beginning he
[1:09:30] called himself Elohim the self-existing
[1:09:33] one he says but as soon as he what
[1:09:36] created Adam he changed his name to
[1:09:38] Jehovah and he said that means god with
[1:09:40] his family
[1:09:42] and that's how he identifies himself
[1:09:44] moving forward god with his family and
[1:09:46] he says all he's trying to do is get us
[1:09:48] back to Reign and Rule with him God with
[1:09:51] his family again that's what this whole
[1:09:53] Redemption story his very title his very
[1:09:55] name reflects the fact that we are a
[1:09:57] part of him amen
[1:09:59] but we are where we are like I said it's
[1:10:01] not performance it's promised we are
[1:10:03] where we are because God has stooped and
[1:10:06] he has wooed and he has called and he
[1:10:08] has pulled and he has waited and he has
[1:10:10] been patient with us so that we would
[1:10:12] respond and come back to him
[1:10:13] like I've said many times if you feel
[1:10:15] far away from God it's not because he's
[1:10:17] left you it's because you left him and
[1:10:18] all you have to do is come back to where
[1:10:20] you left him and he's waiting there
[1:10:21] patiently just waiting for you to come
[1:10:24] back
[1:10:26] second Timothy 2 13 this is maybe one of
[1:10:28] my favorite scriptures he says if we
[1:10:30] believe not yet he abideth faithful he
[1:10:34] cannot deny himself
[1:10:37] you say does he forgive me every time
[1:10:39] brother John all I know is that Timothy
[1:10:41] said Paul said to Timothy he cannot deny
[1:10:44] himself
[1:10:45] brother Brian said he was talking about
[1:10:47] Abraham and he says listen Abraham goes
[1:10:49] down to Gerard and he lies to the king
[1:10:52] and he gets himself in trouble because
[1:10:54] the king takes Sarah and he says God
[1:10:56] goes to that King and says you're a dead
[1:10:58] man
[1:10:59] Abraham did wrong Abraham lied Abraham
[1:11:02] deceived and then and brother Brown says
[1:11:04] God goes and tells that righteous man
[1:11:06] you're a dead man and he says Lord what
[1:11:08] did I do
[1:11:09] what did I do he says you took the wife
[1:11:11] of my prophet he said I didn't even know
[1:11:13] he says it doesn't matter that's the
[1:11:15] wife of my Prophet you can't touch her
[1:11:16] he says restore her back to him and go
[1:11:19] and have him pray for you and I'll be
[1:11:20] okay and I'll let you go but then he
[1:11:23] says but what happened to Abraham he
[1:11:25] says did God let him get away with it he
[1:11:26] says no Abraham had to repent
[1:11:29] that's what we're required to do is
[1:11:31] repent we don't just walk through life
[1:11:32] happy-go-lucky and doing this and doing
[1:11:34] that and doing that and then God just
[1:11:35] lets it slide he makes us repent and
[1:11:38] guess what he makes us repent
[1:11:40] he makes us sorry we did it he lets us
[1:11:42] know that this is not something you want
[1:11:44] to do again and how does he do it by
[1:11:46] chastisement sometimes we repent
[1:11:48] immediately sometimes he's got to let
[1:11:49] the effects hit us a bit and then we
[1:11:51] start to say whoa I'm really sorry I did
[1:11:53] that but one way or another he's not
[1:11:55] going to let us away with it amen
[1:11:56] remember his children he's going to
[1:11:58] bring us back to him
[1:12:00] but right after we read that scripture
[1:12:01] remember in Genesis 15 where he says I
[1:12:04] am thy exceeding great reward and
[1:12:06] Abraham right after that says he bows
[1:12:08] down to God and he says God thanks
[1:12:10] but how can you prove it to me he says
[1:12:13] I've been walking this yeah I'm reading
[1:12:15] between lines he's like I've been going
[1:12:17] for years and years decades Lord and
[1:12:19] nothing's happened and he says Lord
[1:12:21] would you give me proof that you're
[1:12:23] going to do what you said you were going
[1:12:24] to do
[1:12:25] and instead of reading the scriptures
[1:12:27] the scriptures are brief I want to read
[1:12:28] and this is a lengthy set of quotes but
[1:12:30] brother Branham goes into it and he digs
[1:12:32] into it beautifully and so I want to
[1:12:34] read his words rather than try and say
[1:12:35] it myself
[1:12:36] I was looking for a picture just for the
[1:12:38] the Covenant that that happens with the
[1:12:40] sacrifices and I I ran across this guy
[1:12:42] online and he was trying to explain this
[1:12:44] and I say this to let you know we ought
[1:12:46] to be happy we have a prophet to explain
[1:12:47] these things because this man went into
[1:12:49] this and this talks about there's a
[1:12:51] bullock that gets cut in half and
[1:12:53] there's a ram that's cut in half and
[1:12:54] these different things and this guy came
[1:12:55] out of it and he said this is a
[1:12:57] representation of Islam and and Judaism
[1:13:00] and and and the five uh animals that
[1:13:03] were killed represent the mother the
[1:13:04] Father the Son the daughter and the and
[1:13:06] like he came up with this big
[1:13:07] conglomeration of what this was and it
[1:13:09] made no sense whatsoever
[1:13:11] listen if you go into your King James
[1:13:13] version they'll usually point you pretty
[1:13:15] straight if you have a uh a Bible like
[1:13:18] I've got you know most of it the
[1:13:19] Scofield Edition is pretty good on these
[1:13:21] things but brother Branham digs into it
[1:13:22] so much deeper because he's looking as a
[1:13:25] prophet back to what Beyond Time
[1:13:28] he's looking Beyond in the beginning is
[1:13:30] really what we're seeing here okay so
[1:13:32] we're going to talk about this is God's
[1:13:34] proof to Abraham of his Covenant and
[1:13:37] that he was going to do what he promised
[1:13:39] it says then years past Abraham and
[1:13:41] Sarah still believing that they were
[1:13:43] going to have a baby why God said so
[1:13:47] God said I have saved you Abraham and
[1:13:49] I've saved your seed after you not only
[1:13:50] Abraham but Abraham's seed also he says
[1:13:53] now I want you to know what Abraham's
[1:13:55] seed is Abraham's seed is not seeds it's
[1:13:58] the Seed of Abraham which come through
[1:14:00] Isaac and Isaac to Christ he says am we
[1:14:03] Hallelujah being dead in Christ take on
[1:14:06] Abraham's seed and our heirs according
[1:14:08] to the promise how is the Covenant given
[1:14:10] it's unconditional everyone that God
[1:14:13] calls chooses elects that person has the
[1:14:17] same promise that Abraham had Amen
[1:14:19] brother if that doesn't shake the
[1:14:21] stalactites in the devil's eyes I don't
[1:14:23] know what does your Abraham seed not
[1:14:25] what you've done what God has done past
[1:14:28] tense for you you're in Abraham he says
[1:14:31] seed singular
[1:14:33] he says now Abraham wanted to know a
[1:14:35] confirmation that God would keep this he
[1:14:38] says oh I want you to notice it's so
[1:14:39] lovely so beautiful he said how will I
[1:14:42] know these things Lord see then I'm old
[1:14:43] nearly a hundred years old now how am I
[1:14:46] going to know that you're going to keep
[1:14:47] this with me how do I know this Covenant
[1:14:50] is going to be kept here's what he said
[1:14:52] listen now he said come out here Abraham
[1:14:54] I'm going to show you what I'm going to
[1:14:56] do
[1:14:57] listen we're looking for a resurrection
[1:14:59] and a Rapture aren't we
[1:15:00] we're looking for an outpouring of the
[1:15:02] Dynamics to make the mechanics live
[1:15:04] beyond what we've had to date
[1:15:06] I want you to read because this isn't
[1:15:07] just for Abraham this is for us now
[1:15:10] he says and Abraham took a heifer of
[1:15:12] three years old he took a goat of three
[1:15:14] years old he took a ram of three years
[1:15:15] old and he split them in half and laid
[1:15:18] them out on the bank
[1:15:19] and then he took a turtle dove and a
[1:15:21] pigeon and he didn't separate those why
[1:15:24] didn't he separate those he says I wish
[1:15:26] I had time to go in and show you how law
[1:15:28] and grace are different and so forth but
[1:15:30] when it comes to the turtle doves or
[1:15:31] pigeon he says any Bible reader knows
[1:15:34] that that was the cleansing for healing
[1:15:36] not the guy that I was reading online
[1:15:37] apparently but he says you don't he says
[1:15:40] there was a healing which in these
[1:15:41] covenants here are separated he says but
[1:15:43] Divine Healing has always been in every
[1:15:47] Covenant and every time they're
[1:15:49] unseparated they're laid in there the
[1:15:51] Pigeon in the turtle dovey says they
[1:15:52] never lost the promise for Divine
[1:15:54] Healing the Abraham doesn't lose it
[1:15:55] either
[1:15:57] he said these other laws and Grace and
[1:15:59] so forth was divided but this turtle
[1:16:01] dove and pigeon was not divided they
[1:16:03] were laid in whole he says notice I want
[1:16:06] you to get this notice that at that time
[1:16:08] God said Abraham I'm going to show you
[1:16:10] how I'm going to do this and he swore by
[1:16:13] it swore that he would do it then watch
[1:16:15] what he did he went out there and he put
[1:16:18] him to sleep
[1:16:21] and Abraham watched the birds first so
[1:16:23] what happened is Abraham came out and
[1:16:25] there was they he cut the animals he
[1:16:27] split them open
[1:16:28] and we'll understand why in a minute and
[1:16:30] then the birds came down because God
[1:16:31] didn't come down and do anything the
[1:16:33] birds came down and they were getting on
[1:16:35] the sacrifice and so Abraham was beating
[1:16:37] off all these Birds because they were
[1:16:38] going to eat the sacrifice
[1:16:40] he says Abraham watch The Birds first
[1:16:42] off the sacrifices until the sun went
[1:16:44] down he drove him off to sacrifice them
[1:16:46] when the sun went down brother Brown
[1:16:48] says now watch God telling Abraham now
[1:16:51] I'm going to show you Abraham that you
[1:16:53] or your seat after you hasn't got one
[1:16:56] thing to do with this I my I'm doing
[1:16:59] this myself by election he says
[1:17:03] hallelujah oh my get it Pentecostal
[1:17:05] people here's the foundation of Grace
[1:17:08] here's the foundation of faith and why
[1:17:10] we can have faith an unmistakable faith
[1:17:13] in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:15] watch close now where when he come down
[1:17:17] the Holy Spirit to talk to Abraham in
[1:17:19] the garden out there where he was laying
[1:17:21] on the hill he put Abraham to sleep and
[1:17:23] said now Abraham you haven't got one
[1:17:25] thing to do all right you lay here now
[1:17:28] and Abraham went to sleep brother
[1:17:30] Branham says you're out of the picture
[1:17:34] and the next thing he says what's God
[1:17:36] going to do he's confirming and giving
[1:17:39] an Evidence he's giving an Evidence or a
[1:17:41] proof to Abraham how he's going to do
[1:17:43] this amen how he's going to do it listen
[1:17:46] he says if you want to be healed how
[1:17:48] he's going to do this how he's going to
[1:17:49] heal you he says then Abraham I'm
[1:17:52] shutting you out of the picture I'm
[1:17:54] putting you to sleep
[1:17:56] then before Abraham come a thickness
[1:17:59] afterwards so before Abraham woke up
[1:18:01] there came a black thickness after he
[1:18:03] says every sinner deserves to go to hell
[1:18:06] Blackness then after that a smoking
[1:18:08] burning furnace he says every sinner
[1:18:11] deserving Abraham that's what you
[1:18:13] deserve
[1:18:14] but beyond that went to little white
[1:18:16] light that little white light went right
[1:18:18] between those pieces of sacrifice right
[1:18:21] back and forth the white light moving
[1:18:23] showing making a confirmation showing to
[1:18:26] Abraham that he would do someday through
[1:18:28] his seed Isaac bringing on Christ for
[1:18:31] the Supreme sacrifice
[1:18:33] he says now a covenant has always been a
[1:18:36] strange thing in the Eastern orients
[1:18:38] during this time when they made a
[1:18:39] covenant they went and killed a beast
[1:18:41] they split it open and they stood
[1:18:43] between this despite dead beast and they
[1:18:46] wrote out their Covenant I hereby say
[1:18:48] that a certain certain thing he says
[1:18:50] they write the agreement the Covenant
[1:18:51] the agreement then they take this
[1:18:53] agreement and they tear it to pieces one
[1:18:56] piece is given to one man and the other
[1:18:58] to the other one and when this contract
[1:19:00] he says they take an oath over this dead
[1:19:02] Beast let my body be as this dead Beast
[1:19:05] if I don't keep this Covenant
[1:19:07] but remember who was standing in between
[1:19:09] the beasts was Abraham standing there
[1:19:12] no
[1:19:14] so Abraham's not making the Covenant
[1:19:16] there's only one thing standing in the
[1:19:18] middle and it's a white light it's God
[1:19:20] walking back and forth between it
[1:19:23] he says watch God was then in spirit how
[1:19:26] could God be tore apart God wasn't in
[1:19:28] flesh so you couldn't tear his body
[1:19:29] apart
[1:19:30] he says how could God be tore apart but
[1:19:33] one day God was made flesh and dwelt
[1:19:35] Among Us the Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:19:37] Emmanuel and then there at Calvary the
[1:19:40] Covenant God wrote with us he took the
[1:19:42] Christ to Calvary and tore him apart
[1:19:44] body and soul and body and he took his
[1:19:47] body up to set it at the right hand of
[1:19:49] his majesty and sent the spirit back
[1:19:51] here on Earth to make a covenant to
[1:19:54] carry out the gospel
[1:19:56] and the same dovetail power that Jesus
[1:19:59] Christ had he's the same yesterday today
[1:20:02] and forever he says and the church is
[1:20:05] given a covenant and the Covenant is the
[1:20:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the
[1:20:11] Seed of Abraham
[1:20:14] Joel 2 28 he says I'll pour out all my
[1:20:16] spirit upon them and he says the Holy
[1:20:18] Ghost which is the Seed of Abraham what
[1:20:21] is the Seed of Abraham he says in all
[1:20:23] thy seed the Earth shall be blessed he
[1:20:25] says it's through Isaac pointing to who
[1:20:27] Christ he says Christ is the literal
[1:20:30] Seed of Abraham that's where the
[1:20:32] blessing comes forth and he says then
[1:20:34] you're going to be a part of that Christ
[1:20:35] then amen
[1:20:37] he says which is the Seed of Abraham the
[1:20:39] Holy Ghost is the Seed of Abraham will
[1:20:41] bring him to us and then God making this
[1:20:44] Covenant that every man that's called
[1:20:46] into the grace of God by the Holy Ghost
[1:20:48] has the same promise that Abraham had of
[1:20:51] eternal life
[1:20:52] he says now you can't have a piece of
[1:20:54] paper that just impersonates it you
[1:20:57] can't drop some contract and tear it
[1:20:58] apart and says I've got eternal life
[1:21:00] that's what he's saying you can't make
[1:21:01] up your own way to eternal life
[1:21:05] he says you can't have a piece of paper
[1:21:07] that just makes something like it it's
[1:21:09] got to be the same piece of paper and
[1:21:12] the same spirit that was on Jesus Christ
[1:21:14] has come back on his church doing the
[1:21:16] same signs the same wonders the same
[1:21:18] Holy Ghost the same power it's the
[1:21:21] Covenant that God give to them
[1:21:24] he says and Jesus died there in the
[1:21:27] evening time when the sun was going down
[1:21:28] confirming this Covenant and the Holy
[1:21:31] Ghost is on the church tonight leading
[1:21:33] the church just like he was here when he
[1:21:35] was leading Christ the same way the same
[1:21:38] Ministry Christ had in his church
[1:21:40] tonight is in his church tonight the
[1:21:43] same signs the same wonders The Same
[1:21:45] Spirit the same kind of works that Jesus
[1:21:48] did here on Earth the church has to do
[1:21:50] the same thing has to do it he says if
[1:21:53] it's not it's not the Seed of Abraham
[1:21:56] it's not the Church of Jesus Christ it
[1:21:59] can't be
[1:22:00] that's why I say we need Dynamics poured
[1:22:02] out on the mechanics
[1:22:04] and brother Brahm said that's what has
[1:22:05] to follow and we saw it as a wave
[1:22:07] offering as a chief offering in brother
[1:22:10] branham's Ministry and that same
[1:22:11] anointing is on the bride to bring her
[1:22:13] to that same place and it won't be
[1:22:15] manifested in one man the way it was but
[1:22:17] it'll be manifested across the body and
[1:22:19] I believe that's how it won't be a
[1:22:20] public show
[1:22:22] because it won't be all in one man it'll
[1:22:24] be spread out over hundreds thousands
[1:22:26] who knows how many are there and it'll
[1:22:27] just be a little one here and a little
[1:22:28] one there and something that happens in
[1:22:30] your prayer closet and something happens
[1:22:31] in a little church in on the east coast
[1:22:34] of Canada something that happens on a
[1:22:36] church in the middle of nowhere and
[1:22:37] nobody knows about it except the ones
[1:22:39] that are there it's not a public show
[1:22:41] but the Dynamics have to be there
[1:22:43] brother Brown says otherwise it's not
[1:22:44] Christ
[1:22:45] we've got further to go Church
[1:22:47] we've got a growth that has to happen
[1:22:49] we've got a maturity that has to come to
[1:22:51] us and it'll be his working not ours
[1:22:53] he says Pentecostal people he's not
[1:22:55] talking to Pentecostals he's talking to
[1:22:57] Pentecostals the real Pentecostals the
[1:22:59] original Pentecostals he says
[1:23:01] Pentecostal people do you see that
[1:23:02] that's you these others can't believe in
[1:23:05] that there's nothing in them to believe
[1:23:07] with but the trouble of it is you've got
[1:23:09] it and you don't know it
[1:23:12] he says if the devil if you can get it
[1:23:14] and he can hide it from you and not let
[1:23:16] you know you've got it he's got you
[1:23:18] licked see you can't fall there's no way
[1:23:22] of failing sorry that you can't fail
[1:23:24] there's no way of failing he says you're
[1:23:26] Abraham's seed God has sworn with an
[1:23:29] oath that he take you in amen there you
[1:23:31] are he's made his Covenant Hallelujah
[1:23:34] that's how we're getting in church is
[1:23:36] because he said we're going to make it
[1:23:39] that's the only way we're going to make
[1:23:40] it he says Jesus Christ is his Covenant
[1:23:44] and he tore him apart at Calvary
[1:23:46] received the body up and sent the Holy
[1:23:48] Ghost back and when the Resurrection
[1:23:50] comes the same spirit that was in Jesus
[1:23:52] Christ is the only thing that will raise
[1:23:55] this body up to go meet that one there
[1:23:57] he says that makes them husband and wife
[1:24:00] you see what I mean the bride is the
[1:24:02] Covenant people unconditionally God
[1:24:05] called you out of the world gave you the
[1:24:07] Holy Ghost the Seed of Abraham you are
[1:24:10] tonight with a blessed promise he says
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:13] then he says if you're Abraham's seed
[1:24:16] you have this promise in you you believe
[1:24:19] God regardless of what takes place he
[1:24:21] says the Holy Ghost makes you believe it
[1:24:23] anyhow
[1:24:25] we hope without hope
[1:24:28] We Believe without sin and it seems so
[1:24:31] foolish it seems so so so silly so many
[1:24:34] times because nothing seems to be
[1:24:36] happening but yet that is the
[1:24:38] characteristic of the Believers that
[1:24:39] they believe and they believe and they
[1:24:42] believe and they're looking and
[1:24:43] expecting for the things of God in their
[1:24:45] life amen that's what we're held to will
[1:24:48] you believe if thou can'tst believe all
[1:24:50] things are possible that's why we sing
[1:24:52] only believe brother Brown says the
[1:24:53] angel of the lord loves that song more
[1:24:54] than any other song because that's what
[1:24:56] our message is believe believe what's
[1:24:59] coming your way and God will do it in
[1:25:01] your midst
[1:25:04] he says then if you're Abraham's seed
[1:25:06] you have this promise in you you believe
[1:25:08] God regardless of what takes place the
[1:25:11] Holy Ghost makes you believe it anyhow
[1:25:13] that's why you've got to have the Holy
[1:25:14] Ghost Church because you won't believe
[1:25:16] it you won't hold
[1:25:17] you won't stay steady in the times of
[1:25:19] trial and decisions and difficult times
[1:25:22] if you don't have the Holy Ghost that's
[1:25:23] the only thing that's holding me we sing
[1:25:25] that song something keeps holding me
[1:25:27] it's the predestination of God that
[1:25:29] holds us but it's the power of the holy
[1:25:31] spirit that keeps us standing firm to
[1:25:33] the word of God in our day-to-day lives
[1:25:35] he says see the spirit that was upon
[1:25:37] Christ is upon the church because
[1:25:39] there's the bride and the groom and he
[1:25:41] took the spirit and said a little while
[1:25:43] and the world seeth me no more yet
[1:25:45] you'll see me for I'll be with you even
[1:25:47] in you to the end of the world he says
[1:25:50] the spirit and the body is taken up
[1:25:52] that's what his Covenant was that's what
[1:25:55] it meant to take those animals and
[1:25:56] separate them and God walking in the
[1:25:58] midst he says you're going to be you're
[1:26:00] not even going to have anything to do
[1:26:01] with it you're just going to be sitting
[1:26:03] there and I'm going to do it now that
[1:26:05] doesn't mean we don't have a part to
[1:26:06] play but what he's saying is that your
[1:26:08] righteousness is not based on your
[1:26:10] actions it's based on me saying that
[1:26:12] you're righteous that you're pure that
[1:26:13] you're spotless that you're holy in all
[1:26:15] of these things amen
[1:26:17] God said I'm not going to lose one of
[1:26:19] them amen and how does he do it he
[1:26:20] rebirths them
[1:26:22] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:26:24] the kingdom of God and he reverse you
[1:26:25] with a new nature that can now do the
[1:26:28] things of God and believe the things of
[1:26:29] God and expect the things of God Amen
[1:26:31] listen we come from something Eternal so
[1:26:33] he has to give us something Eternal to
[1:26:34] bring us back and that's what the holy
[1:26:36] spirit is in our lives is it's literally
[1:26:38] a portion of God's life stuck inside of
[1:26:40] you and guess what you don't need a lot
[1:26:42] of God to make it through just a little
[1:26:44] bit of God will take you through when
[1:26:45] we're talking about the Eternal
[1:26:46] omniscient unpowerful God just a little
[1:26:49] bit of God's enough to take us through
[1:26:51] amen listen we may not know now that
[1:26:53] you're a child of God you may not know
[1:26:55] it you may not but you you may not
[1:26:56] believe it you may not understand it but
[1:26:59] there's going to come a day if you're a
[1:27:00] child of God that you're going to know
[1:27:01] it and you're going to believe it and
[1:27:02] you're going to know beyond the shadow
[1:27:04] of a doubt that you are not only a child
[1:27:05] but that you have received the Holy
[1:27:07] Ghost that you have been sealed with the
[1:27:08] Holy Ghost to the day of your Redemption
[1:27:10] and that you're going in a resurrection
[1:27:11] and you're going into Rapture no matter
[1:27:13] what comes that is what we need to get
[1:27:15] to a place to is that we know that we
[1:27:16] are a child of God Amen Paul said what
[1:27:19] search out your salvation with fear and
[1:27:21] trembling
[1:27:22] that doesn't mean be fearful but it says
[1:27:24] be careful that you've got what you say
[1:27:26] you've got go and make sure be certain
[1:27:28] of God be certain of the working of God
[1:27:30] in your life so that you know that
[1:27:32] you've got the Holy Ghost and that he's
[1:27:34] working in your life so that you can
[1:27:35] expect the other things of God to take
[1:27:37] forth in your life as you're moving
[1:27:39] forward amen
[1:27:41] remember we spoke in the last service
[1:27:43] about this this circumcision and God
[1:27:46] said listen I've given you a covenant
[1:27:48] but you've got to have something in you
[1:27:49] that represents that Covenant and he
[1:27:51] said in Genesis 17 he says this is my
[1:27:54] Covenant which you shall keep between me
[1:27:56] and you and thy seed after thee every
[1:27:58] man child among you shall be circumcised
[1:28:01] and then we read that scripture where
[1:28:02] Paul says you've received a circumcision
[1:28:04] but it's not a circumcision of hands
[1:28:06] it's not a circumcision in uh that's
[1:28:09] made by by hands in your flesh but it
[1:28:11] was a it was what it was the baptism of
[1:28:13] the Holy Spirit he says you've had a
[1:28:14] working in your life that's taken away
[1:28:16] something
[1:28:17] something unnecessary and what was it it
[1:28:19] was your old nature it was your old life
[1:28:21] it was your old inclinations it was your
[1:28:23] natural heritage is what it was and he
[1:28:24] brought you back to a spiritual Heritage
[1:28:26] and something Supernatural had to change
[1:28:28] us because we're being restored to a
[1:28:30] supernatural position that's why a man
[1:28:33] can't do it that's why a church can't do
[1:28:34] it that's why a religion can't do it
[1:28:36] that's why the message itself can't do
[1:28:38] it but it has to be the person of the
[1:28:40] message stepping into your life and
[1:28:41] giving you a relationship and an
[1:28:43] experience with the person of this
[1:28:45] message
[1:28:46] amen otherwise we're no different than
[1:28:48] anybody else
[1:28:50] that's it we're a denomination without
[1:28:52] the Holy Spirit we're a denomination
[1:28:54] that's the flat truth and that goes for
[1:28:56] us individually not just as a church
[1:28:58] amen
[1:28:59] brother Brown would say this he says you
[1:29:01] are the Covenant people of God God tore
[1:29:04] Christ apart at Calvary making the
[1:29:06] Covenant and swearing by himself and he
[1:29:08] took the body up into heaven which will
[1:29:10] return someday but the spirit he gave
[1:29:12] back to lead the church the same life
[1:29:15] that was in Christ Jesus is in the
[1:29:17] church tonight by the Holy Ghost doing
[1:29:19] and acting and Performing the same
[1:29:21] things he did when he was here on Earth
[1:29:23] you'll notice with Christ he had to
[1:29:25] surrender himself first and then he did
[1:29:26] the Greater Works
[1:29:28] he had to go through the trials and the
[1:29:29] testing and then he did the Greater
[1:29:31] Works didn't he he had to pass the test
[1:29:32] with Satan he had to prove what was
[1:29:34] inside of him before he could go on and
[1:29:36] do those other things
[1:29:37] and we've got to do the same thing and
[1:29:39] the first thing the holy dose will do is
[1:29:40] he'll prove us to God and then God can
[1:29:42] use us and that's what adoption is we'll
[1:29:45] get into that in in future Services Lord
[1:29:46] willing he says you've received it
[1:29:49] you've got the Covenant it's written to
[1:29:51] you and swore by God you can't fail he
[1:29:55] says and that makes the devil mad it
[1:29:57] sure does when you realize who you are
[1:29:59] remember we said in that service that
[1:30:01] the greatest revelation we can have is
[1:30:03] who we are in Christ because that is
[1:30:05] what the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail
[1:30:06] against
[1:30:07] as the revelation of Christ because the
[1:30:09] revelation of Christ includes you
[1:30:11] you're in him so when you get a
[1:30:13] revelation of who he is and where you
[1:30:15] are in him then the Gates of Hell cannot
[1:30:16] Prevail against that brother Brahm says
[1:30:20] listen
[1:30:22] Abraham had a sign in his body and it
[1:30:25] was a sign made by hands and a man had
[1:30:27] to do it and guess what I'm sure they
[1:30:28] had mess-ups and they had slip ups and
[1:30:30] the blade slipped and and people were
[1:30:32] disfigured in these different things but
[1:30:34] I love how brother Brown digs into this
[1:30:36] this Genesis 17 and he points to the
[1:30:39] working of God and he says but when God
[1:30:41] does circumcision it's perfect and it's
[1:30:43] complete and he says the reason it is is
[1:30:46] because it's God alone doing it it's God
[1:30:49] alone doing it remember we've shared
[1:30:51] that quote before where brother Braham
[1:30:52] says you don't go to a kid and say or a
[1:30:54] young person or whatever and you say you
[1:30:56] need to come up and give your life to
[1:30:58] God because mama wants you to or daddy
[1:30:59] wants you to or or or she died praying
[1:31:02] that you would come to the Lord in these
[1:31:04] things he says you don't put that
[1:31:05] pressure you don't put that influence on
[1:31:06] them because it'll bring a false birth
[1:31:08] but if you'll just let God do it his way
[1:31:11] without touching keeping your hands off
[1:31:13] of it you'll get genuine births every
[1:31:15] time because it'll be God that's calling
[1:31:17] him and not us putting pressure on them
[1:31:18] amen and then like I said it's not
[1:31:21] because we try it's because we surrender
[1:31:23] to the Potters the master Potter's hand
[1:31:25] amen and what is he doing he's taking us
[1:31:27] he's molding us he's directing us he's
[1:31:29] bringing us through trials and life he's
[1:31:31] bringing us through situations all to
[1:31:33] squeeze out and shape us into that thing
[1:31:35] that he wants ready for his use as
[1:31:37] adopted Sons and Daughters of God for
[1:31:39] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:31:41] Amen what does that mean it's to
[1:31:43] literally be the manifested creative
[1:31:45] word of God in your age in your time
[1:31:48] according to what he said about you
[1:31:49] that's what we're going towards church
[1:31:51] it's the manifested what nature promises
[1:31:54] planned purpose of God all of them just
[1:31:56] flowing through your life on a daily
[1:31:58] basis
[1:31:59] listen I I think sometimes we think it's
[1:32:01] going to be some Grand thing
[1:32:03] and I believe there will be elements of
[1:32:05] it but when you look through the
[1:32:07] scriptures so much of it was just the
[1:32:09] day-to-day faithful walk
[1:32:12] that's it listen they didn't go around
[1:32:14] and every day have healing campaigns
[1:32:16] that wasn't an everyday thing it was an
[1:32:18] occasional thing and guess what they
[1:32:20] didn't always have euticus falling out
[1:32:22] of the window because the service went
[1:32:23] too long and them raising him from the
[1:32:25] dead and they weren't always having
[1:32:26] Peter released from jail miraculously
[1:32:29] through three squads of soldiers and
[1:32:31] closed Gates and all these different
[1:32:32] things that didn't happen all the time
[1:32:34] and we think that that's what it's going
[1:32:36] to be but what it's going to be is the
[1:32:37] overcoming humble simple Victorious
[1:32:39] Christian Life of the believer day in
[1:32:42] and day out with the works of God coming
[1:32:44] as the Holy Spirit quickens you to do
[1:32:46] them
[1:32:47] see we forget the day today because we
[1:32:49] want the supernatural forgetting that
[1:32:51] the the overcoming day-to-day is the
[1:32:53] Supernatural and if you're overcoming
[1:32:56] day to day then you'll overcome the big
[1:32:57] stuff as it steps in your way that's
[1:32:59] what we're looking for that's that's
[1:33:01] that's what I believe amen
[1:33:03] is that it doesn't always have to be a
[1:33:05] big mountain top it's just a continuous
[1:33:07] Walking with God listen the scripture
[1:33:09] says that Enoch walked with God he
[1:33:12] didn't run with God he didn't jog with
[1:33:13] God he didn't Trot with God he just
[1:33:16] walked with God and that's what's going
[1:33:18] to take us on this Earth it says brother
[1:33:20] Brown says he just kind of got to a day
[1:33:22] where he says I'd like to leave now and
[1:33:24] he just walked and God took him
[1:33:26] that simple listen if that's what
[1:33:28] happened with him that's the same thing
[1:33:30] that's going to happen to us amen we're
[1:33:31] going to walk I believe
[1:33:33] I don't know if brother Bram says that
[1:33:35] I've heard it over the pulpit but I
[1:33:36] believe it's something along the lines
[1:33:38] of that last step will be the shortest
[1:33:39] or the easiest
[1:33:41] because it'll just seem natural and I
[1:33:44] want to get into that just as we start
[1:33:45] to close here
[1:33:47] brother Branham would share this story
[1:33:49] about Sarah Abraham's wife and and I
[1:33:51] think it's fitting because I want to be
[1:33:53] what God wants me to be amen I want to
[1:33:55] be what the word says I am but I know
[1:33:57] that it's going to take a working of God
[1:33:58] in my life to take me all the way to
[1:34:00] that place amen it's going to take the
[1:34:02] supernatural I can't get there just by
[1:34:05] studying the word and by having
[1:34:06] devotions and praying that's not just
[1:34:08] what's going to do it God has to be
[1:34:10] there God has to be active in my life
[1:34:12] personally for these things to happen I
[1:34:14] need to be still and let him do the work
[1:34:15] but as we start to close I want to read
[1:34:18] these these last few quotes
[1:34:20] because we're talking about the the
[1:34:21] promise and then the the the the the
[1:34:23] actual happening of that promise he
[1:34:26] would say notice now here was Sarah she
[1:34:29] got old a little grandma and here was
[1:34:31] Abraham long white beard 100 years old
[1:34:33] the Bible said they were both
[1:34:35] well-stricken in age and the years
[1:34:37] before this Abraham fell on his face and
[1:34:40] laughed when he thought the very idea of
[1:34:42] him as an old man as old a man in his
[1:34:44] life had gone like he was to ever have a
[1:34:47] child by Sarah is that right
[1:34:51] he says now they were old both of them
[1:34:53] now we notice immediately after this
[1:34:55] when God made his Covenant or he showed
[1:34:58] to Abraham now this is not written he
[1:35:00] says in the scripture but read between
[1:35:01] the lines with me now when he showed to
[1:35:04] Abraham what he was going to do future
[1:35:06] he made a manifestation of it to the
[1:35:09] people to them present
[1:35:12] so he's preparing them for the
[1:35:14] supernatural but he does something in
[1:35:16] their midst right now to show that the
[1:35:18] supernatural was coming that the promise
[1:35:20] was coming right so they didn't have all
[1:35:23] right after God says I'm going to do it
[1:35:24] then that's when it started happening
[1:35:27] but it didn't really look like a child
[1:35:29] it looked like something else
[1:35:31] we meant they started changing so that
[1:35:33] they could have a child he's now now he
[1:35:35] told them he was going to bless them we
[1:35:37] know that God had to do something to the
[1:35:39] womb anyhow of Sarah didn't he she'd
[1:35:41] been Barren all these years nearly 100
[1:35:43] years old and was Barren in order to do
[1:35:45] something to make this he had to
[1:35:47] recreate something in that woman's womb
[1:35:49] to make it fertile is that right in
[1:35:51] order to do that he had to stimulate her
[1:35:53] heart because she couldn't go into labor
[1:35:55] like that a woman 100 years old is that
[1:35:57] right she couldn't do it all right uh he
[1:35:59] says and another thing what about the
[1:36:01] milk veins he's saying Sarah's body had
[1:36:03] lost its ability to have a child
[1:36:07] Sarah had completely lost it Sarah never
[1:36:09] had it in the first place is the biggest
[1:36:11] point I want you to catch she never had
[1:36:13] strength to conceive in the first place
[1:36:15] so for her to have a child was a miracle
[1:36:17] in it of itself but now for her to
[1:36:19] conceive at 90 years old was going to be
[1:36:21] a completely different miracle and he's
[1:36:23] looking and he's describing Sarah's
[1:36:25] condition and it is impossible to
[1:36:27] produce the promise of God
[1:36:29] and that's what we are church it's
[1:36:31] impossible for us in our flesh to
[1:36:33] produce the child to produce the promise
[1:36:35] of God but watch what God what brother
[1:36:37] Brown says here God doesn't patch up
[1:36:40] anything
[1:36:41] you get into situations you get into
[1:36:43] life you get into relationships you get
[1:36:45] into problems and you get things and
[1:36:47] they break and they're
[1:36:48] God doesn't take that and put it back
[1:36:50] together God just says I'm going to give
[1:36:52] you something new
[1:36:53] you have a new life you have a new birth
[1:36:55] he throws away the old he doesn't patch
[1:36:58] it up and he gives you something
[1:36:59] completely new and he says this is what
[1:37:01] you need
[1:37:02] he said he made Sarah a new woman he
[1:37:06] made her a young beautiful woman again
[1:37:08] and he made Abraham a young man again he
[1:37:10] just turned them back to show what he's
[1:37:13] going to do in the Rapture to us oh you
[1:37:16] say brother Branham ridiculous he says
[1:37:18] all right we'll follow them a minute we
[1:37:20] know immediately after that they took a
[1:37:21] little trip and went down to Gerard the
[1:37:24] disobedient little young people
[1:37:26] is that right he says measure it on your
[1:37:28] map it's 300 and something Miles by
[1:37:30] camel quite a trip for an old couple
[1:37:32] like that Grandma here a little stick
[1:37:34] and a little Shaw here she comes and my
[1:37:37] Abraham come along 300 and something
[1:37:38] miles down the garage is that right the
[1:37:40] Bible said they went down there he says
[1:37:43] and you know the strange thing it was
[1:37:44] after little grandma and them coming
[1:37:46] down there and great great grandpa
[1:37:48] Abraham little on white beard little
[1:37:51] grandma with this little shawl on her
[1:37:52] the king of Gerard was looking for a
[1:37:54] sweetheart and all those beautiful women
[1:37:57] down there but when he sees Sarah he
[1:37:59] says there's the one I want
[1:38:01] little grandma with a shawl over her
[1:38:04] shoulder the most beautiful thing in the
[1:38:07] world
[1:38:12] there's the one I want he says
[1:38:14] ridiculous nonsense she wasn't a little
[1:38:16] Grandma God turned her back to a young
[1:38:20] beautiful woman again that's what he's
[1:38:23] going to do to every one of you in the
[1:38:25] Rapture yes sir he says and I can see
[1:38:28] her now if you'll give the next one I
[1:38:30] can see her now the king looking all
[1:38:32] around where them pretty girls were and
[1:38:34] when he saw Sarah he said there's the
[1:38:36] one I've waited for can you imagine a
[1:38:39] little Grandpa Grandma that's the one
[1:38:41] I've waited for
[1:38:44] I'll bet she never told him her age
[1:38:47] he says no she was a pretty girl turned
[1:38:50] back to around 25 years old something
[1:38:52] like that Abraham a young sturdy man
[1:38:55] again God showed him what he told him he
[1:38:58] was going to do what the Covenant is
[1:39:00] with you he says what he done to Sarah
[1:39:03] and Abraham he's going to do to you
[1:39:05] grandmother and you grandfather the same
[1:39:08] thing so in other words God said I told
[1:39:11] you I was going to do it and now I'm
[1:39:13] doing it and I'm preparing you to
[1:39:15] express the promise in your bodies
[1:39:17] this will be a supernatural event but
[1:39:20] the Supernatural part is that you'll be
[1:39:22] able to do it in the first place
[1:39:25] after that body change after that
[1:39:27] transformation you'll be in a condition
[1:39:29] to just do what you need to do to
[1:39:33] produce a child
[1:39:36] you'll want a child
[1:39:37] you'll be able to have a child you'll be
[1:39:40] able to birth a child you'll be able to
[1:39:42] nurse a child you'll be able to bring
[1:39:44] forth the promise but the supernatural
[1:39:46] was not what her body could do it was
[1:39:49] the body change that allowed her body to
[1:39:51] do it in the first place what he did was
[1:39:53] he changed her back so that she could
[1:39:55] naturally do
[1:39:57] because of a supernatural event
[1:40:00] that's all God's doing with us church
[1:40:02] when we take the next step it will be
[1:40:05] natural because he has supernaturally
[1:40:08] changed us to make it natural
[1:40:10] that's what we're looking at
[1:40:12] because if we're going in a rapture
[1:40:15] there are going to be steps of
[1:40:16] progression
[1:40:18] and guess what each step will feel
[1:40:20] natural
[1:40:21] doesn't mean it won't be uncomfortable
[1:40:24] doesn't mean it may not have some little
[1:40:25] issues that come with it listen Sarah
[1:40:27] because she had a new body didn't mean
[1:40:29] she didn't have birth pains but she had
[1:40:31] a body that could handle it she had the
[1:40:33] muscles to do it she had a heart that
[1:40:34] was strong enough to handle the labor
[1:40:36] she had everything built into her
[1:40:38] supernaturally to produce the promise of
[1:40:41] God not only that she wanted to do it
[1:40:43] and she was able to do it and her
[1:40:45] husband was able to do it with her
[1:40:47] because of the supernatural work of God
[1:40:49] in their lives to be able to do this
[1:40:51] amen
[1:40:52] that's why I say we need the Dynamics
[1:40:55] because all of the body is there and we
[1:40:58] just need the supernatural to make it do
[1:40:59] what it's supposed to do amen
[1:41:02] God made a covenant in Joel 2 28 that he
[1:41:04] would pour out his Spirit it was a
[1:41:06] promise I was waiting for hundreds of
[1:41:07] years dormant and then they went up in
[1:41:09] an upper room for 10 days and when they
[1:41:11] came out they said this is it this is
[1:41:14] that this is what we've been waiting for
[1:41:16] what was it God did the supernatural in
[1:41:18] their midst and they came out completely
[1:41:20] changed from when they went in up in
[1:41:22] that room completely changed and then
[1:41:24] the supernatural followed automatically
[1:41:26] automatically
[1:41:28] brother Brandon would say this the
[1:41:30] church has come through justification
[1:41:31] through Luther through sanctification
[1:41:33] through the methodists and now up to the
[1:41:36] time of the promise the promise is the
[1:41:38] baptism of the spirit which is Promised
[1:41:41] all through the Old Testament and New to
[1:41:42] the promise behold us and the promise of
[1:41:45] my father upon you Peter said that on
[1:41:48] the day of Pentecost that is the promise
[1:41:50] the promised land we're talking about
[1:41:52] our Promised Land the promised land is
[1:41:55] to live in this land of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:57] that's God's promise for the church is
[1:42:00] to live in the power of the spirit
[1:42:03] it's another world he says it's another
[1:42:05] land you have to come out of the
[1:42:07] conditions that you've been in to come
[1:42:09] out to live in this promised land to
[1:42:11] receive the promise he says remember the
[1:42:13] promise you shall receive power from on
[1:42:16] high after this the Holy Ghost has come
[1:42:18] upon you and Peter said that the promise
[1:42:21] that was made all down through the
[1:42:23] testament old and new he says you find
[1:42:25] promising on up to that day of Pentecost
[1:42:28] everything was pointing to that
[1:42:31] he says and then they entered into the
[1:42:33] promise and they had it and they got it
[1:42:36] and it's been available to us ever since
[1:42:38] and we point to that part we point to
[1:42:40] that time we point to that promise and
[1:42:42] say it's still here and it's here until
[1:42:44] it takes us all the way off this Earth
[1:42:45] in a Rapture and a resurrection amen
[1:42:49] last quote he says Canaan is a type of
[1:42:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:42:53] Egypt is the world that they came out of
[1:42:55] the Wilderness is where they were
[1:42:57] Sanctified a Sanctified called out
[1:42:59] Church Canaan is where they settled down
[1:43:02] with the holy spirit it's not just
[1:43:04] enough to have it he says you got to
[1:43:06] settle down with it he says because they
[1:43:08] still have wars and if you don't believe
[1:43:10] you have wars just get the Holy Spirit
[1:43:13] once
[1:43:14] what are you doing what do you do in
[1:43:16] Canaan he says they were possessing
[1:43:19] their rights Glory they were possessing
[1:43:21] their rights and they could not possess
[1:43:23] their rights until they got into Canaan
[1:43:25] he says they didn't know nothing in the
[1:43:28] wilderness
[1:43:29] then when they come into Canaan then
[1:43:32] they have rights he says and we've got
[1:43:34] rights when you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:43:36] during Canaan you have to fight for it
[1:43:39] every inch of ground you have to fight
[1:43:41] for it yes sir and then God bless you
[1:43:44] let's Stand Together
[1:43:46] amen that leads us into the the next
[1:43:49] portion and
[1:43:51] we're going to talk about what it means
[1:43:52] to have the Holy Ghost and what it does
[1:43:55] to us and what it looks like when you're
[1:43:56] following it and the things that follow
[1:43:58] it and the things that go with it and
[1:44:00] all of these different things so
[1:44:02] certainly appreciate your prayers it's a
[1:44:04] it's a lot it's a lot I'm very busy
[1:44:06] these days and I want to be very
[1:44:08] faithful to this but just trusting that
[1:44:10] the Lord will continue to bless him and
[1:44:11] that he'll Lift us up into the word amen
[1:44:13] that it won't be just brother John
[1:44:14] preaching about him brother John talking
[1:44:16] about it I'm speaking to myself
[1:44:18] not to this church I'm speaking to
[1:44:19] myself that this would not just be a
[1:44:21] word that we're bringing over the pulpit
[1:44:22] but that it would be a reality in our
[1:44:24] lives amen that would be a seeking heart
[1:44:26] that it would be something that's
[1:44:28] drawing us to him that it's something
[1:44:29] that's pulling us and saying there's
[1:44:31] more there's more for you God there's
[1:44:34] more for you Church there's more for you
[1:44:35] end time message Believers and it's not
[1:44:38] just Doctrine but it's a life lived in
[1:44:40] the power of the Holy Spirit day in and
[1:44:42] day out amen amen let's just bow our
[1:44:44] heads Heavenly Father
