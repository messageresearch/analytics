[4:57] tonight my eyes doing much better I'm
[4:59] still wearing GL glasses but the
[5:00] swelling's going down and the irritation
[5:02] is becoming less and less every day so
[5:04] I'm thankful to that amen Blanc and the
[5:07] boys made it safely to California an
[5:08] uneventful trip so we're thankful for
[5:10] that they're in sunshine and warmth
[5:12] right now
[5:14] so and my mom's in Honolulu
[5:17] so anyways and here we are here we are
[5:22] praise the Lord anyhow right amen amen
[5:25] we want to remember brother Dale Walger
[5:27] he had a went to the doctor today and
[5:30] and they found that his cancer is a
[5:31] little more severe or more serious than
[5:33] they anticipated but you know I was
[5:35] thinking in the office that to God
[5:37] there's no difference between an eye
[5:39] infection and a Cancer and whatever else
[5:42] that we seem to be dealing with amen
[5:44] that he's the God of all he's the God of
[5:46] all healing he has full Authority and
[5:49] power over every sickness that comes
[5:51] against us every situation amen and so
[5:54] we believe in all situations amen that
[5:57] God is the god that heals our disease
[5:59] Jesus amen amen Psalms
[6:02] 25:5 David says Lead Me in thy truth and
[6:06] teach me for thou art the god of my
[6:09] salvation on thee do I wait all the day
[6:12] and then John 16:13 we've read this
[6:14] before but he says how be it when he the
[6:16] spirit of Truth is come he will guide
[6:19] you into all Truth for he shall not
[6:21] speak of himself but whatsoever he shall
[6:24] hear that shall he speak and he shall
[6:26] show you things to come amen God bless
[6:29] you you can have your seats this evening
[6:31] and I want to take just one service on a
[6:34] thought here as we continue our series
[6:35] on the Holy Ghost and I want to take a a
[6:38] title this evening of a guide for life
[6:40] amen and it's it's funny how technology
[6:42] has changed so many things well for most
[6:44] of us it didn't change much for brother
[6:46] Dale but uh you know when Blanc and I
[6:48] first moved to Texas they didn't really
[6:50] have GPS's back then what they had was
[6:53] Map Quest and so when we moved to Texas
[6:55] the first time we were poor students and
[6:58] and so we went to map and we printed out
[7:00] the instructions from St John's
[7:02] newfinland all the way to Fort Worth
[7:04] Texas and it was a big package of paper
[7:07] with all the step-by-step instructions
[7:09] there and of course today we don't do
[7:11] that except unless your brother Dale
[7:12] when you moved from Alberta and he just
[7:14] took a map and went with it and we did
[7:16] have a map just in case things went
[7:18] sideways amen but we were poor students
[7:19] we couldn't really afford a GPS but we
[7:21] had a destination in mind and we looked
[7:23] it up and we got all of the the things
[7:26] that that we needed and we trusted what
[7:27] we had and we set out on the road and
[7:30] guess what we got to Dallas Fort Worth
[7:32] without any issue and of course we we
[7:34] went there a second time uh once I
[7:36] graduated and to live there for quite
[7:38] some time but but uh there we had to do
[7:41] the same thing and we printed it out but
[7:42] once we got there and actually got a
[7:44] little bit of money it's a massive City
[7:46] eight or Metroplex 8 million people
[7:48] takes you over an hour to drive east to
[7:50] west and north to south there I mean
[7:51] it's it's absolutely massive and so we
[7:54] bought a GPS to go in our car because we
[7:56] had so many new places to go and so many
[7:59] new homes H to go to and and driving to
[8:01] work and driving here and going to
[8:03] church and visiting this believer and
[8:05] that believer and so we didn't have cell
[8:07] phones back then this was early 2000s
[8:09] you had a cell phone but they didn't
[8:10] have GPS capability they were expensive
[8:13] but we spent our money on a on a GPS and
[8:16] and we paid a lot of money for that
[8:17] thing I I think it was about $300 we
[8:19] probably paid back then for something
[8:21] like that but it completely changed our
[8:23] lives because now we didn't have to
[8:24] worry about how to get somewhere we
[8:26] didn't have to worry about what happens
[8:28] if we took a wrong turn cuz it could
[8:29] correct us as we went but the other
[8:31] thing we learned is that a GPS is not an
[8:34] absolute and and even today we find that
[8:37] even with your cell phones with it built
[8:39] in it could give us wrong directions it
[8:41] could tell us to make a turn where there
[8:43] was no turn it would take us down a road
[8:45] that wasn't really a road it would it
[8:47] would give us instructions that we
[8:48] weren't able to comply with it tell you
[8:50] to take a turn and you're on a freeway
[8:51] up in the air and there's no way you can
[8:52] turn you know unless you decide to go
[8:54] through the side of the the concrete
[8:56] barriers that were there amen it didn't
[8:58] often happen but it happened often
[9:00] enough that we learned that if we were
[9:02] going to go somewhere we needed to look
[9:04] before we went to make sure that when
[9:05] we're on the way we could recognize
[9:07] trouble if it was coming our way and
[9:10] like I said even today you know as good
[9:12] as cell phones are and Google Maps and
[9:14] and and and Google Street View and all
[9:16] these different things you can you can
[9:17] see these things but it sometimes messes
[9:20] these things up amen and it can lead you
[9:22] astray and you know I remember this when
[9:24] it was in the news how a a Canadian
[9:26] woman in Ontario followed her GPS right
[9:28] into the lake
[9:30] now you would think as the water was
[9:31] coming up that something in her would
[9:33] have said stop stop stop this isn't
[9:37] right but she blindly followed the
[9:39] directions she she had so committed her
[9:42] trust to her GPS and her phone that she
[9:45] followed it all the way into complete
[9:47] destruction of her vehicle and put her
[9:49] life in Peril now you think that's
[9:53] insane but yet it's amazing how what
[9:55] happens when people don't look where
[9:57] they're going and instead trusting
[10:00] something else that it's like they
[10:01] completely abdicate their ability to to
[10:04] think for themselves you know it's even
[10:06] gotten to the point I found this one and
[10:08] if you look on the bottom of its sign it
[10:10] says your GPS is wrong because what
[10:12] happens is so many people were making
[10:14] the same mistake and taking the wrong
[10:17] road to nowhere that they put up a sign
[10:19] saying don't follow your GPS the real
[10:22] route that you're looking for is along
[10:24] this path so many people go along that
[10:27] way and what is it it's the problem is
[10:29] that that people haven't looked to see
[10:30] where they're going and then compared
[10:32] what the directions are to where they're
[10:33] supposed to be going now that's pretty
[10:36] much a sermon in itself isn't it that
[10:38] you aren't looking where you're you're
[10:40] you're trusting so completely that
[10:41] you're focused on where you're at rather
[10:43] than where your directions are taking
[10:45] you if I'm going to cross new Fin and
[10:47] try and go to the West Coast if I'm
[10:49] driving for 3 hours and my compass
[10:51] hasn't turned West yet there's a problem
[10:55] because if I want to go to the West
[10:57] eventually the compass has to start
[10:58] pointing to a Westerly Direction so I
[11:01] know that I'm on the wrong road if I
[11:03] never go west and that's the way we
[11:05] ought to be able to look at life no
[11:07] matter what goal we have where we're
[11:08] trying to get what we're trying to
[11:10] achieve we ought to see something along
[11:12] the way that tells us we're on the right
[11:14] path that there's there are signs along
[11:17] the way there are there's feedback along
[11:20] the way that tells us you're going to
[11:21] get there that you're on the right path
[11:23] and you're going to get where you're
[11:24] going amen if we're trying to retire
[11:27] with a a million or $2 million doar at
[11:29] the end of of our working life amen and
[11:32] we're 10 years into our journey to
[11:34] retirement and all we have is bills
[11:36] bills bills and big vacations and big
[11:39] mortgages and big car payments and these
[11:41] things something in US ought to say
[11:43] you're not on the road to retiring with
[11:44] a million why because the road to
[11:47] retirement is filled with savings and
[11:50] rsps and
[11:53] Investments not just fun and games it's
[11:56] got simple living along the way it's
[11:58] living within your means these are all
[12:00] along the path to retiring with what you
[12:02] need at the end of your journey but we
[12:04] have people whether it's our parents who
[12:05] might be fiscally responsible maybe a
[12:07] good friend or we we pay or have a
[12:09] financial advisor that tell us how to
[12:12] get to that million dollar or
[12:13] multi-million dollar retirement why
[12:16] because some of them are there and some
[12:18] of them have been trained to get other
[12:20] people there but we put our trust in our
[12:22] in our finishing where our goal is in
[12:25] that person because they've either been
[12:27] there before or they know how to get
[12:29] there because they've taken specialized
[12:31] training we're trusting that they can do
[12:33] what we can't do in ourselves amen you
[12:36] know when we go moose hunting by God's
[12:38] grace I'll leave Sunday to go moose
[12:39] hunting for a week in central Newland
[12:42] when we go there brother Nelson guy Jr
[12:44] takes us around and he's a professional
[12:46] guide amen he's a moose Hunter himself
[12:49] and so more than that he knows not just
[12:51] moose but he knows the area where the
[12:53] Moose are he doesn't get lost he can't
[12:57] get lost because he spent so much time
[12:59] in the woods there that he knows every
[13:01] Bush every I'm I'm I'm exaggerating
[13:03] slightly but he knows where everything
[13:04] is and what happens he knows if he goes
[13:06] in a certain direction he'll hit a
[13:08] landmark he knows and then he'll know
[13:09] where he is absolutely based on that
[13:12] amen so he knows every nook and cranny
[13:15] he knows where where the Moose are he
[13:17] knows where they like to travel and what
[13:19] times of day and what times of the
[13:20] Season he he knows what they like to eat
[13:22] he knows the signs that moose have been
[13:24] there all these things the first time I
[13:27] went out with him he's gone and he's
[13:28] following a moose and I haven't seen a
[13:30] track I haven't seen anything and then
[13:31] he'll point out a shrub where it just
[13:32] nipped off the top of an elder and he
[13:34] say see it's still green it's still wet
[13:36] he was just here maybe within the last
[13:37] couple of hours I don't see anything why
[13:40] he's a guide he knows what he's doing
[13:43] the first moose I ever got I would have
[13:45] walked right by her but Nelson stopped
[13:47] me and he says she's right there go
[13:50] shoot shoot shoot and I'm looking he's
[13:51] saying see her hump right there and she
[13:53] was laying down behind a hump of grass
[13:55] and all that was showing was about this
[13:56] much of a brown hump of their back
[13:59] wouldn't have seen her but he had known
[14:00] for quite some time she was close I
[14:02] didn't know anything but as a guide he
[14:04] knew she was close and so he was looking
[14:07] for her and he saw her I didn't know she
[14:09] was so close I wasn't looking for her I
[14:11] would have probably missed her until she
[14:12] thundered up and scared the the ti out
[14:14] of me because I hadn't seen her in the
[14:16] first place
[14:17] amen every year we've gone out by God's
[14:20] grace we've gotten our moose why we have
[14:22] a guide we have somebody that knows what
[14:24] he's doing amen by God's grace amen and
[14:27] so now when we go out last year when I
[14:29] went out brother Nelson wasn't there he
[14:31] wasn't available because of his knee
[14:32] surgery but I had to go out by myself
[14:34] and get my own moose but I've learned
[14:36] enough from somebody that knows what
[14:37] they're doing and what they're talking
[14:39] about and he show me around enough that
[14:41] I have a general idea that I'm somewhat
[14:44] capable now I'm nowhere near what he is
[14:47] but I can do the job based on what I've
[14:49] learned from him by setting aside what I
[14:51] thought I knew and sitting down and
[14:53] shutting up and letting him teach me I'm
[14:55] now able to potentially do what he does
[14:57] for me amen
[15:00] but I want you to catch this thought
[15:02] amen because a guide has to be somebody
[15:04] that actually knows what they're doing
[15:06] and where they're going brother says
[15:08] this way and this is a long quote but it
[15:09] we we're only going to get through the
[15:10] first line he says you have to have a
[15:13] guide when you don't know where you're
[15:14] going and maybe I can add to it if
[15:17] you'll if you'll allow me this evening
[15:18] you have to have a guide when you don't
[15:20] know what you're doing amen when you
[15:22] don't know what's going on that's why
[15:24] you need a guide amen if we come back to
[15:26] our original scripture we opened up with
[15:28] David said Lead Me in thy truth and
[15:32] teach me for thou art the god of my
[15:35] salvation and on thee do I wait all the
[15:37] day we're preaching on a guide for life
[15:39] tonight and we have to realize that we
[15:42] can't be the guide there's no point in
[15:45] having a guide if I'm going to lead the
[15:48] point of having the guide is so that he
[15:50] takes me where I need to go and he keeps
[15:52] me safe while he's doing it anden if I'm
[15:55] trying to show him what I know if I'm
[15:57] trying to show him what I'm capable of
[15:59] doing then guess what the guide is of no
[16:01] help I've watched a ton of uh of hunting
[16:04] videos I love to to learn and and see
[16:06] what other people do and how they they
[16:08] they do these different things and one
[16:10] thing I've noticed is that most guides
[16:12] aren't
[16:13] pushy they'll they they'll try and help
[16:15] you but if you don't let them help you
[16:17] know what they do they step back and you
[16:19] know what else happens you're
[16:21] unsuccessful usually or you get hurt or
[16:23] you do something but when they'll let
[16:25] when you'll let the guide be what he's
[16:27] supposed to be for you let him do what
[16:29] you're paying him to do usually you're
[16:31] successful and you're safe in your
[16:33] success Africa's the the king of big
[16:35] Gabe hunting dangerous big game hunting
[16:38] and I can't tell you how many times I've
[16:39] seen where they they they've shot an
[16:41] animal or they're about to shoot one
[16:43] that's very dangerous and the the hunter
[16:45] is about to fire but you've got a guide
[16:47] that's backing him up with an even
[16:48] bigger gun and it's usually got two
[16:51] bullets it's got two barrels and and two
[16:53] bullets ready to go and that man the
[16:55] hunter the the the woman fires and when
[16:58] they fire if that animal does not go
[17:00] down or starts to charge then what does
[17:02] the guy do he takes the animal down why
[17:05] he's there to protect the person that
[17:07] he's with but now if you're all in his
[17:09] way and trying to do your own thing then
[17:11] what happens you're going to get
[17:12] trampled you're going to get run over
[17:13] because you're not letting the the the
[17:16] guy do what he's supposed to do Amen in
[17:18] this life we've got to realize our ways
[17:20] are death it it's that simple our ways
[17:23] lead to destruction amen everything
[17:25] that's in our nature as a human being is
[17:27] destructive amen our Innovations are
[17:29] even Dead Brother Braham says we we go
[17:32] to war and we kill people with our
[17:33] weapons and then we come back and in a
[17:35] time of Peace we kill more people with
[17:36] our Innovation than we did in the war
[17:39] everything we do has a way of coming
[17:40] around and biting us if you've noticed
[17:43] scripture says in Proverbs says there is
[17:45] a way which seeth right unto a man but
[17:48] the end thereof are the ways of death
[17:51] does God know how to turn a phrase or
[17:53] what he says you can think one way is
[17:56] good and he says in the end this is
[17:58] multiple ways of how to
[18:00] die it it it always leads to to bad
[18:04] things for our lives amen the greatest
[18:06] fa failing we have in the world today is
[18:08] that people think things are right and
[18:10] they act on them and it's nothing to do
[18:13] with the word of God Amen they come up
[18:15] with an idea these days rarely with
[18:17] experience or understanding but because
[18:19] it seems good to them or because they
[18:21] think a good person agrees with them or
[18:23] is on the project with them they go
[18:25] ahead and they do it and what do they
[18:27] lead us to destruction every single time
[18:29] amen why because they think it's good it
[18:32] must be good but it's not but God comes
[18:34] along he says every way which you think
[18:36] if you're an unregenerated person every
[18:39] idea you come up with leads to death
[18:42] that's the absolute of the scripture
[18:43] amen every plan every thought every
[18:46] Doctrine whatever it might be we might
[18:48] have the greatest and the best of
[18:50] intentions yet God says it leads to
[18:52] death you see what happened after God
[18:54] gave the law to Moses 613 laws and what
[18:57] did they do they added to it
[18:59] they added to it and what did it do it
[19:02] led them into dead religion so that when
[19:04] the word finally came they couldn't
[19:06] recognize it amen but everything we come
[19:09] up with it has a way of biting Us in the
[19:11] end brother BR puts it this way he says
[19:13] every man that's unregenerated of God
[19:15] will go that way of Destruction he says
[19:18] you can't help it your own soul guides
[19:21] you until there is the the the
[19:24] leadership of the Holy Spirit the Seal
[19:26] of the holy spirit in our soul it we
[19:28] can't help help it we can't help it he
[19:31] says if you are born again you're bound
[19:32] to go up if you're not born again you've
[19:35] got to go down amen that's a horrible
[19:38] thing to think if you're not regenerated
[19:40] amen but if you are it's a wonderful
[19:42] thing to know watch what he says here he
[19:44] says Jesus talking to this Mighty ruler
[19:48] who did not understand and he was giving
[19:49] the Old Testament a scriptural proof of
[19:52] what he was talking about he said Jesus
[19:55] was very fundamental in his Doctrine
[19:57] it's amazing Jesus quotes the the Old
[19:59] Testament constantly when he's preaching
[20:02] why because the word always points to
[20:04] the word amen he says but it was against
[20:07] their Theology of that Doctrine Jesus is
[20:10] giving them the truth of the doctrine
[20:12] but they had developed a Theology of
[20:14] that Doctrine they're both preaching
[20:16] from the same book but one of them has
[20:18] added his thoughts to it and the other
[20:20] one is the thoughts of it and what
[20:22] happens is you get a clash and what
[20:24] happens is somebody has to back down and
[20:27] so what happens is what they push Jesus
[20:30] away and they go on to destruction he
[20:32] says although in their theology they
[20:34] were very
[20:35] Orthodox they believed and were very
[20:37] much of Believers in what they did
[20:39] believe but they didn't have it the
[20:41] truth the scripture says there's a way
[20:43] that seeth right into a man it may seem
[20:46] every bit right but the end thereof are
[20:48] the ways of death and he says these
[20:50] words so we must be sure that we're
[20:54] right he says God knew in all ages that
[20:57] whether it was right or wrong he
[20:59] Vindicated and he proved it amen so the
[21:02] reason we need a guide is because we
[21:04] recognize we don't have the answers we
[21:07] don't know where we're going we don't
[21:08] know the way and we need someone to help
[21:11] us that's the only reason I ever need a
[21:13] guide is I me one or all of those
[21:15] conditions amen that's not that that's
[21:18] the starting place that it that it comes
[21:20] to to bringing a guide into your life is
[21:22] you have to recognize personally and
[21:25] individually I can't get where I need to
[21:28] go go on my own I don't have the
[21:31] knowledge I don't have this experience
[21:33] remember what what God Said to Joshua
[21:35] they had to put the word in front of
[21:36] them he says you have not been this way
[21:39] before so something else has to lead the
[21:42] way to make sure you don't stumble and
[21:44] fall and die by the wayside amen so this
[21:47] has to be a personal revelation to us as
[21:49] individuals that we need a guide because
[21:52] we don't know what we're doing and we
[21:53] don't know how to get there now watch
[21:56] what brother Bram says we're going to
[21:57] preach a lot out of the message a Guide
[21:59] tonight he says now a guide has to know
[22:02] the
[22:02] way what goods a guide that doesn't know
[22:05] the way he says he has to know where
[22:07] he's going and what he's doing and catch
[22:10] this and how to take care of you along
[22:13] the road he's got to see that you don't
[22:15] come up lost the guide has to sign your
[22:17] license to the game warden he has to
[22:19] sign himself in and he's responsible for
[22:22] you if anything happens to you it's his
[22:25] responsibility he's got to take care of
[22:28] you he's got to see that you're not lost
[22:30] he's got to be sure that he doesn't send
[22:32] you in somewhere that you don't know
[22:33] your way back and if you do get lost
[22:36] he's got to know the country so well
[22:39] that he can pick you up just any time
[22:41] he's got to know all these things or he
[22:43] cannot be licensed to be a guide you
[22:46] know I love that idea of the guide's the
[22:48] one that takes
[22:49] responsibility because that takes the
[22:51] pressure off me to try and be what I'm
[22:54] not he's taking the responsibility
[22:57] that's what I'm paying him for is to
[22:59] take the responsibility from my
[23:01] shoulders and put it on him because he's
[23:03] proven to know what he's doing you know
[23:07] when I was in
[23:09] management the way I always handled
[23:11] things was if my team made a mistake it
[23:13] was my mistake but if my team did
[23:16] something good it was the individuals
[23:18] and that's how you grow people and
[23:20] that's how you get people to buy in is
[23:22] that you when they they make a mistake
[23:24] you make it your mistake and when they
[23:26] do well then you make it theirs
[23:29] and what I found is when I did that is
[23:32] that one it kept you humble and two it
[23:35] allowed people to see that you were
[23:36] weren't just in it for yourself you were
[23:38] in it for them and the idea was that we
[23:41] had enough wins and enough good things
[23:43] coming through that when we inevitably
[23:45] made a mistake we had enough credit
[23:46] build up on all the good things that we'
[23:49] done that the bad things didn't matter
[23:50] quite so much but when I finally left
[23:53] management and came here and started
[23:55] working in New Finland it was such a
[23:57] sigh of relief in so many ways because
[23:59] now I'm only responsible for
[24:01] myself I'm as good as I want to be or
[24:04] I'm as bad as I am there's really not
[24:06] much I can do about it but I don't have
[24:07] to answer for anybody else I don't have
[24:09] to be looking over everybody's shoulder
[24:11] I don't have to be keeping things up to
[24:13] date and jumping and filling gaps and
[24:15] and bridging bridging things and all
[24:17] these different things amen because the
[24:19] buck stops with you and it's not a lot
[24:21] of fun even though the pays better it's
[24:23] not a whole lot of fun and so it was a
[24:25] relief to set that burden down but I
[24:27] guess the jokes on me because then he
[24:29] made me a
[24:30] pastor but here's the thing church I am
[24:33] not the guide that's the thing as I
[24:36] stepped into a different role and yes
[24:38] there's responsibilities with it amen
[24:40] but it's not the same because if there's
[24:42] one thing it's I know it's that I cannot
[24:44] be your guide amen I can't Le myself I
[24:48] need a guide which means I can't be your
[24:50] guide amen the holy spirit is the great
[24:52] Shepherd of the church that was what
[24:54] they fell away from in the Ephesian
[24:56] Church age was they lost their First
[24:58] Love and they tried to make men their
[25:00] guides I'm here to tell you I am not
[25:02] your guide if you're looking to me
[25:04] you've missed the
[25:06] mark But if I can surrender in humility
[25:10] and let the great Shepherd use
[25:12] me then we've got a Fighting
[25:15] Chance because he's ordained pastors to
[25:17] lead the flock but they have to be
[25:19] Pastors in subjection themselves not so
[25:22] puffed up that they can't be led by the
[25:23] holy spirit
[25:25] amen that was David's prayer David's
[25:29] prayer was God Lead Me In Your Truth and
[25:32] teach me your way that's the truth that
[25:35] makes a difference that's real truth
[25:37] that's life-changing truth amen that's
[25:39] proper leadership that's the kind of
[25:40] truth that will redeem us back to our
[25:42] original condition is his kind of Truth
[25:45] amen so when God gives us something and
[25:47] he teaches us and he leads us we ought
[25:49] to be able to use that the next time
[25:51] that situation comes around the first
[25:54] time's always the hardest but once we've
[25:56] learned something we ought to be able to
[25:58] say I've been here before and here's
[25:59] what I do listen the first time you
[26:02] commit your finances into the hands of
[26:04] God ought to be the last time you need
[26:06] to really think about it the first time
[26:08] he proves it is the last time he needs
[26:09] to prove it because if he proved it once
[26:11] he'll keep proving it over and over and
[26:13] over again amen whether it's your health
[26:15] whether it's your marriage whether it's
[26:16] your kids what the ministry whatever it
[26:19] might be once we've learned that God
[26:21] does what his word says we ought to be
[26:23] able to keep going in that path and
[26:25] never have to wonderer again we ought to
[26:26] be able to reply it to apply it amen
[26:29] remember what the scripture says we've
[26:30] read it so many times now he says he
[26:32] would bring things to our remembrance
[26:35] amen he'd remind us once he's taught us
[26:37] he'll remind you hey remember we've
[26:39] already been here oh it looks different
[26:42] but the principle of the word is the
[26:43] same just take that and move forward and
[26:45] you're going to be okay that's what he's
[26:47] trying to do amen you know somebody said
[26:49] to me after service not too long ago
[26:51] they said brother John I've heard that
[26:53] all my life but tonight it finally
[26:56] clicked
[26:58] see there's a difference between
[27:01] knowing and
[27:03] experiencing there's a difference
[27:05] between knowing and applying that
[27:06] knowledge amen and what happened is it's
[27:09] one thing to know truth but he said that
[27:11] he would lead us into all truth that's
[27:13] an experience of it not just a head
[27:16] knowledge of it amen that's what we read
[27:18] in our opening scripture he said he will
[27:20] guide you into all truth that's the
[27:23] defining action of the holy spirit is he
[27:26] takes you into all truth he does doesn't
[27:28] just do it for you but he does it to you
[27:31] he makes it a part of you he takes you
[27:33] from no truth or maybe partial truth
[27:36] into all truth that's the working of the
[27:38] holy spirit amen now there's a beautiful
[27:40] diagram that we use to explain something
[27:42] like this it's called a ven diagram and
[27:44] it shows and we use it to show things
[27:47] that are in common and where things
[27:49] intersect and I thought it'd be an easy
[27:50] way to show how this is supposed to look
[27:53] this evening and this is by no means
[27:55] exhaustive but it's just a few things
[27:57] that the Lord laid on my heart heart so
[27:59] if we look in this we've got us and
[28:00] we've got all truth and the goal is to
[28:02] bring those two into the same Circle
[28:04] amen and if we look at this we all start
[28:07] out and it doesn't matter if we're
[28:08] raised in the message raised in a
[28:10] Christian Home raised with believing
[28:12] parents or if we're born to a uh a a
[28:15] drug using alcohol drinking family of
[28:18] atheists it doesn't matter every single
[28:20] one of us starts out this way we are
[28:22] lost amen that's the way we start we are
[28:25] children of Disobedience by our human
[28:27] nature we are separated from God we're
[28:30] dead in religion we might be in a
[28:32] denomination or we might be in our own
[28:34] religion which is we're relying on self
[28:37] either way it's a dead religion amen and
[28:39] we are carnal our our nature is carnal
[28:42] because we're unregenerated and we are a
[28:44] slave to the emotions and the feelings
[28:46] and the thoughts and the carnality of
[28:47] this body amen that's where we start and
[28:50] there look there is none better and
[28:52] there's none worse in God's eyes here
[28:54] every single one of us starts this way
[28:57] so it doesn't matter tonight if your
[28:58] kids are out in the world or if they're
[29:00] in church if they are not filled with
[29:02] the Holy Spirit they look exactly the
[29:03] same to God there is no difference and
[29:05] the work is no more difficult or easy
[29:07] for God for one or the other it requires
[29:09] all of us to go through this particular
[29:11] path now remember Jesus said that the
[29:14] Holy Spirit would guide us into all
[29:16] truth because we I want to stop and talk
[29:18] about that for a second because we've
[29:20] got to realize that it doesn't say he
[29:22] will lead us to all truth and it doesn't
[29:25] say he will lead us around all truth he
[29:27] says I will lead lead you into all truth
[29:30] and mean you can sit around the truth
[29:31] you can sit around True Believers Holy
[29:33] Ghost filled people all your days and it
[29:37] won't do you a lick of good unless you
[29:38] get into all truth the way that they are
[29:40] amen it's got to be a personal thing
[29:42] Amen in other words he's saying you will
[29:44] Unite with all truth you will be a part
[29:46] of all truth you'll be filled with all
[29:48] truth it's a reality not just a
[29:50] knowledge this is not Doctrine though
[29:53] Doctrine is a part of it this is a
[29:55] living experience amen I can have a lot
[29:57] of of knowledge and never really know
[29:59] what I'm talking about absolutely true
[30:02] amen I went to to school to to be an
[30:04] engineer and I graduated by answering a
[30:06] lot of very difficult questions on a lot
[30:08] of very difficult tests but that is not
[30:10] what made me an engineer what made me an
[30:12] engineer is when I took all those
[30:14] answers and all of that knowledge and I
[30:16] started to use it to design and build
[30:18] things that worked listen you can be
[30:21] somebody that designs a lot of things
[30:22] but if they don't work you're not much
[30:23] of an engineer but when I could
[30:25] practically apply those things and and
[30:28] and produce things that were intended by
[30:30] my employer now that's when I became an
[30:33] engineer and so we've got to be in it it
[30:36] can't just be around us and we can't
[30:38] just be around it it's got to be a
[30:39] transformation amen so what is we' we've
[30:43] looked and we've seen what all what what
[30:44] you are but what is all
[30:46] truth what's the difference between you
[30:48] and all truth we know that truth is one
[30:50] thing and one thing alone and that means
[30:52] it's God's word that's the only thing
[30:54] that truth is What God Says is truth and
[30:56] everything else is a lie unless it
[30:57] agrees with the word of God Jesus said
[30:59] this he said sanctify them through thy
[31:01] truth Thy word is truth so when he says
[31:04] I'm going to guide you into all truth
[31:06] what's he talking about I'm going to
[31:08] guide you into all of the word but not
[31:11] all of the word but all of the word that
[31:14] applies to you because listen Noah's
[31:15] message does us no good it's all
[31:18] applicable to us for learning for
[31:21] correction for guidance in these things
[31:23] but the the the into all truth part is
[31:25] that he's taking you into the word that
[31:27] applies to you the word for your day
[31:30] amen we're not trying to throw
[31:31] scriptures away but there's a portion
[31:34] that is that is meant for a particular
[31:36] group of people throughout the
[31:37] scriptures amen so we can look at both
[31:40] of these things in a single scripture
[31:42] and in revelation 22 this is almost the
[31:44] end of the Bible it says if any man
[31:46] shall take away from the works of from
[31:48] the words of the book of this prophecy
[31:50] God shall take away his part out of the
[31:53] book of life and out of the holy city
[31:56] and from the things which are written in
[31:58] this book you know there's an
[31:59] interesting Doctrine that's floating
[32:01] around these days not within the message
[32:02] but in the nominal Christian world and
[32:04] they're taking the Book of James and
[32:06] they're saying this book is not a part
[32:09] of the Gospel it belongs in the Old
[32:12] Testament because James focused on
[32:16] works that's what they say and works is
[32:19] under the law we're under grace amen and
[32:22] they say well we're not doing away with
[32:23] it we're just saying it doesn't belong
[32:25] under the New Covenant it doesn't belong
[32:28] in the New Testament amen but when you
[32:30] do that you make it of no effect because
[32:32] God placed it in the New Covenant in the
[32:34] New Testament and you're sitting here
[32:36] saying I know better this doesn't apply
[32:39] why did James have to write James is a
[32:41] really rough
[32:43] book James said show me your faith by
[32:45] your works why because there was people
[32:48] in those days that had accepted all the
[32:51] grace but they didn't realize or they
[32:53] didn't come to the reality that there
[32:55] was power behind that Grace to make you
[32:57] live then do certain things inside of
[32:59] your life and James said if you're just
[33:00] sitting on the couch with your grace
[33:02] that's not what God gave it to you
[33:04] for so what is it they have to take it
[33:07] with the entire gospel because if you
[33:09] just take some of the things Paul said
[33:11] you'll end up sitting on your couch
[33:12] doing nothing as well because it's all
[33:15] Grace it's all Grace it's all Grace I
[33:16] can't get myself into Heaven by my Works
[33:18] they don't add to they don't take away
[33:20] anything but they do and we'll see that
[33:21] in scriptures in a moment amen but it's
[33:23] all in Balance the entire word is
[33:26] imbalance so if you'll take the entire
[33:28] word it'll keep you in Balance but what
[33:30] happens is when people don't like a
[33:32] portion of it they say this doesn't
[33:34] apply to me and what do they do they
[33:36] lose the balance of the word and the
[33:38] guide doesn't work anymore because now
[33:39] they're going to the right or to the
[33:41] left based on what they feel in
[33:42] themselves amen but we see here in the
[33:45] scripture we cannot add one word and we
[33:47] cannot take one word away we can't do
[33:49] anything it is an absolute it's
[33:52] unchanging it's for our admonition it's
[33:54] for our correction Repro encouragement
[33:56] teaching and it's all in balance if
[33:58] we'll take it all it does a perfect work
[34:00] amen but notice there it says God shall
[34:02] take away his part from the things which
[34:05] are written in this book God says I'll
[34:08] take away your part the person that adds
[34:11] to or takes away from the word will lose
[34:13] his part he'll lose what's written for
[34:15] him he'll lose the potential blessing
[34:17] amen if you look at what was written for
[34:19] our age in leoda in Revelations 3
[34:22] there's a word that's written to us and
[34:24] if we take away from it or we add to it
[34:27] what happens is we make the word of no
[34:28] effect and we don't get the blessing of
[34:30] it we don't get the correction of it we
[34:32] don't get the Overcomer gift of it amen
[34:35] we don't get anything from it when we
[34:37] add or take away we change it and it has
[34:39] no power anymore and so you can't get
[34:41] the benefit of it amen now we know that
[34:43] if you're a child of God you can't be
[34:46] lost that's quite a statement but we
[34:48] believe that amen Jesus said all that
[34:51] the father have given I won't lose one
[34:55] amen it's impossible for us to be l why
[34:58] because we're a part of Christ we're a
[34:59] part of the word we were there in the
[35:01] beginning we've got to be there but one
[35:03] thing's for sure that even as a child of
[35:05] God we can walk a hard path of our own
[35:07] making amen there's a rough way that we
[35:09] can go amen and what happens is when we
[35:11] decide to go our way what does God let
[35:13] us do he lets us go for a while so we
[35:15] can see how it how it works out and we
[35:18] when we get good and sick and tired of
[35:19] doing things our way God just brings the
[35:21] word right around and says now you can
[35:22] make the choice and if we turn it away
[35:24] then we just keep going around and
[35:26] around the mountain in the desert and
[35:27] until we finally do it God's way
[35:29] amen but what does he do he's waiting
[35:31] for the holy he's he's he's waiting for
[35:34] us to let the Holy Spirit Quicken that
[35:36] word to us amen and because of this some
[35:39] people will come to God empty-handed in
[35:41] the end children of God will come to God
[35:43] empty-handed In the End Amen everything
[35:45] that they did in their life their works
[35:47] the way they spent their time their
[35:48] effort their money whatever it might be
[35:50] might not stand up to God's scrutiny it
[35:52] may not be an eternal blessing that's
[35:53] what I mean when I say empty-handed Paul
[35:56] talks about it in first Corin
[35:57] Corinthians he says for other Foundation
[35:59] can no man lay than that which is laid
[36:02] which is Jesus Christ amen the rock the
[36:04] Cornerstone that the church is built on
[36:06] is the revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[36:09] it's not Peter it's not a pope it's not
[36:11] some church amen Christ is the the
[36:14] Cornerstone he's the stone that the
[36:15] builders
[36:16] rejected amen that is what we read last
[36:19] service and he says now if any man build
[36:21] upon this Foundation gold silver
[36:24] precious stones wood hay and stubble now
[36:27] you look at that that's quite a list you
[36:29] put gold you put silver precious stones
[36:32] and and those things are going to hold
[36:34] up pretty good they're hard they're
[36:36] they're difficult to break up wood in
[36:39] theory can be very strong hay not
[36:41] exactly known for its structural
[36:43] properties and stubble is just hay
[36:45] that's left over in the ground that's
[36:47] even
[36:48] worse so there's a bunch of things we
[36:50] can build on there and those are by our
[36:52] own
[36:54] choosing and he says every man's work
[36:56] shall be made manifest in other words
[36:58] it'll be clear what it was built how it
[37:00] was built for the day shall declare it
[37:04] because it shall be revealed by fire and
[37:06] the fire shall try every man's work of
[37:09] what sort it is I don't get to test my
[37:11] Works God tests it God gets to say if
[37:14] it's good or bad if it passes the test
[37:16] or if it fails the test he always judges
[37:18] by his word so that means I don't get to
[37:20] say it's right or wrong good or bad he
[37:22] gets to say it amen he says if any man's
[37:25] work abide which he ha built there upon
[37:27] upon he shall receive a reward so there
[37:30] are some that are going to stick but in
[37:33] the Amplified says but if any person's
[37:35] work is burned up by the testing of God
[37:38] he will suffer the loss of his reward
[37:41] yet he himself shall be saved but only
[37:44] as one who has barely escaped through
[37:47] fire so what do you lose potentially you
[37:50] lose your reward you lose the Eternal
[37:53] goodness of your works because they were
[37:55] not Eternal they were not of God Amen
[37:57] and so you end up in coming to your lord
[37:59] and savior and your empty-handed
[38:02] net there's nothing there there's
[38:04] nothing of Eternal value for me the only
[38:07] thing that's of Eternal value is a soul
[38:09] that's just me that means you got you
[38:12] brought nobody with you you lived a life
[38:14] for yourself in some form or fashion
[38:17] that's a sad place to be but he says
[38:18] there's going to be some that do it but
[38:20] he says you won't lose your life you
[38:21] won't lose your eternal life you won't
[38:23] lose your your your salvation or
[38:25] anything like that but you come in and
[38:26] you come in and
[38:27] empty-handed but when we look at what's
[38:29] written in the Book of Revelation we see
[38:31] that it's the whole Plan of Redemption
[38:33] from start to finish it's Christ from
[38:35] start to finish it's the whole Plan of
[38:36] Redemption amen even in John writing
[38:39] there he says if you change one thing if
[38:40] you add anything to this Redemption
[38:42] story or you take anything out you lose
[38:45] your part that God allowed for you but
[38:47] if he says that if you add or take
[38:49] anything away then it must be also true
[38:51] of the opposite that if you don't change
[38:54] anything then you would get it amen it
[38:57] it ought to be a blessing if we'll keep
[38:58] every part of it it ought to have the
[39:00] effect it's supposed to if we'll believe
[39:02] every bit of it and if we look in
[39:03] revelation 22 a bit earlier he says
[39:06] behold I come quickly blessed is he that
[39:09] keepeth the says of the prophecy of this
[39:11] book and down to 12 it says and behold I
[39:14] come quickly and my reward is with me to
[39:17] give every man according to his work as
[39:20] his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega
[39:22] the beginning and the end the first and
[39:24] the last he says blessed are they that
[39:27] do his Commandments that they may have
[39:29] right to the tree of life and may enter
[39:32] in through the gates into the city so
[39:34] there's a people prepared to take God at
[39:37] his full word amen and those people are
[39:40] the ones that have a right to the Tree
[39:42] of Life to eternal life amen and they
[39:44] won't pull away they won't shrink back
[39:46] they won't stop amen they'll go all the
[39:48] way with the word of God Amen but we see
[39:51] where we started was outside of the word
[39:54] in our na in our nature in our flesh
[39:56] amen so we're outside of all truth it's
[39:59] just me it's just you and we're standing
[40:00] there in our lost condition in these
[40:02] things but what does all truth look like
[40:04] to us what does it mean to us as a child
[40:07] of God what does the Holy Spirit do when
[40:10] it's guiding us into all
[40:12] truth it's a simple answer it shows us
[40:16] who we are in the word of God and by the
[40:19] word of God it reveals Jesus Christ that
[40:21] shows our relationship to Jesus Christ
[40:24] and then it guides us into the full and
[40:26] complete reality of what the word says
[40:28] about us and so I did it this way amen
[40:32] so now when you see all truth then now
[40:35] it's not that you're lost it's that
[40:37] you're found it's that you're no longer
[40:39] a child of Disobedience amen you're a
[40:41] Child of Light now you're not separated
[40:44] from God but you're redeemed to God now
[40:46] you're not dead in religion but you're
[40:48] alive in Christ now you're not a carnal
[40:51] creature but you're a spiritual creature
[40:53] and you're no longer a slave but you're
[40:55] a son or a daughter of God that's what
[40:57] all truth shows you amen that's what the
[40:59] word says about you amen it's a complete
[41:02] it's a complete flip of what Satan tried
[41:04] to tell
[41:06] you R puts it this way he says the holy
[41:09] spirit always speaks of the word he says
[41:12] I've got many things to tell you you
[41:15] cannot understand it now but when he
[41:16] comes he'll guide you to it that's the
[41:19] reason for the coming of the seals he
[41:22] makes some amazing statements here he
[41:23] says at the finishing of the seven seal
[41:25] the mystery of God should be finished to
[41:28] know who God is what is the opening of
[41:31] the seals the opening of the word it's
[41:33] bringing all truth back to our
[41:35] remembrance amen remember it was sealed
[41:38] to Daniel Paul had it all but there was
[41:41] a falling away and so John had to seal
[41:43] it up but as Christ comes back and he
[41:46] comes back to this last age and those
[41:48] seven seals are open what is he doing
[41:50] he's saying all truth is here again and
[41:53] when you have all truth you get the
[41:55] effect of all truth so he says under
[41:57] those seals now we should know who God
[42:01] is what he
[42:03] is how he lives his nature his being why
[42:09] because we are becoming as he
[42:12] is we don't just know it by knowledge
[42:14] but we know it by experience and he
[42:16] confirms it he says you're supposed to
[42:18] be all the way up here by that time see
[42:21] to bring us into the full stature of
[42:23] Sons and Daughters of God a church
[42:26] that's walk in the blood of Christ
[42:28] that's bought without money is paid for
[42:31] by the blood of Jesus Christ so the
[42:33] opening of the word the opening of those
[42:35] seals was to completely open the door to
[42:38] full Redemption so that the word could
[42:40] become flesh once again he says I am
[42:43] Alpha and Omega I'm the beginning and
[42:46] the end it was Christ in the first
[42:48] church and then it's Christ in the last
[42:50] church it's the full revealing of the
[42:53] word inside of us all over again amen so
[42:56] we have had two extremes that are shown
[42:58] here amen we could say so on the left we
[43:01] have you and I I added those two
[43:03] headings at the bottom where we are our
[43:05] nature is death amen it's the ways of
[43:08] death it's destruction but all truth is
[43:11] eternal life amen it's going back to God
[43:15] so that's what we have here the TR this
[43:17] is the most serious transformation that
[43:19] can occur this is literally life and
[43:22] death It's All or Nothing there's no
[43:24] halfway there's no partial it has to be
[43:27] be everything or it does you no good
[43:29] amen God is coming for a bride that is
[43:31] completely living by his word and you
[43:34] say how are we going to make that how
[43:36] are we going to get from Death to
[43:38] eternal life how are we going to have a
[43:40] complete change of way the way we look
[43:42] at ourselves the way we live the way we
[43:45] think the entire world has every gun
[43:49] pointed at keeping us from making those
[43:51] decisions from walking on that road into
[43:53] eternal life amen and there's only one
[43:55] thing that's going to get us
[43:58] there what is
[44:01] it God rich in
[44:04] mercy God rich in Mercy Church my
[44:06] discipline will not hold up to what
[44:09] Satan has ready for me it will not work
[44:11] my strength my courage whatever we might
[44:14] call it yours won't either I'm sorry to
[44:16] say it is God rich in Mercy that's going
[44:18] to take us from where we are where we
[44:20] were to where we need to be amen it's by
[44:24] Revelation that he's going to do it
[44:26] remember script says God will have mercy
[44:28] on whom he will have mercy there's an
[44:30] elect people that's already set up to
[44:33] receive his mercy and Grace amen and God
[44:35] always does it by opening Our Eyes by
[44:38] way of Revelation that's how Abel got it
[44:41] by Faith by a revelation of the will of
[44:43] God Abel gave a more perfect sacrifice
[44:47] Abraham Abraham sitting around living
[44:49] the life as everybody else's in God
[44:52] sovereignly comes down and reveals
[44:54] himself to to Abraham and takes him him
[44:57] out and everybody else gets left
[44:59] behind what is it it's the mercy and
[45:02] grace of God by The Sovereign choosing
[45:04] of God to the individual that's the only
[45:07] way he works but he always does it by
[45:09] sending his word amen he gives him his
[45:12] word we can read it we can study it we
[45:14] can hear it that's good don't stop doing
[45:16] it but until God opens our eyes we're
[45:19] not going anywhere that's just the way
[45:21] it works that's what the new birth is is
[45:23] when he opens your eyes to the word and
[45:25] you receive it and you to live in it
[45:27] amen that's the sovereignty of God
[45:30] remember what Jesus said he says you
[45:31] hear me because you are my
[45:33] sheep my sheep hear my voice that's why
[45:37] we can do it you can go a long time
[45:39] without hearing that voice but when you
[45:41] finally hear it when your eyes are open
[45:43] when your ears are open and you
[45:44] recognize who it is that's talking
[45:46] you'll never follow another voice in
[45:48] your life hey I'm not saying we don't
[45:49] make mistakes I'm not saying we don't
[45:51] get led to the left and right sometimes
[45:53] in these different things but in the end
[45:55] you'll always come back to that voice
[45:57] because that voice is what you're tuned
[45:58] to hear and to follow in your life
[46:01] Amen brother B says this he says now
[46:03] there's a way that God comes and that's
[46:05] the only way that you're ever going to
[46:07] get in there is come the way that God
[46:08] provided for you that's right he says
[46:10] the whole Bible is built completely upon
[46:13] Revelation the church is built on
[46:16] Revelation the revelation of the
[46:20] word so what happens is now is your eyes
[46:22] of understanding being open your soul
[46:24] being sealed by the Holy Spirit there's
[46:26] a transformation that's going on and
[46:28] it's bringing you into the word now
[46:30] realize this there's going to be
[46:33] conflict and the other thing is this
[46:35] there's only going to be one
[46:37] Survivor between you and all truth
[46:39] there's only going to be one Survivor
[46:41] now I'm here to give you the good news
[46:42] the good news is you don't survive all
[46:45] truth is the one that lives through this
[46:47] I have to die out you have to die out
[46:49] but that's the best news you can have is
[46:51] that this gets to go away and it's
[46:53] replaced with something else amen what
[46:56] happens is we move truth stays we're the
[47:00] one that has to pull away from where we
[47:02] are because truth is the absolute that
[47:04] is the unchanging part that is the
[47:06] unmoving part I've got to change I've
[47:08] got to surrender I've got to humble
[47:10] myself I've got to give up my thinking
[47:12] I've got to give up my emotions I've got
[47:14] to do the changing I've got to do the
[47:16] repenting because I'm the one that's
[47:19] outside of the absolute so to go in
[47:21] there I'm the one that has to change my
[47:23] course and my thinking and my
[47:25] inspiration I'm the one that's got to Di
[47:27] out so what happens now as we're guided
[47:29] into all truth is that the Heritage and
[47:31] the lies and the failures and the sins
[47:34] that we were born under start to fade
[47:36] away and you start to realize certain
[47:38] things and so what happens is we start
[47:40] to make this move and the first thing
[47:42] you find out is that once I was lost but
[47:44] now I'm found Hallelujah isn't that the
[47:47] first thing I remember so vividly the
[47:49] night I gave my heart to the Lord that I
[47:51] realized I am no longer lost I've been
[47:55] found my life has been ever more
[47:58] changed I'm in the place where I need to
[48:01] be now amen so the first thing is you
[48:04] realize you're lost but now you've been
[48:06] found then after that you realize then I
[48:08] can't be a child that's lost I've got to
[48:10] be a different child so I'm no longer a
[48:12] child of Disobedience but I'm a Child of
[48:15] Light and that comes with certain
[48:17] privileges that comes with a tutor that
[48:19] comes with authority that comes with
[48:20] expectations that comes with
[48:23] blessings and as you start to see the
[48:25] benefits of those things the Holy Spirit
[48:27] can lead you forward amen and so you
[48:29] realize now that you're not separated
[48:31] from God but rather you're redeemed to
[48:33] God and you have access to his presence
[48:36] and the Throne of mercy and Grace that
[48:38] you can have an audience with him
[48:40] anytime that you need it
[48:42] amen and then you realize that because
[48:44] you're a you're redeemed back to God
[48:46] you're in a process that's doing
[48:48] something inside of your life amen and
[48:51] it's bringing you from your condition
[48:53] into your original position and what
[48:56] that does is it takes you out of your
[48:57] dead religion and it makes you alive in
[49:00] Christ amen where there's a whole new
[49:02] life that's springing up within you
[49:04] there's something in your soul that's
[49:05] overcoming what's in these flesh and and
[49:08] our spirit realm and these different
[49:10] things amen it takes you out of the
[49:12] traditions of your family listen it's
[49:14] good to be raised in message tradition
[49:16] but they'll take you to hell if you
[49:17] don't have the Holy Ghost it'll turn
[49:19] into a law it'll turn into legalism
[49:21] you'll have a judgmental attitude but
[49:23] when you get the Holy Spirit it'll turn
[49:25] it into a work of of Love it'll turn it
[49:28] into relationship because here's one
[49:31] thing I know is that when you turn it
[49:32] into legalism you can never do it all
[49:35] and you'll condemn yourself eventually
[49:37] you'll condemn yourself eventually but
[49:39] notice What's Happening Here clashes are
[49:41] inevitable as I said something's got to
[49:44] give and what's happening is what Satan
[49:46] says about me or what people say about
[49:48] me or what I was born with starts to die
[49:51] out as the word starts to take effect by
[49:53] the quickening power of the Holy Spirit
[49:55] and I start to realize something
[49:57] I'm not who I thought I was and that
[49:59] brings a massive change in my life amen
[50:02] what is it I'm being lost to my own self
[50:05] and I'm being found in Christ I'm
[50:07] finding my identity in the word and what
[50:09] happens as you see as you become smaller
[50:12] and smaller and all truth absorbs
[50:14] everything that we
[50:15] are so what's next these are not in a
[50:18] particular order these are just the
[50:19] things the Lord laid on my heart to say
[50:21] tonight amen so they're not in an order
[50:23] but when when when religion drops away
[50:26] then what happens is you come into what
[50:30] spiritual
[50:31] maturity and you start to grow you're in
[50:33] a love relationship amen because the
[50:35] word is living through you and it's
[50:37] changed your desires amen and then the
[50:40] last thing is that you go and you're now
[50:42] no longer a slave but you're a son and
[50:44] you're a daughter of
[50:46] God and you recognize I'm not to be
[50:49] bound I don't have to bow down I don't
[50:53] have to let these things get the victory
[50:54] over me but I can stay in the the house
[50:58] I can dwell in the presence of God every
[51:00] single day of my life and have
[51:01] overcoming Victory and Power in every
[51:03] circumstance
[51:05] amen this is the last great
[51:08] revelation of the church is who she is
[51:12] brother Bram says when she recognizes
[51:14] who she is the rapture will go it's the
[51:17] last great one I was talking brother
[51:18] Garfield called me this afternoon we had
[51:20] a a wonderful chat about some of the
[51:22] things I've been preaching and some
[51:23] things he's been studying and and I and
[51:26] I I I relayed this idea because when we
[51:28] can see what he's trying to do it sets
[51:32] an expectation in our hearts for him to
[51:34] do
[51:35] it anden so that's why we read the word
[51:38] that's why we hear the word that's why
[51:39] the anointed word comes forth is it
[51:41] raises our sights to what God has in
[51:43] store for us that's what the holy spirit
[51:45] is doing is he's showing you things to
[51:47] come so that you'll believe for them so
[51:49] that you can see and receive what he has
[51:51] told you is going to come like I said
[51:53] before what's the point of telling us
[51:54] what's coming if he never comes he's
[51:57] there to take us into the truth of what
[51:59] he's shown us to come but look at this
[52:01] now we so close to the end here you is
[52:05] pretty much gone here it's almost
[52:07] completely all truth there's just a
[52:09] little sliver of you left but if you
[52:11] look on the bottom we've still got
[52:12] something that has to be
[52:14] resolved amen we're so close here if we
[52:17] were to look in the scripture we'd say
[52:18] that we're into the time of the quick
[52:20] short work it's 30 to 40 days left it's
[52:23] Christ now revealed through his bride
[52:24] and there's that quick short work of the
[52:26] de demonstration of the full power and
[52:28] authority of Christ and his bride but
[52:30] there's still one battle that has to be
[52:32] fought there's still one thing that has
[52:34] to be put under subjection and Paul
[52:36] talked about this in First Corinthians
[52:39] he says behold I show you a mystery we
[52:41] shall not all sleep but we shall all be
[52:43] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[52:46] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[52:48] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[52:50] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[52:52] notice it says last Trump that means
[52:55] there's been other trumpets before
[52:57] but this one is a resurrection and
[52:58] Rapture Trump amen he says for this
[53:01] corruptible must put on incorruption we
[53:04] saw that little sliver that was left
[53:05] what is it it's the carnal nature it's
[53:08] the flesh for this corruptible must put
[53:10] on incorruption and this Mortal must put
[53:13] on immortality so that when this
[53:15] corruptible shall have put on
[53:17] incorruption and this Mortal shall have
[53:19] put on immortality then shall be brought
[53:21] to pass the same that is written death
[53:24] is swallowed up in vict ictory he says
[53:27] oh death where is thy sting oh grave
[53:30] where is thy Victory see he's saying
[53:33] that because he's received eternal life
[53:34] by the Holy Spirit but this is a
[53:36] prophecy to the day when our faith shall
[53:39] be made sight where this in this
[53:41] corruptible puts on incorruption and we
[53:43] have a perfect body again he says the
[53:45] thing of death is sin the strength of
[53:48] sin is the law but thanks be to God
[53:50] which giveth us the victory through our
[53:52] Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved
[53:55] Brethren be ye
[53:57] steadfast
[53:59] unmovable always abounding in the work
[54:02] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[54:05] your labor is not in vain in the
[54:09] Lord amen there's just one thing that's
[54:11] left at the end of this journey church
[54:13] and it is all truth then we look here
[54:15] and what happens death is swallowed up
[54:17] in Victory Eternal Light see remember
[54:20] death is just a shadow eternal light is
[54:23] the light life is the light and so you
[54:25] can't have Darkness and light at the
[54:27] same time and so what happens is when
[54:28] that Holy Ghost it completely changes
[54:31] our body what does it do it swallows up
[54:34] death what go what happens to darkness
[54:36] when light comes it doesn't go away it
[54:39] ceases to exist it has no power it it's
[54:43] not even there anymore it literally is
[54:46] destroyed by light amen that's what he's
[54:48] saying it's swallowed up in Victory
[54:50] eternal life triumphs over flesh over
[54:53] the grave over death over hell and we're
[54:55] caught up in to the marriage supper of
[54:57] the Lamb that's what he's trying to do
[54:59] amen Church we're not Christians when we
[55:02] know the
[55:03] message we're Christians when we are the
[55:05] message that's what the holy spirit is
[55:07] doing is he's not revealing just head
[55:10] knowledge but he's trying to get us to
[55:11] the place where we have a living reality
[55:13] of the word in our lives and that's what
[55:16] the holy spirit's meant to do is to make
[55:18] it real in our lives that's why we're
[55:21] preaching this amen this church is going
[55:23] to be this I mean the bride of Christ
[55:25] not this church person Al or
[55:27] specifically we're the last Light we're
[55:30] the last witness we're the last
[55:32] revealing of Christ that's it when it's
[55:34] done we're gone and all that's left is
[55:37] Judgment amen Christ has returned in the
[55:39] form of the Holy Spirit brother Braham
[55:41] said to guide us into the living
[55:43] realities of the word of God that's what
[55:45] he's here to do to make it a reality
[55:47] Amen to take us all the way back to our
[55:49] conditions our original conditions you
[55:52] know when I was studying on this I
[55:53] thought about what a privilege we have
[55:55] you notice the world is talking a lot
[55:56] about privilege these days you want to
[55:58] talk about privilege God help them if
[56:00] they ever figure out what we believe
[56:02] because we are the most privileged
[56:04] people on this Earth we have eternal
[56:07] life we have an inheritance
[56:09] Incorruptible we have a city not made
[56:11] with hands We Rule and reign with Christ
[56:14] and we didn't choose it we didn't
[56:15] deserve it we can't earn it and we had
[56:18] nothing to do with it you talk about
[56:20] privilege you are the most privileged
[56:22] people in this world Amen by the unmar
[56:26] Grace favor and predestination of God
[56:29] Amen so what's our requirement then let
[56:33] the guide be the guide that's it's that
[56:36] simple let the guide be the guide let
[56:38] God be God and let him do what he's
[56:41] supposed to do surrender our thoughts
[56:43] surrender our opinions surrender our
[56:45] preferences surrender our Comforts to
[56:47] the direction and leading of the Holy
[56:49] Spirit and he'll take us all the way
[56:51] into our final destination Amen brother
[56:53] BR puts it this way he says the guide
[56:55] has understanding how to go and what to
[56:57] do God has always sent a guide to his
[57:00] people God has never failed he sends a
[57:03] guide but you've got to accept that
[57:05] guide see what does that look like he
[57:07] says you've got to believe it but you've
[57:10] got to and you've got to go the way he
[57:12] says if you get into a Wilderness and
[57:14] your guide says we go this way and yet
[57:16] you think you go that way you're going
[57:18] to come up lost God sends us a guide to
[57:21] guide us but we've got to follow that
[57:24] guide no matter what we think what looks
[57:27] reasonable what looks ridiculous we're
[57:30] not subjects to divide that the guide is
[57:33] the only
[57:34] one had a person call me up a while ago
[57:38] about some things they were dealing with
[57:39] not in this
[57:41] church and they gone to a
[57:44] minister and that Minister has a
[57:46] particular gift and using that gift he
[57:49] told them what they needed to do to come
[57:51] through their situation and this person
[57:53] did that for 3 days and then what
[57:56] happened is they doubted what he said
[57:58] and so they went and they did what
[58:00] anybody else would have
[58:03] done why because they weren't convinced
[58:06] of the guide they weren't convinced that
[58:10] what they said made sense and so what
[58:12] happened is they backed away because
[58:14] they thought their way was better and
[58:16] what they did is what anybody in the
[58:17] world would have done unfortunately
[58:19] brother B says this he says don't never
[58:20] dispute your gu's word follow him if you
[58:23] don't you come up lost he says and
[58:25] remember when you leave him you're on
[58:28] your own he says so we want to keep
[58:31] close to the guide so when this person
[58:34] talked to me it had been some months
[58:35] since this had happened and everything
[58:37] was in shambles and they said as much
[58:39] and they they tried to blame the
[58:40] minister and I said but you didn't do
[58:43] what he told you to do you did it for 3
[58:46] days and then you went and you did
[58:47] exactly what he told you not to do and
[58:50] now you're getting exactly what you
[58:51] would
[58:52] expect I said how can that be his fault
[58:55] if you didn't do
[58:56] if you didn't do what he told you to
[58:58] do you're on your own you walked away
[59:03] your life LED you to this mistake now
[59:06] somebody who has a gift tells you how to
[59:08] get out of it by the Holy Spirit and you
[59:11] say I'm going to keep doing according to
[59:13] my own thoughts it's never going to work
[59:16] your own thoughts got you into it
[59:17] they're never going to get you out
[59:19] that's the problem see we we're we're so
[59:21] silly sometimes we think that we somehow
[59:24] have gained something more than we have
[59:26] before but that what we had got us into
[59:29] the problem in the first place we're not
[59:31] going to get ourselves out by thinking
[59:33] we need a guide to get us out of those
[59:34] things amen what is it our ways of
[59:37] thinking are the ways of death they're
[59:39] destructive amen Jesus put or brother BR
[59:43] puts it this way he says when Jesus was
[59:44] here on Earth don't you remember Jesus
[59:46] said to the Pharisees you blind guides
[59:49] blind guides blind to spiritual things
[59:52] see now they were supposed to be guides
[59:54] to the people guiding the people to
[59:56] salvation but Jesus said you're blind
[59:58] and he said let them alone for if the
[1:00:00] blind lead the blind won't they both
[1:00:02] fall in the ditch blind guides he says
[1:00:05] oh how the world has been contaminated
[1:00:07] with that blind guiding don't we see it
[1:00:09] today what we see today is literally the
[1:00:12] effect of blind
[1:00:14] guides everything that's in this world
[1:00:16] the shambles that we have the the
[1:00:18] economics the politics the social
[1:00:20] structure all these different things the
[1:00:22] failures of men are on the basis of
[1:00:24] blind guides
[1:00:26] and it's not because they weren't trying
[1:00:27] to do right it's not because they
[1:00:30] weren't
[1:00:31] sincere some of them were self-serving
[1:00:33] yes but I believe there was many good
[1:00:35] men and women out there that have tried
[1:00:36] to lead and what did they do they've led
[1:00:39] us into destruction amen they led us
[1:00:42] into destruction he says he doesn't want
[1:00:45] you to rely on your own understanding
[1:00:48] God does not want you to rely on your
[1:00:50] understanding or your thoughts or any
[1:00:54] manmade thoughts
[1:00:56] that person I'm talking about's in a
[1:00:58] world of trouble today because they
[1:00:59] backed away from the guide that was
[1:01:01] given
[1:01:02] them and what is it they kept walking in
[1:01:04] the way of their own understanding and
[1:01:06] unless God steps in again they'll pay a
[1:01:09] heavy price for it there's a price to be
[1:01:11] paid brother BR says when you leave him
[1:01:13] you're on your own amen you may not
[1:01:17] you'll not lose your
[1:01:18] soul but there's a price that's going to
[1:01:20] be paid amen but I want to close on a I
[1:01:23] don't like to close on a negative note
[1:01:26] but as I was studying this you know
[1:01:28] we're talking about leading us into all
[1:01:29] truth leading us into the realities of
[1:01:31] the word lead us into eternal life and
[1:01:34] you know I I thought as I was
[1:01:36] thinkinking on this idea of a guide for
[1:01:37] life that we showed that last bit that
[1:01:40] great Victory is when death is swallowed
[1:01:42] up amen by eternal life and it reminded
[1:01:44] me of the Rapture scripture that brother
[1:01:46] brandham read and it never struck me one
[1:01:48] element of it until I was studying this
[1:01:50] but let's read it as we close this
[1:01:52] evening he says this the Lord is my
[1:01:55] light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[1:01:59] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:02:01] whom shall I be afraid when the wicked
[1:02:04] even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon
[1:02:06] me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[1:02:10] fell though an host should encamp
[1:02:13] against me my heart shall not fear
[1:02:15] though War should rise against me in
[1:02:18] this will I be confident you know what I
[1:02:19] was sitting in the Audi in the the
[1:02:21] office there I was thinking of Pilgrim's
[1:02:23] Progress and Christian comes up to a
[1:02:25] place
[1:02:26] remember and he can see the Lions
[1:02:28] waiting for him and yet he knows he's on
[1:02:31] the path to the celestial City but
[1:02:33] there's two lions that are there and
[1:02:35] they're roaring and they're reaching out
[1:02:37] and they're doing all this but the path
[1:02:39] that he has to go through leads to those
[1:02:41] lions and remember he stops and he waits
[1:02:44] and he's ready to back away and then a
[1:02:46] voice from the city says walk in the
[1:02:49] middle of the road they can't touch you
[1:02:53] as long as you stay in the road and what
[1:02:56] happened is they were chained there to
[1:02:57] cause fear but they had no right or
[1:03:00] access to the pilgrim walking the way of
[1:03:03] God Amen that's what David's talking
[1:03:06] about you can go through hard times and
[1:03:09] it looks like something's going to
[1:03:10] destroy you but it has no right to touch
[1:03:12] you or take you if you stay in his will
[1:03:14] and in his word but here's this thing as
[1:03:17] this is where we want to talk he says
[1:03:19] one thing have I desired of the Lord and
[1:03:23] that will I seek after this is the word
[1:03:25] in my mind that means that if you do
[1:03:26] what he says here you'll get what he's
[1:03:28] looking for he says that I may dwell
[1:03:31] this is his desire that I may dwell in
[1:03:34] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:03:37] life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[1:03:41] and to inquire in his Temple for in the
[1:03:44] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:03:46] Pavilion and in the secret of his
[1:03:49] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:03:52] me upon a rock you struck me as I was
[1:03:55] reading this say what is it that keeps
[1:03:57] us in his presence it's when we inquire
[1:04:01] after
[1:04:02] him when we ask him where do I go what
[1:04:06] do I do what do I say how do I respond
[1:04:10] how do I act what's your will what am I
[1:04:12] supposed to do what's he saying he's
[1:04:15] saying I go to my guide that's what
[1:04:18] keeps me in his presence that's what
[1:04:20] keeps me going forward is when I go to
[1:04:22] him and I say my life is in your hands
[1:04:24] Lord what would you have have your
[1:04:26] servant to do today and that's what
[1:04:29] keeps us moving that's what keeps us
[1:04:30] growing that's what keeps us going into
[1:04:32] all truth is because what we're doing is
[1:04:34] we're laying aside everything we think
[1:04:36] we know and we're saying Lord what would
[1:04:38] you do what would you have to say Amen
[1:04:41] let's stand if we
[1:04:42] would amen we need a
[1:04:46] guide I don't know about you but I've
[1:04:49] never walked this road before some of it
[1:04:52] looks
[1:04:54] familiar any they call it Deja Vu but
[1:04:57] there are times where I could swear I've
[1:04:59] been in places before and seen and and I
[1:05:01] know I've never been there but I know
[1:05:03] I've seen it before and sometimes I
[1:05:04] wonder if there isn't a a spiritual
[1:05:07] thing behind that where God's letting us
[1:05:09] see hey this was
[1:05:11] predestinated and I'm just giving you
[1:05:13] insight into what's going on in this
[1:05:14] situation even though you've never been
[1:05:16] here before amen but it's the guide of
[1:05:19] the holy spirit that leads us into all
[1:05:21] truth that we're looking for Amen
[1:05:22] brother BR would say he's the North Star
[1:05:24] he's always in the north he's unchanging
[1:05:27] he doesn't move it always takes us in
[1:05:30] the direction that he requires of us
[1:05:32] amen we're hidden in Christ amen and if
[1:05:35] we'll stay in that truth if we'll stay
[1:05:37] with that word it'll have a full effect
[1:05:39] on us amen amen God bless you let's bow
[1:05:42] our heads Heavenly
[1:05:46] Father Lord how thankful we are this Mo
[1:05:49] this evening L that we can say I once
[1:05:52] was lost but now I'm found Lord we were
[1:05:55] blind but but now we see Lord that we're
[1:05:57] walking this this this Highway of
[1:06:00] Holiness Lord that we're walking this
[1:06:02] road of eternal life Lord that we're
[1:06:04] walking in a way that takes us into your
[1:06:06] very presence Heavenly Father Lord and
[1:06:09] it's our comfort when we don't know
[1:06:11] where to go where we don't know what to
[1:06:13] do we don't know how to respond Lord
[1:06:15] that your spirit is here to Quicken your
[1:06:17] word and show us what you would have us
[1:06:19] to do Lord to give us peace to give us
[1:06:21] rest to give us Lord a a confirmation
[1:06:24] and an assurance that you're with us and
[1:06:25] you're in us every single day Lord I
[1:06:28] pray your grace to this little group
[1:06:29] that's gathered here this evening Lord
[1:06:32] that have patiently sat and listen to
[1:06:33] the word Lord that you would give us
[1:06:36] Lord that guide on a daily basis Lord
[1:06:38] that as David said Lord we would inquire
[1:06:40] of you daily Lord not just here and
[1:06:43] there not just when we wake up in the
[1:06:44] morning and when we put our head on our
[1:06:46] pillow Lord but throughout our entire
[1:06:48] day Lord may we seek after your presence
[1:06:50] and your will and your way Heavenly
[1:06:52] Father Lord it is time for us to get out
[1:06:56] Lord it is time for us to go the signs
[1:06:58] are all around us Lord there's a cry in
[1:07:00] our heart that says even so come Lord
[1:07:02] Jesus Lord but there's a light that has
[1:07:04] to be given Lord there's a witness that
[1:07:06] has to be there to catch that last
[1:07:08] predestinated seed Lord God lord I pray
[1:07:11] that that last one will come in by our
[1:07:13] witness and by your life inside of us
[1:07:15] Heavenly Father Lord that we would
[1:07:17] inspire people to seek the scriptures
[1:07:20] Lord and find the eternal life that's
[1:07:22] hidden in there Lord as our eyes will
[1:07:24] come open by your holy SP Spirit Lord

[1:07:28] testimony in everything we say and do we
