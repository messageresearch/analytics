[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] jesus name we ask
[52:31] amen
[52:32] amen thank you musicians
[52:35] amen if you'll turn the scriptures to
[52:37] second peter chapter one i flip that
[52:39] around sorry this morning second peter
[52:41] chapter one in the scriptures amen
[52:44] certainly seems like people came to have
[52:45] church this morning amen
[52:47] it's good to be joyful amen we ought to
[52:49] be joyful people we have a lot to be
[52:51] joyful for abraham said we ought to be
[52:53] the happiest people in the world amen
[52:55] and i believe we are this morning but
[52:57] it's certainly
[52:58] lord
[52:59] it helps the minister when he comes in
[53:01] and everybody's just in there and
[53:02] they're pulling and they're worshiping
[53:03] and there's a unity and and and we're
[53:05] all here for the same purpose amen and
[53:07] it's not to listen to me
[53:09] and then it's not to listen to me but
[53:10] it's to hear the word of god this
[53:12] morning certainly in anticipation for
[53:14] the special meetings just add one thing
[53:15] we will have brother joe speaking on
[53:17] wednesday night as well so we'll have
[53:19] four services with brother joe um so
[53:21] certainly keep him in prayer and and
[53:23] sister jessica's wife as they travel
[53:24] that all things would just go well but
[53:26] uh just hold things on your heart
[53:28] the beauty of a visiting minister is he
[53:29] knows nothing i don't talk to visiting
[53:31] ministers like i said about anything
[53:33] that i might see or perceive in the
[53:34] church but we let the holy spirit just
[53:36] have free reign in our lives so amen if
[53:38] you have a need if you look at you're
[53:40] looking for a change whatever it might
[53:42] be if you're looking for more of god if
[53:44] you're looking for healing if you're
[53:46] looking for deliverance whatever it
[53:47] might be just hold these things on your
[53:48] heart come expecting and trust god to
[53:50] minister to your life amen
[53:53] amen second peter chapter
[53:55] 1 and verse 1 says simon peter a servant
[53:58] and an apostle of jesus christ to them
[54:01] that have obtained like precious faith
[54:04] with us through the righteousness of god
[54:06] and our savior jesus christ now notice
[54:08] who's receiving this message it's those
[54:10] that have the same precious faith peter
[54:13] says and it's the same faith of the
[54:14] apostles and they've received it in a
[54:16] particular way and it's through the
[54:18] righteousness of god and our savior
[54:20] jesus christ verse 2 says grace and
[54:22] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[54:24] knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
[54:27] according as his divine power had given
[54:30] unto us
[54:31] a few things
[54:32] many things no it says all things
[54:36] all things that pertain to two things
[54:39] life
[54:40] and godliness what that means is
[54:42] everything that you have need of he has
[54:44] given you through jesus christ amen
[54:47] through the knowledge of him that hath
[54:49] called us to glory and virtue
[54:53] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[54:55] great and precious promises
[54:57] that by these ye might be partakers of
[54:59] the divine nature having escaped the
[55:02] corruption that is in the world through
[55:03] lust catch that exceeding great and
[55:06] precious promises this is not some limp
[55:08] promise this is not a half dying plant
[55:10] that he's given you as a gift but he's
[55:12] giving you something that is great and
[55:13] exceeding what that means is it is more
[55:15] than you realize
[55:17] right sometimes we think well it's a lot
[55:19] but exceeding means that you think it's
[55:20] this much and it's this much more than
[55:23] actually what you're thinking it's
[55:24] beyond what we can ask or think is
[55:26] really what he's saying everything we
[55:27] have need of and then some is what he
[55:30] has prepared for us and given to us in
[55:31] these precious promises amen and besides
[55:35] this giving all diligence add to your
[55:37] faith virtue and divert your knowledge
[55:40] into knowledge temperance and to
[55:41] temperance patience and the patience
[55:44] godliness and to godliness brotherly
[55:46] kindness and to brotherly kindness
[55:48] charity for if these things be in you
[55:51] okay there's a condition now for if
[55:53] these things be in you and abound
[55:56] so not just a little bit but they're in
[55:58] you and they're growing they're
[56:00] increasing inside of you they shall make
[56:03] you that you shall be neither barren
[56:05] nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
[56:09] lord jesus christ amen you can have your
[56:11] seats this morning god bless
[56:13] the reading of his word amen
[56:15] we want to continue this morning on our
[56:17] our little mini series on authority to
[56:19] believe and i want to take a a a little
[56:21] portion here called how do i get faith
[56:23] amen now last service we covered fairly
[56:25] extensively what faith is and i think
[56:28] maybe some of us realize it's a bit more
[56:29] than what we thought because it it looks
[56:31] beyond just the idea of faith but it
[56:32] looks to god and it looks to the love of
[56:34] god and it looks to the will of god and
[56:36] and these many different things but once
[56:38] we know what it is we want to know how
[56:40] do i get it now i want to say up front
[56:42] that this is a bit of a trick question
[56:44] you say how do i get faith well we know
[56:46] it's a revelation of the will of god and
[56:47] it's tied to these different things but
[56:49] we look at faith kind of as something
[56:51] like you'd have in a cup of water and i
[56:53] want to get more faith so i want to take
[56:54] what's in the cup and i want to pour it
[56:56] into my life but we'll see as we go here
[56:58] that
[56:59] it's not about having more or less
[57:01] because remember we spoke that brother
[57:03] brahm said when god gives you the holy
[57:05] spirit he gives you everything that you
[57:07] have need of to take you off of this
[57:08] earth amen so the faith of christ the
[57:11] very faith of god is within us as
[57:14] believers when we receive the holy
[57:15] spirit paul talked about he said the
[57:17] life that i now live i live by the faith
[57:19] of jesus christ so the faith that he has
[57:21] is no different than the faith we have
[57:23] and it is this like precious faith that
[57:25] peter is talking about it's all the same
[57:27] faith and the question is not how much
[57:29] do you have it's how much will you give
[57:31] it free reign in your life how much will
[57:33] you allow to have an effect in your life
[57:35] because you'll see as we get into it
[57:37] today we have hindrances and we have
[57:38] these little sins that easily beset us
[57:40] little unbeliefs little attitudes and
[57:42] these different things that hold us back
[57:44] so the question is not how do i get it
[57:46] so much as how do i let it have an
[57:48] effect in my life and faith all it is
[57:50] what we're talking about we say well
[57:52] well i went from from not having faith
[57:54] to having faith because i went from not
[57:56] being able to be healed to be healed and
[57:57] i got more faith no what you went was
[57:59] was a place of your faith being
[58:01] ineffective to your faith being
[58:03] effective the faith was always there you
[58:05] just had to get it to a place where it
[58:06] could actually do what it was supposed
[58:07] to do but it was always there within you
[58:10] and i i think that's a consolation to
[58:11] the believer because what it means is
[58:13] you don't have to do something to get it
[58:15] you already have it you just have to let
[58:17] it work inside of you is really what
[58:19] we're talking about amen so so faith
[58:21] moves you from the i don't believe
[58:24] to the i believe side all it's doing is
[58:26] it's shifting you from i'm not too sure
[58:27] about this to i know very sure that this
[58:30] is for me and this is what god has given
[58:32] me amen so we'll see that faith is
[58:34] actually more like a seed than it is a
[58:36] cup of water you don't just pour it in
[58:38] but it's something that you allow to
[58:39] grow and have effect in your life and
[58:42] move into every aspect of your life
[58:44] because it has potential it's not just a
[58:45] little bit here and a little bit there
[58:46] but it's something that has potential
[58:48] and it's growing to something and and
[58:49] we'll see as certainly not maybe in this
[58:51] service but in other services where
[58:53] jesus likens the word of god to what a
[58:55] seed because it has everything it has
[58:57] need of inside of it but it's growing
[58:58] and maturing inside the believer
[59:01] amen now i wanted to start in this
[59:03] scripture in ii peter because i'm
[59:04] speaking to believers this morning amen
[59:06] we're not going to talk to the
[59:07] unbelievers this morning we have
[59:09] believers sitting here amen are we
[59:11] believers this morning then let's focus
[59:13] on what he said about the believers
[59:14] let's not focus on what this one might
[59:16] do or what that one might do or or what
[59:18] what if you're halfway in if you're an
[59:19] unbeliever but let's look at it from a
[59:21] position of like precious faith as peter
[59:24] put put it because there are some
[59:25] nuances to faith there are some nuances
[59:27] to faith and you'll see that
[59:29] you have the roman centurion in
[59:30] scripture and guess what he's not a
[59:32] believer in the sense of he is not a man
[59:34] that gave his life to the one true god
[59:36] but yet he came in faith he asked and he
[59:39] received but jesus never asked anything
[59:41] more of him he said this is what i want
[59:44] and he said okay i'll come lay hands on
[59:46] him and he said no no don't do that just
[59:47] say the word and he'll be okay and jesus
[59:49] said wow i haven't seen faith like this
[59:50] in all of israel but jesus didn't say do
[59:53] you believe in god or he didn't say have
[59:55] you been baptized according to the
[59:57] baptism of john or will you be my
[59:59] disciple he just said you believe i'll
[1:00:01] give you what you ask for
[1:00:03] but you'll see he goes to other people
[1:00:04] and he asks something of them and
[1:00:06] brother branham when he had people
[1:00:07] coming through the prayer line he would
[1:00:09] treat believers different than
[1:00:10] unbelievers now i spent quite some time
[1:00:13] just in the office this morning looking
[1:00:15] through it because i was listening to
[1:00:16] another uh a couple messages this week
[1:00:19] where he has people come through the
[1:00:20] prayer line and he he goes and he's he's
[1:00:23] talking to him he says now you're not a
[1:00:24] christian
[1:00:25] you're not a believer and what does he
[1:00:27] do he says will you accept christ as
[1:00:30] your savior
[1:00:31] they'll say yes and then he says then in
[1:00:33] jesus christ's name i give you your
[1:00:35] healing or i pronounce you healed or
[1:00:37] your cancer is gone are these different
[1:00:38] things but when the believer comes
[1:00:40] through what does he do before anybody
[1:00:41] comes up he says if you have unconfessed
[1:00:44] sin in your life get it under the blood
[1:00:47] because he says in that presence every
[1:00:49] sin will be revealed and i was listening
[1:00:51] to to a testimony the other day
[1:00:53] and one of his his business managers one
[1:00:55] of his campaign managers said i never
[1:00:58] saw it fail up there but that if
[1:01:00] unconfessed sin came up he said you've
[1:01:02] got to make that right you can't come
[1:01:04] through the line you can't get your
[1:01:05] healing you can't have faith for healing
[1:01:08] even unless you've got your life lined
[1:01:10] up with the word and your sins are under
[1:01:11] the blood amen now it doesn't mean that
[1:01:13] a believer can't have any promise in the
[1:01:15] bible but it means that if you need a
[1:01:17] promise you've got to line up with the
[1:01:19] word and that means you have to be
[1:01:20] repented it means your sins have to be
[1:01:22] under the blood it means that your life
[1:01:24] has to be made right according to the
[1:01:25] scripture before god will even allow
[1:01:27] your faith to take a hold of the word
[1:01:29] the same way that it should amen there's
[1:01:31] something that he requires of us we are
[1:01:33] a church we are the called out people
[1:01:35] and he has a different standard for us
[1:01:36] than everybody else amen so we don't
[1:01:38] just walk around doing things
[1:01:40] willy-nilly and then come in and say god
[1:01:41] i'm here for your promises no he has an
[1:01:43] expectation of his sons and daughters
[1:01:45] and that's that they live by the faith
[1:01:47] of jesus christ so their life shall be
[1:01:48] reflecting that and unless if it doesn't
[1:01:50] he says you've got to make it right
[1:01:52] before i'm going to deal with you in
[1:01:53] this sort of thing amen you're going to
[1:01:54] have a barrier between you right
[1:01:57] now brother banham if you remember this
[1:01:58] story i'm going to read a quote here for
[1:02:00] in a second where remember he had that
[1:02:02] woman come up and she cheated on her
[1:02:03] husband
[1:02:05] and she had a very bad disease and and
[1:02:07] he said he pulled her aside says now you
[1:02:09] can't i can't pray for you because
[1:02:12] you've got unconfessed sin and you've
[1:02:13] got to do this you know and and she says
[1:02:15] well i i already i already confessed it
[1:02:18] to god and this is what brother branham
[1:02:20] says he says i said it wasn't god you
[1:02:22] sinned against it was your husband and
[1:02:25] if you'd have been a single woman it'd
[1:02:27] have been different he says if you're a
[1:02:28] single woman you went you you you know
[1:02:30] you had relations with a man he says you
[1:02:32] just confess that to god because you
[1:02:33] don't have any obligation to anyone else
[1:02:35] he says but you sinned against your
[1:02:36] marriage vow she said well brother
[1:02:38] so-and-so told me and i said sister that
[1:02:40] doesn't have anything to do with it
[1:02:41] that's unconfessed sin and they could
[1:02:43] pour oil on your head till they got a
[1:02:45] gallon on there they could stomp and
[1:02:47] kick and snort and run across the
[1:02:48] platform and scream and holler they
[1:02:50] could have a good old gospel jubilee
[1:02:52] but he says it wouldn't make a lick of
[1:02:53] difference he says that devil will stay
[1:02:56] right there he's got a right to
[1:03:00] and as long as he's got a right to stay
[1:03:02] there he will hold his ground in other
[1:03:03] words the devil ain't going to move if
[1:03:05] you've got unconfessed sin in your life
[1:03:06] because he doesn't have to he has a
[1:03:08] place of holding there he's got a
[1:03:09] fortress there in that unconfessed sin
[1:03:11] that darkness is where he will hide amen
[1:03:14] because it's unconfessed sin i've said
[1:03:16] i've done all she said i just can't do
[1:03:18] it i said now sister you come here and
[1:03:21] god in his mercy has revealed what your
[1:03:23] trouble is go make that right with your
[1:03:26] husband and you'll get well if you don't
[1:03:28] then i've done all i can
[1:03:30] she said i just can't do it she said
[1:03:32] it'll break up my home i said all right
[1:03:35] i just was god's servant i've done what
[1:03:37] god did me to boot to do so he says i've
[1:03:39] done my part the holy spirit's here it
[1:03:41] has revealed your trouble but it is also
[1:03:43] revealed you've got a problem in your
[1:03:44] life that you have to deal with and
[1:03:46] until you deal with it you cannot move
[1:03:48] on with healing you can't do it now the
[1:03:50] grace to this woman was when she goes to
[1:03:52] walk away and brother branham catches a
[1:03:54] vision he says your husband is such and
[1:03:56] such
[1:03:57] and he was with us so and so and he says
[1:03:59] your husband cheated on a woman the way
[1:04:01] you cheated with the man and she said
[1:04:03] then i can go confess now because he's
[1:04:05] done the same thing i did makes it
[1:04:06] easier for me what she means is it's not
[1:04:08] going to break up my home because he did
[1:04:10] the same thing i did if we can just
[1:04:11] forgive each other we can move on but he
[1:04:13] didn't say that to the prostitute amen
[1:04:15] all he said was will you accept christ
[1:04:17] as your savior yes then he says then
[1:04:18] i'll give then then i'll pray for you
[1:04:20] and god will heal you
[1:04:21] he didn't follow up with him after but
[1:04:23] he does say if you're not sincere if you
[1:04:25] don't go and do that it'll come back on
[1:04:26] you
[1:04:27] right so there is a standard there is a
[1:04:29] requirement for those to come that know
[1:04:32] christ to come in under the shed blood
[1:04:33] amen you've got to have everything under
[1:04:35] the blood you've got to be a prepared
[1:04:37] vessel amen brother branham says this he
[1:04:39] says here we are tonight right in the
[1:04:41] shadows of the coming of the son of god
[1:04:43] and yet we find the church in an anemic
[1:04:45] condition we ought to be great strong
[1:04:48] mighty warriors of faith that would
[1:04:50] shake a nation
[1:04:52] god gives it to us we would just receive
[1:04:55] it so there's little things upon us that
[1:04:57] holds us back from running now we're
[1:04:59] talking about how do i get faith or how
[1:05:00] do i let faith have have reign in my
[1:05:03] life let's lay aside all those little
[1:05:05] weights now because we're looking to the
[1:05:07] author and finisher of our faith jesus
[1:05:09] christ who has made man on earth and
[1:05:11] dwelt among us and was made sin that
[1:05:14] through his righteousness we might be
[1:05:15] forgiven of our sins
[1:05:17] and when we see that
[1:05:20] it ought to attract the attention of
[1:05:22] every man and woman to lay aside every
[1:05:25] little skeptic talk
[1:05:29] oh i love that he says lay aside every
[1:05:31] weight and the little unbelief
[1:05:34] that does so easily beside us some
[1:05:36] little something come up and we say well
[1:05:38] i never heard of that before search it
[1:05:40] out in the scripture if it's in the
[1:05:42] bible stay with it amen so what's he
[1:05:44] saying he's talking to sons and
[1:05:45] daughters and he's saying what let's
[1:05:46] cast off every little sin that easily
[1:05:48] besets us every little unbelief every
[1:05:51] little twig every little he calls it
[1:05:53] that little skeptic talk right it's an
[1:05:55] attitude sometimes i speaking to myself
[1:05:57] that little cynical attitude that little
[1:05:59] skeptical attitude that would say that's
[1:06:01] not god doing that
[1:06:03] not just that's not god that person's
[1:06:05] not healed but it can be that's not god
[1:06:07] speaking over the pulpit that's not such
[1:06:09] and such no you put it into what the
[1:06:11] realm of flesh and it's god i was
[1:06:13] listening to brother branham the other
[1:06:14] day where he said a man was in his
[1:06:16] meetings and he wrote him a 20-yard page
[1:06:17] letter just ripping the hide off of him
[1:06:20] and saying that basically brother brown
[1:06:21] was wrong and the brother brahm says my
[1:06:23] dear brother he says first off i forgive
[1:06:26] you
[1:06:27] because he says you just called the holy
[1:06:29] what the holy spirit was doing of the
[1:06:31] devil and he says i forgive you and i
[1:06:33] pray that god will forgive you in your
[1:06:35] ignorance he said this a man had been
[1:06:36] preaching for 30 40 50 years whatever it
[1:06:38] was he said i forgive you and i pray
[1:06:40] that god will do it because why he took
[1:06:42] the working of the holy spirit he said
[1:06:43] that's a man
[1:06:45] and it's wrong
[1:06:47] and it wasn't
[1:06:48] it was the messenger of the age god
[1:06:50] working in a body yet again
[1:06:52] right
[1:06:53] right
[1:06:54] walking amongst us doing the exact same
[1:06:56] work and he said that is not of god it's
[1:06:59] the same thing they did to jesus he said
[1:07:00] i pray that he forgives you amen but he
[1:07:02] says what these little things because
[1:07:04] what a lot of little hindrances add up
[1:07:06] to one big hindrance and then sometimes
[1:07:08] we're saying well that doesn't really
[1:07:09] matter but when you get a bunch of
[1:07:11] little doesn't really matter added
[1:07:13] together it makes up one big thing that
[1:07:14] does matter and it'll stop up that flu
[1:07:17] amen and so faith can't flow through it
[1:07:18] as a flu flue it's like a chimney you
[1:07:20] know it's a something that smoke's
[1:07:22] supposed to flow out of and if you don't
[1:07:24] have that opened up then it clogs it up
[1:07:26] and all of a sudden it puts the fire out
[1:07:27] amen
[1:07:29] now the reason that we started in second
[1:07:30] peter this morning is because believers
[1:07:32] have a foundation of faith and then
[1:07:34] we're talking about faith how do i get
[1:07:36] it how do i let it have a free reign in
[1:07:38] my life and that's the starting place
[1:07:39] because the foundation of every believer
[1:07:41] is faith in jesus christ amen and that
[1:07:43] first faith that we have is for our
[1:07:45] salvation as we talked about last
[1:07:47] service and then from there it moves on
[1:07:49] to that amen but you can't believe
[1:07:51] anything unless you have faith faith is
[1:07:53] literally the definition of true belief
[1:07:55] right if you don't have faith you don't
[1:07:57] believe and you won't act on these
[1:07:59] different things and and the jesus will
[1:08:01] put it this way he says in matthew 23
[1:08:03] says heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:08:05] my word shall not pass away you've got
[1:08:07] to have faith in something and i'm
[1:08:08] pointing you to where jesus says my
[1:08:10] words won't pass away you have to have
[1:08:12] faith in something that won't pass away
[1:08:14] otherwise your faith will pass away
[1:08:15] along with the thing that does pass away
[1:08:17] if you put it in a man that man passes
[1:08:19] away then all of a sudden then your
[1:08:20] faith is gone you put it in a church you
[1:08:22] put it in a one-time experience outside
[1:08:24] of the new birth you put it in your
[1:08:26] worship your ability to shout praise
[1:08:28] whatever it might be if that's where
[1:08:30] your faith is it's going to fail every
[1:08:31] time but jesus says my words will never
[1:08:33] pass away so you have a sure foundation
[1:08:35] right there
[1:08:36] then paul would come along and say so
[1:08:38] faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:08:40] the word of god how do i get faith
[1:08:42] here's your main scripture faith comes
[1:08:43] by hearing and hearing by the word of
[1:08:45] god now brother branham explains he says
[1:08:48] first faith cometh by hearing and
[1:08:49] hearing of the word of god then the
[1:08:51] believer hears it recognizes it and acts
[1:08:54] on it
[1:08:55] that's a true sign of faith hear it
[1:08:57] recognize it and then you act on it the
[1:08:59] carnal man will hear it the sound of it
[1:09:02] but never act on it amen here means to
[1:09:05] understand look at is something this is
[1:09:08] look at is looking at something but to
[1:09:10] see it is to understand it and except a
[1:09:13] man be born again he cannot see or
[1:09:15] understand the kingdom of god remember
[1:09:17] laying another foundation this morning
[1:09:19] faith is not based upon a myth and a
[1:09:21] pump something that well just says go do
[1:09:23] this or that
[1:09:24] guess what you're going to have what i
[1:09:26] would call unctions in your life to go
[1:09:27] do this or go do that and that does not
[1:09:30] make it god
[1:09:31] guess what there's people all over the
[1:09:32] world have things that tell them go do
[1:09:34] this and go do that that doesn't make it
[1:09:36] god that just makes it an influence
[1:09:38] that's trying to get them to do
[1:09:39] something he says on the words of some
[1:09:41] men but faith takes his eternal resting
[1:09:44] place upon the word of the lord upon
[1:09:46] god's word which is the bible
[1:09:50] and everything without faith is sin
[1:09:52] unbelief is absolutely sin everything
[1:09:54] that's not of faith is not of god
[1:09:57] wow
[1:09:58] everything that's not of faith is not of
[1:10:00] god
[1:10:02] you must believe and the only way you
[1:10:05] can have faith is first see what god
[1:10:08] said about it and then believe his word
[1:10:10] that's true that's the only way you can
[1:10:12] do it so go looking if you have if
[1:10:14] you're looking for faith go looking in
[1:10:16] the word of god
[1:10:17] that's always the first place it's the
[1:10:19] only place to start amen
[1:10:21] he said i was certainly packed away
[1:10:22] while standing there listening to
[1:10:23] brother depletis bring that message on
[1:10:25] the apostle peter being able to walk on
[1:10:27] the water something he never did before
[1:10:30] and we can do just just do many things
[1:10:32] we never did before if we'll just listen
[1:10:35] to his word and take his word for it
[1:10:38] he never made a promise but what he will
[1:10:41] stand behind
[1:10:42] amen last he says now expectations it
[1:10:45] has to be built upon something that's
[1:10:47] got a faith behind it
[1:10:49] because if you're expecting something
[1:10:51] it's because something's been promised
[1:10:53] or some way like that so if you want to
[1:10:55] have real expectations it must be built
[1:10:58] upon thus saith the lord
[1:11:01] that's where the soul rests amen is on
[1:11:03] thus saith the lord now that's the word
[1:11:05] of god for the believer it's the word of
[1:11:07] god now god can send a prophet or he can
[1:11:09] send a prophecy or these different
[1:11:11] things i would say thus saith the lord
[1:11:12] but day to day
[1:11:14] our thus saith the lord is this
[1:11:17] this
[1:11:18] amen not the messages this is thus saith
[1:11:21] the lord because what did the messages
[1:11:22] do come to point us back to this amen so
[1:11:26] why are we only listening to messages
[1:11:27] and not reading our bibles why do we
[1:11:29] quote brother branham more than we quote
[1:11:30] the scripture we're out of balance i
[1:11:32] would say he's pointing us back to the
[1:11:34] faith of this so we need to get back
[1:11:35] into this amen not putting him aside by
[1:11:38] any means i use quotes i use quotes
[1:11:39] quotes quotes quotes quotes not point
[1:11:41] down but i'm saying those quotes ought
[1:11:43] to be quickening this we're not looking
[1:11:45] for the quickening power of the quotes
[1:11:46] we're looking for the quickening power
[1:11:47] of the word that the quotes point us to
[1:11:49] amen because that's where the life is is
[1:11:51] in the word amen but brother brahm says
[1:11:53] our faith for the believer is on one
[1:11:55] resting place alone and that is thus
[1:11:58] saith the lord which is the word of god
[1:12:00] that is the word of god now the word of
[1:12:02] god is not bound to this like i said we
[1:12:05] can have somebody raise up in church
[1:12:06] under the inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:12:08] and say thus saith the lord give a
[1:12:10] prophecy and it will be that and if they
[1:12:12] are truly anointed and it comes to pass
[1:12:14] and that's thus saith the lord we can
[1:12:16] have that but our day-to-day thus saith
[1:12:18] the lord is the word of god amen amen so
[1:12:20] i don't understand then when people go
[1:12:22] looking for what the word doesn't say
[1:12:24] they're looking for loopholes because it
[1:12:26] doesn't make sense to look for loopholes
[1:12:28] because your faith is built on something
[1:12:30] and if you're looking for a loophole
[1:12:31] your faith is built on
[1:12:33] nothing
[1:12:35] how can you have faith if you're looking
[1:12:36] for a loophole there's nothing to base
[1:12:38] it on they're saying well the word
[1:12:39] doesn't say i can't do it but the word
[1:12:41] says there's a bunch of stuff you can
[1:12:43] and should do so focus on what it says
[1:12:45] you can and should do don't look for the
[1:12:46] loophole because you can't have faith in
[1:12:48] a loophole you can only have faith on
[1:12:50] the solid word of god so focus on what
[1:12:52] god said
[1:12:53] he gave us his word to do something so
[1:12:55] don't go looking for what he didn't say
[1:12:57] because there's no faith in it
[1:12:59] right go for where the faith is and
[1:13:00] that's in what he said amen focus on
[1:13:02] what he gave not on on what he didn't
[1:13:04] give
[1:13:05] listen the way brother brown says he
[1:13:06] says now we believe can god do god can
[1:13:08] do things that's not written in this
[1:13:09] word we believe that
[1:13:11] because we've seen it guess what i saw a
[1:13:14] testimony this morning from brother tim
[1:13:15] pruitt's church where that uh one of the
[1:13:18] little girls in their church fell down
[1:13:19] she broke her arm and her arm was like
[1:13:21] this like this and then like this like
[1:13:23] an s shape
[1:13:24] a bad bad break
[1:13:27] and she fell down and and they took her
[1:13:29] to the hospital and the surgeon said
[1:13:30] we're gonna have to do some major
[1:13:31] surgery here we're going to put multiple
[1:13:33] pins in what not and they prayed for her
[1:13:35] and they took her back
[1:13:37] at the appointed time to go in there and
[1:13:38] they said let's do another x-ray and
[1:13:40] when they looked in everything had gone
[1:13:41] back into alignment they said all she
[1:13:42] needs is a cast
[1:13:44] amen what is it god didn't put that in
[1:13:46] the scripture you can't go to the
[1:13:48] scripture and say we're god aligned
[1:13:49] bones that were so completely badly
[1:13:51] broken that somebody would have to get
[1:13:52] pins and surgery
[1:13:54] but the prayer of faith caused it to
[1:13:56] happen amen amen but we're looking to
[1:13:59] put our faith on what he said and what
[1:14:00] he said is i am the lord that healeth
[1:14:02] all thy diseases amen and that's where
[1:14:04] we look is not in the specifics but in
[1:14:06] the generality of that sort of thing he
[1:14:08] says but we like to stay just with what
[1:14:10] he has written then we know we're sure
[1:14:13] if you just stay with what he's written
[1:14:14] in his word that's where i want to stay
[1:14:16] amen this is more than enough
[1:14:18] that's more than enough we don't need to
[1:14:20] add to it and we certainly don't need to
[1:14:21] take away from it this is more than
[1:14:22] enough it was more than enough for the
[1:14:24] apostles it's more than enough for us
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:27] he said his word is always the truth
[1:14:29] it's always the truth his believing
[1:14:32] children believe for it
[1:14:34] and cry for it until his word is
[1:14:36] vindicated and his word is always his
[1:14:39] will if you want to know what the will
[1:14:41] of god is find it in the bible
[1:14:44] it's god's word anything contrary to it
[1:14:47] is perverted
[1:14:49] and don't get into that hybrid condition
[1:14:51] what god said that's the truth amen so
[1:14:54] as we said before the first time you see
[1:14:55] this kind of faith is when you what
[1:14:57] except jesus christ as your savior by
[1:14:59] acts 2 38 amen repent be baptized in the
[1:15:02] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:15:04] of sins and you receive the gift of the
[1:15:05] holy spirit
[1:15:06] and the reason that's critical is
[1:15:08] because everything you do after that is
[1:15:09] based on that same faith and we'll get
[1:15:11] into here where brother braham says it's
[1:15:13] the same faith the same faith that saves
[1:15:15] you is the faith that heals you is the
[1:15:16] faith that delivers you is the faith
[1:15:18] that provides for you and all of these
[1:15:19] different things it starts on the faith
[1:15:22] that when you accepted christ as your
[1:15:23] savior and you moved on in faith to the
[1:15:26] full baptism of the holy spirit and then
[1:15:27] it just starts to grow and mature inside
[1:15:29] of you amen why why is that critical
[1:15:32] because that's the first place where you
[1:15:33] take god at his word that's right acts 2
[1:15:35] 38 is the first place where you take god
[1:15:37] at his word
[1:15:38] as a person personally amen acts 2 38 so
[1:15:42] everything comes off of acts 2 38 and
[1:15:44] guess what if you look in the scriptures
[1:15:46] they didn't do anything until they had
[1:15:47] the same experience of acts 2 38.
[1:15:50] so their experience built off the exact
[1:15:51] same thing they repented they believed
[1:15:53] they got the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:15:54] then afterwards you can move on to
[1:15:56] isaiah 53 where by his stripes we are
[1:15:58] healed and all of these different things
[1:15:59] but it's got to start with that acts 2
[1:16:01] 38.
[1:16:02] amen but it's accepting the promise it's
[1:16:04] accepting the promise by faith that when
[1:16:06] you step towards him he's going to step
[1:16:08] towards you and he's going to give you
[1:16:09] the promise of the holy spirit in your
[1:16:11] life
[1:16:12] he says now to these that are
[1:16:13] open-hearted to god's word by faith i
[1:16:15] plant the seed i plant it in the name of
[1:16:17] jesus christ in faith in god but lord
[1:16:20] jesus i committed to you now water it
[1:16:23] send the spirit upon it lord that
[1:16:25] germatized word there that you're the
[1:16:27] same great god to heal the same great
[1:16:31] god to save the same great god and
[1:16:33] resurrection you are god may i produce a
[1:16:36] crop a bride for the lord jesus a
[1:16:39] sanctified womb of the heart to receive
[1:16:41] the word he says granted lord i commend
[1:16:44] them to you to pick from here lord if
[1:16:46] possible everyone your bride in the name
[1:16:49] of jesus christ
[1:16:51] amen
[1:16:52] it's all the same god it's the same god
[1:16:54] that's healing he says what you're the
[1:16:56] great god to heal the great god to save
[1:16:57] the great god and resurrection you are
[1:16:59] god he says it's all the same god and
[1:17:01] then he comes and he says it's the same
[1:17:02] faith he says it's in the same atonement
[1:17:04] that the finished work was completed at
[1:17:06] calvary by our blessed lord and it's
[1:17:08] your personal faith in the finished work
[1:17:11] of christ at calvary that brings both
[1:17:13] salvation and healing
[1:17:16] he says it's your personal faith not
[1:17:18] meaning it's the faith that you built up
[1:17:20] but it's the faith that you have your
[1:17:22] personal faith the faith that god has
[1:17:23] given you as we said it's not of faith
[1:17:26] or works that any man should boast but
[1:17:28] it's by what faith through grace that we
[1:17:31] have it but he says you have a personal
[1:17:32] level of faith and that's given to you
[1:17:34] and it's no different for your salvation
[1:17:36] than it is for your healing it's just
[1:17:38] applied differently
[1:17:39] that's in as in it's applied to a
[1:17:41] different portion of the word but all
[1:17:43] you're doing is accepting the same word
[1:17:44] of god amen but then brother branham
[1:17:46] would would say he gently admonished the
[1:17:48] church because he'd say you ought to
[1:17:50] have more faith than you have
[1:17:52] you ought to be further along than you
[1:17:54] are but he gently admonished and watch
[1:17:56] how he does is this because he'd always
[1:17:58] point to god's provision amen amen we
[1:18:01] aren't what we ought to be many times
[1:18:03] and he says but god has made a provision
[1:18:05] for when you fail or when you fall short
[1:18:07] he says no man could save you no matter
[1:18:10] how much he'd pray for you you're only
[1:18:12] saved by faith no man can heal you
[1:18:14] you're only healed by faith now you
[1:18:16] ought to read the word and not even have
[1:18:18] to have a preacher just stand there and
[1:18:20] read the word and believe it
[1:18:22] he says that's how simple it ought to be
[1:18:25] he says but god is love and he sends
[1:18:28] preachers around he anoints preachers
[1:18:29] and they preach the word they see it on
[1:18:31] the word and they preach the baptism of
[1:18:33] the spirit being born again and you
[1:18:35] believe it accept it and get born again
[1:18:38] is that right he says you ought to be
[1:18:39] able to get that just by reading the
[1:18:41] bible but he says no but god is love so
[1:18:43] he sends you love gifts and it sees men
[1:18:46] he says now you ought to believe divine
[1:18:48] healing but if you don't believe divine
[1:18:50] healing
[1:18:52] then god sends ministers around
[1:18:53] preaching divine healing you accept it
[1:18:55] believe it and you get healed now since
[1:18:58] those works has been going on for many
[1:18:59] years god in his mercy has done
[1:19:01] something else for us which is send his
[1:19:03] angel from glory to manifest to his
[1:19:05] people the prophetic gift of god which
[1:19:07] can only bring faith up into the level
[1:19:10] to where you can be healed or accept
[1:19:12] your healing from jesus christ amen
[1:19:15] ephesians says that he gave gifts to men
[1:19:18] so the men themselves have gifts as a
[1:19:19] spirit but the men themselves are gifts
[1:19:22] to the church that's what he's saying is
[1:19:23] he's saying god loves you so much he
[1:19:25] gives gifted men to you to help raise
[1:19:27] your faith to do what accept the word
[1:19:30] and act on it amen right so when brother
[1:19:32] joe gets up here that's a gift of god to
[1:19:35] us when brother joe comes that's a gift
[1:19:37] of god to us when brother ed hammond
[1:19:39] reister comes that's a gift of god to us
[1:19:41] whatever minister it would be stand
[1:19:42] behind the pulpit that's god's gift to
[1:19:44] us to get us to do one thing raise our
[1:19:46] faith to the place where we would walk
[1:19:48] in the word of god willingly accept it
[1:19:50] and act on it and be an expectation for
[1:19:52] receiving today man
[1:19:54] so i say all that because like i said
[1:19:56] he's in gently admonishing us you ought
[1:19:58] to just believe it
[1:19:59] but he says you don't so then god sends
[1:20:01] you love gifts and it's these men with
[1:20:03] gifts and ministries to get you to raise
[1:20:04] up your faith so i want to take that and
[1:20:06] say don't dwell on failure
[1:20:09] i mean don't dwell on where you've had
[1:20:10] maybe more more zeal than wisdom or
[1:20:13] where you've moved without the will of
[1:20:14] god and maybe fallen short it's like we
[1:20:16] read that story last service or the
[1:20:17] surfs before about the mama eagle and
[1:20:20] she brings the little eaglets up and she
[1:20:21] drops them off and says fly
[1:20:24] and none of them fly
[1:20:26] but what does she do she catches them
[1:20:28] she takes them up high so that when
[1:20:29] they're falling they don't hit the
[1:20:30] ground swoops down catches them brings
[1:20:32] them up and says
[1:20:33] try again
[1:20:34] what is it they're developing wings of
[1:20:37] faith
[1:20:37] amen so just because you failed the
[1:20:40] first time or just because you feel
[1:20:41] you're failing now doesn't mean you're
[1:20:43] not an eagle
[1:20:45] don't expect to fly like mama eagle the
[1:20:47] first time
[1:20:48] right you've got to grow
[1:20:50] you've got to grow and so you've got to
[1:20:52] come up to the place where your wings
[1:20:53] can just set themselves right and you
[1:20:55] know how to flap them you know how to
[1:20:57] catch the wind and these different
[1:20:58] things but they just sit there and you
[1:20:59] know why they fail because they're
[1:21:01] trying to do it all themselves
[1:21:02] you watch them
[1:21:05] right
[1:21:06] what does mama do
[1:21:08] she's not even moving
[1:21:11] just one or two flaps i was listening to
[1:21:12] that story where brother brahm talks
[1:21:13] about you know he's he's up in the
[1:21:15] mountains and a storm comes in he's
[1:21:16] under a tree and he's got that little
[1:21:18] little chipmunk chattering in his ear
[1:21:19] and he says i thought it was chattering
[1:21:21] at me but then i saw this great eagle in
[1:21:22] there and it kind of ducked down in
[1:21:24] under the storm he says but then it came
[1:21:26] out and the the chipmunk was chattering
[1:21:29] at it and he said that eagle just after
[1:21:30] a while got sick of it and he just went
[1:21:33] two flaps of his wings he says and then
[1:21:35] he caught the wind and he was gone
[1:21:37] right how much effort did he put in one
[1:21:39] two boom gone and then he just caught
[1:21:41] that wind and he said he just sort out
[1:21:43] over the trees
[1:21:44] that's what the eagle does
[1:21:46] right you're just getting those flaps to
[1:21:48] get off the ground for a second and then
[1:21:49] once you get up into the air the air
[1:21:50] does all the work
[1:21:52] that's all it is you're trying to do too
[1:21:53] much
[1:21:54] and you got to learn to rest and let
[1:21:56] that what the winds of faith carry you
[1:21:59] as we sing amen
[1:22:01] amen don't get discouraged because you
[1:22:03] didn't fly like your mama the first time
[1:22:05] amen you're still an eagle
[1:22:07] amen but the point that matters is your
[1:22:10] faith in god
[1:22:11] that's what matters is that you tried to
[1:22:13] fly
[1:22:14] that you you took god at his word and
[1:22:15] you stepped out on it now the other
[1:22:17] thing is just because you're not flying
[1:22:18] now doesn't mean you're not going to fly
[1:22:20] before you hit the ground sometimes
[1:22:21] you're sitting there you're saying i'm
[1:22:22] doing this and nothing's happening but
[1:22:24] maybe as you go it'll settle out and all
[1:22:26] of a sudden you'll start to fly and soar
[1:22:28] right don't look at the current
[1:22:29] condition don't look at the current
[1:22:30] circumstances don't look at your current
[1:22:31] level just keep flapping and saying lord
[1:22:33] i'm trusting you to catch me if i don't
[1:22:35] have it amen he's never failed us he's
[1:22:37] not here to to watch us i heard a
[1:22:40] brother say the other day he's not
[1:22:41] standing there with steel toe booze
[1:22:42] ready to stomp us into into the ground
[1:22:45] you know when we fail no he's not that
[1:22:47] he's just there to carry us up again say
[1:22:49] try again son try again daughter amen
[1:22:52] what i'm telling you is you're already
[1:22:53] built to fly
[1:22:55] you're an eagle that's why brother brown
[1:22:57] keeps going eels you're built to fly
[1:22:59] so guess what you're gonna fly
[1:23:01] and maybe not today maybe tomorrow maybe
[1:23:03] next month maybe next year but you're
[1:23:05] going to fly in the situation that you
[1:23:06] need to fly in amen
[1:23:08] amen we're not we're not revised
[1:23:10] creatures remember we're new creatures
[1:23:12] in him and win that new creation we are
[1:23:14] built to do everything that this word
[1:23:16] calls us to do
[1:23:17] amen
[1:23:18] glory
[1:23:20] he says now there's a time that a man
[1:23:22] can come to a place where he can have a
[1:23:24] purpose we're talking about your your
[1:23:25] faith we're talking about being born an
[1:23:27] eagle he says it's something that will
[1:23:29] change him and that is when a man meets
[1:23:31] god a man can never be the same if ever
[1:23:35] he meets god face to face it will change
[1:23:38] him in spite of anything you can do
[1:23:40] about it a man can never be the same
[1:23:43] after he once meets god now that's the
[1:23:45] truth now notice he says he can't help
[1:23:47] it no matter what you try no matter what
[1:23:49] i try
[1:23:50] if it's sister justine and she goes into
[1:23:52] the presence of god guess what sister
[1:23:54] justine can't stop from changing
[1:23:57] and i can't stop sister justine from
[1:23:59] changing why because she has met a
[1:24:01] living god and she will change whether
[1:24:03] she wants to or not is what he's saying
[1:24:05] now we have a desire to change because
[1:24:07] he's given us that desire he meant but
[1:24:09] the change happens whether she wants it
[1:24:11] or not or whether she realizes it or not
[1:24:13] right the eagle just eats and eats and
[1:24:15] eats and then it grows and it becomes
[1:24:16] the fully mature eagle they don't always
[1:24:18] realize how big they're getting they
[1:24:20] don't realize the strength they're
[1:24:21] gaining until all of a sudden the
[1:24:23] situation comes up right and all of a
[1:24:25] sudden they've got what they need for it
[1:24:26] amen but brother braham says the new
[1:24:28] birth gives you a purpose and that
[1:24:30] purpose is to solely glorify and praise
[1:24:32] god
[1:24:33] we are here for the glory of his praise
[1:24:35] and we'll read that in a moment amen
[1:24:37] wow we all have that same thing
[1:24:40] your faith ought to give praise and
[1:24:42] glory to god not yourself
[1:24:44] right but to give glory and praise to
[1:24:46] god now that's going to differ whether
[1:24:47] you're a man or a woman whether you're
[1:24:49] married whether you're married whether
[1:24:50] you're a minister whether you're a
[1:24:51] member of the lady it's going to differ
[1:24:53] from person to person how we do it but
[1:24:55] it is all for the glory and the praise
[1:24:57] of god amen but that initial faith we
[1:24:59] have that's the start of it and it's
[1:25:01] funny because we say healing wow that
[1:25:03] takes a lot of faith
[1:25:04] let me talk to you about the faith that
[1:25:06] it takes to believe that you're a son
[1:25:07] and daughter of god because what you
[1:25:09] believe when you accept christ as your
[1:25:11] savior you go down under the water in
[1:25:13] baptism by faith in jesus name and raise
[1:25:15] up what you're saying is i i have no sin
[1:25:18] i cannot be condemned i have eternal
[1:25:21] life i'm going to rule and reign with
[1:25:23] jesus christ and i'm a new creature and
[1:25:24] all you did was went down in the water
[1:25:26] and came up
[1:25:27] you had faith that that going down in
[1:25:29] the water represented a complete and
[1:25:31] total creational change for you
[1:25:33] and then you say
[1:25:35] but it's hard to believe for healing
[1:25:37] you just believe that you're going to
[1:25:38] rule and reign with christ that's the
[1:25:40] faith that you have when you go down in
[1:25:42] the waters that you're going to rule and
[1:25:43] reign with christ that you have eternal
[1:25:45] life then nothing can change you from
[1:25:47] the end that god has put for you
[1:25:50] and then you say but i can't believe him
[1:25:52] for my toothache to get healed for my
[1:25:53] headache to go away for whatever it
[1:25:55] might be
[1:25:56] you're the faith that you have to accept
[1:25:58] salvation is far greater than anything
[1:26:00] that you could have for healing the
[1:26:01] difference is that you can't see
[1:26:03] what's going on inside of you but you
[1:26:05] have faith for it but you look in the
[1:26:07] you know i can feel the headache that i
[1:26:09] have before i get up to preach right you
[1:26:11] can you can feel the arthritis in your
[1:26:13] limbs right you can maybe see the cancer
[1:26:15] or the goiter on your neck the way
[1:26:16] brother brown prayed for so many of them
[1:26:18] you can see it and that's what hinders
[1:26:19] your faith is that you've got something
[1:26:21] here that says it's it's there
[1:26:23] but your faith to start is so much
[1:26:24] greater because you believe it's going
[1:26:25] to take you all the way to the
[1:26:26] heavenlies
[1:26:28] amen
[1:26:30] when you lose do you lose your salvation
[1:26:32] when you make a mistake
[1:26:35] do you think you do
[1:26:37] when you get a revelation of
[1:26:39] justification you will never forg you
[1:26:41] will never think you've lost your
[1:26:42] salvation because you're justified in
[1:26:44] christ and and the the revelation of
[1:26:46] justification is not that it's as if you
[1:26:48] didn't do it it is you never did it in
[1:26:51] the first place so it doesn't matter
[1:26:52] what you do it's all under the blood of
[1:26:54] christ and you're standing there in his
[1:26:55] righteousness not your own so guess what
[1:26:57] the true believer never thinks that they
[1:26:59] have lost their salvation because
[1:27:01] they've done something they ought not to
[1:27:03] but yet when our when our sickness
[1:27:05] doesn't go away as quickly as we want or
[1:27:06] it comes back we say well i didn't get
[1:27:08] my healing if we acted that way towards
[1:27:10] our salvation we'd be of all men most
[1:27:11] miserable wouldn't we
[1:27:13] but he says what don't look to those
[1:27:15] things amen we're not looking to that
[1:27:16] but we're looking to what the word says
[1:27:18] happened when we accepted by faith our
[1:27:20] salvation the same thing for healing no
[1:27:22] matter what the symptoms say it has
[1:27:23] nothing to do with the word keep moving
[1:27:25] on as if it was your salvation don't
[1:27:27] look at the way you're acting don't look
[1:27:28] at the way your body's acting but look
[1:27:30] at the promise of god amen
[1:27:32] the symptom doesn't change the promise
[1:27:34] or the confession amen we're looking to
[1:27:35] the author and finisher of our faith
[1:27:38] amen now ephesians 2 says and you have
[1:27:40] he quickened who are dead in trespasses
[1:27:43] and sins you were dead amen you aren't
[1:27:46] any longer you were living for yourself
[1:27:48] and you were dead and now you're dead to
[1:27:50] yourself and living
[1:27:52] amen it's a paradox he said wherein in
[1:27:54] time past ye walked according to the
[1:27:56] course of this world according to the
[1:27:58] prince of the power of the air the
[1:27:59] spirit thou now worketh in the children
[1:28:01] of disobedience is this in your past it
[1:28:04] ought to be
[1:28:05] what children of disobedience amen we're
[1:28:07] leading up to something here but paul is
[1:28:08] saying this is the old you it better be
[1:28:10] the old you because you can't come into
[1:28:12] what i'm talking about if this is still
[1:28:13] you you cannot be a child of
[1:28:14] disobedience
[1:28:16] right you've been quickened you've been
[1:28:18] made alive something's changed we've got
[1:28:19] a visitor here
[1:28:21] i can only see him i think
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:26] among whom also we had our conversation
[1:28:28] in times past in the lusts of our flesh
[1:28:30] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:28:32] of the mind and where by nature the
[1:28:34] children of wrath even as others but god
[1:28:37] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[1:28:39] wherewith he loved us even when we were
[1:28:41] dead in sins hath quickened us together
[1:28:43] with christ and by grace our ye are
[1:28:46] saved and hath raised us together
[1:28:49] present tense
[1:28:51] raised us together and made us sit
[1:28:53] together in heavenly places in christ
[1:28:54] jesus that's what happened when you were
[1:28:56] quickened by the holy spirit was that
[1:28:58] you were raised in the heavenly places
[1:28:59] with christ jesus that's right now
[1:29:02] i don't care what you look like i don't
[1:29:04] care what your life looks like if you
[1:29:06] have the holy spirit you've been
[1:29:07] quickened in christ jesus and you are
[1:29:09] sitting now in heavenly places amen
[1:29:12] that's where you stand right now
[1:29:14] he says what that in the ages to come so
[1:29:18] you're sitting up here but he says in
[1:29:19] the ages to come that he might show the
[1:29:21] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[1:29:24] kindness towards us through christ jesus
[1:29:26] are you ready for some exceeding riches
[1:29:28] in jesus christ's grace
[1:29:30] he says what for by grace are ye saved
[1:29:33] through faith and that not of yourselves
[1:29:35] it is the gift of god not of works lest
[1:29:38] any man should boast for we are his
[1:29:40] workmanship created in christ jesus unto
[1:29:43] good works
[1:29:44] which god hath before ordained that we
[1:29:46] should walk with them i want you to see
[1:29:48] there that before faith existed grace
[1:29:51] abounded
[1:29:52] amen amen you're here because grace
[1:29:54] abounded not because faith was there
[1:29:56] grace brought the faith that brings you
[1:29:57] to this place amen i want you to see
[1:29:59] that before you ever made a move god had
[1:30:02] already brought you to the end before
[1:30:03] ever you have made a decision god had
[1:30:05] decided for you where you were going to
[1:30:06] be amen i want you to see that you've
[1:30:08] been created for a good purpose and it
[1:30:10] is for what good works
[1:30:13] good works is what god has made us for
[1:30:15] now brother gerald has said this many
[1:30:17] times there's none good but god right
[1:30:19] what does he say are you good there's
[1:30:20] none good but god that's his his little
[1:30:22] phrase that he uses right you've been
[1:30:23] created under good works what are good
[1:30:25] works godly works
[1:30:26] right works according to the word of god
[1:30:28] you've been built for one thing and
[1:30:30] that's to manifest the word of god amen
[1:30:32] how do i get faith look for something in
[1:30:34] the word to manifest that'll be quicken
[1:30:36] to you amen when god called you and it
[1:30:38] ends and you answered it started you on
[1:30:39] a journey that will take you all the way
[1:30:41] to glory and between then and that there
[1:30:44] and now is going to be a manifestation
[1:30:46] of the word of god in your life there
[1:30:47] has to be because the word brings forth
[1:30:49] the word the holy spirit quickens the
[1:30:51] word inside of you it's got to come
[1:30:53] through amen the very fact that you seek
[1:30:55] after the things of god that you look to
[1:30:57] the promises of god is a testimony of
[1:30:59] the grace of god in your life that's put
[1:31:00] something in you to call for it in the
[1:31:02] first place amen now brother branham
[1:31:05] he's speaking of a plant that dies and
[1:31:06] goes to goes into the ground and rises
[1:31:08] up in the spring he says god had that
[1:31:10] little germ of life hid somewhere so he
[1:31:12] could live again because it's in god's
[1:31:14] will
[1:31:15] now that's you that's the seed in you
[1:31:17] from him right he said unless the corner
[1:31:19] we die and go into the ground it cannot
[1:31:21] rise again unless he died we couldn't
[1:31:23] come up
[1:31:24] but he died and he rose again but that
[1:31:26] life goes into what these dead bodies of
[1:31:29] ours and it has to be quickened by the
[1:31:31] holy spirit amen but he says god had
[1:31:33] that little germ of life hid somewhere
[1:31:34] so he could live again because it's in
[1:31:36] god's will
[1:31:37] it's god's plan god put it here for a
[1:31:39] purpose and it doesn't fuss or stew
[1:31:43] it doesn't fuss or stew
[1:31:45] about what other plants are doing or
[1:31:47] what other plants think about what it's
[1:31:49] doing it's just doing what it's supposed
[1:31:51] to do
[1:31:52] it just serves a purpose that god put in
[1:31:54] here for and it will just do the same
[1:31:57] serve the purpose that god put us here
[1:31:59] for he says not to just to mean we got
[1:32:01] to do our daily work and that's all
[1:32:02] right we got to do this that or the
[1:32:04] other but he put us here to be sons and
[1:32:06] daughters of god to glorify him and to
[1:32:09] praise him like the little flower now
[1:32:12] it's odd because we come up to this
[1:32:13] faith requirement then we say it's
[1:32:15] something i've got to do
[1:32:17] what makes us think that this is
[1:32:18] suddenly our thing to do
[1:32:22] it's something i i think believers have
[1:32:23] put on themselves that i've got to get
[1:32:25] faith no you have the faith of jesus
[1:32:27] christ living in you by the holy spirit
[1:32:29] so you don't have to go get it you just
[1:32:31] have to get things out of the way of it
[1:32:33] and even that often will take a working
[1:32:35] of god but you can absolutely have
[1:32:37] control over what things are happening
[1:32:38] in your life how you're spending your
[1:32:40] time how you're feeding yourself in
[1:32:41] these different things amen but the very
[1:32:43] faith to accept christ
[1:32:45] is a gift from god you don't work it up
[1:32:48] you had it because god gave it to you so
[1:32:50] when you look at faith it's no different
[1:32:51] you have it because god gives it to you
[1:32:53] and all you're doing is trying to get
[1:32:54] the things out of the way that would
[1:32:55] hinder it that's why the ministry comes
[1:32:57] as they're trying to get you out of
[1:32:58] those little things that's why an
[1:33:00] evangelist comes in and stirs up the
[1:33:01] waters to get the junk out why so that
[1:33:03] your faith can rise up that's often what
[1:33:06] it is so often when an evangelist comes
[1:33:08] what happens is they first deal with
[1:33:10] what the sin in the camp and then they
[1:33:12] move to the gift of healing or the gift
[1:33:13] of faith in these different things
[1:33:15] right they're getting you cleaned up so
[1:33:16] that you can accept the word of god so
[1:33:18] that you're in a condition to accept
[1:33:19] these things right
[1:33:21] but when he fills you with the holy
[1:33:22] spirit then what is that
[1:33:24] is that something you've earned
[1:33:27] acts 2 38 says it is the gift of the
[1:33:29] holy spirit so your faith is a grace is
[1:33:32] a grace gift
[1:33:34] right to accept him and then the holy
[1:33:36] spirit which is the very faith of jesus
[1:33:38] christ is a promise gift
[1:33:40] so why are we sitting there saying i've
[1:33:42] got to raise up my faith i've got to do
[1:33:44] this i've got to do that jesus never
[1:33:46] does tell us to do that
[1:33:48] he just says believe amen right he just
[1:33:50] says believe you've got the faith in you
[1:33:52] you just got to let it work get out all
[1:33:54] of the unbelief is all that we're
[1:33:55] looking for amen it's unmerited this is
[1:33:57] all unmerited yeah that's right so don't
[1:34:00] start trying to make yourself meritus to
[1:34:02] receive faith
[1:34:03] now brother bam says a man or woman gets
[1:34:05] desperate with god they show they're
[1:34:06] serious then god respects it but that's
[1:34:08] you getting what setting things aside so
[1:34:10] that you can receive from god that's how
[1:34:12] you show you're serious that's not what
[1:34:13] gives you faith that's what gives god a
[1:34:15] channel to raise up the faith that you
[1:34:16] have in your life in the first place
[1:34:18] amen but this is not because we deserve
[1:34:20] it it's because he decided we're going
[1:34:22] to do it and see because he decided
[1:34:24] we're going to be what we are amen
[1:34:26] everything
[1:34:27] from this that we do is the grace is the
[1:34:29] grace of god and it's a gift of god in
[1:34:31] our lives amen
[1:34:33] and what does it do it tells me that i'm
[1:34:35] qualified approved and certified to
[1:34:37] receive the promises of god that's what
[1:34:38] the holy spirit is that's a seal on me
[1:34:40] that says that i'm what eligible
[1:34:44] not just eligible but i'm certified to
[1:34:46] my destination amen right and it's no
[1:34:47] different from each and every one of you
[1:34:48] if you have the holy spirit that
[1:34:50] certifies you to be able to walk into
[1:34:52] the bank of heaven and say i have need
[1:34:53] of something
[1:34:54] and they say where's your sign where's
[1:34:56] your seal right here
[1:34:58] here you go
[1:34:59] it's that simple
[1:35:00] that's all we're talking about
[1:35:02] philippians 1 6 says being confident of
[1:35:04] this very thing that we he which has
[1:35:07] begun a good work in you will perform it
[1:35:09] until the day of jesus christ so if you
[1:35:11] think you started it you're already a
[1:35:12] failure amen if you think you did it
[1:35:15] you're already a failure because why you
[1:35:17] haven't recognized that it's christ in
[1:35:19] christ alone that's doing the work why
[1:35:21] because no man can come to god except
[1:35:22] god draws him first no woman
[1:35:25] doesn't matter anybody that comes to god
[1:35:26] they're coming because god has drawn
[1:35:28] them first amen the starter guarantees
[1:35:30] the finish amen alpha guarantees omega
[1:35:33] the author guarantees the finish of the
[1:35:35] story amen the first guarantees the last
[1:35:37] we have no part in this it's all his
[1:35:38] working in our life
[1:35:40] amen but now that you have the new birth
[1:35:41] when you have the new birth now god
[1:35:43] starts to work inside of you and he
[1:35:44] starts to build your faith to move
[1:35:46] beyond just salvation but he's moving
[1:35:48] you into greater and bigger things he's
[1:35:50] growing you out he's expanding you up
[1:35:51] amen amen what's he doing he's making
[1:35:54] this
[1:35:55] personal to you
[1:35:57] personal to you not just words over a
[1:35:59] pulpit not just words through a message
[1:36:01] book but he's making it personal to you
[1:36:03] so that what you can see the
[1:36:04] manifestation of god in your life
[1:36:07] brother brown puts it this way he says
[1:36:08] now we find in this little tree it
[1:36:10] pushes out when it grows it pushes out
[1:36:12] and when you're born into the kingdom of
[1:36:14] god just a little baby in christ
[1:36:16] everything you have need of in this
[1:36:17] life's journey is in you when you
[1:36:18] receive the holy spirit oh then what do
[1:36:21] you do what do you have to do is drink
[1:36:24] and drink and keep on drinking how do i
[1:36:26] get faith brother john how do i get my
[1:36:27] faith to grow how do i get my faith to
[1:36:29] expand drink drink keep on drinking what
[1:36:32] were you drinking when you started keep
[1:36:34] drinking that
[1:36:36] the word not just acts 2 38 but keep
[1:36:39] drinking the word keep feeding on the
[1:36:41] word keep sucking it in brother brahma
[1:36:43] he said another thing how does a tree
[1:36:44] grow he says it takes in more than it
[1:36:46] has need of
[1:36:48] it's not just looking for life
[1:36:50] sustaining it's looking for growth so
[1:36:52] it's got to suck in more than it has
[1:36:53] need of and that's what pushes these
[1:36:54] things out
[1:36:55] he says don't just stop when you join
[1:36:57] church and are baptized just keep
[1:36:59] drinking until you have faith for this
[1:37:00] faith for that faith for this and push
[1:37:03] out until all the manifestations of the
[1:37:05] holy spirit is living in the church
[1:37:08] he says there's got to be a reality of a
[1:37:11] new in the new birth
[1:37:12] being filled being born again and filled
[1:37:15] with the spirit and knowing the presence
[1:37:17] of god is here and seeing him carrying
[1:37:19] out his word and his promise just as he
[1:37:21] did jesus said if i be lifted up from
[1:37:23] the earth i'll draw all men unto me
[1:37:26] he says in the holy spirit is god and
[1:37:28] the holy ghost is god and god is the
[1:37:30] word the holy ghost is this word made
[1:37:33] fully manifested
[1:37:35] it's not just words on a page
[1:37:37] it's fully manifested in your life amen
[1:37:41] it's going to start with brother mark
[1:37:42] and it's going to move to sister maureen
[1:37:43] it's going to over the brother ellie
[1:37:44] brother joshua david and go through the
[1:37:46] entire church what is it each one of us
[1:37:49] is manifesting our portion of the word
[1:37:51] fully
[1:37:53] fully not partially but fully amen amen
[1:37:56] it says the holy ghost is the thing that
[1:37:58] brings us promised word to life so you
[1:38:00] say do i have faith do you have the holy
[1:38:02] ghost yes therefore you have faith you
[1:38:05] have the potential for everything that
[1:38:06] you have need of in this life when you
[1:38:08] get the holy ghost brother graham said
[1:38:09] amen
[1:38:12] the scripture says in hebrews 11 6 but
[1:38:13] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:38:16] him for he that cometh to god must do
[1:38:19] two things
[1:38:20] must believe that he is and that he is a
[1:38:23] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:38:24] him you've got to know god is real
[1:38:27] okay you've got to know that god is real
[1:38:29] paul says you've got to believe that he
[1:38:31] is in other words you've got to know
[1:38:33] that when you pray somebody is hearing
[1:38:36] you're not just praying into the ether
[1:38:38] you're praying to a specific person
[1:38:41] you can tell when somebody's praying to
[1:38:43] a god they know have you ever noticed
[1:38:44] that
[1:38:45] it's not a big flowery praise usually
[1:38:48] it's not a big flowery prayer it's not
[1:38:50] what is it they're talking to a person
[1:38:52] we talk different to people than we talk
[1:38:54] to what make things known you know to to
[1:38:57] look a certain way but when you talk to
[1:38:58] god it's very specific it's very
[1:39:00] personal amen because it's a it's a i
[1:39:03] say a man but that's how we look at it
[1:39:05] but there's a person that's there
[1:39:06] listening to those words we speak very
[1:39:08] differently when we're talking to a
[1:39:09] person amen you've got to know that he's
[1:39:12] real to you amen you got to know that
[1:39:13] you're that somebody's hearing what you
[1:39:15] say and he's acting on it that's what he
[1:39:17] says you got to believe that he is
[1:39:19] amen we preached on that sermon of my
[1:39:21] god you've got to know that he is your
[1:39:23] god but paul doesn't stop there he says
[1:39:25] you've got to believe that he is and
[1:39:27] you've got to believe that he's a
[1:39:29] rewarder of those that really really
[1:39:30] really really really really really
[1:39:31] really really really seek after him
[1:39:34] diligently day in day out minute by
[1:39:37] minute you're looking for god in your
[1:39:39] life you're looking for the promises of
[1:39:40] god in your life you have a need you're
[1:39:42] looking for him you're coming to him
[1:39:43] you're talking to him amen it does you
[1:39:45] no good to believe he's real if you
[1:39:47] don't act on it amen if he's real then
[1:39:49] he's going to have real effect isn't he
[1:39:52] he's going to have something there and
[1:39:53] paul says you've got to have unwavering
[1:39:55] dedication to seeking god
[1:39:58] can't just believe he is but you've got
[1:39:59] to have unwavering dedication to seek
[1:40:01] after him because why you believe that
[1:40:03] what you seek for you're going to get
[1:40:06] amen what you're going to get is an
[1:40:08] answer
[1:40:10] not you're going to get what you asked
[1:40:11] for you're going to get an answer
[1:40:12] because sometimes you ask and god says
[1:40:14] no
[1:40:15] there's a quote maybe i'll bring in
[1:40:16] another service brother basically says
[1:40:17] he says i've never seen him fulfill not
[1:40:20] fulfill a promise unless he tells me why
[1:40:22] he what why he can't do it first
[1:40:24] he says sometimes he says no but he lets
[1:40:26] me know why
[1:40:27] but otherwise he says every time i've
[1:40:29] seen god fulfill his promises in his
[1:40:31] word
[1:40:32] jesus said this to the disciples he said
[1:40:34] ask and it shall be given to you
[1:40:36] seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:40:38] shall be opened unto you for every one
[1:40:42] that asketh receive it
[1:40:46] does everyone exclude anybody in this
[1:40:48] church if you're a believer you're
[1:40:51] included in every one
[1:40:53] everyone that asketh receiveth and he
[1:40:55] that seeketh findeth and to him that
[1:40:57] knock it that shall be opened or what
[1:40:59] man is there of you whom if his son has
[1:41:01] spread will he give him a stone or if he
[1:41:03] asks for a fish will he give him a
[1:41:05] serpent if ye then being evil know how
[1:41:07] to give good gifts unto your children
[1:41:09] how much more shall your father which is
[1:41:11] in heaven give good things to them that
[1:41:13] ask him
[1:41:14] this is kind of the first kind of faith
[1:41:15] i don't want to go too deep in it but
[1:41:17] this is receiving faith that jesus is
[1:41:18] talking about because we have receiving
[1:41:20] faith we have acting faith it's two
[1:41:22] different things because you have faith
[1:41:24] to do things you have faith to receive
[1:41:25] things and he's saying you've got to
[1:41:26] have a receiving faith first and that's
[1:41:28] what we do when we go to him in in in
[1:41:30] faith and we we're baptizing as we're
[1:41:32] receiving we're saying lord we're doing
[1:41:34] we're looking to your promise amen we're
[1:41:36] going to receive the gift of the holy
[1:41:37] spirit and you act on it amen but this
[1:41:39] is a faith that comes from seeking
[1:41:41] asking and knocking and he says this is
[1:41:43] like a child that goes to his father
[1:41:45] amen now anybody that has children knows
[1:41:47] if a child knows that you have what he
[1:41:49] wants he's going to ask
[1:41:51] and he's going to expect to get it isn't
[1:41:52] he
[1:41:53] right if they know that you got a bag of
[1:41:55] cheesies in the cupboard and they want a
[1:41:57] bag of cheesies they're going to go say
[1:41:59] can i have the bag of cheesies and
[1:42:01] they're gonna keep asking until you
[1:42:02] either give it to them or firmly say no
[1:42:04] aren't they he says it's no different he
[1:42:06] says ask as if a son was going to his
[1:42:08] dad and say dad can have some bread he
[1:42:10] says when you go to when a boy goes to
[1:42:12] his dad and says dad can have something
[1:42:13] to eat he doesn't give him a rock
[1:42:15] he gives him something to eat right
[1:42:17] so he says go ask your father the same
[1:42:18] way because if you being evil in carnal
[1:42:21] base nature will do that than what what
[1:42:23] god who is actually good do for those
[1:42:25] that come and ask him
[1:42:26] right
[1:42:28] amen what if a chair if a child believes
[1:42:30] a parent is capable of meeting the need
[1:42:32] they'll ask
[1:42:34] and even if they're not sure they'll ask
[1:42:36] that's the childlike faith that's the
[1:42:37] receiving faith that we're looking for
[1:42:39] amen and jesus told the disciples to be
[1:42:40] like children and asking keep asking
[1:42:42] until you get it if you know it's
[1:42:44] available keep asking until you get it
[1:42:46] amen
[1:42:49] listen to this he's talking about jacob
[1:42:50] here and he says you know jacob and he
[1:42:52] wrestles with god he says the main thing
[1:42:54] was that jacob he had dreams and visions
[1:42:56] and so forth but this was one time he
[1:42:59] could lay his hand on something and say
[1:43:01] it's gone remember he's in bethel and
[1:43:03] he's laying down and he's he sees a
[1:43:05] ladder going up to heaven and angel's
[1:43:06] coming up and down
[1:43:08] that was not what anchored jacob and we
[1:43:09] preached on this before that was not
[1:43:11] what anchored jacob seeing great visions
[1:43:14] and dreams and being caught into the
[1:43:15] presence of god in these different
[1:43:16] things that's not what settled jacob
[1:43:18] what settled jacob was when he laid a
[1:43:19] hand on god and he was changed forever
[1:43:21] more
[1:43:22] and not to his nest his natural benefit
[1:43:25] i'll remind you he walked with a limp
[1:43:27] the rest of his life but brother brahm
[1:43:29] says he was able to hold on to it until
[1:43:31] the blessing came oh if we could do that
[1:43:33] if we could find a spot to where we
[1:43:35] could see god whether it's in his word
[1:43:37] wherever it is and recognize it's god
[1:43:39] and hold on to it until the blessing
[1:43:41] comes wrestle it out with god god
[1:43:44] promised to do it god said if we'd seek
[1:43:46] we'd find ask and it shall be given
[1:43:48] knock it'll be open then he says every
[1:43:50] word is true now receiving faith is what
[1:43:53] we're talking about it's not the same as
[1:43:55] the other types of faith it comes from
[1:43:57] the same place but it acts differently
[1:43:58] amen it's the one where you're asking
[1:44:00] and god's giving
[1:44:01] right other faith is where god's telling
[1:44:03] you in your doing that's a completely
[1:44:05] different faith and that comes by
[1:44:06] commission
[1:44:07] amen but there is a faith where you're
[1:44:08] asking in god's giving it's expecting
[1:44:11] but it can't do anything
[1:44:13] it's got to wait for god to give it to
[1:44:14] you but it's in expectation this is a
[1:44:16] faith that is an expectation and it's in
[1:44:18] peace and rest until it gets it amen i
[1:44:20] listened to a sermon a long time ago
[1:44:21] with brother noel johnson he says i've
[1:44:23] come to the place where he says i bring
[1:44:25] my need to god
[1:44:27] i let him know what it is and then i
[1:44:29] just walk away and trust that he's going
[1:44:30] to meet the need
[1:44:32] that's the kind of faith we're looking
[1:44:33] for isn't it where you just say lord
[1:44:36] as your child i'm coming with the need
[1:44:38] here it is
[1:44:40] and i'm just going to go away now
[1:44:42] i'm trusting you to meet the need
[1:44:43] because if you have a genuine need if
[1:44:44] your child has a genuine need how many
[1:44:45] of us won't meet it if your brother's
[1:44:47] sister has a need that you can meet how
[1:44:49] many of us won't do it
[1:44:51] god forgive us if we don't amen if we've
[1:44:53] got something that will meet the need
[1:44:54] then we ought to give the need amen each
[1:44:57] and every one of us amen whether it's
[1:44:58] helping brother vice in his house or
[1:44:59] whether his brother chad moving what do
[1:45:01] we do we don't sit back at home and say
[1:45:02] well he can do it himself we do we get
[1:45:04] in there we do it i'm saying to them
[1:45:06] this is part of our christian walk is to
[1:45:08] help the local believers amen not just
[1:45:10] by words and prayers but to go in and
[1:45:11] actually put our bodies on the line do
[1:45:14] these things to help people out in that
[1:45:15] amen
[1:45:16] but the thing is this brother noel
[1:45:18] johnson didn't say
[1:45:19] i trust you to do it in my time
[1:45:22] timing is all god's
[1:45:24] ours is to ask it's up to him to give to
[1:45:26] us amen how to meet the need that's his
[1:45:28] to choose because god in his sovereignty
[1:45:30] knows what's best because god's sitting
[1:45:32] there and he's got to balance our
[1:45:33] spiritual needs with our natural needs
[1:45:35] and if all we do is pray for our spirit
[1:45:37] our natural needs then we're not going
[1:45:38] to grow spiritually but god says no no
[1:45:41] no you've got to grow as a child you've
[1:45:42] got to grow as a son or daughter of god
[1:45:44] so i'm going to put you through what's
[1:45:45] called a trial of your faith
[1:45:48] sometimes
[1:45:49] so that you can grow spiritually before
[1:45:51] you can grow naturally paul said i would
[1:45:53] that you would be in health and prosper
[1:45:55] even as your soul does prosper god cares
[1:45:58] about our soul this body's going to be
[1:45:59] left behind our houses our cars our
[1:46:02] careers everything's going to be left
[1:46:03] behind god cares not a wit about that in
[1:46:05] the big scheme of things amen what he
[1:46:07] cares about is his soul being matured
[1:46:10] and growing in christ amen so god's
[1:46:12] balancing that that up and so god will
[1:46:14] use those natural needs to help us grow
[1:46:15] spiritually and then he'll come and meet
[1:46:17] the natural need amen but scripture says
[1:46:19] i've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:46:20] nor seed begging bread he's going to
[1:46:22] meet the basics
[1:46:24] but there's times where he says he'll
[1:46:25] have to put you flat on your back to get
[1:46:26] you to where he needs you to be so
[1:46:28] you'll look up to him amen you look at
[1:46:30] plants growing out i'm not a i'm not a i
[1:46:32] have a i don't have a green thumb that's
[1:46:34] for sure i don't do anything with plants
[1:46:35] but
[1:46:36] those that do know that if you only
[1:46:37] raise plants in greenhouses they're not
[1:46:39] the strongest plant you can start them
[1:46:41] there you protect them to grow but then
[1:46:42] you got to get them out into nature so
[1:46:44] they can have some resilience otherwise
[1:46:46] they can't fight disease they can't
[1:46:47] fight bad weather and what is it they
[1:46:49] don't have any strength in them because
[1:46:50] they've got the perfect growing
[1:46:51] conditions they have a life of luxury
[1:46:53] and ease when it comes to plants they
[1:46:54] don't have to dig deep because why
[1:46:56] you're putting in everything they need
[1:46:57] every day every week whatever it is you
[1:46:59] give them the perfect growing conditions
[1:47:01] but guess what god doesn't give us
[1:47:03] perfect growing conditions his perfect
[1:47:05] growing conditions are trials of what
[1:47:07] our faith amen trials and temptations is
[1:47:10] what the scripture says and we read that
[1:47:11] quote where brother bram says that's
[1:47:12] god's grace to you because he knows you
[1:47:13] can go through it and you'll come out
[1:47:15] stronger on the other side of it amen
[1:47:17] amen
[1:47:19] we don't get to choose how we just get
[1:47:20] to express the need and god gets to come
[1:47:22] back with his answer to it he says now
[1:47:24] the thing of it is god gives it
[1:47:25] sometimes in the way that we're not
[1:47:27] expecting it but god always keeps his
[1:47:29] word
[1:47:30] there's no way for god to tell you
[1:47:31] anything and lie about it and remain god
[1:47:33] he cannot he must keep his word forever
[1:47:35] it's the truth and when the bible says
[1:47:37] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:47:39] today and forever that is the truth i
[1:47:42] may not have enough faith to make all
[1:47:43] these things that he done live again but
[1:47:45] i'd never stand in the road of somebody
[1:47:47] that has faith enough to do it i would
[1:47:49] be thanking god for that faith but just
[1:47:51] the same every promise that he made is
[1:47:53] absolutely true now you say the prophet
[1:47:55] of god was limited in his faith well
[1:47:56] when you understand that faith is a
[1:47:58] revelation of the will of god guess what
[1:48:00] it may not have been god's faith for
[1:48:01] brother branham to do everything that's
[1:48:02] why he didn't have faith for it was
[1:48:04] because it wasn't a revelation of god's
[1:48:05] will for him so that means that brother
[1:48:07] ellie could do something that brother
[1:48:08] branham couldn't if god revealed to him
[1:48:10] that it was brother ellis to do so could
[1:48:12] sister brenda so could sister maureen so
[1:48:15] could sister lily so could sister betty
[1:48:17] so could brother chad if god reveals you
[1:48:18] to do something it has nothing to do if
[1:48:20] anybody else has done it before if he's
[1:48:22] revealed it to you it's yours to do and
[1:48:23] god will give you the faith to do it
[1:48:25] amen but it's this struggle and it's the
[1:48:27] strength that shapes us and provides the
[1:48:28] character that we need you look at these
[1:48:30] kids that grow up in a life of of ease
[1:48:32] and luxury and they're all over the
[1:48:33] place you know on uh
[1:48:35] you know
[1:48:36] instagram and all these different things
[1:48:38] and they go and they're blowing some of
[1:48:39] them tens and hundreds of thousands of
[1:48:41] dollars i lived in vancouver and you see
[1:48:42] these 18 19 21 year old kids rolling
[1:48:44] around in a lamborghini gallardo that
[1:48:46] cost 250 000 right
[1:48:49] i guarantee you that the majority of
[1:48:50] those kids don't have character because
[1:48:52] they've had nothing to actually test
[1:48:53] them they just have everything given
[1:48:55] given given given to them and that's why
[1:48:57] they go through and they blow through a
[1:48:58] red light at 190 kilometers an hour and
[1:48:59] kill somebody's because they've had
[1:49:01] nothing to actually temper their
[1:49:02] character and then it's just it's the
[1:49:04] trial that that gives us that character
[1:49:06] that we need
[1:49:07] watch the way that jesus puts it in john
[1:49:11] he says a woman when she is in travail
[1:49:12] has sorrow because her hour has come but
[1:49:15] as soon as she is delivered of the child
[1:49:17] she remembereth no more the anguish for
[1:49:19] joy that a man is born into the word
[1:49:21] into the world so catch that hard times
[1:49:23] precede joint happiness and wonderful
[1:49:25] things
[1:49:26] right and catch this nugget that it's
[1:49:27] not all fun and games he's he's
[1:49:29] literally saying that the christian life
[1:49:31] is similar to a pregnancy it starts with
[1:49:34] fun and games it slowly transitions to
[1:49:37] discomfort and then it goes into serious
[1:49:39] pain and anguish and then after that you
[1:49:41] get the fullness of joy that comes from
[1:49:43] the purpose of what started it in the
[1:49:45] first place but there's a there's a
[1:49:47] difficult time in the beginning or in
[1:49:49] the middle and then when it comes to the
[1:49:51] end when you're sitting there and you
[1:49:53] have in your hands that little boy that
[1:49:54] little girl then all of the anguish goes
[1:49:56] away now i can't speak to that only the
[1:49:58] mothers can't
[1:50:00] but my wife has said that you know you
[1:50:02] hold on to him for a little bit and
[1:50:03] you're willing to go through it all over
[1:50:04] again you know with a bit of rest and
[1:50:06] sleep hopefully but you're willing to go
[1:50:08] through it all over again because that
[1:50:09] bundle of joy is just sitting there and
[1:50:10] you're just like wow it was totally
[1:50:12] worth all that pain
[1:50:14] right he says your life as a christian
[1:50:16] is the exact same thing as a pregnancy
[1:50:18] he says and ye now therefore have sorrow
[1:50:21] but i will see you again and your heart
[1:50:22] shall rejoice in your joy no man taketh
[1:50:24] from you he says i'm going and you guys
[1:50:26] are going to be really unhappy about it
[1:50:27] but there's going to come something that
[1:50:28] makes it all better again and in that
[1:50:31] day you shall ask me nothing verily
[1:50:33] verily i say unto you whatsoever you
[1:50:34] shall ask the father in my name he will
[1:50:36] give it to you hitherto you have asked
[1:50:38] nothing in my name ask and you shall
[1:50:41] receive that your joy may be full so
[1:50:43] he's giving the disciples a direction he
[1:50:45] says ask that your joy may be full
[1:50:48] your joy may be full he's got a
[1:50:50] direction here he's got a purpose for
[1:50:51] asking and it's that god wants us to
[1:50:54] have complete joy god wants us to
[1:50:55] experience the good things that he
[1:50:57] promised not the good things we want but
[1:50:59] the good things that he's promised
[1:51:01] amen there's a difference
[1:51:03] if you have the holy spirit hopefully
[1:51:04] your desires have changed to where
[1:51:06] you're asking for the right things but
[1:51:07] not always because we're in this carnal
[1:51:08] flesh and we're fighting day in and day
[1:51:10] out but god wants us to have this taste
[1:51:12] of joy day in and day out in our lives
[1:51:15] now john 15 says herein is my father
[1:51:17] glorified that ye bear much fruit so
[1:51:20] shall you be my disciples so god is
[1:51:22] glorified when we bear much fruit not a
[1:51:24] bit
[1:51:25] not just a little bit you don't want to
[1:51:27] be that that little tree that just has
[1:51:28] one or two little little apples or
[1:51:30] little berries on it you want to have
[1:51:31] what a full crop there he says as the
[1:51:34] father had loved me so have i loved you
[1:51:36] continue ye in my love
[1:51:38] if you keep my commandments and you you
[1:51:40] shall abide in my love even as i have
[1:51:42] kept my father's commandments and abide
[1:51:44] in his love
[1:51:45] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:51:48] my joy might remain
[1:51:50] in you he's telling you how to keep the
[1:51:52] joy of god
[1:51:54] and he says what
[1:51:56] got to bear much fruit
[1:51:58] you've got to dwell with the father
[1:52:00] right he says and that your joy might be
[1:52:02] full he says if my joy remains in you
[1:52:05] then your joy will stay full
[1:52:07] that's how you get your joy full as you
[1:52:09] keep the joy of god inside of you that's
[1:52:11] what he's pointing to you can't have
[1:52:12] human joy that'll never work that's
[1:52:13] called happiness amen but what is that
[1:52:16] joy if we go back to first peter it says
[1:52:18] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:52:19] lord jesus christ which according to his
[1:52:22] abundant mercy has begotten us again
[1:52:23] unto a lively hope that's a living hope
[1:52:26] by the resurrection of jesus christ from
[1:52:28] the dead to an inheritance incorruptible
[1:52:31] and undefiled and that fadeth not away
[1:52:33] reserved in heaven for you
[1:52:35] who are kept by the power of god through
[1:52:38] faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:52:40] revealed in the last time there's a
[1:52:42] salvation that's got to be revealed when
[1:52:44] now this is the last time there's a what
[1:52:47] a special salvation that's going to be
[1:52:49] revealed in our age and what is it it's
[1:52:52] a resurrection and a rapture
[1:52:54] it says wherein ye greatly rejoice
[1:52:56] though now for a season if need be ye
[1:52:58] are in heaviness through manifold
[1:53:00] temptations so he says look you're
[1:53:02] looking for this this faith that's going
[1:53:03] to be this this salvation that's going
[1:53:05] to be revealed at the last time but
[1:53:07] right now you're in heaviness because
[1:53:09] you're going through manifold
[1:53:10] temptations you're going through a lot
[1:53:11] of different trials but there's
[1:53:13] something being revealed in all of this
[1:53:15] and he says what that what the trial of
[1:53:18] your faith
[1:53:19] faith has to be tried
[1:53:21] faith has to be tried else it's not
[1:53:23] faith
[1:53:24] that the trial of your faith be much
[1:53:26] more precious than of gold that
[1:53:28] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[1:53:32] might be found under praise and honor
[1:53:34] and glory at the appearing of jesus
[1:53:35] christ
[1:53:36] whom having not seen ye love
[1:53:40] now listen to this it says in whom
[1:53:43] though now ye see him not yet believing
[1:53:46] ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
[1:53:49] of glory we're talking about the
[1:53:50] fullness of joy here and he says and and
[1:53:52] paul points us back here to what faith
[1:53:55] is the substance of things hoped for the
[1:53:56] evidence of things not seen so he says
[1:53:58] though you don't see him you're
[1:53:59] believing amen that's faith is the
[1:54:02] evidence of things not seen he says you
[1:54:03] have faith and you're looking to him and
[1:54:05] you have joy in him even though you
[1:54:07] can't see him
[1:54:09] right what we rejoice before we see
[1:54:12] because we have faith and belief we read
[1:54:14] that last time remember he says if you
[1:54:16] know that you've got the money for the
[1:54:17] bread you can rejoice as if you have the
[1:54:19] bread
[1:54:20] he's saying even though you don't see
[1:54:21] the bread you can rejoice because you've
[1:54:22] got what it takes to get the bread in
[1:54:24] the first place amen so what's the end
[1:54:26] result of all this rejoicing it says
[1:54:28] what receiving the end of your faith
[1:54:31] even the salvation of your souls so what
[1:54:33] is it that brings that fullness of joy
[1:54:34] to the believer what makes you shout and
[1:54:36] sing and prays in the service before and
[1:54:38] after the preaching of the word it's
[1:54:40] what your faith your belief that god is
[1:54:42] working in your life
[1:54:44] amen
[1:54:45] why would you praise a god that has no
[1:54:47] effect on you
[1:54:48] why would you praise a god that has
[1:54:49] never had an effect on you it makes no
[1:54:52] sense but you praise him because of what
[1:54:53] he's done what he's doing believing and
[1:54:56] looking unto the thing that he's going
[1:54:57] to do what by his word amen what is it
[1:55:01] and so our faith has been declared when
[1:55:03] we go and we put ourselves under the
[1:55:05] water and we're baptizing these
[1:55:06] different things but between all of that
[1:55:09] and the and the the fullness of our joy
[1:55:11] we're given an earnest we're given a
[1:55:13] down payment to take us through amen
[1:55:15] what's a down payment it's a taste of
[1:55:17] more to come
[1:55:18] right and what does he do he gives us a
[1:55:20] the earnest of our salvation is what the
[1:55:22] holy ghost
[1:55:23] and then we have what the earnest of our
[1:55:25] resurrection and rapture is one thing
[1:55:27] and brother brown says it's one thing
[1:55:28] divine healing
[1:55:29] and then he says healing is what the
[1:55:31] earnest of your resurrection and rapture
[1:55:33] that's proof that there's something and
[1:55:35] more of it to come
[1:55:36] amen
[1:55:38] we receive their holy spirit as the
[1:55:39] earnest of our full salvation because
[1:55:41] we're only impartial salvation remember
[1:55:43] he says there's a salvation that's going
[1:55:44] to be revealed at the end time and it's
[1:55:46] what the salvation of our bodies not
[1:55:48] just our souls
[1:55:50] right everything now is caught up and
[1:55:51] we're back to our eaten condition
[1:55:55] he says so now jesus was god's
[1:55:56] manifestation of his own being on earth
[1:55:59] unfolding himself into a human being to
[1:56:01] take away sin and make a way for
[1:56:02] sickness to be healed and if there is no
[1:56:05] divine healing there is no resurrection
[1:56:07] of the dead for it's the earnest of your
[1:56:09] resurrection amen now we're talking to
[1:56:11] believers now i'm focused on believers
[1:56:13] because that's who's here and that's
[1:56:14] what we are amen but god gives believers
[1:56:16] that down payment to show that the
[1:56:18] promises are going to be fully expressed
[1:56:20] in the future
[1:56:21] he gives you a taste of it now so you
[1:56:23] know that there's there's the fullness
[1:56:24] of it of more to come amen so if you
[1:56:26] believe there's more to come there is
[1:56:28] more to come
[1:56:29] right if you desire more to come there
[1:56:31] is more to come if you have a if you're
[1:56:33] seeking for more to come there's more to
[1:56:34] come because there is only a desire for
[1:56:37] what exists
[1:56:38] god only puts a desire in you for more
[1:56:40] of what he's going to give you amen i
[1:56:42] said it before it and i said that you're
[1:56:45] what you're thirsting and hungry for is
[1:56:47] god showing you what's coming your way
[1:56:49] that's actually a quote from our pastor
[1:56:50] i had it written in my notes from many
[1:56:52] many years ago
[1:56:54] right what you're hungry and thirsting
[1:56:56] for today if it's according to the word
[1:56:58] is showing you what god is preparing to
[1:56:59] bring your way
[1:57:01] that's a wonderful thing
[1:57:02] whether it's for healing whether it's
[1:57:03] for deliverance whether it's a closer
[1:57:05] relationship with him whether it's for
[1:57:07] certain blessings or needs in your life
[1:57:08] if you're hungry and thirsty after it
[1:57:10] according to the word that means god's
[1:57:11] going to bring it your way
[1:57:13] amen
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:17] matthew 5 6 blessed are they which do
[1:57:19] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[1:57:21] for they shall be filled
[1:57:23] right so what you're hungry and
[1:57:24] thirsting for shows what's coming your
[1:57:26] way and jesus says you're blessed if
[1:57:28] you're going to hunger and thirst for
[1:57:29] righteousness now the first thing you
[1:57:31] say is what's righteousness
[1:57:33] what is righteousness
[1:57:34] because our righteousness is as filthy
[1:57:36] rags
[1:57:37] so you can't hunger after that you don't
[1:57:38] want to hunger after that you want to
[1:57:39] hunger after god's righteousness
[1:57:41] amen so jesus is talking to john you
[1:57:44] remember and he says it becometh us to
[1:57:45] fulfill all righteousness so what is
[1:57:48] that he said all god's word must be he
[1:57:51] he's talking like jesus and john are
[1:57:53] having a conversation here he says he's
[1:57:55] talking to john he says all god's word
[1:57:56] must be fulfilled by us for this day for
[1:57:59] it's becoming to us it's behooving it's
[1:58:01] becoming it's like us for if we are the
[1:58:03] true witnesses of god today john we are
[1:58:06] the lights of this age
[1:58:07] and if we are the lights of this age
[1:58:09] there is so much scripture that's got to
[1:58:11] be fulfilled during this age and it's up
[1:58:13] to us
[1:58:14] hallelujah says it's up to us to see all
[1:58:17] that all god's righteousness is
[1:58:19] fulfilled and what is his righteousness
[1:58:22] his word
[1:58:24] so it says blessed are those which
[1:58:26] hunger and thirst after his word for his
[1:58:31] day
[1:58:32] her day you're hungry and thirsting for
[1:58:34] what the word that's written for you to
[1:58:36] manifest to come forward into your life
[1:58:38] amen
[1:58:39] in other words he said john you know who
[1:58:41] i am i'm the high priest that's true
[1:58:43] john and i have need to be baptized of
[1:58:45] thee but we've got to fulfill all
[1:58:47] righteousness and i have need to be
[1:58:48] baptized of thee now to fulfill the word
[1:58:51] of god because all the word has got to
[1:58:53] be fulfilled
[1:58:55] what are you seeking are you seeking the
[1:58:57] word to be fulfilled or are you seeking
[1:58:59] your own lusts and desires to be
[1:59:00] fulfilled if you're going to have faith
[1:59:02] like god wants us to have faith to
[1:59:04] express faith it's got to be in what the
[1:59:06] word to be fulfilled in our life
[1:59:08] he says him we are the lights of the day
[1:59:11] and it's up to us to fulfill all of this
[1:59:14] so if jesus was there saying that then
[1:59:15] what are we to be saying today
[1:59:18] because he said later and we've covered
[1:59:19] this before he says ye are the light of
[1:59:21] the world
[1:59:23] and if it's what it can't be up on a
[1:59:25] hill and then hidden with a bushel he
[1:59:26] says you've got to be a light
[1:59:29] you've got to be the fulfillment of the
[1:59:30] word he says and i know that your
[1:59:32] righteousness and your desire is to
[1:59:34] fulfill the word it's becoming to us we
[1:59:37] are the lights
[1:59:39] so if we're hungry and thirsty after
[1:59:40] righteousness we're hungry and thirsting
[1:59:42] for god's word to be manifested and
[1:59:44] fulfilled through us amen that's god's
[1:59:46] righteousness that's god's state what is
[1:59:48] righteousness it's being right
[1:59:51] but it's not enough to say i believe
[1:59:53] it's right you've got to be right and
[1:59:55] then you've got to express the right
[1:59:57] you've got to express the word of god
[1:59:58] and that's what righteousness is is the
[2:00:00] expression of god it's light god's life
[2:00:02] inside of you pushing out god's will in
[2:00:04] god's word in your life that's what
[2:00:06] you're looking for you're seeking god
[2:00:07] let your word come out and let mine stay
[2:00:10] quiet
[2:00:11] even better not just stay quiet get out
[2:00:14] you know so i don't have to deal with
[2:00:15] the thoughts and the the isms and the
[2:00:17] attitudes and all these different things
[2:00:18] amen
[2:00:20] why because we've got to be the light of
[2:00:21] the world the world will never see
[2:00:23] christ until he comes back in judgment
[2:00:26] all they see is us and then we go meet
[2:00:27] him in the air
[2:00:29] they never see christ in that in that
[2:00:30] corporal body in a way that they might
[2:00:32] possibly understand or recognize until
[2:00:35] he comes back with ten thousands by
[2:00:37] thousands of his saints amen
[2:00:39] listen to this he says now how are we
[2:00:41] planted were planted in christ jesus now
[2:00:43] i believe just in my estimation of him
[2:00:46] he's the inexhaustible fountain of life
[2:00:49] that you cannot exhaust his goodness
[2:00:51] remember we're talking about what
[2:00:53] hungering and thirsting for
[2:00:54] righteousness
[2:00:56] he says some people think oh i hate to
[2:00:58] call on god so much
[2:01:00] that's what he wants you to do you have
[2:01:03] not because you ask not you ask not
[2:01:05] because you believe not ask abundantly
[2:01:08] that your joys might be full
[2:01:10] but you've got to have your joy focused
[2:01:12] on the right thing and which is what the
[2:01:14] word of god coming out of your life
[2:01:17] not joyful because forgive me brother
[2:01:19] chad because you have a new house or
[2:01:20] because you have a new car or you have a
[2:01:22] rewarding career or you have an amazing
[2:01:24] spouse but your joy is full because what
[2:01:26] the word of god is living and improving
[2:01:28] itself in your life that's what we're
[2:01:30] looking for and we thank god for all the
[2:01:32] uh all the other stuff we're thankful
[2:01:34] that we have a house we're thankful we
[2:01:36] have cars we're thankful we have money
[2:01:37] in the bank that we have health in our
[2:01:38] bodies but our joy is full when we see
[2:01:40] the word coming through our lives and we
[2:01:42] see god expressing himself through us
[2:01:44] and we know we couldn't do it
[2:01:46] amen
[2:01:47] he says that's what god wants ask big
[2:01:50] things
[2:01:51] but watch the big things brother branham
[2:01:52] asks for he doesn't say i'm asking god
[2:01:54] for a million times a million dollars he
[2:01:56] didn't say i'm asking god for great
[2:01:58] health he didn't say i'm asking god for
[2:01:59] a great ministry he didn't ask for great
[2:02:01] fame and fortune
[2:02:03] he said i'm asking for hundreds of souls
[2:02:06] in this meeting i'm asking that every
[2:02:08] sick person that enters the door will go
[2:02:10] out of here well i'm believing it i'm
[2:02:13] believing that till we go there won't be
[2:02:15] another gathering together but it'll be
[2:02:17] a revival here satan's kept me out of
[2:02:19] here long enough and i believe the hour
[2:02:21] is here for a real sweeping revival in
[2:02:24] every church and around the country he's
[2:02:25] believing for what the word to go forth
[2:02:28] and have an effect
[2:02:30] that's what we ought to be praying for
[2:02:31] lord let your word have an effect in me
[2:02:35] in my brother in my sister and then let
[2:02:37] me act on it and let me help them and
[2:02:39] let me encourage them
[2:02:41] he didn't ask anything for himself he
[2:02:44] asked everything for the kingdom of god
[2:02:46] and for those that have a need in the
[2:02:47] kingdom of god that's how our joy is
[2:02:49] full uh my wife shared something with me
[2:02:51] the other a little while back and i
[2:02:53] think it was something along the lines
[2:02:54] of if you don't have joy or happiness do
[2:02:57] something for somebody else
[2:02:58] do something for somebody else and
[2:03:00] you'll see it fills up that love tank a
[2:03:01] little bit you know giving actually
[2:03:03] helps you not just the other person amen
[2:03:07] amen i didn't go home you know full of
[2:03:09] energy last night brother chad
[2:03:11] we put in a long day some of us guess
[2:03:13] what but i was satisfied when i laid my
[2:03:15] head on the pillow that night why
[2:03:16] because i went out and i helped somebody
[2:03:19] i was looking out for brother chad i
[2:03:21] wasn't feeling the best
[2:03:22] but i went out and i helped because
[2:03:24] brother chad needed help that's what we
[2:03:26] do
[2:03:26] that's what we do brother branham here
[2:03:28] he's saying i'm not asking for myself
[2:03:30] i'm asking for the kingdom of god i'm
[2:03:32] looking for the my joy to be fulfilled
[2:03:34] in what god having an effect in the
[2:03:36] people around us amen
[2:03:38] more of god that's what he's asking for
[2:03:40] more of god in you but that starts when
[2:03:42] i'm looking for that it's got to start
[2:03:44] with what less of me
[2:03:46] amen more god means less of me it's got
[2:03:48] to be there's only so much capacity in
[2:03:49] jonathan corlett and if i want more god
[2:03:51] or i want more faith then unbelief and
[2:03:53] jonathan corlett have to get out right
[2:03:55] to let more of it fill up that's all
[2:03:57] we're looking for we're just looking to
[2:03:58] give god more room inside of us that's
[2:04:00] how we're doing when brother braham says
[2:04:01] lift your level of faith all he's saying
[2:04:03] is you've only got so much in here go up
[2:04:05] here so that this falls out of the out
[2:04:06] of the vessel right get the junk out
[2:04:09] because that's what's holding you back
[2:04:10] till faith can co-opt and boom all of a
[2:04:11] sudden the word explodes out of your
[2:04:13] life amen
[2:04:14] what is it you want to recreate a
[2:04:15] relationship
[2:04:18] you know what i had to do and i had to
[2:04:19] get a when i wanted a closer
[2:04:20] relationship with god
[2:04:22] get out of love with myself
[2:04:26] drop the ego
[2:04:27] drop the facade
[2:04:28] and say lord i have need of you
[2:04:31] because guess what if you want more him
[2:04:33] that means that there's too much of you
[2:04:34] somewhere in your life and you got to
[2:04:36] stop looking at yourself and saying i'm
[2:04:37] as good as i think i am amen amen he is
[2:04:40] the one that's good none of us are good
[2:04:42] amen amen i'm not trying to be hard on
[2:04:44] you because i'm preaching to myself and
[2:04:45] i'm speaking from experience and i'm
[2:04:47] saying you can't get anywhere with god
[2:04:48] if you say i need him but you can
[2:04:49] actually express where you need him you
[2:04:52] got to look in the mirror god's word and
[2:04:53] say i am short
[2:04:54] i am short and i need you to raise me up
[2:04:56] to the level of the word amen
[2:04:58] it's a lot easier if we just have an one
[2:05:00] honest conversation with god will get
[2:05:02] you so far
[2:05:03] just sit there and say lord i am sick
[2:05:05] and tired of this
[2:05:06] i'm sick and tired of feeling this way
[2:05:08] looking this way whatever it might be
[2:05:11] i'm sick and tired of it and i need your
[2:05:13] grace to come in and change the
[2:05:14] situation in my life amen otherwise what
[2:05:17] remember we talked about religious
[2:05:19] spirits last time i was talking to
[2:05:20] somebody afterwards and and i i feel i
[2:05:22] didn't quite give it the full summary
[2:05:24] and here it is you know what a religious
[2:05:26] spirit is concerned about two things
[2:05:28] what the outside looked like and what
[2:05:30] other people are doing
[2:05:31] you know what the holy spirit is
[2:05:32] concerned with what the inside looks
[2:05:34] like and what i'm doing
[2:05:37] so guess what if i've got a religious
[2:05:38] spirit all i'm going to look at is
[2:05:40] brother bob and how people perceive me
[2:05:43] i've got the holy spirit that all i'm
[2:05:44] going to be doing is looking at me in
[2:05:46] the mirror of god's word and i'm going
[2:05:47] to be looking for my attitude and my
[2:05:49] spirit inside of me to be right
[2:05:51] regardless of what the outside expresses
[2:05:53] amen because guess what the only person
[2:05:55] that knows my attitude inside is me
[2:05:57] guess what it ain't always pretty
[2:05:59] it ain't always pretty when i talk about
[2:06:00] skeptical and cynical that's something
[2:06:02] jonathan corlett has dealt with all of
[2:06:04] his life
[2:06:05] right
[2:06:06] so what i've got to get that and i've
[2:06:07] got to take to god and say that is not
[2:06:09] helping me it's hindering me will you
[2:06:11] take it away and guess you know what
[2:06:13] feeds it when i feed on the right things
[2:06:15] and when i feed on the wrong things
[2:06:17] guess what cynicism comes up you get
[2:06:18] prickly these different things right but
[2:06:20] if i feed it right it'll go away because
[2:06:22] god i'm giving god something to work
[2:06:23] with that's what i'm doing amen remember
[2:06:25] brother says you just gotta drink drink
[2:06:27] drink drink from what caused you to grow
[2:06:28] in the first place keep drinking that
[2:06:30] and it'll do the work in you amen
[2:06:32] otherwise
[2:06:34] you know what it is jesus called the
[2:06:35] pharisees white and sepulchers he says
[2:06:37] you are perfect on the outside you're
[2:06:38] whitewashed you're clean everything
[2:06:40] looks great but he says inside is just
[2:06:41] rotting corpses right that's what a
[2:06:43] religious spirit does to us it makes us
[2:06:45] look good but we're horrible on the
[2:06:46] inside amen but for the faithful
[2:06:48] believer all they care about is one
[2:06:49] thing let the word be born and grow and
[2:06:52] express itself in my life and that's all
[2:06:54] i care about that is all i care about
[2:06:56] ephesians 1 says this having
[2:06:58] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[2:07:00] children by jesus christ to himself
[2:07:02] according to the good pleasure of his
[2:07:04] will to the praise of the glory of his
[2:07:07] grace wherein he hath made us acceptable
[2:07:10] in the beloved so there's nothing in
[2:07:11] here that reflects my gifts my talents
[2:07:13] my my my carnality my body my looks my
[2:07:16] anything nothing here it says we are
[2:07:19] what it is the good pleasure of his will
[2:07:20] that's doing this and what we're doing
[2:07:22] is to the praise of the glory of his
[2:07:24] grace everything i'm doing not to point
[2:07:26] back to the grace of god not to jonathan
[2:07:29] corlett
[2:07:30] everything ought to point back to the
[2:07:31] grace of god in our lives amen amen so
[2:07:34] if you say you have faith it ought to
[2:07:36] bring praise and glory to god and his
[2:07:38] grace amen that's where it will point to
[2:07:40] every time because it's not your faith
[2:07:42] it's the faith that god gave you in the
[2:07:43] first place amen if you want faith
[2:07:46] let me put it this way if you want faith
[2:07:48] look for something that'll bring praise
[2:07:49] and glory to god amen right
[2:07:52] because that's what the faith is for
[2:07:53] it's to bring praise and glory to god
[2:07:54] not to yourself
[2:07:56] amen brother braham says there's many
[2:07:57] promises in here that my faith is not
[2:08:00] strong enough to produce it
[2:08:02] that's a man that did the works of jesus
[2:08:03] christ and he says there's still things
[2:08:04] in here that i can't do
[2:08:07] but i'll never stand in somebody else's
[2:08:08] way who have faith enough to do it i may
[2:08:10] not never shout down a wall like joshua
[2:08:13] or i might never not never take an
[2:08:14] evening walk like enoch did and go home
[2:08:16] with him without dying i may not be able
[2:08:18] to do that but i'll never stand in
[2:08:20] somebody else's way that's got faith
[2:08:21] enough to do it that's one thing yes sir
[2:08:24] now catch this he says as long as you're
[2:08:26] trying to do something to help people
[2:08:28] and glorify god coming from this bible
[2:08:32] he says what there's a word basis for it
[2:08:34] i'm thanking god for the old time holy
[2:08:36] spirit salvation and the power of god
[2:08:39] returning back to the church again amen
[2:08:42] amen we're working to answer that
[2:08:43] question how do i get faith or how do i
[2:08:45] get more faith or how do i let it work
[2:08:46] in my life and i want to end with just a
[2:08:48] couple of quotes here as we close it
[2:08:50] down
[2:08:51] he said after jesus rose from the dead
[2:08:54] his words were constantly fear not
[2:08:57] that's what the trouble with the church
[2:08:59] today is scared to death you're going to
[2:09:02] make a failure how can you fail when
[2:09:05] you're in christ
[2:09:08] you can't fail you've got everlasting
[2:09:10] life all demons in hell can't shake you
[2:09:13] you got everlasting life jesus said so
[2:09:16] so don't be scared of failure you say
[2:09:18] well i'm afraid i'll get fanatic
[2:09:20] i don't think we have that problem here
[2:09:22] because what we're faithful we are
[2:09:24] fanatics
[2:09:26] right brother brother bob we go to mass
[2:09:28] twice a week right as his neighbors say
[2:09:31] he's a fanatic
[2:09:33] he's a fanatic
[2:09:35] guess what our sisters with their
[2:09:38] beautiful hair and their long flowing
[2:09:39] dresses they're fanatics
[2:09:42] we give 10 plus of our money every month
[2:09:45] to the unseen god
[2:09:48] to pay for fallen men to get up here and
[2:09:49] preach the word to us
[2:09:51] okay we're fanatics already if you don't
[2:09:54] think you are you already are
[2:09:55] right brother chad we shot him praise
[2:09:57] don't we
[2:09:58] brother chad's a fanatic brother ellie
[2:10:00] you are definitely a fanatic
[2:10:03] amen brother gerald 100 infinite we're
[2:10:05] fanatics half of us have lost family
[2:10:07] relations because we're such fanatics
[2:10:09] amen so i don't believe we're worried
[2:10:11] about fanatics but he says what a
[2:10:13] fanatic that what will take god and step
[2:10:15] out on his word
[2:10:16] keep going in your fanaticism can i tell
[2:10:18] you to do that keep being fanatical
[2:10:20] about the promises of the word of god i
[2:10:22] want to be a fanatical person amen
[2:10:25] we have these sports teams and people
[2:10:27] are fans that means they're fanatical
[2:10:29] about it can you imagine being caught up
[2:10:31] in a team so badly that you get up there
[2:10:33] and scream and shout and holler and hoot
[2:10:35] and dance
[2:10:36] and yet you serve the very living
[2:10:38] eternal god and we can't shoot
[2:10:40] we can shoot shout and holler and dance
[2:10:43] amen we're fanatical we ought to be
[2:10:45] fanatical about these things he says but
[2:10:47] what i'd rather have a little fanaticism
[2:10:49] than to sit still and do nothing i sure
[2:10:51] would like a lump on a
[2:10:53] like a bump on a log
[2:10:55] in the bottom of the sea
[2:10:56] sit there and do nothing rotting away
[2:10:58] man
[2:10:59] so how do you let faith work in you he
[2:11:01] says what cast out fear
[2:11:03] don't worry don't fret don't dwell on
[2:11:04] the circumstances he says ask that your
[2:11:06] joy may be full sometimes our problem is
[2:11:08] we won't even ask
[2:11:11] we're so scared he won't do it that we
[2:11:13] don't even ask
[2:11:14] he says ask that your joy may be full
[2:11:18] he says when this takes place the thing
[2:11:20] you'll do then you'll find out that the
[2:11:21] spirit that comes in you from the new
[2:11:23] birth you will believe and do everything
[2:11:25] that god says in his word is for you to
[2:11:28] do
[2:11:29] so each of us has a thing to do and
[2:11:31] guess what it's not going to look the
[2:11:32] same for sister priscilla as it is for
[2:11:34] sister maureen it's not going to look
[2:11:36] the same for brother josh as it is for
[2:11:37] brother chad but as god points to the
[2:11:40] word your thing to do then do it
[2:11:42] and be fanatical about it
[2:11:44] be fanatical about doing what god has
[2:11:46] called you to do amen but make sure it's
[2:11:48] based on the word of god that's what he
[2:11:50] keeps pointing us back to he says in
[2:11:52] everything that the bible quotes for you
[2:11:54] to do you'll punctuate it with an amen
[2:11:56] and you'll not stop day and night until
[2:12:00] you receive it wow
[2:12:02] that's right that's right and and all
[2:12:04] this time you certainly above everything
[2:12:07] bear the fruit of the spirit that tells
[2:12:09] you who put that desire in you is that
[2:12:12] is your desire bringing out the fruit of
[2:12:14] the spirit or is it bringing out what
[2:12:16] frustration
[2:12:17] anger
[2:12:18] disappointment all these things amen you
[2:12:21] gotta look for the fruit of the spirit
[2:12:23] to come out of what you're getting while
[2:12:24] you're holding on to the promise waiting
[2:12:26] for god to come out of you amen
[2:12:29] amen a believer is known by what
[2:12:31] believing
[2:12:32] faith holding on to the promises of god
[2:12:34] whether it's abraham for 25 years and
[2:12:36] yet died have he not received the city
[2:12:38] for which he searched
[2:12:40] he got the promise of the son but he
[2:12:41] didn't get to see you know multiply by
[2:12:44] multiply to to the sands of the sea but
[2:12:46] he still believed and he acted on today
[2:12:48] man that's what a believer is known by
[2:12:49] acting on the promises of god amen
[2:12:52] doesn't mean that you have to always sit
[2:12:53] and yell and cry and shout
[2:12:55] no
[2:12:56] there's a rest that comes with these
[2:12:57] different things amen you don't have to
[2:12:59] lay on your bed till god brings it and
[2:13:01] then you can move forward in faith
[2:13:02] believing that he's he's what he's heard
[2:13:05] your cry the master has heard your cry
[2:13:07] amen and what even if he comes on the
[2:13:09] fourth day and it's way too late and
[2:13:11] corruption's already set in
[2:13:13] you know whether it's looking to our
[2:13:14] kids that need salvation whether it's
[2:13:16] looking for healing in our body whether
[2:13:17] it's looking in our marriages whether
[2:13:19] it's looking in our walk with god and
[2:13:20] say it seems like nothing's moving it
[2:13:22] has no effect on the believer because
[2:13:24] what they keep pressing onward amen god
[2:13:28] bless you let's stand if you would this
[2:13:29] morning amen
[2:13:30] amen there's a time for yelling there's
[2:13:33] a time for shouting there's a time for
[2:13:34] asking there's a time for crying and
[2:13:36] then there's that time that follows that
[2:13:38] and that's a time for resting amen
[2:13:40] you'll see with ruth after she did
[2:13:41] everything she could she took that
[2:13:43] promise and she went home and she rested
[2:13:45] and then she trusted that he was going
[2:13:47] to do what he said what is it lord i
[2:13:49] believe your word it's all he's looking
[2:13:50] for us to say lord i believe your word
[2:13:52] and then you act like you believe his
[2:13:54] word that gives him room to operate in
[2:13:56] our lives why scripture says what that
[2:13:57] he's working all things for our good
[2:14:00] all things that he's doing he's working
[2:14:02] for our good whether it looks bad
[2:14:03] weather looks great doesn't matter it's
[2:14:05] all for the good of the believer because
[2:14:06] he's bringing us towards that image that
[2:14:08] he has for us amen
[2:14:10] amen let's bow our heads together lord
[2:14:12] jesus
[2:14:15] lord you always challenge us
[2:14:18] and lord in preaching so much of this
[2:14:19] this morning lord i see the great need
[2:14:21] in my own life heavenly father
[2:14:23] and lord i know that each one is looking
[2:14:25] to themselves lord
[2:14:26] and lord and we want to say that we're
[2:14:28] looking for more of you
[2:14:30] but lord we're trusting in the word that
[2:14:32] the work that you started in us you're
[2:14:34] going to complete it heavenly father and
[2:14:36] lord we have those that have many
[2:14:38] requests in their mind lord some spoken
[2:14:40] some unspoken lord needs in their bodies
[2:14:43] lord needs in their lives needs in their
[2:14:45] relationships needs in their finances
[2:14:47] lord needs in their jobs needs in their
[2:14:49] relationship with you
[2:14:51] lord we pray that you administer to
[2:14:52] these hearts and souls lord not just in
[2:14:54] this service lord but lord as we come
[2:14:56] into these set of special meetings
[2:14:58] heavenly father we pray that your holy
[2:14:59] spirit would just come down in such a
[2:15:01] real way lord that touch hungry hearts
[2:15:03] lord that you would just minister and
[2:15:05] make yourself real to each one that's
[2:15:07] here heavenly father
[2:15:09] lord grant us grace to lift above all
[2:15:10] these little things lord these little
[2:15:12] skepticals lord as the other prophet
[2:15:14] called it these these little attitudes
[2:15:16] these little unbeliefs lord these little
[2:15:18] habits lord may we willingly set them
[2:15:20] aside lord trusting that the benefit of
[2:15:22] them will be a greater faith living
[2:15:24] inside of us we pray
[2:15:26] lord touch our people once again in
[2:15:28] jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen
[2:15:31] let's sing that song touch your people
[2:15:32] once again i i don't have it marked here
[2:15:34] but
[2:15:36] do we oh we don't know that one i'm so
[2:15:38] sorry all right
[2:15:40] he is able more than able 721 to
[2:15:43] accomplish that
[2:15:44] which concerns me today amen
