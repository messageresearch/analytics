[15:22] Let's sing at
[15:32] 668. I just feel like something good is
[15:36] about to
[15:38] happen. I just feel like something good
[15:41] is on his way.
[15:45] He has promised that he'd open all of
[15:50] heaven. And brother, this could happen
[15:54] any
[15:55] day when God's people humble themselves
[15:59] to call on
[16:02] Jesus and they look to heaven extracting
[16:05] as they
[16:08] pray. I just feel like something good is
[16:11] about to happen.
[16:15] And brother, this could be that very
[16:18] day.
[16:19] Man, I have learned in all that happens
[16:24] just to praise
[16:26] him. For I know he's working all things
[16:30] for my good
[16:32] man. Every fear I shed is worth the
[16:38] investment. For I know he'll see me
[16:41] through. He said he
[16:44] would. He has promised I know here can
[16:48] hardly
[16:50] fathom. All the things he has in store
[16:54] for those who
[16:56] pray. I just feel like something good is
[17:00] about to
[17:03] happen. And brother, this could be that
[17:06] very day.
[17:10] matter. All the bad news in the
[17:15] paper and it seems like things are
[17:18] bleaker every
[17:21] day. But for this child of God, it makes
[17:25] no
[17:27] difference because it's bound to get
[17:30] better either way.
[17:33] Man, I've never been more thrilled about
[17:39] tomorrow. Sunshine's always bursting
[17:42] through the skies of
[17:45] gray. I just feel like something good is
[17:49] about to
[17:52] happen. And brother, this could be this
[17:55] very day.
[17:57] Man, I just feel like something good is
[18:01] about to
[18:03] happen. And I just feel like something
[18:06] good is on its way,
[18:10] man. He has promised that it open all of
[18:14] heaven.
[18:16] [Applause]
[18:17] And brother, this could happen any
[18:22] day when God's people humbled themselves
[18:26] and call on
[18:28] Jesus and they look to heaven expecting
[18:32] as they
[18:34] pray. I just feel like something good is
[18:38] about to
[18:41] happen. And brother, this could be that
[18:44] very day. One more time. I just feel
[18:48] like something good is about to
[18:53] happen. I just feel like something good
[18:56] is on its
[18:59] way. He has promised that it open all of
[19:03] heaven.
[19:06] And brother, this could happen any
[19:11] day. When God's people humble themselves
[19:15] and call on
[19:17] Jesus, and they look to heaven,
[19:20] expecting it as they
[19:23] pray. I just feel like something good is
[19:27] about to happen.
[19:31] And brother, this could be the very
[19:35] day.
[19:39] Amen. Welcome everyone here this
[19:42] morning. Some prayer requests. Sister
[19:45] Laura Snow, just want to continue to
[19:47] remember her in prayer. U she's holding
[19:49] steady and uh it's been some good
[19:51] reports that I I'll share hopefully
[19:53] later today. Um, sister Becky is uh in
[19:56] Toronto for a couple weeks and uh so
[19:59] she's not with us, but um just keep her
[20:01] in prayer. She's visiting family and so
[20:03] forth. Uh brother Kachi, brother
[20:06] Kingsley said he's he's doing better.
[20:08] His skin is cleared up for the most
[20:09] part. So we thank the Lord for that.
[20:11] Brother John's eye want to continue to
[20:13] keep that in prayer and that he'd just
[20:15] be able to get a procedure done to uh to
[20:17] take care of it. Sister Cordella s
[20:21] brother
[20:22] Nelson any of the other needs. Uh my

[43:10] [Music]
[43:13] Behold, lift me up and I
[43:19] shall not be
[43:21] moved. He
[43:24] gaveth me strength as my day. Thank you,
[43:30] Lord.
[43:32] He
[43:34] hideth my
[43:37] soul in the cliff.
[43:40] The
[43:42] rock that
[43:45] shadows search I
[43:48] thirsty land.
[43:53] He
[43:55] hideeth my
[43:57] life in the depths of his
[44:03] love and
[44:05] comes me there with his
[44:13] hand and
[44:15] covers me there with his
[44:23] And with
[44:27] numberless
[44:28] blessings
[44:31] each he
[44:34] crowns and fill with his
[44:38] fullness
[44:43] divine. I sing in my rapure.
[44:50] Oh,
[44:51] glory to
[44:54] God for
[44:56] such a
[44:59] redeemer as mine.
[45:05] He
[45:06] hideth my
[45:09] soul in the
[45:11] cl above the
[45:14] rock that
[45:17] shadows the dry
[45:20] thirsty land.
[45:25] He
[45:27] hides my
[45:29] life in the depths of his
[45:35] love and
[45:37] covers me there with his
[45:45] hand and
[45:47] covers me there with his hand. Let's
[45:55] stand. When clothed in his
[46:00] brightness,
[46:03] transported I
[46:05] rise to meet him in clouds of the
[46:14] sky.
[46:17] His
[46:18] perfect
[46:21] salation, his
[46:24] oneful
[46:26] love. I'll
[46:29] shout with the
[46:31] millions on my mouth.
[46:37] He
[46:39] hideeth my
[46:41] soul in the
[46:44] cl of the
[46:47] rock
[46:49] shadow of dry
[46:52] thirsty lamp.
[46:57] He
[46:59] hideth my
[47:01] life in the depths of his
[47:07] love and
[47:09] covers me there with his
[47:17] hand and
[47:19] covers me there with his hand.
[47:27] Hallelujah. Lord, what a day that will
[47:30] be, Lord. I can't even
[47:33] fathom, Lord. The feeling, the
[47:36] thought, Lord, the emotions that would
[47:38] run through us as that
[47:40] happens. But Lord, we're here to give
[47:42] you praise now. Lord, we're here to
[47:45] worship you now. We're here to thank you
[47:46] now. We're here to give you our all now,
[47:49] Lord, before that ever happens. Lord, as
[47:51] we live in faith, Lord, by your word,
[47:53] Lord, as we commit ourselves to you
[47:55] completely, Lord God, looking forward to
[47:57] that day, Lord, of full adoption, of
[47:59] full redemption for each one of us,
[48:01] heavenly father. Lord, we're looking for
[48:03] that day, Lord. We're crying out for
[48:04] that day. But Lord, until that day, I
[48:07] pray you give us faith to live, Lord.
[48:09] Faith to believe, faith to trust, faith
[48:11] to rest, Lord, faith in the assurance
[48:14] that your word does what it says,
[48:15] heavenly father. Lord, so just take your
[48:18] word again this morning, Lord. Quicken
[48:20] us to it, Lord. Make it live in our
[48:21] lives. Change us, Lord, by it. We pray.
[48:24] Let your spirit have full control, Lord.
[48:26] We ask. In Jesus Christ's name we pray
[48:28] it this morning. Amen. Amen. God bless
[48:31] you. Turn if you would to First John 4
[48:33] again. 1 John 4. I'm excited to preach
[48:36] this morning. It's always nice to come
[48:38] with a message of that you feel is just
[48:40] going to encourage the people and it's
[48:42] always a joy to do that. Amen. We've got
[48:44] some good news this morning. Brother
[48:45] Garfield notified me earlier this week
[48:47] that he did pass all of his exams. So,
[48:49] we thank the Lord for that. Amen. It's
[48:51] not easy to do. And uh he's made it
[48:53] through unscathed. So, we're thankful
[48:55] for that. He'll also take the service on
[48:56] Wednesday now that he's got a bit of
[48:58] time on his hands. He's he's jumped back
[49:00] into the word in a in a more full-time
[49:02] basis. So, uh we're thankful for that.
[49:03] So, he'll take the service on Wednesday.
[49:05] So, please remember him in prayer. Also,
[49:07] Blanca and Selena fly out to California
[49:09] on Thursday for a little over a week.
[49:12] So, uh remember them, remember
[49:14] me, remember the children. Amen.
[49:17] Remember the children. but that God
[49:19] would give them traveling mercies. I
[49:20] also have a a uh consult with a plastic
[49:23] surgeon on Thursday to look at my eye to
[49:25] see if she can help me. Uh this is
[49:27] outside of the Newfoundland Medical
[49:28] System, so I'd have to pay for it if
[49:30] she's able to do it. But uh we'll see
[49:32] what the Lord would have, but I'm
[49:33] meeting with her Thursday morning as
[49:34] well. So, we're just committing all
[49:36] things into the Lord's hands. Amen.
[49:38] Amen. God bless you. Enjoyed the song
[49:40] service this morning, sitting in there.
[49:42] Amen. Would have loved to be out, but
[49:43] just in there dwelling on the service
[49:45] this morning. So, God bless you. Let's
[49:47] read John 1 John chapter
[49:49] 4. Verse four says, "Ye are of God,
[49:52] little children, and have overcome
[49:54] them." Notice it's a present tense
[49:57] condition. You're an overcomer now. But
[50:00] it's a past tense overcoming. It's
[50:02] already been defeated. You've already
[50:04] won. You're an overcomer right now.
[50:07] Amen. He says, "Because greater is he
[50:09] that is in you than he that is in the
[50:11] world." Jumping down to verse 18. There
[50:13] is no fear in love, but perfect love
[50:15] casteth out fear because fear had
[50:18] torment. He that fearth is not made
[50:21] perfect in love. Amen. God bless you.
[50:23] You can have your seats this morning.
[50:24] We're continuing our series on the Holy
[50:26] Ghost and this thought of no room for
[50:28] fear. I'm taking a fourth part this
[50:30] morning and we're moving on from the
[50:31] idea of of the fear that comes from
[50:33] legalisms and dos and don'ts, which was
[50:35] the mindset of the law of Moses where it
[50:38] was the law of sin and death. It was a
[50:39] spirit of fear that what you did was
[50:42] what you got and that was just the way
[50:43] it was. Amen. And your life and your
[50:45] results were based purely on your
[50:47] actions. And if you did the wrong
[50:48] action, you got a bad result. If you did
[50:50] the right action, you got a good result.
[50:52] Why? Because it was a law. The law was
[50:54] there. And unfortunately, the law only
[50:56] condemned. The law only condemned. And
[50:59] there was a price to be paid if you
[51:00] broke that law. And the price was never
[51:02] a good price to pay. And then to make
[51:03] matters worse, as we talked about, the
[51:05] ministry came along and they added to
[51:07] the law and they gave their own ideas
[51:08] and their own thoughts and more rules
[51:10] and even with the best of intentions,
[51:12] all it did was bind the people up and it
[51:13] made them more fearful for how they were
[51:15] living their life. And they expanded it
[51:17] way beyond what God had told them to do.
[51:19] And so they're looking over their
[51:20] shoulder for judgment. They break this
[51:22] little law, this little idea, this
[51:24] little ism, and then they thought that
[51:25] God was going to judge them and it bound
[51:26] them up in fear. And remember what we
[51:29] said, there are absolutes in scripture.
[51:31] There are absolute dos and there are
[51:33] absolute don'ts. And if you do what you
[51:35] weren't supposed to do, then there's a
[51:36] price to pay. And if you do what you're
[51:39] supposed to do, then there's a price to
[51:41] be gained. There's a blessing in those
[51:42] things as well. Amen. The word has
[51:44] absolutes. And when we cross absolutes,
[51:46] it shows there's a problem somewhere.
[51:48] Amen. If the word says don't do it and
[51:49] we do it, there's a problem somewhere in
[51:51] our life. Amen. Does God have
[51:52] disobedient
[51:55] children? Two. Bishel and my wife.
[52:00] Does God have disobedient children? The
[52:02] scripture says that he chastises us. And
[52:05] you don't chastise somebody unless
[52:07] they've done something wrong, unless
[52:08] they're disobedient. But the difference
[52:10] between now and then, before he did it
[52:12] by the law, now he does it for our good.
[52:15] Amen. It has a purpose. When God gives
[52:17] us a a spank and when God corrects us,
[52:19] when God makes things tough on us, it's
[52:21] for our good to bring us forward into
[52:23] what he's trying to take us into and to
[52:25] take us out of what we thought was good
[52:27] in the first place, what we thought
[52:28] would do us some benefit in our life.
[52:30] Amen. But we know that we disobey at
[52:32] times. Sometimes it's not absolute
[52:34] disobedience. Isn't that the sneaky way
[52:36] we do it? See, sometimes he tells us
[52:38] what to do, but we say, "We'll do it,
[52:40] but not now." We're off on the timing.
[52:43] Sometimes it's partial obedience. You
[52:46] know what partial obedience is, church?
[52:48] Disobedience. If you don't go all the
[52:50] way, then you never obeyed in the first
[52:52] place. And so, and sometimes we'll take
[52:54] our disobedience and we'll spiritualize
[52:56] it. But it's still
[52:58] disobedience. And then sometimes we just
[53:00] let the natural, we let the physical
[53:02] there. We say, "This is just the way it
[53:04] is." And God will understand. We talked
[53:06] about this last service. God will
[53:08] understand if I don't do this. God will
[53:10] understand if I just have to let this
[53:11] slide for a while. Church. God doesn't
[53:13] understand. God doesn't understand. What
[53:15] he knows is that you don't have faith.
[53:17] Because if his word says he'll do what
[53:19] he says he's going to do and you act a
[53:21] different way, it shows there's unbelief
[53:23] there. And God doesn't understand that.
[53:25] God doesn't understand that in the life
[53:26] of a believer. And God is not okay with
[53:28] it. Now remember, we're coming out of
[53:30] that spirit of fear under the law of sin
[53:32] and death under the law of Moses. We
[53:34] could say that. But watch what Paul says
[53:36] now in Galatians 6. Okay? This is under
[53:38] the law of grace. But he says,
[53:40] "Brothers, be not deceived. God is not
[53:43] mocked. He says God won't be making a
[53:45] fool of. And he's bringing us back to a
[53:47] principle. He says, "For whatsoever a
[53:49] man seweth, that shall he also reap. For
[53:53] he that sweth to the flesh shall of the
[53:55] flesh reap corruption, but he that sweth
[53:58] to the spirit shall of the spirit reap
[54:00] life everlasting." He says, "And let us
[54:02] not be weary in welloing." Church,
[54:04] welloing is a long game. Wellodoing does
[54:08] not you do it today, you get it today.
[54:10] welloing is you do it today, you reap it
[54:12] sometime in the future. Right? Satan is
[54:15] looking for you don't need to be weary
[54:17] because I'll give it to you today. It's
[54:18] all temporal. It's all right now. But it
[54:21] doesn't last. Nothing you plant grows in
[54:23] a day. But Satan will try and tell you
[54:26] that. Satan will try and tell you. But
[54:28] he says, Paul says, "Let us not be
[54:30] wearying and welloing." Amen. It's a
[54:32] long game. It's a long way of living.
[54:34] It's looking for the future, not just
[54:36] the present. He says, "For in due season
[54:39] we shall reap if we faint not." You'll
[54:41] notice there's a time for planting and
[54:42] there's a time for harvesting. And it's
[54:44] not the same day unfortunately in most
[54:46] cases. But what we see here is this
[54:48] great seed principle of God. And this is
[54:50] really where we're going to be focused
[54:52] on this morning is this idea of the seed
[54:54] principle. Amen. You can't sew
[54:56] something. Today we'd say you can't
[54:58] plant something and get something
[55:00] different. You can't plant a corn seed
[55:02] and get an apple tree. You can't do it.
[55:05] No matter how much you try, no matter
[55:06] how much you water it, no matter how
[55:08] much you change its environment, you
[55:10] can't change that seed. So whatever you
[55:13] plant is what you're going to get. No
[55:15] matter how much you pray over it, no
[55:18] matter how much you spiritualize it, no
[55:20] matter how much reasons you give for it,
[55:22] you can't change what you've
[55:24] sowed. What you sow is what you're going
[55:26] to get. That's the seed principle of God
[55:29] from the beginning. And this is where
[55:31] we're going in this service today. So
[55:32] just stay with me. Amen. Brother Bam,
[55:35] Paul Paul tells us this is under grace
[55:37] now, but you still reap what you sow. He
[55:40] says God won't be made a fool of because
[55:42] this is the original. This is the
[55:43] Genesis principle is what you sow is
[55:46] what you get. And this can be a blessing
[55:48] or this can be a curse. I like what
[55:50] brother Bram says. He says, "Whatever
[55:52] life you live, that's whatever life you
[55:54] reap." See, it's our daily decisions
[55:57] that we make. It's the life that we
[55:58] live, the choices we make today
[56:00] determines what's going to happen down
[56:02] the road. Amen. You can't put God on the
[56:05] back burner today and expect the
[56:06] supernatural tomorrow. It doesn't work
[56:09] that way. You can't put God in second
[56:11] place and accept him to do a first place
[56:13] God thing in the in the day tomorrow.
[56:15] You can't do that. You can't spend today
[56:18] and expect money in the bank account
[56:20] tomorrow. Amen. You have to save today
[56:22] to have money in the bank account
[56:23] tomorrow. Amen. You can't ignore your
[56:26] family today and expect to have a
[56:27] tight-knit family tomorrow. That's not
[56:29] the way that it works. Amen. That's the
[56:31] negative side of this. But I'm not here
[56:33] to preach the negative. Amen. I'm
[56:34] talking to believers. So I believe that
[56:36] every word that we have ought to be a
[56:39] promise. So it's not saying don't go
[56:42] plant bad seeds. It's saying plant good
[56:44] seeds. Plant the right thing and you'll
[56:46] get the right thing out of your life.
[56:48] Amen. I'd rather preach a carrot than a
[56:50] stick this morning if it's okay. We're
[56:52] going to preach a carrot this morning.
[56:53] Amen. But if you go to a place where God
[56:55] is a priority in your life, then you can
[56:58] expect the supernatural in your life.
[57:00] Amen. When you give God first place, you
[57:02] can expect him to give you first place.
[57:04] Amen. When you give your all, you can
[57:06] expect all of him. Amen. You're planting
[57:09] one thing to reap the other thing. It
[57:11] comes down to what you're doing. And and
[57:13] Satan is only focused on getting us to
[57:15] look at today, here, and now. And God's
[57:18] trying to point us to what's coming down
[57:20] the road. And that's what the spirit of
[57:22] God will always do. Amen. That's why we
[57:23] live a harder life than most people,
[57:25] naturally speaking, as believers. Amen.
[57:27] why we sacrifice the comforts and the
[57:29] eases and the enjoyment of today because
[57:32] we're looking for certainty in the
[57:34] future. We're looking for something down
[57:36] the road that is guaranteed. So many of
[57:38] us sacrifice our our
[57:40] careers. We don't work on the weekends.
[57:43] We don't work on Sundays. We don't work
[57:45] on Wednesdays. We probably only have one
[57:47] person working in the home. And so we
[57:49] don't have as much money as some people.
[57:52] You look at a car payment today, you
[57:53] look at the average car is about $50,000
[57:56] in Canada. You do that over five years,
[57:58] that's a,000 bucks a month for a car.
[58:00] You need two of them, you've got $2,000
[58:02] a month a year. $2,000 a month for five
[58:04] years. How many of us have $2,000 a
[58:06] month to have cars in our in our
[58:08] driveways? But what do you do? You look
[58:09] around and everybody's got two new cars.
[58:12] We
[58:13] sacrifice. We don't have an easy time of
[58:15] it. We don't all get new cars. We don't
[58:17] all get big houses. We don't all have
[58:19] the same career progression as other
[58:20] people. Why? Because it doesn't have
[58:22] first place. We're planting what really
[58:25] matters and everything else goes by the
[58:27] wayside and it is what it is. We have
[58:29] what we have. We sacrifice our finances.
[58:32] I don't know how many of you look at
[58:33] your receipt slip at the end of the
[58:34] year. You look at that and you say, "Oh
[58:36] my goodness, that's a lot of money I
[58:37] paid in
[58:39] tithes." And if you're carnal, you'll
[58:41] say, "What could I do with that money?"
[58:44] But see, if you're spiritual, you'll
[58:45] say, "What happened with that money?
[58:47] What did I gain from that? What did I
[58:49] gain from that?" What you gained is a
[58:51] promise. Do you know that tithing is one
[58:53] of the only promises in the book where
[58:54] God says, "I'll magnify it."
[58:58] I'll magnify it more than you put in.
[58:59] I'll give you back out. Haven't we seen
[59:01] that? Amen. I I remember I had somebody
[59:04] asking me about tithing. I brought
[59:05] mother brother Matt over to testify. I
[59:07] said, "Don, I don't want to just give
[59:09] you scriptures. Let me give you a
[59:10] personal example." Brother Matt came
[59:12] over and he talked about the he had
[59:13] almost a full year off and he came out
[59:15] with a better credit score than he went
[59:17] in. Why? Because God magnifies.
[59:21] God blesses above and beyond what we
[59:24] could ask or think. But we sacrifice in
[59:26] the here and now for certainty down the
[59:28] road. Why, church? Because we're looking
[59:30] for a city whose builder and maker is
[59:32] God. Amen. We're working for a different
[59:34] kingdom. We're fighting for a different
[59:36] result than everybody in this world is
[59:38] fighting for. And so we live a life that
[59:40] speaking naturally is much more
[59:43] difficult. And I'm speaking now from a
[59:44] worldly standpoint, from a carnal
[59:46] standpoint. Amen. They call it
[59:48] sacrifices. We call it
[59:51] planting. Why? Because we know, we
[59:53] believe that there's something that
[59:54] comes down the road. We believe that if
[59:56] you do what the word of God says, then
[59:58] you get what the word of God says. And
[1:00:00] that's why we do it. There's something
[1:00:01] in us that does that. And planting is a
[1:00:03] hard is a lot of hard work, isn't it,
[1:00:05] church. Making the right decisions, a
[1:00:07] lot of hard work. But I'll tell you
[1:00:10] this, I've never had somebody come back
[1:00:12] when they're reaping their good harvest
[1:00:13] and say, "Boy, I really wish I hadn't
[1:00:15] done this." Nobody does that. When you
[1:00:18] reap the good results of a good
[1:00:20] planting, nobody comes back and says,
[1:00:22] "Oh man, I really wasted my time. This
[1:00:25] was not worth it." Everybody loves the
[1:00:27] good harvest. Nobody likes the good
[1:00:30] planting. Cuz good planting's hard. It's
[1:00:33] a long game. It's a daily game. But what
[1:00:35] do we find? We find those that planted
[1:00:37] for
[1:00:38] today down the road, they reap exactly
[1:00:41] that thing. And what do they say? I wish
[1:00:42] I knew how this was going to turn out.
[1:00:44] I'd have never have done that. I wish I
[1:00:46] could go back and fix it. Or worst of
[1:00:48] all, it's done and I can't change it
[1:00:51] anymore. Why? Planting for today instead
[1:00:54] of planting for tomorrow. Planting what
[1:00:56] feels good, what looks good, what this
[1:00:59] body enjoys, what this flesh
[1:01:01] enjoys. But I'll tell you this, church,
[1:01:03] it's never too late to make the right
[1:01:05] decision. You can't change what's in the
[1:01:07] past, but you can change what's ahead.
[1:01:10] And whether you're 92 or 22, it doesn't
[1:01:13] matter. Leaving those things which are
[1:01:15] behind. Paul said, "I press towards the
[1:01:17] mark of the prize of the high calling in
[1:01:19] Christ Jesus." It's never too late to
[1:01:20] make the right decision. Amen. That's
[1:01:23] what the new birth is all about. The old
[1:01:26] man dies. The old life dies. The old
[1:01:29] decisions die. You may carry scars
[1:01:30] forward, but you're planting now in a
[1:01:33] completely different way, and you're
[1:01:34] going to reap a completely different
[1:01:35] result because of it. That's for free
[1:01:38] this morning. Amen. I want to take us
[1:01:40] back to Romans 8. And we're speaking on
[1:01:41] this idea of no room for fear. And
[1:01:43] there's a reason that Paul would tie
[1:01:45] together the true baptism of the Holy
[1:01:47] Spirit, the new birth with setting us
[1:01:49] free from fear. And that's what I want
[1:01:50] to talk about today. And Paul says in
[1:01:52] Romans 8:11, he says, "But if the spirit
[1:01:54] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[1:01:56] dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[1:01:58] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:02:01] your mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:02:04] dwells in you." Amen. The Holy Spirit is
[1:02:06] quickening power. That word quicken
[1:02:08] means to make alive. It takes that which
[1:02:10] was dead and he makes it live. Amen. And
[1:02:14] you'll find in this that it's not just
[1:02:15] to make you live, but it's to bring life
[1:02:18] to others as well. Okay? This life is
[1:02:21] not just for you because otherwise
[1:02:23] that's hybrid. Amen. But if there's life
[1:02:26] in you, Jesus said, except a corn we die
[1:02:28] and fall into the ground, it cannot rise
[1:02:30] again and multiply. It's the same thing
[1:02:32] for a believer. You are supposed to have
[1:02:34] life that produces life. I was listening
[1:02:36] to the message, be not afraid. Brother
[1:02:38] Brandham was he was at a breakfast that
[1:02:40] Billy Graham was was talking at. Billy
[1:02:42] Graham said, "I I have this issue." He
[1:02:44] says, "I go to a city and I get 10,000
[1:02:46] converts and I come back a year later
[1:02:48] and I've got
[1:02:49] 30." He said, "The Apostle Paul would go
[1:02:52] into a city and he would convert one and
[1:02:54] he'd come back a year later and he'd
[1:02:56] have 30." And brother says, "I wish I
[1:02:59] could have told him." He says, "The
[1:03:00] difference is that you took him to a
[1:03:02] confession of faith." He said, "The
[1:03:03] Apostle Paul stayed with him until he
[1:03:05] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:08] Because what happens, you come out and
[1:03:09] listen, plenty of people got Yes, they
[1:03:11] they they've done well under Billy
[1:03:13] Graeme. I'm not not saying he didn't
[1:03:14] have a a purpose, but he did. Amen. And
[1:03:17] he was a man of God. I believe that.
[1:03:18] What a wonderful man. What a wonderful
[1:03:20] message. A man that could preach
[1:03:21] salvation. I don't think there was a
[1:03:23] better preacher that could preach
[1:03:24] salvation than Billy Graham. But what is
[1:03:27] it? People will come out of there on
[1:03:29] fire for
[1:03:31] God. The Apostle Paul would fill them
[1:03:33] with the fire of God. There's a
[1:03:35] difference, church, because you can go
[1:03:37] on fire for God, but you need that fire
[1:03:39] within you. Amen. It's people that will
[1:03:41] act on the word, not just say amen to
[1:03:44] the word. People that are caught up,
[1:03:46] there's a fire burning. There's a life
[1:03:47] inside of them that's coming out now,
[1:03:49] rather than something that was fanned by
[1:03:51] the feeling of the of the services.
[1:03:53] That's the difference between these two
[1:03:54] things. Born again children of God will
[1:03:58] produce other born again children of
[1:03:59] God. Now, listen, we believe that those
[1:04:01] are our own children. Amen. I'm not
[1:04:04] believing that my children are not the
[1:04:06] seed of God. But it means there's others
[1:04:08] as well. That as we go, life will
[1:04:10] produce life. So as we walk through this
[1:04:12] world, as we meet people at school, we
[1:04:14] meet people at work, we meet people in
[1:04:16] the grocery store, whatever it might be,
[1:04:18] there's something about us that brings
[1:04:20] them to life. And they say there's
[1:04:22] something about you. They may not say
[1:04:23] it, but they think it and they act on.
[1:04:24] There's something different about you.
[1:04:26] And so they come to church and they hear
[1:04:28] the word and they get the same
[1:04:29] experience you do. That's what Peter did
[1:04:32] on the day of Pentecost. He took his
[1:04:33] experience and he preached it and what
[1:04:35] did it produce? 3,000 souls. Then he
[1:04:37] goes down to the house of Cornelius and
[1:04:39] he preaches the same thing and they what
[1:04:41] do they do? They've received the same
[1:04:42] word and they get the same results. Life
[1:04:45] produces life. That's what he was going
[1:04:48] around doing. Verse 12. Therefore,
[1:04:50] brethren, we are debtors not to the
[1:04:52] flesh to live after the flesh. Church,
[1:04:53] you don't owe your body anything. This
[1:04:56] flesh is not we are not debtors to it.
[1:04:59] It isn't so great or so good to us that
[1:05:02] we have to do what it says. We owe it
[1:05:05] nothing. He says, "For if you live after
[1:05:07] the flesh, you shall die. But if ye
[1:05:09] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[1:05:11] of the body, you shall live." Now,
[1:05:13] notice as the spirit quickens the soul,
[1:05:16] it starts to kill the
[1:05:18] flesh. That's what's happening. see is
[1:05:21] there's a preeminent shift that's
[1:05:22] happening in your body because with the
[1:05:24] soul being now bound by being sealed by
[1:05:27] the power of the Holy Spirit, the soul
[1:05:29] condition starts to take preeminence
[1:05:31] because now God's inside of it. It comes
[1:05:33] to life and what does it start to do? It
[1:05:35] starts to push out death because
[1:05:37] everything in the flesh is death. Amen.
[1:05:39] The soul, what's in the soul is gaining
[1:05:41] preeminence over the body. One has come
[1:05:42] to life and the other one is slowly
[1:05:44] dying away. That's the new birth. He
[1:05:46] says, "For as many as are led by the
[1:05:48] spirit of God, they are the sons of
[1:05:50] God." That's the identification of the
[1:05:52] effect of receiving the word of God is
[1:05:54] that the spirit of God can now lead you.
[1:05:56] Your life is surrendered to him. Now,
[1:05:58] here's where we want to focus today. He
[1:05:59] says, "For we have not we have not
[1:06:02] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:06:04] fear, but we have received the spirit of
[1:06:07] adoption whereby we cry, "Aba, Father."
[1:06:10] He says, "The spirit itself beareth
[1:06:12] witness. It testifies. It confirms to us
[1:06:15] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:06:18] of God. And if we are children, he's
[1:06:21] just building us up now. He's saying, if
[1:06:22] you've got this, then this. And if it's
[1:06:24] this, then this. And he's showing us our
[1:06:26] whole position. He says, "And if we're
[1:06:28] children, we're hes of God, joint hes
[1:06:31] with Christ. If so be that we suffer
[1:06:33] with him, that we may also be glorified
[1:06:35] together." And I want to focus on these
[1:06:37] three verses for the rest of this
[1:06:39] service because Paul gives us this
[1:06:40] beautiful little package here. And he
[1:06:43] presents to us the true benefits, the
[1:06:45] true scope of what it means to be a
[1:06:46] child of God. And in verse 15, he says,
[1:06:48] "For you have not received the spirit of
[1:06:51] bondage again to fear. But you have
[1:06:53] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:06:55] we cry aba father." So we see two
[1:06:58] spirits with two effects. One spirit of
[1:07:01] bondage causes you to fear. One spirit
[1:07:03] of adoption causes us to cry out to God.
[1:07:07] Okay? Now when we look at this, we see
[1:07:11] that spirit of bondage. It was the
[1:07:12] spirit of death and spin and sin. It was
[1:07:15] the fearful looking over our shoulder
[1:07:17] whenever we did something wrong that God
[1:07:19] would come down and he would judge us.
[1:07:21] He'd make us sick. He'd take away our
[1:07:22] money, take away our family, take away
[1:07:24] our health. And we were always worried
[1:07:26] about those things. Amen. Because we
[1:07:27] didn't do we did something we shouldn't
[1:07:29] do. But Paul says, "No, God comes down
[1:07:31] and he gives you a spirit of adoption
[1:07:33] that takes away that fear."
[1:07:36] Amen. And it brings you into a new
[1:07:38] place. church, we still have
[1:07:41] convictions. We still are convicted
[1:07:43] about our actions or our lack of actions
[1:07:46] as the case may be. And when God
[1:07:48] convicts us, he's not doing it to judge
[1:07:50] us. He's doing it to protect us or to
[1:07:53] bring us into his blessings. He's not
[1:07:56] trying to judge us. He's trying to take
[1:07:57] us into what he has for us. He's not
[1:08:00] there to judge. He's there to protect,
[1:08:02] to preserve, to bring us into the
[1:08:04] blessings that he have. But we still
[1:08:06] reap what we sow in this natural life.
[1:08:08] That doesn't go away. Amen. The
[1:08:10] conviction of God is to keep you from
[1:08:12] going down a road that you ought not to
[1:08:14] go down or to get you onto the road that
[1:08:16] you ought to be going down. See, in
[1:08:18] Moses day, the law was there to condemn,
[1:08:20] to condemn. But here, the word is here
[1:08:22] to convince and convict. It's trying to
[1:08:26] get us to do the right thing. And that
[1:08:27] conscience that we have is pricricked by
[1:08:29] the spirit. And it causes us to stop and
[1:08:32] say, "Uhoh, what happened? Something's
[1:08:34] wrong here. This is bothering me. Why is
[1:08:36] it bothering me?" And we can step back
[1:08:38] and say, "Okay, Lord, what's going on?"
[1:08:40] And he'll show us what's happening in
[1:08:42] our life. But we see that as a believer
[1:08:44] really the reaping and sewing once we've
[1:08:46] given our life to Christ is it's it's
[1:08:48] really for here in the natural life. You
[1:08:50] reap what you sow here. But our soul is
[1:08:52] sealed to the day of our redemption.
[1:08:55] Whatever you do after you receive the
[1:08:56] Holy Spirit will not change your eternal
[1:08:58] condition or your eternal destination.
[1:09:01] But you can change what you bring to
[1:09:03] him. Then remember, we're going to come
[1:09:05] and we're going to lay our crowns at his
[1:09:07] feet. What we do here is going to be
[1:09:09] tried by fire. And you can have
[1:09:11] something that lasts through the fire of
[1:09:12] God or you can have something that's
[1:09:13] destroyed by it. That's your own choice
[1:09:15] of reaping and sowing. That's the only
[1:09:17] real choice that a believer has is what
[1:09:19] they do after
[1:09:21] that. And you can choose to serve God
[1:09:23] for 30% in you know uh 30fold. You can
[1:09:28] choose God to serve God to produce
[1:09:29] 60fold or 100fold. That's what we bring.
[1:09:32] Amen. But if we live by the word, we get
[1:09:36] word
[1:09:37] results. But when we live by the word,
[1:09:39] you'll find that there's all sorts of
[1:09:40] surface friction because you're dealing
[1:09:42] with the world. You're dealing with the
[1:09:44] flesh. But if you live contrary to the
[1:09:47] word, what you find is that you get
[1:09:48] along good with a lot of people, but
[1:09:50] there's a deeper issue that's
[1:09:51] unresolved. And that's what comes out
[1:09:53] down the road. So living by the word is
[1:09:56] highly uncomfortable in this world
[1:09:58] because you're constantly at friction
[1:09:59] with this flesh. You're constantly in
[1:10:01] contradiction to the things of the
[1:10:02] world. And so, it's a life of constant
[1:10:05] struggle, but it's planting the right
[1:10:08] seeds and it produces the right crop.
[1:10:10] Amen. Now, we preached he says that we
[1:10:14] don't have this spirit of bondage, but
[1:10:15] we have the spirit of adoption. And I
[1:10:17] hope we all know what adoption is by now
[1:10:19] because I preached almost a full year on
[1:10:20] it. So, I'm not going to preach on it
[1:10:22] this morning except to remind us that
[1:10:24] adoption in the scriptures was not about
[1:10:26] taking a child that didn't belong to the
[1:10:28] family and bringing it into the family.
[1:10:30] That's not what adoption is. Adoption is
[1:10:32] taking a child that is a part of the
[1:10:33] family and placing them in a position of
[1:10:36] responsibility and authority. So Paul
[1:10:39] says when you receive the spirit of God,
[1:10:41] you receive a spirit that is supposed to
[1:10:43] take you into position and authority.
[1:10:47] That's its purpose. Amen. But this
[1:10:49] adoption was not guaranteed for a child
[1:10:53] because it only happened at a certain
[1:10:55] point because the child was always in
[1:10:59] relationship. The child always had a
[1:11:01] father and if the child was bad, it
[1:11:04] didn't change the fact that he or she
[1:11:05] was the son or daughter of the father.
[1:11:07] So the relationship is always there. But
[1:11:09] adoption now is when the character
[1:11:11] matches what the father
[1:11:13] requires. Amen. So the child had to move
[1:11:16] from this place of just always going and
[1:11:18] asking daddy for stuff and relying on
[1:11:20] him for clothes and for shelter and an
[1:11:22] allowance and whining when things
[1:11:24] weren't perfect to stepping into a place
[1:11:26] where he wanted to know what daddy
[1:11:27] needed him to do. What daddy wanted him
[1:11:30] to do and he wanted to know how to do
[1:11:33] it. And how did that come through? It
[1:11:35] came through a tutor that took the
[1:11:37] father's will and he took it and he
[1:11:39] turned it into lessons for that child on
[1:11:40] a daily basis. And how did that child
[1:11:43] come to adoption? It came to adoption
[1:11:45] when the tutor came to the father and
[1:11:46] said, "He thinks like you do. She acts
[1:11:49] like you do. He reacts like you do. He
[1:11:52] holds back like you
[1:11:54] do. She wants the same things you
[1:11:57] do." And what is it? It was a matching
[1:11:59] of the character of the child with the
[1:12:01] character and expectations of the
[1:12:03] father. And that's when the father would
[1:12:05] have the ceremony. He'd stand him up in
[1:12:07] public. He put a a a robe of authority
[1:12:09] around him and say, "He is now a part of
[1:12:11] our family. He's a part of our family
[1:12:13] business and what he says goes. His name
[1:12:16] on the check is as good as my name on
[1:12:17] the check. That's the purpose of
[1:12:20] adoption. It's to bring us to our
[1:12:22] position in Christ.
[1:12:25] Amen. To where we're working with him
[1:12:28] rather than just having a relationship
[1:12:30] with him. It's to put our shoulders into
[1:12:33] the in into the work itself. Amen. What
[1:12:36] was it that allowed you to move from
[1:12:37] relationship to responsibility and
[1:12:39] authority? It's always character. It's
[1:12:41] always character. That's what the father
[1:12:43] was looking for. Amen. And that's the
[1:12:45] key thing that comes after baptism is
[1:12:47] God's baptism of the spirit, I say, is
[1:12:49] God starts to develop your character to
[1:12:51] match what he's looking for. But before
[1:12:54] you ever have that, remember what Paul
[1:12:56] says. Paul's walking us through Paul's
[1:12:58] not taking us to adoption here. He's
[1:13:00] saying it's a spirit that will bring you
[1:13:01] to adoption. But before it brings you to
[1:13:04] adoption, what does it do first? The
[1:13:07] spirit of Christ, the Holy Spirit, what
[1:13:08] does it do? It tells you who your father
[1:13:10] is. It tells you who your daddy is. It
[1:13:13] tells you where you come from, which
[1:13:15] tells you where you're going. And it
[1:13:17] changes your outlook on life. Amen. It
[1:13:20] changes who your relationships are
[1:13:22] with. It tells you where to look for
[1:13:26] your support. It tells you what to
[1:13:28] value. It tells you what belongs to you.
[1:13:31] It completely changes your mindset.
[1:13:33] Amen. It tells you who your real father
[1:13:36] is. Now, listen. We've got many fathers
[1:13:38] here, but my son's only answer to me.
[1:13:42] And as similar as we are as believers,
[1:13:44] brother Chad's son is being told
[1:13:46] different things than my son. And
[1:13:48] brother Joe's sons answer to him
[1:13:49] differently than mine. And brother
[1:13:50] Paul's in these different ones. We all
[1:13:52] are different fathers. And our sons
[1:13:54] can't go to brother Chad to learn how
[1:13:56] they need to please their own father.
[1:13:58] They've got to come to their own father.
[1:14:00] And that's what the spirit does is it
[1:14:01] brings us back to our father.
[1:14:04] Amen. Tells you what to fight for.
[1:14:07] tells you where to focus, tells you
[1:14:09] where to put your energy. Now, watch
[1:14:11] what Paul would say. Now, he's tying
[1:14:13] this in in Galatians 4. He says, "Now I
[1:14:15] say that the heir, as long as he is a
[1:14:17] child, differs nothing from a servant,
[1:14:19] though he be lord of all." He says, "As
[1:14:21] long as you're only in relationship and
[1:14:23] don't have character, you're the same as
[1:14:25] a servant." He says, "But he's under
[1:14:27] tutors and governors until the time
[1:14:29] appointed of the father." Church, we
[1:14:31] don't need to worry about it. God has a
[1:14:34] time. God has a season. He'll lose none
[1:14:36] of his. He'll bring us where we need to
[1:14:38] get. He says, "Even so, when we were
[1:14:40] children, we're in bondage under the
[1:14:42] elements of the world." All of us, no
[1:14:44] matter where we're born, whether we're
[1:14:46] born in a Christian home, born into this
[1:14:47] message, whatever it might be, we're
[1:14:49] still born this. We're born in bondage
[1:14:51] to a different
[1:14:53] spirit. He says, "But when the fullness
[1:14:55] of the time was come, God sent forth his
[1:14:57] son made of a woman, made under the law,
[1:14:59] to redeem them that were under the law,
[1:15:02] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:15:04] sons." The law could not bring you into
[1:15:07] adoption. It took something beyond that.
[1:15:10] Amen. To redeem that were under the law,
[1:15:12] that were under the spirit of fear
[1:15:13] because of the law of sin and death. He
[1:15:15] says that we replace that law now that
[1:15:17] we might receive the adoption of sons.
[1:15:20] How do you become a son? How do you
[1:15:21] become adopted, church? You receive the
[1:15:25] spirit of adoption. That's the way that
[1:15:27] it works. He says, "And because ye are
[1:15:30] sons, before we did right or wrong,
[1:15:32] before we came to church, before we were
[1:15:34] baptized, before we said amen to the
[1:15:36] word, before we were we we gave our
[1:15:39] lives to him, he says, because you are
[1:15:40] sons, God sent forth the spirit of his
[1:15:43] son into your hearts, crying, abba,
[1:15:46] father, and says, wherefore thou art no
[1:15:48] more a servant, but a son, and if a son,
[1:15:50] than an heir of God through Christ."
[1:15:53] Notice he keeps saying this this phrase,
[1:15:55] crying aba father. And that word crying
[1:15:58] is one of the strangest words in the
[1:15:59] Bible because it's a word that in the
[1:16:02] Greek it literally sounds like a raven
[1:16:05] crying. And they did that
[1:16:08] specifically because what he's talking
[1:16:10] about is when this moment happens what
[1:16:13] you say cannot be put into words. It's
[1:16:16] hard to express because what you've
[1:16:19] realized, maybe look at it my way. When
[1:16:21] I came to that place in in that camp in
[1:16:23] Louisiana where I gave my heart to the
[1:16:25] Lord, where he called my name, when he
[1:16:27] called my name, I realized that I had a
[1:16:29] father whose name was not Lanni Kurlet.
[1:16:32] And when I came forward and gave my
[1:16:34] heart to him, I could not form words. I
[1:16:37] know exactly what this means. The the
[1:16:39] word here cry means inarticulate shouts
[1:16:42] that express deep emotion. And I
[1:16:45] couldn't even frame what I was feeling.
[1:16:47] I was just making unintelligible sounds.
[1:16:49] I was raising my hands. I was praising
[1:16:51] the Lord. Why? Because my eyes had been
[1:16:53] lifted from here to here. And I'd
[1:16:55] realized there was more to me than I had
[1:16:57] thought. I realized that I had an
[1:16:59] inheritance beyond what my father could
[1:17:01] save up until he died. I realized there
[1:17:03] was more to me than the faults and
[1:17:06] failures that come through the DNA of my
[1:17:08] mother and father. But I realized that I
[1:17:09] had a heavenly father with a heavenly
[1:17:12] inheritance with a heavenly DNA that was
[1:17:15] calling me to cry out to him and say,
[1:17:17] "Daddy, daddy."
[1:17:20] That's what I'm talking about. It's joy
[1:17:22] unspeakable and full of glory. When you
[1:17:25] realize, "I am not of this world. I did
[1:17:28] not start here. I will not finish here."
[1:17:31] But there's something from the eternal
[1:17:33] that is drawing me back to him.
[1:17:36] That's what we're talking about this
[1:17:38] morning. This is the seed principle that
[1:17:41] we're going to get into. Amen.
[1:17:43] Hallelujah. What? I was in complete and
[1:17:46] total rapture in that moment. I was a
[1:17:49] new man. I was a new
[1:17:51] creature. Everything cleaned. Everything
[1:17:54] changed in a moment. And what did I do?
[1:17:57] I raised my hand. I said, "Daddy, I'm
[1:18:00] coming home." And from that moment,
[1:18:02] church, everything changes. That's what
[1:18:04] the new birth is. It is a complete and
[1:18:06] total change that takes your eyes off of
[1:18:08] this flesh and it sets it on the eternal
[1:18:11] word. That is what it does to you. Amen.
[1:18:14] What is it? Our life turns to
[1:18:16] God. Our mind and our soul turns back to
[1:18:19] the word. Why? Because we've been born
[1:18:22] from above. Not born in sin and shaped
[1:18:25] in iniquity. Amen. We're not just living
[1:18:27] a pointless life here where we we are
[1:18:29] born and we we have some fun and then we
[1:18:32] go to work and then we retire and then
[1:18:34] we die. What a horrible life. But I
[1:18:36] realized there's way more to this than
[1:18:37] anything that I had ever thought. It's
[1:18:39] like somebody had opened up the doors to
[1:18:41] a kingdom and everything in there is
[1:18:43] wonderful. And it says, "Here you go.
[1:18:44] This belongs to you." That's what I
[1:18:47] That's what I That's what happened in
[1:18:49] that moment was I realized I'm a child
[1:18:51] of God. I'm a child of God. And that's
[1:18:54] the thing that matters most. That's the
[1:18:56] thing that matters most. Amen. But Bram
[1:18:59] says it this way. says we have become
[1:19:01] from mortal beings from time beings to
[1:19:04] eternal beings. When the word of God lit
[1:19:06] our souls and we become sons and
[1:19:08] daughters of God with the attributes the
[1:19:11] gene of God in us to be sons and
[1:19:13] daughters of the father. He says God in
[1:19:16] heaven crying aba father my god my god
[1:19:18] in my father's house. Today we'd say I
[1:19:21] won the
[1:19:22] lottery. That's the way it is when
[1:19:24] people win the lottery. They don't know
[1:19:26] what to do. They don't know what to say.
[1:19:28] All they know is I'm a multi
[1:19:29] multi-millionaire.
[1:19:31] And most of them just sit down and
[1:19:33] cry because they can't do anything else.
[1:19:35] They're so overcome by it. Amen. But
[1:19:37] this isn't a lottery that buys us homes
[1:19:39] and cars that rust and rot. This is one
[1:19:43] that has a home that's eternal in the
[1:19:44] heavens, a kingdom that will not pass
[1:19:47] away. First Pet in first Peter it says,
[1:19:49] "Blessed be the God and father of our
[1:19:51] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[1:19:53] his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[1:19:57] again."
[1:19:59] See, life is of God, no matter what,
[1:20:01] church. The first time I was born was
[1:20:03] his mercy. But when I was born by the
[1:20:05] spirit, that was his abundant
[1:20:07] mercy. Born again into a living hope, a
[1:20:11] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[1:20:16] incorruptible and undefiled. And that
[1:20:19] fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for
[1:20:21] you. Notice it says it's incorruptible.
[1:20:25] It's undefiled. It doesn't fade away.
[1:20:27] Each of us has this inheritance waiting
[1:20:29] for us. Peter's creating a contrast with
[1:20:32] what we have with what we have up there.
[1:20:35] Okay. What is it? Let's keep reading. He
[1:20:38] says, "Who are
[1:20:39] kept?" We're kept by the power of God
[1:20:43] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[1:20:46] revealed in the last time. Peter said,
[1:20:48] "You're kept by the power of God."
[1:20:49] What's the power of God, church? It's
[1:20:51] the spirit of God inside of you. We are
[1:20:53] kept by the power of God. were kept by
[1:20:54] the spirit of God by faith that is
[1:20:57] pointing to a salvation that is going to
[1:21:00] be revealed at the last time. Now that
[1:21:03] word salvation means a healing, a
[1:21:05] deliverance, total health, total
[1:21:08] preservation, complete
[1:21:11] safety. That's
[1:21:14] salvation, church. When is he said it's
[1:21:16] at the last time. When is the last time?
[1:21:19] Today. Today is the last time. It's the
[1:21:22] last age. It's the It's the last period
[1:21:24] of the Gentile dispensation. What's the
[1:21:26] salvation that's coming at this time?
[1:21:28] What is the only thing that we have that
[1:21:30] they don't have, church? A resurrection
[1:21:32] and a rapture. We have a body change.
[1:21:36] Everything that the first church age
[1:21:37] had, we have available to us today. But
[1:21:40] there's one thing we have that they
[1:21:41] don't, and that's that we get a body
[1:21:43] change while we yet live. We get to see
[1:21:46] the fullness of salvation. We get to see
[1:21:48] the fullness of adoption. We see the
[1:21:50] fullness of redemption. Amen. If we go
[1:21:52] back go back to Romans 8 and and
[1:21:55] continuing on from there, he says, "For
[1:21:57] I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:21:58] present world are not worthy to be
[1:22:00] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:22:02] revealed in us. For the earnest
[1:22:05] expectation of the creature waits for
[1:22:07] the manifestation of the sons of God.
[1:22:09] He's speaking of the creature, the
[1:22:11] creation." He says, "For the creature
[1:22:13] was made subject to vanity, not
[1:22:15] willingly, but by reason of him who has
[1:22:17] subjected the same in hope." He says,
[1:22:19] "Because the creature, because creation
[1:22:22] itself shall be delivered from the
[1:22:24] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[1:22:28] liberty of the children of God." When?
[1:22:30] At the last time. At the end time. At
[1:22:33] the end of it all. See, in this
[1:22:35] scripture, we will have already been
[1:22:36] changed into our glorious liberty. But
[1:22:39] there's a glorious liberty that's coming
[1:22:40] for the earth. And what is it? A new
[1:22:42] heaven and a new earth. It gets a new
[1:22:44] body. We get a new body. It gets a new
[1:22:46] body.
[1:22:48] That's what's going to happen. He says,
[1:22:50] "For we know that the whole creation
[1:22:52] groanth and travaleth in pain together
[1:22:54] until now. And not only they, but
[1:22:56] ourselves also which have the first
[1:22:58] fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves
[1:23:01] grown within ourselves, waiting for the
[1:23:03] adoption to the redemption of our body."
[1:23:08] So what's the salvation waiting to be
[1:23:10] revealed? It's a body change. It's a
[1:23:13] total healing. It's a total deliverance.
[1:23:15] It's giving us the glorious body like
[1:23:17] unto his glorious body as the scripture
[1:23:18] says. It's a transformation of what? Not
[1:23:21] just having a soul that's filled with
[1:23:23] the spirit, but an entire being that is
[1:23:25] filled with the spirit. It is a perfect,
[1:23:27] glorified, holy, righteous, undefiled,
[1:23:30] incorruptible, eternal body. That's what
[1:23:33] we're coming into. Amen. What's our cry
[1:23:37] then? Father, Father, give us that body.
[1:23:41] Take us all the way through. Get us out
[1:23:44] of here. Finish the
[1:23:46] job. Help us submit to your process so
[1:23:49] we can get the results. That's the cry
[1:23:52] of our hearts. Amen. God, do what you
[1:23:54] said you'd do. Let your word be born in
[1:23:57] my life. Let the promises of the word be
[1:24:00] revealed in me, not just in somebody
[1:24:01] else. That's the cry of our hearts. Why?
[1:24:04] Because we know there's more than what
[1:24:05] we have. Church, do we know there's more
[1:24:07] than what we have. Then what does our
[1:24:09] hearts cry? Give us what we don't have.
[1:24:11] Thank you for what we have. But don't
[1:24:13] stop there until you give us everything
[1:24:14] you promised. Let the word be born in
[1:24:17] the manger of my heart as we
[1:24:20] sing. Why? We're looking to move from
[1:24:23] this into that. I don't want to stop
[1:24:26] with what I have now, church. I'm
[1:24:27] thankful for it. But Paul says we put we
[1:24:30] leave it behind and we keep pressing.
[1:24:32] Never stop pressing. That's the cry of
[1:24:34] the believer. Give me more of you and
[1:24:37] take away more of
[1:24:38] me. He says this. Oh, do you see it? All
[1:24:41] creation's groaning, he said Paul.
[1:24:43] Everything's groaning. Look at the
[1:24:44] trees, how they struggle. Look at the
[1:24:46] flowers, how they struggle for life just
[1:24:48] for the frost to tear them down. Look at
[1:24:51] the trees, how they struggle to hold
[1:24:52] their branches out to sing glories unto
[1:24:54] God. See everything, all nature, all
[1:24:56] animals, all birds, how he flies from
[1:24:58] the enemy quickly and gets away.
[1:24:59] Everything's groaning. And we ourselves,
[1:25:01] said Paul, we groan too with them. For
[1:25:04] we are waiting for the redemption of our
[1:25:06] body. But he says, "But now, now they
[1:25:10] did the all those years until now. Now
[1:25:12] we have the earnest of our inheritance."
[1:25:15] Oh my. What do we have? We have the
[1:25:17] evidence that God lives. We have the
[1:25:19] evidence that God is with us. We have
[1:25:22] the evidence that God has not forsaken
[1:25:25] us. That we are his and he is ours.
[1:25:27] Because we in our bodies, we now
[1:25:29] tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that
[1:25:31] cries out, "Aba, Father." He says, "And
[1:25:34] there's nothing can ever take that
[1:25:36] away." Remember, we're saying there's no
[1:25:38] room for fear this morning. Nothing can
[1:25:40] ever take that away. We're anchored in
[1:25:42] Christ. He says, "Now, the trees do not
[1:25:44] have it. Nature does not have it, but
[1:25:46] yet we are still groaning with them
[1:25:47] because as yet we haven't received the
[1:25:50] fullness of our adoption, but we have
[1:25:52] the earnest of it. We have the down
[1:25:54] payment. We have the guarantee of it.
[1:25:56] That we were picked up." Here's our
[1:25:58] guarantee, church. Here's our proof.
[1:26:00] That we were picked up from the things
[1:26:02] of the world and now become sons and
[1:26:04] daughters of God. We've had a
[1:26:07] life-changing, desire-changing
[1:26:09] experience with Christ. He says, "What
[1:26:11] kind of people should we be?" Oh my.
[1:26:13] When we think of that, think of it. Now,
[1:26:15] we have the earnest. Our spirit's
[1:26:17] groaning for the full adoption. But now
[1:26:19] we have the earnest of it. And as we
[1:26:21] receive the Holy Spirit, it's the
[1:26:22] earnest for our complete adoption or our
[1:26:25] complete salvation. He says, "Oh, how
[1:26:28] beautiful. I just love that." Isn't that
[1:26:30] our cry? God, finish the work that you
[1:26:34] started. Don't let us go without
[1:26:36] everything. Don't let us fall
[1:26:39] short. Lord, give us faith. Give us
[1:26:43] opportunity and help us to take the
[1:26:45] opportunity to take you at your word.
[1:26:47] That's the cry of our hearts. Amen.
[1:26:48] Church, I don't know about you, I'm
[1:26:50] ready to get out. I'm ready to move past
[1:26:52] lumpy eyes and balding hair and bad
[1:26:55] attitudes and waiting and wondering. I'm
[1:26:58] ready to move into perfect faith.
[1:27:01] Amen. But you'll realize we're in the
[1:27:03] we're in the time of moving on. We're in
[1:27:05] the time of rapture. But because we're
[1:27:06] in the time of perfect faith, there's
[1:27:08] got to be a gap between those two where
[1:27:10] our faith can become sight. And there's
[1:27:12] always a timeline between those things.
[1:27:14] Go. What's God's waiting for us to do,
[1:27:16] church? Cry out. Cry out. Not just sit
[1:27:20] around and
[1:27:21] wait. Listen, there is a patience in the
[1:27:24] believer, but there is a crying out as
[1:27:26] well. And you'll see it all through
[1:27:28] scripture. The people of God get down on
[1:27:31] their knees and they cry out to God to
[1:27:33] produce his word in their lives. It's
[1:27:36] not just a heart's cry. It's a spoken
[1:27:38] cry. It's a prayerful cry.
[1:27:41] Amen. He's waiting on us to show we
[1:27:43] believe, to act in faith, speak in
[1:27:46] faith, and then wait in faith for him to
[1:27:49] do exactly what he promised to do. I
[1:27:51] said earlier, we reap what we sow. And
[1:27:53] for the believer, it's more of an
[1:27:55] earthly thing. Once our soul's been
[1:27:56] sealed. Amen. Once your soul's sealed,
[1:27:58] you're sealed to eternity. You can't
[1:27:59] change it. You can't unbecome a child of
[1:28:01] God. You can't do it. Amen. It's
[1:28:04] impossible to do it. But I will say
[1:28:06] this, your dayto-day actions can reflect
[1:28:08] on where your eternal destination is.
[1:28:11] Cuz if all we're doing is living
[1:28:13] according to the things of the world,
[1:28:14] there's a problem in the soul. So you
[1:28:17] can't say, "I'm sealed by the spirit of
[1:28:18] God and live according to the world."
[1:28:20] There's a contradiction there. The
[1:28:23] scripture says you can't love the world
[1:28:24] or the things of the world. You can't
[1:28:26] serve two masters. You can't be in the
[1:28:29] word and in the world simultaneously. It
[1:28:31] doesn't work. Scripture says we're in
[1:28:32] the world, but we're not of it. We're
[1:28:34] not a part of it. It's not active in our
[1:28:36] life. Amen. So, if we're if our life is
[1:28:38] full of disobedience to the word because
[1:28:40] we're so busy in the world, I'm sorry,
[1:28:42] we're not born again. I'm not saying
[1:28:45] you're not a child of God. I'm saying
[1:28:46] you're not born again yet. Amen. We're
[1:28:50] here to be victorious. We're here to
[1:28:51] overcome. And if we're not overcoming,
[1:28:53] there's a problem somewhere.
[1:28:55] Absolutely. The very requirement for
[1:28:57] this age is to be an overcomer. Amen.
[1:29:00] And that's to produce the word of God.
[1:29:02] And if we're not overcoming, it behooves
[1:29:03] us to get down on our knees and ask God
[1:29:05] what's going on. Is it I, Lord, or is
[1:29:09] this just a trial of faith? But we ought
[1:29:11] to be down on our knees making sure that
[1:29:13] everything's okay. We have to get
[1:29:15] serious with
[1:29:16] God. And usually what happens is we get
[1:29:18] sick and tired of being sick and tired
[1:29:21] of getting beat up, being in and out, up
[1:29:23] and down, inside, outside, upside
[1:29:26] down in the spinning washer of this
[1:29:29] life. You get sick of that. And usually
[1:29:32] what comes out of that is a new birth
[1:29:34] where you finally lay it all down and
[1:29:35] you say, "Lord, I can't do it. I can't
[1:29:38] do it and I'm sick and tired of trying
[1:29:40] to do it. Will you come in and take over
[1:29:42] for me?" That's when the new birth will
[1:29:44] happen because you surrender yourself,
[1:29:46] your life, your will, your ideas, your
[1:29:48] skills, whatever it might be. And you
[1:29:49] say, "Lord, you take it." That's what
[1:29:51] takes a new birth. And what does it do,
[1:29:52] church? It brings you into rest. It
[1:29:54] brings you into assurance. It brings you
[1:29:55] into confidence. Brings you into peace.
[1:29:58] Brings you into joy. Why? Not because
[1:30:00] you don't have battles. We're going to
[1:30:01] have battles. God's going to do a work.
[1:30:03] He's got to change us from the inside
[1:30:05] out, but that's it. It'll start on the
[1:30:07] inside and finish on the outside cuz
[1:30:09] it's planted on the inside, and it'll
[1:30:11] produce life on the outside. All right.
[1:30:12] Amen. That's the only time you'll be
[1:30:14] able to hold your ground is when you
[1:30:15] surrender to him. Listen, we see people
[1:30:18] all the
[1:30:19] time, 10step programs, 12step programs,
[1:30:22] three-step programs to change your life,
[1:30:24] change your career, change your
[1:30:26] relationship, change this. And what do
[1:30:27] we do? We make ground. But because
[1:30:29] nothing changed inside, we just go back.
[1:30:33] And usually the end result is worse than
[1:30:34] the first because we know we tried and
[1:30:36] failed. And that that just it kills us
[1:30:38] when we do that. It makes it even
[1:30:40] harder. Amen. we're just doing it
[1:30:42] ourselves and we're bound to fall. But
[1:30:43] when we cry out and God comes on the
[1:30:46] scene, when we answer that beckoning
[1:30:48] call of the Holy Spirit, that's what
[1:30:49] changes everything because now we're
[1:30:51] inviting him into the situation. Amen.
[1:30:54] And though the circumstances of life may
[1:30:56] seem hard, the word of God can't be
[1:30:58] denied. The word of God is where the
[1:31:00] power is. And so temporarily it looks
[1:31:02] like there's a fight. There is a battle.
[1:31:03] And there is. But in the end, the word
[1:31:05] is going to overcome because it can't
[1:31:06] return to God void. The scripture says
[1:31:08] it's going to do what he said it was
[1:31:09] going to do.
[1:31:11] From that moment, from that moment when
[1:31:13] he drops that Holy Spirit into your
[1:31:14] life, everything changes. That's where
[1:31:16] your rest is. That's where that trust
[1:31:18] is. That's that assurance, that
[1:31:20] calmness, that quietness, that peace,
[1:31:22] even in the storm. Even in the storm.
[1:31:25] But Satan's trying to get our eyes off
[1:31:27] of that onto everything that's happening
[1:31:29] to try and disrupt those things that are
[1:31:31] in our soul. Amen. But I'll tell you
[1:31:33] this, victory starts to appear. You get
[1:31:34] the Holy Ghost, victory starts to
[1:31:35] appear. It has to because it's the
[1:31:38] spirit of victory. It's the spirit of
[1:31:40] overcoming. It's the conquering spirit.
[1:31:42] It's the living spirit. It's got to
[1:31:44] produce that which it is. Amen. Paul
[1:31:46] would say this in Romans 8. He says,
[1:31:48] "The spirit itself bears witness. It
[1:31:50] testifies. It confirms with our spirit
[1:31:52] that we are the children of God." That's
[1:31:55] the point of this whole this whole
[1:31:56] scripture. This whole uh service this
[1:31:58] morning is Paul's saying when you
[1:31:59] relieve the when you receive the Holy
[1:32:01] Spirit, you are set free from fears of
[1:32:04] what you do or don't do. Why? Because
[1:32:06] it's a finished work. It's a sealing. A
[1:32:08] ceiling is a finished work. See, and
[1:32:10] though you're a creature of time, the
[1:32:12] work in God's eyes is already done.
[1:32:14] Amen. And the Holy Spirit's been given
[1:32:16] you to witness to you that you are one
[1:32:18] thing and one thing alone, church.
[1:32:20] You're a child of God. Not a child of
[1:32:22] mommy and daddy. Not a child of this
[1:32:24] world. Not a child of whim. Not a child
[1:32:26] of sexual desire. You are a child of the
[1:32:28] very thoughts and attributes of God.
[1:32:31] That's what it's going to remind you. If
[1:32:32] you're in a battle this morning, I'll
[1:32:34] tell you, you're under two spirits.
[1:32:35] You're under a spirit of fear or the
[1:32:36] spirit of God. And I'll tell you how you
[1:32:38] know the spirit of God will point you to
[1:32:39] this. You are a child of God. He'll
[1:32:42] point you to the word. He'll point you
[1:32:44] to re repentance. He'll point you to
[1:32:46] rest. He'll point you to peace. He'll
[1:32:48] point you to the promise. What does the
[1:32:50] spirit of fear do? Point you to your
[1:32:52] performance and your
[1:32:53] failures. That's it. That's
[1:32:57] it. Spirit of Christ will point you back
[1:33:00] to the word of God and your position in
[1:33:02] Christ. Amen.
[1:33:04] Spirit of fear will condemn you without
[1:33:06] any opportunity for
[1:33:08] restitution. I can't do it. I can't come
[1:33:11] back. Daddy won't let me in the house.
[1:33:14] No, no, no. It'll point you back. He's
[1:33:16] waiting. And all you have to do is go
[1:33:18] back where you left him and he'll be
[1:33:20] right there waiting for
[1:33:21] you. We read this last service. I want
[1:33:24] to read it again. He says, "When the
[1:33:25] worshipper puts his hands on the h head
[1:33:28] of the dying lamb of Calvary and
[1:33:30] confesses his sin and God recognizes
[1:33:32] that to be truthful from his heart, he
[1:33:34] confesses his sin. That circling life
[1:33:36] called the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ
[1:33:38] turns back into the worshipper and he is
[1:33:44] purged, completely
[1:33:47] cleaned. Clean every wit," Jesus said.
[1:33:50] He says, "And has no more desire for
[1:33:52] sin, but he is for he is led by the
[1:33:54] spirit of God, and it's not his own life
[1:33:57] from then on." Catch this. He'll make
[1:34:00] mistakes
[1:34:02] certainly, but that life will hold
[1:34:06] him. Look at Jesus words when he was
[1:34:09] pointing forward to the coming of the
[1:34:10] Holy Spirit. He said, "But the
[1:34:12] comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom
[1:34:14] the Father will send in my name, he
[1:34:16] shall teach you all things and bring all
[1:34:18] things to your remembrance, whatsoever
[1:34:19] I've said unto you." Now, catch what
[1:34:21] it's going to do. That's what he's going
[1:34:23] to tell you. But what's he going to do
[1:34:25] to you? He's going to say, he says,
[1:34:27] "Peace I leave with you. My peace I give
[1:34:30] unto you. Not as the world giveth give I
[1:34:32] unto you. Let not your hearts be
[1:34:34] troubled, neither let it be afraid." The
[1:34:37] identifying characteristic of the Holy
[1:34:39] Spirit is that it takes away fear. Be
[1:34:43] not afraid. It is I. Be not afraid.
[1:34:46] Amen. He casts out fear. He brings that
[1:34:49] peace. He brings that rest. He brings
[1:34:50] that comfort. He brings that assurance.
[1:34:52] He brings that quietness. He brings
[1:34:54] confidence when there's nothing to
[1:34:56] suggest. We should be
[1:34:57] confident. That's the wonderful thing
[1:34:59] about a believer. You can be confident
[1:35:00] without having anything to to rest it on
[1:35:02] except the unfailing word of God. Amen.
[1:35:06] He takes fear completely away and he
[1:35:08] replaces it with faith. Jesus said in
[1:35:10] John 5, he says, "Verily, verily, I say
[1:35:12] unto you, he that heareth my word and
[1:35:15] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:35:17] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:35:20] condemnation, but is passed from death
[1:35:22] unto life." You've changed dimensions.
[1:35:24] You've changed conditions. You've
[1:35:25] changed positions. You've moved from one
[1:35:27] to the other. Paul says, "If you have
[1:35:29] been made alive by the Holy Spirit,
[1:35:32] you'll be raised up just as Christ was."
[1:35:34] That's eternal life. That's Zoey life.
[1:35:36] That's the very life of God. But people
[1:35:38] preach this as if you make a confession
[1:35:40] with your mouth. You then you believe it
[1:35:42] and you've received eternal life. That
[1:35:44] is not what it means to hear and
[1:35:46] believe. Remember I said before that in
[1:35:48] the scriptures they didn't have a word
[1:35:49] for not hear or or disobey or obey
[1:35:52] because here hear means to obey. He that
[1:35:56] obeys my word. We're all sitting here
[1:35:58] hearing it. The whole world could tune
[1:36:00] into this and hear it. But you've got to
[1:36:02] accept it, believe it, and act on it.
[1:36:05] Faith without works is dead. If you
[1:36:08] believe it, you'll act on it. So it's
[1:36:10] those that receive his word and act on
[1:36:12] it. Those are the ones that pass under
[1:36:14] condemnation. Amen. That's the only
[1:36:16] proof that you believe what you say you
[1:36:18] believe is when you act on it. You can't
[1:36:19] just make a confession on the word. You
[1:36:21] have to act on the word of God. You have
[1:36:23] to repent in the and you have to be
[1:36:25] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:36:26] the remission of sins. And you have to
[1:36:28] press forward to the receiving of the
[1:36:29] Holy Spirit. That's what the word
[1:36:31] requires you to do. And then after that,
[1:36:33] you have to press into adoption. And
[1:36:35] then after adoption, you have to press
[1:36:37] into full redemption. The work never
[1:36:39] stops, church, until we're out of here.
[1:36:42] But let me close with this thought this
[1:36:43] morning. We're speaking on uh no room
[1:36:45] for fear. And what is it most of us fear
[1:36:47] the most? I'm talking about humanity.
[1:36:50] Now, what do most people fear the most?
[1:36:53] Death. What happens when it's all said
[1:36:56] and done? What happens when we pass from
[1:36:58] this mortal coil? They they fear not
[1:37:00] going to heaven. They fear going to
[1:37:02] hell. They fear being stuck with their
[1:37:04] life
[1:37:05] decisions. Paul says the Holy Spirit is
[1:37:07] a witness to you that you are a child of
[1:37:12] God. So that means you got to look who
[1:37:15] you are born
[1:37:16] of to settle that
[1:37:18] fear. Are you born of mommy and daddy?
[1:37:22] Not if you're a believer. If you're a
[1:37:24] believer, you're born of
[1:37:25] God. That's your rest. That's your
[1:37:27] certainty. Amen. And when you're born of
[1:37:29] God, church, that puts you into a very
[1:37:32] elite group, a very privileged group.
[1:37:36] And it's not based on the color of your
[1:37:37] skin, not based on your country of
[1:37:39] origin, not based on your
[1:37:41] education. Has nothing to do with it.
[1:37:43] You can't earn it, can't deserve it, but
[1:37:45] you can be born into it. Okay? Listen to
[1:37:49] what God says about those that are born
[1:37:51] of him. He says, "He that committh sin
[1:37:54] is of the devil. For the devil sinnth
[1:37:57] from the beginning. Okay, origin is
[1:38:01] destiny. He says, "For this purpose the
[1:38:04] son of God was manifested that he might
[1:38:06] destroy the works of the devil." Now
[1:38:09] listen to this church. Whosoever is born
[1:38:12] of God, what's the Holy Spirit a witness
[1:38:14] of? That you are a child of God.
[1:38:17] Whosoever is born of God commits
[1:38:22] sin. That's not what it says.
[1:38:26] Whosoever is born of God does not commit
[1:38:31] sin, for his seed remainth in him, and
[1:38:35] he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[1:38:38] We've got three absolute statements
[1:38:39] there that create a perfect picture for
[1:38:41] us. They all stand alone. They all have
[1:38:44] a principle tied to them, but they form
[1:38:46] this beautiful picture. Amen. This is
[1:38:48] the Genesis seed principle right here.
[1:38:51] This is the man reaps what he sws
[1:38:53] principle right here. This is why God
[1:38:55] can't be mocked because he's proven it
[1:38:57] by his word that what you put in is what
[1:38:59] you get out. And he's saying you got to
[1:39:01] remember who you are so you can know
[1:39:03] what's coming out the other end. Okay.
[1:39:05] First thing he says, whosoever is born
[1:39:08] of God does not commit sin. Now remember
[1:39:11] what is sin? Sin is unbelief. We showed
[1:39:14] that in the last few services. Amen. The
[1:39:16] works of sin is smoking, drinking,
[1:39:19] fornicating, cheating, lying, all these
[1:39:21] different things. That's the works of
[1:39:22] sin. That's proof that you don't believe
[1:39:24] the word. But sin itself is unbelief.
[1:39:28] And so Paul is saying here or sorry,
[1:39:30] John is saying here, if you're born of
[1:39:32] God, if you are a child of God, you
[1:39:34] cannot
[1:39:36] disbelieve. You have to believe. The
[1:39:38] very identification of a child of God is
[1:39:41] that you are born to believe. You are
[1:39:44] created to believe. There's something
[1:39:46] inside of you that can only do one
[1:39:49] thing, and that's believe. The word of
[1:39:51] God. Amen. Your flesh might fight you on
[1:39:54] this and sometimes the flesh might win.
[1:39:56] But there's something on the inside that
[1:39:58] has one purpose and that is to believe
[1:40:00] the word of God. Amen. Amen. You got to
[1:40:04] feed that. You got to feed that. But in
[1:40:07] on the inside of the inside, if you're a
[1:40:09] child of God, there's something that's
[1:40:11] born to believe. Amen. So if you cannot
[1:40:13] sin, if you if the attribute of sin is
[1:40:15] unbelief and it's not found in your
[1:40:17] soul, the eternal part, then how can you
[1:40:20] be condemned? If the sole portion of
[1:40:23] your life is perfect, then how can you
[1:40:25] be judged? That's why Paul said in
[1:40:27] Romans 8:1, "There is therefore now no
[1:40:29] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:40:31] who walk not after the flesh, but after
[1:40:33] the spirit." How can you fear death when
[1:40:36] there's no sin to be found in you? The
[1:40:38] soul is what he's coming for. The soul
[1:40:40] is what goes to hell or heaven. And if
[1:40:43] the soul has no unbelief in it, it has
[1:40:45] no sin in it, it cannot go to hell. It
[1:40:49] cannot die.
[1:40:51] It cannot do it. Amen. It cannot be
[1:40:54] found because Christ erased every
[1:40:56] portion of sin attached to that soul and
[1:40:59] now all God can see is the seed that he
[1:41:02] planted from the very beginning. Amen.
[1:41:05] Abraham says it this way. He says, "Now
[1:41:07] the scriptures are our absolute. It's
[1:41:09] infallible proof of what we are speaking
[1:41:11] of. First John 3:9, a man that's born of
[1:41:13] God cannot sin. It's impossible for him
[1:41:16] to sin." Who is a sin offering? It's
[1:41:18] Jesus Christ. Who died for us? Christ.
[1:41:20] What did he die for? Our sins. He took
[1:41:22] my punishment. Is that right? And then
[1:41:24] how do I get into him? By one spirit.
[1:41:26] We're all baptized into one body. And
[1:41:28] when in this body, we're covered by the
[1:41:31] blood and free from the judgment. He
[1:41:34] says he cannot sin because there's a
[1:41:36] blood sacrifice laying for him day and
[1:41:38] night. Hallelujah. He can't sin. He has
[1:41:40] no desire of sin. And then he says these
[1:41:42] words, if he does do something wrong, he
[1:41:46] doesn't mean to do it.
[1:41:49] Church, you talk about a get out of jail
[1:41:50] free
[1:41:51] card. He says, "For by one spirit we are
[1:41:54] all baptized into one body and are free
[1:41:57] from sin and we cannot sin." There's an
[1:41:59] atonement waiting for me. But he says
[1:42:02] this, "If there's still desire in your
[1:42:04] heart to sin, you have never been
[1:42:06] baptized into that body because you're
[1:42:08] dead and your life is hid in Christ
[1:42:10] through God and sealed by the Holy
[1:42:12] Ghost." He says, "Christians don't sin.
[1:42:16] They make mistakes, but they don't sin.
[1:42:19] He says, "Amen." That's the reason they
[1:42:20] don't, for he cannot sin. Does that
[1:42:22] teach you the balance between sin and
[1:42:24] mistakes? Sin is a soul condition.
[1:42:27] Mistakes are a flesh condition. Okay? We
[1:42:31] make mistakes, but on the inside of the
[1:42:33] inside, we still believe God. What
[1:42:35] happened is we lost a battle. We made a
[1:42:37] mistake. We got fooled. We got trapped.
[1:42:39] Whatever we want to say about that.
[1:42:40] Amen. But our security is that on the
[1:42:42] inside there's still a desire to serve
[1:42:44] God, to believe him at his word. Amen.
[1:42:47] Think about that for a second. Those of
[1:42:49] you that are here that were not raised
[1:42:50] in this message, how did you get
[1:42:52] here? How did you of all people get
[1:42:55] here? And why are you here? And why is
[1:42:57] nobody else here? Because there's
[1:42:58] something on the inside of you that is
[1:43:01] built to receive the word. And all your
[1:43:04] life was just there to get you to a
[1:43:07] place to give your soul an opportunity
[1:43:10] to see who you are. How? By the word of
[1:43:13] God. Amen. Why? In the very beginning,
[1:43:15] God placed a seed inside of you to
[1:43:18] receive the word. And that seed was
[1:43:20] sitting there waiting for the word to
[1:43:21] come. And as soon as the word came, what
[1:43:24] happened? Life sprang forth from that
[1:43:26] light of the word. And all of a sudden,
[1:43:27] a new creation was born.
[1:43:30] The only way you could come was there
[1:43:32] was something in you to receive, to
[1:43:34] believe, to accept the word. You didn't
[1:43:36] know it was there, but the minute you
[1:43:38] came into light, it came forth and you
[1:43:39] said, "I am a child of God. Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] Praise the Lord. I'm not a Catholic. I'm
[1:43:44] not a
[1:43:47] drinker." You didn't deserve it. You
[1:43:51] didn't do something to make it happen.
[1:43:52] It was something that was laying there
[1:43:54] and it was just looking for an
[1:43:56] opportunity to believe. That's why we're
[1:43:58] called believers. We believe and we're a
[1:44:01] believer before we ever do it because
[1:44:03] there's something inside of us that is
[1:44:04] built to believe. That's why we can be
[1:44:08] here this morning and accept this word.
[1:44:09] There's something in us that we didn't
[1:44:11] put there that causes us to take hold of
[1:44:13] the word of God. Principle one.
[1:44:15] Principle two, he says, "For his seed
[1:44:18] remainth in him." Now, this is a a
[1:44:20] beautiful truth and it ties us back to
[1:44:22] the truth of predestination because
[1:44:24] predestination is really the first of
[1:44:26] the seed principles.
[1:44:28] Because before God ever planted seeds in
[1:44:30] the earth, he planted seeds by his word.
[1:44:32] And those seeds included you and I.
[1:44:34] Amen. Remember, predestination is not
[1:44:36] God picking you and turning me down.
[1:44:39] It's not God looking forward and seeing
[1:44:40] what we would do and then saying, "Well,
[1:44:41] that one's going to be my child." But
[1:44:43] predestination is God thinking of you
[1:44:45] beforehand, putting his own attributes
[1:44:47] and details into you, and then speaking
[1:44:50] that word and you coming forth out of
[1:44:51] that word. That's what predestination
[1:44:53] is. Okay?
[1:44:56] It is the seed of God in your life.
[1:44:58] That's what predestination
[1:45:00] is. All that the father have given me
[1:45:03] will come to me. I can't lose any. Why?
[1:45:05] There's a seed of God there. You can't
[1:45:07] change it. You can't change it. You
[1:45:10] can't lose what it is. It is what it is.
[1:45:12] It always will be that thing. And John's
[1:45:14] showing us that that there's a portion
[1:45:15] of God within every single child of God.
[1:45:18] And it's always been there. And just
[1:45:20] like Jesus said, we come from God and we
[1:45:22] go back to God. Origin is destiny.
[1:45:24] That's what he's trying to show us here.
[1:45:26] He's saying, "No matter what you do, no
[1:45:28] matter what you've done, no matter what
[1:45:30] happens, the seed of God does not leave
[1:45:33] you. You can't change who you are on the
[1:45:36] inside or the inside. If God's seed
[1:45:38] remains in you, that means that you are
[1:45:40] acceptable no matter what because you
[1:45:42] come from him." Scripture says
[1:45:45] though
[1:45:47] um he says uh though though we though we
[1:45:51] deny him he says he cannot he remains
[1:45:54] faithful he cannot deny himself.
[1:46:00] Amen. How can you be anything less than
[1:46:02] perfect if the seed of God is inside of
[1:46:04] you? If you come from perfection, if you
[1:46:07] come from holiness, if you come from
[1:46:08] righteousness, if you come from
[1:46:10] eternity, how can you be anything less
[1:46:12] than that?
[1:46:14] What did we say earlier? Whatsoever a
[1:46:16] man sws that shall he also reap. Church,
[1:46:18] let me take it a little higher.
[1:46:19] Whatsoever God sws, that shall he also
[1:46:22] reap. Hallelujah. That's where you're
[1:46:24] sitting at this morning. God has sold
[1:46:26] you from his thoughts, from his word,
[1:46:28] from his ideas before the foundation of
[1:46:30] the world. And when you were brought
[1:46:32] into this very life, you were brought in
[1:46:34] with the segene of God inside of you.
[1:46:36] And what is God doing? He's reaping what
[1:46:38] he sowed. God binds himself to his own
[1:46:41] word. He says, "God won't be mocked by
[1:46:43] what you do, but I'm living my own life
[1:46:45] because of what he swed because of what
[1:46:48] he planted." And it was a word seed
[1:46:49] inside of us, church. He planted
[1:46:51] perfection. He's going to get
[1:46:52] perfection. He planted eternal life,
[1:46:54] he's going to get eternal life. He
[1:46:55] planted holiness, he's going to get
[1:46:56] holiness. He planted healing, he's going
[1:46:58] to get healing. He planted deliverance,
[1:47:01] he's going to get deliverance. Every
[1:47:02] attribute of God is baked into the seed
[1:47:04] of God that's inside of you. It's not
[1:47:06] your life, it's his life. It's not your
[1:47:08] perfection, it's his perfection. It's
[1:47:10] the C gene of God inside of us. Amen.
[1:47:12] It's the word inside of you. And you
[1:47:14] say, "Brother John, I don't look
[1:47:15] anything like what this Bible says right
[1:47:17] now." What did Paul say? He says, "It
[1:47:20] does not yet appear what we shall
[1:47:24] be." Listen, some of us are in the
[1:47:27] stock. We're just the the the little
[1:47:30] slip of the stock that's coming out.
[1:47:33] Some of us are the
[1:47:35] husk. Doesn't look like wheat yet.
[1:47:39] Some of us are almost to the opening of
[1:47:42] it and some of us are fully
[1:47:45] open. Listen, you can be at many
[1:47:47] different stages of your Christian walk.
[1:47:48] It doesn't yet appear what you shall be.
[1:47:51] But Paul says when we know that when we
[1:47:55] see him, we shall be like him. Period.
[1:48:00] God's going to finish the work. Why?
[1:48:01] Because a seed always produces what's in
[1:48:04] it. It's got to come to life. And when
[1:48:06] it comes to life, he doesn't start a
[1:48:08] work to stop a work. So, he's going to
[1:48:10] take you through. And in the end, you
[1:48:12] will be as he saw you. You will be as he
[1:48:14] made you to be. You will be everything
[1:48:15] that he placed inside you by the word of
[1:48:17] God. You can't get away from it. Don't
[1:48:20] worry about how you look. Worry if
[1:48:22] you're not changing.
[1:48:24] Let's keep moving. Let's keep crying.
[1:48:26] Let's keep drinking. Let's keep eating
[1:48:27] the word of God to produce himself
[1:48:29] inside of us. Listen to this. He says,
[1:48:32] "But we know that human beings can make
[1:48:34] mistakes, but God can make no mistake."
[1:48:36] Church, you're not a mistake this
[1:48:37] morning. You say, "I feel weak. I feel
[1:48:40] weird. I feel left out. I feel like I
[1:48:43] don't have the
[1:48:45] victory." Doesn't matter. God doesn't
[1:48:48] make mistakes. You're not a mistake this
[1:48:50] morning. Doesn't matter how you feel.
[1:48:52] Doesn't matter your perception of
[1:48:53] yourself. But the spirit of God is here
[1:48:54] to change your perception. Not just your
[1:48:57] perception, but your reality. Amen. If
[1:49:00] you can change your perception, reality
[1:49:02] will follow behind it. God's trying to
[1:49:04] get your mind. You're the eternal part
[1:49:06] of me in life in time. You're not a
[1:49:11] mistake. We disappoint ourselves so many
[1:49:13] times, don't
[1:49:15] we? God doesn't make mistakes,
[1:49:17] church. The scripture says in Hebrews,
[1:49:20] "Out of weakness, they were made
[1:49:21] strong." That gives me hope this
[1:49:23] morning. Out of weakness we're made
[1:49:25] strong. Listen, it's not how we start,
[1:49:26] it's how we finish. cuz we all started
[1:49:29] born in sin, shaped iniquity, come to
[1:49:31] the world, speaking lies. But there's a
[1:49:32] people that are going to take that word
[1:49:34] all the way into a rapture that changes
[1:49:35] their body. That's what I'm holding on
[1:49:38] to this morning.
[1:49:39] Amen. God doesn't plant mistakes. God
[1:49:42] doesn't sew mistakes. God plants
[1:49:45] perfection. And he's going to get it out
[1:49:47] of every one of us. Amen. Third
[1:49:50] principle, he says, "And he cannot sin
[1:49:53] because he is born of God."
[1:49:56] What you come out of is what you are. Is
[1:49:59] there any sin in God? No. Can't be any
[1:50:02] sin in you because you're a part of him.
[1:50:04] Where's your security, church? He made
[1:50:07] me, called me, chose me, birthed me.
[1:50:11] He'll take me through. You can't
[1:50:14] sin. I'm not encouraging you to test
[1:50:19] that. But you can't
[1:50:21] disbelieve. You'll try to disbelieve.
[1:50:24] Listen, church. Look at I'll speak of my
[1:50:26] own new birth experience. I believed
[1:50:30] while trying not to give
[1:50:32] in for seven years from the age of 10 to
[1:50:35] the age of 17 until I gave my heart to
[1:50:37] Christ. I believed even though I didn't
[1:50:40] want to
[1:50:41] believe. Brother Gerald would always
[1:50:43] talk. He said, "I never knew what was
[1:50:44] going on, brother Jonathan." Because he
[1:50:46] would stare at me and he'd barely blink
[1:50:47] and he'd never move, but I couldn't tell
[1:50:48] if it was having an effect on him. Well,
[1:50:50] what was happening on the inside was an
[1:50:52] effect. And inside I believed every word
[1:50:55] he said, but I wouldn't give into it.
[1:50:58] But I couldn't disbelieve it. Couldn't
[1:51:00] disbelieve it. Praise the Lord. I
[1:51:01] couldn't disbelieve it. And sometimes we
[1:51:04] try to suppress it. And we suppress it
[1:51:05] with rock and roll. And we suppress it
[1:51:07] with with pornography. And we suppress
[1:51:08] it with relationships and rebellion and
[1:51:10] all these different things that young
[1:51:12] men like to do. But in the end, God
[1:51:14] doesn't make mistakes. What he has sowed
[1:51:17] is what he's going to reap. And I had to
[1:51:19] come through no matter what. Praise the
[1:51:21] Lord. That's why I'm here this morning.
[1:51:23] That's why you have a pastor this
[1:51:24] morning is because God doesn't make
[1:51:26] mistakes.
[1:51:28] He doesn't mistake in the planting. Come
[1:51:30] on. Doesn't make mistakes in the
[1:51:32] planting. Doesn't make mistakes in the
[1:51:34] watering. And he won't make a mistake in
[1:51:36] the harvest time either. Hallelujah.
[1:51:39] That's why we're here this morning. God
[1:51:41] doesn't make mistakes.
[1:51:46] He says you don't sin because the seed
[1:51:48] of God remains in you. You're born of
[1:51:50] God. You can't sin. God can't attribute
[1:51:53] something that comes from him as sinful.
[1:51:55] That would be a failure on his part.
[1:51:58] Amen. Not on our
[1:52:00] part. We got a reason to shout this
[1:52:02] morning,
[1:52:03] church. We got a reason to shout. You
[1:52:06] can't lose, Sister Justine. You can't
[1:52:07] lose. You've already won. You've already
[1:52:10] won. Hallelujah. You're already there.
[1:52:13] You've already made it in the eternal
[1:52:14] God's eyes. Amen. The same one that
[1:52:17] defeated Satan and walks around with the
[1:52:19] keys of death, hell, and the grave on
[1:52:21] his hip is living in you today. When
[1:52:24] Satan comes to talk to you, how about
[1:52:26] you say, "Lord Jesus, can you just
[1:52:28] rattle the keys to his house a little
[1:52:29] bit to remind him that he doesn't even
[1:52:31] own his own domain.
[1:52:35] We got to realize, church, greater is he
[1:52:38] that's in me than he that's in the
[1:52:39] world."
[1:52:42] Hallelujah. He says, God has already
[1:52:44] glorified his church. He's now speaking
[1:52:46] further in Romans 8. We'll get to it in
[1:52:48] another service. We're closing now. He
[1:52:49] says, "But those who he has justified,
[1:52:51] he also glorified in the church in
[1:52:53] Christ. And if you're justified in
[1:52:55] Christ, you're glorified in Christ
[1:52:56] already as far as God is concerned."
[1:52:59] Church, that's the only one I care
[1:53:00] about. What does God say about it? He
[1:53:02] says, "There Jesus said, be ye therefore
[1:53:05] perfect even as your father in heaven is
[1:53:07] perfect." How could you ever be perfect?
[1:53:10] Anybody here want to raise their hand
[1:53:11] and say, "I'm perfect."
[1:53:14] Brother Paul has a
[1:53:15] revelation. He says, "But in the sight
[1:53:18] of Christ tonight, every bornagain
[1:53:21] Christian is perfect." I'm preaching
[1:53:23] perfection this morning. I'm I'm
[1:53:25] preaching there's no room for fear.
[1:53:26] Perfect people don't have
[1:53:29] fear. He says, "I'm just as perfect in
[1:53:31] God as Christ was, and you are too.
[1:53:33] Every other believer, for it's not my
[1:53:35] holiness, it's his holiness. God can't
[1:53:37] accept mine. I have none. But I come in
[1:53:39] Christ by faith and by Christ I'm in him
[1:53:42] and perfect in the sight of God. He
[1:53:44] says, "Look, by one spirit, we're all
[1:53:45] baptized into one body and become
[1:53:47] members of this body." In Romans 8:1,
[1:53:49] there's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:53:51] them that are in Christ Jesus that walk
[1:53:52] not after the flesh, but the spirit. And
[1:53:55] a man that's in Christ Jesus walks after
[1:53:57] spiritual things. To the world, it's
[1:53:59] carnal mind, it's foolishness, but to
[1:54:01] them that believe it's everlasting life.
[1:54:03] There you are. He says, "Oh, how
[1:54:04] marvelous." Then what can harm you?
[1:54:06] You're in Christ. And just as sure as
[1:54:09] God raised Jesus from the dead will come
[1:54:11] in Christ. Amen. Yes, we've got to.
[1:54:13] God's promised it. For as sure as that
[1:54:15] body goes up, I'm in that body and I
[1:54:18] have to go with it. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:21] God bless you. Let's stand this morning.
[1:54:23] You can't undo this, church. You can't
[1:54:26] stop it. You can't keep it from
[1:54:28] happening. Our little foibless, our
[1:54:31] little failures, our big ones, our
[1:54:33] natural DNA, our mommy, our daddy, our
[1:54:35] church, none of it can stop it. Nothing
[1:54:38] can stop it. Amen. It's a seed
[1:54:40] principle. What God has sowed, he's got
[1:54:42] to reap. You can't push the spirit of
[1:54:44] God away. If you're a child of God, it
[1:54:45] will stay there until you come. It'll
[1:54:48] woo you. And you may push it. You may
[1:54:50] try and sil silence it. You may try and
[1:54:52] suppress it, but that still small voice
[1:54:54] will stay there until you answer to it.
[1:54:56] Why? Because that seed has to come to
[1:54:58] life.
[1:54:59] Amen. You can't unbreak who you are. You
[1:55:03] can't break it. You can't make yourself
[1:55:04] a child of hell out of a child of God.
[1:55:06] You can't do it. You can't You can't
[1:55:09] take your eternal salvation and throw it
[1:55:11] away. You can't do it. You can reap what
[1:55:14] you sow, but you can't break the seed
[1:55:16] principle. Amen. What do we cry about?
[1:55:19] If I was to give you one thing this
[1:55:22] morning, you could have anything you
[1:55:23] want. What would it
[1:55:24] be? What's our heart's desire? What are
[1:55:27] we crying out for? Paul said, "There's a
[1:55:28] spirit of God inside of us that cries,
[1:55:30] "Father, Father." It's calling out for a
[1:55:32] reason, church. What do we want this
[1:55:34] morning? If I could give you anything
[1:55:35] you wanted, $10
[1:55:38] million, latest car, biggest house,
[1:55:41] fantastic career, perfect body, perfect
[1:55:44] health. What would it
[1:55:47] be, church? What we've got is so much
[1:55:49] further than that. Those things are
[1:55:52] temporal. They only last a little while.
[1:55:55] But we've got something reserved for us
[1:55:57] in heaven. Undefiled, incorruptible,
[1:56:02] eternal. But we've got something inside
[1:56:04] of us to take us through to that. I'll
[1:56:06] tell you this. There's there's one thing
[1:56:07] that every believer ought to have a cry
[1:56:09] for. More of God. If you've received the
[1:56:12] Holy Spirit, more of it. Less of me,
[1:56:15] more of him. Amen. That ought to be the
[1:56:18] cry of our
[1:56:20] hearts. He'll add whatever else he needs
[1:56:23] to after that. But if we seek him first,
[1:56:26] if that cry is there for him, church,
[1:56:29] that's the thing that we're looking for.
[1:56:31] That desire in our heart for more of
[1:56:33] him. Amen. Can we sing that just play
[1:56:36] softly? More of you, more of you. As we
[1:56:38] go to prayer. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[1:56:40] each
[1:56:41] one. Amen. He's calling us
[1:56:45] higher. He's saying, "Reach out to me,
[1:56:47] child. Cry out.
[1:56:51] Sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[1:56:54] Tired of being trampled down. Tired of
[1:56:57] fighting. Young people, you tired of
[1:56:59] fighting. Pushing back,
[1:57:01] God, refusing to give in. You'll be
[1:57:05] miserable until you give in. Been there,
[1:57:07] done
[1:57:08] that. But you cry out to him. You say,
[1:57:10] "Father, I'm coming home. Lord, I'm
[1:57:13] coming back to
[1:57:14] you. Lord, I've got my priorities
[1:57:17] straightened. I need to come back to
[1:57:18] you.
[1:57:21] Look into your life. Look at your
[1:57:26] desires. Say,
[1:57:28] "Lord, let me put you at the top of that
[1:57:32] list."
[1:57:34] Amen. Heavenly
[1:57:36] Father, Lord, certainly we need more of
[1:57:38] you this morning, Lord. But I we know
[1:57:41] that if we have a soul desire, our
[1:57:43] heart's cry for that thing, Lord. We
[1:57:45] know it's there to to be given to us,
[1:57:47] Lord. Lord, if we've got a desire of the
[1:57:49] things of God, then there's a thing of
[1:57:51] God to meet that desire. Heavenly
[1:57:54] Father, Lord, I preached as hard as I
[1:57:56] can preach this
[1:57:58] morning, Lord. But it takes your spirit
[1:58:00] to quicken, Lord. The word has gone
[1:58:03] forth, Lord. But I pray you look into
[1:58:05] our lives, that you'd look into our
[1:58:07] hearts this morning, heavenly father,
[1:58:10] Lord, and where we've turned aside from
[1:58:11] the desire of you and into the desire of
[1:58:14] something else, Lord. I pray you bring
[1:58:15] us
[1:58:16] back, Lord. Put you in prayer eminence
[1:58:19] in our lives again, Lord. And that's a
[1:58:21] choice we have, Lord. It's a decision we
[1:58:24] make every single
[1:58:25] day. But Lord, I'm raising my hand. I
[1:58:28] want more of you this morning, Lord
[1:58:30] Jesus. Lord, I want to draw even further
[1:58:33] away from these things of the
[1:58:35] world. Lord, I want your word to have a
[1:58:37] perfect effect in my life, Lord. Lord,
[1:58:40] there's a seed that's come to life,
[1:58:42] Lord. But we want it to produce fruit
[1:58:43] this morning, Lord, that's fit for
[1:58:45] service. Lord, we want a life that
[1:58:47] reflects a living Christ. Lord, not a a
[1:58:50] man of 2,000 years or a God that's just
[1:58:52] above us, Lord, but a God in flesh this
[1:58:54] morning is what we're looking for. So
[1:58:57] Lord, I pray you speak to your people.
[1:59:00] Work in our lives, work in our hearts,
[1:59:02] Lord. Lord, and when we put you in a
[1:59:04] place of preeminence, Lord, we know
[1:59:06] we'll receive everything we have need
[1:59:08] of. Grant us grace,
[1:59:10] Lord. Help us choose
[1:59:13] life every day. Lord, we ask it in Jesus
[1:59:17] name.
[1:59:21] Amen. More of
[1:59:28] you.
[1:59:30] More of
[1:59:35] you. Yes, I've had it all.
[1:59:40] But what I need is more of
[1:59:49] you. Of things I've had my
[1:59:56] fill, but yet I
[2:00:01] hunger
[2:00:03] still. Oh, empty and
[2:00:07] bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of
[2:00:17] you. I need more of
[2:00:21] [Music]
[2:00:25] you. More of
[2:00:32] you. I've had it all.
[2:00:37] of what I need is more of
[2:00:45] you. Of things I've had my
[2:00:52] fill, but
[2:00:54] yet I
[2:00:57] hunger
[2:01:00] still. Oh, empty and
[2:01:04] bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of
[2:01:14] you. More of you.
[2:01:23] more of you.
[2:01:33] But what I need is more of
[2:01:42] you of things I've had my fill.
[2:01:50] But yet I
[2:01:54] hunger
[2:01:57] still. Oh, empty and
[2:02:01] bare. Lord, hear my prayer for more of
[2:02:08] you.
[2:02:15] The haven of rest. 3:30.
[2:02:21] We're talking about casting out every
[2:02:23] fear, no room for
[2:02:25] fear. I love this
[2:02:29] song cuz once you've been saved, you
[2:02:31] know what it is to be lost. But boy, you
[2:02:34] know that sweet sense of relief, that
[2:02:36] rest, that assurance that just comes
[2:02:38] with knowing you're secure. Amen. I
[2:02:41] believe this is a testimony of every
[2:02:43] believer that when we make him our
[2:02:45] choice, we enter a place of rest. Amen.
[2:02:48] Let's just sing this
[2:02:50] together. My
[2:02:53] soul in sad
[2:02:56] exile was out on life.
[2:03:01] See, so
[2:03:04] burdened with sin and distress.
[2:03:13] Oh, till I heard a sweet
[2:03:18] voice say,
[2:03:20] "Make me your choice."
[2:03:27] The
[2:03:29] haven of rest.
[2:03:35] Oh,
[2:03:37] I my soul
[2:03:41] in the
[2:03:43] haven of
[2:03:46] rest. I'll sail. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:03:51] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:03:53] Praise your name, Lord. Thank you, Lord
[2:03:56] Jesus. Though the
[2:03:59] tempest may
[2:04:02] sweep for the
[2:04:05] wild stormy
[2:04:08] deep but in
[2:04:11] Jesus I'm
[2:04:13] safe ever more.
[2:04:20] I
[2:04:21] yielded
[2:04:24] myself to his
[2:04:27] tender and
[2:04:30] grace and
[2:04:32] faith taking hold of Hallelujah.
[2:04:37] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Yes. Praise
[2:04:40] your name. My feathers fell off.
[2:04:43] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Yes. And I
[2:04:47] anchor my soul. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:04:50] Lord Jesus.
[2:04:54] Amen.
[2:04:57] Yes. It is my
[2:05:01] Lord. For I've
[2:05:05] anchored my
[2:05:08] soul in the
[2:05:11] haven of rest.
[2:05:14] Oh, I'll sail the wild
[2:05:19] seas no more.

[2:05:26] The
[2:05:27] tempest may

[2:05:33] while sore
[2:05:36] deep. But in
[2:05:38] Jesus I am
[2:05:41] safe ever more.
[2:05:47] The
[2:05:49] song of my
[2:05:52] soul since the
[2:05:55] Lord made me
[2:05:58] whole has been the old
[2:06:03] story so
[2:06:08] blessed of
[2:06:11] Jesus who
[2:06:14] saved who
[2:06:16] Whoever will
[2:06:19] have a
