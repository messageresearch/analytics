Sheep of your pasture you are the great Shepherd Lord I pray that you would just speak to hearts and souls tonight Lord encourage us direct us Lord set our path straight Lord we pray Lord encourage us we ask now in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Mark chapter 4 and verse two Mark chapter 4 and verse two it's good to be back in the house of the Lord again good to see each one that's here amen I just want to thank each one of you for your participation your support your work your patience your energy this weekend with the camp meetings I think it was just an absolutely wonderful time in the Lord amen so I appreciate each one that's made the lazy lasagnas that has cut up and prepared the food beforehand that went and set up audio visual equipment and set up chairs and tables and took things apart and repackaged it and brother Chad entered the ministry this weekend the ministry of transportation did all the hauling back and forth took his time and his vehicles and his gas and his employees and these different things and my it was just a wonderful time wasn't it amen but we thank the Lord most of all for his presence for his faithfulness amen for preparing these things and ordaining it and I think I I just have to believe the Lord had his way amen that it was a wonderful time but thank you each one that that puts it all that time in again Especial thanks to brother Paul and sister Kimberly for their extra effort above and beyond and you know there's is an unpaid gig like most of the offices in the church but they've really put their time and energy on the line and we sure appreciate that what they've done amen God bless you Mark 4 and: 2 this is Jesus and it says and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his Doctrine hearken behold there went out a sewer to sew and it came to pass as he sewed some fell by the wayside and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up and some fell on Stony ground where it had not much Earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of Earth says but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away and some fell among thorns and the Thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit and others fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some 30 and some 60 and some 100 and he said unto them he that have ears let him hear amen God bless you can have your seats this evening and you I was talking to brother Aaron about this that I think the toughest surface to preach is the one that's right after camp meeting because we've come there and it's the people have out you know they come out with such a great attitude and that warmth and anticipation they're basking in the goodness of the things of God and it's a wonderful thing and we love it and we appreciate it but then the preacher has to come up behind afterwards and we can feel pressure if I'm to be honest this evening amen because what happens is we've got to keep moving forward amen we've got to keep pressing on and it's good to talk and fellowship and share our experiences and boy if we have a testimony we ought to be telling it to everybody that'll listen to us telling your testimony will encourage you it'll it'll anchor it it'll settle it in your heart the more we talk about the things of God then the more those things become a reality in our life and it helps give us faith and it helps us to hold on the things that we've gotten amen and you I was talking with brother Paul and Sister Kim and I said I just wish we could stay in Camp all the time you know and it's it's it's 99% Believers and and everyone's just pulling together and it's it's a just a little taste of Heaven I think it's a preview of what we'll have on the other side even though we're in these sinful bodies that get tired and occasionally cranky or a little wore out and these different things but we know we don't get to do that and we have to come back to real life and we have to come back to the Daily Grind and we have commitments and all of these different things and we have to raise our families and go to our jobs and whatnot and sometimes it's that first few days after camp that can be the toughest the first few days after special meetings the first few days after a wonderful experience with God and you know I was just thinking about this and I I looked up what brother Bram said because he talks about this transition time of of coming back to the way you have to live your day-to-day life amen we don't really get that that that permanency of of being in the presence of God and the people of God until we get to the other side and brother bam talks about this and he says then I wonder sometimes I get so discouraged the prophet of God with the signs and wonders the the the the Fantastic Ministry that he he had he says I get so discouraged it's a wonder my wife can put up with me I go around and after the meeting I feel so moody I Cry a while and walk around a while and say oh I'm a total failure I don't see why the Lord ever had anything to do with me he says it's coming out from under that anointing you see he says when you're up there when you're up on the platform you could pack the world away and when you're down here or what when everything's kind of drained away he says you're down here it's all right when when everything's kind of moved back to normal he says it's all right but it's coming between the two he says he he says see that's where it gets you it's it's not that that when you're up here that it's it's all good and and down here it's all bad because down here it's not bad the Walk of the of the Christian daily is an overcoming walk it's a Victorious walk but there's a transition of the feeling a and the just the overpowering of the anointing of God and he says it's when you're coming down off of it that's where the real struggle is and he point to Elijah and he has a Mount Caramel experience and God comes down and he he proves himself by fire and he proves his word and he proves his prophet and then the prophet goes and he calls for rain and at his word rain comes and he kills the prophets the false prophets of Jezebel and everything's going so good and then he's got still that much strength and his legs and his body that he can outrun ahab's Chariot down the mountain he's had a supernatural experience in the presence of God and then brother Braham says what happens he goes and he ends up running away from a woman's voice it's that transition away from from the highs of the experience of of the blessings of God now walking down to where we walk day by day and it's not that we can't have those things day by day it's just that we don't tend to have those things day by day because we're not committed day in and day out to be spending our time around the people of God and the word of God we've got to work we've got to focus on other things we've got to make a living amen and you know sometimes the hardest thing for me is driving the ministers and and their spouses to the airport because when I do it seems like we're just dropping off a part of the experience we're dropping off a part of our little family here and it just seems like a part of your heart goes with them so that was why I was kind of glad when brother Chad agreed to do it or he asked to do it actually he didn't agree to do it he offered to do it and it allowed me to get some sleep yesterday and and and wake up I had to study all day to prepare for service and back to work and these different things but but as good as those things are we've got to keep moving forward amen we've got to press forward and we can be thankful for those things they they become a part of our our Christian walk they become a part of our testimony they become of growing in Christ in Grace and in love but we have to keep going from those things even brother Aaron was saying this week you can't look back to what you had you have to press forward to what is going to be what God has for you you I was talking with brother Aaron for quite some time on Sunday evening and he shared something a minister once said to him and this is a a well-known Minister a very Dynamic Minister he's not a you know a fuddy duddy that doesn't believe in the moving of the spirit or or these sorts of things things but they'd had some great services that weekend and and the brother said you know he said every service can't be like those kinds of services we want those Services we love those Services if we are honest most of us would probably prefer those types of services he says but there's a problem with with having those Services all those times he says because those services are often a harvesting of something there's been a battle there's been a struggle there's been a seeking there's been a pressing there's been a praying there's been an expectation and then finally everyone comes together the presence of God comes down and he answers us he says but the thing is if you're always doing that he says you're never planting you're never planting see we've got a plant there's a cycle remember we preached those Services where where we said that that the word of God is in a cycle and it's not always maturing it's not always uh producing that fruit it's not always getting the benefits because there's got to be a planting time and a dying out time and a growing time and a maturing time and then there's a time where where things just have to completely dry out to come out and be that that mature fruit and then there's a harvest time so we've got to have all of these different things and and this Pastor said he said I would be concerned if every service was like that amen it's not the way it's supposed to be we have Services of worship and praise and victory but we also need Services of repentance and sorrow remember brother bam he has that service it might be convinced and concerned I'm not sure and the and the people are just in a state of repentance and it's very sober and I remember brother Gerald repeating this many times he says we need to have more services like this amen where there's a dying out where there's a putting aside there's a separation we need Services where there's a deep inward searching amen where we compare where we're at with what the word says we need Services of healing we remember when brother Joe Adams was here and his whole Ministry is on Faith and Healing we need services like that but we can't have every service like that amen it can't all be that we need Services of correction we need Services of encouragement we need Services of discernment where the Lord is just moving throughout the the the body of Christ in these different things remember what Paul said to Timothy he said all scripture is given I've got an issue here okay brother Matt she's coming down for you in 2 Timothy 3:16 Paul said all scripture is given by inspiration of God and it's profitable for doctr oh that's teaching he says then for reproof that's correction that's not just correction that's saying you know better then he says for instruction in righteousness that's how to live that's how to how to have an overcoming life that's how to be pleasing in God's eyes so in other words the word is given for all sorts of purposes and that means it's delivered in all sorts of different ways for those different purposes and we ought to be able to rejoice in all of it I love love how brother Aram brought that out i' never seen it that way where he said that David said thy rod and thy staff they comfort me that the correction that the guiding of God in our lives is a comfort because it means he's there and he's concerned about what we're doing amen and it's a comfort and he was talking about how when God steps on your toes when the preacher steps on your toes when the word comes into your life and it makes something uncomfortable we ought to say hallelujah to those moments because it means that God cares about where we're at and what we're doing and what's going on inside of our Lives amen it's good when God comes down do those things and and it brings us to a place of Victory it brings us to a place of healing it brings us to a place of Deliverance because when we can live where his word is then we can be blessed amen we can't enjoy the goodness of God living a life of our own leading it's got to be his leading that does it and the guidance and correction of God the teaching of God takes us into his goodness you know and really life is defined by contrast you'll notice that people that that are working all the time all they want is the weekend and and but yet when you give them the weekend all the time they go into retirement so many of them struggle because there's no contrast every day is the same it's the work that makes the weekend en that much more enjoyable you know we don't like sickness but sickness is what makes our health that much more enjoyable we don't have much money and then we have more money and the contrast of those things is is the way that God is so many times and even in the beginning the the second verse of the Bible says God he he divided the light from the darkness and he dwells in that light the scripture says there's no no no variableness in him there's no shadow of turning there's he's just pure light he's he he's Purity in itself and everything else is darkness is not God but there's a contrast between him and everything else amen and our lives are defined by those contrasts and so if we have Services all the time that are those shouting praising there's no contrast there and we find they actually don't have the effect that they're supposed to have because we don't have anything else to put them up against amen Solomon knew this by inspiration in Ecclesiastes he said to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which is planted A Time to Kill and a time to heal a time to break down a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to MN and a time to dance a time to Cast Away Stones a time to gather Stones together a time to embrace a time to hug a time to be close and a time to refrain from the embracing he says a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to Cast Away a time a to Rend a time to tear a time to sww a time to keep silence a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of Peace So our lives are defined by these contrasts and we'll see that the word of God brings those contrasts into our lives and let me say this this this evening if you're in the time that doesn't feel so good know this there's a time of good that's coming and if you're in the time that's so good then guess what there's going to be a battle that's coming as well life is constantly changing and having an overcoming life does not mean that the circumstances are always good but what it means is that there's an anchor there's a rest in our heart and soul that is unchanging regardless of what those circumstances are inside of our life amen so this is my Prelude I want to take a just a service this evening on good ground good ground and because I want to help us to build off the experiences that we have with God not just this weekend but hopefully every week amen that that we can go by because we know the Rapture is a process amen we're not just going to walk through this life and then one day we're going to have rapturing faith that we're going to be walking around and we've got no overcoming power we've got no Victory we've got no arment and then tomorrow we go in a Rapture that is not going to happen God is building a body he is tying the people together under his headship and that is how we're going to go into raptures we're coming into a place of maturity amen I want to be able to look back and say God I see how I'm growing God I see how we're maturing brother Aaron and sister Lydia were saying how much the church has changed even in the last two years that they've been here that's a good thing we don't see it so often because we're around each other all the time but you get somebody that's been here and then they come in and they say oh my goodness things are so different now we say praise the Lord for that amen it shows that he's working inside of our lives but I want to keep going I want to keep pressing I want to keep maturing I want to keep growing as he challenges me I want to rise to the occasion by faith in the word and say Lord I'm ready to grow some more you know I was reading in my devotions this morning first Thessalonians 4:10 and Paul says we beseech you Brethren that ye increase more and more in other words you're doing great but don't stop don't rest on that keep going keep growing keep keep maturing in Christ amen so I want to go back to this parable of the S and we opened up in mark But I want to read the interpretation of it in Luke because Jesus gives a little more uh a little more detail here than he does in the others I felt Luke 8:11 says now the parable is this the seed is the word of God and you'll notice one thing as we look at this Parable the seed is never the problem the S is never the problem there's nothing wrong with the seed there's nothing wrong with the swer the problem is always with what the seed lands on that's where the problem always is amen the the the failures are a reflection of where the word lands not what the word is and brother Brian would say this he says God is his word do you believe God is his word he says every word of God is a seed you believe that he says now it's just like a seed you planted and if it's wheat it'll come up wheat he says every Divine promise of God will come to pass exactly now watch what he says if you'll put it in the right kind of ground and let it grow so it's got to come in the right kind of ground but we've got to work to do here he says you've got to let it grow you've got to let it become what it is you've got to let it mature into what is inside of it he says do you believe that place it there and say Lord by his stripes I was healed I'm Healed I accept it Lord and I'll never say nothing else I tell you brother that spits the dust in the devil's face right there for it's thus sayi the Lord I'll stay right there live or die I'll stay right there he says that's my convictions that's my stand on Christ the solid rock I'll stand all other ground is sinking SS he says stay right with it yes indeed it'll prod produce just what it said we're talking about good ground and he says it's got to be in the right kind of ground he says and you've got to let it grow in other words we've got something to do with this it me it's not just that this word is a magic potion that comes into our life and it just does something but we've got a part to play here and he says we've got to prepare the ground we've got to make sure the ground is good and then we've got to let the word do its job inside of our lives and our part is to make the ground ready that's what we're supposed to do our part is to set the conditions of our life such that life can come forth that we can control the environment that we can take something that's been planted and let it grow up inside of our lives and we'll talk about this a bit as we go through so he continues he says those by the wayside are they that hear this is the rocky ground he says but then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved now there's one thing we know even though we're not Farmers is you can't grow wheat on rocks it doesn't work amen it needs ground to grow and Stones aren't part of what Farmers would call a good ground you know if you're ever around a farmer's field I've seen them in Newland out in the gouls here where they'd have a sledge or a sled behind their tractor and every spring they go through and what are they pulling out of the ground rocks the biggest crop that Newland has is rocks and you can go through that field and it can be pristine after you take your harvest in the fall and you'll come back in the spring and you've got rock after Rock after Rock why the frost th the the freeze thaw cycle brings these rocks to the surface and they mess up your field and so they got to go all through there and clean that again before they plant a new crop now I don't want to turn this into a Negative Nancy sermon and believe me that's not what we're here for tonight but I'm here to help you hold on to what you've received that's what we're talking about amen talking about the background will let us see where the traps and and the pitfalls are before we get to what the good ground is and so we see here that if you're living a life that produces spiritual rocks then guess what just because it's the word of God does not mean it's going to come to life you've got to have a place where it can come in and dig down into the soil amen God does his part he sends his word amen he sends his anointing Behind these things and we just expect it to do amazing things because it's God but Jesus says no you've got to have a ground prepared in order for the word to take effect amen a seed doesn't get planted grow mature and get harvested in a moment or in a day it's a cycle of time amen and God's word is no different time and time again the scripture calls the word a seed or it Compares it to a seed and so that's how we understand how it works I took a whole service on this remember on the cycle of the word and how it has to be planted and rooted and then grow and then break through the surface and then it really starts to grow then it has to mature and then it has to ripen and then there's a harvest and all of these things so we've got to make a place for the word to grow inside of our lives and he says they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word how with joy he says and they have no root which for a while believe but in time of Temptation fall away this is the trickiest of all the conditions that a person can have because it says that they receive the word with joy they love the pr preaching of the word they love the worship they love the presence of God they love when the spirit of God comes down they love the atmosphere they love the fellowship it's so good it's wonderful and they're glowing after the service but then Temptation comes and they don't have Victory he says Temptation and Temptation here that that word means the trial the testing the proving of a person's integrity and commitment so in other words when the word is asked to be put into action in their life what happens is their living doesn't match up to their worship their experience doesn't match the decisions that they start making in their life anden there's a separation from their Church experience and their day-to-day experience they receive it with joy remember brother bam talks about when he was looking into you know he trying to understand how two men could have true gifts and they would be perfect in their operation but he says one was a real believer and one was and he says and God showed him that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and the weeds enjoy the rain just as much as the wheat enjoys the rain and so we can sit here and we can enjoy the preaching of the word but if we are not truly sincere if we're enjoying the moment but the ground isn't prepared then what happens when the hard time comes then we lose the victory we lose the word we lose the effect of the word brother Bram says it this way he says I've seen a lot of camp meetings people people go they'd shout the victory for a little while while the camp meeting was going on and then before the day was over with the night coming close they'll worry along and say well you know I wish I could keep the victory Hallelujah Oh my he says my I wish I just had the victory oh my says it's because you're not in the right place to eat the Mana that's right he says salvation only lasts as long as Faith lasts Divine Healing lasts as long as Faith lasts you don't go by your feelings amen can we say it together you don't go by your feelings he says I never was saved by my feelings I say praise the Lord for that because my feelings even as stable as I tend to be they still do this some of you go up and down like this and some of us go up and down like this but we all go up and down and our feelings come and go from good to bad don't they he says I never was saved by my feelings I wasn't saved because I felt good he didn't say we don't feel good we feel good don't we but he says that's not our saving he says I'm saved because I met God's promise he says that's right the devil can beat you around the stump on feelings but he can't speak on thus sayeth the Lord and condemn it he said I've done what Jesus said I'm saved tonight because I met God's requirement I'm Healed tonight amen we stand on thus sayith the Lord not on how we're feeling after it's all said and done amen as we go through life this life has a way of beating down our feelings but if we got the victory in here if the word is settled he says then he's not going to beat us up on that because we're resting on thus sayeth the Lord what is he comparing this rock to feelings that but there's a lack of real spiritual depth there's a lack a real Faith it's shallow ground they can't grow roots there's enough there for something to start but not enough for it to finish am me there's just a there there's a process that starts under the preaching of the word but this this type of a person doesn't want to go all the way they believe but only to a point right they agree but only to a point they want God in their life but only to a point And now when the test comes then they say sorry I didn't sign up for this and it falls away out of their life and they lose what they thought they had he said that's he said that's the way the word went and goes out some hear the word go out birds come along pick it up see they don't do no good at all but catch how he he phrases this now he says others come up overnight oh they're going to do great things and when the trials begin to come it chokes them down what's he talking about overnight Sensations right they have all the energy they have all the passion and then as soon as it has a personal impact in some way they say sorry it's not for me they're enthusiastic about the idea but they don't like the reality amen remember what John said or he quotes in Revelation 10 I think it's 8 where the angel says go and take the book go take the open book and he says eat it and he says it'll be sweet in your mouth but it'll be bitter in your belly and we can see that through the Christian walk is that there's an an enthusiasm and a passion that comes under the hearing of the word the receiving of the word but when we go to put into the action the digestion is not so easy anymore is it it's not so easy to do these things amen it doesn't feel good but one thing we know the results are always worth it but you've got to be able to do it brother BR would talk so many times he says if the medicine doesn't make you feel sick then it's not doing you any good in the first place if it tastes good then it's not medicine in the first place listen I church I believe in the changing power of the Holy Spirit I was changed in one moment amen when when I met Christ when I gave my life fully and completely to Christ I was completely changed in a moment absolutely absolutely but that didn't mean that I didn't have battles and struggles and fallings away and ups and downs and all these things inside of my life amen we believe that people that are truly meeting Christ that receive the new birth they're not who they used to be and it does it is a work of a moment but the proving of that moment takes a lifetime amen it takes real life to test those things and passion won't do the job passion will not get us through this amen now let's be very careful here I'd rather some Wildfire than no fire at all amen if we sit here like a lump on a log God help us amen we ought to be able to worship we ought to be able to respond to the word of God Amen but it ought to be a fire that reflects a reality in our life a sincerity in our life rather than just enthusiasm about what's going on Amen we want people that are enthusiastic because they know what it means to live what they're amening Amen in other words we want people that are enthusiastic about the effect not just the idea that's the reason why we keep coming back to hear the word and we accept it is wise because we've tasted and seen that the Lord is good we didn't say it was all sweet and sugary all the time but we've tasted and seen that the results are worth the pain and the TR struggles and the trials that we go through amen because as brother Bram said our feelings of Salvation our feelings of overcoming our our feelings of Victory won't won't hold us in times of stress in times of trial in times of testing and difficulty it takes an anchor in the soul amen it takes something deep inside of us amen knowing that he's with me that I didn't just hear a word I received a word and the word responded to the word and that's what's bubbling up inside of my life brother B says this he says what does the bible say that we are if we cannot stand the chastisement of God he says then we become illegitimate children so-called children but not real children of God he says the children of God know exactly where they stand where do they stand they stand on the word of God he says they know where they put their hope their faith their trust and nothing will ever shake them from it amen I say Lord help us to rest in that place because here's the thing has anybody ever had a moment of enthusiasm and then got it followed by disappointment all 10 fingers are are twinkling up here today listen if nothing else I disappoint myself time and time again I'll say Lord I thought I was further ahead than that but yet it's not about the enthusiasm men but it Victory is not about me Victory is about whether the word is kept in preeminence scripture says a just man falls seven times and get it up again it's not about my perfection it's not about my my great track record it's not about my my knowing all things but Victory is whether I can keep the word in preeminence in my life and say Lord that's where my rest is I'm standing on your word and I'm trusting your Holy Spirit to bring me all the way through to full and total Victory amen and how many times have I had to say Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I missed the Mark again and guess what church whether you've already fallen since that camp meeting whether you're going to fall tomorrow whether it'll be a month or whether it'll be a year at some point we're going to lose at some point that's the reality of living in this flesh and it may be in the smallest way but here's the thing the more mature you get the greater those small things hit you anyways and so you'll have a bad response you might say something that's not quite the way you meant it however that might be or you might have a big failing or falling out that is not where our rest is our rest is is that we've received the word it's engrafted in our heart and it's doing a work in our lives that's going to produce an overcoming Amen in our lives not everything I pray for happens sometimes our disappointments are on un on in unanswered prayers or it doesn't happen the way I thought it should amen but our Focus ought to be that we're resting on the word not on what we think the word is going to do that God does all things well I loved how brother Aram brought it out I had spoken about it as well he said that one of the greatest weapons given to a Believer is a committal of the thing to God to just say Lord I've done everything I can and I still don't have it I'm still not there the Situation's not worked out the money's not in the bank whatever it is and say Lord I'm just going to do exactly what your word says and trust you to sort the whole whole thing out amen but I want you to see something here as we look at this scripture here real quick well we'll stay there because in the SP in the parable the ground he says is they it's people people are the ground and you know as we look at this sometimes we can look at it and we can make it an absolute and say well brother Mark is good ground sister Moren is Rocky ground and brother Matt is shallow ground and brother Paul is the the Wayside but that's not the way that Jesus is necessarily talking here because we'll look at our lives and we'll see all sorts of areas where we may have really good ground remember you you can only take a type so far amen so I'm trying to take you here to see the bigger picture here amen not everybody that has it has Rocky ground is people that are doomed to never receive the word that people that are never going to have a real walk with God Amen people that can't stand up for the word will never stand up that's not what we're talking about church if we look through the Bible there's tons of people that looked like they had no good ground and all of a sudden they stood on the word of God and they they got exactly what they were needing Gideon was a wimp for the longest while he was hiding out threshing grain in the wine press because he was scared amen you look at Peter Peter deny Christ we're not looking for Perfection here amen Abraham kept leaving the land of promise when things got tough and he kept stepping into God's plan and making a mess of it I'm not here to say if you can't receive it or if you haven't received it you'll never receive it I'm saying each one of us has places in our life without doubt where we've got nothing we've got rocky soil we've got shallow soil and then we got places with good soil and the idea is we've got to be able to recognize those things amen so where you are today does not is not where you have to be tomorrow that's what I'm saying you don't have to say well this is where my life's at and therefore that's the way it will always be no the point is to prepare the ground so that the word can have an effecten I'm talking about making our lives a welcoming place so that when the word lands it produces itself amen that it comes forth it develops into maturity so that we take away those rocks of indifference amen and and we that shallow ground of just saying that now I lay me down to sleep prayers of casual Church attendance of putting other things before the word of God that's what builds up on the ground is the cares of life and these different things amen if we have a wonderful time at camp but we come home to a life that's shallow then guess what we're going to lose the victory because it's the day to day where your Victory is not the moment by- moment experiences amen the feeling will fall away and we're going to be disappointed every time that's the way these things work but we have to realize we're a work in progress and we have areas of our life where we are so easily surrendered to God and I would say we're mature we're in a place where God can use us God can move people can stamp all over us in that area of our life and we just take it and move on no big deal and then we've got areas of our life If we're honest where we are completely like that Wayside where there is no depth whatsoever and we need somebody to come and till that ground up amen we all have areas of strength we have areas of weakness we've got doors of Our Lives that are If we're honest are somewhat closed and doors that are wide open in God done a wonderful work and everyone can see it we've all got these areas in our life amen I might have a great prayer life and I can connect and get close to God but I might be horrible at reading my Bible some of us can worship like it's nobody's business and then the preaching comes and we can't respond to it some of us are great spouses and horrible parents I I'm using contrast here usually what we are is we're really good and not so good but in a couple areas guess what I'm horrible and those are the areas where I need him more than any and that takes a real a real honesty before the preaching of the word of God and before the studying of the word of God to see those things amen but my point is I don't want any of us any of you to look at this Parable in their own life and say oh my goodness I've got no no good ground there and I'm just doomed to never have it no that's not what we're talking about and then the the preacher comes and he brings the word and it's anointed and he starts talking about those areas of our life where the word really isn't having effect and we've got to say Lord that's me that's me and then now Lord I'm going to prepare the ground so that as I've received that word I've acknowledged it's for me I've acknowledged that I need the life that it has now I'm going to prepare the ground so that it can come out and it can produce the light the word in our lives amen we don't want to be hearers only we want to be doers as well amen the spirit of God ought to rise up in us and say hey that's what the word says I need to be what the word says and it produces something in us that calls out and that's that Abba Father spirit that says Lord make father make me just like you amen make me who my real father is and take away all these other things in Luke 8 he says that which fell among the Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to what perfection this is people that will take it 90% of the way and then Fall by the way sign areas of our life where we go almost all the way and then something will take it and it'll snatch the victory right out of our hands now we look at that scripture and we when we talk about riches and pleasures of life we'd say that's a leot toan condition that that that's the classic Le Dean right there if you go to Revelation 3 amen and and we we would look at that and say well it's talking about people people that have it all or people that think they have it all but I want you to notice it doesn't start with riches and Pleasures it says we're choked with cares that's the first great issue that we face and those cares are anxieties and worries and it's exactly the word that the scriptures use when it says casting all your care on him casting all your anxiety casting all your worry on him he says for he carth for you his careth for you is not anxiety and worry his care is a concern for our well-being so he says take your anxiety take your worries take your stresses give them to me and I'll take them on and it's a responsibility at he shoulders that's the the Key of David on his shoulder if you see that in the scripture is the responsibility for the bride's wellbeing that's his to carry church not ours to carry amen he owns the cattle on a thousand hills anden we don't have to worry about our needs he says seek ye first the kingdom of God I'll add everything else to these things to you as you have need of it I say praise the Lord to that if I'll give him the preeminence he'll take care of my cares and I was talking to somebody the other day about a situation that I know in great detail and I said if that person only knew what I know and this is a situation where I know exactly what is possible not what is possible what would happen to that person if they would only do what the word said I said they'd stop what they're doing today and they'd do what the word says and they come right into everything they've been missing out how sad it is when we let our cares drive us away from the things of God rather than hand them to him and say Lord I'll give you the preeminence in my life I'll tell you if we ever see people turning a corner church we ought to be in there just encouraging them with everything we've got we can probably look in all of our lives and see areas where we could use some help and when you see somebody making that corner get in there and encourage them really get in there and put your shoulder to the wheel and get them to turn that corner to make that decision or change that habit or that issue that they have in their life but the thing is this we can't convince them in that brother that sister I'm talking about in that situation I can't go tell them that because otherwise they're doing it because I told them rather than in response to Faith in the word they've got to do it by faith in the word otherwise somebody will convince them right out of it when things change yet again because what if they take the word in faith and it produces what it says they'll make the right decision time and time and time again because they've seen that it works but notice what he says here that this this the word comes down and it grows until fruit is produced but it doesn't come to maturity nobody likes to eat fruit that fruit that's not ripe you ever bite into a an apple or the worst are like pears and a a pear that's not ripe it might look good on the outside but you bite into it it's like eating an apple it so hard and there's no sweetness to it there's no ju to it he says this is what these people are like is the only fruit they have is not the way we want it or we need it and he says what happens they're choked and the thing about choking is that it's a slow process you go out and you pull this plant up now this is a this is a dead plant maybe not the best example it's fake but if I want to kill this plant I just have to pull it out and it's as good as dead right then because it has no nutrition it can't drink water and I just throw it in the garbage that thing is dead but choking takes time it's a slow process and when it comes to plants it's Progressive because it starts as almost nothing because that plant is growing but what happens now is a thorn comes in beside it and it starts to pull the nutrients away it starts to pull the blessings away it starts to pull pull away the resources that it needs to grow and at first The Thorn is just growing a little bit and the tree or the the plant is saying well that's no big deal but as that thorn takes more and more and it gets bigger and bigger it starts to suck every little bit of what is needed for the other plant the good plant to grow and so what happens is the plant comes up and it's so close and then it's stunted and it can't go any further and then it starts to backtrack and so choking is just the slow process of backsliding you know what choking is it's backsliding with good intentions but not feeding your life not feeding your Christian walk you know we had that service a couple years ago when that when that couple from Ontario came brother Michael and we preached on that idea that if you come to church to get a step forward you've got to keep making steps forward because otherwise every day you'll take a step back you come to church and let's say you get two steps forward you come to church on a Sunday you get two steps forward you make some real progress but if you don't make progress on Monday what happens you go back a step the prophet of God said if you're not moving forward you're backsliding so if you take those two steps but you don't make any more progress really what you're doing is on the Monday you step back once Tuesday you step back again well Wednesday you come back and you take two steps forward and guess where you are right where you were on Sunday you have made no progress so you're backsliding then what happens is we go Thursday Friday Saturday and then we come up and we take two steps on Sunday and where are we if you've done the math we're now one step behind where we were or the week before your growth cannot be only in the services you can't do it it will not work Church it doesn't work I've seen it I've experienced it you cannot do those sorts of things amen you know what happens we become Camp Overcomers that's all we are and all we're doing is brother oh I love that phrase he said this weekend he called us message leod Deans right we think we've got it because we believe it and yet we're slowly going backwards little bit by little bit message lay it a scene is a contradiction of terms backsliding Christian that's a contradiction of terms the person being choked doesn't die right away but they just slowly go back and it's just one step a week one step a week but guess what God's moving on with his word God's moving on with his bride and pretty soon you can't connect with the people you can't connect with what's coming over the pulpit you can't connect in the worship I was talking to some people and I'm saying this because I've been there you can get so distance from God that you get you get uncomfortable under the anointing of the Holy Ghost that when people are worshiping when people are praising when the word's going forth you are uncomfortable because you are so far away from the presence of God what is it you've been choked out and you're in a backslidden condition even though you know everything and we don't realize it you don't like the effect of the word you don't like your toes being stepped on you don't like being called up higher you want to stay where you are and to stay where you are is always death for the Christian walk we've got to keep moving forward and then we come to church he says we're choked out by the cares of Life what happens is we give everything we've got to our day today and then we come to church and we have nothing left to give and guess what if you got nothing to give if you've got nothing to give then you've got nothing to get you got no space left in your life you've given every aspect of what you've got in your life to your your dayto day and we come into church and then we're surprised we don't get anything again I've been there I'm speaking by experience I'm not preaching at you I'm saying this is the way it goes amen we give our energy our time our mind our strength to the cares of life and then we come to hear the word and we're so tired and beat out that we can't get anything out of it anybody ever don't raise your hands anybody ever go to bed and you've intended to pray and read your Bible and you look at the words and they just seem to just flow one into another and you just you're not getting anything out of it and then you go to pray and you might get nine words out before you're out that's not going to be an overcomer life and when we give so much to the dayto day and we leave nothing for Christ what happens we get choked out and This World brother Eugene BR I remember he says he says the devil's done a real good job of making us make bricks without straw you Brothers so many of us are on single incomes here we have to work and we've got to work and we've got to work but guess what our provision is not in our working our provision is in the god of our souls and our Salvation amen that's the rest that I have is that he said I'll take care of you he said if I would do what he wanted he'll pour out a blessing that I can contain my needs will be supplied I may not have a lot but my need needs will be supplied and I'll tell you in the end I was I was listening to what brother B was talking about he said you know if I had $100 million here he says what would I pay what would I buy with that $100 million he said I'd like to meet see my dad again I'd like to see this one he said I'd like to see another Soul saved he says what does that tell us about what that money is really worth if all it takes us back to is the Salvation or the Eternal destination of another person that we love amen we can get so caught up in what we have to have that we forget there's only one Pearl a great price and that's Christ himself Amen brother Bram says this he he's praying he says oh Eternal God in the quietness of this worship now after the message has gone forth do not let these seeds of Thy word Lord fall upon Stony ground do not let the message Lord fall in briers and Thorns that the cares of this life and he says like lot might choke it out at the end and become a Castaway he says but oh blessed God let it fall on good fertile grounds on penitent hearts and I M also Lord that we might all look through God's glass of looking and see the rejected Church of the Lord Jesus the rejected people the rejected way and then he says and may we walk in this glorious way the rejected way the harder way because you have chosen the harder way amen he says this is he says it's like lot what was lot's problem church he saw the well-watered plains of Sodom having walk through the desert for way too long and he saw all the struggles and he saw all the trials of doing things the way God told you to do it and he came out and he says that place is going to make it really easy to get and hold on to wealth and he made that choice and you know what his choice was limited and Abraham comes out and God comes to abrah he says look around he says everything you see here belongs to you every bit of it belongs to you lot missed out because he went the easy way rather than the word way amen the desert was a whole lot more work for him it's a lot harder to feed sheep and goats and cattle in the desert but he looks down at sodom's wellwater Plains and he doesn't have to go very far to hold on to everything that he's ever built up amen he saw the opportunities he saw the comforts of Sodom he saw the conditions of the environment there and he says I can do that and he loved Easy Living more than the word of God he loved the opportunities more than the word of God and the scripture you remember it says it vexed lot's righteous soul to be in Sodom and yet he could never leave as much as he hated where he was yet the draw what happened it choked out his desire to be separate until he got to the place where he became a big shot in the city of of Sodom and he sat in the city gate and he actually entered into the very system that vexed his soul and he served the citizens of that City it got to the place he couldn't get himself out and it took an Angelic visitation for him to even save his life and those of his two daughters but who paid the price his wife had gone too far and even though an angel told her don't look back she couldn't take the word serious and she turned back thinking it wouldn't do anything to her and she died and was turned into a pillar of salt right then and there church it gets serious when we get to the place where we say the word doesn't matter we'll never say it but our life will say it amen you say brother John are you saying this this has seemed a little hard tonight we're getting to the good part but we've got to see the traps and the pitfalls so that we can be the good part amen we've got to be where we want to be amen I'm helping saying this to hopefully help you hold on to what you've gotten over this weekend that you can keep your Victory so you can grow in God so you can experience more of him and not just at church not just at camp but in your daytoday life amen that it's not just a a camp we're not just Camp Christians or Camp Overcomers but we've got a day-by-day experience that feeds us into the word and its effects amen now we get to the good part he says but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart honesty sometimes that means we aren't as good as we think we are sometimes it means we have to say I need more or I don't have or I'm in lack the good ground is not a life that's perfect it's a life that is ready to receive amen he says having heard the word they keep it and bring forth fruit with what patience patience is the trial of our faith remember the time between the promise and the Harvest that's the trial of our faith there's a time of waiting and remember now this is where we wanted to get tonight there was always an Abraham in contrast to lot remember this is a law of contrast we've got lot in there and he's getting choked out by the cares and the riches of this world and Abraham is outside of Sodom completely separate Abraham's not perfect but he's in a place where God can meet him amen that's what matters you're in a place where God can meet him that's what good ground is is a place where God can meet you a place where God can plant the word and it's clearing out all the obstacles and all the things that build up and all of the things that hold us back and throwing it aside and saying Lord I'm ready to meet you I'm ready to receive the promise we're speaking on good ground tonight and I'm not saying you have to have a perfect life I'm saying the good ground is people that have cleared out and prepared their lives for the word of God we get to choose that that's our day today you know I just for the sake of time I didn't put it in my notes brother B remember he talks about that Lake that was going through a storm and it was all whipped up and he said that lake is going through a Revival and the guy looked at him a Revival he says yeah he says do you notice what a Revival is and what it does he says what a Revival does is it clears out all the trash he says but there's not a little there's not even a little bit more rain and water in that Lake than there was before that came he says and what does it takes it takes a Pentecostal wind it takes a moving of the spirit it takes the word coming forth and stirring up what's there to get the trash out and clean the water up he says and that's what a Revival is you don't have any more than what you had before but what does it do it brings to life that which was already there there seeds planted we've got the Eternal SE Gene of God in our hearts but it takes a Revival sometimes to bring those things out and get all of that stuff out of our Lives brother Brown puts it this way he says any seed has to have its ground of course now he takes us back to scripture therefore all he fornew he did predestinate them he did predestinate he justified Sanctified glorified we've read this in many services he says see he already knew what was going to happen see Jesus said again about the seed some fell on rocks others in mixed grounds see over where there's Thorns thistles and everything else it couldn't grow he says but and others on good ground good ground good soil which have been already prepared Hallelujah Church what I'm saying is when the word comes forth he's not sewing it for the Thorns he's not sewing it for the thistles he's not sewing it for the rocky ground he's not swing it for the shallow ground but he's sowing it because he knows there's good ground to receive it amen we don't have services like we have because we don't have good ground we receive services like that because there is good ground there's a people that's there to receive that word and it's going to come forth and it's going to produce what he promised amen that's what I wanted to get to you tonight we have those Services because there's good ground but let's also see if we've got some places where the ground wasn't quite ready and we backed away but he's always got a place prepared remember he says when I send my word out it can't come back to me void there's always a place for the seed of the word to produce what it says it's going to do amen he knows Above All Things there's always good ground to receive it it's like the scripture talks about the parable he says it's like the the net that's cast out and and it's the gospel it brings out a lot of fishes but there's only one fish in there that they want and the rest get thrown away and that's the way the gospel goes there's always a witness we read before that God always has somebody that's going to receive it amen God didn't send it because no one would receive it God sent it so that some because he knew somebody would receive it amen God sent it because people were ready people were prayed up people were were willing people were anticipating people had set their lives aside to say God come down and preach to us come down and teach us come down and help us come down and Deliver us that's why these things happen amen God always has good ground available amen and that's why he's sewing is solely for the good ground church you enjoyed it because you had good ground you received it because you have good ground you received it because your heart was open you received it because you were sincere in your prayers you received it because you had put the time in beforehand to prepare your hearts and your lives for it amen and let me help the rest of us out you didn't get it because you were so good you got it because he ordained you to get it Hallelujah that even when I'm not ready he comes by in His Marvelous Grace and he says Hey here I am and by God's grace I'm able to open up and I'm able to receive that word even if I haven't maybe done the job that I thought I should have done listen Rahab didn't know she was good ground until the word came her way the woman at the well didn't look like a piece of good ground to the rest of us but when the word in flesh came her way she realized guess what I can receive this and it produced an immediate result in her life and it stuck and I believe she was one of the ones that got the Holy Ghost in Samaria when Peter and John came over not too many days later amen he sends it because there's a people that's willing to receive it the disciples were nobody they were ignorant they were unlearned they weren't chosen by the other rabbis and teachers and looking at them we'd say that's not good ground but God knows his own and the word comes to the word amen praise the Lord what makes that ground good or what makes it shallow Church there's only one thing makes good ground and that's surrender to the word of God that is the only thing that'll do it Doctrine doesn't make it good surrender makes it good because surrender gets all the rocks out it gets all the sticky things out it gets the things that hold us back those things that hinder our walk with Christ it's the little SP foxes that are spoiling The Vines it's that surrender that says Lord I'm going to take those and I'm going to lay them aside because I believe what you have for me is way better than what I get out of those different things that's the only way the word can be effective is if it has full and Total Control in the ground otherwise things will come in it has to be sowed in faith it has to be received in faith it has to have faith in patience and then you get to harvest it in faith amen faith is a revelation that the word of God is true for me your faith is a revelation that the word of God is true for you and that's how we receive it that's how we get our lives cleaned up and that's how we can commit our situations our finances our jobs our spouses our families our ministry whatever it is to God and say God I'm just going to let it come forth in my life brother B puts it this way he says see you must first let the word fall in the right type of faith and then that Faith produces what the word said because the word is a seed the word of God right here is a seed that a swer SWS and every seed will produce produce its kind period no he says every seed will produce its kind if it's put in the right atmosphere and the right condition church can I get to what I'm trying to get at when you have meetings like we have so many times you know what it is it's actually a planting it's a planting it's a start it's a new portion of the word coming out in your life and it has all the feelings that come with planting you know it takes a certain atmosphere to conceive life doesn't it it takes a different atmosphere to produce that life into a baby and then it takes another different atmosphere to keep that baby alive and grow it into maturity and it's no different with the word of God it takes an atmosphere to plant it to get it to start growing to Quicken it to make it burst forth but it takes a continuation of the right environment for that word to now come forth in our lives in other words you have to feed your experience you have to feed that plant you know we so many of us I think in in elementary school we all given a little what was it a bean I think it was a bean wasn't it just a little bean and every one of us we had to take it and the first thing we did was we put it in a damp uh paper towel and every day we go and we just put a bit of water on that b damp paper towel and pretty soon we lay it in the window so that it had the the heat in the sun then after a while we'd look underneath it what would we see we'd see that that little bean had Little Sprouts coming out of it little roots and it was starting to rot and then we take it and we put it into what we transplant it now it just needed the watering of the word at first but now it needs more it needs soil it needs nutrition it needs all these other things and so we put it in there and for a while we wouldn't see anything but then after a while some come in they say hey mine's come up through the dirt and everything we' done to that point with no evidence that it was continuing to grow yet all of a sudden it popped up and we were always so envious of that person that got the the bean that came through first but guess what that wasn't the Harvest that was just hey it's working and we never unfortunately got to take it all the way to a bean Harvest but if you were growing beans then you'd let that whole thing grow until you produced beans and you'd you you'd manage the conditions you'd manage the environment and that's what we have to do with these things amen it the the the planting is where all the good feelings are but the producing life is where the real hard work starts setting the atmosphere setting the conditions amen and it's a whole different work the fun is always at the beginning and the work comes after that we'll find out so you have to have the right atmosphere you have to have the right conditions for growth of what was planted yes it has to be good ground but that good ground needs to be inside of a good environment you've got to water it with the word of God you can't get away from that you've got to warm it with the presence of God you've got to feed it with praise and worship and prayer you've got to encourage it with thoughts that are in line with the word of God Amen you've got to protect it from weeds and Thorns you know scripture says if anything offend your eye pluck it if if your eye offend the pluck it out in other words if you've got something and sometimes again I speak this by experience we'll go around and around the mountain right we think we got the victory in the and we don't we think we got the Victory and we don't and what happens is we're not realizing there's something there that we're not we're not addressing and that's the Thorns that's the Briars that catch on to these things and so what we've got to do is we've got to see what's hindering us now what was it that's hindered me before so many times we will go in and we want a victory and then we come out and we haven't addressed the thing that was causing us to have defeat in the first place you've got to address the thing that's defeating you so that the victory can come forth and produce full maturity so it can be the real deal in your life you got to go strengthen yourself in other words this is my go-to scripture after camps I think I do it every year but if we go to the book of First Kings 20 amen because Satan's going to come if he hasn't already he's coming you can't have a weekend like we had and Satan take it lying down he's going to be coming for each and every one of us to take our peace to take our joy to take our Victory to try and kill kill that experience before it comes into a fullness of in our life but remember what happened here in First Kings 20 it says says the king of Israel went out and smokee the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great Slaughter in other words they had a camp meeting and they had worship and praise and they had Victory and they had shouting they had dancing and everyone was clapping their hands and it was a wonderful time in the Lord but Watch What Happens and the prophet came to the king of Israel and said unto him you got it no he said go strengthen thyself and Mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee in other words he says yes you've won but he's coming again and you've got to get ready for the next attack you've got the victory but he ain't dead yet Satan ain't dead yet Church we're not going to have a total victory until we get out of here and that means we're going to battle every single day of our life until we go into a resurrection or a Rapture but I want you to see what that that underlined portion of the Amplified in the Amplified says go fortify yourself and become strong and give attention to what you must do so if they went out and they fought maybe they lost men they've got to recruit and train more men maybe they lost weapons maybe they they lost horses maybe they they had areas of their their army that got destroyed in part he says you got to go back and rebuild you got to prepare because he's going to come back again and you've got to be ready for it Satan's not going to leave you alone but B puts it this way he says you take good grains and put it in good ground on the right condition it'll bring forth a h hundredfold so is the word of God when it's brought into the human heart with a faith undying faith in the Lord Jesus Christ he says with the Holy Spirit and the power of God there to water it it'll germatize that's what's happened for many of us some of us got a harvest this weekend but I think many of us also just got a planting and I don't say just a planting I mean you got a planting there's nothing small about it it's a wonderful thing amen but he says now you need the Holy Spirit the power of God there to do what to water it so it'll germatize and bring forth everything it said it would do he says it's a word it's God's word now I'm a broken record on this but the prophet of God would say you want to get close to God what do you do go ahead sister Justine read your Bible and pray you don't do it you ain't going to win you may not have to listen you don't have to read your Bible brother Chad you can listen to your Bible you can listen to preaching you can listen to messages you don't have to read it you can listen to it but somehow someway you've got to get a delivery system so the word can come into this body and we can't sit here on our excuses of we don't have time we don't have energy listen if we don't have time for that we're not going to have time for a Rapture it's a simple truth you can pick them now or you can pick them later and listen I don't want to go to the white Throne judgment I'd rather get the victory now I'd rather set these things aside now and take the pain that maybe comes with choosing God over those other things because it's going to have an eternal effect on me rather than just a temporary pain in the of these things that we see amen this is about communion with God it's about raising up the standard of the Holy Spirit saying I need to do more we're not here for performance but for goodness sake we've got to be able to water that experience with the word of God we've got to be able to get in his presence so that the warmth of his presence draws the life out amen it's about feeding the experience so that the experience becomes a reality so that sticks around remember what those those ones that were choked out the fruit came but it couldn't come to Perfection amen I want to come to Perfection I want to come to maturity this evening amen we don't want to presume we don't ever want to presume brother Braham says this let's be the hund folds you know it says some produce 30 some produce 60 and some produced a hundredfold he says let's be the hund folds let's go way over that's what passion does that's what Fanatics do we're supposed to be Fanatics for the word of of God it's amazing anytime I've been at a sporting event the Fanatics you see yeah I remember seeing the Oilers going to the Oilers hockey game and you have o i l e r s you have six chubby hairy men with no shirts on with an O an i an L an e an r and an S and they've got their faces painted and they've got hockey helmets on brother B saying let's go way over let's be that kind of crazy for the things of God you you sing that song I am a c I am a c I am a c r i i n we need to be a fanatic we need to be fanatical about the things of God that's where we need to be fanatical amen you know if if if an Oilers if that man walked in from that Oilers game into our church you know what he'd say you guys are Jesus fans that's what he'd say isn't it he'd see brother Chad yelling he'd say now that guy he's a fanatic he'd see brother Grant there with his arms up shouting he'd say That's my kind of fanatic he'd see sister shaking their hands and praising the Lord he'd say That's my kind of fanatic hey how about you guys come to the Oilers game with me but the thing is in the moment everybody's a fanatic but you'll find with the Oilers Lots lot of people have fallen away why because they don't win they can't win but these guys are die hards that's what Christ is looking for die hards they have sold out to the things of God he says let's go way over sell out everything from the world and look to Christ and believe him with all our hearts he says that's how these things happen brother Aaron talked about a total Victory you know what that requires Church a total sellout he says that's how Visions come that's how the power of God moves among us no roots of bitterness everything's cleared out cleaned out and the Holy Spirit can work through us he says then we become a channel let me finish with one scripture and a set of quotes here this evening you want to set the right atmosphere how many want the right atmosphere in their life most of us you want to set the right atmosphere guard your thoughts remember we preached on this now we know it the battle is right here the atmosphere is set right here whoever wins here sets the atmosphere amen so you've got to guard your thoughts you got to guard what's what you're dwelling on and then the Holy Spirit doesn't doesn't have a negative thought as it relates to the word amen so that means get ready for the negative thoughts get ready for the unbelieving thoughts get ready for the critical thoughts get ready for the worrisome thoughts get ready for the unsure thoughts and when they do say Satan you're identified I loved what brother Aaron said he says Satan always lies and yet we keep listening to him and let me say this church if it's contrary to this word there's only one influence behind it and it's satanic amen we ought to know when it hits us but you know when it hits us church when the feeling's gone isn't it when the feeling of Victory when the feeling of healing when the feeling of Deliverance when the feeling of knowing you're saved is gone that's when it hits us and that's when we're at our weakest guard your thoughts you know the scripture I'm going to go to but I'm going to read it anyways as we start to close Paul said finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue he says if there's any strength if there be any praise he says Get It by thinking on these things church let me say this I found the easiest way to get out of my head is to let the word of God flow over it and if I can't read and I can't listen to it put a song on put some good music on put a service on if I can't get there myself then put on something that'll take me into that listen anointed singing took Saul out from under the influence of an evil spirit if it can do that temporarily for a son for for a son that's lost the anointing then what ought it to do to Holy Ghost filled children of God Amen set yourself up if you know that you're prone to thinking negatively if you know that you're prone to to losing That Loving Feeling set yourself up you know the easiest thing to do if you're if you if you're trying to get ahead is make a plan for when the failure tries to come in make a plan for when you are going to be weak if you're struggling to lose weight you know what you do you have a snack ready that is good for you so you don't have to go to the big the chip bag right if you know that your struggle is in these things then set yourself up and say I've got a song ready to play I've got a message ready to play I've got a service ready to play I've got a person ready to speed dial and get there and say Satan not today and you go right to that thing that's anointed and watch what it'll do in your life it'll pull you right out of those things amen but there's only one thing that's true there's only one thing that's honest there's only one thing that's pure and it's the word so it's got to be the word that you go back to it's got to be an anointed word to pull you out of these things cuz church I'll tell you Satan is going to come hard after the week weekend we had I'm not doing that to get you down I'm doing that to get you ready prepare for battle amen he wants to take back every bit of ground that we took this weekend he wants to take your experience he wants to take your joy he wants to take your peace he wants to take every little bit of it away and he is going to come hard for it and the only way you're going to hold it is you get back behind that umbrella that God gave Adam and Eve at the beginning and that's his word and you say Lord I'm going to stay right here and I'm going to confess it I'm going to speak it I'm going to sing it I'm going to pray it I'm going to put it on my lips day in and day out and push those things aside amen two quotes and we'll close brother Bram takes us through the whole in just a short thing now he takes us through the effect of belief he says now when you believed you were saved sitting in your seat wherever you were you accepted it and began to confess and tell people you were saved confession goes a long ways a testimony goes a long ways church if God did something for you this weekend go tell somebody about it it'll help anchor that thing he says now he says well you kept on saying I'm saved the people said there isn't no difference in you now catch you're saying one thing and everybody else is saying a different thing cuz they can only see what they can see but you know what's been done in your life so you're confessing based on what you've received they're confessing based on what they see and guess what the two don't always match up immediately he says but you he says they said there's no difference in you but what did you do but you believe there was he says is that right and you kept with your confession that's our part stick with your confession he says and immediately it worked righteousness does anybody see what I said what he said there he did not say that he said and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness in other words your confession came out and was visible to everybody else he says then all your neighbors and everybody knows you're saved now why because you believed it and you confessed it remember scripture says out of the ab abundance of the heart the mouth the mouth speaketh if you've receiv received something in your heart if youve received something in your soul confess it but notice there what happened amen is that the work was done but it took a while to come out life was quickened the word was quickened but it took a while for everybody to realize hey he's different wow she really is saved catch what he says now he says why what happened what changed you it says he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father making good what you're confessing scripture says whatsoever things are good he said now that's the same thing it is by healing you accept him as your healing and what do you do renounce your feelings God help us to renounce our feelings he says it's not by feelings it's by faith say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of health will not fail hallelujah amen let's stand together if we would you may not have asked for healing this weekend you may not be praying for healing you may be praying for somebody's salvation you may be pray be praying for provision you may be praying for a spouse you may be praying for direction you may be praying for a loved one that's in a serious need and you may have been praying for healing he says what say it believe it act it and associate with those that believe the very same thing you're confessing we need each other amen my feelings may give out but guess what you may be the strength that I need in these times and I might be the same thing for you amen he says it will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of Health it'll bring you to exactly what God promised he says it will not fail amen isn't God good amen he who started the work will be faithful to complete it in you amen hold your confession Church feed your experience be around people that believe the same things you do and don't like let a Negative Nancy come in and try and tear it away from you Abraham called those things that were as though they were not and those things that were not as though they were that's what believers do and we take these moments we take those you know Camp a lot of times what what camp and special meetings are is you get to do eight or 10 steps in a row you really get to jump ahead and there's real growth and there's real opportunity but now we got to fight to hold on to those steps amen and that's a day-by-day work that we choose to do it's not a magic pill amen we've got to fight scripture says that the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force we've got to be as violent with the things that Satan throws at us as he tries to be with us Amen to be as so so focused and particular about what about what we're kicking out as we are about what we're allowing in to make sure that ground is ready it's prepared and that there's a right environment for the word of God to grow in our lives amen amen God bless you each one let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we are thankful for what you've done Lord but we are excited for what you're doing Lord and we are looking forward to what you're about to do Lord and we know there's a process here we know there's a cycle but Lord we don't ever want to get so down in what's coming that we don't rejoice in what we have right now and so Lord I say thank you Lord I worship you I Praise You Lord I give you all the glory the honor and the praise for your goodness to this people tonight heavenly father but Lord I'm praying that you'll give us strength Lord that you will raise up the standard of your Holy Spirit In Our Lives Lord that we would take strength from it Lord that we would get an unction from it Lord that it would cause us to push out every little sin and every little thing that easily besets us Lord that we would set our minds on you and on your word Lord that we would feed ourselves with the bread of eternal life that we would wash our lives with the water of the word Lord that we would dwell in your presence Lord then the quickening power of your Holy Spirit would bring these things to a maturity to a perfection in our lives Lord I Thank you for answered prayer Lord I Thank you for deliverance I thank you for healing I thank you for refreshing Lord I Thank you for direction I thank you forc encouragement Lord I pray that you'd help us to hold on to these things to go
