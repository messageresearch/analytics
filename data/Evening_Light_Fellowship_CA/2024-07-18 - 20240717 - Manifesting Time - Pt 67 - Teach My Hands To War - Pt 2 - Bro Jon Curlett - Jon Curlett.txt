Let the Peace of passes all I understand Cover Me cover for me Lord how fitting this is this evening Lord as we come to your word Lord that we recognize that the only place of peace and rest is at your feet Lord Lord and only this morning Lord I read in the Book of Ruth where she came to the feet of Boaz and she said cover me because Thou Art my near Kinsman that I need something from you and Lord your bride is gathered at your feet this evening Heavenly Father Lord because she has a need Lord she has a need to be clothed and wrapped in your righteousness Lord that your love would so surround and fill her heavenly father that it would drive out every fear every doubt every bit of unrest Heavenly Father Lord that Faith would rise up within us Lord to lay hold of your word this evening so Lord I pray that we would lay at your feet Lord that we would draw ever closer to you this evening Lord and as we even go out this night Lord may we draw closer to you day by day Lord that we would find the peace and rest Lord that love that Lord that that gives us Lord the overcoming power in every battle that we Face Lord we ask your grace to be with us tonight Lord we thank you for your many blessings Lord thank you for answered prayer thank you for healing thank you for deliverance Lord thank you for leadership Lord thank you because the answer is on the way Lord thank you for our finished work in Calvary Lord we just pray our lives would ref Ed this evening each one Lord we ask you to bless your word now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Psalms chapter 18 Psalms chapter 18 it's good to be in the house of the Lord again this evening amen just trust him we've come in expecting amen amen I know brother Chad's out in Central and just praying God to give them traveling mercies they should be back on tues or on uh on Sunday and then brother Jim and the doues and the briners are back in Sweet Bay but hopefully we'll see them also on Sunday so God's grace to them each one amen Psalms chapter 18 I want to read this Psalm but I want you to focus on what's Happening here because I want you to see where the starting point is and where the finishing point is and and who starts it and who finishes it and who's fighting and who's winning and who's doing a work and who's getting a work because so often we want to put the the pressure on ourselves we want to put the focus on ourselves but you'll see that's not the way the scripture works amen it puts the it it puts the Focus right where it needs to be amen and it shows us who's the Difference Maker so let's read Psalms 18 and: 31 it says for who is God save the Lord and who is a rock Save Our God it is God that GTH me with strength and maketh my way perfect he maketh my feet like hindes feet and sth me upon my high places he teacheth My Hands to War so that a bow of Steel is broken in my arms he's the one that gives us the strength he's the one that that makes us able to even fight in the first place amen he's the one that turns us into Warriors of the faith it's his working that makes us who we are David continues he says Thou Hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath Holden me up and thy gentleness ha made me great he says Thou Hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet do not slip it's his free gift of Salvation it's his right hand it's his gentleness his patient love loving care that keeps us from falling down amen it the results are because of his work not because of ours but watch watch the results of all of this now we've heard it is God and he and he and thou and thy now watch what happens in verse 37 now David says I have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did I turn again till they were consumed that's our job don't stop don't stop till it's over he says I have wounded them that they were not able ble to rise they are Fallen under my feet total Victory total deliverance and me David's won the war and David says I did it and it seems like maybe we've had a part in it but then David comes right back around in verse 39 he says for thou Hast girded Me with strength under the battle thou Hast subdued under me those that rose up against me thou also Hast given me the necks of mine enemies that I might destroy them that hate me and read even verse 41 and 42 it says they cried but there was none to save them even unto the Lord but he answered them not then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening what an encouraging scripture to start our our service this evening and we're going to take another service on on manifesting time and I want to take another service on this subtitle of teach My Hands to War and the more I study the more the notes keep piling up so we've got at least two more services after this but certainly there's a very special message coming on Sunday I believe that the Lord's just been dealing with me on for quite some time so keep that in prayer but I want us to go back and just by by way of quick review this this evening we talked last service about Canaan was a type of the Holy Ghost and that our battle is to come into the Holy Ghost and then we saw it was a battle to get there and it was a battle to cross over then it was a battle to overcome and then it was a battle to hold on to the land amen it was a battle from start to finish now we know it was a type and Shadow so it's not perfect because we know you can't lose the Holy Ghost once you get it cuz God doesn't make mistakes amen the Holy Ghost is a seal to the day of your Redemption it's the earnest of our salvation and our Redemption Jesus said I won't lose one that the father's given me when he gives you the Holy Ghost it's a seal it's a finished work of your soul and you cannot lose it amen God's work is perfect and that that Holy Spirit is just a confirmation of who you always were amen that you are in Christ that you are in God in the very beginning and it's not a confirmation of your Christian performance it's not a confirmation of your family it's not a confirmation of your pastor it's not a a confirmation of your pedigree it's a confirmation that you are in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world Amen so he gives you that as a seal but here's the thing we can absolutely step out from under the blessings of the Holy Ghost you don't lose the Holy Ghost but you can absolutely lose the blessings because you choose to go away of your own thinking and your your own making amen but we spoke last service about the Battle for our day and that Battlegrounds in our minds and we tend to think because we are natural creatures so often it seems that our battle is natural and so our five senses want to rear up and we want to fight by those outer five senses by what we taste and feel and and hear and smell and all these different things or or we let the the next five senses of the inner person come in and the emotions and the memory and the affections and these different things but that is not the reality of the situations that we're facing anden we go in and we Face difficult people we Face rough people rough times and and things seem to be just going so difficult and we want to get riled up in this flesh and fight in this flesh but Paul would tell us you've missed the Mark when you think that you're fighting against flesh and blood amen you're not fighting people you're not fighting situations you're fighting a spiritual warfare and the battle is always up here first and foremost amen if we go to Ephesians 6 then Paul would say this we want to understand our situations our battles he says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might the key is not to be strong the key is to be close to God Amen stay close to him unify with Christ that's where our strength is he says Now put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil that means it's not going to be obvious that what comes first to your mind is probably not right in terms of what you're really facing what's really going on it's tricks it's it's obscure it's hidden it's not obvious what Satan's trying to do so many times and Paul continues he says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world that is not people that is Spirits that's satanic influences he says and it's against spiritual wickedness in high places so this is our battle it is not natural but the thing is because we see naturally that's what we want to dwell on what we see with natural eyes are just where levers are being pulled in the spiritual realm and you've got God on one side and you've got Satan and his demons on the other and God's pulling his levers and Satan's pulling his and the battle is completely outside of anything that we can see unless God opens our eyes amen we're fighting a spiritual warfare against an influence we are not fighting politics we're not fighting racism we're not fighting people we're not fighting the economy we're not fighting governments or any of these things we are fighting Spirits every every single time we're not even fighting disease we're fighting Spirits all of what we Face are spirits amen now notice now in verse 10 because we're speaking on train My Hands to War and we see that we've got to fight and win there's an element of us that's in there but the key of this that we've got to catch is that our strength is in the Lord amen our strength is in him and the power that we have is in his might not in my own amen we all think we're so so strong so many times we're 10t tall and Bulletproof proof and then the trials hit and we're cowered down behind the wall screaming medic medic or help or mommy Mommy come on let's be honest sometimes the faith is great until the bullet whizzes past your head until sickness hit until the bank account starts dwindling down to zero but we see that if our focus is to be strong in the Lord then that ought to be where we're going is getting close to him not building up ourselves but building our relationship with him day by day because that's the one that's going to hold us remember what they said to brother Bram he you know after his wife and daughter died he said did your religion hold you he said or he said did did you hold on to your religion he said no My Religion held on to me there's something inside of us that's holding us in the battle that's giving us strength even when we don't think we can go on and that's the strength of the lord it's the relationship it's the power of the holy spirit inside each and every one of us remember what John says he says ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater are you than he that is in the world said no Bible scripture ever it says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world this is not just a salvational scripture this is for the Holy Ghost filled true son and daughter of God this is for children of God that have been baptized that have been sealed this is not for just people that are walking with God these are people that are tabernacling deity day by day that's what this is about amen this is for those that have God on the inside of them not just a casual relationship or when times of need come but it's the people that walk with him day by day by day amen and then when you realize Christ Is In You by the Holy Spirit that's when you recognize that you can win that you've got a victory inside of you amen our first battle the foremost battle is to recognize who wins this battle and it ain't me it's the one that's inside of me brother R would say this he had such a way of doing this he says just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleeve hole you see he's just up and down and over and everything else we only have one little baby here right now but and they get pretty good at it pretty quick but if you tell a baby to put his arms in his sleeves or he thinks you're trying to do it what does he do his arms are just all over the place and all you're trying to do is get him to sit still cuz his arm is going everywhere except the whole for the sleep he says see you you he's just up and down and everything else he says see he can't do it put on your coat honey he can't do it little arm is up and down around it takes your Steady Hand he says oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to father and say Lord Jesus I can't get in there you help me put the coat on me he says I quit trying just let him do it how do I train my hand for War I put it in his hand I let him guide my hand I let him guide my life he said if the little baby B keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it and he's just everywhere he can't do it and we say that's obvious brother John and then he says neither can you neither can I the prophet of the age the seventh Church age messenger the restorer of the faith he says neither can I but if we'll just hold still and let him do it just yield to him and say here Lord here I am just let me be nothing I yield you put my hand in the right place he says that's the victory that's overcoming the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcame for you he knows the way we don't like I said we can build ourselves up so easily many times I'm a mature believer I've been serving him for 20 30 40 maybe even 50 years I know what I'm doing 10t tall and bulletproof but there comes a time where you're going to face something you haven't done before and you don't know what to do and you've got to be able to say I don't know but I know a God I have a God that knows exactly what to do in this situation amen so many times even as a new pastor I feel like I'm Flying Blind because I've not done many of these things before there's no way to get experience outside of experience and the only way I know is to say father I don't know what to do I don't know what to do will you help me and usually he does if I'll just stand still and give him a little bit of time amen amen our battle is is to have courage to stand and let him do the work when everything is whizzing around us when when chaos when sickness whatever it might be is pressing in to just stand still and say God I'm in your hands amen all we've been asked to do is believe and stand on that word amen we don't have to bring down Thunder we don't have to call down angels from the Skies of heaven we just have to say Lord I'm trusting your word and I'm going to stand there and I'm going to stay there amen we have to be confident in our position to know that what I'm doing to know where I'm standing to know what I'm trying to achieve is in his will because he's called me to do it and when we come to that place we've got full confidence that he's going to answer us Amen brother B puts it this way because he said remember greater is he that's in you that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says you've at least got the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have the Holy Ghost this morning listen he says this whole group here you raised your hands what's that the greatest weapon you can put in your hands with the word of God behind to back it up you got the Holy Ghost and the word is behind it we'll do a quote later where he says where you got the word and then the Holy Ghost behind it that's the greatest weapon you've got is the Bible in your hands and the Holy Ghost to back it up what does that look like oh people say oh that's power brother that's a spoken word brother yes I believe it is but remember we are only vessels what matters is not the vessel what matters is what's in the vessel in this case amen and so yes it's power yes it's speaking the word but remember the bride will have thus sayeth the Lord or she'll stay silent we'll find his will or we'll be quiet until we find it and we'll be at rest in the waiting amen what matters is not me what matters is inside of me that's the thing that I'm trusting in these things amen I'm just trying to stay out of his way try not to inject my thoughts my ideas the way I think it should be done I'm trying to just let him do his job and just keep me as much out of it amen you know if I could be honest I found and preach the harder I try the worse I do if I come into a service and I've got an intention if I'm trying to get a response out of the people if I'm trying to get Brother David to do a Jericho merch guess what brother David's never going to do a Jericho March because I come in and say that I want him to do it if I want to use my discernment right what happens nothing intellectual stimulation at at best that's it that is all you're going to get out of it that's all that's going to come because what is it it's me trying to use him rather than him trying to use me and it doesn't work that way that is always a failure because how can a man wield God that's not the way it works I've got to get out of the way and say Lord what would you have what would you have me to say and in the Simplicity of that Faith he works time and time and time again and I usually have no clue what he's doing I don't I'm just preaching by faith because of what he's laid on my heart amen otherwise people are just going to get head knowledge and that leads us to religion rather than the Holy Ghost it's no good for us remember we would talk about perfect strength through perfect perfect weakness brother Brown would preach a whole message on that we're going to talk about that a little bit more a lot more on Sunday Lord willing amen but we've got to realize sometimes we we we look at at other believers that are stronger we look at Believers we admire where they are and we think well they've got it easier because they're stronger because they're more gifted and let me put it to you this way the ones that are strongest often struggle the most because they've got a struggle to get out of out of his way the most gifted have to get out of the way and it's a lot harder to get out of the way when you think you bring something to the table that's what Paul had to do Paul came with great gifts great knowledge years and years of training he was the best of the best and he said until I counted it as dung he couldn't do anything with me your strength is not what's going to make you great in the Kingdom your gifts are not what's going to make you great in the Kingdom it's how small you can make yourself brother brandom said how small you can make yourself in these sort of things amen people that are strong they struggle to surrender and it hinders them more than it helps them because they're trying to do it themselves brother B would tell this story about brother Paul Raider who is a missionary over in Africa if you remember remember he got Blackwater fever over there and with Blackwater fever the way brother brandom tells it is you would go into a coma and you would die and he got it and he went into a coma and he wasn't expected to survive and he tells his story and I just wanted to share it this evening to help us out because we can think we're so strong or we think we because we're not strong that we can't get anywhere but listen to this he said he was dreaming he was back up in Oregon again and that was his home where he used to chop the trees he was a very strong man his boss one time told him he was dreaming he said go up on the mountain Paul and cut me a certain sized log and bring it down he said all right boss he ran up the hillside with the spring of Youth in His Feet Again in his dream when he was unconscious and he said he fell the tree right easy he said he could feel the ax as it went down through the soft organ fur and the tree dropped and he trimmed it up like that stuck his ax into the tree and tried to pick it up everything went smoothly he ran up with the with with the feet of Youth he he had the Speed he had the stamina chopped the tree down no problem trimmed it out thunk put his ax into the tree and tried to lift it he says and he said his strength was gone from him he said he done everything he could to pick it up he said well my strength's completely gone brother R says maybe that's where you are tonight your strength completely gone the hope is gone everything's gone he said he toiled and he said well I ought to be able to lift this I ought to be able to pick this up' why I picked them up like this before he says maybe you've been healed before maybe you've been through prayer lines and you've been healed but this time you just can't simply muster enough Faith to get it up the load somehow what you used to be able to do you can't do anymore you got healed before now you don't have faith to get healed maybe you've lost your joy maybe your peace maybe you've lost your worship maybe your trust you had something before and it was a strength for you and now you come to do something you've done so many times before and it doesn't happen and we think we've dropped off we've Fallen back we backslid and we failed we're no good he says he just got completely worn out I know what this is like working on Rusty vehicles in New Finland where I have gone out to do a simple break rotor change on on my car and spent 3 hours trying to get a brake rotor off to the point where I wanted to cry beating on it with the heaviest hammers I've got impact this driver that everything I can do to beat that thing off and it won't move and it should be so simple I've done it many times before and it won't move and you just want to sit there and cry and you know what I've learned pray before you work on cars and new fin L because inevitably after I pray it comes off but I think it's just God teaching me that listen I care about everything you do and I'm in there to help you in everything you do see I don't think I need him to change a break rotor but I do in new fin land I do and so Paul Raider sitting there and he's completely warning out trying to move something that he's always been able to move trying to do something he ought to be able to do he says so he just sat down ducked his head down and started crying said I'm so weak I can't move I've lost my strength and I don't know what I'll do he said he heard the voice of his boss so gentle and kind he said Paul what's the matter he said boss I just haven't got the strength to pick it up I just simply can't get it down there there he says Paul you're just doing it in vain you're just tussling in vain but Lord you said I should be able to do it you told me to do it your word tells me I'm supposed to be able to do it and then he said Paul don't you see that stream down over there he says that stream runs right by the camp said why don't you just push it over in the water and jump on and write it down there's always a way provided see Paul Raider was thinking I've got to do it the way I've always done it but there was always a way he could have done it and he'd never found it because he was relying on his strength now he's come to a place where his strengths run out and this voice says why don't you try it the way I've provided now the easier way was there all along he said and he said when he looked back his boss was Jesus said just pitch it over in the water PW don't try anymore just get on it and ride down he said he just pitched it over in the water jumped in the water be to Splash in the water and the current taking it right on down to Camp he began screaming at the top of his voice that his strength was all coming to him holler I'm riding on it and he said he came two in the room screaming at the top of his voice his wife who had been having her hands laid on her hands laying on him praying said he jumped up in the middle of the room screaming when he come to himself I'm a riding on it I'm a riding on it I'm aiding writing on it he's supposed to be dead his strength's supposed to be gone and he comes out of it and he's got all of his strength back he says brother that's what it is tonight I take Jesus Christ at his promise throw the thing into the Waters of the Holy Ghost and I'll ride on it Hallelujah no matter what takes place I'm riding on it he says right just keep a riding no matter what everyone anybody else says no matter how many times you've tried just push it over and start riding on it God will will take you right down to the place where you ought to be he says don't you believe it see Paul Raider was trusting in his strength Paul Raider was trusting in his Works he was trusting in his past experiences and there came a place where he needed to go beyond all of those things and Jesus said why don't you take my way you can't do this just listen to me do it the way I show you and all of a sudden you'll find you've got exactly what you were looking for amen our Victory is because Christ has already made a way through Calvary he's made a way through the Holy Ghost amen he's made a way through the word and he's just trying to get us to the place where we'll step out and start relying on that rather than trying to force the issue ourselves Amen Brother John Andes just preached a service on we are his victory and he shared this quote and I just wanted to share it with us tonight it struck me as such a beautiful thing he says this we are his victory Train My Hands to War listen you are the victory the war is for you and you've already won he says the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose what that we would have the victory he's already paid the price he's already made the way for us he says he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory amen when we see him coming down and living among the church that's his victory shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave and neither can they keep us that's right we're bound right and we're already potentially Arisen because we've raised from Death unbelief in his word that's what death is to disbelieve his word from denominational Creeds to his eternal word of the Eternal God he says which is he himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the victory Train My Hands to War let go and let God have his way that's what we're talking about this evening we're resting on his word on his life on his overcoming power on his Word of Promise on his very love on the sacrifice on the price that he's already paid that's our rest this evening and me that's what we're leaning on this morning I'm winning because Christ said I'd win not because I'm a winner but because he made me a winner he made me an overcomer he said that I would have it in this age amen we see that we've got it but we see the world has an indwelling presence the same way and it's one them we are his victory but you'll see the world is Satan's Victory today and it's a contrary Spirit to what we have amen the world's full of demonic spirits and and lustful things and and the lust of the eyes and the lust of the Flesh and it's beastly and it's carnal and it's religious even all of these things are Satan's influence over us and we're fighting those Spirits we're not fighting those people we're fighting those influences not governments and and these different things amen so our overcoming is always going to be over a spirit not over a person we do not attack people ever ever but we fight a spirit and you can fight a spirit without fighting a person absolutely amen the physical we said before there's levers being pulled Satan's pulling God's pulling his and Satan's pulling his and what we see happening in the natural is just a reflection of what's happening in the Supernatural in the spiritual amen we're a reflection of God's work in the spiritual realm and we'll see the world is a reflection of Satan's work in a spiritual realm that's why Paul said we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and rulers of the darkness of the world and spiritual wickedness in high places even Satan himself has come down and he's working in people if you look in the in the in the gospels you see that Jesus said that or the word says that Satan entered into Judas he gave an intent and he put into his his heart to to betray him and then at the at the table with Jesus Satan literally enters in and he becomes the son of predition Satan enters into a person and today people are completely filled with demonic spirits and they have no clue what they're doing even to the point of thinking they're doing righteousness and they're not but watch this we're talking about Train My Hands to War we're talking about how do I win how do I hold how do I overcome very familiar quote overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks remember we read that first scripture where it talked about his wife WS the Ws of the enemy it's not obvious he says a lot of people say there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil and he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's a devil then at the same time you recognize him know that he's a devil and he's against you then to re overcome you must recognize that the god in you 1 John 4:4 greater is he that's in you that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already overcome him already overcome him doesn't that change the battle when you know there is no battle to be won you're facing a defeated enemy that nothing can prosper against us that completely changes how we look at the situation now he says that he has already the that the one that's in you has already overcome him and by his grace hallelujah it's by his grace you are more than a match for him he says amen that's real overcoming when you recognize amen when you recognize what greater is he that's in me I've got something that the world can't give and the world can't take it away we sing that song Amen there's something inside of me that is already overcome every single demon every single situation every Temptation every lust every problem that I face he's already come and he's defeated it and now he's in me to do what the very same thing it's the works of Christ all over again overcoming the works and destroying the works of Satan last service we we spoke of how the most important thing you can know is that you're a child of God because when you know it then you can trust it and when you trust it it can start to take effect as brother Jerry Fury was talking about this last week I don't care if you win $100 million I don't care if you become the CEO of the of the biggest company in the world the greatest thing you can ever have is knowing that you're a child of God you can rest on that you can take it to the bank amen and it's worth 10,000 worlds to know who you are amen because when we realize that that tells us who our daddy is amen my daddy's not Lanny klet I was talking to a brother not not too long ago and I said the greatest thing that happened to me in my relationship with my Earthly father was when I recognized he wasn't my father cuz now my expectations of him can change my love to him can change my disappointments to him don't have to be there the same way why because I've got a heavenly father that loves me more than my my Earthly father ever could and he provides for me in a way that my Earthly father never could you that have a Godly father praise the Lord you're blessed but not all of us do but I'll tell you you've got to rest on the Earthly father's lineage not your Earthly father's lineage amen when we know who our father is that tells us who our kingdom is it tells us who our family is it tells us who our weapons what weapons we have it tells us who our fellow soldiers are tells us what our objective is tells us what our rules are it determines everything that we do in our life when we know who we are and Paul will come back to this in Ephesians 6 because he's placing us now how we battle against Satan how we fight how we train Our Hands to War he says wherefore taking unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand when it's all said in done we're still standing nothing else is left except the bride of Christ that's it right everyone else might follow scripture says a thousand will follow my side and 10,000 at my right hand but it'll not come nigh unto me things that will take out everyone else can't touch you they can beat on you they can battle against you but you're left standing if you'll take on this Armor of God he says stand therefore having your loins G about with truth truth doesn't mean knowing your right that's not what we do not wear a girdle that says I am right it says wear a girdle of Truth amen the word is right and I'm standing on the word I'm not wrapping myself in my rightness I'm wrapping myself with the word of God Amen when you're standing on truth you don't need to fight my wife was sharing with me about I don't know when it was but maybe it was in the days of Wesley and whatnot they wouldn't go out and argue they wouldn't have theological debates why because they believe that the that the truth could stand on its own they didn't have to defend it the results come if you stay with the truth so you don't have to fight about it what could be what might be these different things you just present the truth and they take it or they leave it that's what Jesus told them remember he says go in and if they accept you wonderful give them the blessing if they don't just shake the dust off your feet and move on the truth will do the work amen after that it says having your Lo loins gir about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness now the breast breastplate covers your your upper half of your body are major organs and remember it's not our righteousness that covers Us it's his righteousness the robe that we wear is his righteousness and so often we find truth and righteousness tied together because we think we're right and therefore we are self-righteous and we wrap ourselves with self-righteousness and you know what that does nothing self-righteousness stops no weapons in fact it exposes you to everything because self-righteousness has no value it has no strength when we're trying to prove we're right it's the biggest trap that Satan has for a Believer today trying to be right rather than standing on truth because what it leads to is divisions it leads to splits and it leads to a religious spirit because it's not about me being right I'll never be right right means to be true by the word of God with the right motive the right objective and guess what we don't have that all the time I don't at least it doesn't take us anywhere good needing to be known as right I've got written here says it usually leads to a religious spirit rather than the holy spirit amen I'm not here to be right I'm here to stand with truth and the truth will protect itself he says in your feet Shaw the preparation of the gospel of peace notice the intention of where you go is with peace remember the scripture says if it be possible as much as lies in you live peaceably with all men we do not go seeking a fight because if you seek a fight you're going to get a fight because remember we're we're dealing with spirits but the spirits are in people so if I go around with a chip on my shoulder called being right then I'm going to find a battle everywhere I go but if I can walk in came with the intention of being at peace and sometimes peace is because I choose not to fight sometimes the greatest battle you'll fight is walking away not choosing to engage I don't care who we are we're not going to intellectually argue somebody into Christ it doesn't work that way they need a personal revelation and so we can present in humility and meekness and let it go and then Paul says above all three things above all he says taking the shield of Faith Why without faith it's impossible to please him we walk by faith not by sight he says above all all he says taking the shield of Faith whereby wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked Faith stops those darts and then it quenches them what is it it takes out doubt it neutralizes it we don't fire them back Faith doesn't take the enemy's arrow and then shoot it back at them it stops it puts the fire out and then you keep walking on it absorbs them says take the helmet of salvation what does the helmet protect the head the mind the thing that keeps us is his grace it's his salvation amen that keeps our mind amen the Revelation the certainty that I am saved I am his I am his elected bride I am his chosen children that's what holds me day by day brother Steven strew would talk about Prest destination he says predestination is the chain that keeps you tied to God it's a beautiful thing you can't get away from it you've got some movement in there but you can never get away it protects the Mind salvation protects the Mind amen the battle of the mind is what will you take the word or will you take Common Sense education reason these different things none of those are the weapon of the believer the weapon of the Believers it is written it is written it is written he says the he says and then take on the sword of the spirit which is the word of God there's only one weapon that we hold there are many weapons we have but there's one he weapon that we hold and he says it is the word of God Amen the sword of the spirit which is the word of the god word of God what are Satan's weapons we're going to get into this in a second common sense that's what brother Bram said it's Common Sense intellect reasoning Satan says pick up my weapon and then we'll have a then we'll have a battle that'll never work then he says praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints you know what that means I'm not just in it for me I'm here for you you're here for me my wife was telling me on the way over about one of her cousins that got cancer and she reached out to her mom this this woman wasn't going to church wasn't serving the lord and she said I I know that God answers prayer when you guys pray and so her mother went and they told her to the church and the sisters got together and they fasted and prayed and God healed that woman of cancer we're not just in the battle for ourselves I'm not in it for me I'm in it for you and you're in it for me right right amen we're all in it together amen if I've got the victory if things are going for me you know what I need to be doing praying for the one that's not got it so easy right now not relaxing in my couch at home you know like the rich rich young or the rich ruler that just sat back and said you know Soul take thy ease you've got money in the bank you've got a good job you got a beautiful wife your kids are all going to church sit back That's what Satan loves to do get you to sit back While others are fighting the battle anden we got to get in the battle and help each other out amen now we're talking about teaching my hands teach My Hands to War and we see here in in verse 17 that there's only one great weapon given to the church spiritually speaking now we'll see this as we go into future Services where brother br will say the greatest weapon is the greatest weapon is the greatest weapon is but you'll see that those are often attitudes and approaches but there is one thing that you can use as a literal response to Satan every time and it's right there it is what it is the sword of the spirit which is the word of God it's only one work weapon that works against Satan himself and that's the word of God it's something you can say and it's something you can do and that's to put the word on your lips it is written brother Bram takes us back to Jesus and and his in his trial with Satan he says that Old Devil now you think he's Brazen you think he'll attack a child he says he'll attack anything and haven't we seen it he doesn't care how old your kids are he'll go after them won't he if he can't get you he'll go after your kids and get you that way he says he'll attack anything he attacked Jesus Christ he's not smart he came at him with three wild attacks Satan just don't didn't didn't just only attack once he'll attack you with a disease then he'll come back and attack you and tell you the days of Miracles has passed you didn't get healed there's nothing to it he attacked Jesus three times and with three wild attacks he run in on Jesus with his unbelief in God's word he says now what did Jesus do you're saying brother John how do I win Jesus was the word of God he was the word now he attacked the word Satan did he says glory in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the word dwelt and made flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus was the word and what did he do he cut him to Ribbons what did Jesus do he was the word so with the word he cut Satan on his wild attack he flew in there like a bunch of Stormtroopers or something another like that he flew in on Jesus the word like that and Jesus took that word and sliced him to pieces Hallelujah sure he sliced him to pieces defeated him with the word we think it's some big thing Jesus had three very simple answers Jesus did not go on with a 30 minute sermon he took him back to the balance of the word every time and that was it that's all he had to do it wasn't this back and forth he attacked once Jesus corrected him with the word he attacked again Jesus corrected him with the word he attacked again Jesus corrected him with the word and it was finished he couldn't get past the word he says see his attack watch listen close this closing his attack is what disbelieve God's word that's his attack so that's our battle believe the word or let Satan cause you to disbelieve it he says there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces Satan and God and what is Satan's weapon against you is to try and get you to disbelieve your weapon he disarms you if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe that your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you so what do you do if you think that your weapon's no good you'll lay it down and you'll pick up another one and guess what every other weapon belongs to Satan and he trains with it and he's been training with it for thousands thousands and thousands of years so guess what I can pick up reason as a weapon and Satan will beat me every time because I've got 44 years of experience I've been practicing reason since I was a child Satan's been doing it for Millennia I can pick up my common sense and try and fight him with that and he'll beat me blue why he's got a a PhD many times over in com sense education Satan's playground I can never pick up Satan's weapons and beat him with it they're his weapons I can't beat somebody with their own weapons I've got to stick with what I've got brother baham says this way he says look he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight Train My Hands to War hold on to the word then he says your done so he says hold that weapon don't you lay it down can I put it this way make sure you pick it up you can't lay it down if you never pick it up you got to pick it up and once you pick it up make sure you don't lay it down does it matter if we read our Bibles Church does it matter if we read all of our Bibles when you look at Jesus's answers to Satan they did not come from one chapter they came from all through the Books of Moses everywhere he knew his Bible inside and out it matters not just listen to the prophet not just listen to Brother John you got to read your Bible because that is the only thing that will defeat him it's the word of God Amen and that's a day by day by day thing it's a day by day by day thing you I was reading of David's Mighty Men And if you look in the scriptures David had some amazing Warriors but there was three that stood above all and the first one was adino the eite and he killed 800 soldiers all by himself remember Samson killed a thousand granted with a job own of a donkey but this guy killed 8,000 or 800 with a spear all by himself but the number two guy is the one I want to look at this evening because it says after him was elazar the son of Dodo the aloh heite came from Hawaii one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were gathered together to battle and the men of Israel were gone away sometimes even the great warriors get on the run but this guy's one of the three the chief three it says and he arose you know what that means he probably got knocked down can't arise if you're already up he got knocked on his keester and then finally he said enough's enough he said and he smot the philis ing until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto The Sword and the Lord W wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil notice it says his hand was weary he fought until his hand was weary but that it says his hand clave unto the sword he fought so long that his sword became a part of his hand you think you're tired get so tired that you can't let go of the word he fought until his hand became fused to the handle of his sword he got so used to holding it and so tightly was he gripping it that he could not even let it go if he wanted to he couldn't change weapons if he wanted to his hand was clenched around his sword and nobody could break that grip no weapon that was formed against him could Prosper cuz he couldn't even let go of it himself he had fought so long with that sword he had become one with the sword church we need to come to the place where we can't let go of it even if we want to where this is the only weapon that we've got our hand is formed to it our hand is tight around it and we can't lose it no matter what we try it's there until the battle is over it's the word of God we've got to come to that place where that word's a part of our hand and it's the only thing we go to amen it is written it is written it is written it is written listen you don't have to have 12 scriptures to defeat Satan you just have to stick with one that applies to the situation that will do the job I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases I am the Lord I am the Lord I am the Lord that's it I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor seed begging bread restore unto me the Joy of my salvation and renew a right Spirit within me over and over and over I won't say his name because he always says it's not me not me but my youngest he latched on to that song Break Every Chain from this last from this weekend when we had Services he was in Costco singing there is power in the name of Jesus Break Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every Every Chain Break Every Chain and then he goes into break every chain and he never comes back to the name of Jesus but he's latched on to it he's in the house and he sings Break Every Chain 93 times why it's become a part of him now it's okay to repeat the verses church it's okay to repeat the scriptures like we said last service it's time Satan started getting frustrated with our tactics no matter what I do she says I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases no matter what I do he keeps believing and he keeps giving me that one stupid scripture that I can't get around Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it doesn't take the whole book but you got to have faith in whatever you're holding you got to know it belongs to you it's yours it's not Brother John only it's not sister Amber's only it's not brother Merl's only it's mine it's my Bible it's my God it's my word and I'm a part of it and it's a part of me amen become a broken record Break Every Chain there's power in the name of Jesus brother Bram says this Satan and Eden when he first come to attack a person knowing the children of God were fortified with this word he says Satan attacked the word see he never attacked the bean he attacked the word first look at that sneaker that lizard what he does today the first thing he can lay it on and say well that's not a good person he can't look at us and say you're not good people we are good people we are good people we have flaws we have failures but we are good people he says he can't say that that is a good person see but the only thing he tries to do no matter how good the person is is to get them to deny that word that's just o only thing he wants want to do is get you to deny that word so Satan tried to attack the word in the Garden of Eden so he had to have something now that he could use to the human being would look better than that word and do you know what he used he says reasoning just what we'd say is common sense see so that's what he used and he succeeded so that's what he's used all along but God can't give nothing else but his word because that's what he chose first and when God makes a decision it has to ever remain that way he says Satan took reasonings and took the reasonings and attacked the word and shook Eve off the path by reasonings by human reasonings he says now catch this church now the only way that he he said she got she'd have got to believe God's word it had to be appealing who's going to take something that doesn't look better than what they've got so if he can't get you to doubt straight up he'll get you to lay it down because something else looks better he says Satan knows how to make reasonings appealing it has to appeal to you and sin is very appealing and there's only one sin and that's unbelief so it's really appealing and Satan makes sin so appealing to you can I use an example this evening think about tithing I can use tithing in this church because we don't have a problem with tithing it's the most generous people I know is in this church so let me take tithing why do we pay tithes first we pay by obedience the word tells us to do it amen it's a means of supporting the ministering of the word of God it's a means for helping to have a building in these different things and then we also pay ties by faith because there's a promise that if you'll pour in your ties then he'll pour out a blessing that you can't contain but eventually we start to pay ties by one other thing and that's by experience because we know that when we pay ties then he gives us our needs every single time amen somehow magically we're still able to make ends meat when we give 10 or% 10% or more to God you know what people are scared to tithe I'm scared not to tithe I am genuinely I am why because I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor see bacon bread I've been out of work I've lost jobs I've I've lost golden handcuffs as we've talked about before and God has met my need every single time doesn't mean it doesn't get tight but it means he's met the need every single time and so that's why I pay ties but listen Common Sense will say we're in a cost of living crisis we look at our grocery budget and it's growing growing growing every month Common Sense would say you can pay your house off 5 years earlier if you don't pay your tie and put it towards your house Common Sense would say you can can have a vehicle that's newer than your newest one which is 11 years old if you'll stop paying your ties and put that towards a car payment common sense says you can go on a wonderful vacation every year if you don't pay your ties common sense says you can get that car you've been looking for for forever if you don't pay your ties but here's the thing I only look at those things if I get my eyes off Christ amen because those things are the lust of the eyes they're the to the flesh it has nothing to do with me I am content here right now but if I I get my eyes off the word and I start looking around at what other people have rather than what I need then what happens is Satan has a common sense way to access my life but if I can keep my eyes on Christ if I can keep my eyes on what he's doing in my life and how he's using me then I don't care whether I get that car furthermore he keeps the car that I have I know people that can't drive a car eight eight years without it falling apart on them and I've got one that's 11 and another one that's 12 years old and they do just fine by God's grace why because I'm trusting him I don't need to live a lifestyle like everyone else I just need to be where he wants me doing what he wants me to do and he'll take care of the rest he'll add everything that I have need of and then I find that he gives us more than we ask for just by being faithful to what he asks us to do that's his promise amen that's his promise see we want a word result but if we do that we've got to give a word response first we get what we put we get out what we put in what we plant is what we s what we reap later amen if we're going to sew by Common Sense we're going to reap what common sense says which is a blessing that's limited by your understanding whereas if I can do it God's way now it's above and beyond what I could ever ask or think that's what happens when I go by the word of God brother Bram contines this is the message how can I overcome he says Jesus showed us how it's done how did he do it by the word that's how he did it for he was the word same thing for us he says and Jesus said if you abide in me and my words in you he says you're back to word again the Word of Promise when does The Word of Promise come church when you abide in Christ that word abide means to live continuously in his presence daily weekly monthly yearly not in his presence when I have a need and then back out continuously day by day abiding living with him living in the word day by day he says when you're back to word you're back to the word again you're back to the Word of Promise he says what is the Word of Promise to every Christian greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he says then how do I overcome not me but the word that's in me the word is God then I overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me if you abide in me my words and you then you ask what you will just keep pressing up he says you're coming to the top as sure as anything see you have to come to the top he's not saying you have to come to the top he's saying if you keep pressing and you keep abiding it will bring you to the top it's an inevitability not a need it's not a must it's not a command he's saying the more you press into his presence the more you'll get get closer to the top and eventually you'll break through that's the simple truth of it amen when people are struggling with situations the first thing I ask them is where is your situation in the word of God we've talked about this before we have people that are going directly to prayer rather than the word of God the word of God is to give us Faith it's to give us a foundation it's to give us confidence that when we go before him then we can have what we will it's a basis for our our requests to God so God gives us that word and so the thing is will we use the word to find our place if we can find the word and find our place in the word then we can abide there we can rest there we can put our feet down there and say I'm not moving from this no matter what Satan says no matter what common sense says no matter what my banker says no matter what this one says I'm going to stay right here because here's where the word is and here's where the promise is it's the only place that God can respond to you is when you're in the word amen Jesus said you got to abide in in the word you've got to be living it you've got to be breathing it you've got to be dwelling in it you got to be saturated in it so that it becomes you and you become it amen we've got to know we're at our post of Duty I can't abide with Christ and be out of my post of Duty can't do it can't do it because if we walk in the light as he is in the light that means we're walking in his will that means we're walking in his way we're walking in his Spirit we're walking in his word you can't get out of your post of Duty if you're walking with Christ amen so if I know I'm at my post of Duty brother M says when you know you're at your post of Duty you can ask what you will cuz you're at your post of Duty you're about the father's business got nothing to worry about you can approach god with full confidence brother B says this we're starting to close he says the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Ghost see you can take this only so far you can live by this in the in the natural and you can be blessed 100% you live by this it'll make you a citizen but if you receive this it'll make you a child of God there's a difference the Holy Ghost turns this into life that's what it does amen he says the greatest weapon ever put in the hands of man is the Bible to be backed up with the Holy Ghost remember what we said for the that the sons of God are led by the spirit of God he says that Christ died at Calvary to free his church from superstitions and fear and doubt and trembling amen anybody else having some trembling moments these days facing some difficulties facing some family uh genetics facing some some business issues facing some family issues he says he lives today he rose from the dead He's Alive Tonight hear ye him we look in the scriptures at the seven sons of SAA and we find that they were trying to use the Bible without the Holy Ghost and what happened was they wanted what the apostles had they wanted the results of the Apostles without the the pathway that the apostles had walked and so they jumped into a battle that they weren't prepared for using a weapon that they hadn't been trained on and when we look in the scriptures we see what happens in Acts 19 it says then certain of the Vagabond Jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we adure You by Jesus whom Paul preacheth and there were seven sons of one CA a Jew and chief of the priest which did so these were minister ministers you know listening to both brother Jerry and brother Paul this weekend was very so this the weekend before was very sobering because how many times did they say these were message Believers amen not all that say Lord Lord are mine these are what we see here men of the cloth of the priesthood sons of Levi it says and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you and when and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded see they had the letter of the word but they didn't have the spirit to make it live the difference was the Holy Ghost not the word it was the Holy Ghost to make the word work amen they had a good talk they had the right pedigree maybe good training but in the end that Spirit ripped the clothes off them and exposed them for everything that they were to those people they were trying to do something for somebody else that they hadn't received themselves yet that's what it was they were Bound by a religious spirit and they were trying to go against their own kingdom and they got overcome they were in a condition of slavy trying to set somebody else free it doesn't work they weren't a new creation they were just power hungry men trying to manipulate the situation man we can't win battles by association we cannot win a battle because we've received an end time message because we believe God sent a prophet because we believe there's a bride that's been called out called out of denomination that's not what makes us Overcomers that's a pathway to it but the Holy Ghost is the only thing that will overcome in this age it's the only thing that's it that's all we've got amen without the Holy Ghost the true baptism the sealing of our souls we will never win it takes a new heart a new spirit and then his Spirit like he said in Ezekiel otherwise we can't win the battle brother B puts it this way he says men and women what we need today is not our names on a church book which is perfectly all right but we need to pick up that powerful weapon of the holy spirit in our heart which changes our innermost being and makes us new creatures in Christ Jesus and then swipes the way through the sinful World by the righteousness and power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's what we need amen catch this I love this I cried when I read this he says that's what the church needs not a facelifting or a bunch of new members but to revive what we've got revive what we've got not a new message not a new doctrine not some new revelation just simply make what we've got live again that's it he said says and fill with the Holy Ghost and set out to fight the enemy to pray for the sick to heal the sick to cast out Devils freely you've receive freely give these signs shall follow them that believe Christ put into the hand of man the strongest weapon that was ever put to human beings was the baptism of the Holy Spirit a new heart a new spirit and I'll put my spirit in there he says and then fight with what's in you until death shall set you free oh I was uh brother John Andy there they they're doing these little Snippets from from uh the services and he he he was talking about this and he this idea that we've all got to produce the same thing the same amount of the same thing if I could put it that way but he says it's not scriptural he says that remember in the Harvest Time when the when the when the The Reaping is done then some of the plants brought for 30-fold and some 60 and some 90 he was talking about it from a standpoint of engines which really resonated with me he says listen you can have a little four-cylinder in your car and you can go out on the highway he says and you put your foot down and those four cylinders are just going he says but somebody can pull up next to you with a V6 or a V8 and they can just put their foot halfway down he says and they just go right on by you effortlessly but I was talking to him this afternoon and I said when I heard that I said it made me stop and say am I using everything he's given me then because what can happen is we can look around and we can say well I'm doing as much as anyone therefore I'm doing enough but God has given some of us four cylinders he's given some of us six he's given some of us eight and he's given some of us a quad turbo V16 from a buatti that's a brother brandham but there's levels that he's put in there and so often what we do is it's this comparative Christianity I've talked about many times is we sit there and we say well I'm doing as good as him or her guess what God may have given you more don't stop because you're level with them you keep going until he says that's enough amen keep pushing keep pressing because there's other people are depending on us to keep moving forward amen but you know so often again the battle is not usually because we think we've got too much sometimes it is but so often we sitting there and we're saying like a boxer he's got more reach he's got more weight he's got more speed how am I ever going to win this I can't win this fight and if we're looking at it from our own abilities we're right you know we were talking in the car on the way over and about her her cousin that another or one that had died from cancer and these different things and I've had different ones talk to me about how many people are dying from cancer and they're saying where is Where's God in this who can defeat cancer some can and I'm not here to say why they can or why they can't but I'll say this God knows his own and God knows the faith that we have and God knows the sincerity of our lives but in the end the scripture is not remember greater are you than he that's in the world it's greater as he that's in you amen that is the Difference Maker is him time and time again and I just want to close with this this one scripture and then a a quote afterwards cuz we look at situations and we think I can't do it there is no way I'm coming out of this one either with my health with my life with my marriage with my praise with my worship with my sanity look at my mother look at what she faced and you see today she's got more than a lot of women that didn't have all the hardship that she had why God can take us through the fire amen but look at this this is in 2 Chronicles 20 it says now behold the children of Ammon and Moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not so Israel's facing these these children of Ammon and Moab and from Mount seir God had spared these families when they were coming into Canaan so they're not in Canaan they're outside of Canaan and remember they're going through and God spared them because they were children of lot who is related to Abraham so it was the relationship to Abraham that caused God to spare those people but now they're causing trouble for Abraham children and so the king is saying behold I say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou has given us to inherit he's talking to God and he's saying listen the ones that you spared now are causing us issues and he says Oh Our God wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company we got nothing that will stop them we have no hope he says that cometh up against us neither know we what to do for our eyes but our eyes are upon thee that's the way to look at the situation it's okay to say they're bigger than me but notice now their eyes have turned from the situation and they've turned to God and they say but we're looking to you because if we look at the situation we look at ourselves we look at them there's no victory in looking at the situation but we'll look to you for this one it says and all Judah stood before the Lord they got serious about it it says with their little ones their wives and their children nobody exempt all of Judah came before God it says then upon jeziel the son of Zachariah the son of beniah the son of Ja the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of Asaf came the spirit of the Lord in the midst of the congregation and he said hearken ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat now I want you to catch this church he doesn't say mommies and daddies cuz who's there from the oldest to the youngest is in his presence from the little ones to the children to the parents to the grandparents the Le the ministry the Kings the Common People everyone's there and he says hearken to me every single one of you this is for everyone he says thus saith the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of the this great multitude for the battle is not yours but God's Hallelujah every single one from the smallest to the oldest this battle is not yours it belongs to God he says tomorrow you shall go down against them you're still going to have to be there you will be present for this battle behold they come up by the Cliff of ziz and you shall find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of jeru he's telling them how this is going to play out but he says ye shall not need to fight in this battle attle you're going to be there but you're not going to have to fight you'll be present to see the power and demonstration of God he says set yourselves and do what stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord with you oh Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord shall be with you I love that so much ye shall not need to fight in this battle Oh Brother John we need to mature so much we need to get no no no we need to recognize the battle as his we'll be there remember what brother Brandon would say he says I was just there I just happened to be there when the angel did it just a vessel a yielded vessel just a a person that was so yielded to the spirit that the Spirit could do more than that vessel ever could in of itself that's all we'll be there but it'll be him that's winning the battle amen why it's not our battle it's his battle we're the Sheep of his Shepherd of his pasture we the apple of his eye were his chosen children were his elect bride we engraved in the palms of his hands we're special to him he protects us he cares for us brother Brown would say this as we are truly closed he says and that's the way it is anything as long as you're going to do it if someone talks about you and you talk back about them God can't fight your battles you're fighting it yourself he says see now you say well that's about talking back no this goes for any battle he says see just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him the greatest weapon that I know of of a Christian today is a committal to God when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and God will take care of it see sometimes this is the problem I want to dig into this just for a moment are we okay five minutes he says just he says when when you realize he says that you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him see we think what that means is that I do everything I can and then I realize it's not working and then I commit it to him that's not what he's saying he's saying commit it to him because you know it doesn't matter what you do commit it to him up front and then say lord it's in your hands and then you're just walking through and letting him work the situation out if he wants you to talk he'll give you the words if he wants you to be quiet he'll zip your lip if he wants you to be kind he'll ask you to be kind if he wants you to be upfront he'll get you to be upfront if he wants you to engage he'll get you to engage if he wants you to pull back he'll get you to pull back it's committing it to him before you do anything that he's talking about he's going to use us we are his hands and feet we're his mouth he uses us but the key is to commit it to him and say Lord I know that I'm just going to mess this situation up listen I can't even sort my own life out how in the world am I going to sort somebody else's out without him we don't see the root of the issue that's what the word does the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it goes down to the motives and objectives it gets down to the root of these things amen so he's saying you've got to understand that the victory comes when you say I can't get the victory myself and so Lord I'm committing it to you I'm placing it into your hands from the start and I'll Trust you the rest of the way through and then we do what we walk in faith in confidence that we are walking with him that's it that's it he says when you you know you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and that's really the start of Victory is to realize it's not by me it's going to happen as in anything I bring to the table we're going to talk a lot more about this on on Sunday mean amen but we're not in the battle to prove ourselves we're not in a battle to be right we're here for Souls Jesus the Great Commission was go you into all the world and preach the gospel he's looking for seed he's looking for souls and so if we're about that then it's got to be about him in the first place I'm not drawing people to me I've got to draw people to him I can't Point them to me I've got to point them to them to him I'm not we're not here to to to to build big churches and have big programs and and do big television Ministries and and get worldwide Fame no we're here to do his will and it's just a select few that we're going to find it's always been that way amen I can't do it on my own you can't do it on your own this committal to God is the greatest weapon he says you have in your Arsenal is to give it to God from the start rather than wait until it spirals out of control and we've got it all tangled up like spaghetti and then we say I may need some help here amen anybody else ever done that where we get so deep into it that we just make a hash out of it and then we say I guess I should have invited God into this Lord can you help me out and you know what he's gracious enough to come in and undo all of the mess of the spaghetti that we've made but I'm learning more and more invite him in at the beginning then you got some real confidence in it amen let's stand together if we would you know we don't have time to go into the rest of that story but you'll see what happens is they don't go out to war and and they don't go out with a glum face you know with with Dread in their heart of oh I've got to face this trial they walked out and they walked out with the praise and worship band at the front of the army they walked out knowing that the victory was coming knowing there was a battle that was going to happen but that there was Victory ahead and so they walked out and they put the the the the Priestly worshippers in front and then they walk behind and they literally walk to battle giving a testimony of the outcome before it ever happened amen that's what happens when we commit it to him when we take him at his word and we walk with him and we say Lord we're trusting you we can walk into the battle with Victory on our mind vict on our lips and praise and worship in our hearts because we know we're walking in his will amen amen God help us to see let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what kind of faith is it when we can give a testimony of Victory before the battle's even started before the battle's even over lord God but Lord as that song says we've read the back of the book and we win Lord we see a clear path we see a finished work Lord and though we can't see every step and every portion of the journey Lord we know that at the end it's a sure thing for the bride of Christ so Lord I'm praying you'll lift our faith higher this evening Lord that as we go through struggles Lord as Satan comes against our mind Lord as he tries and puts common sense and reasoning and education and intellectualism Lord all of these things into our minds Lord may may may we always fight him back with it is written it is written it is written Lord Lord the weakest Christian can say it is written Lord and stand on your word and defeat every every Demon Lord every every bit of Satan that comes against us Lord lift our faith I pray Lord encourage us this evening Lord you see the struggles we Face Lord you see the struggles of our mind the struggles of our body Lord maybe it's finances Lord our B Brothers with businesses Lord those that are struggling against the system Lord however it might be Lord I pray for a breakthrough but Lord not a breakthrough in the situation Lord but a breakthrough in our approach and our attitude first and foremost Lord that'll take us through to the end Lord give us an overcomer mind Lord that's centered on you we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen by his word 1260 by his word I'll prevail by his word I'll never fail Oh by his word all over the come [Applause] [Music] by his word I Prevail I [Music] overcome Oh by his word [Music] while by him his word I'll never fail Oh by his word I'll overcome Oh by his word I'll preil I'll [Music] overcome Oh by his word [Music] I oh by his word I'll never fail Oh by his word all [Applause] overcome Oh by his word I [Music] over when you go home tonight and tomorrow I want you to take what you're facing and I want you to go home and I want you to find one scripture one scripture that identifies where you're standing take that and write it out on a piece of paper put it in your wallet put it put it in your purse put it up on your kitchen with fridge with magnets whatever it is put it someplace where you can remind yourself when you can remind Satan of where he's standing and where you're standing because if you're standing on the word he can't be contrary to it and have any Authority find your place in the word find your promise in the word and from there build Faith with it and use that as a weapon if you can find five scriptures do that but go in and find your place in the word and then you start repeating that back to Satan and When Trials come when when when Temptation comes when failure maybe comes you say it doesn't matter I'm getting back up again and I'm going to keep swinging that sword until I see it come into life in my life amen let's sing that song I will praise the Lord 11:31 I will pray praise the Lord I will praise the [Music] Lord no matter what tomorrow brings what it has in [Music] store I will praise the Lord oh oh I will praise the Lord go into the battle

end we have little victories in our life as we progress towards a resurrection and a Rapture but sometimes the victory that you don't realize is that you're still here you're still standing you're still believing against all hope and against all uh outer evidence maybe sometimes and yet we stay here and we believe and we believe and we believe when we come back and we might fall and we might trip and we get up and we take another crack at it that's Victory cuz so many people just lay down and just let it go but there's something in us and it's the Holy Ghost it's the the SE Gene of God inside of us that keeps us going day by day even when we don't want to we don't want to face the day we don't want to face the music we don't want to face responsibilities we don't want to face that battle that trial that person yet we get up and we do it again and again and again and there's a victory just in the continuation of the battle amen don't ever think that because you don't have the Finish Line you haven't crossed the finish line that you haven't got the victory no every day you serve him is a victory every day you confess he's my Lord he's my savior he's my God he's my king He's My Redeemer he's my healer that's a Day of Victory because Satan hasn't got you yet amen keep in the fight man keep pushing keep believing keep saying Lord I'm With You Lord and give me strength to face another day each one we're going to sing that song keep your mind stay on me as we would go to close this evening amen 740 is the number amen I'm going to ask Brother David if he'll close in
