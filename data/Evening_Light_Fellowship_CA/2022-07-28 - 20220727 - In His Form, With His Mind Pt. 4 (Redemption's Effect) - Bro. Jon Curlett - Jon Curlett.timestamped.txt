[41:38] heavenly father lord that you just
[41:40] didn't take us out of the debtors prison
[41:42] lord out of the pawn shop lord but you
[41:44] may our lives have a purpose lord you
[41:46] gave us a way to achieve lord what we

[41:51] minds would lean towards you
[41:53] lord yet we found they were incapable of
[41:55] serving you in the way that you needed
[41:57] lord and so you came and you paid a
[41:59] great price lord and you've restored a

[42:15] flow out tonight lord from this pope and

[42:32] your scriptures to gen or revelation
[42:35] chapter five ignore what's on the screen
[42:36] that's for me not for you but amen turn
[42:39] to revelation chapter five certainly
[42:40] good to be back in the house of the lord
[42:42] another beautiful not so beautiful day
[42:44] turned into a beautiful day and then
[42:46] certainly i'm enjoying the nicer weather
[42:49] and then certainly enjoyed the service
[42:50] on wednesday that or on sunday that
[42:52] brother aaron preached i love what he
[42:54] said operate from the dominion in you
[42:56] that has been restored amen that was a
[42:58] wonderful thought that he took
[43:00] on the hunger or the nature of hunger
[43:02] amen just before we go i've got a quick
[43:04] retraction here
[43:05] i said last service i was speaking of
[43:07] noah and i said he was just like all of
[43:08] the rest of them and then god called him
[43:10] out and that's true for all of us in a
[43:12] sense but if i'd have read one one
[43:14] scripture lower it said these are the
[43:16] generations of noah noah was a just man
[43:18] and perfect in his generations and noah
[43:20] walked with god so uh i talked to most
[43:23] of you after service but certainly for
[43:24] those online if they heard me say that
[43:26] just let me correct that i was confusing
[43:28] it with what he said with abraham and
[43:30] this is directly what the prophet said
[43:31] he said as they came down in this land
[43:33] and all the people there was everywhere
[43:34] abraham wasn't any better than anyone
[43:36] else he said but god by sovereign grace
[43:39] and election called abraham according to
[43:41] election he says that's it nothing was
[43:44] said that abraham was any better didn't
[43:46] even say he was a believer in the
[43:47] beginning but god with his unmerited
[43:49] grace abraham was saved and not only was
[43:52] he saved but when god called abraham he
[43:54] saved him and gave him his covenant
[43:56] unconditionally and that's kind of what
[43:58] i was pointing to i got a little mixed
[43:59] up here but you want to make sure that
[44:01] you correct that because especially for
[44:03] those online they could hear that and
[44:04] and you could see some error there so
[44:06] just wanted to set that straight before
[44:08] we continue this evening amen in
[44:10] revelation chapter 5 verse 1 and it says
[44:12] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[44:14] sat on the throne a book written within
[44:16] and on the backside sealed with seven
[44:18] seals and i saw a strong angel
[44:20] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[44:23] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[44:25] seals thereof
[44:27] now listen to this answer he says and no
[44:28] man in heaven
[44:30] nor in earth neither under the earth was
[44:32] able to open the book neither to look
[44:35] there on not even worthy to look on it
[44:38] couldn't open it but even if it was open
[44:40] they wouldn't have even been able to
[44:41] look on it there was a worthiness
[44:42] required to even look on this thing no
[44:45] man that was alive dead that was to come
[44:47] that had been in the past none of them
[44:48] was worthy to open or look on this book
[44:51] and john says and i wept much because no
[44:53] man was found worthy to open and to read
[44:56] the book neither to look thereon
[44:58] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[45:00] not
[45:01] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[45:04] the root of david had prevailed to open
[45:06] the book and to loose the seven seals
[45:08] thereof now watch he says what the lion
[45:11] of the tribe of judah but what comes out
[45:13] in verse six says and i behold and lo in
[45:15] the midst of the throne and of the four
[45:17] beasts and in the midst of the elders
[45:19] stood a lamb as it had been slain
[45:22] here's the line of the tribe of judah
[45:23] coming forth having seven horns and
[45:26] seven eyes which are the seven spirits
[45:27] of god sent forth unto all the earth and
[45:30] he came and took the book out of the
[45:32] right hand of him that sat upon the
[45:33] throne
[45:35] and when he had taken the book the four
[45:36] beasts and four and 20 elders fell down
[45:39] before the lamb having every one of them
[45:41] harps and golden vials full of voters
[45:43] which are the prayers of the saints and
[45:46] they sung a new song saying thou art
[45:48] worthy to take the book and to open the
[45:50] seals thereof for thou was slain and
[45:53] hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out
[45:56] of every kindred and every tongue and
[45:59] people and nation amen i'm so glad he
[46:02] did that amen that he didn't just redeem
[46:04] one people of one color or one language
[46:06] or tongue any place one particular
[46:08] family but he said that every one of his
[46:10] children will be brought in from all of
[46:12] the earth amen amen what they've been
[46:14] separated from the presence of god but
[46:16] now he was gathering them all back into
[46:18] his presence amen
[46:19] and verse 10 says and he hast made us
[46:23] unto our god kings and priests that's a
[46:25] finished work
[46:27] that's a finished work right there he
[46:29] says he has made us unto our god kings
[46:31] and priests and we shall reign on the
[46:34] earth that's our full position full
[46:37] authority full dominion full purpose for
[46:40] relationship with god all restored amen
[46:42] you can have your seats this evening may
[46:44] god bless the reading of his word
[46:46] and then we want to continue on our
[46:48] little series of in his form and with
[46:49] his mind and last time we kind of
[46:51] finished at a bit of a dark spot because
[46:53] we spoke of the fall of the minds of men
[46:55] and how they became a to a place where
[46:57] they were only evil continually thought
[46:59] of in their hearts and in their minds
[47:01] but we finished it where we came brother
[47:03] branham says that there was one that
[47:04] came after all of that who lived his
[47:06] life by every word that was written amen
[47:09] that was the perfect sacrifice it was
[47:11] holy it was sinless it was spotless and
[47:13] god accepted that price that christ paid
[47:15] on the crops of calvary amen and that
[47:17] was a total and complete payment for sin
[47:20] there's no other thing you can do now
[47:21] there's nothing before and there's
[47:22] nothing you could do after it was a
[47:24] total and complete payment for sin that
[47:26] was made there and the prophet of god
[47:27] said we believe that all these great
[47:30] benefits that we enjoy today in this
[47:31] christian economy we have were all
[47:33] purchased at calvary by the son of god
[47:35] jesus christ
[47:37] we believe that he was wounded for our
[47:39] transgressions he was bruised for our
[47:41] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[47:43] was upon him and with his stripes we
[47:45] were healed he says it's all a past
[47:47] tense it's a finished work it's
[47:49] something that god has done for us at
[47:51] calvary and as christians we have the
[47:54] right to enjoy these blessings that he
[47:56] has purchased for us so when somebody
[47:58] says it's not for you it's not for your
[48:00] family you've gone too far you don't
[48:02] come from the right background you
[48:03] haven't sown the right seeds you haven't
[48:05] made the right sacrifices say the price
[48:07] is paid there's nothing i can do to
[48:09] warrant this so don't try and tell me i
[48:11] have to match up to something because
[48:13] it's a grace gift that was given to us
[48:15] because we couldn't do anything in the
[48:16] first place he says as christians we
[48:18] have the right to enjoy these blessings
[48:20] that he has purchased for us so
[48:22] therefore no man could save another if
[48:24] it would have been so jesus would not
[48:26] have had to die
[48:27] he says but when jesus died at calvary
[48:30] he settled the sin question forever and
[48:33] every man every creature on earth when
[48:36] he died was saved at that very minute
[48:38] so when we come and we give our hearts
[48:40] to god when we come up and we repent at
[48:42] an altar we're at camp wherever it might
[48:44] be and we give our hearts to the lord we
[48:46] say that's where we were saved that's
[48:48] not where we were saved that's where we
[48:50] recognized that we were saved at the
[48:51] very beginning that we were saved when
[48:53] he gave his life to calvary that we were
[48:55] a part of him before the world ever
[48:56] began that's our recognition but the
[48:58] work was done way before we ever
[49:00] realized it he says the price was paid
[49:03] completely it was so met that god
[49:05] identified that it was true now the only
[49:08] thing we have to do to receive this is
[49:11] to believe it and accept it
[49:14] he says but no matter how much that he
[49:16] died for our salvation we must ourself
[49:19] accept it as our own personal experience
[49:22] our own desire
[49:25] daddy can't put it in you mama can't put
[49:27] it in you they can't guilt-trip you into
[49:29] it they can't what put an atmosphere in
[49:31] the house that makes you want this it
[49:32] has to come from within there has to be
[49:35] something inside a deep calling to the
[49:36] deep a sea gene of god inside of you
[49:39] that calls out for that
[49:40] and guess what it may not be activated
[49:42] until you're 17. you can sit in this
[49:45] church like i did maybe until 10 or 11
[49:47] and not feel the thing but all of a
[49:48] sudden god starts to talk to you and
[49:49] that's when you know that there's a deep
[49:51] calling to the deep and life's easier
[49:52] when you give in early
[49:54] you enjoy life so much better i remember
[49:56] when i before i got saved i put it off
[49:59] because i said i don't know if i'll like
[50:01] it
[50:02] that sounds funny but as an 11 year old
[50:04] that's something you want to consider is
[50:05] will i enjoy it if i give my life to
[50:07] christ but the thing is there was
[50:08] already a poll there there was already a
[50:10] deep calling to the deep so guess what
[50:12] i'd never be happy no matter what
[50:13] anyways i was already getting miserable
[50:16] so i'm saying will i be more or less
[50:18] miserable as a believer if i give in to
[50:20] what i want right now
[50:22] when i gave in believe me life got a
[50:24] whole lot better and guess what because
[50:25] i desired it when i came into it i liked
[50:28] it and we're going to get into that
[50:29] maybe a little bit later on but he says
[50:31] we must want to be saved and believe
[50:34] that upon the basis of his shed blood
[50:36] that we are saved after we have met the
[50:38] requirements of the bible we talked last
[50:41] time about how we lost fellowship we
[50:43] lost dominion and we lost eternal life
[50:45] but our prophet points us to calvary he
[50:46] says at this moment he says the same
[50:48] question was settled forever so now you
[50:50] have access
[50:51] potentially to everything that you lost
[50:53] at eden
[50:55] there's nothing held back because why
[50:57] the price is paid
[50:58] something had to be paid and when that
[51:00] price was paid then you don't have to
[51:02] worry about it anymore now i've drawn
[51:03] this out before i didn't have time to
[51:05] put it in my in my slides but you
[51:06] remember when brother brown talked about
[51:08] he said the truth of justification this
[51:10] is a if this is your bank account
[51:14] right and it has my name at the top
[51:18] and when you have it you have what's you
[51:20] have debits
[51:22] and you have credits
[51:24] in your bank account see now what some
[51:26] people say and then we have a
[51:27] description over here right
[51:29] so what we'd say here is there's sin
[51:31] here
[51:32] and that's what that's a debit
[51:34] and that's a really big number
[51:37] right let's put a billion dollars
[51:38] because i'll never have a billion
[51:39] dollars in my life
[51:40] but that's a debit that means that i
[51:42] what i'll never pay that
[51:44] i'll never pay that now what people have
[51:46] decided so many times and they
[51:48] misunderstand is that when christ came
[51:50] he did this
[51:52] and he did what
[51:54] a million dollar or a billion dollars
[51:57] and so you have what you have a debit
[51:58] and you have a credit if you take the
[52:00] two of those together they add up what
[52:02] to zero
[52:03] they say that's what christ did at
[52:04] calvary but the prophet says no that's
[52:06] not just what he did
[52:07] so then they say well all right we
[52:09] forgot so it's cast into the sea of
[52:10] forgetfulness so we block it out so you
[52:13] can't read it anymore
[52:15] and they say that's what christ did at
[52:17] calvary amen prophet said no no no
[52:20] that's not what he did he says what he
[52:22] says true justification is not that it
[52:25] says because he starts and he says it's
[52:27] as if you never did it by the end of his
[52:29] ministry what does he say
[52:32] you never did it
[52:34] because what any forensic accountant
[52:36] that comes in and he sees this thing and
[52:37] it's blocked off he's going to say like
[52:39] satan does there was something there you
[52:41] did something john curlett you did
[52:44] something i can see the mark there and
[52:45] he says no he can't even see the mark
[52:48] there because you didn't do it in the
[52:50] first place so all he sees is what you
[52:53] got everything you need to claim every
[52:55] piece of property that christ has
[52:57] redeemed back for you all he sees is a
[52:59] billion dollars of credit that you can
[53:02] buy whatever you need them the price is
[53:04] paid and all you're saying is you're
[53:05] saying that's for me that's for me
[53:07] that's for me that's for me because all
[53:09] you have is credit to your account
[53:12] you've got an unlimited bank account
[53:13] amen so don't look at it and say well
[53:16] it's just been a race or it's just been
[53:18] set aside and and what no no no he says
[53:20] you didn't do it in the first place
[53:22] there is no record that satan can find
[53:24] because if he would he'd show it but
[53:26] there's no record left for you anymore
[53:28] so all you have is a credit card you
[53:30] have a credit card you have a checking
[53:31] account linked to what the bank of
[53:33] heaven for every believe every promise
[53:35] in the book that he gave at calvary amen
[53:38] everything that he restored back is for
[53:39] you because all you have is credits in
[53:40] your account there's no debits anymore
[53:42] it's always credit it's always credit
[53:44] it's always credit it's not you phil in
[53:45] the bank it's him filling the bank
[53:47] brother brown says the only question is
[53:48] what will you write on that check
[53:50] that's all you've got left to figure out
[53:52] amen amen but so often what it is is we
[53:54] look at this this thing that happened at
[53:56] calvary and because it happened in the
[53:58] past we say well my sins in the past
[54:00] were covered under that but then we do
[54:02] something today and what do we do we
[54:04] start to act like catholics and we try
[54:05] and beat ourselves up don't we
[54:07] now we're supposed to repent in the
[54:09] church age book the prophet of god said
[54:11] that the zeal are the ages to repent
[54:13] you've got to repent and that means
[54:14] you've got to be sincere and you've got
[54:16] to be sorrowful but to repent doesn't
[54:18] mean lord i'm sorry i did it and then go
[54:20] do it again the next day he says true
[54:22] repentance does what says lord i'm sorry
[54:24] and then it walks away and says i won't
[54:26] do that again by your grace i won't come
[54:28] around tomorrow and ask forgiveness for
[54:30] the same thing because i'll have walked
[54:31] away from what it was that brought me
[54:33] into repentance in the first place amen
[54:35] we're walking in a different direction
[54:37] like i said last time so often what
[54:38] we're trying to cover with repentance
[54:40] ought to be dealt with by deliverance
[54:41] because we're just going around and
[54:43] around in a circle we're going around
[54:44] and around the mountain like brother joe
[54:46] preached on and we're coming back to the
[54:47] same trial the same issue the same ism
[54:49] the same complex whatever it is time and
[54:52] time and time again no that's not what
[54:54] we're looking for we need deliverance in
[54:55] those cases not just repentance amen but
[54:57] i've said it before that what as we get
[55:00] more mature as we grow as believers then
[55:02] i feel what we're getting and we're not
[55:04] so much worried about the books we read
[55:05] and the music that we have and the
[55:07] movies that we watch because that's been
[55:09] dealt with
[55:10] that ought not to even be there really
[55:11] at this point and what we're dealing
[55:13] with now is what attitudes responses the
[55:16] first thought that comes to your mind
[55:18] what it is that you're suppressing so
[55:20] often rather than what's flowing out of
[55:21] you because if your first act is two is
[55:24] to what suppress rather than project
[55:27] then you're missing something aren't you
[55:28] because we're supposed to be what acting
[55:30] from the overflow
[55:32] right we're supposed to be acting from
[55:33] the overflow here so if our our first
[55:35] reaction is to what is to try and beat
[55:37] somebody up verbally
[55:39] then guess what there's not an overflow
[55:40] there and that's what we really need to
[55:41] resolve and that's really what the
[55:43] christians i find the mature christians
[55:44] are dealing with now yes we still trip
[55:46] up i'm not saying we don't but i'm
[55:47] saying we're acting what we're now we're
[55:49] getting into the idea of the attitude
[55:50] and the mind of christ itself not just
[55:53] do i do this or don't i do this but now
[55:54] we're talking about responses now we're
[55:56] talking about the way that we react to
[55:58] things and the first reaction rather
[55:59] than the last reaction amen those sorts
[56:02] of things now
[56:03] and then we're going away from not just
[56:05] doing the right thing but doing the
[56:07] right thing for the right reason
[56:09] right
[56:10] up front
[56:11] not having like i said it to be the last
[56:12] thing we come to but it's the first
[56:14] response that we have but we've been
[56:15] looking at this idea of the restoration
[56:18] to our eden kingdom and we know that
[56:19] pentecost was not a full restoration it
[56:21] was perfect for a short time but then
[56:23] they did what they left their first love
[56:25] so we've got to re-restore back to what
[56:27] they were but then we've got to continue
[56:29] on in the way that they didn't continue
[56:30] on with
[56:31] because that was what it was supposed to
[56:33] do it was supposed to take us to the
[56:34] rapture god in his infinite window
[56:36] wisdom knowing the end from the
[56:38] beginning could see what was going to
[56:39] happen so he predestined us through what
[56:41] seven church ages right but they fell
[56:44] and now we got to come up but we don't
[56:45] stop when we get to pentecost do we we
[56:47] got to keep going on as if the as if
[56:49] what we're going all the way to eternity
[56:50] because that's our purpose here it's to
[56:52] be an overcomer it's to sit with him on
[56:53] his throne it's to take us all the way
[56:55] into eternity amen they were perfect for
[56:58] a short time but they didn't hold on to
[56:59] it they left their first love
[57:01] now we looked at that fallen eden and we
[57:02] know eternal life was lost lost
[57:04] immediately because as soon as they
[57:06] sinned fear set in that's when they lost
[57:08] what they lost that love of god because
[57:10] love casts out all fear amen and then
[57:12] what happened was what it put a fear in
[57:14] them to be in the presence of god
[57:16] now eternal no eternal life is what
[57:18] living in the presence of god eternal
[57:20] life is living with god and the first
[57:22] thing it did was that it caused them to
[57:24] run away from the presence of god right
[57:26] so let me tell you if you're running
[57:27] away from the conviction of the holy
[57:29] spirit if you're running away from the
[57:30] fellowship of the saints if you're
[57:32] running away from church attendance if
[57:33] you're running away from the preaching
[57:35] of the word then what waits for you
[57:36] death
[57:37] fear is driving you because what you're
[57:39] worried of the effect it will have on
[57:41] you and it's death that awaits you
[57:42] because you're getting out of the
[57:43] presence of god so you're giving satan
[57:45] room to work and you're not giving god
[57:47] any time to do what he needs to do in
[57:48] your life right
[57:49] and we see this with god and cain
[57:51] because when when we come to those
[57:53] places what is it that's waiting for us
[57:55] it says what sin awaits at the door
[57:57] that's what's driving this is unbelief
[57:59] is what's pulling us away because if we
[58:00] believed that it would have the good
[58:02] effect that it's supposed to then we'd
[58:03] run to there remember brother braham
[58:05] says adam should have been screaming god
[58:07] god father where are you i messed up and
[58:09] he said he says it's god saying adam
[58:11] where are you at
[58:13] how come you're not ready to meet me
[58:14] again this evening right
[58:16] look what he said to cain because guess
[58:18] what cut god did not judge cain for his
[58:20] imperfect sacrifice
[58:22] no
[58:23] you come with the wrong thing god
[58:25] doesn't say
[58:26] boom down dead away with him away with
[58:28] her she didn't get it right he didn't
[58:30] get it right the first time what did god
[58:32] judge came for refusing to do it when
[58:34] god told him plainly what to do
[58:37] if you look here when he's talking to
[58:39] cain
[58:40] he says if thou doest well shalt thou
[58:42] not be accepted
[58:44] now cain was the son of the serpent
[58:47] and god says you can still be accepted
[58:49] if you do what i tell you to do
[58:51] he says and if thou doest not well sin
[58:54] life at the door he says the only reason
[58:56] you won't do it is because you
[58:57] disbelieve
[58:58] for whatever reason you disbelieve
[59:00] brother branham said it this way he says
[59:02] when truth of the word of god is brought
[59:04] face to face with us human beings we are
[59:06] prone to shirk back until the last
[59:10] resource
[59:11] what a life we live if we flipped it
[59:13] around and said that what that we are
[59:15] prone when we are faced with the word of
[59:17] god to what run to it as our first
[59:19] resource to lay hold of that and say i'm
[59:22] gonna try that first rather than my own
[59:24] intellect rather than my own strength
[59:25] rather than my own education rather than
[59:28] all the things that i have to offer i'm
[59:29] gonna run to the word first and let's
[59:31] see how that does
[59:33] not as our last resort but as our first
[59:35] resource why because it's been proven in
[59:37] our life
[59:38] scripture says taste and see that the
[59:40] lord is good give it a try and let him
[59:42] let him have a chance to actually prove
[59:43] it to you one or two times amen listen a
[59:46] child of god will always come around you
[59:48] might have to go around the mountain a
[59:49] couple times but eventually god will get
[59:51] you where he needs you to
[59:52] but the idea is to get there first
[59:54] the first time don't waste your time
[59:56] don't don't waste his and then he can
[59:58] start to use you and progress you and
[1:00:00] mature you into your kingdom position
[1:00:01] amen
[1:00:03] when you see god blessing someone we
[1:00:04] ought to ask ourselves what do they have
[1:00:06] that i don't
[1:00:08] because it's not necessarily that they
[1:00:10] have what great gifts great physical
[1:00:12] presence some of the greatest preachers
[1:00:14] in the message are like four foot two
[1:00:17] right they don't win us over with their
[1:00:19] imposing physicality or their great
[1:00:21] booming voices or anything like that
[1:00:23] right but what is it they've come to a
[1:00:25] place of consequence and sanctification
[1:00:27] in their life where they've given so
[1:00:29] much to god that he trusts to use them
[1:00:30] with great gifts and listen that's not
[1:00:32] limited to ministry that's limited to
[1:00:34] each and every one of us we all have to
[1:00:36] have a prayer closet we all have to have
[1:00:38] a what a devotions life we all have to
[1:00:40] have a place where we meet god and our
[1:00:42] spouse isn't there and our children
[1:00:44] aren't there and we've got a way to talk
[1:00:46] to god one-on-one we've got to have that
[1:00:48] because that's where god's going to deal
[1:00:49] with us it's great to have anointed
[1:00:51] services but when's the last time we had
[1:00:52] that anointed service in our prayer
[1:00:54] closet amen when you're driving in your
[1:00:56] car when you're listening to a message
[1:00:57] when you're streaming another service
[1:00:59] when god drops down and he touches you
[1:01:01] and he places you and he pushes you
[1:01:02] towards a decision so that you know
[1:01:04] where you need to go
[1:01:05] it doesn't always happen here
[1:01:07] two days a week for a couple of hours
[1:01:09] isn't enough you got 24 hours a day for
[1:01:11] another five and a half days six days of
[1:01:13] the week he's got a lot of time to work
[1:01:15] with you if you'll give him a place to
[1:01:16] do it amen
[1:01:18] what did paul say
[1:01:20] he said we deserve we should desire what
[1:01:22] kind of gifts carnal
[1:01:25] financial
[1:01:26] he said spiritual he says desire the
[1:01:28] best spiritual gifts for yourself no
[1:01:31] for others
[1:01:33] because the gifts are given for the
[1:01:34] edification of the body amen it's for
[1:01:36] other people it's to meet the needs of
[1:01:37] the body not just to meet your need he
[1:01:39] says that's what you ought to be to the
[1:01:40] place in is where you're not just asking
[1:01:42] him to meet your daily needs but he's
[1:01:43] asking you're asking him lord can i how
[1:01:45] can i help the rest of the kingdom how
[1:01:47] can i help the rest of your children how
[1:01:48] can i help my local body what can i do
[1:01:50] that's going to further the kingdom
[1:01:52] above and beyond my own life amen
[1:01:55] now after adam and eve lost eternal life
[1:01:56] dominion was lost because we know the
[1:01:58] man was cursed to have to work to make
[1:02:00] ends meet on earth and then the final
[1:02:02] thing they lost was fellowship with god
[1:02:03] because he pronounced judgment and then
[1:02:05] he pushed them out of his presence and
[1:02:06] the angels drove them out and there was
[1:02:08] a flaming sword there now notice this
[1:02:11] they couldn't come to him
[1:02:13] they couldn't come to him the way was
[1:02:15] guarded right they couldn't come to the
[1:02:16] tree of life anymore but that doesn't
[1:02:18] mean the tree of life couldn't come to
[1:02:20] them because we see it time and time
[1:02:21] again you'll see it in noah that's the
[1:02:23] first place we see it as noah right noah
[1:02:25] found grace in the eyes of god and god
[1:02:27] comes down he talks to noah noah
[1:02:29] couldn't go to god but god could come
[1:02:31] down to noah and then he did what to
[1:02:32] abraham he he came down and he talked to
[1:02:35] him he says i'm going to make you a
[1:02:36] great nation
[1:02:37] who am i lord who are you by the way
[1:02:40] right brother braham says as far as we
[1:02:41] know abraham wasn't anything prior to
[1:02:43] god calling him he wasn't a believer he
[1:02:44] wasn't anything he was just a guy
[1:02:45] walking around living with a bunch of
[1:02:47] idol worshipers
[1:02:49] there's nothing there right we see it
[1:02:50] with david god came and talked to him we
[1:02:52] see him come down and talk to the
[1:02:53] prophet samuel he could come down and
[1:02:55] yes you could pray out to him but there
[1:02:57] was no there was no way you could enter
[1:02:59] into the presence of god of your own
[1:03:00] free will it wasn't allowed god said you
[1:03:03] can't do it anymore that's not allowed
[1:03:04] anymore you can have that directness of
[1:03:06] fellowship and so what we had as i just
[1:03:08] put this together very quickly was we
[1:03:10] had a veil we had a barrier between
[1:03:12] mankind and god and you see the yellow
[1:03:14] arrow there the the bright yellow arrow
[1:03:16] is god and god can come back and forth
[1:03:18] and that's his own free will that's his
[1:03:19] sovereign grace that does that he can
[1:03:21] come down at any time and touch you and
[1:03:23] then go back to eternity but when man
[1:03:24] comes up he keeps hitting up against
[1:03:26] that barrier because he can't cross that
[1:03:28] because sin was blocking him out he
[1:03:30] couldn't come back there so on the inner
[1:03:31] and outer courts what you're justified
[1:03:33] and sanctified but there's no perfection
[1:03:35] there and it's a perfection is required
[1:03:37] to go in
[1:03:38] you have to be perfect to stand in the
[1:03:40] light of perfection amen but in his
[1:03:42] presence there's perfection and
[1:03:43] fellowship and there's eternal life
[1:03:45] so man keeps trying to get in there but
[1:03:47] there's a veil there that he can't pass
[1:03:48] through there's only one thing that can
[1:03:50] pass you through that veil and that's
[1:03:51] blood as we know right amen so there is
[1:03:53] no possibility to continually dwell in
[1:03:56] the presence of god
[1:03:57] we can do that today
[1:03:59] we can continually dwell in the presence
[1:04:00] of god today but back then under the law
[1:04:03] under the the blood of bulls and goats
[1:04:04] they could not come into the presence of
[1:04:06] god any time they want you know who
[1:04:08] could one man
[1:04:10] once a year for a very short period of
[1:04:12] time could walk into the shekinah glory
[1:04:14] of god and spend a little bit of time
[1:04:16] there and what was he doing he'd go in
[1:04:17] with blood for himself to cover his sins
[1:04:20] and if god accepted that then he'd come
[1:04:22] right back out and he'd get more blood
[1:04:23] and he'd go in for the sins of the
[1:04:25] people he didn't get a fellowship in
[1:04:27] there he didn't get this warm fuzzy
[1:04:29] feeling necessarily perhaps he was going
[1:04:31] in what fearfully because if god judged
[1:04:33] him then there was nobody else to go in
[1:04:35] for the people so he was going in humbly
[1:04:37] with his head down holding that blood to
[1:04:39] pour on the mercy seat so that his sins
[1:04:41] would be covered and then he's coming in
[1:04:42] with more blood to do that afterwards
[1:04:44] for the people and then what the blood
[1:04:46] the sin was covered it wasn't done away
[1:04:48] with it was kind of like we had here
[1:04:50] where it was what it was there but it
[1:04:51] was just what it was pushed over
[1:04:54] it wasn't paid for it was just covered
[1:04:56] up for a little bit god couldn't see it
[1:04:57] under the blood and guess what
[1:05:00] women could never experience the
[1:05:01] shekinah presence of god in that way
[1:05:03] to go into the temple behind the veil
[1:05:05] into the holy holies women were excluded
[1:05:08] from that guess what only one priest a
[1:05:10] year was allowed in there you couldn't
[1:05:11] have physical flaws
[1:05:13] right you couldn't have a mole on your
[1:05:15] face you couldn't have a misshapen nose
[1:05:16] you couldn't have one leg shorter than
[1:05:18] the other
[1:05:19] right you had to come from a certain
[1:05:20] family the tribe of levi
[1:05:22] and then you had to by luck
[1:05:24] get chosen to be the high priest for
[1:05:26] that year so one man out of the millions
[1:05:28] of israelites got to go into this kind
[1:05:29] of presence of god
[1:05:31] and only for the briefest of moments and
[1:05:33] then he came out and then all it was was
[1:05:34] what ritual
[1:05:36] now god could come down and bless them
[1:05:38] but you couldn't go to him
[1:05:40] you could pray but that's it
[1:05:42] there was no guarantee that you were
[1:05:43] going to break into the presence of god
[1:05:45] it would only be if he would come down
[1:05:46] amongst you amen
[1:05:49] we know from eden that death is
[1:05:50] separation from god right that's what
[1:05:52] brother brown would say he said what
[1:05:53] death is just what separation from god
[1:05:55] when you're in hell it's what separation
[1:05:57] from god when you look at at the parable
[1:05:59] of
[1:06:00] you know the beggar and that man and
[1:06:02] there was what a a great distance
[1:06:04] between them it was a separation between
[1:06:05] the presence of god the bosom of abraham
[1:06:08] they called it and that man right that
[1:06:10] was death was that he couldn't be in the
[1:06:11] presence of god amen but how could you
[1:06:13] ever expect under this kind of condition
[1:06:16] to have eternal life because you
[1:06:18] couldn't be in the presence of god only
[1:06:19] one man got it for a very short period
[1:06:21] every year the rest of us were excluded
[1:06:22] from it and god forbid that you even
[1:06:24] think about being a gentile in this
[1:06:26] dispensation because you weren't even in
[1:06:28] there no you were you were toast under
[1:06:31] this one it was only the jews that had
[1:06:32] the potential blood and it was only one
[1:06:34] jew out of all of them that got to go
[1:06:35] into the presence of god amen
[1:06:38] but what happened
[1:06:40] christ comes down and he date and he
[1:06:41] gives his life on a cross
[1:06:43] and all of a sudden we see what happens
[1:06:44] and we see a veil that's about to be
[1:06:46] torn but i want to read that
[1:06:47] and just go through it for a little bit
[1:06:49] this evening
[1:06:50] now matthew 27 it says jesus when he had
[1:06:53] cried again with a loud voice yielded up
[1:06:56] the ghost and behold the veil of the
[1:06:58] temple was rent and twain from the top
[1:07:00] to the bottom and the earth did quake
[1:07:02] and the rocks rent and the graves were
[1:07:05] opened and many bodies of the saints
[1:07:07] which slept arose and came out of the
[1:07:09] graves after his resurrection and went
[1:07:11] into the holy city and appeared unto
[1:07:13] many now when i think of that i have
[1:07:15] that picture of the the temple and the
[1:07:18] veil being torn from top to bottom it
[1:07:19] kind of reminds me of superman comics
[1:07:21] now i know none of you have ever looked
[1:07:23] at comics as young people but in the
[1:07:25] superman comics he always wears civilian
[1:07:27] clothes over his his special superman
[1:07:29] costume right and what does he do is
[1:07:31] when there's an emergency what's he do
[1:07:32] he rips the clothes off and reveals
[1:07:34] himself as a great superman and then he
[1:07:36] goes and he saves the day the damsel in
[1:07:38] distress and these different things
[1:07:40] guess what we needed a superman
[1:07:42] and we needed a revealing of that
[1:07:44] superman a superman that wouldn't be
[1:07:46] touched by what
[1:07:48] satan's satan's tricks
[1:07:50] that he would be impervious to satan's
[1:07:52] arguments
[1:07:53] right that trials and temptations that
[1:07:55] came up would not push him off of the
[1:07:56] word of god that he could take whatever
[1:07:58] was thrown at him and stay exactly in
[1:08:00] his position like adam did and should
[1:08:02] have all the way to the end right but
[1:08:04] what he came down this superman and he
[1:08:07] died on a cross for us
[1:08:09] amen and when he did that
[1:08:11] he took all of our blame on him and
[1:08:13] we've talked about that before how this
[1:08:14] is a man that had never felt any shame
[1:08:16] he never felt any any dis a any any uh
[1:08:20] of the follow-up that comes with doing
[1:08:21] things wrong amen a believer when he
[1:08:23] does things wrong you feel sick inside
[1:08:24] don't you and you feel heavy and you're
[1:08:26] sore full he had never felt that before
[1:08:28] and all of it from all of us dropped
[1:08:30] onto his shoulders at that one moment
[1:08:33] and he gave his life for us there but we
[1:08:35] see what happened here in matthew 27 it
[1:08:37] says that what the earth quaked and the
[1:08:40] rocks rent and i read this before but i
[1:08:42] want to bring it out again and certainly
[1:08:43] for the visitors here it'll be new to
[1:08:45] them because so often brother branham
[1:08:47] frames this as a sorrowful scene
[1:08:50] when he talks about the great earthquake
[1:08:52] and the rock splitting open and all
[1:08:53] these different things but in 1964 at
[1:08:56] the end of 64 he says it a different way
[1:08:59] he says and when the great shepherd was
[1:09:00] smitten the great sheep prophet when he
[1:09:03] was sweating back there he said it is
[1:09:05] finished and at that moment as soon as
[1:09:07] his shepherd was smitten it was over he
[1:09:11] says sin is settled there was no more
[1:09:13] sin they were clean the penalty was paid
[1:09:16] the believers whose names were written
[1:09:17] in the book of life predestinated from
[1:09:20] the foundation of the world it was
[1:09:22] finished that very minute that jesus
[1:09:24] said it was finished he that great
[1:09:26] shepherd had come for his sheep it was
[1:09:29] finished and god's right hand was pulled
[1:09:31] from his bosom smitten
[1:09:33] he says but then on easter he returned
[1:09:35] it amen and raised it up again to his
[1:09:38] bosom and extended it down to you and i
[1:09:40] in the form of his word to redeem us
[1:09:42] back to the original garden from which
[1:09:44] sin took us
[1:09:45] the hidden secret of his great heart was
[1:09:47] revealed by a prophet shepherd no wonder
[1:09:50] the mountains jumped and shouted on that
[1:09:52] day no wonder the sun hit its face and
[1:09:55] screamed for
[1:09:56] joy
[1:09:57] he says no wonder all nature broke loose
[1:10:00] the wind shook the trees until they
[1:10:02] shook and shook and joyed and jumped
[1:10:05] they seen the prophet shepherd on the
[1:10:07] mountain redeem
[1:10:09] every name on the book of life and they
[1:10:12] seen that what their own nature was
[1:10:15] redeemed he says they screamed and
[1:10:18] jumped and the world went into an
[1:10:19] earthquake the mountains rent and the
[1:10:21] rocks fell out and the sun went down and
[1:10:23] everything taken place the mountains
[1:10:25] rung out and the sun went down and
[1:10:27] everything took place he says it twice
[1:10:28] but listen to what he says but there was
[1:10:30] nobody hurt amen
[1:10:33] in sorrow and pain things tend to get
[1:10:35] hurt but he says under these conditions
[1:10:37] he says nobody got hurt in fact people
[1:10:39] came to life under this
[1:10:41] amen nature itself was bearing very what
[1:10:45] witness of this redemption event and
[1:10:46] they were rejoicing in it for 4 000
[1:10:49] years they've been falling fall and
[1:10:50] falling and all of a sudden they saw
[1:10:52] somebody in one moment took them all the
[1:10:54] way back to their original place
[1:10:56] that what there was a way made now that
[1:10:58] there wasn't before that there was a
[1:11:00] place coming back for the believer and
[1:11:02] for nature itself that they couldn't
[1:11:04] have even thought about before they've
[1:11:05] been looking for it they've been
[1:11:06] dreaming about it they've been praying
[1:11:08] for it and nothing had happened then in
[1:11:10] one moment they saw everything come back
[1:11:12] came and they knew that what this was
[1:11:13] the start of the manifestation of the
[1:11:15] sons of god and this was part of the
[1:11:17] restoration of the earth back to its
[1:11:18] original condition amen amen
[1:11:21] what was it joy was bursting out
[1:11:24] believe me they cried when he died i
[1:11:26] believe that there was sorrow at the
[1:11:28] price that was paid but there was joy at
[1:11:30] what that meant when it was paid amen
[1:11:32] and the effect that it was going to have
[1:11:33] on all of us amen so what did he do
[1:11:36] when he died what did god do
[1:11:38] he tore the veil and what was that
[1:11:41] it was restoring fellowship wasn't it
[1:11:43] and guess what god didn't go around the
[1:11:45] earth and just say hey you can come talk
[1:11:48] to me now
[1:11:50] he didn't just go from one to the
[1:11:51] another he didn't whisper it to his
[1:11:53] chosen people did he
[1:11:55] because it says what god so loved the
[1:11:56] world
[1:11:58] god loves life amen god loves humanity
[1:12:02] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:12:03] only begotten son
[1:12:05] and so what did he do he did something
[1:12:07] very public
[1:12:08] he didn't just go around whispering to
[1:12:10] the elect
[1:12:11] but in plain view he showed every one of
[1:12:13] them that what
[1:12:14] there's something that's happened
[1:12:16] you don't have to come through a priest
[1:12:18] now you don't have to come through a man
[1:12:19] now to come into my presence i'm not
[1:12:21] just limited to one man a year from a
[1:12:23] select family from a select tribe and
[1:12:25] from a priesthood that's imperfect
[1:12:26] physicality and these different things
[1:12:28] but he says now anybody can see in to
[1:12:30] this holy of holies amen amen
[1:12:33] listen this veil
[1:12:35] took 300 priests to carry it and wash it
[1:12:38] when it got dirty that's how big and
[1:12:39] heavy it was
[1:12:40] and it had these fine fabrics with with
[1:12:43] beautiful stitching on these things with
[1:12:45] overlapping panels as we've talked about
[1:12:46] before and then over top of it what did
[1:12:49] you have you had badger skins over top
[1:12:51] of it and it was virtually soundproof
[1:12:53] they say once you got in there the
[1:12:55] heaviness of the drapes and then those
[1:12:57] badger skins just would absorb sound and
[1:12:59] they go from the ceiling all the way
[1:13:00] down to the floor and they cross
[1:13:02] everything off close everything off from
[1:13:05] the world amen
[1:13:06] but what do those badger skins represent
[1:13:09] why would they put that on there why not
[1:13:10] just have the fancy
[1:13:12] you know fabrics and the gold stitching
[1:13:14] and all the the purples and the and the
[1:13:15] reds and these different things why did
[1:13:17] why did they throw the badger skins on
[1:13:18] it
[1:13:19] if anybody knows anything about badgers
[1:13:21] they're the meanest animals alive
[1:13:23] that and a wolverine wolverine is kind
[1:13:24] of our badger in north america i think
[1:13:27] but brother says this he says notice
[1:13:28] that old veil that hid the glory
[1:13:30] the old badger skins there was no beauty
[1:13:33] to be desired of it neither was his
[1:13:35] flesh that's the reason people said a
[1:13:37] little old stoop over fellow like that
[1:13:40] probably 30 years old and gray his beard
[1:13:42] was gray wasn't much to look at the
[1:13:44] bible said there's no beauty that we
[1:13:45] should desire him he didn't look like a
[1:13:47] king that old badger skin but oh what
[1:13:50] was on the inside
[1:13:51] that's why we don't dress up our gospel
[1:13:53] the way churches are these days that's
[1:13:55] why we don't cater to the world the way
[1:13:56] that they are and dress it up with their
[1:13:58] music and their clothes and get hip and
[1:14:00] me stand up here and a pair of blue
[1:14:01] jeans and a and a 800 belt and five
[1:14:04] thousand dollar sneakers and a and some
[1:14:06] sort of crazy haircut and
[1:14:08] all this stuff we're not trying to do
[1:14:11] what give them what they already have
[1:14:12] that's antichrist if they're drawn to
[1:14:14] what looks like them then that's going
[1:14:15] to be an antichrist gospel but what
[1:14:18] there's going to be badger skins over it
[1:14:19] it's not going to maybe look so great
[1:14:21] but when you get past that you're going
[1:14:22] to see that there's something of great
[1:14:24] value behind it amen
[1:14:26] listen what he says he says and a little
[1:14:28] bunch of holy rollers sitting together
[1:14:30] in a hot building like this they call
[1:14:32] them not much beauty to be desired but
[1:14:35] what's on the inside that's right that's
[1:14:37] what we have sitting here
[1:14:39] maybe they wouldn't look at us and say
[1:14:40] that's something i really want but when
[1:14:42] they get on the inside and they see
[1:14:44] what's happening in here and the effect
[1:14:45] it has on their lives then you start to
[1:14:47] say they got something that my church
[1:14:48] doesn't have
[1:14:49] they got something that people that call
[1:14:50] themselves christians don't have that i
[1:14:52] know
[1:14:53] he says i'm sure it's veiled for many
[1:14:55] hearts you see all right he says
[1:14:57] outwardly it was nothing but all was on
[1:14:59] the inside once inside of it then you
[1:15:02] see it
[1:15:03] how do you get into it shaking hands
[1:15:05] joining he says no you're born into it
[1:15:08] dying getting rid of your old badger
[1:15:10] skin see your old self to get into a new
[1:15:13] one see forsake the old badger skin
[1:15:16] we're fighting that badger skin every
[1:15:18] single day aren't we i like what brother
[1:15:20] aaron said it's not perfected yet he'll
[1:15:22] redeem it he's going to glorify it but
[1:15:24] in this condition we're going to be
[1:15:25] fighting that badger skin every day and
[1:15:27] it takes god's grace not only for us but
[1:15:30] it's going to take god's grace for the
[1:15:31] person that's looking at us to look past
[1:15:33] that to look long enough to see that
[1:15:35] there's something bigger than what's
[1:15:37] what i'm seeing on that badger skinny
[1:15:39] man listen it's still a battle to get
[1:15:41] into the presence of god i said we can
[1:15:43] live there 24 7. we are already seated
[1:15:45] in heavenly places in christ we have
[1:15:47] access to him 24 7 but you got to fight
[1:15:49] through a badger skin amen and not just
[1:15:51] yours but you're gonna have to fight
[1:15:52] through mine as well
[1:15:54] because we're gonna be there trying to
[1:15:55] break into the presence of god together
[1:15:57] aren't we and you've got to be able to
[1:15:58] see past the flaws and the retractions
[1:16:01] to see what that god's using me the same
[1:16:03] as he's using you
[1:16:05] right that there's something behind that
[1:16:06] badger skin that doesn't just look a lot
[1:16:08] like god it is god
[1:16:09] amen
[1:16:11] what was he doing and he did something
[1:16:13] in one moment that men for 4 000 years
[1:16:15] couldn't do that the blood of bulls and
[1:16:16] goats couldn't do and what did he say
[1:16:18] whosoever will
[1:16:21] because guess what you could be a
[1:16:22] gentile and stand out there
[1:16:24] you could come into the outer court as a
[1:16:26] gentile couldn't you
[1:16:27] but you couldn't go any further than
[1:16:28] that
[1:16:29] but you could see past and you could see
[1:16:30] all the way through those doors and you
[1:16:32] can see all the way into this kind of
[1:16:33] presence when that veil was torn because
[1:16:35] nothing could be hit then he tore and he
[1:16:37] showed this isn't a work of man now this
[1:16:39] is a this is the act of god and he's
[1:16:41] coming down to do something amen
[1:16:43] what'd he say whosoever will
[1:16:45] that's what he opened it up to when he
[1:16:46] did that romans 10 says for the
[1:16:49] scripture saith whosoever believeth on
[1:16:51] him shall not be ashamed for there is no
[1:16:54] difference between the jew and the greek
[1:16:56] for the same lord over all is rich unto
[1:16:59] all that call upon him for whosoever
[1:17:02] shall call upon the name of the lord
[1:17:04] shall be saved used to be a levite male
[1:17:07] priest perfect physical condition
[1:17:10] and chosen for that year that was how
[1:17:12] you came in
[1:17:13] where do you see that here whosoever
[1:17:15] shall call upon the name of the lord
[1:17:16] shall be saved
[1:17:18] there's no requirements now women can
[1:17:19] come in
[1:17:21] isn't that great sisters
[1:17:23] the less than perfect physically can
[1:17:25] make it in
[1:17:26] you don't have to be a minister to get
[1:17:28] in you don't have to win a lottery to
[1:17:30] get in i believe we want a lottery to
[1:17:32] get in but we didn't have to apply him
[1:17:34] and it was already in us to win these
[1:17:35] things amen but what you can be anybody
[1:17:38] with any flaw
[1:17:40] any character mistakes any genetic
[1:17:42] predispositions
[1:17:44] you can look bad you can act bad you can
[1:17:46] be bad but if you call on his name you
[1:17:48] can enter into his presence it's that
[1:17:50] simple amen there's no qualifications to
[1:17:52] get in now it's whosoever will
[1:17:56] the prophet of god says in the old
[1:17:57] testament god was hid when he was on his
[1:17:59] mercy seat by a veil in the old
[1:18:01] testament god was in his temple but the
[1:18:03] people come in and worship like this but
[1:18:05] remember there was a veil that hid god
[1:18:08] they knew god was there
[1:18:10] but they couldn't see him
[1:18:12] he says that pillar of fire never
[1:18:14] appeared anymore there did you notice
[1:18:16] that he says there's not one time in the
[1:18:18] scripture from the time that pillar fire
[1:18:19] went in behind that veil that it ever
[1:18:21] showed up again until it came from jesus
[1:18:23] christ he says god was still veiled
[1:18:26] he says when he stood on the earth he
[1:18:27] said i come from god and i go to god
[1:18:30] then paul after his death burial and
[1:18:32] resurrection on his road to damascus
[1:18:34] there was that pillar of fire again what
[1:18:36] was it out from behind the veil he says
[1:18:39] glory to god he was in behind the veil
[1:18:42] now he was behind what a skin veil see
[1:18:45] badger skins behind the veil and when
[1:18:47] that veil was rent on that day of
[1:18:49] crucifixion the veil that he was wrapped
[1:18:51] in was rent on that day of crucifixion
[1:18:54] and the whole mercy seat came into view
[1:18:56] he says now the jews could not
[1:18:58] understand how that god would have mercy
[1:18:59] upon a sinful foul people like we were
[1:19:01] we are but they couldn't see this one
[1:19:04] who was giving mercy because he was hid
[1:19:07] he said well we'll get into in a moment
[1:19:09] i'll get ahead of myself he says he was
[1:19:10] behind the mercy seat on the inside with
[1:19:13] badger skins hanging him down covering
[1:19:15] him before can you imagine the faces on
[1:19:18] the people
[1:19:19] that went into the temple after this
[1:19:21] happened they walk in and they see this
[1:19:22] thing and it's torn from top to bottom
[1:19:24] and they can look into the holiest
[1:19:25] holies where they could never have
[1:19:27] looked before maybe he never had looked
[1:19:29] before
[1:19:30] maybe always wanted to look and had
[1:19:32] never experienced and now they can look
[1:19:34] in there and they can see the ark of the
[1:19:35] covenant they can see the mercy seat
[1:19:37] they can see the blood they can see
[1:19:39] everything that's in there
[1:19:41] and he says they look in there and god's
[1:19:42] not even there anymore
[1:19:45] they wouldn't see anything they wouldn't
[1:19:47] feel anything
[1:19:48] you'd think if there's a shekinah
[1:19:50] presence there and that's open that
[1:19:51] means the presence should be out here
[1:19:53] and i should feel something when i
[1:19:54] walked in
[1:19:55] but i can't imagine they felt anything
[1:19:57] because the chicano presence wasn't
[1:19:58] there anymore i wonder how many lost
[1:20:00] faith after that and walked away
[1:20:03] because why the presence of god was
[1:20:05] supposed to be in there the ministry
[1:20:07] told us that and now it's open and
[1:20:09] there's no shekinah glory there
[1:20:11] what's going on
[1:20:13] the priests going in now year after year
[1:20:15] guess what that bread wasn't stained
[1:20:17] that manna wasn't staying fresh in there
[1:20:19] anymore was it
[1:20:20] now it's moldy bread now it's moldy men
[1:20:23] it'd be gone within a couple of months
[1:20:25] at the most
[1:20:26] and they're going in there and there's
[1:20:27] no shekinah presence and they're keeping
[1:20:29] up what a facade to pretend that the
[1:20:31] presence of god is there and they're
[1:20:32] serving a dead religion in there
[1:20:34] to die in their sins that's what jesus
[1:20:36] said right there was nothing there god
[1:20:38] had departed brother braham says the
[1:20:40] mercy seat was in plain view where
[1:20:42] hanging on a cross
[1:20:44] what he said it was dressed in badger
[1:20:45] skins just the way it was in the temple
[1:20:48] and it was the body of jesus christ and
[1:20:50] they couldn't recognize what it was amen
[1:20:52] amen and yet you had a centurion that
[1:20:54] could sit there and say surely this was
[1:20:55] the son of god
[1:20:57] what was it it was it was a gentile
[1:20:59] recognition starting right there that
[1:21:00] god was turning and he was coming into a
[1:21:02] new form amen what was it the mercy seat
[1:21:06] in there under
[1:21:07] under the veil had lost its purpose
[1:21:10] because why had been moved to another
[1:21:11] place now
[1:21:13] there's a different mercy seat the
[1:21:15] prophet god put it this way he says now
[1:21:16] when the veil was rent at calvary
[1:21:18] then the mercy seat came into plain view
[1:21:21] but what happened it was hanging on
[1:21:22] calvary dripping in blood and as they
[1:21:24] took blood year after year at the
[1:21:26] cleansing of the sanctuary and the
[1:21:27] sprinkling of the mercy seat there god
[1:21:29] with his great mighty stroke of
[1:21:31] lightning power split the old badger
[1:21:34] veil from top to bottom and the mercy
[1:21:36] seat came into plain view the real
[1:21:38] genuine lamb of god was hanging in plain
[1:21:40] view on calvary the real mercy seat when
[1:21:44] god had paid the price himself and
[1:21:46] become one of us and have manifest
[1:21:48] himself as a man to get acquainted with
[1:21:50] us and we to be acquainted with him
[1:21:53] what's he doing restoring fellowship he
[1:21:56] says the mercy seat was in plain view
[1:21:58] all of all of israel on that day of
[1:22:00] atonement
[1:22:02] that's what we saw in revelation 5.
[1:22:04] where's the mercy seat now
[1:22:06] it's there
[1:22:07] because that's where the lamb is
[1:22:09] right he's sitting there and he comes
[1:22:11] out and he's taking it as the line of
[1:22:12] the tribe of judah but he comes out as
[1:22:14] what a lamb slain because what there's
[1:22:16] still blood on the mercy seat they say
[1:22:17] in some churches today that the mercy
[1:22:19] seat is closed
[1:22:20] listen as long as i'm getting mercy i'm
[1:22:22] saying the mercy seat is closed and i
[1:22:24] don't know about you i still need lots
[1:22:25] of mercy so that means he's still there
[1:22:28] there's a quote i may bring later where
[1:22:29] brother braham says it's not when he
[1:22:30] comes to take the book but it's when he
[1:22:32] comes to get his bride that's when the
[1:22:34] mercy seat comes
[1:22:36] and is put away and it turns into a
[1:22:37] judgment seat he's reading those names
[1:22:40] he's calling those people out but when
[1:22:41] they are ready to go that's when mercy
[1:22:43] comes and it goes away because what it
[1:22:45] goes with the bride that was his mercy
[1:22:47] we're here to receive mercy after that
[1:22:49] it's only judgment
[1:22:50] there's only judgment but for now that
[1:22:52] mercy seat is still available to us
[1:22:54] because he takes the book as a lamb and
[1:22:56] he's reading it as a lamb but he comes
[1:22:58] as a lion to get us and then we rule and
[1:22:59] reign with him in the millennium and all
[1:23:01] these different things amen listen if
[1:23:03] he's off the mercy seat we'd have lost
[1:23:04] the victory a long time ago
[1:23:06] that's for sure
[1:23:07] because what we're still in imperfect
[1:23:09] flesh and and currently speaking we're
[1:23:11] still doing things we ought not to do
[1:23:13] so there's still got to be mercy there
[1:23:15] the blood covers it all for forever but
[1:23:17] that blood is where on a mercy seat
[1:23:18] somewhere it's got to be otherwise we'd
[1:23:20] be dead today
[1:23:22] he says before he could even talk to
[1:23:24] adam and eve he had to make a sin
[1:23:26] offering there with the lamb
[1:23:28] catch that
[1:23:29] he had to kill a lamb before he could
[1:23:31] even come and judge adam and eve tell
[1:23:32] them what was going to happen and what
[1:23:34] they did wrong and what was going to
[1:23:35] take place further down the road he had
[1:23:37] to kill a lamb just to bring them into
[1:23:39] his presence
[1:23:40] he says that's the reason listen to this
[1:23:42] that they can have rock and rolls and
[1:23:44] all kinds of vulgar in the world tonight
[1:23:46] and god doesn't take their life or skip
[1:23:48] the world off is because that blood is
[1:23:51] laying on the mercy seat he says but one
[1:23:53] of these days that blood's coming off
[1:23:55] the mercy seat and then it's judgment i
[1:23:57] don't know he says it may be off before
[1:23:59] that clock gets to 9 30. hour and 17
[1:24:02] minutes
[1:24:05] he says i don't know then shall be dark
[1:24:08] and there'll be nothing but judgment he
[1:24:10] says you've passed your own judgment
[1:24:12] with the attitude you've taken towards
[1:24:14] his son and his atonement
[1:24:17] look out if that's your attitude i've
[1:24:19] talked about before we have those shirts
[1:24:20] and those memes and they say that only
[1:24:22] god can judge me that is not the
[1:24:23] attitude we want to have
[1:24:25] no no no no no let's let the word judge
[1:24:27] us now and let's take what we have to do
[1:24:29] let's go with the remedy now because if
[1:24:30] you go to where god judges you you're
[1:24:32] not going to like the results in most
[1:24:33] cases amen
[1:24:35] amen to spurn it is to choose his
[1:24:36] judgment brother brown says you fight
[1:24:37] your way to cal to to to hell you're
[1:24:40] going to fight your way there because
[1:24:41] he's going to put roadblock and
[1:24:42] roadblock and roadblock in front of you
[1:24:44] and what is it it's his mercy and grace
[1:24:45] and it's forgiveness being offered and
[1:24:47] if you spurn it then you're making that
[1:24:48] choice to go to hell every time
[1:24:51] listen this is what he brought to us and
[1:24:52] this is the book of luke chapter four it
[1:24:54] says and he came to nazareth where he
[1:24:56] had been brought up and as his custom
[1:24:58] was he went into the synagogue on the
[1:25:00] sabbath day and stood up for to read and
[1:25:02] there was delivered unto him the book of
[1:25:04] the prophet isaiah and when he had
[1:25:05] opened the book he found the place where
[1:25:07] it is written now he's looking for his
[1:25:09] place in the word
[1:25:11] i was listening to a thing today where
[1:25:13] brother andrew glover shared this and it
[1:25:14] was it was the answer to what is the
[1:25:16] message of the hour and what does it
[1:25:17] give him for and what did he say he says
[1:25:19] the message was to point you to the
[1:25:21] scriptures for your day that are
[1:25:23] important for you to fulfill in this
[1:25:25] time
[1:25:26] listen we we get the whole word we
[1:25:29] believe the whole word but he says
[1:25:30] there's key things here that you need to
[1:25:32] be focused on he says and the messenger
[1:25:34] came to focus you on those things that
[1:25:36] you need to get out of here in the
[1:25:37] rapture so you don't waste your time
[1:25:39] doing what everybody did
[1:25:41] in church ages past take it and move on
[1:25:43] take it and move on take it and move on
[1:25:45] because you've got a growing grace past
[1:25:46] where all of them did so if you stay
[1:25:48] where they were then you're not going to
[1:25:49] get anywhere you've got to grow and grow
[1:25:50] and grow add it word upon word line upon
[1:25:53] line and the messenger came and he
[1:25:54] focused us on those things that will
[1:25:56] take us into a rapture he didn't tell us
[1:25:58] to ignore the bible he pointed us to the
[1:26:00] bible he says i preached the same thing
[1:26:01] paul preached but i'm telling you what
[1:26:03] you need to get out of here focus on
[1:26:05] that and that's why we preach a message
[1:26:07] that's why we don't preach maybe all the
[1:26:09] things that they do in denominations
[1:26:10] because most of it we covered early on
[1:26:12] and now we're moving on to things that
[1:26:13] are higher things that are greater
[1:26:15] that's what's alert our sight amen is
[1:26:17] the word as a song says
[1:26:19] but he comes down he finds his position
[1:26:21] he finds his place in the word in in
[1:26:23] isaiah 61 he says the spirit of the lord
[1:26:26] is upon me because he hath anointed me
[1:26:29] to preach the gospel to the poor
[1:26:32] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[1:26:34] to preach deliverance to the captives
[1:26:37] and recovering of sight to the blind and
[1:26:39] to set at liberty them that are bruised
[1:26:43] and then in verse 19 he says to preach
[1:26:45] the acceptable year of the lord now you
[1:26:47] know in isaiah 61 that that scripture
[1:26:50] should read to preach the acceptable
[1:26:51] year of the lord and the day of
[1:26:53] vengeance of our god and to comfort all
[1:26:55] that mourn
[1:26:56] but he stops here in the middle of that
[1:26:58] verse why
[1:27:00] because that was all going to be in the
[1:27:01] future
[1:27:02] he stopped to say i'm preaching the
[1:27:04] acceptable year of the lord amen what
[1:27:06] was it there wasn't a time for vengeance
[1:27:08] this was a time for repair this was a
[1:27:10] time for remedy this was a time for
[1:27:12] restoration this was a time for
[1:27:14] redemption and so he's saying all of the
[1:27:16] good stuff is coming now
[1:27:17] you've waited all this time you've been
[1:27:19] under the law you've been under the law
[1:27:21] and it's brought you nothing but
[1:27:22] heartache but he says now it's time to
[1:27:23] set all of you free and this is this is
[1:27:26] the day
[1:27:27] this is the time this is the age i
[1:27:29] looked up that word acceptable and it
[1:27:31] means pleasure delight
[1:27:33] favor good will and acceptance
[1:27:38] that's a great year
[1:27:39] that's a great day is when it is of
[1:27:42] god's pleasure god's delight god's favor
[1:27:44] god's good will and god's acceptance
[1:27:46] because everything up to this point was
[1:27:48] just works
[1:27:50] and it couldn't bring you into the
[1:27:51] presence of god unless you were that one
[1:27:52] chosen priest
[1:27:53] but now he says there's something else
[1:27:55] going on now and we're in the season of
[1:27:58] deliverance we're in the season of
[1:28:00] healing we're in the season of
[1:28:02] redemption we're in the season of
[1:28:03] setting those things that were captive
[1:28:05] free amen and this is the acceptable
[1:28:08] time this is the time that god has
[1:28:10] chosen for this in verse 20 says and he
[1:28:12] closed the book and he gave it again to
[1:28:14] the minister and sat down and the eyes
[1:28:16] of all them that were in the synagogue
[1:28:18] were fastened on him and he began to say
[1:28:20] unto them this day this scripture is
[1:28:23] fulfilled in your ears what was he doing
[1:28:26] he was saying there's a year of jubilee
[1:28:28] that's come
[1:28:29] now something's going to happen between
[1:28:30] now and that jubilee but this is the
[1:28:33] time where things are going to change
[1:28:34] where we're going to transition from law
[1:28:36] into grace and that's going to bring
[1:28:38] healing that's going to bring
[1:28:39] deliverance that's going to bring what a
[1:28:41] recovering of sight it's going to bring
[1:28:43] a freedom to those that are bound and
[1:28:45] it's coming through me
[1:28:47] no wonder they were looking at him
[1:28:50] i bet they preached a lot on that
[1:28:52] and everybody was saying it's coming
[1:28:55] it's coming it's coming and then one day
[1:28:56] he stands and he says it's here
[1:28:58] and it's me
[1:29:00] amen amen
[1:29:01] under the law what was it do this and do
[1:29:03] that and if you don't do this then
[1:29:05] something bad is going to happen to you
[1:29:07] now listen the law of the harvest is not
[1:29:08] going to gone away you listen if you do
[1:29:10] bad you're going to reap bad
[1:29:12] if you do good you're going to reap good
[1:29:13] in that sense but god has brought grace
[1:29:16] that overshadows all of that and
[1:29:17] regardless of what we do he brings it
[1:29:19] around to what a place where he can turn
[1:29:21] it into something good that's romans 8
[1:29:22] 28 and we all know these things amen
[1:29:24] brother branham said it this way he says
[1:29:26] god wants to heal you a thousand times
[1:29:28] more than you want to be healed
[1:29:30] because what it's the acceptable year
[1:29:32] that's his good will that's his grace
[1:29:34] that's his desire for you is to be
[1:29:37] healed more than you even wanted
[1:29:39] that's how great god wants to bless his
[1:29:41] bride that's how great god wants to
[1:29:43] bless the the true believer in the
[1:29:44] church in this age amen
[1:29:46] what's he doing he's bringing them back
[1:29:47] now to what abraham was doing that was a
[1:29:49] walk of faith
[1:29:51] that's what it was supposed to be was a
[1:29:52] walk of faith where god could come down
[1:29:54] and he could talk with you but now you
[1:29:55] can go up and you can talk to him as
[1:29:57] well there's this back and forth him and
[1:29:59] under the law what were we we were
[1:30:00] punished we were stoned we were put out
[1:30:02] of the camp we were separated we were
[1:30:04] called out right we had we had things
[1:30:07] that went all the way up into the fourth
[1:30:08] generation even the 40th generation i
[1:30:10] think was the worst
[1:30:12] right god would judge entire families
[1:30:14] for for for the sins of one person and
[1:30:16] now i can have a philandering father and
[1:30:18] then i can become a minister
[1:30:20] because why it has nothing to do with
[1:30:22] him anymore now it has to do with me and
[1:30:24] the seed of god inside of me amen
[1:30:26] there's a grace that's coming to set
[1:30:27] them at liberty that were what captives
[1:30:29] amen
[1:30:30] what was jesus declaring he says now is
[1:30:32] the time now is the time
[1:30:35] and what did he do he walked around he
[1:30:37] showed everybody it because what demons
[1:30:39] had to obey him sickness had to leave
[1:30:41] death had to depart and he would restore
[1:30:43] people back to life
[1:30:45] the power and signs and wonders of god
[1:30:47] came back to the people all of it's
[1:30:49] happening around him and yet this is not
[1:30:51] the perfection that we're looking for
[1:30:53] there's still something that's got to be
[1:30:54] happening because he's doing it and he
[1:30:56] brings on the disciples and they do it
[1:30:58] but yet judas does it
[1:30:59] so it's not a perfect yet it's not
[1:31:01] perfect in us it was perfect in him but
[1:31:03] he's bringing us to a greater place
[1:31:05] but just for that moment he says listen
[1:31:07] this is the time for liberty this is a
[1:31:09] time for captives to be set free he
[1:31:11] talks about even the bruising the
[1:31:12] brokenhearted so often we skip that and
[1:31:14] we focus on the healing of the body and
[1:31:16] these different things but he says i'm
[1:31:17] here to do what i'm here to heal the
[1:31:18] brokenhearted those are the bruises
[1:31:20] those that have been knocked around in
[1:31:21] life whether it's your family whether
[1:31:23] it's your job whether it's your church
[1:31:25] whether it's past ministries all of that
[1:31:27] comes under that and it's an internal
[1:31:28] work that he does complexes insecurities
[1:31:31] and these different things that all
[1:31:32] falls under liberty yeah right it's not
[1:31:35] just i got healed from cancer
[1:31:37] but i got healed from a complex i got
[1:31:40] healed from hurts i got it to the place
[1:31:42] where i could come back to church and
[1:31:43] sit under a minister that i didn't trust
[1:31:45] a couple years ago
[1:31:46] or any minister for that matter when i
[1:31:49] didn't trust any of them i mean it was
[1:31:50] so much bigger than what we often put it
[1:31:52] into
[1:31:53] i want to go back to that quote i read
[1:31:54] earlier where he talked about the earth
[1:31:56] and and the rocks you know shaking for
[1:31:58] joy because i didn't read the whole
[1:32:00] thing because i wanted to bring it to
[1:32:01] this point but he says they screamed and
[1:32:03] jumped and the world went into an
[1:32:05] earthquake and the mountains rent and
[1:32:06] the rocks fell out and the sun went down
[1:32:09] and everything taken place
[1:32:11] listen to what he says he says like any
[1:32:13] meeting when the shepherd reveals to you
[1:32:16] it's finished
[1:32:17] he says i've seen jumping spells and joy
[1:32:20] spells there was nobody hurt
[1:32:23] you know how somebody's dancing or
[1:32:24] running in the spirit they don't hit the
[1:32:26] wall
[1:32:27] or anybody else
[1:32:29] he says nobody was hurt during this
[1:32:31] earth explosion
[1:32:33] he says the mountains rung out and the
[1:32:35] sun went down and everything took place
[1:32:37] but there was nobody hurt quite the
[1:32:39] opposite things came to life again
[1:32:41] he says and i've seen meetings where the
[1:32:43] power of god was revealed to the people
[1:32:45] that they were what free from the world
[1:32:48] and the things of the world and the joy
[1:32:51] of the lord fill the congregation and
[1:32:53] they stood and screamed and cried and
[1:32:56] shouted to the top of their voice for
[1:32:58] the glory of god what's he saying he's
[1:33:00] saying don't keep this as a 2000 year
[1:33:02] old event he says when you realize
[1:33:04] you're free when you realize that you
[1:33:06] were bound and now you're free when you
[1:33:08] realize that you are healed when you
[1:33:10] realize that you are delivered when you
[1:33:11] realize that the bruises are gone he's
[1:33:13] saying then what let him know shout for
[1:33:15] joy let him know that you're praising
[1:33:17] him for the work that he's done it
[1:33:19] wasn't just 2 000 years ago what he said
[1:33:22] this is the acceptable year and that
[1:33:24] year has never ended
[1:33:26] it's been going on and on and on through
[1:33:29] seven church ages through seven
[1:33:31] messengers we're being restored to a
[1:33:33] place where it's happening in our very
[1:33:34] own churches and bodies amen
[1:33:36] that's what he has restored back to us
[1:33:38] it wasn't just calvary's moment it
[1:33:40] wasn't their moment then remember the
[1:33:42] prophet says every every generation has
[1:33:44] its revival make sure you have this kind
[1:33:46] of a revival where you know you're free
[1:33:49] not just free but free indeed
[1:33:51] completely totally
[1:33:53] totally separated totally set aside amen
[1:33:56] what to know that he has done a work in
[1:33:58] your life
[1:33:59] when i was when brother aaron was
[1:34:00] preaching the other night and he was
[1:34:02] talking about you know you can't go back
[1:34:03] to these things you know why you can't
[1:34:05] go back
[1:34:06] because those works are dead because the
[1:34:08] person that did it is dead and there's a
[1:34:10] new life in you that won't allow you to
[1:34:12] go back and do it you can't go back to
[1:34:14] something that doesn't exist
[1:34:15] you can't go back to your old self
[1:34:17] because your old self died there's
[1:34:19] nothing to go back to you're incapable
[1:34:21] of doing it
[1:34:22] it's all dead right and you're a new
[1:34:24] creature in christ amen amen
[1:34:28] i never did see anything disorderly they
[1:34:32] was always right in order because they
[1:34:35] have recognized that their name had been
[1:34:37] written on the lamb's book of life
[1:34:39] before the foundation of the world the
[1:34:41] great prophet shepherd had brought them
[1:34:43] the message and they were delivered the
[1:34:45] prophet shepard no matter what the other
[1:34:47] ecclesiastical realm said about it they
[1:34:49] know what happened no matter what the
[1:34:51] wet blankets around them said
[1:34:53] right true
[1:34:55] no matter what the white blanket said
[1:34:56] it's just emotion
[1:34:57] it's just a church service there's no
[1:35:00] such thing as the holy ghost what is it
[1:35:02] all you need is the word we've all heard
[1:35:03] that one
[1:35:04] listen you need the life of the word not
[1:35:07] just the word because the letter will
[1:35:08] kill you
[1:35:09] and that's what they're saying is you
[1:35:10] only need the letter of the word why
[1:35:12] because they have no life of the word
[1:35:13] but you need a life that comes behind
[1:35:15] today man you know something has
[1:35:17] happened he says no matter what the
[1:35:18] ecclesiastical realm said about it they
[1:35:21] knew what had happened just as them
[1:35:23] shepherds did back there they know what
[1:35:24] took place now you understand what's
[1:35:26] going on in revelation 5 like we read at
[1:35:28] the beginning of the service because why
[1:35:30] they're realizing it's finished
[1:35:33] he's coming he's taken the book nobody
[1:35:35] was worthy and we've been waiting all
[1:35:37] this time for someone that's worthy and
[1:35:38] then he took it and as soon as he did
[1:35:41] what did they do john shouted why did
[1:35:43] john show because he saw his name in the
[1:35:45] lamb's book of life it says and all the
[1:35:47] earth heard it
[1:35:48] what are you going to do when your name
[1:35:49] is written on the lamb book of the
[1:35:51] lamb's book of life when you know that
[1:35:52] you know that you know that it's written
[1:35:54] there then nothing can separate you from
[1:35:56] god that you come from god and you go to
[1:35:58] god the same as jesus came from god and
[1:36:00] he went back to god that nothing can
[1:36:02] separate you from his love that there is
[1:36:04] always grace that will restore you back
[1:36:06] to his presence what are you going to
[1:36:07] sit and complain about
[1:36:09] what how is what weapon of satan can can
[1:36:12] pierce that
[1:36:13] because you're securing him
[1:36:15] a heart of praise will keep satan away i
[1:36:17] do believe that if you if you're
[1:36:19] thanking him for not just what he's
[1:36:20] doing but what he's done and what he's
[1:36:21] promised he's going to do for you amen
[1:36:24] where is this happening in revelation 5
[1:36:25] it's in the holy of holies isn't it it's
[1:36:27] in the presence of god that's why we see
[1:36:29] them shouting and dancing and praising
[1:36:31] and singing a new song to the land
[1:36:34] because what it's not just what he's
[1:36:35] done but it's what he's doing with that
[1:36:37] book he's placing them it says as kings
[1:36:39] and priests he's restoring them to a
[1:36:41] kingdom position amen
[1:36:43] brother brahm says this he says notice
[1:36:45] every year the high priest entered into
[1:36:46] that place the congregation followed him
[1:36:49] up and when he went into this great
[1:36:51] place where the veil dropped behind him
[1:36:52] the inner courts the holiest of holies
[1:36:54] no one dared to go after him
[1:36:57] then he was alone with god he says what
[1:36:59] a beautiful picture it is today of a
[1:37:01] consecrated life who once enters into
[1:37:04] with christ dead to the things of the
[1:37:06] world hid away with god and the veils
[1:37:08] drop down around and all the world shut
[1:37:10] off he says then christianity and
[1:37:13] religion becomes a pleasure to every
[1:37:16] believer
[1:37:17] can you say it's a pleasure to serve the
[1:37:19] lord
[1:37:20] in the good times praise his name and
[1:37:22] the bad times do the same in everything
[1:37:24] give the king of kings all the praise
[1:37:27] amen he says under this in this and it's
[1:37:29] in the hidden life and we'll get into it
[1:37:31] maybe in the in the next time i minister
[1:37:33] but he says it's that hidden life in
[1:37:35] christ
[1:37:36] that's what he's talking about is nobody
[1:37:37] else sees it it's you
[1:37:39] you're behind there you know what he's
[1:37:41] done and guess what the outside doesn't
[1:37:43] always match the inside in my life at
[1:37:45] least
[1:37:47] but you don't worry about that because
[1:37:48] you know what's going on in the inside
[1:37:49] and you know the outside's going to come
[1:37:51] into checking in its own time amen we're
[1:37:53] all going to mature we're all going to
[1:37:54] grow in christ amen the jews in that day
[1:37:57] had one man a high priest to represent
[1:37:59] them each year and they never got to
[1:38:00] experience what he experienced and they
[1:38:02] trusted that what he said happened in
[1:38:04] there did happen in there
[1:38:05] they had faith in that man now the
[1:38:08] prophet's pointing us forward back to
[1:38:09] the death of christ and he says that
[1:38:10] priest used to go in for himself and
[1:38:12] he'd come in
[1:38:13] and go out and they come in again for
[1:38:15] you and then he go without
[1:38:18] and he says you're trusting him to cover
[1:38:19] your pre cover up your sins amen he says
[1:38:22] now you get to go in for other reasons
[1:38:25] because he says here you go in he says
[1:38:27] he says you don't go in alone to cover
[1:38:28] your sins he says now you go in alone
[1:38:30] for one thing and one thing alone
[1:38:32] fellowship
[1:38:33] shut him with god in a secret place
[1:38:36] that's what he's talking about here he
[1:38:37] says you don't go in to cover your sins
[1:38:38] your sins are covered brother brother
[1:38:40] mark did that series on the blood or
[1:38:42] that service on the blood and that's
[1:38:43] that's good for eternity
[1:38:46] the blood's there for eternity you don't
[1:38:47] go into his presence now to cover your
[1:38:48] sins they're covered he can't even see
[1:38:50] them
[1:38:51] they don't exist as far as he can he's
[1:38:53] concerned
[1:38:54] god in all of his great power can't
[1:38:55] bring your sins out from under the blood
[1:38:57] so you don't have to go into his
[1:38:58] presence now for forgiveness you don't
[1:39:00] have to go into his uh not for
[1:39:02] forgiveness of sins in the sense that
[1:39:03] the sins are covered but you go in now
[1:39:05] for fellowship you go in to have a
[1:39:07] relationship with him and him alone
[1:39:10] that's what he's pointing us to right
[1:39:11] and he says when you get in there he
[1:39:13] says it's not a chore
[1:39:15] it's not a chore to be in there with him
[1:39:17] because it's life
[1:39:18] and it's love and it's freedom in the
[1:39:20] spirit and it's liberty and it's healing
[1:39:22] and all these things that we were
[1:39:23] talking about he says now it's a delight
[1:39:26] it's a passion it's a pleasure for you
[1:39:28] to be in the presence of god you're not
[1:39:29] running from it now now you're running
[1:39:31] to it in fact you'll do anything won't
[1:39:33] you to go to a good set of meetings
[1:39:34] you'll do anything to get good
[1:39:35] fellowship with believers you'll take
[1:39:37] vacation time to go to there you want
[1:39:39] you won't go to you know the bahamas or
[1:39:41] hawaii what do you do you go to services
[1:39:43] don't you you take your kids and you go
[1:39:44] off to special services why because that
[1:39:46] matters more to you than any of those
[1:39:48] other things would we all need a break
[1:39:50] but so often what we're doing is we're
[1:39:51] looking for more fellowship we're
[1:39:52] looking for more time in the presence of
[1:39:54] god not more time to enjoy the things of
[1:39:56] the world
[1:39:57] and we see that happening all around us
[1:39:58] amen
[1:40:00] he says but until you come in behind
[1:40:02] that badger skin until you get out of
[1:40:03] your old skin your old thoughts your old
[1:40:06] creeds and come into the presence of god
[1:40:08] then the word becomes a living reality
[1:40:10] to you then you're awakened to the
[1:40:12] shekinah glory then the bible becomes a
[1:40:15] new book then jesus christ is the same
[1:40:18] yesterday today and forever that's a lot
[1:40:20] of ends
[1:40:22] what that tells me is until you get in
[1:40:23] there then none of that happens but once
[1:40:25] you get in there then expect all of this
[1:40:27] to happen as well amen he says you're
[1:40:30] living in his presence
[1:40:32] eating the show bread that's only
[1:40:34] provided that day for believers for
[1:40:36] priests only
[1:40:38] that's why you have to be a king and you
[1:40:39] have to be a priest because the priests
[1:40:41] were the only ones that were supposed to
[1:40:42] eat that bread and he says you get in
[1:40:43] there and you get bread that's only
[1:40:45] meant for the believers for the
[1:40:46] priesthood he says and we are priests a
[1:40:48] royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar
[1:40:51] people giving spiritual sacrifices to
[1:40:53] god he says but you must come in behind
[1:40:56] the veil to see the unveiled god and god
[1:40:59] is unveiled that's his word made
[1:41:02] manifest no things are hidden from you
[1:41:04] jesus said i call your friends i show
[1:41:05] you things i don't show to other people
[1:41:06] why because you're in an intimate place
[1:41:08] with me
[1:41:09] right what a place to find yourself
[1:41:12] that's what's happening in revelation 5
[1:41:14] is they're not just seeing their names
[1:41:15] on the book but they're seeing all that
[1:41:17] comes with their name on the book amen
[1:41:18] that this is not just a lamb's book of
[1:41:20] life but it has a whole title deed
[1:41:22] inside there that tells you who you are
[1:41:24] what's yours what's available to you and
[1:41:27] what you can go claim because all you
[1:41:28] have in your bank account is a credit
[1:41:31] and you got all the credit you need for
[1:41:32] all of those things why it's yours
[1:41:34] you don't even have to pay a price for
[1:41:35] it it's yours it's given to you price is
[1:41:37] already paid
[1:41:39] amen
[1:41:41] we don't have to go in and come out
[1:41:44] that's what we're talking about we don't
[1:41:45] have to go in and come out
[1:41:46] you have to go in and come out come here
[1:41:47] and go out no no no you can go in and
[1:41:49] you can stay in
[1:41:51] and no man can pull you out
[1:41:53] and no man can put you in i mean it's
[1:41:55] only god that's going to draw you in
[1:41:56] there amen we can live there even in
[1:41:57] this fallen condition we can live in the
[1:41:59] presence of god because why our sins are
[1:42:01] covered he made a way for us to come
[1:42:02] over romans 5 says for if by one man's
[1:42:05] offense death reigned by one much more
[1:42:07] they which receive abundance of grace
[1:42:09] and of the gift of righteousness shall
[1:42:11] reign in life by one jesus christ
[1:42:14] therefore as by the offense of one
[1:42:16] judgment came upon all men to
[1:42:17] condemnation adam brought us there even
[1:42:19] so by the righteousness of one the free
[1:42:22] gift came upon all men under
[1:42:24] justification of life
[1:42:25] for as by one man's disobedience many
[1:42:28] were made sinners so by the obedience of
[1:42:30] one shall many be made
[1:42:32] righteous sorry about that
[1:42:35] he said moreover the law entered that
[1:42:38] the offense might abound but where sin
[1:42:40] abounded grace did much more abound
[1:42:44] that means there was a lot and then
[1:42:45] there was a lot more
[1:42:47] and there's a lot more grace than there
[1:42:48] is sin
[1:42:50] right he says that as sin hath reigned
[1:42:52] unto death even so my grace reign
[1:42:55] through righteousness unto eternal life
[1:42:57] by jesus christ our lord so in other
[1:42:59] words as sin controlled us so
[1:43:01] effectively and brought us to death
[1:43:03] grace is all the more effective to bring
[1:43:06] us to eternal life
[1:43:08] so you there's only they say there's
[1:43:09] only two things certain in this world
[1:43:11] death and taxes
[1:43:12] he says listen the law and it was so
[1:43:15] strong that it would take you all the
[1:43:18] way sin would take you all the way to
[1:43:19] death and he says the guarantee of that
[1:43:22] is as certainly found in grace to bring
[1:43:24] you to eternal life as much as death is
[1:43:27] certain by sin he says so is eternal
[1:43:29] life guaranteed by grace to the same
[1:43:31] effect and more and above and beyond it
[1:43:33] it'll overflow it it'll it'll it'll
[1:43:34] never do it it'll never take us back
[1:43:36] amen
[1:43:39] amen but we don't have access like i
[1:43:40] said to god for the purpose of covering
[1:43:42] our sins now he's bringing us into a
[1:43:44] place of fellowship you listen to crisis
[1:43:46] the mystery of god revealed and he says
[1:43:48] what he's trying to bring us to a place
[1:43:49] where he can use us
[1:43:51] not just restore us we we're so happy he
[1:43:53] restores us and he redeems us and he
[1:43:55] takes us out of the pawn shop but the
[1:43:57] question is what are you going to do now
[1:43:58] now that he's brought you out that's
[1:44:00] what we're going to be getting into not
[1:44:01] so much today man
[1:44:03] anyone can come in
[1:44:04] he says but you'll have the heart of a
[1:44:06] priest and you'll have the heart of the
[1:44:07] king that's the two things that you're
[1:44:09] going to have when you're in his
[1:44:10] presence you're not going to come in
[1:44:11] with them but that's what he's going to
[1:44:12] put inside of you amen a new heart i'll
[1:44:14] give you and i'll place my spirit within
[1:44:17] you know these two things amen
[1:44:20] what does a priest mean
[1:44:22] because we're not going to rule here
[1:44:24] not now not in these bodies
[1:44:26] we're going to come back and rule aren't
[1:44:27] we we've got a millennial reign and then
[1:44:28] we've got an eternal reign that's after
[1:44:30] that but we are a priesthood right here
[1:44:32] right now and there's only one thing a
[1:44:34] priest does sacrifices and intercess
[1:44:37] that's he's an intercessor and he offers
[1:44:39] sacrifice and what you don't need to
[1:44:41] offer one for yourself anymore so who
[1:44:43] are you interceding for
[1:44:45] somebody else
[1:44:46] that's the heart of the believer today
[1:44:48] first peter 2 is speaking of this
[1:44:50] priesthood it says wherefore laying
[1:44:51] aside all malice and all guile and
[1:44:53] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[1:44:55] speakings if you want to see where
[1:44:57] somebody's at look at their walk with
[1:44:59] god and this is a great place to start
[1:45:00] if you're looking for that are they
[1:45:02] vengeful do they seek to manipulate do
[1:45:04] they say one thing and do another and do
[1:45:06] they talk about others
[1:45:07] or how do they talk about others
[1:45:10] he says if you want to come to what i'm
[1:45:11] about to tell you get rid of this in the
[1:45:13] first place he says as newborn babes
[1:45:16] desire the sincere milk of the word that
[1:45:18] you may grow thereby that sincere milk
[1:45:21] of the word means you want it all
[1:45:23] because a baby wants all of the milk the
[1:45:25] mother has
[1:45:26] anybody that's had a baby
[1:45:28] certainly the mothers that have fed it
[1:45:29] know that it wants everything you got
[1:45:32] right it doesn't say can you screen it
[1:45:34] for me please can we add a bit of
[1:45:36] chocolate in can we no no it says i want
[1:45:39] everything you got because i know what
[1:45:40] it does for me first thing it does is it
[1:45:42] satisfies doesn't it
[1:45:44] it soothes it brings peace it brings
[1:45:46] rest
[1:45:48] causes them to grow and mature they want
[1:45:50] milk and he says look like newborn babes
[1:45:52] you want sincere milk you want the full
[1:45:54] thing you don't want it diluted you want
[1:45:57] it all because you need it all amen and
[1:45:59] that's the other thing you got to
[1:46:00] recognize is how much you need it he
[1:46:02] says if so be that you have tasted that
[1:46:04] the lord is gracious
[1:46:06] so he's saying if you found god's grace
[1:46:08] you'll want every bit of the word right
[1:46:10] because it was the word that brought you
[1:46:12] it's the word that's going to keep you
[1:46:14] it was grace that brought you and let
[1:46:15] you want it in the first place he says
[1:46:16] and you want to keep in that grace
[1:46:18] because it'll keep bringing the word to
[1:46:19] you that's going to do what it's going
[1:46:20] to wash you and it's going to bring you
[1:46:22] into his presence and it's going to have
[1:46:23] the effect that you want to have in your
[1:46:24] life and you know it by experience
[1:46:26] yes
[1:46:27] right a baby wants milk by experience
[1:46:30] not by hearing the other babies cry and
[1:46:31] then stop crying he wants it by
[1:46:33] experience it may be pushed into his
[1:46:35] mouth or her mouth the first time after
[1:46:37] that they know exactly what it is and
[1:46:39] they know that they want it because it
[1:46:40] has an effect on them the first time
[1:46:42] listen that's why people go around so
[1:46:44] often is because they aren't satisfied
[1:46:45] with what they have they're running from
[1:46:47] here to their in doctrine to doctrine
[1:46:48] and ministry to ministry and place to
[1:46:50] place
[1:46:51] and what is it they've had they haven't
[1:46:52] had that satisfaction
[1:46:54] amen brother tim's been preaching on el
[1:46:56] shaddai
[1:46:57] right and what is it he's the life-giver
[1:47:00] and they just haven't latched on for one
[1:47:01] time and gotten life and so they keep
[1:47:03] running from church to church to church
[1:47:05] and ministry and doctrine to doctrine to
[1:47:07] what try and find something that will
[1:47:08] satisfy them because they ain't growing
[1:47:10] and they ain't satisfied
[1:47:11] they just need to come one time into his
[1:47:13] presence amen
[1:47:14] he says to whom coming as unto a living
[1:47:16] stone disallowed indeed of men but
[1:47:19] chosen of god and precious ye also as
[1:47:21] lively stones as living stones are built
[1:47:24] up a spiritual house and holy priesthood
[1:47:26] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[1:47:28] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[1:47:32] he says but ye are a chosen generation
[1:47:35] a royal priesthood a holy nation a
[1:47:37] peculiar people that you should show
[1:47:40] forth the praises of him who have called
[1:47:42] you out of darkness into his marvelous
[1:47:44] light which in times past were not a
[1:47:47] people gentiles weren't a people that
[1:47:48] was just everybody that wasn't a jew he
[1:47:51] says now you're a people now you're an
[1:47:52] identified group but are now the people
[1:47:55] of god so you are nothing and now you're
[1:47:57] a people of god
[1:47:58] that's quite a transition that's quite a
[1:48:00] change in status isn't it he says which
[1:48:02] had not obtained mercy but have now
[1:48:04] obtained mercy so the identification
[1:48:07] first and foremost of the children of
[1:48:08] the people of god is that they've
[1:48:10] obtained mercy
[1:48:11] so if you obtain it
[1:48:13] then what does that mean
[1:48:15] you ought to give what you get
[1:48:17] right freely you have received freely
[1:48:19] you ought to give amen if you have
[1:48:20] received mercy we ought to be the most
[1:48:21] merciful people on the planet i've got
[1:48:23] to think amen we rule and reign later
[1:48:25] but he says the priesthood is going to
[1:48:26] be what merciful
[1:48:28] that's what he's talking about here amen
[1:48:30] he says we weren't even identified
[1:48:31] before and now we are the people of god
[1:48:34] the prophet of god says has made us
[1:48:36] priests he said did you ever know what a
[1:48:37] priest is what his office is a priest is
[1:48:40] to make sacrifices to make intercession
[1:48:42] and over in hebrews it said that we the
[1:48:44] church is the royal priesthood a royal
[1:48:46] priesthood a holy nation of peculiar
[1:48:48] people see offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:48:51] every man and woman that comes to god
[1:48:53] enters into the veil in the old
[1:48:55] testament there was only there was a
[1:48:57] veil that hung between the holy place
[1:48:59] and the holy of holies
[1:49:00] only aaron alone was to go in there once
[1:49:02] a year
[1:49:03] but every man listen to this every man
[1:49:06] that became a priest could have a bite
[1:49:09] or a taste of the original manna that
[1:49:11] moses and aaron picked up the first day
[1:49:13] the manna began to fall from heaven
[1:49:15] that was their proof really when you
[1:49:17] think about it that the presence of god
[1:49:19] was real in there is that food could
[1:49:20] stay preserved it wouldn't go bad
[1:49:22] because it was in the presence of god
[1:49:24] amen he said the enemies were killed
[1:49:27] behind them the next day they went out
[1:49:28] and all over the ground laid little
[1:49:30] wafers god rained it down out of heaven
[1:49:32] they called it manna and it tasted like
[1:49:34] honey and the people were just supposed
[1:49:36] to pick up enough to last them for that
[1:49:38] one day if they kept it over it
[1:49:40] contaminated and god told moses and
[1:49:42] aaron to go out and pick up several omer
[1:49:44] fulls of it great baskets and take it by
[1:49:47] the ark the holy place
[1:49:48] and there that every time after that
[1:49:51] generation so long after the man has
[1:49:53] stopped falling
[1:49:54] every generation following that wall as
[1:49:57] long as that levitical priesthood would
[1:49:59] last i suppose
[1:50:01] every man that was eligible to become a
[1:50:03] priest when he was ordained a priest he
[1:50:05] had the perfect right to receive a
[1:50:07] mouthful of the original manna
[1:50:10] okay we're putting on our spiritual
[1:50:12] thinking caps now you're a royal
[1:50:14] priesthood
[1:50:15] so what the original one's got to taste
[1:50:17] you're supposed to be able to have a
[1:50:19] taste of it amen as soon as you're
[1:50:20] inducted into the priesthood and we're
[1:50:22] talking about the natural ministry we're
[1:50:24] talking about the royal priesthood the
[1:50:26] body of christ then there's something
[1:50:28] that we're supposed to be able to have a
[1:50:29] taste of each and every one of us amen
[1:50:32] he says think of it what a privilege
[1:50:34] that the men thought they would have
[1:50:36] when a man know that he was coming into
[1:50:37] the priesthood he was going to get a
[1:50:39] mouthful of supernatural baked
[1:50:43] supernatural stirred up supernatural
[1:50:46] food that came from god out of heaven
[1:50:48] that had been kept supernaturally that's
[1:50:50] the message of the hour he says the
[1:50:53] whole ministry is the supernatural how
[1:50:56] can people ever say that they're
[1:50:57] christians and deny the supernatural i
[1:50:59] don't know how they do it myself look
[1:51:01] but a supernatural he says he got a
[1:51:04] swallow of the supernatural as soon as
[1:51:06] he become a priest that's when he knew
[1:51:08] it wasn't just myths and fables and
[1:51:11] false doctrine and and just a religion
[1:51:14] that they made up when he tasted that
[1:51:16] manna that hadn't existed for hundreds
[1:51:18] maybe thousands of years that's when he
[1:51:20] knew that god was real that god had done
[1:51:22] what they read about in the books of
[1:51:23] moses and that he was still alive
[1:51:25] because he was still keeping the man
[1:51:26] afresh
[1:51:28] he was putting a supernatural food into
[1:51:30] his mouth that hadn't existed maybe for
[1:51:31] thousands of years before christ came
[1:51:35] and as me the minute he came into the
[1:51:36] priesthood that was his opportunity was
[1:51:38] to go in there and take something
[1:51:41] what is it job said i have heard but now
[1:51:44] i see yes
[1:51:45] there's got to come a day where you see
[1:51:47] not just here
[1:51:48] where it's not just words but it becomes
[1:51:50] life where it comes off the page and it
[1:51:52] becomes a reality in each and every one
[1:51:54] of our lives he says what a beautiful
[1:51:56] type of now
[1:51:58] of now
[1:51:59] that every person not just ministry not
[1:52:03] just men not just deacons not just
[1:52:05] people that go to this church or that
[1:52:06] church but he says every person them
[1:52:09] days they had to be born in a certain
[1:52:11] lineage a levite before they become a
[1:52:12] priest but now it's whosoever will let
[1:52:15] him come see as soon as they come though
[1:52:18] a birth is considered in it also he says
[1:52:20] you must be born again and every man or
[1:52:23] woman that's born again of the spirit of
[1:52:25] god has a right for this day
[1:52:29] the manna and he says the manna is the
[1:52:31] holy spirit amen that's what we all have
[1:52:34] a right to when he tore the veil he says
[1:52:36] now everybody has a right to my presence
[1:52:38] and not just to come into it but to
[1:52:40] receive it into themselves to the place
[1:52:42] now that he's walking around with you
[1:52:44] he's talking around with you he's
[1:52:45] present with you every hour of every day
[1:52:47] of every week month and year amen
[1:52:50] that's where we're going with this
[1:52:51] series is when he now comes to you and
[1:52:53] now your tasting of the heavenly manner
[1:52:55] and now you've got something to offer
[1:52:57] you're not just a taker but now you're a
[1:52:58] giver amen brother braham says behind
[1:53:00] that bail you don't just get to be with
[1:53:02] god he says you get to receive god you
[1:53:05] get to taste god
[1:53:07] you get to know that he's real
[1:53:09] that's what it means to be in the
[1:53:10] presence of god is to know that he's
[1:53:12] real that his word is manifested that
[1:53:15] it's not just a preacher talking it's
[1:53:16] not just mom and dad saying things but
[1:53:18] it is a life that's there and if there's
[1:53:20] a living person behind that word amen
[1:53:23] he says now he's sanctified with his
[1:53:25] spirit and blood at church that he might
[1:53:27] make every promise in this last day be
[1:53:29] revealed now see he could go back and
[1:53:32] pick up what these other fellows had
[1:53:33] left off here in the last days and by
[1:53:35] his holy spirit reveal all the mysteries
[1:53:37] of the seven seals see he's expressing
[1:53:40] himself that's his purpose
[1:53:42] it's not just doctrines it's not just
[1:53:44] mysteries it's not just things that we
[1:53:45] didn't understand he says it's the
[1:53:47] expression of god and that's his purpose
[1:53:50] that's why he died that's the second
[1:53:52] fold of his threefold manifestation
[1:53:54] first to express himself in christ then
[1:53:57] express himself through the church and
[1:53:59] the same thing christ was the word and
[1:54:01] the church becomes the word when it lets
[1:54:03] the word go through them
[1:54:06] he said see the threefold mystery now
[1:54:08] god manifested in christ god manifested
[1:54:10] in the church all together to bring back
[1:54:13] the original adam and eve again man and
[1:54:15] woman which are one made out of the same
[1:54:17] blood and the same spirit and everything
[1:54:20] else
[1:54:21] that's where we're standing today
[1:54:23] we're standing right smack dab in the
[1:54:25] middle i would say the end of that
[1:54:27] threefold purpose is god working in and
[1:54:29] through his church so that we are one as
[1:54:31] adam and eve were one in the beginning
[1:54:33] as god was in the very beginning with
[1:54:35] them amen what is it he came to declare
[1:54:38] that what there's a jubilee year and
[1:54:40] this is what it looks like he didn't
[1:54:42] just say you could go free he says you
[1:54:43] could go free and you can be with me
[1:54:45] amen
[1:54:46] because there's lots of people got set
[1:54:48] free
[1:54:49] there's lots of people accepted that
[1:54:50] free gift of salvation but what are they
[1:54:52] doing with it they're living lives for
[1:54:54] themselves aren't they
[1:54:55] right and they're going to have to go
[1:54:56] through a judgment they're going to have
[1:54:57] to go through a tribulation but he says
[1:54:59] you don't want to go there you want to
[1:55:00] come all the way until the word is
[1:55:01] flowing through you so that you're the
[1:55:03] word manifested not just christ not just
[1:55:05] william branham not just paul not just
[1:55:07] peter but now you personally are what
[1:55:10] the word may manifest for your day
[1:55:13] he's talking about setting the captives
[1:55:15] free amen this is what it looks like now
[1:55:17] i want to read this as we start to close
[1:55:19] just going back to that isaiah 61
[1:55:23] and someone sends in this question to
[1:55:24] brother branham
[1:55:26] they said i've lived many years in sin
[1:55:27] until i found the lord
[1:55:29] please brother branham i have sinned
[1:55:31] again and i am not worthy to come before
[1:55:33] you in this holy place
[1:55:35] please tell me if i can be restored holy
[1:55:38] again
[1:55:39] please help me brother branham i have a
[1:55:42] devil in me help me
[1:55:44] will you lay your hands upon me
[1:55:46] and restore me again
[1:55:48] remember we're talking about what this
[1:55:50] is the day of liberty this is the day
[1:55:52] the captives are set free
[1:55:54] listen to what the prophet of god says
[1:55:56] he says you have not sinned my friends
[1:55:58] so far in god that you could not be
[1:56:00] restored amen
[1:56:02] if you had sinned so far that you could
[1:56:04] not be restored you'd never want to be
[1:56:07] restored
[1:56:08] see but as long as there is something
[1:56:10] dealing with your heart you're still in
[1:56:12] the line of restoration
[1:56:14] you don't want to be that way or you
[1:56:16] wouldn't ask this question see that's
[1:56:18] itself a proof that god still is dealing
[1:56:20] with you you've probably gotten nervous
[1:56:22] probably satan telling you that you
[1:56:24] can't be restored he says he's lying
[1:56:27] certainly he is because look if there's
[1:56:29] a deep calling there's got to be a deep
[1:56:31] to respond to the call if there's a
[1:56:34] hunger for something that something's
[1:56:35] got to be somewhere or you would have no
[1:56:37] hunger for it see he says yes sister
[1:56:40] brother whoever that wrote this if you
[1:56:42] have fallen down here that don't mean
[1:56:44] you're lost you're just an eagle god
[1:56:46] into a pen that's all you're caged up
[1:56:48] down here in sin again you don't want to
[1:56:50] be there and that's the reason you're
[1:56:52] looking upward
[1:56:54] he says there you are oh brother branham
[1:56:56] i once lived up there is there a way
[1:56:58] here
[1:56:59] yes he says reminds me of one day i was
[1:57:02] walking around behind the farm
[1:57:04] and somebody had tied an old crow up to
[1:57:06] keep him out of the corn
[1:57:09] and that old poor old fellow was just
[1:57:11] about starved to death i couldn't be
[1:57:13] that mean to do that he tied the old
[1:57:14] crow by the foot and that fellow had eat
[1:57:17] everything was around but he couldn't
[1:57:18] get nothing else the farmer just left
[1:57:20] him and he was so poor that he couldn't
[1:57:22] even get up and the crows would fly over
[1:57:25] and say
[1:57:26] in other words come on johnny crow
[1:57:28] winter time's coming let's go south but
[1:57:30] he couldn't do it he was tied
[1:57:34] he says so one day a certain fella come
[1:57:36] by and seen that pearl crow
[1:57:38] so he just went over and caught him and
[1:57:39] untied him and said go on boy you're
[1:57:41] free
[1:57:43] that's what christ did
[1:57:45] he said see and so then the first thing
[1:57:47] you know he kept walking around
[1:57:49] because he's tied to a post and he's got
[1:57:51] a string to his leg so it's pinned here
[1:57:53] and so what's he doing he's just walking
[1:57:55] around and around and around day in and
[1:57:58] day out and he's got a groove worn there
[1:58:00] he's got he's in a rut isn't he and he's
[1:58:02] walking around and around and around and
[1:58:05] then somebody cuts the string but he's
[1:58:06] so used to his limits that he just keeps
[1:58:09] walking around
[1:58:10] and around and around the guy says fly
[1:58:13] free and he says i can't i'm tied yeah
[1:58:15] how do you know you're tired because i'm
[1:58:17] in the same groove i always
[1:58:18] was think about it he says but you can
[1:58:20] fly
[1:58:21] yeah but he can't do it because he
[1:58:23] doesn't realize it's been cut
[1:58:26] he says he'd been tied he'd been so used
[1:58:29] to being tied see he just thought he was
[1:58:31] still tied
[1:58:35] he says you may think you're tied too
[1:58:37] brother sister that wrote this question
[1:58:40] you may think that the devil has got you
[1:58:41] tied down there but he's lying
[1:58:44] there was one time a man come to earth
[1:58:47] jesus christ the son of god and he
[1:58:48] untied you don't you believe it you
[1:58:50] don't have to stay down there no sir
[1:58:52] you're free that's right he died in your
[1:58:55] place to take away your sins you just
[1:58:57] believe on him flop your wings fly away
[1:59:00] with the rest of them don't stay in that
[1:59:02] pit of the devil no sir
[1:59:05] he says now and he reads the rest of the
[1:59:06] question will you lay hands upon me and
[1:59:09] free from that how many of us would love
[1:59:10] the prophet to lay hands on us
[1:59:13] i'd love it
[1:59:15] i trust his prayer
[1:59:16] i trust the call of god in his life i
[1:59:18] trust his ministry i trust his words i
[1:59:20] trust that god would hear him
[1:59:22] listen to his answer brother branham
[1:59:24] will you lay hands on me and free me
[1:59:26] from that
[1:59:27] he says sister dear brother dear sure
[1:59:29] i'd lay hands on you
[1:59:31] and we'd say praise the lord that's it
[1:59:33] it's done he says that wouldn't free you
[1:59:38] what would free you is to understand
[1:59:40] that you're already free
[1:59:43] you're already untied you don't have to
[1:59:45] worry about being free you're already
[1:59:47] free he says jesus made you free be not
[1:59:50] again
[1:59:51] entangled in the yoke of bondage you're
[1:59:54] as free as you can be you don't have to
[1:59:55] be tangled up laying my hands on you is
[1:59:58] just a tradition we might do that that
[2:00:01] why i could do that but that still
[2:00:02] wouldn't set you free until you accept
[2:00:05] what he's done for you that's just me
[2:00:07] saying lord i believe it amen i like
[2:00:10] when brother aaron was talking about
[2:00:11] that stone and they were building up the
[2:00:13] the walls and what did what were they
[2:00:14] pointing out sam ballard and tobias
[2:00:16] they're pointing out the gaps that were
[2:00:18] still there but they weren't pointing to
[2:00:20] the rocks that had been built up they
[2:00:21] weren't talking about the the walls that
[2:00:23] have been reinforced and that's what
[2:00:24] satan does is he's pointing you at one
[2:00:26] thing he's pointing you to the walls of
[2:00:29] the prison
[2:00:30] but you know what he's not pointing out
[2:00:33] there's no locks
[2:00:35] because what jesus said i have what the
[2:00:37] keys have death
[2:00:39] hell and the grave
[2:00:41] so whatever the s that satan is trying
[2:00:43] to tell you you have that you can't get
[2:00:45] out of what's he doing is he's pointing
[2:00:47] you to the thickness of the bars on the
[2:00:49] door that jesus christ has already
[2:00:51] unlocked
[2:00:52] remember brother adam told the story of
[2:00:53] that guy that was going to be killed and
[2:00:55] and his mother appealed to the president
[2:00:57] i think it was abraham lincoln i don't
[2:00:59] remember for sure don't hold me to it
[2:01:00] and abraham lincoln said yes i'll do it
[2:01:03] and he and he did what and he brought
[2:01:04] the pardon down or he gave the pardon
[2:01:06] and the guy came down he says you're
[2:01:08] free you're free and he says i don't
[2:01:10] believe it i don't believe you're the
[2:01:11] president i don't believe this or that
[2:01:12] and so they took him out and they shot
[2:01:14] him and it went to the brother graham
[2:01:15] said it went to the court and and they
[2:01:17] found that if you don't accept a pardon
[2:01:19] as a pardon then it wasn't a pardon for
[2:01:21] you you have to accept what's been done
[2:01:23] before it can be a parted the fact that
[2:01:25] they had a pardon for him didn't matter
[2:01:27] if he didn't take the pardon that's what
[2:01:29] brother i'm saying is he's saying if
[2:01:30] you're looking at the prison doors
[2:01:32] rather than the one that's standing
[2:01:33] outside saying you don't have to stay in
[2:01:34] there then you'll stay in there
[2:01:37] but he says he's already unlocked it
[2:01:39] there's no more locks there to hold you
[2:01:40] in all you have to do is swing that door
[2:01:42] open he says all you got to do is accept
[2:01:44] and believe that what he says is true
[2:01:45] and then you walk right out of that pit
[2:01:47] you walked out of that prison cell you
[2:01:49] walk away from where you've been tied
[2:01:50] down for so long amen
[2:01:53] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[2:01:54] jesus said and that day
[2:01:57] is still today
[2:01:58] it wasn't just 2000 years ago but it's
[2:02:00] still today this scripture is fulfilled
[2:02:02] that he came to set the captives free
[2:02:04] that he came to provide every blessing
[2:02:06] every redemptive promise that he paid
[2:02:08] for us at calvary is available to the
[2:02:10] believer here today amen when the holy
[2:02:12] ghost was given on the day of pentecost
[2:02:14] he opened up what the path to a hidden
[2:02:17] life that david had written about and
[2:02:19] cried and sought for all of his life and
[2:02:21] never found it amen we have what david
[2:02:24] always wanted
[2:02:25] we have what abraham always wanted we
[2:02:27] have what noah always wanted we have
[2:02:29] what solomon always wanted all these
[2:02:30] different ones he's given us a place to
[2:02:32] come into that hidden life where what
[2:02:34] all chains are broken
[2:02:35] all complexes are delivered from us
[2:02:38] right where we can walk in newness of
[2:02:40] life where we can leave our history
[2:02:42] behind us listen if rahab can do it
[2:02:44] without the holy ghost what our believer
[2:02:45] to be able to do today amen to leave our
[2:02:47] past behind and get married to a great
[2:02:49] captain

[2:02:55] fellowship that takes you into a
[2:02:57] heavenly place that makes you not just
[2:02:58] believe the word of god but live the
[2:03:00] word of god

[2:03:27] people he says lay your hands one on
[2:03:29] another and he'd say that's it
[2:03:31] that's what we're looking for not one
[2:03:33] man doing it he says but a body of
[2:03:35] believers joining together in faith
[2:03:37] under the unity of that word and he says
[2:03:39] when you lay hands on one another he
[2:03:40] says then people will be healed
[2:03:42] that's what we're looking for is a unity
[2:03:44] of the faith amen until it takes us all
[2:03:46] the way into a rapture and let's just
[2:03:48] bow our heads together if we would

[2:03:53] paid
