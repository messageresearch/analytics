trust him we are a sanctuary a man and that he dwells within us it's the only way he's going to get there if you're a predestinated sanctuary through the power knight of the holy ghost so we trust by grace that god saw it and god brought it to pass amen god made it made it a reality by the grace of god so lord bless us to be in prayer for the going forth of the word and surely we're not going to be able to get all that i want to say and when it comes to the scriptures and some of the thoughts and the quotes by brother branham so i want really what are you going to talk on well i'm going to try to bring us some thoughts on whether we're religious or spiritual amen and again there's lots of religion but how much says they're spiritual in our lives or in the world and where we're living there we get a lot of people sometimes we meet a lot of people in our lifetime they're very religious but not very spiritual so we pray the grace of god that we're going beyond religion to be spiritual and the problem of god delilah he said the church is religious and the church is religious but he said they're not spiritual and lord willing we'll try to give you some thoughts on that as well concerning what the prophet has said and he did preach on adoption and he was bringing out those things in in that series concerning the church versus people the church versus the seed of god amen and he did say again he said that the church is religious and i'll tell you this it's unfortunate that uh that too many believers around this message have gone from being spiritual to religious oh yeah they're very they can be very religious but not very spiritual in their understanding not very spiritual in the leadership they have in their lives so we pray the grace of god to give us the understanding that that assures us that we are spiritual amen we're spiritual in our in our hearts and our souls and if we are we'll be spiritual in our thoughts words and deeds amen so god be with us and help us that we will be and get more and more spiritual the closer we get to the rapture and the resurrection that means you're getting more spiritual amen it's as it was in jesus day he was dealing with a lot of religious people you know the jews and so on but there were not many very spiritual i want to share with you there's a lot of scriptures and i thought well i maybe i'll i'll meet uh brother jonathan garlett's uh thoughts and ideas and maybe i'll be i'll be like him because he was bringing out a lot of scripture and that was good amen read this scripture read that scripture that's good amen because faith comes by hearing the word amen so we appreciate our brother's ministry amen putting the emphasis on on the word of god amen and whatever he thought he's going to minister on and as ministered on you want to prove it by the word amen there's one thing there's one thing to to know about what god is saying in the message of the hour again like these here and so on or the prophet said the prophet said but we better find it here amen because his ministry was ordained to get us back to the word amen and in the word we're going to get the faith that god wants us to have in this hour oh brother it's not just back to theology and doctrines and this teaching of that teaching no it's back to the word that's ordained of god to give us the faith for the resurrection and the faith for the rapture amen so to god be the glory we appreciated our brother jonathan's ministry and there was a lot of word word word word a lot of scriptures and i said well lord i guess i'll have to share share the a lot of scriptures with the people amen and i saw continue on i said from where our brother jonathan started amen and i don't think he'll ever be finished here it'll be finished in eternity amen but in our brother's ministry i really appreciated the reading of the scriptures coming to the scriptures coming to the scriptures and then brother yes it's good that we can get back to the quotes amen showing that god a man through the prophet amen preach what was needed to get us back to the word oh yeah he preached what was needed to get to give us what to give us resurrection and rapturing faith to preach what was needed to give us the faith that pleases god brother not not even wesley pentecost and all the others no no but it's the brideage amen god did that for luther that for wesley that for the pentecostals and many others out there but what's he doing for us brother whatever whatever is next in line amen he said i will restore so he restored this restored that restored this restored that now what's he restoring amen in you and in me amen i trust that our lives are going to be a reflection amen not a religion but of spirituality amen a reflection of the power knowing of the holy ghost taking control of the bride amen praise the lord so the lord bless us as we go into the word but also want to just express my appreciation for brother jonathan and the ministry that he shared with us amen to god be the glory and as i said let me say it again that i really appreciated his emphasis on the scripture amen and leading us from to the to the word leading us to the word the written word and uh well yes then then he would go and point us to the revealed word amen so god bless our brother and we certainly would appreciate again aaron our brother's ministry so we thank the lord for that amen and uh god bless oh god sister selena uh oh anyway i appreciate it or singing and i believe god was in it amen oh yeah because it went from her to you amen the anointing praise the name of the lord so also just to uh bring you greetings from our brother carr and it was uh almost two weeks ago now that he called me and i spoke with him and he was explaining the what they're dealing with concerning colbert 19 and at the time i don't think they're having much when it comes to the services in the church and because of the issue there and we know that it has increased since then and in new brunswick so we pray the grace of god to our brother carr and sister carmen because other sister but brother carmen because they brother as i said by the car ministers on sunday but by the carmen ministers on wednesday so we pray the grace of god to them today and what they're doing exactly i'm not sure maybe they're not even in church today because things are sort of getting worse in new brunswick so we pray the grace of god to our brother carl and to the saints in new brunswick amen and also uh to remind you uh concerning you see brother after i finish ministering here i did offer him the possibility of ministering or not coming to minister but just to come before i preached but then we change the two after i preach amen brother paul after i finish the message brother paul is going to take a few minutes to explain to you concerning some things regarding the business meeting on monday night amen so he wants to share that with you and that's good you can take maybe i said you can take an hour before i get up amen so he can take as long as he wants he said five minutes well that that's almost impossible for a believer you know to get up and just just give a five minute testimony no no what we thank god that he's given us the grace and the wisdom to know what to say when to say it because again as i spoke with him last night and to a point of time either before me or after me and i said yeah i said i've been in churches i said if you're going too long maybe we'll sing you down and because i've been in churches and and in testimony meetings oh yeah and i've experienced that in in the church i was raised in in the church i went to pentecost and the salvation army and i've experienced it even in a message church and where many got up and testified and they all preached yeah they were sit standing there but they were preaching and brother in in the denominational churches i was in i do remember the experience of somebody in in the congregation doing what you're going to sing them down oh yeah whether it's salvation army or pentecost and they preached they testified testified testified then all of a sudden some brothers sitting in the in the church we start singing amen amen praise the lord so we won't do that to brother paul no yeah so so thank god for the for the grace and the patience that amen yeah he said you have need of patience and i guess the churches have sung down the testimonies they never had the patience amen so thank god and again i know i can remember it now i was in a church and and a denominational church and her brother got up and testified testified testified and then he sat down and the pastor got up the preacher got up and he said praise god he said well a double he used his gun he said a double barrel and he said double a double shot he said he had he didn't shoot once he shot twice he said he had to go that long in his in his testimony amen so but again again like i said i've heard it being sung down and uh and there are again i guess believers that would sing down they're going for the word and they feel it's that's enough so they'll they'll sing down to preacher but i haven't i haven't seen that in the message thank the lord maybe i'll be the first one amen so the lord bless us let's stand so and now we are being prayed for brother ellsworth he was here last week and he'll be here again this week on uh he got an appointment with the doctor at sinclair's hospital on thursday and he's to have surgery for his voice box because there's something in his voice box and it's affecting the sound of his voice and his his voice is very low and that's not normal from brother ellsworth amen so he's going to have a surgery on thursday so be in prayer as our brother returns back to saint john's it was a week on friday that he left and or saturday that he left and went back so god's grace to us amen god help us listen only believe all things are possible only baby believe all things are possible [Music] only only be amen amen praise the lord hallelujah only billy amen [Music] jesus is here g amen hallelujah thank you lord amen

faith to believe what you are revealing amen praise the name of the lord the mystery of god the lord so glad that we're moving on and on and on into the revelation of the resurrection into the revelation lord of the rapture amen the getting out of this world and into the kingdom of god hallelujah praise the name of the lord truly lord the real bride is angling and thirsting for eternity the true bride is angry and thirsting lord to get out of time and into eternity hallelujah the true bride is angry and thirsty lord to sit with you in your throne amen to be part of the marriage supper of the lamb amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah so the grace of your presence with us in us and around us the grace of your presence in this assembly the grace of your presence with the bride of christ around the world amen amen amen hallelujah lord we know that it's getting less and less and less but we trust oh god no matter how long it goes that we'll be numbered with the few amen that are being caught up father alleluia in glory being caught up into the revelation of the word being cut off alleluia into the kingdom of god blessed be the name of the lord so lord your grace that you will have control lord of this service grace that you'd have control of the ministry grace should have control over the saints that are hearing the word of god amen amen that we will be absolutely amen that we will be spiritual amen with the holy ghost spirituality father not just religious but spiritual hallelujah that you in control you're leading your teaching you're revealing amen hallelujah father and you're getting us to surrender amen to the word getting us to surrender to what you have done hallelujah to get o lord to surrender to what you're doing amen amen amen i trust will not lose the revelation father of the resurrection i lose another rapture amen amen knowing that you've done all this done this done this done this and so glad to know that you are doing this concerning the rapture and concerning the resurrection oh my lord i pray grace and lutheran into what you gave him wesley entered into what you gave him the pentecostals hallelujah giving the glory to god amen father in receiving the reality of the revealed word albus will give you the glory the honor of the praise and lord enter into the reality of the revealed word the reality lord of what you have revealed what you have manifested amen glory hallelujah that we'll go into the reality of the resurrection go to the reality of the rapture amen the reality of father not of time but of eternity and lord i am with lord every hour that we need to get out of here this is the hour amen so grace grace grace forgive us of our sin forgive us of our unbelief forgive us of our doubt and we pray in the name of jesus lord to increase increase increase our faith through the revealed word amen increase our faith so that we are reaching out for the resurrection we are reaching out for the rapture we're looking up amen praise the name of the lord knowing father that those who've got the revelation will look up amen that they are looking up amen will receive the hallelujah will receive the purpose from which we're looking up the rapture oh lord o lord has been in your word for all these years but now we have come to the fulfillment amen that we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen in a moment in the eye and caught up to meet our lord jesus christ hallelujah thank you jesus so we pray the grace of your presence to come with us into the word amen to face the challenge of the word amen to believe the word amen with a complete belief so that we come to that place where there is no question and there is no doubt we believe amen so father grace unto us soul body and spirit

i believe now i be amen [Music] all things are possible [Music] now hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah now praise the name of the lord hallelujah now let's express our faith amen we believe [Music] possible amen praise the lord just before you be seated turn with me to to third john third john and we'll read the first four verses amen praise the lord amen god make it more and more real to us concerning the resurrection amen that's that's that's what's ordained to take us out of here amen and the rapture so i pray god amen as as much as luther focused on justification and the pentecost and the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost let us focus on the resurrection and the rapture amen and the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen god make it real to us and in third john and verse 1 the elder unto the well-beloved gaiest whom i love in truth beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in elf even as thy soul prosper amen what we're experiencing naturally will be a reflection of what we have spiritually for i rejoice greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth amen what a testimony and he said i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth amen and the truth is the revealed word amen god bless you may be seated and turn with me to colossians chapter 1 amen colossians chapter 1. and i want to read the first few verses and i was thinking maybe that brother had referenced to maybe verse 9 we'll see we start with verse 1 and i have a number of scriptures here that i want to share with you about concerning being spiritual amen not religious but spiritual as the prophet of god said he said the church is spiritual and not spiritual he said the church is religious but the bride is spiritual amen so be in prayer as we go through the scriptures and i'm not sure we'll get into the messages on spiritual amnesia or the spiritual food in due season we'll see as the lord leads us amen but brother we pray in the grace of god that we are spiritual not religious religious when it comes to being religious all you're going to all you're going to walk in is is what's going to happen on a wednesday night or on a sunday oh yeah we go to church on wednesday we do this we do that and we go to church on sunday you're just being religious but if we're spiritual we got a hunger and a thirst for fellowship if we're spiritual we want to hunger and thirst we want to go to church we want to be in church as the proud of god he was noticing the difference and now that was moving away from the people he said there was a time he said when we would leave the service he said on a sunday or whatever and he said he remembers seeing the believers out there outside the church and they were and they were hugging one another and they were crying and so oh my i won't see you no more now until sunday i won't see you no more until wednesday oh and why because they wish that they could see and fellowship with another more and more and more and brother if we got the holy ghost i'll tell you it's a hunger for for jesus it's a hunger for god it's a hunger for his word and it's a hunger for fellowship amen that you want to fellowship with your brothers and sisters in the faith amen so i pray the grace of god that will not lose that kind of anointing in our hearts and in our souls that we're not going to move from the realm of being being spiritual to the realm of just being religious amen and religious only oh you can be religious and you can talk about this doctrine and that doctor another doctrine but i tell you this it's going to take being spiritual to get into into why god has revealed all these things amen it's not just for the sake of doctrine it's not just the sake of this and that for the for the ministry oh yeah yeah no it is to give us faith because faith comes by hearing the word amen it's like i mentioned a number of times that that's what god gave luther and to give him the faith and the revelation of justification because again he thought it was something that he had to do but then god brought into the word to show that jesus already did it amen praise the name of the lord and same thing in in wesley's age same thing in the pentecostal age jesus already did it amen but he's moving us on to a greater revelation amen by the grace of almighty god amen so i pray god by grace is moving us on to the revelation that we need amen brother we we thank god for the revelation of this doctrine that doctrine but again what is god working on in this hour what is god working on in this age amen what was god working on in the ministry of william branham and just just to think that there i don't remember i don't think i don't know of any other minister saying well i only got three polls to my ministry i i i got to do this i got to do that and i just waiting on the lord to see what he wants me to do because i know that other evangelists are there and brother rem was doing evangelistic work but any and he went on to a certain certain time evangelist evangelist event then he left evangelism and went into the revelation of the word a prophetic ministry but then after god was finished with a prophetic ministry amen it was it may be december 1963 or 64. the problem of god said now he said here i go he said back into evangelism amen he went and he did the first poll the second bull and amen his ministry changed in the third part in the revelation of the word the mystery of god amen and then after the mystery of god he went on he said to evangelism again amen but brother amen but brother god's not looking for a change in you and me like that no ways that we're looking for an evangelistic ministry we're looking for this kind of a ministry that kind of amen no no the bride don't need that we need we need the teaching a teacher's ministry we need a pastor's ministry and so on what for amen though all the other ministries have done what god wanted them to do now he wants us that ministry to come on us to teach us amen what we need amen a brother that came down and gave luther what he needed wesley what he needed the pentecost was what they needed amen so what do we need now because hallelujah god said i'm going to restore i'm going to do this i'm going to do that amen if he's done that brother move on amen that's another step as an you know move forward keep your eyes on the door amen as i said he said he openly opened the revelation so that we can we can say in the glory we can see into eternity we can see into the kingdom of god so don't don't go aside this way that way no stay in line amen by the grace of almighty god amen now again it's like brother had division concerning that that sister or you know brother brown was standing at the three steps he had three pulls to his ministry and he was standing at the three steps on the third step would take him up all glory amen take him up to the road that they need to walk to get into glory amen and below you know below was all this fire going on the judgment of god and this woman you know if she wanted to do this you wanted to do that and the brother the prophet said walk up these three steps amen that god wants to do this in you and you're with you now he wants you to do this amen he's giving you the word why god give us the word amen to let us know what he wants us to do to let us know what he requires of us so that we can walk in the light as he is in the light and he is the light amen by the grace of god amen it's not just to go off on this and go off on that no no it's all everything that god has revealed it's our day to keep us in line amen don't don't leave the straight and narrow way so what god has done what god is doing amen stay in line keep your eye up there don't don't keep your eye there amen and the the enemy is there to tempt you the enemy is there to distract us he is there to get you to do this get you to do that follow this anointing follow that anointing brother you ain't and what what are you what are they doing they become religious but not spiritual amen if you're spiritual you're going to recognize what god is doing you're going to walk and keep keep your eyes on what god is doing you're going to keep your heart on what god is going to keep your mind and your and your soul your spirit what god is doing amen we're not going to just be religious and and do this and do that i feel to do this i feel to do that amen brother what we need is the uniting to give us direction and to give us leadership amen and brother we got the true anointing we're going to stay with the word and we're not going to oh yeah the the preacher the prophet preached this so we'll go off into that we'll go off into that and become the denomination oh yeah there are many denominations around the message amen and they have this and they have that as i said and it's coming to that place now where where they said oh the the founder of our religion with luther the founder of our religion was this brother and that brother in pentecost and and i said yeah it's getting to that place around the message amen oh this is our religion and the founder was william branham brother brother god never sent him to give us a religion amen god sent him to give us the spiritual revelation of what god is doing what god did do and is doing and will do amen brother there's no other ministry that came with that revelation no other ministry came to give us such a revelation of the mystery of god and to go back to eternity and to come on down to time amen and to show amen to show amen down through the ages to throw that god as through the ministry but keeping us in contact with eternity hallelujah hallelujah brother it is the prophets amen on into the into the faithful ministry amen what is it ordained to do it is ordained to keep us focused on eternity amen to get us focused to get back where we come from amen not just not just oh yeah oh you're good you believe it and so you're going to go to church and hear it preach you know every sunday or every wednesday whatever no it's you that god's working on amen and coming into the church in the ministry is god ministering to you more and more and more of what he requires of you amen he's ministering to you more and more what you need amen you got to recognize what you need and brother we got to go beyond natural needs and physical needs to our spiritual needs because too many are still focusing on the natural oh lord lord if we do this you do this you do this we'll do this and so on brother god wants you to focus on what he's doing and what he will do because why because he wants to use you to do it amen he wanted to use martin luther to do it he wanted to use john wesley go and preach it and live it amen bring into the pentecostas go preach it and live it amen and move on move on move on but unfortunately that third or fourth generation that settled down and went into denomination they were oh yeah they just felt that we're worth we believe that thank you lord amen we believe what luther said and that was it but they never realized god was moving on amen they thought god was going to stay with them no no god was going to move on and god wanted them to stay with him amen not god stay with them and keep blessing him and there's the time when god has done that but brother there's also a seed that he's moving on amen amen so there there were some lutherans that did move on to wesley and there were some where wesley people meant bride revival you're not right but wesley revival individuals have moved on to the pentecost and as i said let me say it again praise the lord just to show that god was in control not man brother when you consider that william booth and and and even his wife when she preached they both preached amen what did they do they fought they focused they were pointing us to pentecost oh yeah they not did not there was no recognition of a pentecostal church then but they were showing what we needed was what they had on the day of pentecost amen well brother thank god he gave it to us he gave it to he gave us justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost amen but now he's given us more hallelujah oh yeah they took that the faith of that and they moved on moved on moved on giving god the glory amen amen and now brother are we moving on moving on giving god the glory for what he's revealed to us amen brother god oh my we can be faithful in justification you're gone amen brother just think no doubt there's many he says they're going to fall under fall and says to the mountains fall on us fall in us and hide us from the face of him that sits on the throne amen because they knew they didn't follow his teaching they knew that they they didn't follow and acknowledge his presence in luther or wesley or or pentecost and they haven't acknowledged his presence in the bride in these last days amen and now and again brother the importance is to what is to recognize what he is doing amen brother luther cut the revelation what he did what he was doing in luther's age wesley's age the pentecostal age amen they were caught up with what god did and was doing but now i trust that the bright is caught up with what god has done and is doing amen brother we got we got what the all the others had and we're moving on we got what they had we're moving on we're going amen amen you might as well say goodbye because any time now you could be gone amen but anytime now you gotta you gotta look up keep looking up and i'll tell you that's the only ones that are going we should not all sleep but we should all be changed and the only ones are those who are looking up and they're looking for it amen they can't get it out of their hearts they can't get if you've got it in your heart you won't get it out of your mind you got it in your heart you're spiritual in your heart you'll be spiritual in what you're doing and you're in your actions reactions and your thoughts words and deeds amen brother so that the revelation controls you amen the revelation controlled william branham amen because after they owe me the seals he preached this he preached this and he preached that and he said this is just another revelation of the seals amen the mystery amen so that to the right is no longer a mystery no no brother we ought we ought to be walking in the light as he is in the light and if we are walking in the light as he is today brother then there's nothing going on in there that's a mystery to us we know amen because amen because what god has done what god has revealed amen is the omega of the alpha oh yeah god god revealed the alpha now in our our time he has revealed the omega ministry of our lord the omega revelation of our lord amen brother let's get caught up in that revelation amen and we're we're losing contact with the world amen definitely you're not interested in what the world's doing and what's going on in the world you just committed all to the lord move on amen by grace that's why that's why god sent the prophet down into hebrew and he had to get them to focus on god focus on on the promise amen and brother and god did signs and wonders and did this did that to get him out of egypt amen don't look back amen remember lot's wife amen brother i pray the grace of listen abraham was spiritual but but a lot was religious amen and lord's wife was religious amen because they weren't going to take the stand for the word of god for god that abram was taking that's right that is the absolute truth amen because why they were focusing on the natural things of life and whatever makes my life a natural whatever makes that life better i want that thank you lord thank you if that's all you want that's what he'll give you yeah and they'll take you to hell amen because you're not focusing on him and what he wants amen they're focusing on god so also god will bless my natural life got to do this and got to do that brother i'll tell you this your spiritual life is i thought about it i've been on my heart to to minister on it this spiritual walk amen oh my brother sister it's not easy amen no wonder paul said you have need of patience amen because you're going to go through tribulation you're going to go through this you're going to go through that you're going to you're going to have to endure this and you endure that amen if you stay with god and i'll tell you it's going to get worse and worse and worse it's gonna get more amen well god requires you're gonna get greater and greater amen the closer we get to the rapture why why is god allowing that because he wants us to look hope amen why is god allowing that because he knows that we need it to get us to focus on glory to focus on the word of god to focus on the resurrection to focus on the rapture amen grace of god that is not a fairy tale brother i tell you because if you become religious it becomes a fairy tale if you become religious it's just a doctrine oh yeah but brother god has taken us away from the religion to a spiritual walk with him why so that we know what's going on we know that the rapture is not up there the rapture is here probably god said rapture is going on all the time amen and the resurrection is going on we're just waiting for the hour when they'll appear to us and we'll seal amen praise the lord because as the prophet said they're only right there in that dimension amen so we need a faith to break through that dimension yeah but and to have a faith that'll break from from this dimension to that one amen we've got we got to really really really be turned over to the lord under his control amen so that again and again and again it's not me or you that lives is christ living in you amen and believing that oh yeah brother jonathan corlett he didn't minister to us it was christ ministering to us amen it was christ in the ministry ministering to you amen you can read that in the scripture concerning the faithful ministry amen that god has said in the church and if god's sitting in the church god is in it god is controlling it amen praise the name of the lord god help us that we're going to focus sincerely on the word we're going to really hunger and thirst from more of the word we're really going to feed on the word amen amen not brother not religion but spiritual the holy ghost let us be spiritual and not religious amen the scribes and pharisees and so on they were religious jesus was spiritual that's why jesus told them is to do what they say but don't do what they do you know take the word but don't take them amen because why because the spiritual walk became a religious walk oh it's all religion amen that and they're entering religion that they oh yeah you know what they were believing oh god's going to bless this god is going to do this god's going to do that but they never took in what god really wanted to do amen why because they never recognized their name they didn't recognize them the messiah coming to redeem them like jesus did oh yeah they they're looking for the messiah but they're looking for a messiah to come and deliver them out of the control of the romans amen that's right that's what that's what they were looking for oh if he's the messiah he'll do this if he's the messiah he'll do that no well jesus went on and preached and preached some preach till they did what he was to do amen and he let go lord not my will thyme be done amen why because if it was the will of jesus physically speaking oh yeah he'd have deliverance he'd have a great ministry and he have a great church and they have greatness amen yeah but it was great was god in simplicity amen they never recognized god in simplicity and really even the disciples didn't recognize it until after he rose from the dead amen praise the name of the lord well they were they believe you messiah and he would do this and he would perform signs and wonders and oh my give them this give them that but he had to do it by laying down his life and pick it up again he had to let down for them he had to lay it down for us so he could pick it up and share it with us amen oh no he couldn't share with us unless he laid it down and picked it up again and what manifesting the power over the world the flesh the devil manifesting the power over death and the grave amen praise the name of the lord you like a song i was airing a sermon some sisters and a couple brothers singing one time and oh she said this grave will never hold me this grave is not going to keep me back they can't i don't care and she says what grade what grade what grade any grade will never keep me amen i'm going by the lord amen amen praise the name of the lord and again to give you understanding that they're not up there in the in the in that earth no no during doing another dimension amen because god said dust their out to dust your turn amen gone as as i was talking to a gentleman one time where they were digging a grave and and they dug it right next to another one and oh the coffin was rotted but they could still they could still see the form of a body there and then he said we're doing this all of a sudden he said that that body went down and he said down into the dust oh yeah i said dust there are to the dust shall root thou return amen so where was that person if he was right he was in another dimension amen fellowshipping with those in his age oh yeah the prophetesses say they will all get together luther's age wesley says pentecostal age and a bright age amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah god increase our faith brother we ought to be looking for that not just so all we're so enthused and so wonderful oh yes well just think we got the revelation of god we got the we understand the mysteries of god oh wonderful praise the lord thank god for the prophet yeah but what faith is he giving you that god is doing he did that in the ministry of the seals what's he doing what's the result of those seals amen is to get the attention of the bride for the rapture and the resurrection amen brother what a faith that god requires of us brother be far beyond what he required of luther furby earned whether he required a wesley or the pentecostals just think but there's too many i'm religious i i believe there's going to be a resurrection yeah there's many believers there's going to be a resurrection but that's right because they're the ones that are going to say oh after they see something else out there it besides colbit 19 after they see other things going on oh where's the rapture i thought there would be a rapture it says yeah it's already happened you didn't know it grace amen grace that we're not going to be that blind grace that we're not going to be that dead amen so that we don't be part of the resurrection and the rapture amen why because you're spiritually dead brothers i pray grace if you die physically good but make sure you don't die spiritually amen if you die physically amen they just put that old body into the ground and move on but you let that person move on to another dimension if they're going to be part of the rapture if they're going to be part of the resurrection during fellowship with the saints that have gone on god helpless amen and i believe and again i believe that most of those most of believers i believe they're gone on those that are going to be part of what god has done in this hour in this age those that are going to be part of the resurrection rapture they're going on this is getting fewer and fewer and fewer i'll share i want to share some of those thoughts with you the prophet warning us he warned us concerning what's coming that should put us on our guard amen not to give us a religion and think that we're all right because oh well we got we got the revelation the mystery of god and and we know god sent the prophet and he did this and he did that oh yeah but then the prophet preached to his own church three kinds of believers he preached his own church there's only going to be a few going into rapture now amen but he knew also that he had to leave he would go before and knowing that in his generation he said to our brother lee vale he said brother he said most of the old folks around this message will die before the rapture before the resurrection he said because they won't have that faith he said for the rapture they won't have that faith for the resurrection he said god is going to take them before that time this that's grace amen grace brother is grace that's it's like a certain sister was singing amazing grace before she sang it she said i want to sing amazing grace but she said i want you to know she said grace isn't there just to give us what we want what we want what we want you know grace is not just there you know i'm here to favor so god can do anything noise of grace is there not to take away the trial but to take us through the trial amen she said there's those that think oh grace they'll take away the trial i'll take away this take away that no no he's going to take you through it that's grace amen that was the young sister that she was a black sister and she's saying amazing grace i'm not sure how long ago it was when when uh when that one of the akife aggies players whatever and then there was that accident that a number of them was killed yeah and so during the memorial service of those that died they they asked her to come and sing amazing grace sing and she said i've chosen making amazing grace and i want you to know what grace is for grace she said not to stop it grace to take us through it amen i did send her an email i said god bless you i said you were right amen that's that was tremendous amen so brothers not take advantage of grace or to have the wrong idea of grace oh well this won't happen because of grace that won't happen because of grace grace is there to take you through it grace is there to give you the victory for fighting the good fight of faith amen amen the too many think grace is there to change it grace is there to make it all easy that's all i got no worries i don't have to do this oh yeah grace is there to take you through it amen grace is there to give you patience as the bible says you have need of patience by grace amen praise the lord again we're colossians chapter one amen god help us to be sincere god has to be really honest tru with the word of god amen say lord i believe thank you thank you for what you've done and lord i i believe that you're accomplishing in me through that ministry what you want what you want to do amen by the grace of god now don't don't listen to prophet is gone so brother we don't have to look back look back look back no all we got to do is get back into the word that's right amen and again as our brother billy paul said take it and put it in the word what what the prophet said amen and brother that's the only way that we're going to have rapturing faith we take what god has done what god has revealed and take it right into his word why boy pardon the word so that we'll know we're not back here we know that we're up here amen we're at the end and this is the hour of the resurrection this is the hour of the rapture how many really want to fellowship with those saints that have gone on and the prophet himself did say he said i believe that maybe he said when we get to thinking and wanting fellowship with those that are going on he said i think we're getting closer to our own going yeah now maybe other journals like that because i'll tell you i'm longing for the fellowship of the saints who are gone on i never dreamed that we did i reached this place i never thought that i'd end up maybe committing a lot to the to the earth dust to dust yeah by the grace of god never realized that but now i thought and i said lord i said they were what how old they were now i'm that old and i said they're they're gone on and i said i'm longing longing for their fellowship online and thirsting for their love and their grace to us thank god god help us amen so in colossians chapter 1 and verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god amen so are you what you are by the will of god are you doing what you do according to the will of god not my will thine be done oh yeah we we we decide this we we oh yes we look at this and we look at the everything focusing on it yeah this this this this yeah i think i'll still i'll do this yeah okay and they think there's the lord when it's not now it's what you want to do to make your natural life better what you want to do to improve your spiritual life or not spiritual but your natural life oh yeah so good good and we want to say thank you lord no it may not be god it could be the devil look what he promised jesus on the amount of temptation he promised jesus this he promised jesus that amen and jesus rebuked them amen that should not tempt the lord thy god amen brother jesus could have done it oh yeah he could have done it but he didn't he was hungry because after three or four days of fasting your hunger is gone after 40 days your hunger returns oh yeah you get hungry and the devil knew that and that's why he tempted jesus to turn the stones into bread he could do it but he should though should i tempt the lord thy god amen and the devil sometimes is tempting us to do this do this you're a christian you're a believer do this and god will be with you no god don't want you to do it amen so brother paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and to timotheus our brother to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colossus grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you wonderful are you praying always for one another amen and it says since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints let's hear the scripture let's hear the word yeah can you really say yeah amen that's right brother that's right that's me yeah this is your your attitude this is your life that you're living amen this is the spirit that you're under causing you to pray for one another because it just automatically causes you to love one another amen live for one another amen so again in verse three we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always praying always not waiting until something happens we're praying always he said for all the saints amen always for you since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints and oh yeah can you say amen to that that you have a love to all the saints you love all the saints oh my you you you love their fellowship you love their oh what they're doing now they're doing it all good praise the lord god bless sister so and so god bless brother so-and-so amen grace brother this word is going to judge you oh yeah he's going to judge you and he said for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof he's as you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel which has come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it does also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of god in truth amen praise the lord you knew the grace of god in the revealed word by grace through faith are ye saved and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god grace yeah but what's faith it's the revelation of the word amen always just say oh i'm saved by the grace of god wait a minute you're saved by grace through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god to many as one saved in the grace of god to me and he gave me the revelation i'm saying yeah how do you respond to that revelation amen amen do you show appreciation for that revelation do you show appreciation for that faith you for appreciation are you really thanking the lord thank you jesus for what you did for me that i'm saved and lord i'm longing longing to get the glory so i can sit with you in your throne how many really want to see jesus god have mercy on us no wonder listen i pray god amen that we got a revelation he's our savior he's our lord but let's let's have the revelation that he is almighty god amen no wonder the prophet of god said as billy paul heard him one time prayed when billy went down to the office to get him and he heard the prophet praying he said lord uh excuse me lord for forgive me i'm sorry but i thought i forgot this when i was talking to you why because he felt that the lord was dealing with others oh yeah i thought lord when i was praying myself and i said lord oh my i'm sorry lord i know you're dealing with millions around the world i said they're all calling on your name so lord i don't mean to distract bless bless those that are calling on you amen amen and then i would continue to talk concerning my need brother since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which you have to all the saints amazing the colossians my they must have been a loving people they really had the love of god amen for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven where i've heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel amen which has come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit pray god's grace that it is bringing forth fruit in us amen and it's the fruit of the of the word amen christ in us as it does also in you and he says since the day he heard of it and knew the grace of god in truth amen the grace of god in the revelation of his will his word amen as ye also learned of epidural epaphras our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit if we got visitors can they go and declare unto others the love that they feel in this church amen amen that the love you have in the spirit for others yeah god have mercy i could i won't say it but there's a couple of things that visitors have said i said oh lord forgive us yeah grace grace yes lord grace to each and every one of us amen declare unto us your love in the spirit what what is what an anointing that this brother must have found in visiting this church for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you amen and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge or the full knowledge of his will not a part of it the full knowledge amen in all wisdom and notice and spiritual understanding so do you you got an intellectual understanding based on the mechanics of the word what about a spiritual understanding based on the dynamics amen is it the is the mechanical anointing on you that's receiving the word or is it a dynamic anointing on you acknowledging the word amen so brother let me read that again i'm not sure i believe brother jonathan might have referenced this scripture verse 9 for this cause also we also sense the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and the desire that ye might be filled with the full knowledge amen of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding brother we that's what we need when it comes to knowing what god is doing what god will do we need a spiritual understanding not intellectual knowledge of the message not the mechanics but the dynamics that's what we need brother whether it's your your pastor whether it's our brother jonathan here i'm registering the word regardless whether somebody could be testifying to you amen brother we we we need to be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding you need the wisdom of god and the spiritual understanding of god to catch the word lord are you talking to me lord is that for me to pay attention to lord help me to see me see myself in the word help me to see lord if i need to take correction from the word amen well we say oh just love me when love is corrected if you love a child you correct the child amen why because love is corrected amen so again this is what struck me i think the other night and i'm not sure if brother jonathan mentioned this scripture but i had it underlined in my bible but in blue so i went and got a red pen to underline it in red amen that it says that ye might be filled are you filled with the full knowledge of god are you filled with the full knowledge of his will for your life amen and not only that in all wisdom amen spiritual wisdom and spiritual understanding god help us that we have spiritual holy ghost understanding amen whether it's your pastor ministering with us brother jonathan ministering amen we need spiritual understanding not intellectual oh yeah anybody with intellectual got understanding they think this they think oh yeah yeah yeah but what was spiritual god help us and it says that ye might walk worthy of the lord and you need the wisdom of god and the spiritual understanding of his word amen that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing and beings trusted in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god praise the name of the lord so brother do you sisters do you have spiritual understanding do you have a holy ghost wisdom or is it is it natural wisdom natural understanding amen brother we need the holy ghost amen because the understanding comes through the holy ghost amen grace that we believe turn with me to first corinthians chapter 2. oh i think i've been an hour ah i must have caught it for brother jonathan so be with me because i there's another four or five scriptures that we got here so we won't get into the quotes some of the quotes for the lord willing maybe we'll do that on wednesday also be in prayer because i want uh to have communion and for washing again and i was hoping to have it again right at the beginning of this year but we'll see what the lord will offer us amen in first corinthians chapter 2 and verse 9 but as it is written eve have not seen or the eye rather the eye has not seen nor the ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him i like him love him considering what his love did for you what will your love do for him do we have that real love that he had so that what no matter what the issue not my will father thine be done i'll tell you this there's too many believers they just want their own will they want god to do this they want god to do that lord if you love me you'll do it he loves you but do you love him god have mercy on us brother brown said again he did quote this somewhere in one of the messages he said you he said most he said want god to do this god do that but he said they don't want to do anything for him no god heal me god strengthened me god encouraged me god do this god do that bless me here bless me there yeah what are you going to do for him but i if you really have the love of god and love for god no lord not my will thine be done no matter what the situation lord your will be done uh whatever you want me to do i'll do it what you don't want me to do i won't do so or just just grant me the revelation that i need so i'll be in your will praise the lord not many doing that no indeed grace of god to us amen love him love him with the holy ghost of love amen with the holy ghost love he loves you so he he's redeemed our lobbies amen he's perfected our love so that we love him back with the same love grace verse 10 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit search at all things yea the deep things of god amen for what man knoweth the sins of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god amen so we need the holy ghost to know the things of god we need the holy ghost to really know god amen we need the holy ghost to really have a fellowship with god and experience with him oil grace in the baptism of the holy ghost amen is christ coming in to take control of you so that you can truly say oh yeah as the bible says sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen so are you led by the spirit you control what you do when you do where you do it how you do it god help us amen no wonder he said straight is the gate narrows the way and few there be that find it straight is the gate narrow is the way and now again it's like that woman that went up those three steps justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost yeah and she started to walk oh she figured oh yeah i can walk there's no problem there the step was you know and the path was so so wide but she started to walk and walk and finally she noticed that this that it was getting more narrow not that it looked narrow it was narrow and that the more she walked and walked the mark the narrower the path came until i got to the place where should she oh my just so narrow she could barely walk walk and stay there and down below was fire yeah and she kept on walking but lost her balance fell into the fire god help us amen because it started wide maybe with luther or wesley and pentecost is getting more narrow now with this revealed word it's even more now god help us amen to be led by the spirit again verse 10 god hath revealed them to unto us by his spirit for the spirit search at all things yea the deep things of god amen for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the spirit of god knoweth no man but this but the spirit of god the things of god i'm sorry even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god amen now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god amen god help us do you have the holy ghost amen did the holy ghost control your living the holy ghost control what you do when you do it how you do it are you really in constant fellowship with god and he's there to counsel you he's there to advise you he's there to encourage you there to give you this understanding of his will grace we're coming that hour now not my will father but thine be done and again i heard on some article concerning what's going on in the world right now and there was a an article came out and they were saying this this and this was taking place in certain parts of the world i said oh i said lord we are really closer to the end than what we think because as i said you might go to go to bed tonight with money in the bank and wake up tomorrow with nothing and there was some article that i heard or seen or read and oh my i said they're going to do that to a certain area of the world right now and a couple of countries that were planning on doing this because when it comes to money and a lot of emphasis is on money right now that's why the our federal government was promising to to send payments for this payments for that pencil to help help the people that are suffering financially in their needs because of covert 19 and there's a lot oh i said lord it's not just the the seriousness of what went on out there i said in colburn 19 when it comes to the germ warfare but i said now i said it's getting right down to even to the money rather i trust it's not you that lives as christ living in you so he's going to have the right attitude and right spirit but brother i tell you this out there they're taking control it's later than you think amen don't make plans for great plans for our lives here brothers coming to an end and and that brother if all that's gone on now and is going on in the world i trust by grace and you see you understand that what we have preached for years is now coming to pass definitely it struck struck me when i was hearing that and i said what i said lord i said there's more happening now than what we think there's more prophecy being fulfilled than what we think yes brother we better keep our eyes on the lord amen i pray we want joy it's not money you want joy it's not your worldly concessions it's the lord it's yours today it's theirs tomorrow it might be might be theirs already but they haven't that's right but they haven't moved to to do this do that grace to us amen and again verse 11 what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god and to know the things of god you need the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god amen and it says which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth amen comparing spiritual things with spiritual amen i trust we have that anointing of the holy ghost to compare spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god that's true for they are foolishness unto him and neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned amen if you don't have the holy ghost in your soul you're not going to discern what's going on in the world amen you might see this and oh yeah this is happening that's happening but yet there's the more important things that's going to have a greater influence on you amen maybe you're not seeing that oh lord that's doing they're doing this they're doing that yeah yeah what are they doing to you god help us it's going to be so deceiving god have mercy on us amen excuse me yeah again verse 14 the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god now let's go back to verse 13 which says also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth what's he teaching you comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him and neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned if you don't have the holy ghost there's a lot going to happen and come to pass prophecy be fulfilled and you won't see it you won't recognize it but if you've got the holy ghost it'll put you on your garden on your toes but he that is spiritual judget all things amen yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath born who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ amen pray in that grace that you have the mind of christ you're going to see it as christ see that you're going to act as christ acted react to it as christ would amen that thus amen in these temptations what did jesus what was jesus attitude oh it's written oh it's written oh what about this he said it's written yes word keep quoting the word amen and sometimes we need to quote the word for ourselves amen stay with the word we have the mind of christ and i tell you a lot of believers don't oh yeah do you re you you manifest that mind is that kind of mind that people see in you or hearing you when it comes to what you think what you what you say your thoughts your words your deeds people watching is the mind is it the result of the mind of christ well if the mind of christ is in you you can't think your own thoughts it's going to christ thinking in you and you're going to react with christ in you you'll do this you'll do this yeah it's not you it's christ in you thank god amen this is serious i'm reading these scriptures because it's serious too often we just take it for granted oh yes people take scriptures for granted oh yeah they read it and go on they read it and go on no you need to read it and let if it's god in you and he's trying to convict you ask the lord to correct it ask the lord to make the word flesh in you amen and chapter three bear with me we'll have to bring it to a close and verse 1 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ do we have the maturity of sons and daughters to think and act like sons and daughters to talk like sons and daughters amen are we still babes there's a lot of believers there's still babes oh yeah he said i have fed you with milk and not with meat for other two we were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able that's the truth they can't bear the word not the bright can for ye are yet colonel for whereas there is among you envying strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men hallelujah oh lord grace give us the holy ghost that we rise above all of this amen amen so that the nature of my mom and dad is not in me in control it's the nature of amen it's the nature of jesus amen but too many are still going and they're walking living and talking like their mom and dad they're still still reflecting that nature oh yeah but if you're born again that nature is put down and the new nature takes over well that new nature is still there but you got a holy ghost nature that controls it amen amen amen thank god amen oh who do you turn after you turn after mom dad grandma grandpa who do you turn after i turn after jesus amen how many of us can have that can have that testimony that you that you're that oh yeah you're born of god whether you're born of god god's in you amen listen see why because when you're if you're truly born again the old nature is put out the new nature comes in amen and jesus is sitting in your heart in control and as i said and what there's a battle going on between the between your brain and and the soul between the brain and the soul the devil's in the brain doing this and god is in your heart jesus is in your heart oh yeah when the devil says this jesus brings up the word amen the devil says this again oh and again jesus comes up with the word amen praise the lord hallelujah and i think brother john said don't fight the devil just rebuke him with the word yeah it is written it is written amen if you want to fight him you'll never stop amen but if you give him the word you walk away and he's troubled but not you amen you got the peace of god that fasted all understanding amen praise the lord hallelujah so brother let's go and reflect jesus it was christ it liveth in me oh so oh if he's living in you you act like him you talk like him you react like him oh it's wonderful praise the lord that's why i that's why i think you're i've noticed that you you're a christian well by the grace of god amen praise the lord hallelujah so for ye are not for ye are yet colonel he's talking to the corinthians and paul dealing with the corinthians were dealing with a lot of carnality they were religious but they weren't spiritual amen and so paul through his testimony and through the ministry of the word that he was given he was trying to get them to move away from the carnality and put god in control amen not man and that's why he said ye are yet colonel for whereas there is among you envying strife divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men yeah you're still still got the attitude nature of us of a sinner yeah grace of god for while one saith i am a paul another i am of apollos are ye not carnal oh i'm a brother branham no he wouldn't want that he rebuked that for sure well i'm a brother son so i'm a brother so-and-so yeah and i've done over the years i've noticed you know i've been fellowship with this one fellowship with them fellowship with you oh lord i think they're under this brother's teaching none of that brother's teaching oh yeah god god have mercy on us that we're going to be under the holy ghost teaching amen brother brown would not want us to put him up he would not want us to exalt him no no he wanted us to exalt christ the word so who then is paul who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted a polish water but god gave the increase amen that were the result of god not of man amen by the grace of god to repeat first corinthians chapter 10 and i'll finish with this portion here and we have this three others but we'll leave that for wednesday the lord willing first corinthians chapter 10 and verse 1 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be now that all our fathers were under the cloud and all pass through the sea and we're all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased god knew their spirit god knew their attitude amen and for they were overthrown in the wilderness and there's many believers being overthrown in the world oh yes today around the world are being overthrown by false false teachers false prophets false ministries or that or the natural things of life that are being overthrown let god in you control your life amen now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted amen and they wanted wanted that which the physically they they desired to the point there they got to says well moses why don't you take it back to egypt because they felt like their egyptian life was better than what they have in the wilderness that's what they thought and brother grace unto us that will not stay in the message and then be entertained by the world no we got to walk a complete walk separation onto the lord amen and just understand all that came out were all baptized that all eat spiritual meat and they all drank the spiritual drink and so on but with many of them god was not well pleased many of them around the message did this did this did this did that yeah but with many of them god's not well pleased by their attitude their spirit their motives their objectives how many are truly dead to the world and alive to jesus amen now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also indeed lusted rather neither be idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play amen grace grace grace that we sit down during eating drink we'll rise up to worship amen and give the glory to jesus amen so that we become more and more spiritual and less and less religious by the grace of god remember that by the grace of god the closer that we get to the resurrection rapture the separation from unbelief will become greater by the grace of god amen god help us lord bless you let's stand the same

yes the help of all who find none other is so loving so good and kind he lives amen amen [Music] amen [Music] how i [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right everyone can be seated but this will again only take five minutes um so at the last business meeting that happened about a week ago we had a question for one brother that we thought was a good one it was about what was the proper approach to voting in terms of prayer and seeking the lord's will in terms of how you should vote this is not um you know our annual elections are not political elections we don't campaign we don't you know get funding we don't have campaign managers and it's uh you do it in a in a godly and sincere way so the whole point of today is just to bring everyone to the same onto the same page because we have a younger generation coming up we also have new people in the church from last year and it's also good to kind of reinforce why we do what we do otherwise they become traditions and we don't want traditions because traditions is we do this and we have no idea why so we want to eliminate that entirely it's the same reason why uh say with the kids like we've gone through tithing we've gone through communion foot washing all these things is because they may be ordinances but they're from the bible and there's a specific reason for them and typically it's for our protection for our good and it's good for us to kind of refresh ourselves in this area so this is going to be essentially that we're just going to go through why we do the annual election who's on the ballot we're not going to go obviously through specific people but the roles who isn't on the ballot and then what their proper approach is towards praying how you should feel led to vote and whatever so let's turn to acts six and verse one verse one and in those days when in those days when the number of disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in a daily administration then the 12 called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom you whom we may appoint over this business okay so within the church we have deacons trustees sunday school superintendent treasurer pastor and then there's various positions underneath all those such as song leader you know musicians we also have sunday school teachers but there's also multiple administrations helps people who are just you know we talk about the sisters cleaning the church this is just as important as any other position so in god's view you know deacons trustees these are not gifts and callings these are simply a appointments which you know we're not predestinated for before the foundation of the world to be a deacon but there is uh character that god brings to certain people to become those positions so it's important for us to realize that in god's eyes just because you have a position doesn't mean we have an elevated uh position over a regular church member in god's eyes we're all equal we're all sons and daughters of god and if anyone has an attitude that they're better than someone because of their position they shouldn't be in that position so uh so in essence the annual election for us is is an important uh means of keeping everyone accountable it's a means for the holy ghost to keep things in their proper order and it's a means for everyone to kind of realize that i need to be a servant to the people not a tyrant and it's to ensure that each and every person who's in their position will be mindful of who they're serving and how they should serve and you know you know whatever it may be so anything we do we should realize how important it is with the annual vote every year it's realizing that the holy ghost to the people is setting the church in order okay so in terms of who we vote on every year we vote on the deacons so the deacons will take care of people the trustees take care of things so the trustee takes care of the financial burden of the church they you know they balance the books they take care of the needs in terms of doing ebooks do we need you know equipment or whatever they they take care of the vision of the church from a natural point of view taking care of the lot taking care of the gardens all that stuff that is the duty of the trustee so the pastor doesn't have to worry about it okay this is all in order to lessen the burden on the pastor in terms of the deacons the deacons is there to to maintain order in the church they're there to take care of the needs of the people like we just read there and acts their job is to serve tables take care of the widows take care of the needy and you'll be there to help whenever it needs to happen so there is a great quote that actually brother john sent me about this in 1962 the key to the door the church is sovereign what the church says that's what the trustees is just a vote the pastor is just one vote it's a democracy of the church the sovereignty of the church the church in whole speaks that's all and we like that because we have no bishops or hierarchies or overseers or so forced to tell us this that or the other it's the holy spirit in the church that does the speaking i like that rule and it's very fine so if a major prophet can say that so should we so when it comes to the administration of the church the holy ghost will bring things into order and to it we want to ensure that the voice of the people is heard especially in these uh types of things so uh this year uh in terms of who's eligible for vote for uh voting the deacons so the three deacons uh myself joe and uh brother matt will be uh on the voting docket as for the trustees it will be brother chad from eric and brother bob um as we know every year we don't put brother gerald on there because when we began doing annual elections we decided we're not going to have brother journal on there after 40 years of service he has our confidence and you know i think he's past that so um so the treasure also is on the docket which is brother mark and the sunny school superintendent which is also brother mark um brother mark has a lot of hats so in terms of who we don't vote for we don't vote for the songwriter because that is on the jurisdiction of the pastor the pastor oversees the music which goes through the song leader and the songwriter matches you know the musician's musical superintendent which is a relief to sister kimberly so we won't be she never did like it so uh we won't have the sunday school teachers on it because the sunny school superintendent appoints the teachers it does it doesn't it won't come to the church for a vote if dad decides to go with say brother joe for a teacher it's it's up to the superintendent for that so the most important function is obviously how do we approach the vote in terms of the actual day so that will be next week next sunday we'll be having the annual vote so when we go to prayer about voting it's we again is not political okay church and politics should not be together we don't look at personalities we don't look at friendships we don't look at family ties especially in the church um but it's good because you know more often not we can kind of get into a routine and we can you know they're i guess they're there we guess we should just vote for them no the whole point is that each and every year we take this sincerely we take it seriously and we pray about it and the most important thing is that you get neutral because you know god forbids one of us has to be voted out that's going to be a hard thing but the thing is is that we got to follow the leadership of the holy spirit because we have to be obedient to his following to his leading and it's not up because for me it i because the way i approach it is that i can't think someone's not doing a good job of something which i don't think that but if i think that someone's doing a bad job i gotta trust that god has them there for a reason and that his motive and his objective is pure so that's why when we come to the annual election every year we got to take it prayerfully we got to pray through and we have to be neutral being neutral is really critical here because we got to realize that god wants to point each person in their position for the need at that time and each year that could change and it's not a bad thing so you know it we just have to approach her prayerfully sincerely and we just got to do the best that we can so it's not looking at the outward it's trying to find the heart of god for the matter at the time okay so in terms of you know when you're praying is that the most question most important questions are how does the holy spirit want to lead you in your vote it's really not your decision we're empty vessels and we need to allow the holy spirit to move through you to make the right vote are the people in question doing the job that they're required to do in this assembly okay and that speaks for itself look at the last year and ask do i like where the church has gone again are the trustees doing a good job managing the assets and the finances of the church are you being informed and updated what about what is happening in the church or you know is it this big mystery and there's no transparency and there's big conspiracy no no we don't want that are the children learning what they should learn in sunny school do you have faith in the direction the superintendent is taking things so these are just some some small questions just to keep in mind you know there could be a thousand more but it just the whole point is just to stop and pause and consider rather than just going through the motions that's what we want to avoid here uh if you agree with what they have done then you vote to continue to do the same thing in the coming year if you vote for each of these men that is you saying i will give you my support in the coming year and the other thing too is that once the the church body has spoken the renovation he didn't think they should do it they voted yes and he said okay let's move and that shows humility from brother brown in order to go in that direction rather than saying no no no i don't want it because i'm profit he didn't do that so we should follow his example then once the church is voted then it it is it is for each one of us now to support those voted in these offices this is you committing to say i will support these men as long as they stay with the word in the coming year it's not just a simple vote we are saying this is the direction we want the church to go in and these are the people we want us to take in that direction this year so the church has the authority but we're taking the this authority and divesting the control of finances over to the trustees and also the maintenance of the building and all the different assets that we have and it's also divesting control of what happens inside the church building to the deacons and also in terms of their different functions you're taking your authority and handing it over to them and and you're saying by the leadership of the holy ghost i'm interested and spiritually follow the leading of the holy ghost prayerfully consider where you want this church to go then make your vote so this is not meant to scare you but it's just to kind of refresh your minds and to realize that with each year the holy ghost wants to speak through us and it's god's way of keeping every all the checks and balances in place because that's the difference between us and other churches it's it's the the the the leadership conquering the lady and we don't want that here what we want is to follow the apostolic first church order that was put in place where the body is managing the body there's no big eyes there's no big you know leaders or whatever it's the holy spirit in the people keeping everything in simplicity and in his proper balance and order so when you approach the vote next sunday just try to keep these in mind pray about it and just follow the leadership of the lord of how you should feel you should vote and wherever you decide then we go from there so that's about it for the bobby if you want to come come up i am done it wasn't five minutes okay i'm humbled i'm very helpful as long as you don't sing down the singer the disarm service amen why do we stand for change of position after that and um let's sing 1231. it's a piece of god cover me amen praise the lord amen peace [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] cover me when i am [Applause] [Music] covered [Music] is
