grace of god amen [Music] that never shall run dry amen thank god for the river of the water of the word amen hallelujah all that we need all we would ever need is in the word amen praise the lord brother from the beginning to the end to stay with the word amen hallelujah so brother the thing of it is people just think well just this is just a history book no brother it's not a history book praise the lord it's it's it's a it's the council of god for all generations amen from from adam right on down to the last last generation brother praise the lord you want to know what what to do to please god read the word amen line up with the word stay in line with the word amen because brother in all generations god has been moving by his spirit god's been doing this god's been doing that brother and the thing that god requires of us is to is to come to the revelation of what he's doing amen line up with what he's doing stay in line with what he's doing amen have faith in what god is doing amen for and believe it with all your heart oh yes brother sister and this is this is the problem that really in a sense that god has had down through the ages is to get man to believe what he was doing amen why he was doing it what caused it where was it leading and so on and brother it's been a difficult task to get man from one from one generation to another and from one church age to another amen to recognize that the moving of the spirit of god god did this god's doing this god did that god's doing this amen but and again he's not adding to his word he's just he's just exalting his word he is highlighting his word he's revealing his word amen praise the name of the lord because where brother the word went forth and we know that there came in the dark ages but then god promised he wanted to restore he's not going to bring it back he's not going to restore it i'm going to do this i'm going to do that and so brother from from the the hour of luther and the time of luther the light has been began began to shine amen to give us a greater and greater understanding of the word of god praise the lord oh yes because man what happened it was the enemy it's right there in the book of revelation what happened and but then god said i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and he came back and he man and through luther and he began to reveal this reveal this revealed that oh yeah because there was a the generation they've been cut out with with with a with a denomination with organized religion and so on oh yeah but god said sent luther forth with a revelation to bring him up from under the control of man amen to the control of the holy ghost amen by the word of god praise the name of the lord not not believing man just listening to man no no you better make sure it's the word amen oh yeah god god has ordained the ministry to do this to do that but but again you're you're responsible you're going to you've got to check it with the word make sure it's according to the word of god and if it is stay in line amen with the word to god be the glory praise the name of the lord that brother that we have that revelation we have that understanding and brother if we didn't have that freedom we didn't have that anointing brother we'd be we'd be back there in some denomination some of you here maybe would be back at a in a catholic church somewhere others in some some other protestant denomination but thank god he gave us the light amen to do what for to walk in the light praise the lord walk in the light just just don't because why what what oh yeah even those churches they had a light but the light became dark oh yeah it became dark well because they made a denomination out of it amen but just walking the light looking for god to reveal more looking for god to add to his word not us for god but the enemy is there to take away from the word amen so brother i pray grace that we're going to stay with the word so the lord bless us listen and sing only believe all things are possible only believe only believe the word stay with the word amen because brother we're being judged by the word amen faith comes by hearing the word so i trust we have the faith that pleases god by hearing his word and brother not just hearing hearing this or that or something else but it's hearing what god wants you to hear in this hour in this age amen praise the name of the lord brother what we're believing now is far above what they believed in maybe a hundred years ago or what they believed maybe even two or three hundred years ago amen why because everything according to the scriptures according to the word of god brother what the light came but then it it went into the darkness that the enemy brought amen and but god promised he was going to restore and he started to restore the light the light the light amen to that fullness of the late is revealed to give us faith that we need amen and brother thank god we got the faith like luther did oh yeah but we got that we need we needed more praise the lord brother i tell you this so god and not not not us adding to the word is god revealing the word more and more of the word to us amen and when we begin to walk in light more light more light and until finally brother we're going up but then you look up amen why because we're we we're we're approaching the resurrection we're approaching the rapture and the rapture is going out of time and into eternity let's get out of here amen let's look up for the for the glory of god amen listen oh yes grace lord to believe truly believe the word but again let's believe what god wants us to believe now and again what god wants us to believe brother he didn't require that of luther he didn't require that at wesley he didn't require that of even even a generation of pentecostals a hundred years ago but he requires of us now oh yeah now he wants us to believe for the resurrection now he wants us to believe for the rapture because the hour before the resurrection the hour for the rapture is here amen we know that what god did god did god did this god did that yeah but now we got to recognize what god's doing that's right don't just go back and identify what he did what he did what he did thank you lord thank you thank you well let's thank god for what he's doing amen praise the lord brother to thank god for what he was doing for 500 years ago praise the lord we'd be justified we'd be sanctified but let's praise god for what he's doing now get what's he doing he's resurrecting us and rapturing us amen by the grace of god so god be with us in the going forth of his word to give us faith to believe god faith to believe what god's doing faith to believe what god will do amen do god be the glory amen only believe only [Music] oh believe oh we believe all things are possible only be me jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible amen amen because jesus is here hallelujah let's believe that jesus is here amen glory he said i'll never leave you and never forsake you amen i'll be with you even in you amen glory [Music] because jesus is here hallelujah lord i believe lord i be glory amen

that anointing amen through through the revelation of the word brother the anointing of christ in our lives and we are seeing this we're seeing this we're seeing that experiencing this in the world that in the world amen and brother we feel the same way jesus did how much longer lord we want to get out of here i wonder how many really want to go amen there's too many brothers that are too caught

be a holy ghost fellowship amen they need the lord so god help us brother sister to point them to jesus god help us to pray and commit them to the lord amen bro let's let's do it brother one thing one thing to do what god wants us to do but there's another thing to do it how we want to do it oh no but that's been a problem all to enjoy the scriptures god wants this god wants that and man says i'm going to do this because this is what god wants it but brother you got to do it god's way amen all done through man has come in and man has done this and under the influence of the devil and they're going to do it their way oh oh lord i'll do this for you i'll do that for you buddy you've got to do it god's way amen by the grace of almighty god oh yes so god help us i pray god in the name of

brother you'll get c see what the faith is brother god brings faith to that place where we get got to get closer and closer and closer to god we've got to get more and more into a into a more personal relationship with jesus so i know him he knows me amen and brother that i i can i know what he's what he he wants amen by the grace of god he knows what how to reveal it to me amen he knows what i need oh brother just don't don't don't think oh i'm a believer so i i go to church i do this brother you got to do it what god wants you to do amen good but you got to do it how god wants you to do it where god wants you to do it when god wants you to do it amen you got to be under his leadership amen and brother all through the scriptures oh there's been there's been the believer there's been the make believer don't worry with the unbeliever you know we know that they're going to go off but the trouble is to make the make believers that's that's that's that's the deception don't don't have a make-believing spirit have a true holy ghost spirit a true believer's spirit because why you're going to do what god wants you to do but you'll do it how he wants you to do it you'll do it when he wants you to do it you'll do it where he wants you to do it amen there's too many of us doing god's will well where when and how we feel to do it well i'll do this because god wants me wants me to do this but are you doing it how he wants you to do it are you doing it where you want you to do it are you doing it when he wants you to do it god help us don't think because you're in the message i can do this i can i can go here and go there i can do this like no no god's got to got that place predestinated for you to be to mature you to teach you amen brother to encourage you amen to feed you with his word oh yeah so to pray pray the grace of god you are where god wants you to be pray the grace of god you're hearing the word that god wants you to hear amen oh yes well i i preferred this preacher that preacher just wait now just one minute god the brother those that that are ordained to hear the word of god the way that their brother preaches it they'll be under his ministry god will bring him under his ministry amen and now god's got got you predestinated to be under another ministry and others under this ministry under that ministry amen god knows what he's doing amen the thing of it is man doesn't know what he's doing amen that's why you've got to go by faith the revelation of the will of god amen and sometimes you don't understand it all amen but i tell you god will bring in your heart god will give you that peace and that rest amen so grace to us brothers we go into the word amen to help us lord believe the word stay with the word and lord to recognize the word to recognize the word is god hidden and god revealed in simplicity oh we got to do it this way make a big big big no no no no brother when god comes and reveals his word is god is publicity oh they they when the prophet of god was out there with those signs and those wonders oh my the first poll the second poll oh there was there were many many many that were that were attracted to that ministry they loved that ministry of william branham they loved the first poll they loved the second pool oh my but brother when he began that what when he began to bring in the word with it he got to and and he had the gifts to get the people to believe the word that's what the angel told them now you're gonna be you're gonna have these three signs and and they should do this do this he said to get him to believe amen and they thought will and brandon would get up there and he'd just keep keep using the gifts keep doing this do it get use this sign this sign yeah and so on in the sign of the hand discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart oh yeah he got their attention did he give them the word oh oh no no oh we bet we believe that the signs that's god but he's teaching they didn't believe that was god but it was amen because the signs were just to get our attention to the word for the hearing of the word to give us the faith that we need for the resurrection and rapture amen brother all down through the ages god did this to give them the luther faith for justification sanctification the pentecostals the gifts of the spirit and the baptism of the holy ghost bring us in more and more closer to god and and more and more into a relationship with god into a oneness with god what for resurrection jesus said and brother what jesus said he wanted us to bring it out to that revelation i and my father are one amen bring us to the revelation of our oneness with god amen that we come from god we're going back with god amen we were with him in eternity before the foundation of the world amen oh yeah the bible tells us that god help us to believe brother that we're on our way back that we are as close amen to eternity as was adam and eve in the garden oh yeah because they they because of that that doubt and unbelief of eve they got they they had to step out of time and then i had to each eternity into time yeah amazing and brother now god is to get restoring our faith so that we're going to step from time back to eternity amen where adam and eve came from now we're going back and we're at that we're at that time now just think of it what oh lord look what adam and eve did oh lord and we got out of time out of eternity and we're in time and all of this unbelief all this doubt and oh we're got caught up with the physical body that we were born and so on yeah god permitted it for a reason but now he's given us the faith to go back praise the lord god help us to believe amen with a complete belief we leave no questions yet no doubt by the grace of god amen so god help us brother again turn with me deuteronomy 32. deuteronomy 32. and uh i want to remember our brothers in new brunswick in prayer and god bless them we've had fellowship with them i've had fellowship with them for many years and uh and i just had an email from our brother carmen mills there and he's uh i think he's brother carr's son-in-law but my he might be also by the car's assistant pastor there and he uh and he told me that brother carr is uh 92 years old and he's still preaching and he said he's he's he's active he said he's very on the goal i i i believe it knowing brother carr i believe it because even when i've been with him and he you know i i considered myself young and i considered him whole but brother he was as active or more active than me oh yes he was on he was on the go constantly and he's still on the go at 92 years old amen and i would say sister cara maybe maybe in her late 80s so god bless her she was active too so uh the the lord has really blessed them and so as i said brother our brother cara is still ministering in the church in new brunswick and i i believe uh his uh brother carmen i think that's his son-in-law and i think that that he ministers here too but i think brother car ministers twice during the week and brother carmen and ministers so god's god's grace to them amen oh brother but belakara he won't mind looking up he won't mind going up come on he's he's he's that active you know he's that active physically i trust he's dead active spiritually amen just move move move amen so again uh we we love the lord and brother carr did minister here some years ago you know so uh so i don't know if he'll ever be back here but if not we trust by grace we'll meet him in glory if he's that active here he'd be very active there amen well i believe that by the grace of god so god give us that faith to step out of time into eternity give us that faith that we're going from these old bodies to glorified bodies amen and that it will not be in any way be affected or influenced by by age no no we'll be back into eternity sons and daughters of god oh yeah and again oh brother sister in this world that we're living in where

you love mom and dad too and you love grandma and grandpa praise the lord god help us amen in deuteronomy chapter 32 and beginning to read at verse 9 for the lord's portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance he found him in a desert land and in the waste owling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye as an eagle stirth up her nest fluttereth over her young spread of the broad ur wings taketh them bear them on her wings so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him he made him right on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock butter of kind and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bastion and goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape but jeshurun waxed fat referring to israel and kicked thou are waxing fat thou had grown thick thou art covered with fatness and then he forsook god which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation amen they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods and brother as israel was guilty of this so there's the gentile world's becoming guilty of it amen god help us let me read it again again concerning jesus wax fat and kicked he said thou art waxing fat thou are grown thick and it says thou art covered with fatness and then he forsook god which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation god help us they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods don't lightly esteem the rock of our salvation our lord jesus christ and this is they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods yeah you're giving more preeminence to the natural things of life than to then to the lord god help us with abominations provoke the am to anger they sacrificed unto devils and not to god to god's room they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not yeah the more and more and more inventions rising on the earth god help us of the rock that beget thee the art unmindful and has forgotten god that formed thee oh my how many have forgotten what god has done truly in revealing himself through the message of the hour god help us brother let's recognize that amen because there's anything that god's looking for brother whether it was in abel and cain it was faith but i trust by the grace of god that we have faith that pleases god you can have wisdom you can know the word but yet not believe it the way that god wants us to believe it amen not to act on it the way that god wants us to act because again we were reminded of this and warned of this concerning wisdom versus faith amen and not referring just to the wisdom of man when it comes to all that's going on intellectually in the world but you can have you can have a lot of wisdom in the word of god amen you can know this the bible says this the bible says that but do you have the faith that it's ordained to give us you can have the letter of the word but what about the spiritual revelation of the word amen it strikes us in our heads but does it strike us in our hearts amen because faith comes out of the heart not the head because it is it is by the letter of the word in the mind that many are deceived it's the truth and we have been warned concerning wisdom versus faith oh yes and the wisdom is the intellectual knowledge of the word and you can know this you can know that the bible says this the bible says that and yes and maybe sometimes we're doing this or doing that but the thing of it is brother the thing of it is is we we believe what god wants us to believe but do we believe it the way he wants us to believe it amen but there's one thing to say i believe it god said this god said that but brother do you believe in the way that he wants you to believe it and the way that you need to believe it amen because if you believe in it just intellectually and ages becomes a doctrine it's just comes theology but brother you got to believe it in a spiritual way so that it so that it it's a part of your life it controls your life it controls your thoughts amen it controls your motives controls your objectives amen and the word because it is spiritual the word becomes leadership in your life sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen and the spirit of god by the word of god praise the lord so how are we going to know god's leadership is by his word praise the lord oh i'm led by the spirit i'm led by the spirit well brother sister can you show me in the word amen if you're led to do this are you led to do that can you show me in the word that this this is the will of god god wants you to do this god wants you to do that amen so brother sisters sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god led by the holy ghost amen and i tell you this it's causing us to line up amen with the word it's causing us to give preeminence to jesus it's composite because it will say man they let go and let god have his way not my will father thy be done amen but yet we're living in a generation where we're brothers and sisters and yes it's a generation that's caught up with with with their intellect as a generation caught up with with their education their gender cut out with this they're cutting with the inventions amen oh yes inventions that's why god said when he come he was going to destroy their inventions yeah because well israel got in trouble why because after a god delivered israel they went out and and they went this way and went that way yeah even that was kane's line right where you go right back to genesis and you'll find brother that abel who was staying with the word of god and he laid down his life amen for the sake of the word he wouldn't change but cain and the lord of cain they went out and they've invented this they invented that invented oh yes amen we'll we don't have time to get it right now we can go back to genesis right there and and see oh yeah this is what happened to abel but god raised up seth and that seth went this way but cain's line went the other way oh yeah and they got caught up with inventions they got caught up with the natural life amen whereas seth and his generation got caught up with the spiritual revelation of god amen god blessed them but brother god cursed cain and his seed so and then brother we're living in a generation now that has cut up more and more and more with the things of the world with the inventions of the world oh they're they they're they we can do this we can do this we're going to do that oh my never a generation that that saw what we are seeing never a generation experienced what you and i are experiencing when it comes to the inventions of man and they want to do this to please the flesh the flesh wants to do that the flesh wants to do that oh we like this and we like that this is good this is good but is it the will of god amen but again what we we could say maybe maybe what cain offered us as a sacrifice on his altar there amen oh that was good that's good okay that's good my you're a very generous king and yet like you said abel just offered just a lamb a dead a dead one what a dead lamb abel you're not giving nothing to god you give you give the lamb to god kill them yeah and well we thought maybe if he did that to us well we wouldn't be able to do anything with that lamb you know we'd have to go and bury it yeah we wouldn't be able to go in and maybe get get some more and replenish you and get more and more and more lambs no no see mccain never had the revelation abel had a revelation amen and brother i tell you this that as that revelation costs abel is life brother i tell you sometimes the revelation that god gives us amen because it causes many to lose their lives or and it does cost us our lives when it comes to the natural out here oh yeah we got to let go and let god have his way we're not going to live for the world like like maybe the family is living this way families living that way but brother tell you this it brings us a separation oh yeah because they do this but we don't do that we're not into that we don't have that spirit we don't have that anointing but for the for the generation we're living in especially now brother family friends neighbors who are there more and more they're caught up with what's going on in the world more and more they'll cut out with we want to do this we want to do that oh yeah this is good oh my wonderful concerning this invention that invention or or they're having this program and that program oh yeah and oh yeah more and more the devil is bringing things in to try to get more and more yes even so-called christians get caught up with it amen one time the christian all down through the ages brother they lived that totally separated life unto the lord amen but now they they they might go to church on a sunday on a wednesday but that's it the rest of the world they're going to live like the world oh yeah they're going to you know do what the world does and basically you know feed on the things the world is feeding on they want this they want that but no i'll tell you this the christian is if you've got the anointing of god in your heart your soul you're going to live a separated life unto the lord amen you have no desire for fellowship just out there or with this one with this one without no your hunger and thirst is for fellowship with the saints of god amen with brothers and sisters in the faith it's very rare that that we're going to get cut out with just family natural family or friends not like they did no no oh well there's nothing wrong with that it's oh yes but oh yeah why because they can influence you their spirit can get on you probably god said he said now he said he said their spirit can get on you he said but your spirit won't get on them if you're born again if you have the spirit of god or spirit of christ no no that's why that's why the the word of god brings separation amen because why because god knows the influence of that spirit of the world that's on them brother and all you can do is be a witness and and and reflect to them the life of god the life of christ amen oh yes thought word or deed and brother i tell you this if you're going to be very spiritual they'll they'll they'll stay separated from you oh yes it's not you separate from them they they'll just walk away from you you know some would be friendly and oh hello you know you're this you're that and so on well very good but they're not going to spend much time with you oh yeah no no we're going we want to spend more time with believers oh yeah we love that boy because we are we're that's not natural brothers and sisters we're eternal we're eternal oh my brother sister we're eternal yes we were born again hallelujah i praise the lord and i was with the lord back there you were with the lord back there amen well brother we love one another who want to fellowship with one another why because why to meet you is to meet jesus amen fellowship with jewish fellowship with jesus amen praise the lord hallelujah how much do you want to fellowship with jesus how much do you want do you love the lord amen oh brother i tell you that your everyday living is going to reflect jesus if you're born again amen amen you're not living by your natural things your natural nature as it were you're going to live by a spiritual nature if you're born again i i well before i was born again i would go and reflect you know well my my parents families or my father's families and so on and i would i would act like them talk like them or you know believe this and believe that and so on but when you're born again oh praise the lord now you're going to reflect your spiritual family you're going to reflect jesus amen oh yeah you're going to act like jesus talk like jesus you're going to reflect jesus amen you're going to be totally different amen and i've had witnesses over the years where people you know no knew that they knew you were a christian even even family members although they did didn't didn't hold it against me and i thank the lord for that or at least most of them didn't and uh when it comes to our stand for the word and our standard is they knew that we were different but they knew too that we it was because that our confession is christians our experience as christians oh yeah and even though even though some of my family members they were so-called christians of certain churches but again they didn't hold it against us just well lord bless you just move on amen thank you amen they still kept the right attitude and the right to spirit you got to keep the right attitude you keep a right spirit and they will oh most definitely amen but i've seen over the years i've seen where believers that have had a wrong attitude and a wrong spirit toward those up there as i've said i've seen them when i first come to this message and oh yeah there's the believers a lot of the believers i met oh they they were they were condemning this one condemn me that brother we're not going to condemn the them we will condemn the church we'll condemn the denomination but better not condemn them no no no no because some of them are jesus said some of them are my children amen praise the lord brother they they they felt you don't do this do this jesus said no wait some of them are my children amen and jesus would fellowship with with certain sometimes with ones that that that the disciples would never have nothing to do with they wouldn't have anything with them but jesus did why because he said some of them are my children amen so he kept his attitude he kept his spirit right he stayed with the truth amen and brother we'll stay with the truth but yet again no matter who we're dealing with we'll still you stay with the truth we'll still maintain our testimony amen but we'll keep a right spirit and a right attitude amen exactly brother thank god that jesus had the right spirit toward you and me and a right attitude for to say to save us amen so grace oh god ellis amen so that's what i've been preaching all down through the years is to encourage the believers to have a right spirit and a right attitude amen to those out there in in denominations oh yeah we just pray the grace of god to help them and deliver them amen amen because he did to us well we don't know again i got to highlight this because it's needed more and more and more where where the angel of god came down and and rebuked brother branham for what criticizing that sister this or the sisters and criticizing them because of the way that they were walking and dressing and had their hair cut and so on and and the angels said don't you do that he said some of them are my children yeah and i said over the years i've seen believers condemn denominational people oh yeah they were so they were rising up as they were judging them and condemning them and sending them to hell and so on oh yeah no that's the truth i didn't i didn't feel that was a right spirit or right attitude amen to have had no amen brother why because jesus said some of them are my children as i said they may not be bright but brother maybe they'll be outside the city keep your attitude right keep your spirit right because the blood of god did warn us he says you're gonna be surprised who made it and who didn't make it amen what do you mean surprise means no that person there you thought they would never make it they and when you get there they'll be there amen and there's there's gonna be others that you thought oh yeah they'll make it they're gonna make it man you get there they weren't there they wouldn't be there god why oh they were righteous no they were self-righteous their spirit wasn't right gratitude wasn't right amen keep your spirit right and your attitude right amen love amen amen amen if there's anything you've got to have you've got to have love praise the name of the lord by the grace of god because why why did god feel the way that he did to those people he was he was telling the the jews he said keep your attitude right keep your spirit right amen because he said some of them are his children and he loved them and he was care he was he cared for them and he was concerned for them god help us is there anything brother we got to fight anything we gotta amen overcome is self-righteousness there's too many self-righteous oh they think they're good they think they're this the things are that we're all sinners saved by grace amen don't don't go look and sing oh i'm good i'm this and i'm good good good for nothing yeah my father would if we said that back years and years and years ago when we were growing up good good oh i said you're good he said are you good or good for nothing he would always remind us the key was on our toes he said so he said make sure you know what you are. amen he said you may be good for nothing oh yeah oh i can see my father now standing there in that house and and and responding to maybe one of my brothers who said oh they're good and this is good and he always reminds us good or good for nothing amen so brother we were thank god we were raised raised with that spirit and that attitude as well amen even though when back in my early days when i was just a young boy my father used to drink and he had smoke and so on but then there came a time that he he he went to a church and he gave us turn his heart over to the lord became a christian oh he changed oh yeah he changed yeah and everybody recognize it amen and after that oh my anybody had any problems any needs any questions oh go they said everybody apparently in in the town we lived in they said go go see and they call him head to edly lush go see hedly he says don't worry he said he'll help you yeah now i don't know there'd be individuals come maybe in vehicles or whatever and they'd be parked outside and my father would have to go sit and sit in the vehicle with them oh yeah what for they were seeking his counsel and god's leadership in his life to god be the glory amen so pray in the grace of god rest his soul amen so brother sister the thing of it is in the name of jesus brother thank we need wisdom but brother we need faith wisdom is good and as knowing what to do but father faith is knowing how to do it amen so let's pray the grace of god that oh lord i thank you for the wisdom that you have given us in these in this hour the wisdom you given us in your word amen the understanding of your word but brother what about the faith to know yeah do we know what god wants us to do but do you know how god wants us to do there's many a believer today oh i believe god wants me to do this god see us like like baptism oh i got to be baptized maybe in water yeah but how does god want you to be baptized in water now amen that's why eventually you know we did go get baptized father son holy ghost but then god gave us the revelation in the name of the father son holy ghost and i and i i kept oh i said that's right and uh i kept repeating my in my testimony and i said oh i said you don't notice that too i said it's not in the names in ames it's not in the names of the father son and holy ghost i says in the name one name and so on and so i said there's one person one god i said not three i says not approval it's singular and so on amen so brother sister let's have the let's have the wisdom of knowing the will of god but let's have the spirit the revelation of knowing how god wants us to do it not just water baptism not just this not just that but your everyday living amen what is the will of god in dealing with this issue in your life dealing that issue in your life amen what is the will of god how does god want you to deal with it how does god want you to deal with your brothers and sisters in the lord amen see you've got to have his leadership again that's why we said sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god his anointing is in you is anonymous will you amen what for to give you the right thoughts the right motives right objectives amen and to give you the the right actions and reactions are you going to treat your brothers and sisters right that's right treat the believers right by the grace of god oh yeah keep keep and you're keep no matter oh yes according to the scripture no matter what you might think that they're guilty of that doesn't change it no they're still your brothers and sisters in christ oh no they're not destined oh yes they are oh yeah so keep your attitude right you if you got if you really got the baptism of divine love oh praise the lord you you don't control it it controls you amen and i tell you the world there's there's many a person out there that even denominational christians or non-christians they'll recognize it they'll recognize oh you're you're a christian how do you what do you mean oh we know you your spirit is so different and they knew that we weren't self-righteous they know that i'll tell you there's there's those out there that that know they they refuse your testimony why because they feel you're self-righteous because that's maybe the way that we might act don't do that then we might talk self-righteously no no you've got to humble yourself to the grace of god amen and if there's anything that that god wants you to reflect to them is humility holy ghost humility amen if you're born again i'll tell you this is any is any nature any any attribute that you're going to manifest is humility jesus humbled himself god humble himself and brother when christ come back into your life he humble you yeah god help us by the grace of god weather let's have the wisdom of the revealed word but let's pray the grace of god that we have the faith that it's ordained to give us as the prophet preached again in 1962 in it was during the easter easter i think 1962 wisdom versus faith because why because more and more people were boasting about the wisdom of god but they never had the faith of god oh yeah they oh they believed this they believed that but brother they didn't live the life they had the wisdom but not the faith brother grace of god that we what we have the wisdom of god we have the faith of god the first recorded message of the prophet the first recorded message is faith is the substance faith is the substance that god wants faith is the substance that god is recognizing in us it's not the intellectual letter of the word oh they know this they know that oh that you know they know whether there's one god they know about water baptism they know about this this just revelation that not revelation but this doctrine that doctrine amen no no what god's looking for that pleases god in you is faith it's a revelation in your heart not understanding in your head so are you living are you living the life you live are you living it out of your heart are you living it out of your head amen is it just physical or is it spiritual in your heart as the prophet of god has warned us he said you can have the holy ghost he said with you and over you around you 24 hours a day and he said and go to hell why because he's not in your heart to control your nature he's not in your heart to keep you humble and sincere and over the years i've met many a so-called believer many a so-called christian oh they had a lot in their heads but i tell you this they never had it in their heart no anything they lacked was humility brother if there's any attribute of a true believer it's humility humble yourself and the lord will draw near you amen if there's anything the bible teaches is humility the attitude and the attributes that god is looking for in us is humility humble yourself and again that's why many miss the revelation of jesus is because of humility he could have exalted himself just consider he was god in flesh and consider what he what he did yeah consider what he could have done but he didn't do it he did do this he did do that oh yeah and it was revealing revealing god in flesh revealing that yeah the ministry of the word in in in flesh amen our lord our savior or brother oh what he could have done he didn't do no no well he could do this yes he could are you sure yes if he if he couldn't then when he laid down his life he wouldn't be able to pick it up but if he laid down his life and picked it up again amen and went up into a rapture brother sister what could he have done when he was here just just with the disciples fellowshipping with the disciples in the flesh before they crucified him he had the power to do this he had the power to do that oh my brother the power that he could have manifested yeah he did any remember he spoke he had the spoken word he did oh yeah because of the the ones that he went out and he fed he fed so many thousand with just a few loaves of bread and a couple of fish huh how did he do that how did he do that spoken word he was god he multiplied it and when when he told the disciples gold and he said and feed them with this feed them when they said oh there's so many thousand out there he said well what do you got and he said oh we got just maybe five loaves or two fish something and i said go feed him i'll tell you something happened when they went to go feed them god must have been multiplying the fish brother whatever whatever they were in it when they go back there's more there there's more there there's more amen where'd they come from god help us do you believe it do you believe that he did it he spoke it into existence brother if we don't believe those things we don't believe in the resurrection and the rapture god brother yes faith believes god faith trusts god but faith obeys god amen faith is doing what god wants us to do and how god wants us to do it amen there's too many that do have the wisdom or they profess to believe this profess to believe that we think they think they know a lot but yet brother what they do how they do it proves what they really know as i said you can have the faith or you have wisdom to oh repent and be baptized but yet refused to be baptized in his name oh yeah they feel uh well i'll go and get baptized in the name of father son holy ghost yeah but what is the name you've got to identify with the name because in the name is salvation in the name is redemption in the name is healing and whatever whatever you ask in the name he said i'll do it call it you'll get it and so on praise the lord so god help us brother sister thank god for wisdom but brotherless thank god for the faith that he gives us amen so that it becomes not just a dead letter yes it becomes the living word made flesh in us that's the difference so is it do you have the dead letter of the message are you reflecting the dead letter of the message or you're reflecting the living word of the of the message brother it's the life you live it's your attitude your spirit proves it jesus look at the life that jesus lived look at the attitude jesus had the spirit that he had amen it was the word made flesh so brother we need the substance faith hallelujah not just saying i believe this and i believe that a doctrine or theology but it's a substance that's controlling our lives by the grace of god and just think again the first message he preached in in this hour the prophet was faith is the substance and was in 1947 and the last message on faith was works is faith expressed and that was november 1965. amen it was less than a month before the lord took the prophet home so brother if there's anything that god wants requires of us now after all that he's done after all he's revealed it is the faith that pleases him it is the faith that's ordained to give us the resurrection and the rapturing faith oh yeah as i said that what god revealed through luther gave them the faith for justification and the others the faith for sanctification and because after the church agents went into and into darkness and they began to preach just works works works you got to do this oh yeah the catholic church was preaching did you had to do this you had to do this and even martin luther were going to the catholic church into the porch and he'd do this and he do this he do that amen but yet there's something bothering him amen and finally he did go in into the fortune in in the church and he opened the bible and oh when he opened the bible it says the just shall live by faith amen and that jesus had justified us it struck him he he was taught according to the church he was taught that he was justified by his works oh but he when he read the read the scripture he opened up and there it was jesus did it now of course wesley got the revelation jesus sanctified us it's not our works it's our faith see it's all faith faith is what is what god's looking for faith is what god wants brother sister so brother and sister again what with the word that came in luther's day gave them faith justified by faith and wesley's day gave them faith and again in the pentecostal age they gave them the faith and the restoration of the gifts oh they're getting more spiritual and brother again you they were they're just moving on moving on moving on but then when they got into the pentecostal age there i tell you with what god was doing under the pentecostal revival and oh my it was tremendous they and there were some pentecostals felt that maybe all this is going to go on to the coming of the lord why because they knew that god had justified us sanctified us and now they were experiencing the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit now my praise the lord the only one thing left notice they felt was let's go into resurrection let's go into rapture amen but god was was going to bring in the elijah ministry with the revelation of the word to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen as i said we thank god for this faith in previous ages amen right on through through down to pentecostals but what about now the bride age how many want to go home i i don't know i don't mean here in st john's or paradise no no no no how many want to go to glory to be with jesus and how many we won't want to oh how many want to to be with the saints that are going on you gotta want it jesus jesus came from there and he wanted to go back there yeah why he was getting tired of the world he was living he was getting tired of oh all around was everyone that was born in sin but he wasn't born in sin no he wasn't he was born in flesh but brother that flesh didn't come by sin not by any means and that's why my brother and sister amen and if we're born again and we got a new nature we got that same feeling jesus had let's get out of here lord we want to go now take us home lord why oh well brother we want we want to stay here until this one is saved i want to say well you well i tell you god knows who god has got it you leave that with the lord if you got that anointing in your life due to gold to get out of here god put it there and if he if he put it there then you then you then when it comes to family and friends and neighbors you just leave them with the lord say lord thank you i know you i know you're the savior and you'll save them every predestinated seed is going to be there god god help us again the first recorded message is faith is the substance the last recorded message is works is faith expressed amen so is the life we live in expressing our faith faith that you believe in the end time faith that you believe in the rapture faith that you believe in the resurrection again like i quoted some years ago with a picture that some brother had painted and it was in a religious book that i was going through and there's somebody had pictures there in it that wasn't based on message but just based basically on the word of god and uh right on down through the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture and so on and uh he painted a picture of the resurrection oh yeah and in the in the picture oh yeah the like in a graveyard a cemetery oh yeah and you and it had the painting there of of the grandmother and grandfather coming out of their graves and going out to meet jesus but they were old and then they had pictures of others you know just their whatever age they were when they would have died or they came up and they were going out to meet jesus then they had pictures there oh a baby's coming out of their grave and they were going out to meet jesus babies they're still babies but the bible says there's no known old man that hasn't fulfilled his days nor an infant amen nor an infant of days and so on no because we're all going to be around you know well maybe 19 20 years old 21 years old that's what you're gonna be like you're gonna be like that that's that that's what you as the appearance you're gonna have amen but uh my grandfather that died in his 90s he certainly won't look like that when we see him by the grace of god you know he's going to he's going to be just maybe 21 years old that's what he's going to father god said oh yeah they all will be young there forever transformed in a moment of time immortal will stand in his likeness the son of the stars to shine amen by the grace of god oh yes that's that's common sense because old age is a result of sin you know so but we're going into it into into a dimension into a land where there will be no sin oh i've talked to the lord and quite a bit recently just thinking about heaven thinking about the new avenue earth i said oh lord this is going to be wonderful i said when we get to the new heaven he said i said a new earth and i said there won't be no sin i said this there'd be none of this going on none of that going on i said in that new heaven new earth i say thank you jesus i said i'm longing to get there i said oh yeah i said we want to get out of this and get away from this whole world we're living in i wonder how many really want to go how many want to get into a world like that i said there's unfortunately there's a lot going to be bored yeah oh yes if you go up there with still remembering down here you'll be bored in heaven oh yeah because this is not there that's not there oh my they'd be bored because there's no tv to be bored because there's no books and this you know or or no no uh computers no internets oh i'm bored they'll be but i'll tell you this if you've got the holy ghost you want to go back there you want to holy go you got the holy ghost you want to get out of time and into eternity amen because if you have the holy ghost you you can't you can't put up with no more of this whole world as jesus said how much longer shall i be with you lord you mean tell me you're bored yeah you're bored he was bored with it i can't take it can't take it any longer amen well even when peter oh he was delighted on one sense he was delighted when he was getting to the place where he had to go down to jerusalem but when he when he made him remark concerning what was going to happen in jerusalem oh peter didn't like that and peter was going to stop it and he said get behind me satan why jesus knew oh yeah he was going to suffer and he had to do this he had to endure this but he knew that he was going to get out of time and into eternity and he wanted to go do it knowing that he you want to do it too because you're going to redeem us he had to do that to redeem us amen there's one thing to get out of time into eternity but brother i tell you this another reason that he was pushing his way down to jerusalem was to redeem you and me he knew thank god so brother i pray grace is the substance that we live by and that grace and our works rather is our faith expressed wisdom is the revelation of what god requires us to do but faith is the revelation of how god wants us to do it amen and i believe that's why we're here we're not out into something denomination god has brought us out god has delivered us amen why because why we're going by the faith we're going by the revelation of how god wants us to do it how god wants us to serve him amen so are you are you into the revelation of how god is bringing the resurrection rapture god elvis brother cain and the revelation of what god required but abel had the faith well of how god required it both had the revelation of sacrifice yeah but abel had the revelation of what god wanted amen and how god wanted it but brother i tell you the cain he had a revelation of maybe what god required him to do in the sacrifice but or how god required it to have a sacrifice and so on but he never had the faith the revelation of what god required he didn't have the revelation of the shedding of blood a abel did but not came so brother we may have a revelation oh well yes i want to do this for the lord do this for the lord but is that what god wants you to do is that what god requires of you for the resurrection and rapture what does god require of us brother i believe we got to believe the revelation that god gives us amen oh yeah can cain had one revelation well yeah sacrifice can you sacrifice abel was making a sacrifice but look at as i preached years ago when we were in the church on empire avenue and i mentioned it i said well what church would you go to would you go to cain's church or would you go to abel's church i said if you went to abel's church i said oh my look abel you know he had an altar there and he had a lamb and all blood oh i said not many would want to go into that kind of a church i said well cain oh he had the altar and with all these beautiful maybe vegetables whatever he was grown and maybe maybe some flowers oh wonderful i said which church would you go to cain or abel and i noticed that there was a stranger in the church at the time that he had never been in this in one of our services before and i haven't seen him since but after the service he said pastor he said thank you he said i never heard that before he said buddy said you're right he said most would want to go to cain's church yeah because it was more nice beautiful but abel's church oh no we don't want to go where they're going to kill lambs and blood all over the altar oh my brother sister god help us please let's have faith not good not go to the church where everything is nice and you know everybody recognizes the church they love the church and all that now oh yeah you can love our worship and our singing and our praise yeah but when it comes to the preaching of the word not everybody loves the preaching of the word i don't know if you're going to you're going to really preach the truth like jesus did oh my if there's anything that turned the pharisees against jesus was what he preached oh they couldn't they couldn't take it no no because he just laid it in laid it in the word oh yeah god help us stay with the word see which church would you attend abel's church or keynes oh cain kane that's nice you got there oh my surely the lord is pleased with that oh it's beautiful all all that he had laid on the altar there and so on oh wonderful they would rather go to cain's church but not going to abel's church and see the altar abel a dead would you kill that lamb look at a mess of blood you got everywhere yeah so i said most would go to cain's church and that visitor did agree he said you're right but he never heard it before god help us let's believe what god wants us to believe but let's be do what god wants us to do and how how god wants us to do it and brother what about family what about abraham and his family when god called him out into a promised land let's do what god wants us to do and how god wants us to do it abraham brought his summer members of his family out and god wouldn't take him into the promised land he came out but he brought members of his family with him and god wouldn't deal with abraham no more and didn't deal with him until his father died and after his father died then god came and spoke to abraham and called him up again why now he had to separate him from it was it his brother or a cousin lot yeah he said abraham i wanted to do this but he didn't want lot there god help us we're going to do what god wants us to do but you got to do it how god wants you to do it how does god want you to do it oh yes we can go through the scriptures there and see god calling this one and god calling that one but they they responded to god but they did they did it the way they thought that they should do it but god eventually had to come down and correct them i said don't do this don't do that and god had to separate them we never thought about that before we figured oh maybe maybe abraham thought well oh wonderful lord you're going to call me out and you're going to call me into a promised land this is going to be wonderful so he brought his father with him and some other relatives with him and god no god called him but he didn't call them well i'm not saying they weren't they wouldn't they wouldn't want to be lost again like god called us but again brother all it is called is not going to be bright the bride is going to be in the city but there's going to be many others outside the city will you leave it with the lord how many really trust god and they really have faith in god you know and and believe to believe lord i believe you're righteous lord i believe you are lord i trust you lord that you're not you're not going to unrighteously condemn this wonder the condemn that one no no so lord i leave that with you because you are righteous amen god knows but yet there's believers feel that they got to do this or they got to do that oh we're christians no no do what god wants you to do and do where god wants you to do it how god wants you to do it when god wants you to do it brother he's not asking your ideas no no he's asking you to accept his stay with this stay with his will not yours grace so brother abram came out but he brought lot and his family and he shouldn't have done it not that lot was lost no no no no see there are those that are live in the city there are those outside the city god help us brother let's not try to tell god what to do let god tell you what to do and how to do it so there's many other examples in the bible that god did god did this and god called this and god called that and man responded but man added to it amen he added to it man did it this way and did it that way well i'll do it this way lord i'll do that no god wants you to do it he's his way and he had a reason he had a reason brother we need wisdom thank god but we also need faith the thing that pleases god is faith by the grace of god amen just bear with me didn't realize it was this late listen don't reason with god and don't reason with his word believe his word obey his word amen listen he said i did quote this before he said a reasoning he said god is too good and he said god's too merciful he loves you too much he says you hear that some old devil you hear that same old devil today he's that's what they feel he said god's too good to do this god won't do this god won't punish he'll do just exactly what his word said he'll do amen you shall not surely die see what he's trying to do getting her to reason with him in a minute that you reason on god's word he said then you're losing faith don't reason on the word he said don't have no yes no maybe he said or so or stay right with it he said eve had the right approach but she listened to the devil's reasoning he suggests just so many people today that has the right knowledge that knows this word should be god's word and it is god's word but they stand and let some seminary student reason them out of it amen oh yeah it's like the brother it was a i won't say what he was but he was a professional out there in the world in what he was doing and he approached me and he said gerald i got a question a bible question i said okay he said you mean to tell me he said that somebody out there that never went to a a bible school would he he maybe would know more about the bible nor more about you know what it says and what it means then he said somebody that went to a bible college for six years i said yes he said are you sure i said yes i'm sure i said because the one in the bible college is taught by man i said the one over there i said just i said with no education but he's a christian and i said he's got the anointing and baptism of the holy spirit i said he's taught by god i said god's revealing the word to him and that's why i said he can explain it and maybe understand it better than somebody in a college oh he said you really believe that i said oh yes oh i said i know what you mean okay he said i just wondering he said and he was a he may be gone on now he was older much older and he he was in a certain profession that was recognized and honored and respected by by most people today yeah but he just had that question so brother sister don't reason believe god honor god thank god love god no reasoning and again let me say it he said there's so many people today that has the right knowledge and knows that this word should be god's word and it is god's word but they stand and let some seminary student reason them out of it reasonings were to cast down reasoning amen by the grace of god he said faith has no reasoning and he said you don't reason at all you believe and when you're prayed for and accept god's word for healing don't reason with your feelings believe the word amen god help us to believe the word if you you're looking for healing except with his stripes you are eu amen don't reason with it believe it and say thank you lord move on grace said remember everything that can be presented contrary to the word he says satan will do it satan will get you to question the word or doubt the word he says satan will try to reason but he said you can't do it satan will try to say you can't do it but he said god does it don't reason believe no matter what the circumstances don't pay no attention to circumstances believe amen don't go by your feelings you go by your faith it is revealed to you in your heart that with his stripes you are healed that's it oh yeah no matter what your feelings are you just keep you just keep saying thank you lord for healing me oh thank you lord with your stripes i'm healed get away satan i believe the word oh yeah but it's too many just waiting for waiting for it to happen waiting for god to do that waiting for god he's done it but he's waiting for you to accept it by your faith there's too many feelings well i'll wait for god to do this wait but where's your faith that god has already done it where's your faith that god's in control thank you lord for blessing me thank you lord for meeting my needs help me to move on lord and keep trusting you so much there by grace brother sister god gives us the faith to overcome the devil god gives us the faith amen to claim the victory over the world over the flesh and over the devil he said church of the living god here and on tape he said do you know where you stand do you know you that you are called of god that the holy ghost reigns in your heart and every word of god is real to you so does the holy ghost reign in your in your heart amen i trust that the holy ghost does reign and in being controlled in your heart amen there's a number of other things i'm going to share with you on the quote so we'll leave it amen grace grace grace the brother that we have what we have the faith that god requires amen but yes and we have the revelation of how god wants us to respond to his word to god be the glory again let me leave you with you it's one thing to do it another thing to do it god's way the way god wants you to do it oh yeah there's too
