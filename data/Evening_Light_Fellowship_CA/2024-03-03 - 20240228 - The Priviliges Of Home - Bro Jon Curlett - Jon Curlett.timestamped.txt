[43:50] this morning turn if you would to Isaiah
[43:53] 55 Isaiah 55 it's going to be back in
[43:57] church I talked with brother Nelson guy
[43:59] just a little bit yesterday and they
[44:00] discharged him from the hospital so he's
[44:02] finally headed home so we thank the Lord
[44:04] from that and he certainly appreciated
[44:06] all the visitors and brother Bob and
[44:08] Brother David and brother Joe brother
[44:10] Matt and maybe others went I don't know
[44:12] but each one and Blanc and I went in to
[44:14] see him on uh on Friday after we dropped
[44:17] sleen off at the airport and he said as
[44:19] soon as I said I was so happy to see you
[44:21] come through the door just you know it
[44:23] gets it's an interminable time right
[44:26] you're just sitting there and he's got
[44:27] not a whole lot to do and if his wife's
[44:30] not there not really anyone to talk to
[44:31] or anything like that so he appreciated
[44:33] each one that came through and I said
[44:35] tough thing with this is you know what's
[44:36] coming when they do the second knee I
[44:39] said but maybe they'll do it closer to
[44:40] home he says no he says I want to do it
[44:42] in here I said why CU he said out there
[44:44] I don't have you guys so he really
[44:46] really trusted and and and and and
[44:49] enjoyed and appreciated each one that
[44:51] came in so anden God bless you each one
[44:53] that took the time to do that and we
[44:55] want to remember Sister sister Betty as
[44:56] she goes for hip surgery this week as
[44:58] well amen it's an answer to prayer that
[45:00] she can get it just trusting that the
[45:02] Lord will guide the Physicians hands the
[45:04] surgeon's hands that she'll come out and
[45:05] she'll have a pain-free walking ability
[45:08] amen so let's keep her in prayer Amen
[45:10] brother josher appreciated that song
[45:12] service that was very very good this
[45:13] morning right in line with what we're
[45:15] going to speak on this morning amen
[45:17] Isaiah
[45:18] 55 amen what a beautiful scripture says
[45:22] Ho everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to
[45:24] the waters and he that have no money
[45:27] Come Ye buy and eat ye come by wine and
[45:32] milk without money and without price
[45:35] wherefore do you spend money for that
[45:37] which is not bread and your labor for
[45:39] that which satisfieth not hearken
[45:42] diligently unto me and eat ye that which
[45:45] is good and let your soul Delight itself
[45:48] in fatness jumping to verse 6 it says
[45:51] seek ye the Lord while he may be found
[45:53] call ye upon him while he is near let
[45:56] the wicked forsake his way and the
[45:58] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[46:00] return unto the Lord and He will have
[46:02] mercies upon him and to our God for he
[46:06] will abundantly pardon amen God bless
[46:09] you you can have your seats this morning
[46:10] and I'm stepping away from our regular
[46:13] service this morning it's more of a
[46:14] followup I think from where we preached
[46:16] on Wednesday and I'm I'm going to just
[46:18] kind of take that and leverage it and
[46:20] take it from a bit of a different angle
[46:21] but if you remember we spoke last
[46:23] service on the believer's benefits amen
[46:26] what it means to be a child of God and
[46:27] the things that we have because we are
[46:29] children of God not because we lived an
[46:31] amazing life not because we're
[46:32] Sanctified not because we're perfect not
[46:34] because we do everything right but
[46:36] because we're a child of the king we
[46:38] have benefits amen and it's healing and
[46:40] it's all these different things that we
[46:42] talked about but uh I want to take a
[46:43] different angle this morning and just
[46:45] the Lord was dealing with me very
[46:46] strongly on this so uh just stay with me
[46:49] if you will and pull on the word and
[46:50] take what part is for you amen this
[46:52] morning and it's a good message it's
[46:55] it's the gospel amen the gospel's good
[46:57] news and if it's a little cutting at
[46:58] times it's still good news but I'm here
[47:00] to bring good good news this morning as
[47:03] well so I want to take a title this
[47:04] morning of the Privileges of Home amen
[47:08] the Privileges of of home and and I want
[47:11] to go back to Isaiah 55 the inspiration
[47:13] really for this service and verse one
[47:15] says this it says Ho everyone that
[47:18] thirsteth Come Ye to the waters in other
[47:21] words when you have a need there's
[47:22] something to satisfy it amen when you've
[47:24] got something in your life that's
[47:25] pulling for something there's something
[47:26] to respond to that pull there's
[47:28] something to meet that desire it says
[47:30] and he that had no money Come Ye and buy
[47:33] and eat you have no money but what
[47:35] you're going to get won't cost you any
[47:37] money you have to buy it there's
[47:39] something that you have to lay down
[47:40] there's something you have to pay but he
[47:42] says come buy wine and milk without
[47:44] money and without price so what's about
[47:46] to be given what's about to be set is
[47:48] free it's Priceless but it's freely
[47:50] given amen and that's the kind of God we
[47:52] serve that he can give us something
[47:54] Priceless for free and all you have to
[47:57] do is take it but when we jump to verse
[47:59] 6 it says seek ye the Lord while he may
[48:01] be found call ye upon him while he is
[48:04] near amen as long as the children of God
[48:06] are here as long as the bride is here
[48:08] there's Mercy amen we have preachers
[48:10] that we've heard perhaps or heard about
[48:12] that preach that there's no that he's
[48:14] not on The Mercy Seat anymore church if
[48:16] we're here there's got to be Blood On
[48:18] The Mercy Seat because we need it every
[48:19] single day amen we need a mediator we
[48:22] need an intercessor for when we fall for
[48:24] when we trip up for when the dirt this
[48:25] world gets on us amen but there's a time
[48:28] and a season for him to show Mercy
[48:30] there's a time and a season where the
[48:31] blood is still available for each one of
[48:33] us but time is running out and that's
[48:36] why he's saying take it while it's
[48:37] available because there's going to come
[48:38] a day where it's not available then he
[48:41] says let the wicked forsake his way and
[48:45] the unrighteous man his thoughts our
[48:47] natural thoughts our natural way of
[48:48] thinking is
[48:50] unrighteous even as
[48:53] Believers come on now even as as
[48:55] Believers our natural ways are
[48:59] unrighteous I want you to grab that a
[49:01] hold of that this morning amen so they
[49:03] are not godly nor will our thoughts and
[49:05] our ways lead us to God to eternal life
[49:07] to anything that is of value in the
[49:08] kingdom of God it will not do it each
[49:10] one of us in our own we'll never bring
[49:13] ourselves to God or do anything for his
[49:15] good it says let him forsake his way the
[49:17] unrighteous man his thoughts and let him
[49:20] return unto the Lord now I want you to
[49:22] catch who this is talking to because
[49:24] there's only one class of people that
[49:26] can return to the Lord those that were
[49:29] always with him amen it doesn't say turn
[49:31] to the Lord it says return to the Lord
[49:33] amen it's like the redeemed you already
[49:35] were deemed you were you were estimated
[49:38] you were established to be what a part
[49:40] of him only the redeemed can come back
[49:43] they they always were with them so only
[49:45] the child of God can return to God but
[49:49] he says turn back from where you've been
[49:50] going come back amen we left we were
[49:53] born we didn't realize that we were
[49:55] children children of God we're born and
[49:56] we don't have any idea but what happens
[49:58] is God comes our way by his word by a
[50:01] witness whatever it might be and he
[50:03] shines a light in our life and something
[50:05] in US responds and we realize that my
[50:07] home is not here my home is a Heavenly
[50:09] Home my father is not Lanny klet my
[50:11] father is Jesus Christ amen that we're
[50:14] responding to something else he says let
[50:16] him return unto the Lord and He will
[50:19] have mercy upon him and to our God for
[50:22] he will abundantly pardon though your
[50:26] sins be Scarlet they'll be white as snow
[50:28] amen doesn't matter how bad we are how
[50:30] far we go he will abundantly pardon it
[50:33] doesn't matter how far we've gone he's
[50:35] always got more grace and mercy than we
[50:37] have Sinn in Fault amen that's a
[50:39] wonderful place to find ourselves this
[50:41] morning but to catch this he says you've
[50:43] got to turn from your way and your
[50:44] thoughts why because my thoughts are not
[50:47] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[50:50] way sayeth the Lord we've preached on
[50:52] this so many times but that's why we
[50:53] have to die out to our thoughts thoughts
[50:55] and take God's thoughts because God's
[50:57] thoughts became the word and that word
[51:00] has power amen our words don't become
[51:03] the word our words have to be the word
[51:05] that's the only time they have powers
[51:07] when we say his thoughts in his timing
[51:09] and in his season you want to know God's
[51:11] thoughts right here amen we don't have
[51:14] to have a special meeting we don't have
[51:15] to have a seance amen we don't have to
[51:18] go to to to some great person his
[51:20] thoughts are written here amen and it's
[51:23] so clear that a that that a man though a
[51:25] fool shall not a therein he makes it
[51:27] clear to his children amen he's not
[51:29] wanting to trip us up he's wanting to
[51:30] guide us exactly the way that we're
[51:32] supposed to go he says for as the
[51:35] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[51:37] my ways higher than your ways and my
[51:39] thoughts than your thoughts so our
[51:41] thoughts will never match his they just
[51:44] can't go there we can't go that high we
[51:46] can't go that far we can't see that amen
[51:48] our hope is to return to him and him
[51:51] alone that's the only way we're going to
[51:53] get anywhere is that we come back to to
[51:55] him now we've spoken about the mindset
[51:57] of a Believer and we know that our mind
[51:59] is to be the mind of Christ and that
[52:01] means to take our thoughts and our wills
[52:04] and bring them subject to the word of
[52:05] God and when we bring them to subject to
[52:08] the word of God it filters out all of me
[52:10] it filters out all of you and what comes
[52:12] out is pure amen and that's what has
[52:14] effect in our lives that's when things
[52:16] can really take it take advantage of
[52:18] what God's got for us is when we bring
[52:19] ourselves wholly subject to him amen
[52:22] that's the goal for the Believers get
[52:23] ourselves out of the way we bring our
[52:25] thoughts captive we bring our
[52:26] imaginations captive we bring our dreams
[52:28] captive we bring our plans captive all
[52:30] these things we bring them captive to
[52:32] the word and we say Lord what is your
[52:33] will and his will is his word that's the
[52:35] easy way to see it amen God wants us to
[52:37] be subject because that is where our
[52:40] rest is going to be found amen for the
[52:42] believer this is our rest amen it's in
[52:45] Christ the word not just in the letter
[52:46] of the word but it's in the person of
[52:47] the word I was reading in there where
[52:49] brother Braham says that Christianity is
[52:51] not just the word he says you've got to
[52:53] meet the person of the word amen
[52:55] Christianity is not a Doctrine
[52:56] Christianity is a person and me life is
[52:59] a person and these different things but
[53:01] rest is found in knowing that you're in
[53:02] God's hands that's the only way you're
[53:05] going to find rest otherwise you'll just
[53:07] be churning and churning and churning
[53:09] and churning and working and working
[53:10] working and nothing's happening and you
[53:13] have no
[53:14] rest it sucks the life out of you you
[53:17] know I said something over the pulpit
[53:19] many times a former pastor of mine
[53:20] taught this and I firmly believe it he
[53:22] says God's love is based on spiritual
[53:25] growth as in what God wants for you is
[53:28] that your spirit would grow that your
[53:29] soul would grow above everything else
[53:31] amen that's what matters to God and so
[53:33] that's why he comes to redeem our souls
[53:36] because that's the portion that's
[53:37] Eternal potentially if you're a child of
[53:39] God your soul is eternal and the body is
[53:41] not Eternal in these different things
[53:43] but the soul is eternal and that's what
[53:45] he's most focused on and we read this
[53:47] last service in in third John where it
[53:49] says beloved I wish above all things
[53:51] that thou mayest prosper and be in
[53:52] health so he said last service that's
[53:54] the thing that God wants most for us is
[53:56] that we would prosper and be in good
[53:58] health but he says even as your soul
[54:01] prospers what his love his Blessing is
[54:03] based on how our soul is doing and then
[54:06] everything else Falls in behind that
[54:08] when you're doing what God wants you to
[54:09] do when you're where God wants you to be
[54:10] when you're growing when you're maturing
[54:12] God can give you all sorts of blessings
[54:14] because you'll keep them in the right
[54:15] place amen and he wants to do those
[54:18] things and we know we don't preach a
[54:19] Prosperity Gospel here that God will
[54:21] give you anything you want and you just
[54:23] have to speak it and believe it and
[54:25] it'll come to have no no no that's not
[54:27] that's never been the gospel God did not
[54:28] promise a life of ease uh a big homes
[54:31] and fast cars and luxury vacations and
[54:33] and hundreds of thousands of dollars in
[54:35] the bank quite the opposite in fact he
[54:38] said you're going to face Hard Times
[54:39] they're going to beat you they're going
[54:40] to put you out of the churches they're
[54:41] going to do all sorts of things to you
[54:43] amen but prosperity for the for the
[54:45] Christian is what when the soul
[54:47] flourishes amen when you're maturing in
[54:49] Christ that's what God's looking for and
[54:51] then outside of that everything else
[54:54] just kind of Falls away and God can add
[54:56] to it and God can take away and it
[54:57] doesn't change a bit who you are why
[54:59] because your soul is where it needs to
[55:00] be but everything we have need of
[55:03] brother BR would say everything we have
[55:04] need of is in us when God gives us the
[55:06] Holy Ghost when you have the new birth
[55:08] everything inside of you remember what
[55:10] he said he says you that God is like the
[55:12] ocean he says and you can you can't you
[55:15] can't take all of the ocean out he says
[55:17] but you take one little Spoonful one
[55:18] little cup full he says you have
[55:20] everything that's in that ocean in that
[55:22] cup he says and when he gives you the
[55:23] Holy Ghost you've got everything you
[55:25] need to secure you to your Eternal
[55:28] destination everything that's inside of
[55:30] us why because the holy spirit will
[55:31] Quicken the word the way God wants it
[55:33] quickened he'll make it live he'll make
[55:35] it produce he'll make it manifest in our
[55:37] lives and that's the rest of the people
[55:38] of God is that the word is coming
[55:40] through them it's producing itself now I
[55:42] want to focus on this one verse in
[55:44] Isaiah 55 and I skipped it earlier and
[55:47] it's for a reason because I wanted to
[55:48] read it now he says wherefore do you
[55:50] spend money for that which is not bread
[55:54] and your labor for that which satisfieth
[55:56] not in other words why are you working
[55:58] for something that's not going to
[55:59] satisfy you hearken diligently unto me
[56:02] and eat ye that which is good and let
[56:04] your soul Delight itself in fatness and
[56:07] today we look at fatness and we look at
[56:09] it as an unhealthy thing but in the
[56:11] scripture fatness means Health the
[56:14] wealthy men were fat he says you'll be
[56:16] fat it's supposed to mean that you have
[56:17] more food than you have need of he says
[56:20] let your soul Delight in what I'm about
[56:22] to tell you let your B let your spirit
[56:24] let your Soul let the Eternal part of
[56:26] you just just take hold of this and he
[56:28] says this is soul food now we don't know
[56:31] much about soul food up here in Newan
[56:33] land do we I had to look it up because
[56:35] I've lived in the South soul food is
[56:38] food that just satisfies you and it's
[56:41] familiar to you and it just feels like
[56:43] home now in the South I'm going to read
[56:46] these off I don't know what half of
[56:47] these things are I know fried
[56:49] chicken ham Hawks
[56:53] chitlins no idea collar greens blackeyed
[56:57] peas fried okra this is soul food down
[57:00] south cornbread and grits hush puppies
[57:04] no idea sweet potato pie why would you
[57:08] put a sweet potato in a pie I don't know
[57:09] but to them it's Soul Food banana
[57:12] pudding and red velvet cake now all the
[57:14] new finlanders are saying what in the
[57:15] world and me too what's our soulle food
[57:17] for a new finlander maybe jigs dinner
[57:20] you know salt beef Cod tongs bake apple
[57:24] jam Tans something like that right it
[57:27] just tastes like home everyone's licking
[57:31] their lips
[57:32] now right what God's saying is what I'm
[57:35] about to tell you ought to feel like
[57:38] soul food to you it ought to satisfy
[57:40] your soul it ought to make you feel
[57:41] right at home it ought to make you
[57:43] comfortable it ought to make you just
[57:45] feel like everything's okay that's what
[57:47] he told us in Isaiah 52 you know the
[57:50] prophet of God would say that every
[57:51] person in this world has a void in their
[57:53] life that's meant for God
[57:57] and what he says here in Isaiah is how
[57:58] you get to F that
[58:00] void because he says what happens is we
[58:04] take it and we feel an emptiness and so
[58:06] do we do we try and fill it with stuff
[58:09] we try to fill it with careers we try
[58:11] and fill it with wi with wi with a a
[58:14] spouse or a partner of some sort we fill
[58:16] it with alcohol we fill it with drugs we
[58:17] fill it with party we fill it with fast
[58:19] cars we fill it with just things and
[58:22] what happens is we're trying to scratch
[58:24] the itch
[58:25] and the itch never goes away cuz only
[58:28] God can satisfy the itch that's inside
[58:30] of every one of us and what happens
[58:31] people have everything I've known so
[58:33] many people like this church and they
[58:34] have the biggest home they have multiple
[58:36] beautiful cars they have money in the
[58:38] bank they have all these things and they
[58:39] feel empty they feel alone they feel
[58:43] depressed they feel purposeless
[58:46] unfulfilled why cuz they're seeking to
[58:49] satisfy a spiritual hunger with a
[58:52] natural answer and it just never works
[58:54] and many and so what happens is they
[58:55] keep pushing further and further and
[58:58] further and it destroys their life it
[59:00] destroys their marriage it destroys
[59:02] their career whatever it might be
[59:04] because they're not trying to satisfy it
[59:06] with the thing that's supposed to
[59:07] satisfy it but God has a way to scratch
[59:10] our itch man God has a way to satisfy
[59:12] things and we'll walk through some
[59:14] examples this morning but I want to show
[59:15] you one thing that God gives us because
[59:17] we're speaking this morning on the
[59:19] Privileges of Home second Timothy he
[59:22] said for God had not given us the spirit
[59:25] of
[59:26] fear God had not given us the spirit of
[59:29] fear so when you feel fear it's not God
[59:32] Drawing Near
[59:34] You right that's your natural instinct
[59:36] kicking in but that's not the way that
[59:39] God works he says but God has given us a
[59:41] spirit of
[59:43] power of love and of a sound
[59:47] mind power that what you can make it
[59:51] through that there's a God there's a
[59:53] father that's working on your behalf
[59:55] amen of love that whatever you're going
[59:58] through God's love is still there and it
[1:00:01] may even be God's love that's taking you
[1:00:03] there and then a spirit of a sound mind
[1:00:05] the amplifying says this for God did not
[1:00:07] give us a spirit of timidity of
[1:00:09] cowardice of Craven cringing and fawning
[1:00:13] fear brother Joe was sharing this
[1:00:15] morning that brother Ron Spencer many of
[1:00:16] you know what he's been going through
[1:00:17] for four and a half years almost with
[1:00:19] stage four cancer and he has lived and
[1:00:22] they thought he would die within the
[1:00:23] first 6 months he's a miracle walking
[1:00:25] and they're putting hundreds of
[1:00:26] thousands millions of dollars of
[1:00:28] treatment into him and then he had they
[1:00:31] they said that he had cancer in both of
[1:00:33] his
[1:00:33] eyes and so they went up and they they
[1:00:36] prayed over
[1:00:37] him and then his wife was sharing how
[1:00:39] they went to the doctor and they said
[1:00:41] yes it's cancer and they met a woman in
[1:00:43] the hospital and brother Ron talked to
[1:00:45] her and she had an eye patch over ey
[1:00:46] says oh what's the problem she says I
[1:00:48] had cancer in my eyes and so they had to
[1:00:50] take it out and what did it do it it
[1:00:53] just knocked the faith out from
[1:00:54] underneath them what was it Satan was
[1:00:57] trying to bring in
[1:00:58] fear but then they go up and they go to
[1:01:01] the best doctor the the Opthalmology
[1:01:03] oncologists and he looks at it and he
[1:01:05] says you don't have cancer he says you
[1:01:07] have two little lesions on both of your
[1:01:09] eyes no cancer praise the Lord but
[1:01:12] Satan's in there trying to set them up
[1:01:13] for fear right but they've already had
[1:01:16] the prayer of faith prayed and that's
[1:01:18] supposed to what bring love and power
[1:01:21] and a sound mind man we don't have to
[1:01:23] cringe we don't have to pull back from
[1:01:27] anything that comes in our life when we
[1:01:29] are standing on the word of God when
[1:01:30] we're in our position and in our place
[1:01:33] he says he has not given us a spirit of
[1:01:34] timidity but he has given us a spirit of
[1:01:37] power and of love and of calm and well
[1:01:40] balanced mind and discipline and
[1:01:43] self-control so other times when times
[1:01:45] get tough when things get tense when the
[1:01:48] pressure comes down God has given us a
[1:01:50] reaction that is not natural he's given
[1:01:52] us a reaction that is Supernatural amen
[1:01:55] it's a power and a love and a control
[1:01:57] why mind why because it's the holy
[1:01:58] spirit in us saying stand still and see
[1:02:02] the salvation of the Lord You're where I
[1:02:05] want you to be you're doing what I want
[1:02:07] you to do you've held fast to my word
[1:02:09] you're following along in the way that
[1:02:10] I've told you to go don't worry about it
[1:02:13] stand still and react the right way
[1:02:16] trust me amen why because we know who
[1:02:19] our father is we know who our God is we
[1:02:21] know where we come from but I want to
[1:02:24] take down a road this morning of what
[1:02:26] happens when we get away from home and
[1:02:27] what happens when we are at home and two
[1:02:30] different angles to take from it and you
[1:02:31] probably know where I'm going this
[1:02:32] morning and in Luke 15 this is the the
[1:02:34] parable of the prodical son that Jesus
[1:02:36] would talk about he said a certain man
[1:02:38] had two sons and the younger of them
[1:02:40] said to his father father give me the
[1:02:42] portion of goods that falleth to me and
[1:02:45] he divided unto them his living you're
[1:02:47] not supposed to get your inheritance
[1:02:48] while your father's alive but this son
[1:02:50] says Dad give me my half that I'm going
[1:02:52] to
[1:02:53] get he he says and not many days after
[1:02:55] the young man gathered all together and
[1:02:57] took his journey into a far country and
[1:02:59] there wasted his substance that young
[1:03:03] man had a lot of things going for him
[1:03:05] and yet he comes to his dad he has all
[1:03:07] these gifts he has all of this provision
[1:03:09] he has everything he has need of but he
[1:03:10] says Dad give me what belongs to me
[1:03:12] what's going to belong to me and I'm
[1:03:14] going to leave
[1:03:15] you he valued what what his dad had more
[1:03:19] than he valued his dad he valued the
[1:03:21] stuff he valued the blessings over the
[1:03:23] relationship and so he goes out and the
[1:03:25] scripture says that he went out and he
[1:03:27] spent it all on riotous
[1:03:31] living I found it's easy to spend
[1:03:33] somebody else's
[1:03:35] money look at our
[1:03:37] government amen but when you give
[1:03:39] somebody something that they don't earn
[1:03:42] you'll find they never treat it the way
[1:03:43] they did if they did the hard work for
[1:03:45] it sometimes with our kids you know
[1:03:47] we'll say you know I I'm giving my kids
[1:03:49] everything I never had we got to be real
[1:03:51] careful with that there's a reason why
[1:03:53] we didn't have certain things and it's
[1:03:54] not because they couldn't afford it it's
[1:03:56] because it wasn't for our good to give
[1:03:57] them all those things amen when we give
[1:03:59] our kids something you'll find that they
[1:04:01] treat it very poorly often times but if
[1:04:04] they work for it if they earn it they
[1:04:07] value it a whole lot more because they
[1:04:08] know the Blood Sweat and Tears that went
[1:04:10] into it the greatest thing we can give
[1:04:11] our kids is character to work to put in
[1:04:14] real effort and get real success rather
[1:04:16] than just give them the things they want
[1:04:18] but you look at this boy and he's been
[1:04:19] taught right he's been taught right he's
[1:04:22] been taught to work hard he's been
[1:04:24] taught to do to to be faithful in the
[1:04:26] family business and I don't know what
[1:04:27] happened to him we don't know what
[1:04:28] happened to him it doesn't say but I
[1:04:30] imagine like Eve he got seduced by
[1:04:32] somebody that said there's more out
[1:04:34] there than there is in here it's better
[1:04:36] out there than it is in here and if you
[1:04:38] can get what's coming to you you can go
[1:04:40] out there and you can live such a better
[1:04:42] life than if you stayed home with the
[1:04:44] father somebody pulled him away somebody
[1:04:46] bent his ear something seduced him to
[1:04:49] pull him away from where he was supposed
[1:04:50] to be verse 14 says and when he had
[1:04:53] spent all there arose a mighty famine in
[1:04:55] the land and he began to be in
[1:05:00] want isn't that when things start to
[1:05:02] clarify for us when needs start to hit
[1:05:05] when wants start to hit that word want
[1:05:08] in the scripture means need so what
[1:05:10] happened is he started to have a lack
[1:05:12] where he used to have an
[1:05:14] abundance and he starts to sit back and
[1:05:16] he starts to take a a hard look at his
[1:05:19] finances he starts to take a hard look
[1:05:20] at his life and he says this ain't good
[1:05:23] and it ought to have brought him to a
[1:05:25] place of clarity to let him know where
[1:05:28] his place of blessing was which was the
[1:05:30] father's house but instead he goes a
[1:05:34] different
[1:05:34] route if he had stayed where he was
[1:05:37] supposed to be he would never have
[1:05:39] experienced the need that he had cuz in
[1:05:41] the father's house the famine wasn't
[1:05:43] hitting him they had already prepared
[1:05:45] for it in the father's house they had
[1:05:46] plenty of food in the father's house
[1:05:48] they had everything that young that
[1:05:49] young man had need of but now he's
[1:05:51] outside the father's house and his mind
[1:05:53] doesn't go to I should go back to Dad he
[1:05:56] tries to take matters into his own
[1:05:58] hands amen he got away from his
[1:06:01] privileges as a son because he walked
[1:06:03] away from his position as a son that's
[1:06:06] what we're talking about this morning if
[1:06:08] you walk away from your position you
[1:06:09] can't have the Privileges you've got to
[1:06:11] come back to your position and then he
[1:06:13] walked away from provision and tried to
[1:06:15] manage it and all of a sudden he found
[1:06:16] he didn't have what he used to have and
[1:06:18] he had no way of getting
[1:06:20] it he'd practically forgotten how to
[1:06:23] work we look at verse 15 and it says he
[1:06:26] went and joined himself to a citizen of
[1:06:28] that country he didn't join himself to
[1:06:30] somebody of his country people that
[1:06:33] belied the way he did people that lived
[1:06:34] the way he lived he went and he found
[1:06:36] another unbeliever and he attached
[1:06:39] himself to him and he put his life in
[1:06:40] that unbelievers
[1:06:42] hands and that man didn't live like he
[1:06:44] lived that man didn't believe like he
[1:06:45] lived it says and he sent him into his
[1:06:48] fields to feed swine it's all he was
[1:06:50] good for was feeding
[1:06:52] pigs when it was all sudden down he was
[1:06:54] a broken man he was a broken young man
[1:06:56] and all he was good for was taking food
[1:06:58] to the
[1:06:59] pigs now verse 16 says and he feain
[1:07:02] would have filled his belly with the
[1:07:03] husk that the swine did eat and no man
[1:07:06] gave unto him I've read that so many
[1:07:08] times and never grasped what it meant
[1:07:09] and that's why I put the Amplified there
[1:07:11] it says he longed to eat his fill from
[1:07:14] the pods that the pigs were
[1:07:16] eating but no one would give him
[1:07:19] anything see if you look at the
[1:07:20] children's books they always show him
[1:07:22] eating the pig's food but here it says
[1:07:24] they wouldn't give him pigs food what
[1:07:26] was it he was so hungry he longed to eat
[1:07:29] pigs food you know what this pigs food
[1:07:32] was carob
[1:07:35] [Music]
[1:07:36] pods that was looking like steak and
[1:07:39] fries to
[1:07:40] him he got to a place where pig food had
[1:07:43] his mouth
[1:07:45] watering and all he wanted was to eat
[1:07:47] pig food and they wouldn't even let him
[1:07:50] eat pig food
[1:07:52] Church as a young man what was he raised
[1:07:55] on good homecooked everything he had
[1:07:57] need of that's what ought to have
[1:07:59] satisfied him but now he's about to try
[1:08:01] and eat pig food and that's his
[1:08:04] satisfaction as eating pig food how far
[1:08:06] had he fallen from his privileges of
[1:08:09] being a son at home amen he's hungering
[1:08:12] for something that's only fit for
[1:08:15] pigs and very strange vegans
[1:08:18] perhaps this is what he's hungering for
[1:08:21] this is the only satisfaction he has now
[1:08:23] is pig food what a place to find
[1:08:28] ourselves when you're salivating for
[1:08:31] something that's not fit for human
[1:08:35] consumption isn't that what the world
[1:08:40] does and yet even under those conditions
[1:08:42] they wouldn't even give him that that
[1:08:44] shows how much they valued their pigs
[1:08:46] over
[1:08:47] him Church the world will chew you up
[1:08:51] and spit you out
[1:08:54] they don't care about you they don't
[1:08:57] care about your family they don't care
[1:08:59] whether you get a job or not they don't
[1:09:01] care whether you make it all they care
[1:09:03] about is can I make money off of you
[1:09:06] that's all they
[1:09:08] want what ises it do it sucks our peace
[1:09:10] out the world will suck our rest out
[1:09:13] it'll suck our satisfaction it'll take
[1:09:14] our sanity take our
[1:09:16] innocence and just gone and how many
[1:09:20] times have we seen it I remember back in
[1:09:23] Evon there was a young lady left the
[1:09:25] church and within a year and a half she
[1:09:27] had a baby out of wet
[1:09:30] lock
[1:09:31] why Satan just took her
[1:09:34] innocence had his time with her and then
[1:09:37] moved
[1:09:39] on what a shame for that young lady she
[1:09:42] got out from under the Privileges of
[1:09:43] home what does the world do it creates
[1:09:47] hungers there's a reason why we ought
[1:09:49] not to have TVs in our home hooked up to
[1:09:52] TV the ads that they give what does it
[1:09:55] do it's trying to create a hunger in you
[1:09:57] that cannot be satisfied cuz you'll buy
[1:10:00] one thing and then you'll want the next
[1:10:01] thing and then you want the next thing
[1:10:02] and then you want the next thing and all
[1:10:04] they're doing is they're trying to stir
[1:10:05] up something inside of us so that they
[1:10:07] can make money off of
[1:10:09] us that's what's happening this young
[1:10:12] man has all these hungers and all these
[1:10:14] thirsts and no one can satisfy it
[1:10:16] nobody's willing to do it because
[1:10:17] they're in self-preservation mode
[1:10:19] themselves they're in moneymaking Mode
[1:10:22] God doesn't work that way
[1:10:24] scripture says for God so loved the
[1:10:26] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:10:28] that whosoever would believe in him
[1:10:30] would not perish but have everlasting
[1:10:31] life God gives and gives and gives and
[1:10:35] gives and we trample on his grace and
[1:10:37] what does he do gives us more grace we
[1:10:39] trample on his Mercy he gives us more
[1:10:41] Mercy we mess up and we mess up and we
[1:10:43] mess up and we mess up and what is it
[1:10:45] he's got an abundant Mercy that just
[1:10:47] keeps giving back and back and back but
[1:10:50] there's going to be a day where he stops
[1:10:52] amen there's got to be a day where he
[1:10:54] stops but so often what happens is what
[1:10:56] we do we go our own
[1:10:59] way try to resolve issues in our
[1:11:02] life try and make things happen try and
[1:11:05] make things develop what is it Church
[1:11:08] we've got spiritual Amnesia we've
[1:11:11] forgotten who our father is we've
[1:11:14] forgotten who provides who
[1:11:16] blesses who gives Health all of these
[1:11:20] things he provides everything for us
[1:11:23] he's our Je Gyra and what do we do we
[1:11:25] get there and we grind and we grind and
[1:11:28] we grind and we grind because we think
[1:11:30] our work is going to make it
[1:11:33] happen that's not the way it works for a
[1:11:36] for a Christian we don't have to do that
[1:11:38] we need to work hard we ought to be the
[1:11:40] best employees wherever we are
[1:11:43] absolutely I'm not saying that but our
[1:11:45] blessing is not in the fact that we
[1:11:46] worked hard our blessings in the fact
[1:11:48] that God blesses us amen that's where
[1:11:50] our rest is listen to this the people
[1:11:54] forget who they are you're not just an
[1:11:57] ordinary person you're a
[1:12:00] Christian he says you are Sons and
[1:12:02] Daughters of God by the grace of God why
[1:12:05] should you be in the condition you're in
[1:12:07] why should you be doubting and have
[1:12:10] frustrations you look at where the
[1:12:12] prodal son is his his actions his
[1:12:15] decisions he loses it all and then he
[1:12:18] comes up with his way of saving himself
[1:12:20] and even that was only an illusion it
[1:12:23] was anill illusion of survival it was an
[1:12:24] illusion of satisfaction it was an
[1:12:26] illusion that he was going to make it
[1:12:28] because what he figures if I work for
[1:12:30] them they're going to take care of me
[1:12:32] and they didn't they used him and he
[1:12:34] says I'm about to die of
[1:12:36] hunger everything we do is just an
[1:12:38] illusion if we do it on our own if you
[1:12:41] sow on your own you'll reap on your
[1:12:44] own if I'm just stuck with what I can do
[1:12:47] I can only reap what I can do but you'll
[1:12:49] find with God what happens is that he
[1:12:51] comes behind when we can go with his way
[1:12:54] and what does he do he magnifies what we
[1:12:55] do and He blesses it and all of a sudden
[1:12:57] it produces way more than we put in why
[1:13:00] because we're in his path we're in his
[1:13:01] plan we're in his way but this young man
[1:13:04] what does he do he falls on his own
[1:13:06] devices he falls on his own ways and all
[1:13:07] it leaves him is is high and dry broke
[1:13:10] down hungry nearly
[1:13:13] dead why he wasn't built to survive in
[1:13:16] that Kingdom we're not built to survive
[1:13:19] to thrive in Satan's Eden we're built to
[1:13:21] thrive in this kingdom of God amen and
[1:13:24] then when we get there then Satan's
[1:13:25] kingdom has no effect on us and Satan
[1:13:27] will try and throw things at us and
[1:13:28] he'll try and push things on us he'll
[1:13:30] try and put us in panic mode and
[1:13:31] emergency this and that and we're just
[1:13:33] sitting back and we're resting because
[1:13:34] we're exactly where we're supposed to be
[1:13:37] and we know that no weapon that's formed
[1:13:38] against us can prosper amen the kingdom
[1:13:40] of God is our happy place that's what it
[1:13:43] ought to be
[1:13:45] amen but this young man he comes to a
[1:13:48] place it says and when he came to
[1:13:51] himself so he began to be
[1:13:54] being want and he he devised a plan to
[1:13:56] save himself to make it all work out and
[1:13:58] then when that didn't work out it says
[1:14:00] he came to himself in other words his
[1:14:02] mind finally started to operate
[1:14:04] properly he says and he said how many
[1:14:06] hired Servants of my father's have bred
[1:14:09] enough and to spare and I perish with
[1:14:11] Hunger he said you don't even have to be
[1:14:13] a son in my father's house if you're
[1:14:14] just a servant they've got food and then
[1:14:17] some there's always more than enough in
[1:14:19] my father's house he says and I'm
[1:14:21] sitting here and I'm about to die of
[1:14:22] hunger there's a problem with this
[1:14:25] situation he says that's what the church
[1:14:27] needs to do today is come to themselves
[1:14:29] and realize who your who is your father
[1:14:32] for sometimes we act though we have no
[1:14:35] Heaven as though we have no heavenly
[1:14:37] father now listen to what this looks
[1:14:39] like he says for all the goodness of
[1:14:41] Heaven belongs to the church Divine
[1:14:43] Healing salvation freedom from worry or
[1:14:47] anything it all belongs to the church
[1:14:50] Jesus died and we inherit all that God
[1:14:52] has through him I'm here to tell you
[1:14:54] this morning you don't have to live in
[1:14:56] worry you don't have to live in fear you
[1:14:59] don't have to live in stress you don't
[1:15:01] have to live in doubt you don't have to
[1:15:03] feel in feel like you're worthless you
[1:15:05] don't have to feel like you can't make
[1:15:07] it you don't have to worry about what's
[1:15:10] going to happen
[1:15:11] tomorrow you don't have to live that way
[1:15:14] you don't have to live a defeated life
[1:15:16] you don't have to be worried for what's
[1:15:17] coming around the corner you don't have
[1:15:20] to do it you don't have to do it he's
[1:15:22] saying you have everything that Christ
[1:15:25] died for available to you he says and
[1:15:27] then what happens is we forget who we
[1:15:29] are and we forget that we're children of
[1:15:31] God Amen and because you're a child of
[1:15:33] God because you're a child of the king
[1:15:35] he knows what we have need of and he's
[1:15:38] promised to provide for us amen God
[1:15:40] knows where we're at God knows what's
[1:15:42] going on God can see ahead he's already
[1:15:44] seen it all it's a finished work in his
[1:15:46] eyes God's not taken by surprise and we
[1:15:50] sit there and worry about what's going
[1:15:51] to happen that's not the place of the
[1:15:54] believer
[1:15:55] amen we don't want to get to the end of
[1:15:57] this world and forgive the Bal people
[1:15:59] that are here we don't want to get to
[1:16:01] the end of this world and the end of
[1:16:03] this life and all of our hair is torn
[1:16:04] out and we're balbed because we're so
[1:16:06] stressed and we're overweight from
[1:16:08] stress eating and we're frazzled and our
[1:16:11] mind's broken because we've been burning
[1:16:12] our candle at both ends all the time
[1:16:15] what is it trying to do it
[1:16:17] ours trying to do it ourself we don't
[1:16:21] have to walk through life feeling
[1:16:22] complete
[1:16:24] overwhelmed no we don't we've got a lot
[1:16:27] of
[1:16:28] work Brothers it's a long day at work
[1:16:32] these days because it's not just work
[1:16:34] anymore but it is a constant bombardment
[1:16:37] on the Son of God to try and get him to
[1:16:39] turn his head to do things he ought not
[1:16:41] to do to get sucked into things to get
[1:16:43] into the worry you can't go into a
[1:16:45] workplace where they won't talk about
[1:16:47] politics I went to renew Jonathan's
[1:16:49] phone plan and I ended up spending 15
[1:16:51] minutes listening to a guy tell me how
[1:16:52] everything
[1:16:53] broken and the only comfort that we have
[1:16:56] is that we're not as bad as the
[1:16:58] US and I beg to differ but I didn't have
[1:17:02] time and I don't have brain space for it
[1:17:05] how many times have I said every time I
[1:17:07] turn on the news going into to work I
[1:17:09] regret
[1:17:10] it just need to stop doing it why
[1:17:13] because it's not feeding the kingdom of
[1:17:14] God that is within me amen we don't have
[1:17:17] to approach everything in life with a
[1:17:19] Haggard down at the mouth attitude what
[1:17:23] what's the next thing that's going to
[1:17:24] hit me it's not where we have to
[1:17:26] be God has a provided way for us listen
[1:17:29] to what Jesus said he says therefore
[1:17:31] take no thought saying what shall we eat
[1:17:34] or what shall we drink or wherewith
[1:17:37] shall we be clothed this is our worry so
[1:17:40] many times isn't it where's the next
[1:17:43] dollar going to come from how are we
[1:17:44] going to make it to the end of the month
[1:17:45] we always get to the end of the month
[1:17:47] and there's more bills than there is
[1:17:48] money how are we going to make it how
[1:17:50] are we going to do it we're all almost
[1:17:52] all all here single- inome families
[1:17:55] money is a big
[1:17:56] deal it's hard Jesus said don't think
[1:18:00] about those things he says for after all
[1:18:03] these things do the Gentile sck seek we
[1:18:05] sure do he says for your heavenly father
[1:18:08] knoweth that you have need of all these
[1:18:10] things he knows that we're living here
[1:18:13] and we have needs he says but seek ye
[1:18:16] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:18:19] righteousness that's our part seek God
[1:18:23] God first he says and all these things
[1:18:26] shall be added unto you so if you want
[1:18:29] to worry about something worry about
[1:18:31] being right with God if you want to
[1:18:33] focus on something if you want to put
[1:18:35] effort in put it on being right with God
[1:18:38] and everything else will follow right
[1:18:39] behind in its place in per in Perfection
[1:18:42] amen he says take therefore no thought
[1:18:45] for the morrow don't worry about
[1:18:49] tomorrow don't do it you don't have to
[1:18:52] do it as a Son of God as a daughter of
[1:18:54] God he says for the moral shall take
[1:18:56] thought for the things of itself when
[1:18:58] you get tomorrow deal with tomorrow but
[1:19:01] you're in today let's work with
[1:19:03] today he says sufficient unto the day is
[1:19:06] the evil thereof you know what happens
[1:19:08] as we borrow from tomorrow's evil and we
[1:19:11] pull it into today you know what we
[1:19:13] don't do borrow from tomorrow's good and
[1:19:15] bring it into today cuz Satan's trying
[1:19:17] to bring the bad The Bad The the
[1:19:18] worrisome the awful the trouble all of
[1:19:20] this stuff and bring it in trying to
[1:19:22] over load us and break us Jesus said
[1:19:25] don't do that take each day as it
[1:19:28] comes now listen we're talking a bit
[1:19:31] about spiritual Amnesia this morning he
[1:19:33] says now this Amnesia he's talking
[1:19:34] naturally we're told causes you to be to
[1:19:37] a place where you cannot identify
[1:19:38] yourself he says it's an unusual thing
[1:19:41] it doesn't happen too often but the
[1:19:43] cause is from
[1:19:44] shock it's somebody that doesn't even
[1:19:46] know who they are you find it from war
[1:19:48] sometimes and soldiers get it sometimes
[1:19:50] people get it he says another thing that
[1:19:53] causes it is
[1:19:55] worry he's speaking naturally but I'm
[1:19:57] speaking Also spiritually this morning
[1:19:59] worry will cause it worry has no virtue
[1:20:02] to it at all there's no strength in
[1:20:05] worry he says yeah just skip worry and
[1:20:08] accept Faith worry has no virtue to it
[1:20:11] at all but faith has all virtue he says
[1:20:14] believe so worry is a sign of spiritual
[1:20:18] Amnesia that you've forgotten who you
[1:20:21] are you've forgotten who your father is
[1:20:24] you've forgotten what's available to you
[1:20:26] and you're dwelling on the problem
[1:20:28] rather than dwelling on the position
[1:20:30] amen that you are a son of God that you
[1:20:32] are a daughter of God you have things in
[1:20:35] your life and You' got to say but I'm a
[1:20:37] Son of God but I'm a daughter of God
[1:20:41] that doesn't mean that the issue will go
[1:20:43] away but it'll change your attitude as
[1:20:44] you go through the
[1:20:46] issue what happens here is worry causes
[1:20:48] us to put God
[1:20:51] second because it's doubt doubt and
[1:20:54] doubt is the opposite of faith and so it
[1:20:56] brings worry and it brings fear and
[1:20:58] worry takes us out of our position as a
[1:21:01] child of God and brings us into Satan's
[1:21:05] kingdom now friend this may seem a bit
[1:21:08] of a weird
[1:21:10] Direction this morning but a friend of
[1:21:12] our shared this the other day we're
[1:21:14] talking about what worry can do to us
[1:21:17] this is what what they shared they said
[1:21:19] church should be your excuse for missing
[1:21:22] something
[1:21:23] else now I'm not one for memes and pack
[1:21:26] quotes and I'm preaching to the choir CU
[1:21:29] you're here this morning but let me tell
[1:21:31] you Satan will try and get you to make
[1:21:33] bricks without
[1:21:35] straw right he'll try and get you to
[1:21:38] work your way to blessing rather than
[1:21:41] trusting God to blessing he'll try and
[1:21:44] get you to work your way to your grades
[1:21:45] work your way to your career work your
[1:21:47] way to whatever you're trying to do and
[1:21:49] what God will go second and he won't say
[1:21:51] put God second he'll say put this
[1:21:55] first it's implied that god's second but
[1:21:58] he won't remind you of that I thought
[1:22:00] this was great church should be your
[1:22:01] excuse for missing something else you
[1:22:03] know when we lived up in in near brother
[1:22:05] Matt When We Were Young we moved there
[1:22:08] and there was a ton of young young guys
[1:22:10] around there and so you know we kind of
[1:22:12] went exploring on our bikes and you know
[1:22:14] we were playing hockey out on the street
[1:22:16] so they said well come play hockey with
[1:22:17] us well we went up and we absolutely
[1:22:18] trashed them Matt and Adam came over and
[1:22:21] and Nate was with me of course and and
[1:22:23] and the fearful four we just destroyed
[1:22:25] them in hockey they said let's play some
[1:22:27] baseball we beat them 20 to nothing in
[1:22:29] four Innings four people they said let's
[1:22:32] play again we beat them 20 to
[1:22:34] one so they were in awe of the Fearsome
[1:22:39] four but you know what happened was
[1:22:42] Wednesday we're out playing basketball
[1:22:45] and we say we're in the middle of a game
[1:22:47] we said we got to go they said why we
[1:22:49] got to go to
[1:22:50] church go to church yeah we go to church
[1:22:54] oh you're weird and they started calling
[1:22:56] us Church
[1:22:59] boys but we'd thrashed them in whatever
[1:23:01] sport we played and So eventually I
[1:23:03] started saying you guys need to come to
[1:23:05] church so you can get good at
[1:23:07] sports but they called us Church boys
[1:23:10] because what church was a
[1:23:13] priority my mom made it a priority to go
[1:23:16] to church we didn't get to stay home
[1:23:17] from church cuz we wanted to play
[1:23:18] basketball or hockey and believe me we
[1:23:20] wanted to stay home from church and play
[1:23:21] basketball or hockey no we weren't
[1:23:24] allowed to she made it a priority and
[1:23:26] Satan what he does is he tries to raise
[1:23:28] emergencies he tries to to raise worries
[1:23:31] and fears to make us think that we can
[1:23:34] miss out on a place where God has
[1:23:36] guaranteed to bless
[1:23:38] us if I told you you can go somewhere
[1:23:40] and God will bless you today what could
[1:23:43] hold you back if you truly believe
[1:23:46] me and yet we we said it this morning
[1:23:48] even in our prayer where two or three
[1:23:50] are gathered in my name there will I
[1:23:53] Christ the word be in the midst of you
[1:23:57] and what do we do we don't go to
[1:23:59] church it's the silliest thing it's one
[1:24:02] of the greatest promises where he
[1:24:04] promised to meet personally with the
[1:24:06] individual in that building and yet we
[1:24:08] won't do it what does he do he tells us
[1:24:11] we're not going to have enough money
[1:24:12] we're not going to have enough time
[1:24:13] we're not going to have good enough
[1:24:13] grades we're going to go on and on and
[1:24:15] on and blah blah blah blah blah and he
[1:24:17] fills our minds with what
[1:24:19] ifs and what is it it's vain imagination
[1:24:23] absolutely church you can tell me I
[1:24:25] don't know what I'm talking about Blanca
[1:24:27] knows we had no money when I was going
[1:24:29] to school and we always made it through
[1:24:32] I never missed a service for studying
[1:24:34] exams and you can say brother John you
[1:24:35] are smarter you're smarter than everyone
[1:24:37] else no I got C's I got
[1:24:40] D's sometimes I also got
[1:24:44] A's I know some of you are thinking C's
[1:24:46] that' be
[1:24:48] wonderful but I started here and I went
[1:24:51] down and then I came back up again but
[1:24:54] you know what church my grades never got
[1:24:56] me a
[1:24:57] job right my School attendance never got
[1:25:00] me any stickers that the employers
[1:25:02] checked but I'll tell you what I put God
[1:25:05] first and he never failed me
[1:25:08] amen you know Blanca was talking with
[1:25:11] Jonathan a while back because he's a
[1:25:13] young man and he's got aspirations and
[1:25:15] he's looking at things and she said look
[1:25:18] at your
[1:25:19] dad and what he's done
[1:25:23] because as soon as I went into the
[1:25:24] workforce I said I work 40 hours a week
[1:25:29] why because I have a wife and I have a
[1:25:31] family and they need me I don't work
[1:25:34] weekends I definitely don't work Sundays
[1:25:36] and I definitely don't work Wednesday
[1:25:38] nights I work 40 hours a week and church
[1:25:41] I've done this is not for me this is for
[1:25:44] you all the way into the executive ranks
[1:25:47] the last job I had before I came here I
[1:25:49] told the president clearly I was working
[1:25:51] right next to him his right-and man I
[1:25:54] said I work 40 hours a week if you're
[1:25:57] looking for somebody to punch a clock to
[1:25:58] put in a bunch of hours it ain't me I
[1:26:01] said I'll do in 40 hours what others can
[1:26:02] do in 60 but I'm not working hours just
[1:26:05] to make it look like I'm working hard I
[1:26:07] says I'll get the job done and he hired
[1:26:09] me but I did that from the from the
[1:26:11] lowliest engineering position and intern
[1:26:13] position all the way through why because
[1:26:16] if I put it out there that God's first
[1:26:19] in my life the things that matter to God
[1:26:22] are matter they matter to me then it
[1:26:23] sets a standard that I can hold to the
[1:26:25] rest of my life and it gets easier and
[1:26:27] easier and easier
[1:26:30] amen my rest was not that my great
[1:26:32] grades were going to get me a grade get
[1:26:34] me a job my rest was that God would lead
[1:26:36] me to the job I would need my first job
[1:26:38] wasn't great but it was a stepping stone
[1:26:40] to a much better job which was
[1:26:41] phenomenal which was to a better one and
[1:26:43] to a better one and God grows us and he
[1:26:45] matures us and he takes us through these
[1:26:47] things but Satan will say no you've got
[1:26:49] to be perfect believe me I like getting
[1:26:51] A's
[1:26:52] and I'm generally capable of getting A's
[1:26:55] but I'm willing to sacrifice an a if I
[1:26:58] can be in the house of God I'm willing
[1:27:01] to get an to sacrifice an a to know that
[1:27:04] he's with me all the way and I've done
[1:27:07] what he asked and now I can trust him to
[1:27:10] do what he promised which was to provide
[1:27:13] for me
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:17] amen look at
[1:27:19] this not forsaking the assembly of
[1:27:22] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:27:24] is but exhorting one
[1:27:26] another and allthe less as you see the
[1:27:29] day
[1:27:30] approaching all the
[1:27:32] more the day is the day of the Lord it's
[1:27:36] when it's all said and done he says the
[1:27:38] closer we get to that the more we ought
[1:27:40] to be getting together
[1:27:45] amen don't stay
[1:27:47] home if God is in your heart you can
[1:27:49] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[1:27:51] yonder to get in here to fellowship with
[1:27:54] your brothers he says if you don't feel
[1:27:56] that way then I tell you it's time you
[1:27:59] get to
[1:28:01] praying remember the scripture says in
[1:28:03] Ephesians 4 that he's got a five-fold
[1:28:05] Ministry it's for three things it's for
[1:28:07] the maturing of the Saints the
[1:28:08] perfecting of the Saints it's for the
[1:28:10] edifying of the church and to bring us
[1:28:12] into the unity of the faith you can't
[1:28:15] get that at home it says assemble
[1:28:17] yourself together see we say well I
[1:28:19] heard the word no no no it says assemble
[1:28:21] yourself together for the hearing of the
[1:28:23] word amen that's the way it works I'm
[1:28:26] not saying you can't get blessed by
[1:28:27] streaming I'm not saying you can't get
[1:28:28] blessed by being at home but one we miss
[1:28:30] out on you and you miss out on us on
[1:28:33] being in the presence of God right here
[1:28:34] you bring your lick of fire we bring our
[1:28:36] lick of fire we have an atmosphere we
[1:28:37] can have a Revival here
[1:28:39] amen but this young man this prodical
[1:28:42] son he got so caught up in things and in
[1:28:44] the end he came to the place where it
[1:28:45] wasn't working it was either go home or
[1:28:48] die and he was smart enough to say I'm
[1:28:50] going to go home' he Saidi will arise
[1:28:53] and go to my father and I will say unto
[1:28:55] him father I've sinned against heaven
[1:28:57] and before thee we got to come to God
[1:28:59] the right way if we've left we've got to
[1:29:03] come back with a repentant attitude
[1:29:05] always repentance is a start he says now
[1:29:08] I am no more worthy to be called thy son
[1:29:11] make me as one of thy hired servants now
[1:29:14] let me stop here repentance is good
[1:29:16] knowing you're unworthy is good but
[1:29:19] Satan will take that and he'll drive you
[1:29:21] into the ground far below where you're
[1:29:23] supposed to be you're supposed to humble
[1:29:25] yourself to God not take yourself
[1:29:27] completely out of God's economy that's a
[1:29:29] false humbling that's a satanic humbling
[1:29:31] that'll do that amen our current
[1:29:33] situation our current attitude our our
[1:29:35] our current uh problems don't change who
[1:29:38] we are we are always children of God if
[1:29:41] we always were we always will be nothing
[1:29:43] will change that but we come when we say
[1:29:45] Lord I'm sorry Lord I've stepped out on
[1:29:48] my own Lord I've tried to make it happen
[1:29:50] on my own but I'm coming back to where
[1:29:52] you are cuz he's always waiting where we
[1:29:54] left him we preached on this many times
[1:29:57] scripture says in 1 John it says if we
[1:30:00] confess our
[1:30:03] sins see we look at sins as
[1:30:06] actions sin is
[1:30:09] unbelief where you don't believe what
[1:30:11] God has said and therefore you don't do
[1:30:13] what God has said but we focus on the
[1:30:14] doing and we forget about the
[1:30:16] unbelieving part amen that's the root of
[1:30:18] it Eve did it and we've been doing it
[1:30:20] ever since he says if we confess our
[1:30:23] unbelief he is faithful and just to
[1:30:26] forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[1:30:28] from all unrighteousness we covered all
[1:30:30] a lot last service all unrighteousness
[1:30:32] he'll forgive all of it he'll cleanse us
[1:30:33] from all of it he says we have so many
[1:30:36] things but thou just know our heart and
[1:30:38] know everything that we have need of
[1:30:40] we're so glad that we can bring it to
[1:30:42] you in prayer knowing that you
[1:30:44] understand and will give to us of thy
[1:30:46] goodness not that we are worthy of it
[1:30:48] but because thou Hast promised it to us
[1:30:52] don't let our unworthiness hold us back
[1:30:53] because we're always
[1:30:55] unworthy amen but he makes us worthy
[1:30:57] we're worthy in the Beloved the
[1:30:59] scripture says he says our heavenly
[1:31:01] father we the prodal from the kingdom
[1:31:04] straight away many of us dear father are
[1:31:06] not fit to be called your children you
[1:31:09] could just make us your hired servants
[1:31:11] but you don't want us to be your
[1:31:12] servants see we'll say well I'll do
[1:31:15] anything I'll be anything he says I
[1:31:16] didn't call you to be anything I called
[1:31:18] you to be Sons and Daughters of God so
[1:31:21] it's great that you're willing to but
[1:31:22] don't this isn't about what you want or
[1:31:24] it's not what you think he says you want
[1:31:27] us to be your son and daughter to have
[1:31:30] the Privileges of home this is where our
[1:31:32] title came from he says to go to the ice
[1:31:34] box when we know we're home when we're
[1:31:36] hungry and go eat and when we're tired
[1:31:38] to find rest it was wonderful when
[1:31:41] brother Andrew DOD and his wife were
[1:31:43] here when they started going to the
[1:31:44] fridge and finding their own
[1:31:46] food because it meant that they felt at
[1:31:49] home they knew that there were something
[1:31:52] in there to satisfy hunger or thirst and
[1:31:53] so they just started going and doing it
[1:31:55] that's the goal when you have guests is
[1:31:57] to make them feel at home and it was
[1:31:59] wonderful when they started doing that
[1:32:01] amen where we can go and we realize
[1:32:03] there's something available for us and
[1:32:05] all I have to do is go home to get it
[1:32:08] all I have to do is go home to get it so
[1:32:10] what did this young man do it says and
[1:32:12] he arose and came to his father but when
[1:32:14] he was yet a great way off his father
[1:32:16] saw him and had compassion and ran and
[1:32:19] fell on his neck and kissed him
[1:32:23] brother John Andes preached on this when
[1:32:24] he was here the father is not waiting to
[1:32:27] beat him silly he doesn't need to that
[1:32:30] young man has learned his lesson he's
[1:32:32] coming home broken and tired and weary
[1:32:35] and
[1:32:36] hungry completely wrecked by his own
[1:32:39] decisions he knows he did
[1:32:42] wrong the father just says I'm glad to
[1:32:44] have you
[1:32:46] back God's waiting and he just wants his
[1:32:48] sons and his daughters back to him
[1:32:51] that's all he wants amen he wants to
[1:32:53] forgive us he wants to heal us he wants
[1:32:55] to change us more than we wanted and all
[1:32:57] he's waiting is for us to come to
[1:33:00] him amen even when we look at where we
[1:33:02] were before we ever came to this word
[1:33:06] before we ever came to Christ we
[1:33:07] couldn't go to him and he came to us but
[1:33:09] once he's brought us to him he expects
[1:33:11] us to stay with him and that's a
[1:33:13] decision we make day in and day out is I
[1:33:15] will stay with him or I will go my own
[1:33:17] way and I'll try it with my own strength
[1:33:19] and
[1:33:20] attitude watch the son he said to unto
[1:33:23] him father I've sinned against heaven
[1:33:24] and in thy sight and am no more worthy
[1:33:27] to be called thy son do we
[1:33:31] disagree he he made his father a
[1:33:33] laughing stock he valued what his father
[1:33:35] had over who his father was all of these
[1:33:37] things and he comes back and he's
[1:33:39] feeling unworthy Church your feelings
[1:33:42] don't matter in this situation it's good
[1:33:44] you ought to be repentant you ought to
[1:33:46] be sorry if you've stepped out I ought
[1:33:48] to be the same thing but in this
[1:33:50] situation the sons feelings have no play
[1:33:53] they don't matter at all what matters is
[1:33:55] what the father thinks and we see what
[1:33:58] the father does it says the father said
[1:34:00] to his servants bring forth the best
[1:34:02] robe and put it on him and put a ring on
[1:34:04] his hand and shoes on his feet you come
[1:34:06] and you say father I'm weak he says no
[1:34:09] you're strong father I'm poor he says no
[1:34:11] you're rich father I'm unworthy no
[1:34:13] you're
[1:34:14] worthy that's what I'll hold on
[1:34:17] to cuz his thoughts are higher than my
[1:34:19] thoughts his ways are higher than my
[1:34:22] ways Hallelujah that I come in and I
[1:34:24] don't know Lord why do you keep allowing
[1:34:27] this Lord why do you keep forgiving me
[1:34:29] Lord I frustrate you it's got to
[1:34:31] frustrate you and now what does he do he
[1:34:33] wraps the robe of the Holy Ghost around
[1:34:35] me and puts the ring of unmerited grace
[1:34:37] and favor on me time and time
[1:34:42] again we can't wear him out church we
[1:34:45] can't wear him out neither can those
[1:34:48] that aren't here this morning that maybe
[1:34:49] ought to be and we're praying for them
[1:34:51] and we're believing for them they can't
[1:34:53] wear out UNM merited favor that's what
[1:34:56] Grace is you don't deserve it that's why
[1:34:58] it works as well as it does you don't
[1:35:00] deserve it I don't deserve it but time
[1:35:03] and time again we come back and we say
[1:35:05] I'm not worthy he says it doesn't
[1:35:07] matter he says and bring hither the
[1:35:09] fatted calf and kill it and let us eat
[1:35:11] and be merry for this my
[1:35:15] son was dead and is alive again he is
[1:35:19] lost and is found says and they began to
[1:35:23] be merry all that he cares is that we're
[1:35:25] back in the father's home all God cares
[1:35:28] about is when you're back home when
[1:35:30] you're living under the umbrella of the
[1:35:32] protection of his word all he cares
[1:35:34] about is that you're taking him at his
[1:35:36] word and everything else doesn't matter
[1:35:39] we have scars by our own actions so many
[1:35:41] times it doesn't bother
[1:35:43] him the messes we make it doesn't bother
[1:35:46] him if we'll only come back to him you
[1:35:50] know we look at this story the prodical
[1:35:51] son and we so often we focus on those
[1:35:54] that have
[1:35:55] left that on those that have never come
[1:35:57] to Christ or those that have come and
[1:35:58] then gone
[1:36:00] away they fall under the influence of
[1:36:02] others and maybe like we said they go
[1:36:03] into alcohol or drugs or common law
[1:36:06] relationships whatever it might be and
[1:36:08] that's true those are certainly prodal
[1:36:09] but how often do we become manyi
[1:36:12] prodical amen I'm not preaching to those
[1:36:14] that aren't here I'm preaching to those
[1:36:15] that are here this morning myself
[1:36:17] included anden how often are we many
[1:36:19] prodical in other words we leave God
[1:36:21] presence to try and do it on our
[1:36:23] own by our own actions by our own skills
[1:36:26] by our own efforts and we separate
[1:36:28] ourselves from what he said and what he
[1:36:30] promised and what he said he would
[1:36:31] provide and we walk the road alone and
[1:36:33] what are the symptoms worry fear doubt
[1:36:37] unrest stress sickness depression
[1:36:39] frustration bitterness why cuz we're
[1:36:42] giving it everything we've got and ain't
[1:36:44] nothing
[1:36:45] happening amen been there done that got
[1:36:48] the T-shirt you're doing everything
[1:36:52] and you've left him
[1:36:54] behind if you would do the exact same
[1:36:56] thing with him by your side everything
[1:36:58] would change everything would change
[1:37:01] where does it come from someone or
[1:37:03] something has convinced us that by our
[1:37:05] efforts we're going to get something
[1:37:07] done it's like I said before we can get
[1:37:10] something done what we do is we reap
[1:37:12] what we sow but the problem is when we
[1:37:14] reap to the flesh we reap
[1:37:16] destruction because if I burn myself out
[1:37:18] in this flesh yes I can get more but my
[1:37:21] flesh pays a price but you can
[1:37:25] work and put in the same
[1:37:27] effort and if God's in it he'll double
[1:37:31] what you got out he'll magnify what you
[1:37:34] put out you'll put in less brother Joe
[1:37:36] I've talked to him about this he doesn't
[1:37:37] mind me sharing he came to the place
[1:37:38] where he said I've got to work Less
[1:37:40] hours and so he did he did and guess
[1:37:44] what business didn't fall off did it
[1:37:45] brother Joe no he's a multi multi multi
[1:37:48] multi-millionaire now because of this
[1:37:53] no he's
[1:37:54] not but has the cruise of oil run dry
[1:37:57] brother Joel
[1:37:59] amen
[1:38:01] right church I can give you example
[1:38:03] after example after example in my own
[1:38:05] life where you commit a thing to God and
[1:38:08] he provides and sometimes we're saying
[1:38:10] we need the $100,000 and what you need
[1:38:12] is a lesser lifestyle that he can
[1:38:14] provide for you amen we've got people in
[1:38:17] this church make a lot of money and we
[1:38:18] got people in this church that don't
[1:38:19] make a lot of money but you know what
[1:38:21] we've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:38:22] nor see big and bread but what we do see
[1:38:24] is people destroy themselves trying to
[1:38:26] make it happen themselves rather than
[1:38:28] relying on God to bring it out I made
[1:38:31] $34,000 a year in my first job as an
[1:38:34] engineer like a a secretary makes that
[1:38:38] today and it was tough it was tough it
[1:38:41] was tough we lived in a tiny apartment
[1:38:43] we had nothing like at the end of the
[1:38:45] month you'd have like $50 $60 left but
[1:38:49] God blessed us in it and and he provided
[1:38:52] and then the next job he doubled my
[1:38:53] salary then he put 50% on top of that
[1:38:56] and then he put 50% on top of that what
[1:38:59] is it God provides he's got a way of
[1:39:01] doing it but he's got to grow us as he's
[1:39:02] going through all of these
[1:39:04] things am man our promise is that we're
[1:39:06] blessed because we trust in
[1:39:08] him we look in Jeremiah 17 before we do
[1:39:12] that we look at the prodal and say well
[1:39:15] he left look at
[1:39:17] Naomi in the scriptures in the Book of
[1:39:19] Ruth what happened
[1:39:21] things got tough now Church in Israel
[1:39:24] God gave him a promise remember he says
[1:39:26] if you'll stay in the land of Israel and
[1:39:28] you'll live according to my law then he
[1:39:30] would bless them he provide for them
[1:39:32] with food and shelter he he give them
[1:39:34] victory over their enemies he give them
[1:39:36] Health he' give them lots of children he
[1:39:37] says if you stay there and you live the
[1:39:39] way you're supposed to I'll bless you
[1:39:42] and all of a sudden famine comes to
[1:39:43] Israel why does famine come to Israel
[1:39:45] because they're not living the way they
[1:39:47] ought to and so what did Naomi do
[1:39:50] instead of changing her actions she
[1:39:51] changes her
[1:39:53] location the answer is not to change the
[1:39:55] location and what happens is she goes
[1:39:57] out and she loses everything that she
[1:39:59] held valuable and when they come back
[1:40:01] they say nail me's back she says don't
[1:40:03] call me nail me call me Mara bitter she
[1:40:07] came back and the only thing she had to
[1:40:09] reap from her decision to not change the
[1:40:12] way she's living is
[1:40:16] bitterness Naomi was a prodal and when
[1:40:19] she came home and she stepped in
[1:40:21] we find in the end that she's come back
[1:40:23] to her place of trusting God because now
[1:40:25] by the end she's getting Ruth into the
[1:40:27] place where Ruth will trust God and
[1:40:29] she's encouraging Ruth Ruth don't worry
[1:40:31] about it he said he's going to do it
[1:40:33] he'll do it if she'd have only had that
[1:40:35] Faith before she left Israel she
[1:40:37] wouldn't have been in the position she
[1:40:38] was in she came back with scars but she
[1:40:41] was always a daughter of God and God met
[1:40:44] her when she came back and she stayed in
[1:40:45] under the
[1:40:47] promise if you're reaping
[1:40:49] bitterness God's not in the decision
[1:40:52] can't
[1:40:54] be Jeremiah 17 says this thus sayeth the
[1:40:58] Lord I said there was thus sayith the
[1:41:00] Lord in the service this morning here it
[1:41:01] is cursed be the man that trusteth in
[1:41:04] man and maketh flesh his arm and whose
[1:41:07] heart departeth from the Lord in other
[1:41:09] words you're a prodical son because you
[1:41:11] trust in
[1:41:13] yourself he says for he shall be like
[1:41:15] the heath in the desert and shall not
[1:41:17] see when good comes so when Good Times
[1:41:19] come you don't get to enjoy
[1:41:21] it he says but shall inhabit the parched
[1:41:24] places in the wilderness in a salt land
[1:41:26] and not inhabited if you've ever seen
[1:41:28] pictures of the the Great Salt uh seas
[1:41:31] and these things nothing grows there
[1:41:33] salt destroys everything so in other
[1:41:35] words he says if you trust in yourself
[1:41:37] you're going to be parched thirsty no
[1:41:39] Fellowship no relationship no growth
[1:41:41] you're going to be alone and dried out
[1:41:42] you can't even grow you can't produce
[1:41:45] fruit this is what a prodal looks like
[1:41:47] that's a son or daughter of God he said
[1:41:49] blessed is the man that that trusteth in
[1:41:51] the Lord and whose hope the Lord is so
[1:41:54] you trust in God and you say my hope is
[1:41:56] in you not in
[1:41:59] this he says for he shall be as a tree
[1:42:02] planted By the Waters that spreadeth out
[1:42:04] her Roots by the river and shall not see
[1:42:07] when he cometh notice it doesn't say
[1:42:09] that the hot times aren't going to come
[1:42:11] doesn't mean that the droughts aren't
[1:42:12] going to come doesn't mean that
[1:42:14] difficult times don't come but what it
[1:42:15] says there is that you won't feel it it
[1:42:18] won't take effect on you it won't keep
[1:42:20] you from producing the fruit of the
[1:42:22] spirit it won't keep you from having joy
[1:42:24] and peace and rest in your life why CU
[1:42:26] you're planted by rivers of Living
[1:42:28] Water that's why we come to
[1:42:31] church it's flowing water all the time
[1:42:35] but not just in church that's why we
[1:42:36] have our devotions it's why we read our
[1:42:37] Bible it's why we pray it's fresh
[1:42:39] flowing water day in and day out to keep
[1:42:41] us producing life so he says he shall
[1:42:45] not see when he cometh but her leaves
[1:42:47] shall be green he says and shall not be
[1:42:49] careful in the year the drought neither
[1:42:51] shall cease from yielding fruit so in
[1:42:53] other words when things get tight you
[1:42:55] don't have to hold back well I better
[1:42:58] not produce any fruit today because I
[1:43:00] don't have enough water to go around no
[1:43:02] we've always got water we don't have to
[1:43:04] worry about the supply and so we're
[1:43:05] always pushing out what we're supposed
[1:43:07] to do how we're staying where God placed
[1:43:11] us under the hearing and feeding of the
[1:43:13] word of God and it causes a blessing to
[1:43:15] come out of us you can't hold it back
[1:43:17] you put a tree around water it's going
[1:43:18] to produce no matter what it can't stop
[1:43:20] stop amen can't help but it's God that's
[1:43:23] providing us why because he's planted us
[1:43:25] that means he's chosen us to be at a
[1:43:28] particular place at a particular time
[1:43:30] for a particular season and he plants us
[1:43:32] and we can rest in his planting as long
[1:43:34] as it was his planting amen if I don't
[1:43:38] have faith that I'm supposed to be here
[1:43:39] behind this Pulpit nothing good will
[1:43:41] come out of it because whatsoever is not
[1:43:43] a faith is sin unbelief and it'll bleed
[1:43:47] through and it spread throughout the
[1:43:48] church I've got to believe I'm supposed
[1:43:50] to be here you've got to believe you're
[1:43:51] supposed to be here you got to be you're
[1:43:53] supposed to be in the job you're in and
[1:43:54] the school you're in and the place
[1:43:55] you're in whatever it might be you've
[1:43:57] got to believe that you know we look at
[1:43:59] Samson Samson was perhaps one of the
[1:44:00] greatest prodal of the the Bible and you
[1:44:03] know the interesting with Samuel is that
[1:44:05] we see a lot of his victories but those
[1:44:07] victories are all in a really short
[1:44:08] period of time and we see that most of
[1:44:10] Samson's life was really good he was
[1:44:13] actually a really good young man now he
[1:44:14] was a handful as a young man we know
[1:44:16] that he had a problem with women he had
[1:44:18] a problem with sensuality and he went
[1:44:19] out and he he found a woman amongst the
[1:44:21] Philistines and he got his parents to go
[1:44:23] and get her for wife and then the
[1:44:25] Philistines played a trick on them and
[1:44:26] used her against them and in the end
[1:44:28] they gave her to another man and these
[1:44:30] different things and you know that
[1:44:31] caused problems he went out and he burnt
[1:44:33] their fields down and all these
[1:44:34] different things killed a bunch of
[1:44:35] Philistines to give them the clothes
[1:44:37] that they want in the BET and then they
[1:44:39] came for him and they the Israelites
[1:44:40] said well we got to give you up
[1:44:41] otherwise they're going to kill us and
[1:44:42] so they take him out in the desert and
[1:44:44] then the spirit of the Lord comes on him
[1:44:46] and he breaks the Bindings that are on
[1:44:47] him picks up a dry jaw bone of a donkey
[1:44:49] and he kills a th Philistines praise the
[1:44:52] Lord what a victory and then after that
[1:44:55] things are quiet and this is all the
[1:44:56] Bible says he judged Israel in the days
[1:44:59] of the Philistines 20 years so he went
[1:45:01] 20 years where he was tight with God he
[1:45:04] was disciplined he was under the
[1:45:05] umbrella of the word he was doing the
[1:45:07] right thing he was holding fast to the
[1:45:09] word of God 20 years and this is the
[1:45:11] majority of Samson's life as far as we
[1:45:12] know Troublesome youth then he comes
[1:45:15] into maturity and then what happens all
[1:45:18] of a sudden is he just leaves and we
[1:45:20] have no idea how he got there but he
[1:45:22] leaves and he goes to Gaza that's the
[1:45:24] Philistine Capital City what's he doing
[1:45:27] in philistia that's the enemies that's
[1:45:30] that's the tormentors that's the place
[1:45:32] uh the center of power for the people
[1:45:34] that give them so many
[1:45:36] problems and then after that he goes and
[1:45:39] he finds a woman named Delilah in the
[1:45:40] valley of sork and I've told this before
[1:45:42] that the the valley of sork is right on
[1:45:44] the border of philistia Israel what was
[1:45:47] Samson doing looking into the enemy's
[1:45:49] land
[1:45:51] we have no right to be out there looking
[1:45:52] at what this world offers to be tempted
[1:45:55] by what makes them tick that's not our
[1:45:57] food that's not our drink it's not
[1:45:59] something that's going to give us
[1:46:00] anything good but he started looking at
[1:46:02] the way they were and it rekindled
[1:46:05] something he thought had
[1:46:06] died
[1:46:08] amen he had trouble with women he buried
[1:46:12] that by staying in Israel where the
[1:46:14] women were modest and all these
[1:46:15] different things all of a sudden one day
[1:46:17] he decides he's going to go for a walk
[1:46:19] and he gets close to the edge
[1:46:21] and what does he see he sees a beautiful
[1:46:22] woman and it rekindles these desires
[1:46:25] that he thought he'd lost all this
[1:46:27] time what did he see he saw something he
[1:46:30] thought was better than what he had at
[1:46:31] home in the land of
[1:46:36] Israel you know if you want a role
[1:46:39] model pick someone
[1:46:42] here we look and if you look at the
[1:46:45] world and you want to make money don't
[1:46:46] look at somebody out in the world to
[1:46:48] make money cuz you don't see the price
[1:46:50] they paid to make that money you don't
[1:46:52] see it you want the lifestyle they have
[1:46:54] you don't see the price they pay I
[1:46:56] remember a friend of mine in in Texas
[1:46:58] was a doctor very very successful very
[1:47:01] very wealthy uh you know he had a
[1:47:03] Porsche he had a McLaren he had a
[1:47:05] Ferrari he had a race car he had a
[1:47:07] massive massive house I went into his
[1:47:09] house one time you know what was on the
[1:47:11] side table right at the entry pill
[1:47:13] bottle after pill bottle after pill
[1:47:15] bottle after pill bottle after pill
[1:47:17] bottle to treat depression all these
[1:47:21] things has it all on the outside looks
[1:47:25] great and yet no satisfaction lost his
[1:47:29] wife eventually remarried made a mess of
[1:47:33] things still
[1:47:35] successful but the price he paid was
[1:47:38] huge you see somebody in this church
[1:47:40] that's successful say how did you do it
[1:47:43] if I've had any success I've told you my
[1:47:45] success put God first all the way all
[1:47:48] the way unequivocally don't move from it
[1:47:51] that'll bring you as much success as you
[1:47:53] have character to
[1:47:55] handle that's it I don't I don't want to
[1:47:58] make $400,000 a year if I don't have
[1:47:59] character to handle 400 Grand a year I
[1:48:02] don't want to be someplace where I can't
[1:48:03] handle it if I can stick with what God
[1:48:05] wants from me I'll be exactly where I
[1:48:06] need to be first John says this for all
[1:48:11] that is in the world there's another all
[1:48:13] everything that's in the world the lust
[1:48:15] of the flesh the lust of the eyes the
[1:48:17] pride of life is not of the father but
[1:48:19] is of the world the amplifi says for all
[1:48:21] that's in the world the lust of the
[1:48:23] flesh the craving for sensual
[1:48:24] gratification the lust of the eyes which
[1:48:27] is greedy longings of the mind and the
[1:48:29] pride of life the Assurance in one's own
[1:48:32] resources or in the stability of Earthly
[1:48:34] things these do not come from the father
[1:48:37] but are from the world itself see how it
[1:48:40] says that Assurance in one's own
[1:48:42] resources money in the bank got a great
[1:48:46] job great education great prospects
[1:48:49] that's not our assurance
[1:48:51] my hope is in the Lord amen every time
[1:48:53] cuz it can go like that hey I've been in
[1:48:56] in in businesses where you're doing
[1:48:57] phenomenally when I worked in Edmonton I
[1:48:59] worked for a company we grew their sales
[1:49:01] 25% through the work that myself and my
[1:49:03] team did millions and millions of dollar
[1:49:05] dollars and in the end when things took
[1:49:08] a downturn you know what they did cut me
[1:49:10] like that they weren't in it for
[1:49:13] me and that's the thing is we'll get so
[1:49:15] built up and think that we've secured
[1:49:17] ourselves a position no it's God that
[1:49:19] gives God that takes away and man it's
[1:49:21] God that holds us when I was I talk to
[1:49:24] people you know about tithing they say
[1:49:25] how can you do it I say how can I not
[1:49:28] how can I not I've seen the blessing of
[1:49:29] it give 10% of your money away I'm not
[1:49:32] giving it it away it's a
[1:49:35] promise you could say it's
[1:49:38] selfish it's a guarantee that he'll
[1:49:40] provide for me and I give it to God I
[1:49:43] don't give it to Ministry I don't give
[1:49:44] it to men I give it to God and I've seen
[1:49:46] what happens in those things but we look
[1:49:48] at Delilah and we see how she betrayed
[1:49:49] Samson for her own benefit and we know
[1:49:51] the price he paid his wandering eyes he
[1:49:55] lost they took him both out he was
[1:49:58] blind remember the scripture says if
[1:50:00] thine eye offend thee pluck it out God
[1:50:02] did the literal thing for Samuel or or
[1:50:04] for Samson Samson you can't control your
[1:50:06] eyes let's let him go and what did they
[1:50:09] do they plucked his eyes out so that he
[1:50:11] couldn't see and they shaved his head
[1:50:13] and remember the long hair was a
[1:50:14] Nazarite Covenant he wasn't allowed to
[1:50:16] drink alcohol and he couldn't shave his
[1:50:18] head and when they shaved his head he
[1:50:19] lost his Covenant and so God couldn't
[1:50:21] give him the power that he had Samson
[1:50:23] was the strongest man that ever lived we
[1:50:25] see what he did he lifted the entire
[1:50:27] Gates out of a city and carried them and
[1:50:29] put them up on a hill tore a lion in
[1:50:31] half with his bare hands killed a
[1:50:33] thousand men with a Jawbone of a
[1:50:35] donkey but it was only when the spirit
[1:50:37] of God was on him and when he got out of
[1:50:39] the Covenant the spirit of the Lord
[1:50:40] couldn't come upon him so what did they
[1:50:42] do they they they they put him in in in
[1:50:45] the prison there and even in this
[1:50:48] condition Church even in this condition
[1:50:49] Samson is a Son of God he's called to be
[1:50:52] a deliverer he's called to be a judge
[1:50:54] his condition would say no but his
[1:50:56] position and his Heritage says yes and
[1:50:59] so what happens is they put him in the
[1:51:00] prison and they they put chains on him
[1:51:03] and they bind him to the grinding wheel
[1:51:05] for the for the mill so that he could
[1:51:07] they can put the weed in there and he
[1:51:08] can grind it up and turn it into flower
[1:51:10] or finer material or whatever and they
[1:51:12] used them like an animal but in there
[1:51:15] they forgot how they got the victory
[1:51:17] over
[1:51:18] him see they thought the eyes were the
[1:51:21] were were the source they forgot it was
[1:51:23] the hair it was the Covenant and when he
[1:51:26] could come back to the place of Covenant
[1:51:28] restitution he could have his strength
[1:51:30] back so he's in there and day by day
[1:51:33] nothing changes except his hair is
[1:51:35] growing longer and longer and longer and
[1:51:39] what happens he starts to realize I'm
[1:51:42] under a covenant again there's an
[1:51:45] opportunity here but Satan loves to tie
[1:51:48] us down to the grinding wheel doesn't he
[1:51:50] I've been there church I've been there
[1:51:52] don't say he doesn't do it like I said
[1:51:54] it's like Pharaoh trying to make us do
[1:51:55] bricks without straw right you got to
[1:51:58] work twice as hard and it fails all the
[1:52:01] time and we just sit there and we grind
[1:52:03] and we grind and we grind and nothing
[1:52:05] comes out of it what is it we completely
[1:52:08] miss the Privileges of being in the
[1:52:10] father's
[1:52:11] home we look at our lives we look at our
[1:52:13] families our bodies our health whatever
[1:52:15] it is and we say I'm going to make a
[1:52:17] change can't do it we can't change
[1:52:21] ourselves can't do it so often what
[1:52:24] happens is we'll change for a season and
[1:52:26] then when we hit where we want to be we
[1:52:28] relax and what do we do we go right back
[1:52:30] to what we always were why because it
[1:52:33] was discipline that got us and then
[1:52:34] discipline goes away we need a heart
[1:52:36] change we need a nature change we need
[1:52:39] the power of the Holy Ghost Inside Of
[1:52:40] Our Lives that's the lasting change that
[1:52:42] we're looking for and yet we strive and
[1:52:44] strive grinding and turning the wheel
[1:52:46] and it never produces the answer we want
[1:52:48] the lasting answer it may produce the
[1:52:50] answer but it doesn't last because we
[1:52:52] never changed in the process but watch
[1:52:55] what he does to Samuel Samuel or Samson
[1:52:57] sorry Sam Samson's there and his hair
[1:52:59] starting to grow and the Philistines
[1:53:01] make this great mistake of bringing him
[1:53:02] out to make fun of him says now the
[1:53:05] house was full of men and women and all
[1:53:07] the Lords of the Philistines were there
[1:53:08] and and there were upon the roof about
[1:53:10] 3,000 men and women that beheld while
[1:53:13] Samson made sport now watch Samson's
[1:53:16] attitude here now he says and Samson
[1:53:18] called unto the Lord and said oh Lord
[1:53:20] God remember
[1:53:24] me everything's in position he says
[1:53:27] remember
[1:53:28] me not worthy he says I pray thee and
[1:53:33] strengthen
[1:53:35] me he doesn't say deliver me he says
[1:53:38] Lord put me back into
[1:53:41] fellowship and use me as you've used me
[1:53:45] before he says I pray thee only this
[1:53:47] once oh God that I may be at once
[1:53:50] Avenged of the Philistines for my two
[1:53:52] eyes and Samson took hold of the two
[1:53:56] middle pillars upon which the house
[1:53:57] stood it's a temple 3,000 people up in
[1:54:00] the upper balcony and on which it was
[1:54:02] borne up of the one with his right hand
[1:54:04] and the other with his
[1:54:05] left and Samson said let me die with the
[1:54:08] Philistines he's chained to these two
[1:54:10] pillars and all he does is he just lays
[1:54:12] hold of them and he starts to push he
[1:54:16] says and he bowed himself with all his
[1:54:18] might and the house fell upon the Lords
[1:54:20] and upon all the people that were
[1:54:22] therein so the dead which he slew at his
[1:54:25] death were more than they which he slew
[1:54:28] in his
[1:54:29] life Samson didn't die in Israel he died
[1:54:32] in a foreign land
[1:54:35] blind but he had returned to the
[1:54:37] father's home spiritually he returned to
[1:54:39] his position he returned to his place
[1:54:41] he' settled in his heart where his
[1:54:42] strength came from he knew he couldn't
[1:54:45] bring the house down he couldn't bring
[1:54:46] the temple down on his own he said Lord
[1:54:48] just once more remember me strengthen me
[1:54:51] for your
[1:54:52] purpose and let me do something for your
[1:54:55] kingdom one more time you know sometimes
[1:54:57] we leave the kingdom of God and we don't
[1:54:58] even leave the church we don't leave our
[1:55:01] pews we don't leave our families
[1:55:04] remember the kingdom of God is within us
[1:55:05] Jesus said what is it it's the Holy
[1:55:08] Ghost it's the engrafted word it's the
[1:55:10] word that's written on our heart and
[1:55:12] what do we do is we leave that while
[1:55:14] still staying as wonderful church
[1:55:16] members we forget that God is supposed
[1:55:18] to be walking with through all of these
[1:55:20] things and we're trying to make things
[1:55:22] happen on our own and I'm not saying
[1:55:23] stop working stop studying stop trying
[1:55:26] stop planning stop putting effort in I'm
[1:55:28] saying realizing realize that what
[1:55:30] you're
[1:55:32] reaping is going to get you what what
[1:55:34] you're sewing is what you're going to
[1:55:35] reap and the work will not produce the
[1:55:38] effort the the fullness of the effort
[1:55:40] you're putting in it doesn't work that
[1:55:42] way but if you'll trust God blessed is
[1:55:45] the man who trusteth in the Lord and who
[1:55:48] in whose hope the Lord is is then he
[1:55:50] magnifies these things amen if we can
[1:55:53] keep him at the Forefront of every
[1:55:54] situation we get to enjoy the Privileges
[1:55:57] of being a son and daughter of God look
[1:55:59] the way Paul put it Paul one of the
[1:56:01] greatest preachers ever alive maybe the
[1:56:04] greatest aside from Christ as far as I'm
[1:56:05] concerned understood All Things Great
[1:56:09] Revelations but he would say this in F
[1:56:11] SEC First Corinthians he says I have
[1:56:14] planted Paul says I did some work I did
[1:56:17] a lot of work then he says Apollos
[1:56:18] watered he he's talking about us as a
[1:56:21] plant he says and somebody comes behind
[1:56:23] and they watered he says but God gave
[1:56:25] the
[1:56:26] increase cuz remember what the scripture
[1:56:28] says in that day they're going to come
[1:56:29] to me and say Lord Lord did not we do
[1:56:31] this and that and all these beautiful
[1:56:32] things in thy name and he says no I
[1:56:34] never knew you you did it but it wasn't
[1:56:36] me that gave the increase it was you and
[1:56:38] for your own good he says so then
[1:56:40] neither is he that planteth
[1:56:43] anything I I was talking to to a
[1:56:45] minister
[1:56:47] recently and he said isn't it just so
[1:56:50] frustrating he says that you can preach
[1:56:51] a
[1:56:52] service and then a visiting Minister
[1:56:54] will come in and preach the exact same
[1:56:55] thing and he gets twice or three times
[1:56:57] the response that you do he said I
[1:56:59] literally had a man come to me the other
[1:57:01] day after a service like that and say
[1:57:02] wasn't that amazing I've never heard
[1:57:04] anything like that and he says in my
[1:57:05] head I'm screaming I just preached it
[1:57:07] last
[1:57:09] service but what's the problem not that
[1:57:11] it was a problem he had a good attitude
[1:57:13] the me
[1:57:15] monster me me me me me it's all because
[1:57:17] of me no no no no no Paul says yes I did
[1:57:20] something yes somebody else did
[1:57:22] something and I don't begrudge him that
[1:57:24] but God gives the increase if God's in
[1:57:27] it it'll last it'll produce something
[1:57:29] that holds so he says so then neither he
[1:57:32] that planteth anything so Paul says I'm
[1:57:35] nothing I planted he says neither he
[1:57:39] that WTH anything he says but it's God
[1:57:42] that giveth the increase
[1:57:46] amen Psalms 127 says accept the Lord
[1:57:49] build the
[1:57:50] house can I say it this way except the
[1:57:53] Lord build the business except the Lord
[1:57:55] build the career except the Lord build
[1:57:57] the ministry except the Lord build the
[1:57:59] marriage they labor in vain that build
[1:58:01] it doesn't say you won't labor but it'll
[1:58:03] be in vain it does not stand without him
[1:58:07] he says and except the Lord keep the
[1:58:09] city The Watchman waketh but in vain we
[1:58:13] can buy insurance we can put up
[1:58:15] Investments we can put up roadblocks we
[1:58:17] can put everything to protect our
[1:58:19] elves and you know what happens you get
[1:58:22] an act of God that's what they call
[1:58:25] these things that destroy everything
[1:58:26] that we put up to protect ourselves they
[1:58:27] call it an act of God except God
[1:58:30] protects us nothing is
[1:58:34] secure I want to close with one more
[1:58:36] example this morning one of my favorite
[1:58:39] examples we get one verse in the Bible
[1:58:41] about this man he was named shamgar
[1:58:44] we're talking about the Privileges of
[1:58:46] home and shamgar was the right person
[1:58:49] in the right place at the right
[1:58:53] time and he didn't realize
[1:58:57] it he was in the father's
[1:59:00] home but he didn't realize he had
[1:59:02] privileges because of that shamgar was a
[1:59:04] Believer Shamar lived by the law of
[1:59:06] Moses shamgar was a good man he was a
[1:59:09] faithful man and he was living in Israel
[1:59:11] when things got tough shamgar didn't
[1:59:13] leave he stayed there right where he was
[1:59:16] supposed
[1:59:18] to and yet he's living in total
[1:59:21] defeat we're talking about the
[1:59:22] Privileges of this morning of
[1:59:25] Home shamgar didn't realize those
[1:59:28] privileges the prophet of God would
[1:59:30] paint a drama surrounding these events
[1:59:31] we only have one
[1:59:33] verse but look at this he says I saw on
[1:59:36] the day of Judges a little old fellow
[1:59:38] named shamgar and the Philistines would
[1:59:40] come in and take everything that they
[1:59:41] had every time they'd raise a crop the
[1:59:44] Philistines would come in and get what
[1:59:45] they had and take it off brother said
[1:59:48] one time he said they'd only leave
[1:59:49] enough for them to survive next year to
[1:59:50] plant the crop so they could come in and
[1:59:52] take it again never getting ahead just
[1:59:54] living long enough to keep those people
[1:59:56] in food to keep the enemy in food he
[1:59:58] says Oh What A Time robbing them and
[2:00:00] just about the time they get all their
[2:00:02] crops all raised and harvested all the
[2:00:04] hard work done in would come the
[2:00:05] Philistines take what they had and go
[2:00:07] back he says they'd starve to death he
[2:00:10] says so one day this little old fellow
[2:00:12] by the name of shamgar stood out there
[2:00:14] and he was standing there in his barn
[2:00:15] and he said well I suppose maybe we'll
[2:00:16] have enough grain to feed the family
[2:00:18] this year' and he happened to listen
[2:00:20] Trump Trump trump up the road come about
[2:00:22] 600 Philistines all in armor big Spears
[2:00:26] Trump Trump trump coming to get his crop
[2:00:29] he says my after all the Harvest after
[2:00:31] all the trying after all the effort and
[2:00:35] here come 600 armed Philistines to take
[2:00:37] away what he
[2:00:39] had you've been faithful you've been
[2:00:42] faithful you've been faithful and then
[2:00:45] Satan comes to rob
[2:00:48] you he says I see him look down at his
[2:00:51] little old wife a ragged sleep about
[2:00:53] naked he looked at his little children
[2:00:55] their P faces were pale and starved to
[2:00:57] death now these big old husky
[2:00:59] Philistines come in and take what they
[2:01:00] got they'll sure starve through the
[2:01:02] winter now shamgar said now look here
[2:01:05] I'm not a warrior I can't fight and
[2:01:07] there's 600 men what am I going to do
[2:01:11] little old
[2:01:13] me I'm just a little
[2:01:16] believer I'm just a weak need
[2:01:19] Christian Who Am
[2:01:21] I who am
[2:01:23] I the situation is bigger than I am he
[2:01:27] says a few minutes all of his oats would
[2:01:28] be gone all the wheat and corn would be
[2:01:30] gone everything he had laid up his
[2:01:32] family will be starved everything he had
[2:01:35] done would be taken off over into the
[2:01:37] big enemy country there and given away
[2:01:39] to the
[2:01:41] enemy pressure's
[2:01:43] building time's running
[2:01:45] out you own
[2:01:47] Jeopardy done
[2:01:52] and you know when the song's done you
[2:01:53] got to give an
[2:01:55] answer Church in the situation you're
[2:01:57] going to have to give an answer but
[2:01:59] don't let panic drive you to the wrong
[2:02:04] answer he says the first thing you know
[2:02:08] God begin to move on
[2:02:09] him I like that he says he began to get
[2:02:14] angry he's done everything
[2:02:17] right
[2:02:20] and now someone's trying to take it
[2:02:23] away my he looked around he thought oh
[2:02:27] my this is what God moving on a Believer
[2:02:31] does I'm an
[2:02:33] Israelite I'm a
[2:02:35] believer I'm circumcised and that's an
[2:02:38] uncircumcised Philistine coming up there
[2:02:40] I'm under the Covenant and somebody
[2:02:43] that's not under the Covenant is
[2:02:44] challenging
[2:02:47] me he says I'm not not a
[2:02:51] soldier I ain't got time to go out here
[2:02:54] and take some lessons and learn how to
[2:02:55] duel and how to fight but I tell you
[2:02:58] God's my God church it's time to let God
[2:03:02] be
[2:03:02] God it's time to let God be your
[2:03:06] God time to step back a
[2:03:09] little excuse
[2:03:12] me he says so he just reached up there
[2:03:15] and got an old Ox goe he says you know
[2:03:17] what an ox code is it's a little thing
[2:03:19] that had a brass knob on the end of it
[2:03:20] he says you beat the cattle through the
[2:03:22] Corral with it he reached up there and
[2:03:24] got that Ox Ox to be about y long just a
[2:03:27] stick thick stick with a brass tip he
[2:03:30] says he reached up there and got that Ox
[2:03:32] code he didn't have time to train to be
[2:03:34] some kind of a fighter he says the
[2:03:36] emergency was at hand he had to do it
[2:03:39] then church sometimes we get in
[2:03:42] emergencies and Mom and Dad aren't there
[2:03:45] the pastor ain't there the preacher
[2:03:47] ain't there your spouse ain't
[2:03:50] there and you got to
[2:03:53] decide who am I and who's my
[2:03:59] daddy it's an individual
[2:04:02] Affair and when God has put you in
[2:04:04] authority over something whether it's
[2:04:05] children whether it's a family whether
[2:04:07] it's a household whether it's a church
[2:04:08] whatever it might be you've got to be
[2:04:10] able to stand there and say I'm where he
[2:04:12] told me to be I'm where he placed me
[2:04:15] fathers you're the high priest of your
[2:04:17] home you have a authority over
[2:04:19] everything that is in there and that
[2:04:22] wants to come in
[2:04:23] there sisters if you have children you
[2:04:27] have authority over everything Satan
[2:04:29] brings against
[2:04:31] them as children of God you've got
[2:04:34] privileges when you're under the
[2:04:35] umbrella of his
[2:04:38] word falls on us to recognize our
[2:04:40] position that's what the preaching of
[2:04:42] the word supposed to do remind you of
[2:04:43] who you are remind you of who your
[2:04:45] father is remind you of where you're
[2:04:47] standing to get you standing to where
[2:04:49] you can have faith and confidence in
[2:04:50] where you're standing he says oh brother
[2:04:53] we ain't got time to go through schools
[2:04:55] and around through this way and teach
[2:04:56] this way and that way the time's at hand
[2:04:59] rise take what is given to
[2:05:01] you you say all I've got is one verse
[2:05:04] that I read this morning all I had for
[2:05:06] this morning time for this morning was
[2:05:08] one verse use that
[2:05:10] verse if it's the word of God it's still
[2:05:12] has power behind it he says the time's
[2:05:16] at hand rise take what's given to you
[2:05:18] let's go men and women are dying
[2:05:19] everywhere he grabbed that Ox goat and
[2:05:21] jumped out there and slew 600
[2:05:24] Philistines he says hallelujah why he
[2:05:27] had the courage to trust God and step
[2:05:29] out there he says not till I go off and
[2:05:32] learn how to do it he says Oh my he says
[2:05:35] God is your teacher Hallelujah the Holy
[2:05:38] Ghost will back up God's word every
[2:05:41] time it's simple take him at his word he
[2:05:46] says right I haven't got time to learn
[2:05:48] about it he just jumped out there and
[2:05:50] knocked down 600 Philistines his kids
[2:05:53] stayed fat that year amen he says if
[2:05:55] there was ever was a time that we ought
[2:05:57] to stand and defy the devil it's now my
[2:06:00] brother that's right not today Satan not
[2:06:05] today this goes on no
[2:06:09] more it's finished it's
[2:06:13] finished shamgar only gets one verse in
[2:06:16] the Bible one of the most amazing
[2:06:19] Miracles Feats of Strength Feats of of
[2:06:22] courage in the Bible 600 veres 1 you
[2:06:25] know David's Mighty Men the good
[2:06:28] ones would do a couple hundred shamgar
[2:06:31] right up there with the greatest of
[2:06:32] David's men and all he was was a
[2:06:35] farmer it's all he was was a farmer he's
[2:06:37] just a normal person like you and I
[2:06:40] nothing special not trained but he took
[2:06:42] what God had given him and he stood for
[2:06:44] and he says not today Satan but I want
[2:06:47] you to catch the end of sham
[2:06:49] Victory cuz this is all we're told about
[2:06:51] it says and after him was shamgar the
[2:06:52] son of anth which slew of the
[2:06:54] Philistines 600 men with an ox go and he
[2:06:58] also delivered
[2:07:01] Israel what was it you get your
[2:07:06] Victory now you go and you help somebody
[2:07:08] else get their Victory because what we
[2:07:10] freely received we give that's the
[2:07:12] nature of Christ in US is that when he
[2:07:14] gives us something it causes a chain
[2:07:16] reaction in somebody else's life we're
[2:07:18] not self selfish creatures amen we give
[2:07:21] and we give and we give amen and
[2:07:23] inevitably our blessing starts to move
[2:07:25] into others and move into others and
[2:07:27] move into others shamar's personal
[2:07:29] Victory led to victory for the rest of
[2:07:32] the land amen he led them to victory
[2:07:34] over their enemy sometimes we're looking
[2:07:35] for victory and Revival to start in the
[2:07:37] church church family it it starts in
[2:07:40] your family it starts at
[2:07:42] home this is not going to be a public
[2:07:45] show you're going to see the moving of
[2:07:47] God in your private
[2:07:49] lives private prayers private
[2:07:52] needs before you'll probably see it blow
[2:07:54] up in a church in an outward way why
[2:07:58] because you've taken him at his word and
[2:08:01] you realize I've got privileges as a son
[2:08:03] and daughter of God if you can say with
[2:08:06] a clear heart say Lord I'm where you
[2:08:08] want me to be I'm doing what you're
[2:08:10] wanting me to do and I'm faithful to it
[2:08:13] you have privileges for provision for
[2:08:16] healing for for for for grace for
[2:08:20] courage for leadership for direction for
[2:08:24] deliverance all of these things it's all
[2:08:26] available in the father's
[2:08:29] house all God's trying to tell us is
[2:08:31] I've called you I placed you settle down
[2:08:38] rest you don't have to say I've got this
[2:08:40] say Lord you've got this cuz I'm in your
[2:08:43] plan I'm in your word I'm in your
[2:08:45] position I'm in the place that you've
[2:08:47] called me to and I can just rest in
[2:08:49] that look at Psalms 34 as we start to
[2:08:52] close one scripture one quote he says
[2:08:55] the Young Lions do lack and suffer
[2:08:57] hunger you know it's a I'm getting
[2:09:01] older you know brother Joe and I go play
[2:09:04] hockey you know usually once or twice a
[2:09:06] week and one of them was with older guys
[2:09:08] and we're the fast guys out there and
[2:09:09] one of them is with the younger guys and
[2:09:10] we the slow guys out there those young
[2:09:12] guys they can skate and skate and skate
[2:09:15] and they don't have to take breaks and
[2:09:16] rests and we're huffing and puffing and
[2:09:18] you know defibrillators on and
[2:09:21] you the Young Lions he says do lack
[2:09:25] they've got all the energy maybe they've
[2:09:27] got all the skill but that's not where
[2:09:29] it's at he says but they lack and suffer
[2:09:32] hunger but they that seek the Lord shall
[2:09:34] not want any good
[2:09:37] thing as the musicians come let's stand
[2:09:42] together he says oh you great Living
[2:09:44] Church of the Living
[2:09:47] God we're talking to you this
[2:09:50] morning he says I wonder sometimes I
[2:09:52] wonder if God could ever take his gospel
[2:09:54] and Shake you to a place till you'd
[2:09:56] realize who you are and the rights that
[2:09:58] you have the god-given
[2:10:01] Privileges Satan don't have one right of
[2:10:03] nothing he's only a bluff he was
[2:10:05] stripped of everything he had at Calvary
[2:10:07] when Jesus Christ took the sinner's
[2:10:09] place and died at Calvary Satan has no
[2:10:11] legal rights over anything no more he
[2:10:14] says hallelujah but everything lays in
[2:10:16] the hands of the church and the believer
[2:10:19] that's it Satan's lost he's nothing but
[2:10:24] a
[2:10:25] bluff like I said so
[2:10:28] often it's not that we're not in the
[2:10:30] father's house it's that we've forgotten
[2:10:33] the Privileges of being in the father's
[2:10:36] house every need
[2:10:39] supplied I'm the Lord that Health all
[2:10:41] thy
[2:10:42] diseases If any man lack wisdom let him
[2:10:45] ask the Lord who giveth liberally and
[2:10:48] abrath not we go to God and we have a
[2:10:51] need and we think that that somehow
[2:10:52] makes us weak or makes us bad no it
[2:10:56] makes him
[2:10:57] great when we go and we say I lack and
[2:11:00] he says I'll give you the need it's not
[2:11:02] about us it's about him and all he's
[2:11:04] saying is come and
[2:11:07] eat there's a table spread there's food
[2:11:10] available healing is the children's
[2:11:12] bread the scripture
[2:11:13] says Deliverance is is a literal name of
[2:11:17] God
[2:11:19] he's a
[2:11:20] provider everything we have need of so
[2:11:23] he says don't worry don't worry about
[2:11:25] tomorrow don't think about tomorrow
[2:11:28] don't look at the the bottom line you
[2:11:29] men that have businesses say we're in
[2:11:31] the red no he called me he Place me
[2:11:34] he'll provide you Brothers in
[2:11:37] school and it's hard I know it's
[2:11:41] hard young women whatever it might be
[2:11:44] trust God committ it into him trust him
[2:11:47] to get you through through you young men
[2:11:49] young women in careers and jobs and
[2:11:51] things don't don't sacrifice your
[2:11:54] position as a Son of God to take the
[2:11:56] place of a son of Satan it's not worth
[2:11:59] it chew you up and spit you out and
[2:12:01] you'll go right back to where you
[2:12:02] started stand firm in your position say
[2:12:05] I'm staying in the father's home because
[2:12:07] the Privileges there are better than
[2:12:08] anything that Satan can offer me out
[2:12:10] there amen amen let's bow our head this
[2:12:13] morning Heavenly
[2:12:17] Father
[2:12:18] Lord so often we try we try and we try
[2:12:24] Lord in our faith Becomes of that
[2:12:26] performance-based faith that we talked
[2:12:28] about last time where we've done
[2:12:29] everything we can and so we think it'll
[2:12:32] work out but Lord our faith is in you
[2:12:34] and you alone Lord our hope is in you
[2:12:38] Lord we see results and maybe sometimes
[2:12:40] we Pat ourselves on the back lord and we
[2:12:42] don't realize the price we paid by doing
[2:12:44] it all on our own Lord I pray you help
[2:12:47] us to find find that perfect rest that
[2:12:49] that's available Lord the peace that
[2:12:51] passes all understanding Lord that your

[2:12:55] and keep ourselves in your hands Lord if
[2:12:57] we can pull up to the table that you've
[2:12:59] youve provided Lord to the food that you
[2:13:01] prepared Lord and have a little bit of
[2:13:03] peace and rest and joy and love Lord
[2:13:08] that we could see ourselves through your
[2:13:09] eyes Lord that we could appreciate the
[2:13:11] good things of God lord we're not here
[2:13:13] for a life of ease we know you don't
[2:13:15] promise it Lord but you promis to take
[2:13:17] us through it Lord that you would settle
[2:13:19] Us in every circumstance Lord and like
[2:13:21] Moses he said to Moses and to the
[2:13:24] children of Israel at the Red Sea these

[2:13:45] of your presence Lord that the the
[2:13:48] stresses that we carry Lord we give them
[2:13:50] over to you that we place our burdens at
[2:13:52] Calvary Lord that we would just lay them
[2:13:54] on you Lord and walk away free this
[2:13:56] morning Lord these chains that bind us
[2:13:59] Lord even this sometimes our own
[2:14:00] discipline Lord holds us so fast Lord
[2:14:03] and we lose the joy of trusting that
[2:14:05] you'll finish the work Lord would you
[2:14:07] speak to us each one Lord work in our
[2:14:09] hearts and souls this morning Lord I

[2:21:58] longer a slave to
[2:22:05] fear I am a
[2:22:08] child of
[2:22:11] God it's not in trying but in trusting
[2:22:15] 992 and man this is not something we
[2:22:19] achieve just by hard work it's a
[2:22:22] soldier's life man it's a tough life and
[2:22:25] God expects us to have discipline when
[2:22:28] it comes to his word and me to stick
[2:22:30] with it and stay with it but through it
[2:22:33] all it's his one-sided
[2:22:36] Covenant where he said he'd do
[2:22:39] it and it's independent of what we do or
[2:22:43] say he said I'm going to have a bride
[2:22:45] and she'll be spotless she'll be perfect
[2:22:47] perfect shall be without
[2:22:48] wrinkle he says I'm going to make a
[2:22:51] people out of people that aren't a
[2:22:53] people I'm going to pull them from every
[2:22:55] nation in every direction and I'm going
[2:22:56] to pull them together and I'm going to
[2:22:58] make a people of God and they're going
[2:22:59] to overcome and they're going to have
[2:23:01] Victory and they're going to live a life
[2:23:05] that they had no idea even existed
[2:23:08] before I met them and I'm going to
[2:23:10] change them I'm going to put a new heart
[2:23:12] in them and I'm going to put a new
[2:23:13] spirit in them then I'm going to put my
[2:23:14] spirit inside of them and they'll love
[2:23:16] to to live the way I want them to
[2:23:19] live but within that are all these
[2:23:21] benefits packed in we read that last
[2:23:24] service forget not all the benefits of
[2:23:27] the
[2:23:29] Lord and sometimes it's because we are
[2:23:31] so caught up in the situation and what
[2:23:34] we can do rather than saying I've got a
[2:23:37] promise for what I'm trying so hard to
[2:23:40] achieve on my own and just sit back and
[2:23:42] say Lord you help me because so often
[2:23:45] what we treat are symptoms
[2:23:48] we treat symptoms it's it's a great
[2:23:50] failing I think of Western medicine is
[2:23:52] we treat symptoms and and we
[2:23:54] overmedicate in these different things
[2:23:56] and what happens is the root issue is
[2:23:58] not solved we don't eat right we don't
[2:24:00] sleep right we don't we don't live a
[2:24:02] clean lifestyle and so they're trying to
[2:24:03] compensate for and as Believers what can
[2:24:05] happen is we get our performance mixed
[2:24:06] into the working of God and all is it
[2:24:09] does is it starts to undo those things
[2:24:12] but God's calling us and what happens is
[2:24:13] he'll let us
[2:24:15] fail he'll let us get worn out he'll let
[2:24:17] us come to the end of the
[2:24:19] Rope let us go over the cliff and we're
[2:24:21] just hanging on by one finger and we say
[2:24:23] maybe I should ask for some
[2:24:25] help and all of a sudden there's a hand
[2:24:27] that reaches down and grabs us says I
[2:24:30] was here was here all
[2:24:33] along just waiting for you to
[2:24:36] ask help me heal me Deliver Me From
[2:24:40] Myself help me have rest help me
[2:24:44] trust give me the peace that you've
[2:24:46] talked about out where I don't have to
[2:24:49] work and produce it but where I can just
[2:24:53] rest that you do all things well that's
[2:24:56] what's available to us this
[2:24:59] morning don't stop trying to do what he
[2:25:02] wants you to do just don't get caught up
[2:25:04] in the idea that you're trying is what
[2:25:05] makes it happen amen he looks at the
[2:25:09] sincerity of our heart that's all he's
[2:25:11] looking at but the performance is up to
[2:25:14] him remember the final stage of truth
[2:25:18] before she went to the wedding supper
[2:25:20] the wedding ceremony she had to rest she
[2:25:23] had been working she'd been diligent
[2:25:26] she' done everything you could expect
[2:25:28] and she had a name among the people
[2:25:30] don't let your name among the people
[2:25:31] turn you into a performance-driven
[2:25:33] Christian I'm preaching to
[2:25:35] myself don't let it people looking at
[2:25:37] you keep you in the way but she came to
[2:25:40] the place and Naomi said rest Ruth what
[2:25:44] he said he'll do he'll do he's that kind
[2:25:47] of a man he's that kind of a God she
[2:25:50] says and you rest and you wait he's
