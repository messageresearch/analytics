[26:42] hallelujah
[26:44] blessed be your neighbor
[26:46] amen before we pray i want to share a
[26:48] testimony this morning
[26:49] jensen came up last night he's had
[26:51] trouble breathing at night and if you go
[26:52] into his room it sounds like you've got
[26:54] a 747 trying to land at st john's
[26:57] airport and so he came up he wanted to
[26:59] be prayed for last night
[27:02] and i went in last night
[27:05] and all i could hear was samuel's soft
[27:06] breathing they both sleep in the same
[27:08] room you couldn't hear
[27:10] that jensen even had a problem ever all
[27:12] i could hear was samuel
[27:14] jensen could have been dead for all the
[27:16] sound that was coming from that top bed
[27:18] and normally it would have drowned out
[27:19] anything that was in there amen so we
[27:21] praise the lord for his healing
[27:22] amen
[27:23] just in a moment
[27:25] in a moment that's all it takes
[27:28] amen that we trust that he touches lives
[27:30] that he changes our bodies amen that he
[27:32] gives you what you have need of amen
[27:34] so maybe you went to bed last night and
[27:36] you said the symptoms are still there
[27:38] guess what he's still a healer
[27:40] amen whether it's today whether it's
[27:42] tomorrow whether it's next month he's
[27:44] still the healer amen he's still the
[27:45] deliverer it is not based on how we feel
[27:47] it is not based even on how we act amen
[27:50] but his word is true and he's going to
[27:52] fulfill what he promised he would do
[27:54] last night if we will do what hold on
[27:57] confess it and keep it before him and
[27:59] say lord i believe you amen so we're
[28:01] going to pray this this morning for
[28:03] these needs sister cordella asked us
[28:05] specifically to pray for her sister so
[28:07] we're going to pray for her sister what
[28:09] did we hear last night not even cancer
[28:11] amen so we're going to pray over cancer
[28:13] today and we're going to say lord we're
[28:15] trusting you to deliver the sister from
[28:17] cancer amen and for every other need
[28:19] that's here you say we had the wonderful
[28:21] service last night what more could we do
[28:22] today guess what we need more of god we
[28:25] need more of god every single day man we
[28:28] need more of our life to be put out so
[28:30] that his life can come in amen we need
[28:32] less of me and more of him in our lives
[28:34] we don't want to stop with last night
[28:36] amen we want to continue the push
[28:38] forward amen we want to grow in grace we
[28:40] want to grow in the word of god we want
[28:42] him to have a greater effect in our
[28:44] lives amen so that what we can now be a
[28:46] light to those that are outside amen not
[28:48] just to say i am i have him but i want
[28:51] to now go and show it to somebody else
[28:53] to share it with somebody else so that
[28:54] they can see a living christ today amen

[29:13] from you
[29:14] though we have a desire in our hearts to
[29:16] be changed
[29:17] though we have a desire in our hearts to
[29:19] be healed to be delivered lord to be
[29:22] drawn closer to you lord
[29:24] lord that jonathan colette would become
[29:26] less and that jesus christ would become

[29:30] be set aside so that you can have lord a
[29:32] greater portion a greater effect in our
[29:34] lives heavenly father and lord so we
[29:37] look for your word to have effect this
[29:39] morning lord not just a sermon not just
[29:41] a good thought or a good idea but lord
[29:44] we look for a living christ in our midst
[29:46] heavenly father that changes us into you
[29:49] lord that we would be christ walking
[29:50] amongst the people a light that is on a
[29:53] hilltop so that people can see that you
[29:55] are alive and well lord god and lord so

[30:01] thank you for your forgiveness for the
[30:03] blood that covers our sins or we thank
[30:06] you for your grace that when we fall
[30:08] lord you pick us up again and again and
[30:10] again lord your word says that the the
[30:12] trait of a righteous person is not that
[30:14] they don't fall but they get up again
[30:16] and again and again lord so help us to
[30:19] get up again this morning lord that we
[30:21] would take hold of your word lord that
[30:23] we would press the battle that we would
[30:24] not relent until satan has been
[30:26] completely and thoroughly defeated in
[30:28] our lives lord god

[30:31] lord my heart goes out to sister amber
[30:34] and brother everett especially this

[30:57] and we believe now that you will touch
[30:59] her lord that lord whether it's by way
[31:01] of a doctor or whether it's by way of a
[31:02] supernatural touch lord we've seen it
[31:05] both ways or we let you do what you want
[31:07] but lord we believe this morning that
[31:09] you can touch her heavenly father that
[31:11] you can bring lord the healing to her
[31:13] body

[31:27] say that's for me lord may we put
[31:29] ourselves into what's being preached

[1:19:05] certainly enjoyed all the specials
[1:19:06] through the weekend i know i hadn't
[1:19:08] mentioned anything about that and i
[1:19:09] didn't wait till my wife sang to say
[1:19:11] that
[1:19:12] but i've certainly enjoyed all the
[1:19:14] specials they have definitely have just
[1:19:16] been a blessing you know you never know
[1:19:18] what you get when you come to a small
[1:19:20] church you don't know if it's bound up
[1:19:22] or if it's free if they have special
[1:19:24] singers if they don't have special
[1:19:26] singers can they sing good can they not
[1:19:28] sing good are they just making a joyful
[1:19:30] noise
[1:19:31] but i can certainly say this has been a
[1:19:33] refreshing
[1:19:35] for my wife and i to come and be here to
[1:19:37] be with you believers
[1:19:39] you know i was telling brother john i
[1:19:41] said you know you see churches kind of
[1:19:42] like our size we're a lot bigger but yet
[1:19:44] you see the same spirit here as you see
[1:19:46] there the same
[1:19:49] god here as you see there the same
[1:19:51] worship here you see there so god is
[1:19:53] moving it's not just an evil light in
[1:19:55] louisiana or some of the great
[1:19:57] well-known ministers that there are but
[1:19:59] god is right here the same god that
[1:20:00] moves there is the same god that moves
[1:20:02] here he's anointing men and women to
[1:20:04] sing the songs of zion to preach the
[1:20:06] gospel to pull on the gift of god he's
[1:20:08] the same god
[1:20:10] so we're so thankful for that and we
[1:20:12] have been we have truly been blessed and
[1:20:14] we just trust that we've been a blessing
[1:20:16] to you as well i want to this morning
[1:20:19] though i wanted to pick back up
[1:20:22] where we ended last night when we looked
[1:20:24] at the evidence that were in the land
[1:20:26] but before i do i want to read a quote
[1:20:28] as i was listening to it this morning
[1:20:30] brother bam said i was speaking on a
[1:20:32] private interview today and i met a
[1:20:33] couple a man and his son
[1:20:37] and i said you can never never go
[1:20:40] forward until you're you're perfectly
[1:20:42] satisfied
[1:20:45] until you're perfectly satisfied and you
[1:20:47] know without a shadow of a doubt you're
[1:20:49] walking in god's will
[1:20:51] then when you know that you're in god's
[1:20:53] will and walking in his way nothing can
[1:20:56] stop you
[1:20:59] amen amen
[1:21:00] notice he says now because you know
[1:21:02] where you're standing
[1:21:04] when you know where you're standing and
[1:21:06] you know that you're in god's will the
[1:21:09] devil doesn't have enough
[1:21:11] amen
[1:21:12] i don't care how long sister maureen the
[1:21:15] devil doesn't have enough
[1:21:18] when you know you're walking in god's
[1:21:20] will you know where you're standing
[1:21:23] during a devil in hell can knock you off
[1:21:25] the promise of god
[1:21:27] and he says now because you know where
[1:21:29] you're standing you know the way you're
[1:21:31] going you know what what's you got in
[1:21:34] your mind you know what the will of god
[1:21:36] is and then you can do it
[1:21:40] so i wanted to share that because this
[1:21:41] morning i want to speak to you on make
[1:21:43] your move but i was just thinking about
[1:21:45] this
[1:21:46] uh uh you know kind of maybe even giving
[1:21:48] another subtopic where do we go from
[1:21:50] here
[1:21:52] we've had a tremendous weekend hadn't we
[1:21:55] we have seen the presence of god move
[1:21:57] we've heard already a testimony of what
[1:21:58] god's done for for little jensen but
[1:22:01] he's still god for you and he's still
[1:22:03] god for your need and he's still god
[1:22:05] today and he's saying where do we go
[1:22:07] from here
[1:22:08] you got to make your move so we're going
[1:22:10] to look here in deuteronomy 1.
[1:22:13] it's going to read a portion of
[1:22:14] scripture and we'll just kind of get
[1:22:15] into the preaching of the word it says
[1:22:17] when they departed from horeb and went
[1:22:20] through all the great and terrible
[1:22:21] wilderness which they saw by the way of
[1:22:24] the mountain of the amorites as the lord
[1:22:26] our god commanded us and we came to
[1:22:28] kadesh barnea
[1:22:30] and i said unto you you are coming to
[1:22:32] the mountain of the amorites which the
[1:22:34] lord our god doeth give unto us notice
[1:22:36] what moses is telling the children of
[1:22:38] israel i'm bringing you to the mountain
[1:22:40] of your enemy
[1:22:43] but not only am i bringing you to this
[1:22:44] mountain i'm telling you that god has
[1:22:47] given it to you
[1:22:48] so now whatever mountain you're facing
[1:22:50] this morning some of you that came into
[1:22:52] the prayer line last night with your
[1:22:54] mountain i want you to know god is
[1:22:56] declaring he's giving you that mountain
[1:22:59] i'm giving it to you you're coming to
[1:23:00] the mountain of the amorites which the
[1:23:02] lord our god does give unto us and
[1:23:04] behold the lord thy god has set the land
[1:23:07] before thee go up and possess it as the
[1:23:10] lord thy god of thy fathers has said
[1:23:12] unto thee and fear not neither be
[1:23:16] discouraged
[1:23:18] amen so we're just going to jump in from
[1:23:20] here and just take off
[1:23:22] you know brother jewel forney they would
[1:23:24] call him the helicopter or the parachute
[1:23:26] preacher well i'm just going to be a jet
[1:23:29] preacher and just get on started we
[1:23:30] ain't going to have time to build up
[1:23:31] we're just going to preach this morning
[1:23:33] what we find here that god has brought
[1:23:35] his children out of egypt he brought
[1:23:38] them through a wilderness and now they
[1:23:40] find themselves at a pivotal point
[1:23:42] called kadesh barnea and the prophet of
[1:23:44] god will tell us this is the holy place
[1:23:46] of desert dwelling or the holy place a
[1:23:49] desert wandering it's a holy place he
[1:23:51] would say it's the judgment seat of god
[1:23:54] he would also call it the word showdown
[1:23:56] it's a place that the children of israel
[1:23:58] had to make their decision
[1:24:01] and the prophet of god would say every
[1:24:03] service is a kadesh barnea
[1:24:06] so this morning we had had a tremendous
[1:24:08] time we have seen god move we have seen
[1:24:11] god declare to you nothing will stand
[1:24:13] before your prayer and we saw last night
[1:24:15] we brought you evidence of the lamb not
[1:24:17] even cancer will stand before your
[1:24:19] prayer but where do we go from here
[1:24:21] what is the decision we make from this
[1:24:23] weekend what are we declaring this
[1:24:25] weekend do we continue around the
[1:24:27] wilderness that we've been in and we've
[1:24:29] come and we've waited can god do it will
[1:24:32] god do it maybe god will do it i'm
[1:24:34] declaring to you today church that god
[1:24:36] has already done it all that you've got
[1:24:37] to do is make your decisions you're at
[1:24:40] the pivotal point you're at your kadish
[1:24:42] barnea are you gonna pack up and move
[1:24:44] are you gonna stay where you're at
[1:24:48] see do we follow our doubts and let our
[1:24:50] doubts keep us out of the land do we
[1:24:51] allow our doubts to keep us
[1:24:53] free from living a life of victory do we
[1:24:55] eventually die off and die out and dry
[1:24:59] up
[1:25:01] because we're holding on to something
[1:25:02] but god hasn't meet in your he's not
[1:25:04] meeting your time frame
[1:25:06] god's not required to meet your time
[1:25:08] frames
[1:25:09] as we heard last night mustard seed
[1:25:11] faith just keep holding on keep trusting
[1:25:14] god keep believing look i said last
[1:25:16] night we were going to see something
[1:25:18] supernatural something special
[1:25:22] i don't know if some of you you may have
[1:25:24] not caught it last night but we have
[1:25:25] seen god move and i believe just right
[1:25:27] over here god did something very special
[1:25:31] what's the testimony that you can't go
[1:25:33] too far but what the hand of god doesn't
[1:25:36] reach down oh you may try to be on your
[1:25:38] way out but god's declaring you can't
[1:25:40] leave because i called you for this
[1:25:42] moment i called you to come into the
[1:25:44] land i've called you in this hour i've
[1:25:46] anointed you for this position
[1:25:48] [Applause]
[1:25:49] we saw god move in a special way
[1:25:53] but where do we go from here
[1:25:57] where do we go as a church brother lust
[1:25:59] from here
[1:26:00] we're in a cadish barnea we're at a
[1:26:02] showdown
[1:26:03] do we take what we heard this weekend
[1:26:06] and press forward or do we just let it
[1:26:08] be some intellectual garbage and we just
[1:26:10] put it out because you know what god
[1:26:11] ain't meeting me on my time frame
[1:26:15] we got to trust god
[1:26:17] we got to trust god that he had visited
[1:26:20] us this weekend it's our showdown do we
[1:26:22] accept the message do we believe what
[1:26:24] was preached or do we continue to wander
[1:26:28] notice they have come out of sin they
[1:26:30] come out of unbelief they left the harsh
[1:26:33] treatments of egypt and they followed
[1:26:35] the prophet of god they followed the
[1:26:37] word to a certain point and never
[1:26:40] nowhere do we ever find moses telling
[1:26:43] the children of israel stop here
[1:26:45] they stopped on their own accord moses
[1:26:48] was ready to take them into the land
[1:26:50] because god said i've given you i
[1:26:52] brought you to the the mountain of the
[1:26:54] amorites but it sure is to possess
[1:26:56] and he told them go in and possess the
[1:26:59] land but the people refused to move
[1:27:01] forward the people refused to progress
[1:27:03] with the word they refused to follow the
[1:27:06] prophet's ministry and what did they do
[1:27:07] they wondered
[1:27:10] so we got a bigger realize where do we
[1:27:13] go from here as a church
[1:27:16] do we take this message
[1:27:18] do we embrace this message do we move
[1:27:21] forward and let the holy spirit holy
[1:27:23] ghost
[1:27:24] let him do what he wants to do and not
[1:27:27] kind of put god in our own little box
[1:27:29] the prophet god will tell us in the
[1:27:31] results of decision 1955 he says we're
[1:27:34] no longer in egypt we've done pulled up
[1:27:36] our tent stakes and left
[1:27:39] church we're not in denominational
[1:27:40] systems anymore we've pulled up our tent
[1:27:43] stakes we've left we come through the
[1:27:45] red sea the blood of the lord jesus seen
[1:27:47] all the old habits all the things of
[1:27:49] life that were drowned all the old task
[1:27:51] masters that drove us through the bar
[1:27:53] rooms into the cocktail lounge and so we
[1:27:55] seen all that drown like pharaoh and his
[1:27:58] horses and then now we're in the
[1:28:00] wilderness moving along following the
[1:28:02] angel of the covenant the holy ghost and
[1:28:05] knowing that we're on the road to a
[1:28:07] great land and he goes and that'll be
[1:28:09] here during the days of the millennium
[1:28:11] so what what are we going to do are we
[1:28:12] going to progress or we're going to stop
[1:28:17] they were in an exodus we're in another
[1:28:18] exodus
[1:28:21] they followed a prophet we're following
[1:28:22] a prophet they had a pillar of fire we
[1:28:24] had a pillar of fire
[1:28:27] they left egypt we left the world
[1:28:29] we've seen the task masters drowned
[1:28:31] they've seen them drown we've seen them
[1:28:32] drown the things that used to hinder you
[1:28:34] they don't hinder you no more
[1:28:36] but church we're at a pivotal point
[1:28:38] where the kadesh barnea
[1:28:41] nowhere did he tell you to stop
[1:28:43] nor did he encourage you to stop
[1:28:44] believing nowhere did he encourage you
[1:28:46] to stop trusting nowhere did he tell you
[1:28:48] that he told you i've given you the
[1:28:50] mountain
[1:28:51] i've given you the land rise and go
[1:28:54] possess the land so we have something to
[1:28:56] do this morning we have to make our
[1:28:58] decision and let me say it like this
[1:29:00] everyone in this building this morning
[1:29:02] your decision is not your pastor's
[1:29:04] decision it's your own personal decision
[1:29:07] you got to make your decision whether
[1:29:08] mom and dad don't want to go on with god
[1:29:10] young person you got to make your
[1:29:12] decision i'm going on with god
[1:29:14] when i gave my heart to god at 21 years
[1:29:17] old i moved over to even like tabernacle
[1:29:19] i was the only one in my family my mom
[1:29:21] and dad stayed back my brother and
[1:29:22] sister stay back but eventually one by
[1:29:25] one they began to follow one because
[1:29:27] they saw god had done something real in
[1:29:29] my life and i was no longer playing
[1:29:31] church i was no longer out in the world
[1:29:33] but i dedicated my life to god i
[1:29:35] dedicated my life to the ministry and
[1:29:37] hear what god just started to do he
[1:29:39] began to follow or have my family follow
[1:29:41] me over there to where they can receive
[1:29:43] the same promise the same word the same
[1:29:46] anointing
[1:29:48] but you got to make your decision well
[1:29:50] you got to go at it alone
[1:29:52] whether you got to leave family whether
[1:29:54] you got to leave friends i packed up and
[1:29:56] left a whole bunch of friends or what i
[1:29:58] thought was friends
[1:30:00] he had to leave that worldly influence
[1:30:02] and i'm going on with jesus
[1:30:04] got to leave that worldly influence and
[1:30:06] make your decision from this point
[1:30:09] forward i'm going on with god
[1:30:11] i'm serious he met me this weekend and
[1:30:13] i'm not staying where i've been i'm
[1:30:15] moving forward
[1:30:17] see we're in another exodus we're at a
[1:30:19] point in the journey where we got to
[1:30:20] make a decision
[1:30:21] and we find there's so much negativity
[1:30:24] right now that follows our message
[1:30:27] so much negativity is swirling around
[1:30:29] about them the prophet of god and now
[1:30:31] they find in every little fault every
[1:30:33] little mistake but 60 years ago they
[1:30:34] didn't find one
[1:30:37] so now we find it and what does it its
[1:30:40] purpose is to discourage and disillusion
[1:30:43] those
[1:30:44] that are coming back are those that have
[1:30:46] come back now they're coming to their
[1:30:47] congregations they're coming to the
[1:30:48] people coming to the masses and they're
[1:30:51] disillusioning them and they're
[1:30:52] discouraging them you know and yet we
[1:30:55] find
[1:30:56] but you got to make a choice
[1:30:59] you can go to those websites if you
[1:31:01] choose and read all the garbage you want
[1:31:03] to read or you can make a choice just to
[1:31:05] stay right here in this land
[1:31:07] why garbage your mind up with all that
[1:31:09] when you can stay right here
[1:31:11] is this the message
[1:31:13] is it still the truth does it still have
[1:31:15] power look i've seen the power we
[1:31:17] witnessed it last night
[1:31:19] he not only healed but he caught he got
[1:31:21] a little young man gave his heart to the
[1:31:23] lord last night he's going to be
[1:31:24] baptized look the devil didn't do that
[1:31:26] god is doing that we said well he's just
[1:31:28] a child no he's not just a child he's a
[1:31:30] child of god that god handpicked for
[1:31:33] that and god declared to this little
[1:31:35] church that i'm not only the god of the
[1:31:37] owner i'm the god of the young i can
[1:31:39] take them and raise them up i can
[1:31:40] protect them from the scars of this
[1:31:42] world and i can dedicate their life to
[1:31:44] almighty god god is showing ye still a
[1:31:46] god of abraham isaac and jacob he's
[1:31:48] still the god of the bride of jesus
[1:31:50] christ
[1:31:52] well the prophet of god will tell us the
[1:31:54] greatest sin that i find in the church
[1:31:55] today is unbelief that's the only sin
[1:31:58] there is there's no other sin but
[1:32:01] unbelief
[1:32:02] see the failure of the children of
[1:32:04] israel at cades barnea was due to their
[1:32:07] unbelief toward god and toward his
[1:32:09] promise
[1:32:10] now see you got a choice that lays
[1:32:12] before you
[1:32:13] you got to not only believe god but you
[1:32:14] also got to believe his promise
[1:32:18] okay
[1:32:19] god is faithful and his word cannot fail
[1:32:23] so if god is faithful and he speaks a
[1:32:25] word and we heard last night that his
[1:32:28] word cannot and will not return to him
[1:32:30] void but it will accomplish that which
[1:32:32] it was purpose
[1:32:35] and we prayed the prayer of faith over
[1:32:37] you and he said the prayer of faith
[1:32:38] shall save the sick if they committed
[1:32:40] any sins it will be forgiven them
[1:32:43] we also believe that we can lay hands on
[1:32:45] it they shall recover we can cast out
[1:32:47] all these things are in god's word so if
[1:32:49] god's word can't fail and we pronounce
[1:32:51] healing on you because the word says i'm
[1:32:53] the lord thou god that heals all thy
[1:32:55] diseases
[1:32:56] then that word can't come back and fail
[1:32:58] god can't fail god cannot cease to be
[1:33:01] god the only thing that limits god is
[1:33:04] you
[1:33:06] your unbelief and we find here the
[1:33:08] people because of their unbelief they
[1:33:10] neither believe god nor do they believe
[1:33:12] his promise and their unbelief offended
[1:33:15] god
[1:33:17] their unbelief so if their unbelief
[1:33:19] offended god what does our unbelief do
[1:33:22] thankfully we serve a god who's rich in
[1:33:24] mercy
[1:33:26] thankfully he don't just scratch us off
[1:33:28] and say you know what i'm tired of
[1:33:29] dealing with little old joe not you joe
[1:33:32] this joe
[1:33:33] got to get our jobs correct but you know
[1:33:36] what he just can't seem to get it
[1:33:38] together i'm just going to move on to
[1:33:40] joe coffey now and maybe he'll take the
[1:33:42] promises of god and go to another level
[1:33:45] see thankfully god doesn't work that way
[1:33:47] because god had planted a seed of life
[1:33:49] on the inside of every individual and no
[1:33:52] matter what god is god is duty-bound to
[1:33:55] see that seed come to life
[1:33:57] and satan is going to do everything he
[1:33:59] can to stop that seed
[1:34:02] so we find now they begin to murmur they
[1:34:05] begin to complain and notice here in
[1:34:06] deuteronomy 1 and verse 6 the lord your
[1:34:08] god spake unto us in horeb saying you
[1:34:12] have dwelt long enough in this mount
[1:34:16] aren't you tired of being where you've
[1:34:18] been
[1:34:20] aren't you just tired of camping out
[1:34:22] where you've been
[1:34:23] there's so much more of the promises of
[1:34:26] god to tap into
[1:34:27] but we find believers today what they do
[1:34:30] well you know what this is all i know
[1:34:32] oh my goodness
[1:34:35] well you know what we knew that 60 years
[1:34:37] ago it's time to move
[1:34:39] it's time to advance
[1:34:40] the word has been opened up to us it's
[1:34:43] time that we flourish in the opening of
[1:34:45] the word it's time that we become what
[1:34:47] god has intended us to become
[1:34:49] and yet we find that he says you have
[1:34:51] been here long enough even like
[1:34:54] fellowship you had been here long enough
[1:34:56] now where do we go from here
[1:35:02] see you've been around this mountain of
[1:35:03] sickness
[1:35:05] well can god do it
[1:35:07] maybe god can do it you know we saw some
[1:35:09] videos last night some pictures we seen
[1:35:11] that he did do it
[1:35:12] but can he do it for me
[1:35:16] stop going around that mountain
[1:35:18] if god can will god can i'm telling you
[1:35:22] god's able
[1:35:24] you got to turn your doubts to belief
[1:35:27] gotta like the prophet god says start
[1:35:29] doubting your doubts
[1:35:32] you know well maybe the situation is too
[1:35:34] big and maybe i can't get out of it and
[1:35:37] you've been camped out on this situation
[1:35:38] for a long time because it seems
[1:35:40] impossible god does impossible math
[1:35:44] god does the impossible and he says all
[1:35:47] things are possible to you if you can
[1:35:49] believe
[1:35:50] maybe it's some habit and you don't
[1:35:52] can't down on a habit and you seem like
[1:35:53] you can't get the victory over
[1:35:56] it's time to make your move
[1:35:58] it's time you sell out lock stock and
[1:36:00] barrel and say god i'm going to serve
[1:36:01] you hella high water i'm going to serve
[1:36:04] you no matter what i'm moving from this
[1:36:06] point i've been in the mountain long
[1:36:07] enough i've stayed here long enough i've
[1:36:10] been here as long as i want i've got all
[1:36:11] the scars i got all the memories i know
[1:36:13] what this mountain looks like from the
[1:36:14] front to the back to the side i know the
[1:36:16] top and the bottom lord it's time to
[1:36:18] move forward
[1:36:20] so it's time that we leave the mountain
[1:36:22] and it's time that we start progressing
[1:36:24] into the promised land see some of us
[1:36:27] i'm gonna say us i'm gonna include
[1:36:28] myself just so i don't point anybody out
[1:36:30] but some of us
[1:36:32] we have camped out on justification
[1:36:34] oh bless god i'm saved
[1:36:38] there's more of the promises of god amen
[1:36:41] you need to move on into sanctification
[1:36:44] some of us have camped out on
[1:36:45] sanctification and you're living a godly
[1:36:47] life
[1:36:48] but there's more to the promises than
[1:36:50] that you need to pack up and you need to
[1:36:52] move on into the power of the holy
[1:36:54] spirit and let the holy spirit capstone
[1:36:56] your life and complete change your
[1:36:58] nature and keep you so committed to god
[1:37:01] when you want to give up you can't give
[1:37:03] up because you don't belong to yourself
[1:37:04] because you've been bought with a price
[1:37:06] and now the holy spirit owns you now the
[1:37:08] holy spirit is tabernacle and now the
[1:37:10] things that you used to do you don't do
[1:37:12] anymore
[1:37:14] but as long as you're camped out on
[1:37:15] sanctification well you can pick out
[1:37:17] flaws you can pick out this because a
[1:37:19] lot of times you find people in the
[1:37:20] sanctification process they're holier
[1:37:22] than thou they're going through the
[1:37:24] refining stage and they can pick out
[1:37:26] false but oh my when you finally step
[1:37:28] into grace of the holy spirit man you
[1:37:30] begin to have love one for another
[1:37:32] because you realize you didn't deserve
[1:37:34] what you got but god did it anyway
[1:37:36] because god called you he said you've
[1:37:38] been here long enough it's time that we
[1:37:39] step on into the promises of the baptism
[1:37:41] of the holy ghost and keep moving
[1:37:43] forward with the opening of the word
[1:37:45] notice church this bride is not in her
[1:37:47] infancy anymore
[1:37:49] we're not in the embassy of the message
[1:37:51] anymore we have come to be a mature
[1:37:54] bride and it's time that this mature
[1:37:56] bride begins to take possession of
[1:37:58] everything that belongs to her his time
[1:38:01] look we're without an excuse the word
[1:38:03] has been open it's time that we find
[1:38:05] ourself like john in the book of
[1:38:06] revelations when he saw his name in the
[1:38:09] book he wasn't afraid to shout he wasn't
[1:38:11] afraid to declare who he was he said all
[1:38:13] of heaven heard i john everything in
[1:38:15] heaven everything below heard me
[1:38:17] shouting why because john saw his name
[1:38:19] there he knew there wasn't enough devils
[1:38:21] in hell to take his name off the book
[1:38:23] what am i telling you church it's time
[1:38:25] that we move forward and realize your
[1:38:27] name has been inscribed in the pages of
[1:38:29] the book
[1:38:33] the promises of god are for you you're
[1:38:35] not an infant bride anymore you're a
[1:38:37] mature bride and a mature bride has a
[1:38:39] responsibility and the prophet of god
[1:38:41] said she had a sacred trust to holiness
[1:38:44] to righteousness to the anointing and to
[1:38:46] the word of god
[1:38:48] she's got a sacred she's got a sacred
[1:38:51] vow to those things and we got to keep
[1:38:52] it
[1:38:54] but we can't do that with unbelief
[1:38:57] see god gave us a promise the land is
[1:38:59] before you
[1:39:00] all that you have to do is go
[1:39:04] go that's a simple two-letter word even
[1:39:07] you newfees know what that means
[1:39:10] go not very hard you can look it up in
[1:39:14] webster it means the same thing there as
[1:39:15] it does on google
[1:39:17] get up and move
[1:39:20] so where do we go from here brother mark
[1:39:23] notice now deuteronomy 1 verse 20
[1:39:26] you have come unto the mountain of the
[1:39:28] amorites which the lord our god doeth
[1:39:30] give unto us
[1:39:32] notice he's given you the promise
[1:39:34] verse 21 behold the
[1:39:36] lord thy god has set the land before you
[1:39:39] go up and possess it as the lord
[1:39:42] god of thy fathers has said unto thee
[1:39:45] fear not
[1:39:47] neither be discouraged
[1:39:50] so god has set the promises before this
[1:39:53] is your land
[1:39:56] this belongs to you
[1:39:57] well you know what we find the same
[1:39:59] parallel in the book of acts and we look
[1:40:01] in acts 2 and 38 and peter said unto
[1:40:04] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:40:06] you otherwise put your unbelief aside
[1:40:09] i've given you in the name of jesus
[1:40:11] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:40:12] and you shall now he's declaring you
[1:40:15] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:40:18] which is the believer's promised land
[1:40:21] notice for the promise is unto you it's
[1:40:24] unto your children it's unto them that
[1:40:26] are far off even as many as the lord our
[1:40:29] god shall call
[1:40:31] god it's called whosoever will let them
[1:40:33] come
[1:40:34] i'll give you the land occupy the land
[1:40:37] but you got to do something to to get to
[1:40:39] the land and that's you got to move
[1:40:41] and you got to make your move the
[1:40:42] prophet of god would tell us in god
[1:40:43] using this gift he said every promise is
[1:40:46] yay and amen to the believer every
[1:40:49] promise in the book belongs to the
[1:40:51] believer how many your believer this
[1:40:53] morning
[1:40:54] so every promise this morning belongs to
[1:40:56] you i don't care how small i don't care
[1:40:58] how big i don't care how far away i want
[1:41:00] you to know today that that promise
[1:41:02] belongs to you it belongs to your
[1:41:04] children it belongs to your siblings it
[1:41:06] belongs to you this morning it belongs
[1:41:08] to you this morning whatever your need
[1:41:10] is he said ask for big things because
[1:41:13] big things is just as easy with god as
[1:41:16] small things
[1:41:19] he said it doesn't matter about our
[1:41:20] numbers you know god can meet it when in
[1:41:22] circles of 500 he can meet in circles of
[1:41:24] 50 he can mean in circles or two or
[1:41:26] three and sometimes we just kind of cast
[1:41:28] guard that two or three
[1:41:30] what does that mean well this ain't a
[1:41:32] very big church
[1:41:34] but the prophet of god said you give me
[1:41:35] two people on fire for god to do more
[1:41:37] for the church than 40 revivals
[1:41:40] so if he's there in the midst of two or
[1:41:41] three what kind of service can we have
[1:41:43] this morning
[1:41:45] we got about 30 people here this morning
[1:41:47] i say man let's have church
[1:41:49] i mean let's get behind the word of god
[1:41:51] and let's pull on let's rise up and pull
[1:41:53] up our our tent states and move into the
[1:41:55] promised land of the word of god
[1:41:57] he said christ keeps all his words he
[1:41:59] has to he has to do it i don't have to
[1:42:03] i'm mortal i'm subject to mistakes he's
[1:42:05] immortal let's go back on that real
[1:42:07] quick i just caught something
[1:42:08] inspiration just hit notice the problem
[1:42:10] of god says i'm mortal subject to
[1:42:13] mistakes
[1:42:15] well we thought he was perfect
[1:42:18] well i then think a prophet made
[1:42:20] mistakes
[1:42:22] under the anointing he doesn't
[1:42:25] but outside of that anointing he's just
[1:42:26] a regular man like you and i
[1:42:28] man
[1:42:29] but notice he says christ because that's
[1:42:31] the one we're focusing on
[1:42:33] and i love about our prophetess because
[1:42:35] he never pointed to himself he never
[1:42:37] pointed to his ministry he pointed us to
[1:42:39] christ
[1:42:40] always pointed this bride to christ his
[1:42:42] purpose his mission his vision his
[1:42:45] his his commission was to call out a
[1:42:47] bride
[1:42:48] for the bridegroom notice christ keeps
[1:42:50] all his words he has to he has to do it
[1:42:53] ah oh my
[1:42:55] i don't have to
[1:42:57] but you're a prophet but i'm mortal
[1:43:00] but you're a prophet
[1:43:01] i'm subject to mistakes but you're a
[1:43:04] prophet
[1:43:05] see he's immortal infallible he has to
[1:43:08] keep his but i don't have to keep mine
[1:43:10] and you don't have to keep yours
[1:43:13] so it's okay for us not to keep our end
[1:43:15] of the bargain but yet we exalt the
[1:43:17] prophet up here
[1:43:18] the prophet said don't look to me look
[1:43:20] to the christ
[1:43:21] look to the look to the anointing look
[1:43:23] to him he goes you don't have to keep
[1:43:25] your yours but he does oh doesn't that
[1:43:28] just place something in you to know that
[1:43:31] he he's absolutely bound to that word
[1:43:35] not a prophet not a preacher not a
[1:43:38] pastor not an evangelist not a deacon
[1:43:41] not a mom not a dad
[1:43:43] but god is bound to that word
[1:43:48] noticing what did he say and i've gone
[1:43:50] over this several times because
[1:43:52] sometimes i'm very repetitive i'm not a
[1:43:53] teacher but i'm just a full-on
[1:43:55] evangelist and sometimes you learn
[1:43:56] things by repetition
[1:43:58] i was taught by that by a good teacher
[1:44:00] my pastor he does a lot of repeating at
[1:44:02] times and eventually you get it it
[1:44:04] sticks
[1:44:05] what we find here christ
[1:44:08] in ephesians 5 20 he said he his purpose
[1:44:10] he was going to present to himself a
[1:44:12] glorious church
[1:44:14] not some failed church
[1:44:16] not some dismantled church not some
[1:44:18] bruised up church who's just been
[1:44:20] manhandling beat up and tossed about
[1:44:22] don't know where she's going don't know
[1:44:24] where she come from but no he's going to
[1:44:25] present to himself a glorious church not
[1:44:28] having a spot not having a wrinkle or
[1:44:30] any such thing but that should be holy
[1:44:33] without blemish
[1:44:35] so god's got an image of his bride and
[1:44:37] she's not going to have a blemish oh you
[1:44:39] may have woke up this morning for some
[1:44:41] of you that have full-length mirrors and
[1:44:42] you looking at me like oh my god
[1:44:45] oh
[1:44:46] man all you saw was blemishes
[1:44:48] you see wrinkles
[1:44:50] i don't know don't say amen to that
[1:44:53] some of you've probably seen i look in
[1:44:55] the sink i'm like oh my goodness my hair
[1:44:56] is falling out
[1:44:59] but we find we don't see what we see
[1:45:02] here
[1:45:03] because we're seeing through the eyes of
[1:45:05] humanity but see he's not looking
[1:45:07] through the eyes of humanity he's
[1:45:08] looking through the eyes of his promise
[1:45:10] he says i'm gonna have a glorious church
[1:45:13] and lotus the prophet of god tapped into
[1:45:15] the vision of what god saw when you look
[1:45:17] into the invisible union of the bride of
[1:45:19] christ he says you are
[1:45:21] the pure the virtuous the sinless bride
[1:45:25] of the son of the living god every man
[1:45:27] and woman that's born of the spirit and
[1:45:30] washed in the blood of jesus christ and
[1:45:32] believes every word of god stands as
[1:45:34] though you never sinned in the first
[1:45:37] place
[1:45:38] so he's declaring in his word in
[1:45:40] ephesians 5 27 this is what my bride is
[1:45:43] gonna be and then he sends down a
[1:45:45] seventh angel a seventh messenger a
[1:45:47] prophet and he taps into the mind of god
[1:45:49] and he declares this is what you are you
[1:45:52] know sometimes we can see without
[1:45:53] blemish but oh man to have god put it in
[1:45:56] color and he tells you you are the pure
[1:45:58] you are the virtuous you are the sinless
[1:46:00] bride of the son of the living god he
[1:46:02] says you're standing completely you
[1:46:04] never sin at the first place god don't
[1:46:07] even know
[1:46:10] oh man that should make you shout
[1:46:13] man that should make you shout knowing
[1:46:14] that you you're living in failed
[1:46:16] humanity you're living in a body that's
[1:46:18] not been redeemed yet you're living in a
[1:46:20] body that's still failing you you're
[1:46:22] living in a body that's not been
[1:46:23] converted yet but god is telling you
[1:46:25] never sin in the first place god don't
[1:46:28] even know it it's in the sea of
[1:46:30] forgiveness you never did it you were
[1:46:32] accused of it by the accuser but really
[1:46:34] from the beginning you were
[1:46:36] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:46:39] of god and you're standing there was
[1:46:41] that's how you're there today church
[1:46:43] you're not some dirty somebody you're
[1:46:45] not just some fly-by-night member of a
[1:46:47] church no but you're the wise you're the
[1:46:49] virtuous you're the pure you're the
[1:46:51] sinless bride of the lord jesus christ
[1:46:55] he says you're the virtuous bride of
[1:46:57] christ washed in the blood of christ
[1:47:00] precious virtuous sinless son of god
[1:47:03] standing with a pure
[1:47:05] unadulterated bride word that he washed
[1:47:08] us by the water of his own blood that
[1:47:11] become flesh and manifested that notice
[1:47:13] that he might take you which were
[1:47:15] predestinated in the bosom of the father
[1:47:17] before the before the beginning the same
[1:47:20] as he was oh i love this
[1:47:24] you know what a promise to the believer
[1:47:27] you're not getting this in the
[1:47:28] denominational system you're not getting
[1:47:30] this wandering around the desert
[1:47:33] you're not getting this in egypt no this
[1:47:36] is promised land manna
[1:47:38] prophet of god went on the other side
[1:47:40] and he's come back and told you this is
[1:47:41] who you are
[1:47:42] this is what the word declares that you
[1:47:44] are
[1:47:45] satan declares you're a sinner satan
[1:47:47] says you're a castaway satan says you
[1:47:49] might as well give up satan says nobody
[1:47:50] cares about you but here christ is
[1:47:52] coming through a prophet saying you are
[1:47:54] the pure sinless
[1:47:56] you've never done it in the first place
[1:47:58] where's the first place in the back part
[1:48:00] of god's mind you were a thought god
[1:48:03] thought of you when when god thought
[1:48:04] about what he was going to do and how he
[1:48:06] was going to do it he knew you'd be
[1:48:07] sitting right here this morning
[1:48:09] he knew you'd have a prayer line last
[1:48:11] night he knew there'd be a breakthrough
[1:48:13] for the church last night he knew that
[1:48:14] nothing would stand before the sinner's
[1:48:16] prayer or the believer's prayer not even
[1:48:17] cancer and he knew right here this
[1:48:19] morning what topic to bring it's time
[1:48:22] that we make our move and rise up from
[1:48:24] the mountain that we've been kept out
[1:48:25] around and take our steps into the land
[1:48:27] of the promise
[1:48:30] see god never seen you as a sinner
[1:48:33] he saw you as a son and daughter of god
[1:48:35] amen
[1:48:37] now you're standing as a pure
[1:48:39] unadulterated bride word that he was
[1:48:43] not washed by man
[1:48:44] man didn't talk you into it and man
[1:48:47] can't talk you out of it
[1:48:48] man never won me to christ i had a voice
[1:48:51] come to me in a car
[1:48:52] driving 120 miles an hour down the road
[1:48:54] trying to take my life it wasn't a man i
[1:48:57] didn't go speak to a man about my
[1:48:59] condition god dealt with me
[1:49:01] now you may not have that supernatural
[1:49:03] experience but nevertheless god can
[1:49:05] speak to you in a service just like he
[1:49:06] did for many of you last night but
[1:49:08] notice kadesh barnea where the children
[1:49:10] of israel made their mistake the prophet
[1:49:13] of god will tell us but we're going to
[1:49:14] look back here and deuteronomy they
[1:49:15] turned and they went up into the
[1:49:16] mountain and they came into the valley
[1:49:18] of esco and they searched it out
[1:49:22] and they took the fruit of the land
[1:49:25] you know it's one thing to tell somebody
[1:49:27] about it
[1:49:30] try to paint them a picture
[1:49:32] try to be very i'm not a very detailed
[1:49:34] person
[1:49:35] i'm like get me to the back of the book
[1:49:37] give me the punchline let's be done with
[1:49:38] this i don't need all this frivolous
[1:49:41] stuff in the middle but some people love
[1:49:42] all that frivolous
[1:49:44] they want all the little intricate
[1:49:45] details i'm like man i ain't got time
[1:49:46] for that i'm gonna go get her let's go
[1:49:48] and get
[1:49:49] get me to the back of the book i'll find
[1:49:51] out give me the cliff notes i'm good
[1:49:53] how i made it through college is still a
[1:49:55] mystery
[1:49:57] but we find here they came and they had
[1:50:00] the fruit of the land in their hands
[1:50:02] they brought back some water brother
[1:50:04] lush from the promised land now i can
[1:50:06] talk to you about this world i can tell
[1:50:07] man that water tastes so good and just
[1:50:09] keep the water you never see it
[1:50:11] man that water was so crystal clear it
[1:50:13] was so cold it was you just had to be
[1:50:15] there
[1:50:16] but you never see it but when i come and
[1:50:19] present you the water
[1:50:20] and you can see the water and you can
[1:50:22] taste the water and i'm telling you look
[1:50:25] this is what's in the land i can talk to
[1:50:27] you about cancer i can talk to you about
[1:50:29] alopecia i can talk to you about a
[1:50:31] little boy who never walked in the
[1:50:32] spirit of god swept into the room and he
[1:50:33] got up and he hasn't stopped walking
[1:50:35] since he hadn't he just ran his first 5k
[1:50:38] race back around easter time or
[1:50:39] something like that what am i telling
[1:50:41] i'm talking to you about the fruits of
[1:50:43] the land
[1:50:45] he said they brought it down unto us and
[1:50:47] they brought us word again and said it
[1:50:49] is a good notice their confession it's a
[1:50:52] good land which the lord our god doeth
[1:50:55] give us
[1:50:57] but in verse 26 notwithstanding
[1:51:00] you will not go
[1:51:02] where do we go from here
[1:51:05] i told you about the evidence
[1:51:08] but where did we go from here
[1:51:10] notwithstanding you would not go but you
[1:51:13] rebelled
[1:51:16] you rebelled against the commandment of
[1:51:18] the lord your god and the prophet of god
[1:51:20] said israel made his mistake when it
[1:51:23] stopped amen
[1:51:26] it made its mistake when it stopped when
[1:51:28] they went over there and they stopped
[1:51:31] marching they started wandering
[1:51:34] church don't ever stop
[1:51:37] ministers in this church today don't you
[1:51:39] ever stop preaching this pure gospel you
[1:51:41] preach with everything in your heart
[1:51:43] you preach until your mind is numb and
[1:51:45] you don't know anything else but you
[1:51:46] know this word and you know it's true
[1:51:48] and you know it's faithful and you may
[1:51:49] spit it out over and over and it may be
[1:51:50] the same thing but you keep preaching it
[1:51:52] you keep preaching it you keep
[1:51:53] proclaiming it you keep proclaiming
[1:51:55] don't ever back off of the promises of
[1:51:57] god
[1:51:58] because the promises of god are yea and
[1:52:00] amen to every believer
[1:52:04] see when you stop marching when you stop
[1:52:07] moving forward in the present truth in
[1:52:10] the word of the hour you start wandering
[1:52:14] you begin to find every reason not to go
[1:52:17] forward
[1:52:19] you begin to open up your mental
[1:52:21] capacities to doubts into reasons and
[1:52:25] you begin to find faults
[1:52:26] you begin to complain
[1:52:29] well so-and-so did this
[1:52:32] well so-and-so did that
[1:52:33] so-and-so said this
[1:52:35] so-and-so said that
[1:52:38] now i would say this
[1:52:40] this church is not the promised land
[1:52:42] you're going to get hurt
[1:52:44] there's going to be wounds not
[1:52:46] intentional wounds
[1:52:49] but we've got to be willing to move
[1:52:50] forward and not let those wounds keep us
[1:52:53] wandering
[1:52:54] and circling
[1:52:56] and wandering
[1:52:57] and circling
[1:52:58] notice you find people all they want to
[1:53:00] do is they want to complain about this
[1:53:02] when they want to complain about that
[1:53:03] when you think man how's that it's never
[1:53:05] you
[1:53:06] you ever wonder that maybe that's just
[1:53:07] me i'm thinking man you pick out this
[1:53:10] problem on this person you find fault in
[1:53:12] this person you find fault in this
[1:53:14] preacher you find fault in this deacon
[1:53:15] you don't like this sister you don't
[1:53:17] like correct singing i mean there's
[1:53:19] everybody's at fault
[1:53:21] when did god die make you god
[1:53:24] but see the problem is that that person
[1:53:26] had stopped short of the promise and
[1:53:28] they started wandering
[1:53:30] and then they started complaining then
[1:53:32] they started murmuring and see they're
[1:53:34] not looking at the promised land they're
[1:53:35] just going around the mouth and picking
[1:53:37] out everything that they can pick out
[1:53:39] and we find when you
[1:53:41] when you stop moving forward you start
[1:53:43] wondering is this right is that right is
[1:53:46] the cloud right did that really happen
[1:53:48] was it really a rocket was it not a
[1:53:49] rocket how many fell off the bridge was
[1:53:52] it how are they trying to describe it
[1:53:53] did it really happen we can't find
[1:53:55] articles here do we really care
[1:53:58] come on let me tell you i'm not worried
[1:53:59] about the cloud i'm not worried about
[1:54:01] the bridge all i do is when i get to the
[1:54:03] end of a tape and i see a prayer line
[1:54:04] and i see him begin to call your name
[1:54:06] out here so and so you're from such and
[1:54:07] such this is your problem what i
[1:54:09] realized right then i'm not worried
[1:54:11] about the cloud you can take a picture
[1:54:12] all day long of any cloud you want but
[1:54:14] i'm declaring right there there's a
[1:54:16] prophet ministry there's christ coming
[1:54:18] down in this day there's god discerning
[1:54:20] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:54:21] and not only that pronouncing healing
[1:54:23] pronouncing deliverance pronouncing the
[1:54:25] gift of god over their life that's what
[1:54:27] i'm looking at but if you're if you stop
[1:54:29] short of the promised land you begin to
[1:54:32] wonder
[1:54:34] well he said it this way here and he
[1:54:35] said it this way there certainly he
[1:54:37] can't be right i mean come on
[1:54:40] how many are over 40
[1:54:43] oh god i show our hands how do you how
[1:54:46] many of you remember everything exactly
[1:54:48] the same that it took place 20 years ago
[1:54:51] are you for real
[1:54:59] gotcha
[1:55:00] so we made brother mark blush last night
[1:55:01] we make you bless today
[1:55:05] but you don't remember things exactly
[1:55:07] saying why
[1:55:08] because we're human
[1:55:10] and this brain of ours is an organ that
[1:55:13] begins to decay over time
[1:55:15] it's not lively it's not vibrant when
[1:55:17] you get past 40 good lord
[1:55:20] things start checking out and you're
[1:55:21] backing up like no we're moving forward
[1:55:23] brain
[1:55:24] but we find these things and yet they
[1:55:26] want to find every little fault
[1:55:29] you begin to wonder
[1:55:30] i mean really is he a prophet or did he
[1:55:32] make mistakes as a man he made mistakes
[1:55:34] but underneath that anointing he was a
[1:55:36] prophet
[1:55:37] he never failed it never missed
[1:55:40] under the anointing
[1:55:41] when dust said the lord followed
[1:55:44] whatever was said you can count on it
[1:55:47] and that's what we have to differentiate
[1:55:50] and we have to learn that we don't want
[1:55:51] to exalt a man to a level because a
[1:55:53] man's gonna fail he says i make mistakes
[1:55:56] but we find here if you're kept short of
[1:55:58] the promised land you begin to wonder
[1:56:00] well even is the holy ghost for me
[1:56:03] can i even be healed have i gone too far
[1:56:06] have my kids gone too far
[1:56:10] have they straight is there enough time
[1:56:12] left see the promise is unto you
[1:56:16] to your children even to those that are
[1:56:18] so far out there they don't even know
[1:56:20] they want god
[1:56:22] what a promise
[1:56:24] what a promise look let me tell you how
[1:56:26] do you know that brother because i was
[1:56:28] one that wasn't looking for god i didn't
[1:56:30] know i needed god but there was a
[1:56:31] promise given to me it was a promise
[1:56:33] given to my grandmother who was a
[1:56:35] believer and she no doubt prayed for her
[1:56:37] grandchildren and one day in the most
[1:56:40] inopportune time at the most inopportune
[1:56:42] place at the wrong speed obviously and
[1:56:45] yet the voice of god came in my car and
[1:56:47] said turn your car around i wasn't
[1:56:50] looking for god but the promise of god
[1:56:52] held true the holy ghost is for you it's
[1:56:55] for your children it's for those that
[1:56:57] are far off even those that ain't
[1:56:58] looking for god it's for them today
[1:57:01] don't give up on your loved one don't
[1:57:02] give up on your children don't give up
[1:57:04] on your family don't give up on your
[1:57:06] friend we got a promise of god
[1:57:10] we can take it church
[1:57:13] we can take it so they came to the land
[1:57:16] whither thou sent us us and they said
[1:57:18] surely it floweth with milk and honey
[1:57:20] and this is the fruit of it notice
[1:57:22] nevertheless
[1:57:24] they're looking at the problems
[1:57:26] nevertheless the people be strong that
[1:57:29] dwell in the land the cities are walled
[1:57:31] and very great and moreover we saw the
[1:57:34] children of anec there the malachites
[1:57:36] dwell in the land of the south and the
[1:57:38] hittites and the jebusites and the
[1:57:40] amorites they dwell in the mountains and
[1:57:42] the canaanites throw down by the sea
[1:57:44] and by the coast of jordan
[1:57:46] so notice
[1:57:47] 10 spies out of 12
[1:57:50] tasted the very same thing that caleb
[1:57:52] and joshua did
[1:57:54] let us put like this they sat in the
[1:57:55] same surface
[1:57:57] felt the same anointing
[1:57:59] seeing the same outpouring
[1:58:01] seeing a little boy give his heart to
[1:58:02] the lord
[1:58:03] seeing jensen receive healing just like
[1:58:05] that
[1:58:07] seen a girl dedicate our life back to
[1:58:09] god like that
[1:58:11] they seemed they witnessed it
[1:58:14] they saw the pictures same way you saw
[1:58:17] him last night
[1:58:19] and yet they brought back a completely
[1:58:21] different report
[1:58:23] how can 12 people look at the same thing
[1:58:25] and come 10 of them see something
[1:58:27] different
[1:58:30] how can 12 people look at the same thing
[1:58:33] and 10 of them see something different
[1:58:36] see these spies walked through the land
[1:58:39] they were 40 days in the promised land
[1:58:43] man they were feasting on grapes
[1:58:46] they feasted on all that the land had
[1:58:48] i'm sure it's probably unimaginable
[1:58:51] what that land provided as far as
[1:58:53] production of fruit and and everything
[1:58:56] else they had all the land at their
[1:58:58] fingertips they walked through it they
[1:58:59] spotted they saw the mountains they saw
[1:59:01] how glorious it was they saw the cliffs
[1:59:04] they saw that oh yeah they saw a couple
[1:59:05] giants
[1:59:08] you know but caleb and joshua saw the
[1:59:10] same mountains saw the same giants took
[1:59:12] her the same fruit and yet they said the
[1:59:15] land is a land of milk and honey you
[1:59:17] know what milk and honey represents it
[1:59:19] means fertility of the soil it's
[1:59:21] productive and prosperous otherwise it's
[1:59:23] a rich land that's full of natural
[1:59:25] resources
[1:59:27] now they left the bering lands of egypt
[1:59:30] and they're coming into a land that god
[1:59:31] had given them a land that was rich with
[1:59:34] natural resources
[1:59:36] where cultivated you can cultivate
[1:59:38] produce and things of that nature the
[1:59:39] oriental will use this term milk and
[1:59:41] honey and they would say it's to drink
[1:59:43] in the food of gods
[1:59:45] so what was god doing god was leading
[1:59:48] more gods into the promised land a land
[1:59:51] that was only fit for other gods
[1:59:54] what has god done in this day
[1:59:56] he's given you spiritual food in due
[1:59:58] season not everybody's partaking of this
[2:00:01] man this milk in this honey it's only
[2:00:03] for the elect but if we stop short of it
[2:00:06] you never reach the promised land
[2:00:09] notice they ate they explored the beauty
[2:00:11] of the glory of the land but when it
[2:00:12] came time to tell others about the land
[2:00:16] they gave a negative report
[2:00:19] see it's okay for them to experience a
[2:00:21] revival it's okay for them to shout in
[2:00:23] church it's okay for them to enjoy the
[2:00:26] presence of the lord
[2:00:27] but not the people
[2:00:29] not the congregation
[2:00:32] and we find the same thing today is
[2:00:34] happening in the ranks of the message
[2:00:37] i'm going to be very
[2:00:38] very blunt here but at the same time we
[2:00:40] find today there's churches that don't
[2:00:42] no longer want prayer lines in their
[2:00:44] church
[2:00:45] because they refuse to fight the giants
[2:00:48] in the lives of the people
[2:00:49] too much work too much effort but god
[2:00:53] said it's yours
[2:00:55] what were we doing last night we were
[2:00:56] fighting giants
[2:00:59] oh it made it look simple but it was a
[2:01:01] giant in the life of that individual
[2:01:03] and god said we could have it
[2:01:05] and i refuse i'm a caleb i refuse to
[2:01:07] back off the promise of god god you give
[2:01:09] me my mountain
[2:01:10] i'm here to fight i'm here to put my
[2:01:12] shoulder to the wheel with that brother
[2:01:13] that sister of the ministry here and
[2:01:15] we're going to fight for the promises of
[2:01:16] god
[2:01:18] notice we have men today they've tasted
[2:01:20] of the land they've seen the milk and
[2:01:22] honey flow but they don't want their
[2:01:23] congregation their congregation to
[2:01:25] partake of it no there are no there's
[2:01:27] some today that no longer want altar
[2:01:29] calls
[2:01:30] i know altar calls prolonged service
[2:01:32] doesn't it
[2:01:33] well shame on you your carnal
[2:01:34] carnal-minded thing
[2:01:37] amen and yet that individual has come up
[2:01:40] in a walled city in their mind and they
[2:01:42] come up to the altar and they're looking
[2:01:44] to be free and god said i've given you
[2:01:46] the land you can pull down the walls
[2:01:48] that are surrounding that city and bring
[2:01:50] that individual to freedom
[2:01:52] but we find they don't want it was good
[2:01:54] for them when they were a kid or when
[2:01:55] they were a young a center out in the
[2:01:57] world and they needed an altar
[2:01:58] experience
[2:02:00] but now it's not any good for the
[2:02:01] members of the church
[2:02:04] see it's okay for them they tasted of it
[2:02:06] the prophet of god will tell us now
[2:02:08] every generation has its own revival
[2:02:11] it gets its chance at the word
[2:02:15] so who were we to keep this generation
[2:02:17] from their chance
[2:02:19] who are we as men of god as churches
[2:02:21] leadership or who are we to refuse this
[2:02:24] generation their opportunity at the word
[2:02:28] and we find the people be too strong in
[2:02:30] the land and they bring a negative
[2:02:32] report you know and it's just like satan
[2:02:34] that's what he loves he loves to put a
[2:02:36] negative report or let me say it like
[2:02:37] this he loves to plant scarecrows in
[2:02:39] front of the promise
[2:02:42] scarecrow how many have ever seen a
[2:02:43] scarecrow y'all have those here in
[2:02:45] newfoundland probably not no not really
[2:02:47] well you probably see it in facebook
[2:02:49] somewhere
[2:02:50] but a scarecrow is a
[2:02:53] straw bean don't have a face
[2:02:56] just got clothes on look they got it
[2:02:58] y'all know what it is okay do y'all want
[2:03:00] me to google it real quick and show you
[2:03:01] a picture no
[2:03:03] i appreciate it but brother brown says
[2:03:04] now the devil's nothing but a scarecrow
[2:03:08] just scares you into something he said
[2:03:11] he has no legal rights at all he was
[2:03:13] stripped of every right principalities
[2:03:16] spoiled of everything that he did at
[2:03:17] calvary there was
[2:03:19] he begins to tell this story he says
[2:03:20] there was a man that lived down there
[2:03:22] and he really loved birds and he had a
[2:03:24] wild strawberry patch and he wouldn't
[2:03:26] let nobody bother he kept it there for
[2:03:28] the birds and he went to florida one
[2:03:30] year and he didn't get back in time and
[2:03:32] some fella he wanted to pick those
[2:03:34] berries so he put a big old scarecrow
[2:03:36] out in the field to keep the birds away
[2:03:38] and that's what satan has done
[2:03:41] oh he he's got a beautiful field here
[2:03:43] for us full of promises and he hasn't
[2:03:45] come back in time so satan has camped
[2:03:47] out and put a scarecrow in the field to
[2:03:49] keep you from the promises
[2:03:51] he says
[2:03:53] he says now he said well i thought he
[2:03:55] goes well i thought that was amazing
[2:03:57] because i thought that was amazing
[2:03:59] remember let me back up excuse me and
[2:04:00] these birds making their habit of coming
[2:04:02] there every year they came to service
[2:04:04] every sunday every wednesday every
[2:04:06] special meeting they come and they found
[2:04:08] this patch and there was a scarecrow in
[2:04:10] it and some of them birds were sitting
[2:04:12] up in the trees some were sitting on the
[2:04:13] tele to telegraph wires some on the
[2:04:15] poles and they were just squawking and
[2:04:17] carrying on about it
[2:04:19] what is that scarecrow doing down there
[2:04:21] i can't overcome i can't this you know
[2:04:23] how it is right satan plants a scarecrow
[2:04:26] in your life fear grips you and some
[2:04:28] reason now your your faith just turned
[2:04:29] to doubt he says well i thought that was
[2:04:31] amazing look at that but to my amazement
[2:04:33] right in the middle of the patch sitting
[2:04:36] right on the arm of that scare ro or
[2:04:38] scarecrow said two great big crows just
[2:04:41] eating their bully their belly full
[2:04:44] just as hard as they could
[2:04:47] two
[2:04:48] scare two crows
[2:04:50] all the other crows are sitting back on
[2:04:52] the wires squawking about it we can't do
[2:04:54] this we can't do that and we don't
[2:04:56] believe in miracles anymore the days of
[2:04:58] miracles is passing we can't have
[2:04:59] emotion in the church anymore we can't
[2:05:01] let the holy ghost there's no such thing
[2:05:03] as speaking in tongues anymore that went
[2:05:04] away when the problem went off because
[2:05:06] now we're no longer pentecost now we got
[2:05:08] to move away we got the word word word
[2:05:10] word word and they realize there's a
[2:05:12] scarecrow in the patch but god has put
[2:05:14] promises behind that scrap crop and
[2:05:16] there's two crows sitting on the right
[2:05:18] arm and on the left arm and they're
[2:05:19] feeding on the word of god they're
[2:05:21] feeding on him and he will say there's
[2:05:23] no condemnation to them that are
[2:05:25] feasting on the strawberries and i'm
[2:05:26] going to tell you tonight church there's
[2:05:28] no condemnation to those who are walking
[2:05:30] in victory there's no condemnation to
[2:05:33] those who have decided i'm making my
[2:05:35] move to the promised land there's no
[2:05:37] condemnation that those that are feeling
[2:05:39] their spiritual appetite by the promised
[2:05:41] word of god there's no condemnation
[2:05:43] tonight those that are feasting on
[2:05:45] heavenly manner there's no condemnation
[2:05:47] for you tonight just move past the
[2:05:49] scarecrows in your life god's promised
[2:05:51] you the land
[2:05:53] there's no life in that scarecrow satan
[2:05:55] is nothing but a bluff he's been
[2:05:57] defeated he's been stripped of every
[2:05:59] power and authority
[2:06:01] yes sir
[2:06:06] let people say what they want to say
[2:06:10] but what god what does god say about it
[2:06:14] let them say what they want to say but
[2:06:15] what does god say about it
[2:06:17] so this when they came to the border
[2:06:18] land academy barnea
[2:06:21] oh my i've been gone an hour
[2:06:23] when they got to the land and they
[2:06:25] looked over into the promised land
[2:06:28] notice he's talking about caleb and
[2:06:30] joshua or he's talking about the ten
[2:06:31] spies here they looked into the land
[2:06:35] they saw the videos they saw the proof
[2:06:37] of it and they said we can't take it
[2:06:41] he goes what was the other ten they
[2:06:43] looked at the circumstances the prestige
[2:06:46] of what they would lose and they said we
[2:06:48] are grasshoppers
[2:06:49] on the side of the others but we have
[2:06:51] been taught by the message that we have
[2:06:53] brought out even this past weekend that
[2:06:55] we're not to look at circumstances we're
[2:06:58] not to look at anything to distract us
[2:07:00] from the promise and we are to look at
[2:07:02] this word in this word only we are
[2:07:03] taught to believe all the promises of
[2:07:06] god are yea and amen to the believer so
[2:07:08] many believers continue today to look at
[2:07:10] the giants him wondering why their homes
[2:07:13] are in trouble
[2:07:14] oh they sit on the pew but their homes
[2:07:16] are in shambles
[2:07:18] because they're not looking at the
[2:07:19] promise
[2:07:20] they're looking at the problems
[2:07:23] instead of having an altar call and a
[2:07:24] prayer meeting in their house and a time
[2:07:26] of devotion they just let willy-nilly
[2:07:28] anything come in and anything go and
[2:07:30] they wonder why their house is in chaos
[2:07:34] because you got to keep the word before
[2:07:36] us
[2:07:36] because it's the promise
[2:07:39] you got to keep the word pulled you got
[2:07:40] to keep in tune you don't let things
[2:07:42] come in your home that shouldn't be in
[2:07:44] your home
[2:07:46] and i understand you may get a black eye
[2:07:47] from it because some people may not be
[2:07:49] where you are in your your process with
[2:07:52] your kids i mean my wife and i we have
[2:07:54] four kids and i think they probably
[2:07:55] would say we're probably the most rigid
[2:07:56] ones out of the entire church
[2:07:59] we don't feel that way but hey i'm glad
[2:08:00] that's what you think
[2:08:02] because i know when your kids come to my
[2:08:04] house their cell phones ain't going in
[2:08:05] the bedrooms their cell phones are
[2:08:06] coming on the bar they're gonna be left
[2:08:08] there at night there ain't gonna be no
[2:08:09] secret
[2:08:10] surfing on the internet at my house
[2:08:13] there ain't gonna be little things
[2:08:14] slipped in little movies that shouldn't
[2:08:16] be slipping in here and little things
[2:08:17] here because we're in tune with it
[2:08:19] because why i got a responsibility i'm
[2:08:21] taking my kids to the promised land i'm
[2:08:23] not throwing them out there to the
[2:08:24] gators
[2:08:27] notice but they lacked faith these ten
[2:08:30] spies lacked faith and their doubt had
[2:08:32] turned to unbelief and their unbelief
[2:08:34] turned to rebellion against god
[2:08:36] notice instead of saying
[2:08:38] notice how the word would say in numbers
[2:08:40] 13 and verse 27 they told him and said
[2:08:43] we came unto the land whither thou
[2:08:46] sentenced us
[2:08:47] verses saying
[2:08:50] we have come to the land which the lord
[2:08:51] giveth us
[2:08:54] sinneth versus giveth so that perception
[2:08:56] was wrong about the promise
[2:08:58] and when your perception gets turned
[2:09:00] around and it's not well god's sending
[2:09:02] you here and this this message is a
[2:09:03] bunch of do's and don'ts a bunch of
[2:09:04] regulations but it becomes man it's my
[2:09:07] message
[2:09:08] it's my promise
[2:09:10] this is for me
[2:09:11] it's no longer i got to do this and i
[2:09:13] got through that because your perception
[2:09:14] has changed and that was the thing with
[2:09:16] caleb and joshua they didn't have the
[2:09:18] perception of well god's sending us here
[2:09:20] no this is my lane god's giving it to me
[2:09:23] guys give me that mountain god give me
[2:09:25] that patch of ground god's giving me
[2:09:26] that there god give me that city i'm
[2:09:28] gonna change that city to the city of
[2:09:29] joe
[2:09:32] start picking out your city that's right
[2:09:34] start picking out your mountain
[2:09:36] start claiming it for your own
[2:09:38] look 40 years later they didn't get to
[2:09:40] enter into the land but caleb never
[2:09:41] forgot his mountain kayla kept his mind
[2:09:43] on his mountain and you may have gone
[2:09:45] around and around and it seems like time
[2:09:47] has given up on you and this has given
[2:09:49] up on you but i want you to know god is
[2:09:50] raising up another crop and caleb was
[2:09:52] still alive and caleb said joshua hey
[2:09:55] you remember moses told me when i went
[2:09:56] in there i picked out my mountain i want
[2:09:59] my mountain give me my mountain how
[2:10:01] won't my kid say i want my kids built
[2:10:04] with the holy ghost i don't care if it
[2:10:06] took 40 years 50 years give me my mouth
[2:10:09] and give me my promise it belongs to me
[2:10:12] he never took his eyes off the promise
[2:10:15] no longer no matter how long he had to
[2:10:17] dwell in the wilderness
[2:10:19] oh sons of god i'm telling you this
[2:10:21] morning keep your eyes on the promise
[2:10:23] where do we go from here it's time that
[2:10:26] we pack up and we move into the promised
[2:10:28] land of the word of god
[2:10:32] they saw giants
[2:10:34] caleb saw victory
[2:10:36] they saw walled cities
[2:10:38] caleb saw a dwelling place
[2:10:40] oh what are you looking for
[2:10:43] they tasted other grapes caleb's like
[2:10:45] i'm gonna make me a salad
[2:10:47] i'm gonna put all this together this is
[2:10:49] gonna be great
[2:10:52] see they looked at the obstacles
[2:10:55] they didn't look at the promise of god
[2:10:57] they looked at the hindrances they
[2:10:59] looked at the sickness in their body
[2:11:01] they looked at the disappointments that
[2:11:03] life was brought on they looked at the
[2:11:05] hurts and the scars from somebody at
[2:11:07] church but they never looked at the
[2:11:09] promise oh church i'm trying to get your
[2:11:11] eyes off the problems get your eyes off
[2:11:13] the circumstance get your eyes on the
[2:11:15] promise
[2:11:16] and notice when they came back and gave
[2:11:18] their report amen their crowd of
[2:11:21] unbelief had such an influence to the
[2:11:24] congregation
[2:11:26] these men were hand picked by moses
[2:11:29] each and every one of them were
[2:11:31] hand-picked they were rulers in their
[2:11:33] tribe
[2:11:35] otherwise we're going to put it in
[2:11:36] layman's terms they were preachers
[2:11:39] and some of them were well-known
[2:11:40] preachers
[2:11:41] some of them were not so well known you
[2:11:43] never heard about caleb until this story
[2:11:46] he knew about joshua joshua had a good
[2:11:48] ministry he was right there with moses
[2:11:50] so you heard about joshua but you never
[2:11:51] heard nothing about caleb you may have
[2:11:53] heard about some of the other ones but
[2:11:55] they had not only did they some of them
[2:11:57] were well known some were not but they
[2:11:58] had an influence in their tribe
[2:12:01] and when they came back and gave the
[2:12:03] negative report what did it do it
[2:12:06] influenced the congregation
[2:12:08] i guess this is not for me i guess we
[2:12:10] can't have miracles i guess we can't
[2:12:12] have the emotion i guess we just got to
[2:12:13] stay with the word we got moses moses
[2:12:15] moses moses moses moses we got the ten
[2:12:17] commandments commandments commandments
[2:12:18] we got them we got them we got them we
[2:12:19] got them we done printed them we didn't
[2:12:20] did this we didn't google them we didn't
[2:12:22] copy them we got them every family's got
[2:12:23] the ten commandments
[2:12:25] but god was wanting to be personal
[2:12:28] god was wanting to take them into the
[2:12:29] promise of the word
[2:12:31] god was going to take them beyond the
[2:12:33] ten commandments and he was gonna
[2:12:35] manifest himself as a living god i've
[2:12:37] given you this land so that i can
[2:12:40] reproduce myself
[2:12:43] and they saw every reason not to
[2:12:46] go and again
[2:12:49] the people of their trials began to pull
[2:12:52] back
[2:12:53] and notice they settled to live on the
[2:12:55] outskirts of the promise and never to
[2:12:58] obtain never to occupy and never to
[2:13:01] enjoy the land
[2:13:03] what a sad place to be
[2:13:06] and you find many churches today are at
[2:13:09] this point
[2:13:11] they don't want any emotion in the
[2:13:13] church
[2:13:14] they don't want you shouting they don't
[2:13:15] want those acts 238 screaming youngins
[2:13:18] it'll certainly put her out of her
[2:13:19] denomination but the prophet god said
[2:13:22] it's the only kind the word can't
[2:13:24] produce
[2:13:25] it's the only kind the word is gonna
[2:13:28] bring forth is another book of acts
[2:13:30] church
[2:13:32] not an azusa book of acts but a holy
[2:13:35] ghost upper room indwelling the power of
[2:13:37] god when people can hear you in your own
[2:13:39] language when you walk out stumbling you
[2:13:41] may not be drunk because it's only the
[2:13:43] the third hour of the day but i'm gonna
[2:13:44] tell your brother says you've been in
[2:13:45] the presence of the angel of the lord
[2:13:50] so we're not a people to pull back from
[2:13:51] the promise but we need to move forward
[2:13:53] see what we find unbelief says look at
[2:13:55] the obstacles
[2:13:56] unbelief says look how long you've
[2:13:58] prayed no results yet
[2:14:01] unbelief says look at the challenges
[2:14:03] unbelief says we're not able
[2:14:05] but faith sees the opportunities faith
[2:14:08] says i can do all things through christ
[2:14:09] who strengthens me faith says it's time
[2:14:12] that we possess the lamb faith says make
[2:14:14] your move faith is here today say now is
[2:14:17] the time today is a day this is a
[2:14:19] service for some of you to make your
[2:14:21] move and quit wandering around quit
[2:14:23] beating that dead horse quit expecting
[2:14:25] to get different results when you're
[2:14:27] doing the same thing that's the very
[2:14:29] form of insanity look we're not insane
[2:14:31] people if there was any sane people in
[2:14:33] this world it's the people of god and
[2:14:35] god has commissioned us god is telling
[2:14:37] you i got a land for you to go to i got
[2:14:39] a promise for you to take and you need
[2:14:41] to rise up today this is your hour let
[2:14:43] the faith of the lord come into your
[2:14:45] heart this morning and you make your
[2:14:47] step to the promised land
[2:14:51] oh it's time we make our steps
[2:14:54] don't be afraid to go look the testing
[2:14:57] time come probably says and they were
[2:14:59] afraid to go
[2:15:03] he goes i think brethren today that's
[2:15:04] what's the matter with the churches at
[2:15:06] the end of the great doctors in theology
[2:15:08] and goes and i think it's a testing time
[2:15:10] for the church
[2:15:12] and you see people we our church and i
[2:15:14] just can speak for experience
[2:15:16] but there's a lot of liberty in our
[2:15:18] church thankfully we have it but it
[2:15:20] hasn't always been there it's
[2:15:22] it's graduated to this place where it's
[2:15:24] at today we've moved and we have grown
[2:15:26] and we have matured like every other
[2:15:28] church
[2:15:29] but we find people start to stream in
[2:15:32] and they begin to see
[2:15:34] oh that one jumped out of their seat and
[2:15:35] they ran around and they began to see
[2:15:38] the the the movement of the motion and
[2:15:40] the the emotion of the holy spirit
[2:15:43] moving in the church
[2:15:44] we have tongues in our church not every
[2:15:46] service but it happens we have
[2:15:48] interpretation of tongues in our church
[2:15:50] we have the gift of prophecy that will
[2:15:52] go forth in our church and many people
[2:15:55] view in and they criticize what's going
[2:15:58] on
[2:15:59] so what they're done they have looked
[2:16:01] over the border and they're complaining
[2:16:03] about what's in the promised land
[2:16:06] they're complaining about the liberty
[2:16:08] that they have in the promised land
[2:16:10] [Music]
[2:16:11] see the land
[2:16:13] the land god wants you to go but they
[2:16:15] were afraid to go and many messes
[2:16:17] believers are afraid to let go
[2:16:20] well what are they going to think
[2:16:22] i don't care what does he think
[2:16:26] what does he think
[2:16:28] you know i understand we're human right
[2:16:30] and everybody's a robot this morning
[2:16:33] and sometimes how many you've ever felt
[2:16:35] something just come over and you just
[2:16:36] want to do you want to run but you ain't
[2:16:38] going to run very far in here you'll be
[2:16:40] out in the middle of the street
[2:16:42] or you're bouncing on the wall but you
[2:16:43] just you wanted just something that
[2:16:45] comes over and you just like oh my well
[2:16:47] we seen brother paul you better be ready
[2:16:49] when he goes to shout out hallelujah
[2:16:51] it'll make a chill run up your body down
[2:16:53] your body out the door into the house
[2:16:55] you better know where you're standing
[2:16:58] or they're sitting for that matter
[2:16:59] because you if you're standing you may
[2:17:01] be sitting
[2:17:03] but it just something comes over you and
[2:17:04] you just want to yield to it but yet you
[2:17:06] just refrain it
[2:17:08] and that's what's the problem we have to
[2:17:09] learn to let go and allow the holy
[2:17:12] spirit to move
[2:17:14] now not every service is going to be a
[2:17:16] carbon copy of what we saw last night
[2:17:18] not every server is going to be a
[2:17:19] jumping emotional and everybody's in an
[2:17:22] euphoric condition no but god don't
[2:17:25] don't don't
[2:17:26] don't hinder god from moving the way
[2:17:28] that he wants to and we find they want
[2:17:30] to criticize our worship they want to
[2:17:32] criticize our young people because
[2:17:34] they're free they want to say they need
[2:17:35] church order
[2:17:37] we need church order and even like i got
[2:17:38] the meanest preacher in the message as a
[2:17:40] pastor and they're going to tell me we
[2:17:42] need church orders
[2:17:44] and he's amen and now yeah he knows
[2:17:47] i mean brother tim has no no spring
[2:17:49] chicken he's been around the block and
[2:17:50] he's a tough old bird
[2:17:53] i mean the man but he preaches the
[2:17:55] gospel flat and true and he's not gonna
[2:17:57] let any funny business happen in his
[2:17:59] church and yet you find people well
[2:18:01] brother tim you need to repent you've
[2:18:03] done this and you've done you've allowed
[2:18:04] this you know what you need to get out
[2:18:06] of order so you can get saved
[2:18:09] that's the problem
[2:18:10] they stopped marching on they stopped
[2:18:12] feeding on what the prophet of god said
[2:18:14] and they maybe capped down on a couple
[2:18:16] quotes i mean they took the nugget book
[2:18:18] and that's all they had and the nugget
[2:18:19] book was only because somebody was
[2:18:21] looking at a topic the way he wanted to
[2:18:22] look at it and they didn't search it all
[2:18:24] the way through the message
[2:18:26] oh don't stop at the nugget book don't
[2:18:27] start at these little little camps that
[2:18:29] we got today you need to take it all the
[2:18:31] way through the message what did he say
[2:18:33] from 47 all the way to 65
[2:18:36] and give the prophet an opportunity to
[2:18:39] progress in his revelation as well
[2:18:41] because the revelation he had in 65
[2:18:43] wasn't the same revelation that he had
[2:18:45] in 47 because he was visited by an angel
[2:18:48] of god and that angel began to express
[2:18:50] the word and begin to share and tell
[2:18:52] them you were wrong here and you were
[2:18:53] wrong there and this need to be here and
[2:18:55] this need to be and he he grew in his
[2:18:58] revelation just like we grow in our
[2:19:00] revelation
[2:19:01] but i will say this he was a prophet
[2:19:03] the entire way through
[2:19:07] so notice the unbelief of the preachers
[2:19:10] went into the land hindered
[2:19:12] the congregation from going and taking
[2:19:14] their promise
[2:19:16] now you will say oh it's impossible see
[2:19:18] they were looking at the circumstances
[2:19:19] caleb and joshua was looking at the word
[2:19:21] of god and that's what made the
[2:19:23] difference
[2:19:24] and that's why i've been preaching faith
[2:19:25] to you
[2:19:27] just look to the word
[2:19:29] look to the word don't look to your
[2:19:30] brother don't look to your sister look
[2:19:32] to the word of god he will be an
[2:19:34] absolute he will be a present help in a
[2:19:36] time of trouble see don't look at the
[2:19:37] circumstances don't look at the time
[2:19:40] don't put time refraints on god he says
[2:19:42] brother baby says that if you'll look at
[2:19:43] the circumstances around you you'll
[2:19:45] faint
[2:19:46] we know the story peter got off the boat
[2:19:48] he said lord if that be you bid me to
[2:19:51] come peter stepped out on faith but soon
[2:19:53] as he started looking around at all the
[2:19:54] ways everything around him he
[2:19:56] immediately sunk
[2:19:58] but the word of god says jesus was so
[2:20:00] close he immediately reached out and
[2:20:02] picked him right up
[2:20:03] that's how close he is to you so don't
[2:20:06] let your unbelief shadow the presence of
[2:20:08] god you're right there we're at the
[2:20:10] verge of going into the promised land
[2:20:12] church notice the problem god will tell
[2:20:14] us is he said talking about a borderline
[2:20:16] believer he said
[2:20:17] then he will be brought right up to the
[2:20:19] borderline set right in the meetings
[2:20:22] watch the working of the holy spirit see
[2:20:24] others get healed hear them speak with
[2:20:26] tongues see sign signs and wonders done
[2:20:29] they'll sit right around and watch it
[2:20:31] but afraid to put their hand on it
[2:20:35] that's the borderline believer that
[2:20:37] fella if he ever turns away there's no
[2:20:40] more remission for him stand right up
[2:20:43] there and even look at the lamb who's
[2:20:45] received the knowledge of the truth and
[2:20:47] had a knowledge of the truth know that
[2:20:49] it was right but because of prestige
[2:20:51] well if i do this it'll do this if i
[2:20:54] accept that it'll do this see they
[2:20:56] refuse it and they walk from it
[2:21:00] he said that's a borderline believer i'm
[2:21:02] not preaching to borderline believers
[2:21:04] i'm preaching the genuine sons and
[2:21:06] daughters of god this morning
[2:21:08] he said a real born-again believer how
[2:21:10] that real born-again church is moving on
[2:21:13] into the promised land the promise of
[2:21:15] the eternal life a land flowing with
[2:21:17] eternal life there he goes where there
[2:21:20] is no more sickness no more death sorrow
[2:21:23] nothing has to harm them he said but
[2:21:24] when carnal minds began to come among
[2:21:27] them
[2:21:28] notice intellectual minds
[2:21:31] carnal minds
[2:21:33] began to come among them it finally
[2:21:35] drove them off the main path into the
[2:21:37] desert amen and they wandered
[2:21:41] and they wondered we can't have miracles
[2:21:42] anymore
[2:21:44] that's just carnal
[2:21:46] we don't want that we got the word
[2:21:48] we don't believe in speaking in tongues
[2:21:49] anymore we got the word because when
[2:21:51] that which is in part is done away and
[2:21:53] that which is in whole no i want the
[2:21:55] part i want the hole i want all of it
[2:21:57] i'm not throwing out the part because
[2:21:59] now i got the hole because the part is
[2:22:01] included in the hole give me it all to
[2:22:02] me speaking in tongues is in the part
[2:22:04] well it's part of the hole as well the
[2:22:06] emotion is in part it's part of the
[2:22:08] whole as well give it all to me i'm not
[2:22:09] throwing out the part because now we got
[2:22:11] the whole i want it all
[2:22:15] but we found carnal minds they began to
[2:22:17] come among us and it drove them to the
[2:22:18] desert and they made their final mistake
[2:22:21] when they failed to go on
[2:22:24] they were on their journey and the
[2:22:26] prophet of god would say not very many
[2:22:28] miles they could have made it in a few
[2:22:30] days with all the 2 million people out
[2:22:32] there in the desert if they could have
[2:22:33] just stayed on the path
[2:22:35] in one place the prophet of god told us
[2:22:36] they were three days away from the
[2:22:39] promised land
[2:22:41] look how close
[2:22:43] if they were three days away
[2:22:45] how close are we today
[2:22:47] the world has never been in the
[2:22:49] condition that it's in right now
[2:22:52] we see it all we hear
[2:22:54] you hear rumors of nuclear war nuclear
[2:22:57] war nuclear war russia getting ready
[2:22:59] russia getting ready threatening and
[2:23:00] threatening and threatening and
[2:23:01] threatening you hear different feeling
[2:23:03] of different ones wanting to join nato
[2:23:04] for protection and russia's putting an
[2:23:07] ultimatum on them because you know you
[2:23:08] don't you do this we're going to go to
[2:23:09] war with you trying to flex your muscle
[2:23:12] and the problem of god warned us watch
[2:23:14] russia but more importantly don't put
[2:23:16] your eyes on that put your eyes on the
[2:23:17] promise
[2:23:18] because if that's taking place out there
[2:23:20] what's taking place in the body
[2:23:22] how close are we from entering into the
[2:23:25] land
[2:23:28] he says when they got there they camped
[2:23:31] and god had been good to them showed
[2:23:32] them many great wonders and signs down
[2:23:34] in egypt on their journey and have
[2:23:36] prepared everything for them but they
[2:23:38] still had to come to the place which was
[2:23:40] almost in sight of the promised land and
[2:23:42] just a little while after that they had
[2:23:44] left
[2:23:45] he said but they get camped
[2:23:48] church don't camp down
[2:23:50] you know we've we've seen men around
[2:23:52] this message camp down on thunders and
[2:23:54] they never progress with the opening of
[2:23:56] the word that's all that they know is
[2:23:59] their thunders
[2:24:00] you got perugia you got two souls you
[2:24:02] got no souls you got all kind of things
[2:24:05] you got all kind of doctrines what is
[2:24:07] that that is camps
[2:24:09] god never intended for us to camp down
[2:24:12] he never intended for us to put a period
[2:24:15] at the end of our experience
[2:24:17] no you never saw a prophet camp down on
[2:24:19] these ideas
[2:24:21] so who were we to come behind a prophet
[2:24:24] and start setting up camps
[2:24:26] no the prophet was leading us into the
[2:24:28] promised land amen and it's time we go
[2:24:32] it's time we pack up and it's time we go
[2:24:34] let me start trying to wrap this up
[2:24:37] because i got
[2:24:39] about another 50 pages here
[2:24:41] y'all don't have enough time and i don't
[2:24:42] preach this is my third service i'm
[2:24:44] wearing down
[2:24:47] but the prophet of god said you'd have
[2:24:48] to you'd have to fight for every inch of
[2:24:51] ground
[2:24:53] you got to fight
[2:24:55] mom dad
[2:24:57] daughter brother sister
[2:24:59] you got to fight for your own ground
[2:25:02] amen
[2:25:03] he said foot footprints means possession
[2:25:07] let's move in tonight amen let's go in
[2:25:10] footprints is possession
[2:25:11] let's take every inch of ground that god
[2:25:14] give us if you haven't got the baptism
[2:25:17] of the holy ghost peter said the promise
[2:25:19] is unto you unto your children to them
[2:25:21] that are far off even as many as the
[2:25:23] lord our god shall call footprints is
[2:25:26] possession let's go get it it's ours
[2:25:29] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[2:25:32] and forever let's possess that the works
[2:25:34] that i do shall you do also well that's
[2:25:38] another topic that we can look at for
[2:25:40] just a brief minute everybody wants to
[2:25:42] put it on a prophet you can't have
[2:25:44] prophecy anymore because that was only
[2:25:45] for a prophet
[2:25:46] you can't pray for the sick because that
[2:25:48] was only for a prophet
[2:25:49] no god established a five-fold ministry
[2:25:52] and then there there's prophets there's
[2:25:54] teachers there's evangelists there's
[2:25:56] missionaries there's preachers so the
[2:25:58] gift of prophecy never ceased because a
[2:26:00] prophet went off the scene there will
[2:26:02] never be another major prophet that's
[2:26:04] right
[2:26:05] but there are gifts of prophecy
[2:26:08] your young men shall do what
[2:26:10] they will have prophecies and your old
[2:26:12] men will do what they will dream dreams
[2:26:15] so we see it's still among the body amen
[2:26:18] if the body's marching onto the promised
[2:26:20] land
[2:26:20] amen snow does now joshua had to fight
[2:26:23] for every inch of ground
[2:26:25] from one end of the country to the other
[2:26:27] but he had a promise
[2:26:29] you got the same promise
[2:26:32] they were giants in the land joshua
[2:26:34] didn't know how he was going to take the
[2:26:36] land
[2:26:37] caleb didn't know how he was going to
[2:26:38] take the mountain
[2:26:40] brother said i don't know how a black
[2:26:42] cow can eat green grass and produce
[2:26:44] white milk but i drink it anyway
[2:26:48] he goes i don't try to find out the
[2:26:49] formula to divine healing i just know
[2:26:51] god said it and it brings the results
[2:26:54] because it's fruit of the promised land
[2:26:56] it's your possession
[2:26:58] move into it tonight or today rather
[2:27:02] notice
[2:27:04] they made their mistake when they camped
[2:27:05] down and what did they do they begin to
[2:27:07] murmur
[2:27:08] they begin to complain brother mark
[2:27:11] they begin to pick out
[2:27:13] faults and flaws
[2:27:15] well
[2:27:16] you know brother brother i ain't gonna
[2:27:18] save brother lush but you know this
[2:27:19] brother and that brother man he preaches
[2:27:21] for four hours
[2:27:23] and i think he said the same thing every
[2:27:25] 30 minutes he just puts himself on
[2:27:26] replay and he just keeps repeating and
[2:27:28] repeating and repeating and repeating
[2:27:29] and repeating and repeating four hours
[2:27:31] what can he say in four hours
[2:27:33] i mean four hours man you could have got
[2:27:34] that done a long time ago and they find
[2:27:36] every reason to pick apart the ministry
[2:27:40] they don't do it in the congress they do
[2:27:42] it around the supper table they begin to
[2:27:44] complain they begin to murmur they begin
[2:27:46] to find fault with this one and find
[2:27:47] fault with that one they're probably
[2:27:49] saying right now i wish brother joe
[2:27:50] would hurry up because we're getting
[2:27:51] hungry
[2:27:53] i wish he'd come on we didn't heard
[2:27:54] about this problem he wants to talk
[2:27:56] about repeat he didn't put himself on
[2:27:57] replay several times already
[2:28:00] but we find how do they do it they
[2:28:01] murmur and it influenced their family
[2:28:04] and then that family influenced another
[2:28:06] family and that family influenced
[2:28:07] another family and then another family
[2:28:09] and then to find the entire tribe was
[2:28:11] influenced with negativity and said we
[2:28:13] can't go
[2:28:15] and then you wonder why your kids don't
[2:28:17] want to serve the lord
[2:28:18] because the murmur is being done around
[2:28:20] the dinner table
[2:28:22] when they get of age and they have no
[2:28:24] desire to serve god because you have
[2:28:26] killed that man's influence
[2:28:28] the prophet of god said there's more
[2:28:29] ways to kill a man there's more ways to
[2:28:31] besides just stick a knife in his back
[2:28:33] you start talking about him and you kill
[2:28:35] his influence
[2:28:37] you kill his ability to have an impact
[2:28:39] on your children's life when they come
[2:28:41] to the age of accountability and they
[2:28:43] need to have confidence in a man and
[2:28:45] they no longer have condoms because why
[2:28:46] because you destroyed the man in front
[2:28:48] of them
[2:28:49] you destroyed the church you destroyed
[2:28:51] the message and wonder why they want to
[2:28:53] wash their hands of it they begin to
[2:28:55] murmur
[2:28:56] why do we need to go into that land
[2:28:58] it's just like every other land right
[2:29:01] and they wander
[2:29:02] and they wander and they wander and they
[2:29:05] wander and the prophet of god say
[2:29:06] carnality had cut off their spiritual
[2:29:08] supply and they wander and to wander he
[2:29:11] says we've been around this mountain 40
[2:29:12] years we've been here long enough church
[2:29:15] he says we've been here long enough he
[2:29:17] says we stayed on this mountain 40 years
[2:29:19] we stayed in our denomination 40 years
[2:29:21] fussing the way that we have do you
[2:29:23] think what he says do you even think or
[2:29:26] do you ever think what them people done
[2:29:28] out there for 40 years
[2:29:30] i couldn't imagine being around those
[2:29:32] people and all that negativity for 40
[2:29:34] years
[2:29:35] oh my
[2:29:36] goodness
[2:29:38] i mean there was only caleb and joshua
[2:29:40] had a positive testimony
[2:29:42] and maybe their families and their
[2:29:43] tribes but we find here he goes well he
[2:29:46] said sure god was with him he's been
[2:29:48] with us they've been out there for 40
[2:29:49] years they raised children they had
[2:29:51] prospered them they had good crops
[2:29:52] they'd done a lot of good out there god
[2:29:54] had blessed them and healed them healed
[2:29:56] them of their sickness they weren't the
[2:29:57] feeble one among them and they when they
[2:29:59] come out of the wilderness but he let
[2:30:01] them stay right there to the old bunch
[2:30:04] of fighters
[2:30:05] left and died out that's right
[2:30:09] why are we still here
[2:30:12] some of these old fighters if you've
[2:30:14] heard are starting to die off
[2:30:16] some of those have camped down and
[2:30:17] refused to go on with the word starting
[2:30:19] to die off and the prophet of god would
[2:30:21] tell us he says oh you bunch of old
[2:30:23] fighters a bunch of fighters god just
[2:30:25] let you sit right there till you die
[2:30:26] that's exactly the bible said they
[2:30:28] stayed there to the old fighters died
[2:30:30] out that's exactly right he let them
[2:30:32] stay right there till the old fighters
[2:30:34] died out those fighters they were
[2:30:36] fighting and fussing over organizational
[2:30:37] boundaries and you don't have fellowship
[2:30:39] with this group and that group oh my
[2:30:41] goodness where are we at today
[2:30:43] you can't go to this church you can't be
[2:30:44] a partaker of that meeting there because
[2:30:46] that meeting they don't believe like we
[2:30:48] believe and they're perusal we're
[2:30:49] thunder so we can't intermingle we can't
[2:30:51] mix we're all messes believers church
[2:30:53] and we find here these old fighters have
[2:30:55] these
[2:30:56] organizational boundaries and they won't
[2:30:58] let you do this they won't let their
[2:30:59] congregate congregation go there but at
[2:31:01] the end of the 40 years the old fighters
[2:31:03] begin to die off and the problem of god
[2:31:05] sent a new generation
[2:31:07] a new generation from those old fighters
[2:31:09] will begin to rise up and they don't
[2:31:11] want to fight anymore
[2:31:13] no they got one motion they got one
[2:31:15] purpose they got one desire and that's
[2:31:17] to go into the land we have heard about
[2:31:19] it for 40 years we have seen the pastors
[2:31:22] going around that mountain fighting
[2:31:23] about this state and fighting about this
[2:31:26] doctrine and fighting about this idea we
[2:31:28] don't want to fight anymore we want to
[2:31:30] possess the promised land we're going to
[2:31:32] take our kids and take our families and
[2:31:35] take our churches into the blessings of
[2:31:37] the holy spirit and move into a rapture
[2:31:39] of the church
[2:31:41] [Music]
[2:31:44] a new group
[2:31:46] the prophet of god would tell us
[2:31:48] he said in the beginning he goes ah i'm
[2:31:50] beginning to get old excuse me and i
[2:31:52] know that my days are numbered but we
[2:31:54] know that these young men
[2:31:56] notice
[2:31:57] he goes i know now that these young men
[2:31:59] can take this message and sweep it on to
[2:32:01] the coming of the lord
[2:32:03] these young men
[2:32:05] hope they've seen the fighting in that
[2:32:07] camp and the fighting in that camp and
[2:32:08] this one camped down on that doctrine
[2:32:10] this one camped down on that when ain't
[2:32:11] about camping down on a doctrine i'm
[2:32:13] ready to move into the promised land and
[2:32:16] i ask you where do we go
[2:32:18] it's time that we make our move church
[2:32:20] it's time that we move don't settle for
[2:32:22] just some halfway religion don't just
[2:32:24] settle for halfway healing move into the
[2:32:27] promised land
[2:32:29] move it to the joys of the lord
[2:32:32] we don't want to fight anymore
[2:32:34] we're not picking this preacher apart
[2:32:35] and picking that pastor apart and
[2:32:37] preaching this one apart no we got a
[2:32:39] word
[2:32:40] preach the word quit preaching about
[2:32:43] man's ideas and preach the word of god
[2:32:45] that's what keeps the people coming
[2:32:50] these young
[2:32:51] they weren't concerned about fighting no
[2:32:53] sir
[2:32:54] they want one thing
[2:32:56] i want my land
[2:32:58] i want the mountain
[2:33:00] the prophet god says time let's he said
[2:33:02] let's get off this mountain and move up
[2:33:04] to the promised land let's start going
[2:33:06] up
[2:33:07] possess the land god told them go up and
[2:33:10] possess it and the old fighters is gone
[2:33:12] now
[2:33:13] put your sword back in your sheaves
[2:33:16] and don't fight
[2:33:18] oh my
[2:33:19] listen man he says don't make the same
[2:33:22] mistake your fathers did or you'd be
[2:33:24] here another 40 years
[2:33:28] don't make the same mistake
[2:33:30] but the promise is unto you
[2:33:33] and it's unto your children
[2:33:35] and it's unto them that are far off
[2:33:37] and i've given you evidence
[2:33:39] of a good land
[2:33:41] i've given you evidence
[2:33:43] we're at the border
[2:33:45] we're less than three days journey we
[2:33:48] can see it from here
[2:33:50] while there's something stirring within
[2:33:51] a bride
[2:33:52] there's something stirring within a
[2:33:54] bride she wants the supernatural
[2:33:56] the prophet of god would say the move is
[2:33:59] on for the bride the move not camping
[2:34:03] down but the move is on for the bride
[2:34:08] that's thus saith the lord
[2:34:12] now as i bring this to a close i want
[2:34:14] the musicians to come back if they would
[2:34:18] caleb stealed the people before moses
[2:34:22] and he said let us go at once
[2:34:27] if there was ever time to run now's the
[2:34:28] time to run run with everything you got
[2:34:32] run with all the passion you have in you
[2:34:34] from with all the zeal you have in you
[2:34:36] run with every bit of energy that's left
[2:34:38] in you you run and you take this message
[2:34:40] and you run
[2:34:41] look and if you go by the way the grave
[2:34:43] the devil didn't get the victory
[2:34:45] because you're going to come up first
[2:34:47] you're going to be the one that comes
[2:34:48] and visits the family member says all
[2:34:49] right it's time
[2:34:51] i haven't been over there in the land
[2:34:52] i'm coming back to tell you it's all
[2:34:53] that he said it was
[2:34:55] oh but look church
[2:34:57] caleb and joshua caleb steal the people
[2:34:59] before moses and he said let us go at
[2:35:01] once and possess it we
[2:35:04] are
[2:35:04] well
[2:35:05] able
[2:35:06] more than able to possess the land
[2:35:12] oh the odds may be against you
[2:35:15] there may be a lot out there right now
[2:35:17] obviously against this church you're
[2:35:19] very tiny right
[2:35:21] maybe one of the only churches on the
[2:35:22] island
[2:35:23] i don't know how many people you have
[2:35:24] here but let's just say the odds are
[2:35:26] against you today
[2:35:28] and you're wondering how is this going
[2:35:29] to happen how is this going to be
[2:35:30] possible
[2:35:32] notice
[2:35:36] for every spy that had a negative report
[2:35:39] it was five to one
[2:35:41] five negative to one caleb five negative
[2:35:44] to one joshua
[2:35:46] the odds are against you
[2:35:48] but last year there was a two-year-old
[2:35:50] colt that finished dead last in his
[2:35:52] first race just play something sister
[2:35:55] maureen
[2:35:58] disappointed his owners
[2:36:00] placed him in a claiming race where
[2:36:02] anyone that wanted to take ownership of
[2:36:04] this horse could do it for a fee
[2:36:06] and he was sold for thirty thousand
[2:36:08] dollars
[2:36:09] and that's not a lot of money in the
[2:36:11] horse racing industry some of those
[2:36:13] horses are million dollar horses
[2:36:15] and their seed sells for hundreds of
[2:36:17] thousands of dollars hoping to get
[2:36:19] another prodigy horse out of that seed
[2:36:22] but this man
[2:36:24] this horse was placed in a claiming race
[2:36:25] where anyone
[2:36:27] that wanted to take ownership of this
[2:36:29] horse could do it for a fee and an older
[2:36:31] man
[2:36:32] he claims his horse after missing his
[2:36:34] chance to claim another horse that he
[2:36:35] wanted
[2:36:36] and he says this is my last attempt to
[2:36:39] have any success in the horse racing
[2:36:41] industry
[2:36:42] and in that race that coat wins by 17
[2:36:46] lengths
[2:36:47] i mean he's like oh i got me a good one
[2:36:49] now
[2:36:51] you know and the new owner was
[2:36:52] encouraged but the race
[2:36:54] the several races that followed he
[2:36:56] finished third twice
[2:36:59] fourth once in fifth once
[2:37:01] but his owner still believed
[2:37:04] his owner still believed
[2:37:07] you may have come in only once once
[2:37:09] but he still believes
[2:37:12] he may have come in fourth once but he
[2:37:14] still believes
[2:37:15] he may have come in third you got close
[2:37:17] maybe you you know you really getting
[2:37:19] there three times
[2:37:20] but he still believes
[2:37:22] but in 2022 the colts only chance to
[2:37:26] race in a major thoroughbred race which
[2:37:28] was limited to three-year-old horses
[2:37:31] notice now the day before the kentucky
[2:37:33] derby the field of horses was already
[2:37:36] full he had no chance
[2:37:38] he was already full
[2:37:41] aren't you glad god doesn't do you like
[2:37:42] that
[2:37:44] just waiting for somebody to fail so you
[2:37:46] can move into the pack
[2:37:48] no god's already hand-picked you
[2:37:51] guys already got your place set at the
[2:37:53] table
[2:37:55] oh church
[2:37:57] if you can start looking through the
[2:37:58] eyes of fates right now him realize who
[2:38:01] is going to be my neighbor at the dinner
[2:38:03] supper
[2:38:04] man i like eating supper and i can't
[2:38:06] wait to eat this evening but wait till
[2:38:07] we get to the wedding supper and i got a
[2:38:10] special place nobody can sit at my place
[2:38:14] brother paul nobody can take my place at
[2:38:17] that table i'm just wondering will i get
[2:38:19] to sit next to paul
[2:38:20] i hope god puts me next to shamgar
[2:38:24] because i think me and sham guard will
[2:38:25] just hit it right off just put me right
[2:38:27] in front of them shaman guard tell me
[2:38:29] about your story
[2:38:30] because i sure display it really fine
[2:38:32] there when i go out and preach the sham
[2:38:34] guard story i love one of my favorites
[2:38:36] but yet at that table nobody can take
[2:38:39] your place
[2:38:40] but here it was all the field of horses
[2:38:43] is already done but at the last moment a
[2:38:46] famous rider a famous trainer scratches
[2:38:49] or he withdraws his horse from the
[2:38:51] kentucky derby and the cult takes his
[2:38:54] place in the field of 20 horses just 30
[2:38:58] seconds before the deadline
[2:39:01] look how close
[2:39:04] 30 seconds before the deadline
[2:39:07] now
[2:39:08] he's in the game
[2:39:11] it's not by mistake that you're here
[2:39:13] this morning
[2:39:14] now you're in the game
[2:39:16] now you got a chance
[2:39:20] oh
[2:39:21] the owner has faith in you he has
[2:39:24] confidence in you he's got confidence in
[2:39:26] the seed brother mark that he put inside
[2:39:28] of you
[2:39:30] notice all the metrics and all the
[2:39:32] predictors are against him neither his
[2:39:34] owner nor his trainer nor his jockey has
[2:39:37] ever been associated with any horse in
[2:39:39] the kentucky derby his jockey has never
[2:39:42] won a major event that jockey shouldn't
[2:39:44] have been on that horse and that horse
[2:39:46] shouldn't have been in that race
[2:39:48] you know what and that's exactly what
[2:39:49] the devil tells you you shouldn't be
[2:39:51] here you don't belong here you're not
[2:39:53] worthy to be here you just squeaked on
[2:39:56] by he only had 30 seconds
[2:39:59] but it ain't by mistake
[2:40:01] that he was put there
[2:40:03] he was gonna make history
[2:40:09] i'm talking about a bride that's about
[2:40:11] to make history
[2:40:13] i'm telling i'm talking about a bride
[2:40:14] who's about to make history saints
[2:40:17] through every age as long for this
[2:40:18] moment they have longed for this race
[2:40:21] [Music]
[2:40:22] they have longed to be where you are
[2:40:24] right now
[2:40:25] you know i just made it in i just got in
[2:40:27] about 30 seconds hold but you're in
[2:40:29] you're in the game this morning you got
[2:40:31] a chance this morning what do you gotta
[2:40:33] do you gotta prove that you're not gonna
[2:40:35] stay in the shop you're gonna move out
[2:40:37] and you're gonna run the race with
[2:40:39] everything that's within you
[2:40:41] see this jockey had never won a major
[2:40:44] event
[2:40:46] they were outsiders they were newbies in
[2:40:48] an elite arena in the morning of the
[2:40:50] race the odds of winning
[2:40:52] are set at 80 to 1.
[2:40:56] 80 to 1 the second longest shot in the
[2:41:00] kentucky derby history 80 to one
[2:41:03] halfway around the track
[2:41:05] y'all want to hear the rest of the story
[2:41:08] oh y'all want me to just leave
[2:41:10] halfway around the track
[2:41:13] he's 16 horses back from the lead
[2:41:18] there they go again
[2:41:21] they can't even run
[2:41:23] look at them
[2:41:25] we put them in this major event we're
[2:41:27] running the greatest race of all time
[2:41:28] and they just loafing
[2:41:31] and that's how we feel sometimes ain't
[2:41:32] it
[2:41:34] you got all these thoroughbreds out
[2:41:35] there running
[2:41:38] snorting and hollering everybody's just
[2:41:39] ripping and going and they're just
[2:41:40] sitting back
[2:41:43] 16 horses from the back
[2:41:46] he can't even be seen in the field of
[2:41:49] view by the drone that's flying overhead
[2:41:52] he's a nobody he's a throwaway he's an
[2:41:55] inconsequential participant in the race
[2:41:58] he was only there to fill a quorum so
[2:42:01] that they could do the kentucky derby
[2:42:05] but
[2:42:07] he began to make his move
[2:42:10] he began to make his move
[2:42:13] and the prophet of god say when god
[2:42:15] moves
[2:42:16] he moves
[2:42:18] oh church don't don't don't don't give
[2:42:20] up on yourself
[2:42:22] oh believe in yourself he begin to make
[2:42:24] his move he begins working his way
[2:42:26] through the crowded pack he began to
[2:42:28] work his way through cancer he began to
[2:42:30] work his way around fear he began to
[2:42:32] work his way around the oppression he
[2:42:34] began to work his way around anxiety he
[2:42:36] began to work her way around the
[2:42:37] difficulties of the family he began to
[2:42:39] find the little narrow pass little
[2:42:40] fleeting opportunity to improve his
[2:42:43] position and as they head toward the
[2:42:45] finish line he's moved up the fifth then
[2:42:47] he's moved up to four still he's
[2:42:49] unnoticed nobody sees them nobody hears
[2:42:52] them and he's still unnoticed and here
[2:42:54] he is almost in a single breath he goes
[2:42:56] now the announcer has struggled to
[2:42:58] identify him and to say his name
[2:43:00] let me back up he said only seconds
[2:43:03] before the finish he suddenly and
[2:43:05] magically passes the two front runners
[2:43:09] suddenly

[2:46:27] they just keep their eyes focused
[2:46:29] may they continue to run god may they
[2:46:31] lay aside every weight and every sin
[2:46:33] that was so easy but settlement and pull
[2:46:35] them back lord may they not feed on the
[2:46:37] things that would
[2:46:38] decrease their faith but may they begin
[2:46:40] to just look on the things of god
[2:46:42] lord feast on that word feast on the
[2:46:44] promises lord may they edify themselves
