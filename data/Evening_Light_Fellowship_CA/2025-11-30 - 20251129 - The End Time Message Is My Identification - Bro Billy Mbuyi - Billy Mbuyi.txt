And as your children, Lord, and Father, we want you to fill our cup until it overruns, oh God. And Father, we tasted of your goodness. And we don't want to go anywhere, Lord. And Father, anyone who's ever come into your presence has never went back the same. Amen. We desire, Father, more of you in this world and less of us. And Father, that your word may feel, as your prophet will say, every fiber of our being, Lord. And until people will look at us and all they will see is Jesus Christ, Father, there's actually a hunger within the soul of the believer. And that desire for the fullness of what you promise to be manifested in this end time. [music] Lord God, we know that portion is not given, Father, for us to man to do it within our own flesh and but Lord, you've provided a way that can make us what we desire to be. And we've come to way by the way provided, oh God, and and pray for each one gathering this building and those that are listening, oh God. Father, may you just come by our way and pick us up. And Father, take let your word feed our souls, oh God. and let the word answer to the needs of the body, Lord. And let the word of God penetrate us, oh God, and create the change that is needed in order for us to be that image of Jesus Christ. We love you tonight. We're so thankful for this opportunity. Father, we pray that every word that will be said, let it be the word and the word only. Father, close our mouth to say anything that we don't want to say and that you wouldn't want us to say. Father that we may only stay with what you promise and what you say you will do. Lord, we commit the service to you and we thank you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. How many happy to be in the house of God tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. We certainly uh enjoy being here so much. enjoyed the fellowship and I just want to say thank you uh once again and had such a great breakfast and the fellowship with the brethren and uh you know I just like the closeness. Uh I was telling one of the brothers I feel like this is like a family. It's not it doesn't have a church feel. It has a a family feel where you can have conversation with one another and get to learn and get to feed and get to exchange one another. And I certainly appreciate and I want to say this, don't lose that. &gt;&gt; I I know the enemy is going to try to, you know, he's always going to come, but you bound together and you let the love of God be shed abroad are your heart. And the scripture says it's by your love one for another that people will know my discip that you are my disciples. And I just want to encourage you to do that. Once again, I want to thank brother Jonathan and sister Blanca for the invitation. and uh you know it's but they've been so much to me and just I feel like the very fellowship we just picked up where we left off and it was so wonderful and and I certainly I'm humbled by the invitation and just to be among you uh it just makes me feel different you know they'll feel just the love of God in my heart what God is doing in this area we bring you once again greetings from our pastor from the church back home Christian Life Tabernacle our pastor brother David McGary and he certainly wanted me to greet you and let you know uh that we love you and we're praying for you. Let's open our Bibles tonight and get in the scriptures and we see what God has for us tonight. Amen. You know, the word of God is the the very fountain of life and and I believe it's endless. Every time we open, he always has something for us. Let's open in Philippians chapter 2. We read verse 5. We'll start at verse five. Philippians chapter 2 in the fifth verse, a very familiar scripture reading. He said, "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ, whom being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant. and he was made in the likeness of men. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedience unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also has highly exalted him, and give him a name which is above all every name, that at the name of Jesus, that every knee should bow of things in heaven, on things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father. Gracious Father, we ask you bless your word once again to us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. have your seats tonight. Man, I just want to say uh um before I announce my title, the this scripture uh means so much to me and and the Lord and I want to give a title um the end time message is my identification and and we'll see just where we go with that. the the it's important as we read the message that uh God wants us as his children to approach him with confidence. Uh he wants us to know who we are, where we came from, how we came to be about here and and he's given us this message to uh so that in this dark generation that we live in, God don't want us to be confused. We live in such a confused time and you know the devil is the author of confusion. He tries by every mean to confuse us even within our own minds because the scripture says the battle is in our minds and and often time we lose the battle because confusion comes in and then we don't know we forget who we are. We forget what we are about and confusion steps in and now we find ourselves doing things we're not supposed to do. Now the what will say that Jesus knew who he was and and because he knew who he was, he had confidence in what his mission was. And and so I want you now to realize that to the knowledge of who you are gives the confidence on what you're supposed to do, how you're supposed to do it, and what you what the power that's been given to you is. So we want uh uh to have confidence and and and and and know what the word calls us to be. Obviously we don't want it to be by arrogance but but it's by humility at the same time. God just wants us to be humble people. But he doesn't want us to be just a pushover one that could be just run over everything goes by. God wants us to stand on the promises that we know belong to us and claim that which belong to us. and and so the confidence flows from identification and and what you notice is when you know your identification and your motive and your objective that you are doing therefore it gives you confidence in order for you to do it. So I'll give you an example. If at work you don't know what your job description is or what you're supposed to do, you'll be a very confused person. You will come in and you can I do this? No. Can I touch this? No. You'll be very confused. But once your objective and your mission and your position and your identity has been confirmed to you, you walk in with confidence to do the job that you want that you would you were you were called to do. God want us to be the same way. God has not called us to to wonder what we are. He told us what we are. So the right identity will anchor you through your life and through difficulties, through trials and everything to know who you are. That God has not changed his mind about you, which is what the devil tells you every day. But one says that God has never changed his mind about his word. And and I just want to say this, you are the word of God manifested for the age that we are living in. &gt;&gt; We we are not here. The challenge we run into most of the time is we look at the scripture and and we look at uh low is us and and I'm trying to be what the word says. No, let me put it in a different way. You are what the word says. &gt;&gt; You are what the Bible says. you. It's not us trying to become something that we were never before. No, we are going back to what we were originally. &gt;&gt; And that's very important because then you realize when I'm reading this message, when I'm reading the book, I'm not reading about Moses. I'm not reading about somebody else. I'm reading about myself. The prophet told us this Bible is the mirror to the believer. What he says you are is what you are. You are not wanting to be a Christian. You were made to be a Christian in the beginning. You were made to serve God in the beginning. You were made to be a son and the daughter of God. Now, we were born in sin. That's because that's the way God intended or allowed for us to come. Not necessarily intended from the beginning, but he allowed that to happen. But ne that never changed your identity. That kept you for who you were. But he knew that through the process of time that he will send his word and bring you into the knowledge of what you were supposed to be and that you'll be like that boy that looked at the mirror and he began to look and if I could just put it in the context of the Bible perhaps it looked and it talked about a well man. It looked about somebody who was well and who lived a good life and you looked AT YOURSELF AND SAID I want to be good. I want to live a good life. And the more he came closer to it, the more he realized he was actually looking at himself. And &gt;&gt; and that's the revelation of this hour. Why am I saying this? Because it's so important. The enemy will keep you on a goose chase trying to make you something that you are not. Let me say this. If you were not made to be a believer, if you are not a believer to begin with, you won't become a believer. It's not it's not a cocker bird becoming a grain of wheat is that you were a wheat to begin with. That's why you can receive the word of God. So he he would come and and it's to mirror and and when when we we told it says that we have to have such a confidence and again I want to divide confidence from arrogance because arrogance is when you claim something you are not. But we need to have confidence because the prophet said that if if if the word says that there's one going you say that's me. This is not a a waving age. Want to be careful here. It's not a an age where you wondering. No, it's the age of holding forth and and standing straight and and knowing without a shadow of a doubt and with confirmation from God by the Holy Spirit. If there's one going, IT'S NOT THE PASTOR, IT'S ME. If there's one elect, it's not somebody else, it's me. You You see what I'M SAYING? WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A relationship with them that nothing can waver you. GOD GOD DIDN'T he he's not coming to set you up and say well before he of course he uses the ministry to speak to you but God is looking for each and everyone to have a direct relationship with him so that when the ministry is talking you would know that this word is for me it's not for somebody else so he's wanting us to have that kind of closeness so we come to the word of God when we read the message of the hour we can identify with it and say that's what I've always wanted to be. Lord. &gt;&gt; So he it would say but what I'm in the message identification it will say we live in the age of identification and and we live in the time where it's it's almost impossible it would say to do anything without identification and and think about and he says identification is more important today than it's ever been in every other age because because we live in such a time where Satan is identifying his believer, God is also identifying his. And I heard a brother made a comment I I don't know who it was. He said that we live IN SUCH DARK AGE where we can say that hell is on earth. We can see it. But brother, DON'T FORGET HEAVEN IS ALSO ON EARTH AND we can see it. &gt;&gt; IT GOD IS NOT GONNA BE DEFEATED. God is not gonna let go. God has an his elect and by all means possible God will show up for his elect and he's provided a way for them to escape what's coming. &gt;&gt; So we we you you can you couldn't drive a car without a proper identification. You couldn't fly without one. You couldn't go to the bank and get funds without it. You couldn't communicate without one. And and everything we do is all about identification. And and when you say identification, we have all kinds of security protocols that are built in order for them to make sure that you are who you say you are. And and let me say this when you talk about identification the the concept of identification is that before something can be identified there has to be prior characteristics by which we will know that it is what it says it is. &gt;&gt; And I'm hope I'm not getting too scientific up here. So if if this if if we call this a bottle of water, there has to be a place where initially this was defined to be a bottle and the con that whatever is contained in the bottle, we said it was going to be water. Therefore, every time somebody takes it, you open it and you taste it. That's water. Why? Because you've tasted water before and you know what water tastes like. And and so spiritually speaking we have we have this identification. We live in a time where we people will talk and say we live in the time where people aspire to be like celebrities are our young people and and you know I was preaching back home and we were talking and and and I made a comment to to our young people. I say that what what everything that you do, the way you dress, the way you talk, somebody inspired you to be that way. And and and and if we're not careful, we forget that we have a source of inspiration that we draw from the way we we we dress and the way we talk and all those things. And the they look at the celebrities, they look at Hollywood stars and sports and influencers and all of those and and the rich people and all of that. They look at them, the worlds look at them and they aspire to be like them. They look at them and some they go on the internet and they will search for, you know, the habits of the prosperous people. What do they do and this is what they do in the morning and this is what they do midday and this is what they do and they copy all of those things and they try to live by the same principle hoping to be rich and hoping to succeed like those people are. But let me say this my brother, my sister, we are sitting here tonight because we have one desire and that is to be Christlike. Our desire is not to be the richest, to be the best in this or the best in that. We have one desire and one desire alone is that the characteristics of what the Bible says for us to be for that to be manifested in our being. We don't desire more money. We don't desire popularity. We desire to be Christlike. We desire the nature. We desire the way of handling things. We desire his approach. We desire his vision. We desire like we said yesterday, we desire to have the same vision that he had. When circumstances look like it's going bad and when our our human mind is giving us information about the dire situation that we are looking at. Oh my brother, my sister, AT THAT TIME I DESIRE to have another eyesight of what God would want me to do, of how God looks AT MY SITUATION, HOW THAT God will handle my situation. So these characteristic but when I will talk about in the message identification and say don't forget that these characteristics or these examples that were put in the Bible he says there are place in there to represent what the believer are supposed to be when when we read I made a comment this when we read about Moses and we read about all of those in the Old Testament Remember the prophet said those are just shadows and types. &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not shocking anybody. They are not the real thing. They are just shadows and types. &gt;&gt; But he says one place he says you go back you will see Jesus Christ in every single one of them. But my brother says WE LIVE IN THE TIME WHERE Jesus Christ is having a flesh. Jesus Christ is walking on earth. Oh, let me tell you, we live in the time where he promised the fullness of what was in Christ will be pouring into a people. THE FULLNESS OF WHAT CHRIST WAS, HOW HE ACTED, HOW HE TALKED AND HOW HE DEALT WITH PEOPLE THAT ONCE again the world will see Jesus Christ. They won't see him in the body that they saw 2,000 years ago. They will see him manifested in another. But what I'm says in the formation of the bride, he will make himself known. &gt;&gt; The same Christ. Let me say this. God has never changed. And here's the trouble we run into with the people in the age that we live in. We we WHEN WE TALK ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, EVERYBODY understand the fullness of God that dwell in him. But Brabanam tells us, he says the the ocean, whether you have the fullness of the ocean or you have a spoon, it has the same effect. It's no different. So whether WE HAVE THE FULL MEASURE, ANYBODY WHO HAS THE HOLY SPIRIT has Christ and God himself dwelling in them, YOU HAVE THE SAME POWER THAT WAS IN JESUS Christ is in you. This tonight you whatever he does, you can do. The prophet said that she is him. She is him. The the the the bridegroom cannot be the word and the bride be something else. So when we look at the characteristics of the Bible, we have to come to a place and and this is the confidence that I want to inspire in us tonight as I'm speaking is that when I'm reading the Bible, I'm not reading as some stories. I'm reading my own story manifested in some characters. I'm reading about myself manifested in some characters. WHY? BECAUSE THOSE CHARACTERS WERE PUT in the Bible. So we today we can know what is it that we're going to be. Let me say this. Our lives today the the we live the journey even of the selfdiscovery of what we are and what the word says we're going to be. &gt;&gt; We we and I don't know about you sometimes you shock yourself with the very reaction of what you do. You come into a circumstance. Yeah, we are thinking all things is going to fall apart and all of the sudden you find yourself on the other side. YOU'RE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MADE IT. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MADE IT, BUT HE KNOWS HOW YOU made it. He placed a seat in your heart and he knew that what he placed in you was good enough to take the test that you were going through. &gt;&gt; So that's the confidence he wants us to be that we may boldly approach the throne with confidence in our heart. So the prophet will say spiritually speaking we are living in a time of identification and and what was in the beginning and and God's mind what was in God's mind in the beginning is being manifested in the age that we are living in. Part of the challenge is perhaps in the message uh and I'll just say briefly don't want to get into any conflict whatsoever. We Ram says we are standing exactly where Adam and Eve stood. Uh this is not necessarily to return us to a a Pentecost where we can go back and get back the gifts and all of those things. But God is actually this is the age of restoration because remember THE THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST was for the payment of the price. So he cannot pay the price SO WE CAN GO BACK TO being children again. He paid the price so that at the end time when it's coming to be manifested, the scripture says it's the claiming age. It's the time where he's restoring what was right back into the beginning. But when I makes a statement, it says the harmony that existed between Christ and the son and his father. In fact, it says the harmony that existed in the garden of Eden, God is here to restore you TO THAT FIRST HARMONY THAT existed before the fall even came. &gt;&gt; It It's the WORD THAT RESTORES THE POWER AND THE authority to mankind so they will know what they are. AND YOU COULDN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE unless the word was revealed to you. AND WITH THE REVEALING OF THE WORD is the empowerment for you to know who you are and to act according to the word that's been given to you. He says spirit, the spirit of God, he's here to call out the elect out of the church. He says uh uh come from amongst them. The cry of the hour is to come out from amongst them. And God is calling out a people for his name's sake. He the iniquity of mankind's in this end time. He's filling up in Satan by deception. He's continually growing and growing and calling out his own. And we want uh and the message of the hour is here to expose the deception by which Satan has been calling his people. the what the the reason we gather here and I want to say this. It's because it it's not because we wanted it. I I tell you it's amazing how many good people you find that don't believe the message. A really decent human being that we we couldn't even compare to them. I it's not for our goodness that we believe this message. It's not of anything good that we have done. We didn't take one step. In fact, we don't even have the motivation of some of those people have. But yet, God is elected to open your eyes. God is elected to call you to the knowledge of this message so you can see who you really are. And let me say this, when because God opened your eyes, it's not for you to just say, "My eyes has been open." NO, HE OPENED IT SO YOU can feed on what is it that he wants you to be to KNOW THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET. THAT'S WONDERFUL. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO get to is the LIFE THAT WAS SPOKEN ABOUT, THE promises that were GIVEN FOR THAT PROMISE TO BECOME A REALITY IN our lives. He said we we we we we here God is here to see and and by the opening of the eyes so we can see the darkness that's out there and that we know how to navigate it that every believer of this of the age as always to answer to the call of the hour that we that we're living in. And this is our calling in the end time that we are looking at. But whenam says the end time message will overcome the end time challenges. &gt;&gt; The the and and that's why it's important that we that have believed the message will say uh this is not the Noah message will not work in this time. Moses message will not work in this time. We have a a a message that is called and it's the only provided way that God has given us for us to get out of the condition that we find ourselves in. So we as believers, we have to get into what is it that's been given to us to overcome the challenge for the hour that we are living in. So we can overcome the scripture will say in Revelation 10 and 13 it says and he said unto me still not still not the saying of the prophecy of this book. Now I want you to to really uh just follow what is it that is saying here. Seal not the saying of the prophecy of this book. For the time is at hand. The time for what? The time for the revealing of it. He says that he that is unjust, let him be unjust still. And he that is filthy, let him be filthy still. And he that is righteous, let him be righteous. Let him be uh he that is righteous, let him be righteous still. And he that is holy, let him be holy still. So and behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me to give to every man according uh according to his works shall be. I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end and the la, the first and the last. So when we come to the understanding, he's saying that that that I come he says say thus sayeth the lord uh still not seal not the saying of this prophecy he that is unjust let him be unjust still. So when we really talk about identification, it's not the coming into something new, but what GOD IS REALLY DOING AT THE time that we are living in. God is uncovering who is his and who was not his. &gt;&gt; I it it's not the COMING INTO SOMETHING WELL I I I see the message I never know what it was and I come across the message. Let me say this. The reason why you believe in the in the message you believe the message is because there's something that was planted in you THAT WHEN YOU HEAR IT YOU believe it. &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS NOT HERE IN THE BUSINESS OF taking Satan's children and making it his children and watch Satan do the same. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE WORD HAS GONE FORTH AND GOD IS CALLING FORTH HIS ELECT AND HE KNEW WHO THE ELECT was going to be. So I IT'S THE TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. Am I getting ready every day? Is the word bringing me forth and closer and closer to the rapture? Am I being changed every day with my life or am I getting worse? &gt;&gt; It's very important. You you can't you can't be the same that you were 5 years ago. You can't be the same that you were two months ago. The word has to continually change you every day. There has to be an hunger within the hearts of the BELIEVER TO SAY, "LORD, I WANT TO BE BETTER. I WANT TO BE BETTER. I WANT TO BE BETTER." WHY? BECAUSE THE UNJUST IS ON GETTING UNJUST. AND THE ONE THAT'S HOLY IS GETTING HOLY STILL. It It's the dividing line. And And let me just read how the prophet says it in the message God of this evil age. Uh paragraph 56. He says the spirit, the two spirits, one of them is the Holy Spirit, the other one is the devil spirit working in deception. He says the people of this earth are now making their choices. The people of the earth are now making the choices. So as we sit here every day and and I want to say this because it it's very important identification you are not what you say you are you are what you do and I let me just tell on myself and one time and and you know I I pull out my digital footprint of the things I search online and the things I do and everything. And I looked at it, I couldn't believe. I I looked at it and I said, "That's not me." I in other words, I I I'M SO ED UP IN trying to find out what's going on with the news and what's going on with this or what's going on with this project and what's going on in life and what's going on and and you look at I look at the amount of time I spend on my phone and computers. I couldn't believe it. So it you can we can lie to oursel and I could lie to myself. I'm a Christian. Well, I go to church and and everything. But you are not what you say you are. You are what your works prove to be &gt;&gt; and and and that's very important because THEN IT CAUSES US TO PAY attention to what choices we make, the decision that we make because we can have it up here. I'm a son of God and and all of that, BUT YET YOUR WORKS PROVE contrary to what you're saying. And the prophet will even go say and say, that's why it's important you realize it's the composition of your choices that make who you are. And your choices directs in what decision you are going, what position or or or what direction rather that you are going. LET ME SAY THIS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STUMBLE IN HEAVEN or in hell. But says, in fact, he says that he says you have to jump over every barrier and everything that God has laid before you to stop you before you find yourself in hell. You're not just going to stumble and SAY, "OH, HOW DID I MAKE IT HERE?" NO, you He He gave you grace. You walked over it. He gave YOU A WARNING. YOU WALKED OUT OF IT. HE GAVE YOU CONSTANTLY GAVE YOU YOU WALKED and you walked and you walked and that's how YOU'RE GOING TO FIND. AND IN HEAVEN, GOD GIVES YOU OPPORTUNITY AND you take it. HE GIVES YOU OPPORTUNITY and you take it. HE GIVES YOU OPPORTUNITY. SO OUR CHOICES DETERMINES our direction &gt;&gt; and and if we are called to be the sons of God, it's important that we find out that what decision and and what is it THAT I'M DOING? WHAT IS my life reflecting? IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WORD HAS TO HAVE AN EFFECT on you. But when it says one PLACE IT SAYS I WONDER if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and and impress I'm not talking about wow impress is IS THE WORD HAS AN EFFECT ON MY LIFE AM I ACTUALLY SEEING THE FRUITS I'VE BEEN IN THE MESSAGE 20 YEARS 30 YEARS 40 YEARS 50 YEARS ONE YEAR TWO YEAR WHAT IS IT THAT THE WORD HAS DONE IN my life WHAT IS IT BECAUSE GOD IS DOING A WORK. GOD IS [screaming] THERE FOR THOSE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR HIM. HE'S CONSTANTLY THERE TRYING TO MANIFEST HIMSELF EVERY DAY IN our lives. And identification is wanting us to know that he's provided a way for every one of our situation if we will only take him by his word. The prophet will continue and says, "And the Holy Spirit this year calling out a bride for Christ. He is doing it. Listen to this. He's doing this by vindicating his word of promise to her for this age. Showing that it's Christ. If the finger is supposed to move in this age, the finger will move. And if the foot is supposed to move in this age, the foot will move. And if if if the eye is supposed to move in this age, the eye will move. The spirit of God is here as he grows into the fullness of God in the age that we are now living. The Holy Spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour. I love that. I love that. And you know who I give it to? Anybody? all the unbeliever. Let me say this. When you believe the word of God, the message of the hour, Brother Ram says the Holy Spirit is here to let you know that you have believed the truth. It's not up TO YOU TO SAY, "OH, I'M GOING TO PROVE THE MESSAGE TO BE TRUE." NO. WHEN YOU BELIEVE the word, GOD HIMSELF BY THE HOLY Spirit is here to show you that what you have believed is the truth. He's here to vindicate the message of the hour. And let me say this, if he vindicated a prophet, if he vindicated his message, he's going to vindicate you, too. It's the same God. IT'S THE SAME WORD. THE SAME GOD IN THE PROPHET. THE SAME GOD IN THE WORD. THE SAME GOD in the bride. And the Holy Spirit is here. Listen to this. The Holy Spirit is doing it so that the people that believe God will be called out of this chaos. Oh my. How many want to be called out of this chaos? I Let me say this. I don't want part of this. These I don't want nothing to do with it. I don't want OF ITS FRUIT. I DON'T WANT OF ANYTHING THAT to do with it. IT IT'S ONLY DRAGGING YOU DOWN. IT DOES. IT PRODUCES nothing that's going to bring YOU UP. ALL IT DOES IS CALLING YOU INTO WORLDLINESS. But my brother and my sister, we have BEEN PROVIDED A WORD THAT WILL LIFT US UP OF THIS WORLD. This message will put you in the rapture. &gt;&gt; The devil and Holy Spirit is here calling out his church by error as usual by perversion of the word of God like he did in the beginning. See, it's coming right back to the sea time again from Eden. And here it is again. We are only here going here. We are only going to reflect whatever we identify with. Let me say this th this is very important to myself. What I have realized within my own life is every time I identified with my flesh, my place of birth, what I was called to be in the flesh and everything, I produce flesh. And every time I identify with the spiritual me and what I was called to be and what God wants me to be, I identify the spiritual part. It's a very key. You won't overcome if you keep looking at your flesh. &gt;&gt; You will not overcome if you keep looking at your flesh. God don't want anything to do with your flesh. Your flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for my heart because we we like I said, we we have to come to a place where we are settled. We have to come to a place where the anchor is holding. We have to come to a place where there come winds or wave there's no place we are moving. WE HAVE TO COME to a place where you know I'm a believer no matter what. We have to come TO A PLACE WE ARE NOT MOVED BY EVERY WIND OF DOCTRINE OR BY EVERY SITUATION. &gt;&gt; And the only way you WILL KNOW IS TO KNOW WHO THE REAL you is. I was telling brother Jonathan I said the flesh butam SAYS ONE PLACE HE SAYS WE ACTUALLY HAVE NEVER MET. How many have read that WE YOU YOU ARE NOT THE FLESH. THIS THIS here was given for you for you to just express yourself. AND I FIND IT SO HARD EVEN WHEN I TRY TO DO GOOD EVIL IS present with me. &gt;&gt; I do GOOD EVIL THOUGHTS COMES IN. this comes in. WHY? SATAN HAS ACCESS TO THIS. HE'S BEEN WORKING FOR 6,000 YEARS PERFECTING the craft of what it is to be A MAN. BUT THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T OVERCOME THE END TIME IDENTIFICATION WHEN COMES NOW. REMEMBER, OH, I'm just jumping towards the end now. If you'll forgive me, I'm getting excited. SO, HERE IT IS. YOU YOU YOU looking at you. WE CAN LOOK OUT THROUGH THE SEVEN uh the church ages. They will come at you and say, "Well, you are born a sinner and you have to give your life to God and this is what you have to do." You do it and you do it and you come, "Well, you got to be sanctified and you got to be justified and sanctified and you got to receive the new birth and everything." AND DENOMINATION STOP RIGHT THERE. AND EVERY TIME THEY TALK AFTER THEY COME TO the new birth, THEY HAVE TO GO RIGHT BACK AGAIN. REPENTANCE, new birth, repentance, NEW IT NEVER TOOK THEM ANYWHERE. BUT THE PROPHET COMES IN THIS END TIME WHEN HE'S TALKING TO YOU. HE DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU CAME FROM YOUR PARENTS. HE TOOK YOUR IDENTIFICATION AND BROUGHT IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE BEGINNING TO WHAT YOU WERE BEFORE THERE WAS A STAR, BEFORE THERE WAS A MOON, BEFORE THERE WAS ANYTHING. HE SAID YOU WERE THERE. AND IF YOU WERE NOT THERE, THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD GET THERE. &gt;&gt; SO EVERY TIME YOU MAKE YOUR IDENTIFICATION ATTACHED TO YOUR FLESH, IT WILL BRING YOU DOWN. TIE YOUR IDENTIFICATION TO WHAT HE said in the word, to what he called YOU TO BE. THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO OVERCOME. WHY? BECAUSE WITHIN THAT IDENTIFICATION, HE'S GIVING YOU A PART OF HIMSELF. REMEMBER WE SAID, WHAT IS THE WORD OF GOD? THE WORD OF GOD IS PART OF HIMSELF THAT HE gives to the believer. BUT THE PROPHET SAY JESUS OVERCAME BY THE WORD OF GOD. YET HE WAS THE MOST GIFTED MAN THAT THERE WAS on the face of the earth. He could have looked at the devil and kick him out by one finger. But the prophet will say he knew that you would come. He knew that one day you would come and he knew that you would not be gifted as he was. So he used a weapon that he knew that when you get the same weapon, you will produce the word of the same result. Butam says, "The word of God will defeat the devil any place, any time, under any circumstance." &gt;&gt; So what I want you to do tonight, take your circumstance and lay it there and chop it with the word of God. &gt;&gt; TAKE WHATEVER YOUR FLESH HAS TOLD YOU, TAKE WHATEVER COMPLEXES YOU HAVE, lay it down there, take the word of God, and chop every bit of it. Why? because he's giving you the weapon by which you're going to overcome. I'm no good and I can't talk right and I can't do this right and you think God didn't know is that another Moses &gt;&gt; a brother you know was preaching and he made the statement I actually I loved it he said God took Moses who was such an eloquent speaker and over the army He brings in in the wilderness a man until a man forgets even how to talk. And when he forgets how to talk, that's when God shows up. It says, "Moses, now you're ready." Think about it. We want to work into our weaknesses and our strength. We want to be at our best in everything. We want God don't desire that. God wants you to just stand there. But when I'm says God is just looking FOR ONE MAN, ONE MAN. ONE PERSON TONIGHT. NOT THE WHOLE CONGREGATION. JUST ONE PERSON TO TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH. Now tell me what strength David had. Yeah. There is. And the whole army of Israel and the scripture says that Saul who was head and shoulder above all Israel was afraid and David comes and you know they send him to bring food and little David and he turns and says oh there's food and he says and then there's commotion and everybody's panicking what's going on he says well don't you see what we have coming over there it's like what's that he said oh it's a Philistine it's Goliath and he's going to fight against us And he looks and he says, "So who's going?" He says, "What do you mean who's going? Don't you see the circumstance that we are changing that that we are facing here?" He's looking at them. Now you tell me. But what eyes, but what camera was David looking at the circumstances? &gt;&gt; So everybody kept looking at the reality of what was presented by the devil. the reality. You know, Satan knows how to frame our minds and our thinking. Look at you. You couldn't do this. The doctor ALREADY SAID YOU ARE DONE. You know, it's it's funny how you feeling very well and you go to the doctor and the moment they told you, oh, you have something over here, pain starts right away. &gt;&gt; Like, I came in here walking fine and now I got to I'm limping ALL THE WAY OUT JUST BY the news. It's amazing the psychology of men. &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE WE ARE WIRED THAT WAY. AND GOD DON'T WANT TO USE THAT. GOD WANTS YOU TO INSPIRE TO BE INSPIRED BY HIS WORD, TO BELIEVE HIS WORD. And David came AND HE SAYS, "I COME HERE." HE DIDN'T SAY, "I COME HERE BY MY STRENGTH." HE SAID, "YOU HAVE DEFIED THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL, AND I'M COME HERE, I'M GOING TO CUT YOUR HEAD OFF." LET me ask you, DAVID SHOWED UP WITH THE SLINGSHOT. IT WAS ACTUALLY GOLIATH THAT HAD THE SWORD who was talking crazy. You see, and Goliath is looking at his says perhaps he turned around and says, "Look at this guy. I mean, they went and give me are you mocking me? This is what you're going to give me AGAINST MY BATTLE." HE SAID, "I'LL PICK YOU UP AND I'LL FEED YOU TO THE BIRD." HE SAID, "I'LL CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF. Whose word whose word came to pass? &gt;&gt; Was it by David's strength? You know, I grew up in the in in the the uh uh uh Bible in the the the book of we used to get the the Jehovah Witness uh uh uh literatures and everything and they will draw uh uh uh David just this big man and everything. But one of them came and says he was a CC man. CC boy. He wasn't what he looked like. He was a just A SMALL PERSON. HE SAYS IT'S not the man, BUT IT WAS THE GOD BEHIND THE WORD THAT he was standing on. SO YOUR STRENGTH DOESN'T COME BY YOURSELF. IT COMES BEHIND THE WORD AND THE GOD THAT WAS SENDING YOU. SO THE SAME GOD WHO WENT WITH JACOB AND THE SAME GOD WHO WENT WITH ISRAEL, THE SAME GOD WHO WENT WITH DAVID, THE SAME GOD IS HERE TO walk with you this evening. I want to say this. It's the word of God. If I if if it's the word of God that brings us to our real identification because and every believer, every true believer that's ever received the word of Godam says the word calls for total separation from unbelief. believe and and and I want to say this. It it's not that you read the scripture says, "Oh, don't drink." And you say, "Oh, I'm going to go try to stop drinking." No. The moment you receive the word of God, it creates a conflict in your heart. The true revelation in the believer creates a conflict. And and the true believer conversion is when the things that you enjoy to do once you receive the word of God, you don't enjoy them no more. &gt;&gt; All of the sudden the war starts within your own heart. All of the sudden the things that you used to partake in, they don't mean anything to you anymore. This is not a conformity message where we come and say you got to do this, you got to do this. Let me say this. YOU CAN WEAR A SKIRT AS LONG AS YOU WANT. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A MESSAGE BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; It makes you a church member. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; But that's not what we are looking for. You can come and as a brother and and clean your mouth and speak right and and dress right AND LOOK RIGHT. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU A BELIEVER. WHAT MAKES YOU A BELIEVER IS BY THE NEW BIRTH. YOU HAVE TO BE BORN AGAIN BY THE word of God. BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD ABIDING IN YOU AND leading you. &gt;&gt; It's the new birth that changes. It's like the EAGLE STORY. YOU IT SAYS THAT HE HE WHEN HE WAS NOT in the chicken coupe what it's supposed to do, but says one place. He says it was the strangest looking chicken that you've ever seen. Like you know you know why are you growing so tall? What's wrong with you? And he will just be there and you know and he will go and says listen and the mother chicken says this is how you follow the instruction this is how we do and he says you pick on the ground and we eat worms and we eat this and everything and HE ATE ALL THE WORMS THAT THERE WAS STILL WAS NOT full &gt;&gt; what's wrong with you we we eat this and we are full but some for some reason I'm not full and they will come and they will be made fun of and IT TRIED AND THEY TRIED and he just wouldn't fit. Let me say this. You did the same thing. You couldn't fit in the world. And says instead, now it was told that in a certain season, there's a bird that comes up in the sky. And it says when you hear THE SCREAM OF THAT BIRD, RUN. IT SAYS, WHY? HE SAYS, WELL, IF YOU DON'T RUN, IT'S GOING TO PICK YOU UP AND IT'S GOING TO GO AND eat you. AND IT WAS SCARED. AND EVERYBODY TOLD THE STORY AND EVERYTHING. And they went and one day they were in the field and SCRATCHING AND SCRATCHING AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE SCREAM COME. THE SCREAM COME AND INSTEAD of running he hears the scream and the scream means something to him. &gt;&gt; He was told when you HEAR THE SCREAM RUN BUT ALL OF THE SUDDEN HE WAS ATTRACTED TO THE SCREAM. &gt;&gt; My brother, MY SISTER, LET LET ME SAY THIS. GOD KNOWS HIS ELECT AND HE KNOWS HOW TO CALL THEM. HE KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK TO YOUR HEART. THIS MESSAGE WHEN PEOPLE ARE RUNNING AWAY, THERE'S A PEOPLE THAT GOD [screaming] HAS PLACED SOMETHING WITHIN THEIR HEARTS. WHEN THEY HEAR IT, IT'S sweet music to their ears. It's a calling forth. And I thought, the only reason why this chicken kept telling this eagle that they eat worms because he was afraid one day he's going to turn around and eat them all because they were food to him. That's what denomination is afraid of. That's why people they they keep people under you know oh you got to do this and there's five step to this and there's 10 step to this. What is it is a man'smade religion that never produce anything. &gt;&gt; YOU TRY FIVE STEP THEY ADD 10 steps to it. IN OTHER WORD YOUR CONVERSION AND YOU becoming a Christian is always one step beyond where you are. Oh, if you can only do this, you will become like him. Oh, if you know who else HAD THAT MESSAGE THAT WAS THE SERPENT'S MESSAGE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. OH, if you do this, YOU SHALL BECOME GOD. THEY WERE ALREADY GODS. &gt;&gt; They didn't NEED TO BECOME GOD. THEY WERE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. THEY WERE MADE TO BE GOD. THEY WERE THEY THEY WERE ALREADY THERE ANCHORING AND WALKING LIKE GODS. BUT YET the deceiver come. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE HAS COME TO DO. LET ME SAY THIS. YOU WILL NOT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU NEVER BEEN. The reason why you BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD IS BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY A CHRISTIAN. YOU ALREADY MADE. YOU'RE ALREADY THERE. YOU ALREADY IN HEAVENLY PLACES. THE prophet said identification. There has to be something that existed before that you going to match against. It's not something new, but it's already something that existed in the mind of God that God is calling you to. God wants you to identify with who he made you to be. Not what your mama tells you, not what your daddy tells you, not what the world tells you, not what the teacher tells you, but what he tells you in his own word that you can identify with that. It says, "Now listen to this. I I was uh I believe it was Sunday two Sunday or two ago. A pastor brought this up and he read this quote and it just touched my heart and I want to share it with you. This is in the greatest battle ever fought." He says, and he's speaking about the word of God. says it must be accepted in the mind. Then it's believed in the heart. Then the word of God becomes a reality. &gt;&gt; I want you to anchor into that. &gt;&gt; Don't fight it. Don't reason it. Take it as the prophet said it. It must be accepted in the mind. Then it's believed in the heart. Then the word of God becomes a reality. Listen to this. Then every senses of your soul and body is crowded out with the Holy Spirit. Then your senses of God, your consciousness of God, everything that's godly flows through you. &gt;&gt; Oh my, there's no more doubt anywhere. There's nothing can rise up. That's this is this is our life in a nutshell. We believe the word of God. something within our hearts. It we heard it in our minds and we let it drop into our hearts responded to it and then what we need to let is every senses of our body to be energized by it. And then you you carry that it will become the consciousness of God living through you. That alone will bring the reality of who God is in your life. You you ask those that are born again and that's been in the word for a while. You don't wake up and wonder, "Am I a Christian today or am I not?" I I I mean, what in the world would that be? Imagine if you were a Christian based on your feelings for that day. Think about it. It would be a complete mess. I mean, imagine waking up and all of the sudden you you go and you say, "Oh, I don't feel like a Christian today." See how your life how your day will be messed up that day. &gt;&gt; It don't the the highs don't make you a Christian. The lows don't make you you are a Christian because he said you will be a Christian because he made you to be one. So he speaks and then he says the the then that's the only thing that can rise. So it and and it's important that identification as I said it it it has to be a revelation to the believer and and I want to say this but says what we need more than anything is spiritual revelation. We need with that revelation can never be overemphasized. Let me say this revelation will humble you. Revelation will give you meekness. THE REVELATION WILL HELP YOU NAVIGATE your life. REVELATION WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD IS TRYING TO DO with your life. &gt;&gt; THE THE THE CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO IS WE HAVE SO MUCH INTELLECT BUT VERY little revelation. People have we have received the message BUT LEFT THE SPIRIT OUT OF IT. BUT THE SPIRIT IS THERE TO GUIDE YOU IN WHAT HE SAID. The the the the Bible says WHEN JESUS PROMISED THE HOLY SPIRIT, it says WHEN THE SPIRIT COMES, HE SAYS IT WILL BRING YOU INTO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT I ALREADY TOLD YOU. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE SPIRIT COMES UPON YOU, IT'S NOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IT'S TO EMPHASIZE UPON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TOLD AND TO GIVE YOU THE COURAGE TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE WHAT HE SAID YOU ARE. I think about Gideon completely forgot who he was. He comes and every time the crops will come and the Medidionites will come and then just take it all. And here he is sitting under the tree. And the angel comes and he said, "Oh, Gideon, mighty man of valor." I'm pretty sure Gideon did it 360 and wonder, is this someone around me or you talking to me? Think about it. And that's exactly what we go. So when what says when you hear this message, you have heard from your theophony. So there is actually a real you that's already out there. It's just there to emphasize and to bring every time you seem to take go out of step. Every time you seem to fail, every time the word is preached, you're not hearing from me. You're hearing from your own theophony STRENGTHENING YOU, CHARGING YOU TO KNOW YOU ALREADY MADE IT. I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE WAITING FOR YOU. CONTINUE ON. GO ON. YOU ARE THE MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR. OTHERWISE, it would be giving us a sense of false security of something that we never been to begin with. But this word and the message of the Yahweh, the prophet said, it's the word of God that's come for your identification of who you actually supposed to be. And I thought we can come in and in the natural, you know, we we go to church every day and if you're not careful, it becomes a habit, right? It's it's Wednesday, it's Sunday morning, it's Sunday night. Let's go to church and everything. But but don't be caught up with just the natural. Hear me out. Don't don't get caught up in the it's a really good habit. The scripture says Jesus went to church every day. Amen. Every time the doors open, he went to church. But don't get caught up with just the practice of coming to church. It's really good. And don't get accustomed to, oh, this is brother so and so leading songs and this is brother so and so preaching and this is a because behind all of that, God is actually working a supernatural. &gt;&gt; You you the younger ones can say, "Well, I'm here because I have no choice. my parents brought me here, right? They can actually say that. But it's not just that your parents brought you here, but it's God that ordained and gave you this parent so you can be here tonight and be this. Didn't the prophet say that your birth was pre-planned. He kept this one and that one. He mixed this one with that one and that one until he came to you. He says he was looking for a certain thing so he can get you exactly where he wants you to be. And but what we need above the natural is to catch the supernatural that's happening. It's very important that we catch the supernatural that's happening because God will use the natural to gather us here, but yet he will speak a spiritual word that will come and give us the victory for the hour that we need it. It will come and speak something that will actually cause and touch somebody's heart and they will be changed. SO DON'T BE JUST THERE WERE THOSE THAT JUST LOOKED AT JESUS. It says he he went there and he said, "Oh, this isn't this HE SAYS THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME TO SPEAK GOOD TIDING AND TO DO THIS." And he said, but one of them says when he closed the scroll and he put it down, there were those in the crowd that said, "Oh, isn't that nice? the son of Joseph and Mary, they forgot to see that there was the fulfillment of prophecy that just took place right in front of their eyes. Think about it. Every time we come to church is the fulfillment of the prophecy that's happening. It's God giving you the word to overcome. It's God energizing you to overcome. Uh let me just tell a little bit about myself. I I I was never a friend of preachers and you know I I use the word not in the bed. I hated preachers. I went to church. Why not? you know, and and I remember one time and there was uh we had a neighbor who was uh who had a church in his house and and so every morning he will sneak in and and then come catch us kids and and take us to church because I mean there's no way we would have went by ourselves. And so we we kind of knew what time he would come in and and and and if we just hear him come by the front door, we disappear. and and and so because he knew that so he would come in and and sneak in and catch us and and one day, you know, we got caught then. So, you know, we got to go and so we going to church with our heads down and and everything and and he goes up and he preaches. This is not a message church. And and he preaches and everything and and when he's done preaching, he calls me up and said, "I want you to close prayer." And I'm looking I'm like does he know what it's doing? And and I go up there and I pray and everything and and what did I pray? I have no idea. I mean I was my my mind was out of that place even my body was there but my mind was not there. And and so after service I I'm I'm walking out. He said, "Oh, can I talk to you for a second?" I said, "Okay, here he is and trying to get me to stay in the stress, you know." And so he looks at me, he says, "There's something different about you." I look at him, I said, "He's trying. He's really trying to get me to come to this church." I just said, "Okay, thank you." I walk out and I ran away. Brother, there's something different about you that's sitting here even while you were in the world. I I was at work one time not and minding my own business and doing and a guy just walked by me and looked at me and says, "Are you a preacher?" I said, "No." Have you ever wanted a preacher? I said, "No, I hate preachers." And I thought, "God has such a sense of humor. He takes you and he makes you exactly what you hated. And I want to say it's the same for all of us. If you really look, it wasn't what you were running to. But yet God knew the moment and the time and the season by which he he says in one place if I could just read for the sake of time. He says and and he he says he says in the message to uh uh uh he says to whom would we go? He says something knocked at your door. You rose up and you stood up on your feet and walked down here in the aisle and something draw you. It says, "Now let me give you what the scripture says that all that he forneew them he also called. Them that was he called you, those he also uh uh them that those that he called them he also justify and them that he justify them he also glorify." Who was DOING THE DRAWING? GOD WAS DOING THE DRAWING. SO IDENTIFICATION IS NOT US TO SIT here and proclaim something that we are not but is coming into the understanding that it was God working on both ends and making a way for you to come into the knowledge of this message. But but I'm going to say this if I could just read this quickly. He says in the message Jehovah Gara he says no man come to me except the father draws him. All that the father has given me will come. He asked the question, what are you scared of? What are you scared about? What are you afraid of? He says, well, maybe I'm just not the right kind of Christian. Oh my. Isn't that our favorite word? Maybe I'm just not the kind of person who decides is it you or him. Don't speak the Satan's Satan's language. You know what calls it Satan's language? I'm defeated. I'm no good. I'm this. I'm this. You are piling and exactly. And what you're actually doing is you identifying with the fleshly you. And in doing so, you are actually empowering that part of you to actually act more and more. Oh well, I'm just not the right kind of a Christian. He says, how can you come to God without God calling you first? It says all that he forneew them he also called. Is that right? And and all that he called them he also justified. Is that right? And all that he justified he says he had past tense already glorified. And we'll get into that glorify tomorrow Lord willing. It says now Bbam says it's a finished work from the foundation of the world. It's a finished work from the foundation of the world. Let me say this. We are just playing the drama. We are just playing some a part. We We're not even changing anything. WE'RE JUST PLAYING ALONG WITH WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY PLAYED. IF, let me say this, SAYS WHEN THE WORD IS SPOKEN, AS FAR AS GOD IS CONCERNED, IT'S DONE. It it COULD HAVE TAKEN 10,000 world years and however many years. When God has spoken it, it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; He says in the rising of the sun or or or one of these messages, he says that the Holy Spirit is here hunting. Did you hear that? Hunting for the elect. You can't you can run but you can't hide. &gt;&gt; Let me just let you know that you can run but you're not going to hide from him. He's hunting for you. If he has to lay you flat on your bed, he on your back. He will do that. For all that is called will come. He will not lose a one. He says that all that the father has given me, I've kept them in my hands and I've not lost the one. It says, "So is your spiritual birth. You do things that you don't understand. When you were a little baby and you came to the altar and you gave a little baby, you came to the altar and you gave your heart to Christ, you do such thing, strange things. You wonder why you did it. But after a while, when you mature as a mature Christian, then you understand. Now I look back at at what was spoken to me when I was young. And I said, "Oh, I didn't see it, but he saw it. I didn't understand that. I saw what was the what the man said to me. I didn't understand. But now I look back, but understand." He said, "You don't understand." He says, "See, there is something that picked up. You see why you had to do it? Your spiritual birth, your natural birth touches your spiritual." He says how it's fitted in your life and as you grew everything fitted right because you were made for that. He says it was wasn't it strange things that the the night that you stagger into the mission the tent mission or that little church somewhere on the corner and something and something that the preacher preached or a certain subject and and you just fell right at the altar. You see and it says God knew that before the foundation of the world. It seems strange to you why you did that then but when you unders but you understood that you knew what happened. He says it's so fitted that it's so it's so fitted to you in this life and it's also it's fitted in the life to come. He says, "This world, this world and this life seems so advanced as we mature. Everything seems to go right with you. Our challenge is we want to know what's across the corner. &gt;&gt; What's coming, Lord? What do you want to do? What?" No, we are not called to know what's around the corner. We are not we are called to know what he said and to walk as he gives us the light to walk in. The scripture says walk in the light as he's in the light and the and the blood of Christ will cleanse you from all uncleanness. So, and I want to just hurry up so I can get to a close. It says when you when you look, it says the the trouble. And it says in Hebrew 4 and and 12, it says for every word of God is quick and powerful and sharp that every that every two edges sore. It pieces to every uh dividing a sound of the soul and the spirit and the join and the marrow and discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart. He said, "Neither is he any creature, or it is not manifested in his sight, and all the things that are na are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Everything is wide open before him." It's the word of God that does the dividing. It divides between soul and spirit. He knows exactly the the challenge that I find with us believer is yeah we are called to be a peculiar people to be a chosen people an odd people in the world but the challenge we run into is we fight it every time and we try to fit with the rest of the world. We try to walk like the world. We try to act like the world. who tried to do everything like the world when God has called us to be a different people. It's like Israel. Yeah, they are a chosen nation, a chosen separated people that God called. Yeah, they are. They want to be like every other nation. They want to have a king like everybody else. They want to have the fashion like everybody else. They want to partake of the the festivity and all the things that all the others were doing. Yeah, THEY ARE FORGETTATING THAT GOD CALLED THEM TO be a separated people. &gt;&gt; We are called to be in the rapture. They not. We are called to manifest Christ. They are not. We are called to be the bride of Christ in the end time. We are not. So therefore, we have to be careful. What is it that we associate ourselves with? What is it that we partake oursel with? Because what God wants us to be is to be like Mary to believe the word of God and let it bring to pass. What is it that he wants us to be? &gt;&gt; He said, "Be it unto me according to thy word." Lord, I don't know how you're going to manifest it, but I just want to believe the word. And and and in fact, what what I'm going to say, I love this in trying to do God a service without being his word, his will. It says God is promised in his word how that he will choose his bride in the last day. Did you know that he promised it? And he asked a question and said, "How will he do it?" And he said, "And by his original plan of choosing Christ, of choosing the time, choosing the season, he can't miss it." It says on his bride because she is part of his word. He can't choose it by denomination. He can't He didn't choose Christ by denomination. Did he choose? Did Christ come by denomination? Did he come by denomination? He says no. They rejected him. He says, "Well, that's what denomination done then." He said, "Then when he chooses a bride, how can he choose any other way? How did he bring Christ here? He says, "By the words of the prophets." I love that. He said, "Is that right? How did he bring how he how will he bring the bride here? By the word of the prophets. How did he identify him when he came by a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him come out of the wilderness?" And he asked a question, how will he identify his bride? He promised in Malachi 4 the same thing before he destroys the earth like he was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah. By a prophet he identified the bridegroom. By a prophet he will identify the bride. How many believe he identified the bride in this end time? When he came to the identification in the bride, he looked at you and said, "You never done it in the first place." He looked at you, he said, "You are sinless. You are righteous. You are justified. You never done it in the first place." Now, that's amazing because you can actually have in your memory the very act that you did of sin, but he's here to tell you you never done it in the first place. My question to you, who did it? Then you know how he answered that question? He says it wasn't actually you. It was you were caught by your sinful parents. They actually through the sin that they had committed, they brought you into that. It was it wasn't actually you that wanted to do it that did it. Now the question is who is he speaking to? Is he speaking to this flesh or is he speaking about you that dwells inside of this flesh? &gt;&gt; The flesh is guilty. WILL BE GUILTY ALWAYS. BUT THE REAL YOU, he says, was created in the image of God AND CAN NEVER SIN. IN FACT, HE says what you done, he took it and he dropped it into the blood bleach. And I love it. The prophet explained it one time. He says, he says, "Now I want you to realize the power that the bleach has. When you drop the blood into the bleach, it breaks the molecules and the atoms and it brings it into its original state before it became a stain. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; how can a man preach like that? How can a MAN THIS IS THE MIND OF GOD THAT'S BEING REVEALED TO US. This is NOT SOME NICE WORDS FOR SOMEBODY TO SAY. This is the reality of the word speaking to you tonight. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS AS FAR AS GOD IS CONCERNED, it never existed. &gt;&gt; You can't find it. He dropped it in the sea of God forgetfulness. But how many times do we go to God and say, "Oh, God, and you know, I lied and I did this and I did this." And he's looking at you and saying, "I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. You know why? But one of them says the the blood of Christ had the power to wash and take away your past, present, and future sin. What other identification do we want? He said it himself. He made it known to you that you are actually me, the real you. It's not YOUR FLESH. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN YOUR FLESH. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. YOU WILL FIGHT YOUR FLESH until the day you are in the grave. That's given. THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S WHAT we have to battle with as long as we are in THIS EARTH. BUT DO NOT LET YOUR FLESH cause you to do something or to go in the wrong direction. Why? Because it has nothing to do. GOD DOESN'T EVEN COUNT IT. He says the real you. Oh, let me just read it. I'm I'm trying to summarize it so I can save time, but let me just read it. It says, it says in the marriage of the lamb, it says and the ceremony says they there's no more it's no more her her own name or whatever. It says then then when the church has come to the ceremony, they promise to take the bridegroom names and she's no longer the church of the world. She's the church of the Lord Jesus Christ. It says man, it says I don't mean by name. I mean by birth, by nature, by power. He because remember the the the opening of the seals is there to bring us into such a condition where sin has no power over us. Is there to bring us butam says Satan's army bring diseases and certain army bring all kinds of diseases and deception and all kinds of things. I'm just paragraphing but he says God's army is here so he can cast him out for everything that he brings. If it brings diseases, we are here to cast it out. If it brings deception, we are here to cast it out at the word of God. You are actually be called to be HERE AS GOD'S LINE OF DEFENSE. &gt;&gt; Now imagine a line of defense that's wavering. Am I of him or am I not of him? Am I? Let me say this. Oh, brother, let me TELL YOU. WHO SOLDIER HAS EVER GONE TO war and not even got a scar? The challenge WE HAVE IS WE HAVE PEOPLE IN UNIFORM that's ever been in any battle. You there's going to be MISTAKES MADE. THERE'S GOING TO BE THINGS SAID that's not going to BE GOOD. THERE'S GOING TO BE HURTS. THERE'S GOING TO BE ALL OF THAT. BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM BEING A CHRISTIAN. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A MISTAKE. YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THIS. YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS. YOU'RE GOING TO DO ALL OF THAT. THAT'S WHY I MADE A STATEMENT. I SAID IT'S SUCH A CHALLENGE TO EXPRESS THE LIVING GOD WITHIN THIS FLESH. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIGHT IT SO THE REAL EXPRESSION CAN COME OUT. &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU. YOU KEEP EXPRESSING HIM. YOU KEEP EXPRESSING HIM. AND GUESS WHAT? HE MADE A PROMISE THAT THIS FLESH WILL BE BROUGHT UNDER subjection by the spirit that rises inside of you. ONE DAY YOU WILL EXPRESS HIM THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO. ONE DAY YOU'LL SPEAK THE PERFECT WORD. ONE DAY YOU WILL COME OUT WITH A PERFECT EXPRESSION. WHY? Because he promised that you will do it. He says He says in the invisible union, he actually calls this the prophecy of the bride in the end time. You go listen to it. The prophecy of the bride in the end time. It says her name is Miss Grace. The unmmerited favor of Almighty God. Brother says, I love it. He says, "Grace is old." You know when Maine was supposed to die and when all of this when he have done wrong and all of this and he said when the judgment was about to be pronounced grace stepped in changed the outcome of what we were supposed to reap. He says she's an elected woman. For it's by grace we are saved, not of ourselves, not what we can, whatever we can do is not counted to us. Grace is what saves us. May I add this woman grace? May I place her in the Bible also? It's called the elected lady. This misgrace I'm going to talk about. The Bible declares that she's an elected lady. And if you notice, elected comes from the word elected lady. One lady among all others. Now what year is this? This is 1965. only a matter of few months the prophet will be taken and he's basically pouring his heart out of what the end time message is supposed to produce and what we are supposed to be. He says, "Like the Virgin Mary, she was to bring forth the body of God. In the earth, she was elected woman. God chose Mary." God chose Mary. God chose you by predestination. And he says, it says, "But this elected lady, God is calling the elected lady, and you know it. She's a virtual bride. the word of the last church. She's elected lady of our Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus is the word. And how many believe that is right? It says then the bride is always part of the bridegroom. The bride is not some denomination. It says it will have to be the word manifested to be the bride of Christ. He promised to do it and he said how did he do it? He says he lo he says he loses his pattern. He says he also did it by his pattern. He he has he done it every time by the pattern. He says he does it again calling out a virtual a virtuous bride in the last day. The lovely Rebecca waiting for the Isaac. And and he continues on. He says he says, "Well, you well you separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now you were born again or remarry again. Think about that. Remarry means you had to be married before. And he said that by predestination he put the waiting band of predestination on you before you can even come on earth. And he said the union with your flesh where union with your first husband could not even be lawful because you were already married. &gt;&gt; How can you be married twice? Now how can the man be a sinner listening to this? How can you desire to do wrong when you hear something like this? I I think about the the example when I'm talked about this this couple that got married and and he says uh the sister she she's been in the word for a while and the brother was just a young brother in the me in the in the word and everything and she told him it says I I know you you you still a young man in the message and I still know you still just you have just known the Lord and everything and said but what I want you to do it says when you go out whatever happens to you you need to come home. Whatever happens to you, know that you have a wife here waiting for you. What a security. What a guarantee. Let me say this. That's why God can never lose a one because he's provided all ways possible for you to come in. He's made He's purchased the price. He's done all all that he's asking us tonight is to believe the identification the identity of his word. I'll call I'll just say what brother Jonathan told me. He said and I I just he said it's like the white dog and the black dog. Whoever you feed of which nature that's what you're going to manifest. And let I say to you, my brother, my sister, tonight, let's feed the white dog. Let's give him the word. Let's give him prayer. Let's give him our prophet told us we need to read our Bibles and pray. When you do that, you are strengthening. The Holy Spirit lives by the word of God. Let's feed him. We will become that invincible army. &gt;&gt; Let's feed him. Let's feed on the word of God. You are what you feed on. If you feed the word, you will manifest the word. If you feed on the worldly things, you The law of reproduction is what goes in is what comes out. It's not magic. The question is, what are we feeding on? Let's feed on the word and we'll manifest the word. If the musician could come, it says, I love this. Now notice you are not only that but you are going to the wedding supper in the sky and you are wearing your wedding band of predestination unmmerited favor the grace the wedding band of the grace unmmerited of your of your of our of our God of of your own. It says God did it himself. He knew you before the foundation of the world. So he slipped the wedding band of predestination and he puts your name on the book. What thanksgiving? He calls this his thanksgiving message. He says now the old book is gone. The old union. He says now your name is is is has been transferred. Now he says do you mean to tell me my old book? It says God put it in the sea of forgetfulness. You stand perfect before God. It says, "Now your name is now in the new book, not the book of life, but in the lamb's book of life." What was what the lamb has redeemed, not the old book, not your old union, but the new the bride. He says the but your new bride. It says, hallelujah. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. Oh, you actually have something to prove that you are actually married. You have actually the word of God to prove the certificate. And he gave you the Holy Spirit so you can know. And he gave you that as the ticket, as the token for what he has done for you to prove to you that this is your word. This is your identification. So we are not making empty claims. We actually have the proof of it. the life that we live, the seed of God inside of our heart, the heartbeat that's leading us every day. Hallelujah. He says where your true eternal germ is from. Where your true eternal jerm from the beginning takes hold. The real germ of who you are takes hold into the mind of God in the beginning. My I'm actually not human. This flesh was only a part of what the earth was. Remember the scripture says when God created man, man was created in the image of God. What was that man? It wasn't this flesh. The flesh, the scripture says it was gi given for the purpose of contacting the ground. And it's given for the purpose of manifesting what's inside. I'm actually a God that's walking in the flesh. My question to you, what came before? Is it the flesh or is it the germ? &gt;&gt; Because what came before will always win? &gt;&gt; What came before, sickness or healing? &gt;&gt; What came before? Is it your negativity or is it the positive? Why are we dwelling in the negative? &gt;&gt; Why are we wavering? Why are we dwelling so much in the negativity? My brother, my sister, the scripture says, "Look up for your redemption draweth nigh. I I don't care what the enemy brings at you. Just remind him that I know I come from God." We can actually today by the word of God say I come from God I go back to God. So not only Jesus can say that we can say that too. &gt;&gt; That's not what denomination taught you. But what is this? The revelation of the end time bride by the word of God by the prophet messenger to make you a perfect bride. It says justify doesn't mean justify. Justify doesn't mean forgiven. Justify is as though is never done it in the first place. But the word justify is is as if you you have not done it in the first place. It says but it's not even regarded. It says how is it done in God's book of forget or sea of forgetfulness your old book and your your old marriage is divorce and death it's not even in God's memory he says you are justified therefore being justified it was it was accused and it was accused and but you never done it in the first place. Your old union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness. I I I just want you to to to just take a moment and realize how powerful that is. God took your old life out of existence. Out of existence. You say out of existence. Yeah. Even the prophet couldn't find it. Is that right? Even the prophet, it says no fishing. Including the prophet cannot go back once it's under the sea of forgetfulness. It's as though it never existed. Now, let me say this. The challenge you still face is the enemy by the memory. He's trying to all constantly bring it up and say, "You done this, you done this, you done this." Boy, by the flesh. Remember, he has access to this and he will come constantly. But you have to remind him by the word of God. That's not me. That's not me. That's not me. That's not what the word SAID I WAS. I ACTUALLY WHAT? THAT WAS I did it because of you. It was by deception, but that was my intention. My original intention was not even to do it. But what I'm say the scripture says it says who can accuse the seed of God? Who? Why? Because when the seed of God remains in you, there is no way sin can be attributed to you. It's justification. It's sanctification. It's God himself making himself known. You never done it in the first place. Your old union. It says the bride is so he bore your shame himself for you and he took your place. He took your place for you and it says for your for your predestination for him to be his bride before the foundation of the world. And the Bible says so you are the predestinated seed. And he says this, "Your fa your first waiting was an old." Whoops. Gone. No proof of it. Gone. I did this. I did that. I did this. Gone. In closing, let me just say this. I think of God in the beginning sitting in the scripture says he will come down in the cool of the evening part and they will sit with Adam and said, "Adam, how are you doing today?" And Adam said, "Father, I'm good." He said, "What did you do today?" He said, "Father, you know, we sat here, the wind was blowing this direction. You see that mountain? We moved it and everything and and he said, "Oh, father, you see those animal over there? I named them." It says that lion. And now remember the mind of God was in Adam. And therefore, Godam says when Adam named the animal, it was actually the same exact name that God intended to name them. It wasn't it was the same mind that was in God. It was also in Adam. Adam gave the animal names and Baram says it was according to their nature. And we understand that God never went and changed the names. It was said and said, "How's your day going?" And Adam will talk and everything. And then it came a time where God will come and he said, "Adam, do you know I'm a savior?" And Adam will look at himself. Father, what what does it mean to me? said they said well a savior means you know someone is lost and you know and everything he said I don't know it but you know you my father I believe you he said you know I'm a healer and they said what is healing means he said well healing means you are sick and you're afflicted and everything and and then you you get you get healed from that Adam said I don't know what that means Christ, the mystery of God revealed. And God comes and he says, "Well, Adam, I'm going to let something happen, but at the end of it, you will understand what I'm doing." My brother, my sister, all of this was done so when we are restored into the Garden of Eden, we'll have a much greater fellowship with him. When God comes there and he will come again and he says, "Children, do you know I'm a savior?" Yes. Yes. Yes. Do you know I'm a healer? Yes. We will actually know. What is this? THIS WAS A VERY LIMITED FELLOWSHIP. GOD WANTED to expand the fellowship. We would actually know. Let me say this. THAT'S WHY I want to tell you tonight. No matter what you're going through, remember Barbanam says that he became a man AND HE SUFFERED EVERYTHING THAT YOU suffering so he can become the high priest OF YOUR CONFESSION. SO HE WILL KNOW WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT EVEN MORE SO, WHAT HE WANTS AT THE END, HE COULDN'T LET YOU BE SICK UNLESS HE CAN HEAL YOU. BUT WHAT HE WANTS AT THE END, SO WE CAN HAVE a much greater fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; Fellowship in his fullness. &gt;&gt; Fellowship with actually who he is and every single one of his attributes. We'll sit there. The angel will have no clue what's happening in heaven. They will look at us and say, "These children's really lost their mind. They love their father." Why? Because we'll be there just dancing and shouting and just praising our Lord every day. Because every word that comes out of his mouth will mean so much to us. Why? Because we've actually had the opportunity to experience it and to know who our father is. He didn't let you do it. He secured you first before he can let you come because he couldn't allow that to happen. So at the end he will lose you. He wouldn't. God is not in the business of losing his own. He's in the business of what he started with. That's what he's going to end with. God bless you. Let's all stand. I'm so sorry. I just took my liberty. I feel like I went a little bit too long. That's what God desires out of us. Oh my. I tell you, when you believe this message, you're walking on cloud9. I mean, sometimes I feel like, you know, I'm walking on the earth, but I just feel like I'm floating. It It's such wonderful in the heart. It It's just a fellowship. And he doesn't want this just for one. He want it from the youngest to the oldest. He wants you to have that experience. He wants you to know him one by one, but for yourself so you can have that communion with him. God don't want to have a relationship that he has to go through somebody else. No, he wants to talk to you and know you and he wants to fellowship with you so you can know him for yourself. Amen. How many desire that tonight? Let's just let's just bow our heads. Our gracious father, your word is eternal, Lord. And father, we can talk from morning till night. We will never cover everything that you done for us. Lord, we know one thing within our hearts. We know that there's something that beats within our hearts. And father, that doesn't desire desire the manifestation of yesterday. No Lord, we desire the manifestation of this hour. Lord, we've we've heard word after word, message after messages, but Lord, we know our heart is hungering. And even as the scripture will say that nature is groaning and for the manifestation of true sons and daughters of God, we ourselves are groaning also that you may be known and made manifest into our hearts, Lord. Father, forgive us, Lord, if we said anything that's not pleasing to you. But Father, I pray tonight, may you just lift us up, oh God, into the heavenly realm. You said we are already sitting in heavenly places. Father, give us victory that we may overcome. You said the word was given us for us to defeat the devil. Father, when we go out and out of these meetings and out of this, Father, when the devil comes before us, when a challenge comes before us, Lord, let us not forget who we are, let us stand by the revelation that you've given us. Let us claim what belongs to us. Father, let us live the life of sons and daughters that the world may see. Father, we don't want to be a reproach. We want to actually be what you've called us to be every day of our life, the living bride of Christ. Father, the living word, the living manner, the living God, the living in us every day, manifesting himself to this dying world. That's what we desire above all. I ask for every uplifted hand and and hearts, oh God, tonight just come and do a work, Lord. Father, come and fill fill us up with yourself, Lord, that we may go out of here different people that we could say it was good to be in the presence of the Lord. We're so thankful for what you do. Father, I pray for this church and for this min ministry here, Lord. May you just continue to reveal yourself more because we live by revelation, Lord. And Father, we live by what? That which you make alive to us. And that's what we desire. That the word may not become a dead letter, but every day, Lord, that you may become a God that walks among us, that speaks to us, talk to us, that we can touch and a God with skin on him, a God that lives in one another. That's the one we desire. Lord, we're so thankful. We commit all that we are and ask all of this in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Kill them.

[music] Oh, I'm already healed. [music] The battle [singing] is over. The victory [music] is won. [singing] And I'm already here. Amen. We're going to sing that song, My Hope, 1088, before we close. But I don't want to preach again, but there are so many good things in there. But as he was preaching, I it drew me back to something I just read recently in my devotions. And Paul said in Corinthians, "We have this treasure in earthn vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God &gt;&gt; and not of us. So my hope is not in me. My trust is not in me. &gt;&gt; My faith is not in me. My faith is in the elective calling of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; And that I take him at his word and the word will take me back to him. &gt;&gt; That's my rest. &gt;&gt; That's my rest. I like what he said. He said if you wake up and say, "Am I a Christian today?" I hope we're not saying this. But what he didn't what he also said is, "Sometimes I don't feel like a Christian. Sometimes I don't act like a Christian. Sometimes I don't think like a Christian. Sometimes I don't react like a Christian. That is not what I'm dwelling on. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. Not looking unto Jonathan, the author and finisher of my faith, but looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith. My hope is in him. &gt;&gt; My trust is in him. My faith is in him. My faith is in a finished work. And I'm just walking through the drama he's already laid out in his word for you. and the drama he's laid out his word for I. That's where my rest is. That's where my daily walk is. And when we wake up in the morning and we say, "I am a child of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because we are sons, because we are daughters, he has given us his spirit. Amen. He has sent forth his spirit into our hearts crying, "Abba, father." &gt;&gt; And my rising of the morning is, "Aba, father, I'm coming to you, Lord. I'm walking in your direction today. I'm stepping into your life today. &gt;&gt; I'm stepping into your reality today. And Lord, let me not see it through the eyes of flesh, but let me see through the eyes of faith. I'm one step closer to glory. I'm one step closer to a perfect image of Christ revealed in flesh. One more time. If only the portion, that's all he's asking me to be. Be the portion I've given you today. Lord, &gt;&gt; don't outwalk your confession. Say, "Lord, let me walk in what you've given me. And as you open it up, as you show me where to go, let me walk into that next step." Amen. My hope is in you. My rest is in you. My trust is in you, Lord. The arm of flesh fails. The mind of flesh fails. The will of the flesh fails. The discipline of the flesh fails. Even if you're a German, &gt;&gt; it fails. But he never fails. &gt;&gt; He's never failed me yet. I failed him many times. He's never failed me. &gt;&gt; And so my hope it tonight is not in me. My hope is in him. My trust is in him. My faith is in him. And it says here, I stand in awe within the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; What did he What was the quote you said? And I remembered it. Are we sufficiently &gt;&gt; impressed with the word in our presence? Are we sufficiently impressed by what he has done and what he is doing? I was talking to to a brother the other day and I said, "Do you realize we're in the midst of prophecy being fulfilled?" But the thing is, we can see it happening around us, but can we see it in us? &gt;&gt; That's what we heard tonight is he's asking us to see, can you see the prophecy coming forth in you? It's good to see it in Sister Brenda. It's good to see it in in Brother Grant. But can you see it in you? &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where it has to happen. &gt;&gt; I liked and I hated what he said simultaneously. He says, "If there's one person going, it's going to be me, not your pastor." I said, "Hold on a second here. How about it's me and my pastor? Can't I take somebody with me?" But the confidence that I have met a living God and he has changed me from a creature of time to a creature of eternity. And when I wake up in the morning to when I lay my head down at night, my eyes, my mind are set on things above, &gt;&gt; things that are higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things that are nobler. These have all my sight. I'm going to hasten to him. Amen. Let's lift our eyes up tonight. We've got an early service tomorrow, 9:00 a.m. Can I give you a pastoral request? Go home. Don't pick up your phone. Don't pick up your tablet. Don't pick up your computer. Go home and if you're going to do anything, talk about the service tonight. And then pray and lay your head down and wake up in the morning well rested so you can come back and get part two for what he preached tonight. No doubt. Amen. Can we do that? Can we do that tonight? Let's sing this. Let's say, "Lord, my hope and my trust is in you, and I'm coming back tomorrow to get my other portion. I'm coming tomorrow for my daily bread one more time, and I'm going to trust that you're going to use Brother Billy to speak to us again." Can we do that tonight? Amen. Let's sing this before we close. Amen. Brother Mark, I'm going to ask you to close in prayer tonight after we've sung this, if that would be okay. Remember, Brother Billy in prayer. Tomorrow, we've got the early morning service because he's got to fly out at 1:30 and so we're we're on a time crunch. He's only got 3 hours tomorrow, which isn't too bad. That's about what we've had so far today. So, let's come back. Let's come back rested. Let's come back ready. And let's be prepared to hear the word of the Lord. Amen. We're going to sing this as we close. I stand in awe within [singing and music] the presence of the Lord. In whom [singing] the wisdom [music] of the ages lies. [music] For whom the raging [singing] of the sea subsides, the [music and singing] living sacrifice, the only source of life, [music] my hope is in [singing] the Lord. [music] From this time on and ever [music and singing] more, oh my hope [music] is in [singing] the Lord forever more. And his [music] tender mercies come [singing] with every rising sun. [music] To [singing] meet the sinner in his brokenness, [music] to offer healing [singing] and forgiveness. [music] And those who trust in him will find [singing] their hearts at [music] rest. My hope is in the Lord. [music] From this time on and ever more. Oh my [singing] hope is in the Lord [music] forever more. His tender mercies [singing] come with every rising sun to [music] meet the sinner in his brokenness. [singing] to offer healing [music] and forgiveness. And those who trust in him will find their [singing] hearts [music] at rest. My hope is [music] in [singing] the Lord from this time on and ever more. Oh my hope [music] is in [singing] the Lord forever more. My hope [singing] is in the Lord from this time on [singing] and ever more. Oh my [singing] hope is in the Lord forever more. One more time. And my hope is in the Lord. From this time on [singing] and ever more. [music] Oh, my hope is in the Lord [singing] forever more. [singing] Amen. Amen. My hope is in the Lord &gt;&gt; from this time on. We thank you Lord as we come Lord. Bow our heads Lord before you and bow down Lord to the greatness Lord that is in Lord the word and that's been revealed Lord in this hour and this day. We're thankful, Lord, for Lord, eyes to see, ears to hear, and Lord that you've given us, Lord, grace in this hour, Lord. And we're so thankful each day, each hour of the day. And we look to you, Lord, as the author and finisher of our faith, Lord. And we believe, Lord, that you've come in this hour and you dwelt among us, Lord. You've sent your Holy Spirit, Lord, in this day, Lord. And we ask Lord your grace Lord that you would continue Lord to bless each one Lord and to Lord just bring us up Lord in that that spirit Lord here today Lord to teach us and guide us Lord to prepare us for a rapture and bring us Lord all in under your control. So we thank you Lord for your grace Lord. We thank you for the ministry this evening, our brother Billy, Lord.
