ask heavenly father in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you if you could turn to Matthew chapter 1 1 Matthew chapter 1 amen welcome sister June here to the service tonight amen God bless you and she's come all the way from the west west coast amen and uh certainly want her to take back greetings to the church and the pastor there there's many wonderful friends that we left there when we moved and came to New Finland so God bless you and go with you as you go back amen uh brother Doug and sister Beverly's uh shared a prayer requests their grandson Noah in Ontario I believe had a he was experiencing some sever pain in his side and so they took him to emergency and then they took him into uh emergency surgery for a ruptured appendix so they did that yesterday but because theyd waited so long the infection had had spread pretty badly and it was wrapped all around his intestines so anyways he can't eat anything they're feeding him on IV but he was up uh this this morning and seems to be doing okay so we want to remember him as well amen sister Beverly has had many prayer requests for her grandchildren and have we ever seen God move time and time again amen and we're just praying that someday the parents will get a revelation that there's a God that's calling them back to the fold amen but we want to remember them in prayer sister Beverly also hasn't been feeling so well so we want to remember her as well amen I also want to apologize for the blue hair and blonde eyes comment from uh Sunday I didn't know what the giggles were I thought the sisters were envisioning this blondhair blue-eyed beauty but instead they were thinking of the blue-haired blond eyed um mixup that I had talked about so uh anyways if you can't laugh at yourself you're not allowed to laugh at anyone else so hopefully we don't have any such flubs for at least another little while but God knows how to keep us humble anyways doesn't he so we had a good laugh about that on Sunday but uh anyways that I was certainly talking about blonde hair blueeyed not blueeyed and blond blue haired and blond eyed yes so anyways God bless you this evening amen we're doing another series uh continuing the series on the Holy Ghost and we're g to speak a little more about Jesus the Christ or Jesus Christ this evening and in Matthew 1:23 it says Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emanuel which being interpreted is God With Us amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing our series on what is the Holy Ghost and this idea of the indwelling god and we've been speaking a lot about Christ and we'll speak of him tonight I mean that's it's what we always talk about I guess when you think about it but we're speaking about the flesh uh the humanity of that man Jesus Christ and we spoke last service how he was born by the Holy Spirit by the spoken word and that was God himself creating that egg and that that that that seed there within Mary and she was a human incubator that brought him forth she brought that baby to full term he was born of Mary he was born of a woman and he was a perfect human amen he was he was the the DNA of God he was born by the word of God according to the word of God and he was the perfect image of God in in flesh amen he was a perfect reflection of God himself just like Adam was 2,000 years ago so or or in the beginning that was Jesus 2,000 years ago and we talked about how there was no sin in that body because he wasn't born by sin he wasn't born by sexual desire between a man and a woman but he was born by the word and so there's no sin in that body because it's a word body amen and if you can catch that Revelation you'll realize where you stand today when God has given you a word body amen and it may not seem obvious today what you have but you are part of a word body and it's only the soul that we have of that body here today but there's an eternal word body that's coming our way and that's going to be our glorified body amen but it was a word body it came from God it was from God it carried the nature and the attributes of God and that baby that was born was named Jesus or Jesus of Nazareth and he was fully human like you or I and we talked about this last service but he was not just born he was born and he was built for a purpose amen he came down because he's the word and the word always comes with purpose and so this word body comes and his word purpose is to pay the full price for your sins and for my sins that's the only reason he came in flesh was so he could redeem us and to redeem us he had to pay the price amen so he had to be a man he could not be spoken into existence just poof and there was a body there but he had to be born like us he had to be flesh and blown and blood like we were he had to come from a woman and he had to be perfect in his life to be accepted by God as the sacrifice for for us in his life of his own will that's when he had to be perfect amen was he had to do it as a man before there was ever any anointing on him and Paul would talk about this life that he lived and he would say for the law having a shadow of good things to come so the law was always pointing to something greater that would come later and that's why we preach in types and shadows out of the Old Testament but it's never perfect it's always pointing to something that's coming down the road and it's the full manifestation of what God intends he says the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things so the law was never the answer the law was never the answer and yet that's what the priesthood was relying on when Christ came was that the law would somehow make them acceptable before God but it was never meant to amen it was a shadow of the answer he says it was not the very image of the things so it can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect so no matter how closely they followed the law how perfectly they did their sacrifices it could never perfect them it could only meet God's requirement it could not satisfy it it says for them would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sin amen CU under the law their sacrifices could never change the worshipper amen Works will never change you good works will never change you there has to be something done there has to be a purging they came in a sinner they went out a sinner the only difference was they went out covered by the blood amen but they went out of Sinner and that conscience could still bother them it says but in those sacrifices there's a remembrance again made of sins every year so the same question kept popping up every year it was never satisfied fully he says for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins that means there was another type of blood needed amen the blood the life of the blood of a bull or a goat can't come in and and and live in US it has to be the blood or or of a of a human so it says wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrificed and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me there was lots of body sacrifice but it was the bodies of animals amen but Christ now when he comes he says you didn't want sacrifices of bulls and goats you wanted a fulfillment of the requirement you wanted an end to this you didn't want this endless chain of bowls and goats and Lambs being slain you wanted that to end you wanted it to be fulfilled in the law so that what we could come back into relationship that's what he wanted out of all this amen so the blood of bulls and goats didn't please God it just appeased him it satisfied the requirement that for sin there had to be death and so that's what was happening and there was this endless cycle over and over again and it was not doing anybody any good but it was holding off the wrath of God until God could come down and for and really uh put the Plan of Redemption into action amen and it would take God himself to do that living through Christ brother Brown would say it this way he said says and God being manifested in the flesh with Christ Jesus the anointed he says wrapped himself in a blood cell in the womb of Mary wrapped himself he says brought forth his life he lived a man he died a man to give his blood that through his body and the shedding of his blood that every believer could be wrapped in that blood cell with him so that was a body created by God for a purpose and it was to replace all the old sacrifices all the laws and to sacrifice that sin with one offering once and for all amen it would be a total work it would be a complete work it would be a finished work when that was done the sin question would be settled forever and we didn't have to worry about it once that was finished amen God prepared a way to satisfy his own requirement and that meant himself coming down it was none other than God himself coming down amen and then he would sacrifice that flesh body that Humanity to pay the price for our sins so Paul would continue and he'd say in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast no pleasure then said I who Christ lo I come in the volume of the book it's written of me to do thy will oh God we'll see this as we go that Jesus as a man his only purpose was to do God's will how did he know God's will there was a book written about it anden he didn't have to wonder what the will of God was for that flesh body because there was was a word written he says I'm coming in the volume of the book in other words what's written about me is what I'm coming to do church we have the same book written about us do you recognize that we're here to fulfill it and we're here to fulfill a a bride that can live a life that is above reproach by the holy spirit that can take a resurrection that can take a Rapture that's our part to fulfill but it's going to take nothing less than what Christ himself had which is God living in us to fulfill that word amen it's the same process amen every child of God is here for a purpose and you got a work to do while you're here and then there's going to come a point where God takes you off the scene by Resurrection or Rapture whatever it might be and until you get to that point nothing can take you away God's got a purpose here amen and sometimes you find you've been doing God's Will and God's purpose all along and you didn't realize that remember when we talked about adoption where brother B says he's try he wants to adopt mechanics and Housewives and farmers and this and that and what you have to realize is that when you step into God's will there's nothing can hold you back you can be satisfied you can be content you can speak with authority you can be in expectation because you're walking in his will and it's so simple sometimes we can't all be Apostles we can't all be ministers we can't all be uh people walking around doing signs and wonders but we have the sign and wonder of a life lived by the will of God according to the Holy Spirit that's the testimony of every true child of God is they have found their Kingdom Purpose and they walk in it and God is with them and God backs them up because they're walking in his word it's so simple it's so simple but we have what we have to do is find that purpose that's really what adoption is about is God bringing you to your purpose to your place and then you start to walk in it and you realize that every promise in the book is mine and you're able to walk and live in those things amen and so that changes your attitude it changes your approach I've said many times that before I came to the ministry really before we came to the ministry yes we lived Christian Life yes we had the Holy Ghost but we thought there had to be more to life that doesn't mean you have to think there's more to life but we knew there had to be something more because there was something that was still pulling us and C calling us and as soon as I stepped into ministry as simple as it was that's where our contentment was because we had stepped into God's will for the kingdom for me for me and my wife and from there everything just rolls off and so it's not that it's easy it's not easy to walk in his will but there's a peace and a rest and a contentment that comes with knowing that you've done what he wants you to do amen and that's what carries us through day by day he says above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither has pleasure therein which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do what thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second what he takes away the first Covenant the law and he replaces it with a new New Covenant he says by the which we are all what by that New Covenant we are all Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once and for all a body hast thou prepared for me a body for what sacrifice to reconcile us back to God Amen Perfection was God's requirement and there's only one thing perfect church and that's God Amen so he put himself into flesh this body this life of Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth came from God himself and we see church that when God makes a provision it's always perfect it's always perfect we may not recognize it sometimes we don't like the way it comes or the way it goes but it was perfect when it came 2,000 years ago at Calvary and that means it's perfect today whatever your need is God has already made a provision for it and it is perfect the timing is perfect the result is perfect amen you don't have to sit there and wonder is God going to do a good job God has already declared his Works to be perfect and all we're in is this little blip of time here waiting for him to do what he promised to do and he'll do it perfectly it'll do exactly what God intended amen I want to encourage you tonight whatever your need is God will do it perfectly according to what is best for you amen now we read last service that Jesus had learned obedience by the things he suffered and we know that he was born without sin and he had that nature of God in him but yet he had to make a choice every single day when that when that scantily CLA woman walked by he had to decide whether he was going to look or turn his head away when they rejected him because of his his weird birth or because he was supposedly illegitimate he had decide would he lash out would he beat him up or would he just turn the other cheek and then when he was rejected when when he he had the these these times in this world the scripture says he was tempted in every way like we are yet without sin every time he came to that for 30 years of his life he had to make a choice of his own free will no anointing no God dwelling in him he's just a Son of God like Adam was amen he was the image of God just like Adam was but he acted as God would because what he's the literal DNA of God you know we have that saying what do we call it um you know your kids will do something they say you know uh maybe uh uh one of my boys would do something you say John he's a spit image of you Jesus was the spitting image of God if we wanted to put it that way he acted the way God would act he talked the way God would T talk he reacted the way God would react amen he always did the thing perfectly but as a baby as a as a as a young boy as a teenager and even as an adult until he had his Jordan experience he was not God he was a Son of God he was a he he was a DNA of God and flesh he reflected God he was the image but he was 100% human just without the sinful nature that you and I are are are born with and so his every response was Godly cuz that's what he was he was God in flesh he was built the way God would be built and so he lived sinlessly 100% human yet without the spirit of God inside of him perfectly for 30 years tested tried put in hard times he got tired he got weary he got sick whatever it might be he dealt with people making fun of him and yet in all of that he never put a foot wrong mentally or externally he never had a wrong thought never had a wrong attitude ude never had a rude remark come inside but then he bit his lip everything he did was the way God would do it in all of his Temptations the scripture says he did it without sinning and he lived a perfect life and we see that God comes down in Jordan and he confirms it that 30 Years of Living Jesus never put a foot wrong and we see in Matthew 3 it says then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him but John forbad him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and comest out of me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer for it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him he said just allow it John just do it and so John did it it says and Jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased so up to this point Jesus has been the perfect imprint the perfect image of God the exact image of God when you saw him as a baby that was what God would look like when you saw him as a teenager that was what God would look like but until God came down and anointed him he could not be activated for Ministry he was just like you or I he needed God to come down and dwell inside of him and God did that by confirming the Perfection of Jesus he said I am pleased in him this is my beloved Son this is my begotten son I've created this flesh and he has lived perfectly before me amen we said last service how how that translation is not just in whom I'm pleased but in who in whom I'm pleased to dwell in amen God said I'm pleased to dwell within this body God confirmed that this was his created son that perfect human body the man Jesus of Nazareth and then God now steps into that body that's what happens at Jordan amen now there's a supposed issue of here because the trinitarians will say well here you have the perfect uh point that there's three persons of the godhead you have a voice speaking from Heaven God the Father you have God the Holy Spirit coming down as a dove and then you have Jesus sitting there or standing there as the Son of God Amen so they'll say that's three distinct persons three distinct bodies amen but we've already covered the scriptures that says God's a spirit and God is holy God is the holy spirit that is the literal description of God himself so those two are one amen so it's God himself self coming down which means that God must be able to both speak from heaven and appear in their midst remember John saw the spirit of God coming down it was God himself coming to live inside the body of Jesus of Nazareth and we spoke many services ago how God is not limited by physical laws amen he can speak from Heaven while sitting right next to you today absolutely he can do it church I can do that by technology if I can do it by technology then how can we say God can't do that that God can't speak from here and be here but it's not that he's not there and he's down here he's in both places at one time we'll cover that in a second amen but God think of it this way can God speak to you and speak to you simultaneously saying something different absolutely he can you can be home and praying and God can say something to sister Amber and brother Mark could be at his home praying and God can speak something to him at the exact same time that he's speaking to sister Amber he's got two complete conversations happening simultaneously how does that work that's outside of our laws isn't it I can't have two conversations simultaneously I can only speak one word at a time God can be speaking to hundreds or thousands of people you know I've thought about it this way on a Sunday morning how many church services are going on how many men is God speaking through well he's only one well if he's there's only three there should only be three places where God can be simultaneously but that's not the way it works amen why because God is outside of space and time and all he's doing is he's interacting through this but he's not limited the way that we are in these things space and time and matter doesn't exist outside of God it exists within God God's not inside it it's all inside of him amen the Holy Spirit can literally be in you and me simultaneously he better be and yet it does not diminish God one bit at all that's not the way God works he's not limited he's a spirit amen so we can see this apparent separation of of Jesus of Nazareth the man and then the spirit coming down there you see two and that works but that two now becomes one because the spirit of God enters into the man Jesus of Nazareth and what does it produce Jesus the Christ Jesus the anointed one that's what happens there but we look in the scriptures and and just to teach a little bit this morning and I hope it's okay I know some people really like preaching and some people like teaching we're going to be teaching tonight but in John 17 this is Jesus now in the garden he says these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son may also glorify thee now he's lifting up his eyes and he's praying to Heaven question is couldn't he just look in the mirror well he could have there wasn't One In The Garden of Gethsemane but he's not he the point is that God can be everywhere and still be in Christ Christ he is not limited the fullness of God in flesh is in Christ amen but God is omniscient he's omnipresent he's all knowing all of these things he's not limited to there but his his dwelling place is Christ his dwelling place is Christ his revealing is Christ Paul would say this speaking of God he says for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own pots have said for we are also his offspring his children he says in him we live we move and have our being so the whole universe is contained in God God is outside of it and the universe is here in front of him and he can come in and out of it and interact with it but it does not contain him rather he contains it amen God's bigger than all of these things Solomon puts it this way and Solomon had a wonderful way with words he says and they had built the temple remember they were building the Temple and Solomon says will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth he says is God going to come down and dwell in this Temple behold Heaven and the heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee in other words the solar system around us and the solar system outside of our solar system all of that the greatness of it the size of it the vastness of it still cannot contain God and then he says how much less this house was have built the point is not that God can't be all of those all of those places it's that he can dwell wherever he wants to and so he came down and he dwelt in a temple and he told him if you'll turn and you'll look towards that Temple I'll here cuz I'm dwelling there my shakina glory is there that's where I've identified my Dwelling Place was in that temple in the pillar of fire in that inside the holy of holies so God declares where he is and yet he is everywhere he dwells outside of all of these different places so God is that Creator God is our father the holy spirit amen and yet he dwelt in Christ and his indwelling presence in Christ made him the revelation of God to us that was God revealed to the people amen like I've said for Jesus Is God to us that's the revealing of God and not that man but it's the whole revealing of Jesus Christ shows the revealing of God himself that's where God has hidden himself and it's where God makes himself plain amen that's the name that God has received the name of God to us is the Lord Jesus Christ that is the only name we have for him he's going to have a new name later the Bible says but for now his only name is through Christ Jesus Christ that is the name of our God and savior amen and God even received worship through Jesus and he continues to do it today amen that is where God identified his Dwelling Place identified himself Paul said in Colossians he says as you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving he says beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ for what in him in Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily so everything that is in God is inside of Christ is revealed inside of Christ amen what is the godhead church as we said last service it is not the plurality of God it is the revealing of God in his different forms and ways amen it's not three Gods it's the revealing of God in three different manifestations so it's says that Christ in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead bodily so we see in Jesus Christ everything that God is and even when he walk this Earth we saw it in his purpose Redeemer and savior mighty God Everlasting father that's all in him we see it in his authority he was a deliverer he was a Healer he did Supernatural Works amongst the people we see it in his power he would raise the dead he would speak to Nature and it would obey him he could turn water into wine he could speak a coin into existence in the mouth of a fish great power great Authority and then we see it in his speech where all he could say is it is written it is written it is written he stayed with the word because that is what God has identified in amen we see Jesus come and he speaks to the spiritual world and he's talking with demons nobody else talked with demons before they might lay hands on them they might they might have prayed for them and they got better but nobody talked to Demons before and yet he comes and he's having a conversation with the supernatural that nobody can see why because God dwelling in him can contact that amen and what was it it was him showing the God above us and yet he's there and we see him comforting people showing Mercy to people healing people uh going to wedding ceremonies with people and he's showing what god with us and then we see him pointing forward to the day when the comforter would come the Holy Spirit and Christ said it's me myself coming back and that's him showing God in us God above us God With Us God in us and it's all bundled up in that one in that one body right there amen it's all the revealing it's the entire revelation of God the fullness of God is revealed in Jesus Christ not the man Jesus of Nazareth in Jesus Christ amen the man Jesus was pleasing to God and God dwelt inside that man after Jordan and from that moment God became literal flesh in fullness anden he was the DNA he was the nature but now the very person the very God himself in spirit form came and dwelt in that body and it what was it it was Heaven and Earth uniting together and that's the Perfection of uni of unity is When Heaven and Earth join together amen there Jesus of Nazareth became Jesus the Christ Jesus the anointed one the Mighty God and so we can understand that quote that we finished with last service where brother B would say when Jesus a carpenter's son physically speaking when he came to the Earth here that's all he was known of and the day that John baptized him God Vindicated him he says God spoke from the heavens John saw him coming in the form of the dove and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell he says the right translation there is in whom I'm pleased to dwell in he says Jesus immediately Anointed with God this is the person the presence of God Almighty coming down he was an he was anointing that and he says he was just a man till that time but now now he becomes the God man he said someone was telling me here not long ago that he was just a prophet he was a good man he says he was more than that he was the Anointed God the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God in Christ he says notice it how beautiful the father speaking from the heavens when he was obedient to baptism said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in no wonder Jesus could say all the power in heavens and earth as given into my hands but we have to see the perfection in this Unity because this is the firstborn among many Brethren it's the first of many children that are coming amen and so now we have a body that is subject to the person living inside that's what we see in Jesus Christ amen this body has a mind it has a nature it has a will of its own and yes it's Godly but it still has a certain element of self-preservation Amen we see it in the Garden of Gethsemane where Jes Jesus is praying and he know his time he knows his time is short cuz remember what happened on Mount Transfiguration was he got positioned now as what mediator and so they told him all that was going to happen remember Elijah and Moses are there and they're telling him what's going to happen in Jerusalem and as soon as Jesus leaves there he turns his face and he steps now into his adoption role and it's to be the mediator the full Redeemer for for fallen Humanity but he comes to the Garden of Gethsemane and he knows what's got to happen he knows got to die he knows he's got to be beaten and whipped more badly than anybody has ever been beaten or whipped in their life he knows that he knows the scriptures he knows the word he is the word and he knows he's got to fulfill it and so Jesus there is praying and he says if it be possible don't make me do this he has a personal will that flesh has a will that says I do not want to do this but every time he says it he says but nevertheless nevertheless not my will but thine be done so you see that body has a will and it's what it doesn't want to go through pain none of us wants to go through hard times Church none of us wants to go through pain but Jesus had to go through with it but he had to choose of his own free will that man had to choose of his own free will I will lay down my life because a lamb never got to choose a goat and a bull never got to choose but for the perfect sacrifice it had to be perfectly identified by God as sinless but it had to give its life of its own free will and God never told that man Jesus you've got to do it Jesus had to surrender his own will to the God within him and say I'll do whatever you want me to do and he did amen that's 100% man there not wanting to go through with it but there's 100% God there that says I'll fulfill your word CU he is the word amen but as soon as God steps into that body on the River Jordan Jesus that man becomes wholly subject to that God that is within him see you got to understand Church it wasn't just about living a perfect life he had done that for 30 years that tells me today you can't just be about living a perfect life amen it was never about not doing the wrong thing it was never about just doing the right things amen but rather it was was about living his purpose by the word of God that's what it was all about amen we read it says I come to do thy will what in the volume of the book it's written of me he came to fulfill what the word said Messiah would do amen we can focus so much on our Christian performance sometimes amen of not doing the wrong things and and doing the right things and and that's not the only reason we're here we ought to do the right things we ought to make good decisions we ought to have a a life that is visibly Christian amen we ought to keep our lives Sanctified I was reading the other morning in my personal devotions in Titus where Paul said this is a faithful saying and these things I will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works we got to live a good life we've got to make right decisions we've got to be a testimony by those things he says these things are good and profitable unto men they're not just for us they're for those around us to see how you can Prosper as a believer I'm not talking about money I'm talking about how you can have a life of peace and rest where things just work out even when they aren't good amen that people can see how we can go through life and we don't need everything they need we don't have the dependencies that they have and we don't make decisions the way that they make amen that they can see that we do things differently amen that's part of our Christian Duty and it's part of our testimony but that's not all there is to being a Christian remember what the definition of a child of God is it says for as many as are what as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God Amen there's a surrender to our own will like Christ had to the to God Amen and it's our surrender to the holy spirit that we can be led by him that distinguishes us from everybody else church you can go out in this world and you can find people living a life where according to what they believe you can't lay a finger finger on them there are people live a cleaner life than what we do based on what they know they live closer to what they know than we live to what we know you don't believe me your Prophet said it there are Catholics that live closer to Catholic Doctrine than we do with a fully open word that's in sincerity they're wrong but they're sincere but you can find people that are living a perfect life and they're sincere and they're committed but that is not all that God expects God expects surrender and that's surrender to be led not just dos and don'ts make the right decision make the wrong decision but go when he says go stay when he says stay speak when he says speak shut up when he says shut up anden that's what we saw in the book of Acts was a people a church that was led by the Holy Spirit not led by their own whims not led by Ministry led by the Holy Spirit as individuals day by day amen that is the identification of a believer they can be led by the spirit of God and to be led by the dove you've got to have the nature of a lamb and that is surrendered not my will thine be done amen God surre God expects that surrendered life amen and we must surrender our will to allow him to act through US amen Jesus lived a perfect life for 30 years but it wasn't until the spirit of God came in him that he started doing something with that perfect life we can sit on a couch I said it many times before we can read our Bible every day and and not look at anything bad and not get angry with people and not and that's all good but that's not why God created us God created us to go out and be in the world and not of the world that people could see us be able to walk through it and not be affected by it amen and that we could we could do what God would have us to do we sing that song Leave Me Lord I will follow leave me Lord I will go you have called me I will answer leave me Lord I will go do we mean it because that's what it's going to take to get out of here is a people that surrender to the holy spirit amen that's where you real Unity is it's not about Christian performance about dos and don'ts it's about can I follow the leading of the Holy Spirit every single day amen after Jordan The Experience there Jesus is full of God we would say amen he is Anointed God and as perfect as as he was that had to have been quite a moment you know as I was studying for this you know you think about that is the identified Dwelling Place of God the fullness of God dropping into human flesh I don't care how perfect was that must have been a a supernatural event you know in ministering there have been times and even sitting in the pews in other services there have been times where there was such an anointing I couldn't even stand up and that's only a portion of it imagine what it was when God himself came down and stepped into that body I can't imagine the feeling I can't imagine the change that happened there amen but I want you to see something because Jesus has proven over 30 years his character by obedience amen by obedience he suffered through many things yet never failed or Fallen but church he had never had power before and the first thing that happens as soon as he gets power is what has he done he's driven into the desert for testing because characters Pro D when you get power so we can sit here and say well I've got character I've got character but if you have no influence you have no money you have no Authority you have no reputation what's your character all about but the minute now you get power you get financial power you become a boss you become a manager you become wealthy you get a reputation you get a gift you get a Ministry now what are you going to do with it that's when you start to see is when you've got a chance to in for to take that power and use it for yourself that's when we're going to see if you've got character you want to see what somebody has really inside of them give them a lot of something or flip the switch and take it all away because that's what God will do so many times sometimes he'll give you something brother B I'm talk about he says God will give you a little gift to see what you do with it and then if you get all wound up in your mind I'm this I'm that and the other thing he says that's God will let you keep it but that's as far as you're going to go but if you can humble yourself and give the glory to God then God will keep giving and God will keep using in these different things but then what happens sometimes is God will take it all away and that's the other side of character characters proven usually in EXT extremes you either have an abundance or you have a big lack and what happens is God will put you in a financial burden in a hard time and what's he trying to see he's saying are you going to get away from your commitment to the body are you going to start chasing down jobs constantly are you going to forsake the Gathering of yourselves together are you going to go into Deb is your desperation going to drive you to God or is it going to drive you to man's way of solving these things amen God will let your healthful he let things get tough in your marriage just to see what are you going to do are you going to go to the word or are you going to go to your own flesh or go to the way that the world does these things amen that's when character shown is usually in those extreme things so Jesus now full of the Holy Ghost almighty God the fullness dwelling inside of him is driven in into the desert in two two portions of scripture it says he's LED and then in Luke it says he's driven he's driven into the desert the spirit of God inside him drives him into the desert and what's the question that he's got to answer will he use that power for his own purposes that's all God's trying to prove he's trying to prove will this will this body of Flesh stay subject to the word even when it has unlimited power because remember Jesus could speak it and it would happen that's what the prophets were remember when Elisha's there and they say go up thou bald head like your master and what does he do two bears come out God will obey a son of man he did it with Moses he did it with Elisha he'll do it with Jesus as well but what's he doing he's proving character will you use the power for your own gain rather than according to what the will of God is amen so Jesus has unlimited power here and the spirit of God drives him into the desert and the question that Satan's trying to get him to do or or the answer he's trying to get is prove to me you're the son of God you know we have lots of people say prove you're a Believer prove you're a Christian and they give you a task to perform Jesus never came to put on a show he never did it because people asked him to do it remember they came and they said we want a sign he gave them a ton of signs but he wouldn't give them the one they wanted because he's not going to answer to them that's not the way these things were amen but before if Jesus had been driven into the desert and and had to deal with Satan it wouldn't have mattered because he had no power then there was no anointing on him but now he's got unlimited power and he can use that at any time and so what does Jesus do Satan says you know you're hungry turn these stones into bread and he says it is written and he takes them up on top of the temple he says cast yourself down the angels will catch you and he says no no no it is also written it is written it is written and it is also written every time he came back at Satan he did not use power he showed where the real power was it's in the word god back backs up his word God doesn't back me up God doesn't back you up God backs his word up you step into his word and he's just backing up his word Time and Time Again Church you got a hard decision to make find your place in the word and God will back you up every time that's thus sayith the Lord he'll back his word up that's not me saying thus sayith the Lord I'm saying that's God's thus sayeth the Lord is the word when you step into that he cannot fail amen what a place we can find ourselves amen the word is our answer the word is always our answer we stay with that amen and that's what Jesus did and he comes back and Satan can't get him off that word it is written it is written it is written and after that Satan leaves and what does God do he brings Angels down to minister to him and he gives them everything he has need of everything he has need of but he had to stand there and not use that power for his own self and then and then and only then what does he do he comes down and he starts his ministry and the very first thing he preaches is Isaiah 61 he says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord OED me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound he's not coming with power for himself he's coming with power for you he's coming with power for me the power is not for ourselves Church it is for the body amen it is for the Believers it's for the children of God there's not an ounce of selfishness there the scripture says Jesus was weary and yet he gives peace and strength to those that are weary but he cannot give it to himself he has to go through do things without the power of that for himself amen but he's not putting on a show he's coming down to do things for you and he's doing things for me with that power amen and you'll find that Jesus now that God Almighty is inside of him all he does is the will of God he doesn't speak unless God tells him to speak he doesn't move unless God tells him to move he doesn't heal unless God tells him to heal but when God tells him to do it that man goes and he does it time and time again and it's perfect every single time and sometimes he goes and he's he walks into a crowd of thousands and he heals everyone and then sometimes he walks but to the pool of Bethesda and he just takes one out of it it's whatever God shows him to do amen he could have done whatever he wanted but he bound his will to the God that was inside him this is after the the he talks to the woman at the well of Samaria it says Jesus said to his disciples my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work the amplifi this is really a conglomeration Jesus said to them I am fed by doing the will of the one who sent me and by completing his work what his hunger his desire is Satisfied by doing the will of God I can say this by personal testimony when you step into the purpose of God for your life it'll be the greatest contentment you find money won't do it popularity won't do it influence won't do it men women won't do it women men won't do it you have to find your place and when you step into that it'll be a satisfying portion for you day by day if you can only keep your mind centered on this is what God wants for my life that's it you may be a business owner like some of our brothers here you might be an engineer you might be a housewife you might be a retired Elder whatever place you find yourself in if that's where God wants you to be there's contentment for it even as you go through those changing roles inside of your life amen so we see Christ here and he's all man and he's all God Amen he's not a second person of the trinity it's God revealing himself in human flesh and that body is no different to God than a pillar of fire it's just a body to him amen yes it's a human body it's born of a woman but there's not a lick a difference to God it's just another form that God is taking on it's another revealing of God Amen but watch how Jesus starts to talk now that he's got the indwelling god inside of him amen and we see this because we have to understand that what he's doing is what we're doing the way it worked with him is the way it works with us yes he's sinless with and he's got god without measure but the process is the same and the results ought to be the same amen but this body that body of flesh is speaking but it's not just him speaking there's a God that's speaking through him and and we see in John 8 that the Pharisees and the priests are questioning Jesus and they're giving them a hard time and watch what Jesus says here he says Jesus answered if I honor myself my honor is nothing you want to find out if somebody's got the holy ghost look where they're putting the honor he says I'm not honoring myself I'm not trying to make a name for myself every time I do something I'm pointing back to the father I'm pointing back to the god that is within me he says it is my father that honth me of whom you say that he is your God now that seem see seems an odd thing to say if God's dwelling in him that there's a separation there but Jesus is showing that there's a body now in his time and there was a body before the body used to be a pillar of fire and they had no problem putting God in the pillar of fire but what's Jesus saying he's saying now God has honored me and there's a new body now and the body is me and God has changed his dwelling place and he's trying to show them the transition that's happening they cannot see it the amazing thing is that they believe that Messiah will be God in flesh and yet here comes one and says God is in flesh and they're like yeah no way he's fulfilling their very Doctrine their very belief and yet they can't accept it amen they could see God in a pillar of fire they could see him come down in the temple or the or the you know the T in the wilderness and these different things and they could see God there but now they see the God standing in flesh and they can't make the transition from a pillar of fire to A Man Called Jesus because the outer wrapping doesn't look like what they expected amen he's saying I'm the body God's inside of me I have the honor of God dwelling inside of me I'm God revealed to you he says yet ye have not known him but I know him and if I should say I know him not I shall be a liar like unto you Jesus was rough on the ministry boy he says but I know him and keep his say so this is Jesus now this is this is the flesh man he's speaking but watch now the switch we have to be so careful we can put too much on a man and we can miss the God and you can miss it in the son of man this in this day and age you can think that's just a man speaking but there's a time where God speaks out amen that's what the son of that's what we recognize in a son of man Ministry in this age is not that the man William brandham was Christ he was not Christ but boy oh boy Church there was a time where Christ stepped into that body and did the exact same works that he did 2,000 years ago and that revealed Christ to us not in that man that was just God coming down and using a body and then he'd step away again brother Brandon was not the Christ any more than you or I are but God would come down the very person of God and use that man and discern the thoughts and intents of the heart like he did at the well at Samaria like he did with Abraham on the plains of mamry and that was God himself coming down and using human flesh all over again that's the son of man Ministry amen watch what he says here your father Abraham Rejoice to see my day he says and he saw it and was glad now who's speaking here is this Jesus of Nazareth no no no this is the god inside of him because my day is always the day that the Lord fulfills his word that's what it is for us amen for Abraham the day of the Lord was him coming and saying you're going to have a son amen that was the day and God himself came to do us for us the day of the Lord is the resurrection and the Rapture and the day of the Lord for the rest of the world is what final judgment amen it's the day uh of Judgment at the end of the tribulation Jesus is saying here Abraham was so happy when he saw me and I told him he would have a son he says then said the Jews unto him Thou Art not yet 50 years old and hast thou seen Abraham Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you before Abraham was I am now was Jesus of Nazareth back before Abraham no this is a created body it was not Jesus of a Jesus of Nazareth that was walking the the road to to to Abraham on the plains of mamry and these different things but what he says here is I was there before Abraham who I am the self-existing one this is Jehovah God speaking now through him and Jesus says what before before Abraham was I was there before that who the Christ not Jesus of Nazareth Jesus the Christ the dwelling place of God Amen he was the visible God as the pillar of fire he was the dwelling place of God he was the image of God and brother BR would put it this way he says you've seen the picture of this Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel when it was here on Earth when it was in the burning bush he says it was Christ what the dwelling place of God all Bible teachers know that when he was here on Earth he said before Abraham was I am the I am was in the burning bush he said I came from God I go to God now watch how he explain this he came in from a pillar of fire was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the form of God's son the Christ died buried rose again and the same Pillar of Fire returned back under the name of Jesus the Holy Ghost he says on the road to Damascus Paul was struck down a light shining in his face and he said Saul why person cutest thou me and he said who are you Lord and he said I am Jesus it's not another person it's just the dwelling place of God that has changed it's where God hides himself and it's where God reveals himself to us he's revealed to everyone else he's hidden they can't see him amen he's hidden and it fools them every time because they're looking at the packaging instead of looking at how it Compares with what the word says amen remember what Jesus said he says if you can't believe me believe my works for there that's what the I'm doing what the word says I was going to do you can't get past the wrapping but just look at the works and they'll testify of me right that's what always fools people they like the results they don't like the package every single time and so they won't go all the way with God and that's where denominations are stuck is they might like the results but they don't like the package that comes with it he says but when he died and arose again and come up the Bible said no one has ascended up but he that that came down first amen when he was in heaven who Christ he was the logos that went out of God in the beginning and when he came down on Earth and was not made to be an angel he came down on Earth and took the form of a bondsman not an angel not come down in the great Jehovah Glory but he came down as a man to redeem man to die for man to die as a man he says he never died as God he died as a man the sin of man was upon the son of man and he had to become a man in order to pay the penalty amen so we have this picture that we had before of the pillar of fire and it was God in the pillar of fire that was the logos that came out of God remember that was the light that was created it was a pillar of light a pillar of fire and then God came in and dwelt personally in that Pillar of Fire and that was the Christ that was the anointed one that was the body that is the dwelling place of God and then that Pillar of Fire 2,000 years ago was set aside and so what happens if you watch the screen is that pillar fire is set aside and there's a different body now and that body is called Jesus of Nazareth and then God comes in and he dwells in it and that becomes Jesus Christ Jesus the anointed one amen and Jesus Christ is the new name the new Dwelling Place the new revelation of God that's what he is but God has just changed forms but now he's got a name before he was Jehovah it really had a name that was unpronouncable as we talked about it to make the name you know y ww however it is um you know Yahweh we would call it but you can't actually pronounce it and they say you do it by breathing in that's how you pronounce the name of God as he gave it to the to the to the Israelites to the Jews and so you could never pronounce it but now he comes down and because he's coming into Redemption he's a Kinsman he needs a name he needs an identity and his name is Jesus that is now the name of God and he is known by no other name until the word is completely fulfilled everything that he does now is through Jesus the Christ amen God chose that name not you not I not Mary not Joseph God said his name will be Jesus and God identified himself with that name that's why we baptize in the name of Jesus Christ because that is the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost it is Jesus Christ amen that is the name of God and he put this is God's choosing he put everything he was into Christ and he says I'm running it through him and so our access is through Christ our Salvation is through Christ Our only comfort is through Christ it's all through Christ because that's the revealing of God to the bride in this time Amen to the Gentiles brother Bram continues he says what did he do the Bible said he was made a little lower than the angels in order for death he says that he might take away and abolish sin and take away sickness from the world he says now when he came down from the highest logos from God he came down through Angels came down and was made a man and he said I'm not evil even a man I'm a worm and no man for he was despised and rejected there is no beauty that we should desire him he was m above every man he said he was probably a little skinny spin looking fellow didn't look like a king Church guess what he doesn't look like a king very much today either don't worry about how you look don't worry about people think about the outer package amen they're always fooled by the wrapping by the outer skin of God they never recognize him amen but there's a people that will he says many times that people judge people by the way they dress or by their stature man is not judged by how big he is and how strong is his muscles man is judged by character and character alone he said I've seen men that weigh 200 lb didn't have an ounce of man about them man is judged by character he says what he is in his heart he says and Christ was not judged by a physical strength but he was judged by character never man ever lived like him or never a man could ever die like him never a man could Ascend up on high like him because he was God he says I am of no man he says he made himself of no reputation that's why I said you want to think you if somebody's got a great anointing they'll have this they'll make themselves of no reputation he said did you ever think the man that made an artificial eye made a reputation the man that made false teeth made a reputation the man that made a wooden arm made a reputation ation for himself he says but the man who made the original eye the man who made the original arm made himself of no reputation but became a servant a bondsman unto men who were Sinners that he might win them back amen Jesus said he that is greatest among you let him be what your minister your servant and he did it by example amen he said if I your Lord and Master do it so ought you to do it wash their feet humble yourself before your brothers and sisters but Jesus would go from here and they they're challenging him about who he is and Jesus never held back he gave them the clear answers they were looking for he pointed to the word he pointed to his life he pointed to his words he says compare them and you'll find that I am he but the scripture says then came the Jews round about him and said unto him how long Dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the Christ tell us plainly stop beating around the bush Jesus he didn't beat her on the bush they just didn't want to hear it but they said we want to hear you say it not so they could believe but so that they could accuse sometimes people want to pin you down not so they can believe you but so they can hold you to something of their own making not of their not of the word and Jesus answered them said I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me so he says look at my life look at the things I do he says but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as I I said unto you church that means the revelation of God is not for everyone not everyone is going to recognize Christ not everyone is going to recognize his message not everyone is going to accept his word there's two flocks there's his sheep and then there's everybody else and we got to be okay with that amen he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me that's always the identification of a child of God is they can hear the word they can accept the word they can obey the word and they can follow the word that's it that's it you do that and everything else in that word will come to you amen you can start as a as the the worst sinner on this planet and if you will accept acts 238 it will take you completely into eternal life that's simple that's simple but you know what 99.9% of the denominational world can't even do that because they they baptize in a different name they can't even do something so simple and so they can never go on to the Holy Ghost they need to do it according to the word simple obedience brother BR brother Braham said entitles you to the Token get baptized the right way truly repent turn your life around and you'll receive the Holy Ghost that's all there is to it but the thing is it's an open word now so you can't just say well this is all I want no you got to accept it all and that's what most people don't want because it is a complete surrender required to accept a complete word amen he says and I give them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than all now if this is the if this is three persons in the Trinity and they're all co-equal Jesus says my father's greater than all so they there's something wrong there but this is the man speaking my Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand remember he says they gave them me he says I've been given to them what did the scripture say in Isaiah unto us a child is born unto us a son is given amen he's just saying I'm fulfilling Isaiah folks don't you see it don't you see it he's confirming the word but he's also confirming this isn't about me the man this is about the God that's inside of me amen God is greater than all and Jesus is just revealing him through his life and then he says I am my father and one I mean he leaves no doubt about who he is he says I am the Messiah that's what he's saying here God is dwelling inside of me amen the Anointed God living in flesh it says then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him they keep trying to Stone him he says then Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of these Works do you Stone me he says I've done so many good things which of these good things is it that you're stoning me for Jesus didn't say I did The Works he says my father did The Works see we would say oh well I did that no he says no no no it's not me that does it it's the father in me that's doing it it's God living inside of me amen Jesus couldn't do a miracle until after Jordan he wasn't meant to that wasn't his ministry but as soon as God comes into him now there's Supernatural power and he can do whatever he needs to do the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not we're not doing this because of what you you've done he says they said but for blasphemy and because thou being a man maketh thyself God and yet when you go to Isaiah it says that he would be all he would be Mighty God like brother Braham says you can't tell a Jew that God is three persons you can't cut God up for a Jew they don't believe it they believe that God is one and they believe that Messiah will be God in flesh and yet God in flesh is standing there and they can't see it why because they're not his children that's what Jesus said it's not a matter of Education it's a matter of do you have something on the inside side that connects with that word that's standing in front of you that's the only reason we can church that's the only reason we can do it today they knew their Doctrine perfectly and their Doctrine came and stood in front of them and they couldn't accept it that's a lesson for us to evening don't rely on the fact that you're raised in a message you believe an end time message you've heard a prophet and you know that Christ is coming now and revealing himself through his church you need to see it in your life not just hear it over a Pulpit and say I believe it amen Jesus answered them and said is it not written in your law that ye are Gods I said ye are Gods if he called them Gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemist because I said I am the Son of God if I do not the works of my father believe me not but if I do though ye believe not me believe The Works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him what is it perfect submission perfect Unity right there a man in flesh so perfectly in tune with the spirit of God that he could say I am him and he is me perfect Unity Heaven and Earth come down amen he says I'm in him and he's in me as we start to close for says this he says when Solomon built the temple and it was dedicated God came into that Temple and dwelt there is that right and when Jesus Christ was dedicated to God on the River Jordan God came down and dwelt in Jesus Christ he said he's Jehovah Jehovah of the old became Jesus Christ in the new amen I've got one long quote here and then we'll finish by God's grace he says he came as son of man the prophet even that little woman in all her sin there at the well she recognized him she said we know the messiah's coming which is called the Christ and that's what he'll do see she recogn because she was a predestinated seed where the rest of them didn't recognize it he says they had nothing to recognize with they were in sin to begin with he says for his acts he's speaking now as an actor in a play he changes his form then he came down in the form of son of man in the days of Christ for the reformers age Wesley Lutheran all down through then we find out that they got it so bundled up like the Israelites did till when he does appear in the last days the Pentecostal ages the Holy Spirit they rejected it they did the same thing Israel did he says and what does he do now so he's speaking now of the seventh Church age the last age the Pentecostal age he calls it the leosan church age he says he returns as son of man he returns as a prophet the prophet is not God but he returns in the ministry of a prophet brother Ram spoke or brother Mark spoke about this I think in the last service how God always uses a son of man Ministry to reveal Redemption every time Christ comes as son of man then what comes behind that Paul Paul completely opens up the book of redemption Paul completely shows us what it means to be part of the redeemed Paul's the one that tells us those who he has predestinated you've Justified you he Sanctified you he's perfected you he's placed you in Heavenly places he's showing us the whole picture the whole effect of redemption and Jesus never told us that but yet he did through Paul right by the Holy Spirit quickening him amen so it comes down through a son of man min Ministry to finalize Redemption first to the Gentiles and he does that in a Malachi 45 and 6 Ministry amen and then God takes Christ takes us up and then we go into the marriage supper and then what happens is he sends a son of man Ministry all over again to the Gentiles and that's what bringing them to Redemption 144,000 go there Christ never steps down on this Earth until the end of the tribulation and yet Christ is being revealed the whole time how son of man Ministry and then in the ministry of bride that's where he's revealed now he's never shown and all the world is looking for him to come back and the simple fact is he comes back and they never see him and by the time they finally get to see him every eye gets to see him and it's too late then and it's only judgment they've missed Christ in flesh again not just in profit but in you and I in the bride coming of Christ and we'll talk about that much much more in future Services Lord willing he says but then from that son of David he says see how close we are son of man son of David Son of God he's revealed in the last days of son of man according to Malachi 4 all the rest of the prophecies pertaining to this hour no more dealing with the church after they put him out he's on the outside knocking at the door there's some predestinated seed in there yet he must get to them and that's what the prophet of God was doing was he was saying come out of her my people and that's what we're doing today we tell people come out of her my people there's no life in denominations Christ is outside How can there be life there how can the full word be there the the word is outside that means they must be worshiping somebody else that's hard but it's true he says but God in man had emptied himself he says Joel 2:28 we find out he said I will pour out in the last days my spirit he says now if you notice the word there the Greek word he says you have to watch the words in English sometimes they mean double meanings just like the word we say God God created the heavens and earth Genesis 1 he says now in the Bible it said in the beginning Elohim he says now that word Elohim the English calls God but it really wasn't because brother B would say God is an object of worship there is nobody to worship him so God in English means an object of worship God in the Hebrew does not mean God there's a whole span of things that they use for that word God sometimes it's Adonai sometimes it's it's uh L or Elohim or these different ones and it all mean we just translate it as God or Lord sometimes but in in Hebrew they have so many different words for this word God and it's reflecting who he is and who he's revealing himself as he says anything can be God to the word God you can make an idol of God you can make a piano of God you can make anything of God he says but it isn't so in the word Elohim it means the self-existing one see that piano cannot be self-existing nothing else can be self-existent he says so the word Elohim mean means he that always existed God can mean anything see the difference in the word he's saying so don't just look at this word God you got to look at the deeper meaning of what's really there he says now when it's said here that he emptied himself or poured out he's talking about Joel 228 he says now we would think like this he would vomit up like you were emptying out your stomach or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him he says but the word kenos in the Greek does not mean that he vomited up or his arm went off or his eye went out or another person he says that is he changed himself he poured himself into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit but it was he himself he says now catch this this doesn't even make sense in typical English he says he himself poured himself into the people we're going to get into this as we get into the what is the holy ghost in us because we can look at the Holy Ghost as an object but it can't be an object it's a person he himself poured himself into the people God himself is living inside the bride today amen he says Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think God pouring himself into the human being into the believer pour out it was a part of his drama to do so God all the fullness all the godhead bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone not a third person person or a second person or a first person but the person God veiled in human flesh 1 Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God God Elohim Capital God in the Bible it refers to in the original it said Elohim in the beginning Elohim see without controversy great is the mystery of Elohim for Elohim was made flesh and we handled him he says Elohim veiled in human flesh the great Jehovah that covered all space time and everywhere was made man we handled him Elohim in the beginning Elohim and Elohim was made flesh and dwelt among us what he says this is his way the parts of the drama this is the way God does it in other words so don't be surprised if he changes his form again that's what God's trying to get through our heads don't just keep looking for that man to come back with nail scars in his hands and in his feet and a spear hole in his side look for God to reveal himself through his word he says this is his way the parts of the drama that's the way he's to act it out his way of revealing himself to us as some different person he says we are mortal and he knows that and we only understand as Mortals we only know as Mortals we only know as our senses will let us know and the rest of it we believe by faith amen he says we have to say there is a God whether we see him or not we believe it anyhow see whether there is or not we still believe it because God said so there is a Point Church where we have to walk by faith I have seen certain things and so you cannot tell me they do not exist I have heard certain things and so you cannot tell me that they were not said but there are things in this word that I have not yet experienced but yet because I have he heard and seen and experienced a portion I believe that which I have not seen heard or experienced yet that's the Walk of Faith amen whether there is or not we still believe it because God said so he says notice all the glory that is in God is in the word all the blessings that's in God is in the word he says it's hid to the unbeliever by Traditions I was showing brother Joe something at the house the other day where there was a a a woman talking about signs and wonders and this man got up and he called her out as a false prophet now I'm not saying this woman in particular was a correct Prophet but he said God is only revealing himself through his word now and what was he saying he was saying God is bound by these Pages What a Sad place to live where you've got the word without the life of the word you've got the word without the spirit of the word you don't even have the truth of the word because you're binding it by your own Traditions why because you don't have what it says that's why they believe it is because they don't have it we believe it because we have it in portion and we're believing we're going to get the rest of it amen everything we have need of is given to us when we receive the Holy Spirit and it's just a manifestation that's coming out over time he says it's hid to the unbeliever by tradition see what I mean but it's all in Christ all that God was he emptied himself kenos and came into Christ he says and we into Christ are behind the veil what we're behind the veil that hides Christ that hides God we're in the veil if you're behind the veil that means that the world is looking at the veil and you're inside of it amen so they're seeing a veil of flesh but you're inside there and it's Christ in you amen how did Paul say we get into that how do we get inside the veil by one Spirit by one Spirit we get in there it's the new birth that gets us in there and nothing else amen God bless you let's stand this evening it always amazes me and I know I've said this many times how when Christ died and there was that that great earthquake and the the veil to the holy of holies was torn from top to bottom showing it was an act of God not an act of man and the shikina glory of God left and the the the the rod of Aaron stopped budding and the Mana that had stayed fresh for 1600 years whatever it was went moldy and yet those priests continued to go in there and worship and bring blood knowing that the presence of God had left and it had moved someplace else why because they missed the veil of the man Jesus Christ and so they could not come in and go up on the day of Pentecost and receive him the same way amen we've got one more service ahead of this on godhead as far as I can tell just on the way I'm being led and the way I'm studying and then we'll kind of get back to our more traditional not more traditional but kind of the direction we were heading on this this idea of the token life and what it means to have the Holy Spirit and how we know we have it and what it does in our lives and that but I just felt to drop this in and I know some of it's pretty heavy but I wanted to go through this teaching it's been on my mind and on my heart for a long time and so I really felt that this was the time to do it so I'm trusting you have a better understanding I hope I haven't made it more uh more difficult than it needs to be and and as I said at the beginning of this I cannot understand all of God I don't profess to understand all things of God by any means amen but I'm hoping you can see that the revealing of God is just God changing his form time and time again that's the Simplicity of what the godhead is it's not people it's not three persons it's not these things it's just God changing his form his appearance and you're a part of it amen and you're a part of it and that's the most wonderful thing I think we could have is that we could become a part of God not because we weren't but because we were always a part of him by the word of God and His Thoughts amen God bless you let's buy our heads Heavenly Father Lord what a wonderful thing it is to think that you came down and you dwelt Lord in flesh and we could handle you and we could hear you Lord not us personally Lord but Fallen Humanity could come down you could come down to and they could they could interact with Elohim Lord the self-existing one Lord and yet they missed it completely so many of them but Lord we're in another time and in another season Lord and you're revealing yourself Lord not just in a body Lord but in a body of a bride Lord that you are the head of and I pray Lord that we're not missing it these days Lord that we're not making that holy spirit inside of us some different part of you or just Lord some some element or some portion Lord but that it could be a revelation that it is you yourself the very person of God living and dwelling through each and every one of us Lord God lord we need a greater revelation of that this evening Lord I need it I know Lord I pray that as we've gone through this Lord that there's been Clarity Lord and if there's not Lord I pray that you would clear it up Lord that you would just help us to see ourselves in our word Lord not just Lord Place it outside of us Lord but that it would be a very part of us Lord that our eyes would be open Lord and we'd see ourselves in you through the word Lord bless our people Lord bless each one that's here Lord there's many needs Lord many needs thinking again of Young Noah Lord sister Beverly and
