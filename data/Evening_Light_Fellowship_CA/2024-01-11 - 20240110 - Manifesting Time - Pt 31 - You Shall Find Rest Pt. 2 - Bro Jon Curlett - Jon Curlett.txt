Jesus Lord we're coming in with thankful hearts Lord we've come in and we worshiped you and lifted Your Name Lord and we want to thank you every day for your goodness and Grace for your provision Vision your blessing Lord that we have a sound mind Lord that we have hearts that cry unto you Lord that eyes that see you Lord ears to hear you Lord we've come in once again this night just to come a little bit closer Lord Lift us up a little higher we pray Lord settle our hearts settle our souls on you Lord may your word just be Lord written a little deeper into our hearts Lord Lord may we just Trust You Lord may we believe you may our faith be expressed in our lives day by day in a greater way Lord we're looking for a rapturing Faith Lord we're not just looking for a saving Faith Lord but we're looking for a lifechanging rapturing faith that'll take us out of this pest house and take us into a glorified body and Lord to do that we know you're going to conquer every bit that holds us back lord there will be nothing left when we're done lord it's just a body change that we need Lord so I pray you give us Victory this evening Lord help us to yield help us to Humble help us to just trust and believe Lord your word and let it do its work in our life we pray Lord may we yield to your Holy Spirit we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Joshua 21 Joshua 21 and certainly glad to have sister Rebecca back with us and sister J Justine's not here but they both made it back safely from their trip abroad and so we're glad to see that and then we have sister Priscilla and brother Joe heading out early early tomorrow morning so we want to certainly remember remember them as they leave us for 5 weeks and just trusting God's grace that he'll bless them and make them a blessing amen everywhere we go it's good to give and it's good to get amen so trusting the Lord will bless them as they spend some time with her family down there spoke with brother Grant on Sunday evening I believe and he let me know that his manager and his and uh that man's wife and child will be in service on Sunday so we want to remember that service in particular knowing that there's going to be people coming in gives me an opportunity to maybe study a different way so just praying that God would speak to them amen not everyone that comes in is of it amen not everyone that hears the word is it but we're a small group and a small place and I'm just trusting that as we witness to people and as we're lights to people that we get new Souls amen that we get new converts that it's not just us for and no more and ones that are the original group here and that but that that the Lord will bring in Lost Souls amen and I know many of us have had many opportunities Selena was talking the other day and she had an appointment and she talked with this woman for an hour and a half and she said I don't know what happened I don't know how we got there and I said I had specifically prayed for her and sister Justine and our young people that they would be Witnesses and all of a sudden the opportunity presents itself and so I believe it's for the young people it's for the middle-aged it's for the old wherever we go amen we're supposed to be a witness and a testimony I believe if we've got a heart that wants to bring souls to Christ then he'll give us opportunities to do exactly that amen so just trusting God to be with us each one as they go each one as they come in that the Lord will sort it out amen we put those things in his hand and just trust if if nothing else that he'll save a soul amen amen Joshua 21 and beautiful portion of scripture here 21 and 43 says and the lord gave unto Israel all the land which he swear to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he swear unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the Lord delivered all all their enemies into their hands you notice God's the only one that can do superlatives absolutes every all never that's what God does he deals with absolutes and he's saying here everything that I said I've given you it says he delivered all their enemies into their hand there failed not ought that means there not a single thing failed of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel all came to pass amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing on this thought in our series on manifesting time and I'm taking a second service on this thought of you shall find rest and there's a lot to cover here and I know we'll get through what we have today because I'm not going to be too long by God's grace but I I I want to maybe step into the Practical a little bit this this afternoon and this evening and you know me it's uh you know like like like the saying is we don't want to be so spiritual we're of no earthly good and sometimes we read the Bible and everything's for the future future and everything's for when we get on the other side and everything's for this and for that and all of a sudden we've got no victory in our life amen but I want to bring it right down where we live but I want to start with I what I consider to be a supernatural quote and it's the last thing that we read in our in our service on Sunday brother Bram said this he says it's written over in St John about the 15th chapter if you abide in me and my word in you see the word abides in you see then ask what you will and it'll be done because it's not you it's the word that's in you that takes takes all the pressure off of us that all we have to do is get into the word and the word has to get into us and that's what settles the situation we don't have to come up with some big theology some big idea but rather we have to let him do something inside of us and then he takes care of everything from that point on he says the word is God see it's God in you God's the word because in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he says now in the return of the Holy Spirit bringing the word in us and abiding in there abiding in there staying in there once you're sealed it's a finished work and he never leaves you can't lose it he can't take it back it's his certification on our soul it seals us to the day of our Redemption it says and it abiding in there then it's not you that speaks it's the word itself coming out so it the word will perform the work and there's a great rest that we have and it's not in who we are it's not in our skills our gifts our min Ministries our callings it's not our strength it's not our family name our Good Deeds none of these are where our rest is as we covered last service just doing a a quick summary here amen it's not when we have money in the bank and clothes on our back and and we've got Health in our bodies that's not our rest but our rest is that there's something greater that's come that overrides all of those things amen that we have one who watches over us who's who who stays closer than a brother he's greater than us he's our peace he's our rest he's the accepted one he's the powerful one as we read last last service he has all the attributes that we need and so our rest is in him not in ourselves because we ha we need what he has and no matter how much I have of what he has he has more than I do in my natural I might have intelligence I might have discipline I might have strength but compared to God I have nothing and so we're looking to him to come into our lives and bring us into into what we have need of amen and I believe any real believer has learned already that we have is what we have is Never Enough in in ourselves amen there comes up time and that's usually what happens is we say I've tried hard enough and I'm going to let God start doing it and all of a sudden things start to happen because we've taken our hands off the whe amen and where do we find that we find our rest in the word of God brother Brandon we read that quote he says our rest is right here our rest is what God has said because what God says has to come to pass God's immutable he doesn't change his nature doesn't change his word doesn't change his ways don't change and so our rest is first and foremost in that and it tells us who we are it tells us what we are tells us where came from tells us where we're going tells us how we're going to get there and it tells us everything he's given us to make that Journey safely all the way through to Eternity amen this word has everything we need but it's only a letter right here that's where our faith rests initially but there's a rest that has to come and where does it comes it comes the first time when God makes his word real in your life where you take his promise and you step on it and you you stand on it and you believe on it and you apply it and you wait on it and then God does it and that's when you get rest there's a labor there's a battle there to hold fast and see the salvation of God see his word come to pass and then when he's done it then you have this wonderful rest and you're like it's true he's real he cares about me he he he stands behind his word he doesn't leave us hanging though he terries yet he'll come through the word will come to pass in our lives amen and so that's only for the one situation and maybe you you you you had a financial need maybe you needed a job maybe you you had a loved one that that needed salvation and you've waited and you've waited and you've you've held your peace and you've done everything you can and then it happens but that's just one situation what happens the next day another situation pops up and now you got a financial need now you got a health need now you've got a relationship need now you got a church need now whatever it might be put yourself there and what do you got to do you got to go back in the word because you believed it once and it worked and you go back and you find your place again and say Here's the answer to my need and you stay there and what is it you fight to rest until he brings it to pass and then when he brings it to pass now you've got a refreshing his word is still the same he's still the same he still he still backs his promise up and really what it's doing is God building you up in the faith little by little here little there a little precept upon precept and he's getting you to believe bigger and bigger things the first things are for you and it's for your salvation and that's a supernatural event and you can't see it you know something's changed but then he starts to work in the natural doesn't he and now he starts to work on healing and he starts to work on the people around you and then he starts to use you for other people and now you have faith not just for yourself but others and there's a rest that God's going to do a work in them the same way he did a work inside of you so the rest is the first time he does it and we said last time that it's the Dynamics of the word that gives you rest it's when the word becomes a reality when the Holy Spirit quickens and makes it live inside of your life and then the refreshing is when he keeps doing it and he keeps quickening the word to you and he keeps fulfilling it and manifesting it in your life brother B says it this way he says what do you have to do what's your job it's in your title believer he says believe hear Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word but it doesn't stop there he says hearing and then he says and believing and applying and resting you hear it you believe it you apply it and then you rest amen that's our part believe apply and rest he says you see it the word says so hear it your heart says so believe it he says and your whole being rests in it it's finished amen if it's will in your heart and you really believe it then your whole being can now be brought subject to Faith because that's what's coming out of your soul that's what's coming out of your heart and it brings your spirit realm into subjection and then it'll bring your body into subjection he says and solemnly the believer must rest his faith upon God's word and faith cannot find its resting place upon the shifting Sands of man's theology it's God to take its every stand church if there's a hill to die on it's the word of God not your emotions not your opinions not what your family thinks not what your boss thinks not how bad your financial situation is not how bad your health is you stand on God's word every time he says it's got to take its every stand on the unmoving able Rock of God's Eternal Word God said so that settles it and if he's God he has to keep his word if he doesn't keep his word catch this then he isn't God now that's not true is it that can never be true he says or this isn't his word sometimes we die on a hill because it's not his word and it doesn't happen and we say what happened you didn't catch it the way he meant it or your motive and your objective wasn't quite right but God never fails and his word never fails amen so this rest this refreshing is when the words made alive and our mechanics are our faith and our belief and our Doctrine and what we know in these things we believe what it says but the Dynamics is when it's alive when it becomes real to us when it's made manifest and it's the working of the holy spirit in each and every one of our Lives amen it's when the word becomes alive in us when it becomes alive in you when it becomes alive in me and it's a Living Word not just a letter word letter word kills and what happens is people go to war on the letter word because they don't have the Living Word am me the Living Word will help you remember what Jesus said after the first or second admonition Walk Away We ought not to have running feuds with people with brothers and sisters or churches or Ministries if there's not agreement just walk away and if you're wrong God will correct you and if they're wrong God will correct them but we ought not to beat each other up over these things amen but when we talking about Dynamics it means that reading the Bible is not enough you've got to do it you've got to understand amen coming to church and hearing preaching is good but it's not enough that's the start but it's not the Finish we can sit here and listen to me preach all day till I'm blue in the face and it'll produce nothing but a mess if that's where it ends amen we've got to move beyond the preaching of the word otherwise it causes separation and Discord and clicks and we've seen all these things because man gets involved and we twist things up amen but what it means is we've got to have that face-to-face experience that brother Bram talked about in the last service amen where we know that God is real that we've met him face to face that know he's called us he's put our name in the Lamb's Book of Life and he's placed us on the road to Eternity and he sealed us with the Holy Ghost that's what we need to have each and every one amen we've got to come to the place where we say I know my God is real I know his word is true I know he backs it up and I know that I can rest on it because it's a never failing word and he's a never failing God Amen and we've got to get into the presence of God for that to happen as we we talked about last service and that's why we come to church many times because if I have his presence in my life by the Holy Spirit and you bring it and we all come together instead of one bit of fire we got a lot of fire and that creates an atmosphere for birth that creates an atmosphere for the supernatural to happen amen it brings God on the scene as we come in here and we invite him here we're not coming to he brother John we're coming here for the Lord to speak however he would speak it may be through brother Bob or brother Josh song leading and God can touch you through a song somebody can sing an anointed special and it brings healing it brings restitution it brings rest all of these things or it can come through the preaching of the word or sometimes it's just in the Simplicity of a prayer that comes over this Pulpit but it's God that we come here to see it's God that we come to hear amen it's not brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith amen his presence is what makes the difference here and if he's not here all we've got is a denomination all we've got dead religion all we've got is a church and that's not going to take us anywhere amen we come here to experience his presence remember I read that quote a few Services ago where brother Bram says I only come to church for one reason and that's to be in his presence that's the only thing that matters brother bam he's speaking here of the holy of holies where the Ark of the Covenant was and he's saying notice in this place there they brought Aaron's rod and they laid it there one night one night one experience with the Living God will change us church he says and think that same Rob what did it do in one night it budded it blossomed and yielded almonds in the same night it's a dead stick separated we've been separated from God haven't we we were separated by sin we were separated from unbelief we were separated by ignorance but as soon as we get joined back to that vine what happens life comes in and life yields fruit amen the fruits of the Holy Spirit have to be inside of our lives he says in one night a dead stick in the presence of God it budded so it brought forth the little bits of leaves the leaves opened up it blossomed and then it brought forth fruit in one single night 12 hours it says what was it it must have come off an almond tree and there's a many almond tree are staff tonight but the only thing of it is as long as you're outside of this hidden life you'll never be able to be refreshed and bring forth the fruits that God intended you to do until you come into the presence of God that's what it takes it takes a personal entrance into the presence of God he says look at it the budding we can get there we go the first thing we find out what makes trees bud it's a refreshment what makes the refreshing he says early of a morning you go out of an early morning and you find out after the night that everything gets still and then the Dew Falls and it brings a refreshing and the trouble of it is today the people don't have time to get before God and get still they've got so many things to do now catch this they belong to this they got to do this they got to have this and they got to go there he says you don't have time the Devils just took up all your time you don't have time to get still before God and get quiet church if we are so busy we don't have time for God that means we're not busy with what God wants us to do I can't say it any planer amen if you don't have time for God then you can't be doing God's will because the first thing he seeks is relationship and fellowship with you it's not works it's time oneon-one amen I don't want my wife to just clean the house I want to spend one-on-one time with her I want to have quiet time I want to have quality time with her amen otherwise it's a business transaction it's a business relationship and that's not what marriage is I can hire somebody to do that but I marry somebody for the relationship and that's what he wants from us brother R says there's four things that tie us up and take away our rest he says belong to something you know what happens when you belong to something other people put their expectations on you and that's not always a bad thing but if you're bound by other people's expectations it'll take you to a place God doesn't expect you to be then he says you've got to do something and my question is this says who who says you got to do anything if the word says it that's fine but if somebody else is telling me I got to do this and I got to be here and do that says who as brother Joe's been telling me you're not my boss right so often what we let is ourselves get L around by the nose by other people's opinions on what we're supposed to be doing I remember way back when and forgive me I don't mean to bring humor over the pulpit but remember there was there was this lady and she was talking about the bed checking police and we act as if everything has to be perfect all the time including our beds being made at all times lest somebody realize we didn't make our bed today what does it matter if we don't make our bed today sisters is there a Bed checking police squad going house to house checking if we made our bed today did we vacuum our floors did we did we clean the counters is everything perfect no it doesn't matter at the end of the day whether we make our bed it's a matter of Pride it's a matter of Good Housekeeping I understand that but in the end ain't no bed checking police coming into our house if you I I I if you don't make your bed and you spend some time with God in its place that's a good trade-off what is it we put these expectations on oursel of perfection and everywhere else and yet somehow we don't expect perfection in terms of our relationship with God and our time with God how twisted do we get this is the subtlety of of Satan is he gets us so bound up in what we belong to we've got to do something he says we've got to have something says who is it a need or is it a want sometimes we're so focused on getting something that we don't realize that we're missing the very thing that we have that we ought to have or it's available to us right now I've always told my wife I said when I'm looking to buy something big it's because my relationship with God has cooled off you know why cuz I'm seeking satisfaction and guess what whether I buy the car whether I buy the gun whether I buy the hockey stick whatever it might be that's just a placebo because I'm not close to God and I've told her I've told her that I said when you look at me looking at Big purchases it means that something's cooled off when I'm pushing for it I'm always looking because I'm always looking for deals but when I'm pushing for it it usually means that I've lost my satisfaction somewhere else but we can get to the point where we're so interested in what we're got to get that we've forgotten what we're supposed to have at all times amen what really matters amen this is the age of materialism absolutely everybody wants the latest thing and people are are are driving themselves into debt to have things that they don't actually need we need to ask ourselves do we need it or do we want it then he says we've got to go somewhere always going never stopping go go go go go and I've got a quote for you on people that always go amen but this is something that the Lord's had to work with me on even being a pastor I've got a full-time job and I've got a full-time job and you know what I've had to let go of things at work and I've got to let go of things as a pastor because I've I've got to realize that I don't have to do everything for everybody I might be capable of doing everything that that people ask but that doesn't mean I have to do it sometimes people are perfectly capable of doing it themselves and sometimes they need to do it themselves so they can learn and mature and grow but then we've got deacons and trustees and able-bodied people all over this church that can help relieve the burden from for certain things and God's helping me to really taper that down because I've got to have time for my family I've got to have time for this church I've got to have time to study and all these different things and something has to give sometimes and I've got to be able to say I don't have to do go everywhere and be all things to all people amen and neither do you neither do you amen sisters if you're married your husband is the one that gives you direction for dayto day and his expectations are the only ones that matter amen that's it you don't have to be driven by what everyone else do does and how good they are and how clean their house is and how how great a meal they cook every day your husband is the only one you're there to satisfy and nobody else matters and if they're injecting what they think get your husband to have a chat with them because that's what he's there to do as well amen settle things down back people off a little bit amen but if you never stop you'll never find rest is the point brother I'm saying Satan keeps us moving all the time so that we won't sit still and give God the time that he has amen if everything is all ahead of us and we're go go go we're never going to find rest we're getting some practicality here this evening brother Bram says this he says remember after all you're a nature and after all nature gets quiet and still then the de begins to fall and that refreshes and brings forth life he says and you are a nature yourself and when you get quiet and still before God then the dues of Heaven begins to fall and it begins to refresh he says did you ever go out of a morning after the night has passed early of a morning also at blossoms to give fragrance do you ever go early of a morning to that fragrance and you find out that early of a morning when you get out the Dew is hanging low the trees are budding the blossoms are coming off see we want it all Supernatural because if we do it all Supernatural it takes every bit of responsibility off of us and brother B's coming here and he's saying listen you got a part to play you've got to get quiet you've got to give the time you've got to take a deep breath you know when we go hunting we're up early in the morning and the perfect time of day is early in the morning because almost nobody's up everything's still everything's sleeping everything's quiet and it's such a peace that's there you notice David never said I get up early I I stay up late at night he says I get up early in the morning the morning's the time the morning's the time refreshing at night you're tired you're worn out you're not as focused but early in the morning that's when you can give God some real time he says go along the road and smell the honeysuckle into the Rose Garden of an early morning that's why it's been quiet Nature has through the night it got quiet and God bathed it with refreshing that's what you need to do is get away and get quiet before God so he can bathe you with the refreshment from Heaven amen he says Get Alone to yourself close the doors pull them together and say now Lord here I am in your presence we need refreshing every every day cuz there's a battle every single day every single day when brother Dwayne was here it was so instructive for me because usually when I do first thing in the morning as I pick up my phone I SN my watch to find out how much rest I got I'd be able to tell but I would syn up my my bit and I'd look at that then I read any texts or anything like that and I get squared away and then I go down and have devotions and he said the first moment of your day ought to be for God thank him for breath that You' got in the morning ask him for leadership and guidance for your day and lay your day before him amen not get up cram some food down your throat and rush out the door to work not not get into things with your kids if your kids get up you have to get up before them that's the way to do it get up and give him that time it may only be 5 10 15 minutes before those little Peet feet come pattering to your door and you got to give it up but that first moment is so key because that's the chance for you to get settled for your day and let him just kind of refresh you you hopefully you've gotten some sleep hopefully you got a break hopefully you're relaxed and he can come in he can just do something for you amen we've got to just sometimes we just need to stop planning stop moving and just say Lord I'm putting things in your hands for the day I'm trusting you to work this out I'm trusting you to sort it out I'm trusting you to bring me what I need and just get in there and say you know turn off the phone turn off the phone lock the door if the kids are up say leave mommy or dadd alone my kids know if I'm downstairs in the morning they don't come in unless that door is open if they have to go in they knock first because Daddy's having devotions and you don't walk in when daddy's having devotions and we've got to have that we've got to say let me be for a bit and set that time aside and you know what if we can't get up early it means we need to go to bed a little earlier too we don't have to stay up till midnight my wife and I we've had to do this cuzz what happened is I'd study till late then I'd come to bed it'd be 10:30 and you're trying to unwind and so you're another 30 minutes or an hour before you actually go to sleep and then you're trying to get up early and it doesn't work so you know what she said she said John you got to be done by 9:30 so we can be lights out by 10:30 so we can get a good night's sleep and we can get up at the time we're supposed to instead of having this up and down thing where we're tired one morning and we're okay the next and this and that the other thing it gives us stability it allows us to start our day right if you finish it right you can start it right Church we're real practical here this evening for a first little bit amen but look at this portion because Jesus was practical you know what I love I love Jesus he covers the whole Spectrum down down right right where we live to the absolute Supernatural in our lives and he expressed every single bit of it but look at this scripture amen this in Mark 31 and he said unto them he's speaking to the disciples Come Ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while what's in the desert nothing that was the point nothing's in the desert let's go someplace where there's nobody there's nothing he says for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat they didn't even have time to eat and Jesus said listen we're servants we know your servants your disciples you're here for the people you're here to do a work but listen the spirit's willing but the flesh is weak and you've got to make an account for the flesh cuz if you destroy the flesh I don't care how good your spirit is you're not going to have strength to do it so he says you got to come aside and rest a while you've got to do it he forced him to do it he didn't say hey if you want to let's take a break he said take a break you've got to do it you haven't had a break you've been working yourselves too hard amen this is Christ this is God in flesh church this is as much the word as anything else we've read and he says take some time aside take a break settle down a bit amen you know I was listening to the brother's talk about when you guys kind of did the the uh the remodel of the old church building and some of you were working a full day and then you were driving in and you were working into the evening and you come home late at night and that's okay for a season cuz there's a season for those things but all day every day that's not God's will it's never been God's Will and we see it here you can do it for a while but you've got to come aside and take a break listen the prophet of God experienced it early in his ministry remember he had the gift of discernment in his hand remember and the people would come up and they touch him and he get all the dots over his hand he'd tell them what was wrong but every time he did it he got weaker and weaker and weaker but he had a heart for the people he had a he had a servant's heart he wanted to do it there were times where he would stay on the platform for a week a week straight and he would eat his meals on the platform he'd lay down on the side for a bit and then he'd get up and he' continue praying and you know what happened he got sick he got bad sick he got so sick he couldn't Minister for months why because he wore himself out and then so somebody with some common sense said brother brandom you can't kill yourself doing this otherwise you're of no good to the people and so what happened was they had his managers there and when they saw him getting weak they would take him they'd tap him they'd say time's up and they'd remove him from the platform for his sake for his sake pull him aside amen exhaustion is not God's will God doesn't run us into the ground day in and day out that's not it that's not the way he does it amen we live a life of service yes we're we're we're serving our families we're serving our neighbors our communities all these different things but God doesn't seek to run us into the ground we have hard times but it's not exhaustion because of all the goings and comings that's not his will so as a Believers we need to stop and consider are we tired because of needs or because of wants is it because of contentment or is it ambition that's driving us we can we can set our sights on something and we can drive ourselves we can we can run ourselves into Oblivion total exhaustion trying to get something and the question is does God want it for us does God really want it for us or is it us that wants it for us amen and then we have the expectations versus the reality what really matters or what are people putting on us or what are we putting on ourselves you get high performance driven individuals we'll put things on ourselves that nobody else will and it's not God it's not God it's not the way he operates amen you know I was talking with the deacons and trustees over the last week and and over the last few months and then certain things come up and I tell the brothers that sounds like a deacon problem that sounds like a trustee problem why because they've got an area that they're supposed to handle in the church and what do they do they're letting me know and I say keep me in the loop but it's all yours that's literally why we have deacons is to take the burden off of the ministry and the trustees are there to take the burden off of the ministry I told brother Mark I said why would I want to do what you're doing it's just more work more stress and it doesn't matter a single Lick in my Ministry it doesn't matter money doesn't matter me being a minister adds no value to handling the money which is why we let a treasurer do it why we let the trustees manage these things in general I'm aware of what goes on I have say over the ties but I hand that over to them and they manage it for me and I get a I get a report every month and I love that I love that because he knows exactly what I need and I get it every month and I don't have to worry about it and I don't worry about it I don't sit there struggling are we going to make it are we going to do it no they take care of every little bit of it and all I'm doing is keeping tabs on it one day for about 5 or 10 minutes a month that's all I have to give to finances because we've got people to take the burden now sometimes we look around and people are in a a stage of life and they're in a phase and they need help and so we'll put ourselves out for their sake because we see that they need help but that's only for a season and then God will bring them up to speed and they'll be able to step in and do their own thing amen amen but it's not that we can't do things it's that we don't always have to do things and we've got to be able to discern that we've got to have leadership for that you know when I was studying this I was thinking and I was reminded of Elijah you know he had that great Mount Carmel Victory where he goes up and he challenges the the people and he says you know if God is God then let him prove himself and the real God proved and he he he burned the sacrifice and he burned the Altar and he destroyed it all and then Elijah went and he he he killed the the prophets of Baal then he had this great Victory and then right afterwards what happens I is Jezebel says I'm going to make you just like the prophets dead and he takes off running and he goes off into the Wilderness for a day and he just crumbles after such a great Victory after seeing God vindicate Reigns back in the land everything should be right and all of a sudden he's running from the from the threat of his life from a woman and and he just crumbles the prophet of God he crumbles and look at what the scripture says about him it says and he himself went a Day's Journey Into the Wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough in other words I've had enough he says now oh Lord take away my life for I am not better than my fathers Elijah's done he's had enough he's done everything God asked him to do now he's running once again for his life he's sick and tired of hiding and running nobody likes him everybody hates him might as well eat worms he's had it he's done amen he's tired of not being appreciated and he just wants to end it all he just wants to end it all have you ever hit the end of the road seems like no matter what you do it doesn't make a difference you work and you work and you work and the bank account balance doesn't change except it goes down right you put your heart you put your soul into something and you're no further ahead and it seems like you're not making Headway you do things for people day in and day out and day in and day out and all you get is what no thanks and no appreciation in fact you get criticism for the work you do yeah we all face that at some time don't we you empty out every day nobody seems to fill you up remember Elijah said is it just me he got to the point where he thought I'm the only one that's even serving God anymore and we can get that way as Believers amen as Believers we're servants you know brother baham said eternal life is living for others but sometimes we act like eternal life is earned by living for others rather than it's the expression of eternal life and we give and we give and we give and we give and we burn ourselves out and it's not God that's telling us to do that amen you know the scripture tells us to Bear one another's burdens and then says for every man to bear his own burden and you say how does that work if you look look at the one that says every man bear his own burden that's the dayto day in other words I'm not supposed to Bear brother Bob's burdens dayto day the the the day-to-day things that he deals with and finances and these these these these these things that we all deal with but then it says bear one another's burdens that's the big stuff that's when hard times hit that's when people really need that hand that help that shoulder to the wheel to help them get through that's what they're for but dayto day we're to carry our own burdens to the Lord amen that's because we're supposed to be yolked to him not to each other so the dayto day is with that with him and then the the extras that's where he gives us Believers to help carry that load and provide that support for us when we really really read it really really need it but Elijah here and he's worn out he's depressed to the point where he just wants to die now I won't ask for a show of hands but I've dealt with depression and you know what the thing is about depression is you get to the point where you've you don't even understand why you are where you are you just are and somebody telling you you just need to snap out of it it doesn't do do you any good cuz you don't even understand why you're there and sometimes you don't even understand you are there until you finally come out of it and then you realize I was depressed because you've gotten so used to being so down in the dumps and that depression just so overwhelms you that you don't nothing nothing nothing matters anymore life isn't doesn't doesn't feel like anything food becomes tasteless nothing brings you Joy and you're just a lump I've been there I got the T-shirt to prove it it's a hard place to be and so often what happens is we drive ourselves into it we overwork ourselves we overextend ourselves and it doesn't go the way we think it goes and then all of a sudden we just like Elijah we just crater we crumble that's not where God wants us to be amen and he's there to take us out of it God won't leave us there anden there's an answer for that and I'm a testimony for that but brother brand he he he he takes us into this scripture here and the whole thing that happens and I didn't put it there for the sake of time but he says he says he sent an angel Elijah says I just want to die it says and he sent an Angel and the angel touched him and he went to sleep so catch both sides of this now the angel puts him to sleep first and gives him rest and when he woke up there were some kind of cakes baked laying on the side of him and he said Elijah rise up and eat he says there's the grace of God to his servant see he's resting him it's not just the food but it's the rest we can give you all the food you can take up here but sometimes you got to rest and let it let it go to work in your life a bit and me just settle down and so God knows what's coming for Elijah he knows how worn out he is and he also knows what's ahead of him so he lays him down there and he rests him and then he wakes him up and then he feeds him and then he rests him and then he wakes him up and feeds them and then he rests them and then he feeds them again three times he does it because he knows he's about to take a journey and he says it's the grace of God to his servant to give him this break and in this experience with this this food and this rest that God gave Elijah he went 40 days journey without anything else when God comes in and gives rest amen but he got his servant to settle down take a break rest relax a little bit he says you know Jesus said come aside Into the Wilderness and rest a little while and some of these guys that think you don't have to rest we find out that they burn out pretty quick too if they don't take rest they find themselves wrecked up somewhere now watch who he's talking to we can apply it in the natural we can apply it in ministries wherever we want he says I think that's where our brother Billy Graham is tonight trying to overshoot the mark he says these human bodies are strong but they need rest he says then you can take a little rest and you go somewhere and they'll criticize you and say I thought he was a preacher look at him out yonder on the bank fishing or something like that he says but that doesn't matter Jehovah will take care of his own brother Adam wanted to go out into the Wilderness he says there's no Spirits out there and he could rest and relax and that's why he go hunting and he go fishing and these things was that his Spirit could rest not just his body but his Spirit his mind could just settle down and just not do anything for a while and just be out in nature where there was cleanliness and and just things that were good for him amen you know when I was in BC and I had a great job best pain job I ever had and I had that horrible coworker and the stress was driving me nuts my blood pressure was going up up up up up and I was starting to get Snappy at home and these different things and finally I decided I was going to quit cuz it wasn't worth it and so I told my wife I'm going to quit and she's like thank God best paying job we ever had thank God you're quitting I said I'd like to take a month off she said I think that's a good idea in fact take two and so I did well I I tried to and then I got recruited and I ended up I got one and a half days of hunting I I went over and I took took brother Jonah M's Services cuz he wanted to go hunting but the point is is that she had my back she realized I needed to just lay it down and just recover for a little bit and it's okay to do that brother Bram says he says you'll look at a preacher and he he goes off and and he goes off and he takes a break and you say I thought you were a preacher yes but these bodies need rest amen these bodies need a break and I don't care what role you're in whether it's Ministry whether it's a husband a wife spouse whatever it is we've got to take our breaks and it's okay to take a break it's okay to not clean the house one day it's okay to just bring in Little Caesars for supper from time to time it's okay to just mail it in and say it's okay cuz it ain't the end of the world this is the end of the world but us not making our beds or cleaning our house or eating a healthy meal for once is not the end of the world we put so much pressure sometimes we get gunshi do you know what gunshi is gunshi is for hunting dogs what happens is some of them are they're just that way some of them have a bad experience but what happens is they're scared of guns they're scared of the sight of guns and they're scared of the sound of guns now I don't know if you you realize this but hunting dogs are no good if they don't like guns because guns are going off all over and they're using them to find and retrieve animals that are hunting amen so at some point that dog might have had a bad experience or they' just got something built into them they can't bring themselves to do what they're supposed to do and sometimes as Believers we get that way we get hurt we get offended we get burned by a Believer and now we can't fellowship or get close to Believers because we think the same thing might happen again and we've had we we you have people that will that are handled roughly and sometimes we're not handled roughly we think we're handled roughly and honestly it doesn't make a difference our feelings dominate in those things and so they're worried that if they do that again then this thing's going to happen or that amen and next thing you know we're cutting ourselves off from people and we're cutting ourselves off from fellowship and church and Believers and relationships and we can get into a place where we're bound up and we can't rest even at church amen what is it we forget we're a child of God and we start thinking we're something else amen we belong to him he's our father he's our protector he's our guide amen he's our refuge brother Brown would talk about people that get just so so bound up and this is in the message letting off the pressure he says and we get to a place where everything's just all crusted up he says oh little eaglet maybe some little girl some little boy maybe some old person or middle-age why are you here this morning because he says you're really an eagle they'll come and they'll sit in the church but they're not getting what they need but he says you're here why because you're an eagle you know you should be here you know there's something here for you but you're not getting it he says but maybe the cares of life has kind of battled you around roughly you've lost sight you're not sure no more where you're placing your foot he says let's just come up against The Rock now and says oh lead me to the Rock that's higher than I let me lay on this rock cuz he's a shelter in the time of storm remember brother B and this is what he's talking about here of the Eagles and they go through that refreshing stage where they come to a certain age he says and then their beaks get all crusted over and their claws get all kinds of sores in them and they lose their feathers they can't fly they can't hunt they can't eat they can't do all these things and they just stay in a place and somebody else has to come and feed them for a while cuz they're not in a condition to do it they're going through a refreshing they're going through a Reviving but they've got to go through a death of sorts before they can get new life he says start beating against this door right now beating against the door of this rock it says he'll open up the crust will fly off we get these sores we get these hurts these offenses all over us and it pulls us away from arrest we're supposed to have he he says then the pressure will leave you and you can be at rest again the pressure all gone you can come to church no matter what the pastor preaches about people leave church because of what pastors say even if it's the truth even if it's the word and even if it's said the right way why because they've got crusts they've got offenses they've got areas of their life that are sensitive and it causes them to pull away he says as long as he stays in that word of God it'll never condemn you you've done Rec in there and you're all right now we've had people in this church maybe some of you know them that got beat up by Ministries and just for them to sit in this building and listen to this ministry is nothing less than a miracle they've been beat up they've been indoctrinated they finally came out of it and they've almost said I'll never go back to one again and they don't trust Ministry and they don't trust church people and they don't trust organization of any sort and they just want to stay home and do their own thing but then they'll come through the these doors and God will touch them but we've got to treat those people very very gently you can say well they've been in the message for 20 30 40 10 years whatever it is they ought to know these things no they're in a stage of coming through a change and they've got these crusts and they've got these hurts and these offenses and we've got to be gentle with them we can't force them you can't force someone to grow in Christ you can't force someone to take the fullness of the word you can't force Trust that's the greatest way to cause distrust is to try and force trusten we can't do those things we got to give them room to heal we got to love them be gracious be patient listen we've got new converts that come in we can't force them to grow God has to do it in his time his season his way amen we can't force we can't say well when I came into the the message or when I gave my heart to the Lord I did this and this and this well that's great for you praise the Lord but that may not be the way that they go and we've got to be gracious with these sorts of people amen we've got to let God work on them and not force our our path or our standard or our timelines on them I think it was brother Barry coffee talked about this woman and she had a real bad experience she really got worked over by a Ministry and she was out of church and she was worried about coming back to church cuz she didn't want to get hurt again and he said sister just come to church sit at the very back don't do anything just listen to the word and let the word work let the word wash he says don't try anything don't try to do anything don't try and be anything he says just sit there and listen to the word and let the word do the work that's the same thing we have to do every day for every one of us let the word do the work because if I can force you into it somebody else can force you out of it amen I'm not giving you rest you've got to find your rest in the word and when you take it and you believe it yourself sovereignly then that's the work that God will keep in your life if I force it or some other brother or sister does it it won't stick amen we don't have to push people now I'm sorry I've spent 50 minutes being practical this evening but I felt to just Dro that in amen there's a portion that's up to us to to get still to give time and question why we're so busy because he says otherwise we're going to end up broken up somewhere right and then like I said at the start we can't be so spiritual that we're of no earthly good and we can get to the place where we put ourselves and it's Pride honestly that does it sometimes Duty mostly Pride I think that we put ourselves to such a high standard of living and acting and being and doing that we forget that we're supposed to be led by the spirit not led by just what we see needs to be done there's a body for a reason it's to share the load it's to spread the load man I I I'm blessed with this church I believe because it's not just one or two people here doing the work we've got a full body ministry here where everybody's doing something and I praise the Lord for that because it means that no one person has to carry the load all the time but I want to take us back for the last few minutes of this service here and I won't be long on this thought of you shall find rest and what we read here in Joshua 21 and he says and the lord gave unto Israel all the land which he swear to give so what he gave by his word he gave him reality every single of it he says unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein and the lord gave them rest round about according to what all that he swore to their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the Lord delivered all their enemies into their hand there failed not ought of any good thing which the Lord had spoken unto the house of Israel all came to pass now that's a backward looking statement it's a back backward looking scripture from when they're at the end they've taken Canaan there's rest in the land there's peace in the land but the promise was given 440 years 430 plus 40 no the 480 years before that 480 years God gave the promise and now they have a scripture and it's God saying I did everything I told you I was going to do nothing I told you hasn't come to pass every single bit that I've told you has come to pass this is where ourr is supposed to be church that he does what he says amen God told it to Abraham Abraham told it to Isaac God confirmed it to Isaac God confirmed him to Jacob and then now they're sitting here and they've got family after family they're Generations deep into this now and it's far far far away 10 12 13 Generations later and they finally get to experience the full of it you I've been reading the church age book with brother Kingsley and it's amazing how we look into that and at the beginning of Revelation it says that this is going to be a short work you know what a short work is 2,000 years see we got to look at things through God's eyes not just ours because he's got a time and he's got a season for these things amen but God says everything I told you I came to pass not only did they possess it but they lived it it they dwell in it see you can imagine here in New Finland if I had title to a home and it's on the ocean front and it's got a big beautiful beach in front of it and it's got a a pier with it and it's got a nice power booat out there and some kayaks and all these different things if I've got the title D to it that's possession I own it but what's the good of possessing it if I don't live there if I don't ever go and experience it and that's what God's saying is I didn't just bring you into it I've allowed you to live in it not only do you know you have it you're in it you're enjoying the benefits of it you've got a daily manifestation you've got a daily enjoyment you've got a daily Vindication that God's with you because you're living in the promises of what he told you amen it was a reality to them you know we preached many times on on what Canaan is for the believer today and we know it's the promise of the Holy Ghost it's the promise of the Life of Christ dwelling in The Believer and it's is to you and it's to iess as to as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen it wasn't just for the apostles cuz there was 120 of them up in in the upper room and there was only 11 Apostles at that time so it's not just for Apostles it's not just for Ministry it's not just for the Jews because then he came and he gave it to the Samaritans then he gave it to Cornelius and the rest of the Gentiles so it's not based on race it's not based on Ministry it's not based on gender and it's not based on only the ones that are there because it says it's unto you and to your children and as many a far off as the Lord Our God shall call so there's no limit on This Promise they had it at the beginning and it's keeping on going until God fulfills every word of it amen but I want you to catch the subtlety and I was talking with brother Bob I think about this a little while back of what Satan tries to do because Satan's trying to limit our possession he's okay if you say I believe it he's not okay if you say I've got it right Satan will allow Satan's okay with you saying amen he's not okay with you taking possession putting your name going in and putting your two feet on the land that you own amen now listen to this brother Bram says he says now if this person denies that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he says now watch it you'll hear them say oh he's the same he says is he the same is he the same well they say he's the same in a certain way that's not what the scripture says scripture doesn't say Jesus Christ the same in a certain way yesterday today and forever says he's the same yesterday today and forever he says what way see what way well I believe that he's still saves well what about healing oh no he doesn't do that now when he was here on Earth they said he can heal but he can't save now they say he can say but he can't heal see it's just the devil taking vice versa sides many of your mainstream preachers today out in the world even the ones that are not affiliated with the denomination are preaching that signs and wonders and Supernatural are for the apostles only it's in the past that there is no Divine Healing there is no signs and wonders there is no Supernatural in the Church of the Living God today it's all just letter it's Faith unto salvation and that's it and they're preaching it and they're preaching it and it's mainstream all across it amen they don't believe God's working in his church anymore the way that he used to how can that be true the say scripture says that God is immutable that means he doesn't change so how can he be that way then and not that way now God hasn't changed God can't change we must have changed his word can't change so we must have changed our interpretation of it he says but if he's Jesus Christ at all the anointed one he's the same yesterday today and forever the same healer the same it's not you that does Miracles no they want to say let me see you do this I had to get over that as a minister people want you to do things I can't do anything brother bradam said I can't heal you if brother bradam the prophet of the age the star in the right hand of God can't do it what hope does little Jonathan Carlette have none I can't do it like I said last time brother Daryl Ward said our job is to pray the prayer of faith it's God's job to do the healing and then he says now God never said for me to do it he's already done it he said if Jesus Christ was here today he couldn't heal you any more than I could because he's already done it he says the only thing for me to do it says right there he's already done it the only thing for me to do is take his word and hold on to it and he will bring it to pass that's right that's exactly it isn't you it's the god that's in you that's the rest that's why brother B would say I read this quote many services ago maybe I didn't I know I studied it and they said brother brandom don't you get scared up there on the on the platform when you're dealing with situations and you're dealing with sicknesses and people coming up and they have no eyes in their sockets and they want eyesight and people have a foot that's shorter than another one and they want it to be lengthened out or cancer or demons or whatever it might be and he says no if God sent me then he'll take care of the situation we've got to know that if God has ordained us to be where we are doing what we are with who we're with then he'll take care of the situation and our job is to pray the prayer of faith and to act on what we believe that's it I want to walk in the middle of the road and I spent half this more than half this service on the Practical side but we believe in a supernatural God right here right now amen we believe in the Supernatural just in the healings we've seen in this church in the last couple of months we ought to be able to say I know God is real that he heals that he's Supernatural that he's Sovereign that he's all powerful and that he provides in his time and in his season amen there's nothing held back for those that are in Christ we're at the End of the Age all things are possible to them that are beli the book is completely open there's nothing held back from the believer at this time amen he's returned back in the form of the Holy Spirit to do the same works the scripture says why do I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever I believe it first of all because it's here but I rest in it because he's done it because he's done it in my life and he's done it in your life I've seen healings I've seen the supernatural I've seen tongues I've spoken in tongues I've seen and he heard tongues and interpretation I've seen prophecies given I've seen spiritual dreams I've had others tell me spiritual dreams that came true I've seen healings I've seen Deliverance I've seen demons cast out done in myself everything in the book of Acts short of the healing or the raising of the Dead I've seen in my life and in the lives of others and even within this very church that's why I rest in the idea that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever cuz I've experienced it I believed it now I have experienced it and what that means is that as we move closer and closer to what's coming for us a resurrection and Rapture he's building up our faith he's helping us to rest he's helping us to trust and every step we take is to help get us to the next step to the next step until we take the final step it starts with healing that's the earnest of the Resurrection that's the earnest of your body changes healing but then we come into life situations we come into characters we come into family situations we come into things that are are so twisted and tied up in men and and our fingers getting in the pie and all of these different things and we've got to be able to walk up to those and believe that the same God is the same Supernatural one that can bring those things and take apart all the knots and untie all the problems and set everything in order and get it just right in time for the Rapture it's just one thing on top of the other and the faith for what he we have today will be the faith that we need for the thing tomorrow cuz he'll do this one and he'll bring it to pass and that prepares us for the next one and the next one and the next one and all of a sudden the believer saying all things are possible every time I pray he does it every time I take him at his word he does it why should I not believe this though it's greater than anything I believed I know he'll do it cuz he keeps doing it he never stops he never fails he never leaves me he never forsakes me amen Faith gives us rest experience gives us refreshing Amen brother Braham says this he says now he said in Mark 16 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel demonstrate the power in other words he says demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them that accept the gospel see not just say intellectual words no no they couldn't do that with ual word intellectual words that word has to be made flesh manifested it has to the Holy Spirit came down on Christ and it manifested the fullness of God in him and then on the day of Pentecost you got a little lick and I got a little lick that's what it was just a taste of it just of our portion but it's there to manifest the life of it it's there to manifest the word of God inside of us he said see these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they'll cast out Devils they'll speak with new tongues they'll take up serpents and drink deadly things lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they'll demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost it's the word made manifest it can't be a cold formal church I don't believe we have one but it can't just be all Doctrine and teaching it's got to be light life it's got to be the word living in you and I we're meant to do it we're built for it we're ordained for it we're predestinated for it he says these things I'm telling you will come to pass like the quickening word come to pass you have the power of the holy spirit in you it's not you it's the Holy Spirit doing it see now to Be an Effective witness of God you have to have the Holy Ghost because without the Holy Ghost you can't make that live you know I remember brother Tim puit saying 10 15 years ago and I went to their camps and they were wonderful things but he says we're making a shift because he says people need the Holy Ghost people have good teaching and good doctrines and good Ministries but they need the Holy Ghost because without that they're never going to make it and they've made that real shift towards getting them to the Holy Ghost but it's got to be a living it's not just an experience it's not just em motion it's just not just shouting cuz they have lots of that too not just lots of places in camps we've been to camps for those of you that lived in the states perhaps you see this more and you see the same people come to camp and they never changed they'd always have the same experience but they go out and they they come back the next year the same way have an experience go out come in and they'd never get the victory why they didn't get the Holy Ghost they just got an experience an emotional experience I'm not saying it wasn't Supernatural but it wasn't an infilling their life didn't change and it's a lifechanging that happens when the Holy Ghost comes in I don't care whether or not you speak in tongues I don't care whether you Shou in dance but your life has to change and it's to bring overcoming power and it's to produce the word in every one of our Lives amen you know what you'll do he says if you don't get the Holy Ghost he says you know what you'll do you'll take some intellectual Giants idea about it and bypass it and say that was just for the apostles we've got it today in this message it's all word word word and there's no life no love no no overcoming power but they can talk your ear off that's not the Holy Ghost that's intellectual formalism amen what's he saying it's not you doing it it's not me doing it it's Christ in you doing it amen it's the word Christ the word living breathing speaking moving in Us by the Holy Spirit and that's the only way that he's going to have these sorts of effects in our lives as if it's him in us not us trying to do without it we're stuck with an intellectual conception early on in my Ministry you know you get up there and you preach and the first time you're so nervous and you're just trying to get through it frankly but it's an intellectual thing the first time even if you I'm not saying I'm not anointed or wasn't anointed or these things but you're just trying to get through it and you're just trying to bring a thought but that's not enough long term it can be instructive it can help the people but I had to come to a place where I'm anointed to speak and what's coming over is him not just me amen and that's the same way with us where no matter where we're at it's not just for Ministry but it's for every child of God where our life is lived because Christ is living through us and that's the way it is and day in and day out amen otherwise we're all talking no actions we all words and no life and that's a that's a Christian that never gets the victory they get lots of excuses and they get lots of Doctrine but they never get the victory they never get the love anden it's a miserable State cuz you never have everything that the word says you're supposed to have amen we're stuck there we need to get down and pray to God to break us out of that amen humble ourselves to the word but to those that have the Holy Spirit sometimes we get anxious we see the the signs of the times we see what's happening with Israel Israel is God's time clock church we are so close to midnight the world favor the last shred of it is hanging by a thread with the United States and that's about it maybe Great Britain that's it everybody else has turned their backs on Israel at this point and When The World Turns against them that's the end we are so close and we can sit there and say where's the god of Elijah where's the god of William brandham but it's going to be here a little and there a little just a little bit by bit don't miss the Simplicity of the work of God in your life don't miss what's happening Even in our midst the little bits that are there it's God moving in a bride and it's not a public show it's not a public show Amen brother Braham says this as we start to close he says think of it that people born of his spirit in a day like this in this great denominal age that we live and the Living God takes his living word and vindicates it personally this life that's in the word and The Germ that's in the seed the words of seed that a sewer went forth to seow and the life is Christ in the word personally in you brother Rah didn't come so it would all stay in him he came so that it would Quicken each and every one of us the life that was in that Prophet The anointing that was in the prophet the word that was in the prophet the attitude the anointing the spirit of that was supposed to come on a bride to do the exact same things that he was doing it's not an age of all works don't get me wrong it's not an age of all miracles but it was to produce a life yielded to the Holy Spirit where we couldn't influence where Satan will be bound because we won't give him it we won't even open the door he can't get in because we're so lost in Christ that hidden life we talked about he says it's vindicating something that you cannot do proving himself that it's not you but it's him and you've become a love slave to him to be a bride he said thanks be to the Living God who created the heavens and the Earth and all that's in the midst no wonder he is Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending he that was which is and shall come the root The Offspring of David the bright and Morning Star he is all in all his presence in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself The Living Word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a Vindication of the great revelation of God the Book of Revelation is an end time book it's a bride book it's only for the end John understood it nobody else did John had to seal it up and it wasn't open until 1963 and it was open to a people because it's her book why because she is the last revelation of Jesus Christ that's the mystery that's being revealed right now is Christ in you and everybody misses it very few people will ever see it but it's literally the personal expression of Christ in you revealing a portion of the word to this dead and dying age amen that's what's going on here that's the rest that we have amen my name is written in the word my name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that means that there's a life that's got to come out of my life there's a life that's got to come out of your life because he's built it into us to do it and be it so don't pull back don't pull back this is your book this is your word and if you recognize your time and your season and your message then you can step right into it and put your name next to every promise of there and say I'm going to rest on it it's mine but it does you no good if you don't put your feet on it and it does you no good if you don't ever read the title deed amen when somebody dies and they leave a will as the saying goes where there's a will I want to be in it because if you're in the will you get something but you got to be there for the reading of the will and you got to know what belongs to you and then you can go get it amen but there's a rest that comes in knowing that your name is written in the title deed it's not just just the ministry it's not just brother so and so sister so- and so Dad Mom some great person no it's every child of God has a portion written and set aside for them amen and that's what's drawing us up it's the word inside of Us coming out to claim what belongs to us to produce the word to produce Christ Living and alive today and my labor is to find that place of rest where I trust him and him alone remember we read that quote where it says people want to hold on to everything and then take Jesus what we're doing is we're letting go of everything that would hold us back and saying I'll trust him and him alone amen if the musicians would come as I read this last scripture it says God is our refuge and strength if we'd stand a very present help in time of trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled and though the mountain shake with the swelling thereof and then he says sa pause and think about it think about your life think about where you're at think about what's going on does it seem troubled the world is certainly troubled the economy's troubled the politics are troubled the schools are troubled everything's troubled and Satan's trying to trouble us he's trying to get things roiled up and he's trying to get us looking at it and he says David says God is our refuge and strength think about that he doesn't say think about how the mountains are all falling down and the seas are raging he says think about God as our refuge and strength a very present help in time of trouble he says there's a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high Tabernacles plural who's that you and I he says there's a holy place of God is you and I it's the collective body of Believers that's the Tabernacle of God and he says God is in in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early that's our rest he's a very present help in the time of trouble he's a rock in a weary land he's a place of shade he's a place of provision he's a place of strength he's a place of food amen that can bring us it's not just rest in church it's not just rest in our bodies it's rest in our minds amen that we can lay our burdens down that we don't have to lay it night staring up into the ceiling wondering how's it going to work out how am I going to get here how am I going to do this how are we going to manage that why cuz God's in our midst that's his problem to carry we're supposed to lay that on him and say Lord you told me to cast my cares upon you I'm going to cast them on you and I'm going to take my rest while you sort it all out Amen brother R says this he says it reminds me of a German painting in Germany the German painting is called the CL cloud and when you're away from this picture it's the most miserable dismal looking sight it's a bunch of clouds just mixing together and as you start walking to that picture it gives you a horror oh what a dreadful sight it looks he says but when you get close to it it's angel's wings beating together he says see it looks different when you get there but you got to get close enough to see it we've talked about fear fear is something that hasn't yet happened yet but you think it's going to happen you're worried it's going to happen and in the distance it always looks so bad doesn't it he says let it get real before you start determining whether it's a bad thing or a good thing maybe let it happen before you start dwelling on it he says maybe that's the way it is with you tonight you don't know just why you're sick but maybe it's a blessing in disguise you say brother John I'm not sick put your problem there put your struggle there put your trial there put what's got you roiled up there he says maybe it's a blessing in disguise it looks like a gloomy dark end for you but it may be the angel wings beating together if you're only certain of God he says you're sure that God heals the sick and if you're sure that God still pours out the Holy Ghost upon his people then take his promise and hold on to it until God answers for he sure will answer prayer now notice the title be certain of God Amen I like that be certain of God know that God is real know that he hears know that he cares see certainly certainty brings us courage like I said before if we knew that we were going to win if we truly knew truly believed that we're going to win every battle we'd face the battles a lot differently but C but but that certainty gives us courage even boldness as we go into these times of Trials and these times of or things don't don't look so good amen but that certainty it comes when Faith becomes sight like I said you get that once the next time it's a little easier and it's a little easier and it's a little easier but you still got to feed you still got to keep looking you still got to keep dwelling amen but you see God prove himself once and then you can say he'll prove himself again and again and again and again amen we look so often at troubles and we say why me why me I did everything right we don't but you know what I mean we do everything as right as we can and yet things still happen sickness health issues we get old we get broke we get tired we get troubled offended persecuted even what is it God's got to prove himself in every way and he does it through our lives can't know he's a deliverer unless you need Deliverance can't can't know he's a Healer unless you need healing can't know he's a provider unless you need provision and God's trying to prove himself real in every way that we need now so that when it comes to the end we'll believe him and walk right off of this Earth and say he's the god of the Rapture same as he's the god of my healing and the god of my provision and the god of my deliverance and the god of my guidance and all of these different things amen there's a rest available for the believer and it comes with knowing that he's the god of your life that when we walk out of the doors tonight he's going right there with you that you can close your eyes and you can go to him and you can say Lord I'm your child and I'm trusting you and I'm believing you and I'm waiting on you until you move in my life and my situation and then brother Braham says you stay there and he will sure answer prayer amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how we praise you Lord for your goodness Lord for how you've answered prayer Lord for how you've healed our bodies for how you've saved our souls Lord for how you've provided for us Lord for how you've guided us Lord we're thankful for your mercy we're thankful for your goodness we're thankful for your grace Lord we're thankful for all the things that you've done

not just the god of my brother and the god of my sister but you're my God lord and we're here to take our burdens before you Lord and we're here to lay them down at your feet Lord we're here to cast our burdens on you and say lord it's in your hands now Lord that we take our hands off Lord that we let our minds take their ease Lord that that we'd let our bodies take a break Lord and say we're trusting you to meet the need we're trusting you to provide the answer we're trusting you to raise the spirits we're trusting you to bring Salvation and Lord in whatever little part we can do Lord help us to give our strength and our duty and our time and our effort to it Lord but knowing Lord that it's by your spirit that it's going to happen lord it's not resting on us Lord It's resting on you doing the work Lord and where you can use us I pray you help us to yield Lord help us to be sensitive help us to trust help us to have faith Lord God lord we're so thankful for what you've done Lord may we never forget your goodness may we for never forget your power Lord but may we expect it Lord in every situation as we move forward Lord and we've got a part to play Lord you're asking for
