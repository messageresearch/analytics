[54:53] and men certainly want to congratulate
[54:55] brother josh and sister rochelle amen we
[54:57] have a rich history of going long
[54:59] distances to marry amazing women in this
[55:01] church
[55:02] so france is not that far i think i went
[55:05] further and certainly i don't think
[55:06] anybody's gone closer than fifteen
[55:08] hundred or two thousand kilometers to
[55:09] find a wife amongst the young men in
[55:11] this church so and then we like i said
[55:13] it's a he's just following along in the
[55:15] steps of the rest of us i think so and
[55:17] then god bless you both and
[55:18] congratulations
[55:20] amen isaiah chapter 4 verse 1
[55:22] and in that day seven women shall take
[55:24] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[55:27] own bread and wear our own apparel only
[55:30] let us be called by thy name to take
[55:32] away our reproach in that day shall the
[55:35] branch of the lord be beautiful and
[55:36] glorious and the fruit of the earth
[55:38] shall be excellent and comely for them
[55:40] that are escaped of israel
[55:42] and it shall come to pass that he that
[55:44] is left in zion and he that remaineth in
[55:47] jerusalem shall be called holy even
[55:50] every one that is written among the
[55:52] living in jerusalem amen may god add his
[55:55] blessing to the word you may be seated
[55:57] this morning
[55:58] now as we've mentioned before we're
[56:00] starting to get down to the brass tacks
[56:02] so to speak we're starting to get to
[56:03] where the rubber hits the road uh for
[56:05] our visitors i know that they shared
[56:07] with you some of the things that i've
[56:08] been ministering on so hopefully you're
[56:10] you're a little bit up to speed with
[56:11] what we've been speaking on but we've
[56:13] we're on a series called thy kingdom
[56:15] come and it's it's been inspired by the
[56:17] the prayer that jesus prayed and he told
[56:19] us to pray in this way and he says what
[56:21] thy kingdom come thy will be done and
[56:23] that kingdom that he was talking about
[56:25] was not the kingdom that you see with
[56:27] your eyes he said the the kingdom of god
[56:29] comes without observation amen and it is
[56:31] the working of the holy spirit in our
[56:33] lives is the first kingdom that we will
[56:35] ever see before we come to the real
[56:37] kingdom the kingdom that comes down out
[56:38] of heaven amen so this kingdom of heaven
[56:41] that we're speaking about and this
[56:42] morning i want to speak on beauty in the
[56:45] bride this this kingdom that we're
[56:47] looking for is the evidence of the holy
[56:49] spirit in our lives amen brother brahm
[56:51] said the evidence of the holy spirit is
[56:53] what to accept the word for your day
[56:55] amen but that word is not just accepting
[56:57] it in your head but that word is letting
[56:59] it take effect in your life amen and so
[57:01] we're walking through the scriptures and
[57:03] we spend quite some time speaking to the
[57:04] brothers on on what paul said a
[57:06] brother's life would look like if he has
[57:08] the holy spirit and now we're spending
[57:09] some time with the sisters to get them
[57:12] to look into the scriptures and say i
[57:13] believe the message but does the message
[57:15] live in me amen is the word living in my
[57:18] life so i'm going to speak on beauty and
[57:20] the bride this morning we are not going
[57:21] to be talking about how you dress we've
[57:23] had plenty of teaching through the 50
[57:25] odd years 60 odd years that brother
[57:26] branham has left on how a woman should
[57:28] dress i look around i don't see any
[57:30] issues with how the women are dressing
[57:32] here so this is not going to be on your
[57:33] outward appearance by any means if you
[57:35] need to look that up then then you can
[57:37] go ahead and do it but in this in this
[57:39] series and this portion we're going to
[57:41] take a couple a couple services on
[57:43] beauty by god's grace this is not about
[57:45] what you look like on the outside the
[57:46] outward is the manifestation of the
[57:48] inward amen but you can look beautiful
[57:50] on the outside even according to what
[57:51] the scripture says and have an ugly
[57:53] inside if we wanted to put it that way
[57:55] so we want to talk about the beauty that
[57:57] is in the bride and this is the beauty
[57:58] that god loves this is the beauty that
[58:00] god express expects and this is the
[58:02] beauty that god appreciates now i've
[58:05] noticed one thing that sometimes we
[58:06] struggle with and that's that we often
[58:08] look in the bible and we know what we
[58:10] are and we read about what we are but we
[58:13] don't look so much at what we are not
[58:15] and you see it many times god gives us a
[58:17] contrast of what he expects and then
[58:20] what the world provides in in an
[58:22] opposite side of things so god has a
[58:24] bride satan's preparing a bride god has
[58:26] a church satan has a church so what
[58:28] often happens is we look at what he says
[58:30] about us and we say okay that's us but
[58:32] what we do is we don't look at the
[58:33] contrasting side which is the world or
[58:35] satan's kingdom to say do i have any of
[58:37] those attributes in my life because
[58:39] oftentimes what we have is we have a
[58:41] portion of our life that is completely
[58:42] godly but we have another portion of our
[58:45] life that is not given over yet to god
[58:47] and it's a door that's closed in our
[58:48] life and if we're not reading the
[58:50] scripture to see what satan's kingdom
[58:51] looks like we don't realize we have a
[58:53] problem because what we're doing is
[58:55] we're reading all the things that he
[58:56] says we should have we say that's great
[58:58] but we are forgetting that there's a
[58:59] contrast and we have to look at the
[59:00] contrast often to check ourselves and
[59:03] see am i fully surrendered to god is the
[59:05] word having full preeminence in my life
[59:07] is the holy spirit working in every
[59:09] aspect of my life amen so we started in
[59:12] isaiah 4 this morning because it's an
[59:14] end time scripture and we'll get to
[59:15] where the prophet confirms that but i
[59:17] want us to turn back to isaiah 3 this
[59:19] morning if you would and hold your
[59:21] bibles will be in isaiah 3 and 4 for
[59:23] quite some time
[59:24] but isaiah 3 verse 12 and this sets the
[59:26] picture for the time that he was talking
[59:29] about here in isaiah 4. it says as for
[59:32] my people isaiah 3 verse 12 as for my
[59:35] people
[59:36] children are their oppressors and women
[59:38] rule over them
[59:40] oh my people they which lead thee cause
[59:43] thee to air and destroy the way of thy
[59:46] past now this is not a compliment in
[59:48] scripture right this is a rebuke to the
[59:51] people and he's saying that children
[59:52] oppress you if children oppress you if
[59:55] children can dominate you if children
[59:57] can rule over you as an adult that's not
[59:59] a very good thing is it can you imagine
[1:00:01] if if my young son jensen at six years
[1:00:04] old was oppressing me
[1:00:06] how weak would i have to be to allow a
[1:00:08] child to have power and authority over
[1:00:09] me amen but he says in the time that
[1:00:12] we're talking about in isaiah 4 children
[1:00:14] will oppress you and women will rule
[1:00:17] over you so this is not meant to be
[1:00:19] complimentary it is a time when children
[1:00:21] are having their way with their parents
[1:00:22] they're leading with temper tantrums
[1:00:24] they're letting social media and
[1:00:25] influence take over their parents lives
[1:00:27] they're pushing agendas onto their
[1:00:29] parents we see even now that they are
[1:00:31] wanting children to be allowed to vote
[1:00:34] at the age of 16. can you imagine a 16
[1:00:36] year old voting for anything that would
[1:00:37] actually benefit the whole of society
[1:00:40] rather than just themselves almost
[1:00:42] impossible to find it even adults don't
[1:00:43] do that these days much less children
[1:00:45] but it says what children are going to
[1:00:47] oppress you we see it in the climate
[1:00:49] change movement and these different
[1:00:50] things what do we have we have children
[1:00:52] that are trying to drive agendas and
[1:00:54] then on the flip side we have women that
[1:00:56] are trying to drive their agendas now
[1:00:58] brother branham said it is a woman's
[1:01:00] world now amen have you read that in the
[1:01:01] message where he said it is a woman's
[1:01:03] world women control the world now now
[1:01:05] you look at the highest levels of
[1:01:07] business and commerce and that it is
[1:01:09] still mostly men isn't it but when it
[1:01:11] comes to the agenda that's being driven
[1:01:13] it's by women and they are dominating by
[1:01:15] body and they are dominating by what
[1:01:17] influence amen they have a physic
[1:01:19] physical effect over men which is well
[1:01:22] documented but they also have what they
[1:01:24] have an agenda that they're driving in
[1:01:26] any and every way possible to try and
[1:01:28] take over the world so we're at the time
[1:01:31] where this is happening today we can
[1:01:32] look and we can see what's being driven
[1:01:34] female politicians are driving this we
[1:01:36] have female empowerment we have females
[1:01:38] driving in business all these different
[1:01:40] things we have this strong push to get
[1:01:42] the women more involved and not just
[1:01:44] equal to but over authority in the
[1:01:47] entire world isn't it this is what we
[1:01:49] see right now but what is the end of it
[1:01:51] he says there they that are leading you
[1:01:53] the children oppressing you the women
[1:01:54] leading or ruling cause thee to air and
[1:01:57] destroy the way of thy past this leads
[1:01:59] to destruction this leads to ruin if
[1:02:01] you're expecting anything else except
[1:02:02] destruction and ruin in this age with
[1:02:04] what's going on you're going to be
[1:02:06] sorely disappointed there is no
[1:02:07] beautiful thing that comes out of where
[1:02:09] we are in the world today amen it is on
[1:02:11] a downhill slide brother branham said
[1:02:13] it's like the loggers when they skid a
[1:02:15] log when they take it off of a trailer
[1:02:17] they put it on skids and once you put it
[1:02:19] on the skids he says it's off the skids
[1:02:21] and it's not coming back the log is
[1:02:23] rolling down off the trailer and there's
[1:02:25] no stopping it it's going to hit the
[1:02:26] bottom right and he's saying the same
[1:02:28] thing for for america at the time and of
[1:02:30] course it's the world generally right
[1:02:31] now this the log is off the skids it's
[1:02:34] rolling downhill and there's no stopping
[1:02:35] it amen it's just going to get faster
[1:02:37] and faster and faster
[1:02:39] but verse 13 says the lord standeth up
[1:02:41] to plead and standeth to judge the
[1:02:44] people and the lord will enter into
[1:02:46] judgment with the ancients of his people
[1:02:48] and the princes thereof for ye have
[1:02:50] eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the
[1:02:53] poor is in your house
[1:02:55] he says what mean ye that ye beat my
[1:02:57] people to pieces and grind the faces of
[1:03:00] the poor saith the lord of hosts this
[1:03:02] isn't a good time they're having here is
[1:03:04] it
[1:03:05] moreover the lord saith because the
[1:03:07] daughters of zion are haughty and walk
[1:03:10] with stretch forth necks and wanton eyes
[1:03:13] walking and mincing as they go and
[1:03:16] making a tinkling with their feet now
[1:03:19] we're not going to be talking about
[1:03:20] clothes today but yet isaiah is pointing
[1:03:22] to the women of that day and he's
[1:03:23] pointing to clothes as representative of
[1:03:26] an issue isn't he all right he's talking
[1:03:28] about how they walk and he says
[1:03:29] literally you know we say you're walking
[1:03:31] the wrong way these days you're you're
[1:03:33] not living the right way he doesn't even
[1:03:35] say that he says you're not even
[1:03:36] literally walking the right way he says
[1:03:38] when you walk you're walking in a way
[1:03:40] that is not pleasing to god he says
[1:03:42] you're he says you walk haughtily and
[1:03:44] that hottie means proud the stretch fork
[1:03:47] next means that they're arched and proud
[1:03:49] but it means they're drawing attention
[1:03:51] to their figure they're elongating their
[1:03:53] body to draw what the men's eye to them
[1:03:56] right he says you're what walking with
[1:03:58] wanton eyes that means lustful eyes
[1:04:00] you're willingly flirtatious and you're
[1:04:03] unabashedly checking out the men you are
[1:04:06] bold with your interest
[1:04:08] you're walking and mincing walking in a
[1:04:10] way that draws attention to you seeking
[1:04:12] to draw the eyes of men
[1:04:14] and then he says you're wearing anklets
[1:04:16] and jewelry that make a sound as you
[1:04:18] walk so you're trying yet again in
[1:04:20] another way to draw the eyes and
[1:04:22] attention of men to you right these are
[1:04:24] not
[1:04:25] mild women is it these are bold proud
[1:04:28] unapologetic seeking women amen that
[1:04:31] he's talking about here
[1:04:32] brother branham says this he says you
[1:04:35] married men when you see them women on
[1:04:36] the street like that you sons of god
[1:04:39] don't you realize what taken place in
[1:04:41] the in the first beginning he's taken us
[1:04:43] all the way back to what the days of the
[1:04:45] sons of man and the sons of god right
[1:04:47] after adam and eve
[1:04:49] when science has made women so pretty in
[1:04:51] the end or had made women so pretty in
[1:04:53] the anti-deluvian world until the sons
[1:04:56] of god took daughters of men
[1:04:58] not daughters of god and god never did
[1:05:01] forget it they destroyed the whole thing
[1:05:04] science and they were prettier
[1:05:07] you notice the beauty of women lifting
[1:05:09] in the last days it is a sign of the end
[1:05:12] god has proved it so use a thinking
[1:05:15] man's filter and you'll have a holy
[1:05:16] man's taste
[1:05:18] he says it'll cost you what he's meaning
[1:05:20] is otherwise it'll cost you your home
[1:05:22] it'll cost you your position it'll cost
[1:05:25] you everything you've got besides that
[1:05:28] it'll cost you your soul it'll break up
[1:05:30] your home it may have another man raise
[1:05:33] your children or another woman raise
[1:05:36] your children amen this is where we are
[1:05:38] now isn't it amen and he says what
[1:05:41] science has made women more beautiful
[1:05:43] amen you can be augmented you can have
[1:05:45] bigger things smaller things more things
[1:05:47] less of things bigger lips beautiful
[1:05:50] hair eyebrows they can do anything a
[1:05:52] woman wants no they can do anything a
[1:05:53] man wants to for that matter but they're
[1:05:55] focused on the women to make them more
[1:05:57] beautiful if you look at a woman from
[1:05:59] 1920 and a woman from today it is not
[1:06:02] even close it is we're not talking about
[1:06:04] standards of beauty we're talking about
[1:06:06] the the actual figure and the structure
[1:06:08] of the faces and that women are far more
[1:06:10] beautiful beautiful today than they ever
[1:06:12] were i i don't think it's i don't think
[1:06:14] it's debatable right you look at you can
[1:06:17] walk through the mall and you can see a
[1:06:19] girl that's as pretty as a as a movie
[1:06:21] star from 50 years ago it's not at all
[1:06:23] uncommon is it women are getting much
[1:06:25] more beautiful amen
[1:06:27] we're in this time we're in the time
[1:06:28] that isaiah was talking about
[1:06:31] isaiah 3 17 says therefore the lord will
[1:06:34] smite with a scab the crown of the head
[1:06:37] of the daughters of zion it says he's
[1:06:39] going to make them bald
[1:06:40] and the lord will discover their secret
[1:06:42] parts now this is not a nice thing it
[1:06:44] says that he's going to cause him to be
[1:06:46] taken into slavery and suffer the
[1:06:49] indignity of being stripped naked so
[1:06:50] that everyone can see them and he he
[1:06:53] says they wanted the attention now
[1:06:55] they're going to get it but it's not
[1:06:56] going to come the way they wanted the
[1:06:58] attention amen and you can see that
[1:07:00] there's a consequence to our actions
[1:07:02] amen if you want to see this in action
[1:07:04] go look in hollywood go look at your
[1:07:05] rock and roll stars go look at your
[1:07:07] amazing singers and they all start out
[1:07:10] so many of them as pure and innocent
[1:07:12] right they come in and that's what draws
[1:07:14] people to them is you get this this
[1:07:16] beautiful young lady and she hasn't been
[1:07:18] sullied she just has a beautiful gift to
[1:07:21] sing or she has a gift to act and what
[1:07:23] do they turn do they turn her into
[1:07:25] something that is used by man after man
[1:07:28] by system after system by business after
[1:07:30] business and it spits her out at the end
[1:07:32] and she's lost she's nothing she's
[1:07:34] destroyed right they've destroyed her
[1:07:36] they've taken that purity and innocence
[1:07:38] and they've turned her into a prostitute
[1:07:40] right for what not for her gain for
[1:07:42] their gain amen that's what's going to
[1:07:45] happen so there's a consequence to our
[1:07:46] actions is what isaiah is saying here
[1:07:48] and that's this is not just to the
[1:07:50] sisters but it's the brothers and that
[1:07:52] the way that you walk you're either
[1:07:53] going to add value to those that are
[1:07:55] under your authority or those that are
[1:07:56] following you or you're going to make
[1:07:57] them pay a price amen whatever we do
[1:08:00] something's got to happen and it's
[1:08:01] either going to cause growth or it's
[1:08:03] going to cause decay and ruin right so
[1:08:05] watch out if you're leading in any way
[1:08:07] make sure you're living the right way
[1:08:09] make sure you're walking the right right
[1:08:11] the right way brother brown says this he
[1:08:12] says he says some woman just made a
[1:08:15] remark and came in the other day and
[1:08:17] said show me where the man has walked
[1:08:19] and let me walk behind him upon the
[1:08:21] ground and said i'll get well. so a
[1:08:23] woman came in and said show me where
[1:08:24] brother branham has walked if i can walk
[1:08:27] where his footsteps were i believe i'll
[1:08:29] get well that's the that's the book of
[1:08:31] acts right when peter walked by his
[1:08:33] shadow crossed over and what people got
[1:08:35] well she said i believe that man so much
[1:08:38] that if you show me where he walked and
[1:08:40] i can walk the same place i'll be healed
[1:08:42] right he says now the people believe you
[1:08:45] like that and you're a representative of
[1:08:47] christ then what should we do
[1:08:50] this is not just for the prophet we're
[1:08:52] talking to the bride now because christ
[1:08:54] is in the bride he's not in a prophet
[1:08:56] anymore he's here so he's asking us what
[1:08:58] should we do
[1:09:00] we should be very careful because you're
[1:09:03] not only destroying yourself with wrong
[1:09:06] you're destroying others who are
[1:09:08] following you
[1:09:09] so i know no denomination or nothing to
[1:09:12] take you to there's only one thing i
[1:09:14] have my faith in if you believe me
[1:09:17] follow what i tell you because i believe
[1:09:20] the bible that's the word of god other
[1:09:23] things fail but he is the life he is the
[1:09:27] word so what he's saying is let your
[1:09:29] life let your actions like if people are
[1:09:31] following you let them be following the
[1:09:33] word that's in you and let it not be
[1:09:35] something that you want or you do or you
[1:09:37] say but let it be the word from start to
[1:09:39] finish amen so that they'll end up where
[1:09:41] you're going which is hopefully heaven
[1:09:43] amen and eternal life amen with the holy
[1:09:45] ghost
[1:09:46] amen the scripture follows up on these
[1:09:48] women in their judgment it says in that
[1:09:50] day the lord will take away the bravery
[1:09:52] of their tinkling ornaments about their
[1:09:54] feet and their calls and their round
[1:09:57] tires like the moon the chains and the
[1:09:59] bracelets and the mufflers it sounds
[1:10:01] like cars the bonnets
[1:10:03] cars and the ornaments of the legs and
[1:10:06] the headbands and the tablets and the
[1:10:07] earrings tablets are in the scripture
[1:10:09] he's going to take away your tablets
[1:10:12] the rings and nose jewels the changeable
[1:10:15] suits of apparel and the mantles and the
[1:10:17] wimples and the crisping pins i don't
[1:10:19] even know what these are but it's the
[1:10:21] stuff that they use to make themselves
[1:10:22] beautiful
[1:10:25] it says the glasses and the fine linens
[1:10:27] and the hoods and the veils in other
[1:10:30] words god's taking away everything they
[1:10:31] thought they used to draw attention to
[1:10:34] accessorize themselves to make them
[1:10:36] attractive to everybody that's looking
[1:10:37] on them he says i'm going to take it all
[1:10:39] away
[1:10:41] and it shall come to pass that instead
[1:10:43] of sweet smell there shall be stink
[1:10:46] and instead of a girdle a rent and
[1:10:49] instead of well said hair baldness and
[1:10:51] instead of a stomacher a girding of
[1:10:54] sackcloth and burning instead of beauty
[1:10:57] i mean this is the end of these women
[1:10:59] that are walking this way and if we were
[1:11:00] to be honest this is not a good ending
[1:11:02] is it
[1:11:04] it'll be a instead of a sweet smell a
[1:11:06] stink
[1:11:07] right instead of a girdle girl's
[1:11:08] supposed to hold things in it says a
[1:11:10] rent so there's going to be a tear in it
[1:11:11] so that whatever you're trying to hold
[1:11:13] in and hide is going to leak out right
[1:11:15] if we were to be transparent on this
[1:11:17] this is the description of a worn out
[1:11:19] prostitute
[1:11:20] right she's been used and abused and
[1:11:22] then thrown away
[1:11:24] this is where they end up he says and
[1:11:26] thy men shall fall by the sword and thy
[1:11:30] mighty in the war so nobody nobody
[1:11:32] succeeds under this leadership or under
[1:11:34] this oppression nobody comes to a good
[1:11:36] end
[1:11:38] and her gates shall lament and mourn and
[1:11:40] she being desolate
[1:11:43] shall sit upon the ground what a
[1:11:45] horrible time to be considered a
[1:11:46] daughter of zion because remember these
[1:11:48] are the daughters of zion you know the
[1:11:50] zion always types the bride
[1:11:53] the daughters that are supposed to be
[1:11:54] representing the bride are worn out
[1:11:56] prostitutes that's what that's what
[1:11:58] isaiah is telling us here
[1:12:00] amen what a horrible place to be and you
[1:12:02] see it
[1:12:03] happening
[1:12:04] all through here
[1:12:06] right they started out so perfect and
[1:12:08] beautiful
[1:12:09] and then they just the light got less
[1:12:11] and less and less and now he's building
[1:12:14] her back up isn't he
[1:12:16] but then he's got to take her out of it
[1:12:17] because it's so corrupt here there's no
[1:12:20] saving that so he just takes a remnant
[1:12:22] out of it and he takes her to be with
[1:12:24] him and the rest go into judgment and
[1:12:25] they end up just like this don't they
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:29] but in all of this
[1:12:31] there is a real bride
[1:12:33] there is a real woman there is a
[1:12:35] beautiful woman there is a seed that
[1:12:37] comes out amen
[1:12:38] but this one has the right family
[1:12:40] lineage she has the right teaching she
[1:12:43] has everything that she needs and yet
[1:12:45] she has twisted her way out of
[1:12:46] everything that god has found beautiful
[1:12:50] brother braham says this he says i've
[1:12:51] got a prophecy laying at home one of
[1:12:54] these days i'm going to read it and you
[1:12:56] wonder why i rap at women the way i do
[1:12:58] 30 years ago i got thus saith the lord
[1:13:01] 30 years ago when i entered the ministry
[1:13:04] he told me that the strain of women
[1:13:06] would come so immortal and imputed in
[1:13:08] the last days they'd be the most defiled
[1:13:11] thing on the earth that's what we just
[1:13:12] read in isaiah the most defiled thing
[1:13:15] what right she started it at the
[1:13:18] beginning and satan uses her at the end
[1:13:22] amen i've told you sisters you have a
[1:13:24] target on your back amen you have a
[1:13:26] target on your back because he's trying
[1:13:28] to twist you out of the way that is
[1:13:30] called holy and look what is happening
[1:13:33] look down through the years
[1:13:34] it said she'll continue to strip herself
[1:13:37] and said there'll just be a little tiny
[1:13:40] group of the very elected that's
[1:13:44] predestinated we'll escape that amen
[1:13:46] when that vision come that worried me i
[1:13:49] thought women i turned back over in the
[1:13:52] bible to isaiah i believe the fourth
[1:13:54] chapter and it said the branch that
[1:13:56] escaped from the daughters of zion in
[1:13:58] that day will be beautiful to the lord
[1:14:00] now notice how he phrases it the
[1:14:02] daughters of a zion that escape
[1:14:05] amen this is not people that can stay in
[1:14:08] it's people that escape they get out of
[1:14:10] it they're the lucky ones we would say
[1:14:12] today right we'd say we're blessed
[1:14:14] they're lucky to get out they escaped
[1:14:16] when everybody else died in this
[1:14:19] amen so we bring this now into what
[1:14:22] isaiah 4 where we just started the
[1:14:23] service and it says in that day what day
[1:14:26] the day we just read when women were
[1:14:28] walking wrong looking wrong acting wrong
[1:14:30] being wrong and ultimately paying a
[1:14:32] price for it and everybody paid the
[1:14:33] price for their poor actions
[1:14:36] right in that day seven women shall take
[1:14:39] hold of one man saying we will eat our
[1:14:41] own bread and wear our own apparel only
[1:14:44] let us be called by thy name to take
[1:14:46] away our reproach
[1:14:52] brother gus just so you know i didn't
[1:14:53] touch the water in there so if you need
[1:14:55] a drink you can drink it
[1:14:56] i'm fighting what samuel has so
[1:14:59] i'm i'm a little a little down tonight
[1:15:02] today here all right so i want to jump
[1:15:03] into what brother braham says because i
[1:15:04] take this right from him i didn't come
[1:15:06] up with this brother braddon walks us
[1:15:08] right through this scripture and tells
[1:15:09] us exactly what's going on he says well
[1:15:11] brother it's pretty near that bad now
[1:15:14] what a falling away has happened to our
[1:15:16] country let me say this my dear
[1:15:18] christian friends let me say this with
[1:15:20] godly respects to everyone you people
[1:15:22] here who studied history
[1:15:24] were right on the same road that every
[1:15:26] fine nation through the ages has fell on
[1:15:29] demoralizing going right back
[1:15:33] and it's got to a place where it seems
[1:15:35] like we don't care for our women that's
[1:15:37] a rebuke to the men
[1:15:40] and then he says or our women don't care
[1:15:42] for our set themselves and that's a
[1:15:45] rebuke to the women so us men have a job
[1:15:47] and the women have a job and he's saying
[1:15:49] neither one of you is doing your job
[1:15:52] right that's what it is if a woman would
[1:15:54] keep herself right the man would have to
[1:15:56] go right and that's not taking up for
[1:15:59] the men but i know that's the truth yes
[1:16:01] sir but what is it it's just a horrible
[1:16:04] condition and it's existing and it's
[1:16:06] according to the scripture the bible
[1:16:08] said it would be that way he says so how
[1:16:10] can we have a revival how can we have a
[1:16:13] revival if we're in this condition
[1:16:16] right we are living in the days that god
[1:16:19] spoke would come and were living in the
[1:16:21] last days so he said we're living in the
[1:16:23] days of isaiah 4 and we're living in the
[1:16:25] last days he says it's one in the same
[1:16:27] day
[1:16:28] regardless of what we try to think about
[1:16:30] it god's word says that we are
[1:16:33] predestinated that's right and what god
[1:16:36] has called will come to god and what god
[1:16:38] doesn't call will not come to god god
[1:16:41] calls they refuse and he calls and they
[1:16:44] refuse amen god is not willing that any
[1:16:46] should perish
[1:16:49] now i don't say god condemns anybody
[1:16:51] he's not willing that they all should
[1:16:53] that any should perish but all might
[1:16:56] come to repentance but in order to be
[1:16:58] god he knew in the beginning they
[1:16:59] weren't going to come yet he gave them a
[1:17:02] chance but they wouldn't come
[1:17:04] this is what led these women
[1:17:07] right women are type of churches this is
[1:17:09] what led them to this condition is he
[1:17:11] called and they didn't he called and
[1:17:13] they didn't he called and they didn't
[1:17:14] and then they went away of their own
[1:17:16] choosing
[1:17:17] amen he says just think here as i was
[1:17:19] answering the scripture seven women grab
[1:17:21] a hold of one man in the first world war
[1:17:24] the second world war i've got a
[1:17:26] newspaper clipping at home out of the
[1:17:27] newspaper you read it yourself said
[1:17:29] what's happened to the morals of our
[1:17:31] american women two out of every three
[1:17:33] soldiers was divorced by their wives
[1:17:34] that went overseas in the first six
[1:17:36] months two out of three was divorced
[1:17:38] those women just took off and run out
[1:17:40] why is it you'll un if you'll understand
[1:17:43] friends it's the spirit of time catch
[1:17:47] that it's a spirit we're dealing with
[1:17:49] here right it's an attitude we're
[1:17:51] dealing with it's an influence that
[1:17:52] we're dealing with amen it doesn't get
[1:17:55] on churches it gets on people it gets on
[1:17:58] people and then it comes into the
[1:17:59] churches and then they form a church
[1:18:01] around that spirit or that attitude amen
[1:18:03] there is no such thing as a church
[1:18:05] there's only a such thing as people and
[1:18:06] then they form a church they form a a
[1:18:08] congregation they form an assembly of
[1:18:10] some sort and then it has a spirit of
[1:18:12] the thing that pulled them all together
[1:18:14] in the first place amen
[1:18:16] he says we've got to get in the spirit
[1:18:19] of the last days when the last days are
[1:18:22] here so he says there's a spirit out
[1:18:24] there and there's a spirit in here you
[1:18:27] better be with the one that's in here
[1:18:29] right there's a spirit that we've got to
[1:18:31] be getting into in this time he says you
[1:18:33] go to a dance hall you've got to get in
[1:18:35] the spirit of dancing or they won't
[1:18:37] dance
[1:18:38] you go to the church you've got to get
[1:18:41] in the spirit of worship before you can
[1:18:44] worship
[1:18:45] why otherwise it's just what it's a
[1:18:46] false pretense it's false fellowship
[1:18:48] it's false worship it's a form it's not
[1:18:51] something that's really coming out of
[1:18:52] you
[1:18:53] the world's got to get in the spirit of
[1:18:55] the last days before the last days can
[1:18:57] come and we're in the spirit of the last
[1:19:00] days and god's promised that these
[1:19:02] things will be here and that's what
[1:19:04] we've got
[1:19:05] he promised it and it's here now that he
[1:19:07] promised the bad but he also promised
[1:19:10] the good didn't he
[1:19:12] we're in the last days and men and women
[1:19:14] are sitting asleep and don't realize it
[1:19:17] we're at the last days sure seven women
[1:19:20] are hold of one man saying we'll eat our
[1:19:22] own bread and wear our own clothes only
[1:19:24] let us be called by your name to take
[1:19:26] away our reproach brother you don't even
[1:19:28] have to get away from the united states
[1:19:30] there's only one place i've ever been in
[1:19:32] my life that i thought was any worse
[1:19:34] than the streets and things that i've
[1:19:35] been in our own nation
[1:19:37] and we're not getting any better do you
[1:19:39] know where that was
[1:19:40] paris france
[1:19:42] why because that's where hollywood
[1:19:43] started amen it's a wonder that we have
[1:19:46] believers coming out of there but guess
[1:19:48] what we have believers out of every
[1:19:49] tongue and nation out of every hell hole
[1:19:52] amen are we any different now
[1:19:54] no we're no different it's a miracle
[1:19:56] that we come out of canada anybody could
[1:19:58] come out of the united states anywhere
[1:20:00] because why it's all felt the spirit of
[1:20:02] the ages across the earth and he's got
[1:20:04] to pull us all out of it amen
[1:20:06] right we're no different
[1:20:08] right he can pull a believer out of
[1:20:09] california just as he says he can pull
[1:20:11] one out of out of newfoundland amen why
[1:20:14] because the spirit's the same across all
[1:20:15] of it
[1:20:16] right he says we're constantly
[1:20:19] constantly getting worse and worse all
[1:20:22] the time and remember i'm speaking in
[1:20:25] the name of the lord he's speaking as a
[1:20:27] prophet now this is not just preaching
[1:20:29] he's saying in the name of the lord this
[1:20:30] is thus saith the lord we will continue
[1:20:34] to grow worse
[1:20:35] and there's only one hope at all and
[1:20:38] that's in christ jesus no matter what
[1:20:40] you do amen we're here now and he says
[1:20:42] it's going to get worse so prepare to
[1:20:44] fight harder because it's going to get
[1:20:46] stronger and stronger and stronger and
[1:20:48] the pull from the world the attempt to
[1:20:50] influence our brothers and sisters is
[1:20:52] going to get stronger and stronger he
[1:20:53] says the only way you'll get out is if
[1:20:55] you get in the spirit of the last age
[1:20:58] amen and that is the spirit for the
[1:20:59] believer and what is it is a spirit of
[1:21:01] separation it is a spirit of truth it is
[1:21:04] a spirit of an absolute amen it is a
[1:21:06] spirit of the resurrection it is a
[1:21:08] spirit of the rapture it is a spirit
[1:21:10] that is everything all in right
[1:21:13] everything is given over to the to that
[1:21:15] spirit and that is the holy spirit in
[1:21:17] our lives amen
[1:21:19] amen i want to go back to that scripture
[1:21:21] in isaiah 4 1 because it highlights an
[1:21:23] attitude and it highlights his spirit
[1:21:25] and then so long we look at our actions
[1:21:26] and we fix the actions and we forget
[1:21:28] that there's an attitude or spirit
[1:21:29] behind the actions that we really need
[1:21:31] to address right we've got to look
[1:21:33] inward for that we don't just fix the
[1:21:35] outward right what did the scripture
[1:21:37] call us why did sepulchers right that's
[1:21:39] what he called the pharisees and
[1:21:40] sadducees you're like white at
[1:21:41] sepulchers you're dead on the inside but
[1:21:44] the outside is beautiful
[1:21:45] that's not what we want we don't want to
[1:21:46] be beautiful on the outside i'd rather
[1:21:48] an honest person that doesn't look so
[1:21:50] good but god is working on them they're
[1:21:52] honest enough to recognize it in
[1:21:53] admitted amen
[1:21:55] amen so this is when we look here in
[1:21:57] isaiah 4 1 this is the anti-bride
[1:22:01] attitude this is satan's bride's
[1:22:04] attitude that we see here amen yes amen
[1:22:07] what
[1:22:08] we're not reading just about what the
[1:22:10] bride is but we want to catch what she
[1:22:12] isn't and this is what she isn't so
[1:22:13] let's pay attention it says in that day
[1:22:15] seven women shall take hold of one man
[1:22:18] saying we will eat our own bread and
[1:22:20] wear our own apparel only let us be
[1:22:22] called by thy name to take away our
[1:22:24] approach now as a man that might not
[1:22:25] seem so bad
[1:22:27] she's going to come in she's going to
[1:22:28] take my name she's going to marry me and
[1:22:30] she's going to work for herself and
[1:22:32] she's going to bring her own clothes
[1:22:34] right
[1:22:35] but that's an anti-bride attitude i want
[1:22:37] you to catch that right why the woman
[1:22:40] will provide her own food
[1:22:42] now let's put on her spiritual hats
[1:22:44] right now right she says i'm going to
[1:22:46] choose what and how i eat and when i eat
[1:22:50] right now that's great until you realize
[1:22:52] that god has provided a food for you to
[1:22:54] eat in this age amen there is a manner
[1:22:56] that we've heard about in the last few
[1:22:58] services there's a revealed word so you
[1:23:00] don't get to choose what you eat your
[1:23:02] husband christ is supposed to choose it
[1:23:04] for you so when she comes in she's
[1:23:05] saying i'm going to feed you and he's
[1:23:07] saying but i'm supposed to feed you
[1:23:08] because i know what you need but she
[1:23:10] said no i'll do that and then she says
[1:23:12] what i'll provide my own clothes i'll
[1:23:14] bring my own apparel
[1:23:16] now the problem is is that he's got
[1:23:18] something he wants her to put on
[1:23:20] and she says that don't worry about me
[1:23:22] i'll look the way i want i'll dress the
[1:23:24] way i want what you think doesn't matter
[1:23:26] i'm going to dress whatever way i want
[1:23:29] but you got to remember there's
[1:23:30] something that he wants the bride to put
[1:23:32] on amen
[1:23:33] so what is the man getting out of all
[1:23:34] this
[1:23:36] you'll see this is a one-sided offer she
[1:23:39] says i want your name i'll provide for
[1:23:41] myself we see no offer of a marriage
[1:23:44] here she just says i want something from
[1:23:47] you and it's your name i want you to
[1:23:48] take away my stigma of not being married
[1:23:51] i don't want people to to know i'm
[1:23:53] single so i want your name give me your
[1:23:55] name and i don't need anything else from
[1:23:57] you not only that i won't give you
[1:23:59] anything
[1:24:01] right
[1:24:02] she's wanting one thing just the name
[1:24:04] and she says i won't require anything
[1:24:06] else from you but i also won't give you
[1:24:08] anything either that doesn't sound like
[1:24:09] a marriage does it
[1:24:11] right so this is both selfish and
[1:24:13] desperate at the same time it is
[1:24:16] entirely to her benefit but she's
[1:24:19] desperate to take away that stigma amen
[1:24:21] she wants the title without the
[1:24:23] relationship amen she'll take her
[1:24:25] freedom and her self-sufficient
[1:24:26] lifestyle but she just wants the name of
[1:24:28] her husband at the same time she doesn't
[1:24:30] want to give up anything but she wants
[1:24:32] to gain what he has that's what it is
[1:24:33] amen she's not looking for love she's
[1:24:35] not looking for intimacy she's not
[1:24:37] looking for family all she's wanting is
[1:24:39] to not be embarrassed amen that's not
[1:24:42] exactly the foundation for a marriage is
[1:24:44] it i don't want to be embarrassed
[1:24:47] not only that but listen she thinks she
[1:24:49] has everything she needs
[1:24:51] except the name she thinks she's got it
[1:24:53] all provided for herself and this is the
[1:24:55] trap that we're going to look at amen
[1:24:57] because what this is an end time
[1:24:58] prophecy remember our prophet says
[1:25:00] isaiah 4 is today and he's speaking in
[1:25:03] the name of the lord and so where do we
[1:25:05] see that revelation 3 verse 14 says unto
[1:25:08] the church of the angel of the church of
[1:25:10] the laodiceans right these things saith
[1:25:13] the amen the faithful and true witness
[1:25:15] the beginning of the creation of god i
[1:25:17] know thy works that thou art neither
[1:25:19] cold nor hot i would thou art cold or
[1:25:22] hot so then because thou art lukewarm
[1:25:24] and neither cold nor hot i will spew
[1:25:26] thee out of my mouth
[1:25:27] because thou sayest
[1:25:30] i am rich increase with goods and have
[1:25:33] need of nothing she doesn't need a
[1:25:35] husband to provide for hers this is the
[1:25:37] church right why she has it all
[1:25:40] and no it's not that thou art wretched
[1:25:42] miserable poor blind and naked
[1:25:45] now why is she coming to him if she has
[1:25:47] it all
[1:25:48] right the outward expression is i've got
[1:25:50] it all but the inward side says i need a
[1:25:53] husband's name to take away my reproach
[1:25:55] so he's looking to the n word he says i
[1:25:57] know in there you're still miserable
[1:26:00] right
[1:26:01] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:26:03] in the fire that's godly characters
[1:26:05] we've said many times amen but this
[1:26:07] woman this church doesn't want to change
[1:26:11] this these women of isaiah 4 they don't
[1:26:13] want to change it all they want to stay
[1:26:16] exactly the same but take his name
[1:26:19] right
[1:26:20] what is it
[1:26:22] she doesn't want to come under word
[1:26:24] authority
[1:26:25] right
[1:26:26] he says i counseled thee to buy me gold
[1:26:29] tried in the fire that thou mayest be
[1:26:30] rich and white raiment that thou mayest
[1:26:33] be clothed he's got something he wants
[1:26:35] her to put on her clothes won't do no
[1:26:37] matter how beautiful they are how good
[1:26:39] they are how well made they are the
[1:26:41] beauty the richness of the materials it
[1:26:43] doesn't matter he says i've got a white
[1:26:45] dress that you've got to put on
[1:26:47] and if you don't put it on then you
[1:26:49] can't be mine
[1:26:50] right wrong food wrong character wrong
[1:26:53] dress
[1:26:54] he says why that the shame that thou
[1:26:57] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[1:26:59] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:27:01] thine eyes with eyes have that thou may
[1:27:03] see that you can see that you're
[1:27:04] miserable naked that you don't have what
[1:27:07] you think you have right it's the eyes
[1:27:09] opening remember brother branham said
[1:27:11] there's people sitting in church and
[1:27:12] they're asleep and they don't know it
[1:27:15] their eyes are closed he wants you to
[1:27:17] wake up why the bridegroom's coming the
[1:27:19] bridegroom's coming get yourself ready
[1:27:22] according to the word amen
[1:27:26] he says what you need my clothes
[1:27:29] you need my robe it's the only way to
[1:27:31] get into this
[1:27:33] he says as many as i love i rebuke and
[1:27:36] chasten be zealous therefore and remain
[1:27:38] repent in the church age book the
[1:27:40] prophet said the zeal of this age is to
[1:27:42] do what
[1:27:43] repent why because it's a restoration
[1:27:47] age and restoration implies you're not
[1:27:50] where you should be that you're not what
[1:27:52] you're supposed to be so that means we
[1:27:54] start wrong and we become right there's
[1:27:57] no shame in repentance amen we ought to
[1:27:59] be repenting every day as he opens our
[1:28:02] eyes as he shows in our lives that there
[1:28:04] is a need we ought to say i'm sorry lord
[1:28:07] i
[1:28:08] maybe i knew it maybe i didn't know it
[1:28:10] but i'm sorry change me
[1:28:12] why that's why that's the zeal of this
[1:28:14] ages i'm sorry restore me back to what
[1:28:17] you told me i was going to be and then
[1:28:20] even our pastor has preached on it it's
[1:28:22] not just your soul it's not just your
[1:28:24] character but it's your body it's your
[1:28:26] marriage it's your relationship it's the
[1:28:28] way you walk it's the way you talk it's
[1:28:30] all being restored back to a bright
[1:28:32] image amen hallelujah
[1:28:35] amen what this walk with christ in this
[1:28:38] age has to involve repentance if we
[1:28:40] haven't repented something's wrong
[1:28:42] something is wrong because you haven't
[1:28:44] seen yourself through the eyes of the
[1:28:45] word and a change has to be made in your
[1:28:47] life amen
[1:28:49] what is it this is the end time church
[1:28:51] right here and what is it is they've
[1:28:53] come in and they've said we want the
[1:28:55] name so they put on the name of christ
[1:28:58] but they don't do anything else that he
[1:28:59] says do they
[1:29:00] right everybody calls themselves a
[1:29:02] christian these days that's why he has
[1:29:04] to call them bride is because christian
[1:29:05] has lost its meaning now right why
[1:29:08] because everybody seven women seven
[1:29:10] churches they've all come in seven
[1:29:13] churches
[1:29:14] seven women they all took his name but
[1:29:17] there was only one that gets his name
[1:29:19] amen and it's the same one that comes
[1:29:21] out right here amen same church here is
[1:29:24] right here amen
[1:29:25] seven women take his name and they're
[1:29:27] all same we're christ
[1:29:29] i've got the name of jesus christ
[1:29:32] but they don't do what he says
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:34] what is it they're not intimate with
[1:29:36] them they're not under the headship of
[1:29:37] christ they come in and say we'll
[1:29:38] provide for ourselves but we're not
[1:29:40] going to take anything you tell or you
[1:29:42] give amen they are self-sufficient women
[1:29:45] self-sufficient churches amen
[1:29:49] amen now jesus confirms this himself in
[1:29:51] matthew 7 he says many will say to me in
[1:29:53] that day lord lord have not we
[1:29:55] prophesied in thy name
[1:29:58] they have the name
[1:30:00] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[1:30:04] in thy name done many wonderful works
[1:30:06] and then i will profess unto you i never
[1:30:10] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:30:12] iniquity
[1:30:14] in my name in my name they came in it
[1:30:17] doesn't say he gave them the name it
[1:30:19] says they took the name
[1:30:21] he didn't give him the name he entered
[1:30:22] no relationship this is not a marriage
[1:30:24] because he says i never knew you there
[1:30:26] was never intimacy between me and you
[1:30:30] right you came in and said i'm
[1:30:32] identified with him and you ran out and
[1:30:33] did your thing but he says i never knew
[1:30:35] you there was no life that followed
[1:30:37] there was no relationship that followed
[1:30:39] that conversation amen
[1:30:41] he doesn't say they didn't prophesy he
[1:30:43] doesn't say they didn't cast out devils
[1:30:45] he didn't say they hadn't done many
[1:30:46] wonderful works why because in the name
[1:30:48] of jesus christ combined with faith you
[1:30:50] can do just about anything
[1:30:52] right why because god responds to faith
[1:30:55] god responds to faith it has nothing to
[1:30:57] do with do you have the holy ghost or
[1:30:59] not have the holy ghost if you believe
[1:31:01] all things are possible amen but there
[1:31:03] is a special portion for the bride
[1:31:05] because she is elected to do all of
[1:31:07] those things the greater works amen but
[1:31:10] you have people that can absolutely lay
[1:31:12] hands on somebody and heal them
[1:31:14] it's a gift of healing it's it's a gift
[1:31:16] it's without repentance it's outside of
[1:31:18] repentance amen but what they didn't get
[1:31:21] to a relationship they got to a place
[1:31:23] where they did all these works and he
[1:31:24] says depart from me you that work
[1:31:26] iniquity iniquity means you knew what to
[1:31:28] do and you didn't do it
[1:31:30] right and that's where they got trapped
[1:31:32] was that he told them what to do and
[1:31:33] they ignored it and they went through
[1:31:35] their own way and the proof is in the
[1:31:36] pudding as we say over here
[1:31:38] right and what is it there were no
[1:31:41] births
[1:31:42] there was no bursts out of those
[1:31:43] churches there's no bursts out of those
[1:31:45] denominations right there's no spiritual
[1:31:47] burst is what we're talking about right
[1:31:49] what there's no spiritual intimacy it's
[1:31:51] a it's a relationship of appearances
[1:31:54] only amen it's a farce it's a sham it's
[1:31:56] a marriage of convenience for the church
[1:31:58] itself and christ is not in any part of
[1:32:00] that brother brahm says this he says and
[1:32:02] when we take our pledge to christ if we
[1:32:05] don't become part of him like a woman
[1:32:07] ought to become part of a man and a man
[1:32:09] part of the woman then we're artificial
[1:32:12] christians
[1:32:13] we're not really you're just you're
[1:32:15] really not married to that woman you
[1:32:17] might be loyal if you don't love your
[1:32:19] husband and him 60 or 70 years old and
[1:32:22] you don't love him as good as you did at
[1:32:23] the beginning then you're really just
[1:32:25] raising his children
[1:32:27] wow
[1:32:29] something for the old folks
[1:32:32] do you love him as much as you did wow
[1:32:34] 60 or 70 years ago
[1:32:37] that's a long marriage
[1:32:39] that's the way the churches are too many
[1:32:42] today we're just taking the name of the
[1:32:44] christian church pretending to be the
[1:32:47] bride
[1:32:48] folks don't put this outside the message
[1:32:51] don't put this outside the message if
[1:32:53] you're going to hear anything today
[1:32:54] don't put it outside of the message what
[1:32:56] we are is we are identified with the
[1:32:58] message and we have no relationship with
[1:32:59] christ
[1:33:00] you've got to meet the the messenger the
[1:33:03] real messenger you got to you got to
[1:33:04] meet the king that sent the message amen
[1:33:06] because that's what eliezer came to do
[1:33:08] was introduce us to the one that sent
[1:33:10] the message he didn't have us stand here
[1:33:12] and just pour over the message he wanted
[1:33:14] to get us to the man that sent the
[1:33:15] message amen why because the message is
[1:33:18] a person it's not it's not something
[1:33:20] written down it's not something on tapes
[1:33:21] it's a living breathing organism it is
[1:33:23] god himself given to us amen
[1:33:26] he says that's the way the churches are
[1:33:27] today we're just taking the name of the
[1:33:29] christian church pretending to be the
[1:33:31] bride it's artificial we're not
[1:33:33] connected with christ in any way we're
[1:33:35] like an artificial tooth an artificial
[1:33:37] arm an artificial eye see it's something
[1:33:40] that's artificial if we're just putting
[1:33:42] it on well you can't put on christianity
[1:33:45] you've got to be connected with it
[1:33:47] and then a church that's just artificial
[1:33:49] called the church of christ well them
[1:33:51] children then are not in there that's
[1:33:53] born of that same organization they're
[1:33:55] not christ's children there are
[1:33:58] denominational children and not children
[1:34:00] of christ if the woman isn't connected
[1:34:02] with the man in trueness then it isn't
[1:34:04] her husband it's just a man she's taken
[1:34:08] a vow to live with
[1:34:10] and she took a wrong vow she pledged to
[1:34:12] love him she said she loved him and she
[1:34:15] didn't do it all the time the man is
[1:34:17] deceived but there's one thing sure
[1:34:20] friends we're not going to deceive
[1:34:22] christ he knows his own
[1:34:25] amen
[1:34:27] now jesus gives us even more details on
[1:34:29] these women these churches i mean we're
[1:34:31] talking to the sisters but we look at
[1:34:33] the type to the churches and then we
[1:34:34] bring it back to the sisters amen again
[1:34:36] we're talking about an attitude we're
[1:34:38] talking about a spirit that's what we're
[1:34:39] looking for here matthew 24 jesus said
[1:34:42] unto them take heed that no man deceive
[1:34:45] you for many shall come in my name
[1:34:47] saying i am christ and shall deceive
[1:34:50] many
[1:34:51] then if any man shall say unto you lo
[1:34:53] here is christ or there believe it not
[1:34:55] for there shall arise false christs and
[1:34:57] false prophets and shall show great
[1:34:59] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:35:02] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:35:05] very elect now we take great hope in
[1:35:07] that because it says if it were possible
[1:35:09] but it's not possible amen we're not
[1:35:12] going to be fooled we're not going to be
[1:35:13] overcome by the spirit if we're the true
[1:35:15] bride amen he says behold i have told
[1:35:18] you before wherefore if they shall say
[1:35:20] unto you behold he is in the desert go
[1:35:23] not forth behold he is in the secret
[1:35:25] chambers believe it not for as the
[1:35:27] lightning cometh out of the east and
[1:35:29] shineth even unto the west so shall also
[1:35:32] the coming of the son of man be for
[1:35:35] wheresoever the carcass is there where
[1:35:38] the eagles be gathered together so he
[1:35:40] says the identification of the
[1:35:41] anti-bride is they'll say go here go
[1:35:44] there go to this ministry go to this
[1:35:46] church go in the desert go in the secret
[1:35:48] chamber come to our place sit with our
[1:35:50] group he says that is never my identity
[1:35:53] that is never where you're going to find
[1:35:54] christ the anointed one
[1:35:56] he says but where will you find him
[1:35:58] where the carcass is there where the
[1:36:00] eagles be gathered together what is it
[1:36:02] around the fresh killed word for your
[1:36:05] day that's the identification of the
[1:36:07] bride spirit amen and it's not just
[1:36:09] gathered around amen as john in the book
[1:36:12] of revelation you can't just go up and
[1:36:14] say give me the book you've got to eat
[1:36:16] it right you've got to partake of it
[1:36:18] it's got to become a part of you and
[1:36:20] it's got to push out and cause growth
[1:36:22] and strength and you to develop into
[1:36:23] what you are supposed to be amen that's
[1:36:26] got to have an effect of the word in
[1:36:28] your life amen is the kingdom of heaven
[1:36:30] being manifested in you
[1:36:32] because if it's not something's wrong
[1:36:34] something's wrong with what you're
[1:36:35] eating or something's wrong with what
[1:36:37] you're not eating amen
[1:36:40] amen do you believe doctrine or do you
[1:36:42] eat doctrine
[1:36:43] right do you apply it or do you just
[1:36:46] believe it is it just in your head or is
[1:36:47] it in your life and in your heart amen
[1:36:50] amen there is a real deal there is a
[1:36:51] real bride and he points to her and he
[1:36:53] says she's going to be gathered around
[1:36:54] the fresh kill of the word amen and
[1:36:56] there is a real bridegroom
[1:36:58] right we've got a satanic bridegroom and
[1:37:00] we've got christ the bridegroom we've
[1:37:01] got satan's church and we've got christ
[1:37:03] church that called out elected ones amen
[1:37:05] and there is a real union and it
[1:37:06] produces real results and we see it in
[1:37:09] isaiah 4 verse 2
[1:37:11] it says in that day so in that day where
[1:37:13] everything turns into a prostitute and
[1:37:15] everything goes into desolation and ruin
[1:37:17] he says in that day shall the branch of
[1:37:20] the lord be beautiful and glorious and
[1:37:23] the fruit of the earth shall be
[1:37:25] excellent and comely for them that are
[1:37:27] escaped of israel so in the midst of all
[1:37:29] of these messed up churches all these
[1:37:31] messed up people out of it comes
[1:37:33] something that god calls beautiful and
[1:37:34] glorious and it is his bride remember in
[1:37:37] that quote brother brown says if it ever
[1:37:39] puts forth another branch and it will
[1:37:42] she will do the greater works amen this
[1:37:45] is the beautiful branch that he's
[1:37:46] talking about here out of all of that
[1:37:48] comes something that god calls beautiful
[1:37:51] and glorious amen it says the fruit of
[1:37:53] the earth shall be excellent and comely
[1:37:54] that means it's going to be attractive
[1:37:56] it's going to be desirable to somebody
[1:37:58] amen so that's this time remember as
[1:38:01] much as we're looking at the the
[1:38:02] contrast the negative now he's showing
[1:38:04] the positive and he says there's got to
[1:38:06] be something good coming out of your
[1:38:07] lives folks church there's got to be
[1:38:09] something beautiful and glorious and
[1:38:10] what is it it's manifesting time right
[1:38:13] the fruits are coming out and people are
[1:38:14] starting to see do you really believe
[1:38:16] and do you really have what you believe
[1:38:18] or are you just what a make-believe
[1:38:20] christian amen
[1:38:22] what is it he says they're what the ones
[1:38:24] that escaped
[1:38:26] remember brother brahm says the ones
[1:38:28] that got away the ones that escaped he
[1:38:29] says it here the ones that escaped it's
[1:38:31] somebody that got away
[1:38:33] the lucky ones the called out ones amen
[1:38:36] it shall come to pass that he that is
[1:38:38] left in zion that means there's not many
[1:38:41] there's a few left he that is left in
[1:38:43] zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem
[1:38:45] shall be called holy even every one that
[1:38:48] is written among the living in jerusalem
[1:38:50] when the lord shall have washed away the
[1:38:52] filth of the daughters of zion
[1:38:55] all this filth
[1:38:56] washed away
[1:38:58] because we've got to be we've got to be
[1:38:59] spotless right we've got to be spotless
[1:39:02] so it's all got to be washed away
[1:39:04] and shall have purged the blood of
[1:39:06] jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
[1:39:08] spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
[1:39:10] burning now how does he wash us
[1:39:13] how does he wash us paul said what by
[1:39:15] the washing of water by the word
[1:39:18] right it's not by actions
[1:39:21] it's not by actions it's by the washing
[1:39:22] of water of the word amen and that
[1:39:25] brings us to a place where we are
[1:39:26] spotless pure and white amen
[1:39:31] and the lord will create upon every
[1:39:33] dwelling place of mount zion
[1:39:36] mount zion is always the
[1:39:38] bride right so on every dwelling place
[1:39:42] where are the dwelling places in mount
[1:39:44] zion
[1:39:45] one two three four five six seven eight
[1:39:47] nine ten twenty four three
[1:39:49] these are the dwelling places in mount
[1:39:51] zion you are the tabernacle of god right
[1:39:54] right he says on every one of us
[1:39:57] will be and upon her assemblies so when
[1:40:00] we all come together what do we have
[1:40:03] a church we have a multi-member bride
[1:40:05] body so on every one of us individually
[1:40:07] and upon every congregation a cloud and
[1:40:11] a smoke by day and a shining of a
[1:40:14] flaming fire by night for upon all the
[1:40:17] glory shall be a defense we are his
[1:40:19] glory so he says on every one of us
[1:40:21] individually and on every one of us as
[1:40:23] we gather together there is a spirit of
[1:40:26] what protection
[1:40:28] leadership and provision what the light
[1:40:31] shows us the way it guides us it
[1:40:33] protects us from the sun it shades us
[1:40:36] right he gives us everything we have
[1:40:37] need of he says on every one of us
[1:40:39] there's going to be that spirit and
[1:40:40] there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow
[1:40:43] in the day from the heart from the heat
[1:40:46] and for a place of refuge and for a
[1:40:49] covert from storm and from rain this is
[1:40:52] a time of storm and rain isn't it the
[1:40:53] earth is what groaning and travailing
[1:40:55] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:40:58] and what it's not just physical it's not
[1:41:00] just the climate it's in our lives it's
[1:41:02] in our careers it's in our families it's
[1:41:03] in our marriages it's in every part
[1:41:05] there's a rain in a storm that's coming
[1:41:07] he says then i'll protect you from all
[1:41:08] of it
[1:41:09] what
[1:41:10] brother branham takes us all the way
[1:41:11] through this i don't need to say my own
[1:41:13] words because he walks us right through
[1:41:14] it he says isaiah 4 5.
[1:41:16] now listen he's talking of the coming of
[1:41:18] the lord how that women will be so
[1:41:20] immoral he said seven women listen let's
[1:41:22] just read it look here and in that day
[1:41:24] seven women shall take a hold of one man
[1:41:26] saying we'll eat our own bread wear our
[1:41:28] own apparel only let us be called by thy
[1:41:30] name to take away our reproach
[1:41:32] that's the end time where we're living
[1:41:34] now marriage divorce prostitution and
[1:41:37] whatever
[1:41:38] he says in that day shall the branch of
[1:41:41] the lord be beautiful and glorious the
[1:41:43] fruit of the earth shall be excellent
[1:41:44] and comely of them that escaped of
[1:41:46] israel he says how you escaped all that
[1:41:48] damnation can you say praise the lord
[1:41:50] that you've escaped the damnation amen
[1:41:52] that he has woken you up that he's
[1:41:53] opened your eyes that you're in a pickle
[1:41:57] it's not a phrase we probably use in
[1:41:58] french that you're in us you're in a
[1:41:59] place of trouble right that you're in a
[1:42:01] time of war that you're caught unless he
[1:42:04] can get you out
[1:42:05] amen
[1:42:07] glory he says and it shall come to pass
[1:42:09] that he that is left in zion he that's a
[1:42:11] remnant in jerusalem shall be called
[1:42:13] holy even every one that is written
[1:42:15] among the living in jerusalem wherein
[1:42:17] the lord shall have washed away the
[1:42:19] filth of the daughter of zion he says
[1:42:22] remember that's always the bride see and
[1:42:25] shall have purified the blood of
[1:42:26] jerusalem that's the remnant of the jews
[1:42:29] plus the bride and in the midst of with
[1:42:31] the spirit of judgment and fire
[1:42:34] he says this there's always god's
[1:42:36] judgment when he makes his final
[1:42:38] judgment he calls you
[1:42:40] he justifies you and brings you to
[1:42:43] redemption
[1:42:44] then his judgment breaks forth upon you
[1:42:48] and the holy ghost and fire cleanses
[1:42:50] away the sin and then you're his
[1:42:54] amen there's got to be what a spirit of
[1:42:56] judgment and fire upon you not judgment
[1:42:59] to condemn you but judgment to put away
[1:43:01] that which was already paid for at
[1:43:03] calvary it's been judged you are no
[1:43:05] longer associated with it it is divorced
[1:43:08] from you
[1:43:09] and on top of it he puts his holy spirit
[1:43:12] fire on top of you and cleanses away all
[1:43:14] of it he says then you're his now you
[1:43:16] always were his but he says when you're
[1:43:19] cleaned by the holy spirit when the holy
[1:43:20] spirit falls on you that's when you are
[1:43:22] identified as his amen why because his
[1:43:25] life is now in you that is the
[1:43:26] consummation of the marriage amen that's
[1:43:29] proof that he has been intimate with you
[1:43:31] that he has revealed himself to you in a
[1:43:32] way that he doesn't reveal to just
[1:43:34] anybody
[1:43:35] amen the same thing he does to the earth
[1:43:37] when he purges it with fire and by the
[1:43:39] spirit of burning he says now look
[1:43:41] listen are you ready
[1:43:44] amen amen so there's a beauty that he's
[1:43:47] calling us to and that beauty is going
[1:43:49] to include holy ghost spirit and it's
[1:43:51] going to bring forth what fire that
[1:43:53] cleanses away the filth of the world
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:56] amen those sisters the world is going to
[1:43:58] look at you and guess what they're not
[1:44:00] going to be attracted to the beauty that
[1:44:02] you offer
[1:44:03] no no no they're looking for what
[1:44:05] sensuality they're looking for skin
[1:44:06] they're looking for exaggeration they're
[1:44:08] looking for that outward expression of
[1:44:10] beauty what you have is never going to
[1:44:12] draw the world right it can't it can't
[1:44:15] because what you have the same beauty of
[1:44:16] christ and then you've got the beauty
[1:44:18] that attracts him to you right
[1:44:20] so we see three elements in this we read
[1:44:22] that the bride is beautiful and glorious
[1:44:24] to god
[1:44:26] to god not to everyone else but to god
[1:44:29] she is excellent and comely to the
[1:44:31] onlooker that is of the same mind
[1:44:34] right so you're not even going to
[1:44:35] attract maybe the churches out there
[1:44:37] because they're not of the same mind
[1:44:39] right but ye have the mind of christ
[1:44:41] right if they don't have the mind of
[1:44:42] christ then they're not going to be
[1:44:43] attracted to your beauty are they and he
[1:44:45] says what in verse 3 it brings holiness
[1:44:48] there is a holiness that is beautiful to
[1:44:50] god amen now that's quite a standard for
[1:44:52] us to match up to beautiful glorious
[1:44:55] excellent comely and holy
[1:44:57] and that's for everyone that's not just
[1:44:59] sisters that's brothers and sisters
[1:45:00] alike because we are all a member of the
[1:45:02] bride of christ but then he brings it
[1:45:04] down to the sisters directly amen amen
[1:45:07] amen
[1:45:08] we want to read in first chronicles 16
[1:45:10] 29
[1:45:11] it says give unto the lord the glory do
[1:45:14] unto his name bring an offering
[1:45:17] and come before him worship the lord in
[1:45:19] the beauty
[1:45:21] of holiness
[1:45:23] amen
[1:45:25] worship god in the beauty of holiness
[1:45:26] what is the beauty of holiness it is
[1:45:28] obedience to the word of god and that's
[1:45:30] why i say this is not only for the
[1:45:31] sisters this is for the brothers amen
[1:45:33] we're talking about the universal bride
[1:45:35] of christ here not just the women now
[1:45:38] listen this is an amazing one psalm 50
[1:45:40] verse 2 it says out of zion
[1:45:42] out of the bride the perfection of
[1:45:45] beauty
[1:45:46] god has shined
[1:45:49] you
[1:45:49] are what the perfection of beauty
[1:45:53] you are the perfection of god's beauty
[1:45:55] now that's again to all of us as the
[1:45:57] members of the bride of christ but you
[1:45:58] sisters you are the perfection of the
[1:46:01] beauty because remember when we read in
[1:46:02] the last service where it said what the
[1:46:05] women are a reflection of the church so
[1:46:07] if you want to see where the church is
[1:46:09] look at the women and if they're doing
[1:46:11] right if they're living right if they've
[1:46:12] got the right attitude they got the
[1:46:13] right spirit then what god's in that
[1:46:15] church and if they don't then
[1:46:17] something's wrong in the church amen
[1:46:20] it's that simple
[1:46:21] it's that simple
[1:46:23] and then he hasn't made it difficult for
[1:46:24] us amen so god's shining through what a
[1:46:27] reflective bride so that they can see
[1:46:28] the same beauty that he had two thousand
[1:46:30] years ago right two thousand years ago
[1:46:33] it said for he shall grow up before him
[1:46:34] as a tender plant and as a root out of a
[1:46:37] dry ground
[1:46:38] he had no form nor comeliness and when
[1:46:41] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[1:46:42] we should desire him it's like i said to
[1:46:45] our sisters if you're looking to wow the
[1:46:46] world with your beauty you are beautiful
[1:46:49] don't think you're not beautiful but
[1:46:50] you're not beautiful in the way that
[1:46:51] they think you should be beautiful amen
[1:46:53] they want you to show more right show
[1:46:55] all your assets and hide nothing right
[1:46:57] and we're saying hide a lot and show
[1:46:59] very little right and let whatever scene
[1:47:02] let it be christ amen what they're
[1:47:04] trying to do the big wow factor and
[1:47:05] you're trying to do
[1:47:06] not the opposite of that amen that's
[1:47:08] satan's pride that's trying to do that
[1:47:10] amen remember we're speaking about
[1:47:11] beauty and the bride so her beauty is a
[1:47:13] reflection of his and here it says there
[1:47:15] is no form or comeliness no beauty that
[1:47:17] looking on him we should desire him i
[1:47:19] mean that's the way our sisters are
[1:47:20] supposed to be right it's not something
[1:47:22] that draws the world first peter 3 as we
[1:47:25] start to close
[1:47:26] likewise you wives be in subjection to
[1:47:29] your own husbands that if
[1:47:30] that if any obey not the word they also
[1:47:33] may be with they also may without the
[1:47:36] words be won by the conversation of the
[1:47:37] wives now there's two things here one
[1:47:39] conversation is the life not just the
[1:47:42] words it's the life you live it says let
[1:47:44] them be one by your life not just by
[1:47:45] your words amen it says while they
[1:47:48] behold your chaste conversation coupled
[1:47:50] with fear
[1:47:51] now the amplifies it says when they
[1:47:53] observe the pure and modest way in which
[1:47:56] you conduct yourselves
[1:47:57] together with your reverence for your
[1:47:59] husband you are to feel for him all that
[1:48:02] reverence includes including to respect
[1:48:05] defer to and revere him to honor esteem
[1:48:08] appreciate prize and in the human sense
[1:48:11] to adore him that is to admire praise be
[1:48:14] devoted to deeply love and enjoy your
[1:48:17] husband and all the brothers said
[1:48:19] hallelujah praise the lord
[1:48:22] right
[1:48:23] and all the sisters said please god no
[1:48:26] right
[1:48:27] right because why he's not always
[1:48:30] i'm not always worthy of adoration and
[1:48:32] praise in fact i would say the majority
[1:48:33] of the time i'm not
[1:48:35] right
[1:48:36] not worthy of of the looking up to that
[1:48:38] you're asked to do right if you're a
[1:48:41] wife
[1:48:42] right but remember when we read that
[1:48:43] word wives previously that is not just
[1:48:46] to the wives that are married it says to
[1:48:48] those that are any women whether they
[1:48:50] are unmarried married or widowed so
[1:48:53] every woman is supposed to have the
[1:48:55] attitude that he's talking about here
[1:48:58] right nobody gets away right but that's
[1:49:00] a beautiful thing
[1:49:02] right we all have the same standard
[1:49:04] right we all have the same standard uh
[1:49:05] one sister doesn't get to act different
[1:49:07] from another sister one brother doesn't
[1:49:08] get that different from another brother
[1:49:10] we're all held to the same standard amen
[1:49:12] he says now this in verse three whose
[1:49:14] adorning let it not be that outward
[1:49:17] adorning of plating the hair and of
[1:49:19] wearing of gold and of putting on of
[1:49:21] apparel now if i look around this church
[1:49:22] right now i see gold i see plated hair i
[1:49:26] can't tell you if your clothes are
[1:49:27] expensive or not
[1:49:29] everyone it seems like takes a scripture
[1:49:31] and they say don't braid your hair don't
[1:49:32] wear gold or jewelry or don't wear fancy
[1:49:34] clothes that's not what peter said here
[1:49:37] it's not what he's saying he's saying
[1:49:38] you're not allowed to do it he says your
[1:49:40] adornment is not supposed to be that
[1:49:42] he's saying your outside appearance is
[1:49:44] not what's supposed to be your adornment
[1:49:46] right because what it is is you're
[1:49:47] putting something on the outside to try
[1:49:50] and make it look like you're something
[1:49:51] he says your adornment can't be an
[1:49:53] outward thing
[1:49:54] right that adornment means ornament
[1:49:57] decoration accessorizing or
[1:49:59] beautification
[1:50:01] so he's saying that's not what makes you
[1:50:03] beautiful
[1:50:04] in other words he didn't say you can't
[1:50:06] wear it he said that's not what's going
[1:50:08] to make you beautiful this is not what
[1:50:09] makes you godly this is not what makes
[1:50:10] you holy this is not what attracts
[1:50:12] people to you is that it may attract it
[1:50:14] but he says this is not what's beautiful
[1:50:16] to god he says in verse 4 but rather
[1:50:19] what let it let your adornment let your
[1:50:22] beautiful accessories be the hidden man
[1:50:25] of the heart in that which is not
[1:50:28] corruptable even the ornament of a meek
[1:50:31] and quiet spirit which is in the sight
[1:50:34] of god of great price now guess what if
[1:50:36] you want your hair done beautifully if
[1:50:37] you want gold if you want beautiful
[1:50:39] clothes it's going to cost you a lot
[1:50:40] it's of great value isn't it and he says
[1:50:42] the thing that god finds of great value
[1:50:44] is when you put on a meek and a quiet
[1:50:47] spirit that's the thing that god finds
[1:50:48] beautiful and that's the thing that god
[1:50:50] finds of great value but the trap for
[1:50:52] our sisters is that they'll go to verse
[1:50:54] 3 and they'll change the way they look
[1:50:56] and say that makes me beautiful
[1:50:58] but he didn't say change your clothes he
[1:51:00] said change your heart amen right he
[1:51:02] said change your attitude change get a
[1:51:04] character change because that's what's
[1:51:06] most valuable to me the outside i don't
[1:51:08] i'm not too worried too much about
[1:51:10] whether or not you have rich clothes or
[1:51:11] poor clothes lots of jewelry not much
[1:51:13] jewelry we're supposed to be modest men
[1:51:15] and women alike we're not supposed to be
[1:51:16] flashy right that's not the way it's
[1:51:18] supposed to be but he says what god's
[1:51:19] looking for is what a meek and quiet
[1:51:21] spirit which is in the sight of god
[1:51:24] great price for after this manner in the
[1:51:26] old time the women also who trusted in
[1:51:30] god adorn themselves being in subjection
[1:51:33] under their own husbands now i want you
[1:51:34] to catch what it says there it says a
[1:51:36] meek and quiet spirit is a sign that a
[1:51:38] woman trusts god
[1:51:40] right why because she hasn't doesn't
[1:51:43] have to fight for what she needs or even
[1:51:45] what she deserves
[1:51:47] she is able to let go she is able to
[1:51:49] trust and let god do what he promised he
[1:51:51] would do
[1:51:52] right that's why she's able to trust and
[1:51:54] have that meek and quiet spirit is
[1:51:56] because she knows that god is on her
[1:51:58] side and he's the one that's going to
[1:51:59] make it right the next verse confirms
[1:52:01] this it says even as sarah obeyed
[1:52:04] abraham calling him lord whose daughters
[1:52:07] ye are as long as ye do well and are not
[1:52:10] afraid with any amazement and then sarah
[1:52:12] is one of the one that's mentioned in
[1:52:14] the chapter of faith isn't it right
[1:52:15] she's a she's a sister of faith she's a
[1:52:17] woman of faith
[1:52:19] that second half says and you are now
[1:52:21] her true daughters if you do right and
[1:52:23] let nothing terrify you
[1:52:25] not giving way to hysterical fears or
[1:52:28] letting anxieties unnerve you now look
[1:52:31] at sarah what was she unnerved about
[1:52:34] she has a promise to bring forth life
[1:52:36] and nothing's happening
[1:52:38] right
[1:52:38] and the funny thing is is god forgets
[1:52:40] everything she ever did because in the
[1:52:42] end she believed right but she had all
[1:52:44] sorts of faults and failures in there
[1:52:46] didn't she she tried to have somebody
[1:52:48] else have the baby for her it only
[1:52:49] bought problems she went in with her
[1:52:51] husband on these little schemes to try
[1:52:52] and protect her in these different
[1:52:53] things she was not full of faith but in
[1:52:55] the end she had the faith that was
[1:52:57] required to bring forth the promise amen
[1:52:59] that's what our trust is is that through
[1:53:01] our faults and failures amen if we can
[1:53:03] let ourselves just trust and relax at
[1:53:05] some point now god has a chance to do it
[1:53:08] they say that when women that can have
[1:53:10] children once they just once they
[1:53:12] realize i can't have children and they
[1:53:14] stop trying to have children that's when
[1:53:16] they have children
[1:53:18] did you know that
[1:53:19] not always it's not a rule but when they
[1:53:21] relax
[1:53:22] when the stress goes away when they go
[1:53:24] back to just having a relationship with
[1:53:26] their husband when they go back to just
[1:53:28] living the way they were supposed to be
[1:53:29] living in the first place magically a
[1:53:32] baby appears why because the stress was
[1:53:34] what was holding back the fruit
[1:53:36] right it clamped down on their body and
[1:53:38] it could not bring a manifestation right
[1:53:41] they couldn't conceive because of the
[1:53:42] stress but when they let go when they
[1:53:44] trusted when they relaxed when they
[1:53:46] didn't try and bring it forth all of a
[1:53:48] sudden babies show up and they go in
[1:53:50] they get in virtual
[1:53:51] fertilization they have three kids
[1:53:53] because that's the way it usually works
[1:53:54] out then they go home relax and they
[1:53:55] have another two or three because their
[1:53:57] system is finally relaxed right it's an
[1:53:59] amazing thing this is the effect of the
[1:54:01] holy spirit in the life of a sister is
[1:54:03] that meek and quiet spirit amen so often
[1:54:05] what we're doing is we're planning for
[1:54:07] god to fail we're planning for men to
[1:54:08] fail and we're not letting the word do
[1:54:10] what it says it would do right he's
[1:54:11] saying you got to trust and that's where
[1:54:13] the meekness and quietness comes from is
[1:54:15] when you trust it's not in the quality
[1:54:17] of your husband it's not in the quality
[1:54:19] of us it will never be the quality of
[1:54:21] the man you're married to or the father
[1:54:23] you're sitting under it'll be because
[1:54:25] you trust the god that put him in your
[1:54:27] life in the first place amen it's a
[1:54:29] beautiful thing when we can let go amen
[1:54:32] now all of the
[1:54:33] mild-natured sisters are saying
[1:54:35] hallelujah inside
[1:54:38] and all of the feisty ones are saying
[1:54:40] this isn't fair
[1:54:42] right
[1:54:43] it's true it's true because guess what i
[1:54:46] was talking to another couple earlier
[1:54:47] and he was saying my wife's very feisty
[1:54:48] i've got a feisty wife right
[1:54:51] right
[1:54:52] a number of us have feisty wives
[1:54:56] some of us have very meek and mild wives
[1:54:58] right and what we do is we look at that
[1:55:00] and we say well they're naturally gifted
[1:55:02] to to answer the scripture
[1:55:04] right but it says what every one of us
[1:55:06] has a battle right and guess what some
[1:55:09] of us are going to fight one way and
[1:55:11] some of us are going to fight another
[1:55:12] and here's the thing he doesn't say you
[1:55:14] had to start with a meek and quiet
[1:55:15] spirit he says you had to finish right
[1:55:18] this is a process if you think if us men
[1:55:20] think we're ready to go in a rapture and
[1:55:22] our lives are perfect and our
[1:55:23] leadership's perfect and our marriages
[1:55:25] are perfect then we're deluded aren't we
[1:55:27] we're deluded why because it's a process
[1:55:29] god is growing us into it and it's the
[1:55:30] same thing for our sisters amen you may
[1:55:32] start feisty but guess what god will
[1:55:34] grow you got to mature you right god
[1:55:37] will bring you through it god will put
[1:55:38] you through a marriage where you're
[1:55:39] going to be put through the ringer right
[1:55:41] maybe he'll leave you single where i'll
[1:55:42] put you through the ringer remember
[1:55:44] god's got a way of bringing you to what
[1:55:45] he wants you to be amen but every one of
[1:55:47] us has to do it but although you know if
[1:55:49] you're meek and mild the problem is
[1:55:51] you're going to face other struggles
[1:55:52] because you'll be so meek and mild that
[1:55:54] you won't do anything
[1:55:55] right you'll struggle to get up and go
[1:55:57] because you're so meek and mild and in
[1:55:59] such subjection or in under such
[1:56:02] authority in a way that you think you
[1:56:03] can't do anything and that's further
[1:56:04] from the truth as well right so every
[1:56:06] there's two sides to every coin and
[1:56:08] we're not going to go into it today for
[1:56:09] the sake of time and for our poor
[1:56:10] translator but we'll see what it looks
[1:56:12] like because god's got to work on you
[1:56:14] one way or another so whether you've got
[1:56:15] a great starting attitude or you don't
[1:56:17] have a great starting attitude god's
[1:56:18] going to be working no matter what
[1:56:20] because there's something that's got to
[1:56:21] change in you amen
[1:56:23] we'll finish with this final quote
[1:56:25] he says
[1:56:27] now a woman is not meant to have an iron
[1:56:31] disposition
[1:56:32] she is according to the holy scripture
[1:56:34] to be submissive to the male that is
[1:56:36] commanded of her
[1:56:38] women listen to this a woman who is
[1:56:40] truly female all female will be of that
[1:56:42] disposition
[1:56:44] not a doormat
[1:56:45] because that's where they end up so
[1:56:47] often right and that's poor teaching
[1:56:49] that's poor teaching to the brothers or
[1:56:51] they just want it that is not she is not
[1:56:53] your doormat brother brown said she is
[1:56:55] your queen
[1:56:57] because why we are his queen are we a
[1:56:59] doormat to christ does christ treat us
[1:57:02] like a doormat no so why are we treating
[1:57:04] women like a doormat you can't do it she
[1:57:06] is the next best thing to salvation
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:10] that's hardly a doormat in my mind right
[1:57:12] she is your other half
[1:57:15] so you're saying you have a bad half and
[1:57:16] a good half
[1:57:18] right do you suppress half
[1:57:20] you don't want to do that she's not a
[1:57:22] doormat
[1:57:23] that is command sorry no real mail makes
[1:57:26] a female a doormat no real mail there
[1:57:28] you go brothers there's your standard
[1:57:29] are you a real male if you've got your
[1:57:31] wife or your daughters as doormats
[1:57:33] there's a problem amen
[1:57:37] no real male makes a female a doormat
[1:57:39] but she will want
[1:57:42] to be
[1:57:43] under authority and not rule over the
[1:57:47] mail
[1:57:48] wow
[1:57:49] tough sisters
[1:57:51] let me read it again
[1:57:53] she will want she'll want
[1:57:57] shall want
[1:57:58] it's a desire that's a holy ghost desire
[1:58:00] there is no way you want to be put under
[1:58:02] my leadership
[1:58:04] or your husband's leadership or your
[1:58:05] father's leadership or your pastor's
[1:58:07] leadership because we are all faulty but
[1:58:10] he says you will want it
[1:58:11] you will want to be under authority and
[1:58:13] not rule over the mail for he is the
[1:58:15] head of the house if she breaks that
[1:58:17] image that god made for her she is
[1:58:20] perverted
[1:58:21] any male that lets the woman take
[1:58:23] authority has also broken that image and
[1:58:26] he is perverted
[1:58:28] powerful words this is why a woman
[1:58:30] cannot wear that which pertain it to a
[1:58:32] man or cut her hair
[1:58:35] because what hair is a sign that you're
[1:58:37] under authority when you cut it it's
[1:58:38] rebellion
[1:58:40] she is never to wear garments that
[1:58:41] pertain to a male or cut her hair when
[1:58:44] she does she is intruding into the male
[1:58:46] domain taking authority and perverting
[1:58:50] herself and we saw what happened when
[1:58:52] she perverts herself it leads to ruined
[1:58:54] and destruction to those that are around
[1:58:55] her
[1:58:56] and when a woman invades the pulpit
[1:58:58] which is commanded she must not do she
[1:59:00] shows what spirit she is of
[1:59:02] being a dominating female is antichrist
[1:59:06] and the seeds of the roman catholic
[1:59:08] church are in her
[1:59:10] wow that's the great
[1:59:14] the great the seeds of the great
[1:59:16] are in you
[1:59:17] if
[1:59:18] you what have a dominating spirit
[1:59:21] he says though she may deny this ever so
[1:59:24] vehemently
[1:59:26] i'm mild i'm meek
[1:59:28] let your action show it
[1:59:30] amen not your words he says but when it
[1:59:32] comes to the word let god be true and
[1:59:36] every man's word a lie
[1:59:37] amen amen god bless you let's stand
[1:59:40] together if you would
[1:59:42] amen hopefully brother gus was able to
[1:59:44] keep up with me
[1:59:45] i had every i'm a fast speaker at the
[1:59:47] best of times and when you get going
[1:59:49] it's hard to stop
[1:59:51] but he was doing pretty good with
[1:59:52] brother gerald so i think he held up
[1:59:53] with me amen and then these are strong
[1:59:55] words
[1:59:56] sisters brothers equally a challenge
[1:59:58] amen
[1:59:59] amen
[2:00:00] like i said if you're not like this
[2:00:02] naturally
[2:00:03] welcome to the club
[2:00:05] right
[2:00:05] i'm not everything that god called us to
[2:00:07] be i'm not everything he wants me to be
[2:00:10] yet
[2:00:10] amen we've all got to change we've all
[2:00:12] got to grow god's got to work on us
[2:00:14] sometimes he does it one-on-one
[2:00:16] sometimes he uses the body amen as iron
[2:00:18] sharpeneth iron as the scripture says
[2:00:20] amen will rub off the high spots and the
[2:00:22] rough spots on each other over time he
[2:00:24] meant but each one of us god is molding
[2:00:26] and shaping into what a part of that
[2:00:28] perfect image of that bride i've been
[2:00:30] listening to the masterpiece this week
[2:00:31] and you know what he says we are
[2:00:34] the last masterpiece the bride is the
[2:00:36] last masterpiece she was struck off of
[2:00:38] his side and he's putting her back in
[2:00:40] and that completes the perfect image of
[2:00:42] god and that's what he's looking for
[2:00:44] amen that's the picture we're trying to
[2:00:45] paint we did it with the brothers and
[2:00:46] we're doing it with the sisters we don't
[2:00:48] just want to tell you what you're not we
[2:00:49] want to tell you what you are we want to
[2:00:51] show you how the word looks when it
[2:00:52] lives inside of you amen we want to take
[2:00:54] it off the doctrine and off the pages of
[2:00:56] the message and off the pages of your
[2:00:57] bible and put it into a living life that
[2:00:59] other people can see so they can see
[2:01:01] christ before you ever open up your your
[2:01:03] mouth amen before you ever say something
[2:01:05] amen
[2:01:06] amen like i said before we don't want to
[2:01:08] just have truth we want to be truth and
[2:01:10] maybe we want truth to be a person we
[2:01:12] want to be a personality not just words
[2:01:15] that we say amen
[2:01:16] let's close our eyes
[2:01:18] heavenly father
[2:01:20] lord is always such a challenge this
[2:01:22] morning lord for men and women alike
[2:01:24] and lord may we just humble ourselves
[2:01:26] before your word now we pray
[2:01:28] lord may you just come in
[2:01:30] lord as we heard that spirit of of fire
[2:01:32] and judgment lord
[2:01:34] not to judge us to hell lord but to take
