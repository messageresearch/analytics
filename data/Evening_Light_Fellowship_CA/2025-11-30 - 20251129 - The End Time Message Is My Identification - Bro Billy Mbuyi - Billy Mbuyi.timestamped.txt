[32:38] to the ground.
[32:41] Bound up with wings
[32:46] [music]

[34:57] just once more, Lord.
[34:59] On [music]
[35:00] bended knees,

[35:06] touch of the hem of [singing] your
[35:09] garment. It brought change
[35:13] and full [singing] deliverance.
[35:16] So I [music] am casting all fear.
[35:20] There's power in prayer.

[1:06:26] the scriptures and we see what God has
[1:06:28] for us tonight. Amen. You know, the word
[1:06:31] of God is the the very fountain of life
[1:06:34] and and I believe it's endless. Every
[1:06:36] time we open, he always has something
[1:06:38] for us. Let's open in Philippians
[1:06:40] chapter 2. We read verse 5. We'll start
[1:06:43] at verse five.
[1:06:46] Philippians chapter 2
[1:06:50] in the fifth verse,
[1:06:53] a very familiar scripture reading. He
[1:06:55] said, "Let this mind be in you, which
[1:06:57] was also in Christ, whom being in the
[1:07:01] form of God, thought it not robbery to
[1:07:03] be equal with God, but made himself of
[1:07:08] no reputation, and took upon him the
[1:07:11] form of a servant. and he was made in
[1:07:14] the likeness of men. And being found in
[1:07:16] fashion as a man, he humbled himself,
[1:07:19] and became obedience unto death, even
[1:07:22] the death of the cross. Wherefore God
[1:07:24] also has highly exalted him, and give
[1:07:28] him a name which is above all every
[1:07:30] name, that at the name of Jesus, that
[1:07:32] every knee should bow of things in
[1:07:35] heaven, on things in earth, and things
[1:07:37] under the earth, and that every tongue
[1:07:40] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[1:07:43] to the glory of God the Father. Gracious
[1:07:46] Father, we ask you bless your word once
[1:07:48] again to us. In the name of the Lord
[1:07:49] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. have your
[1:07:52] seats tonight.
[1:08:00] Man, I just want to say uh
[1:08:04] um
[1:08:05] before I announce my title, the this
[1:08:09] scripture uh means so much to me and and
[1:08:12] the Lord and I want to give a title um
[1:08:16] the end time message is my
[1:08:19] identification
[1:08:21] and and we'll see just where we go with
[1:08:23] that. the the it's important as we read
[1:08:27] the message that uh God wants us as his
[1:08:30] children to approach him with
[1:08:32] confidence. Uh he wants us to know who
[1:08:35] we are, where we came from, how we came
[1:08:38] to be about here and and he's given us
[1:08:41] this message to uh so that in this dark
[1:08:45] generation that we live in, God don't
[1:08:47] want us to be confused. We live in such
[1:08:49] a confused time and you know the devil
[1:08:52] is the author of confusion. He tries by
[1:08:56] every mean to confuse us even within our
[1:08:58] own minds because the scripture says the
[1:09:00] battle is in our minds and and often
[1:09:03] time we lose the battle because
[1:09:05] confusion comes in and then we don't
[1:09:07] know we forget who we are. We forget
[1:09:10] what we are about and confusion steps in
[1:09:13] and now we find ourselves doing things
[1:09:15] we're not supposed to do. Now the what
[1:09:18] will say that Jesus knew who he was and
[1:09:21] and because he knew who he was, he had
[1:09:25] confidence in what his mission was. And
[1:09:28] and so I want you now to realize that to
[1:09:30] the knowledge of who you are gives the
[1:09:33] confidence on what you're supposed to
[1:09:35] do, how you're supposed to do it, and
[1:09:37] what you what the power that's been
[1:09:39] given to you is. So we want uh uh to
[1:09:43] have confidence and and and and and know
[1:09:46] what the word calls us to be. Obviously
[1:09:49] we don't want it to be by arrogance but
[1:09:51] but it's by humility at the same time.
[1:09:54] God just wants us to be humble people.
[1:09:56] But he doesn't want us to be just a
[1:09:58] pushover one that could be just run over
[1:10:01] everything goes by. God wants us to
[1:10:03] stand on the promises that we know
[1:10:05] belong to us and claim that which belong
[1:10:08] to us. and and so the confidence flows
[1:10:12] from identification and and what you
[1:10:14] notice is when you know your
[1:10:16] identification and your motive and your
[1:10:19] objective that you are doing therefore
[1:10:21] it gives you confidence in order for you
[1:10:23] to do it. So I'll give you an example.
[1:10:25] If at work you don't know what your job
[1:10:27] description is or what you're supposed
[1:10:29] to do, you'll be a very confused person.
[1:10:32] You will come in and you can I do this?
[1:10:34] No. Can I touch this? No. You'll be very
[1:10:37] confused. But once your objective and
[1:10:39] your mission and your position and your
[1:10:41] identity has been confirmed to you, you
[1:10:44] walk in with confidence to do the job
[1:10:46] that you want that you would you were
[1:10:48] you were called to do. God want us to be
[1:10:50] the same way. God has not called us to
[1:10:53] to wonder what we are. He told us what
[1:10:56] we are.
[1:10:59] So the right identity will anchor you
[1:11:02] through your life and through
[1:11:04] difficulties, through trials and
[1:11:06] everything to know who you are. That God
[1:11:09] has not changed his mind about you,
[1:11:11] which is what the devil tells you every
[1:11:13] day. But one says that God has never
[1:11:15] changed his mind about his word. And and
[1:11:18] I just want to say this, you are the
[1:11:20] word of God manifested for the age that
[1:11:22] we are living in.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; We we are not here. The challenge we run
[1:11:27] into most of the time is we look at the
[1:11:30] scripture and and we look at uh low is
[1:11:34] us and and I'm trying to be what the
[1:11:37] word says. No, let me put it in a
[1:11:39] different way. You are what the word
[1:11:41] says.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; You are what the Bible says. you. It's
[1:11:45] not us trying to become something that
[1:11:47] we were never before. No, we are going
[1:11:49] back to what we were originally.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; And that's very important because then
[1:11:55] you realize when I'm reading this
[1:11:57] message, when I'm reading the book, I'm
[1:12:00] not reading about Moses. I'm not reading
[1:12:02] about somebody else. I'm reading about
[1:12:04] myself. The prophet told us this Bible
[1:12:07] is the mirror to the believer. What he
[1:12:10] says you are is what you are. You are
[1:12:12] not wanting to be a Christian. You were
[1:12:14] made to be a Christian in the beginning.
[1:12:16] You were made to serve God in the
[1:12:18] beginning. You were made to be a son and
[1:12:21] the daughter of God. Now, we were born
[1:12:23] in sin. That's because that's the way
[1:12:25] God intended or allowed for us to come.
[1:12:28] Not necessarily intended from the
[1:12:30] beginning, but he allowed that to
[1:12:31] happen. But ne that never changed your
[1:12:34] identity. That kept you for who you
[1:12:36] were. But he knew that through the
[1:12:38] process of time that he will send his
[1:12:40] word and bring you into the knowledge of
[1:12:43] what you were supposed to be and that
[1:12:45] you'll be like that boy that looked at
[1:12:46] the mirror and he began to look and if I
[1:12:49] could just put it in the context of the
[1:12:51] Bible perhaps it looked and it talked
[1:12:54] about a well man. It looked about
[1:12:56] somebody who was well and who lived a
[1:12:58] good life and you looked AT YOURSELF AND
[1:13:00] SAID I want to be good. I want to live a
[1:13:02] good life. And the more he came closer
[1:13:04] to it, the more he realized he was
[1:13:06] actually looking at himself.
[1:13:10] And
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; and that's the revelation of this hour.
[1:13:12] Why am I saying this? Because it's so
[1:13:15] important. The enemy will keep you on a
[1:13:18] goose chase trying to make you something
[1:13:20] that you are not. Let me say this. If
[1:13:23] you were not made to be a believer, if
[1:13:25] you are not a believer to begin with,
[1:13:27] you won't become a believer.
[1:13:30] It's not it's not a cocker bird becoming
[1:13:33] a grain of wheat is that you were a
[1:13:36] wheat to begin with. That's why you can
[1:13:38] receive the word of God.
[1:13:43] So he he would come and and it's to
[1:13:47] mirror and and when when we we told it
[1:13:51] says that we have to have such a
[1:13:53] confidence and again I want to divide
[1:13:56] confidence from arrogance because
[1:13:59] arrogance is when you claim something
[1:14:01] you are not. But we need to have
[1:14:03] confidence because the prophet said that
[1:14:06] if if if the word says that there's one
[1:14:08] going you say that's me.
[1:14:13] This is not a a waving age. Want to be
[1:14:16] careful here. It's not a an age where
[1:14:20] you wondering. No, it's the age of
[1:14:23] holding forth and and standing straight
[1:14:26] and and knowing without a shadow of a
[1:14:29] doubt and with confirmation from God by
[1:14:32] the Holy Spirit. If there's one going,
[1:14:34] IT'S NOT THE PASTOR, IT'S ME.
[1:14:38] If there's one elect, it's not somebody
[1:14:40] else, it's me. You You see what I'M
[1:14:42] SAYING? WHY? BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A
[1:14:44] relationship with them that nothing can
[1:14:47] waver you. GOD GOD DIDN'T he he's not
[1:14:52] coming to set you up and say well before
[1:14:55] he of course he uses the ministry to
[1:14:57] speak to you but God is looking for each
[1:15:00] and everyone to have a direct
[1:15:02] relationship with him so that when the
[1:15:04] ministry is talking you would know that
[1:15:07] this word is for me it's not for
[1:15:09] somebody else so he's wanting us to have
[1:15:12] that kind of closeness so we come to the
[1:15:15] word of God when we read the message of
[1:15:17] the hour we can identify with it and say
[1:15:20] that's what I've always wanted to be.
[1:15:24] Lord.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; So he it would say but what I'm in the
[1:15:28] message identification it will say we
[1:15:31] live in the age of identification and
[1:15:33] and we live in the time where it's it's
[1:15:36] almost impossible it would say to do
[1:15:39] anything without identification and and
[1:15:43] think about and he says identification
[1:15:45] is more important today than it's ever
[1:15:48] been in every other age because because
[1:15:51] we live in such a time where Satan is
[1:15:54] identifying his believer, God is also
[1:15:57] identifying his. And I heard a brother
[1:15:59] made a comment I I don't know who it
[1:16:02] was. He said that we live IN SUCH DARK
[1:16:05] AGE where we can say that hell is on
[1:16:08] earth. We can see it. But brother, DON'T
[1:16:11] FORGET HEAVEN IS ALSO ON EARTH AND we
[1:16:13] can see it.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; IT GOD IS NOT GONNA BE DEFEATED. God is
[1:16:19] not gonna let go. God has an his elect
[1:16:22] and by all means possible God will show
[1:16:26] up for his elect and he's provided a way
[1:16:28] for them to escape what's coming.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; So we we you you can you couldn't drive
[1:16:35] a car without a proper identification.
[1:16:37] You couldn't fly without one. You
[1:16:39] couldn't go to the bank and get funds
[1:16:41] without it. You couldn't communicate
[1:16:43] without one. And and everything we do is
[1:16:46] all about identification. And and when
[1:16:49] you say identification, we have all
[1:16:52] kinds of security protocols that are
[1:16:55] built in order for them to make sure
[1:16:58] that you are who you say you are.
[1:17:02] And and let me say this when you talk
[1:17:04] about identification
[1:17:06] the the concept of identification is
[1:17:10] that before something can be identified
[1:17:13] there has to be prior characteristics by
[1:17:16] which we will know that it is what it
[1:17:19] says it is.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And I'm hope I'm not getting too
[1:17:23] scientific up here. So if if this if if
[1:17:26] we call this a bottle of water, there
[1:17:29] has to be a place where initially this
[1:17:32] was defined to be a bottle and the con
[1:17:35] that whatever is contained in the
[1:17:37] bottle, we said it was going to be
[1:17:38] water. Therefore, every time somebody
[1:17:41] takes it, you open it and you taste it.
[1:17:45] That's water. Why? Because you've tasted
[1:17:47] water before and you know what water
[1:17:49] tastes like. And and so spiritually
[1:17:53] speaking we have we have this
[1:17:55] identification. We live in a time where
[1:17:58] we people will talk and say we live in
[1:18:01] the time where people aspire to be like
[1:18:04] celebrities
[1:18:06] are our young people and and you know I
[1:18:08] was preaching back home and we were
[1:18:10] talking and and and I made a comment to
[1:18:12] to our young people. I say that what
[1:18:14] what everything that you do, the way you
[1:18:17] dress, the way you talk, somebody
[1:18:19] inspired you to be that way. And and and
[1:18:23] and if we're not careful, we forget that
[1:18:26] we have a source of inspiration that we
[1:18:28] draw from the way we we we dress and the
[1:18:31] way we talk and all those things. And
[1:18:33] the they look at the celebrities, they
[1:18:36] look at Hollywood stars and sports and
[1:18:38] influencers and all of those and and the
[1:18:40] rich people and all of that. They look
[1:18:43] at them, the worlds look at them and
[1:18:45] they aspire to be like them. They look
[1:18:48] at them and some they go on the internet
[1:18:51] and they will search for, you know, the
[1:18:53] habits of the prosperous people. What do
[1:18:55] they do and this is what they do in the
[1:18:57] morning and this is what they do midday
[1:18:59] and this is what they do and they copy
[1:19:02] all of those things and they try to live
[1:19:04] by the same principle hoping to be rich
[1:19:07] and hoping to succeed like those people
[1:19:09] are. But let me say this my brother, my
[1:19:11] sister, we are sitting here tonight
[1:19:13] because we have one desire and that is
[1:19:15] to be Christlike.
[1:19:18] Our desire is not to be the richest, to
[1:19:21] be the best in this or the best in that.
[1:19:23] We have one desire and one desire alone
[1:19:26] is that the characteristics of what the
[1:19:29] Bible says for us to be for that to be
[1:19:32] manifested in our being. We don't desire
[1:19:34] more money. We don't desire popularity.
[1:19:37] We desire to be Christlike. We desire
[1:19:40] the nature. We desire the way of
[1:19:42] handling things. We desire his approach.
[1:19:45] We desire his vision. We desire like we
[1:19:48] said yesterday, we desire to have the
[1:19:50] same vision that he had. When
[1:19:52] circumstances look like it's going bad
[1:19:55] and when our our human mind is giving us
[1:19:59] information about the dire situation
[1:20:01] that we are looking at. Oh my brother,
[1:20:03] my sister, AT THAT TIME I DESIRE to have
[1:20:06] another eyesight of what God would want
[1:20:09] me to do, of how God looks AT MY
[1:20:11] SITUATION, HOW THAT God will handle my
[1:20:14] situation.
[1:20:17] So these characteristic but when I will
[1:20:19] talk about in the message identification
[1:20:21] and say don't forget that these
[1:20:24] characteristics or these examples that
[1:20:27] were put in the Bible he says there are
[1:20:30] place in there to represent what the
[1:20:33] believer are supposed to be
[1:20:36] when when we read I made a comment this
[1:20:40] when we read about Moses and we read
[1:20:42] about all of those in the Old Testament
[1:20:45] Remember the prophet said those are just
[1:20:48] shadows and types.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not shocking anybody. They
[1:20:55] are not the real thing. They are just
[1:20:58] shadows and types.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; But he says one place he says you go
[1:21:04] back you will see Jesus Christ in every
[1:21:07] single one of them. But my brother says
[1:21:10] WE LIVE IN THE TIME WHERE Jesus Christ
[1:21:12] is having a flesh. Jesus Christ is
[1:21:15] walking on earth. Oh, let me tell you,
[1:21:17] we live in the time where he promised
[1:21:19] the fullness of what was in Christ will
[1:21:22] be pouring into a people. THE FULLNESS
[1:21:25] OF WHAT CHRIST WAS, HOW HE ACTED, HOW HE
[1:21:28] TALKED AND HOW HE DEALT WITH PEOPLE THAT
[1:21:30] ONCE again the world will see Jesus
[1:21:33] Christ. They won't see him in the body
[1:21:36] that they saw 2,000 years ago. They will
[1:21:38] see him manifested in another. But what
[1:21:41] I'm says in the formation of the bride,
[1:21:44] he will make himself known.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; The same Christ. Let me say this. God
[1:21:49] has never changed. And here's the
[1:21:51] trouble we run into with the people in
[1:21:53] the age that we live in. We we WHEN WE
[1:21:56] TALK ABOUT JESUS CHRIST, EVERYBODY
[1:21:58] understand the fullness of God that
[1:22:00] dwell in him. But Brabanam tells us, he
[1:22:03] says the the ocean, whether you have the
[1:22:06] fullness of the ocean or you have a
[1:22:08] spoon, it has the same effect. It's no
[1:22:12] different. So whether WE HAVE THE FULL
[1:22:14] MEASURE, ANYBODY WHO HAS THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:22:17] has Christ and God himself dwelling in
[1:22:20] them, YOU HAVE THE SAME POWER THAT WAS
[1:22:22] IN JESUS Christ is in you. This tonight
[1:22:25] you whatever he does, you can do. The
[1:22:28] prophet said that she is him.
[1:22:32] She is him. The the the the bridegroom
[1:22:36] cannot be the word and the bride be
[1:22:39] something else.
[1:22:44] So when we look at the characteristics
[1:22:47] of the Bible, we have to come to a place
[1:22:51] and and this is the confidence that I
[1:22:53] want to inspire in us tonight as I'm
[1:22:55] speaking is that when I'm reading the
[1:22:57] Bible, I'm not reading as some stories.
[1:23:00] I'm reading my own story manifested in
[1:23:04] some characters. I'm reading about
[1:23:06] myself manifested in some characters.
[1:23:09] WHY? BECAUSE THOSE CHARACTERS WERE PUT
[1:23:11] in the Bible. So we today we can know
[1:23:15] what is it that we're going to be. Let
[1:23:17] me say this. Our lives today the the we
[1:23:20] live the journey even of the
[1:23:22] selfdiscovery
[1:23:24] of what we are and what the word says
[1:23:26] we're going to be.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; We we and I don't know about you
[1:23:31] sometimes you shock yourself with the
[1:23:34] very reaction of what you do. You come
[1:23:36] into a circumstance. Yeah, we are
[1:23:38] thinking all things is going to fall
[1:23:40] apart and all of the sudden you find
[1:23:42] yourself on the other side. YOU'RE LIKE,
[1:23:44] I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MADE IT. YOU KNOW,
[1:23:45] YOU DON'T KNOW HOW YOU MADE IT, BUT HE
[1:23:47] KNOWS HOW YOU made it. He placed a seat
[1:23:50] in your heart and he knew that what he
[1:23:52] placed in you was good enough to take
[1:23:54] the test that you were going through.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; So that's the confidence he wants us to
[1:24:00] be that we may boldly approach the
[1:24:03] throne with confidence in our heart.
[1:24:06] So the prophet will say spiritually
[1:24:09] speaking
[1:24:11] we are living in a time of
[1:24:12] identification
[1:24:15] and and
[1:24:18] what was in the beginning and and God's
[1:24:21] mind what was in God's mind in the
[1:24:24] beginning is being manifested in the age
[1:24:27] that we are living in.
[1:24:30] Part of the challenge is perhaps in the
[1:24:33] message uh and I'll just say briefly
[1:24:36] don't want to get into any conflict
[1:24:38] whatsoever. We Ram says we are standing
[1:24:43] exactly where Adam and Eve stood. Uh
[1:24:46] this is not necessarily to return us to
[1:24:51] a a Pentecost where we can go back and
[1:24:53] get back the gifts and all of those
[1:24:55] things. But God is actually this is the
[1:24:59] age of restoration because remember THE
[1:25:03] THE FIRST COMING OF CHRIST was for the
[1:25:05] payment of the price. So he cannot pay
[1:25:08] the price SO WE CAN GO BACK TO being
[1:25:10] children again. He paid the price so
[1:25:13] that at the end time when it's coming to
[1:25:16] be manifested, the scripture says it's
[1:25:19] the claiming age. It's the time where
[1:25:21] he's restoring what was right back into
[1:25:24] the beginning. But when I makes a
[1:25:26] statement, it says the harmony that
[1:25:28] existed between Christ and the son and
[1:25:32] his father. In fact, it says the harmony
[1:25:34] that existed in the garden of Eden, God
[1:25:37] is here to restore you TO THAT FIRST
[1:25:40] HARMONY THAT existed before the fall
[1:25:43] even came.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; It It's the WORD THAT RESTORES THE POWER
[1:25:48] AND THE authority to mankind so they
[1:25:52] will know what they are. AND YOU
[1:25:54] COULDN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE unless the
[1:25:56] word was revealed to you. AND WITH THE
[1:25:59] REVEALING OF THE WORD is the empowerment
[1:26:02] for you to know who you are and to act
[1:26:05] according to the word that's been given
[1:26:07] to you.
[1:26:09] He says spirit, the spirit of God, he's
[1:26:12] here to call out the elect out of the
[1:26:15] church. He says uh uh come from amongst
[1:26:18] them. The cry of the hour is to come out
[1:26:21] from amongst them. And God is calling
[1:26:24] out a people for his name's sake. He the
[1:26:27] iniquity of mankind's in this end time.
[1:26:30] He's filling up in Satan by deception.
[1:26:34] He's continually growing and growing and
[1:26:38] calling out his own. And we want uh and
[1:26:41] the message of the hour is here to
[1:26:44] expose the deception by which Satan has
[1:26:47] been calling his people.
[1:26:50] the what the the reason we gather here
[1:26:53] and I want to say this. It's because it
[1:26:55] it's not because we wanted it. I I tell
[1:26:59] you it's amazing how many good people
[1:27:02] you find that don't believe the message.
[1:27:06] A really decent human being that we we
[1:27:11] couldn't even compare to them. I it's
[1:27:15] not for our goodness that we believe
[1:27:17] this message. It's not of anything good
[1:27:20] that we have done. We didn't take one
[1:27:23] step. In fact, we don't even have the
[1:27:25] motivation of some of those people have.
[1:27:28] But yet, God is elected to open your
[1:27:31] eyes. God is elected to call you to the
[1:27:34] knowledge of this message so you can see
[1:27:37] who you really are. And let me say this,
[1:27:39] when because God opened your eyes, it's
[1:27:43] not for you to just say, "My eyes has
[1:27:45] been open." NO, HE OPENED IT SO YOU can
[1:27:47] feed on what is it that he wants you to
[1:27:50] be
[1:27:52] to KNOW THAT GOD SENT A PROPHET. THAT'S
[1:27:54] WONDERFUL. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO get to is
[1:27:57] the LIFE THAT WAS SPOKEN ABOUT, THE
[1:28:00] promises that were GIVEN FOR THAT
[1:28:02] PROMISE TO BECOME A REALITY IN our
[1:28:04] lives.
[1:28:07] He said we we we we we here God is here
[1:28:13] to see and and by the opening of the
[1:28:16] eyes so we can see the darkness that's
[1:28:19] out there and that we know how to
[1:28:21] navigate it that every believer of this
[1:28:23] of the age as always to answer to the
[1:28:28] call of the hour that we that we're
[1:28:30] living in. And this is our calling in
[1:28:33] the end time that we are looking at. But
[1:28:36] whenam says
[1:28:39] the end time message will overcome the
[1:28:42] end time challenges.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; The the and and that's why it's
[1:28:49] important that we that have believed the
[1:28:51] message will say uh this is not the Noah
[1:28:55] message will not work in this time.
[1:28:57] Moses message will not work in this
[1:28:59] time. We have a a a message that is
[1:29:03] called and it's the only provided way
[1:29:06] that God has given us for us to get out
[1:29:09] of the condition that we find ourselves
[1:29:11] in. So we as believers, we have to get
[1:29:14] into what is it that's been given to us
[1:29:17] to overcome the challenge for the hour
[1:29:20] that we are living in. So we can
[1:29:22] overcome
[1:29:25] the scripture will say in Revelation 10
[1:29:27] and 13 it says
[1:29:30] and he said unto me still not
[1:29:35] still not the saying of the prophecy of
[1:29:37] this book. Now I want you to to really
[1:29:41] uh just follow what is it that is saying
[1:29:44] here.
[1:29:45] Seal not the saying of the prophecy of
[1:29:48] this book. For the time is at hand.
[1:29:54] The time for what? The time for the
[1:29:56] revealing of it. He says that he that is
[1:30:00] unjust, let him be unjust still. And he
[1:30:04] that is filthy, let him be filthy still.
[1:30:07] And he that is righteous, let him be
[1:30:10] righteous. Let him be uh he that is
[1:30:13] righteous, let him be righteous still.
[1:30:15] And he that is holy, let him be holy
[1:30:18] still. So and behold, I come quickly,
[1:30:22] and my reward is with me to give to
[1:30:25] every man according uh according to his
[1:30:29] works shall be. I am the alpha and the
[1:30:33] omega, the beginning and the end and the
[1:30:37] la, the first and the last. So when we
[1:30:40] come to the understanding, he's saying
[1:30:43] that that that I come he says say
[1:30:49] thus sayeth the lord uh still not seal
[1:30:52] not the saying of this prophecy he that
[1:30:54] is unjust let him be unjust still. So
[1:30:58] when we really talk about
[1:31:00] identification, it's not the coming into
[1:31:03] something new, but what GOD IS REALLY
[1:31:06] DOING AT THE time that we are living in.
[1:31:09] God is uncovering who is his and who was
[1:31:13] not his.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; I it it's not the COMING INTO SOMETHING
[1:31:19] WELL I I I see the message I never know
[1:31:21] what it was and I come across the
[1:31:23] message. Let me say this. The reason why
[1:31:26] you believe in the in the message you
[1:31:29] believe the message is because there's
[1:31:31] something that was planted in you THAT
[1:31:34] WHEN YOU HEAR IT YOU believe it.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS NOT HERE IN THE BUSINESS OF
[1:31:39] taking Satan's children and making it
[1:31:42] his children and watch Satan do the
[1:31:44] same. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING.
[1:31:46] WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE WORD HAS GONE
[1:31:48] FORTH AND GOD IS CALLING FORTH HIS ELECT
[1:31:51] AND HE KNEW WHO THE ELECT was going to
[1:31:53] be.
[1:31:56] So I IT'S THE TIME WHERE YOU HAVE TO BE
[1:31:59] CAREFUL. Am I getting ready every day?
[1:32:02] Is the word bringing me forth and closer
[1:32:05] and closer to the rapture? Am I being
[1:32:08] changed every day with my life or am I
[1:32:10] getting worse?
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; It's very important. You you can't you
[1:32:16] can't be the same that you were 5 years
[1:32:18] ago. You can't be the same that you were
[1:32:21] two months ago. The word has to
[1:32:23] continually change you every day. There
[1:32:25] has to be an hunger within the hearts of
[1:32:28] the BELIEVER TO SAY, "LORD, I WANT TO BE
[1:32:30] BETTER. I WANT TO BE BETTER. I WANT TO
[1:32:32] BE BETTER." WHY? BECAUSE THE UNJUST IS
[1:32:34] ON GETTING UNJUST. AND THE ONE THAT'S
[1:32:36] HOLY IS GETTING HOLY STILL. It It's the
[1:32:39] dividing line.
[1:32:42] And And let me just read how the prophet
[1:32:44] says it in the message God of this evil
[1:32:46] age. Uh paragraph 56. He says the
[1:32:49] spirit, the two spirits, one of them is
[1:32:52] the Holy Spirit, the other one is the
[1:32:54] devil spirit working in deception. He
[1:32:57] says the people of this earth are now
[1:33:01] making their choices.
[1:33:05] The people of the earth are now making
[1:33:09] the choices. So as we sit here every day
[1:33:14] and and I want to say this because it
[1:33:16] it's very important
[1:33:19] identification you are not what you say
[1:33:22] you are you are what you do
[1:33:28] and I let me just tell on myself and
[1:33:32] one time and and you know I I pull out
[1:33:36] my digital footprint of the things I
[1:33:39] search online and the things I do and
[1:33:41] everything. And I looked at it, I
[1:33:44] couldn't believe.
[1:33:47] I I looked at it and I said, "That's not
[1:33:50] me." I in other words, I I I'M SO ED UP
[1:33:55] IN trying to find out what's going on
[1:33:57] with the news and what's going on with
[1:33:59] this or what's going on with this
[1:34:01] project and what's going on in life and
[1:34:03] what's going on and and you look at I
[1:34:06] look at the amount of time I spend on my
[1:34:08] phone and computers. I couldn't believe
[1:34:10] it.
[1:34:13] So it you can we can lie to oursel and I
[1:34:16] could lie to myself. I'm a Christian.
[1:34:18] Well, I go to church and and everything.
[1:34:20] But you are not what you say you are.
[1:34:24] You are what your works prove to be
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; and and and that's very important
[1:34:30] because THEN IT CAUSES US TO PAY
[1:34:33] attention to what choices we make, the
[1:34:36] decision that we make because we can
[1:34:38] have it up here. I'm a son of God and
[1:34:40] and all of that, BUT YET YOUR WORKS
[1:34:42] PROVE contrary to what you're saying.
[1:34:44] And the prophet will even go say and
[1:34:46] say, that's why it's important you
[1:34:48] realize it's the composition of your
[1:34:51] choices that make who you are. And your
[1:34:53] choices directs in what decision you are
[1:34:56] going, what position or or or what
[1:34:59] direction rather that you are going. LET
[1:35:02] ME SAY THIS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STUMBLE
[1:35:03] IN HEAVEN or in hell.
[1:35:07] But says, in fact, he says that he says
[1:35:10] you have to jump over every barrier and
[1:35:14] everything that God has laid before you
[1:35:16] to stop you before you find yourself in
[1:35:18] hell. You're not just going to stumble
[1:35:20] and SAY, "OH, HOW DID I MAKE IT HERE?"
[1:35:22] NO, you He He gave you grace. You walked
[1:35:25] over it. He gave YOU A WARNING. YOU
[1:35:27] WALKED OUT OF IT. HE GAVE YOU CONSTANTLY
[1:35:29] GAVE YOU YOU WALKED and you walked and
[1:35:31] you walked and that's how YOU'RE GOING
[1:35:32] TO FIND. AND IN HEAVEN, GOD GIVES YOU
[1:35:35] OPPORTUNITY AND you take it. HE GIVES
[1:35:37] YOU OPPORTUNITY and you take it. HE
[1:35:39] GIVES YOU OPPORTUNITY. SO OUR CHOICES
[1:35:42] DETERMINES our direction
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; and and if we are called to be the sons
[1:35:48] of God, it's important that we find out
[1:35:50] that what decision and and what is it
[1:35:53] THAT I'M DOING? WHAT IS my life
[1:35:56] reflecting? IT'S SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE
[1:35:58] THE WORD HAS TO HAVE AN EFFECT on you.
[1:36:03] But when it says one PLACE IT SAYS I
[1:36:05] WONDER if we are sufficiently impressed
[1:36:07] with the word in our midst
[1:36:10] and and impress I'm not talking about
[1:36:12] wow impress is IS THE WORD HAS AN EFFECT
[1:36:16] ON MY LIFE AM I ACTUALLY SEEING THE
[1:36:19] FRUITS I'VE BEEN IN THE MESSAGE 20 YEARS
[1:36:21] 30 YEARS 40 YEARS 50 YEARS ONE YEAR TWO
[1:36:24] YEAR WHAT IS IT THAT THE WORD HAS DONE
[1:36:26] IN my life
[1:36:29] WHAT IS IT BECAUSE GOD IS DOING A WORK.
[1:36:32] GOD IS [screaming] THERE FOR THOSE THAT
[1:36:34] ARE LOOKING FOR HIM. HE'S CONSTANTLY
[1:36:36] THERE TRYING TO MANIFEST HIMSELF EVERY
[1:36:38] DAY IN our lives. And identification
[1:36:43] is wanting us to know that he's provided
[1:36:46] a way for every one of our situation if
[1:36:49] we will only take him by his word.
[1:36:53] The prophet will continue and says, "And
[1:36:55] the Holy Spirit this year calling out a
[1:36:57] bride for Christ. He is doing it.
[1:37:02] Listen to this. He's doing this by
[1:37:06] vindicating his word of promise to her
[1:37:10] for this age. Showing that it's Christ.
[1:37:14] If the finger is supposed to move in
[1:37:16] this age, the finger will move. And if
[1:37:20] the foot is supposed to move in this
[1:37:22] age, the foot will move. And if
[1:37:26] if if
[1:37:28] the eye is supposed to move in this age,
[1:37:30] the eye will move. The spirit of God is
[1:37:33] here as he grows into the fullness of
[1:37:37] God in the age that we are now living.
[1:37:41] The Holy Spirit is here vindicating the
[1:37:45] message of the hour. I love that. I love
[1:37:49] that. And you know who I give it to?
[1:37:52] Anybody? all the unbeliever. Let me say
[1:37:55] this. When you believe the word of God,
[1:37:57] the message of the hour, Brother Ram
[1:37:59] says the Holy Spirit is here to let you
[1:38:03] know that you have believed the truth.
[1:38:06] It's not up TO YOU TO SAY, "OH, I'M
[1:38:08] GOING TO PROVE THE MESSAGE TO BE TRUE."
[1:38:10] NO. WHEN YOU BELIEVE the word, GOD
[1:38:12] HIMSELF BY THE HOLY Spirit is here to
[1:38:16] show you that what you have believed is
[1:38:18] the truth. He's here to vindicate the
[1:38:21] message of the hour. And let me say
[1:38:23] this, if he vindicated a prophet, if he
[1:38:26] vindicated his message, he's going to
[1:38:28] vindicate you, too. It's the same God.
[1:38:31] IT'S THE SAME WORD. THE SAME GOD IN THE
[1:38:33] PROPHET. THE SAME GOD IN THE WORD. THE
[1:38:36] SAME GOD in the bride.
[1:38:41] And the Holy Spirit is here. Listen to
[1:38:44] this. The Holy Spirit is doing it so
[1:38:47] that the people that believe God will be
[1:38:51] called out of this chaos.
[1:38:54] Oh my. How many want to be called out of
[1:38:57] this chaos? I Let me say this. I don't
[1:38:59] want part of this. These I don't want
[1:39:02] nothing to do with it. I don't want OF
[1:39:04] ITS FRUIT. I DON'T WANT OF ANYTHING THAT
[1:39:07] to do with it. IT IT'S ONLY DRAGGING YOU
[1:39:09] DOWN. IT DOES. IT PRODUCES nothing
[1:39:12] that's going to bring YOU UP. ALL IT
[1:39:14] DOES IS CALLING YOU INTO WORLDLINESS.
[1:39:16] But my brother and my sister, we have
[1:39:18] BEEN PROVIDED A WORD THAT WILL LIFT US
[1:39:21] UP OF THIS WORLD. This message will put
[1:39:23] you in the rapture.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; The devil and Holy Spirit is here
[1:39:32] calling out his church by error
[1:39:37] as usual by perversion of the word of
[1:39:41] God like he did in the beginning. See,
[1:39:45] it's coming right back to the sea time
[1:39:47] again from Eden. And here it is again.
[1:39:52] We are only here going here. We are only
[1:39:55] going to reflect
[1:39:58] whatever we identify with. Let me say
[1:40:01] this th this is very important
[1:40:07] to myself.
[1:40:10] What I have realized within my own life
[1:40:12] is every time I identified with my
[1:40:17] flesh, my place of birth, what I was
[1:40:20] called to be in the flesh and
[1:40:22] everything, I produce flesh.
[1:40:26] And every time I identify with the
[1:40:28] spiritual me and what I was called to be
[1:40:31] and what God wants me to be, I identify
[1:40:34] the spiritual part. It's a very key. You
[1:40:38] won't overcome if you keep looking at
[1:40:41] your flesh.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; You will not overcome if you keep
[1:40:46] looking at your flesh. God don't want
[1:40:49] anything to do with your flesh. Your
[1:40:52] flesh will not inherit the kingdom of
[1:40:54] God.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for my heart because
[1:41:00] we we like I said, we we have to come to
[1:41:04] a place where we are settled. We have to
[1:41:06] come to a place where the anchor is
[1:41:08] holding. We have to come to a place
[1:41:11] where there come winds or wave there's
[1:41:13] no place we are moving. WE HAVE TO COME
[1:41:16] to a place where you know I'm a believer
[1:41:18] no matter what. We have to come TO A
[1:41:20] PLACE WE ARE NOT MOVED BY EVERY WIND OF
[1:41:23] DOCTRINE OR BY EVERY SITUATION.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; And the only way you WILL KNOW IS TO
[1:41:28] KNOW WHO THE REAL you is. I was telling
[1:41:31] brother Jonathan I said the flesh butam
[1:41:33] SAYS ONE PLACE HE SAYS WE ACTUALLY HAVE
[1:41:36] NEVER MET.
[1:41:38] How many have read that WE YOU YOU ARE
[1:41:40] NOT THE FLESH. THIS THIS here was given
[1:41:44] for you for you to just express
[1:41:46] yourself.
[1:41:48] AND I FIND IT SO HARD EVEN WHEN I TRY TO
[1:41:52] DO GOOD EVIL IS present with me.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; I do GOOD EVIL THOUGHTS COMES IN. this
[1:42:00] comes in. WHY? SATAN HAS ACCESS TO THIS.
[1:42:03] HE'S BEEN WORKING FOR 6,000 YEARS
[1:42:06] PERFECTING the craft of what it is to be
[1:42:08] A MAN. BUT THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T OVERCOME
[1:42:12] THE END TIME IDENTIFICATION WHEN COMES
[1:42:15] NOW. REMEMBER, OH, I'm just jumping
[1:42:17] towards the end now. If you'll forgive
[1:42:19] me, I'm getting excited. SO, HERE IT IS.
[1:42:22] YOU YOU YOU looking at you. WE CAN LOOK
[1:42:25] OUT THROUGH THE SEVEN uh the church
[1:42:27] ages. They will come at you and say,
[1:42:29] "Well, you are born a sinner and you
[1:42:31] have to give your life to God and this
[1:42:32] is what you have to do." You do it and
[1:42:35] you do it and you come, "Well, you got
[1:42:37] to be sanctified and you got to be
[1:42:39] justified and sanctified and you got to
[1:42:41] receive the new birth and everything."
[1:42:43] AND DENOMINATION STOP RIGHT THERE. AND
[1:42:46] EVERY TIME THEY TALK AFTER THEY COME TO
[1:42:48] the new birth, THEY HAVE TO GO RIGHT
[1:42:50] BACK AGAIN. REPENTANCE, new birth,
[1:42:54] repentance, NEW IT NEVER TOOK THEM
[1:42:56] ANYWHERE. BUT THE PROPHET COMES IN THIS
[1:42:58] END TIME WHEN HE'S TALKING TO YOU. HE
[1:43:01] DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU CAME FROM YOUR
[1:43:03] PARENTS. HE TOOK YOUR IDENTIFICATION AND
[1:43:05] BROUGHT IT RIGHT BACK INTO THE BEGINNING
[1:43:08] TO WHAT YOU WERE BEFORE THERE WAS A
[1:43:09] STAR, BEFORE THERE WAS A MOON, BEFORE
[1:43:12] THERE WAS ANYTHING. HE SAID YOU WERE
[1:43:14] THERE. AND IF YOU WERE NOT THERE,
[1:43:16] THERE'S NO WAY YOU COULD GET THERE.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; SO EVERY TIME YOU MAKE YOUR
[1:43:22] IDENTIFICATION ATTACHED TO YOUR FLESH,
[1:43:24] IT WILL BRING YOU DOWN.
[1:43:27] TIE YOUR IDENTIFICATION TO WHAT HE said
[1:43:30] in the word, to what he called YOU TO
[1:43:32] BE. THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO OVERCOME.
[1:43:34] WHY? BECAUSE WITHIN THAT IDENTIFICATION,
[1:43:37] HE'S GIVING YOU A PART OF HIMSELF.
[1:43:40] REMEMBER WE SAID, WHAT IS THE WORD OF
[1:43:41] GOD? THE WORD OF GOD IS PART OF HIMSELF
[1:43:44] THAT HE gives to the believer. BUT THE
[1:43:47] PROPHET SAY JESUS OVERCAME BY THE WORD
[1:43:50] OF GOD. YET HE WAS THE MOST GIFTED MAN
[1:43:53] THAT THERE WAS on the face of the earth.
[1:43:56] He could have looked at the devil and
[1:43:58] kick him out by one finger. But the
[1:44:01] prophet will say he knew that you would
[1:44:04] come.
[1:44:07] He knew that one day you would come and
[1:44:11] he knew that you would not be gifted as
[1:44:13] he was. So he used a weapon that he knew
[1:44:18] that when you get the same weapon, you
[1:44:20] will produce the word of the same
[1:44:22] result. Butam says, "The word of God
[1:44:25] will defeat the devil any place, any
[1:44:27] time, under any circumstance."
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; So what I want you to do tonight, take
[1:44:34] your circumstance and lay it there and
[1:44:37] chop it with the word of God.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; TAKE WHATEVER YOUR FLESH HAS TOLD YOU,
[1:44:44] TAKE WHATEVER COMPLEXES YOU HAVE, lay it
[1:44:48] down there, take the word of God, and
[1:44:50] chop every bit of it. Why? because he's
[1:44:53] giving you the weapon by which you're
[1:44:56] going to overcome.
[1:45:01] I'm no good and I can't talk right and I
[1:45:05] can't do this right and
[1:45:08] you think God didn't know
[1:45:12] is that another Moses
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; a brother you know was preaching and he
[1:45:20] made the statement I actually I loved it
[1:45:22] he said
[1:45:24] God took Moses
[1:45:26] who was such an eloquent speaker
[1:45:30] and over the army
[1:45:32] He brings in in the wilderness a man
[1:45:34] until a man forgets even how to talk.
[1:45:39] And when he forgets how to talk, that's
[1:45:43] when God shows up.
[1:45:45] It says, "Moses,
[1:45:48] now you're ready."
[1:45:51] Think about it.
[1:45:53] We want to work into our weaknesses and
[1:45:58] our strength. We want to be at our best
[1:46:01] in everything. We want God don't desire
[1:46:04] that. God wants you to just stand there.
[1:46:06] But when I'm says God is just looking
[1:46:08] FOR ONE MAN, ONE MAN. ONE PERSON
[1:46:11] TONIGHT. NOT THE WHOLE CONGREGATION.
[1:46:14] JUST ONE PERSON TO TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD.
[1:46:17] THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH.
[1:46:21] Now tell me what strength David had.
[1:46:25] Yeah. There is. And the whole army of
[1:46:27] Israel and the scripture says that Saul
[1:46:31] who was head and shoulder above all
[1:46:33] Israel was afraid
[1:46:36] and David comes and you know they send
[1:46:40] him to bring food and little David and
[1:46:41] he turns and says oh there's food and he
[1:46:44] says and then there's commotion and
[1:46:46] everybody's panicking what's going on he
[1:46:49] says well don't you see what we have
[1:46:51] coming over there it's like what's that
[1:46:52] he said oh it's a Philistine it's
[1:46:54] Goliath and he's going to fight against
[1:46:55] us And he looks and he says, "So who's
[1:46:58] going?" He says, "What do you mean who's
[1:47:00] going? Don't you see the circumstance
[1:47:02] that we are changing that that we are
[1:47:04] facing here?"
[1:47:07] He's looking at them. Now you tell me.
[1:47:10] But what eyes, but what camera was David
[1:47:15] looking at the circumstances?
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; So everybody kept looking at the reality
[1:47:20] of what was presented by the devil. the
[1:47:23] reality. You know, Satan knows how to
[1:47:25] frame our minds and our thinking. Look
[1:47:28] at you. You couldn't do this. The doctor
[1:47:31] ALREADY SAID YOU ARE DONE. You know,
[1:47:33] it's it's funny how you feeling very
[1:47:35] well and you go to the doctor and the
[1:47:38] moment they told you, oh, you have
[1:47:40] something over here, pain starts right
[1:47:43] away.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; Like, I came in here walking fine and
[1:47:47] now I got to I'm limping ALL THE WAY OUT
[1:47:50] JUST BY the news.
[1:47:54] It's amazing the psychology of men.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; Why? BECAUSE WE ARE WIRED THAT WAY. AND
[1:48:01] GOD DON'T WANT TO USE THAT. GOD WANTS
[1:48:03] YOU TO INSPIRE TO BE INSPIRED BY HIS
[1:48:06] WORD, TO BELIEVE HIS WORD. And David
[1:48:08] came AND HE SAYS, "I COME HERE." HE
[1:48:11] DIDN'T SAY, "I COME HERE BY MY
[1:48:12] STRENGTH." HE SAID, "YOU HAVE DEFIED THE
[1:48:15] LORD GOD OF ISRAEL, AND I'M COME HERE,
[1:48:18] I'M GOING TO CUT YOUR HEAD OFF." LET me
[1:48:20] ask you, DAVID SHOWED UP WITH THE
[1:48:22] SLINGSHOT. IT WAS ACTUALLY GOLIATH THAT
[1:48:25] HAD THE SWORD who was talking crazy.
[1:48:30] You see, and Goliath is looking at his
[1:48:33] says perhaps he turned around and says,
[1:48:36] "Look at this guy. I mean, they went and
[1:48:38] give me are you mocking me? This is what
[1:48:41] you're going to give me AGAINST MY
[1:48:43] BATTLE." HE SAID, "I'LL PICK YOU UP AND
[1:48:44] I'LL FEED YOU TO THE BIRD." HE SAID,
[1:48:46] "I'LL CHOP YOUR HEAD OFF.
[1:48:49] Whose word whose word came to pass?
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Was it by David's strength?
[1:48:57] You know, I grew up in the in in the the
[1:49:00] uh uh uh Bible in the the the book of we
[1:49:02] used to get the the Jehovah Witness uh
[1:49:05] uh uh literatures and everything and
[1:49:08] they will draw uh uh uh David just this
[1:49:11] big man and everything. But one of them
[1:49:13] came and says he was a CC man. CC boy.
[1:49:17] He wasn't what he looked like. He was a
[1:49:19] just A SMALL PERSON. HE SAYS IT'S not
[1:49:22] the man, BUT IT WAS THE GOD BEHIND THE
[1:49:25] WORD THAT he was standing on. SO YOUR
[1:49:27] STRENGTH DOESN'T COME BY YOURSELF. IT
[1:49:29] COMES BEHIND THE WORD AND THE GOD THAT
[1:49:31] WAS SENDING YOU. SO THE SAME GOD WHO
[1:49:34] WENT WITH JACOB AND THE SAME GOD WHO
[1:49:36] WENT WITH ISRAEL, THE SAME GOD WHO WENT
[1:49:38] WITH DAVID, THE SAME GOD IS HERE TO walk
[1:49:41] with you this evening.
[1:49:49] I want to say this.
[1:49:52] It's the word of God.
[1:49:58] If I if if it's the word of God
[1:50:05] that brings us to our real
[1:50:08] identification
[1:50:13] because
[1:50:15] and every believer, every true believer
[1:50:19] that's ever received the word of Godam
[1:50:23] says the word
[1:50:25] calls for total separation from
[1:50:27] unbelief. believe and and and I want to
[1:50:30] say this. It it's not that
[1:50:34] you read the scripture says, "Oh, don't
[1:50:36] drink." And you say, "Oh, I'm going to
[1:50:38] go try to stop drinking." No. The moment
[1:50:40] you receive the word of God, it creates
[1:50:44] a conflict in your heart.
[1:50:47] The true revelation in the believer
[1:50:49] creates a conflict.
[1:50:53] And and the true believer conversion is
[1:50:56] when the things that you enjoy to do
[1:50:59] once you receive the word of God, you
[1:51:02] don't enjoy them no more.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; All of the sudden the war starts within
[1:51:07] your own heart. All of the sudden the
[1:51:10] things that you used to partake in, they
[1:51:12] don't mean anything to you anymore. This
[1:51:15] is not a conformity message where we
[1:51:17] come and say you got to do this, you got
[1:51:19] to do this. Let me say this. YOU CAN
[1:51:21] WEAR A SKIRT AS LONG AS YOU WANT. THAT
[1:51:23] DOESN'T MAKE YOU A MESSAGE BELIEVER.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; It makes you a church member. Oh yeah.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; But that's not what we are looking for.
[1:51:32] You can come and as a brother and and
[1:51:34] clean your mouth and speak right and and
[1:51:36] dress right AND LOOK RIGHT. THAT DOESN'T
[1:51:38] MAKE YOU A BELIEVER. WHAT MAKES YOU A
[1:51:40] BELIEVER IS BY THE NEW BIRTH. YOU HAVE
[1:51:43] TO BE BORN AGAIN BY THE word of God. BY
[1:51:47] THE SPIRIT OF GOD ABIDING IN YOU AND
[1:51:49] leading you.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; It's the new birth that changes. It's
[1:51:55] like the EAGLE STORY. YOU IT SAYS THAT
[1:51:58] HE HE WHEN HE WAS NOT in the chicken
[1:52:02] coupe what it's supposed to do, but says
[1:52:06] one place. He says it was the strangest
[1:52:08] looking chicken that you've ever seen.
[1:52:12] Like you know you know why are you
[1:52:14] growing so tall? What's wrong with you?
[1:52:16] And he will just be there and you know
[1:52:18] and he will go and says listen and the
[1:52:21] mother chicken says this is how you
[1:52:23] follow the instruction this is how we do
[1:52:25] and he says you pick on the ground and
[1:52:27] we eat worms and we eat this and
[1:52:29] everything and HE ATE ALL THE WORMS THAT
[1:52:32] THERE WAS STILL WAS NOT full
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; what's wrong with you we we eat this and
[1:52:38] we are full but some for some reason I'm
[1:52:41] not full and they will come and they
[1:52:43] will be made fun of and IT TRIED AND
[1:52:45] THEY TRIED and he just wouldn't fit. Let
[1:52:48] me say this. You did the same thing. You
[1:52:50] couldn't fit in the world. And says
[1:52:53] instead, now it was told that in a
[1:52:57] certain season, there's a bird that
[1:52:59] comes up in the sky. And it says when
[1:53:02] you hear THE SCREAM OF THAT BIRD, RUN.
[1:53:05] IT SAYS, WHY? HE SAYS, WELL, IF YOU
[1:53:07] DON'T RUN, IT'S GOING TO PICK YOU UP AND
[1:53:08] IT'S GOING TO GO AND eat you. AND IT WAS
[1:53:10] SCARED. AND EVERYBODY TOLD THE STORY AND
[1:53:13] EVERYTHING. And they went and one day
[1:53:15] they were in the field and SCRATCHING
[1:53:16] AND SCRATCHING AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE
[1:53:19] SCREAM COME. THE SCREAM COME AND INSTEAD
[1:53:22] of running he hears the scream and the
[1:53:25] scream means something to him.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; He was told when you HEAR THE SCREAM RUN
[1:53:33] BUT ALL OF THE SUDDEN HE WAS ATTRACTED
[1:53:35] TO THE SCREAM.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; My brother, MY SISTER, LET LET ME SAY
[1:53:39] THIS. GOD KNOWS HIS ELECT AND HE KNOWS
[1:53:42] HOW TO CALL THEM. HE KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK
[1:53:44] TO YOUR HEART. THIS MESSAGE WHEN PEOPLE
[1:53:46] ARE RUNNING AWAY, THERE'S A PEOPLE THAT
[1:53:48] GOD [screaming] HAS PLACED SOMETHING
[1:53:50] WITHIN THEIR HEARTS. WHEN THEY HEAR IT,
[1:53:52] IT'S sweet music to their ears. It's a
[1:53:55] calling forth.
[1:53:58] And I thought, the only reason why this
[1:54:01] chicken kept telling this eagle that
[1:54:04] they eat worms because he was afraid one
[1:54:06] day he's going to turn around and eat
[1:54:07] them all because they were food to him.
[1:54:11] That's what denomination is afraid of.
[1:54:13] That's why people they they keep people
[1:54:15] under you know oh you got to do this and
[1:54:18] there's five step to this and there's 10
[1:54:20] step to this. What is it is a man'smade
[1:54:23] religion that never produce anything.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; YOU TRY FIVE STEP THEY ADD 10 steps to
[1:54:29] it. IN OTHER WORD YOUR CONVERSION AND
[1:54:32] YOU becoming a Christian is always one
[1:54:35] step beyond where you are. Oh, if you
[1:54:38] can only do this, you will become like
[1:54:40] him. Oh, if you know who else HAD THAT
[1:54:42] MESSAGE THAT WAS THE SERPENT'S MESSAGE
[1:54:44] IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. OH, if you do
[1:54:47] this, YOU SHALL BECOME GOD. THEY WERE
[1:54:48] ALREADY GODS.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; They didn't NEED TO BECOME GOD. THEY
[1:54:53] WERE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. THEY WERE
[1:54:56] MADE TO BE GOD. THEY WERE THEY THEY WERE
[1:54:58] ALREADY THERE ANCHORING AND WALKING LIKE
[1:55:01] GODS. BUT YET the deceiver come. AND
[1:55:03] THAT'S WHAT THIS MESSAGE HAS COME TO DO.
[1:55:05] LET ME SAY THIS. YOU WILL NOT BE
[1:55:07] SOMETHING THAT YOU NEVER BEEN. The
[1:55:09] reason why you BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD
[1:55:10] IS BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY A CHRISTIAN.
[1:55:13] YOU ALREADY MADE. YOU'RE ALREADY THERE.
[1:55:15] YOU ALREADY IN HEAVENLY PLACES. THE
[1:55:17] prophet said
[1:55:23] identification.
[1:55:25] There has to be something that existed
[1:55:28] before that you going to match against.
[1:55:32] It's not something new, but it's already
[1:55:35] something that existed in the mind of
[1:55:37] God that God is calling you to. God
[1:55:42] wants you to identify with who he made
[1:55:45] you to be.
[1:55:48] Not what your mama tells you, not what
[1:55:50] your daddy tells you, not what the world
[1:55:53] tells you, not what the teacher tells
[1:55:55] you, but what he tells you in his own
[1:55:58] word that you can identify with that.
[1:56:03] It says, "Now listen to this.
[1:56:07] I I was uh I believe it was Sunday two
[1:56:10] Sunday or two ago.
[1:56:15] A pastor brought this up and he read
[1:56:17] this quote and it just touched my heart
[1:56:19] and I want to share it with you. This is
[1:56:21] in the greatest battle ever fought." He
[1:56:23] says,
[1:56:25] and he's speaking about the word of God.
[1:56:27] says it must be accepted in the mind.
[1:56:33] Then it's believed in the heart.
[1:56:36] Then the word of God becomes a reality.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; I want you to anchor into that.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Don't fight it.
[1:56:49] Don't reason it. Take it as the prophet
[1:56:53] said it.
[1:56:56] It must be accepted in the mind. Then
[1:57:01] it's believed in the heart. Then the
[1:57:04] word of God becomes a reality. Listen to
[1:57:08] this. Then every senses of your soul and
[1:57:12] body is crowded out with the Holy
[1:57:16] Spirit. Then your senses of God, your
[1:57:19] consciousness of God, everything that's
[1:57:22] godly flows through you.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; Oh my,
[1:57:30] there's no more doubt anywhere. There's
[1:57:33] nothing can rise up.
[1:57:38] That's this is this is our life in a
[1:57:40] nutshell. We believe the word of God.
[1:57:44] something within our hearts. It we heard
[1:57:46] it in our minds and we let it drop into
[1:57:49] our hearts responded to it and then what
[1:57:51] we need to let is every senses of our
[1:57:54] body to be energized by it. And then you
[1:57:58] you carry that it will become the
[1:58:00] consciousness of God living through you.
[1:58:03] That alone will bring the reality of who
[1:58:06] God is in your life.
[1:58:09] You you ask those that are born again
[1:58:11] and that's been in the word for a while.
[1:58:14] You don't wake up and wonder, "Am I a
[1:58:16] Christian today or am I not?"
[1:58:21] I I I mean, what in the world would that
[1:58:24] be? Imagine if you were a Christian
[1:58:27] based on your feelings for that day.
[1:58:32] Think about it. It would be a complete
[1:58:35] mess.
[1:58:37] I mean, imagine waking up and all of the
[1:58:40] sudden you you go and you say, "Oh, I
[1:58:42] don't feel like a Christian today." See
[1:58:44] how your life how your day will be
[1:58:46] messed up that day.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; It don't the the highs don't make you a
[1:58:52] Christian. The lows don't make you you
[1:58:54] are a Christian because he said you will
[1:58:56] be a Christian because he made you to be
[1:58:59] one. So he speaks and then he says the
[1:59:02] the then that's the only thing that can
[1:59:04] rise. So it and and it's important that
[1:59:08] identification as I said it it it has to
[1:59:12] be a revelation to the believer
[1:59:16] and and I want to say this but says what
[1:59:19] we need more than anything is spiritual
[1:59:22] revelation.
[1:59:23] We need with that revelation can never
[1:59:26] be overemphasized. Let me say this
[1:59:29] revelation will humble you. Revelation
[1:59:32] will give you meekness. THE REVELATION
[1:59:35] WILL HELP YOU NAVIGATE your life.
[1:59:37] REVELATION WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
[1:59:40] GOD IS TRYING TO DO with your life.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; THE THE THE CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO IS WE
[1:59:45] HAVE SO MUCH INTELLECT BUT VERY little
[1:59:48] revelation. People have we have received
[1:59:50] the message BUT LEFT THE SPIRIT OUT OF
[1:59:52] IT. BUT THE SPIRIT IS THERE TO GUIDE YOU
[1:59:55] IN WHAT HE SAID.
[1:59:59] The the the the Bible says WHEN JESUS
[2:00:02] PROMISED THE HOLY SPIRIT, it says WHEN
[2:00:04] THE SPIRIT COMES, HE SAYS IT WILL BRING
[2:00:07] YOU INTO THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT I ALREADY
[2:00:09] TOLD YOU.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE SPIRIT COMES UPON YOU, IT'S
[2:00:14] NOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
[2:00:16] IT'S TO EMPHASIZE UPON WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
[2:00:19] TOLD AND TO GIVE YOU THE COURAGE TO KNOW
[2:00:21] THAT YOU ARE WHAT HE SAID YOU ARE.
[2:00:27] I think about Gideon
[2:00:32] completely forgot who he was.
[2:00:36] He comes and
[2:00:38] every time the crops will come and the
[2:00:40] Medidionites will come and then just
[2:00:43] take it all.
[2:00:46] And here he is sitting under the tree.
[2:00:49] And the angel comes and he said, "Oh,
[2:00:52] Gideon,
[2:00:53] mighty man of valor."
[2:00:57] I'm pretty sure Gideon did it 360 and
[2:01:01] wonder,
[2:01:03] is this someone around me or you talking
[2:01:05] to me?
[2:01:09] Think about it. And that's exactly what
[2:01:11] we go. So when what says when you hear
[2:01:14] this message, you have heard from your
[2:01:17] theophony.
[2:01:18] So there is actually a real you that's
[2:01:21] already out there. It's just there to
[2:01:24] emphasize and to bring every time you
[2:01:26] seem to take go out of step. Every time
[2:01:28] you seem to fail, every time the word is
[2:01:30] preached, you're not hearing from me.
[2:01:33] You're hearing from your own theophony
[2:01:35] STRENGTHENING YOU, CHARGING YOU TO KNOW
[2:01:38] YOU ALREADY MADE IT. I'M ON THE OTHER
[2:01:40] SIDE WAITING FOR YOU. CONTINUE ON. GO
[2:01:43] ON. YOU ARE THE MIGHTY MEN OF VALOR.
[2:01:51] OTHERWISE,
[2:01:53] it would be giving us a sense of false
[2:01:56] security of something that we never been
[2:01:58] to begin with.
[2:02:00] But this word and the message of the
[2:02:02] Yahweh, the prophet said, it's the word
[2:02:05] of God that's come for your
[2:02:07] identification of who you actually
[2:02:09] supposed to be.
[2:02:14] And I thought we can come in and in the
[2:02:18] natural, you know, we we go to church
[2:02:20] every day and if you're not careful, it
[2:02:22] becomes a habit, right? It's it's
[2:02:25] Wednesday, it's Sunday morning, it's
[2:02:27] Sunday night. Let's go to church and
[2:02:28] everything. But but don't be caught up
[2:02:31] with just the natural.
[2:02:35] Hear me out. Don't don't get caught up
[2:02:37] in the it's a really good habit. The
[2:02:40] scripture says Jesus went to church
[2:02:42] every day. Amen. Every time the doors
[2:02:45] open, he went to church. But don't get
[2:02:47] caught up with just the practice of
[2:02:48] coming to church. It's really good. And
[2:02:51] don't get accustomed to, oh, this is
[2:02:53] brother so and so leading songs and this
[2:02:55] is brother so and so preaching and this
[2:02:57] is a because behind all of that, God is
[2:03:00] actually working a supernatural.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; You you the younger ones can say, "Well,
[2:03:07] I'm here because I have no choice. my
[2:03:09] parents brought me here,
[2:03:11] right? They can actually say that. But
[2:03:14] it's not just that your parents brought
[2:03:16] you here, but it's God that ordained and
[2:03:20] gave you this parent so you can be here
[2:03:22] tonight and be this. Didn't the prophet
[2:03:25] say that your birth was pre-planned. He
[2:03:28] kept this one and that one. He mixed
[2:03:29] this one with that one and that one
[2:03:31] until he came to you. He says he was
[2:03:33] looking for a certain thing so he can
[2:03:36] get you exactly where he wants you to
[2:03:37] be. And but what we need above the
[2:03:40] natural is to catch the supernatural
[2:03:43] that's happening.
[2:03:45] It's very important that we catch the
[2:03:47] supernatural that's happening because
[2:03:50] God will use the natural to gather us
[2:03:52] here, but yet he will speak a spiritual
[2:03:55] word that will come and give us the
[2:03:57] victory for the hour that we need it. It
[2:04:00] will come and speak something that will
[2:04:02] actually cause and touch somebody's
[2:04:04] heart and they will be changed. SO DON'T
[2:04:06] BE JUST THERE WERE THOSE THAT JUST
[2:04:08] LOOKED AT JESUS.
[2:04:10] It says he he went there and he said,
[2:04:13] "Oh, this isn't this HE SAYS THE SPIRIT
[2:04:15] OF THE LORD IS UPON ME TO SPEAK GOOD
[2:04:18] TIDING AND TO DO THIS." And he said, but
[2:04:20] one of them says when he closed the
[2:04:22] scroll and he put it down, there were
[2:04:24] those in the crowd that said, "Oh, isn't
[2:04:27] that nice? the son of Joseph and Mary,
[2:04:32] they forgot to see that there was the
[2:04:35] fulfillment of prophecy that just took
[2:04:37] place right in front of their eyes.
[2:04:44] Think about it. Every time we come to
[2:04:48] church is the fulfillment of the
[2:04:50] prophecy that's happening. It's God
[2:04:53] giving you the word to overcome. It's
[2:04:55] God energizing you to overcome. Uh let
[2:04:58] me just tell a little bit about myself.
[2:05:00] I I I was never a friend of preachers
[2:05:04] and you know I I use the word not in the
[2:05:06] bed. I hated preachers.
[2:05:10] I went to church. Why not? you know, and
[2:05:13] and I remember one time and there was uh
[2:05:16] we had a neighbor who was uh who had a
[2:05:19] church in his house and and so every
[2:05:22] morning he will sneak in and and then
[2:05:25] come catch us kids and and take us to
[2:05:27] church because I mean there's no way we
[2:05:30] would have went by ourselves.
[2:05:32] And so we we kind of knew what time he
[2:05:35] would come in and and and and if we just
[2:05:37] hear him come by the front door, we
[2:05:40] disappear.
[2:05:42] and and and so because he knew that so
[2:05:45] he would come in and and sneak in and
[2:05:48] catch us and and one day, you know, we
[2:05:50] got caught then. So, you know, we got to
[2:05:52] go and so we going to church with our
[2:05:54] heads down and and everything and and he
[2:05:56] goes up and he preaches. This is not a
[2:05:58] message church. And and he preaches and
[2:06:01] everything and and when he's done
[2:06:04] preaching, he calls me up and said, "I
[2:06:06] want you to close prayer." And I'm
[2:06:07] looking I'm like
[2:06:11] does he know what it's doing? And and I
[2:06:14] go up there and I pray and everything
[2:06:16] and and what did I pray? I have no idea.
[2:06:18] I mean I was my my mind was out of that
[2:06:22] place even my body was there but my mind
[2:06:24] was not there. And and so after service
[2:06:28] I I'm I'm walking out. He said, "Oh, can
[2:06:30] I talk to you for a second?" I said,
[2:06:32] "Okay, here he is and trying to get me
[2:06:34] to stay in the stress, you know." And so
[2:06:36] he looks at me, he says, "There's
[2:06:39] something different about you."
[2:06:41] I look at him, I said, "He's trying.
[2:06:44] He's really trying to get me to come to
[2:06:46] this church." I just said, "Okay, thank
[2:06:48] you." I walk out and I ran away.
[2:06:52] Brother, there's something different
[2:06:55] about you that's sitting here even while
[2:06:58] you were in the world.
[2:07:02] I I was at work one time not and minding
[2:07:05] my own business and doing and a guy just
[2:07:08] walked by me and looked at me and says,
[2:07:09] "Are you a preacher?" I said, "No."
[2:07:14] Have you ever wanted a preacher? I said,
[2:07:16] "No, I hate preachers."
[2:07:21] And I thought, "God has such a sense of
[2:07:24] humor.
[2:07:25] He takes you and he makes you exactly
[2:07:27] what you hated.
[2:07:31] And I want to say it's the same for all
[2:07:32] of us. If you really look, it wasn't
[2:07:35] what you were running to. But yet God
[2:07:37] knew the moment and the time and the
[2:07:40] season by which he he says in one place
[2:07:43] if I could just read for the sake of
[2:07:45] time. He says
[2:07:47] and and he he says
[2:07:58] he says
[2:08:00] in the message
[2:08:04] to uh uh uh he says to whom would we go?
[2:08:09] He says something knocked at your door.
[2:08:13] You rose up and you stood up on your
[2:08:15] feet and walked down here in the aisle
[2:08:18] and something draw you. It says, "Now
[2:08:22] let me give you what the scripture says
[2:08:25] that all that he forneew them he also
[2:08:28] called. Them that was he called you,
[2:08:30] those he also uh uh them that those that
[2:08:33] he called them he also justify and them
[2:08:36] that he justify them he also glorify."
[2:08:39] Who was DOING THE DRAWING? GOD WAS DOING
[2:08:41] THE DRAWING.
[2:08:43] SO IDENTIFICATION IS NOT US TO SIT here
[2:08:46] and proclaim something that we are not
[2:08:49] but is coming into the understanding
[2:08:51] that it was God working on both ends and
[2:08:55] making a way for you to come into the
[2:08:58] knowledge of this message. But but I'm
[2:09:00] going to say this if I could just read
[2:09:02] this quickly.
[2:09:13] He says
[2:09:15] in the message Jehovah Gara he says
[2:09:20] no man come to me except the father
[2:09:23] draws him.
[2:09:26] All that the father has given me will
[2:09:28] come.
[2:09:31] He asked the question, what are you
[2:09:33] scared of? What are you scared about?
[2:09:36] What are you afraid of?
[2:09:39] He says, well,
[2:09:41] maybe I'm just not the right kind of
[2:09:46] Christian.
[2:09:48] Oh my. Isn't that our favorite word?
[2:09:51] Maybe I'm just not the kind of person
[2:09:57] who decides
[2:09:59] is it you or him.
[2:10:04] Don't speak the Satan's Satan's
[2:10:06] language. You know what calls it Satan's
[2:10:09] language? I'm defeated. I'm no good. I'm
[2:10:12] this. I'm this. You are piling and
[2:10:15] exactly. And what you're actually doing
[2:10:18] is you identifying with the fleshly you.
[2:10:22] And in doing so, you are actually
[2:10:26] empowering that part of you to actually
[2:10:29] act more and more.
[2:10:33] Oh well, I'm just not the right kind of
[2:10:36] a Christian. He says, how can you come
[2:10:40] to God without God calling you first? It
[2:10:43] says all that he forneew them he also
[2:10:46] called. Is that right? And and all that
[2:10:49] he called them he also justified. Is
[2:10:51] that right? And all that he justified
[2:10:54] he says he had past tense already
[2:10:59] glorified.
[2:11:00] And we'll get into that glorify tomorrow
[2:11:03] Lord willing. It says now Bbam says it's
[2:11:06] a finished work
[2:11:08] from the foundation of the world.
[2:11:14] It's a finished work from the foundation
[2:11:18] of the world. Let me say this. We are
[2:11:21] just playing the drama. We are just
[2:11:24] playing some a part. We We're not even
[2:11:27] changing anything. WE'RE JUST PLAYING
[2:11:30] ALONG WITH WHAT GOD HAS ALREADY PLAYED.
[2:11:32] IF, let me say this, SAYS WHEN THE WORD
[2:11:35] IS SPOKEN, AS FAR AS GOD IS CONCERNED,
[2:11:38] IT'S DONE. It it COULD HAVE TAKEN 10,000
[2:11:42] world years and however many years. When
[2:11:45] God has spoken it, it will come to pass.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; He says in the rising of the sun or or
[2:11:55] or one of these messages, he says that
[2:11:57] the Holy Spirit is here hunting.
[2:12:02] Did you hear that? Hunting for the
[2:12:05] elect.
[2:12:10] You can't you can run but you can't
[2:12:12] hide.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; Let me just let you know that you can
[2:12:17] run but you're not going to hide from
[2:12:19] him. He's hunting for you. If he has to
[2:12:22] lay you flat on your bed, he on your
[2:12:24] back. He will do that. For all that is
[2:12:27] called will come. He will not lose a
[2:12:30] one. He says that all that the father
[2:12:33] has given me, I've kept them in my hands
[2:12:36] and I've not lost the one.
[2:12:43] It says,
[2:12:46] "So is your spiritual birth. You do
[2:12:49] things that you don't understand.
[2:12:52] When you were a little baby and you came
[2:12:54] to the altar and you gave a little baby,
[2:12:57] you came to the altar and you gave your
[2:12:58] heart to Christ, you do such thing,
[2:13:01] strange things. You wonder why you did
[2:13:03] it. But after a while, when you mature
[2:13:07] as a mature Christian, then you
[2:13:09] understand.
[2:13:13] Now I look back at at what was spoken to
[2:13:16] me when I was young. And I said, "Oh,
[2:13:19] I didn't see it, but he saw it. I didn't
[2:13:22] understand that.
[2:13:24] I saw what was the what the man said to
[2:13:27] me. I didn't understand. But now I look
[2:13:29] back, but understand." He said, "You
[2:13:32] don't understand." He says, "See, there
[2:13:34] is something that picked up. You see why
[2:13:38] you had to do it? Your spiritual birth,
[2:13:41] your natural birth touches your
[2:13:43] spiritual." He says how it's fitted in
[2:13:46] your life and as you grew everything
[2:13:49] fitted right because you were made for
[2:13:52] that.
[2:13:54] He says it was wasn't it strange things
[2:13:57] that the the night that you stagger into
[2:14:00] the mission the tent mission or that
[2:14:02] little church somewhere on the corner
[2:14:05] and something and something that the
[2:14:07] preacher preached or a certain subject
[2:14:09] and and you just fell right at the
[2:14:11] altar. You see and it says God knew that
[2:14:15] before the foundation of the world. It
[2:14:18] seems strange to you why you did that
[2:14:20] then but when you unders but you
[2:14:23] understood that you knew what happened.
[2:14:25] He says it's so fitted that it's so it's
[2:14:28] so fitted to you in this life and it's
[2:14:31] also it's fitted in the life to come. He
[2:14:35] says, "This world, this world and this
[2:14:38] life seems so advanced as we mature.
[2:14:41] Everything seems to go right with you.
[2:14:48] Our challenge is we want to know what's
[2:14:51] across the corner.
[2:14:54] &gt;&gt; What's coming, Lord? What do you want to
[2:14:55] do? What?" No, we are not called to know
[2:14:58] what's around the corner. We are not we
[2:15:00] are called to know what he said and to
[2:15:03] walk as he gives us the light to walk
[2:15:05] in.
[2:15:06] The scripture says walk in the light as
[2:15:09] he's in the light and the and the blood
[2:15:12] of Christ will cleanse you from all
[2:15:14] uncleanness. So, and I want to just
[2:15:16] hurry up so I can get to a close. It
[2:15:18] says when you when you look, it says the
[2:15:22] the trouble. And it says in Hebrew 4 and
[2:15:24] and 12, it says for every word of God is
[2:15:28] quick
[2:15:30] and powerful and sharp that every that
[2:15:34] every two edges sore. It pieces to every
[2:15:38] uh dividing a sound of the soul and the
[2:15:40] spirit and the join and the marrow and
[2:15:42] discerning the thoughts and the intents
[2:15:44] of the heart. He said, "Neither is he
[2:15:46] any creature, or it is not manifested in
[2:15:49] his sight, and all the things that are
[2:15:52] na are naked and open unto the eyes of
[2:15:55] him with whom we have to do.
[2:16:01] Everything is wide open before him."
[2:16:05] It's the word of God that does the
[2:16:07] dividing.
[2:16:09] It divides between soul and spirit. He
[2:16:13] knows exactly the the challenge that I
[2:16:16] find with us believer is yeah we are
[2:16:19] called to be
[2:16:22] a peculiar people to be a chosen people
[2:16:28] an odd people in the world but the
[2:16:30] challenge we run into is we fight it
[2:16:33] every time and we try to fit with the
[2:16:35] rest of the world. We try to walk like
[2:16:38] the world. We try to act like the world.
[2:16:41] who tried to do everything like the
[2:16:42] world when God has called us to be a
[2:16:45] different people.
[2:16:47] It's like Israel. Yeah, they are a
[2:16:50] chosen nation, a chosen separated people
[2:16:53] that God called. Yeah, they are. They
[2:16:55] want to be like every other nation. They
[2:16:57] want to have a king like everybody else.
[2:16:59] They want to have the fashion like
[2:17:01] everybody else. They want to partake of
[2:17:03] the the festivity and all the things
[2:17:05] that all the others were doing. Yeah,
[2:17:07] THEY ARE FORGETTATING THAT GOD CALLED
[2:17:09] THEM TO be a separated people.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; We are called to be in the rapture. They
[2:17:18] not. We are called to manifest Christ.
[2:17:21] They are not. We are called to be the
[2:17:24] bride of Christ in the end time. We are
[2:17:25] not. So therefore, we have to be
[2:17:28] careful. What is it that we associate
[2:17:30] ourselves with? What is it that we
[2:17:32] partake oursel with? Because what God
[2:17:35] wants us to be is to be like Mary to
[2:17:38] believe the word of God and let it bring
[2:17:41] to pass. What is it that he wants us to
[2:17:43] be?
[2:17:45] &gt;&gt; He said, "Be it unto me according to thy
[2:17:47] word." Lord, I don't know how you're
[2:17:50] going to manifest it, but I just want to
[2:17:51] believe the word. And and and in fact,
[2:17:54] what what I'm going to say,
[2:17:57] I love this in trying to do God a
[2:17:59] service without being his word, his
[2:18:01] will. It says
[2:18:04] God is promised in his word how that he
[2:18:08] will choose his bride in the last day.
[2:18:11] Did you know that he promised it? And he
[2:18:15] asked a question and said, "How will he
[2:18:16] do it?" And he said, "And by his
[2:18:20] original plan of choosing Christ, of
[2:18:23] choosing the time, choosing the season,
[2:18:26] he can't miss it." It says on his bride
[2:18:29] because she is part of his word. He
[2:18:32] can't choose it by denomination. He
[2:18:35] can't He didn't choose Christ by
[2:18:37] denomination. Did he choose? Did Christ
[2:18:40] come by denomination? Did he come by
[2:18:42] denomination? He says no. They rejected
[2:18:45] him. He says, "Well,
[2:18:48] that's what denomination done then." He
[2:18:50] said, "Then when he chooses a bride, how
[2:18:53] can he choose any other way?
[2:18:58] How did he bring Christ here? He says,
[2:19:01] "By the words of the prophets." I love
[2:19:05] that. He said, "Is that right? How did
[2:19:09] he bring how he how will he bring the
[2:19:12] bride here? By the word of the prophets.
[2:19:15] How did he identify him when he came by
[2:19:19] a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him
[2:19:22] come out of the wilderness?" And he
[2:19:24] asked a question, how will he identify
[2:19:27] his bride? He promised in Malachi 4 the
[2:19:31] same thing before he destroys the earth
[2:19:35] like he was in the days of Sodom and
[2:19:38] Gomorrah.
[2:19:40] By a prophet he identified the
[2:19:42] bridegroom. By a prophet he will
[2:19:45] identify the bride.
[2:19:47] How many believe he identified the bride
[2:19:49] in this end time?
[2:19:52] When he came to the identification in
[2:19:54] the bride, he looked at you and said,
[2:19:57] "You never done it in the first place."
[2:20:03] He looked at you, he said, "You are
[2:20:05] sinless. You are righteous. You are
[2:20:09] justified. You never done it in the
[2:20:11] first place."
[2:20:14] Now, that's amazing because you can
[2:20:17] actually have in your memory
[2:20:21] the very act that you did of sin,
[2:20:25] but he's here to tell you you never done
[2:20:29] it in the first place. My question to
[2:20:31] you, who did it? Then
[2:20:34] you know how he answered that question?
[2:20:36] He says it wasn't actually you. It was
[2:20:41] you were caught by your sinful parents.
[2:20:44] They actually through the sin that they
[2:20:46] had committed, they brought you into
[2:20:49] that. It was it wasn't actually you that
[2:20:52] wanted to do it that did it.
[2:20:57] Now the question is who is he speaking
[2:21:00] to? Is he speaking to this flesh or is
[2:21:03] he speaking about you that dwells inside
[2:21:05] of this flesh?
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; The flesh is guilty. WILL BE GUILTY
[2:21:10] ALWAYS. BUT THE REAL YOU, he says, was
[2:21:13] created in the image of God AND CAN
[2:21:16] NEVER SIN. IN FACT, HE says what you
[2:21:19] done, he took it and he dropped it into
[2:21:23] the blood bleach. And I love it. The
[2:21:26] prophet explained it one time. He says,
[2:21:27] he says, "Now I want you to realize the
[2:21:30] power that the bleach has. When you drop
[2:21:32] the blood into the bleach, it breaks the
[2:21:36] molecules and the atoms and it brings it
[2:21:39] into its original state before it became
[2:21:43] a stain.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; how can a man preach like that? How can
[2:21:50] a MAN THIS IS THE MIND OF GOD THAT'S
[2:21:52] BEING REVEALED TO US. This is NOT SOME
[2:21:55] NICE WORDS FOR SOMEBODY TO SAY. This is
[2:21:58] the reality of the word speaking to you
[2:22:00] tonight.
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS AS FAR AS GOD IS CONCERNED, it
[2:22:08] never existed.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; You can't find it. He dropped it in the
[2:22:14] sea of God forgetfulness. But how many
[2:22:16] times do we go to God and say, "Oh, God,
[2:22:19] and you know, I lied and I did this and
[2:22:21] I did this." And he's looking at you and
[2:22:23] saying, "I don't know what you're
[2:22:25] talking about.
[2:22:28] I don't know what you're talking about.
[2:22:32] You know why? But one of them says the
[2:22:35] the blood of Christ had the power to
[2:22:39] wash and take away your past, present,
[2:22:44] and future sin.
[2:22:57] What other identification do we want?
[2:23:02] He said it himself.
[2:23:05] He made it known to you
[2:23:08] that you are actually me, the real you.
[2:23:12] It's not YOUR FLESH. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP
[2:23:14] IN YOUR FLESH.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. YOU WILL FIGHT YOUR
[2:23:18] FLESH until the day you are in the
[2:23:20] grave. That's given. THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S
[2:23:23] WHAT we have to battle with as long as
[2:23:25] we are in THIS EARTH. BUT DO NOT LET
[2:23:27] YOUR FLESH cause you to do something or
[2:23:31] to go in the wrong direction. Why?
[2:23:33] Because it has nothing to do. GOD
[2:23:35] DOESN'T EVEN COUNT IT.
[2:23:42] He says the real you. Oh, let me just
[2:23:45] read it. I'm I'm trying to summarize it
[2:23:47] so I can save time, but let me just read
[2:23:49] it.
[2:23:51] It says,
[2:23:59] it says in the marriage of the lamb, it
[2:24:01] says
[2:24:03] and the ceremony says they there's no
[2:24:05] more it's no more her her own name or
[2:24:08] whatever. It says then then when the
[2:24:11] church has come to the ceremony, they
[2:24:13] promise to take the bridegroom names and
[2:24:15] she's no longer the church of the world.
[2:24:17] She's the church of the Lord Jesus
[2:24:19] Christ. It says man, it says I don't
[2:24:21] mean by name. I mean by birth, by
[2:24:25] nature, by power.
[2:24:29] He because remember the the the opening
[2:24:34] of the seals is there to bring us into
[2:24:38] such a condition where sin has no power
[2:24:41] over us. Is there to bring us butam says
[2:24:45] Satan's army bring diseases and certain
[2:24:47] army bring all kinds of diseases and
[2:24:50] deception and all kinds of things. I'm
[2:24:52] just paragraphing but he says God's army
[2:24:55] is here so he can cast him out for
[2:24:57] everything that he brings. If it brings
[2:24:59] diseases, we are here to cast it out. If
[2:25:02] it brings deception, we are here to cast
[2:25:04] it out at the word of God. You are
[2:25:06] actually be called to be HERE AS GOD'S
[2:25:10] LINE OF DEFENSE.
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; Now imagine a line of defense that's
[2:25:19] wavering. Am I of him or am I not of
[2:25:22] him? Am I? Let me say this. Oh, brother,
[2:25:25] let me TELL YOU. WHO SOLDIER HAS EVER
[2:25:27] GONE TO war and not even got a scar?
[2:25:32] The challenge WE HAVE IS WE HAVE PEOPLE
[2:25:34] IN UNIFORM that's ever been in any
[2:25:36] battle.
[2:25:40] You there's going to be MISTAKES MADE.
[2:25:42] THERE'S GOING TO BE THINGS SAID that's
[2:25:44] not going to BE GOOD. THERE'S GOING TO
[2:25:45] BE HURTS. THERE'S GOING TO BE ALL OF
[2:25:47] THAT. BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU FROM
[2:25:49] BEING A CHRISTIAN. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
[2:25:52] A MISTAKE. YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THIS.
[2:25:53] YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS. YOU'RE GOING TO
[2:25:55] DO ALL OF THAT. THAT'S WHY I MADE A
[2:25:56] STATEMENT. I SAID IT'S SUCH A CHALLENGE
[2:25:59] TO EXPRESS THE LIVING GOD WITHIN THIS
[2:26:01] FLESH.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE TO FIGHT IT SO THE
[2:26:05] REAL EXPRESSION CAN COME OUT.
[2:26:08] &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU. YOU KEEP
[2:26:10] EXPRESSING HIM. YOU KEEP EXPRESSING HIM.
[2:26:12] AND GUESS WHAT? HE MADE A PROMISE THAT
[2:26:15] THIS FLESH WILL BE BROUGHT UNDER
[2:26:17] subjection by the spirit that rises
[2:26:20] inside of you. ONE DAY YOU WILL EXPRESS
[2:26:23] HIM THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO. ONE DAY
[2:26:25] YOU'LL SPEAK THE PERFECT WORD. ONE DAY
[2:26:27] YOU WILL COME OUT WITH A PERFECT
[2:26:29] EXPRESSION. WHY? Because he promised
[2:26:32] that you will do it.
[2:26:41] He says
[2:26:57] He says
[2:26:59] in the invisible union,
[2:27:07] he actually calls this
[2:27:10] the prophecy of the bride in the end
[2:27:13] time.
[2:27:16] You go listen to it.
[2:27:19] The prophecy of the bride in the end
[2:27:21] time.
[2:27:23] It says her name is Miss Grace.
[2:27:30] The unmmerited favor of Almighty God.
[2:27:37] Brother says, I love it. He says, "Grace
[2:27:41] is old."
[2:27:46] You know when Maine was supposed to die
[2:27:48] and when all of this when he have done
[2:27:51] wrong and all of this and he said when
[2:27:53] the judgment was about to be pronounced
[2:27:56] grace stepped in
[2:27:59] changed the outcome of what we were
[2:28:02] supposed to reap.
[2:28:05] He says she's an elected woman.
[2:28:09] For it's by grace we are saved, not of
[2:28:11] ourselves,
[2:28:13] not what we can, whatever we can do is
[2:28:16] not counted to us. Grace is what saves
[2:28:19] us. May I add this woman grace? May I
[2:28:23] place her in the Bible also? It's called
[2:28:28] the elected lady.
[2:28:31] This misgrace I'm going to talk about.
[2:28:34] The Bible declares that she's an elected
[2:28:37] lady. And if you notice, elected comes
[2:28:40] from the word elected lady. One lady
[2:28:45] among all others.
[2:28:50] Now
[2:28:52] what year is this?
[2:28:56] This is 1965.
[2:29:01] only a matter of few months the prophet
[2:29:05] will be taken and he's basically
[2:29:09] pouring his heart out of what the end
[2:29:13] time message is supposed to produce and
[2:29:15] what we are supposed to be.
[2:29:18] He says, "Like the Virgin Mary,
[2:29:23] she was to bring forth the body of God.
[2:29:26] In the earth, she was elected woman. God
[2:29:30] chose Mary." God chose Mary. God chose
[2:29:36] you by predestination.
[2:29:38] And he says, it says, "But this elected
[2:29:42] lady, God is calling the elected lady,
[2:29:45] and you know it. She's a virtual bride.
[2:29:47] the word of the last church. She's
[2:29:49] elected lady of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:29:52] Jesus is the word. And how many believe
[2:29:54] that is right? It says then the bride is
[2:29:56] always part of the bridegroom. The bride
[2:29:58] is not some denomination. It says it
[2:30:01] will have to be the word manifested to
[2:30:04] be the bride of Christ. He promised to
[2:30:07] do it and he said how did he do it? He
[2:30:10] says he lo he says he loses his pattern.
[2:30:13] He says he also did it by his pattern.
[2:30:16] He he has he done it every time by the
[2:30:19] pattern. He says he does it again
[2:30:21] calling out a virtual a virtuous bride
[2:30:24] in the last day. The lovely Rebecca
[2:30:27] waiting for the Isaac.
[2:30:30] And and he continues on. He says
[2:30:33] he says, "Well, you
[2:30:37] well you separated from your first union
[2:30:41] by spiritual death. Now you were born
[2:30:45] again or remarry again.
[2:30:50] Think about that. Remarry means you had
[2:30:54] to be married before.
[2:30:57] And he said that by predestination he
[2:31:01] put the waiting band of predestination
[2:31:04] on you before you can even come on
[2:31:07] earth.
[2:31:09] And he said the union with your flesh
[2:31:13] where union with your first husband
[2:31:15] could not even be lawful because you
[2:31:17] were already married.
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; How can you be married twice?
[2:31:28] Now how can the man be a sinner
[2:31:31] listening to this?
[2:31:36] How can you desire to do wrong when you
[2:31:39] hear something like this?
[2:31:41] I I think about the the example when I'm
[2:31:43] talked about this this couple that got
[2:31:45] married and and he says uh the sister
[2:31:48] she she's been in the word for a while
[2:31:50] and the brother was just a young brother
[2:31:52] in the me in the in the word and
[2:31:54] everything and she told him it says I I
[2:31:56] know you you you still a young man in
[2:31:58] the message and I still know you still
[2:32:00] just you have just known the Lord and
[2:32:02] everything and said but what I want you
[2:32:04] to do it says when you go out whatever
[2:32:07] happens to you you need to come home.
[2:32:11] Whatever happens to you, know that you
[2:32:15] have a wife here waiting for you.
[2:32:20] What a security.
[2:32:22] What a guarantee.
[2:32:24] Let me say this. That's why God can
[2:32:26] never lose a one because he's provided
[2:32:30] all ways possible for you to come in.
[2:32:35] He's made He's purchased the price. He's
[2:32:38] done all all that he's asking us tonight
[2:32:41] is to believe
[2:32:44] the identification the identity of his
[2:32:47] word.
[2:32:49] I'll call I'll just say what brother
[2:32:50] Jonathan told me. He said and I I just
[2:32:53] he said it's like the white dog and the
[2:32:56] black dog. Whoever you feed of which
[2:32:59] nature that's what you're going to
[2:33:01] manifest.
[2:33:03] And let I say to you, my brother, my
[2:33:05] sister, tonight, let's feed the white
[2:33:07] dog. Let's give him the word. Let's give
[2:33:10] him prayer. Let's give him our prophet
[2:33:13] told us we need to read our Bibles and
[2:33:14] pray. When you do that, you are
[2:33:17] strengthening. The Holy Spirit lives by
[2:33:20] the word of God. Let's feed him. We will
[2:33:22] become that invincible army.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Let's feed him. Let's feed on the word
[2:33:29] of God. You are what you feed on. If you
[2:33:32] feed the word, you will manifest the
[2:33:34] word. If you feed on the worldly things,
[2:33:37] you The law of reproduction is what goes
[2:33:40] in is what comes out.
[2:33:43] It's not magic.
[2:33:45] The question is, what are we feeding on?
[2:33:51] Let's feed on the word and we'll
[2:33:52] manifest the word. If the musician could
[2:33:54] come,
[2:33:57] it says,
[2:33:59] I love this.
[2:34:04] Now
[2:34:06] notice you are not only that but you are
[2:34:10] going to the wedding supper in the sky
[2:34:12] and you are wearing your wedding band of
[2:34:15] predestination unmmerited favor the
[2:34:17] grace the wedding band of the grace
[2:34:21] unmmerited of your of your of our of our
[2:34:24] God of of your own. It says God did it
[2:34:27] himself. He knew you before the
[2:34:30] foundation of the world. So he slipped
[2:34:32] the wedding band of predestination and
[2:34:34] he puts your name on the book. What
[2:34:37] thanksgiving? He calls this his
[2:34:39] thanksgiving message. He says now the
[2:34:42] old book is gone. The old union. He says
[2:34:45] now your name is is is has been
[2:34:48] transferred. Now he says do you mean to
[2:34:50] tell me my old book? It says God put it
[2:34:53] in the sea of forgetfulness. You stand
[2:34:57] perfect before God. It says, "Now your
[2:34:59] name is now in the new book, not the
[2:35:03] book of life, but in the lamb's book of
[2:35:05] life." What was what the lamb has
[2:35:07] redeemed, not the old book, not your old
[2:35:10] union, but the new the bride. He says
[2:35:14] the but your new bride. It says,
[2:35:16] hallelujah. Your new life is in the
[2:35:18] lamb's book of life. Your marriage
[2:35:21] certificate.
[2:35:24] Oh, you actually have something to prove
[2:35:28] that you are actually married.
[2:35:32] You have actually the word of God to
[2:35:35] prove the certificate. And he gave you
[2:35:38] the Holy Spirit
[2:35:41] so you can know.
[2:35:44] And he gave you that as the ticket, as
[2:35:47] the token for what he has done for you
[2:35:51] to prove to you that this is your word.
[2:35:54] This is your identification.
[2:36:01] So we are not making empty claims. We
[2:36:05] actually have the proof of it. the life
[2:36:09] that we live, the seed of God inside of
[2:36:12] our heart, the heartbeat that's leading
[2:36:15] us every day.
[2:36:18] Hallelujah. He says where
[2:36:22] your true eternal germ
[2:36:27] is from.
[2:36:29] Where your true eternal jerm
[2:36:33] from the beginning takes hold.
[2:36:40] The real germ of who you are takes hold
[2:36:45] into the mind of God in the beginning.
[2:36:50] My I'm actually not human.
[2:36:56] This flesh was only a part of what the
[2:37:00] earth was. Remember the scripture says
[2:37:02] when God created man, man was created in
[2:37:06] the image of God. What was that man? It
[2:37:08] wasn't this flesh. The flesh, the
[2:37:10] scripture says it was gi given for the
[2:37:12] purpose of contacting the ground. And
[2:37:15] it's given for the purpose of
[2:37:17] manifesting
[2:37:19] what's inside.
[2:37:24] I'm actually a God that's walking in the
[2:37:28] flesh. My question to you, what came
[2:37:30] before? Is it the flesh or is it the
[2:37:32] germ?
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Because what came before will always
[2:37:35] win?
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; What came before, sickness or healing?
[2:37:40] &gt;&gt; What came before? Is it your negativity
[2:37:42] or is it the positive?
[2:37:46] Why are we dwelling in the negative?
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Why are we wavering? Why are we dwelling
[2:37:54] so much in the negativity? My brother,
[2:37:56] my sister, the scripture says, "Look up
[2:37:59] for your redemption draweth nigh.
[2:38:02] I I don't care what the enemy brings at
[2:38:05] you. Just remind him that I know I come
[2:38:09] from God." We can actually today by the
[2:38:12] word of God say I come from God I go
[2:38:16] back to God. So not only Jesus can say
[2:38:19] that we can say that too.
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; That's not what denomination taught you.
[2:38:27] But what is this? The revelation
[2:38:30] of the end time bride by the word of God
[2:38:34] by the prophet messenger to make you a
[2:38:37] perfect bride.
[2:38:40] It says
[2:38:44] justify doesn't mean
[2:38:48] justify. Justify doesn't mean forgiven.
[2:38:52] Justify is as though is never done it in
[2:38:55] the first place. But the word justify is
[2:38:58] is as if you you have not done it in the
[2:39:00] first place. It says but it's not even
[2:39:04] regarded. It says how is it done in
[2:39:08] God's book of forget or sea of
[2:39:10] forgetfulness your old book and your
[2:39:13] your old marriage is divorce and death
[2:39:16] it's not even in God's memory he says
[2:39:19] you are justified therefore being
[2:39:22] justified
[2:39:24] it was it was accused and it was accused
[2:39:29] and but you never done it in the first
[2:39:32] place. Your old union is in the sea of
[2:39:36] God's forgetfulness.
[2:39:41] I I I just want you to to to just take a
[2:39:44] moment and realize how powerful that is.
[2:39:49] God
[2:39:50] took your old life
[2:39:53] out of existence.
[2:39:57] Out of existence.
[2:40:01] You say out of existence. Yeah. Even the
[2:40:03] prophet couldn't find it.
[2:40:06] Is that right?
[2:40:09] Even the prophet, it says no fishing.
[2:40:13] Including the prophet cannot go back
[2:40:15] once it's under the sea of
[2:40:17] forgetfulness.
[2:40:19] It's as though it never existed. Now,
[2:40:22] let me say this. The challenge you still
[2:40:24] face is the enemy by the memory. He's
[2:40:28] trying to all constantly bring it up and
[2:40:31] say, "You done this, you done this, you
[2:40:34] done this." Boy, by the flesh. Remember,
[2:40:37] he has access to this and he will come
[2:40:39] constantly. But you have to remind him
[2:40:42] by the word of God. That's not me.
[2:40:45] That's not me. That's not me. That's not
[2:40:48] what the word SAID I WAS. I ACTUALLY
[2:40:50] WHAT? THAT WAS I did it because of you.
[2:40:54] It was by deception, but that was my
[2:40:56] intention. My original intention was not
[2:40:59] even to do it.
[2:41:03] But what I'm say the scripture says it
[2:41:05] says who can accuse the seed of God?
[2:41:12] Who?
[2:41:13] Why? Because when the seed of God
[2:41:16] remains in you, there is no way sin can
[2:41:19] be attributed to you.
[2:41:22] It's justification.
[2:41:24] It's sanctification. It's God himself
[2:41:27] making himself known. You never done it
[2:41:30] in the first place. Your old union. It
[2:41:31] says the bride is so he bore your shame
[2:41:34] himself for you and he took your place.
[2:41:37] He took your place for you and it says
[2:41:40] for your for your predestination for him
[2:41:42] to be his bride before the foundation of
[2:41:45] the world. And the Bible says so you are
[2:41:47] the predestinated seed. And he says
[2:41:51] this, "Your fa your first waiting was an
[2:41:56] old."
[2:41:59] Whoops.
[2:42:01] Gone.
[2:42:04] No proof of it.
[2:42:12] Gone. I did this. I did that. I did
[2:42:16] this. Gone.
[2:42:21] In closing, let me just say this.
[2:42:25] I think of God
[2:42:28] in the beginning sitting in
[2:42:31] the scripture says he will come down in
[2:42:33] the cool of the evening part and they
[2:42:36] will sit with Adam and said,
[2:42:39] "Adam,
[2:42:40] how are you doing today?" And Adam said,
[2:42:42] "Father, I'm good." He said, "What did
[2:42:44] you do today?" He said, "Father, you
[2:42:45] know, we sat here, the wind was blowing
[2:42:47] this direction. You see that mountain?
[2:42:49] We moved it and everything and and he
[2:42:51] said, "Oh, father, you see those animal
[2:42:53] over there? I named them." It says that
[2:42:55] lion. And now remember the mind of God
[2:42:59] was in Adam. And therefore, Godam says
[2:43:02] when Adam named the animal, it was
[2:43:05] actually the same exact name that God
[2:43:08] intended to name them. It wasn't it was
[2:43:11] the same mind that was in God. It was
[2:43:13] also in Adam. Adam gave the animal names
[2:43:17] and Baram says it was according to their
[2:43:19] nature. And we understand that God never
[2:43:21] went and changed the names.
[2:43:24] It was said and said, "How's your day
[2:43:25] going?" And Adam will talk and
[2:43:27] everything. And then it came a time
[2:43:29] where God will come and he said,
[2:43:34] "Adam,
[2:43:35] do you know I'm a savior?"
[2:43:38] And Adam will look at himself. Father,
[2:43:41] what what does it mean to me? said they
[2:43:42] said well a savior means you know
[2:43:45] someone is lost and you know and
[2:43:47] everything he said
[2:43:50] I don't know it but you know you my
[2:43:52] father I believe you he said you know
[2:43:55] I'm a healer and they said what is
[2:43:58] healing means he said well healing means
[2:44:00] you are sick and you're afflicted and
[2:44:02] everything and and then you you get you
[2:44:05] get healed from that
[2:44:08] Adam said I don't know what that means
[2:44:12] Christ, the mystery of God revealed. And
[2:44:16] God comes and he says, "Well, Adam,
[2:44:19] I'm going to let something happen,
[2:44:23] but at the end of it, you will
[2:44:25] understand what I'm doing."
[2:44:28] My brother, my sister, all of this was
[2:44:31] done so when we are restored into the
[2:44:34] Garden of Eden, we'll have a much
[2:44:37] greater fellowship with him.
[2:44:44] When God comes there and he will come
[2:44:46] again and he says,
[2:44:48] "Children, do you know I'm a savior?"
[2:44:51] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:44:54] Do you know I'm a healer? Yes.
[2:44:57] We will actually know.
[2:45:02] What is this? THIS WAS A VERY LIMITED
[2:45:05] FELLOWSHIP. GOD WANTED to expand the
[2:45:08] fellowship. We would actually know. Let
[2:45:12] me say this. THAT'S WHY I want to tell
[2:45:14] you tonight. No matter what you're going
[2:45:17] through, remember Barbanam says that he
[2:45:20] became a man AND HE SUFFERED EVERYTHING
[2:45:23] THAT YOU suffering so he can become the
[2:45:27] high priest OF YOUR CONFESSION. SO HE
[2:45:29] WILL KNOW WHEN YOU TALK TO HIM WHAT IS
[2:45:31] IT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT EVEN
[2:45:34] MORE SO, WHAT HE WANTS AT THE END, HE
[2:45:37] COULDN'T LET YOU BE SICK UNLESS HE CAN
[2:45:39] HEAL YOU. BUT WHAT HE WANTS AT THE END,
[2:45:41] SO WE CAN HAVE a much greater fellowship
[2:45:44] with him.
[2:45:46] &gt;&gt; Fellowship in his fullness.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; Fellowship with actually who he is and
[2:45:55] every single one of his attributes.
[2:45:57] We'll sit there. The angel will have no
[2:46:00] clue what's happening in heaven.
[2:46:04] They will look at us and say, "These
[2:46:07] children's really lost their mind. They
[2:46:09] love their father." Why? Because we'll
[2:46:12] be there just dancing and shouting and
[2:46:15] just praising our Lord every day.
[2:46:17] Because every word that comes out of his
[2:46:19] mouth will mean so much to us. Why?
[2:46:22] Because we've actually had the
[2:46:25] opportunity to experience it and to know
[2:46:28] who our father is. He didn't let you do
[2:46:31] it. He secured you first before he can
[2:46:35] let you come because he couldn't allow
[2:46:37] that to happen. So at the end he will
[2:46:40] lose you. He wouldn't. God is not in the
[2:46:44] business of losing his own. He's in the
[2:46:46] business of what he started with. That's
[2:46:49] what he's going to end with. God bless
[2:46:51] you. Let's all stand.
[2:46:55] I'm so sorry. I just took my liberty. I
[2:46:57] feel like I went a little bit too long.
[2:47:02] That's what God desires out of us.
[2:47:05] Oh my.
[2:47:07] I tell you, when you believe this
[2:47:09] message, you're walking on cloud9.
[2:47:13] I mean, sometimes I feel like, you know,
[2:47:15] I'm walking on the earth, but I just
[2:47:17] feel like I'm floating. It It's such
[2:47:20] wonderful in the heart. It It's just a
[2:47:23] fellowship. And he doesn't want this
[2:47:25] just for one. He want it from the
[2:47:27] youngest to the oldest. He wants you to
[2:47:29] have that experience. He wants you to
[2:47:32] know him one by one, but for yourself so
[2:47:36] you can have that communion with him.
[2:47:38] God don't want to have a relationship
[2:47:42] that he has to go through somebody else.
[2:47:44] No, he wants to talk to you and know you
[2:47:48] and he wants to fellowship with you so
[2:47:50] you can know him for yourself. Amen. How
[2:47:54] many desire that tonight? Let's just
[2:47:56] let's just bow our heads. Our gracious
[2:47:59] father,
[2:48:01] your word is eternal, Lord. And father,
[2:48:04] we can talk from morning till night. We
[2:48:06] will never cover everything that you
[2:48:09] done for us. Lord, we know one thing
[2:48:12] within our hearts. We know that there's
[2:48:15] something that beats within our hearts.
[2:48:17] And father, that doesn't desire desire
[2:48:20] the manifestation of yesterday. No Lord,
[2:48:23] we desire the manifestation of this
[2:48:25] hour. Lord, we've
[2:48:28] we've heard word after word, message
[2:48:30] after messages, but Lord, we know our
[2:48:33] heart is hungering. And even as the
[2:48:36] scripture will say that nature is
[2:48:38] groaning and for the manifestation of
[2:48:40] true sons and daughters of God, we
[2:48:43] ourselves are groaning also that you may
[2:48:46] be known and made manifest into our
[2:48:48] hearts, Lord. Father, forgive us, Lord,
[2:48:51] if we said anything that's not pleasing
[2:48:52] to you. But Father, I pray tonight, may
[2:48:55] you just lift us up, oh God, into the
[2:48:57] heavenly realm. You said we are already
[2:49:00] sitting in heavenly places. Father, give
[2:49:03] us victory that we may overcome. You
[2:49:05] said the word was given us for us to
[2:49:07] defeat the devil. Father, when we go out
[2:49:10] and out of these meetings and out of
[2:49:12] this, Father, when the devil comes
[2:49:14] before us, when a challenge comes before
[2:49:16] us, Lord, let us not forget who we are,
[2:49:19] let us stand by the revelation that
[2:49:21] you've given us. Let us claim what
[2:49:24] belongs to us. Father, let us live the
[2:49:26] life of sons and daughters that the
[2:49:28] world may see. Father, we don't want to
[2:49:30] be a reproach. We want to actually be
[2:49:33] what you've called us to be every day of
[2:49:35] our life, the living bride of Christ.
[2:49:38] Father, the living word, the living
[2:49:40] manner, the living God, the living in us
[2:49:43] every day, manifesting himself to this
[2:49:46] dying world. That's what we desire above
[2:49:48] all. I ask for every uplifted hand and
[2:49:51] and hearts, oh God, tonight just come
[2:49:53] and do a work, Lord. Father, come and
[2:49:56] fill fill us up with yourself, Lord,
[2:49:58] that we may go out of here different
[2:50:00] people that we could say it was good to
[2:50:02] be in the presence of the Lord. We're so
[2:50:04] thankful for what you do. Father, I pray
[2:50:06] for this church and for this min
[2:50:08] ministry here, Lord. May you just
[2:50:10] continue to reveal yourself more because
[2:50:13] we live by revelation, Lord. And Father,
[2:50:15] we live by what? That which you make
[2:50:17] alive to us. And that's what we desire.
[2:50:20] That the word may not become a dead
[2:50:22] letter, but every day, Lord, that you
[2:50:24] may become a God that walks among us,
[2:50:26] that speaks to us, talk to us, that we
[2:50:29] can touch and a God with skin on him, a
[2:50:32] God that lives in one another. That's
[2:50:34] the one we desire. Lord, we're so
[2:50:36] thankful. We commit all that we are and
[2:50:39] ask all of this in the lovely name of
[2:50:41] the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen.
[2:50:47] Amen.
[2:50:50] Amen. Kill them.
[2:50:56] Open [singing] our eyes,
[2:51:00] Lord.

[3:08:44] up. Rising up. He'll break every chain.
[3:08:49] To break every chain. To break every
[3:08:53] chain. [music]
[3:08:56] to break every chain. To break every
[3:08:59] chain. To break every chain.
[3:09:05] And there is power [music]
[3:09:08] in the [singing] name of Jesus.
[3:09:14] There is power [singing]
[3:09:16] [music]
[3:09:17] in the name of Jesus.
[3:09:22] There is power [music and singing]
[3:09:25] in the name of Jesus
[3:09:30] to break every chain. To break every
[3:09:34] chain. To break every [singing]
[3:09:36] chain. [music]
[3:09:39] To break every chain. to break every
[3:09:43] chain. [music] to break every chain.
[3:09:48] It's already done. [snorts]
[3:09:53] It's already [singing] done.
[3:09:59] Oh,
[3:10:01] it's already [singing]
[3:10:04] done.
[3:10:09] The battle [singing] is over.
[3:10:13] The victory
[3:10:15] is won.
[3:10:18] Oh, it's [singing] already done.
[3:10:22] And I'm already healed. [music]
[3:10:28] Oh,
[3:10:30] [music] I'm [singing] already
[3:10:33] healed.
[3:10:37] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:10:38] &gt;&gt; The battle is over. [singing]
[3:10:42] The victory is won.
[3:10:46] And I'm [singing] already [music]
[3:10:48] healed.
[3:10:50] And it's already done.
[3:10:56] Oh,
[3:10:58] and it's [singing and music] already
[3:11:01] done.
[3:11:05] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:11:06] &gt;&gt; The battle is over.
[3:11:10] The victory is [singing] won.
[3:11:15] [music] It's already done.
[3:11:18] And [singing] I'm already healed.
[3:11:22] [music]
[3:11:24] Oh,
[3:11:27] I'm already
[3:11:29] healed. [music]
[3:11:34] The battle [singing]
[3:11:36] is over.
[3:11:38] The victory [music]
[3:11:40] is won. [singing]
[3:11:42] And I'm already here.
[3:11:49] Amen. We're going to sing that song, My
[3:11:51] Hope, 1088, before we close. But
[3:11:55] I don't want to preach again, but there
[3:11:57] are so many good things in there.
[3:12:00] But as he was preaching, I it drew me
[3:12:02] back to something I just read recently
[3:12:04] in my devotions. And Paul said in
[3:12:06] Corinthians, "We have this treasure in
[3:12:08] earthn vessels
[3:12:10] that the excellency of the power may be
[3:12:13] of God
[3:12:14] &gt;&gt; and not of us.
[3:12:18] So my hope is not in me.
[3:12:22] My trust is not in me.
[3:12:24] &gt;&gt; My faith is not in me. My faith is in
[3:12:27] the elective calling of God Almighty.
[3:12:32] &gt;&gt; And that I take him at his word and the
[3:12:35] word will take me back to him.
[3:12:38] &gt;&gt; That's my rest.
[3:12:40] &gt;&gt; That's my rest. I like what he said. He
[3:12:43] said if you wake up and say, "Am I a
[3:12:44] Christian today?" I hope we're not
[3:12:46] saying this. But what he didn't what he
[3:12:48] also said is, "Sometimes I don't feel
[3:12:49] like a Christian.
[3:12:52] Sometimes I don't act like a Christian.
[3:12:54] Sometimes I don't think like a
[3:12:55] Christian. Sometimes I don't react like
[3:12:57] a Christian. That is not what I'm
[3:12:59] dwelling on.
[3:13:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:13:01] &gt;&gt; Looking unto Jesus, the author and
[3:13:03] finisher of our faith. Not looking unto
[3:13:05] Jonathan, the author and finisher of my
[3:13:07] faith, but looking unto Jesus, the
[3:13:09] author and finisher of my faith. My hope
[3:13:11] is in him.
[3:13:13] &gt;&gt; My trust is in him. My faith is in him.
[3:13:15] My faith is in a finished work. And I'm
[3:13:18] just walking through the drama he's
[3:13:19] already laid out in his word for you.
[3:13:22] and the drama he's laid out his word for
[3:13:23] I. That's where my rest is. That's where
[3:13:25] my daily walk is. And when we wake up in
[3:13:28] the morning and we say, "I am a child of
[3:13:31] God."
[3:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:32] &gt;&gt; And because we are sons, because we are
[3:13:36] daughters, he has given us his spirit.
[3:13:38] Amen. He has sent forth his spirit into
[3:13:42] our hearts crying, "Abba, father."
[3:13:45] &gt;&gt; And my rising of the morning is, "Aba,
[3:13:48] father, I'm coming to you, Lord. I'm
[3:13:50] walking in your direction today. I'm
[3:13:53] stepping into your life today.
[3:13:55] &gt;&gt; I'm stepping into your reality today.
[3:13:58] And Lord, let me not see it through the
[3:14:00] eyes of flesh, but let me see through
[3:14:02] the eyes of faith. I'm one step closer
[3:14:04] to glory. I'm one step closer to a
[3:14:07] perfect image of Christ revealed in
[3:14:09] flesh. One more time. If only the
[3:14:12] portion, that's all he's asking me to
[3:14:14] be. Be the portion I've given you today.
[3:14:16] Lord,
[3:14:17] &gt;&gt; don't outwalk your confession. Say,
[3:14:19] "Lord, let me walk in what you've given
[3:14:20] me. And as you open it up, as you show
[3:14:23] me where to go, let me walk into that
[3:14:25] next step." Amen. My hope is in you. My
[3:14:28] rest is in you. My trust is in you,
[3:14:30] Lord. The arm of flesh fails. The mind
[3:14:34] of flesh fails. The will of the flesh
[3:14:36] fails. The discipline of the flesh
[3:14:38] fails. Even if you're a German,
[3:14:41] &gt;&gt; it fails. But he never fails.
[3:14:44] &gt;&gt; He's never failed me yet. I failed him
[3:14:46] many times. He's never failed me.
[3:14:49] &gt;&gt; And so my hope it tonight is not in me.
[3:14:52] My hope is in him. My trust is in him.
[3:14:55] My faith is in him. And it says here, I
[3:14:57] stand in awe within the presence of the
[3:14:59] Lord.
[3:15:02] &gt;&gt; What did he What was the quote you said?
[3:15:04] And I remembered it. Are we sufficiently
[3:15:07] &gt;&gt; impressed
[3:15:09] with the word in our presence?
[3:15:14] Are we sufficiently impressed by what he
[3:15:18] has done and what he is doing? I was
[3:15:20] talking to to a brother the other day
[3:15:22] and I said, "Do you realize we're in the
[3:15:24] midst of prophecy being fulfilled?" But
[3:15:28] the thing is, we can see it happening
[3:15:30] around us, but can we see it in us?
[3:15:33] &gt;&gt; That's what we heard tonight is he's
[3:15:35] asking us to see, can you see the
[3:15:38] prophecy coming forth in you?
[3:15:42] It's good to see it in Sister Brenda.
[3:15:44] It's good to see it in in Brother Grant.
[3:15:47] But can you see it in you?
[3:15:49] &gt;&gt; Cuz that's where it has to happen.
[3:15:52] &gt;&gt; I liked and I hated what he said
[3:15:53] simultaneously. He says, "If there's one
[3:15:55] person going, it's going to be me, not
[3:15:57] your pastor."
[3:15:59] I said, "Hold on a second here.
[3:16:02] How about it's me and my pastor? Can't I
[3:16:05] take somebody with me?" But the
[3:16:08] confidence that I have met a living God
[3:16:10] and he has changed me from a creature of
[3:16:13] time to a creature of eternity.
[3:16:17] And when I wake up in the morning to
[3:16:19] when I lay my head down at night, my
[3:16:22] eyes, my mind are set on things above,
[3:16:26] &gt;&gt; things that are higher.
[3:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:29] &gt;&gt; Things that are nobler. These have all
[3:16:32] my sight. I'm going to hasten to him.
[3:16:34] Amen. Let's lift our eyes up tonight.
[3:16:38] We've got an early service tomorrow,
[3:16:39] 9:00 a.m. Can I give you a pastoral
[3:16:42] request?
[3:16:43] Go home. Don't pick up your phone. Don't
[3:16:46] pick up your tablet. Don't pick up your
[3:16:47] computer. Go home and if you're going to
[3:16:49] do anything, talk about the service
[3:16:51] tonight. And then pray and lay your head
[3:16:54] down and wake up in the morning well
[3:16:56] rested so you can come back and get part
[3:16:58] two for what he preached tonight. No
[3:17:00] doubt. Amen. Can we do that? Can we do
[3:17:03] that tonight? Let's sing this. Let's
[3:17:05] say, "Lord, my hope and my trust is in
[3:17:07] you, and I'm coming back tomorrow to get
[3:17:08] my other portion. I'm coming tomorrow
[3:17:10] for my daily bread one more time, and
[3:17:12] I'm going to trust that you're going to
[3:17:14] use Brother Billy to speak to us again."
[3:17:15] Can we do that tonight? Amen. Let's sing
[3:17:18] this before we close. Amen. Brother
[3:17:21] Mark, I'm going to ask you to close in
[3:17:23] prayer tonight after we've sung this, if
[3:17:24] that would be okay. Remember, Brother
[3:17:26] Billy in prayer. Tomorrow, we've got the
[3:17:28] early morning service because he's got
[3:17:29] to fly out at 1:30 and so we're we're on
[3:17:32] a time crunch. He's only got 3 hours
[3:17:34] tomorrow,
[3:17:36] which isn't too bad. That's about what
[3:17:38] we've had so far today. So, let's come
[3:17:40] back. Let's come back rested. Let's come
[3:17:42] back ready. And let's be prepared to
[3:17:44] hear the word of the Lord. Amen. We're
[3:17:46] going to sing this as we close.
[3:17:48] I stand in awe within
[3:17:51] [singing and music]
[3:17:51] the presence of the Lord.
[3:17:57] In whom [singing] the wisdom [music] of
[3:18:00] the ages
[3:18:02] lies.
[3:18:04] [music]
[3:18:05] For whom the raging [singing]
[3:18:07] of the sea
[3:18:09] subsides,
[3:18:12] the [music and singing] living
[3:18:14] sacrifice,
[3:18:16] the only source
[3:18:19] of life, [music]
[3:18:21] my hope
[3:18:24] is in [singing] the Lord. [music]
[3:18:28] From this time on
[3:18:32] and ever [music and singing] more,
[3:18:35] oh my hope
[3:18:39] [music] is in [singing] the Lord
[3:18:43] forever more.
[3:18:47] And his [music] tender mercies come
[3:18:49] [singing]
[3:18:50] with every rising sun.
[3:18:54] [music]
[3:18:55] To [singing] meet the sinner in his
[3:18:58] brokenness,
[3:19:02] [music] to offer healing [singing] and
[3:19:05] forgiveness.
[3:19:08] [music]
[3:19:10] And those who trust in him will find
[3:19:15] [singing] their hearts
[3:19:17] at [music] rest. My hope
[3:19:22] is in the Lord.
[3:19:25] [music] From this time on
[3:19:29] and ever more.

[3:20:19] is [music] in [singing] the Lord

[3:20:27] and ever more.

[3:20:35] [music] is in [singing]
[3:20:36] the Lord
[3:20:39] forever more.
