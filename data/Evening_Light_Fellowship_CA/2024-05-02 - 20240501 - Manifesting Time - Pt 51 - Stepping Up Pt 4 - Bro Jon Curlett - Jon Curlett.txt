Lord that we would be a witness Lord in all of these times Lord of your goodness and your grace in our lives Lord would you just bless us now bless your word Lord bless the bless the ministering of your word Lord open our our hearts Lord open our ears open our eyes this evening Lord to see what you have for us each one Lord we ask your grace to those that aren't here tonight Lord praying your special touch on them each one in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Revelations chapter 1 and the sharp ey of you may have noticed I have a new Bible up here but it's my devotions Bible and it's got the Amplified on one side and it's got the King James on the other side and I really like doing that in the morning but it's it's absolutely massive and it takes you forever to find something because every page is only half of the Bible but I my my original Bible from 2001 my wife gave it to me the first year we were married as a present is falling apart and so I sent it out to get rebound so hopefully I'll have that back within two or three or four weeks Lord willing but for now I've got to use this this big clunky thing up here amen so it's kind of strange so I'm glad I've got it in my notes because I think we'd add another 20 minutes to service just trying to find everything in this Bible amen but it's good to be here this evening good to see each one amen I had to take my studded snow tires off by law today so I'm trusting that the the winter weather and the snow and the cold and the freezing and all that is going away as well by law hopefully amen but I'm trusting the Lord to just feed us his bread tonight Revelation 1 verse4 says this it says John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come you'll notice that peace is because he's there amen he's not just there yesterday and he's not just here today but he says I'm going to be here I was there and I'm going to be here and I'm going to keep being here and your my peace will come with me in all those times he says in from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and had made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing our our series on manifesting time and yes I'm to take a fourth service on stepping up and really this is this stepping up portion is probably the end of the the adoption series as we've been speaking on and we've been talking about us us as children in the kingdom of God not just coming to a realization that we are children of God but that we have a position and we have a role and we're not just here to sit on our couches or on our comfy padded pews but we're here to be about the father's business amen that we're supposed to be mature Believers and the purpose of adoption is to place us into our kingdom of of Heaven purpose our kingdom of God purpose according to his will I want to start with this quote brother brand would say after that some was adopted his name on the checkbook was just as good as his daddy's now can you imagine can you imagine maybe speaking to my son or the young son's here can you imagine that your daddy says you get access to my bank account because maybe our young men have saved up and maybe the best of us maybe the best of them might have maybe $1,000 but they know that Daddy buys things and he doesn't have to think about it and and he has massive wealth compared to his son and so can you imagine that opportunity to just write a check and and your dad says whatever you write a check for I'll make sure the money's in the bank that's what he says he says that's where God's trying to get his church that they realize that not only do they have a father and not only does he have a bank account amen but he's got an unlimited store in that bank account to meet the needs and the desires even of his very children he says just say to this mountain be moved and it will move he says Authority sons of God the whole creation's groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God waiting to a spot to where that sickness will be arise and it will be that way the blind will receive their sight Now Catch what he says here he says deaf and dumb he says we pray for them now but then he says you'll command it amen Church there there is a higher level than where we're living at today I believe amen he says we pray for it we ask for it he says but in that day when you truly recognize who you are when you recognize your adopted position you will not ask you will speak and it will happen amen I'm looking forward to that amen and I don't believe we're far off from it I don't even believe we have to wait past today for that I believe we're in the time of the manifestation of the sons of God but watch what he says here he says didn't say these signs shall follow them that believe they shall pray for the sick he says they shall cast out devils not I will they will if you say to this mountain not if I say he says but if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart he says what we need is adoption Sons and Daughters need adoption we know that Mark 16 Jesus said go you into all the world and preach the gospel in my name you know you cast out Devils if you drink any deadly thing it'll not harm you if you lay hands on the sick they'll recover what was he wanting us to do he was wanting us to go into action he was wanting to put us into his purpose but remember before they went into action they had to go and wait amen they had to obey the word and they had to go and wait because he had to fill them with the love and the life of the Holy Spirit he had to put real character inside of them so that when power came when Authority came they'd use it for the right reason but the purpose was to put them into action the purpose of the Holy Spirit was to put the true church into action in the kingdom of God Amen and that's what God's trying to get us to do and we see here that brother braham's talking about two things he says I'm looking he says God's looking for people that will write the check and people that will write the check for the right reason anden he wants us to write the check he wants us to have faith amen if we write the check it's because we have faith that there's money in the account nobody writes a check if they believe the check's going to bounce because of insufficient funds so the first test of the adopted son of God is will you write the check but the second test is what are you going to write it for amen because if you'll write it is the test of faith but what you write it for is the test of your character amen and so God's looking for a balance of those two things will we use it to develop our own reputation our own Ministry to draw people to us to to bring in a paycheck whatever that might be or will we use it according to the word for the edification and the benefit of others in the body of Christ and those that are around us because Satan's Satan's attempt is going to be to keep us short in faith and character right he's trying to keep us to the point where we get so busy in life that we can't feed ourselves on the word of God that we can't dwell on the things of God to build up our faith and see our position and then he'll test our character what by constantly putting decisions in front of us and putting tests and putting traps and putting things that will pull us away into selfishness or or self-preservation of these different things and barring all that he'll get us to just try and think less of ourselves and think better of others that it's for others and it's not for ourselves and Satan's good at what he does I I know that because the prophet of God said we're living below our privileges I just read a quote that says it's not now about praying but it's about speaking that tells me I'm living below my privileges that tells me we're living below our privileges that there's a higher plane to come into that we've got a place to step unto up to and we've seen even in this age we had a Prophet come and he was a sheath offering he was a first fruit offering he was a wave offering before the people to show us what what things are possible to them that believe I read in devotions the other morning I think it was in Luke where Jesus said to them they were saying you know he was talking to the rich young man and and the Rich Young Ruler walked away sad because he wouldn't give up his wealth to serve Christ and Jesus said you know it's easier for the a camel to go through the eye of a needle to go through the little spot the little hole in a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom and it says the disciples marveled and said well then how are any of us going to get in because back then wealth was a sign of a True Believer they had broken it down so far they had carnal lied the the their spirituality to the point where the wealthiest meant that they were the Most Blessed of God and they said if the Most Blessed of God can't come in then how are we going to get in and he says with men all things are impossible but With God all things are possible and so we have to believe that all things are possible the brother Brandon would saying he said the angel loves that song only believe amen he's trying to get us to have faith and if we have faith then we'll start writing checks against the the balance of the of the bank account of heaven but there's only one way to get that there's only one way to get get Faith and the word says that it's what by hearing the word there is nothing to replace the hearing of word and whether you read it whether you hear it whether it's sung whether it's in your car whether whatever it might be you've got to hear the word and it's got to be a daily bread it's got to be a daily bread because if we don't have that Daily Bread what happens is we start to feed on things other than that and Satan starts to win more battles than he loses in our lives amen amen we've been there we've done that we've been in dry places where we've stepped back from our relationship with God and of a sudden we start losing to things we thought we conquered why because we're not feeding on that Daily Bread amen that Mana that's supposed to come down day by day but I want to go to our opening scripture here this morning this evening and I want to focus on that verse six and it says here that he ha that's past tense it's already done he says made us present tense Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen and this is a powerful scripture if we can understand what he's talking about here as Kings and Priests amen and if I can put my name there and you can put your name there and say I am the one he's talking about to here amen The Book of Revelation is the bride's book amen that is only for the bride in this age they will not understand it until it's too late but our eyes of understanding have been opened what by that seventh angel coming and God himself coming down and opening the seals of this book but brother BR would say this in the church age book just that simple part says that he ha made us he says he ha made us he says though are there are certain truths we need to emphasize I love how the prophet could go in and take the simplest little thing and say we need to emphasize this and he says this is one of them he he ha made us I don't make myself anything you don't make yourself anything our acceptance our position in Christ is not because of us it's because he made us he said salvation's his doing salvation is of the lord it's all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose and he bought us for a purpose and what would he go on to say he would say it's be it's to make us Kings and Priests but before we talk about that I want to jump to the end of that verse and it says that it is all to the glory of who him we are Kings and we are priests for his glory and His glory alone whatever we do in that role is for his glory for his praise to to elevate him Amen to project him to manifest him in front of the people that are around us amen the scripture says whatever we do do all in the name of Jesus Amen as a king in his kingdom as a priest in his kingdom we everything we have to do has to be done in his name amen what by the word with the unction of the Holy Spirit as the seal of approval on our actions I love that story we finished with last service you know talking about that little humble brother me brother meaf I think it was and brother B says he went to Brother chce and brother chce is in the hospital and he's all beat up they don't know how he's alive and the brother comes in and he says I'm not worthy to pray for you but God told me to come pray for you and so I'm doing it Church his unworthiness did not stop him from performing amen if God calls us then let's do it amen let's not look at ourselves let's look at what he says to do and let's let that lead us in in our lives amen but his heart was to go pray for that brother and he did and brother says God healed brother chce immediately at the prayer of a lay member at the prayer of a little nobody who had no idea that he was so special in the Kingdom you know what that never made the newspapers no doubt that testimony didn't fly all over the place he probably didn't go tell anybody but the prophet of God would come behind and say Here's the authority that's granted to the children of God when they'll get under the under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and follow its leading something so simple go pray for that man laid hands on him and he was he he was healed he recovered himself immediately but John says in this scripture he says we are made Kings and Priests and I want to start with priests and we're going to spend the whole service on on this priesthood this this afternoon this evening because I believe that's the most important one because if you have the nature of a priest then you'll step into the role of a king it it'll keep you in the right frame of mind and Peter says this in 1 Peter 2 he says ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light and we see here that Peter is saying the same thing as John and he says it's all to show forth the Praises of God it's to give glory to God this holy this chosen generation this royal priesthood this holy nation this peculiar people it's all for the glory of God Amen we are not bound by tradition we're not bound by law but we're Bound by love amen and it ought to be the most natural thing in our lives to do what the word tells us to do now our flesh is going to fight it every day because our flesh likes its own things it likes its own ways it is it is bound in sin it is it is lost it cannot be redeemed in its current form and we know that the flesh will fight but the desire of our hearts ought to be to do what the word says to worship and praise God in our lives but we want to consider tonight why The Book of Revelation calls us priests what is it about us that allows us to be priests what is it that we do as priests and What Makes Us acceptable to be priest before God but Peter says it all in this scripture he's he's telling us why we are a royal priesthood here he says we are a chosen generation that word chosen means elected and picked out it's done specifically it's not happen stance it's not 1 2 3 4 Priest 1 2 3 4 priests going down the line but it is is a special people that are chosen of God and we see in the scripture that only one group of people could ever be priests there was only one tribe there was only one set of people that could be priests and we see this in Numbers chapter 8 because I want us to show us this by the Old Testament first and then we'll come into the new because the Old Testament is types and shadows of the New Covenant that's coming between Christ and the bride and in numbers 8 it says Mo God's talking to Moses and he says and thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel they themselves were an offering he says that what they may execute the service of the Lord what is it what is their purpose it's to execute it's to perform to labor and serve the Lord as he has laid out in his word and what is it to do it is to properly worship and praise God he says and the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the Bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the Lord to make an atonement for the Levites even the priesthood needs an atonement and you'll see here that the Levites are the first ones to receive an atonement and you'll see that's true in this age because only the bride is truly under the atonement why because she's not just under the blood but she has the life of the blood in her her amen she's anointed by the life of the very sacrifice the perfect sacrifice of Christ of Christ we are high priests we are a royal priesthood to him because his spirit is in US amen we've got the very nature of him we've got the life of the perfect sacrifice in us it's only the bride that skips the tribulation because she's in behind the veil nothing can touch you in there there's no judgment there's blood it's a mercy seat and so what is it under there there's nothing can harm us there's nothing can hold us back from him he says and thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons and offer them for an offering unto the Lord thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel and the Levites shall be mine so this priesthood is God's they belong to him they're chosen they're separated from everyone else he says and after that after they've gone through the tement after they've gone through the cleansing after they've been put into service after they've got the whole Holy Ghost you can't be a priest without the anointing you can't be a priest without the separation you can't be a priest without the cleansing you can't be a priest without that anointing oil poured over you and we'll talk about that a little bit later but that anointing of the holy spirit is confirmation that you're under the atonement in this age the the Holy Spirit confirms that you've been accepted that you're under the blood amen that's what makes us sinless is the holy spirit on us he says after this shall the Levites go in to do the service of the Tabernacle of the Cong congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for an offering for they are holy given unto me from among the children of Israel these are the only ones that served him day and night everyone else had a purpose and a place but these were the only ones that had access to God through the Tabernacle all the time he said instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel have I taken them unto me for all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine both man and beast on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I Sanctified them for myself and I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel see under Israel's law God had the the right to the firstborn he had the right to the first of everything and he did and he remember you had to redeem certain animals you had to pay a sacrifice to keep a certain animal and these different things but God says I don't take I'm not taking your firstborn from you to serve me he says instead I'm going to take a chosen people I'm not going to randomly do this one and randomly do that one but rather I'm going to choose I'm going to elect a tribe of people to serve me so that you don't have to give me any of your sons that was the tithe to God and God chose His tithe there but if we look today we see the same thing we are the elect We Are The Chosen we are the predestinated we are the ordained bride of Christ we are the Church of the Living God and that is by by his election it's by his choice amen I didn't choose to be the son of Lanny klette my dad chose me he produced me and he fathered me and it's the same thing for God I didn't choose him but he chose me and he reveals himself as my father Lanny klet revealed himself as my father and he presented himself to me as my father and no other man can do that now I might try and place a man in there you know my dad went away when I was 10 and brother Mark and brother Bob kind of became my pseudo fathers but they could never be my real father no matter how much I try and put them there they can't be my real daddy why cuz he produced me I come from him and it's the same thing with us we can put all sorts of things over influence in our life put them in in in in places of authority in our life and these different things but until we really meet our father we're not back to where we ought to be amen we recognize our origin and when we do that we step into the family of God no matter what we try and do until we come to him we'll never be truly satisfied but Jesus would say this in the in the Book of John he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that's one thing about a True Believer is the fruit stays amen because the fruit is what a product of the holy spirit in our lives and the fruit of the Holy Spirit it may diminish at times but it never goes away amen it can't because it's life inside of us you can't hold life back but catch this it says what is it what's the benefits of being a child of God he says that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you what a wonderful promise we have tonight that what we ask him in his name he'll give it to us amen and John would say later that if we do it according to his will we have whatever we ask so first thing is we are chosen but the next thing that we are is that we are royal Peter says and that ties into the king's part that we read in Revelation and we'll we'll focus on that later but I want you to understand that the only way to be royal is to be royal in other words you can only be royal if you're coming from the king that's What Makes You Royal is that you're the son of a king you're the daughter of a king you have the DNA of a king you have the King's life you have the king's very person inside of you and that's what makes us Royal is we have the DNA of the great king of kings and Lord of lords in our lives amen now that might cause us to to maybe puff up our chests I'm a son of the king and you're not but you know what I was reading in James and James the apostle was the great equalizer to to those of us that have a tendency to get puffed up I you know I love James he says you know when you fall into traps he says that's not Satan that's you don't blame Satan he says that's you he says you get LED away of your own lust that's why you're in trouble don't blame that on Satan blame that on yourself and clean up your own lives James was a rubber meets the road Apostle and if you ever maybe feel like you're getting a bit lifted up read James a little bit and he'll bring you right back to Earth real quick but I love what he says in this because James had no time for people that that talked a lot but couldn't live a Christian Life remember James would say show me your faith by your Works he was like show me a life lived don't just talk to me about it don't talk about your Revelation live your Revelation and then maybe I'll accept it but James would say this in in in 28 he says if you fulfill the Royal law we a royal priesthood he says if ye fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself ye do well we'll see that as we come into kingship are you in it for you or are you in it for them I was reading in the uh the fourth Church age book this this morning and brother Bram saying he says the only people that history records as great are those that do something for someone else those that are served they're not great it's those that do that are great amen it's so simple here Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself yet will we do it will we give them every Advantage every opportunity every bit of Grace every bit of Mercy every bit of love every bit of consideration as we ourselves give ourselves and will'll give those that we truly love that's the Royal law that's a good checkup is are we Royal this evening but then he would say We Are Holy and we could spend service after service on that but I want to put it in context of a holy nation that we've been chosen to be priest before and Peter would say this he says wherefore gir up the loins of your mind now that that term gird up the loins it used to mean that see they used to wear these long robes and maybe I'll use my jacket and you sisters know all about this our brothers not so much but when you have a long robe if you're going to go into action you can't leave the robe long and so when they gted up their loins what they would do is they would pull up and they would turn up their skirts like this their their robes like this and they turn it to the point where now it was showing their knees but it was out of the way and then they tighten the belt up and so now they were ready to go into battle they were ready to run they were ready for action they were ready to do what need to be done they were ready for work see when it's all down around your feet you're going to trip yourselves up but they'd have to G up their loins he says get ready and so Peter's saying G up the loins of your mind in other words get your head in the game get the right attitude get the right mindset think on the right things prepare yourself for what's coming we know what's coming Church all things have been open to us Peter says get your mind in the game don't be slack in your thinking focus on your purpose he says G up the loins of your mind what does that look like be sober it's not a time to mess around it's not a time for joking it's not a time for playing games it's not a time for thinking we've got lots of time we don't have lots of time he says and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts and your ignorance but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation not all the ways you talk all the ways you live amen I believe we can all come up a little higher when it comes to the way that we live that there's a greater sanctification we could apply in our lives amen but he says why because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy now what a standard that is and we are not holy because of a perfect life or sinless Perfection you know why we're holy church we're holy because we have the holy spirit inside of us that's what makes us holy is that we are perfect through the blood and the Holy Spirit is what makes us holy otherwise it'd just be a spirit but it's the Holy Spirit indwelling us that makes us holy amen and we Are Holy by obedience to the word by the leading of the Spirit by the quickening of the spirit that's what makes us holy amen you want to know if somebody's got the Holy Spirit give them a word test because they may have been living in ignorance but when truth comes across their path and you can show them in the word what it says then the holy spirit will cause them to come into obedience to that every single time yeah sometimes we might kick up a little bit in our flesh because it's a hard decision it's going to cause problems it's going to cause separation those things but it it will ultimately the holy spirit will lead us to the truth amen and it will hold us in that place but brother I would say this we're talking about obedience to the word by the quickening power of the Holy Spirit he says that's what God wants us to be be obedient he says have you received a false Spirit do you yet act with the things of the world as we spoke of this afternoon do you still love them are they in your heart that's one of the greatest dangers our young people will face is that they think that because they're tempted they don't have the Holy Spirit listen this FLH can be tempted if you put it in the under certain conditions it's like I was talking to a brother a while back I said I don't go looking for naked women but you put me in a room full of them guess what eventually this body will respond and it'll want something now that's harsh but let's put it in the in the light of anything you put yourself around entertainment you put yourself around worldly people you put yourself around worldly music you put it there long enough and this flesh is going to get titilated it's going to start liking it and you'll be drawn into it but the thing is I don't go seeking those things why because it's not in my heart why because I've got the holy spirit amen that old man died a long long time ago but what this flesh will rise up if I give it an opportunity and that's why Paul said I Die daily I keep my body under me why because the Holy Spirit In Me says you will listen to me you will listen to me I'm in control not me the Holy Spirit In Me is in control he's the one that's in the great control full tower of my life and so he brings his body under subjection but me what I am is in obedience to the word to not tempt this flesh not tempt the flesh the soul sealed I'm not worried about my soul but this body will get me into trouble if I give it an opportunity so I keep this flesh in obedience to the word and it preserves it and it keeps it from getting scarred and from getting into the things that this world gets into he says have you not been a separated person he says then maybe you haven't been adopted but once adopted you are positionally placed in the body of Christ and you are heir of all things remember what we read earlier if you ask anything in my name what you're the heir of all things then Peter would say so we've been chosen we've been holy then he says we are peculiar and I love this you know what that word peculiar means it means we are the purchased possession that has been preserved if we get into a literation we are the preserved purchased possession what a wonderful thing to think of purchase we are where we are with the blessings with the fellowship with the understanding the knowledge the revelation of Christ why because he purchased us I didn't deserve it I didn't do anything to bring myself to this he paid the price for me so as a peculiar a part of that peculiar people I'm purchased and in Acts 20 it says take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over that which the holy ho ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he had purchased with his own blood amen this is a warning to the ministry a warning to the Pastors in particular that you don't Lord yourselves over the people I like how brother Chris meritz told it to me back when I lived in BC he says when I'm talking to the people he says I talk to them as if I would talk to another man's wife while that man is there you would not put her down you would not insult her you would not attack her you would not try and exert authority over her would you because why she belongs to him and all you're trying to do is help not control not take authority over it amen we're purchased with his own blood but then we're also preserved and Jesus said this he says and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose how many nothing nothing but should raise it up again at the last day what confidence and peace we ought to have tonight not just because I'm here but because those that should be here they're going to be here amen we look today and we see people that have gone so far away and they've lost what they've been taught and they've walked away from the light and the truth of this end time message but fear not if they are a child of God he cannot lose them and he'll bring them back to his position he'll bring them back to his light he'll bring them back and he'll seal them with the holy spirit amen what confidence we ought to have when we see people going where they ought not to to say Lord You've showed me they're your child you showed me they're your child so I'm going to have rest that you're not going to lose any you'll lose nothing that's yours and then Peter would finish with this marvelous thing he says that you should show forth the Praises of him who ha called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light it's only the priesthood that knew how to Worship in a way that would bring God God on the scene they made a way for the people to come into the presence of God God showed them how to do it and their very lives were dedicated to entering into the presence of God and inviting the presence of God so that the other people could enjoy it their whole life was built around bringing the people to God to make them acceptable before him so we see this this Grand picture these attributes of the royal priesthood that that John and Peter spoke of and we see then that we're not just Christians walking around again I was reading in the fourth Church age this morning where brother Ram is saying listen people say they're Christians but they're Christians in the flesh they're not Christians in the soul in the spirit they're Christians in the flesh but it's the Christians in the spirit that can be the royal priesthood that we're talking about that they have access to God that they can go in before him that they're accepted into his presence and he's saying we've got to step up into a spiritual priesthood see the Catholic Church turned it into a natural priesthood and they said I can go and I can forgive your sins and this one can do this and and and what do they call it the atoning of Saints or the um what is it some of the old Catholics helped me the communion of the Saints and that the Saints could could intercede intercession of the Saints in these different things what baloney what baloney but there is a truth of intercession and that's what we're going to talk about for the for the rest of this evening but I want us to look at what this spiritual priesthood looks like brother says this he says now when a man is confirmed Ed say just like that little white button starts in his heart he says that part is God and when he's born again with the spirit of God God's spirit dwells in him now catch this he says now if he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can come back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden Jesus said in Mark 11:24 very verely verely I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said and then he says these words that puts him right back Supreme again it puts him right back in the condition he says if we will let the spirit of God go through our life and push out the bitterness push out the arrogance push out this push out that and let it have the preeminence in our lives it'll bring us back to our spiritual leading condition why because our soul will be back to where it needs to be not this flesh but this soul is back amen it's our spiritual condition first and foremost is that Eternal portion of us where we are what fully consumed we we're overwhelmed we're overtaken by the power of the Holy Ghost in our lives and now we're back to where we were as Adam was in the first what using that Holy Spirit to control the things that are around him we're still in the Fallen body through all this the inner man's restored back but I want you to consider that if that your soul is sealed by the Holy Spirit then that brings you back to your absolute condition of Eden That's Heavy that's powerful stuff that if you are sealed by the Holy Spirit you're an adopted son or daughter of God that brings you back to Supreme control again but we realize that it's in this we don't have Supreme control control over everything cuz the body's not redeemed yet but brother Bram would saying we'll get into this when we get into the kingship side our Dominion is over sin and the effects of sin we're not ruling and reigning now but we are priests and kings in a certain way in a spiritual way right now but I want to go into this because the priesthood was anointed with an anointing oil and it was a special kind of oil and we know that oil always represents the holy spirit in the scriptures and there was lots of oils and if if you look in the scripture they talk about lots of different oils but there was a special oil that was made for the priesthood and it wasn't just a an oil from a particular plant or anything but rather it was a mixture of things and if you go into Exodus 30 it it shows the the special recipe that God had for this anointing oil and it was specific to the priesthood and so in Exodus chapter 30 we're going to read just a moment here but before this before verse 30 he gives the recipe and then he says take this oil and and spread it over everything that's in the temple to sanctify it and make it holy so the purpose of the oil is to sanctify and make holy and fit for service in God Amen but now he's done it to the whole Tabernacle but now watch what he says don't just anoint the Tabernacle but he says anoint the people he says Thou shalt anoint Aaron remember we read Unholy Nation what makes them holy the anointing oil the Holy Spirit on them he says Thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them that they may Minister unto me in the priest's office and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel saying this shall be un holy anointing oil unto me throughout your Generations there it is a holy people what is it it's the anointing oil of the Holy Spirit he says upon men's flesh it shall not be poured neither shall you make any other like it after the composition of it it is Holy and it shall be holy unto you now he's not saying it can't go on any man he's saying it can't go on anyone other than the priesthood except God tells them to God can tell a priest God can tell a prophet to go anoint somebody and when they did it it was with this oil but it could not be unless God told them to do it no man could say I anoint myself I anoint my home I sanctify my home no it was by the choosing of God that you got this oil poured on you he says whosoever compound any like it or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger shall even be cut off from his people he says you're not even allowed to use the recipe you've got the recipe but you're not allowed to use it it's not for you to make it and it's not for you to use it it's for me to choose who gets this oil and he says if you do it you'll be cut off you'll be separated from Israel you're out from under the blood you're out from under the Covenant and you're going to die a long and lonely death if what you try and make this happen yourself so we start to see here this picture that it's only a chosen people that can be a priesthood and they aren't just chosen but they're anointed they're anointed for purpose they're anointed to serve and God says put it on the priest and if you look in the scripture remember it talks about air it says it ran down over his beard and ran all the way to the souls of his feet he was soaked he was saturated it was something that was supposed to overflow them so that they were soaked in this anointing oil that ought to be our lives church that it is saturated with the presence of the holy spirit that there would be nothing that would push him away in our lives that he would have access to every portion of us and that it would would just drench us you know what and then then in Scripture it says that that that the unity of Brothers is like that oil tell you what if you got the Holy Ghost you can get along with people people that don't get along with people I'm sorry something's wrong with their walk because the Holy Spirit Will unify the children and the family of God it will not draw separation we draw separations there is a separation that's required but we tend to make it more about things we like or enjoy or believe rather than what the word really says but God saying it's my choice as to who gets this we look in Revelation in in the rest of the first chapter and I won't read it for the sake of time this evening but we see Christ and he's walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks and remember that he's walking in there and he's got to light it but the oil has to come from him as well and brother bram's speaking about this and he says then when God was made flesh and become the Messiah he says then if we can yield ourselves to be the anointed like he was we become cat's little lights he says that's what the church is supposed to be lights little anointed ones church we have to know who we are we are believers we are Sons and Daughters of God We Are Holy Ghost sealed Messiahs you can't preach this to the denominations they'll only go so far but look at what he says he says that's God's Church his standing light is the light of Messiah the Risen Christ and his people the anointed ones carrying forth his light unto all the church ages sometimes it almost goes completely out but then it comes back again God's anointed one God's Messianic church now he's trying to bring it to our level because that's that's the real struggle for people is to is to put everything up above them but never bring it down to where they're living He says now if Messiah means the anointed one and means king then if the church is Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it becomes a lesser but still a messiah because it has his light reflecting his power reflecting his glory reflecting his Dominion remember we are supposed to be to his praise and to his glory he says that's what the light of the holy spirit in us will do he says so it is Messiah oh how it reflects him in his kingdom in his domain he says the trouble today is we've organized the church to death we've got organization instead of Messiah we've got russellite proelite and other kinds of light but we need Messiah light what the church needs today is the light of the Messiah he says oh how I love him for his goodness why cuz we have that light available he says now that is true God called Messiahs go tell somebody tomorrow I'm a godall messiah he says God called us and we became Kings and Priests unto God Like Jesus was God's high priest we become a lesser priest he says Jesus God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God comes into his church and anoints him some Messiahs he says Oh my he says do you see it the same thing he did is in his church and the same and and he says the same power he had is in his church and his church becomes his dominion and he's King over this dominion and we are Kings and Priests offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name he says amen oh my there you are Messiah little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed off of what he says it's the main one anointed off of the Great One Church how important is it that we have the Holy Spirit it is the most important thing that you can ever get or have or seek in your life it is not just an option it is an absolute requirement for the believer we aren't going anywhere and we're not doing anything without the Holy Spirit In Our Lives seek after the Holy Spirit and make sure you've got it make your calling make your election make your ceiling sure this evening if you haven't done it because without it we are nothing we are Christians in our flesh and our soul is Bound for hell God help us to seek and say Lord do I really have it and does my life reflected do my desires reflect it that's what restores us back to that that that Supreme Eden condition that the prophet was talking about but I want to talk for the rest of this evening about what that role of spiritual priesthood entails and Peter would say this he says ye also as Lively Stones as living stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priest Hood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so this is not a physical thing this is a spiritual priesthood it's not a physical priesthood we're not like the Catholics or the anglicans or these different ones no this is a spiritual priesthood and so we offer spiritual sacrifices and I want to talk about spiritual sacrifices and then we'll talk about acceptable spiritual sacrifices now brother Braham says this he says did you ever know what a priest is what his office is in other words what's the purpose of a priest he says a priest is to make sacrifice what for to make intercession he says and over in Hebrews it said that we the church are the royal priesthood a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people he says see a holy nation peculiar people royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices he says every man and woman that comes to God enters into the veil what he's saying is that every true son and daughter of God that's born again gets to go into the presence of God why because we are priests only priests got to go beyond the veil in those days to go into the presence of God but he says why do we go in there we go in there to make sacrifice and why do we make sacrifice because we are intercessors we are there to plead for those that can we are there to stand between between the people and judgment that's what an intercessor does is they Place themselves between what's deserved and what they want the people to have they're begging for mercy when judgment is all that's warranted that's what an intercessor does when when when they don't deserve it when they don't even realize they need it what does an intercessor do they play they plead they beg they get down on their knees they put themselves in the way to try and hold something back from running that person over and giving them what they truly deserve to try and give them enough time to be restored to grace and mercy that's what the intercessor does and he would talk about in Hebrews talking about Christ as our intercessor he says by so much was Jesus made assurity of a better Testament better than anything they have before he says and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death he says they needed all these priests and you needed more and more and more because they kept dying off he says but this man because he continues forever he never dies had an unchangeable priesthood he says wherefore he is also able also to save them to the utter most that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them now I put the Amplified version there it says therefore he is also able to save forever now how does Christ save he saves completely perfectly and for eternity God doesn't do halfway jobs God doesn't halfway save you God doesn't make you a Halfway Christian he makes you all Christian or none at all and he doesn't start to stop halfway through he'll see you all the way to the end we back off sometimes but he never backs off he'll keep pushing us through he says it's complete perfect for eternity those who come to God through him why since he always lives always lives his purpose of living is to intercede and intervene on their behalf he says for such an high priest became us we don't really use that phrase anymore but in the old days they say oh that dress you're wearing is very becoming sister Justine what did it mean it flatters you it makes you look good it's suited for your build it really works on you what he's saying here is that there is a high priest that works specifically and perfectly for the way we are Christ was the perfect high priest that becomes us that that is suitable for us he says and who is he he is Holy harmless harmless Church we're talking royal priesthood are we harmless undefiled separate from Sinners and made higher than the heavens and we see that Christ even on the cross is interceding he's dying the most agonizing death he's separated from the father he he's completely overwhelmed by the sins of the entire world and yet as he's on that cross in that horrible condition he says father forgive them they don't know what they're doing why because judgment was what they deserved judgment was what God intended but he's sitting there and he's saying I'll pay the price I'm paying it now I'll take whatever it takes if you can give them Mercy that's what the intercessor does is they don't rise up to the occasion but they say I'll take what they deserve on me and I'll absorb it until they can find Mercy and Grace until they can come out of their ignorance until they can come out of their arrogance until they can come out of their religious spirit that's what he did so if Christ was made perfectly for our needs and we're a royal priesthood we the royal priesthood we're a holy priesthood a holy nation then does that not mean we're perfectly made for those that we come in contact with we ought to be if we're made after like he is the order of mzc We Are Made perfectly for those that we come in contact with it says there in the scriptures how long does he do it how long does he intercede he always lives to intercede his life's purpose is to intercede here's only one mediator between God and man and that's Christ Jesus his very purpose until he comes back as king and kings of Lord of lords is to intercede is to mediate between God and the and the and the children we look at Christ on the cross was he interceding to those that loved him for those that treated him well no he was interceding for those that were in ignorance in arrogance in Envy destroying the very one that was their salvation he's not interceding for those that knew him he's interceding for those that didn't for those that had no clue what they were doing their own lives their own actions interfere with their access to God and they could go and they could sacrifice year after year but once he died those sacrifices had no effect anymore they were going to need to recognize them and Jesus says father don't put it on their tab put it on mine I'll pay their bill I'll pay the price what are we going to do when people persecute us when people belittle us when people make fun of us when people give us a hard time because of what we believe well we stand aside and say God they're all yours or will we say God they have no clue what they're doing they're Bound in denomination they're Bound in Bound in worldly arrogance Church some of the worst ones are professing Christians bound up in a religious spirit and they have no clue who's the ones that that persecuted Christ the most the religious leaders the religious people and we run up against them all the time and they'll turn us down and they'll make fun of us and this and that and the other thing and even persecute us to a degree but what is our attitude is it Lord forgive them Lord open their eyes or is it lord they're all yours cuz if we've got the nature of the mediator in us the intercessor we ought to be able to intercede when it doesn't feel so good amen is the spirit of intercession only working on those that love us and appreciate us they don't need that our own filial love will take us past that amen but we need a spirit of intercession that'll take us beyond what we feel brother Brandon would talk about Moses Moses is the the perfect intercessor when it comes to uh a human uh outside of Christ of course and he would talk about when when Moses went up on the mountain to get the Temple or or the the laws of God and and while he's up there they they fashion a golden calf and they go into idolatry and they go into lust and these different things and God comes down and he tells Moses I'm going to kill them all and Moses says whoa no don't do that and he stands in the Gap brother brandham says he stands in the Gap holding back the Judgment of God and he says he puts his own body and his own life between them do they deserve it no they don't deserve it and then they come up again not too long after that and Dayan and cor rise up in their religious arrogance and they say Moses you make too much of yourself you made yourself a big shot you're taking too much Authority you're leading the people in ways you don't deserve and God says to Moses he says separate from them he says not only from them separate them separate yourself from the entire children of Israel he says I'll destroy them all and Moses says no don't do do it don't do it and he puts himself between God and the people again I want you to look at what brother Braham says about this he says he's talking about what daythan and cor did he says and this to displeased God so much till he told Moses separate yourselves from the among them I'll just kill the whole bunch and start a new generation with you he says and Moses fell in the presence of God you've got to be a priest to go into the presence of God he says and he and said he'd have to come over him Moses was basically saying Over My Dead Body Lord you'll have to kill me before you kill them he says now today if God was going to liquidate the people and there was a time when God had gotten tired of fooling with their sin we constantly going wrong who would stand like Moses today for the people he says where would we find a person that would stand or could stand that God would accept like he did did Moses are we someone that God would accept the way that he accepted Moses to stand in the Gap he says could you stand in the presence of God to intercede and then the big bigger question is would you scripture says vengeance is mine I will repay sayeth the Lord sometimes we can get caught up in who we are so much that we're calling out judgment and judgment doesn't come till later Church we're not going to judge the Saints until after this is all over this is not a time of judgment this is a time of mercy and Grace and forbearance amen there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat there's still Blood On The Mercy Seat he says where would we find a person that would stand or could stand that God would accept like he did Moses and Moses own life on Earth meant so much to God till it stayed the wrath of God and God would not cross over Moses he says that always was a puzzle to me till one day in Revelation of the scripture there came this thought to me that you see Moses in Act was every way substituting he was a type of Jesus Christ wow if you're going to be a messiah you got to be the full thing you know we find so often even looking at this that people aren't often LED of themselves but they're led by others to destruction dathan and Kora raised up everybody got to talking no doubt Dayan and K had this little chitchat amongst them themselves and then what they do they started going out amongst the people raising up the people against Moses and those people would have never have said or done anything against Moses if Dayan and cor hadn't shut their traps if they just kept it to themselves God had dealt with daythan and cor but they had to go and sew that seed of discrepancy and riled up the people and you know what 250 men and their entire families paid the price for daythan and cor's arrogance Moses couldn't stop judgment on them God's not playing around but he could keep the rest of them from being pulled into that judgment by interceding but we look today I mean look at what's going on with all this anti-israel stuff how crazy how crazy people have gone nuts and who's leading them into it Hollywood politicians talk show hosts news people influencers and these people wouldn't do a thing and they'd have at least a basic semblance of Sanity but the these people get them inflamed and all they do is show them things that get them worked up and they never show them a balance and those people go and they camp out and they get arrested and they get maced and they get all these all these sorts of things and I imagine they're sitting there in jail wondering how did I get here what it was a spirit of insanity influenced by something that is not of God Church the whole world is under the influence of Satan except the children of God and we run into people and it seems like they're saying but tell you what put them in the right situation ation and you'll say how in the world did I think they were saying it happens all the time we work with people and they're good 99% of the time it seems like they're normal and then one little thing happens and it pops out and you're like oh my goodness there it is why because there's only two Spirits in this world the Holy Spirit and everything else is satanic and without the Holy Spirit we're back to beasts amen we're let around too easily this is the time of extreme events this is the end time extreme events cause extreme results and that's what we're seeing today we're seeing a polarization of people and all it's bringing is to the surface all the spirits that have been working around that's it they've been hidden but see now there's a freedom to be who you are and what happens is demons are now expressing themselves in plain view and it is now accepted as normal that's where we're at and what will we do church will we stand there and just call them demons or will we stand there and say God you've got some children in there remember remember what brother brandham said the angel rebuked him for calling them Ricky and ricettas he said some of them are my children we don't know who's in or who's out I'm reminded of of uh brother Isaiah Brooks talking about this young woman that came in and she had green hair and tats all over and piercings all over her body and she heard the word and she gave her heart immedi immediately to the Lord and she was baptized and filled with the spirit and she gave up her inheritance with her family her parents were multi- multi-millionaires and they said if you accept that then you will be kicked out of this house and they literally kicked her out of the house that night and she had to make a decision will I take the millions or will I take the Holy Ghost and she turned it down pierced green hair tattooed up a daughter of God Rahab was a daughter of God the persecuting Saul was not just a Son of God he was a prophet to the age we don't know who we're talking to we don't know who we're talking to I read a quote where brother BR says you come up on somebody says and they might be all beat up they got their ears beat up and they're in a rough condition look like a boxer something like that he says you don't know who you're gonna meet he says you don't know who's a child of God you don't know who's at an altar so you treat every one of them like a son or daughter of God potentially Amen brother Braham says Moses was the intercessor he stood between the people and God's Wrath he stood between the people and what was really their desserts Just Desserts he put himself between them instead and what was he doing he was banking on his relationship and his access to God to whole black wrath until those people could make themselves right our human reaction is to just step out of the way and say you want to go your way I'll let you go your way that is not the way of the intercessor remember brother Bram says we fight our way to hell so often what happens is we get offended and we say go right on the hell instead of sitting there saying no no no I care more about your soul than what you've just said or done to me and I'm going to fight to get you back into where you need to be you know sometimes even Believers need our intercession look in the scripture look at Abigail when David is coming down with 400 men fully armed and what's he doing he's coming to kill nabal the fool and Abigail is nabal's wife and she hears what her husband's done now listen Church she knows her husband's a fool she's not trying to intercede for her husband you know who she's trying to intercede for David because you see what she says she says my husband's a fool my husband's an idiot this is what's expected of him but David you're better than this and she says if you go down and you kill that man she says it's going to it's going to be a stain on your kingship when you finally get the throne David you're going to regret what you're doing here cuz David thought it was righteous anger you know what it was David was offended David was offended what he asked was reasonable but in the end he had no right to it and he got caught up in him self about what I did and I deserve this and when that man turned him down what happened is a Red Mist went over his eyes and he went with the sword instead of saying what does a king do what does a king do because remember a king serves and we see David serves so Faithfully when he comes into it but what happened was he made it about himself and he got offended and he was going to go wipe out that man and Abigail stopped him and she she interceded long enough for David to come to his senses and he thanked her and he says God s sent you my way you know sometimes people do things to us and it's rough I could tell you things people have said people have done to me it would shock you but you know what we have to do swallow it and say Lord they don't know what they're doing now some of it's easy you know that person had a hasn't had a new birth they may be a professing Christian professing message believer whatever it is but you know they don't have a new birth and sometimes those are easier cuz you know they're still immature they're not truly a born again son or daughter of God but those that do know better that's the harder ones it would be way more difficult for me to forgive brother Mark than a young child doing something to me in this service in this church why because I have a higher standard of expectation for him he's a Son of God he's a holy ghost philed brother but here's the thing is if he does something will I intercede or will Vengeance rise to my mind the royal priesthood are intercessors I want to talk about the nature of the intercessor and the scripture talks about what's going to happen when Israel receives Christ and they talk it talks about it in Zechariah and I want you to see the grace of God here it says and I will pour out I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of supplications what is it it's the Holy Spirit quickening them in one day they'll be saved the scripture says 144,000 in one day they'll come to a realization of Christ as their Messiah and what is the nature of that Spirit Church grace and supplications grace is unmar favor and what are supplications favor upon favor upon favor the holy spirit is a spirit of grace and favor they've rejected Christ they were the ones that crucified Christ they were the ones that persecuted the true church and yet the Holy Spirit coming on them is a spirit of grace and favor so that when they cry out God answers the very spirit of God is interceding on their behalf amen that's the nature of the Holy Spirit why am I saying that because when we get the Holy Spirit it ought to be a spirit of Grace and supplications because why there are people that don't know how to approach God they don't know there's a God to approach they don't know that they're outside of that God's will outside of his word and they don't have a clue of how to go to him they don't even have a clue that they need him so what do they need a spirit of Grace and supplications and who has it I have it you have it that's the one that can hold these things back in their life they can't plead the blood church we sing that song I claim the blood they've got no blood to claim they don't know about the blood they don't know what the blood does they can't can't claim the word they can't claim the spirit they don't have a token they don't have anything all they've got is you so when somebody comes to you and I know what happened to many of us they come to you and they say will you pray for me you know what they're doing they're coming to the one that has the spirit of Grace and supplication they're coming to somebody they can't go in his presence they need somebody that's been in his presence before that they see that you've been someplace that they haven't that you've got something that they don't have that's why they come and they ask you cuz they see that you've got a spirit of Grace and supplications that your life your approach your attitude to them means that they've got a right to come and talk to you why you're standing as a royal priesthood on their behalf now they can't even give the right confession Church they can't give the right test they can't do anything they're clueless but we're a royal priesthood that's been trained to come into His presence that's been called to come into His presence that's been invited into his presence that's been given the right to come into his presence at any time that's why they come to us amen this is an intercession of the Saints like the Catholics talk about but this is a people that can go to God and get answers that's what we're talking about this evening amen Esther was always welcome in the court of the king I'm sure there were others that came in one day and were accepted and the next day they weren't accepted but Esther was always accepted in the presence of the king why she was married to him he was her husband she had access to him 247 that's what we're doing going into his presence pleading for mercy and Grace for those that cannot enter his presence themselves that don't even know they don't even realize what's required listen to this as we start to close it says but the Levites shall pitch round about the Tabernacle of testimony in other words the priesthood is supposed to encircle the entire Tabernacle he says why that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel and the Levites shall keep the charge of the Tabernacle of testimony what were they doing they were pre preserving the people from ignorantly or willingly stepping into judgment remember what happened when Aaron's two sons went in they were priests but they went in the wrong way and God judged them imagine what happens if you're not a priest to step in was death in death you weren't allowed in there God would strike you dead and so they were there and what were they they were a buffer from the wrath of God they were a type of Mercy for the entire encampment of Israel see why it matters what our response and our attitude as like church we're the buffer remember the scripture says woe unto that man by whom offenses come Jesus said offenses are going to come you're going to get offended people are going to do things to you they're not supposed to and he says woe unto he says judgment I don't want to be the guy that offenses come by that's why our attitude matters because if we won't take offense judgment doesn't have to go to that person that's what Christ was doing on the cross wasn't it they're doing the very thing that deserves death they're putting life to death they're putting the word to death they're refusing their Messiah and yet he stands there as a mediator and intercessor and says father forgive them they don't know what they're doing he refused to be offended he refused to be offended what a place we're in tonight we have the opportunity to refuse to be offended for their sake amen remember scripture talks about that that when you talk to somebody you go to them meekly and you do it it says peradventure that God would would bring them out of themselves that God would open their eyes that's what we're looking for that's the response but I want you to catch something and this is something I wouldn't say in public because it would confuse and it would stumble most people but I want you to see what happens when we step into this royal priesthood we're speaking on stepping up but I want you to see how big this gets and brother BR would say this he says the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood I'll explain that in a minute he says that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denomination won't ever touch that he says it's a revelation she knows it and so did Eve know it but she fell but this one knows it and won't fall he says she is ordained Hallelujah wo she is ordained to not fall she won't fall she is she won't fail rather she is predestinate to it he says blessed is the man who God will not impute sin he says the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood remember we covered this before that the purpose of the blood was so that the life of the innocent could come into the guilty to come into the sinner but that's why the blood of bulls and goats never worked because the life of an animal is not the same as the life of a human and so the perfect animal blood can't come into a into an imperfect human but when Christ died what happened is we had a perfect man a perfect human died and so when he died the life of him could come back into us that perfect life could come into us and that's what makes us perfect but remember brother Ram say the life is in the blood so if the life is in you what does that make you the blood of Christ what is the blood for church it's to go and turn the Judgment seat into a mercy seat that's the only purpose of the blood is to change the Judgment seat into a mercy seat that's it it turns the wrath of God into mercy and Grace that's that's what a royal priesthood is church we are literally walking Mercy seats that's what we are when you're walking around our our attitudes our our responses our reactions are determining Mercy or judgment on a daily basis that's what it is that's how serious this is we're talking about stepping up walking Mercy seats if you wanted to put it that way why because we don't just have the blood but we got the life of the blood in us and that's what matters the most that's why our attitude matters that's why our reaction matters that's why we need to stop and consider before we respond to sit back and say Lord what are my options here what would you have me do because we're still under the Grace Covenant and as far as I'm concerned that means we ought to offer Grace as long as they want it if they'll take it we'll give it and if they walk away that's on them if they want to keep walking to Hell let them walk if they want to push through us then let them push but let us stand in the way and say Lord forgive them they don't know what they're doing lead them to you spare them one more time lord then we got people that get into situations like I said we sing that song I claim the blood they get into situations and all they can confess is the situation my family's broken my marriage is broken broen my finances are broken my career is broken my health is broken that's all they can confess but that's not going to get you anywhere with God unless you say so I'm coming to you to fix it but that's why people come to us and they say pray for me my family's broken pray for me my church is broken pray for me I don't know what to do pray for me I don't know where to go why because they're trusting that we've got access to something that they seem to lack they may never have prayed before in their lives or maybe they're praying and they're getting nowhere but they see that you seem to have something they don't why because we're ordained to enter his presence to seek mercy and Grace amen our confession they confess the situation you know what we confess Church the word that's what we confess that's why our confession is accepted as Believers is because we confess the word not the situation so there're so caught up in their broken family their broken Church their broken relationship their broken finances their broken Health but what is the believer saying Thy word is yay and amen by his stripes we are healed he owns a cattle on a thousand hills he'll withhold no good thing from them that love him we can give the right confession that God can accept in their stad check this this is the Amplified of Ephesians 6:18 says pray at all times on every occasion and in every season not just when things are bad when things are rough we build ourselves up in the good times so that we're prepared for the tough times he says pray at all times in the spirit with all manner of prayer and intreaty he says to that end keep alert and watch with strong P purpose and perseverance interceding in behalf of all the saints God's consecrated people the household of faith is the first place that we're always looking if you need me I want to be there for you and if I need you I'm trusting you're going to be there for me cuz what sometimes we can get caught up in situations we can be overwhelmed by situations in life I I I know with our sisters when they have babies it can be overwhelming the things that go on in life and so what do we do we do the meal trains you say that's not intercession that is intercession that we can babysit children to give somebody a night out that hasn't been out in a while that we can we can let them or or give them a gift or send them out on a vacation or these different things that is a form of intercession but what we need more than all of those things is to keep each other before the throne of grace because you know I think about brother Ivan there in the CH in in the hospital he's out of it he can't do anything the only ones that can pray for him are those that are outside I me when when brother Mark is sleeping through his his procedures there's only he can't pray for himself he's sleeping we got to pray for him when somebody gets called to the hospital when something's happening at at work when something's going on in relationships when their business is struggling struggling when their health is struggling what do we do we take them before the throne of grace and we intercede on their behalf remember brother Ram says prayer changes things it's not that prayer changes the will or the mind of God but prayer changes people and sometimes what they need is us to help pray them out of it it sets God In Motion it's a trigger that that pulls God into moving these things amen we can get worn we can get tired we can get weary and that's when we need each other to be interceding you know I rely on my wife to tell me when I'm over tired when I'm worn out when I've been doing too much because it comes up so slowly that I don't realize how far I've gone and it takes some outside of me to see those things and you know what we can see that with each other we can see that with each other we can see the tiredness we can see the dark circles under our eyes we can see the the you know the the e or face that sometimes we have in these different things we can see when somebody's not worshiping we can see when somebody's not responding to the word and what do we do we don't go to them and say what are you doing no we go and intercede because we know what they used to be and we know what they are and we say Lord It's not the Holy Spirit that's making that difference raise them up again restore them back to where they used to be we intercede for each other amen the royal priesthood is here to speak on behalf of those who can't and sometimes for those that won't sometimes it seems like our prayers aren't answered and so we just stop praying and that's when others can kind of Step In sometimes and carry on that burden so that God can restore you back to full Fellowship as we start to close Paul would talk about acceptable sacrifices not just sacrifices and I want to finish with this thought tonight just a scripture and two quotes he says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name he says but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices God is well pleased I put I call this the simplify version I took two different versions of it and put it together he says don't neglect to do what is good and to share for God is pleased with such with such sacrifices so often we get caught up in situations in circumstances in the way things are and we forget that the primary priest purpose of the priesthood is to praise and glorify God and how does he see it how does Paul say we do it he says the fruit of our lips how we talk he's not just talking about singing in church he's not just talking about worshiping he's talking about how we actually talk day by day the things we say the things we do that's the fruit of our lips and he's saying out of that let that be an acceptable sacrifice say the right thing confess the right thing testify of the word that's the sacrifice that God's looking for is a people that will keep the word continually before him listen it's not just the good times good time Christians aren't chrans amen but we're supposed to be able to worship and praise him no matter what's going on and that's that's when we're really behind that Veil brother Bron would talk about the inner Veil you know the the secret life and these different things and it's when we can step back in there and nothing phases us I'm always amazed at Jesus sleeping in the storm and I don't know if it was because he was so at rest or because he was so tired but regardless to sleep in the storm to sleep when you're going through a medical procedure that's what I'm talking about amen that's what I want have in my life is that no matter what's going on the fruit of my lips would be to give him praise and glory every single day amen let's stand if we would as I ring these last two quotes he says what does a priest do he makes a sacrifice and what's a spiritual sacrifice that's what these Sons and Daughters do which are Kings and Priests he says yet not in full possession even in adoption we're not in full possession why because we're still Bound in these sinful bodies he says but even though we we don't have it all in other words even though we don't maybe have the full Victory we don't have the full answer we don't have the full healing we don't have the full restitution we don't have full sight of what's going to happen of what we're praying about he says even though we don't have it all he says they're making sacrifices offering to God spiritual sacrifices the fruits of our lips giving praise to him he says you say brother bam I just don't feel like praising him rubber meets the road to see evening church it's a Wednesday night I just don't feel like praising him I'd rather be home in bed I wish brother John would let us go I just don't feel like praising him he says that's the time to make the sacrifice sacrifices are not about feeling good what's a sacrifice if it feels good it's like you and I were talking about me moving here and you were saying it's a sacrifice can't be a sacrifice if it feels good if you're content in it if it brings you joy and happiness that's not a sacrifice amen but a sacrifice is when you don't want to when it doesn't feel good when you don't have energy that's when you want to give the sacrifice that's when it is a sacrifice that's when it is a sacrifice is when there's nothing there that would warrant it yet you do it anyways why because he's God and he's worthy of Our Praise amen he says that's that's the time to make the sacrifice Praise Him anyhow we are Kings and Priests Sons and Daughters offering spiritual sacrifice the fruit of our lips giving praise unto his name he says while we're groaning veiled in this Tabernacle of humiliation has your body humiliated you recently I'm getting older things hurt things ache but even beyond that silliness sometimes I let myself down and it's a body of humiliation Paul called it this body of death right he says veiled in this Tabernacle of humiliation we have the earnest we have the down payment of our perfect complete Redemption back like we were in the beginning when God created Adam in the Garden of Eden he says we have a foretaste of Glory Divine by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the refreshment coming from the presence of God to water the church and to make it grow in Grace it's a spirit of Grace and supplications he gives it to us so we can have it and then he says now as you freely receive freely give to others he says and when we're sick with red we have Redemption the blessing the attributes of the death of Christ Divine Healing as a force sign to us that someday this Mortal will take on immortality he says yes sir amen oh my marvelous he says he's here to do it glory amen God help us to to be intercessory priests amen for those that are in this local body for those that are in the global body we think of brother Ron Spencer over there four years plus going and we pray for that man pray for him every day pretty much we're interceding on his behalf but then we walk around and we're to intercede with those that come our way to offer Mercy to offer Grace to offer a light to offer love when it's not deserved to offer a soft answer when we have every right to give otherwise in all of these things to intercede what per chance that God could reveal himself to them and they could find themselves into his presence amen when those priests went in when they walked in they weren't sitting there saying brother John does not deserve the atonement brother Joe does not deserve the blood brother Bob B he offended me last service brother Dale didn't shake my hand no when they went in it was with humility under the grace and the atonement that they have received to say now I'm going in for them too they never thought about the people all they thought about is what the outcome was going to be that's what matter most the outcome not the path not the road not the mess not not the emotions not the circumstances the outcome that's what the intercessor is focused on can we have an eternal outcome for their good that's what we're called amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord where where the rubber meets the road Lord we're coming to a place of a greater dying out Lord where we can humble ourselves humble our emotions humble our Lord this reputation that we so often claim we have Lord we're tearing down facades tonight Lord and we're saying Lord help us to intercede Lord help us to put their Eternal destination above our own Lord let us put everything we have let us live continually Lord even as you do for us Lord to intercede on behalf of those that can't or won't Lord I pray that you would find our intercession effective Lord that it would be with sincerity Lord that we'd have a real burden for those that are around us that have great needs Lord we pray for
