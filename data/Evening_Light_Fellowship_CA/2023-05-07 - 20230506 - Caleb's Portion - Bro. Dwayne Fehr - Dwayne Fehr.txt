perhaps you came the first night and you didn't get what you needed maybe not tonight's your night tonight's not your night then tomorrow morning's your night amen because he said if you ask I'll give it if you knock I'll open if you seek you'll find and that's all it is and sometimes he's just waiting on you to knock a little more pray a little harder to trust a little more pull a little harder Amen Let patience have its perfect work in your life amen so let's let's just pull together tonight and we're going to sing that song fill my cup Lord I Lift It Up Lord and you lift your hand if you've got a need you lift your hand and you worship and you praise and you say Lord I have a need maybe you've got a need and you don't even know what it is as in you've got something inside of you and something's unsettled and you're uncertain or you're worried or you've got something going on and you say Lord I don't even know what's causing it but I need peace I need rest I need an answer I need direction I need resolution whatever it might be tonight say Lord I'm here and I'm expecting and I'm opening I'm putting my hands up brother where I'm said defy gravity let him know whose side you're on and say Lord I'm here and I've worshiped you and I praise you but now I've got a need and your word is supposed to be the the thing that feeds me and that meets my need and I'm here to hear your word tonight and I'm expecting to be fed and Lord so I'm trusting you I'm confessing I'm lifting my hand and saying Pass Me Not O Gentle Savior walk by my Pew come sit down next to me answer my needs yes yes Lord don't just let it be the person next to me but come talk to me a little while get personal with me Lord get that man to go down a road that he has no reason why no understanding of why he's going there or just to come pass by me remember when Jesus was headed to to heal jairus's daughter on the way to jairus's daughter that woman with the blood issue touched him he was going one way and he stopped she stopped him with one touch because she had a need while he was going to touch somebody else you can do that with your faith tonight she said if Iva can touch him the Hem of His Garment I know I'll be healed and that's all it took was just one touch from him it's all you need tonight is a touch church amen while he's walking the pews as he's he's working this this audience this evening amen let him not pass you by without you touching him Amen brother Brown would talk about the unrecognized presence of Christ he's here he's here and we've sung about him we worshiped him praised we gathered in His Name by his word he's here and so we can trust that he'll meet our needs this evening amen sing that as we welcome brother Dwayne to the pulpit Lord I lifted up Lord [Music] come and queen [Music] of my soul [Applause] [Music] I want yes [Music] how many ways [Music] no no baby take me home why don't we just lift it up to it one more time [Music] make that your prayer

one no matter what you attain to in this world without Jesus Christ your life your life is incomplete Lord whatever I'm missing tonight by your grace I want you to place it right there I want you to place it right there make me what I will make me what you want me what you would have me to be what you would have me to be I'm I'm just going to say God bless you and let you take your seats but uh I'm not going to let you guys go right aways trust that's okay and and just want to take the opportunity and thank brother Jonathan again for the opportunity to come and minister to you your blessing it's been to get to meet you and uh Shake I want to say shake your hands on this side of Glory I I'm I'm a lover of music and um you know we can't be something that we're not and you know I got I got a brother that come to fellowship with us back home and he says to me brother Dwayne he said um he said were you ever out in the world I said no sir not that way you know God's grace to me kept me and I was I was sharing with brother Gerald today I said you know many have wonderful great testimonies I said but listen young people it's a tremendous testimony to be able to tell the world God kept me in lady osia God kept me and anyhow the you know the brother he kind of would look at me funny and he said what kind of music did you listen to when you were growing up and I have to be honest you know brother Brown makes a statement unless you get the Holy Ghost rock and roll music will get you it's got such a power music has such a power to it of course Satan was you know he was the Archangel he was the exalted cherubim and brother Brown would say this that he actually he was the leader of worship so he understands the power of music and that's why Everywhere You Go I mean he bombards you with it because it has an anointing it has a it has a power it has a way of getting into your innermost being and of course you know we grew up on the believer's music and and uh when we're at breakfast this morning brother Dale put me on the spot and he said brother Dwayne would you and sister Connie at least sing once while you're here and and I I'm honestly not much of a singer but she's a good piano player and so how but but I'm so simple guys that you guys will pick it up like that you know I'm just country style four or four times you know I got a son-in-law from Arizona and he just shakes his head at me he's like oh sure Dad four four times there it is again you know he is talented I'm not so I'm gonna ask my wife if she would come at this time and and we'll maybe bless you if we can I don't know brother you want me to use this or do you want me to use the handheld What would grab a handheld all right test test okay of course the kind of songs I would uh sing you probably all know already anyhow and and so you can just feel free to enter in [Music] if it's a foreign and I'm walking in your will Lord they in that sway I long to be in the desert without a dream on some old ship about the same Lord I'll go away we'll just be to me [Music] speak the word Lord my ears long to hear you speak the word Lord my heart aches to know [Music] speak the word Lord I'll be what you'd have me to be foreign speak the word Lord your servant will go [Music] here being times that I complain as life ruled against the ground I recall how you took me to my name here's one thing I couldn't do I still love my life to you or it was you Lord paid my price had Calvary [Music] my years long to hear you at your desire tonight speak the word Lord my heart aches to know speak the word Lord I'll be what you'd have been speak the word Lord your servant will go speak the word Lord your rings thank you speak the word Lord my heart is [Music] just speak the word Lord we'll go [Music] I think that's what we're all waiting for tonight isn't it I tell you what there's something about and you ministers know what I'm talking about but there's something about asking the Lord to speak and we realize real quickly that it it's not us it's not us you know how many times yeah I have an interpreter back home not that he interprets at home but he is in my interpreter while I'm in Mexico and and you know he he tells me says brother Dwayne he said you know I said can you email me your notes you know there's a big there's a translation difference and we've found it just a little simpler so if I can just get an understanding of where you're at then at least uh you know I can be with you and I'm like and he's a tremendous good interpreter he's just really A Gifted Man and and uh so I would email them off my notes you know all this digital stuff and and he'd go through them and you know we get to preaching at the end of the service he just look at me and go why why do you do that I'm like do what he said well yeah we read the scripture but then you didn't preach anything in your notes I'm like I'm sorry that's just how it works you know but isn't that isn't that how we want we want the Lord to we we just I you know I I just feel this way it's like Lord I want you to come by my way I pray this all the time at home I'm like Lord out I want you to go down to where they're at I don't know what they're going through but you do you do and and so if he if he detours us if we take a a detour and Direction then I feel like brother brother Jonathan just said you know what if you just call him by your seat tonight you just call him Lord this is I this is where I'm at I need you to come here tonight you know there's a little song when we couldn't go to him he came to us he talked about Amazing Grace and I'm just so grateful tonight and and so if you got your Bibles with you you wouldn't mind standing one more time thank you again for making me so welcome I uh I said usually I I get all nervous and uptight and you know my stomach is in knots and I I don't know the atmosphere brother Bob the atmosphere was just set so good last night it yeah you get the cower behind here but just for a little bit and then I was free and uh you know I I'm not a I have nothing against these preachers that have you know glass pulpits it's all fine for them but but I I really truly is in my nature I'd rather just hide behind it you know like Gideon did I'd like to hide behind it but when he comes by I feel so free I feel so liberated and then I feel like I'm too far from the congregation then I need to be I need to be right where they are at and and so you forgive me for my my silly little ways or whatever but you know if God could use a a dumb animal to speak I I trust if I can just let go he could use me too so let's bow our heads just for a word of prayer Heavenly Father it's so good to know you're here tonight Lord how precious it is just to be able to feel your presence Lord I know father that you have something special in store for your children tonight and just help me Lord to give myself out of the way father we believe your word is life to us and oh God no matter if they're here or if they're online you know how father to go to their where they're at Lord to meet their needs according to your great riches in glory and tonight Heavenly Father we ask that as we as we enter into this portion of the service that you would be glorified here tonight Lord that every need would be met Lord that your children to go away happy and free father we truly love you tonight and so thankful for the blood that's been shed for the word that's come forth in this hour Lord God that would redeem us Lord call us not just out but call us in come up hither Lord to where Revelations begin to pour out where the mercies of God are new to us every day Lord where we can walk in peace and joy Lord we're so happy as your children tonight father we ask that you would break the bread of life to us again Lord take our lips now Lord as I Just Surrender myself take my lips Lord to use them for your glory in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Philippians chapter four if you got your Bibles one one verse very familiar to you all Philippians chapter 4 when we read verse 13 to start with and I think I'd like to just read this together um you know I think there's something about not just reading the word of God but you know sometimes we sometimes we just um you know we just pick up our Bibles we in our we've got eyes to read and we you know we just consume it but we don't read it out loud but listen there's power in the spoken word as long as God had his thoughts and they were in his mind nothing happened but the Bible says when he spoke and said let there be light something happened and so when we brother would say this when you put the word of God on your lips it's not you speaking but it becomes him so Philippians chapter 4 verse 13. let's read it together I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me can we do it again I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me and I I just want you to take that as your portion tonight I can do all things all things are possible all things belong to me because I have a father that left me in inheritance and in that inheritance every part of it is mine every part is mine God bless you can have your seats you'd open up your Bibles again to the Book of Joshua tonight I want to take a little thought and I want to I want to call it Caleb's portion Caleb's portion and uh you know we look at the scriptures and and this is our life I mean I I mean we yes many of you know many people we have to work and we have to make a living and we got families and we got friends but this is life this is life and uh and so if we just turn over the Book of Joshua with me and I'd like to just lay a little background as I get started tonight starting in verse one it says and these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan which Eliezer the priest and Joshua the son of none and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel distributed for inheritance to them by law was their inheritance as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribe for Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half tribe on the other side of Jordan but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them for the children of Joseph were two tribes Manasseh and Ephraim therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the Land save cities to dwell in with their suburbs for the cat for their Catalan for their substance as the Lord commanded Moses so the children of Israel did and they divided the land verse 6. and the children of Judah came unto Joshua in gilgal and Caleb the son of Jefe the canizite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh bernia 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh burnia to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart and I just I so appreciate that I you know listen to the way this man of God is speaking I want us to remember something Joshua we're and We Know by Prophet that Joshua was actually a type of the Holy Spirit listen Joshua was the type of the Holy Spirit Ministry but Caleb was actually a type of the Bride so now watch how watch how this is being watch how Caleb is beginning to speak here he's reminding he's going to Joshua who is uh you know who is in command and tell me you know again we say this little congregation right who is actually in charge of this congregation well brother Jonathan is you know he's the pastor here but who's really the pastor who's really the pastor yes God needs flesh and blood but listen this is not the work of man that we're that we're enjoying right now it's not it's not though it's not the work of a church organization it's not the work of uh you know a certain group or a certain denomination but this is unadulteratedly the work of almighty God for for I believe it was Zechariah said not by might and not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord and so so we look at this and here's you know you know if we would just jump back into into Caleb's day here we we look at Caleb and and he's been given something as he was in his journey as he was in his journey and we all know the story how how the 12 surprise went over into the other land they began to spy out the promised land and when they when they came back into uh you know before Moses they began to give a a report about what they had seen and how this land was oh it was such a wonderful land it was going to be an absolutely a beautiful place to live and everything that you had need of everything your heart desired it was it was already there it was already there listen Brothers let me just drop this into a natural into a natural level right now but but here you're sitting here and this building has already been here you you never had the labor to build the building you never labored to buy the property you never you never labored to to make this what it is it was already here you have walked in and just inherited you you kicked out all the trash that was in here you know all the idols and all the monuments you got rid of that and you begin you begin to you know clean up the walls as it were but but it was already here for you to enjoy for your blessing so yeah I mean you didn't have to you didn't have to spend two million dollars to build a building and then and then be strapped with payments for the rest of Eternity before God comes it was already here and God added it you see how good God is I'm just using a natural a very natural uh perspective of this but they went into the promised land and everything they needed everything for their life every detail of their life was going to be taken care of and God had promised them I'll be with you it's your land and 12 go in and when they come back out what's the report one by one they begin to say hey tremendous land it's amazing look at the size of the vines look at the grapes they're carrying look at look at what it's been but we got a problem the inhabitants of that land make us look like ants they're huge these are giants these are giants how are we ever gonna how are we ever gonna take that land against them and God was angry with them that's that's Paramount to calling the blood of Jesus Christ tonight insufficient because God had given them a promise he had said I will go before you I will go I will the one I'm the one that's going to go before you this is your land I'm giving you this land and they literally took the promise of God and said ah the I can see it the land is good I know it's good man we got the fruits of it come on Brothers we literally had a prophet messenger uh another Joshua Ministry go over to the land and come back with fruits of Vine we saw the dead raised you saw you saw the lame walk you saw Hearts being discerned listen we have we have had the the fullness of the word given back to us in its entirety and what's your report tonight what's your report tonight because because 10 of them came back with the report that hey we believe what we hear on tape we believe God sent a prophet we believe that there's a land that's promised and we we want to go take the land but but we just can't it's it's just too great though the obstacles are too great I don't think I got enough faith for that and God was angry with their report and then you hear what Joshua the Joshua's report 40 years old was I when I went to when I was uh when I went was I when Moses the servant Lord sent me from kadish barnia to spy out the land and I brought him word again as it was in my lips oh because somebody told me so no listen Joshua Caleb had a revelation as it was in my heart listen the word has got to drop from here down to here I I remember hearing a brother preach a little message something about being 18 inches short one time he said that's about how far it is from your head to your heart just about 18 inches but that Journey going from here down to here can take a long time sometimes but when Caleb came back he come back with a testimony hey that land is that land is exactly what God is from that land is more than we deserve that that land is phenomenal when do we get to go when can we get it and meanwhile all the rest of them are saying hey Hey listen listen we're in the same land you you how we agree that that God the power of God is there we we agree that God God is more than able to take care of us but we've got a problem it's the Giants I'm afraid of the Giants I don't think I can quit I don't think I've got what it takes I don't think I don't think I'm a man enough to to fight with the Giants I don't think we're capable isn't that a shame the same God that had led them for 40 years in the wilderness the same God that had brought them out of the land of Egypt and they'd watched the pillar of Fire come on Church they had watched a pillar of Fire by day and they seen by night and A Cloud by day and if we haven't seen the very same thing and they followed a Moses over a Moses Ministry uh through the land and here's God showing himself on a daily basis not just feeding them you know not just giving them uh uh you know the the the the the the stuff they ate in Egypt but literally God would rain down Manna out of heaven and then they begin to complain and God would literally give them Quail you would give them their harsh desire here we are church here we are God has literally take from the time that you gave your heart to the Lord Jesus God has literally taken care of you your whole life your whole life but he ain't wanting us to stay here I don't care how long you've lived here he might like you right here as far as your natural body is concerned but your spiritual man the innermost being God has got something more for you listen where God is never done this great Book of Revelation this this great this great God who keeps unfolding himself he is never done and he wants to unveil himself and express himself he wants to become so real to you that when you speak something happens When you pray something happens when you know that you know listen Caleb wasn't standing there quaking and shivering he was like I know that I know that I know that I know that I know it had become real to him that's what we need Church Revelation is the children of gods I've been preaching on this thought at home Revelation is the children of God's inheritance because when it becomes real nothing can take that from you nothing as long as it's not Revelation as long as it's only head knowledge or hopes those people can comment and circumstances can happen and it takes it away from you but when it drops into your from your head to your heart no devil in hell just like we preached last night nothing can take that from you Hallelujah Moses okay uh verse 7 40 years old was I when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from canish Barney to Aspire to land and I brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people to melt my God made the heart of the people what kind of ministry was there that wasn't willing to take the whole word it wasn't willing to take God out his word you know it's one thing to it's it's one thing to say this you know I believe God sent a prophet and I know that God worked in that man and he did and we believe that and we follow that man like like they followed Paul but we're not following the man we're following the god that's in the man why because that God Was the Same God that walked the shores of Galilee and he did the same things then in his Earthly Ministry to the Jewish people now he's doing the same to the gentile people and here we are recognizing hey it's God manifested again of course we're going to follow him of course we're going to follow him but listen it's one thing to say yeah I believe that God was in that man it's another thing to say you know what I'm brother Gerald can a pastor here for 40 plus years I know he's a man of God I know that God speaks to him I I just know that I know I could go to him and he'll pray and God's Gonna but what about you what about you as long as it's just somebody else I mean we all got a place a part to play in this but as long as it's just somebody else we're missing something because when it hits our doorstep all of a sudden fear comes in and all of a sudden we're not sure anymore and that's exactly what God wants to do away with take the fear out of the people Hallelujah so amazing here's 40 years 40 Years of wandering in the wilderness and Caleb is standing there him and Joshua standing there and 40 Years of listening to people Grumble and complain and Grumble and complain nothing's ever good enough nobody they're never satisfied they're never happy they're never content reminds me of some Believers nowadays everything is just always wrong it's just never right and it just hey come on Church come on God didn't put us here to Grumble and complain if we want to see change you've heard this little statement if you want to see change then be the change that you want to see in other words we want to put it off on the pastor whether you know if brother Jonathan would just if he'd just do it this way or if he could just if he'd just preach this way no no if you just get down on your knees and start to pray I'll tell you what the gift of God has nothing to do with the man the gift of God when you get to pulling on the gift of God regardless of who's standing there if you pull he'll move he'll move he'll start to say things and preach in ways that he never even knew was possible and I know that from my own experiences when going the people of God go to pulling you you you do things that you never thought you would ever do you don't even understand why you're doing why because he's God because you operate the gift you operate the gift here's this whole generation of complainers and complainers and and in it all Joshua and Canaveral still standing there saying uh-uh ah my God my God is still the same yesterday today and forever my God is still more than able my God still does these things my God still heals the sick I was telling brother uh brother Jonathan in the office I was you know I was over in in Guatemala a few years ago and here's this here here's this little little sister comes up to me and we're just gonna have dinner and Through The Interpreter he says would you pray for my daughter and I just looked there and said well sis what's what's the matter is your daughter said she's she's never spoken a word in her life she's about 12 years old right now and I just looked at her said honey why don't you just wait till we're until we're done at the end of service why don't you just wait and and we'll pray for her then listen I'll tell you this Brothers by the grace of God he is still Hebrews 13 and 8. he is still Hebrews the presence of God had come down into that building that little mother brought her little daughter she was under such an expectation she brought her little daughter we turn we prayed for that night and turned around and went home we got a phone call and that little girl that had not spoken from the day she was born that girl woke up the next morning singing the Praises of Jesus Christ why because he's still Hebrews 13 8 he is still Jesus Christ the same and I'll tell you what when we go to putting him back somewhere else we're missing out we're the ones losing out as long as they wanted to leave him on their journey in the desert yeah he was God and he fed us with the bread and he fed us with the coal the quail and we got the water from the Rock and they still murmured and complained and he healed our diseases but when it comes to going over come on church he doesn't call you out unless he's ready to call you in the only person that can keep you from going in is you that's the only person God's already the door is already open absolutely the door is already open there was a door open in heaven Revelation chapter four and a voice said come up hither come on what's he doing he's calling us out to call us into Heavenly places in Christ and here's here's Caleb and Joshua standing there and they're looking at this promise that that God has made and I I want you to consider this this is Caleb's portion Caleb and literally when he spoke to to to Moses he said when we get over there I want my portion he'd already went and scoped out the land and when he came back to Moses he said when we get there I would like this I would like Mount Horeb and Moses had given it to him listen the Holy Spirit has this the word of God has given you everything it's not law no more it's Grace it's been given to you amazing grace Amazing Grace verse 9. Moses swear on that day saying surely the land where on thy feet of trod and shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou Hast holy followed the Lord my God I'll tell you what Daddy it behooves mommy it behooves us to follow the Lord with all of our hearts there's a there's an inheritance not just for you but for your children too 40 years can you imagine 40 years and finally they cross over and now here's not just not just 40 Years of of of of of of Journey in the desert but here they cross over and now Caleb's come back to Joshua and he begins to remind him of the promise listen father loves to be reminded of his words you know that father loves brother around said he loves when you just take him at his word and you remind him but Lord you said I saw some of you got young kids here and I I had young kids once too and I I got a boy that my number two son his name is Ben and you know he's big strapping man now and but when he was young we were just reminded him the other day he was so persistent till it would frustrate me to no end how he'd come home and I'd be weary and tired and I would I'd jump in the bathtub and he'd sit down on the outside of the door and he'd tap on the door and say Dad Dad and he'd have something on his mind and he and I'd be like what Ben and he'd talk about something I'm like Ben no that's not going to work he wouldn't move dad what Ben well Dad what if we do it this way and then he'd start off on another angle I I I I'll tell you what he would go from here to here to here and he just keep not I'd be just like oh man go to bed I want to sleep and but Dad but Dad I'll tell you what we need to take that approach with our heavenly father but Dad you said so Dad I don't I know but Dad you promised listen we got a book full of promises we got a whole we everything you have need of your life but Lord you promised but Lord you said so and you know what Papa never gets tired of hearing his children say Lord you said so but Lord you promised you were going to do this he doesn't get tired of that I might have got tired of it but father never gets tired of that he loves to hear his children just just remind them and finally he can say yeah I know it's going to be hard I know Daddy but but you got come on Brothers you know what I'm talking about some of you guys got young boys daddy flex your muscles show me your muscles you know you're just you got nothing I had nothing you know you're like all right they make you feel like you're just you know Hulk Hogan or something like that you guys probably don't know who that was but way back in the day you know just big big guy and but that's what God loves that's what God loves he loves for you to brag on him and just tell him how great he is how powerful he is Lord nothing has ever stood in your way and this little thing that's bothering this is nothing to you Lord I'm just counting on you to fix this is God he's God and Caleb Caleb was that kind of man and you know he wasn't about just to let it go he he done crossed over and and here he is 40 Years of fighting and at four not 40 Years of fighting for his brothers let me just use your pastor right now 42 years of fighting for who for you 42 years day in week out day uh uh week in and week out and week in and week out what's he doing on his knees fighting what fighting battles for you to get you settled in the Holy Ghost Land to get your spirit all settled down and to make you willing to take the word of God claim it for your very own you're not you're going to take the sword of the Lord if you have to you're going to stand there you know toe-to-toe with the Enemy and you're you're just gonna hack away until the enemy Falls why because it's not by might and it's not by your power but it's by my spirit saith the Lord here's you know there's your pastor all these years 42 years and now here's Caleb standing there here's Caleb saying that said Lord you need Joshua you know I'm here to remind you of a promise that Moses gave me 40 years ago when we entered into this land Moses told me that that was my mountain that was my mountain and I we're just going to read it because I think it doesn't get said much better than the scripture can say it watch his watches verse 10 he says and behold the Lord hath kept me alive and he said these 40 and five years ever since the Lord spake this word unto Moses while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness now lo I am this day for score and five years old I'll tell you what that does good for some of us old folks for 80 and 5 years old 85 and yet I am as strong this day as I was in that day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war come on Church listen Caleb is already in the Promised Land don't you ever get to think something you know so I hear I hear a lot of preaching sometimes about about you know we're just kind of where we were in the capsule we just relax now and God's got it all you know we're just waiting for the Rapture and I'll tell you what brother Brown said you will fight every day of your yes I believe we're away I believe in absolutely in the rest of God I but I believe in the Shalom I believe that since this message has come it's called Shalom rest little bride rest why because your judge has become your jury you have already been proclaimed innocent you have nothing against you but you are in the greatest battle that has ever been fought brother round says that Holy Ghost Land was like and unto Canaan land he said it was not a millennium he said it was a it was a land that they fought for it was a land where they have struggles and troubles it was a land where they fought for their promise when you're done fighting we're going to be in the Millennium but until then you've got to promised land and it's in a spiritual world and you're gunning for it I tell you what I mean you look at the sons of anaca you keep your eyes focused on them and commit yourself to taking them down we all got to Goliath in our life we all go to Goliath in our life we need to take the same attitude that David took which was a third full attitude he looked at the man and he said this day this day I'll take your head off what is that speaking the word while everybody else stood there and trembled at all of his you know all of his great uh um all of his great threats and you know he had his his name and all his ribbons up there and I'm sure the newspaper it they'd spread every fight around the world I think that's probably what a lot of Saul's problem was they spent too much time listening to the news reading about all of his Great accomplishments and and how great this man was and how many great men he had defeated and David spent his time with the greatest of all Warriors back in the backside of the desert somewhere it's come on church you can spend the same time with him in your car going to work you can spend the same time with him on your knees beside your bed you can spend the same time in your easy chair as David spent out there in a nice little uh nice little Meadow somewhere as well he was feeding father's sheep he knew the power of God and he heard the same thing that that whole Army heard including Saul who was the pastor he heard the same thing and he said you're kidding me you're going to let that thing defy the army of the Living God what was he hearing that they weren't hearing I'll tell you he was hearing a different sound he was hearing a different sound he was looking at a God that that he so loved and so cherished and knew that he was the god of Cree David knew he was the son of God he looked at his giant and he said no way if nobody else will fight him I'll go fight him now that's what God wants he wants you to be a David tonight he he wants you to to unsheet your little sling maybe you maybe you don't got the sword in your hand but but you got a little slingshot called faith f-a-i-t-h and you know David didn't just stand on this bank and say hey I think that's close enough buddy I'll just throw it from here oh no you go read the story David looked at that man and he made his Proclamation this day this is the last day you're going to make your threat this day this day I'm gonna take your head off this day you're gonna die you know what the devil laughed in his face huh who are you you're nothing your little housewife how you're just uh you're still in grade school what are you just a truck driver just a farmer you're a nobody oh that's what you think are you listening Satan that's what you think but let me pull out my pedigree because if you can read long enough you're going to find out right here this one comes from eternity this one says Son of God lineage of God almighty and I hear a prophet say that if you are the bottom of the feet of the body of Christ you're still on top of Satan you're still greater than what he is you know we we we we look at ourselves are we bragging on ourselves no we're bragging on him he made us this way he made us thus yeah but brother Dwayne you don't understand me you don't know you don't know all my weaknesses you don't know all my shortcomings and all my fears and you don't know mine and neither does he he just made a statement when you're weak I'm strong in your weakness I'm going to show you my strength amen hallelujah Caleb was that kind of man Caleb had a different Spirit brother Adam said I want to liken myself unto him tonight Caleb had a different kind of spirit I want you to notice this confession of his in verse 11. yet this yet I am as strong this day I don't care how long you've been walking this way I don't care how how many miles that your feet have trod and and how long that you've professed the name of Jesus Christ how weary you've gotten from Battle after battle after battle left God knows we go we got it it's one battle after another God knows it but you can make the same Proclamation I am as strong this day I am as strong this day as I was 40 years ago and your own neighbor your own family might say no you're not I'll tell you something saying you're looking at the body that's failing but the man on the inside he can still take down mountains he can still take down mountains he can still slay Giants hallelujah what an hour to live in sitting he says in as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in notice his confession verse 12. now therefore now you make this your confession tonight now therefore what's that what's Caleb asking for his portion what's Caleb asking for his portion what did you come for tonight it's because it was church because it was church you came with the wrong attitude well because there was a special speaker here came with the wrong attitude Caleb had a purpose Caleb said now therefore give me this mountain give me this mountain Joshua you heard the promise you were there you witnessed this promise that Moses gave Now give me this mountain Kenneth will you talk about man rather we fought for years the good fight of faith that mountain has got the biggest giants out of this whole land that man that's the most infested mountain in the whole land and you buddy you're 85 years old what do you mean can't take something else anything notice how the devil wants to do to you tonight wants to give you a substitute just take something else now you know you don't really need it you'll be okay without it there's other things that are good come on Caleb push those shoulders back suck your chest up put your sword in the ground or your spear in the ground and look that devil in the eye and say that's my mountain and I'm going to take it that's my mountain and I'm going to take it says therefore give me this mountain that the Lord spake in that day for thou hers in that day how the anakms were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the Lord be will be with me then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said I'm reminded of a scripture if the Lord before us what's the rest who can be against us if the Lord before us who can be against us they gotta say what can be against us because you might take the Who as a person or a personality or or something like that but let me say what can be against you who is Satan but he comes in many forms if the Lord before us which we believe he is tonight then who can be against me verse 13. and Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of jephnah Hebron for an inheritance Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Kayla the son of Jeff not the case night unto this day because he holy followed the Lord God of Israel amen I think I'll just stop it right there as far as that scripture is concerned you know there's a I want to take this little thought on on Caleb's portion now you can just take Caleb's name out and just drop your name in there Lord what's my portion tonight what's my portion tonight you know what you're here for but sometimes we you know we get to looking at our our carnality and and we just think well it's just I just don't got it I just don't God but God doesn't want you looking at you boy if we could just take the mirror the mirrors off of the walls of our bathroom and off of the walls of our bedroom and we could place this mirror this picture in the mirror because this is what God wants you looking at he wants you to look at the all sufficient like we heard that little song the All sufficient sacrifice the one that came not just to pay the whole price but to make sure that you and I would make it he promised I would come and live in you to make sure you're going to make it over you don't want you looking at you he wants you looking at him he wants your eyes focused on the word of God and there's a little there's a little fella you'll find over in the book of of Chronicles and you know what Chronicles it's kind of almost a boring book to read if you if you that are Bible students or or study the scriptures at all you get to you get to looking at it and it's just like all these genealogies this man was this man's son and it all just goes on and it just you just get lost in it all and I'm not very good at all that kind of stuff but there is something that did catch my attention if you turn over the book of Chronicles First Chronicles chapter four and just keep it on your lap for a moment I want to look at a little man by the name of Jabez not very much a set about him not very much as spoke about him you don't hear about him much but I'll tell you what if God was God if God thought enough of him to put him in his word then there was a value to him being there and when we begin to look at this this young man I I tell you what the more I begin to study his little life what what's there and and you know you got to basically read into it but when you start looking at what's there I'll tell you what he ought to be such an inspiration to each one of us we ought to be able to look into the word of God and say Lord that's me Lord that's what I want in my life and and First Chronicles chapter 4 and verse 9 it starts out like this it says in Jabez was more honorable than his brethren and his mother called his name Jabez saying because I bear him with sorrow I don't know about you but you know brother Brown makes a statement like this he says he says you know he says a name the value in a name and he gets talking to parents he says now be careful what you name your children you know what I I have to be honest you know I I got a family and I got kids and and they're having kids and some of the names I'm scratching my head thinking oh my word where did you pull that out of it but but today's world there there's names that are being spoken and brother Brown makes a comment he says you know how he says don't name your kid Ricky and don't name him Elvis and and he makes that he makes those comments for a reason he says now he says as you speak that name every name comes with a character and you might not realize what it is but as you speak that name Johnny do this Johnny do that Johnny I need you to do this John I need you to do that John I need you to I'm not picking on John because I have a John but but as you as you speak that name a characteristic gets molded into that being because you call him that name Now read the scriptures and his mother named him Jabez because I bore him in sorrow wow how do you like a name like that who doesn't sound that bad it expresses the woman's pain not her Joy the pain that she went through maybe maybe her husband died maybe things went wrong I don't know what happened but but for whatever reason she was in a lot of Sorrow when she bore this young and she calls him that and every time somebody calls him that that's what's going to be imparted into his life excuse me brother Joshua it is right we gotta we have a brother back at home that come over from oh I forget what country it was uh brother lucky his name is lucky and and you know it wouldn't be something I would have named my child and maybe his mom and dad didn't see it any different but but but he is seems like whatever he touches it just works here's Jabez how would you like to be called Jabez that's almost kin to be calling loser hey Loser come on upstairs loser it's supper time loser how did you do at school loser how would you like it if it was your name Jabez oh yeah all the all the sorrow my mother was in Jabez all of this is being implanted into this young man but I want you to notice look at the young man here's his situation he's come out of Sorrow he's been raised in a home that's full of Sorrow and now he hears as a young man but but Jabez has got something inside of him he's got he's got a hold of a revelation he's got a hold of a revelation that God literally stops the chronicler and he begins to expound on this one young man by the name of Jabez and if you get to looking at him he says at verse 10 says in Jabez called on the god of Israel saying oh that thou would bless me indeed and enlarge my coasts that thine hand might be with me that I that thou wouldest Keep Me From Evil that it may not grieve me and God granted him that which we which he requested look at Jabez Jabez had he caught a revelation I'm an Israelite I don't care what it what people say about me I don't care where you come from I don't care what your background is some of you are like me raised in a message home and that's a wonderful blessing but listen there's many that God's raised up like Rahab the Harlem we heard of her last night like uh like Ruth the moabitus and how many of our generation how many of the people we know literally have come out of the we call it the bottom of the barrel but Satan will be there to remind them constantly of where they come from what they were how they were raised the mistakes they made and how they could never get any closer but if you catch the same Revelation Japan's caught as a born-again Son of God you can say the same thing Jabez is saying here he said he was more honorable than all of his Brethren but he wasn't looking at his he wasn't looking at his problem he wasn't looking at his circumstance he wasn't acknowledging what the world was calling him but he said you know what I have an inheritance I'm an Israelite I was a born Israelite and brother Brown would use this little illustration he would use this little illustration of a you know of a he called it a knock-kneed little donkey or a a horse or whatever it was and how two farmers were side by side and you know and they would they each had animals and he got to talking about the one farmer had just this great farm and and and he raised pedigreed animals and here comes this one little horse that comes out in the spring and the poor little thing is just it's it's just decrepit it just really it's it's it just doesn't look like it's going to amount to anything you know it's all not need and its tail is bent and you know maybe the ear is hanging low and and and beside him are these beautiful young prancing horses and and and he gets to looking at himself and he's like well I know what I know what's going to happen to me I look in the mirror and I know what's going to happen to me he's just going to put me on the ax you know on the chopping block and that'll be the end of me there was one problem brother Brandon would remind us his mother would say no you don't have to worry about that because you have a pedigree a pedigree not a pedicure girls a pedigree you have a pedigree Brothers we have a pedigree tonight sisters we have a pedigree tonight we have a lineage that comes from God himself and God himself is going to finish that which he has started here's his little man jabezen and you know he he maybe didn't have much to star with in life and he maybe wasn't he wasn't looked at but he was not afraid to call on God and say Lord bless me bless me I believe that here we are tonight and regardless of where you're walking with the Lord why don't you just get down and say Lord bless me I'm not talking about tonight Lord bless my life Lord make my life a blessing take me and make me what you want me to be why because I am a Son of God I'm not going to be I am tonight I'm a Son of God Lord bless my life and and you know the Bible would say a sincere prayer of a righteous man a veilth much and you say well I believe that brother Johanna and I believe Jonathan's a righteous man and brother Cheryl's a righteous man brother Bob's your righteous man and you know brother Paul is a righteous man I believe all those things I believe those are righteous men and but you know what the problem is you say but me I make so many mistakes I I can't really call myself righteous that is a lying devil because the prophet would come down and give us the definition of righteous which you won't find in the dictionary he would say a righteous man is not a perfect man a righteous man is a forgiven man that's the difference I'm righteous he's he I'm righteous because he's righteous I'm perfect because he's perfect Hallelujah so you know the bible say that that God is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him diligently seek Him and when we look at jabez's life when we look at the proclamation he's made Lord bless me Lord I don't got much going for me and I I'm not nothing but the Lord blessed me anyhow I'm I'm an Israelite Lord I I've got a lineage I've got a genealogy and Lord I want you to bless my life well you might even be afraid to go to God and ask him that tonight you may say well brother Dwayne that's that you know I'm not preaching Prosperity Gospel I hope you I hope you catch this I'm not preaching Prosperity Gospel but I do believe that God wants his children happy I do believe he wants him happy I do believe he wants him to he wants to meet their needs I I believe that we can be happy in the good times and we can be happy in the bad times because he is our portion you know it's a so you know Caleb wasn't afraid to go and make his Proclamation hey you promised me that land Jabez is not afraid to go to God under the circumstances and say Lord I can show you that I'm an Israelite here it is I can follow all my lineage all the way back to my great great great great I know that my greatest of great grandfathers was Abraham I know I lay in the promise he could say that sometimes you've got to go back and remind God and you really need to remind the enemy of whose son you really are whose daughter you really are so there's there's lots of times you know Jabez might have thought you know he could have been like we are so many times and just even been afraid I don't know if I'm asking too much Lord listen the Bible says ask abundantly that your joy would be full the problem is that we are we're afraid I touched on this last night we're afraid to ask we're afraid God won't answer our prayers Satan brings something to our mind and a little fear comes upon us and and we get afraid brother Brown would say that this is what's the trouble of the church today says you're afraid you're afraid when you ask you won't receive he says that's the reason you don't receive don't be don't be scared excuse me ask and then believe you're going to get it you'll get it bro Matt you heard those testimonies you were telling on dinner at breakfast this morning you get it he said God will give it to you now we know there's only two faculties there's there's only two forces that you and I are contending with this evening one is Faith and one is fear there's no there's no in between you it's either Faith or it's fear it's either life or it's death it's either God or Satan there's not an in-between he is life and he brings peace and he is faith Satan is death he brings fear and he brings sorrow brother Ryan will make the statement he said there's only two faculties that govern a human and that is either Faith which brings results Faith brings results or fear which has no value in it at all I had a brother at home and I think he I think he said it this way he said you know I hope I get the word rated acronym maybe that's the word I'm looking for you know the word fear f-e-a-r you know what actually speaks about you I I'm real bad at this my education isn't good enough for This Acronym I think is that the right where you it is John help me out here because I know he's smart Faith or fear is false evidence appearing real f-e-a-r false evidence but not just stick tonight whatever your situation is let it stick false evidence if it it listen this is the only truth there is and if what you got or what I got is false I got a couple boys that are Wayward it's false evidence it appears very real I contend with it I look at it I battle with it I talk to the Lord about it all the time but it is false evidence because I have a promise that those are my children and they're my inheritance so I'm not going to look at what I see I'm going to look at the word of God because the rest is a lying vanity just just like no uh Noah just like Jonah was in the bottom of that big fish he had to fight his way through and say it's all lying vanities I look towards that Holy Temple and I Call On Your Name Lord the rest is all lying vanities that's the same thing you and I got to do tonight so we realize that it's fear that keeps you wondering and fear that makes you anxious and fear that that gets you all upset listen fear is fear is not our Master tonight fear is not our master because when Jesus would come he would speak peace every time an angel of God would come and step out of that Dimension into this Dimension and meet somebody face to face what's brother Brown say the first thing that the angel of God would do is say fear not I'm sent from the presence of God why because it would be so it would be so uh says you you think you want to see angels that you don't think you don't know nothing about what you're talking about it's a it's a it's a fearful thing to stand in there in that Holy presence I believe him I believe him but when the spirit of God comes it comes to do what bring peace civil it now Satan's got a job now we know he's got a job and his job is to keep you afraid and if we be honest there's been times in our lives where he's done a good job of his job I'll tell you what he's been promoted to the to the highest promotion or lowest promotion that hell can offer if I could just call it that way he's good at what he does but you and I are not subject to him we are the sons of God what brown would say now listen he says he says listen to me the only hope there is today is the thing that people are afraid of it's that old-time Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back again that's what Satan's scared that's what people are afraid of oh I just I don't know if I can just let go I just don't know Lord I I don't wanna I don't want people to think I'm crazy listen I'd rather they think I'm crazy here as long as he's happy with me amen he says don't he says the Holy Ghost back again don't think it'll make you misbehave yourself that's the devil's business to keep you afraid of Christ but it's the only salvation left for any nation is the Lord Jesus and the power of the Resurrection people are afraid of it you say well brother Dwayne we've moved on we've moved I hear these things often we've moved on we're past that you might be past that as far as the revelation of the word is concerned we're past that as far as as where we're living but Satan's greatest attack is going on right now and you and I are fighting every day that we live we are fighting every day that we live brother Brown would come again he says the trouble with man tonight says the trouble of the people tonight is you're scared the biggest curse there is in the Full Gospel people I don't believe he's talking to Pentecost I believe the holy spirit is letting us know because we believe the Full Gospel they didn't believe it we believe it the Full Gospel people or any other people is because they're afraid God has made the provision but you're afraid to take his word for it if you wasn't afraid tonight why you would take your healing by faith and know that God promised it and the thing would just Plum leave you he said afraid scared I've noticed that that's the reason he said I'm such a believer in healing I know if you can get away the people away from the scare get Love in This Place something is going to happen Hallelujah you know the scripture just says ask abundantly that your joy would be full you know you have not because you don't ask and you don't ask because you don't believe well then whatever I'm feeling is going to be a lying vanity and I'm going to make the same Proclamation that Caleb spoke I'm going to make the same Proclamation that Jabez spoke Lord bless me Lord bless me I'm a Child of God Lord bless me Caleb give me this mountain give me this mountain Lord you promised me this mountain you Lord I'm coming this is my inheritance I'm coming for it now I want you to give me this mountain and God heard it and was pleased we say well brother Dwayne now listen the Bible speaks this way it says I said ask abundantly that your joy might be full and he says but then the scripture says if your heart condemn you not ask what you would that your joy might be full if your heart condemn you not ask what you would that your joy might be full and then we say well hey I'm gonna say if you're like me you know we we look in the mirror of God's word sometimes and we say ah Lord such a failure Lord I come so short of what I see in the word and I come so short of you know something the pressure gets on remember brother Brown when he's got that tax case going on and and he's in the house and he's got all this pressure of having to pray for people and Ministry and and meetings and and then the tax thing going on on top of it all and finally the tax man calls him and his wife answers the phone and says honey it's him again and he grabs his coat and makes a bolt for the door and he says honey tell them I'm out and runs through the door and then a little later he gets a phone brother random I got a boy that's dying I've got a girl that's dying I forget which one it was would you come pray for him certainly he'll come pray he goes Gets In The Presence gets ready to pray for the little boy and all of a sudden that condemnation settles down on his heart but you lied I know Lord but it's just under pressure no but you lied you know battle with it and I'm going to pray but you lied listen I'm so in let's all just say this church I am so thankful I say it this way I I am so thankful that the prophet that God sent was seventh grade educated that he was so transparent that he would tell you and I I lied I lied he would he would begin to express his weaknesses he'll begin to express his shortcomings he would show you and I that he was a man born in sin shaped and iniquity like you and I many times as we get you know we have pastors or preachers to get up behind the pulpit and they're just so perfect and they never would admit to making a mistake they'd never show a flaw they're just and you think oh my he's just such a man of God he is just as frail as you are he has made so many mistakes he has just got this facade going on and God forgive me I don't I'm not thinking or pointing at any man but but I've seen it where there's just they just they just show no weakness no no human they're just they're almost like God to the people and it's like shame on them we're just Flesh and Blood dirt just the same old just like everybody else you go home you make mistakes you rely you tell stories you fall down but but you never say it about yourself because you don't want anybody to think that you could be that kind of person I'm a I'm a I'm a Jonathan I'm a pastor I'm a Son of God yeah you're nothing more than a lump of dirt with a gift in it that's all you are no disrespect here's the man that has the most Revelation out of any man that you and I have ever known standing there saying I lied sir here's this boy dying sir would you excuse me for a minute I've got to go make something right there he goes except the phone calls the whatever office it was sir I got to talk to you for a minute when you called the other day I just got to make something straight when you called the other day and asked if I was in the house I lied and sir I want you to forgive me for that and the attorney on the other end says brother Branham I had such high regard for you all these years and now it has even gone to another level my respect for you has risen even the more so amen thank you sir where he goes straight back to that little boy that's dying sir do you still believe me that if I pray for this little boy that God would raise him up absolutely brother random Heavenly Father what now my heart is clean no condemnation no condemnation what's brother Dwayne trying to say listen sir brother Brown says sometimes this is how we get we're just like oh Lord I I feel so ashamed I've done this I've fallen again and Lord I I'm so ashamed brother Brown makes a statement now you take this home and you put it right in your top pocket by your heart he makes a statement he said you say brother Branham I'd done something the other day I'm afraid the Lord won't heal me tonight oh yes he will don't you get scared you're a Christian just sit still now listen close repent for what you've done wrong see that's right see well well I backslid brother he said that don't make any difference it's powerful Church this is meat for your walk that don't make any difference repent and go on he said you're scared he said the first little thing comes along you you turn your head one and you and you think God's Gonna condemn you he said repent that's all get right you know oh it's okay just to be me isn't it you know we're just we're just all natural we're you know we all got different lineages and we all got different backgrounds and you know some of us are German and and Germans have their own way and you know sometimes we get pretty hard-headed and and we get things pretty set and you know it's got to be my way or it's the highway and and you know we we all got our little things about us and but the reality is that we're all just flesh and blood that we're all flesh and blood and we're all contending for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and we all come up short and we all make mistakes and we all fail and the grace of God and the blood covers it all I think Lord help me because sometimes we find ourselves in this position you know it's not like it's unusual we just you go back and look through the scriptures and you find you know great men that God has raised up and I'm just reminded of Samson right now you know here's this great man of God and he's he's been raised up to destroy a nation literally God has raised them up and and and and he goes wayward he actually notices he actually recognizes the power of God on his life I mean he walks out in the in the battlefield one day and and he kills 600 Philistines with a with a Jawbone of a mule the power of God comes upon him but but he's got this weakness in his life he's got this weakness in his life and and you know what and and then he'd go and he'd fall into his trap again and listen brother Brown said each one of us has a weakness well Lord I don't want that weakness no brother Brian said this you all have a weakness now guard that spot put a guard at that spot because we listen a prophet of God himself being a red-blooded man would hang a cross in his car off of the mirror and some man would make a statement to him say brother Bradham isn't that a Catholic symbol and he would look at him and say what right does the Catholic have to the cross the cross is to every born-again Son of God the cross is for the children of God then he would tell you and me when I'm driving down the road and I get stopped at an intersection or I'm driving along and some half-dressed naked woman comes walking out come on brothers now sisters maybe maybe you don't understand this but it'd be good for you to understand it because uh you know that is a part of a of a of a genetics of a man if I could say that without going into too much that's part of a genetics of a man that is not up to him it was there all along that's part of the Fall the problem is that Satan puts a trap out in front of him and he does it to the sons of God like he does it to the men on the street and a prophet would say I have that cross hanging there so that when they come out the first reaction is to look and he says and I immediately look back at the cross what's he doing he's taking dominion over this vessel right here because this thing will lead him astray this thing is something that he's got to contend with on a daily basis he said so I look at the cross he says and I feel sorry for that woman because she doesn't know what kind of spirit is on her you know he the Lord is so gracious he's given us so much to contend with him that's why God would come right down and begin to speak to you know he began to speak to someone we don't have it so much amongst the message people but the Pentecostal women and say hey you don't dress like that don't dress uh you know I heard him say no I hope I'm not going to step on anybody's toes tonight but I heard him say the other day I say you know a number of years back when we were young there was these skirts or dresses or whatever they were knit you what I mean you pour yourself into him back and I it always bothered me and I I you know I thought Lord that's not right because because those are there's other men well I'm still wearing a dress no that's not it it's a form-fitted and it would cause a man in his weakness to think the wrong thoughts not because he wants to but because the enemy would use I'm I'm not now why I'm on this right now because the enemy would use it and it would become a trap to that man and he said and then he would remind those sisters he said now listen sisters God will hold you responsible for that man's thoughts and you know what the women of today would say get over it grow up who what kind of pervert are you what kind of sick being I don't know why I'm on this right now what kind of a sick being are you here's the reality that men were made the way they are made and a woman is made the way she is made let me tell you something sis if you don't understand your husband and he doesn't understand you there's a reason for it after 36 years she's still a mystery I'm only starting to kind of figure it out you know what she tells me honey I wish when God took me out of you he would have left a little piece of me in you then you would understand me but brother Bob he took her all out and made her a completely different individual and it's only the love of God that can keep you together it's only the love because you listen let me tell you something what's this if you haven't got one already you'll get one it'll just be a short little time and then Mr Wright you know handsome strapping kind of like your dad he's just gonna show up you're saying not me I'm not gonna bear a man like my dad oh yes you will when you do remember you'll be reminded what brother Dwayne told you yes you will it's gonna show up and he's going to be handsome and you're going to get together and you're going to think oh my man we just love each other so we're so much alike we are so we think alike we do the same we're so excited and then you get married and guess what in three months time you wonder who is this man that I married who is this guy this isn't the man I'm married it's God created men different and he created women different now let me just talk to your mom and dad for a minute I don't even know why I'm on this how did Samson get to this because he's a man like you and me because he has struggles like you and I because listen the very first thing what was it I am so far off right now what what did what did man fall to in the beginning the very first thing where did Satan lay his trap very first sin that was committed outside of not believing the word of God the manifestation of that was a sexual act that's the truth why do you think that everything that you see every sign you read every song you listen to everywhere as you go every place you look why is it every man listen Brothers When We Were Young Brothers When We Were Young I can't talk about these young guys but I can talk about when we were young brother Dale the magazines that you shouldn't have been able to see were hidden behind curtains now they're placed right here where young boys that are six seven eight years old they can watch they can look right at it as their mom walks through the store and pays for the groceries it's right there for them to look at why is it because the very thing that caused the fall in the beginning is what Satan is trying to use to finish his work to destroy man but listen Church there is a bride of Christ in this age that is not going to fall to that she's going to rise up that was a that was a natural type of something spiritual and there was a there's also a spiritual adultery that was going to be committed but the Bride of this age is going to stand in the middle of Satan's Eden and she's going to be able to look straight at every vile and filthy thing and God is going to hold the holy veil in front of her and she'll be able to look and turn her head and look and turn her head and when she does look too wrong she's too long she will he will immediately go back and say father forgive me I didn't mean to do that Lord You Know My Heart Lord give me Grace give me listen mama you ought to I'll say I don't even know where I'm at tonight but you ought to be praying for your husband from the time he leaves home in the morning and when he gets back home at night you ought to have the table spread you ought to have the the nicest dress on and and the sweetest smelling perfume he likes and you ought to be there to embrace him and say honey I am so glad you're home you ought to make home such a sanctuary that where that he wants to come home at the end of the day I honestly I know Brothers precious Brothers Precious Precious Brothers ah man I'm so far off my notes Lord what am I doing right now brothers that literally wonderful men Godly men Godly wives you know what they could never I know homes that have been totally blown apart because a wife refused to acknowledge that her husband didn't think the way she did or that a man would refuse to think that her husband or what his wife would think different no she just thinks the same as I do no she does not Brothers let me take it from you tell you she does not think the way you do and neither does he think the way you do sis it's completely different and that's why the Bible would say learn to uh live with them according to the knowledge of Grace I'm so far off my topic right now listen Brothers you go brother Bob you told me a little bit about what you did but you didn't just come out of school do that and when you got the job you didn't know everything you studied it and studied it and learned and studied learned and studied any anybody that's good at what they does but they they they go through and they learn and they study and whether they're trying to grow and they're trying to understand more so why is it that when we get back to our our hometown right to our own people our wives and our husbands we don't do the same thing we just expect brother Dwayne are you listening right now we just expect them just expect her to understand what I mean why didn't you just say what you mean I did well no I didn't hear it that way well I did say what I meant well honey why don't you just say what you mean I did tell you that no you didn't you told me this no no honey I told you this well I didn't hear that what's Satan trying to do the spirit said dad has got to contend with when he walks out the door it's almost too much for a mortal man you maybe don't understand this but this is truth it's almost too much for a mortal man that's what brother Adam says when he gets home make sure that you know you're you're not still in your host coat from this morning and just make sure the house is clean make sure make sure the meal is right I thought you're looking at your mom some of you got all these kids and my wife had four too and I know what it's like and it and Dad I am so far off my notes right now dad if the house isn't spotless you take care of the kids for a week and see how you do buddy you would have less hair than you have right now if you had to take care of your kids for a week you know it and so do I well I don't know about your kids but I know my kids I don't think I could handle it we got the most I'm talking about I'm talking about character I'm not talking just about looks I'm taught we got the most beautiful women on the face of the Earth girls don't you belittle yourselves by allowing some man from out there somewheres to convince you you're cute and you're pretty and that you ought to marry him or you ought to hang out with him don't you don't you go there don't you go there you just give it to the Lord say Lord where's the at send them to me Lord show them show me a quizzy I I've seen I've seen girls leave oh I am so far off my nose Lord what AM where am I I've seen girls leave home because home life they didn't like home life so they found somebody that made them feel good and decided that would be a good life to live and find out a year later they're living in hell don't jump can I go back to my notes I don't know how I got away here but I did we're talking about backsliding and I don't know how that happened but we were there anyhow brother Brown would make a statement like this he said what are you afraid of what are you afraid of he said the very thoughts of people is so scared now we're talking about taking God at his word Caleb's portion I'm sorry I got distracted there no I'm not I take that back I'm not sorry I I the brothers that at home give me give me a they give me a lecture every time I say that so I'm just going to take it back and they say just leave that alone when God does that he's doing that for a purpose so the very thoughts of people is scared oh brother Brown and the doctor told me I just can't get well there's an atonement laying Yonder for you sure well brother Branham I've done so much sins there's an atonement waiting for you there's someone who loves you don't be scared the constant words of Jesus are fear not I'm he that was dead is alive again and Alive forevermore fear not listen get that atmosphere around you know I believe that's that that's why we worship right that's why the musicians come up here and they begin to play ahead of time they begin to set an atmosphere but the Bob comes up here he begins to all that he's filled up with the gift that's in him it begins to pour out what's it doing it's creating an atmosphere and then the worshipers arise they enter in and they begin to pour out their heart what are they doing pouring out what are they doing sweet smelling Savor unto the Lord and then what does Father do he's got a big smile on his face and say wait what do you want son what do you want what do you want you know Brothers said he's not come to bring us fear and failure right he's not come to bring us fear and failure so let me go back to Jabez I I got so sidetracked there you know Jabez chapter 10 uh in first Chronicles not chapter 10 chapter 4 verse 10 I think it is in first Chronicles uh and the next part he says and enlarge my Coast now here's a young man again here's a young man that you know a Son of God that that that has recognized hey I've got a portion I'm a Son of God and I've got a portion and and the word says ask so I'm asking Lord and I I love this I love his Zeal this young man Zeal you know he kind of reminds me a little bit like Peter here he is and and this young man and he says now Lord Lord I know that you've allotted me this much I I know that I've got that this is my portion but but Lord enlarge it enlarge it I want more Lord You're a god of yeah you you know you said that the bank of Heaven is is never empty and and I as a Son of God I I have the ability to take your credit card and just swipe it whenever I need it Lord all my needs supplied isn't that what he said I'll take care of all your needs Brothers you're right your witness is just like I'm a witness how many times have we got to that place and yeah you know we got to a place I remember in my own life you know I told you my animals when they went down and I got to a place I didn't know how I was going to make my land payments and I how I mean I was just down in a bad Strait and of course we don't We're Men we don't talk about these kind of things you know that's one of those things we don't talk about and and so I'm praying and asking the Lord and I'm you know the payment date is coming closer and I don't I don't even make enough money hardly to put food on the table and I'm thinking Lord how am I going to come up with four thousand extra dollars I don't even have money for my own family praying I'm praying and one day I get a little knock on my door my brother that I mean I know him I love him and we've been friends but we lived out in the boonies not too many people came to visit us out there and all of a sudden there's a knock on my door in the evening here's his brother and his sister standing there and I'm like Oh Hey Brother come on in so good to see you you know Saskatchewan the days are long and and so we sit down and we chat we get talking about the good things of God and you know I've got all this burden on my life and I'm just visiting with him like I'm visiting with you right now we're sitting at the end of the at the end of the evening he says Hey brother Dwayne we have time can we just have a word of prayer and I'm like sure let's have a word of prayer and we begin to pray and when you know when we get done praying he he gets up to leave when he takes an envelope with his pocket and he sets it down on my coffee table and I looked up and said oh no brother no no I didn't know what was in the envelope but I thought it may be a little bit of money or whatever and I was like no no brother no no thank you I appreciate it God bless you you know God is my portion he looked me in the face and he said brother Dwayne he said before I left home God told me to leave this envelope here he said it's staying right here what you do with it is up to you but God left us and I'm told to leave this envelope here he was an elder so I said all right sir after he left I opened up the envelope you know how much it was exactly my payment was maybe four thousand and seventy dollars it was four thousand dollars I thought Lord God I will never leave you I won't forsake you Brothers let me say this you can work here you can work your fingers to the bones you can fret day and night you can you can but if you just committed if you just let Lord God I don't know how I'm going to do this I don't mean to sit around and do nothing I don't know how I'm going to do this Lord but you know my need he who's faithful in the little will be faithful in much you know here's Jabez calling him he's like Laura I just want more Lord I I want I believe that ought to be our hearts cry tonight maybe you're a young Christian you started in your journey and and you would say this Lord I I you know I know you saved me and and I see you're cleaning up my life Lord but but I want the Holy Ghost you know Jabez wasn't happy just to be in Israelite I want more listen I know I'm a Son of God but I want all that God's got for me tonight I want it all and and here we are tonight I I just believe that ought to be your cry tonight that Lord I want what you've got for me I want it I want it all and and I don't believe that we're just living in the Pentecostal age I believe that the Pentecostal experience the very the very experience of the Holy Ghost coming to dwell in your life I believe that he's still doing the same things I believe he still wants to manifest himself in the same way and you know listen he don't just want you to give you the Pentecostal experience but he wants to give you the adoption paper as the Son of God that that you can go and swipe your and put your name you know just fill in the check Lord I need Lord I have a need here's my need cash it father listen he's not going to turn you down he knows you're not going to ask him this he knows you I we had a little brother come to church here a while ago just a fellow off the street and believe me sometimes I'll tell you what uh you know we're in the hour we're we're they can really come in and then this one was one of them uh I tell you what and you know he said you know what brothers listen I I heard about this this ministry on the radio and they're preaching he says and and God was blessing them and they told us to call in and God would give us what we were asking for he said you know what I asked for brother Paul I asked him for a million dollars I looked at him and said really what are you gonna do with it oh man do you know what I could do with a million dollars I said I said God wants your heart now that's the carnal I want a million dollars but what does a spiritual man say brother Bob oh [Music] I've had it all but what I need is more of you that's right I'm not interested God said he'd Supply these needs we want Christ we want Christ oh my I feel like I just need to to move on here tonight what's the next little portion and that thine hand might be with me I Saints are you are you taking time to read this tonight look at this man's request God bless me and that's like that's like getting on your knees and praying and you know you're praying for this brother and praying for that sister and praying for this situation praying and Lord don't forget so and so and Lord God never gets tired of the end and Lord don't forget Lord I know and Lord and father and Lord I Lord I need deliverance from this Lord I need strength in this and Lord I'm going to need your help here he never gets tired of hearing that you might get tired I might have been tired as a daddy of hearing it Dada dad but Dad but but father never gets tired Lord and and here's his Jabez and say bless me indeed Lord and enlarge my Coast Lord Lord I know I know you're going to give me but Lord bless me lots well that's not a shame I I don't know about you but that's how I feel Lord I don't want just a little bit of this Holy Ghost Gospel I Want It All Lord I want lots of it I want I want the Holy Ghost and Fire to keep me alive I don't want to burn out down the road I want it all I want with a I want what the what the the original Pentecostals had I want the Revelation that the seventh angel had I want everything that this Bride Can Have I want my new body I want the New Jerusalem I want it all sound like a spoiled kid now you see Satan's copy of today now you see Satan's copy of today where kids think they just deserve everything just because I'm your kid well that is there's a reality that we're sons of God and we do deserve everything not that we deserve it but he said he give it to us because we're part of him but he'll give it the right way when your character can handle it Hallelujah look at this and that's your hand might be with me and that your hand might wait hold on Lord enlarge my Coast and just let me know that you're here that you've never left me that you haven't forsaken me Lord Lord and whatever I'm putting my hands Lord I want you to bless it but let me know that you're in it let me know you're in it because many times we can jump into things just in our flesh and find out you know what he wasn't in it at all cost us a whole lot ended up costing us years of our life because we jumped into something that we thought was a good thing without praying Hallelujah I like this last little part that thou words keep me from evil that thou woulds what a request what a request that thou wouldst keep me from evil well Lord what do you mean Japan's what are you saying telling you Brothers that this is hell Satan's Eden and the gate has been pulled off hell and every filthy vowel evil spirit has been loosed it just so happens that you're the target you're the target and here's Jabez before the blood of the Lamb is saying Lord keep me Keep Me From Evil there's gonna be a lot of Temptations I'm gonna be I'm gonna be enticed in a lot of different areas of my life there's going to be times that I'm attempted in business there's gonna be times I'm gonna be tempted in my marriage there's going to be times that I'm going to be tempted to do this and tempted to do that Lord Lord keep me from the evil that's surrounding me isn't that exactly what he wants to do isn't that exactly what he wants to do keep you from evil I believe that was on my heart I believe it'd be a good thing for us to just pray this way sometimes remind the Lord I'm heading out Mama pray for your husband when he walks out the door father keep them keep them from those spirits that are out there because that's what they are spirits keep them from those spirits Our Father which heart in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in Earth not just in Earth but in Earth as it is in heaven what does the rest say and God granted him that which he requested as a Son of God he wasn't afraid to ask as a daughter God you don't have to be afraid to ask come bring your burdens to me okay I'll take your I'll take your burdens and I'll carry them for you just just ask well brother Dwayne but I I feel like I'm lacking faith then should we ask for faith should we not be asking for faith Lord you promised me the faith you didn't promise me a faith you promised me the faith and you told me Lord that the faith of a mustard seed if I had the faith of a mustard seed the smallest of all the seeds of the earth if I had that faith you say well brother Dwayne you're saying if I had that Faith you have that faith that small little seed if it would just let if you'll just let it Bloom if you'll just let it grow watch what it'll become and become a great tree watch watch what it'll produce in your life just keep watering it by the word of God Hallelujah in closing if the musicians would come around speaks this they told me says they told me the same thing you're sure he says I worked 17 years till God got me out and built me around this he's talking about his ministry let me just back up he says some of you preachers now that's that's too scared to take your stand afraid they won't let you come in into the organized organization he says what else are you going to do to them what else are you going to do then they kick you out he says I feel sorry for you first sing your weakness that's right now brother let me just say this he said where's your faith in God they told me the same thing sure worked 17 years to God until God got me out and built me around this and I thought now Satan you come now see where it's at when you really realize that God has revealed to you the truth of the thing there's nothing in the world that's going to defeat you in it that's all you're absolutely undefeatable absolutely undefeatable but he says not you but God that's in you but God that's in you he says not the body but the word that was in him not Mary but the word that was born in her what was Mary can I say this I believe Mary got her portion because she said be it unto me when the angel spoke to her said be it unto me according to Thy word she got her portion she got to bring forth the very the the very life of the Living God she got to bring forth her portion you know there's so many of us we come to so many places in our lives and and and and did you come for your portion tonight do you come to God in the morning for your portion that morning listen you have no trouble Brothers you had no trouble sitting down at that breakfast table this morning looking on that menu you flip back and forth through that menu back and forth and you wonder oh man there's so much that looks good in here I don't know I mean those pictures say a thousand words I don't know

your portion you came for your portion I tell you in some of you brother Jonathan you waited a long time you ordered it but you waited a long time but guess what it was on its way and every time my brother would turn around look at you and say hey oh man I'm feeling bad that you're eating you said don't because it's on its way it's coming it's coming he was so convinced as long as he had to wait he was so convinced it's coming it's coming now what about you tonight are you convinced that what you've been asking the Lord for is on its way or are you still waiting to be convinced that it's on its way listen sometimes we're we we do the same thing in our prayer life we we put in our order so to speak God's not just an order taker by the way God wants to be loved and he wants to be adored he wants to be Fellowship he wants to sit down at the table and he wants to love you and and talk it over with you and he wants to tell you how how great he is and he wants you to tell him how heavy your burden is and he wants you to put in your order he said you have not because you don't ask but if you just ask I'll give it to you I'll give it to you so here he is he orders in and we're waiting waiting for what Jonathan the two buckets of toast that she brought you oh that's food maybe that's all somebody got tonight but it's not what you ordered the reality is you didn't order the two
