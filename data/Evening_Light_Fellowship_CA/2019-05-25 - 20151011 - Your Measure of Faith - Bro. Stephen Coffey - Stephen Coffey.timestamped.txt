[43:44] this morning happy to be in the house of
[43:49] the Lord this morning
[43:50] hey man it's good to be here you know
[43:55] what while you're standing this this
[43:58] turn in our Bibles I'd like to read a
[44:00] scripture before you're seated let's
[44:02] just jump right into the Word of God
[44:03] there's a wonderful atmosphere here this
[44:05] morning if you would turn with me to the
[44:11] book of Romans chapter 12 well it was
[44:29] beautiful weather when I got here and
[44:31] everybody's been telling me that I
[44:33] jinxed it because yesterday it was
[44:35] raining and miserable today was kind of
[44:37] shifting back towards the good side so I
[44:40] guess I won't say anything about the
[44:42] weather just let's see how it turns out
[44:45] but really again I'm just really
[44:48] thankful to be here and real honored and
[44:51] privileged that I'd be asked to come and
[44:53] speak and you know I don't consider
[44:55] myself to be a great speaker or anybody
[44:56] important because I'm not but I do know
[45:00] that the Lord put it on my heart to come
[45:01] so I came in the confidence that he
[45:04] would speak through me if you put it on
[45:06] my heart to come until then if it's not
[45:08] up to me than what I speak or what I
[45:09] wouldn't what I do with it it's up to
[45:12] him to do okay that's what he wants so I
[45:16] have a lot of faith and what faith I do
[45:19] have in his ability to speak to you I
[45:21] place into his hands so that he can
[45:23] speak to you and whatever need that you
[45:24] would have because I really I know some
[45:28] of you very well and so uh I know others
[45:30] very little but he knows you and he
[45:33] knows exactly what's going on songs 139
[45:37] it says Lord do you know what words I
[45:40] have in my mouth to speak in other words
[45:42] you know the words that I'm going to
[45:44] speak next
[45:45] so you not only know the words that I
[45:46] just said but you know exactly what I'm
[45:48] going to say next
[45:51] we can have a lot of confidence in that
[45:53] if that be true either believe it's true
[45:55] or you don't see the true or it's not I
[45:58] happen to believe that it is true and if
[46:01] it be true that I put the faith that I
[46:03] have that it is truth into his hands and
[46:05] he'll accomplish what he sets out to
[46:07] accomplish so again this very excited to
[46:10] be here and this is the last service and
[46:13] just gonna speak what's on her heart and
[46:15] try to wrap up what we've been talking
[46:17] about this weekend and pray that the
[46:19] Lord would bless that right so if you
[46:22] would turn your attention to the
[46:23] scripture now just for a second Romans
[46:27] chapter 12 let's start at verse 3 I
[46:34] heard a man say one time if there was
[46:37] any book that you'd want to have if you
[46:40] were stuck on an island it'd be the book
[46:42] of Romans he said out of any book in the
[46:44] Bible if you were stuck in an island you
[46:46] could pick just one book that you would
[46:47] want to have it be the book of Romans
[46:49] the Apostle Paul says here in Romans
[46:51] chapter 12 and verse 3 he says fry I say
[46:55] through the grace given unto me to every
[46:59] man that is among you not to think of
[47:02] himself more highly than he ought to
[47:04] think but to think soberly and that word
[47:08] that word means with self-control I
[47:10] think with self-control think with
[47:15] Sabrina
[47:17] think of your own self then he says this
[47:21] phrase according as God has dealt to
[47:23] every man the measure of faith so he
[47:27] uses this phrase the measure of faith
[47:29] that God hath dealt to every man
[47:32] so he's saying that every man has a
[47:34] measure of faith that God hath dealt to
[47:37] him and he's talking about gifts he's
[47:39] saying service that could the Christian
[47:42] life and service and the different gifts
[47:45] that we have among the body but then he
[47:47] says don't think of yourself more highly
[47:49] than you ought to think of yourself
[47:50] think of yourself with self-control
[47:52] subrata sober because God hath dealt you
[47:56] the exact measure of faith and that you
[47:59] will need to accomplish what he's given
[48:01] you
[48:04] let's pray gracious Heavenly Father
[48:07] we're again thankful for this
[48:08] opportunity to be in the house of the
[48:10] Lord and we don't take it for granted
[48:14] Lord that we're here this morning
[48:15] because I know it's it's all by your
[48:19] grace that we have this building you
[48:21] have heat in the building that we have
[48:24] each other that we have family we have
[48:27] friends we have the family of God it's
[48:30] only by your grace that we're here Lord
[48:32] and we don't want to take that for
[48:33] granted
[48:34] we thank you Lord for this opportunity
[48:36] and I ask if there'd be anything that
[48:39] would hinder the moving of your Holy
[48:41] Spirit which I have confidence that you
[48:44] can do if there'd be anything that can
[48:47] that would hinder that and I pray that
[48:49] you just remove it from the building
[48:50] remove it from our minds remove it from
[48:52] our hearts take it away and we humbly
[48:56] submit ourselves into your presence and
[48:59] into your word bring our hearts and our
[49:01] minds and subjection to the word of God
[49:04] granite lets you make that this morning
[49:07] bring us one step further give us
[49:09] something that we can walk away from
[49:11] this service and say did not our hearts
[49:13] burn within us when we were there in
[49:16] your gracious name that we pray a name
[49:18] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[49:20] you can be seated thank you well let's
[49:26] get right into the word and them again
[49:31] just to bring everybody up to date who
[49:34] if you weren't here on the the past
[49:38] services we we saw brother Branham he
[49:45] preached that there's either faith or
[49:50] fear that dominates the entire world and
[49:54] it's either fear that's gonna grip your
[49:56] your being and drive you to do the
[49:58] things that you do or it will be faith
[50:01] that will take ahold of you and drive
[50:05] you to do the things that God wants you
[50:06] to do so if you look at it it's fear
[50:10] that men built the greatest fortresses
[50:14] on the face of the earth so it was by a
[50:16] fear that men developed the greatest
[50:19] businesses that they've ever made they
[50:20] they make more monies in living in fear
[50:23] that they won't be able to live with
[50:25] what they've got that's why a man would
[50:27] be driven to make more money and make
[50:29] more money and then lust is given there
[50:31] and then the fear can come in because
[50:33] lust is it so because Satan has a
[50:36] stronghold in the in the individual then
[50:38] fear can come right in and then take the
[50:40] whole person over and then we see that
[50:42] it is true that it's either faith or
[50:44] fear that someone is driven by so as
[50:46] soon as is as soon as Satan has that
[50:48] Avenue into the human being and you give
[50:50] him that you give him that place in your
[50:54] mind and in your spirit realm then Satan
[50:56] has a right to be there
[50:58] and there could be all kinds of spirits
[51:00] now coming in and giving that person a
[51:03] lot of trouble simply because you gave
[51:05] Satan a right to be there has no right
[51:08] to be in my life because I'm a believer
[51:10] well that's not true at all because you
[51:13] can give place to the devil just because
[51:16] you're born again and Holy Ghost filled
[51:17] doesn't mean that you can't look over
[51:20] here and look to the right or to the
[51:21] left you can give plates to the devil
[51:24] and then he has a right to be there and
[51:26] then the tormentors can come in and all
[51:27] spear all kinds of spirits can then come
[51:30] in and be tormenting you for a year
[51:32] and years and years simply because
[51:33] you've allowed something to have place
[51:36] in your spirit realm it could be true if
[51:39] you if you have a lust and you've been
[51:41] dealing with lust for years and years
[51:42] and years or if someone set something
[51:44] against you and you develop a root of
[51:46] bitterness you develop and you've give
[51:49] place to the devil by dwelling on that
[51:51] in the wrong attitude and the wrong
[51:52] spirit
[51:52] and Satan has a perfect right to be
[51:56] there then and and all the spirits are
[51:58] and you're dealing with lust and all of
[52:00] these kinds of things simply because you
[52:02] have a root of bitterness in your heart
[52:04] it's only until you expose Satan can he
[52:08] leak and he has to flee when he's
[52:10] exposed a spirit does not want to be
[52:12] exposed and the one thing that is in
[52:16] common with all of that is that there is
[52:18] a fear always there so it's either faith
[52:22] or fear that dominates the human being
[52:27] now we know then that the scripture says
[52:30] to fear God and it is the duty of a man
[52:32] to fear God you either you either is it
[52:36] is the entire duty and Solomon said that
[52:38] looking back and at his age and his
[52:40] wisdom he says that it's the duty of a
[52:43] man to fear God with fear not in the not
[52:45] in the respect of to be afraid of him
[52:48] you fear out of reverence so he said it
[52:51] is the duty of man to reverence God in a
[52:53] way that in and to have a certain
[52:56] approach to God in a way that he can
[52:58] honor so he's not obligated to honored
[53:03] if you're not approaching him in the
[53:04] correct way and then Solomon said to
[53:06] fear God and keep his Commandments and
[53:08] when you simply come at God with the
[53:11] respect and the reverence to fear him
[53:13] and then you Allah allow and then you
[53:15] move the wrong kind of fear out of your
[53:17] life then faith can take a hold because
[53:20] brother branham said and the reason I
[53:21] say that is because the Prophet said
[53:24] that if as long as there's the slightest
[53:26] bit of fear there that faith can't move
[53:28] moving your pin your beam you cannot
[53:31] have faith and fear at the same time
[53:33] so you said if you as long as you have
[53:36] fear in there then God cannot work with
[53:38] you you can't grow you can't go further
[53:41] you can't achieve the things that you
[53:42] want to in God you can't be where you
[53:45] should be with God as long as there's
[53:47] that little aspect so you move the fear
[53:51] out and you come to a place and you
[53:52] approach God with reverence and respect
[53:54] and you come to God in a certain way
[53:57] just simply just coming to him and in
[53:59] giving yourself to him with a reverence
[54:01] that gives God the opportunity to come
[54:04] in and the avenue to come in and with
[54:07] the correct approach and he'll come in
[54:08] and faith can take a whole hand so
[54:11] that's where we're at now this morning
[54:13] I'd like this just bring it one step
[54:16] further we're taking one step we'll take
[54:18] another step let's take it one step
[54:19] further
[54:20] well the random says in now in 1958 and
[54:25] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:26] and forever now again the Prophet was
[54:29] subject to progressive revelation he
[54:32] said in 1958 I don't I don't see one
[54:36] thing left to hinder the coming of the
[54:38] Lord Jesus tonight he says that sounds
[54:40] rather erratic but it's it is the truth
[54:42] all the prophecies pertaining to his
[54:44] second coming as far as I know is
[54:47] already fulfilled and it was not 1963
[54:51] yet the seals had not yet been broken
[54:52] and he said I don't see anything that
[54:55] would hinder the moving of the coming of
[54:57] the Lord tonight he said as far as I
[54:58] know all the prophecies are done but
[55:00] there was still something yet to be done
[55:02] and he says so if that be true if if the
[55:07] Lord would come tonight
[55:08] then what kind of a people should we be
[55:10] and Peter said knowing that the the
[55:13] coming of the Lord is nigh what kind of
[55:15] people should we be and he says any
[55:19] minute let's let's live in this meeting
[55:21] and he was in Chattanooga Tennessee
[55:23] he said let's live in this meeting like
[55:25] it would be the last service that we
[55:27] ever had every service I ever preached I
[55:29] always preach it like it's going to be
[55:30] the last one that anybody will ever hear
[55:32] because it could be and I hope this one
[55:35] is what we don't know we have to we have
[55:37] to live like it is
[55:40] he said what kind of people should we be
[55:43] knowing that the coming of the Lord is
[55:44] here a perfect people living the
[55:47] scripture out to the letter of the law
[55:48] without any error is that the kind of
[55:52] people we should be well we know that we
[55:53] are not because firfer since Christ has
[55:57] come actually since the dawn of time man
[56:00] has never been able to completely
[56:02] fulfill the law on his own so we know
[56:06] then that if that be the case then we
[56:09] cannot be a perfect person acting out
[56:13] the scripture perfectly without any
[56:16] error whatsoever on our own hey man so
[56:21] you simply will net what you you will
[56:22] never come to perfection in the flesh
[56:24] because the flesh is never born again so
[56:28] then that if okay or if we're supposed
[56:30] to be a glorious church without spot or
[56:32] wrinkle as the scripture says we're
[56:33] supposed to be then how on earth are we
[56:35] supposed to be that if our Tabernacles
[56:37] are never perfect and are never born
[56:40] again because if we're born again then
[56:42] what aspect of that achieves in us the
[56:44] perfection that Christ is looking for I
[56:46] mean come on if if it doesn't link up
[56:49] there's got to be there's got to make
[56:51] sense because if it doesn't link up then
[56:53] I don't want to believe it if there's
[56:55] one contradiction in scripture or one
[56:58] contradiction in my ability to fulfill
[57:00] Scripture then I don't want to believe
[57:02] it because if I can't fulfill what God
[57:05] gave me to fulfill what's the point I
[57:07] mean come on what's the point so in 1965
[57:13] brother Branham says and now this was
[57:15] after he had the full revelation of what
[57:17] God had used him for okay so this is
[57:20] this is exactly what he was standing
[57:22] with the understanding now and the
[57:24] wisdom to look back and say now it
[57:25] actually is fulfilled but then he added
[57:27] something else and he says the first
[57:30] comes the the message and the bride
[57:31] together the next is the direction of
[57:33] the sleeping bride and the one's died
[57:35] back in the other ages they're caught
[57:36] together and the trumpet the feast of
[57:38] the heavens in the sky and all this
[57:39] things and then he says we're right
[57:42] there now we're ready now and the only
[57:44] thing the church coming out
[57:47] he doesn't say I don't see anything else
[57:48] he says now the only thing the church
[57:51] coming out
[57:52] to lay before the Sun as owen to ripen
[57:56] and then after a while the great combine
[58:00] will come by and the wheat will be
[58:01] burned this the stocks will be burned
[58:03] and the grain will be gathered into his
[58:04] gun so he was standing in 1958 and said
[58:08] there's nothing there so what kind of
[58:09] people should we be in 1965 he adds it
[58:13] and he says we're right there now now it
[58:16] actually is the time but the bride has
[58:19] to lay in the presence of the Sun just
[58:21] like the seed has to lay the president
[58:22] to the Sun and ripen what does that even
[58:24] mean when when it when it comes in
[58:26] context to and people who are now fifty
[58:28] years from that point and standing here
[58:31] and we're still believing the same thing
[58:33] that we did back then how does that even
[58:35] relate to us now because it has I don't
[58:38] again I don't want to have something
[58:40] that doesn't relate to me right now if
[58:43] God is a living God and he is the same
[58:46] yesterday today and forever then that
[58:49] means that there's something for me
[58:50] right now and I want that I mean what
[58:54] goodness it what what point is is there
[58:57] for me living if there is not something
[58:59] in this for me right now so he says
[59:05] after a wild it just has to lay in the
[59:07] presence of the Sun and ripen and then
[59:09] after a while the great combine will
[59:10] come by so the thing about it is the
[59:14] worst thing that anybody could do any
[59:16] Minister could do anybody could do is
[59:18] complicate this it is not you try to
[59:23] explain it you try to pursue it and you
[59:26] try to think it and put it together it
[59:28] just doesn't work that way and it's a
[59:30] revelation from God and that's a gift so
[59:33] you can't just just put it together and
[59:36] make it work it's a gift from God to
[59:39] understand this it's just you can't
[59:41] complicate it the worst thing that you
[59:42] can do to the new birth is try and
[59:44] complicated and try to explain it amen
[59:47] you can't explain it and there is you
[59:50] know we teach it but you just can't
[59:53] complicate it that's the worst thing
[59:54] that you can do
[59:56] a birth the new birth there are five
[59:59] aspects to great grace not great drinks
[1:00:03] and great is another subject but great
[1:00:08] there are five aspects to grace stay
[1:00:12] focus and I always you always look at it
[1:00:16] in the justification sanctification in
[1:00:18] the baptism the Holy Spirit we know that
[1:00:20] but if you look at it just for a second
[1:00:23] you step back it's by grace that we are
[1:00:24] saved through faith right amen
[1:00:27] so it's it's by grace that we are saved
[1:00:29] through faith so then faith that is the
[1:00:32] thing that we are saved by and it's by
[1:00:34] grace that we were done that so that
[1:00:35] means that the new birth would be an act
[1:00:37] of grace but grace is five there are
[1:00:39] five works - grace well there's
[1:00:41] justification sanctification and the
[1:00:43] baptism the Holy Spirit that regenerates
[1:00:45] a believer so then if it's a work of
[1:00:47] grace then what are the other two things
[1:00:48] that means then that they're had and if
[1:00:51] you the the type is the natural birth
[1:00:54] and you cannot beat the type you want to
[1:00:57] not complicate it go back to the type so
[1:00:59] the birth what happens well there's
[1:01:02] conception which is what happened to us
[1:01:04] in the foundation of the world
[1:01:06] we were either formed in the in the in
[1:01:09] the mind of God before the foundation of
[1:01:11] the world ever was or we were now the
[1:01:15] arthur pink said it best he said if God
[1:01:17] just said whosoever will will come to me
[1:01:20] then how could he have been sure that
[1:01:22] anybody would come there had to have
[1:01:24] been a production aided group and I'm
[1:01:26] looking
[1:01:28] there had to be a predestinate a group
[1:01:30] well that's that's the conception now
[1:01:31] then you come to the water and the blood
[1:01:33] and the birth but that's only for
[1:01:36] aspects because there's conception and
[1:01:38] then there's the water that breaks in
[1:01:40] there's the blood that comes in then
[1:01:41] there's the baby that comes but that's
[1:01:43] only four and if it's a it's if it's
[1:01:46] five a work of grapes and there has to
[1:01:48] be another one and the thing about it is
[1:01:50] is that the birth is meant to produce
[1:01:53] the baby it's meant to produce a living
[1:01:56] breathing kicking screaming baby it's
[1:01:58] not meant just to produce a life and
[1:02:00] then it's a grown human being and it's
[1:02:01] done the birth is meant to produce a
[1:02:04] life that is lived over a long period of
[1:02:07] time and that is in the hands of God so
[1:02:11] when you are birthed into Christ you
[1:02:12] become a living being you become a
[1:02:15] kicking screaming baby when you're first
[1:02:17] birthed into Christ and that takes
[1:02:19] justification sanctification and the
[1:02:21] baptism of the holy spirit and then
[1:02:23] you're birthed into you receive the Holy
[1:02:25] Ghost and you're sealed into Christ at
[1:02:26] that moment and there's nothing at all
[1:02:29] to that except faith you believe that's
[1:02:34] all there is to it it's not complicated
[1:02:36] so when you you believe now with the
[1:02:38] faith that you need to accomplish this
[1:02:40] task which is a gift from God then you
[1:02:43] become a life that you now live for
[1:02:45] Christ and once you are a life that you
[1:02:47] live for Christ
[1:02:48] you can't backslide you can lose your
[1:02:50] testimony but you can never lose your
[1:02:52] salvation you are sealed into Christ and
[1:02:56] that is it and you either believe that
[1:02:58] or you don't you're going to either have
[1:02:59] fear or you're gonna have faith in that
[1:03:02] matter so when you're in this point in
[1:03:05] time when you are living the life of
[1:03:07] that that the that the birth produced
[1:03:09] and you have the life that you are now
[1:03:11] living there's there can be fear that
[1:03:13] get creeps in through the spirit realm
[1:03:15] and the avenues that Satan will use to
[1:03:17] get into you and you can actually be all
[1:03:20] confused and messed up and all over the
[1:03:21] place or there will be faith there and
[1:03:25] you can produce the maturity that God
[1:03:27] wants to bring by the sea laying in the
[1:03:30] Sun to ripen so you see now he says
[1:03:32] we're right here ready now but now the
[1:03:34] seed has got to lay in the Sun was just
[1:03:36] like there now it's just like with a
[1:03:37] believer they'd be there a birth into
[1:03:40] Christ they receive the baptism
[1:03:41] the spirit there sealed into Christ but
[1:03:43] they've got to produce something and it
[1:03:46] starts with faith now the whole plan of
[1:03:53] God and this is the amazing thing that
[1:03:56] the the prophets ministry brought to us
[1:03:57] is that we can understand the the plan
[1:04:00] that God had for us so it's not some
[1:04:03] complicated mystical thing it's not that
[1:04:05] because you can understand all of the
[1:04:07] doctrines and all of the mysteries and
[1:04:09] you can understand all of that and not
[1:04:10] have perfect love and be nothing and be
[1:04:15] completely void of any growth of
[1:04:16] anything manifestation or manifesting of
[1:04:19] God's Spirit in your in your life you
[1:04:22] can be void of that when you don't have
[1:04:24] love so in Colossians now 1:15 you don't
[1:04:29] have to turn to it he says Colossians
[1:04:31] 1:15 he says who is the image of the
[1:04:35] invisible God and he's talking about
[1:04:36] Christ the logos because at the
[1:04:39] beginning it was God and all of the
[1:04:40] attributes that God was he poured into
[1:04:42] Christ I need you to stick with me and
[1:04:45] listen up because I'm going fast but I'm
[1:04:47] just gonna touch some points we'll wrap
[1:04:49] it all together so if he missed the
[1:04:52] points and you're gonna be sticking hat
[1:04:53] out of the package and I don't want you
[1:04:54] to sticking out of the package so we're
[1:04:55] gonna wrap it up together so you have to
[1:04:57] stick with me and he says all that
[1:05:01] Christ wants he are all that God was he
[1:05:03] poured into Christ
[1:05:04] so now Christ the logos was the very
[1:05:08] attributes of God and that was the
[1:05:10] manifestation of God that was the first
[1:05:12] thing so this is what Paul is talking
[1:05:13] about to the people of colossal who is
[1:05:16] the image of the invisible God the
[1:05:17] firstborn of every creature for by him
[1:05:20] we're all things created that are in
[1:05:21] heaven and that are then that are in
[1:05:24] earth visible and invisible whether they
[1:05:25] be Thrones or dominions principalities
[1:05:27] all things were created by him and for
[1:05:29] him and he is before all things and by
[1:05:33] him all things consist
[1:05:34] and is the head of the body the church
[1:05:37] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:05:39] the dead that in all things he might
[1:05:41] have the preeminence
[1:05:43] for it pleased the father that in him
[1:05:47] should all the fullness dwell and if you
[1:05:49] ever have any problems with the Trinity
[1:05:50] and people say well it always says the
[1:05:53] father and the son there's always the
[1:05:54] father in the son
[1:05:55] so if they made that denotation then
[1:05:57] obviously there's a separation there
[1:05:59] well you can't have scripture go against
[1:06:01] scripture and Jesus said that I and my
[1:06:03] father are one if you've seen me you've
[1:06:04] seen the father so if that be true then
[1:06:07] you can apply it to this scripture
[1:06:08] because they can't disagree with each
[1:06:10] other so Christ was the if it pleased
[1:06:14] the father that in Christ all the
[1:06:15] fullness to dwell not Jesus of Nazareth
[1:06:18] because that was only one attribute that
[1:06:20] God fulfilled the attribute of
[1:06:22] redemption
[1:06:23] it was Christ the logos that was that
[1:06:25] Paul is talking about it and Christ is
[1:06:27] to have the preeminence in all things
[1:06:30] all things and if that be true then
[1:06:34] Christ is supposed to have the
[1:06:35] preeminence in my life another thing
[1:06:38] that I can do to disallow God's
[1:06:41] preeminence in my life hey man and
[1:06:45] brother branham said the Christ is a
[1:06:46] mystery of God revealed and this is the
[1:06:48] most this is my favorite quote and I
[1:06:51] don't think you should have favorite
[1:06:52] quotes but this is my favorite quote
[1:06:54] Christ is a mystery of God revealed
[1:06:56] which some perhaps about David sermon
[1:06:58] 1963 he says first this is God's three
[1:07:02] full plan this is it everybody listen
[1:07:04] this is it he says first to express his
[1:07:07] self completely God in Christ when he
[1:07:10] did that second to have the eminences by
[1:07:15] this in his church which is his body the
[1:07:18] bride till he could have the preeminence
[1:07:20] to express himself through them so first
[1:07:23] was to express himself in Christ which
[1:07:25] he did so he's now the low Goff sees
[1:07:27] everything and he wants to have
[1:07:29] preeminence and everything
[1:07:30] second to have a bride a church that he
[1:07:33] could express himself through them by
[1:07:36] and thus have the preeminence through
[1:07:38] them so it was it was God in Christ and
[1:07:42] Christ in His Church and house God's
[1:07:45] plan and then by that thirdly to restore
[1:07:48] the kingdom to it's rightly position and
[1:07:51] fell by sin by the first Adam the back
[1:07:53] where he walked in the cool of the
[1:07:54] evening with his people talked with him
[1:07:57] and fellowship with God wanted and then
[1:08:01] awesome he simply wanted to manifest
[1:08:04] himself in Christ the logos which is the
[1:08:06] it's it's everything the beginning in
[1:08:09] the first the end is everything
[1:08:11] manifests himself in that and then have
[1:08:14] us to manifest Venna fest himself
[1:08:17] through on the earth and then by that
[1:08:20] bring us back to himself so that we
[1:08:22] could dwell back where it was
[1:08:23] intentionally supposed to be in the
[1:08:25] Garden of Eden so God had a plan but he
[1:08:28] wanted to bring the bride through the
[1:08:31] bring the bride through what we've been
[1:08:33] brought through and by Jesus of Nazareth
[1:08:35] give us access into what we can now be
[1:08:38] brought back into which is what God's
[1:08:40] plan was in the beginning to bring us
[1:08:42] back to what it was in the Garden of
[1:08:43] Eden so you think well why did he have
[1:08:45] to bring us all the way through that
[1:08:47] well if you ever thought character is
[1:08:49] the only thing we bring with us to
[1:08:50] heaven why is character the only thing
[1:08:52] that we bring with us to heaven is
[1:08:53] because we had to quit we are too the
[1:08:56] scripture says if we want to reign with
[1:08:57] him we must suffer with him we had to go
[1:09:00] through this character building process
[1:09:02] which Peter said those through many many
[1:09:05] fold just for a season
[1:09:07] you'd be tested that the trying of your
[1:09:09] faith remember now it's faith that the
[1:09:12] testing of your faith would produce just
[1:09:15] as like gold so you're bringing brought
[1:09:17] through this process now where your
[1:09:19] faith and your character is being built
[1:09:21] so that you can reign with him and just
[1:09:23] as king and a queen would ring and if
[1:09:27] cannot reign or rule characterless so a
[1:09:32] power without character is satanic so he
[1:09:35] wanted to bring you through to get the
[1:09:37] character that you needed to bring you
[1:09:38] back to what he wanted you to be at the
[1:09:39] at the beginning that to me makes me
[1:09:42] happy very few things in planet Earth
[1:09:45] it'll make me fly fishing and the duck
[1:09:47] hunting and fish and chips probably a
[1:09:52] few other things but but this makes me
[1:09:55] happy that he would that this is the
[1:09:57] plan this is the plan and when what what
[1:10:00] on earth what what on earth did you have
[1:10:03] to be back there in the mind of God that
[1:10:07] he would want you to be here and
[1:10:09] you back to that so if you had no
[1:10:13] capability or no ability whatsoever to
[1:10:16] be brought to that then how could you
[1:10:19] have any capability to remove yourself
[1:10:21] from it if God intentionally in purpose
[1:10:26] you my predestination to be there then
[1:10:30] what could you do to be out of there
[1:10:32] because you didn't do it you didn't have
[1:10:34] any ability that that brought you into
[1:10:36] it because it was God that conceived you
[1:10:39] into it
[1:10:39] so what could you do then to be brought
[1:10:42] out of it what could you do then to
[1:10:44] exclude yourself from them he brought to
[1:10:46] you on the basis of free moral agency
[1:10:48] but it was something inside of you that
[1:10:50] responded to the message not you so it's
[1:10:53] free moral agency and you you responded
[1:10:55] to that on the basis of free moral
[1:10:56] agency so that he could bring you back
[1:10:58] into it to then bring you back to the
[1:11:00] same spot that he wanted you to him so
[1:11:04] we have this idea of when brother
[1:11:07] Branham said well what kind of people
[1:11:09] should we be we should be perfect people
[1:11:10] and we should be this and you think well
[1:11:12] Christianity is then okay that I've got
[1:11:14] to produce this perfect life well
[1:11:17] there's been nobody on the face of the
[1:11:19] earth that's ever been able to produce a
[1:11:20] person for a perfect life but then you
[1:11:23] look at this thing now and you see that
[1:11:24] the plan of God was to have preeminence
[1:11:26] in Christ and then preeminence in his
[1:11:28] church and then bring us back to the
[1:11:30] beginning in the Garden of Eden which is
[1:11:31] what he intended well what does that
[1:11:33] have to do with me and how if I can't
[1:11:37] produce the life that that I see in the
[1:11:39] scripture and I think so many times we
[1:11:42] we look at the scripture and we look at
[1:11:45] the the profit we look at the message
[1:11:47] and we think that we do not see the
[1:11:50] realities of the promises of God
[1:11:52] manifesting in our life and right there
[1:11:55] a doubt is brought brought into our
[1:11:57] minds that we simply do not see and you
[1:11:59] might think that it is it comes across
[1:12:01] my mind so many times in a day that I
[1:12:05] just don't feel like the the promises
[1:12:07] are being manifested in my life that is
[1:12:09] nothing but a lie of the devil
[1:12:12] because it's not it's not the perfect
[1:12:14] life the that that you live on a fleshly
[1:12:18] basis that brings you into this kingdom
[1:12:21] or that had anything to do with the
[1:12:23] birth or had anything to do with this
[1:12:24] plan of God because it's flesh it's
[1:12:27] never born again and it has nothing to
[1:12:30] do with that and and because we live in
[1:12:33] the flesh and we we think in the flesh
[1:12:35] and we think with our mind and we
[1:12:36] maneuver around with our five senses we
[1:12:39] use the five senses to then approach the
[1:12:41] Word of God and it does nothing for us
[1:12:43] except give Satan an Avenue into our
[1:12:46] spirit to doubt the Word of God so you
[1:12:50] understand you you approach the Word of
[1:12:51] God with the five senses because that's
[1:12:53] how you approach everything in life and
[1:12:55] therefore the promises of God become
[1:12:57] void in your life simply because you're
[1:13:00] approaching it with something that can
[1:13:01] produce nothing the flesh profiteth
[1:13:03] nothing it is the spirit that quickeneth
[1:13:07] so that is why then that God had to give
[1:13:10] a human being a sixth sense for them to
[1:13:14] be able to approach Scripture with a
[1:13:16] gift from God that is not attained by
[1:13:19] fleshly means to approach the scripture
[1:13:22] with which then he could manifest
[1:13:24] something through us that is not by
[1:13:26] fleshly means and because the flesh fell
[1:13:28] and thereby he showed his attribute as a
[1:13:32] redeemer to redeem us back into that
[1:13:34] which was eternal so because we fell we
[1:13:39] then we have it fell into the the the
[1:13:41] flesh is what we did and then by that he
[1:13:45] gave us a he manifested himself in
[1:13:48] Christ as a redeemer to bring us back
[1:13:51] into it through the new birth to bring
[1:13:53] us back into the Word of God in an
[1:13:55] unadulterated way and then gave us a
[1:13:58] sixth sense to approach it with whereby
[1:14:01] he could manifest what he needed to
[1:14:03] manifest now let's explain
[1:14:09] there has to be a placement of faith
[1:14:14] there has to be a correct place where
[1:14:17] your faith is placed in now we see here
[1:14:22] that there was given to every man the
[1:14:26] measure the measure of faith so he was
[1:14:30] given something he was given a certain
[1:14:32] of just a little aspect of faith and he
[1:14:36] needed to accomplish what he was given
[1:14:38] to do and this is what Paul is saying
[1:14:39] and he stays talking about the gifts he
[1:14:41] says for through grace given unto me to
[1:14:43] every man among you don't think of
[1:14:46] yourself more highly than you ought to
[1:14:47] in other words and what I draw from that
[1:14:50] is and if you look at it in the context
[1:14:54] of our text he says don't think of
[1:14:57] yourself more highly than you ought to
[1:14:58] because what you do is then you use
[1:15:00] flesh and you use your ability to look
[1:15:02] at what you've been given the gift that
[1:15:04] you have been given and then you use
[1:15:06] flesh to think about it and then you eat
[1:15:08] and then it's my flesh that you approach
[1:15:10] the Word of God and the promises of God
[1:15:12] and that can do nothing to get you back
[1:15:15] into the stream of that that cycle that
[1:15:17] God has that threefold manifestation
[1:15:19] that God has the flesh can do nothing to
[1:15:22] get you into that so he says now there's
[1:15:27] a major of faith that you have been
[1:15:29] given to accomplish that which you have
[1:15:32] been given to accomplish so we see then
[1:15:35] now that if God has a purpose now of
[1:15:38] bringing us full cycle back to the plan
[1:15:40] of back to the Garden of Eden back to
[1:15:42] where it was where he walked in the cool
[1:15:43] of the evening back to what we really
[1:15:45] want to have then there had to be a way
[1:15:49] that you would have to get back into
[1:15:50] that and that's the promise of God that
[1:15:52] we were made more than conquerors we're
[1:15:54] a glorious stripped without spot or
[1:15:56] wrinkle the the direct manifestation of
[1:15:58] Christ into this earth giving God the
[1:16:02] preeminence in our lives and by the
[1:16:05] preeminence is he which he was express
[1:16:07] himself through his church and then by
[1:16:10] that bring them back to that place where
[1:16:11] they need to be so he gave us a promise
[1:16:14] then to be brought back to where we need
[1:16:16] to be so we have the promise and that
[1:16:18] promise was through a rapture that we
[1:16:21] would be we would go through the
[1:16:22] the season that a plant goes through so
[1:16:24] we'd have the church goes through seven
[1:16:26] ages where they're perfected and the
[1:16:28] plant grows in the stock comes in the
[1:16:30] seed buds and it's the the analogy is
[1:16:33] wheat a wheat plant and all through
[1:16:36] scripture he says a grain of wheat a
[1:16:37] corn of wheat a kernel of wheat a kernel
[1:16:40] of wheat and he used his wheat to say
[1:16:42] and to look at the life of a believer in
[1:16:46] the life of the church yes so then you
[1:16:48] see now it just fits so perfectly it's
[1:16:50] just you don't have you try and explain
[1:16:53] it you get a long messed up and man and
[1:16:55] and and I get it all messed up and you
[1:16:57] just it just it shouldn't be that way
[1:17:00] and it's just it's it's a plant that
[1:17:03] grows up and then the wheat at the last
[1:17:06] day it sits with its ripened in the Sun
[1:17:08] and it becomes the seed and it's got to
[1:17:10] just ripen a little bit then a farmer
[1:17:12] when he when he has a wheat field and
[1:17:14] it's ready its nearing harvest which
[1:17:16] were nearing harvest we're nearing that
[1:17:18] time where we're being brought back to
[1:17:19] now it was supposed to be so real close
[1:17:22] to that so that's to make you happy
[1:17:24] right anything should make you happy
[1:17:25] right so we've come you know full cycle
[1:17:28] now it's all happening now we're just
[1:17:30] right here at this moment he said but
[1:17:31] they just took the right pin a little
[1:17:32] bit so we're right there but the farmer
[1:17:36] would come out into the field and he'd
[1:17:37] pick a kernel of wheat and he'd press on
[1:17:39] it then if he couldn't make a dent in
[1:17:41] the seat it wasn't ready so nearing the
[1:17:43] harvest time the wheat now it would be
[1:17:45] seed again but it wasn't ripened yet so
[1:17:48] it just had delay in that August heat
[1:17:49] and that September heat I don't even
[1:17:51] know when weed is harvested but it had
[1:17:54] to lay in the in the in the atmosphere
[1:17:57] that was harsh
[1:17:58] and it was everything was dying and
[1:18:00] everything was going into the the winter
[1:18:02] cycle and everything was dying and then
[1:18:04] just fading out there which is the
[1:18:06] Seventh Seal everything just kind of
[1:18:08] fades out and fades out the fades out
[1:18:09] and the coming of the Lord right so
[1:18:12] we're in that season now and in the
[1:18:14] farmer would just come out and press on
[1:18:15] it well if he couldn't make a dent in it
[1:18:16] that it wasn't ready so he had to just
[1:18:17] go back and he'd watch TV and eat
[1:18:19] country fried steak and do whatever
[1:18:21] farmers do and then the next morning
[1:18:24] he'd come out I don't know a farmers do
[1:18:26] that but I just
[1:18:27] lord bless all the farmers among us
[1:18:30] and he'd come out in the field and he'd
[1:18:33] pushed on the wheat and if it wasn't
[1:18:35] ready he'd go back and do the same thing
[1:18:37] where the farmers do then he come out
[1:18:38] the next morning he'd push on it and
[1:18:40] that the see it just you couldn't make a
[1:18:42] dent in it because it wasn't right they
[1:18:44] were gonna seed it was wheat seed there
[1:18:46] was no doubt to the fact that it was
[1:18:48] seed that it produced exactly what went
[1:18:51] into the ground so what the seed that
[1:18:53] went into the ground
[1:18:54] he was now holding it in his hand he was
[1:18:56] it was definitely seed but it just
[1:18:58] wasn't ripened enough and just there was
[1:19:01] something not right so you just press on
[1:19:03] and then one day he'd come out and he
[1:19:05] presently make a dent he said fire up
[1:19:07] the combine boys we're ready and then
[1:19:09] they're come on come by and they'd
[1:19:10] harvest the seed and it would be done
[1:19:11] then they go to the gardeners well
[1:19:13] there's a little part of portion in
[1:19:14] between the gardener and the field and
[1:19:17] that's called the threshing floor and
[1:19:19] that's where I am now because that's
[1:19:20] when the wheat was beaten and everything
[1:19:22] was beaten in and then they throw it up
[1:19:24] in the air and all of the breeze would
[1:19:26] carry the stalk away everything that was
[1:19:27] not supposed to be there in the garner
[1:19:29] then it would just be original see the
[1:19:32] exact replica of what would not to be
[1:19:35] it's fascinating
[1:19:36] oh just in itself just in the natural
[1:19:38] type but it's the same with us and you
[1:19:41] can't beat your types and the quickest
[1:19:43] way to get complicated is to mess up
[1:19:45] your type the type is the seed and the
[1:19:48] natural birth so we have the natural
[1:19:50] birth and we have this thing so now the
[1:19:52] way that we get back and were right
[1:19:54] there now the way that we get back into
[1:19:56] that is through a sixth sense which
[1:19:58] carries us all the way through because
[1:20:00] the Prophet said that faith is the
[1:20:01] victory and scripture says in 11 of
[1:20:04] Hebrews 11:6 that you cannot please God
[1:20:07] without faith because you first must
[1:20:09] believe that he is you have to believe
[1:20:12] that he is God
[1:20:13] it's so simple you just simply have to
[1:20:16] believe that he is gone you believe that
[1:20:18] he is God and here's the reward of those
[1:20:21] who diligently seek Him this is the
[1:20:24] process of seeking Him alone God will
[1:20:26] reward if he if you believe that he is
[1:20:28] but you cannot please God without the
[1:20:31] faith needed to accomplish this task to
[1:20:33] get back to where he wanted us to be
[1:20:35] so therefore faith you see the
[1:20:37] importance of faith now
[1:20:39] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:20:42] for it is the evidence of things not
[1:20:44] seen so it is that thing that that is it
[1:20:47] is there that but yet it's not there so
[1:20:50] it's the evidence of things that are not
[1:20:51] seen it is it is something that is not
[1:20:54] flesh whatsoever there is nothing that
[1:20:58] you can do by human ability to attain
[1:21:00] faith they just simply can't do it try
[1:21:03] as we may we simply can't do it hey
[1:21:06] that's why it scripture says it is my
[1:21:08] grace that you are saved through faith
[1:21:10] it is a gift of God unless any man
[1:21:12] should boast which is what the Pharisees
[1:21:14] did because they were living the letter
[1:21:15] of the law and yet they were complete
[1:21:17] hypocrites because they were simply
[1:21:19] approaching God in a fleshly way they
[1:21:22] were not approaching God in the correct
[1:21:23] way and so then you can see from simply
[1:21:26] from the Pharisees life that when you
[1:21:27] approach the Word of God and the
[1:21:29] promises of God and I'm speaking about
[1:21:31] this threefold cycle what we want to do
[1:21:35] because so many times we get wrapped up
[1:21:37] with the with the things that we do
[1:21:38] wrong and I I don't ever try to preach
[1:21:41] to somebody you better stop cutting your
[1:21:43] hair or you better stop smoking I don't
[1:21:46] think I've ever told anybody you
[1:21:47] shouldn't smoke or you shouldn't cut
[1:21:49] your hair brother Branham said he was
[1:21:52] with the guy and the guy was smoking and
[1:21:53] the guy that I guess you're gonna tell
[1:21:55] me to quit smoking brother Graham said
[1:21:56] no I'm not gonna tell you quit smokin
[1:21:57] keep smoking
[1:21:58] they said I thought you were a Christian
[1:22:01] brother branham he said no I am a
[1:22:04] Christian well I have no right to tell
[1:22:06] you to stop smoking all I have to do is
[1:22:07] preach Christ to you and the life that
[1:22:09] is in Christ will actually take the
[1:22:10] desire out of you for smoking because if
[1:22:13] it's flesh that gets you out of smoking
[1:22:14] eventually someone will get right back
[1:22:16] into the the the need for nicotine that
[1:22:18] they left from and so it takes it's a
[1:22:20] horrible thing for someone it can quit
[1:22:22] smoking by natural means
[1:22:24] but it's only God that can completely
[1:22:26] take the desire of it
[1:22:28] and you you guys know that my dad knows
[1:22:31] that he is dead said he smoked
[1:22:33] everything that he could possibly smoke
[1:22:34] and then he said two weeks after he was
[1:22:37] baptized he reached his hand in his
[1:22:39] pockets and he pulled the cigarettes out
[1:22:40] and they realized I used to smoke there
[1:22:43] was something that was taken out of him
[1:22:45] that flesh could never have taken out of
[1:22:47] it so you see it's it's when you
[1:22:51] approach the word of God and you say I
[1:22:52] want to do this and I want to believe
[1:22:54] this and I want to do this then
[1:22:56] eventually you're going to get right
[1:22:57] back to the same spot and say I wanted
[1:23:00] to do this but I can't do it and then
[1:23:01] you're going to get right back to the
[1:23:02] same spot and Satan will be right there
[1:23:03] on your shoulder every single time to
[1:23:06] produce fear in your spirit realm and
[1:23:08] then pretty soon you're gonna allow him
[1:23:10] to stronghold and then all kinds of
[1:23:12] things will start coming into your life
[1:23:13] and lust and cheating and all these kind
[1:23:16] of things the desire to do those things
[1:23:18] but when you're when you're birthed into
[1:23:21] Christ you're made a new creation you're
[1:23:23] sealed into Christ the Spirit which is
[1:23:26] the only part of a man that is eternal
[1:23:28] that was in Christ at the beginning so
[1:23:31] your flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:23:33] so Christ took the very part of him
[1:23:35] himself out and placed it in the spirit
[1:23:38] realm in in the soul in the soul of a
[1:23:41] man and so it's not me that has anything
[1:23:44] to do with it it was the very nature and
[1:23:46] flesh and bone of Christ that was placed
[1:23:48] into my soul
[1:23:50] so if it be the very nature and flesh of
[1:23:52] his flesh and bone of his bone then
[1:23:55] there's nothing that flesh has to do
[1:23:57] with it
[1:23:57] it's simply the life of Christ that is
[1:23:59] in me so I simply need to then approach
[1:24:03] God in the correct way that is spirit
[1:24:05] which this the word is the seed then
[1:24:08] that that's the word that's that's
[1:24:09] inside of you because Christ in the word
[1:24:11] are the same thing so if it's Christ
[1:24:12] then that's inside of you that very
[1:24:14] nature of his nature the flesh of his
[1:24:16] flesh the bone of his bone and he
[1:24:17] predestinated to be in you before the
[1:24:20] foundation of the world if that be truth
[1:24:22] and that be inside of your soul then the
[1:24:25] water is the Holy Spirit so if you have
[1:24:28] the word because Christ in the word are
[1:24:29] the same thing and you're made that very
[1:24:31] part of you that is predestinated to be
[1:24:33] there which is sealed into Christ it is
[1:24:35] the very nature of then that since the
[1:24:37] word if that is if that be in your soul
[1:24:39] then the water that comes down which is
[1:24:41] the Holy Spirit it presses through the
[1:24:44] native the seed the outside of that seed
[1:24:46] and it bring forth life and so it's the
[1:24:49] water it's merely presenting yourself
[1:24:51] and then placing yourself into the right
[1:24:53] atmosphere so that the seed that is in
[1:24:56] you can bring forth the life it is not
[1:24:57] the flesh that brings forth the life and
[1:24:59] keeps the life there it is Christ that
[1:25:01] keeps you because it was his very nature
[1:25:04] that is in you and it is his very spirit
[1:25:06] that brings that nature out so you think
[1:25:09] oh I need to stop smoking and I need to
[1:25:12] stop doing this I really I don't I don't
[1:25:14] care if you smoke all I want to do is
[1:25:15] preach Christ to you because the life of
[1:25:18] Christ is what will reach down into that
[1:25:19] soul which is what my flesh and my words
[1:25:21] could never do for you so I could preach
[1:25:24] to you Tom blue in the face but it's not
[1:25:26] gonna do a thing for you you keep living
[1:25:28] like you're living if you want to cut
[1:25:29] your hair you keep cutting your hair but
[1:25:31] I am going to preach the word because I
[1:25:33] happen to have something inside of me
[1:25:34] that is sealed into Christ that I know
[1:25:36] that the word is truth so if I preach it
[1:25:39] then we create an atmosphere and he says
[1:25:41] if two or three gather in my name I will
[1:25:43] be with them then that creates an
[1:25:45] atmosphere white whereby his spirit can
[1:25:46] come down and anoint the seed that is
[1:25:48] within you and therefore this the
[1:25:50] desires are just they drop they just
[1:25:53] completely drop often and that's what
[1:25:56] produces a birth there is no creature on
[1:25:58] the face of the earth that can make a
[1:25:59] man stop smoking he can prevent
[1:26:04] from smoking but there's always that
[1:26:06] aspect in his heart that desires to
[1:26:08] smoke because it gets into the very
[1:26:10] chemicals of his brain and messes with
[1:26:12] it so there's always that desire to
[1:26:14] smoke a preacher can never take that
[1:26:16] away only Christ could take that away
[1:26:19] and because he chose to smoke the
[1:26:21] effects of which will always be in his
[1:26:23] natural body
[1:26:24] he might have lung problem he might have
[1:26:26] many different things because he chose
[1:26:28] to smoke and he made the mistake but
[1:26:30] it's only Christ who could take the
[1:26:32] desire away and then heal his body if he
[1:26:34] would so choose so this brings us to a
[1:26:40] place now where you see that you have a
[1:26:42] portion of faith that is given to you
[1:26:44] and what I want you to understand this
[1:26:46] morning is that once fear is out of the
[1:26:49] equation the wrong kind of fear then you
[1:26:51] with reverence and respect approach God
[1:26:54] in a certain way and that gives God the
[1:26:56] opportunity to come in and work and then
[1:26:59] faith can take a hold but what the thing
[1:27:02] about it is is that he has given to you
[1:27:04] the exact amount of faith that you need
[1:27:07] to accomplish what he has given you to
[1:27:09] accomplish so brother Brandon had a
[1:27:11] certain amount of faith to allow him to
[1:27:13] do the things that he did and I have a
[1:27:16] certain amount of faith that God
[1:27:18] predestinated in me and gives me a
[1:27:19] measure for when it is quickened and
[1:27:22] when fears out of the equation the Holy
[1:27:24] Spirit can come down and buy that seed
[1:27:26] that was in me when I was birthed into
[1:27:28] Christ that Holy Spirit comes down and
[1:27:31] bubbles up from the inside and what I do
[1:27:34] is I place that that part of me that was
[1:27:36] eternal and I placed my faith in his
[1:27:40] hands and then hid by his spirit and by
[1:27:44] that word that was already in me he
[1:27:45] produces that which I need to produce
[1:27:48] and the problem is is that Steven coffee
[1:27:51] gets in the way and messes it up but as
[1:27:54] long as I am going back to that place
[1:27:56] where I know that he can manifest in me
[1:27:58] what he needs and I constantly daily
[1:28:01] died to myself my flesh which is never
[1:28:04] born again and I placed myself on the
[1:28:07] basis of the Word of God and say Lord
[1:28:09] this is the Word of God I believe it's
[1:28:12] true and if you are really a Living God
[1:28:15] then I believe
[1:28:17] you can manifest this word in me and all
[1:28:20] you do as the scripture says to wait
[1:28:22] upon the Lord and he shall renew your
[1:28:24] strength you shall mount up with wings
[1:28:26] like eagles if you wait upon the Lord
[1:28:29] all you do is you don't simply try to
[1:28:30] meddle with it and produce it in
[1:28:32] yourself you simply lay in the presence
[1:28:35] of the Sun and he ripened you because
[1:28:38] you are basing your faith on the basis
[1:28:41] of the word and not on a fleshly desire
[1:28:44] to accomplish it by the letter of the
[1:28:46] law that is how a life of God is
[1:28:49] produced is you place yourself and you
[1:28:52] place that part of you that was eternal
[1:28:54] onto the basis of the word and the Holy
[1:28:56] Spirit which is the water comes and he
[1:28:59] brings the life out of that seed but he
[1:29:03] has given you the exact measure of faith
[1:29:05] that you need to be brought fullcycle
[1:29:08] back to this spot back to what it was in
[1:29:10] the Garden of Eden so don't worry that
[1:29:12] you're not going to be ending up here
[1:29:14] exactly like God wants you because he
[1:29:16] had an image of what he wants you to be
[1:29:18] like that's his job not yours to stop
[1:29:21] worrying about that and just place
[1:29:23] yourself in the right atmosphere and
[1:29:25] place and base your faith on the basis
[1:29:28] of the word so that he can bring you
[1:29:30] back full cycle to what he wants you to
[1:29:32] be it's his job in the first place it's
[1:29:35] not yours so submit yourself to him and
[1:29:38] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[1:29:40] God that he might exalt you in due time
[1:29:44] it's nothing that you could do you
[1:29:47] simply place yourself in his basis and
[1:29:49] if he be a living God then put him to
[1:29:51] the test if he can do it then then by
[1:29:54] George let him do it and don't dare try
[1:29:58] to tell me that he can because I had a
[1:30:02] disease that nobody understands I had
[1:30:04] Lyme disease nobody could understand it
[1:30:06] it's weird disease it's weird it's
[1:30:09] cracked it's just weird
[1:30:11] nobody understands it and you say oh
[1:30:13] that's that's impossible
[1:30:15] we understand the disease nobody
[1:30:17] understands blind disease they approach
[1:30:19] it and they know how to treat it and
[1:30:20] they know how to do this but they don't
[1:30:22] fully understand it and I had it but
[1:30:25] what what I did was is that I knew that
[1:30:27] I had this disease then I had this
[1:30:28] sickness and it was brutal it was just
[1:30:30] brutal because it just messes with a
[1:30:32] bunch of different things and it's not
[1:30:34] as bad as other diseases but it can be
[1:30:36] brutal and for me it just made me sick
[1:30:38] and I just annoying you know and a
[1:30:40] sickness is an interruption in the
[1:30:43] perfect plan of God that's what it is so
[1:30:46] he I had this disease and what I did was
[1:30:49] I knew that the Bible said if you lay
[1:30:51] hands on the sick they shall recover and
[1:30:53] I also knew that he said that God said I
[1:30:56] am the Lord that healeth all our
[1:30:57] diseases so it's either true or it's not
[1:31:00] and you know I don't really have to do
[1:31:03] anything for God to prove his own word
[1:31:05] God interprets and proof says don't work
[1:31:06] it's God God proves his own word you
[1:31:08] don't have to do anything about it if
[1:31:10] you don't believe it don't believe it
[1:31:11] you'll answer for it
[1:31:12] God will prove his own word so I merely
[1:31:16] took just just a tiny bit of faith
[1:31:19] because I'm nobody special I'm an
[1:31:20] ordinary man just like the scripture
[1:31:21] said that Noah was an ordinary man I'm
[1:31:25] just you know I'm just a regular guy
[1:31:27] there's nothing special in me you have
[1:31:28] to realize that just because this
[1:31:29] happened to me doesn't mean that I'm any
[1:31:31] more special than you it just simply
[1:31:32] means that I know it works and you can
[1:31:34] see that it worked too because I did it
[1:31:36] so I nearly took the little measure of
[1:31:40] faith that God gave to me which he says
[1:31:42] he will do and he says he has given to
[1:31:43] you which is by grace so therefore
[1:31:45] you're not ought to think highly of
[1:31:47] yourself so he gave me that little
[1:31:49] measure of faith and what I did is I
[1:31:51] said Lord if you be a living God and if
[1:31:54] you
[1:31:54] really be the same yesterday and today
[1:31:56] and forever then I believe the scripture
[1:32:00] and I place myself on the basis of the
[1:32:03] word and I say if you lay hands on the
[1:32:04] sick they shall recover and you said you
[1:32:07] are the Lord that heals all of your
[1:32:09] diseases the ones they don't really
[1:32:11] understand and the ones they do so
[1:32:13] therefore I place myself and I went up
[1:32:14] and got paid for and the brother prayed
[1:32:16] for me was brother Sean Martin and dad
[1:32:18] and another brother brother Josh Bennett
[1:32:19] in North Carolina and they all over
[1:32:23] there and they prayed for me and I was
[1:32:27] healed right there on the spot now that
[1:32:29] happened to me before because I had
[1:32:30] really bad food allergies I was allergic
[1:32:32] to corn wheat dairy and corn wheat dairy
[1:32:36] and some kind of a fit some kind of a
[1:32:42] fish and some kind of a meat and it
[1:32:44] would cause me to have really bad
[1:32:45] migraine headaches if you've never had
[1:32:46] migraine headaches then don't presume
[1:32:48] you know what they feel like because
[1:32:49] someone who has had migraine headaches
[1:32:51] knows what they feel like excruciating
[1:32:53] and I was healed when I was thirteen
[1:32:55] from that and that's also when I gave my
[1:32:57] heart to the Lord and I was healed it's
[1:32:58] at the same time so I know that he could
[1:33:01] have done it so I had faith enough to
[1:33:02] present myself to God on the basis of
[1:33:05] his word and He healed me on the spot
[1:33:07] and I don't have Lyme disease anymore
[1:33:10] others right there's you know effects on
[1:33:12] your body that has obviously you know
[1:33:14] from even from the medication as effects
[1:33:15] from the body and I have but I don't
[1:33:18] have lyme disease anymore man and i went
[1:33:20] back to the doctor i said check me check
[1:33:23] me because if god is real then i'm not
[1:33:26] afraid
[1:33:27] if lyme disease shows back up on your
[1:33:29] test because it's not me who took it
[1:33:31] away it's not me who's gonna heal me
[1:33:33] it's God so God can prove it he helped
[1:33:35] prove himself do you test me again is so
[1:33:37] actually it and it wasn't what I
[1:33:39] expected because nothing in life is
[1:33:40] really as you expected and she said why
[1:33:44] I can't test it I can't test it the same
[1:33:46] because Lyme disease won't it won't
[1:33:47] react to the same because the medication
[1:33:49] has changed it's probably you did it now
[1:33:51] so you won't be able to see it but she
[1:33:53] said but if you really believe that then
[1:33:55] let's let's take you off all the
[1:33:56] medication so I said take me off all the
[1:33:58] medication so if I went back now I've
[1:34:00] got a blood test there wouldn't be one
[1:34:02] ounce of Lyme disease in my body in Lyme
[1:34:04] disease always sticks with you
[1:34:06] it says it will never leave you it'll
[1:34:08] always stick with you and I was healed
[1:34:10] right there on the spot and I don't have
[1:34:12] Lyme disease anymore and I don't have
[1:34:14] food allergies at all and I haven't had
[1:34:16] a migraine headache since I was 13 years
[1:34:18] old since I got prayed for at the moment
[1:34:20] I got prayed for I haven't had one
[1:34:22] single migraine headaches now what that
[1:34:24] is I'm thankful for that I'm really
[1:34:27] thankful for that well what that was is
[1:34:30] that there's no doctor who could ever
[1:34:31] have healed my food out of these
[1:34:33] functions and taking that away not one
[1:34:35] not one on the face of the earth and I
[1:34:38] eat all of that kind of stuff in
[1:34:39] multitude and I don't get migraine
[1:34:42] headaches anymore so God healed me from
[1:34:44] that and what that was was simply my
[1:34:47] faith being placed on the basis of the
[1:34:49] word and God had then heaven and he had
[1:34:52] an avenue to come and do the work
[1:34:55] through me because I gave my measure of
[1:34:57] faith into his hands it wasn't me
[1:35:01] because I knew that there was nothing
[1:35:02] that I had to do I simply had to
[1:35:03] surrender and present myself into his
[1:35:05] hands and he did the work it's the same
[1:35:07] with the birth it's the same if you've
[1:35:09] been in the message or you've been
[1:35:10] birthed for 30 years or a hundred years
[1:35:12] it's the same if you're struggling with
[1:35:14] something or you're just starting or you
[1:35:16] just want to you want to give your heart
[1:35:17] to the God you have given your heart to
[1:35:19] God you're nearing your life to ending
[1:35:21] your you know is it's the same all the
[1:35:24] way through all you simply do is present
[1:35:26] your measure of faith into his hands and
[1:35:28] he does the work and I am a testimony to
[1:35:32] the fact that he will do it because he
[1:35:34] is a Living God so don't try to tell me
[1:35:36] that he's not living and don't try to
[1:35:38] tell me that he can fulfill his promises
[1:35:41] because I am a living testimony to the
[1:35:43] fact that he will you cannot convince me
[1:35:48] that he won't do it
[1:35:49] I know he can because he's proven it to
[1:35:52] me he proved it to me simply because I
[1:35:55] gave what little tiny faith an ordinary
[1:35:57] guy has there's nothing special and I
[1:36:00] gave it to him and he did the the he
[1:36:02] fulfilled the promise of his word
[1:36:04] through his spirit it wasn't flesh it
[1:36:08] was just me giving it myself to him
[1:36:11] it was the same when the little boy came
[1:36:13] up to us and they were had the great
[1:36:15] multitudes and Jesus was just sitting
[1:36:16] there preaching you know and all the
[1:36:17] disciples are how you gonna feed all
[1:36:19] these people because they're coming you
[1:36:20] know that we can't afford search potluck
[1:36:22] like this so we're gonna have to do
[1:36:24] something because we can't feed all
[1:36:25] these people they're poor and can't
[1:36:26] afford anything what are we gonna do so
[1:36:29] there's a little kid sitting over there
[1:36:30] you know scrawny little kid sitting over
[1:36:32] the corner and he had a little lunch
[1:36:34] which his mother faithfully had packed
[1:36:36] for him and he had you know a few fishes
[1:36:38] and few clothes few fish and loaves of
[1:36:42] bread and he was just sitting there you
[1:36:45] know and either this the story is true
[1:36:48] or it's not either you believe it but
[1:36:49] it's not when I'm a testimony to the
[1:36:51] fact that he can take what you give into
[1:36:53] his hands and fulfill this promise
[1:36:55] through hey I know it's true I believe
[1:36:57] so the child came up and he gave he said
[1:37:01] can we use your fish he said just bring
[1:37:02] bring bring what you've got bring what
[1:37:04] you've got and place it in here before
[1:37:06] me so you see now the key you have to
[1:37:10] bring what you've got and lay it before
[1:37:13] so you don't have to have this big faith
[1:37:15] to move mountains and everything and say
[1:37:16] oh I I don't bring my perfect my perfect
[1:37:19] life before you because none of us have
[1:37:21] that to give you simply bring what you
[1:37:24] got and if God placed something there
[1:37:26] before the foundation of the world
[1:37:28] you've got something all you have to do
[1:37:31] is bring that the measure of faith which
[1:37:34] he has given you and now place it in the
[1:37:37] right place so all he did know is he
[1:37:38] came they placed it in the hands of
[1:37:40] Jesus and Jesus all of a sudden this and
[1:37:44] then there's the fish and most feed an
[1:37:47] army and so all he did now is take just
[1:37:50] a little few fishes and loaves and then
[1:37:53] God multiplied it and produce something
[1:37:54] out of nothing simply because he had
[1:37:57] something to work with
[1:37:59] you see it you see how it worked he gave
[1:38:02] what he had into the hands of Jesus and
[1:38:04] that's what did the work it was Jesus
[1:38:07] who did the work not not the child he
[1:38:09] simply gave what he had into the hands
[1:38:11] of Jesus and be not afraid 1963 the
[1:38:15] Prophet says now the little boy that
[1:38:16] little lunch that he had wasn't very
[1:38:18] much in his hands but when he let what
[1:38:20] he had go into Jesus hands the fed
[1:38:23] thousands you say well I wish they had
[1:38:26] great faith but what little faith you've
[1:38:28] got you've got faith enough to come to
[1:38:31] church and then if you've got faith that
[1:38:33] much faith why don't you just give it
[1:38:35] over into the hands of Jesus and it'll
[1:38:38] feed thousands if you it's not much in
[1:38:41] your hands but once placed in his hands
[1:38:44] then it'll do miracles if you just let
[1:38:47] what faith you've got into his hands so
[1:38:51] you understand you say oh now faith can
[1:38:53] take a hold because all the fear is out
[1:38:55] of my life and with reverence I approach
[1:38:57] God you think oh that all that uh then
[1:38:59] now that I've got the faith then now I
[1:39:01] can start walking and in a second Peter
[1:39:04] the first chapter he says add to your
[1:39:06] faith virtue add to this there is a
[1:39:08] process that you go through to add to
[1:39:11] your faith but faith is the foundation
[1:39:13] so yes there are things that you can
[1:39:15] attain because there is a difference
[1:39:17] between what you can attain and what you
[1:39:19] inherit and that part of you that was
[1:39:21] inside of you is what your inherent
[1:39:23] because it's God who put that in you and
[1:39:25] you get it regardless because it's
[1:39:27] healing who put it within you but there
[1:39:29] are things that you can attain unto and
[1:39:32] there's a difference between what you've
[1:39:34] inherited that lays within you and
[1:39:36] there's a difference between what you
[1:39:38] can attain that's why he rebuked the
[1:39:40] servant who took his talent and put it
[1:39:42] in the ground and it achieved nothing he
[1:39:45] had a talent you know the money he had
[1:39:47] that neat piece of money but he put it
[1:39:49] in the ground and did nothing with it
[1:39:50] and he rebuked the servant and said
[1:39:52] that's unfaithful why would you have
[1:39:55] done that but the servant who went out
[1:39:57] and did something with what he was given
[1:39:59] he attained unto more and doubled it you
[1:40:03] simply have what you give what you have
[1:40:05] into the hands of Jesus and he'll feed
[1:40:08] thousands and I don't believe that this
[1:40:10] is Jesus of Nazareth because that was
[1:40:13] God's redemptive act you give what you
[1:40:15] have into the hands of Christ which is
[1:40:17] the very manifestation of God the logos
[1:40:20] which is the life of God you place what
[1:40:23] you have in that and it's on the basis
[1:40:27] of his word because Christ and the word
[1:40:29] are the same thing so when you take what
[1:40:32] you've got and you say Lord I know that
[1:40:35] I can be born again I know that I can
[1:40:38] have the Holy Ghost I know that I can
[1:40:40] live these things it might not be for
[1:40:42] the next 40 years but I'm not I'm not
[1:40:45] gonna have anything to do with the world
[1:40:46] I'm gonna try to I'm just gonna try to
[1:40:48] focus myself on this and yes I'm gonna
[1:40:51] slip up but I'm gonna focus myself and
[1:40:53] die daily and come back to this and come
[1:40:56] back to it and come back to it because I
[1:40:58] know that that is the fountain which
[1:40:59] with that drama strength from man so
[1:41:02] it's the daily life and now you can
[1:41:04] bring in the aspect of the daily
[1:41:06] struggles that we go through it's the
[1:41:07] daily life that you come back to this
[1:41:09] basis and then you build on the basis
[1:41:12] and you grow in faith and your faith
[1:41:14] begins to grow just as the seed grows
[1:41:17] but he said you have to you have to come
[1:41:20] in Luke 17 Jesus was sitting with the
[1:41:22] disciples and they were just talking
[1:41:23] back and forth I think they were talking
[1:41:25] about forgiveness and forgiving one
[1:41:27] another and one of the disciples leaned
[1:41:29] up and he said Lord increase our faith
[1:41:31] and it was the Greek is pissed off
[1:41:33] pissed ease which is um gonna written
[1:41:39] out the Greek word and he says increase
[1:41:42] our faith don't don't let us be a void
[1:41:47] of it
[1:41:51] he says uh faith this Greek word means
[1:41:55] belief and Trust confidence and devotion
[1:41:58] and faithfulness and this disciples said
[1:42:01] Lord increase our faith they increase my
[1:42:04] trust in you increase our confidence in
[1:42:07] you he said and he turned around he said
[1:42:11] all you need is the grain of a mustard
[1:42:14] seed that's that's all you need to start
[1:42:17] anytime you're good just the little
[1:42:18] measure that he has given you however
[1:42:20] big it is however small it may be he
[1:42:23] said just the little measure that's all
[1:42:24] I need and as a grain of a mustard seed
[1:42:27] goes into the ground it's the smallest
[1:42:28] seed that you could imagine you barely
[1:42:30] see it in your hand and yet it produces
[1:42:32] this big plant this big thing and he
[1:42:35] said that's all you need
[1:42:36] just give it the right atmosphere let
[1:42:40] the water come over it let the ground
[1:42:42] grab a hold of it let the foundation
[1:42:45] grab a hold of it let the water come
[1:42:46] over it and it'll produce something that
[1:42:48] you couldn't imagine because it's not
[1:42:50] flesh it's me you just have to give it
[1:42:55] back to me and it will produce what you
[1:42:58] want to produce the problem is is that
[1:43:02] you have the seed and you have that
[1:43:03] little measure and then you bring it
[1:43:04] back and then you slip it up and you're
[1:43:06] doing all these things and you're doing
[1:43:07] all these things and Satan then all of a
[1:43:09] sudden gets the avenues into the spirit
[1:43:11] ground because he has five of them and
[1:43:12] he gets into those spirit realms and
[1:43:14] then you're all of a sudden losing your
[1:43:15] focus and then you're all over the place
[1:43:17] then all of a sudden you're letting
[1:43:18] things come into your life that a
[1:43:19] believer should have nothing to do with
[1:43:22] that is not godly it's not holy and then
[1:43:26] you're allowing all these things in your
[1:43:27] life in your wonder oh why can't I ever
[1:43:29] do this and everything like that
[1:43:31] are you coming back onto the basis of
[1:43:33] the word and placing what you have into
[1:43:35] these hands because either the scripture
[1:43:38] is true or it is not you let God prove
[1:43:42] his own word there's nothing that I
[1:43:44] could preach to you to say I do this
[1:43:46] five step process and you'll have this
[1:43:47] yeah you simply have to give it to
[1:43:49] Christ and he does the work
[1:43:51] but I know that he can I know that he
[1:43:55] can if you have faith that as a grain of
[1:44:00] a mustard seed you might say to this
[1:44:02] sycamore tree bit get the plucked up by
[1:44:05] the root and be planted into the sea and
[1:44:08] it should obey you wish yeah yeah we you
[1:44:16] know anybody picked up a sycamore tree
[1:44:19] lately you know and we think in fleshly
[1:44:22] terms I then you go to the nearest tree
[1:44:28] and you're just kind of looking at it
[1:44:29] yeah you know you're trying to get to
[1:44:33] move and you understand how quickly your
[1:44:37] flesh just responds to what the word
[1:44:39] says
[1:44:40] there's nobody my fleshly means who
[1:44:43] could by word alone pick up the sycamore
[1:44:45] tree except the manager of a tree
[1:44:47] company but that's another subject
[1:44:48] altogether there's nobody by word alone
[1:44:50] who could say pick this tree up and be
[1:44:53] planted at sea and it would obey you you
[1:44:57] tell me one one person on the face of
[1:44:59] the earth who could do that by fleshly
[1:45:01] means you understand now then it cuts
[1:45:04] out all fleshly means you understand how
[1:45:06] very little you have to do with it but
[1:45:09] what little faith you have he said just
[1:45:13] give it into the hands but given into
[1:45:14] Christ's hands and it will be like the
[1:45:17] grain of a mustard seed they will
[1:45:18] produce as much as it will allow you to
[1:45:20] say to a sycamore tree be thou picked up
[1:45:23] and bigger planted in the sea let God
[1:45:27] prove his own Word in your life
[1:45:28] don't try to produce it yourself just
[1:45:30] like God do it either he's living or
[1:45:32] it's not put him to the test he's
[1:45:35] willing and able to prove himself in
[1:45:37] your life give him half a chance
[1:45:42] don't tell me it's not possible in James
[1:45:46] and in Romans we see Paul explaining
[1:45:49] faith and then we see James explaining
[1:45:51] faith in James he says you see how that
[1:45:54] by works a man is justified and not by
[1:45:56] faith only in Romans 4:3 for what man
[1:46:00] say it scripture abraham believed god
[1:46:02] and it was counted to him for
[1:46:03] righteousness he had faith and it was
[1:46:05] counted to him and james said it was by
[1:46:06] his works that he was kind of done to
[1:46:08] righteousness so you see no they can't
[1:46:10] contradict each other
[1:46:11] but what james was looking at was the
[1:46:14] fleshly the fleshly side of it the works
[1:46:17] that abraham had produced which faith it
[1:46:20] works is faith expressed so james was
[1:46:25] looking simply by what a pretend was
[1:46:27] producing to see what was on the inside
[1:46:29] that's why solomon said let a man
[1:46:31] examine him own self to see what food is
[1:46:34] he is producing because your character
[1:46:36] is shown when you're alone the things
[1:46:37] that you are thinking when you're alone
[1:46:38] that's what your character really is
[1:46:40] it's not what you're showing me because
[1:46:42] you can fool me hey everyone lincoln
[1:46:44] said you could fool everybody some of
[1:46:46] the time you can fool some people some
[1:46:48] of the time you can't fool everybody all
[1:46:50] the time and you'll never be able to for
[1:46:52] yourself and definitely not go and james
[1:46:55] was saying the works is what proof that
[1:46:57] works on the outside the manifestation
[1:47:00] what he was producing showed what was on
[1:47:02] the inside what faith he had but paul
[1:47:04] was saying now but God looks at the
[1:47:07] heart of the main and Paul was saying it
[1:47:09] was his faith that God looked at and
[1:47:11] that's what God that's what God gave him
[1:47:13] so man looks on the outside what God
[1:47:16] looks on the inside so how do you know
[1:47:18] how God sees you well actually you're
[1:47:20] gonna filter know how to look at
[1:47:23] yourself through God because it was the
[1:47:25] three-fold purpose that in Christ you
[1:47:27] should have all the preeminence --is and
[1:47:29] that she should bring our glorious
[1:47:31] church back to him then self cautions 1
[1:47:33] in Ephesians 5:25 and then by that bring
[1:47:35] us back right to where he was in the
[1:47:37] Garden of Eden so we see the threefold
[1:47:39] purpose of God so let that be your
[1:47:42] filter if anything because he who said
[1:47:45] he who gave the promise that we would be
[1:47:47] brought back to that is the one who has
[1:47:50] the ability to place in your the measure
[1:47:52] of faith by which you give it back
[1:47:54] into his hands and he does the work to
[1:47:57] bring you back to where you need to be
[1:47:59] so you simply give your what little
[1:48:02] portion of faith you have into his hand
[1:48:04] and he will bring it back because he
[1:48:06] looks at the heart of a man a man looks
[1:48:08] on the outside so James was looking at
[1:48:10] the works and it is true because faith
[1:48:12] without the works is dead
[1:48:15] you're producing foolish things and
[1:48:17] you're doing these same things then
[1:48:18] something isn't right there's something
[1:48:20] not matching up but if you're if you're
[1:48:22] and you'll never be free from mistakes
[1:48:23] because your flesh is not born again but
[1:48:26] if you're producing the thing and
[1:48:27] growing in the Word of God and God is
[1:48:30] giving you and bringing you closer to
[1:48:31] him and bringing you step-by-step closer
[1:48:34] to him then you can see the
[1:48:35] manifestation of Christ
[1:48:39] simply because he has the preeminence in
[1:48:41] this in your life and you do what that
[1:48:43] by giving the wrong kind of fear out and
[1:48:45] reverence in God in the correct fear and
[1:48:48] faith takes a hold and faith is the
[1:48:51] victory that's how simple it is it just
[1:48:54] fits together so perfectly there's no
[1:48:57] contradiction in sin Scripture the
[1:49:01] measure of faith that you have you give
[1:49:03] it back into his hands now brother
[1:49:04] Branham says he says and so when a man
[1:49:08] lives by faith and walks by faith
[1:49:10] because we are to walk in the light as
[1:49:12] he is in the light so you walk in the
[1:49:15] word you walk in the in the message that
[1:49:17] we have which points us back to Christ
[1:49:19] the message is Jesus Christ the message
[1:49:22] is not a book of rules or a formality
[1:49:25] that we believe on the basis of
[1:49:27] fundamentalism it's not a thing that we
[1:49:32] do just on the basis of fundamentalism
[1:49:34] although fundamentalism is important to
[1:49:36] God and the message merely through the
[1:49:39] Prophet in our last day walking in the
[1:49:41] light simply pointed us back to Christ
[1:49:44] so when we go back to Christ oh then we
[1:49:47] all of a sudden have the Mechanics for
[1:49:49] the seed torque but what the domination
[1:49:52] which church has done is that they've
[1:49:53] approached the Word of God in a fleshly
[1:49:55] way and said I don't add that the truth
[1:49:58] then they produce the Trinity doctrine
[1:50:00] out of simply flesh it's just a bunch of
[1:50:02] guys at the Nicean council getting
[1:50:03] together and debating what the Word of
[1:50:05] God was and they didn't even have up
[1:50:06] I want to do it with and you think
[1:50:09] they're gonna produce something godly
[1:50:10] and look at the seed of it you have the
[1:50:13] denominational churches acting exactly
[1:50:14] like the world there's no difference in
[1:50:16] the world is completely unholy because
[1:50:18] it's controlled by Satan so you can see
[1:50:21] the root of it that's the manifestation
[1:50:22] of it that is the the work of their
[1:50:25] faith it was placed on a human means but
[1:50:28] what brother branham did is he didn't
[1:50:30] provide a rulebook and he didn't say
[1:50:31] quit smoking Lola he said come to Christ
[1:50:34] and he did preach you know pretty hard
[1:50:37] but he said come to Christ and when he
[1:50:39] pointed the bride back to Christ
[1:50:41] then the mechanics are all of a sudden
[1:50:43] mixed up with the dynamics and now all
[1:50:46] of a sudden we can produce the very
[1:50:48] nature of Christ the seed which was to
[1:50:51] be reproduced in the last stage just as
[1:50:54] it was in Christ when he was on earth do
[1:50:59] you see he pointed us back to the right
[1:51:00] place where we present our our little
[1:51:02] measure of faith in the Christ hang and
[1:51:04] then it produces in us what we need to
[1:51:07] be four doable what we need to have to
[1:51:09] get us back to where God wants us to be
[1:51:13] he says when you live and walk by faith
[1:51:16] I mean substance faith he is isolated
[1:51:21] from the entire world and becomes a new
[1:51:22] creature in Christ there now you're
[1:51:25] getting into a bride material see
[1:51:27] they're getting into rapturing condition
[1:51:30] now he says when a man lives by faith
[1:51:32] and walks by faith substance faith
[1:51:35] isolated from the world and becomes a
[1:51:38] new creature in Christ you're getting
[1:51:39] into bride material said you're getting
[1:51:42] into rapturing condition which is what
[1:51:43] we need to be in because we're right
[1:51:44] here at the rapture right here at the
[1:51:46] time when we're gonna be brought back
[1:51:47] all the sudden to the place which has to
[1:51:48] be he says that means for the laity
[1:51:51] every individual walks in a world with
[1:51:54] God alone you're baptized into this
[1:51:57] kingdom and there's nobody in there but
[1:52:00] you and God see it's God in the
[1:52:02] individual it's not you been baptized
[1:52:04] into the church it's not you baptizing
[1:52:05] into dear old lunch it's not you
[1:52:07] baptized into very coffee or you
[1:52:09] baptized into in the Steven coffee it's
[1:52:10] you baptized into Christ and see
[1:52:13] digital walk human-caused yeah not that
[1:52:16] ties into the message the message
[1:52:18] pointed you back to Christ so that it
[1:52:20] would be an individual walk so that
[1:52:21] would wake up so it and there's nobody
[1:52:26] in there but you and God he gives you
[1:52:27] orders and you pack them out whatever he
[1:52:30] says there's not a shadow of doubt
[1:52:31] nowhere which fear is down
[1:52:34] he said there's not a shadow of fear
[1:52:36] anyway you walk right on and if the Lord
[1:52:40] says this there's nobody in the world
[1:52:42] can talk you out of it there's nobody in
[1:52:44] the world that can tell me that God
[1:52:46] cannot heal because he has proved it and
[1:52:48] I see the works of it in my life he has
[1:52:52] proven to me his own word you can't tell
[1:52:55] me that he won't heal you I can pray for
[1:52:58] you with confidence that he will heal
[1:53:00] you because I know that he will because
[1:53:03] he did it for me and he's the same God
[1:53:05] the yesterday today and forever and he
[1:53:07] does not change as his word says so
[1:53:12] nobody in the world that can talk you
[1:53:14] out of it you go right on just the same
[1:53:15] now you're coming into perfect faith
[1:53:17] perfect faith brother Branham explained
[1:53:19] it is the faith that you have to raise
[1:53:22] your arm like this he says you want to
[1:53:23] raise your arm you raise your arm
[1:53:24] it just happens you just believe it it's
[1:53:26] just as normal as getting up out of bed
[1:53:28] in the morning that's what perfect faith
[1:53:29] is nothing big it's nothing elaborate
[1:53:32] there's no complication to it there's no
[1:53:34] complexity to it by what you cannot
[1:53:36] understand it it just simply happens
[1:53:38] because it's a sixth sense now you're
[1:53:42] getting into perfect faith perfect
[1:53:44] perfection that cannot fail that thing
[1:53:46] never fails yes he was a mystic to them
[1:53:49] with his perfect faith exactly he was a
[1:53:53] mystic to us when he said you can
[1:53:55] actually pick up a tree and have it
[1:53:56] planted in the water simply if you have
[1:53:58] just this it's enough faith as a grain
[1:53:59] of a mustard seed when it's matured it
[1:54:02] will actually trees will obey you when
[1:54:05] you say get up and be ruling people
[1:54:06] you'll see there's a mystic to us just
[1:54:09] as much as it is to them but the world
[1:54:11] will never understand it and so it is
[1:54:15] now with those who have perfect faith a
[1:54:17] mystic to others and faith is a sixth
[1:54:22] sense brother Branham said old brother
[1:54:23] if that sixth sense could understand
[1:54:25] what we've been preaching about this
[1:54:26] week you see do you understand now he
[1:54:29] said I just wish that your faith that
[1:54:33] that sixth sense that I know God has
[1:54:35] given you and he knew that they didn't
[1:54:37] catch it he knew that they didn't
[1:54:38] understand it completely he said I just
[1:54:40] wish that you who are hearing my words
[1:54:42] would understand he said I wish that
[1:54:46] faith could be latched on he said I wish
[1:54:49] that sixth sense could understand what
[1:54:50] we've been preaching about this week he
[1:54:52] said then it would point you back to
[1:54:54] where you need to be he knew what was
[1:54:55] supposed to happen but it had delay in
[1:54:57] the presence of the Sun and it only knew
[1:54:59] that four years later but he was saying
[1:55:01] now I just wish you could understand it
[1:55:03] and that Holy Ghost God made this
[1:55:04] promise God made the promise that we're
[1:55:07] gonna be back there we're gonna be back
[1:55:09] there we took it through the scriptures
[1:55:12] this week back and forth and back and
[1:55:14] forth and combed it over until we know
[1:55:16] that God promised to do this thing he's
[1:55:18] going to do now in this day the
[1:55:20] supernatural now real genuine faith
[1:55:22] would see that that can catch a hold of
[1:55:24] it and all Devils out of hell would
[1:55:27] never shake him away from it just catch
[1:55:30] it with simple faith and there's not a
[1:55:33] devil in hell it could shake your phone
[1:55:35] it but we stumble at it it's not it's
[1:55:39] not used enough we depend too much on
[1:55:42] the five senses and when most of most of
[1:55:46] the time 95% of the people are better as
[1:55:48] soon as they see the the senses the five
[1:55:50] senses is finished well it's gone I did
[1:55:53] my get my grave get my casket ready as
[1:55:56] soon as the five senses it can't believe
[1:55:57] it anymore
[1:55:58] they just to give up that's when faith
[1:56:00] needs to kick in
[1:56:03] whatever little portion you have
[1:56:04] whatever you've got if you've got faith
[1:56:06] enough to come to church give it to him
[1:56:08] stay on the basis of his word and he'll
[1:56:10] bring out of you what he wants to bring
[1:56:12] out of it hey man he says just lay it
[1:56:15] just lay it in there the interesting
[1:56:18] thing about preaching is that you'll
[1:56:21] probably only most likely retain maybe
[1:56:23] 1% of what I have said this weekend so I
[1:56:26] labor and I pour it out for out you know
[1:56:28] an hour and brother Dale can preach for
[1:56:30] you know a certain amount of time and
[1:56:34] you only retain probably 1% of it maybe
[1:56:36] even less than 1% of it but what will
[1:56:38] happen is that when you go through
[1:56:40] something of the next week or the next
[1:56:42] month or the next 10 years God will
[1:56:44] bring that out of your memory because
[1:56:46] it's it's it's physical it's inside of
[1:56:48] you it's nothing needs to recall a God
[1:56:50] will bring that out of you what I've
[1:56:52] said because I felt that led to say what
[1:56:54] I've been saying God will bring exactly
[1:56:56] what I've said to that moment that to
[1:56:57] what you are going through and you'll
[1:56:59] recall it and that'll be just enough
[1:57:01] daily bread to get you through but you
[1:57:05] can forget a 99.5% of what I've said
[1:57:09] this morning I probably won't even
[1:57:11] remember a week from them but they'll be
[1:57:14] that one thing that you'll need that God
[1:57:16] will give you all you need to do is give
[1:57:18] the you give what little bit you have
[1:57:21] into his hands yeah you're going through
[1:57:23] something and then you'll come to a
[1:57:26] scripture just base that scripture in
[1:57:28] his presence just give it to his
[1:57:30] presence and come to him and say Lord I
[1:57:32] believe the description you're going
[1:57:34] through a trial you just say Lord I
[1:57:35] believe that Scripture there's been
[1:57:37] trials at my life where I've simply
[1:57:38] taken the same song and read it out lie
[1:57:41] a little out on my bed every single
[1:57:43] night for months the same scripture not
[1:57:46] another one there nothing I didn't I
[1:57:48] didn't feel like I grew a lick but just
[1:57:51] the same scripture just lay it before
[1:57:53] the presence of God and eventually
[1:57:54] you'll come through that child and
[1:57:56] you'll have learned something that no
[1:57:58] nothing you could buy off of a bookshelf
[1:58:01] could ever teach you
[1:58:03] it's the grace of Almighty God go
[1:58:05] through a short season through many fun
[1:58:07] many-fold temptations and trials that
[1:58:10] the trying of your faith bringeth forth
[1:58:12] something that is like just like gold at
[1:58:16] the time of your faith just just for a
[1:58:19] season just life life is just a season
[1:58:21] and it brings forth this thing you just
[1:58:24] have to give what little tiny bit of
[1:58:26] faith you've got into the hands of God
[1:58:29] he produces that Philippians 1:6 being
[1:58:34] confident of this very thing that he
[1:58:36] which hath begun a good work in you will
[1:58:38] perform it perform it until the day of
[1:58:42] Jesus Christ that he that has begun a
[1:58:46] good work in you will perform it until
[1:58:48] the day of Jesus Christ until that
[1:58:52] moment were brought back and more right
[1:58:54] there so how much what kind of people
[1:58:57] should we be we shouldn't be they know
[1:59:01] we're never gonna be these perfect
[1:59:02] people who do get everything and our
[1:59:04] errorless people we simply know where
[1:59:07] our strength lies and we know how the
[1:59:10] mechanics of our faith can work if we
[1:59:13] displace it in life right so because of
[1:59:17] the messenger of this age we're pointed
[1:59:19] back to Christ and now we have the
[1:59:20] mechanics and the dynamics for our faith
[1:59:22] to grow and ripen into a perfect faith
[1:59:25] that will allow us to rapture out of
[1:59:28] here bring us back to where God wanted
[1:59:30] us there's no other age that could have
[1:59:32] that because there's no other age we had
[1:59:33] the fullness of the word then we have to
[1:59:36] recognize who she was but because we
[1:59:39] recognize who we are through the the
[1:59:42] book of redemption that that book of
[1:59:44] redemption was us and it was the lamb
[1:59:46] whose slate was slain for us before the
[1:59:48] foundation of the world and by that we
[1:59:50] are baptized into Jesus Christ and born
[1:59:52] again into him anew which is what the
[1:59:54] message in a mister Christ the mister
[1:59:57] the mister God Christ is the mystery of
[2:00:01] God revealed as simple as there is to it
[2:00:04] Christ is the mystery of God revealed so
[2:00:07] God is all complexin and we do just lose
[2:00:09] the the the simplicity that God wraps
[2:00:12] himself in because we're so focused
[2:00:14] on things in the seat drop fear right in
[2:00:16] you'll be a million miles off from where
[2:00:18] you need to be but it's not until God
[2:00:20] can get the wrong kind of fear out that
[2:00:23] he can get you into a place where you
[2:00:25] reverence him and respect him enough and
[2:00:28] present yourself to him in a way that
[2:00:30] faith can come in and buy that sixth
[2:00:33] sense you place what you've got even if
[2:00:36] it's just enough to believe that he is
[2:00:38] in a reward of those who diligently seek
[2:00:42] Him even if it's just that yeah and you
[2:00:44] believe that alone you place that faith
[2:00:47] on the run the basis of the Word of God
[2:00:49] and it's the Holy Spirit that anoints
[2:00:52] the seed and brings forth the light it's
[2:00:55] as simple as that
[2:00:56] wonderful let's stand our feet or the
[2:01:05] deal if you'd like to come with a song
[2:01:06] leader for the Bob maybe you'd like to
[2:01:12] lead us in some sing songs and that we
[2:01:15] could just take what we've learned and
[2:01:17] just laid in the presence of the Sun
[2:01:20] nothing nothing more needs to be done
[2:01:22] nothing more needs to be done than that
[2:01:25] it's not flesh it's it's Christ who does
[2:01:27] the work it's Christ you put that in you
[2:01:30] and it's Christ that will bring it out
[2:01:31] of you as he wants to bring it out of
[2:01:33] you in the way that he will do it and
[2:01:35] whatever way it may be oh yeah that's
[2:01:38] pretty
[2:01:38] gracious Heavenly Father I thank you so
[2:01:40] much Lord for the opportunity to be here
[2:01:44] and to speak about your word I'm so
[2:01:47] thankful Lord that you've given me a
[2:01:49] place that I can base and found date and
[2:01:52] place my faith on and build a foundation
[2:01:55] upon and that's the Word of God when
[2:01:58] Paul he went to the he went to the
[2:02:02] people that he went to and he said I
[2:02:03] can't come to you in enticing words of
[2:02:05] man's wisdom because it just it simply
[2:02:08] doesn't do anything I said I come to you
[2:02:10] in power and demonstration of Almighty
[2:02:13] God and wasn't dancing and shouting and
[2:02:16] anything like that maybe so it was just
[2:02:18] the fact that he came to you in Christ's
[2:02:21] name and he placed his faith on you and
[2:02:23] it was you who spoke to him and
[2:02:25] demonstrated and heal
[2:02:27] and did mighty signs and wonders because
[2:02:29] those signs would follow them that
[2:02:30] believe and they believed because it was
[2:02:33] just enough faith but he gave into your
[2:02:36] hands and you brought them back to you
[2:02:38] would help us to do the same thing to
[2:02:42] get up tomorrow morning or Tuesday
[2:02:44] morning and go back to work and just
[2:02:47] present what we've got back to you and
[2:02:49] you bring out of us what you want us to
[2:02:50] bring if even if we do that same routine
[2:02:53] for the next 20 years let us just not
[2:02:56] give up let us fight the good fight of
[2:02:59] faith
[2:03:02] granite father that you give us our day
[2:03:04] the strength to keep going we love you
[2:03:08] Father and we thank you
[2:03:09] amen gracious name do we pray amen hey
[2:03:15] hey Matt praises the name of the Lord we
[2:03:18] thank God again for the word amen and
[2:03:22] again to say that I believe that the
[2:03:25] Lord sent our brother to minister on
[2:03:27] what he ministered and to preach
[2:03:30] concerning fear and faith by the grace
[2:03:34] of God and to finish it with the your
[2:03:37] measure of faith and you want to know
[2:03:40] what what it's all about what you can go
[2:03:43] back and meet made reference to it
[2:03:45] concerning Hebrews 11 and and by faith
[2:03:48] this one did this and by faith this one
[2:03:50] did that so it was a measure of faith
[2:03:52] and the measure of faith that that give
[2:03:57] that Abel had in the outside the garden
[2:04:00] in offering the sacrifice that he
[2:04:02] offered the measure of faith that Noah
[2:04:04] had the measure of let's talk about the
[2:04:07] measure of faith that Enoch had the
[2:04:09] Bible says that it's so pleased God that
[2:04:12] that he ended God took him off the earth
[2:04:14] and he just went on and on and on and on
[2:04:18] but but again let's remember again what
[2:04:21] our brothers have reminded us of it not
[2:04:25] to complicate it it is God hidden and
[2:04:28] revealed in simplicity amen it is God
[2:04:32] speaking the word and
[2:04:34] and the believer believing the word and
[2:04:37] acting on the word and letting God
[2:04:39] manifest that in your life by grace a
[2:04:42] man by the grace of God through faith no
[2:04:46] wonder it says you know again it says it
[2:04:48] is by grace people say by grace were
[2:04:52] saved by grace were saved
[2:04:54] no white we are saved by grace through
[2:04:56] faith a man and by the grace of God for
[2:05:01] the fate of God God's revealing this to
[2:05:04] you entered into that generation to
[2:05:06] another generation to another generation
[2:05:08] but you know the measure of faith is it
[2:05:11] changes from one generation to another
[2:05:13] God requires more of this generation any
[2:05:17] required of another generation amen
[2:05:19] because this is the endtime generation
[2:05:22] and the prophet of God in this honor
[2:05:25] preached that message then again our
[2:05:27] brother Stephen referred to it on
[2:05:29] perfect faith and he said why am i
[2:05:31] ministering this message he said to rub
[2:05:33] out he said unbelief he said to bring us
[2:05:36] to this perfect faith and he said
[2:05:39] because we have to come to this perfect
[2:05:41] faith he's at for the rapture and again
[2:05:44] what is that perfect faith that is
[2:05:46] simply believing what God said amen and
[2:05:49] I pray the grace of God that you'll get
[2:05:52] that revelation from what I brother
[2:05:54] ministered on Friday and Saturday and
[2:05:57] again again this morning
[2:05:59] and so I'm going to provide you with
[2:06:01] copies of the of the sermons in the DVDs
[2:06:05] outside by the grace of God so that you
[2:06:08] would take them and listen to them again
[2:06:09] it is I believe honestly speaking I
[2:06:12] believe there's any messages that we
[2:06:14] have heard that well I believe we need
[2:06:16] to hear these messages again amen go
[2:06:19] back and listen to what he said on
[2:06:21] Friday night go back and listen to what
[2:06:24] our brother Stephen ministered on
[2:06:25] Saturday night and again listen to
[2:06:28] whatever other ministered again this
[2:06:30] morning they may and remember God is in
[2:06:33] and revealing simplicity but again on
[2:06:36] down to the
[2:06:37] man has taken it and tried to make it
[2:06:39] complicated God speaks and God does what
[2:06:43] he says he's going to do God in
[2:06:46] simplicity a million we are and God said
[2:06:50] he was going to do this and he did it
[2:06:52] God said he was going to do that and he
[2:06:53] did it you know there's nothing
[2:06:56] complicated about it
[2:06:57] you take Noah's message and he said he
[2:06:59] was good that God was going to bring a
[2:07:01] flood and Noah acted on that faith that
[2:07:05] revelation him and day in and day out
[2:07:08] him and his family went out and they
[2:07:10] were working on this Ark a man there
[2:07:13] there's no question there was no doubt
[2:07:14] none whatsoever
[2:07:16] and it was our brothers father that that
[2:07:20] made reference to Noah in the ark and he
[2:07:24] said they went God called him into the
[2:07:26] ark and he said the Sun was shining
[2:07:29] there were no clouds and no death and no
[2:07:34] doubt he said they might have been in
[2:07:35] the archive for a couple of days and
[2:07:37] then they went up and and opened the
[2:07:39] window that was that that was the only
[2:07:41] thing that was in the ARCA that at the
[2:07:43] room and the open the window and
[2:07:45] anywhere and the Sun was still shining
[2:07:47] and know that the family might have said
[2:07:50] God or ever our dad is a really little
[2:07:54] Wayne yes he said it's going to rain are
[2:07:56] you sure he said I'm sure why because
[2:08:00] God said so
[2:08:02] man God said so and so they they took
[2:08:06] their stand on what God said I we
[2:08:08] standing out what God said concerning
[2:08:11] this day this hour and the resurrection
[2:08:14] and the rapture amen don't complicate it
[2:08:17] and try to make it what it is not God
[2:08:21] God said the dead in Christ shall rise
[2:08:23] first and then we which are the living
[2:08:28] are going to be changed and count away
[2:08:30] with him to meet the Lord in the air so
[2:08:33] shall we ever be with the Lord that's
[2:08:36] what God's working on that the faith
[2:08:38] that he has given us in this hour
[2:08:40] that's a faith that he is asking us to
[2:08:42] believe in this day and in this age
[2:08:45] remember that when you see this when you
[2:08:48] see all these things happening out there
[2:08:50] in the world and the things of the world
[2:08:53] and politics and and the immorality and
[2:08:57] everything else in the world are there
[2:08:58] religiously he said this is going to
[2:09:00] happen that's going to happen they're
[2:09:02] going to be false for Christ or false
[2:09:04] prophets and he said now you see when
[2:09:07] you see that are we going to do what he
[2:09:09] told us to do if so when you see that he
[2:09:12] said look up and lift up your heads of
[2:09:15] understanding because your Redemption
[2:09:18] draw an eye whether when we stop and
[2:09:21] consider what our brothers ministered
[2:09:23] and the faith that God has revealed to
[2:09:26] us and given to us in this hour lift up
[2:09:29] your heads of understanding amen
[2:09:31] don't be blowing - what's a br there but
[2:09:34] at the same time by the grace of God
[2:09:36] don't be blind to what God is doing
[2:09:38] according to his word amen for those
[2:09:42] that believe for those that have faith
[2:09:45] they're gone rev up the make-belief and
[2:09:48] give us a real genuine faith and that we
[2:09:52] are living day in and day
[2:09:54] looking for and expecting the
[2:09:57] resurrection and expecting that in
[2:10:00] Christ to arise in it and appear to us a
[2:10:03] million can you explain that I won't
[2:10:07] really explain it there with any place I
[2:10:10] go to rise because there when I say
[2:10:13] arise that coming out of one dimension
[2:10:15] and into this dimension to appear to
[2:10:18] those Saints that are that are ready for
[2:10:20] the resurrection those things that
[2:10:22] believe in the resurrection and believe
[2:10:25] in the rapture
[2:10:26] amen the Lord descending with every
[2:10:29] little sound the voice of the Archangel
[2:10:31] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[2:10:33] shall rise first then I do in the grave
[2:10:36] so they are in Christ they may live in
[2:10:42] Christ so they've started pretty to that
[2:10:46] to the Saints letter that have faith to
[2:10:49] the face I really believe the face where
[2:10:51] they're not not fearing the flesh not
[2:10:54] really what's going on over there who
[2:10:56] believe in y'all they got the Blessed
[2:10:58] hope amen
[2:11:00] so the dead in Christ are gonna start
[2:11:04] appearing outside by the grace of God to
[2:11:06] you to me and Julio in instantly we're
[2:11:10] going to be changed in the glorified
[2:11:12] bodies like it's worth I body Alleluia
[2:11:15] that will be caught up into not those
[2:11:18] clouds hey man don't worry bro Stevens
[2:11:21] they won't be there
[2:11:22] amen so it will have nothing to do that
[2:11:27] that weather then let's make it smaller
[2:11:29] so it's going to be cultivating the
[2:11:32] clouds of glory
[2:11:33] it's going to color it
[2:11:35] the weather this kind of come from a way
[2:11:42] it wasn't a rocket ship
[2:11:43] there was angels they caught up in the
[2:11:46] clouds of angels all alone they made a
[2:11:50] place where they've of the Lord the
[2:11:53] Angels was going to be where we're going
[2:11:56] to be worshiping the bride and the
[2:11:58] bridegroom this would be the name of the
[2:12:01] Lord
[2:12:02] Alleluia so Larry believed that is that
[2:12:05] simple
[2:12:06] amen there's a flood who's coming that
[2:12:11] it came hey man no matter how he's in
[2:12:15] the ark for seven days and nothing
[2:12:17] happened absolutely nothing happened and
[2:12:19] I was surrounded by make believers and
[2:12:23] unbelievers and and they were maybe
[2:12:25] making fun of them because it was a boat
[2:12:28] on dry land amen he didn't do it down by
[2:12:31] the ocean if you little dry land
[2:12:34] hayleybay and far away from the ocean
[2:12:37] far away from all the literature and
[2:12:39] everything else
[2:12:40] amen God separates us unto himself and
[2:12:44] so there they were baby laughing and
[2:12:47] making fun and maybe better have been
[2:12:51] all of a sudden after that seventh day
[2:12:53] maybe they tried to make it up the hill
[2:12:55] gangplank wherever they were in the
[2:12:58] cloud began to come and the moisture be
[2:13:00] in there began to fall oh well maybe
[2:13:03] maybe he was right no no not maybe it's
[2:13:07] just saith the Lord amen and they will
[2:13:11] try to make it up the old gangplanks all
[2:13:13] right but the door was shut Charlie but
[2:13:17] the door was locked
[2:13:18] amen they couldn't get in amen brother
[2:13:23] help us God Elvis to believe that God in
[2:13:26] simplicity that he did it eventually the
[2:13:30] flood came and washed them all the way
[2:13:32] and so God give us the faith of Enoch
[2:13:35] god help us god bless it what is the
[2:13:42] measure of your faith more faith in the
[2:13:48] world then he got more faith that in
[2:13:51] politics and in God more faith in the
[2:13:54] politicians more faith in religion
[2:13:58] most have faith in all these things but
[2:14:01] they don't have faith in God amen
[2:14:04] but there is a few there is a few and is
[2:14:10] getting fewer and fewer I trust by grace
[2:14:13] you're one of the few and that you have
[2:14:18] that measure of faith it's going to take
[2:14:20] us from time to eternity it's all right
[2:14:23] we'll be back again when God's finished
[2:14:26] with the rest on this world we'll be
[2:14:28] back and you'll come back and set up his
[2:14:30] kingdom are you gonna sit with him and
[2:14:33] his throne and reign with him remember
[2:14:36] if you can't handle the word here and
[2:14:38] you can't take the responsibility of the
[2:14:40] word here and go out and live for Jesus
[2:14:43] here you won't be able to do it there
[2:14:45] yes our brother did don't forget what he
[2:14:48] said what's God doing now God's doing
[2:14:52] now to us what he's been doing to is
[2:14:54] elected seed all down through the ages
[2:14:57] don't sue me for new he's doing is doing
[2:15:02] to us what he did to them and that's
[2:15:03] molding our character god bless you
[2:15:07] brother that's the truth
[2:15:08] why because only character can sit in
[2:15:12] the throne wonderful hallelujah
[2:15:16] with Lu Thursday Westley's day the
[2:15:18] Pentecostal age where was the old
[2:15:20] fashioned salvation asst are the
[2:15:23] revivals that God had down through the
[2:15:25] ages is molding their character so that
[2:15:27] they could they they they can reign with
[2:15:30] him or they they can they can go out and
[2:15:32] do what he wants them to do outside the
[2:15:34] city
[2:15:35] amen there's going to be there's gonna
[2:15:37] be many outside the city and there's
[2:15:39] going to be a bright under bright group
[2:15:41] the city but he's molding your character
[2:15:49] people think you got a good character
[2:15:51] for this and good character for that do
[2:15:53] you have the Christian character not
[2:15:56] religious character Christian character
[2:15:59] god help us that will enter in and
[2:16:04] believe that measure of faith that God
[2:16:06] has given us in this hour that's good
[2:16:12] and faith you know faith does hope faith
[2:16:17] does this day fate does that yes it does
[2:16:19] but in order for it to accomplish the
[2:16:22] will of God in your life faith has got
[2:16:25] to give God preeminence go back and
[2:16:30] we'll go back and listen listen again to
[2:16:32] what our brother ministered on Friday
[2:16:33] and Saturday
[2:16:36] there is the fear of man the fear of the
[2:16:39] devil but then there's the fear of God
[2:16:42] absolutely you know don't forget what he
[2:16:45] said what is the fear of God respecting
[2:16:49] and reverence in God a man that he is
[2:16:53] forgot first place in your life brother
[2:16:57] so that why so that you walk with God as
[2:17:02] he knocked it I remember Enoch was the
[2:17:05] seventh from the first Adam we're the
[2:17:09] seventh from the second half Christ
[2:17:13] hallelujah he walked with God and he was
[2:17:17] not because God took him and look and he
[2:17:21] saw the Lord coming with ten thousands
[2:17:24] of his Saints he saw this he saw that
[2:17:27] and now there's there's another
[2:17:28] generation a little bright remember is
[2:17:32] getting
[2:17:36] the pavement is not getting bigger
[2:17:39] pyramid is getting smaller amen so it's
[2:17:44] getting fewer and fewer and the closer
[2:17:47] you get to the end jesus said when the
[2:17:50] Son of Man comes will he find faith on
[2:17:54] the earth will he find the faith that
[2:17:59] our brother ministry on the tenth this
[2:18:01] morning the faith that absolutely trust
[2:18:07] the Lord all things are possible
[2:18:12] oh so there's going to be a few that
[2:18:14] it's going to have that thing there's
[2:18:16] going to take us from time to eternity
[2:18:18] like it took Enoch
[2:18:20] from time to eternity just think of
[2:18:24] Maisie
[2:18:29] I trust he not reprehended you and me by
[2:18:36] the grace of God pew there Strait is the
[2:18:41] gate narrow is the way and few there be
[2:18:43] that find it
[2:18:45] few that God saw is just like that Dinah
[2:18:51] costal pastor one time asked me to
[2:18:53] explain predestination
[2:18:54] I was sent him in Pentecostal church and
[2:18:59] a preacher preached on predestination
[2:19:01] and they didn't believe it just
[2:19:05] absolutely didn't believe it and then
[2:19:08] fellowshiping with somebody one day
[2:19:12] certain brother that loved the Word of
[2:19:14] God and came his son-in-law
[2:19:19] it was the Pentecostal preacher and he
[2:19:24] said excuse me brother he said could you
[2:19:25] explain predestination you're saying God
[2:19:30] predestinated this be decimated that he
[2:19:33] said where this choice come into it I
[2:19:36] said there is a choice but I said by
[2:19:40] foreknowledge is in Peter there
[2:19:43] according to his foreknowledge what God

[2:33:58] verse of scripture with you again
[2:34:00] concerning with our brother ministered
[2:34:02] in these lastly services
[2:34:08] did you understand his speech did you
[2:34:18] understand the Ministry of the word and
[2:34:25] I understand the word that was great for
[2:34:30] you'd have to hear the logos thereof
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:34:35] jesus said to the Pharisees why do you
[2:34:38] not understand my speech why do you not
[2:34:44] understand my speech why do you not
[2:34:47] understand what I'm saying he said
[2:34:51] because he cannot hear my word what is
[2:34:58] the difference between his speech and
[2:35:00] his word to speak with the literal voice
[2:35:05] that they heard his word is the logos
[2:35:09] revelation of what he was saying
[2:35:12] you can hear what I'm saying we could
[2:35:14] hear what our brother Steven preached
[2:35:15] these last three services they're
[2:35:18] literally those by the letter of the
[2:35:19] word but do we get the spiritual
[2:35:21] revelation of it hey man the word have
[2:35:27] fall on to fall and and you hear the
[2:35:29] word and one goes out next this way and
[2:35:32] then another one goes out because they
[2:35:34] got the logos they go out and live a
[2:35:36] different life one becomes religious the
[2:35:40] other one become spiritual hallelujah
[2:35:45] why because they heard the speech they
[2:35:51] understood the speech because they to
[2:35:54] understand it lift up your heads I'm
[2:35:55] understanding your Redemption draweth
[2:35:58] nigh they understood the speech because
[2:36:03] they heard the word their logos behind
[2:36:06] what it was because what was being said
[2:36:08] the revelation of the faith the ie what
[2:36:11] was being said grace that you're not go
[2:36:17] out with just knowledge in your head but
[2:36:19] your globe with the revelation of what
[2:36:22] our brother ministered in your heart and
[2:36:24] now that it will affect you
[2:36:29] it'll control you it'll guarantee
[2:36:33] because it is Christ in control let's
