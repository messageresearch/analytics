more into the likeness of our Heavenly Father amen praise the name of the Lord this standard sing only believe all things are possible only believe and considering those that are not that won't be here again Sunday and even I guess there are others won't be here the following Sunday yeah so we have maybe postponed the communion again hopefully tell most of them are here I was planning on communion foot Washington Sunday but I think a lot of a lot of those Saints will be gone this Sunday and next Sunday so the grace of God be with us we're still focus on the word a man and also will decide what the Lord would have us to do regarding the link that our brother Matthew wanted to show us concerning the Eagles so we'll see how it works out by the grace of God they met and again you know you would like to have most most of the Saints here amen and it's very very few I guess that's half of them and the other half is gone so grace our God be with the Saints and I pray and grace that you're following the leadership of the Holy Ghost is that what you want is what he wants a man but what he wants you to do where he wants to go as I keep saying and then when he wants you to go and how he wants you to go so on so the grace that God be with us but I tell you it takes death to self to really become alive to him and follow his leadership not my will but thine be done you got to die amen and that's what Jesus did he was laying down his will when it comes to physical because he knew what the word required and he stayed with the word so he said not my will he died to self he died to the fears of the flesh remember oh yeah he was Jesus but he experienced fear he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without seeing and so he experienced all these things even unto fear but he got to the place an angel came and ministered to him amen and he said not my real father dying be done he let go for your sake and for mine praise the name of the Lord Alleluia so let's let go and let God have his way only really all things are possible Oh [Music] Oh [Music] Oh Oh Oh [Applause] [Music] the grace of your presence the grace of your anointing is what we're seeking tonight the grace of your president your anointing Lord is what we're believing that we are in fellowship with a man knowing Lord that we didn't come to meet you but we believed or that we came with

a man recently who the Lord God bless you turn with me to Matthew chapter 16 Matthew chapter 16 and beginning to read that verse 22 and it says then Peter took him and began to rebuke him Jesus because he had mentioned about being rejected by man and being killed in Jerusalem a man but Peter rebuked him and saying be it far from the lord this shall not be unto thee but what was the will of God and what is the will of God but he Jesus turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan a man he was a review he beat her but the devil that was using Peter amen and he said get thee behind me Satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those that build men the grace of God that we're going to savor the things that are of God brother these are the things that makes us overcomers and testifies of our overcoming power amen and he said in verse 24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself amen you're giving him the preeminence well I know I want this or I want that or you might think I need this and I need that what is the will of God a man in all circumstances and in all situations if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever will save his life shall lose it a man gracious that we want to lose our lives in this world and we'll find our lives in the world of God and whosoever will lose his life for my sake amen now living for yourselves but you living for Jesus and whosoever will live it and lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul amen grace of God be with us to give us the understanding we need to put us on our guard so that we're gonna be on our toes not my will going to be done a man for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul for the Son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works a man that the works that are reflecting the word works that reflect the will of God in your life a man verily I say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom god bless his words you may be seated turn we meet at saint luke's gospel chapter 9 let's make sure that we are in the will of god make sure we're doing the will of god and sometimes there's a price to pay because even paul we have the record in the in the scriptures concerning the apostle paul a messenger to the first age that he got caught up with his emotion but not his faith and it wasn't a revelation from god it was his census and maybe it was the enemy that was influencing paul because they wanted to go to Asia and then they journey to Asia and they were going to do this and we're going to do that but it didn't work they realized but too late that it wasn't the will of God amen and Paul said we hurt so much he said they we we wanted to die things were going so bad for them in Asia he said we wanted to die but again the grace of God was there to bring them back to Israel a man bringing back to those for whom he was a messenger for that age a man and to do what God wanted him to do and when God wanted to do it and where God wanted to do it so let's make sure that we're in the will of God and doing the will of God and that God is God is able at any time to contact us amen and that put us into his service amen wherever it is whatever it is we're going to do the will of God we want the will of God by the grace of God so truly brothers sister a man truly we am to be dead to ourselves and alive to him amen so why so there were sensitive to him and not to ourselves sensitive to his leadership and his faith but not to our own not on what I want to do Lord what do you want me to do amen by the grace of Almighty God a man this is tremendous in Luke chapter 9 and verse 23 and he said unto them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross daily deny yourself take up your cross daily not just Wednesday and Sunday but you take up your cross daily you're living for him everyday amen we're in contact with him every day when they get up in the morning you greet the Lord a man you're asking for the grace of his presence and continue with you through the day when you're going you go to bed at night you're going to say good night to the Lord asking the grace of his presence to watch over you and to protect us amen by the grace of Almighty God old brother it's so important to us to die to ourselves and swim and brother I tell you this there's only one way for us to be to do that we had to be overcomers to be dead to yourself you had to be a spiritual overcomer a man in your soul and your body and your spirit if you're overcoming your soul then you're you got the power and you got the anointing to overcome in your spirit and to overcome in your flesh by the grace of God you have the power over the devil a man and this is what we want to be an overcomer we have to have that power we are there that Ananya we are overcomers we will have that power if we are overcomers we will have that anointing because what do we do we did exactly what God told us to do what must I do to be saying what must they do they're back here what must they do in every age to be saying repent amen is anything that God expects first and foremost in your relationship with them is repentance amen you got the attitude of repentance you got the spirit of repentance he made morning new tonight a man you're continually in there the attitude that spirit a mayor because if at any time you step out of the way if at any time you step out of his will if at any time that selfishness took over a man you got to repent a man and and you're going to call on the Lord for more and more of his anointing more and more of his presence amen so the devil will influence us less and less amen well the prophet of God was seen in madam chairman tackling that and again let me emphasize this is why he preached how can I overcome and again nitros adjust for Bamm tabernacle I believe it applies to a lot of messy churches amen he's now preaching to those are there he is preaching to believers amen he is preaching to those under his ministry amen oh my brother they they they believe brother around to be a prophet yes they do or they did and I have a profession belief that that this was a prophet of God in the pulpit there was a prophet of God that was ministering to them but then what they were they were putting the emphasis on was the signs the sight in the hand and the discernment amen not necessarily the word to put the emphasis on the word and the Bible Oh God began to see they they were drifting from the revelation of the word amen they're recognizing him as a messenger but what about the message amen there's one thing to recognize a messenger to receive a messenger it's another thing to receive the message a man I appreciate that some years ago about somebody coming to your door knocking on your door and you look out so I don't know who that is I mean I'm not going to go out there but they have a message for you amen so they'll keep knocking on till you answer but it took what for you to recognize the message for you to really take the message serious you've got to recognize that person as the right to deliver the message amen that person is ordained with the company that received it he's ordained to bring it from the company to the person that it was sent to a man and bribry preached on that years ago maybe it may be an empire avenue or another building that we were hearing but we've really got to recognize that it's from God we got to recognize they want to come to within brand well he was the prophet of God he was the servant of God but what about his message amen the many were coming as I said coming to see or robbers coming to see T laws weren't coming to see aaand but who was coming to see Jesus amen and again the Father God knew that they were coming to see him but they weren't coming to see Jesus they were seeing more and more and more a William Branham and less and less of Jesus amen as he was put out of the law to see in church age now there's many that came out of those ages into the message many of our putting them out of their lives he never had the control of their lives amen oh he control their doctrine you know the common when it comes to the serpent seed and water baptism and all the other doctrines said the power of God was highlighting God was highlighting in the province ministry but when it comes to a God having control their personal lives no power God was seen less and less young and old because he did a question about the the young ray if they're going to lose their experience if they're lose this and they're going to lose their touch with goddess of mine he said it's going to be pretty bad he suffer for all the rest amen because God and God is depending on the young to maintain their testing not too young by the old to maintain their testimony and examples to the to the young by the grace of God God Elvis rather no no your now brother believing that the the younger generation is as man Saul for sure they had that generation and now God is depending on you oh yeah most definitely God's depending on you God depends on Noah and at the time of the flood and to build the ark and he had the supervisor he has Elam is telling this tell him that but brother I tell you this after after the flood now going in the Guyana God took Noah where was God dependent on God wasn't Benny on his sons Amen and their descendants and but again we know that there was there was one son that never stayed with the truth once I never stayed with the word and God God had to cut them all amen you know we know that Surrency did come through the ark man we know that it was in the women sure it was there a man but but again as some of them into fell fell subject to that Spiritist of the Serpent's he smear amen letting letting that spirit control them but I pray the guard god help us in this iron in this range a man that worry where we're going to stay with the word God took know of the men off the field but there are others who stay with the word and I meant again we know that before Noah went we know Enoch walked with God and he was raptured amai he walked with God and I did it is that's what made him an overcomer and brother he overcome the world he overcome the flesh and he overcome the devil and he oh he overcome this whole world he overcome the life that he was living in the flesh a man because he was raptured he was changed why by our brother what what how did he walk with God what kind of a relationship that he had with God then how much of an overcomer was he that he overcome the world and he overcome the flesh and overcome the devil and he any and he stepped at a time into eternity this is absolutely amazing because now God is requiring that of us in this generation God's requiring that of us in this age brother that we have a brother we have gone beyond the are the loudest cities where it were supposedly in a bride age and in the bride age is the union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride by the grace of Almighty God brother I trust say we recognize ourselves for who we are as truly as the Bride of Christ and you conduct yourself as the Bride of Christ brother neither brighter oh there are the denominations no no they let him go there anything they want there my God has called it a bride a man I trust we are bright but the public are recognized that a lot that came out of denominations was not Brian al are they were under under the realms of the message and the same they believed the message and follow him with her man they were not bright a man and again that's what he warned us he said you can be out of it and still a part of it because you got the spirit of it amen and there are those around this message they they're still salvation it's because they come out of the Salvation Army they still got the spirit of it the modern-day spirit amen and the same with Pentecostals they came out of Pentecost and they're still going to put a console spirit ain't man and then a brother brother brother this God brings us out to give us his spirit and his anointing for this hour and with this age not just a recognized Luther not just a recognized Wesley not just a recognized the Pentecostals and what God was doing through there but now is to recognize the bridegroom that the right ruler has come the brother has descended from heaven with a shout amen the bridegroom at entry ended through the Word of God through the message of the hour amen brother amen this is what God did then what's God doing now brother and it goes beyond with Lorena because he's gone that way that was there there all praise the Lord that the Ministry of the probably was there to reveal a sauna man revealing lease on a man relationship is not with him Branham our relationship is with the son of man hey man praise the Lord he said I am the resurrection and the life and then again it wasn't with Loretta it was Jesus because the part of God even with the Eve with the gifts and deserting the thoughts and intents of the heart the sign of the hand now he said you know he said I can't do this he said well who was doing it it was Jesus amen the Son of Man descended from heaven with a shout and the public guards to the science and to the Ministry of the word was revealing Jesus a man says Jesus in the Alpha ministry and he went forth with his signs and his wonders amen and he got their attention but again then he gave them the word concerning who he was oh my he saw him my father won and it upset the scribes and Pharisees allowed these of what oh they said this man is crazy this means the devil he's making himself equal with God he's making himself God and so on oh they got really upset no they they were attracted to it they wanted his signs and wonders wonders and all of these things but not the word Amen they continued not in the word that's why he put the emphasis there in John if you continue in the word then are you my disciples indeed amen but again they never continued in the word they continued in signs and wonders amen and Jesus would always bring out the word to separate amen God has always used the word to separate the believers from man from the unbelievers hey man or there are the unbelievers from the believers and doing in to a certain extent make believers from the believers amen as I told you concerning the the scripture there where Jesus would accept you eat the flesh of the Son of Man drink his blood you got no life in you all of that story for us in this hour two thousand years later but what did it mean they back there 2,000 years ago and here was a man that to them it was just he was just a man and to many that he was born out of wedlock Amen oh yeah they accuse them of the fornication and so on and they sing but but again they recognized oh yeah he's doing this he's doing that and the people who came and came and gay because they wanted God to do this for them want a God to do that amen the popular consciousness or problem buddies what are you going to do regard he said everybody wants God to do something for them but he said what about what are you going to do for God amen amen brother he witnessed it in this age he witnessed it in the Pentecostal revival he witness it in all rubbish ministry tea logs when a Yellin and many many other evangelists amen and some of them were even in Newfoundland 50 years ago or 55 or 60 years ago yes amen but again the thing that is what about the word what would the message amen they wanted the sunnies in the waters man and back then the emphasis was on shines and wonders and that's why brother Oral Roberts came to brother Branham and told him to stop preaching these things it's not preaching to you nobody but a woman should do how people should live how they should act and so on and he said brother brownie he said they're going to leave you if you don't stop preaching that and brother he was willing to pay the price or Roberts wasn't a man and Billy Graham and TLR husband and all the rest they were not willing to pay the price not not by any means buddy but with her men and worse he says somebody unappreciated the word amen it's the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth it is thus say the Lord it is written and sweetie he had brother brought Robert sort of walked away amen because he compromised and what did all due respect to our brother but what did he do he got raised about this and then he way God gave me the revelation of the Pentecostal revival guy came in the anointing of signs and wonders and he went for that a tremendous ministry but then he became more and more and more intellectual and less spiritual and he laughed and I'm believing them but he joined the Methodists I think of church I know in another church I said what when I was back there a young man and reading all these things and hearing but all these things why the world I said woody Lee Pentecost and and join this church or that church surely recognizes that the Pentecostal revival I suppose was the endtime revival for the vow to see interchange amen but the brave revival er for those that God calls out in Revelation 3:21 and if the old I stand in the door and knock amen and he wants to fellowship with them that's the bride he wants really do wonders with you that's the bride a man and it's called out of the churches by the grace of Almighty God amen god help us rather to recognize the word the message neither neither cupcake put emphasis on William Branham we don't bread and winter brown he wouldn't want that a man that by any means would he would he would allow if he were alive today a man he was alive today as I said he'd be pushing to get to believers and tell believers to line up with the word tell believers to be on their toes a man as he as he was doing right here the message how can I overcome a man he was laying it out laid it out later according to the word what God required all believers to the overcomers amen while God was looking for in the believers that was an overcomer my god Widow before in the sisters regard with everywhere in the brothers amen the very spiritual minded not religious spiritual but the thing of it is brother that they were getting more religious and less spiritual a man and again as I say this is what he preached I can't overcome is ministering this to believers is ministry this tube there are other messages that he preached to the bride in this last age brother again we could go back to the you know to the 50s and that's fine and go back to the 1940s my messages said that he preached and we can listen to it or we can read it a man but what what is the message now for the bride amen as I said the prophet of God went and he preached other messages because he felt that the bride needed it amen and in concerning you know not just how can I overcome but I'll get I'll get the list of those messages eventually amen to let you so it was it was God may he called the bride arrow now he was getting the bride to line up with a word and I was getting the brighter in her new wonders with the word know he was getting the bride to recognize the break room and Adrienne and visual union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride amen have you really honestly sincerely aided into a union with your bagram your spiritual bridegroom amen that we are the Bride of Christ we are that we are united with the bridegroom amen and we are the right of Christ and we are one with a bridegroom a mayor and brother we are the Bride of Christ we're living for the bedroom hey babe as the bride is there to serve the bride the bridegroom's as the wave of their the server has been a mass or the braid is there to serve Jesus amen the bride is there to live for Jesus the right is there to give her life for Jesus amen amen to give you the giving the glory and the honor amen by the grace of God for mates let's make sure that we are we have repented as we are two of our scene of our selfishness of our own ways and our own ideas lord I forgive me I want your I want your anointing I want your ways of on your will not mine amen praise the Lord I believe what you said the Word of God is written does say the Lord and Lord I believe in your resurrection I believe you died you lay down your life for me you picked it up again now Lord Lord I'm looking for the portion of that life in me amen the bathroom of the Holy Ghost in me by the grace of God amen what is that that's the resurrection amen that's the resurrection that's the rapture praise the name of the Lord and we repeated it a number of times amen sure but again not now that there are those that profess it but they haven't experienced it amen do you have there do you have other experience of the Resurrection in your soul do you have the experience of the rapture in your soul amen not all guys that experience they they but they have the doctrine but they don't have the experience oh I believe in the resurrection you do why what the Bible says this well you got to have a personal experience a personal testimony hey you've been in the resurrection why because I'm resurrected you want yeah I was a sinner I was dead in sins and trespasses but Alleluia when I am and I heard the Word of God and I repented and I asked God to forgive me and help me brother he came on the scene and he helped me he came on the scene and he gave me a part of his resurrection and rapture a minute he was resurrected he was raptured and he come back to share with us a man with the Gentile bride and eventually with Israel praise the name of the Lord brother this is tremendous a man so again as I said I said I believe that our service said that God has brought us beyond just a prophet he got us into the message amen and there are other message that he preached after the old me of the seven seals and he said to the in a certain message there now he said this is another revelation of the seals a man any priesthood after the seals maybe a year maybe a few months maybe three years after the sealed before God took him home hey man but he lady of this he laid in there into a port to get us to mature in the Word of God amen amen the only other seals is to reveal the mystery of God calling out of a Gentile bury a man he got he got the Jews there but he also got a Gentile bride a man and again and the Father God has brought out in this message right here and he said to remember he see there's there's a calling out and there's the elect when the conmen it comes to the Jews and the Gentiles and they're not all they are called out are elected then all that I called out are going to be part of the New Jerusalem a man but there there's elected and predestinated juice and Israelites that are a part of the New Jerusalem and he said of course he said there is a Gentile bride that is part of the New Jerusalem by the grace of God a man and then when I had gone through this message before but that apparently didn't didn't strike me for a long time until I was going through it just recently here as I've been ministry on it and the private of God brought out concerning again the call in the elect of the Jews and the call of the elect of the Gentiles a man and any any highlights again the New Jerusalem and he should look he said what it says right here concerning the New Jerusalem he said that's the Gentiles not gender that's the Jews he said right there and he said right here it is the Gentiles amen praise the name of the Lord so brother God Elvis who recognized God's plan purpose and pattern and I'll be the recognized God what he does and how he does it amen and again don't forget if you're going to get it as you ought to get it it is God hidden and it is God revealed in simplicity amen God is hidden in revealing simplicity so that only the elect are going to catch it amen only the true seat of God are going to recognize it Amen and move on with him praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord he sends the Holy Ghost to them I pray the father sent you another comforter and he saw not leave you comfortless I will come to you and in that day said you'll know that I mean the father the father me ie you you and me brother water oneness brother one thing to believe in the oneness of Jesus with the Father the Son and the father whatever the wonders of the children the sons and the daughters with their with Jesus and with the father a man that I am one with him hallelujah praise the name of the Lord or ever he was God so my praise and Aaron area I really well you got to have that revelation because he said God gives birth to gods Amen that's what we've been reminded of that so as no we're not when our church members when I denominational sons and daughters we are the sons and daughters of God we've been burdened again by the Word of God amen and we got the Holy Ghost that puts us into oneness with our Father amen amen amen brother says hallelujah we need that we certainly need the Holy Ghost mother in and well they needed we needed at every hour every age but how much do we need it sour for the resurrection how much we needed in this hour for the rapture and brother to be part of the resurrection part of the rapture there has to be a total separation amen total separation of unbelief and you're going to give preeminence to the faith by the grace of our God God was bringing to bringing our Lord Jesus Christ weight to that to that position of absolute separation amen so even his disciples were separated from him well he had to rebuke Peter and when he was betrayed of that they walked away Oh Peter we'll follow them yeah well why why that description be fulfilled that what Jesus said would be fulfilled jesus said Peter you're going to deny me three times yeah also I want the oh yes he said yes you will Peter but he was the only one all the rest went away all the res went somewhere else because they they didn't they didn't want to identify with Jesus or to recognize this or recognize them toward torturing him and doing doing these things hey man but oh they're right at Calvary amen but when Jesus was in to get cemani they were they slept as I said they slept naturally now believers are sleeping spiritually oh yeah not really into the word one time when Jesus was right there with his signs and wonders and everything they were really into it what Jesus was saying because their signs and wonders oh and they were glorified and so on because they went forth Jesus a goal heal the sick raise up this raise up that raised the dead they gave them power even Lucifer even a Judas Amen to do this to do that but here it is at the end and they're not supporting him Dursley it's amazing now people are so subject to the natural being and give premature than that and to the natural but not to the spiritual brother you need when the enemy comes in and tells you this oh you're tired get thee behind me Satan God's gonna give me the Holy Ghost you'll take it away yeah that'll get me the end need a man praise the name of the Lord old brother sister is not a generation they are very fair very few in this generation in this age that would have stood the revival fifty years ago he may have very food they would have stood the revival hundred years ago even fewer amen because way we gave our hearts to the Lord our life to the Lord we're living for the Lord and so I told our brother Billy Paul when I met I met him in Jeffersonville at the voice of God there and he greeted me and he's a little brother and glad he said yeah you made it he said glad you made it brother and thank you for what you've done and what you're doing for the Lord I said brother I we live for the Lord and I said all down through the years even when I way we were younger I said we live for Jesus I said when we took holidays I said we didn't we didn't look for a holidays I said just so we could have a rest on a break no I said we look for holidays to fellowship I said we went and traveled here travel there and felt sure with this brother and sister tell us with that brothers sister anybody praise the name of the Lord we were looking forward to going to gamble I felt assured brother sister Barnes and the Saints that were that were there go on to vishal falls go i go on even beyond that ain't man to Hampton amen why fellowship fellowship fellowship amen and well that was so much that was good that was a blessing amen because there was more and more of the anointing present then but now it's less of the poppy anointing that's right and that's why it feels in that world we live in feels so empty spiritually everybody it's empty brother sister because I feel that enthusiasm is not there like it used to be it's not there like like it used to be when when God first sent the Prophet is not there like it used to be in the opening of the word the seven seals amen because this is shortly after the only the word and the Prophet began to recognize a lot and I know their spirit was taking over amen why God it is ministry I come to a climax amen the third bottle they'll be the word and the people after that begin to draw back why because in 1962 the angel told him to stop using those signs and wonders start looking looking for God to do this God to do that now it's called looking for you to do this do this do this a man God did know to call it the brine God did that to get our attention God did that to reveal to us the mystery of God amen the mystery of God God's plan God's purpose cause pattern so that we would recognize where we are who we are in this hour amen the Lutheran's recognize them that in that age and the other ages and so on and the Pentecostals recognize it well this is God in this hour amen but now that's gone where we now what what revival are we in now we're certainly not in a lunar of the room the Lutheran revival we're not in a Pentecost revival we're not in another's rate I know amen we're not in the old-fashioned salvation everybody though amen so where everyone are we in the brave revival and everybody what is a reviving it's a stirring up a man they giving us hunger thirst enthusiasm zeal amen everybody's got a guy got that a man based on this revelation that Martin Luther had he was he was he has real enthusiasm all mine he was really built on even screaming it out and preaching it that the just shall live by faith and so on and that we are justified by faith according to our faith and I'm gonna get in in in in eventually what happened after Luther went off to see and he wasn't there is real is real win with him his enthusiasm went with him and they were very very few a man that moved on to another age with that Zealand that enthusiasm and went on and picked up with a Wesley went on and picked up the old fashioned army when I picked up there there the old fashioned Pentecostals amen so brother a guy got less and less and less so I I a witness the same around the message amen that feeling that a true Gemini there like it used today amen they're bigger they're more religious and they are less spiritual amen because again that's why there's going so few that are going in the resurrection and the rapture so few that are hungry no thirsting for their for the resurrection for the rapture there are so few that are merican but that are not cut off with this world so they're not cut up with the things of this world what's going on in this world anybody but I tell you the brine got no got nothing to do with this world the bride doesn't want to brides discontent was be content with such things as G I know people want God to make them bigger not physically they were rather comical smaller but when it comes to financially mentally emotionally oh I'm all right and you know I believe this and I believe that yeah what's the life your life reflecting it amen brother sister is more more than just religion it's more than saying I will obey was a prophet and more than saying I will I believe you the mystery of God is revealed amen no it's God coming down and revealing the mystery in you and through you it one thing for the Prophet to speak another thing for that word to become flesh in you amen for God to bring this to pass on that to bears to God to make us overcomers amen not just over coming to the religion or denomination but overcoming to religious spirits overcoming you just to be caught up with the mechanics of the word not the dynamics and this is this again another reason of that way the prophet of God preached how can I overcome it's because he was seeing less and less of the dynamics and more and more of the mechanics yeah they had the word any-any in the message why Christ me that's what he emphasizes mechanics versus dynamics and he said listen ISA we're going to take a double portion of the Holy Ghost to get us off the earth and he said there's too much emphasis on the mechanics and not enough on the dynamics amen brother amen you got to have any God I know the dynamics of that person that the powder God mentioned my Christ make any and he should a said when that hour comes for the rapture he says only take a boy or a girl or a man or a woman or a brother sister has a word he said to lift up there and say Lord I'm coming home and he said it'll trigger the rapture amen not say Lord what do you say no Lord isn't listening for what you're saying amen God Lulu he were a convention listening for a confession of your faith anybody he'd look at whether the revelation of that faith in your life amen so their Bible said they'll just lift up their hands and look up as a Lord we're coming home what a revelation amen what a revelation brother concerning considering what we have witnessed in this day in this hour this age concern considering what God has done in this age and brother it's not only on tapes it's on his eye on videos of CDs or DVDs amen brother probably got even back back way back years ago and when God given the vision and he said of all he said he knew that one day he said he said in Africa he said I saw them he said in division he saw something going around listening to the message with tubes and readers tubes that wasn't heard of in his day no no so he was seeing a more modern technology a man tubes and readers brothers sister and of course now the voice of God is putting this that budding that out so they just it's just any like unit in a cell phone there and now aren't those iPad or whatever amen and it's all there brother means without excuse and knowing that whether where it's on the internet and everything else the Word of God has gone around and around and around the world and I talked about that with our bed of old age a May and you get over 2 million hits around the world brother I remember one time receiving receiving emails from we're in there was no no Christianity alone no churches roll out yeah and then they said oh brother I live here and I worked for the government too and they said but we're not allowed to have Christian literature sent by mail because I eat someone requested it and also give me your address I'll send it to you well he said no you can't you're not allowed he said they won't receive it into this country and he somebody should do it can I have permission from you can I have your permission he said to print off what you got on the Internet I suggest brother you can print always a wonderful brother and I'll share it with others and he did print it and he shared it with others as far as I know I can't remember the name of the sit-down in the country any married but it's a country that's totally against Christianity totally against Christian material everything but I wouldn't have but there's a message Church there now hey man brother so again brother had to work the world's without a witness there without without an opportunity to say that oh we didn't know this didn't know that brothers had gone around the world the message and now brother the Bible's gone around the world and it is gone around the world and many other things had gone around the world amen and none of you just need the internet is part of it but the technology that everybody is sending around the world ear and there and everywhere not just books but the technology it's knowing that in the aisle I mention about the magazines the life magazines National Geographic magazines and the articles that they have printed magazines that were totally given over to to religious subjects one about Jesus what about the great men of the Bible one about the women of the Bible what about the prayers of the Bible and so on oh yeah and those that's on the internet too but those books are going around the world oh yeah they've got imprinted ice and I still I still see them here and there and everywhere and different subjects they're gonna cut their covering but it's all spiritual religious I said Lord you're doing this I said so that the whole world will receive the witness this gospel shall be preached to the whole world now not not the message of the hour that's just for to call it the bright Amen that's not for the others amen service residence keep our energy drained as I said and respect Amen what what they're doing and say lord help that person help that person amen and God's going to help them because why God's not not going to make an end of it till the whole world's received the witness anybody and there very few that have not received the witness yeah again we on our own page there I got I got portion there an article by a Christian Arab he's a Christian and he and he did an article some years ago concerning Israel and PAL Annie and versatile Palestinians and he said concerning Jerusalem Israel's right he said to Jerusalem and he an Arab but he's a Christian amen and he's recognizing Israel the called a nation a call of God a man oh yes the seed of Abraham and he's declaring to the whole world Israel got every right to Jerusalem amen and he said really there's no Palestinians why Jordan is a Palestinian country but they don't want the Palestinians in Israel in Jordan they got him there but that they got a certain part of the country there they got to stay in and their own load off that land in a certain hour and today and they got Bundy but they got to be back on it again at night oh yeah two brothers sister that the Israel that's not Palestine or Palestinian country as he's real chosen of God amen God called Abraham he said look see whatever wherever your eyes is he as far as you can see he said I'm gonna give you this land amen brother god help us to recognize and believe what God is doing amen this catch the revelation of what he has done in William Brennan what he has done sir the opening of the seals the revelation of the word and then and the messengers that he ministered after the seals a man swung he would just take the seals and they'll read the seals and that's it well they're reader church age boom that's it no brother you better go on hey man because he AEI later the fact that the third PO was to give it the bride rapturing pay Amy how many are getting into rapturing faith brother there's more caught up and raptured with this world than they are with the word oh yeah if you got a rapture faith you're caught up with the word you're caught up with Jesus you're caught up with the Brian oh that's all you're living for anybody and you're constantly living every day for the change living every day for the resurrection living every day for the rapture oh yeah grace of God amen brother the probably God did say God is gonna let it go on till our faith is challenged not just faith in what God has done but your faith in God oh yeah kind of let it go on and on and on Satan will challenge your faith in God oh you don't believe in God dear that's what faith is hating to do cuz he's the come out of this world amen but people not gonna recognize that as Satan is dealing with them it's just themselves or whatever Satan is using their senses using their their their thoughts and so on oh yeah Satan using their flesh Oh surely you know there's no God well I said well Satan if there's no god why is everything so done so decently and in order any man God has done things decently and in order and as the devildis brought the confusion if the Devils made a mess of it but God permitted it amen but it's going to bring out the faith that we have a man real genuine faith not religious beliefs but a genuine thing the Prophet Oh God again was recognizing they had not truly anumber the people in venom time and I've had not truly overcome no I already read it a number of times because during the statement that he made near the end of the message yeah my lord have mercy on us perish that we're not going to get so just religious and so content with this world I tell you brothers the closer we get to the resurrection rapture the more and more discontented will will be in this world oh yeah we just would just be praying Lord get us that get us out Lord please get it out of here Lord amen Lord grace grace grace amen as again the prophecies you'll go when you want to go amen how many want to go God has given us the word to create in us that faith that wants to go amen the Alpha had it no the Omega got it you want to go don't be content with this world because it done 90 be content with it is everything is so deceiving now politically and mentally and financially everything is deceiving people think this is all right this is our notice not the only ones alright he's God it's his word so we better put the emphasis on that and stay with it amen don't bother him son the natural thing no no no again don't don't sing the line a tenner of cottage why should I care and people do care they do they're not beam honest I don't know who the brother was when he proved when he preached that years ago in a message church he said the biggest lies told her told search cuz he said he says people go in and they say mice hain't me I trust what we're seeing you're singing tonight and as long as everyone it was her faith not your religious feelings any bad not emotion no but it's your faith brother the grace of Almighty God help us amen not to be caught up with this world so you know why because people want this they want that what happened to Noah's house amen what I have to do all that Noah had because I remember the film one time on the flood and and he was sitting talking to his family and his wife said what are we gonna do with the protect the house you know we're gonna put something over the house to protect it from the water no he said just leave with the Lord amen so we want to do this we want to do that we want to build ourselves up we want to get existing you know he exulted and so on oh no no no we're not interested we just want to meet Jesus it's like the prophet of God said I'll introduce you to Jesus and then he said I'll get on my knees and crawl up to touch his people amen how many got that humility everybody we are sinners saved by grace hey man don't boast in this and both are you gonna boast not in yourself you're gonna boast in anyone or anything it's God it's a it's Jesus and it's the revealed Word amen but let's make sure that we are over colors we have overcome the world the flesh the devil any bad or we will become the influence of religious spirits and so on and we're filled with the Holy Ghost double portion of the Holy Ghost and oh my more more and more every day that I get more and more conscious of the rapture anytime now how much longer will it have to go as I said I pray God by grace that we're not we won't be here to ask where is the rapture and you know what he said in the Bible already past you didn't know it yeah no no because if you're you if you're overcomer you got the revelation of the word then brother you can't get away from the revelations rapture no more than no more than Luther could get away from justification he couldn't do it he screamed that morning new tonight as Wesley preached sanctification morning noon and night he he preached at five times a day and so on him when moved on moved on moved on and saying we wouldn't move them and they recognized the decline even in the Salvation Army and and and and even the winning booths dot a white brother she preached one time and she said she see you need to get G you need to start your experience in your closet amen show your experience by clean does applause oh yeah and so of course she went on before or other William Booth went on and and when she was she was laying in her bed she they went and they said how are you feeling oh she said wonderful she said the waters are rising but she said so am i a man she knew where she was going hey man I believe she's she's there waiting on us - hey man cuz the problem of God said God brought the army in to fill in the gap he said between the Methodist revival and dependent cost revival and and I got I got the books their sermons home and where they were preaching and they were saying what we need is why they had on the day of Pentecost oh yeah they're preaching that and not long after it God took them up to Z verse dare come to Pentecost to revival and and and general booth and his wife were pointing to it plenty to it amen yeah he has his granddaughter's hid mine she said she was in a service one time and she said you know this is unusual she's I've never seen never saying and not one service she said in an empty few empty put a alter no he said what no she said every service I was to she's hidden in the experiencing her grandfather and her grandmother and and her father and so on preaching all that she said the altars were full when they gave the altar call always were full yeah well how long did he grant by the breach oh she said he preached for an hour and a half yeah did they were shocked shocked over that especially when the booth preacher hour-and-a-half yeah and when he was going off the scene to I think he was saying that always it oh my ear comes here I'm going and the doctor who's want to give this give that no no no he said I don't want the one I'm going you know he was on your way to glory because he was seeing the other dimension yeah just like that that Amy command that that was a friend of ours and he paid me so tight what tidings one time and he ended up in in the palliative care he was dying he said to his said to his wife and children he said listen he said don't let him give me anything he said I want to go he said I want to go to me Jesus he's how go amen and he was naming him yeah but he had faith it's like he was the one I told you you told told me that he attended the church in Topsail Beach and he said he go down to rock so he said he prayed every day yeah praise the Lord hallelujah he was giving God they're pretty evidence he was an overcomer now that said he used to eat brought he got bribed but he's an old home and you never know because our brother branham told our brother caught Willard Collins concerning his father because he were about his father who was in a certain denominational Church the probably God told him he's learned his thoughts and he said you're thinking about your father and you're worried about your father yes he said brother banham he doesn't recognize the message in this mess brother Brown said no my brother he said Easter lap over from another age so brother we better treat him right cuz there's lap overs from another age god bless them amen God listens brother sister God is not like I said he's not Hitler you know your honor every sincere heart amen and and then God knows whether they accept or reject and he's only going to reveal to this one what the because he wants them on this level and someone else is on this level somebody else on that level but he's not going to be able to them what was only for the bride know hey man the power of God's are you gonna be surprised who made it and surprised it didn't make it most definitely amen I trust by the grace of God amen the God true the Ministry of the word is getting us ready to make it getting us more and more into a rattling condition more more into a resurrection rods reef a brother the resurrection and the rupture that we experience in ourselves that we that were on we know thirsting for it in our bodies yeah Amy go ahead help us brother oh my just started it was verse 23 I believe Luke 9:23 and he said to them all If any man will come after me because I read it let him deny himself take up his cross daily darkness not just once you take up your cross every day Amen and follow me for whoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same will save it amen but you've got to have the right motive and right objective for what is a man advantage if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be cast away grace for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of em show the Son of Man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and it is father's and of the Holy Angels brothers sister or without use he has come in glory amen and in his father's glory and the glory of the Angels what more it was God in simplicity in the Alpha it's God in simplicity in the Omega amen and concerning the pillar of fire the altar of fire this is an ezekiel chapter 2 yeah you want you want that describe you know what to know that this here is biblical you go to Ezekiel chapter 2 I believe it is and he describes this fiery altar that he saw inhibition amen and the powder God say he said he said you see me behind the pulpit but he said I'm not there he's on Brea I'm behind the pulpit further up and that's him right here and most people didn't recognize that all they saw was this year around around the altar and around the pulpit the fire of God amen and then of course we know where we know about the pillar of fire and brother this as the Papa said to that woman it's somebody if you see anything else other than that pillar of fire easy you know you don't see a picture but many are seeing the man burst in the pillar fire second no you got to see a pillar fire pillar fire pillar fire as that sister in the hospital sick and she had that picture on her night table and she looked at the pillar of fire and he and the pillar of fire began to wave and come to order and she was healed yeah and as I told he might have been brother Johnny or somebody that I saw the vision of the pillar of fire and I was trying to reach the pillar of fire but it was everything was all around me was all rocks broken rocks and everything and I was climbing over this climbing over that and up there in India we have totally dark totally dark bright black and out there I saw the pillar fire and I was trying to get to the pillar of fire and I moved and moved and I went down here and got off Hill down here and got up and I climbed over this and I said oh and then I stopped and I looked up to the pillar fire I said Lord I said will I make it I want to make it he said the voice spoke and he said yes son you'll make it but it'll be hard keep pressing on amen oh yeah so I saw the pillar of fire a man thank God there another time I was going to a cottage meeting I looked them in and there was a pillar of fire in the sky I said thank you Laurie hallelujah amen the experiences that I have had the visions that I've had as I said K even considering the coming of the Lord we're climbing the mountain climb and others who were there with me we were climbing the mountain and I looked up and here was oh it was the Lord sitting on the throne the angels were going around all over everywhere I said what's going on over there getting ready for the marriage supper so why that's the marriage supper you're getting ready yeah and then of course he the Angels moved around and Jesus beginning to move back I said oh no no no please please Lord I said don't leave us we need you he said that's all right son and the angel said he will be back I was only in a teenager lying on a bed there there in Hamill Street yeah as I said I fell back I was reading the Bible that I turned around I fell back on the bed and then my all division broke in front in front of me the coming of the Lord how many want really really want to get into the presence of the pillar of fire he's here in this as the pillar fire now and that pillar fires in the bright but it got himself in the bright one with the bright but we're going back to eternity to sit with him in his role as the prophet of God said we're not going to sit on the throne we're sitting in the throne a man so brother and then and the brother that I call him brother that that took this picture he called me and he said oh he said brother he said you got it on your you're the winner better homepage he sounds wandering he said if I could get a copy of it he said I took the picture and he said after I developed it he said I gave it to brother Billy Paul Brennan I said you didn't have he didn't have an original copy no he's her brother he said I gave it all to Billy Paul oh so he said I've wondering he see if you can get me a picture a copy of it I said okay brother I said I'll get you a copy and he gave me his name and address and I called the voice of God and they said yes we'll send you a copy and I sent the copy I got a copy for amen brother he come down Jesus father's glory and the and the angels the glory of the Angels hit me amen he said whosoever shall have a be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory in his father's and of the Oly Oly angels amen brother he's come he's here he's not going to come he's already come they missed they missed his coming in the first stage in that in the Alpha now they missed the Omega coming amen and what the prophet of God what he started here he's going to go on into into the end of the oh yes I think it was the fifth the fifth and the sixth each into into two the Jews went to come with the Gentiles he goes on into the Jews see brother sister in in the Alpha ministry to the Jews then he went to the Gentiles now in the Omega ministry is to the Gentiles now he's going back to the Jews hallelujah perfect perfect God's pattern amen oh no it's not that yeah if he comes is gonna be big and the whole world's gonna see it that's old brother sister sometimes those paintings you know they bring us down but he wants to bring us up to a greater revelation of God not not just the the revelation of the painting no although brother Brown said this was the closest painting that he saw that was like Jesus and he was just looking at the face of Jesus and know that one brother round saw him he never had on that colored clothes I believe maybe he had a white gown on that's right but he said just he went and he had the vision and then he said he ended up going up to Chicago I believe it was and he said I went into her brother's church or home and and he said he had a picture there othman said of Christ and he said I noticed it he said that was the closest he said to that look like Jesus it's not exactly said but it's the closest I've seen and he said he's never never been without one sense yeah he he he had in his house yet it wherever he went he had he had the picture of Hoffman's head of Christ that he saw in the vision he meant to God be the glory so who are you living for what are you living for you reflect that in your life you reflected in your home amen I think the brothers got one picture outside I think or in the Sunday School room word out there that brother Brown said he yeah he had a copy of that picture in his daughter's room and in his son's room bedroom yeah and it's it's an angel watching over two children going across the bridge yeah see it reflects your faith you just can't help it it's just so automatic in you your anger thirst for God you love God amen sure as we love our natural peers sometimes when what we want to have a picture there of my mom and dad a picture there or mama the head I got a picture of brother and sister Manuel brothers sister burns you know and the picture of my father but you're my parents my mother and so on there but I got the picture of Jesus amen hallelujah well that's here it reflects it's your faith you just can't help it you hunger for that you thirst for that you love him so much as I said I'm gonna attract give to transfer to brother Matthew some pictures of Jesus meeting with humans and ask you do you love him this much pray God that it's not religion that's a Holy Ghost experience it's a Holy Ghost thing hallelujah whosoever will save his life in this world shall lose it in the world to come whoever's going to focus on the flesh satisfying the flesh pleasing the flesh oh you won't be there but you're born again you live to satisfy the spirit the new creature not the old one you're not interested in the old one you fight that one every day you do and he said what is a man advantaged of if he gained the whole world and lose himself or be cast away for whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his father's and of the Holy Angels we have witnessed it but I tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till you see the kingdom of God praise the Lord and it came to pass about an eight days after those these Saints he took Peter and John and James and went up into a mountain to pray amen and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glittering amen and Bo there talked with him two men which were Moses and Elijah Elijah who appeared in glory and speak of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem amen brother here Moses and Elijah they knew it where were they where were they as I know there's certain Christians are there they don't believe in and that other dimension they don't believe in theosophy bodies you believe when you're dying you're dead and you're in the graveyard they believe that you know what you know what Scripture they base that on it's in the Old Testament - one verse part of our verses sister did know not anything and I've told those peeps some of those people that believe that certain church there don't look they don't believe in going from here to another dimension no they believe you got to go from here to the graveyard no I said the dead know not anything I said about this world but I said they do know a lot about the world to come I said where did Moses and Elijah come from I said when Jesus met and on the mound Transfiguration I said where did this one come from that one come from so on that Jesus met so on he saw this he saw that they still don't believe they want to believe that verse the founder of that denomination taught taught those things my brother didn't she didn't bring it into in to compare it to the New Testament revelation that if this Tabernacle be dissolved we got one already waiting eternal in the heavens amen and Paul was long easy to cast down this one and to pick up the glorified one he said I want to cast it down you know he's sitting nor play grace of God amen so brother Jesus met Paul and and Elijah bear with me I love you brother - the promise there of that body the disturber neck will be dissolved for we know that if our earthly outs of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven amen for we that are in this tabernacle to grow me burden not that we should be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life amen amen and he said he that wrought us for the South same thing is God who also has given unto us the earnest of the Spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord we walk by faith not by sight and we are confident I say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord now brother this scripture let us say at the Lord and yet they won't believe it yeah brother that's the grace of God in your life and in mine amen that is the testimony of an overcomer Paul had overcome the world the flesh the devil that verse of scripture was in 2nd Corinthians 5 chapter 5 but we're we've overcome by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ I won't be able to get again into the message we'll see amen we need to continue on overcoming because there's less and less that are that are overcoming less and less that have overcome come the world overcome the flesh and overcome the devil so brother sister grace of God to us and God is testing us God's testing us yeah I'll just give you a couple of quotes here and I may have already give it to you but we can we can hear it again to 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Kwan's repeated amen because faith comes by hearing the word the prophet of God said he that cometh to God must first be tested amen tested what he said tested with the word he said that's God's test do you believe it he that cometh to God must be tested and the only you know that only shows a true child and he said when the when the test comes on you can't overcome less there's a test give you you've got to have a test to overcome oh yeah and you pass the test you're an overcomer hallelujah and when a test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not jesus said to him that overcometh the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you to test to see if you're going to overcome to him that overcometh he would give us life eternal and he said our trials are worth more to us than precious gold it's a testing time and one good evidence to us that God is with us when we are tested for all children of God are tested and tried and he gives us the example of Daniel in Babylon and he said Daniel wasn't afraid of the spies when the law went forth that he weren't allowed to pray only to the Babylonian king our God the king but Daniel prayed unto the Lord and he would kneel and he would face Jerusalem and pray didn't matter to him when the spies came and took them before the king and they sentenced him to go into the the lion's den yeah he said David Daniel wouldn't compromise but I tell you there's a lot of people would compromise today rather than rather than go to the test that God wants to test them with the things that God wants to test you with he's testing sometimes his God testing you he allowed this to happen the staff and that to happen and it's a test personal test is between you and God see if you see if you really really want to be a holy ghost overcomer there's a problem was I wasn't saying the prophet of God was seen that there were those in random time Necker that were not overcomers Satan was overcoming them with these thoughts amen not to get him to deny what the the doctrines but get him to be more like the world and when he the way they act the way they dress and so on and their hairstyles yeah I see prophet I was recognizing it here in 1963 oh my don't think because you got along here I'm alright no it's like a father God said you couldn't you could have you could go and be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and be a dead work it is not real old egos fate and you can you can a sister can I belong here but again if you're not going to do it right then the way you go one way God wants you to have it you're going to pattern after the world but people who were all yeah they like this they like that brother you're going to do it for the Lord they like it but don't pattern after then and right and he saw this from downtown tonight and then we thank the Lord that such a bet he was a witness the other day she just has her hair up the same old way but up and bun and we met somebody in a store man his wife and the lady oh she said I like your hair I like that the way you got it yeah they don't see much of that today but that's the old-fashioned way though do you see called the bun or the tire you know brother Ramsay's you don't like the bomb don't like the tire on their head yeah oh yeah and brother get more and more modern god help us that we're not going to be left out brother if there's the Lord and you can love the Lord you'll be willing to do anything for him humble yourself humble yourself humble yourself don't try to exalt yourself stay humble and sometimes it sometimes you're getting modern by the way you dress or the way it or the way you got your hair there sometimes brothers can get modern by the way they dress and so on yeah not Elvis we want to please the Lord not man we love him lovest thou me more than these amen and he talked about Daniel and he said Daniel was the Prophet that was the size of the church in that last day the bride there's lots of church about two million and they went down there but there was the size of the overcomers Daniel was one out of all the other Jews and the three Hebrew children was three out of all the other Jews whereas all the others got down and worship the God that they part they had there but they wouldn't worship but these three Hebrews they wouldn't worship Him no no so they true that they threw them into the into the fire furnace the fire yeah and he did it seven times hotter did they we can't say oh no will will will go worship your God over it no we're not gonna do it and they get they gave them time to make up their mind notice and when I couldn't do it casas into the fire and and the fire was so hot that the ones that cast him in died but when they landed and the King looked down instead of three there was four thank you lord see if you're gonna take your stand in your test he's with you if you don't take your stand he'll move away repentance will bring him back thank God brother set a trap for Daniel and I believe he should the probably Daniel knew that but he wasn't afraid of them spies why live or die he had the victory and therefore there are so much victory to the law and lions couldn't eat it Daniel overcame the lions amen he said Shadrach Meshach Abednego had so much victory unto the lion until the fire rather he said couldn't burn them and he said you know he said victory is a hard thing to burn out a man thank God huh lot victory they were over comers can you imagine how much of over comers were they so that they were standing in the fire but the fire never burned them no they weren't crying they weren't screaming they were just walking around and there was and then came this this this other being there and that was God yeah God came down and walk with him and there a fellowship with God in the fire now sometimes brother in the test we have more fellowship closer fellowship with God then we do when everything has gone good yeah so God God allows things to go not exactly good sometimes but for its to test us and to bring us into a closer relationship with him Amen that's right praise the Lord wonderful he says tired thing to burn out he said it when it comes to being an overcomer and he said they had it he said I might mention another character in the days of lot Jesus referred to there was only three that overcame lot and his two daughters not even his wife didn't overcome she started out but look back he said many of us you had left to many of you would left these things to take your stand after you searched this through the scripture find it's right you see are you seeing the vindication of Almighty God so you set out to leave Sodom leave the denominations leave the things that bind you to accrete and follow Christ by the Holy Spirit vindicate himself by the written word of God in other words you took the Bible instead of the Creed and you set out to follow well he said Lot's wife did the same thing she set out to go with lot follow her husband her children her lovin loved ones but it wasn't in her heart she still loved the world so it's possible that you can make a start and still be the world in you see she never overcome and even though she was well on the road it finally overthrew her she had to take that one big last long last look and there's where she got caught don't even look back don't have no desires keep going put your mind on Calvary keep moving towards Christ but she looked back she was she was all gonna versity for that a man but but her husband locked and our two daughters they did they would they would look back they they believed absolutely completely what the messenger said they took it there was the saying the Lord they weren't going to look back they kept looking ahead and believers not going to look back to the world of things of the world if you love the world you know the world the level of God not in you and there's a lot of believers love the world and they love the things of the world god help us he said keep going put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ see it is that love affair with with Jesus unfortunately not many got that baptism a divine law the Holy Ghost is a divine law and it says anyone you love love the Lord with all your heart and then you'll love the body of Christ because you love God as you love Jesus remember if she started out as an overcomer but she never did overcome oh she left the denomination she did she walked out of Sodom with lot but she wanted to go back and have her hair cut she had to look back again to see what the rest of them was doing that's right oh did you know I have some good friends down there after all that's what she thought but he says after all this might be just a little new I don't know whether it could be right or not I have only got this man's word for it though he's my husband but yet your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking a man many say if you are not perfectly satisfied you're not perfectly know that it's the Word of God then you can't go you've got to be really sold out you have got to know it not just say well I see others doing it I see a sign you know Israel started it out they started out to millions strong and ended up with two men see it wasn't in their heart they didn't overcome they just come out but they never overcome and they perished in the wilderness and are eternally dead he said it means eternal separation he meant and he goes into other examples in the scriptures and the Lord willing we're trying to get to some of them in another message we'll see what the Lord is in mind brother let's make our overcoming sure make our election sure where else to make sure you got your overcome that's making your election sure if you haven't overcome you're not elected know the lengths the elected I've overcome amen by the grace of God they are overcoming the world the flesh the devil so but don't think you're because you're in this church you're overcome No is you in Christ and Christ in you that's what makes us overcome amen it's it's the resurrection and rap for me and me into the revelation think of the resurrection and rapture amen oh brother you're just preaching Resurrection rapture resurrection rapture well why did Luther preached justification justification justification morning dinner night and when they when they called him into to the church council and and they wanted him to change his mind on know he said here I stand I can do no other and they were threatening to put it to kill him well he said here I stand I can do no other he believed it yeah so I know like I said the others just got the revelation of preached and preached and preached and preached it a mass not just occasionally believe it like a creed or it's like I get to total it the young girl that when he drew her grandparent's home and the Bible wandered on the coffee table with dusty and she looked she looked at it and what was in it this was in it that was in it and she she asked if it was a scrapbook she asked her grandma grandmother and grandfather is this your scrapbook and of course I guess they were all offended but but she didn't have the understanding about the rival and so on so she just thought it was a scrapbook because there were so many things in it they would take this but in it they take that and put in it so on paper pictures so on yeah scrapbook brother it's not the scrapbook it's the book of life amen we pray grace that we are identified in this book that I'm in this book that you're in this book if we're overcomers we are if we're not Bibles I'll take your name
