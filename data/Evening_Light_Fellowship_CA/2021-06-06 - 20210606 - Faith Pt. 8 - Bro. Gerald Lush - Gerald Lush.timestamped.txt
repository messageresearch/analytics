[5:42] ain't god good
[5:46] to give us so many blessings and
[5:49] i came across a quote the other day
[5:51] brother branham said that just like the
[5:53] centurion he said if
[5:55] if you feel unworthy about the blessing
[5:57] that you're asking for he said you're
[5:59] more apt to get it
[6:01] so humility is that approach to god
[6:03] isn't it

[6:06] undeserving that's what we are

[31:32] hallelujah
[31:34] hallelujah
[31:36] praise the name of the lord amen i trust
[31:38] we really mean it amen amen it's not
[31:41] just being religious that's right oh no
[31:44] it's being spiritual amen by the grace
[31:46] of god
[31:47] so i trust that we really mean and
[31:50] really put our hearts into what we're
[31:51] seeing and what we're thinking and what
[31:53] we're praying amen amen amen don't come
[31:56] in here with the thoughts out there
[31:58] leave that leave that behind you
[32:00] amen to know this that is again the
[32:03] prophet reminded us the first one in
[32:04] church is the devil that's right
[32:07] oh yes he's the first one so he's easier
[32:09] to catch shoes here to catch young or
[32:11] old amen to make us negative amen just
[32:15] to put our faith down and put our
[32:17] religion up amen just be just just be
[32:20] religious just sing
[32:21] and and you can do this you can do that
[32:23] yeah but make sure it's in the spirit
[32:26] make sure it's in the holy ghost amen
[32:28] not the on holy ghost amen so remember
[32:31] satan is here and he he knows the word
[32:34] sure yeah god said right from the
[32:36] beginning amen he knew the word in
[32:38] genesis and he definitely definitely
[32:40] knows the word in revelation
[32:42] amen right down to the end of time and
[32:45] again he's come down with the bible says
[32:46] come down with great wrath
[32:49] knowing his time is short amen amen so
[32:52] we pray the grace of god that we got we
[32:54] got wisdom amen but again robert
[32:57] preached on wisdom versus faith amen but
[33:00] it's not intellectual wisdom we have
[33:02] spiritual wisdom it's in our souls amen
[33:06] but the the devil is still there oh yeah
[33:08] he knows what he knows what the same he
[33:11] knew he knew the message that god gave
[33:12] adam and eve
[33:14] and he knows the message that god has
[33:15] given us amen he said to them yeah if
[33:18] god said but and again he's saying to a
[33:20] lot of believers yeah as god said but
[33:23] amen just say get behind me satan i
[33:25] don't need your butts
[33:26] amen by the grace of god but he's there
[33:29] and and unfortunately there's many a
[33:31] believer that's that's believed the
[33:33] butts
[33:34] amen and again oh yeah i believe the
[33:36] message but again you've got to
[33:37] understand too that he only changed one
[33:39] word for eve amen but she believed them
[33:42] she made man he caused her to doubt
[33:44] and and go on oh yeah we're going to
[33:47] believe god or the devil
[33:49] amen in these last days who are we
[33:51] believing god or satan because god
[33:53] through the word through the message of
[33:55] a prophet he's laid it in what has
[33:57] happened and what is happening and what
[33:59] will happen and warning us that it's
[34:01] going to get worse
[34:02] oh yeah more deceiving so we're praying
[34:05] by the grace of god that we're going to
[34:06] have the simplicity of faith just to
[34:08] stay with the word
[34:09] amen and not necessarily understanding
[34:12] everything but it's believing what god
[34:14] has said and believing what god has done
[34:16] and believe what god is doing by the
[34:18] grace of god amen so god help us as we
[34:21] go into what he wants us to go into and
[34:23] that's his word amen come back to the
[34:27] word stay with the word know what the
[34:29] word said
[34:31] if you want to defeat the enemy
[34:32] defeating with the word
[34:34] amen that's our weapon amen but again
[34:39] of course the word is
[34:41] is activated by faith
[34:43] amen and do we have the kind of faith
[34:45] that god recognizes god is going to
[34:47] bless
[34:48] and do we have the evil yes even the
[34:50] kind of faith the devil recognizes
[34:52] amen and he he knows it and that's why
[34:55] that he's attempting to to change it
[34:58] that's why he's attempting to get you to
[34:59] believe it little air little there and
[35:01] so on oh yeah oh brothers is getting
[35:04] worse and worse and worse amen and just
[35:06] think after all that god did and after
[35:09] all that god revealed and you know when
[35:11] that sister asked the prophet and they
[35:14] oh uh what would you do or something
[35:16] like that if god actually gluten and pic
[35:18] pick the bride of christ she'll pick the
[35:20] believers out of this generation for the
[35:22] rapture oh
[35:24] and he oh my he said i might find a
[35:26] dozen
[35:27] why
[35:28] we got more than a dozen here
[35:30] so
[35:31] do we have the faith that god is looking
[35:33] for in
[35:34] in the dozen
[35:36] of do we have the faith that god is
[35:37] looking for in his seed in the last days
[35:41] and truly we are in the last days amen
[35:44] so please don't ignore it don't forget
[35:46] it
[35:46] and don't allow what what we want here
[35:49] in our flesh to overcome what god wants
[35:51] amen we're going to give
[35:54] preeminence not not to again our
[35:56] feelings even though they're sometimes
[35:58] religious but no we gotta have have the
[36:00] spiritual revelation of what god is
[36:03] doing
[36:04] amen we know what he did and so on and
[36:06] god bless what he did but now he's
[36:09] looking for something that that it's a
[36:10] present tense amen praise the lord so i
[36:14] pray grace to help us as we get go again
[36:16] into the word brother that we will truly
[36:18] have a true anointing that we'll truly
[36:21] have a holy ghost anointing amen amen
[36:24] and be careful be on your guard because
[36:26] the devil is there and he can anoint you
[36:28] yeah well he anointed eve
[36:30] and caused her to believe what he said
[36:32] amen so brother pray grace that we're
[36:35] they're coming here under the anointing
[36:36] of the holy ghost
[36:38] it's the anointing of christ in us the
[36:41] hope of glory amen by the grace of god
[36:43] that's what keeps us moving on moving on
[36:45] moving on amen do this do this no just
[36:49] go on and praise the lord amen to god be
[36:52] the glory
[36:53] amen so i pray grace as we get again
[36:56] into the word and into some more
[36:58] thoughts that i want to share with you
[37:00] regarding faith
[37:02] i was i figured maybe that in the last
[37:04] message we would finish it
[37:05] but again i i could have stopped and
[37:08] went on again maybe but uh to another
[37:11] subject but again it's
[37:14] it's been really on my heart
[37:16] and in my mind and my soul for quite a
[37:18] while and can't seem to back away from
[37:20] it because god wants to reveal this god
[37:23] wants us to know this and god wants us
[37:25] to know that amen so the lord has
[37:28] anointed me and he's been that put that
[37:30] burden on me amen to continue with the
[37:33] thoughts on faith amen and again this
[37:36] could be the conclusion of it i don't
[37:37] know but again we want to leave it with
[37:39] with with the lord
[37:41] amen because again
[37:43] i believe it's significant
[37:45] because the bible challenges our faith
[37:49] god challenges our faith believe us thou
[37:52] this amen and he and he challenge them
[37:55] with this challenge with that
[37:57] believers though this what about peter's
[37:58] faith and
[38:00] when he went when he walked under water
[38:03] well on my computer there that comes up
[38:05] that
[38:06] screensaver there pictures and i see one
[38:08] there of peter and jesus
[38:12] on the waters peter's in the water
[38:15] jesus is underwater as a lord i said oh
[38:18] no i said uber painted that good but i
[38:21] said he failed to recognize one thing
[38:24] because he had he had the painting of
[38:25] jesus there as if jesus was nervous
[38:29] and i said lord i said you're not
[38:30] nervous
[38:32] you created it it's under your control
[38:35] and and he should have been just relaxed
[38:37] in in the picture and walking
[38:40] because why even over there was peter
[38:42] done in the water and he was reaching
[38:44] out to peter to get him back up amen so
[38:47] i pray grace brother oh my see again
[38:50] that all due respect to the painter and
[38:52] god bless him or whoever it was
[38:55] amen but again there was a lack of that
[38:57] complete revelation that jesus wasn't
[39:00] nervous jesus knew he he wasn't going to
[39:04] sink into the water like peter did and
[39:06] he's not there watching himself oh oh oh
[39:09] that's the way that i what i saw under
[39:11] in the painting i said lord that's not
[39:13] what you wanted
[39:14] i said jesus walked on that like we
[39:16] would walk on the carpet here
[39:18] yeah or we would walk out there in the
[39:20] streets somewhere amen not nervous not
[39:22] afraid that we're going to stumble no no
[39:25] not by any means so i pray grace that
[39:27] we're going to have the real faith
[39:29] amen and again what is the real faith it
[39:32] is the faith that has no questions
[39:34] and has no doubt amen amen it believes
[39:38] god that's right this is absolutely
[39:40] tremendous for you to go out and do this
[39:42] or you either go ahead and do that amen
[39:44] you why because it's your faith you're
[39:46] believing god you're not worrying about
[39:48] the devil amen as
[39:51] one of the brethren brought out sometime
[39:52] regarding the challenge of satan just
[39:56] obviously he said just tell the devil
[39:57] the word amen quote the word go on
[40:00] amen so i pray the grace of god that we
[40:02] got we got more power over satan than
[40:05] satan got over us
[40:07] by the grace of god amen lord bless us

[48:53] lord brother that that it's not just the
[48:55] the the
[48:57] religion out there no no
[48:59] because they got they got the writings
[49:00] of

[49:03] writings of them in a book and
[49:06] well that to them it's a bible like this
[49:08] one is to us amen but they but again
[49:12] what with the one that they're believing
[49:14] is still in the grave

[49:18] that that daily constantly there's
[49:21] somebody outside the grave on their
[49:23] guard oh yeah and then they did it then
[49:26] next some more comes in and fills in the
[49:28] more coming to fill in yeah but the
[49:30] power of god said well he said he's
[49:32] still there but he said the grave that
[49:34] we we remember is empty amen that's
[49:36] right amen he said jesus is not in the
[49:39] grave
[49:40] praise the name of the lord hallelujah i
[49:42] pray you're not in the grave spiritually
[49:45] amen that you're alive amen and god and
[49:48] god is in control

[49:52] you can go out and brother amen
[49:55] not talk it
[49:56] go and live it amen the power and the
[49:59] anointing of the holy ghost in me that's
[50:01] who's living the life
[50:03] why is it that oh
[50:05] you you reflect some of these things
[50:06] that are written in this book and i said
[50:09] yeah why because you are the seed of god
[50:12] amen through the word praise the lord
[50:15] it's like the brother wrote me and he
[50:16] said oh he said i don't believe the
[50:19] bible he said i read it three times and
[50:22] he said it's full of mistakes
[50:24] and i did as i said i wrote back and
[50:27] and say well i said god wrote his bible
[50:29] in a way i said to bring it what's in
[50:31] you
[50:32] amen god wrote in such a way to bring
[50:34] out what's in the believer the
[50:35] make-believer the unbeliever amen oh
[50:37] yeah so
[50:39] they can read it and the devil will show
[50:40] them and they all the wrong believers or
[50:44] they'll read and the devil will show
[50:45] them this and they'll add this take away
[50:47] this and yeah and they're they're make
[50:49] believers amen so this as the proud of
[50:52] god said there's three kinds of
[50:54] believers and he's the true holy ghost
[50:56] believer a make-believer and an
[50:58] unbeliever amen and he referred to them
[51:01] those other ones not the believer but to
[51:04] the make-believers he said they're judas
[51:06] tyrion's pretended brothers amen
[51:09] so i pray the grace of god that we're
[51:11] not in a pretended brotherhood
[51:14] amen we're in the holy ghost brotherhood
[51:16] amen so that we have we have we both had
[51:18] the same life
[51:20] the same hunger the same thirst the same
[51:23] love for the word of god and for god oh
[51:26] yes by the grace of god so god help us
[51:29] as we will endeavor to go to the word
[51:31] and bring forth some more thoughts
[51:33] regarding faith and it's absolutely
[51:36] amazing
[51:37] yeah it's amazing
[51:40] it's amazing that we still have this
[51:41] book
[51:43] it's amazing oh that brother as it was
[51:46] in the beginning so it is in the end
[51:47] faith comes by hearing the word amen
[51:51] there's no other place for to find the
[51:53] faith that pleases god but only in this
[51:55] book
[51:56] amen that i believe
[51:58] as i challenged that brother and i said
[51:59] this this this this so i said are you a
[52:02] believer or a make-believer

[52:19] faith it's in your heart amen by the
[52:21] grace of god
[52:23] faith

[52:27] complete trust in god and in his word
[52:30] amen no question no doubt
[52:33] amen faith answers all questions
[52:36] and dissolves all doubt amen amen praise
[52:39] the lord so in luke chapter 24 and let's
[52:43] begin to read it verse 13.
[52:46] amen
[52:49] and pilate
[52:51] when
[52:52] he had called to gather the chief
[52:55] priests
[52:56] and the rulers of the people
[52:59] saith unto them ye have brought this man
[53:02] unto me as one that perverteth the
[53:05] people
[53:06] and behold i have examined him before
[53:09] you
[53:10] have found no fault in this man touching
[53:13] those things whereof ye accuse him
[53:16] no
[53:18] nor yet arid for i sent you to him and
[53:21] lo nothing worthy of death is done unto
[53:23] him
[53:25] i will therefore chastise him and
[53:27] release him
[53:28] grace
[53:30] for of necessity he must release one
[53:33] unto them at the feast
[53:35] and they cried out all at once saying
[53:38] away with this man
[53:41] and release unto us barabbas
[53:45] who for a certain sedition made in the
[53:47] city and for murder was cast into the
[53:50] prison
[53:51] but pilate therefore
[53:54] willing to release jesus spake again to
[53:56] them
[53:58] but they cried saying crucify him
[54:01] crucify him and he said unto them the
[54:04] third time
[54:05] why
[54:06] what evil hath eat done
[54:09] amen
[54:10] grace of god
[54:13] i have found no cause of death in him
[54:16] i will therefore chastise him and let
[54:19] him go
[54:21] grace
[54:23] and they were instant with loud voices
[54:26] requiring that he might be crucified and
[54:29] the voices of them and of the chief
[54:31] priests prevailed
[54:33] grace
[54:35] and pilate
[54:37] gave sentence that it should be as they
[54:39] required
[54:41] and he released unto them him that was
[54:44] that forced sedition and murder was cast
[54:47] into prison
[54:48] whom they had desired but he delivered
[54:51] jesus to their will
[54:54] brother
[54:56] brother let's not focus on yeah oh the
[54:59] on caesar's law
[55:01] you could do this and they could do that
[55:02] yeah
[55:03] but let's focus on the law of god amen
[55:08] and as they led him away
[55:10] they laid upon
[55:12] one simon a cyrenian coming out of the
[55:15] country and on him they laid the cross
[55:18] that he might bear it after jesus
[55:23] and there followed him a great company
[55:25] of people and of women which also be
[55:28] wailed and lamented him amen god bless
[55:31] this word your baby seated and turn with
[55:34] me to the book of john
[55:35] chapter 5.
[55:38] amen
[55:42] considering all that the scripture
[55:44] expounds concerning faith we could go we
[55:47] could minister on and on and on for a
[55:49] long long time but i believe we can
[55:51] start on it and go on into the glory
[55:53] preaching the same thing
[55:55] amen and i'll i'll highlight some of
[55:57] those things to you concerning faith
[56:00] and and the preeminence of faith as in
[56:03] the word of god amen
[56:05] because considering the the preemis of
[56:07] faith as in the purpose of god the plan
[56:10] of god amen if there's anything in his
[56:13] purpose his plan or his pattern that god
[56:15] is looking for is faith
[56:17] amen so do we have the faith that
[56:19] pleases god amen he had the faith that
[56:22] pleased the devil
[56:24] amen how many of us got the faith that
[56:26] pleases god it's not
[56:28] what i want is what god wants amen and
[56:32] again not what not what the devil wants
[56:35] we want what god wants
[56:36] it's getting giving the preeminence to
[56:38] god it is a preemis giving yeah we're
[56:41] giving preeminence to his word we're
[56:43] giving preeminence to his his plan amen
[56:47] and his pattern that's why we're here
[56:49] because why because out there we were
[56:51] caught in that and we were not caught up
[56:53] in a revelation of the plan of god or
[56:55] the purpose of god just religion amen
[56:58] and man was getting the glory out of man
[57:00] amen get more and more and more added to
[57:03] the church
[57:04] but jesus i tell you this brother when
[57:06] jesus started
[57:08] to him he had too many
[57:10] how many preachers feel like they got
[57:11] too many
[57:13] but jesus felt he had too many and he
[57:14] and that's why brother he knew who knew
[57:16] what was going to happen when he when he
[57:18] said this and he said that and when he
[57:20] said except you eat the flesh of the son
[57:21] of man and drink his blood you've got no
[57:23] life in you amen and i did 70 or 80 of
[57:26] his disciples walked back
[57:28] they said who can receive this just
[57:30] consider now the signs and the wonders
[57:32] and the power that jesus gave them to go
[57:34] do this go do that and they did it amen
[57:37] but when they came back and giving the
[57:39] glory to god amen and jesus
[57:42] challenged their faith amen and god is
[57:44] challenging our faith amen and then the
[57:48] oh yeah probably god said any faith is
[57:50] tested he says it's going to produce
[57:52] goods
[57:53] amen any faith that's tested is going to
[57:56] be revealed it's going to manifest
[57:58] itself in your life amen praise the lord
[58:01] and amen god is going to be able to show
[58:03] the world look there's faith
[58:06] that that that brother he got faith that
[58:08] sister she got faith amen gracious lord
[58:11] that we have the faith that pleases god
[58:14] amen not the faith that praises religion
[58:16] not the faith that pleases the just the
[58:18] the pastor amen or the minister it's the
[58:21] faith that pleases god amen so brother
[58:24] without no wonder the bible says without
[58:26] faith we can't please him
[58:28] we got to have faith and again the faith
[58:31] that he that he reveals amen and brother
[58:34] why is god revealing this why is god
[58:36] revealing that because we're going to
[58:37] give you the faith that will bring you
[58:39] closer to him
[58:40] amen your relationship with him and his
[58:43] relationship with you is becoming
[58:45] greater and greater because of the faith
[58:47] you have amen amen again that's why the
[58:50] way it says without faith it is
[58:52] impossible to please him
[58:54] amen so i trust we have the faith this
[58:57] morning that pleases god
[58:59] amen to god be the glory
[59:02] amen
[59:04] john was it chapter 5 and let's begin it
[59:07] read verse 39
[59:12] amen god help us to do this
[59:16] search the scriptures
[59:18] for in them ye think ye have eternal
[59:21] life
[59:22] and they are they
[59:24] which bear witness of me
[59:27] amen bear witness of jesus
[59:30] and he will not come to me that ye might
[59:34] have life
[59:35] i receive not honor from men
[59:38] but i know you that ye have not the love
[59:41] of god in you
[59:43] brother jesus challenging their faith
[59:48] i am come in my father's name and you
[59:50] receive me not
[59:52] if another shall come in his own name
[59:55] and ye will receive
[59:57] oh yeah they recognize this ministry
[59:59] that ministry we want him we want him we
[1:00:01] want jesus
[1:00:02] and jesus used that ministry that's fine
[1:00:04] praise the lord but let's give the glory
[1:00:06] to jesus not to the ministry amen amen
[1:00:09] that's right brother praise the lord
[1:00:11] amen
[1:00:13] and he said ye
[1:00:16] will not have come to me that ye might
[1:00:19] have life
[1:00:20] brother and anything we're looking for
[1:00:22] now is eternal life
[1:00:24] amen and then we're looking for no
[1:00:26] brother is not religion it's the
[1:00:28] revelation of the rapture amen that's
[1:00:31] taken us out of time and into eternity
[1:00:34] amen that we're leaving time and brother
[1:00:36] i tell you as we get close to that hour
[1:00:39] that that the bible warns us off the end
[1:00:40] of all things
[1:00:42] eternity is going to get more and more
[1:00:44] real to us
[1:00:45] amen and we're going to have less and
[1:00:47] less and less interest in time
[1:00:50] and more interest in eternity but i tell
[1:00:52] you this when it comes to concerning the
[1:00:54] rapture and and the resurrection
[1:00:57] unfortunately brother sister there's
[1:00:59] going to be a lot of believers a lot of
[1:01:00] people out there brother and and they're
[1:01:02] so caught up with this world and they're
[1:01:04] enjoying this world they're enjoying
[1:01:05] this i do this i do that
[1:01:07] no they're not focusing on him they're
[1:01:09] not focusing on jesus they're not
[1:01:10] focusing on the resurrection they're not
[1:01:12] focusing on the rapture amen and
[1:01:14] remember again to go to go in the
[1:01:16] rapture to get out of there we got to
[1:01:18] want to go
[1:01:19] amen and brother god whatever god has as
[1:01:22] ordained down through the ages he has
[1:01:24] given man whether in luther's age
[1:01:26] westernization of pentecostal age it was
[1:01:28] a hunger and thirst for a greater
[1:01:30] relationship with god amen
[1:01:33] they they want they wanted the oh to
[1:01:35] know god they wanted to love god amen so
[1:01:37] god did this and god did that amen but
[1:01:40] eventually just became formal and just
[1:01:42] religious but not spiritual amen because
[1:01:45] god is looking for spiritual sons and
[1:01:47] daughters of god amen so we're not
[1:01:49] interested in this world well i don't oh
[1:01:51] you can get caught up with your job oh
[1:01:53] yeah i i oh this is good lord uh would
[1:01:56] you delay your coming for another day uh
[1:01:58] so so i can i can do this oh yeah
[1:02:02] that's been on my heart for for quite a
[1:02:04] while i said the attitude of the spirit
[1:02:06] that people got because they're so
[1:02:07] caught up with the world oh oh lord no
[1:02:10] no no i i i can't go
[1:02:12] next week i can't go until may maybe the
[1:02:15] end of the year
[1:02:16] oh yes it's hard to believe that that
[1:02:18] people would have that that idea oh yes
[1:02:20] they do they they have that opinion and
[1:02:23] that feeling amen they they want it in
[1:02:26] their time not in god's time no wonder
[1:02:28] again the prophet of god said god is
[1:02:30] waiting on us amen amen wait what
[1:02:33] waiting for that revelation to take
[1:02:35] preeminence in our lives
[1:02:37] amen that morning noon and night we
[1:02:39] can't get away from it the resurrection
[1:02:41] the resurrection the rapture amen and we
[1:02:43] have a picture out here that i
[1:02:46] took out of a magazine that certain
[1:02:48] brother was was was printing amen and
[1:02:51] there in in the picture amen there's two
[1:02:53] brothers sitting in a room one looking
[1:02:56] at a window and the other one said he'd
[1:02:58] sit down with his bible in his hand
[1:03:00] yeah that's that's the drawing that they
[1:03:02] did and the question is they said how
[1:03:05] are you looking for the rapture
[1:03:08] amen and oh
[1:03:11] that man was there with a pair of
[1:03:13] binoculars and he was looking out the
[1:03:14] window what was he looking for rapture
[1:03:17] amen he's going to miss it
[1:03:19] amen but the other brother he was
[1:03:21] sitting down reading his bible what was
[1:03:23] he looking for the rapture
[1:03:25] amen amen why because the bible is going
[1:03:28] to reveal to us that you know the
[1:03:30] rapture how's god going to do it when is
[1:03:32] god going to do it amen by what means
[1:03:35] what will he use
[1:03:36] to to get us into the rapture amen by
[1:03:40] the grace of god to bring forth and
[1:03:41] again let us say it again the prophet of
[1:03:44] god said he said the dead are waiting on
[1:03:46] us
[1:03:47] amen god is waiting on us that's the
[1:03:49] truth but too many are being caught up
[1:03:52] with the world and the things of the
[1:03:54] world and brother that's that's why we
[1:03:56] are exhorted there in in the epistle of
[1:03:59] john
[1:04:01] bear with me
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] it said right here in yeah first john
[1:04:07] and it says love not the world neither
[1:04:09] the things that are in the world and if
[1:04:12] any man love the world the love of the
[1:04:14] father is not in him amen and it is
[1:04:17] loving what you're doing is loving what
[1:04:19] you can do it's loving that you can go
[1:04:21] do this you can go do that oh yeah
[1:04:24] and it's not not necessarily sinful
[1:04:26] but it's challenging your faith
[1:04:29] oh yeah you can get you'll be caught up
[1:04:31] in this caught up in that out there in
[1:04:32] the world and it's not really sinful or
[1:04:34] anything like that but it is entering
[1:04:36] your faith
[1:04:37] and your and your and it's what does it
[1:04:39] do it's trying to get you more cut out
[1:04:41] with this and with this and with this
[1:04:44] rather than the resurrection of the
[1:04:45] rapture brother to be caught up with the
[1:04:47] resurrection rapture you've got to be in
[1:04:49] contact with another dimension
[1:04:51] amen you've got to be under control by
[1:04:54] the anointing and power that's in
[1:04:56] another dimension by the grace of god
[1:04:58] what dimension was jesus in that he oh i
[1:05:01] can't stay no longer with you i got to
[1:05:02] go brother he had such a power there
[1:05:04] such a revelation such a faith in that
[1:05:07] flesh that he was in
[1:05:09] oh yeah
[1:05:10] he wasn't he wasn't caught up with
[1:05:11] what's going on in the world he was cut
[1:05:13] out what was going on in that other
[1:05:14] dimension amen and he oh he felt the
[1:05:17] pool back to eternity
[1:05:19] yeah he felt the blow back to eternity
[1:05:23] and who can't go up he said but he that
[1:05:24] came down even he that is in heaven that
[1:05:28] was himself he was going to go he wanted
[1:05:30] to get back to that to that
[1:05:32] body amen that he was in praise the lord
[1:05:35] representing amen it's ministry to you
[1:05:37] and me to redeem us
[1:05:39] amen and brother hallelujah he was
[1:05:42] focusing on the word the word the word
[1:05:44] what god
[1:05:45] was
[1:05:46] promising and prophesying amen and he
[1:05:49] knew he was approaching that hour when
[1:05:51] he would get out of here back to
[1:05:52] eternity
[1:05:53] but he also knew that but he would
[1:05:55] suffer
[1:05:56] amen but how how about you and me
[1:06:00] amen are we as conscious of eternity as
[1:06:03] jesus was amen are we as conscious of
[1:06:06] the resurrection rapture as jesus was
[1:06:08] amen
[1:06:10] he knew i i come to do this and then i'm
[1:06:12] going back home and he was getting near
[1:06:15] the end of his ministry getting to that
[1:06:16] place amen where oh he would fulfill
[1:06:19] what he was ordained to do to redeem us
[1:06:22] amen
[1:06:23] and brother and the believers have after
[1:06:25] that the believers amen we're fulfilling
[1:06:28] what they were ordained to do to take
[1:06:29] their stand for the word amen and laid
[1:06:31] their lives down for the word amen as
[1:06:34] jesus laid his life down for them now we
[1:06:37] lay our lives down for the word
[1:06:39] amen so you're not living for yourself
[1:06:42] you're living for the word amen this is
[1:06:45] the word because we're living in this
[1:06:46] day we're living in this hour amen by
[1:06:49] the grace of god oh yeah we see this
[1:06:51] going on in the world oh praise the lord
[1:06:53] well you know what the world thinks oh
[1:06:56] oh the lord's coming
[1:06:58] the lord is coming
[1:06:59] what what do you mean oh yeah he
[1:07:01] promised he'd come back again and we see
[1:07:03] all these signs yes but it's a sign of
[1:07:06] the resurrection and the rapture
[1:07:08] amen amen
[1:07:11] and now it is christ in the bride
[1:07:15] but for to bring to pass the
[1:07:16] resurrection and the rapture
[1:07:18] amen so brother
[1:07:21] for the elect of god the seed of god as
[1:07:24] it was with jesus so it is with christ
[1:07:26] in our flesh that we hunger and thirst
[1:07:29] for the resurrection well we can't get
[1:07:31] away from it we want to we want the
[1:07:32] rapture
[1:07:33] amen we want to get out of here into
[1:07:36] time where there is no more sin
[1:07:40] amen we want to get into that dimension
[1:07:42] where there is nothing negative
[1:07:45] everything is positive amen and the love
[1:07:47] is genuine
[1:07:49] oh yeah it's not a put on it's a real
[1:07:51] genuine love
[1:07:52] by the grace of god
[1:07:54] amen he loved us
[1:07:56] and he oh yeah this is the kind of love
[1:07:58] he wanted to get in us amen and because
[1:08:01] of what he did and the revelation of
[1:08:02] jesus the revelation of god amen doing
[1:08:04] this doing this doing that amen is
[1:08:07] producing in the broad a love for him
[1:08:10] we love you jesus
[1:08:13] and it struck me a couple days ago i was
[1:08:15] thinking about it
[1:08:18] i said lord
[1:08:19] forgive us
[1:08:21] forgive us lord not considering what you
[1:08:24] did for us
[1:08:27] now considering what you endured for us
[1:08:30] oh my lord don't don't let us take it
[1:08:32] for granted oh yeah i'm saved because
[1:08:33] jesus did this did that
[1:08:35] oh but he did it to challenge our faith
[1:08:38] and he did it that way to bring forth
[1:08:41] his plan in your life his purpose in
[1:08:43] your life his pattern in your life to
[1:08:44] bring forth love
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:48] brother and that's why he's doing it for
[1:08:49] you and me bring forth love amen as he
[1:08:53] loved us so we would love him
[1:08:56] amen and again love not the world
[1:09:00] neither the things that are in the world
[1:09:03] and if any man love the world and the
[1:09:04] love of the father is not in it the
[1:09:06] world and the things in the world amen
[1:09:09] or you can say well it's not this is not
[1:09:11] sinful no there's nothing wrong with
[1:09:12] that yes
[1:09:13] the only thing wrong with that is that
[1:09:15] it can enter you from getting into
[1:09:16] rapture
[1:09:17] that's the only thing wrong with it
[1:09:19] and amen you're getting caught up with
[1:09:21] these these things going on in the world
[1:09:23] and you can do this you can do that amen
[1:09:25] oh yeah anything they're doing is doing
[1:09:27] to do to
[1:09:28] get your
[1:09:30] fellowship to get your your love for
[1:09:32] that all your attention
[1:09:34] you're distracting it from jesus or to
[1:09:36] all that's going on oh yeah praise the
[1:09:39] lord if you're doing this they're doing
[1:09:40] that amen
[1:09:42] thank god for the witness that we have
[1:09:43] had with i don't know their names now
[1:09:45] but

[1:09:51] were singers here in newfoundland some
[1:09:52] years ago
[1:09:55] and a number of years ago we dealt with
[1:09:57] them and we have fellowship with them
[1:09:59] and eventually of course his wife died
[1:10:02] many many years ago but i remember going
[1:10:05] visiting him one time and and we came
[1:10:08] out

[1:10:41] communion with them not communion but i
[1:10:43] have fellowship with them amen and we're
[1:10:45] discussing certain things at the time at
[1:10:47] that time of the year it was something
[1:10:49] the world was getting cut out with
[1:10:50] everybody's getting caught up with yes
[1:10:52] it is it is and he said pastor
[1:10:54] he said i agree with you he said i'm not
[1:10:57] getting caught up with that
[1:10:58] he said to me that's that's that's
[1:11:00] worldliness amen oh god rest his soul
[1:11:03] wherever he is amen so brother i trust
[1:11:07] by grace where that they not they didn't

[1:11:10] going on in the world and get attracted
[1:11:12] to oh we got to go here i would like to
[1:11:13] be part of this and part of that yeah no
[1:11:16] brother if you're a seed of god

[1:11:37] look into the word i find that more and
[1:11:39] more and more of the word is being
[1:11:41] fulfilled more and more of the word is
[1:11:43] coming to pass amen so i pray grace lord
[1:11:46] that we're going to be on our guard amen
[1:11:48] for the resurrection we're going to be

[1:11:56] through the message of the hours to give
[1:11:58] us that perfect faith that's right amen
[1:12:00] that's not caught up with the world but
[1:12:02] it's caught up with what god is doing
[1:12:05] amen that we're more caught up with that
[1:12:08] more more sensitive to the resurrection
[1:12:10] more sensitive to the rapture than we
[1:12:12] are to the foolishness of this world
[1:12:14] amen and like i said there's a lot of
[1:12:16] things you could get involved over there
[1:12:17] not necessarily sinful
[1:12:19] but if i'll tell you this it's the devil
[1:12:21] amen distracting you from what god's
[1:12:23] doing
[1:12:24] amen and he knows what to do like he
[1:12:28] knew what to do with eve oh yeah when he

[1:12:46] but i say unto you and so on amen and
[1:12:49] now satan is in this hour and brother
[1:12:51] it's not just trying to get you out
[1:12:52] there into into absolute sinful things
[1:12:55] no
[1:12:56] just right now it's just trying to just
[1:12:58] to distract you from what god's doing
[1:13:01] to what you can get involved in
[1:13:03] you can do this you can do that
[1:13:05] get there behind me satan you can do
[1:13:07] that amen amen praise the lord amen but
[1:13:11] god through the word is looking for our
[1:13:13] full attention
[1:13:15] oh yeah now give half of it to god and
[1:13:17] then oh
[1:13:19] i'll do the rest no it's got god in
[1:13:21] control completely
[1:13:23] amen
[1:13:24] god in control morning noon and night
[1:13:27] amen jesus was our example
[1:13:30] amen he came and lived that life
[1:13:32] amen not just to lay it down but he
[1:13:34] wanted to live that life so you'll know
[1:13:36] what god's requiring of the life you
[1:13:38] live
[1:13:39] amen and then he went and laid it down
[1:13:41] to redeem us and brother it's like i
[1:13:44] said it struck me i said oh lord you did
[1:13:46] that to redeem me
[1:13:50] lord
[1:13:51] please there's too many takes for
[1:13:53] granted
[1:13:55] there's too many lord it takes them too
[1:13:56] lightly
[1:13:57] i said how many are really getting into
[1:13:59] the revelation of redemption and what
[1:14:02] and the price that jesus paid for us
[1:14:05] the pain he endured
[1:14:07] the agony he went through
[1:14:09] it was for you
[1:14:10] again it's just like our i heard our
[1:14:12] brother green preaching one time and and
[1:14:15] he was talking about you know
[1:14:17] who crucified the lord
[1:14:19] where are those that did it
[1:14:21] and he said he walked
[1:14:23] somewhere and he went down some steps
[1:14:25] and he saw on the side there was a
[1:14:26] mirror and he saw himself in the mirror
[1:14:29] oh
[1:14:30] he said that's who crucified the lord
[1:14:33] yeah we want to blame this one blame
[1:14:35] that one brother he did it for you
[1:14:38] amen he did it for me and i said lord
[1:14:40] you you endured that that agony that
[1:14:43] suffering that pain
[1:14:44] and that death to redeem me
[1:14:47] my god have mercy on me
[1:14:50] i said lord forgive me
[1:14:52] brother that's why the bible encourages
[1:14:54] us to identify with him
[1:14:56] in his suffering
[1:14:58] yeah we thank god for what he did now
[1:15:00] lord we want to identify with you
[1:15:03] what you did

[1:15:13] the devils are distracted in this world
[1:15:15] and in this dimension amen but jesus is
[1:15:18] there to get us out of this dimension
[1:15:19] and into another one
[1:15:21] and that's when we're really going to
[1:15:22] have the eternal divine love of god as i
[1:15:25] said oh my to get into that realm where
[1:15:28] there's no more sin and there's no more
[1:15:30] nothing negative
[1:15:32] nothing
[1:15:33] no
[1:15:34] now we're not not just caught up with
[1:15:35] this cut out with that now we're caught
[1:15:36] up with eternity we're caught up with
[1:15:38] god caught up with the seed of god for
[1:15:40] the glory of god amen so where's your
[1:15:43] faith taking you
[1:15:45] amen or is just making you more relaxed
[1:15:47] in this world
[1:15:50] faith is not not ordained to do that
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:53] let's get the right revelation of god
[1:15:56] amen for the glory of god and again as
[1:15:59] as
[1:16:00] they were saying in that fellowship
[1:16:03] it wasn't here but
[1:16:05] and we're all a lot of believers and the
[1:16:07] deacons of a certain church and and this
[1:16:09] preacher and this preacher and that
[1:16:10] preacher oh yeah and uh
[1:16:14] and there was a preacher there and also
[1:16:16] from uh from the united states he's gone
[1:16:18] on now
[1:16:19] but again the the deacons were talking
[1:16:22] about the word and discussing this
[1:16:24] discussing that and they turned to that
[1:16:26] preacher and they said oh they said
[1:16:28] brother answer me a question
[1:16:30] and uh
[1:16:31] he
[1:16:32] said what is the importance of the seals
[1:16:36] the seven seals mystery revelation and
[1:16:39] he said always said uh
[1:16:42] because he said oh yeah jesus he said
[1:16:44] pray preached on this preached on that
[1:16:46] and he said
[1:16:47] is is the seals he said brother if the
[1:16:49] seals is important he says some
[1:16:52] preachers say
[1:16:54] and the preacher they asked
[1:16:56] he said
[1:16:57] well he said
[1:16:58] he brother ministered on the seals but
[1:17:01] my brother brown ministry he said on the
[1:17:03] church ages he ministered a series on
[1:17:05] daniel he did this series and so on and
[1:17:07] he said uh and the seven seals he said
[1:17:10] was not just another series
[1:17:14] and i
[1:17:15] i oh
[1:17:17] lord
[1:17:18] i said they need more understanding
[1:17:20] and i said excuse me
[1:17:22] brother i said i don't mean to disagree
[1:17:25] and i said all due respect
[1:17:27] to you but i said brother brown i said
[1:17:29] did preach a series on the seals he did
[1:17:32] preach a series on daniel and
[1:17:34] and on the jews and so on and i said but
[1:17:38] it wasn't the same as his series on the
[1:17:40] seals
[1:17:42] well what what do you mean i said well i
[1:17:45] said before the seals he kept pointing
[1:17:47] to the seals
[1:17:49] that god was going to do this and god
[1:17:50] was going to do that and then after the
[1:17:52] seals i said he kept pointing back to
[1:17:54] the seals
[1:17:57] i said why because i said the seals were
[1:17:59] significant to give us a greater
[1:18:01] understanding of the church ages a great
[1:18:03] understanding of the daniel series it
[1:18:05] was the mystery of god being revealed to
[1:18:07] give us rapturing faith
[1:18:10] oh
[1:18:12] that right
[1:18:14] well brother that's what i feel now i
[1:18:16] said we can agree to disagree so we left
[1:18:18] it with that but not long after that i
[1:18:20] and now that i was sitting at a table
[1:18:22] with that preacher again and
[1:18:24] another preacher and he asked questions
[1:18:27] asked this to the preacher and he
[1:18:29] answered this way he answered that way
[1:18:31] and i said well i said brother the word
[1:18:33] says
[1:18:34] this
[1:18:35] because the question that he answered
[1:18:37] you know was in the word but the pastor
[1:18:39] the preacher that was answering he
[1:18:42] didn't i like that
[1:18:44] and to finally i let him answer and i
[1:18:46] said well i said
[1:18:47] i said brothers i said again
[1:18:49] don't mean to disagree keep our spirit
[1:18:52] right and our attitude right but the
[1:18:53] word says this and the word says that of
[1:18:56] course later
[1:18:58] not long after that that brother
[1:19:00] preaches
[1:19:01] a series
[1:19:02] on the word doctrine
[1:19:05] what do you mean
[1:19:06] oh because there's so many preachers out
[1:19:08] there talking about the word the word
[1:19:10] the word amen oh yeah the word says this
[1:19:13] this is the word this is the word and he
[1:19:16] preached oh yes there's preachers after
[1:19:17] now he said they got that word doctrine
[1:19:19] that's all they're talking about the
[1:19:20] word the word the word
[1:19:23] says this and the word says that no
[1:19:25] yeah
[1:19:26] and i said no it's not that i said it
[1:19:29] it's giving jesus the glory
[1:19:31] giving jesus to preeminence praise the
[1:19:33] lord amen so brother alpha god help us
[1:19:36] amen to get into the faith stay in the
[1:19:39] faith live in the faith amen and let our
[1:19:42] lives reflect the faith

[1:19:45] revelation of what god requires
[1:19:48] and what god wants us to have amen the
[1:19:51] resurrection the rapture
[1:19:53] amen whatever god wanted to do he'll
[1:19:55] send down the anointing to create in in
[1:19:58] his seed sons and daughters regardless

[1:20:07] for virtue knowledge temperance patience
[1:20:09] godliness brotherly kindness and the
[1:20:12] fullness of the goddess and the baptism
[1:20:14] of the holy ghost amen it was made flesh
[1:20:17] made flesh in the bride now it was made
[1:20:20] fresh in jesus now it's made flesh and
[1:20:22] the bride
[1:20:22] amen by the grace of almighty god
[1:20:25] because they were all pointing to
[1:20:27] pointing to calvin all pointing to jesus
[1:20:29] and now we're all playing to the
[1:20:31] revealed word in this hour amen
[1:20:34] oh yeah they crucified him then now they
[1:20:36] crucify him now and unfortunately
[1:20:38] there's even believers that are
[1:20:39] crucifying him
[1:20:41] amen god's doing this they don't want to
[1:20:43] believe that god's doing that didn't
[1:20:45] want to believe this no no brother or
[1:20:49] uh they're there now they're getting
[1:20:50] carnal as i said lord don't come today
[1:20:53] because i got things to do
[1:20:55] and lord i i well you know what you
[1:20:57] you're enjoying that and you're loving
[1:20:59] those things more than you love him
[1:21:02] amen that's the truth
[1:21:04] because i i've gone through those
[1:21:06] scriptures a number of times as the lord
[1:21:07] i said what does it mean that they love
[1:21:09] the world
[1:21:10] love not the world he said neither the
[1:21:12] things that are in the world
[1:21:14] and he said if any man love the world
[1:21:17] the love of the father is not in him if
[1:21:19] we're more caught up with these things
[1:21:21] going out to the world
[1:21:23] no
[1:21:25] the love of god is not in us
[1:21:27] amen if the law of god is in us brother
[1:21:30] it just
[1:21:31] turns everything off shuts it down cuts
[1:21:33] it off cuts us off from all what's going
[1:21:35] on over there we're not gonna get caught
[1:21:37] up with this and with that no indeed
[1:21:39] we're caught up with the revelation of
[1:21:40] jesus caught up with the revelation of
[1:21:43] the
[1:21:45] yeah
[1:21:46] the resurrection of the rapture and the
[1:21:47] marriage supper of the lamb
[1:21:49] amen
[1:21:51] just too many as i said over the years
[1:21:53] they got caught up with this doctrine
[1:21:54] this doctrine that doctrine amen but
[1:21:57] ignoring exactly why god did all of that
[1:22:00] amen what's god looking for now brother
[1:22:03] he's gone beyond looking for the looking
[1:22:05] for this doctrine and that doctrine you
[1:22:07] believe this you believe that
[1:22:09] oh yeah all of that points to the
[1:22:11] resurrection rapture that's what he
[1:22:12] wants that's the faith he's looking for
[1:22:14] amen amen resurrection and rapturing
[1:22:17] faith is what god is looking for that's
[1:22:20] right in you and in me amen so how many
[1:22:23] of us are
[1:22:24] dying to more and more and more to the
[1:22:26] world and becoming more and more alive
[1:22:28] to the word amen because amen we've got
[1:22:31] to come to this place the bible says the
[1:22:33] spirit and the bride say
[1:22:35] come
[1:22:37] right amen
[1:22:38] the prophet said interesting he said as
[1:22:40] long as the bride is there on earth he
[1:22:42] said there's grace that's right amen
[1:22:45] sorry brush brother we're going to have
[1:22:46] grace keep your attitude right your
[1:22:48] spirit right amen
[1:22:50] oh don't don't get caught up well look
[1:22:52] what what happened to judas
[1:22:55] oh he was in the word and he had this
[1:22:56] and he had that and the oh yeah he
[1:22:58] believed he was believing jesus jesus
[1:23:00] that amen but he was the one that
[1:23:03] betrayed jesus
[1:23:04] you know what he felt
[1:23:06] why in the world did judas do that he
[1:23:08] had the letter of the word amen and he
[1:23:10] felt maybe oh if if i do this then jesus
[1:23:13] would be he'd be forcing jesus
[1:23:15] to bring victory to the jews
[1:23:18] yeah because they were looking for
[1:23:20] victory from from the power that was
[1:23:22] reigning in israel
[1:23:25] of rome
[1:23:26] and they they were reigning israel
[1:23:27] they're controlling israel and they
[1:23:29] wrote and he wanted jesus oh jesus is
[1:23:30] going to do this the messiah is going to
[1:23:32] do this and so he felt well if i
[1:23:34] betrayed him
[1:23:35] he said he's going to he's going to just
[1:23:37] he's not going to let them do this he'll
[1:23:39] stand
[1:23:40] and
[1:23:41] do
[1:23:42] declare his power
[1:23:43] stop there stop there stop this
[1:23:46] no first he had to redeem us
[1:23:50] amen and then come back
[1:23:52] to share his life with us
[1:23:54] amen to encourage us that as he laid
[1:23:57] down his life for us we laid in our
[1:23:59] lives for him
[1:24:01] amen we're looking for jesus brother
[1:24:04] sister let's focus on christ amen
[1:24:06] considering what he did for us let's
[1:24:08] focus on him
[1:24:10] yeah the price that he paid
[1:24:13] what he suffered
[1:24:14] and amen we got and what your you want
[1:24:17] to declare your love that you have for
[1:24:20] how many of us love jesus
[1:24:24] there are those that love this they love
[1:24:25] that the oil comes to the world amen
[1:24:28] again
[1:24:29] again they were loving the world
[1:24:31] and they're loving the things of the
[1:24:33] world
[1:24:34] yeah
[1:24:36] not necessarily absolutely sinful things
[1:24:38] but it's a spirit of unbelief
[1:24:41] it's a spirit of unbelief that you
[1:24:43] believe this but you don't won't believe
[1:24:45] that i don't think this is necessarily
[1:24:47] god means for us to do this or that
[1:24:49] what did he do
[1:24:51] he was the example
[1:24:53] amen our lord jesus christ
[1:24:56] grace of god
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:02] bear with me
[1:25:07] see
[1:25:11] sorry amen
[1:25:13] again let me read it again search the
[1:25:15] scriptures
[1:25:17] amen for in them you think ye have
[1:25:19] eternal life
[1:25:21] oh
[1:25:22] search it because in them you think you
[1:25:24] got eternal life
[1:25:25] amen and they are they which testify of
[1:25:29] me
[1:25:30] amen
[1:25:32] but he says and ye will not come to me
[1:25:34] that ye might have life
[1:25:36] amen
[1:25:38] do you stay with the word the whole word
[1:25:39] nothing but the word that you might have
[1:25:41] eternal life
[1:25:43] amen for i receive not honor from men
[1:25:46] but i know you that ye have not the love
[1:25:48] of god in you
[1:25:50] amen
[1:25:52] and says i am come in my father's name
[1:25:54] and ye receive me not if another come
[1:25:57] shall come in his own name im ye will
[1:26:00] receive
[1:26:01] how can ye believe which receive honor
[1:26:04] of one of another
[1:26:05] and seek not the honor that cometh from
[1:26:08] god only amen
[1:26:11] god in control of our lives
[1:26:14] amen so i want to share with you
[1:26:18] some thoughts concerning the word and
[1:26:20] faith
[1:26:21] in the bible
[1:26:23] amen
[1:26:24] and the faith that the bible refers to
[1:26:26] is a strong conviction of the truth amen
[1:26:30] amen
[1:26:31] so do we have that strong conviction of
[1:26:33] the truth so the truth is going to
[1:26:35] control us
[1:26:36] and not just the letter of the word
[1:26:38] the truth the spiritual revelation and
[1:26:41] brother when it comes to it comes to
[1:26:42] faith
[1:26:45] that in the bible
[1:26:47] in the entire bible
[1:26:49] faith is referenced 231
[1:26:53] times
[1:26:54] faith
[1:26:56] but
[1:26:57] notice the difference between the old
[1:26:59] and new testament
[1:27:02] in the old testament faith
[1:27:05] is reverence and respected and referred
[1:27:08] rather
[1:27:09] reverence and how many times
[1:27:12] and we know how many times that faith is
[1:27:13] in the old testament
[1:27:17] faith is in the old testament two times
[1:27:22] two
[1:27:23] yeah two
[1:27:25] just mentions faith
[1:27:26] and it's in deuteronomy
[1:27:28] and uh
[1:27:30] another one there advocate
[1:27:32] the prophet evident
[1:27:34] amen
[1:27:35] he mentioned faith once and deuteronomy
[1:27:37] is mentioned once that's all
[1:27:40] i thought my
[1:27:42] they would mention faith many more times
[1:27:44] no
[1:27:45] but in the new testament
[1:27:47] faith is referenced
[1:27:50] 229 times amen
[1:27:54] yeah
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:56] why because through the through the new
[1:27:59] testament it is faith faith faith god
[1:28:02] has done this but where is your faith to
[1:28:03] believe it
[1:28:05] amen
[1:28:06] and
[1:28:08] the book of hebrews
[1:28:11] faith is mentioned 31 times
[1:28:14] so what if i were to preach on rev
[1:28:17] hebrews chapter 11
[1:28:19] how long would it take me
[1:28:21] amen
[1:28:22] considering
[1:28:24] that in hebrews 11 faith is mentioned 23
[1:28:27] times
[1:28:28] one chapter
[1:28:31] god help us
[1:28:32] amen
[1:28:34] that we're going to catch the revelation
[1:28:35] of faith
[1:28:36] or faith is a revelation yeah but we
[1:28:39] need the revelation of faith that's amen
[1:28:42] brother that we're going to get the real
[1:28:44] true revelation amen not the devil's
[1:28:47] impersonation of it
[1:28:49] and the satan is there to impersonate
[1:28:52] the revelation of faith amen
[1:28:55] so it is
[1:28:56] two times in the old testament and 229
[1:29:00] in the new testament
[1:29:02] two in the old
[1:29:09] and it is referenced in
[1:29:12] to see
[1:29:13] 21 times
[1:29:16] that's what no yeah
[1:29:17] his reference
[1:29:19] no
[1:29:20] sorry
[1:29:22] in the old testament two times
[1:29:26] elia and in the in the old testament
[1:29:28] there's 36 six books in the bible
[1:29:31] in the old testament
[1:29:32] 36 books
[1:29:34] and the only mention
[1:29:36] faith twice
[1:29:39] amen and in the in the new testament
[1:29:41] there's 21
[1:29:44] books
[1:29:45] in the new testament
[1:29:46] 21 and faith is mentioned
[1:29:50] 229 times
[1:29:53] 2 in the old
[1:29:54] 229 in the new
[1:29:56] amen
[1:29:58] brother
[1:29:59] are we putting our emphasis on the faith
[1:30:01] of the old testament or the new
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:06] the grace of god and brother of the 229
[1:30:09] times in the new testament in the book
[1:30:12] of hebrews faith is mentioned 31 times
[1:30:16] amen
[1:30:18] and in hebrews chapter 11
[1:30:21] out of the 31 is 23 times
[1:30:25] in hebrews chapter 11 in one chapter
[1:30:28] so we could go say all right we're going
[1:30:29] to we're going to
[1:30:30] we're going to minister on hebrews 11.
[1:30:33] faith allah going to take us
[1:30:36] amen
[1:30:38] brother matthew can certainly take the
[1:30:39] clock down
[1:30:41] if we started on that
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:44] brother because faith is mentioned
[1:30:48] 23 times in chapter 11.
[1:30:52] so brother
[1:30:53] is faith as important to us as it is in
[1:30:55] the word amen
[1:30:58] amen do we really seriously consider
[1:31:00] faith
[1:31:02] are we really seriously amen
[1:31:05] judging our faith by the word
[1:31:08] amen
[1:31:10] do we have faith in god absolutely amen
[1:31:13] god gave adam and eve the faith that
[1:31:15] they needed but the eve loved the devil
[1:31:17] to allow the devil to add to that faith
[1:31:19] just a word amen and put the world in
[1:31:22] the mess that it's in
[1:31:24] yeah
[1:31:25] god help us
[1:31:28] so
[1:31:28] brother out of the 229 times
[1:31:35] faith is in
[1:31:37] the new testament
[1:31:39] amen oh yeah the old testament faith
[1:31:42] deuteronomy and advocate
[1:31:47] and then on down to the new testament
[1:31:51] oh again
[1:31:53] bear with me
[1:31:54] 21 times thirty editing 36 books of the
[1:31:57] old 21 in the new amen
[1:32:01] and again faith is mentioned just twice
[1:32:04] in the old and
[1:32:05] 229 in the new
[1:32:08] by the grace of god
[1:32:11] and i i do have it listed here in all
[1:32:13] the books of the bible or the new
[1:32:15] testament
[1:32:16] our faith oh yeah just think of that how
[1:32:18] many times did john mention faith
[1:32:21] in the book of john
[1:32:22] once
[1:32:24] once amen
[1:32:27] and in the book of jude
[1:32:29] faith is mentioned twice
[1:32:32] in the book of revelation

[1:37:04] did he send the prophet
[1:37:06] amen let's get into why he sent the
[1:37:08] prophet as i've said i believe on
[1:37:10] wednesday that a number of
[1:37:12] for years believers just preached gossip
[1:37:15] and a prophet god sent a prophet
[1:37:17] and finally
[1:37:19] even i was highlighting it um among the
[1:37:22] preachers around the world that no
[1:37:25] that that that's not our evangelism
[1:37:27] that's right
[1:37:28] no no not by any means and yet many
[1:37:32] preachers around the world and
[1:37:33] especially in america and canada and
[1:37:35] england they're all they're all
[1:37:36] preaching goddess and a prophet god has
[1:37:38] sent a prophet and they sent their
[1:37:40] evangelists over to over to africa they
[1:37:42] sent their evangelists to india all over
[1:37:43] the world what for tell them god has
[1:37:45] sent a prophet
[1:37:47] yeah no
[1:37:48] now but of course that changed there
[1:37:50] rose another generation amen it was in
[1:37:53] 19 year old 70s
[1:37:55] and i sure 70 early 70s and on to 1977
[1:37:59] is when when when the emphasis preachers
[1:38:02] begin to put themselves on the word
[1:38:04] amen that god has sent a messenger and
[1:38:07] he's revealed the word and revealed the
[1:38:09] mystery of god to give us faith for the
[1:38:11] resurrection rapture amen
[1:38:13] again brother brown did say to brother
[1:38:16] level he said brother lee he said irvine
[1:38:18] bale he said the older generation around
[1:38:21] this message back then
[1:38:22] in 1960s
[1:38:24] and he said
[1:38:26] they'll be gone
[1:38:28] before the rapture comes on he said they
[1:38:30] won't be here you should they'll be
[1:38:32] waiting for it in another dimension
[1:38:35] amen
[1:38:36] and brother that's the truth
[1:38:40] that older generation has gone on
[1:38:43] 55 years
[1:38:45] how close are we to the resurrection
[1:38:49] how close are we to the rapture i be
[1:38:51] brother i'll tell you this those who are
[1:38:52] close to it and those who are getting
[1:38:54] ready for it
[1:38:55] the faith that they live and the faith
[1:38:57] they manifest is going to be different
[1:38:59] they're going to look different talk
[1:39:01] different act different well yeah
[1:39:02] they're going to annoy that i believe
[1:39:04] they're going to get more and more and
[1:39:06] more separated onto the lord
[1:39:08] they're going to get more and more
[1:39:09] separated under the word
[1:39:11] more and more separated unto the
[1:39:12] revelation of what god's doing amen
[1:39:16] to give us rapturing faith
[1:39:18] by the grace of god
[1:39:20] and again
[1:39:21] in the message perfect faith
[1:39:23] august 1963
[1:39:27] he said
[1:39:29] see
[1:39:36] he says so when a man lives by faith
[1:39:39] and walks by faith
[1:39:41] i mean
[1:39:42] substance faith
[1:39:44] amen
[1:39:45] because the bible says faith is the
[1:39:47] substance
[1:39:48] of things over
[1:39:50] amen so god makes it more more real to
[1:39:53] us
[1:39:55] by faith by faith he reveals it to us
[1:39:58] and what's the only thing we can live
[1:40:00] for
[1:40:01] we're looking for the rapture we're
[1:40:02] looking for the resurrection we want to
[1:40:03] get out of here
[1:40:05] i pray god that
[1:40:06] that our young brothers and sisters here
[1:40:08] have that same revelation they want to
[1:40:10] get out of here
[1:40:11] amen
[1:40:13] not being caught up with the world or
[1:40:15] the things of the world but let's be
[1:40:18] caught up with the word
[1:40:19] amen
[1:40:22] so when a man lives by faith and walks
[1:40:24] by faith i mean substance faith
[1:40:27] is isolated
[1:40:29] from the entire world
[1:40:32] and becomes a new creature in christ
[1:40:34] there now you get you're getting you're
[1:40:37] getting into a bright material
[1:40:39] are you bright material
[1:40:43] amen
[1:40:44] well he said when you live by faith
[1:40:45] you're getting into bright material amen
[1:40:48] when you're getting ready for the
[1:40:49] rapture and the resurrection you're
[1:40:51] getting into bright material
[1:40:54] amen
[1:40:56] are you bride material
[1:40:59] not just church members
[1:41:01] right material
[1:41:04] and he said you're getting into a
[1:41:05] rapturing condition
[1:41:10] and he said that means for each one of
[1:41:12] us
[1:41:14] not just the pastor
[1:41:16] but rather he said deacons trustees and
[1:41:18] that means for the laity and every
[1:41:20] individual walks in a world with god
[1:41:23] alone amen god help us amen
[1:41:27] amen that we'll go forth with that life
[1:41:30] by the grace of god that we walk in the
[1:41:33] world with god alone that's right
[1:41:36] amen
[1:41:37] and he said you're baptized into his
[1:41:39] kingdom and there's nobody in there but
[1:41:42] you and god
[1:41:43] amen and he gives the orders and you
[1:41:46] pack them out
[1:41:48] amen
[1:41:49] and he said whatever he says there's not
[1:41:52] a shadow of doubt nowhere and he said
[1:41:54] you walk right on and if the lord says
[1:41:56] this there's nobody in the world can
[1:41:58] talk you out of it
[1:42:00] amen
[1:42:01] praise the lord
[1:42:03] now
[1:42:04] can't talk me out of it i caught up with
[1:42:06] this
[1:42:07] i come from there and i'm going back to
[1:42:08] there this is how i'm getting back amen
[1:42:11] praise the lord
[1:42:13] hallelujah
[1:42:14] but yet those believers get caught up
[1:42:16] with the foolishness of the world
[1:42:18] oh i'm a believer so you know i i
[1:42:20] believe the message
[1:42:22] yeah but again let me say it again make
[1:42:24] sure the message you're in the message
[1:42:26] the message is in you
[1:42:30] how many believers are in the message
[1:42:32] but how many believers got the message
[1:42:34] in or they're in the message not
[1:42:36] yeah
[1:42:37] message in them that's right amen
[1:42:41] if the message in you is going to
[1:42:42] produce a certain action certain
[1:42:44] reaction that's right oh yes you got a
[1:42:47] certain attitude you got a certain
[1:42:48] spirit you live a certain way talk a
[1:42:50] certain way amen but christ has got the
[1:42:53] preeminence
[1:42:54] spiritual you're going to live a
[1:42:56] spiritual life
[1:42:58] not a carnal life
[1:42:59] just not a religious life it's a
[1:43:01] spiritual life amen
[1:43:05] he said not a shadow of doubt nowhere
[1:43:08] and he said you walk right on and if the
[1:43:10] lord says this there's nobody in the
[1:43:12] world can talk you out of it
[1:43:14] oh god have mercy
[1:43:16] he said you go right on just the same
[1:43:18] and he said now issues are coming into
[1:43:20] perfect faith
[1:43:22] how many of us are coming into perfect
[1:43:23] faith
[1:43:24] your life will reveal it

[1:43:40] got a revelation of the resurrection the
[1:43:42] rapture and he's and he's more caught up
[1:43:44] with that than he is what's going on in
[1:43:46] time
[1:43:48] god help us
[1:43:51] he said you're coming into perfect faith
[1:43:53] perfect perfection that cannot fail now
[1:43:56] he said that faith never fails

[1:46:28] lived or or might have been a woman in
[1:46:30] the life that she lived i was really
[1:46:31] mystics why because
[1:46:34] because they just live for god they live
[1:46:35] for jesus amen they're living for the
[1:46:37] resurrection living for the rapture or
[1:46:40] they were considered crazy
[1:46:42] maybe in in their thoughts in the
[1:46:43] conversation
[1:46:45] or they're just religious fanatics
[1:46:48] well jesus i guess they consider jesus a
[1:46:50] religious fanatic
[1:46:52] yeah and crucified him
[1:46:54] amen why because he was laying the word
[1:46:57] down to challenge their faith
[1:47:01] to make sure what is your faith
[1:47:03] what do you believe
[1:47:05] or what they just believed god was gonna
[1:47:07] send the messiah and that he would be
[1:47:09] born maybe in in the house of one of the
[1:47:12] one of the high priests in israel yeah
[1:47:14] and he would he would be raised up and
[1:47:16] do this and he'd raise up he would
[1:47:18] control them
[1:47:19] not just spiritually but to control them
[1:47:22] politically you know how on he would
[1:47:24] take control and give and deliver them
[1:47:26] from the
[1:47:27] from the power of the of the romans
[1:47:30] that's what a lot of people believe the
[1:47:32] messiah was to do
[1:47:34] yeah
[1:47:35] that's the messiah they wanted
[1:47:36] what for to make their natural lives
[1:47:39] different not their spiritual
[1:47:41] yeah amen so i pray grace brother that
[1:47:45] the god in his word is yeah
[1:47:48] he's challenging us our spiritual lives
[1:47:51] amen so we're going to live different
[1:47:54] talk different act different be
[1:47:55] separated oh yes completely
[1:47:58] it just happens
[1:48:00] amen but you know what we're you know
[1:48:02] where it brings us it brings us to that
[1:48:05] place where the prophet said
[1:48:06] we could just
[1:48:08] be a girl a boy or a man or a woman and
[1:48:10] he said you bring you to that place and
[1:48:12] he said you'll raise your hand and say

[1:48:24] amen
[1:48:26] so we are taught to resist the devil
[1:48:28] and he will flee from us now to resist
[1:48:31] is to just simply turn him down
[1:48:35] just resist him and that is just
[1:48:38] walk away from the devil
[1:48:41] or from his thoughts amen

[1:48:56] a number of times
[1:48:57] he said this is coming into that third
[1:48:59] pole
[1:49:00] amen
[1:49:02] and it's the third pool of the open word
[1:49:06] in the mystery of god
[1:49:07] and he said i'm working out something
[1:49:10] and is taking this charge of faith
[1:49:13] and going right back to begin and come
[1:49:15] in and he said to kind of raise faith in
[1:49:18] a bracket
[1:49:19] is it where you have never noticed it
[1:49:21] before
[1:49:22] he said not a faith
[1:49:24] but a perfect faith
[1:49:28] amen
[1:49:29] and he said built up in here and watch a
[1:49:33] perfect god with a perfect heart keep a
[1:49:36] perfect promise by his perfect word
[1:49:41] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:49:43] amen that's right brothers it is the
[1:49:46] word
[1:49:47] believe us now this
[1:49:50] that's it believe us thou this
[1:49:52] amen well i believe the message what
[1:49:54] wait a minute
[1:49:55] you believe it but are you is it in you
[1:49:58] and are you in it amen
[1:50:00] yeah
[1:50:00] there's a lot they say they they they
[1:50:02] believe the message but they're not in
[1:50:04] the message and the message is not in
[1:50:06] them and as i said the prophet preached
[1:50:07] that to his own church
[1:50:09] he said you're in the message but the
[1:50:10] message is not in you
[1:50:13] what
[1:50:14] he preached that to his own people yeah
[1:50:17] he did
[1:50:18] nearing the end of his own ministry
[1:50:20] amen
[1:50:22] and brother what a challenge
[1:50:26] that caused
[1:50:28] brother ram to go off the earth the way
[1:50:30] that he did
[1:50:31] oh yes there was something going on
[1:50:34] in jeffersonville
[1:50:36] and he was on his way back to challenge
[1:50:38] it he's on his way back to correct it
[1:50:41] and to line it up
[1:50:42] amen
[1:50:44] he said this and he said that he knew
[1:50:45] somewhere he knew what was going what
[1:50:47] was going on amen but he was going back
[1:50:50] to challenge the individuals that were
[1:50:52] guilty of it
[1:50:54] you know
[1:50:55] god help us
[1:50:58] and god took him off the scene
[1:51:00] as on the internet there's somebody that
[1:51:03] saying they don't believe that william
[1:51:04] brown was the prophet and
[1:51:07] they'd left them left the message of
[1:51:08] william branham and they're highlighting
[1:51:10] you know well he was just a man and he
[1:51:13] couldn't do this he couldn't do that
[1:51:15] and they said then when we consider the
[1:51:17] way that god took him off the scene
[1:51:20] he said well you know if he was if he
[1:51:22] was a prophet of god and he was in the
[1:51:24] word of god and lined up with god and
[1:51:25] all that then why would god
[1:51:28] allow this to happen to take him off the
[1:51:30] scene
[1:51:31] well
[1:51:33] brother prophets in the bible i have
[1:51:35] gone off the scene
[1:51:37] with with something worse than that amen
[1:51:40] oh yeah
[1:51:42] most definitely go back to the word
[1:51:44] amen but that's on the internet
[1:51:47] and this is why they feel that
[1:51:49] we don't randomly don't they don't don't
[1:51:51] accept them don't accept this message
[1:51:53] and so on and there's a there's a
[1:51:55] gentleman there a young man they're
[1:51:57] giving that i guess he's in his 30s
[1:51:59] giving that faith because he was born
[1:52:01] and raised in the message but he's not a
[1:52:03] message believer
[1:52:04] and then there's another sister there
[1:52:06] that was born i guess raised in the
[1:52:08] message not a not a believer
[1:52:11] no no now they're another
[1:52:13] taking the negative stand toward the
[1:52:15] word toward what god has done
[1:52:17] oh yeah
[1:52:19] and just think some of them were their
[1:52:21] parents witnessed william branham their
[1:52:22] parents dealt with william branham oh
[1:52:24] yeah brother they just need to read the
[1:52:26] bible
[1:52:28] and they'll see a god allowed this this
[1:52:30] one to be taken that to be taken after
[1:52:33] seeing well look at the 68 million
[1:52:36] christians
[1:52:38] that laid down their lives
[1:52:40] during the dark ages
[1:52:41] oh yeah oh they were they were killed
[1:52:44] they were crucified they were burnt
[1:52:46] and everything else oh yeah
[1:52:48] again it's like he told that sister
[1:52:51] that if she didn't repent and and turn
[1:52:53] away from the what they were taking
[1:52:55] their stand for christianity that they
[1:52:57] were going to kill it they're going to
[1:52:58] kill her daughter
[1:52:59] just a young girl
[1:53:01] she said
[1:53:02] kill her
[1:53:03] she said i'll meet her in glory amen
[1:53:06] amen and again they were tormenting
[1:53:09] another another gentleman and praise the
[1:53:11] lord
[1:53:12] and uh
[1:53:13] oh yeah
[1:53:14] and they were sort of stretching him and
[1:53:16] stretching him and stretching him then
[1:53:19] they noticed this funny
[1:53:22] he's not reacting
[1:53:23] oh he seems like he feels good
[1:53:26] and they were putting more and more pain
[1:53:28] on him
[1:53:29] and then finally they stopped
[1:53:32] oh
[1:53:33] he said don't stop
[1:53:35] they said don't stop don't you feel it
[1:53:37] oh yes he said but it's wonderful he
[1:53:39] said wonderful he said see right there
[1:53:41] he said he said there's two angels right
[1:53:43] there stood stood next to the place
[1:53:45] where they had him
[1:53:48] tied down
[1:53:49] he said keep on going keep on going why
[1:53:52] he wasn't feeling any pain they were
[1:53:54] shocked
[1:53:55] yeah
[1:53:56] but he laid down his life for the gospel
[1:53:59] oh praise the lord
[1:54:01] brother considering 68 million suffered
[1:54:04] what they suffered
[1:54:06] did what they did endured what they
[1:54:08] endured laid down their lives
[1:54:13] and we think we can do anything we're
[1:54:15] just believers
[1:54:17] i think we'd be more than willing
[1:54:19] to suffer for the gospel sake
[1:54:21] more than willing take our stand for
[1:54:23] jesus
[1:54:24] more than willing to take our stand for
[1:54:25] the resurrection to rapture
[1:54:27] considering what all of them did when
[1:54:29] they laid down their lives
[1:54:32] as i said that
[1:54:33] and it happened in france and they were
[1:54:36] killing the people killing them killing
[1:54:37] them and
[1:54:39] they were charming after head
[1:54:41] because of their stand for the gospel
[1:54:43] and this man come by and he saw he saw
[1:54:46] them take this woman
[1:54:48] and took him
[1:54:49] up there and they were going to put her
[1:54:50] down and cut her head off
[1:54:52] and oh and this gentleman he saw he said
[1:54:56] wait wait wait wait no no he said don't
[1:54:57] do that
[1:54:58] he said let her go and he said take me
[1:55:04] take me
[1:55:06] take you
[1:55:07] yes take you
[1:55:09] yes
[1:55:10] he said let her go he said i'll i'll
[1:55:13] take her place
[1:55:14] yeah so they took her up and released
[1:55:16] her took him put him down and cut his
[1:55:19] cutie
[1:55:21] he was laying down his life for god
[1:55:23] not just for her it was for the lord
[1:55:26] they really did that they really did it
[1:55:28] amen so brother god help us that we'd be
[1:55:30] more than willing to take
[1:55:33] separation
[1:55:34] onto this word
[1:55:35] oh we'll be glad to have that separation
[1:55:37] amen amen because the more and more we
[1:55:40] experience that we can look up look up
[1:55:43] oh god grace
[1:55:46] amen
[1:55:48] he said i'm working out something
[1:55:50] to kind of raise faith into a bracket
[1:55:53] where you have never noticed it that way
[1:55:55] before not a faith but a perfect faith
[1:55:59] build up in here and watch a perfect god
[1:56:02] with a perfect heart keep a perfect
[1:56:05] promise by his perfect word
[1:56:07] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:56:10] and a deserter of the thoughts of the
[1:56:12] heart
[1:56:13] and he said and what he said we are
[1:56:15] coming now to the perfection because
[1:56:18] people has to come to this in order for
[1:56:21] the rapture
[1:56:23] amen
[1:56:25] the ministry
[1:56:26] is is ordained
[1:56:29] amen and god is using the ministry to
[1:56:30] bring it to this perfection
[1:56:35] that's what god's been working on all
[1:56:37] those years here
[1:56:38] since our brother gerald's been here
[1:56:41] and now our brother
[1:56:43] jonathan corlett amen so we're what he's
[1:56:46] laying in the word leaning the word then
[1:56:48] to get the bride line up with the word
[1:56:50] line up with the word die to self-strap
[1:56:52] more of that word is in you
[1:56:54] more that word is manifested in your
[1:56:56] flesh amen praise the lord
[1:57:00] but
[1:57:02] we could also come to that place that
[1:57:03] jesus came to to lay down your life
[1:57:07] physically
[1:57:09] yeah but before that happens bride's
[1:57:11] taken home
[1:57:13] yeah thank the lord why because it's the
[1:57:16] hour of the resurrection
[1:57:20] listen he said
[1:57:21] we're coming now to that perfection
[1:57:23] because the people has to come to this
[1:57:25] in order for the rapture
[1:57:27] and that's what's holding it away right
[1:57:29] now is waiting for the church to come
[1:57:32] into that perfect raptured faith
[1:57:35] and i'm looking for it it means a lot of
[1:57:37] shaking down for me it means a lot for
[1:57:40] you but together we'll make it by the
[1:57:42] grace of god
[1:57:44] amen that's the truth without the lord
[1:57:47] in control we won't make it
[1:57:50] not my will lord thine be done
[1:57:54] grace that will have the right anointing
[1:57:56] and leadership in our lives by the grace
[1:57:58] of god
[1:58:01] it's like one time that
[1:58:03] sister barnes was doing something in her
[1:58:05] home and
[1:58:06] a visitor came
[1:58:09] and
[1:58:10] knocking on the door
[1:58:12] it was a believer
[1:58:14] and
[1:58:16] she opened the door for the believer to
[1:58:17] come in
[1:58:19] and by that time the believer had gone
[1:58:21] in through her main porch there and was
[1:58:23] up to the door going into her kitchen
[1:58:25] and so sister brown went there to open
[1:58:27] that door and when she opened that door
[1:58:29] the this believer said oh my
[1:58:32] oh my there's such a spirit
[1:58:35] she said he said here oh my it bothers
[1:58:38] me
[1:58:40] sister burns said sister
[1:58:41] she said it must have come with you
[1:58:45] because she said she said i have felt
[1:58:48] nothing but the holy spirit amen
[1:58:50] so she said you you brought it
[1:58:53] she said it's not me amen praise the
[1:58:56] lord oh yes sister brian was very
[1:58:59] oh yeah she was very
[1:59:01] conscious of what was going on and so on
[1:59:02] oh yes
[1:59:04] it's like i said to the time when that
[1:59:06] pentecostal couple was there with that
[1:59:07] child that used to swear
[1:59:10] and they told sister burns about it
[1:59:13] and they said oh she swears and we just
[1:59:16] can't get her to stop it
[1:59:18] oh sister bryan said oh my i'll pray for
[1:59:21] her.
[1:59:21] and i've thought sister brown has been
[1:59:23] on getting to getting the meal for him
[1:59:25] for that family
[1:59:26] and
[1:59:27] like i said when sister brian was
[1:59:29] slicing some bread there or something in
[1:59:31] her in her pantry and she heard the
[1:59:34] child
[1:59:34] started to swear
[1:59:38] and sister burns laid down the knife she
[1:59:40] laid down the bread
[1:59:42] and she stood and she turned around she
[1:59:44] walked out and walked walked through the
[1:59:46] door of the hallway leading into her
[1:59:48] living room and the child and her met in
[1:59:51] the doorway
[1:59:52] and this young girl yeah and sister
[1:59:55] byron said satan
[1:59:57] in the name of jesus christ come out of
[2:00:00] the child amen amen
[2:00:03] and
[2:00:04] oh something happened
[2:00:06] to the child
[2:00:07] anyway she stopped swearing
[2:00:10] yeah and two years later they came back
[2:00:12] and said sister thank you
[2:00:14] she hasn't sworn since
[2:00:17] sister brian's cast that evil spirit out
[2:00:19] god help us to be in the spirit
[2:00:21] amen led by the spirit amen because
[2:00:24] maybe there's a time when certain things
[2:00:26] that you've witnessed certain things
[2:00:27] you've experienced that god wants you to
[2:00:29] stop it
[2:00:31] sister burns did
[2:00:33] amen and it wasn't like i said it wasn't
[2:00:35] like t.l osborn who said he was a noisy
[2:00:37] a noisy pentecostal and and felt that
[2:00:40] that
[2:00:41] that you had to scream at the devil bawl
[2:00:44] at the devil shake the person and so on
[2:00:47] to get them healed
[2:00:48] amen no it's just a person sister byron
[2:00:50] just spoke the word
[2:00:52] yeah very quiet
[2:00:54] and here and here the child was
[2:00:55] delivered and as i said about
[2:00:59] when you see that film again of the 20th
[2:01:01] century prophet and you see our brother
[2:01:03] i don't know if you see him there or not
[2:01:05] brother
[2:01:08] osborne
[2:01:09] and he like it was shocked william what
[2:01:11] shocked our tommy osborne
[2:01:13] was the way that brother benham would
[2:01:15] cast out evil spirits
[2:01:17] i remember they used to do it the way
[2:01:19] the pentecostals did it the way tail
[2:01:21] osborne did it the way oral roberts
[2:01:23] would do it hey allen would do it and
[2:01:25] all the other evangelists back in those
[2:01:27] days
[2:01:28] and they
[2:01:29] and they they go and pray for the person
[2:01:31] and they shake the person
[2:01:33] and then they scream
[2:01:34] satan come out
[2:01:36] but they're absolutely shocked when
[2:01:37] william branham almost whispered it
[2:01:40] says satan come out of this child
[2:01:42] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:01:45] and then
[2:01:46] oh he said amen she said satan is gone
[2:01:48] now he said you're deliberate
[2:01:52] why because they thought william brandon
[2:01:54] would have to scream
[2:01:56] ball loud and they thought he would have
[2:01:59] to take the child or shake the child
[2:02:01] you know maybe maybe try to make the
[2:02:03] devil afraid or scared no no do i think
[2:02:06] that the devil scares the devil his
[2:02:07] faith
[2:02:09] holy ghost faith amen
[2:02:12] so i pray grace the brother it's not the
[2:02:14] natural stuff it's the spiritual
[2:02:16] what's more important what is what is
[2:02:18] what impresses the lord it's your
[2:02:20] spiritual life
[2:02:22] yeah
[2:02:23] so god help us
[2:02:26] and he said again
[2:02:28] the people have to come to this in order
[2:02:29] for the rapture and that's what's
[2:02:31] holding their way right now waiting
[2:02:33] waiting for the church to come into that
[2:02:36] perfect raptured faith amen
[2:02:39] grace and brother to get into that
[2:02:41] you've got to you've got to keep under
[2:02:43] the ministry
[2:02:44] rapture rapture rapture resurrection
[2:02:46] amen look up the coming of the lord
[2:02:50] i pray grace
[2:02:51] when we come to look up we look up into
[2:02:52] the word and that you will notice that
[2:02:54] picture there in the hallway
[2:02:56] with the the man
[2:02:58] with the binoculars
[2:03:00] looking for the rapture
[2:03:02] he's looking at the window where's the
[2:03:04] rapture where's the rapture
[2:03:06] all the rapture's right here
[2:03:08] what
[2:03:09] that's up there
[2:03:11] yeah but the dead in christ will rise
[2:03:12] first right here then we which our line
[2:03:15] remains should be caught up together
[2:03:16] with them then we go off to meet jesus
[2:03:18] amen
[2:03:20] so i pray the grace of god give us that
[2:03:22] simple holy ghost faith
[2:03:24] we need it
[2:03:27] brother
[2:03:29] for me people got faith for this they
[2:03:31] got faith for that
[2:03:33] brother let's start with holy ghost
[2:03:34] faith start with a rapturing faith
[2:03:37] amen if we got a rapturing faith oh it's
[2:03:40] going to catch us all away from all the
[2:03:42] things that the devil is doing amen
[2:03:46] grace to us

[2:14:16] oh yeah grace of god
[2:14:20] oh
[2:14:21] he says see your life proves what you
[2:14:23] are we read it and he said the same
[2:14:26] thing christianity does your faith you
[2:14:29] have confidence in one another it's pure
[2:14:32] and there is something real and that you
[2:14:34] can't
[2:14:35] show it to somebody else
[2:14:37] you've got it
[2:14:40] yet he said you got it and your actions
[2:14:42] will prove it
[2:14:44] amen
[2:14:45] so he said and when you got pure
[2:14:47] unadulterated faith like your love is to
[2:14:50] your companion then you prove it the way
[2:14:52] you act and he said you ain't
[2:14:55] complaining no more
[2:14:57] you know it's done
[2:14:58] so he said see
[2:15:01] he said love and faith has to go
[2:15:03] together
[2:15:05] and he said they are kids folks
[2:15:08] and he said love produces faith
[2:15:11] amen
[2:15:12] god help us have the love that produces
[2:15:14] faith
[2:15:17] the prophet preached on faith by
[2:15:19] experience
[2:15:22] if you have faith and your faith is
[2:15:24] tested it will produce goods
[2:15:27] amen
[2:15:28] if your faith is tested
[2:15:31] and again the prophet highlighted
[2:15:33] have faith in god amen
[2:15:39] and he preached on
[2:15:41] there is a fundamental foundation for
[2:15:44] faith
[2:15:45] amen
[2:15:47] the faith the foundation for faith is
[2:15:49] the word of god
[2:15:51] amen and again the prophet highlights
[2:15:54] that works is faith expressed
[2:15:57] so as your works
[2:15:58] express your faith
[2:16:00] what you do
[2:16:03] amen
[2:16:05] for for one another as believers
[2:16:08] that's that's first and foremost
[2:16:10] then that shows your faith
[2:16:12] amen
[2:16:14] by the grace of god and then it goes on
[2:16:16] to others what you do to others is
[2:16:18] expression of your faith
[2:16:21] amen
[2:16:22] again it's not you that lives christ is
[2:16:24] living in us
[2:16:27] and he said again
[2:16:28] and besides this there's a lot of other
[2:16:31] booklets in there on faith
[2:16:33] and he said faith without works is dead
[2:16:37] because he said works is faith expressed
[2:16:41] amen
[2:16:44] and
[2:16:44] faith is the substance
[2:16:47] amen
[2:16:48] by the grace of god
[2:16:52] real true holy ghost faith
[2:16:55] and one more
[2:16:58] wisdom versus faith

[2:17:10] love for it as it loved you
[2:17:12] and you lay down your life for the word
[2:17:14] amen as the word laid down his life for
[2:17:16] you

[2:17:58] me to finish the same works that i do
[2:18:01] bear witness of me
