[34:03] lord wills amen amen joshua chapter 1
[34:06] and verse 1
[34:07] says now after the death of moses the
[34:09] servant of the lord it came to pass that
[34:11] the lord spake unto joshua the son of
[34:12] nun
[34:13] moses minister saying moses my servant
[34:16] is dead
[34:17] now therefore arise go over this jordan
[34:19] thou and all this people unto the lamb
[34:21] which i do give to them
[34:22] even to the children of israel every
[34:24] place that the soul of your foot shall
[34:26] tread upon
[34:27] that have i given unto you as i said
[34:29] unto moses
[34:30] from the wilderness and lebanon even
[34:33] unto the great river the river euphrates
[34:35] all the land of the hittites
[34:36] and unto the great sea toward the going
[34:38] down of the sun shall be your coast
[34:40] there shall not be any man be able to
[34:42] stand before thee all the days of thy
[34:44] life
[34:44] as i was with moses so i will be with
[34:47] thee i will
[34:48] not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong
[34:51] and of a good courage for unto this
[34:52] people shall thou divide
[34:54] for an inheritance the land which i
[34:56] swear unto their fathers to give them
[34:58] only be thou strong and very courageous
[35:01] that thou mayest observe to do all
[35:02] according to the law
[35:03] or according to all the law which moses
[35:06] my servant commanded thee
[35:07] turn not from it to the right hand nor
[35:09] to the left that thou mayest prosper
[35:11] what wither so ever thou goest
[35:13] this book of the law shall not depart
[35:15] out of thy mouth
[35:16] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[35:18] night that thou mayest observe to do
[35:21] according to all that is written therein
[35:23] for then thou shalt make thy way
[35:24] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[35:27] success
[35:28] have i not commanded thee be strong and
[35:30] of a good courage
[35:31] be not afraid neither be thou dismayed
[35:34] for the lord thy god is with thee
[35:36] wither so ever thou goest amen you can
[35:38] have your seats god bless the reading of
[35:40] his word
[35:44] thank you brother matt i'm not used to
[35:46] clicking my own slides now i just preach
[35:47] and matt keeps up with me but he's
[35:49] he's handed control back to me here so
[35:51] if i miss it for the mat you see what's
[35:53] there and
[35:54] chances probably needed amen amen what a
[35:56] wonderful scripture to start with amen
[35:58] i will not leave thee nor forsake thee
[36:00] amen i'm with you wherever you go
[36:02] amen we're going to continue on our
[36:04] series of the overcomers tonight and for
[36:05] a
[36:06] a for a title i want to go with elected
[36:08] for position
[36:09] predestined for possession amen elected
[36:12] for position
[36:13] predestined for possession i checked and
[36:15] i know i'd spoken on the choosing of god
[36:17] and predestination back in september of
[36:19] last year so i'm not going to
[36:20] dwell on what i've already covered
[36:22] fairly in depth in the last year or so
[36:24] so if you want to to go back and and
[36:26] take a look at it it would certainly be
[36:27] a good
[36:28] uh kind of primer for what we're going
[36:30] into tonight but
[36:31] i'm not going to cover that i want to go
[36:33] into more the effect of predestination
[36:35] the
[36:35] the effect of election and what that
[36:37] does to the believer
[36:38] amen so let's start in joshua one verse
[36:42] three again we're gonna start rolling
[36:43] through we we ended on verse four but
[36:45] i'm going to read the
[36:46] just a little bit to bring us up to
[36:47] speed and then we'll we'll start moving
[36:49] forward amen every place that the soul
[36:51] of your foot shall tread upon
[36:52] that have i given unto you as i said
[36:54] unto moses
[36:55] amen footsteps his possession as brother
[36:58] branham said if you can walk on it it's
[36:59] yours
[37:00] and then if you can win the victory over
[37:02] it then it's yours and it can never be
[37:03] taken away from you again
[37:05] i found that people that get a victory
[37:07] they rarely lose the victory
[37:09] amen especially if the holy ghost
[37:10] victory if it's one thing to do it of
[37:12] your own strength but i'll tell you once
[37:13] you've beaten the devil once
[37:15] he doesn't have much of a chance to beat
[37:16] you at that same thing again and again
[37:18] because once you've beaten him
[37:19] amen by the holy spirit by your faith in
[37:21] the word of god then you know that he's
[37:23] a defeated enemy he's a bluff and he's
[37:24] just trying to throw something back at
[37:26] you every time
[37:27] but he can't stay amen amen from the
[37:30] wilderness in this lebanon even under
[37:31] the great river the river euphrates all
[37:33] the land of the hittites
[37:34] and under the great sea toward the going
[37:36] down of the sun shall be your coast
[37:38] it meant a great inheritance we talked
[37:40] about last time he gives us
[37:41] he gives us this beautiful picture of
[37:43] what's waiting for them but he doesn't
[37:44] really talk about the giants too much
[37:46] does he
[37:47] you know he gets down a little later he
[37:48] says nobody is going to be able to stand
[37:49] before you but god doesn't go into great
[37:51] depth
[37:52] to describe with us how tough it's going
[37:54] to be and how big the challenges are
[37:56] going to be and
[37:56] how tall and thick the walls are and how
[37:58] mean that devil's going to look and
[38:00] how much experience he has and what
[38:02] great weapons he has he doesn't go into
[38:03] that
[38:04] he just says it doesn't matter whatever
[38:06] comes against you is going to have to
[38:07] fall to your before your feed amen
[38:09] so he's just telling you whatever is
[38:11] within what i tell you it belongs to you
[38:13] don't doesn't matter who's there it
[38:15] belongs to you and you just have to go
[38:16] ahead and take it amen
[38:18] amen there shall not be any man be able
[38:21] to
[38:21] stan to stand before thee all the days
[38:23] of thy life
[38:24] as i was with moses so i will be with
[38:27] thee i will not fail thee nor for safety
[38:29] and we spoke last time how joshua's a
[38:31] type of the holy spirit
[38:32] but we don't want to just get on this
[38:34] stuck on that type but we want to
[38:36] recognize that he's a human he's a man
[38:37] just like i am
[38:38] and so the encouragement that he needs
[38:40] and the instruction god gives for him
[38:42] is no different than what is available
[38:44] for us amen we don't want to take
[38:46] joshua and put him up on some big high
[38:47] pedestal he's just like you and i
[38:49] are and so god has to work with him and
[38:51] deal with him the way he does with us
[38:53] so when we see god giving him
[38:54] encouragement when we see god giving him
[38:56] instruction
[38:56] then we can take that to ourselves and
[38:58] say that's for me amen it's not just the
[39:00] holy ghost that's ju that is for me amen
[39:03] so he says there shall not any man be
[39:05] able to stand before thee
[39:06] all the days of the life thy life now we
[39:08] can look at this two ways okay
[39:10] the glasshaft empty guy says i'm going
[39:12] to be fighting the rest of my life
[39:15] because that's what he says he says
[39:16] there's battles coming
[39:18] and so the the guy that says the glass
[39:20] is half empty he's saying
[39:21] i'm going to be fighting all my life and
[39:23] maybe he says i don't want to have
[39:24] anything to do with this
[39:26] you're telling me i'm going to be
[39:27] fighting all my life and i don't want to
[39:28] do that i'd rather have a life of ease
[39:30] i'd rather stay on this side of jordan
[39:32] i'd rather stay where the land's already
[39:33] been won
[39:34] i don't want to go over and possess this
[39:36] amen but then we have the believer that
[39:37] looks at that
[39:38] and says i'm going to be victorious all
[39:40] of my life
[39:41] no matter what comes against me yes i'm
[39:43] going to be fighting all my life
[39:44] yes i'm going to have this sticky flesh
[39:46] yes i'm going to have this carnal nature
[39:48] that's
[39:48] that's stuck on me by genetics and by
[39:50] the fall of sin but no matter what i'm
[39:52] going to be victorious all my life
[39:54] because you said
[39:54] no one's going to be able to stand
[39:56] before me amen so we want to find
[39:58] ourselves on the side that says
[39:59] not i'm going to be battling but i'm
[40:01] going to be winning all the days of my
[40:03] life amen because he's told me
[40:04] that he will be with us amen you are
[40:06] more than a conqueror the scripture says
[40:09] look at it this way satan had almost 500
[40:11] years on about 475 give or take
[40:14] to prepare for the children of israel
[40:17] he knew the promise the promise had been
[40:19] written the promise had been spoken the
[40:21] promise had been handed down
[40:22] from generation to generation of israel
[40:24] satan is not caught unawares
[40:25] when it comes to the invasion of canaan
[40:27] he knows they're coming back
[40:28] he knows where abraham's walked he knows
[40:30] that god has told him everywhere you
[40:32] walk is your possession
[40:33] now he knows that he's telling joshua
[40:35] this as well satan has prepared for 475
[40:38] years
[40:38] to try and hold back the invasion of the
[40:40] israelites into canaan
[40:42] and guess what it doesn't do him any
[40:44] good because god takes on the biggest
[40:46] city the hardest city the one with the
[40:47] tallest thickest walls
[40:49] and he knocks it down supernaturally in
[40:50] their very first battle scene
[40:52] right everything that satan did for 500
[40:55] years amounted to a hill of beans it
[40:57] didn't
[40:57] it didn't matter a lick when the
[40:58] israelites crossed over jordan because
[41:00] god was going before them
[41:01] and knocking down every barrier amen so
[41:04] for us we look at it it's been two
[41:06] thousand years since the promise was
[41:07] given to us
[41:08] right paul comes along whatever 30 40 50
[41:10] years after jesus
[41:12] and he starts giving us all these things
[41:13] and it's 2 000 years later and satan's
[41:15] had 2 thousand years
[41:16] to develop his tactics amen to focus on
[41:18] the bride of christ to focus on the
[41:20] elected seed
[41:21] and yet we read the back of the book and
[41:22] it still says we win
[41:24] amen nothing's going to stop us nothing
[41:26] he sets against us is going to hold us
[41:28] back
[41:28] amen doesn't matter how corrupt he makes
[41:30] people's minds how much he gets
[41:31] entrenched in the government how much he
[41:32] gets entrenched in the education system
[41:34] how much he's twisted and spun the world
[41:37] around in his hands
[41:38] it's not going to stop the believer from
[41:39] taking her place in her position in
[41:41] christ amen
[41:43] amen the scripture says if you speak to
[41:45] this mountain and don't doubt it in your
[41:46] heart
[41:47] it has to move amen and so satan doesn't
[41:50] matter how big the mountain is
[41:51] it's got to move amen if you believe in
[41:54] your heart
[41:54] amen our pastors preaching on faith put
[41:56] it together with this and we've got a
[41:57] pretty powerful
[41:59] idea amen faith to speak it and believe
[42:01] it and then we watch it move amen
[42:03] he says as i was with moses so i will so
[42:06] will i be with thee i will not fail thee
[42:09] nor forsake thee now let's talk as if
[42:12] that was
[42:13] me there or you there okay as i was with
[42:15] moses so i will be with
[42:17] maureen coffey as i was with moses so i
[42:20] will be with selena corlett
[42:22] as i was with moses so i will be with
[42:24] brenda coffey or josh columbo
[42:26] or kim coffee right as i was with
[42:29] brother branham so i will be with thee
[42:30] is the way we want to read that amen
[42:32] as god was with the great one before you
[42:34] as god was with christ
[42:36] himself so i will be with you i will not
[42:39] leave fail thee nor forsake thee so
[42:41] there's nothing about me and that that
[42:43] takes
[42:44] place except that i receive it amen it
[42:46] is not the arm of flesh that i'm leaning
[42:48] on it's not by my strength or my
[42:49] discipline or my skills or my gifts
[42:51] but rather just that i am the receiver
[42:54] of this i am the inheritor of this
[42:56] and it is him that is doing the work in
[42:57] my life amen
[42:59] there is nothing here that i have to do
[43:01] except accept it
[43:02] believe it and act on it amen
[43:05] our portion of this promise is to hear
[43:07] it to receive it
[43:08] to accept it to believe it to trust and
[43:11] to know that god is with us and he will
[43:13] never fail us he will never leave us
[43:15] he will never forsake us and then we
[43:17] rest on that
[43:18] amen the position of the believer is
[43:20] rest
[43:21] we've said that many times before verse
[43:24] six he says be strong and of a good
[43:26] courage for under this people shalt thou
[43:28] divide for an inheritance the land
[43:30] which i swear unto their fathers to give
[43:32] to them now there is a work for us in
[43:33] this scripture
[43:35] and then he says be strong and of a good
[43:37] courage
[43:38] so that's what we're required to do is
[43:40] be strong and of a good courage
[43:42] press forward take what he said and move
[43:45] forward amen
[43:45] don't be cowed by satan don't be looking
[43:48] at what satan's offering but be looking
[43:49] to what
[43:50] god has told us and be strong and of a
[43:52] good courage amen
[43:53] put your strength in what he said not in
[43:55] what you have or what you've done
[43:56] yourself amen
[43:58] courage doesn't mean be unafraid it
[44:01] doesn't mean that there's no fear
[44:03] courage means you press past the fear
[44:05] because there's something in you
[44:06] that desires what is on the other side
[44:08] of that then what is faith than what
[44:09] you're dealing with right now amen you'd
[44:11] rather have the victory
[44:12] and face the trial that you're facing
[44:14] whether it's something that just
[44:16] you know breaks you down whether it's a
[44:17] trial of your health a trial of your
[44:19] relationship a trial of your marriage
[44:21] trial of your job whatever it might be
[44:23] what you want on the other side is
[44:25] is worth more to you than the fear or
[44:27] the hurt or the possible pain or
[44:28] humiliation
[44:29] of where you're standing right now
[44:31] courage is when you recognize there's
[44:32] something better and you're willing to
[44:34] go for that
[44:34] no matter how much it costs you amen so
[44:37] we do
[44:38] what we press for we are strong and we
[44:39] have a good courage not because of how
[44:41] we feel
[44:42] right but because we know what's on the
[44:45] other side is better than how we're
[44:46] going to feel going through this amen
[44:49] i'm moving forward no matter what that's
[44:51] what this means courage i'm moving
[44:52] forward no matter what
[44:55] verse 7 says he told joshua before sorry
[44:59] not verse 7. this is a quote brother
[45:01] brown says he told joshua before he
[45:02] crossed over he said be thou very
[45:04] courageous for the lord thy god is with
[45:06] thee whithersoever thou goest
[45:08] you say well if god told me like he did
[45:10] joshua i would have some courage too
[45:14] read the next line he says he has told
[45:16] every believer the same thing
[45:18] i'll be with you always even to the end
[45:20] of the world i'll never leave thee nor
[45:22] forsake thee
[45:23] courageous let's go take the promise
[45:26] then god gave us the promise he says
[45:28] let's be a real witness what's a real
[45:30] witness is when you have it
[45:32] a witness is not supposed to be given of
[45:33] somebody else's testimony of witnesses
[45:35] of your testimony it has to be firsthand
[45:38] amen
[45:38] we want to be found where the word is a
[45:40] testimony in us
[45:41] where we're not testifying to brother
[45:43] bob's healing but we're testifying of
[45:44] jonathan's healing amen we're not
[45:46] testifying of joshua's deliverance we're
[45:48] testifying of jonathan's deliverance or
[45:49] salinas deliverance or paul's
[45:51] deliverance whoever it may be
[45:52] the witness says he's saying let's be a
[45:54] real witness and have it in us not just
[45:55] look to joshua and say
[45:57] one day many many years ago god did this
[45:59] but today god did this
[46:01] yesterday god this for did this for me
[46:03] or did that for me and there's other
[46:04] things and guess what i'm looking for
[46:06] him to do this
[46:07] and that and the other thing in my life
[46:08] amen the true witness is when it's in
[46:10] you not when it's in somebody
[46:13] he says now when you say you've got
[46:15] faith by for divine healing
[46:17] and something strikes you and says move
[46:19] out that's the confirmation that god has
[46:21] received your faith for divine healing
[46:24] he says that's right when you've got
[46:26] courage to put your faith in action
[46:28] but when you say you got faith and are
[46:30] afraid to let it go your faith is dead
[46:33] see but when you got faith and willing
[46:35] to let it go
[46:36] go what go and do what god said to do
[46:39] then god's confirming it with the signs
[46:41] following and you'll see your healing
[46:44] that's true when you've got faith so how
[46:46] do you know when you've got courage
[46:48] when you put your faith into action amen
[46:50] when you take the word of god and you
[46:51] don't just put it in your mind but you
[46:53] put it on your lips
[46:54] and you say lord i'm confessing it i'm
[46:56] believing it and then as we said last
[46:58] service he's the high priest of our
[46:59] confession
[47:00] and he goes and he intercedes to bring
[47:01] the word forth into your life amen
[47:05] now joshua is told three times in this
[47:08] in this series of scriptures here to
[47:11] have strength
[47:12] and to have courage now when god says
[47:14] something three times that means it's a
[47:16] big deal because he doesn't do it very
[47:17] often in scripture where he just goes
[47:19] bang bang bang he says
[47:20] three things one over the other over
[47:22] again and over again amen so i want us
[47:23] to
[47:24] to see here that there's a requirement
[47:26] here for courage and strength
[47:28] you're going to have to be strong you're
[47:30] going to have to be strong in the lord
[47:31] you're going to have to be strong and
[47:32] looking to the promise not to the
[47:34] symptoms
[47:34] have to be strong and looking to the
[47:36] word rather than to what is going on
[47:38] amen
[47:38] you've got to be able to see beyond that
[47:40] and look to the mountain moving rather
[47:42] than the size of the mountain in front
[47:44] of you
[47:45] amen he says now he says be strong and
[47:47] courageous for
[47:48] unto this people shalt thou divide for
[47:50] an inheritance the land which i swear
[47:52] unto their fathers to give them amen so
[47:54] the first purpose for strength and
[47:56] courage
[47:56] is to place the people positionally is
[47:59] to put them to where
[48:01] sorry matt don't uh don't move forward
[48:02] there i've got that yeah
[48:04] um the first reason for it was so that
[48:07] he could place the people positionally
[48:09] now you say that doesn't sound very
[48:11] difficult but one to place them
[48:12] positionally he has to take the land
[48:14] first
[48:14] so he's got to be strong and courageous
[48:16] to take the land and then he has to be
[48:18] able to stand there and say this is your
[48:20] possession
[48:21] and this is where you're going you know
[48:23] this is where this tribe's going and
[48:24] this is where this tribe's going
[48:25] and i can guarantee you there are some
[48:27] people that maybe thought that isn't
[48:29] where i want to be
[48:30] right i look over there and i see that
[48:32] they have the beautiful mountains and
[48:33] i'm stuck on the sea
[48:36] not many people might say that but there
[48:37] are people that like the mountains over
[48:38] the ocean you know
[48:39] or maybe they're stuck in the plains of
[48:41] saskatchewan
[48:43] rather than the beautiful coasts of
[48:45] newfoundland
[48:46] right and they say no i want to be in
[48:49] newfoundland
[48:51] wherever it might be i guarantee you
[48:53] that people come up and say joshua buddy
[48:55] buddy old pal we're good right i really
[48:58] don't like where i'm at
[49:00] and joshua has to say listen god already
[49:03] told moses
[49:04] this is where you're supposed to go so
[49:06] you're going there and you can talk to
[49:08] me and you can cry and you can go
[49:09] and talk to people and try and
[49:10] politicize it to get yourself into a
[49:12] place that you want to be but guess what
[49:14] god has told you this is where you're
[49:16] going to be and if you don't go there
[49:18] you're not going to be blessed
[49:19] you're not going to be blessed if you
[49:21] don't go where god puts you because god
[49:22] will only bless you in the place that he
[49:24] has called you to be
[49:25] and if you go and you try start trying
[49:27] to be somebody else or do something else
[49:29] that god hasn't called you to you're
[49:30] gonna get yourself in a world of hurt
[49:32] why because you're making yourselves
[49:34] into a denomination you're going by
[49:35] men's leadership
[49:36] rather than gods amen
[49:40] then he says it again only be thou
[49:42] strong and very courageous not just
[49:44] strong and courageous but very
[49:46] courageous
[49:47] that thou mayest observe to do according
[49:49] to all the law which moses my servant
[49:51] commanded thee
[49:52] turn not from it to the right hand nor
[49:54] to the left that thou mayest prosper
[49:56] whether so ever thou goest amen so the
[49:59] second reason for
[50:00] that he has to be strong now and very
[50:02] courageous not just courageous but very
[50:04] courageous
[50:04] is that he has to stay with the word
[50:06] amen
[50:09] this one's even tougher than the first
[50:11] one because he's got to do it all
[50:13] according to the way god said
[50:16] because often times we'll go and we'll
[50:17] try and do something for the lord and
[50:19] we'll try and do it our way instead of
[50:20] god's way
[50:21] we'll try and do it on our timeline
[50:22] instead of god's timeline we'll try and
[50:24] do with our strength instead of god's
[50:25] strength
[50:26] and we get into problems and we see that
[50:28] joshua does this in the second battle
[50:30] because when he sends off to take ai he
[50:31] says i'm just going to send a small army
[50:33] no
[50:34] god doesn't tell joshua to send a small
[50:36] army joshua says
[50:37] we're going to send out a small army and
[50:39] they get defeated we know there was a
[50:41] problem in the camp amen with
[50:42] with aitkin and whatnot but the problem
[50:44] is joshua had to follow leadership on
[50:46] how this was going to go
[50:47] all the way through from start to finish
[50:49] and if he got outside of the leadership
[50:51] of the
[50:51] of the lord then he was going to have
[50:53] problems and like i said
[50:55] the only way he's going to get into
[50:57] trouble if he gets out of that
[50:58] and then we'll dig into it a little more
[51:00] when we get into ai a little a little
[51:01] later amen but when he's going into the
[51:03] trials and battles
[51:04] joshua has to have confidence that he's
[51:07] in the will of god
[51:08] amen it's the same thing for us when
[51:10] we're heading into things when things
[51:11] are falling down around you when the
[51:13] struggle hits when the trial hits
[51:14] you've got to be able to say i'm in the
[51:16] will of god and if you're not in the
[51:18] will of god bring yourself back to the
[51:20] will of god
[51:21] so that he can move on your behalf but
[51:22] when you're walking around in your own
[51:24] understanding in your own ways and your
[51:25] own ideas
[51:26] and your own preferences god can't move
[51:28] because you're out of his will
[51:30] so he's got to bring you back and
[51:31] sometimes his trial is to bring you into
[51:33] his will
[51:34] and then it goes away but other times
[51:35] it's to bring you into his will and then
[51:37] he allows you to overcome it
[51:38] because you've suddenly heated him and
[51:40] you brought yourself back into
[51:41] submission
[51:42] to the holy spirit amen
[51:45] now he says do all according to all the
[51:47] law which moses my servant commanded
[51:49] thee
[51:49] we read earlier moses my servant is dead
[51:51] but that doesn't mean moses sir
[51:53] moses message is no longer valid moses
[51:56] my servant is dead does not mean the
[51:57] message of moses is now
[51:59] nolan void and has no effect any more
[52:01] than it does brother branham my servant
[52:02] is dead and brother branham's message is
[52:04] now nolan void amen
[52:06] what is the joshua commission it is to
[52:08] fulfill
[52:09] the word of moses the promise through
[52:10] moses amen and so it is for the bribe
[52:12] brother branham's gone but his message
[52:14] isn't null and void
[52:15] but rather now the ministry of the bride
[52:17] is to do what to fulfill the message
[52:19] that he has brought
[52:20] to obey it brother branham says if i can
[52:22] just get you to stand still and put it
[52:24] on you
[52:25] it'll prepare you for a rapture amen so
[52:27] our purpose is to fulfill
[52:29] what the message brought to us amen and
[52:31] it's no different for joshua
[52:33] is his purpose is to fulfill moses
[52:35] message
[52:36] it's to stand firm on the word and in
[52:38] doing so that will bring
[52:39] the fulfillment amen he says turn not
[52:43] from it to the right hand nor to the
[52:44] left
[52:45] that thou mayest prosper wherever so
[52:47] ever though ghost
[52:48] you can't deviate you're not allowed to
[52:50] take a runner to the left or to the
[52:51] right on a whim he says you can't
[52:53] deviate you've got to stay with the word
[52:56] brother braham says this he says joshua
[52:58] node this commission
[53:00] was tremendous did you notice there when
[53:02] joshua started to cross jordan how
[53:04] joshua remembered his commission
[53:06] let not this book of the law my word
[53:07] depart out of your mouth
[53:09] in other words joshua i don't care what
[53:10] the tribe says what all the clergy says
[53:13] stay with this word for then thou shalt
[53:16] make thy ways prosperous
[53:18] no matter how many big things they do
[53:20] how many little things they do
[53:21] how many organizations they made stay
[53:23] with the word joshua oh my
[53:25] stay with the word this word this word
[53:28] shall not
[53:29] depart out of your mouth he says
[53:32] if the word says do a certain thing do
[53:35] it
[53:36] i don't care what the organization says
[53:38] do it anyhow
[53:39] that's the joshua that god is waiting
[53:42] for turn not one
[53:43] inch one iota stay right with the word
[53:47] the only way to prosper is to stay with
[53:49] the word of god the only way to overcome
[53:51] is to stay with the word of god and the
[53:52] only way to inherit is to stay
[53:54] with the word of god he says now
[53:57] remember this book of the law shall not
[53:59] depart out of thy mouth
[54:00] so he had god's word as i was with moses
[54:03] move right on out and as i was with
[54:05] moses so will i be with you
[54:07] i'll not fail you now listen to this you
[54:10] may fail me
[54:11] but i won't fail you but
[54:14] if you fail me my grace is sufficient
[54:18] i'll bear you right back up just keep
[54:20] moving on as long as you stay with the
[54:23] word
[54:23] i'll take care of you and again we see
[54:25] that in ai
[54:26] joshua failed right he failed that was
[54:30] the leadership and brother brahm talks
[54:31] about i won't go into it for the sake of
[54:32] time
[54:33] joshua messed up he messed up and it
[54:36] comes on the leadership it falls on the
[54:38] leadership to take the blame for that
[54:39] that wasn't aiken's fault that was
[54:41] joshua's fault because he didn't go and
[54:42] he didn't make sure everything was right
[54:44] amen but he says joshua if you fail i'll
[54:47] still bear you right back up
[54:48] and after that we see there are no more
[54:50] failures in joshua's life he learns his
[54:52] lesson
[54:52] and he goes forward and he defeats
[54:54] everyone including causing the sun and
[54:56] the moon to stand still so he can get a
[54:57] bit more time to finish the job one day
[54:59] amen
[55:00] god backs him up though you fail me yet
[55:03] i will give you grace and bear you back
[55:05] up amen
[55:06] so let me tell you this when a
[55:07] professing believer can look you in the
[55:09] eye and say
[55:10] i'm going to do something and it's
[55:11] against the word you ought to be able to
[55:13] say brother
[55:14] sister you can do it but god won't bless
[55:17] you
[55:18] and he won't support you in it and you
[55:20] can get a nice house you can get a nice
[55:21] car you can get a nice job
[55:23] you can get a nice place of living you
[55:24] can get comfort and ease of life
[55:26] but god will not be in it and until you
[55:28] come back to him
[55:29] it's not going to change amen you can't
[55:31] go off the word and be blessed in
[55:32] heavenly places you cannot do it amen
[55:35] and we've got to be able to stand firm
[55:36] on that
[55:37] because i'm finding it's more and more
[55:38] today that people are getting more and
[55:39] more bold
[55:40] in the fact that they do not stand 100
[55:43] with the word of god
[55:45] right it's little things remember what
[55:46] he said in that quote before he says
[55:48] turn out one inch one
[55:49] iota and the thing is you get off a
[55:51] little bit here
[55:52] it doesn't make much of a difference
[55:54] coming over this but by the time i'm at
[55:55] the back door i'm six inches off of
[55:57] center amen
[55:58] and the thing is when i go seven years
[56:00] or ten years down the road i'm a mile
[56:01] off and i'm not even close to god and i
[56:03] don't know where i went off
[56:04] because it was so simple so so just a
[56:07] slight variation at the very beginning
[56:08] you've got to stay strict with the word
[56:10] of god he tells joshua
[56:11] stay strict and trust his grace when you
[56:13] get off that he's going to bring you
[56:15] back him and you'll be quick to come
[56:16] back and say
[56:17] whoa whoa we've got a problem because
[56:19] things aren't happening the way the word
[56:21] says it's supposed to happen in my life
[56:22] and the only way that goes on is if
[56:24] they're sin in the camp
[56:25] amen listen as josh as god continues
[56:29] ammunition
[56:30] is admonition to joshua here now in
[56:32] verse 8. he says this book of the law
[56:34] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[56:36] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[56:38] night that thou mayest observe
[56:39] according to observe to do according to
[56:43] all that is written
[56:44] therein for then for then thou shalt
[56:47] make thy way prosperous
[56:48] and then thou shalt have good success
[56:50] amen there's a lot here let's break it
[56:51] down
[56:52] it says this book of the law shall not
[56:53] depart out of thy mouth
[56:55] god starts with a speaking bride it's
[56:57] interesting to say here
[56:59] it says it shall not depart out of thy
[57:00] mouth he doesn't say it doesn't shall
[57:01] not depart out of thy mind shall not
[57:03] depart out of thy thoughts shall not
[57:04] depart out of our writings he says it
[57:06] shall not depart out of thy mouth
[57:08] you've got to speak what the word says
[57:10] and it's not enough to think it and
[57:11] agree with it in your head
[57:12] you have to speak it amen i've said many
[57:15] times over this pulpit
[57:16] that a confession requires you to speak
[57:19] a confession is not a there's no such
[57:21] thing as a thought confession
[57:22] there is a voice confession you have to
[57:24] speak it you have to put yourself
[57:26] on the record that this is what i'm
[57:28] saying and this is what i'm believing
[57:30] this is what i'm thinking but i'm going
[57:31] to speak it out loud amen
[57:33] and as we said last time he is the high
[57:34] priest of your confession not the high
[57:36] priest of your thoughts
[57:37] he's a high priest of your confession so
[57:39] you've got to speak
[57:40] he's saying to joshua you got to be a
[57:42] speaking leader
[57:43] you've got a one that says the word of
[57:45] god not just thinks the word of god
[57:50] brother brahm says this this is a prayer
[57:52] he says lord jesus
[57:53] in the way of humility and the way of
[57:55] humbleness i offer you this congregation
[57:57] that's on their feet
[57:58] i offer them to you because they have
[58:00] stood in response to the call
[58:02] they're seeking deeper things
[58:07] listen now they're seeking
[58:10] more life after hearing that the blood
[58:13] of jesus so thoroughly cleanses
[58:15] that there's no more nothing that the
[58:17] complete word of god rests within them
[58:20] that the very command of their own voice
[58:22] is creative power
[58:24] because in them is the holy ghost
[58:28] and this holy ghost is a creator he
[58:31] makes things
[58:32] come to pass because he speaks the word
[58:35] and the word spoken becomes god in
[58:38] action amen
[58:38] the word spoken becomes god in action
[58:42] he says they speak what it is god
[58:45] speaking why
[58:46] because them is the holy ghost and them
[58:48] is the holy ghost
[58:49] and he is a creator what you speak is
[58:52] creative amen he says when you speak
[58:56] the word it puts god into
[58:59] action amen so to take this land you've
[59:01] got to be a speaking bride
[59:03] not a thinking bride but a speaking
[59:05] bride a confessing bride of the promise
[59:07] of the word of god amen
[59:10] he says thy word is the truth and every
[59:13] man that'll read the bible and believe
[59:15] every word that bible says and follow
[59:17] its instructions and receive the same
[59:19] holy ghost that they received
[59:21] the same way they received it the same
[59:23] results they received it
[59:24] the same power they got when they
[59:26] received it he knows who his papa and
[59:28] mama was
[59:29] he knows he's washed in the blood of
[59:31] jesus christ born of the spirit
[59:33] filled with god's unction he knows where
[59:35] he's standing sure
[59:36] he's in canaan he knows where he come
[59:38] from that's the way it is with a real
[59:40] christian
[59:41] ask him have you received the holy ghost
[59:43] since you believed amen brother
[59:45] have you received the holy ghost since
[59:46] you believed amen sister
[59:49] right you've got to know that you have
[59:51] what is required to be in that land amen
[59:55] he continues he says but thou shalt
[59:56] meditate therein day and night
[59:58] amen we started with the speaking part
[1:00:00] but how do you get to the speaking part
[1:00:02] you've got to meditate on it day and
[1:00:03] night you've got to dwell on this
[1:00:05] you've got to put yourself into it amen
[1:00:07] you've got to put it in front of you
[1:00:08] you've got to soak into it amen
[1:00:10] you've got to let it have an effect and
[1:00:12] the effect is always that you will speak
[1:00:14] the word of god amen that where meditate
[1:00:17] means to dwell on
[1:00:19] and to speak it is not to just sit there
[1:00:22] and listen and think about it but it
[1:00:24] must end up with a speaking
[1:00:26] amen it can't just stay in your mind
[1:00:28] meditation these days so often is you
[1:00:30] know this
[1:00:31] thing and it's all in your head the
[1:00:32] scripture there i looked up the greek
[1:00:34] word and it is not just to think on but
[1:00:36] it is to think on to dwell on
[1:00:38] and then to speak amen so that your
[1:00:40] words are spoken fitly as the scripture
[1:00:42] says
[1:00:43] so that you're speaking according to
[1:00:45] what has soaked into you
[1:00:46] by the holy spirit through the word of
[1:00:48] god amen
[1:00:49] psalms 119 says wherewith all shall a
[1:00:52] young man cleanse his way
[1:00:53] young men listen up young sisters listen
[1:00:55] up how are you going to clean your
[1:00:57] life up it says by taking heed there too
[1:01:00] according to thy word
[1:01:02] with my whole heart have i sought thee
[1:01:05] oh let me not wander from thy
[1:01:07] commandments thy word have i hid in mine
[1:01:09] heart that i might not sin against see
[1:01:12] remember brother brahm said sin is what
[1:01:14] unbelief
[1:01:15] and then unbelief leads to an action
[1:01:17] that is against the word amen
[1:01:19] blessed art thou o lord teach me thy
[1:01:21] statutes
[1:01:22] with my lips have i declared all the
[1:01:24] judgments of thy mouth
[1:01:26] i have rejoiced in the way of thy
[1:01:29] testimonies as much as in all riches
[1:01:31] in other words i have rejoiced as much
[1:01:34] in what god has done for me
[1:01:35] as i have for the good things that i
[1:01:37] have in life
[1:01:39] now some of us maybe don't have as much
[1:01:40] as others and that's an easier thing to
[1:01:42] do
[1:01:43] but he says i have rejoiced more in what
[1:01:45] god has given me then i've rejoiced for
[1:01:47] anything else that this world could
[1:01:48] offer me
[1:01:49] i will meditate in thy precepts and have
[1:01:51] respect unto thy ways
[1:01:53] i will delight myself and thy statutes i
[1:01:56] will not
[1:01:56] forget thy word deal bountifully with
[1:01:59] thy servant
[1:02:00] that i may live and keep thy word open
[1:02:03] thou mine
[1:02:04] eyes that i may behold wondrous things
[1:02:06] out of thy law
[1:02:07] who wants the promised land show of
[1:02:09] hands
[1:02:11] how many of us do that show hands
[1:02:15] no this is what he's saying can we put
[1:02:18] ourselves there that's what he told
[1:02:19] joshua
[1:02:20] this is his instruction to joshua i know
[1:02:22] this is a psalm but this is the idea
[1:02:24] what drill it into yourself amen soak
[1:02:27] into it
[1:02:28] let it just be something that surrounds
[1:02:30] you that envelops you
[1:02:31] and then something so that when you
[1:02:33] speak what comes out is his precepts
[1:02:35] amen his principles his word his law his
[1:02:38] direction his unction amen
[1:02:42] you know what we get a lot of times
[1:02:45] enthusiasm
[1:02:47] we get enthusiasm in the word of god and
[1:02:50] we get ra rod and we get pumped up but
[1:02:52] you know what
[1:02:53] enthusiasm doesn't do well with struggle
[1:02:56] enthusiasm doesn't hold up to struggle
[1:02:59] because
[1:03:00] enthusiasm is a temporary high but it
[1:03:02] doesn't give you any strength it's good
[1:03:04] for a moment it's great
[1:03:05] it's great to shout and dance and yell
[1:03:07] and clap and all these things and praise
[1:03:08] the lord that has to be in the life of
[1:03:10] believer
[1:03:11] amen it says there in verse 14 i have
[1:03:12] rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies
[1:03:14] we ought to have a testimony
[1:03:15] but enthusiasm doesn't take you through
[1:03:17] it into a testimony amen you've got to
[1:03:19] have strength
[1:03:20] and you've got to have courage amen amen
[1:03:23] that's the danger there is that you're
[1:03:24] going to get pumped up rather than
[1:03:26] encouraged and strengthened in the lord
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:29] amen but he tells joshua meditate on it
[1:03:31] and you don't get to pick and choose
[1:03:32] joshua
[1:03:33] that's where denominations fail that's
[1:03:35] where prosperity gospel fails
[1:03:37] is they pick the good stuff they pick
[1:03:39] the best parts the choice meets amen
[1:03:41] the most delicious food out of the
[1:03:43] scripture and they say that's mine and
[1:03:44] they go and they act on it in faith and
[1:03:46] guess what they get it a lot of the time
[1:03:48] but that's not the full thing and the
[1:03:50] thing is if you don't obey it fully then
[1:03:52] you don't get the full inheritance
[1:03:53] amen if you only do a partial submission
[1:03:56] to the word of god if you're only
[1:03:57] speaking a portion of the word of god
[1:03:58] then that's all you're going to get
[1:04:00] but you've got to take all of the words
[1:04:01] so that you can get all of the
[1:04:02] inheritance that's offered to you amen
[1:04:04] amen incomplete surrender to the word of
[1:04:06] god leads to an incomplete inheritance
[1:04:08] every single time
[1:04:11] he says for them thou shalt make thy way
[1:04:12] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[1:04:14] consent
[1:04:15] good success so if you do all those
[1:04:17] things if you meditate
[1:04:18] day and night in it he says then your
[1:04:21] way will be prosperous and then you'll
[1:04:22] have success
[1:04:23] not just success but he says good
[1:04:25] success what's the difference
[1:04:28] you can start a business and you can do
[1:04:29] a million dollars a year in revenue
[1:04:31] that's success you can start a business
[1:04:33] and you can do a billion dollars
[1:04:35] that's good success that's what they
[1:04:36] call a unicorn today is a billion dollar
[1:04:38] valuation for a business
[1:04:40] in god's eyes you know what good success
[1:04:41] is lasting success
[1:04:44] it's not a one-time deal it's not a here
[1:04:46] today and gone tomorrow but it's
[1:04:48] something that stays with you it's
[1:04:49] something that you have all the time
[1:04:51] it's peace it's rest it's joy it's love
[1:04:53] it's all of the fruit of the holy spirit
[1:04:55] day in and day out you've got it that's
[1:04:57] good success amen it's something that
[1:04:59] god gives and when god gives he doesn't
[1:05:00] take it away amen
[1:05:03] matthew 18 or matthew 6 33 says seek ye
[1:05:06] first the kingdom of god
[1:05:07] and his righteousness and all these
[1:05:09] things shall be added unto you meditate
[1:05:11] day and night in it
[1:05:12] and then what you've asked for is going
[1:05:14] to be added to you the things that you
[1:05:15] have need of even the desires of your
[1:05:17] heart
[1:05:17] scripture says he'll give them to you
[1:05:19] amen what do you want success
[1:05:21] or good success i'll take good success
[1:05:24] every time
[1:05:27] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:05:28] scripture says
[1:05:30] back to joshua 1 9 have i not commanded
[1:05:33] thee okay the first two times was a
[1:05:35] we're having a conversation
[1:05:37] now he says have i not commanded thee be
[1:05:40] strong
[1:05:41] and of a good courage be not afraid
[1:05:44] neither
[1:05:44] be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is
[1:05:47] with thee
[1:05:48] wither so ever thou goes the third
[1:05:50] purpose for being strong enough of a
[1:05:51] courage
[1:05:52] good courage is by remembering and for
[1:05:54] to remember
[1:05:55] that god is with you everywhere that you
[1:05:57] go amen
[1:05:58] be strong enough of a good courage
[1:05:59] because god is with you amen
[1:06:03] it says be not afraid neither be thou
[1:06:05] dismayed for the lord that god is with
[1:06:06] thee wither so ever
[1:06:07] thou goes it says don't be afraid and
[1:06:10] don't be dismayed
[1:06:11] you know what it means to be dispaid
[1:06:13] shattered
[1:06:14] this may mean shatter in that verse to
[1:06:16] be discouraged
[1:06:18] and to be broken amen and satan would
[1:06:19] like nothing better
[1:06:21] than to shatter us amen and how many
[1:06:23] times have we been through things
[1:06:24] and the worst thing is when it happens
[1:06:26] in a church situation isn't it or a
[1:06:28] family situation somebody you love and
[1:06:30] trust a pastor a minister maybe
[1:06:32] somebody that you that you really held
[1:06:34] in high regard and then
[1:06:35] what happens is there's a crack comes
[1:06:37] there's a break comes you see maybe
[1:06:38] the hinder parts are the the lesser
[1:06:40] things that are quite so good about them
[1:06:42] and what is it it shatters something
[1:06:44] within you because you had such
[1:06:46] a a high regard for that person amen
[1:06:49] or that that relationship or that
[1:06:50] situation whatever it might be
[1:06:52] discouragement is satan's probably one
[1:06:54] of his greatest weapons
[1:06:55] amen is that he gets you discouraged he
[1:06:58] gets you looking at the situation he
[1:06:59] gets you looking at your failures
[1:07:00] gets you looking at your problems and
[1:07:02] you start to say i can't do this
[1:07:05] but you never could do it in the first
[1:07:06] place amen you've got to look to the
[1:07:08] word that's why you've got to meditate
[1:07:09] on the water so that you don't look at
[1:07:10] yourself
[1:07:11] and you look to the promises of god amen
[1:07:13] we're believers and we believe in the
[1:07:15] impossible
[1:07:16] and whether god holds off for delays
[1:07:17] that doesn't hold us back amen we keep
[1:07:19] believing
[1:07:20] we keep having faith that he's going to
[1:07:21] do the work that he promised
[1:07:24] this is a tremendous quote a little more
[1:07:27] direct than i'm used to brother branham
[1:07:30] he says am i brother don't you be afraid
[1:07:32] to ask god for anything
[1:07:33] okay that's not so bad you must demand
[1:07:36] god
[1:07:37] or ask god for anything that he has
[1:07:40] promised
[1:07:41] demand brother branham you've got to
[1:07:43] demand god
[1:07:45] he says for if i am introducing a god
[1:07:47] that's omnipotent and all-powerful
[1:07:49] and if i be a servant of god i must do
[1:07:51] the works of god
[1:07:53] now that's no different for him than it
[1:07:55] is for any one of us you don't have to
[1:07:56] be a minister to say this amen
[1:07:58] these signs shall follow them that
[1:07:59] believe right
[1:08:01] and if i do the work of god i must
[1:08:04] demand of god to bring
[1:08:05] these things to pass because
[1:08:08] he is demanding of me to produce
[1:08:11] the impossible i have
[1:08:15] to ask him i have to call upon him
[1:08:18] and stand there and say god you promised
[1:08:20] it
[1:08:21] so do you every person
[1:08:25] demanding is not an attitude of
[1:08:27] demanding in that
[1:08:28] lord you better do this it's lord you
[1:08:31] said it
[1:08:32] now i'm believing lord you said it i'm
[1:08:34] believing
[1:08:35] lord you said it i'm believing lord you
[1:08:38] said it i'm waiting on you lord i'm
[1:08:39] trusting on you
[1:08:40] lord i'm believing in you lord you said
[1:08:43] it and i'm just repeating it back to you
[1:08:45] amen
[1:08:45] brother braham says god loves to hear
[1:08:47] his word repeat it back to him
[1:08:49] and that's how you demand something of
[1:08:51] god if we can put it that way
[1:08:52] is that you repeat his word back to him
[1:08:54] and say lord you said this is mine
[1:08:56] and i'm claiming it today
[1:09:00] the end of that verse says for the lord
[1:09:01] thy god is with thee wither so ever
[1:09:04] though go us
[1:09:04] amen we said before and this is a
[1:09:06] similar scripture
[1:09:07] where's joshua in this
[1:09:11] it's all about god god's with you joshua
[1:09:14] don't be afraid don't be dismayed don't
[1:09:16] be shattered don't be broken don't be
[1:09:18] discouraged
[1:09:19] because the lord is with you are you
[1:09:21] going to have great success joshua
[1:09:23] because you're a great general because
[1:09:24] you have great armies with great weapons
[1:09:27] no you're going to have it because the
[1:09:29] lord is with you
[1:09:30] you're the beneficiary joshua and this
[1:09:32] is god's working and all you have to do
[1:09:34] is stay with his word
[1:09:35] and he will do everything that he
[1:09:37] promised to do in this land amen
[1:09:39] amen let's turn to ephesians 1 if we
[1:09:40] will this morning this evening
[1:09:49] ephesians 1 verse 1 again
[1:09:55] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[1:09:57] will of god to the saints which are at
[1:09:59] ephesus and to the faithful in christ
[1:10:01] jesus
[1:10:02] grace be to you and peace from god our
[1:10:04] father and from the lord jesus christ
[1:10:06] amen as we said last time this is a work
[1:10:07] of grace through and through
[1:10:09] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:10:11] lord jesus christ who hath blessed us
[1:10:12] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:10:14] places
[1:10:15] in christ now i want to stop here and
[1:10:17] just cover something that we touched on
[1:10:18] last time but i want to drop into it
[1:10:20] just a little bit more where we talked
[1:10:21] about all spiritual blessings
[1:10:23] amen because we want to remember that
[1:10:25] the spirit all spiritual blessings is
[1:10:26] not just the feel-goods
[1:10:28] amen or the effect of all spiritual
[1:10:30] blessings is not just the feel goods if
[1:10:32] i can put it that way
[1:10:33] if you remember this quote he said just
[1:10:34] heavenly places in christ jesus
[1:10:36] blessing us with what all of these good
[1:10:38] things divine healing for knowledge
[1:10:40] revelation
[1:10:41] visions powers tongues interpretations
[1:10:43] wisdom knowledge
[1:10:44] all the heavenly blessings and joy
[1:10:46] unspeakable and full of glory
[1:10:48] every heart filled with the spirit
[1:10:49] walking together setting together in
[1:10:50] heavenly places
[1:10:51] and the church said amen not one evil
[1:10:55] thought among us
[1:10:57] this is where the rubber meets the road
[1:11:00] amen we take on the mind of christ not
[1:11:02] one cigarette smoked
[1:11:04] not one bad habit full deliverance amen
[1:11:07] full deliverance is what he's talking
[1:11:08] about here that's a
[1:11:09] a wonderful thing until you realize that
[1:11:11] you need deliverance
[1:11:14] not one short dress amen obedience to
[1:11:16] the word is cleansing our beast nature
[1:11:18] so that we don't go looking for approval
[1:11:20] in those ways amen
[1:11:22] a sound mind replaces a tempting spirit
[1:11:24] inside of us
[1:11:25] or this not one this that or the other
[1:11:28] not one evil thought nobody got anything
[1:11:32] against one another
[1:11:33] full unity and fellowship is what he's
[1:11:35] talking here putting aside our offense
[1:11:38] our offenses and our little preferences
[1:11:40] for what the sake of a greater
[1:11:42] unification as a member of the body of
[1:11:44] christ amen
[1:11:46] everybody speaking in love and harmony
[1:11:49] not just shouting and praising but
[1:11:51] speaking good things to each other
[1:11:52] always in love and with the intent to
[1:11:54] grow
[1:11:54] the other person amen
[1:11:57] everybody with one accord in one place
[1:12:00] remember all on the boat to china's
[1:12:01] brother mark says
[1:12:02] one purpose one goal and that is our
[1:12:05] only
[1:12:05] focus and everything of jonathan corlett
[1:12:08] i'll set aside
[1:12:09] to help us get to china a little easier
[1:12:12] amen that's what i'm looking for in my
[1:12:13] life
[1:12:14] set aside my preferences so that we get
[1:12:16] to china
[1:12:17] a little easier and then there's a
[1:12:18] little less friction on the boat there's
[1:12:20] a little more unity a little more
[1:12:21] helping
[1:12:22] and it's a little more pleasant journey
[1:12:23] amen it's going to be tough enough
[1:12:24] without us fighting amongst ourselves
[1:12:27] amen so what we want all the things that
[1:12:30] the first half of that talks about but
[1:12:32] are we willing to go through the
[1:12:33] cleansing that brings the second half
[1:12:35] amen but we submit ourselves in the way
[1:12:37] that says i'm going to put myself below
[1:12:39] and i'm going to serve my fellow brother
[1:12:41] and sister in christ
[1:12:42] so that we can get there just a little
[1:12:44] bit quicker just a little bit easier
[1:12:46] amen
[1:12:48] amen you can't do awands for the word of
[1:12:50] god there's no way it's going to happen
[1:12:51] they'll tear you apart amen
[1:12:53] so we're electing the best of a bad
[1:12:54] bunch amen
[1:12:56] so our election is according to the best
[1:12:58] that we think
[1:12:59] is there amen but god's election is
[1:13:02] according to the best that he thinks
[1:13:05] and if he's thought about you that makes
[1:13:07] you the best
[1:13:09] because god doesn't think of
[1:13:10] imperfection god thinks of perfection he
[1:13:13] requires perfection
[1:13:14] so when he elected you he elected you to
[1:13:16] a perfect walk in christ
[1:13:18] he elected you to walk under the shed
[1:13:19] blood of christ so that you could stand
[1:13:21] before him
[1:13:22] so that he could be reflected in you and
[1:13:24] so that the the things that we go
[1:13:25] through and the
[1:13:26] the ways we fail and our faults and
[1:13:28] whatnot are hidden from him and he can
[1:13:30] look at us and he can see himself
[1:13:31] exactly as he intended us to be
[1:13:33] from the very beginning amen amen this
[1:13:35] kind of election has no
[1:13:37] basis on what you look like what you're
[1:13:40] doing today
[1:13:42] what you're going to do tomorrow amen
[1:13:44] your righteousness or clean living these
[1:13:46] have nothing to do with your election
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:48] he elected you before the foundation of
[1:13:50] the world in him
[1:13:51] and that is where your perfection lies
[1:13:53] amen it's his election that holds us
[1:13:55] it's his election that gives us the
[1:13:56] victory amen because he purposed in
[1:13:58] himself
[1:13:59] that we would be victorious that we
[1:14:00] would be spotless before him amen that
[1:14:02] we would be a perfect white
[1:14:04] white spotless not white you know
[1:14:07] racially
[1:14:08] bride gotta be careful you really have
[1:14:11] to be
[1:14:12] careful amen your mistakes and failures
[1:14:14] will never frustrate the plan of god is
[1:14:15] what i'm getting to
[1:14:16] because sometimes that's what we're
[1:14:17] looking as we're looking we're saying
[1:14:19] how is he going to rapture this
[1:14:21] amen and the thing is he's not looking
[1:14:23] at this that you're looking at
[1:14:24] he's looking at a perfect bride through
[1:14:26] the film through the lens of the shed
[1:14:28] blood of christ amen
[1:14:30] you can't start it and you can't stop it
[1:14:32] amen it's a finished work
[1:14:33] and we're just down in this body of time
[1:14:35] for him to bring it out into each and
[1:14:36] every one of us amen
[1:14:38] let me say it this way you can't make
[1:14:39] god love you more today
[1:14:41] than he did back then and you can't make
[1:14:43] him love you less
[1:14:44] today than he did back then amen god's
[1:14:47] love is not conditional amen it's
[1:14:49] unconditional
[1:14:50] and his love is elective and what he's
[1:14:51] saying is i love you no matter what
[1:14:53] that's what elective love is
[1:14:54] is i love you no matter what can you
[1:14:56] imagine if we had elective love for
[1:14:58] everyone in our family
[1:14:59] everyone in this church elective love
[1:15:01] meaning i love you because you are part
[1:15:03] of the body
[1:15:04] not because you're perfect amen that's
[1:15:06] the kind of love we spoke about in that
[1:15:08] service remember god's love
[1:15:10] god's love looks to the word and the
[1:15:12] person rather than everything that's
[1:15:13] surrounding the word in them
[1:15:15] amen amen
[1:15:20] verse 5
[1:15:23] having predestinated us unto the
[1:15:25] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:15:27] himself
[1:15:28] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:15:31] will amen i want to just
[1:15:32] talk a little bit about election
[1:15:34] predestination here
[1:15:36] brother brown said election looks back
[1:15:38] to foreknowledge
[1:15:40] and predestination looks to destiny
[1:15:44] now where am i at now i'm saved i'm
[1:15:46] walking in the grace of god
[1:15:48] what is where does predestination look
[1:15:50] to destiny
[1:15:51] where he will take me to and where am i
[1:15:53] going amen
[1:15:54] that's got you there you are so it kind
[1:15:56] of looks like this
[1:15:59] so you're standing here because the
[1:16:00] election is is a present view
[1:16:02] of a past event and predestination is a
[1:16:05] present view of a future event if we
[1:16:06] could put it that way
[1:16:07] so you're standing here today and you
[1:16:09] can only stand there and say i was
[1:16:10] elected if you have the holy spirit
[1:16:12] because you have to be elected to the
[1:16:14] life of god amen and that only comes
[1:16:15] through the holy spirit
[1:16:16] so you're standing here and you say okay
[1:16:18] i've received the holy spirit
[1:16:20] that means i was a part of election and
[1:16:23] that looks back to god here by
[1:16:24] foreknowledge you were in the thoughts
[1:16:26] of god
[1:16:27] and he says jonathan collette is a son
[1:16:30] of god
[1:16:31] and so today i say i was elected but it
[1:16:33] points back to something god did back
[1:16:35] here right
[1:16:35] so he or she is a child of god when i
[1:16:37] look at it today i say i am a child of
[1:16:39] god
[1:16:40] amen the word is there here's the
[1:16:42] recognition and reality of that word
[1:16:44] but now i say if i'm elected if i am a
[1:16:46] son of god that means there's something
[1:16:48] coming for me as well
[1:16:50] right this points back to what was what
[1:16:52] brought me to this place but now
[1:16:53] predestination looks forward brother
[1:16:55] brahm says
[1:16:55] and says there's something coming for
[1:16:57] you and there's a destiny there
[1:16:58] and it says what today predestination
[1:17:01] says you are the bride of christ
[1:17:03] amen and when we go on the rapture it
[1:17:05] says i am the bride of christ
[1:17:07] we say it today but the proof is in the
[1:17:09] rapture amen and that's that moment
[1:17:11] where he's pointing to and he's saying
[1:17:12] the word now becomes recognition reality
[1:17:14] you stand today you look back and you
[1:17:16] thank god for it but you look forward
[1:17:17] and say there's still more for me to do
[1:17:19] there's still more
[1:17:20] that god has for my life amen does that
[1:17:23] make sense
[1:17:26] all right so then he starts talking
[1:17:28] about adoption
[1:17:29] i know we know we're well taught we
[1:17:30] should all know this but i'm going to
[1:17:32] just
[1:17:32] read the quotes quickly and we'll breeze
[1:17:34] through it amen we know what adoption is
[1:17:35] today it's when you take a child to
[1:17:37] yourself that isn't yours it didn't come
[1:17:38] from your body
[1:17:39] your you and your wife didn't have it
[1:17:41] you adopt a child that came from
[1:17:42] somebody else
[1:17:43] but adoption back in in old days was
[1:17:45] quite a bit different
[1:17:47] brother brahm says i believe that we're
[1:17:48] all baptized with the holy spirit and
[1:17:50] brought into the body
[1:17:51] and then we become sons and then after
[1:17:54] sons there's a placing of sons or the
[1:17:56] adoption of sons
[1:17:57] a son was born in israel and then after
[1:17:59] eight days he was circumcised and became
[1:18:01] an israelite
[1:18:02] and he was born to the father and then
[1:18:04] if that child was given a tutor
[1:18:05] galatians teaches us that after he was
[1:18:07] raised up to a certain age
[1:18:09] and he become very faithful to the
[1:18:10] father's work and everything he was a
[1:18:12] very fine boy
[1:18:13] and was eligible to fall air so just
[1:18:16] because you were born into the family
[1:18:17] didn't mean that you were going to
[1:18:18] inherit
[1:18:19] everything that that family had he says
[1:18:21] now the father didn't know
[1:18:22] what he would be when he was born he
[1:18:24] might be a gangster he might be
[1:18:26] slothful in the father's business he
[1:18:29] couldn't turn his kingdom and his things
[1:18:30] his work over to that boy
[1:18:32] but when the boy proved to be a right
[1:18:33] boy and the tutor which in our case is
[1:18:35] the holy spirit
[1:18:37] takes word to the father and gives a
[1:18:38] report of what we do then if we be found
[1:18:41] faithful for so long like the child was
[1:18:43] then he was taken out into the public
[1:18:45] square and a purple robe was put on him
[1:18:48] and there was a law
[1:18:49] of adoption and then that boy was
[1:18:51] adopted by the same father who gave him
[1:18:54] birth and he was brought into the family
[1:18:57] and then he wasn't only a son he was
[1:19:00] heir
[1:19:00] co-heir with the father of every
[1:19:03] possession that he had amen
[1:19:05] so adoption was the placing the child on
[1:19:07] a footing
[1:19:08] of authority within the family including
[1:19:10] the ability to inherit when the father
[1:19:12] died amen
[1:19:14] and brother braham says now your coheir
[1:19:16] with christ amen the scripture says that
[1:19:18] that we are coheirs with christ if what
[1:19:20] we've received the same spirit that was
[1:19:21] in him
[1:19:22] we've received the benefits of his his
[1:19:24] sacrifice at calvary
[1:19:25] and then he says the holy spirit's there
[1:19:27] and he's working with you and it goes to
[1:19:29] the father
[1:19:29] and says yes he acts like you he talks
[1:19:31] like you
[1:19:32] and then you're sealed and then it's a
[1:19:34] finished work and your soul is sealed
[1:19:35] all the way to the end amen
[1:19:37] we saw it with jesus you say that was
[1:19:40] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:19:43] yep but he still went through the
[1:19:45] process remember when he comes to john
[1:19:47] and he's about to be baptized
[1:19:48] and the spirit said to john whichever
[1:19:50] one you see the spirit descending on
[1:19:51] that is
[1:19:52] the messiah so the holy spirit comes
[1:19:54] down and says this is my beloved son
[1:19:57] but then we see a little while later
[1:19:59] when jesus goes up on the mountain after
[1:20:01] he's been tested and proven and whatnot
[1:20:03] then the great light comes down remember
[1:20:05] and it says this is my beloved son in
[1:20:07] whom i am well pleased
[1:20:09] hear ye him so he gives the idea that
[1:20:12] he a he's done what the father's asked
[1:20:15] he's pleased with him
[1:20:16] the report has been good and then he
[1:20:18] follows it up and he says hear
[1:20:19] ye him and from then on it's only jesus
[1:20:21] speaking we never hear that voice come
[1:20:23] out of heaven again
[1:20:24] why because all power has been given
[1:20:26] into his hands amen
[1:20:28] right now he's got to go through the
[1:20:29] cross in these different things he
[1:20:30] doesn't receive his kingdom until later
[1:20:31] but that was jesus
[1:20:32] adoption moment brother brahm says we're
[1:20:35] after that point now he speaks and
[1:20:36] whatever he speaks will happen
[1:20:38] he's got the full authority of heaven
[1:20:40] backing him up now before that
[1:20:42] he had to do whatever the father showed
[1:20:44] him in that sense but here he had the
[1:20:45] authority
[1:20:46] to step out if he needed to and do
[1:20:48] whatever he had to amen
[1:20:50] romans 8 how do you get adopted brother
[1:20:52] brown says this over and over again
[1:20:55] how do you get adopted how do you get
[1:20:56] brought into the family the spirit
[1:20:58] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[1:21:00] that we are the children of god
[1:21:03] okay and then he says and if children so
[1:21:05] you have to have the spirit the holy
[1:21:07] spirit bearing witness within you to be
[1:21:08] recognized as a child of god
[1:21:10] and then if we're children then heirs
[1:21:13] heirs of god
[1:21:14] and joint heirs with christ if so be
[1:21:16] that we suffer with him that we also may
[1:21:18] be glorified together
[1:21:20] now remember he told joshua be thou
[1:21:22] strong and courageous
[1:21:23] no man is going to be able to stand
[1:21:25] right there was the promise battles are
[1:21:26] coming
[1:21:27] he says here battles are coming you've
[1:21:29] got to suffer you've got to go through
[1:21:30] the battles amen
[1:21:32] why so that we can be glorified together
[1:21:34] suffering is a part of that adoption
[1:21:36] process amen
[1:21:37] struggles trials challenges are the
[1:21:39] proving portion that we are
[1:21:41] what he said we would be amen
[1:21:44] jumping back to ephesians 1 and 6 says
[1:21:46] to the praise
[1:21:47] of the glory of his grace wherein he had
[1:21:49] made us accepted
[1:21:51] in the beloved amen it's all when it's
[1:21:54] all the grace of god how can we claim
[1:21:55] any part of this to be ourselves
[1:21:57] amen how can we lift ourselves up and
[1:21:59] say i'm this or i'm that or i've got
[1:22:00] this or i've done that
[1:22:01] and then it's all god from start to
[1:22:03] finish
[1:22:05] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:22:07] blood the forgiveness of sins
[1:22:09] according to the riches of his grace
[1:22:11] what is redemption it's the restoring
[1:22:13] back
[1:22:14] that which was lost or forfeited so what
[1:22:16] are we being redeemed back to
[1:22:19] our position as children of god brother
[1:22:21] brahm says
[1:22:22] amateur gods many messiahs even he said
[1:22:25] at different times amen
[1:22:26] our position as the children of god with
[1:22:28] fellowship eternal life and dominion on
[1:22:30] the earth amen how
[1:22:32] nothing i did says thereby what through
[1:22:34] his blood the forgiveness of sins
[1:22:36] according to the riches of his grace
[1:22:39] verse 8 says wherein he had abounded
[1:22:41] toward us in all wisdom and prudence
[1:22:43] that abounded doesn't mean it's just
[1:22:45] dribbling out a little bit from the
[1:22:46] faucet
[1:22:48] amen that's the fire hose has been
[1:22:49] turned on and he is firing this at us
[1:22:53] amen if we lack something it's not
[1:22:55] because god's unwilling to give it
[1:22:56] or that god doesn't have it it's that
[1:22:58] we're not willing to take it
[1:23:00] amen because it says he's bounded
[1:23:01] towards it towards us with it there's
[1:23:03] lots of it there's abundance of it
[1:23:06] in what all wisdom and prudence amen if
[1:23:08] you need direction
[1:23:09] it's there you need wisdom you need
[1:23:12] discretion
[1:23:13] you need discernment this is what this
[1:23:14] is all talking about here it's all
[1:23:16] available to the children of god amen
[1:23:17] and these are the riches of his grace
[1:23:19] amen
[1:23:20] amen verse 9 says having made known unto
[1:23:23] us the mystery of his will
[1:23:25] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:23:27] hath purposed in himself
[1:23:29] amen so the mystery of his will is
[1:23:30] something that he decided not we decided
[1:23:33] because it's his will not our will right
[1:23:37] what was the mystery of god to joshua
[1:23:40] it was the fulfilling of the promise but
[1:23:42] it included two things right the
[1:23:43] boundaries of the promised land
[1:23:45] that was one mystery and the second was
[1:23:47] who went where
[1:23:48] the positional placing of the israelites
[1:23:50] within that land amen
[1:23:52] so what's the mystery of his will today
[1:23:54] you'd think it'd be the same thing right
[1:23:57] it is in a sense that it's to be the
[1:23:59] fulfilling of the promise romans 8 we
[1:24:01] started reading this but i'm going to
[1:24:03] go back a little bit it says for as many
[1:24:04] are led by the spirit of god
[1:24:06] they are the sons of god there's our
[1:24:08] identification you want to know if
[1:24:09] you're a son or daughter of god
[1:24:11] how are you led do you have the spirit
[1:24:13] and do you obey the spirit
[1:24:15] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:24:17] bondage again to fear
[1:24:18] there's another identification are you
[1:24:20] fearful
[1:24:22] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:24:23] adoption whereby
[1:24:25] we cry abba father amen as we read
[1:24:28] earlier be strong and courageous don't
[1:24:29] be afraid and don't be dismayed
[1:24:31] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:24:33] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:24:35] god
[1:24:36] what's it doing it's confirming that we
[1:24:38] act we speak and we think like christ
[1:24:40] did
[1:24:42] and if we are children this is what we
[1:24:43] just read then heirs heirs of god and
[1:24:45] joint heirs with christ
[1:24:46] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:24:49] may also be glorified together
[1:24:51] but i reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:24:52] present time are not worthy to be
[1:24:54] compared with the glory
[1:24:55] which shall be revealed in us for the
[1:24:58] earnest
[1:24:58] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:25:01] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:25:04] remember we're talking what is the
[1:25:05] mystery of god for today
[1:25:07] but brahm said this he says is that
[1:25:10] right
[1:25:10] waiting god's trying to place his church
[1:25:13] in position
[1:25:14] what for to manifest
[1:25:17] himself getting one
[1:25:20] that he can work through like this and
[1:25:22] say there's my spirit flowing three
[1:25:25] freely there it is that i can work here
[1:25:28] get another one over here and place him
[1:25:30] i can place him
[1:25:31] adoption placing manifesting take him
[1:25:34] out here
[1:25:34] put a ceremony on him visit him with an
[1:25:37] angel tell him something
[1:25:39] now if he's told the truth if he's just
[1:25:40] making up something it won't work
[1:25:42] no no that won't work we've had a lot of
[1:25:44] that
[1:25:46] but i mean manifestation of sons of god
[1:25:49] when god manifests himself and he sends
[1:25:52] him out
[1:25:53] manifestation does not lead to sitting
[1:25:54] around doing nothing
[1:25:58] preacher said recently joshua would only
[1:26:00] get into trouble if he was idle
[1:26:03] because the command was not idleness it
[1:26:04] was go and possess the land amen
[1:26:07] so when god manifests himself it's going
[1:26:08] to lead to action it's going to lead to
[1:26:10] a life lived it's going to lead to
[1:26:12] deliverance it's going to lead to
[1:26:13] healing
[1:26:13] it's going to lead to the the moving and
[1:26:15] the working of god in a person amen
[1:26:17] and then he goes and what he says is
[1:26:19] truth
[1:26:20] what he does is the truth what he does
[1:26:23] he manifests christ
[1:26:24] how you judge him by the way he stays
[1:26:26] with the word right with the word
[1:26:28] remember we were talking about
[1:26:29] leadership last time and god uses the
[1:26:30] leadership of men
[1:26:32] through the holy spirit amen how do you
[1:26:34] know that they're leading you
[1:26:35] properly how do you know if it's the
[1:26:37] holy spirit they stay right with the
[1:26:38] word
[1:26:39] see that's how you know all man is by
[1:26:41] the way he stays with the word
[1:26:43] if they speak not according to the word
[1:26:45] there's no life in them says the bible
[1:26:46] see leave them away so brother i'm
[1:26:49] saying the mystery of the will of god
[1:26:51] today is the full
[1:26:52] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:26:56] revelation 10 7 very familiar scripture
[1:26:58] this is our scripture
[1:27:00] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:27:01] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:27:03] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:27:05] finished
[1:27:06] as he had declared to his servants the
[1:27:07] prophet the prophets
[1:27:09] amen why do we believe this message
[1:27:13] why do we believe this one why not oral
[1:27:15] roberts why not billy graham why not
[1:27:17] a slew of others that are out there we
[1:27:20] had signs and wonders and it was
[1:27:21] vindicated by signs and wonders and we
[1:27:22] looked at that as a vindication of it
[1:27:24] amen
[1:27:26] but what was it it was it's the only
[1:27:28] message
[1:27:29] out there it's the only it's the only
[1:27:33] thought
[1:27:33] it's the only idea that is pulling us to
[1:27:36] the finished work of god
[1:27:38] you won't find it anywhere else where
[1:27:39] somebody is pointing to a finished work
[1:27:41] of god
[1:27:42] in children of god on the earth right
[1:27:44] now and saying now is the time
[1:27:46] and here's the proof of it because
[1:27:48] that's what the message was was it was
[1:27:50] proof of a living god
[1:27:51] in a way that has never been shown since
[1:27:54] christ was here 2000 years ago
[1:27:56] is that we saw christ on display and the
[1:27:58] whole
[1:27:59] world marveled the whole world marveled
[1:28:02] and they couldn't believe what was
[1:28:03] happening in this man called william
[1:28:05] branham
[1:28:05] and what was it it was christ himself
[1:28:07] revealing through
[1:28:09] a son of man ministry that he is alive
[1:28:11] and well and he's coming back and he's
[1:28:13] come back
[1:28:14] for a purpose and that's to take a bride
[1:28:16] off of this earth
[1:28:17] nobody else is out there preaching it
[1:28:19] like that nobody
[1:28:21] not only preaching it but showing the
[1:28:23] proof of it
[1:28:25] that's what we saw was we saw the
[1:28:26] preaching of it and we saw the proof of
[1:28:28] it displayed time
[1:28:29] and time again in front of thousands and
[1:28:31] hundreds of thousands and millions
[1:28:33] of people saw christ displayed through a
[1:28:35] man and what was it
[1:28:37] it was a man that was saying you're
[1:28:38] called to this exact same position
[1:28:40] not as a prophet not as a minister but
[1:28:43] you are called to the adoption of a son
[1:28:46] of god and this is what an adopted son
[1:28:48] of god looks like when he's finished
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:50] that's what we are called to amen it's
[1:28:52] to tell us that we are called to the
[1:28:54] exact same position
[1:28:55] and placing that he was in amen this is
[1:28:58] talking about what
[1:28:59] a lived experience where you and christ
[1:29:01] are one
[1:29:02] that's why we believe this message it's
[1:29:04] not all the signs and wonders
[1:29:05] there's signs and wonders everywhere and
[1:29:07] you can find him because god is
[1:29:09] he's what he respects faith brother
[1:29:10] branham said right
[1:29:12] you're going to find signs and wonders
[1:29:13] everywhere but where will you see
[1:29:14] somebody that's pointing to the
[1:29:15] scripture and saying
[1:29:16] this is you this is you this is you
[1:29:20] this is you and then he makes it live
[1:29:21] right in front of you amen
[1:29:24] what is it it was the finishing work
[1:29:25] this message is the finishing work of
[1:29:28] god
[1:29:28] for the gentile dispensation amen that's
[1:29:31] why we preach out of a bible
[1:29:33] not out of a message book is because
[1:29:34] it's a restoring work
[1:29:36] it's not a new work right that's why
[1:29:39] brother brahm says you've got to have
[1:29:40] the same experience they had on the day
[1:29:41] of pentecost he didn't tell us we had
[1:29:42] some new experience some new ideas
[1:29:44] he said i preached what paul preached he
[1:29:46] pulled us back to the word he
[1:29:47] straightened out
[1:29:48] he untied all the knots that they had
[1:29:50] tied in it right
[1:29:51] tied up the loose ends that needed to be
[1:29:53] tied up and he brought us back to a
[1:29:54] restored word the fullness of the word
[1:29:56] because that's the only way we can get
[1:29:57] out of here
[1:29:58] is if we will accept the fullness of the
[1:29:59] word again amen
[1:30:03] let's talk about this amen he says what
[1:30:07] he said he was doing it according to his
[1:30:09] good pleasure amen
[1:30:10] in ephesians philippians 2 says
[1:30:12] wherefore my beloved
[1:30:13] as ye have always obeyed not as in my
[1:30:16] presence only but now much more in my
[1:30:18] absence work out your own salvation
[1:30:20] with fear and trembling for it is god
[1:30:23] which worketh in you both to will and to
[1:30:25] do of his good pleasure
[1:30:26] what he's saying there is it is god has
[1:30:27] put a desire in you to do his will
[1:30:30] and then he's put in you the ability to
[1:30:32] do his will
[1:30:33] right lots of people have a they look at
[1:30:36] it and say
[1:30:36] yeah okay that looks good but they don't
[1:30:39] have the life to do it
[1:30:40] amen people can look at it because you
[1:30:42] know if you've got
[1:30:44] even a semi spiritual mind you look at
[1:30:45] the word and you see the good things
[1:30:46] that are in there and you say yeah
[1:30:48] i'll do that for that but you've got to
[1:30:49] have a life to do it because remember
[1:30:51] what brother brahm said you've got a
[1:30:52] demand of god because
[1:30:53] he is requiring supernatural things out
[1:30:56] of you
[1:30:57] right not natural things supernatural
[1:30:59] things amen
[1:31:02] do all things without murmurings and
[1:31:03] disputings
[1:31:05] no grumbling when god asks you to do
[1:31:06] something
[1:31:08] ouch no grumblings
[1:31:11] no grumblings no grumblings
[1:31:15] anybody done any grumbling lately
[1:31:18] i saw a few honest hands go up a couple
[1:31:21] eyes that wouldn't meet mine
[1:31:24] it's tough isn't it yeah humbling of a
[1:31:27] vessel
[1:31:29] is not something we generally enjoy amen
[1:31:32] but he's going to build you back up into
[1:31:33] something that'll stand forever amen
[1:31:36] verse 15 says what do all of it without
[1:31:38] grumblings
[1:31:39] that ye may be blameless and harmless
[1:31:42] the sons of god without rebuke
[1:31:44] in the midst of a crooked and perverse
[1:31:46] nation among whom
[1:31:48] ye shine as lights in the world
[1:31:51] so as good pleasure as what that you may
[1:31:53] be blameless and harmless the sons of
[1:31:55] god
[1:31:55] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:31:57] and perverse nation
[1:31:58] among whom you shine as lights in the
[1:32:00] world if we can see the crooked and
[1:32:02] perverse nation we ought to be able to
[1:32:03] see
[1:32:04] the lights in the world as well amen 2
[1:32:07] thessalonians 1 says
[1:32:10] when he shall come to be glorified in
[1:32:12] his saints
[1:32:13] and to be admired and all them that
[1:32:15] believe because our testimony among you
[1:32:17] was believed in that day
[1:32:19] wherefore also we pray always for you
[1:32:21] that our god would count you worthy of
[1:32:23] this calling
[1:32:24] and fulfill all the good pleasures of
[1:32:27] his goodness
[1:32:28] and the work of faith with power
[1:32:32] that the name of our lord jesus christ
[1:32:34] may be glorified in you
[1:32:36] and ye in him according to the grace of
[1:32:38] our god in the lord jesus christ
[1:32:40] you can't take on the name of somebody
[1:32:41] unless you're married to them
[1:32:43] and this is the bride of christ he says
[1:32:45] what do it with the work
[1:32:47] of faith with power the good pleasure of
[1:32:50] his goodness
[1:32:51] and the work of faith with power power
[1:32:53] him and that's the manifestation
[1:32:55] of the sons of god that's the full
[1:32:56] revealing of christ in his bride that's
[1:32:58] the victorious church amen
[1:33:01] even if we jump back to ephesians 1
[1:33:03] verse 9 it says this
[1:33:05] so remember we're talking about what is
[1:33:06] the mystery of his will it says having
[1:33:08] made
[1:33:08] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:33:10] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:33:12] had purposed in himself
[1:33:13] what's the effect of the revealing of
[1:33:15] his of his of the mystery of his will
[1:33:17] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:33:19] of times he might gather together in one
[1:33:22] all things in christ both which are in
[1:33:23] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:33:25] him
[1:33:26] so as he makes known unto us the mystery
[1:33:27] of his will what's the effect
[1:33:29] the gathering of the children of god to
[1:33:31] christ by a resurrection and a rapture
[1:33:33] so the mystery of his will has to come
[1:33:35] before that because the effect of the
[1:33:37] mystery of his will
[1:33:38] is the resurrection and the rapture so
[1:33:40] what comes before that
[1:33:41] manifestation of the sons of god it's
[1:33:43] amazing how brother brahm jumps to this
[1:33:45] stuff
[1:33:46] i mean i would never make that
[1:33:47] connection i just read it and it's just
[1:33:50] wow right that's what a prophetic
[1:33:52] message does for you is he makes those
[1:33:53] leaps and jumps
[1:33:55] but it said leaping a jump only until
[1:33:56] you start looking in the scripture and
[1:33:57] you just see it
[1:33:58] it's laid through all the way from start
[1:33:59] to finish and you're like that that's
[1:34:02] why i can trust him
[1:34:03] but it's also why we preach out of the
[1:34:04] bible as we ought to be able to go back
[1:34:06] and say
[1:34:06] that wasn't a leap at all it was only a
[1:34:08] leap because i don't have an angel
[1:34:10] sitting there telling me these things
[1:34:12] right i've got to go study to show
[1:34:13] myself for proof and guess what i
[1:34:15] guarantee you he did too
[1:34:16] brother brown was a great study of the
[1:34:17] word he didn't just get up there and
[1:34:19] speak words you know
[1:34:20] he was a he studied into it and he dug
[1:34:23] into it and these things would only be
[1:34:24] confirmed
[1:34:25] god would confirm it amen amen the
[1:34:28] mystery of his will isn't just a basic
[1:34:30] walk with god going to church going out
[1:34:31] doing missionary work and these things
[1:34:33] because that's always been there
[1:34:34] and that's not what's going to bring us
[1:34:35] to the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:34:36] times
[1:34:37] right that's a basic requirement for
[1:34:39] walking amen but the mystery of his will
[1:34:41] in this case is what bringing us to that
[1:34:44] last time it's in the last time that the
[1:34:45] full mystery is revealed amen
[1:34:47] the amplified says that that
[1:34:49] dispensation of the fullness of times is
[1:34:50] the climax of the ages that's the last
[1:34:52] church agent
[1:34:53] that's now right he says now is when the
[1:34:55] mystery of his will is going to be
[1:34:57] shown and it's going to be what in a
[1:34:59] church and a bride
[1:35:00] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:35:02] inheritance being predestinated
[1:35:04] according to the purpose of him who
[1:35:06] worketh all things
[1:35:07] after the council of his own will that
[1:35:10] we should be
[1:35:11] to the praise of his glory are first
[1:35:14] trusted in christ when you start hearing
[1:35:15] people that are being praised
[1:35:17] look out there's a fall coming amen
[1:35:20] these men and these women we have to
[1:35:22] stay humble they have to stay humble
[1:35:24] because god will break them down he's
[1:35:25] got to him and he won't let anybody take
[1:35:27] the credit for this one this is his work
[1:35:29] amen and when you see that humility
[1:35:31] coming forward that's what you're
[1:35:32] looking for in these ones amen
[1:35:34] amen but he says what we're
[1:35:36] predestinated to what an
[1:35:38] inheritance by the purpose of god that's
[1:35:40] why we don't play the lottery
[1:35:41] we already won the lottery right what
[1:35:44] what more do you need
[1:35:45] right you you won from the foundation of
[1:35:47] the world and it's a guaranteed prize
[1:35:50] that's not going to fade away amen

[1:35:54] probably be a great sermon sometime
[1:35:57] lottery winners in the message
[1:36:00] amen continuing in ephesians as we start
[1:36:02] to close here it says in whom also
[1:36:03] ye in whom ye also trusted after that ye
[1:36:06] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[1:36:08] your salvation
[1:36:09] in whom also after ye believed after you
[1:36:12] believed
[1:36:12] ye were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:36:14] promise which is the earnest of our
[1:36:16] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:36:18] purchased possession
[1:36:19] unto the praise of his glory again this
[1:36:21] is for his glory not for ours
[1:36:23] wherefore i also after i heard of your
[1:36:25] faith in the lord jesus and love unto

[1:36:30] mention of you

[1:37:01] saints amen not just a thought not just
[1:37:03] an idea
[1:37:03] not just a maybe so but a must be right
[1:37:06] a definite
[1:37:07] something that i have not just something
[1:37:09] i'm looking for and what is the
[1:37:11] exceeding greatness of his power to us
[1:37:14] word who believe
[1:37:15] according to the working of his mighty
[1:37:17] power
[1:37:18] which he wrought in christ in when he
[1:37:21] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:37:23] his own right hand in the heavenly
[1:37:24] places
[1:37:25] it says he's given us the spirit of
[1:37:26] wisdom and revelation so that we can see
[1:37:28] and receive the riches of his
[1:37:29] inheritance
[1:37:30] but not only that but the exceeding
[1:37:32] greatness of his power that's the
[1:37:34] greater than great
[1:37:36] greater than great amen the greater than
[1:37:39] greatness of his power
[1:37:41] what the same thing that raised christ
[1:37:43] from the dead is the thing that's
[1:37:44] raising us
[1:37:45] up into heavenly places and giving us
[1:37:47] the position to inherit all things amen
[1:37:51] 21 says far above all principality this
[1:37:54] is where he's placed us now this is
[1:37:55] heavenly places
[1:37:57] far above all principality and power
[1:38:00] and might and dominion and every name
[1:38:03] that is named not only in this world
[1:38:05] but also in that which is to come and
[1:38:07] hath put
[1:38:08] all things under his feet which gave him
[1:38:10] to be the head over all things to the
[1:38:12] church
[1:38:13] which is his body the fullness of him
[1:38:16] that filleth all in all again brother
[1:38:19] braham says
[1:38:19] that is the mystery of his will that's
[1:38:21] the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:38:23] his body the fullness of him that's what
[1:38:26] we're talking about amen
[1:38:28] look at our position in christ where he
[1:38:30] says everything
[1:38:31] is under his feet all principalities
[1:38:35] all powers all might all dominions and
[1:38:38] all names past present
[1:38:39] and future it says they're under his
[1:38:42] feet
[1:38:42] but then he says you are his body so it
[1:38:45] puts him under your feet
[1:38:46] but doesn't just say under your feet you
[1:38:48] know
[1:38:49] not like this i'm not going to stand on
[1:38:52] it
[1:38:53] that's not what he's talking about he

[1:39:14] every principality every dominion and
[1:39:16] every name that is not named jesus
[1:39:18] christ
[1:39:19] because it is far below our feet amen
[1:39:23] amen everything's conquered everything's
