[37:31] it
[37:32] but let's let's judge ourselves by the
[37:34] word and the power of god did say
[37:36] the pulpit right here he says the
[37:38] judgment seat of god

[38:05] but we could go on until tonight but
[38:08] we'll try it by the grace of god just to
[38:10] keep it the way that he wants it and
[38:12] these are the ones that
[38:14] i wanted to emphasize this one here is
[38:16] perfect faith
[38:17] and this one heirs works his faith
[38:19] expressed
[38:20] amen and again the rapture
[38:24] amen message god give us i pray
[38:27] the perfect revelation of the rapture
[38:30] faith is not a feeling no no faith is
[38:33] is the revelation of god and you believe
[38:36] the revelation of god
[38:38] so i pray grace that will amen make our
[38:40] calling election sure
[38:42] by the word on the message on perfect
[38:45] faith we've heard it but let's hear it
[38:46] again
[38:47] and let's judge ourselves by that word
[38:49] again and let's see it lord oh yeah i
[38:51] believe now i got more faith
[38:53] yes lord my getting i'm getting into
[38:55] that perfect faith
[38:57] amen because if you read the book or if
[38:59] you hear the tape
[39:00] well that's good but go back and do it
[39:02] again and again and again
[39:03] because we need it to make our calling
[39:06] election sure
[39:07] to make sure that we have what god is
[39:10] looking for
[39:11] and what you and i need because without
[39:14] this perfect fate
[39:15] and especially concerning the
[39:16] resurrection rapture we won't make it
[39:19] and brother because it's all it's going
[39:20] to be by faith and you consider the
[39:22] chapter in the bible
[39:24] the faith chapter hebrews 11 by faith by
[39:27] faith it goes on and on and on
[39:29] and on amen regardless of the individual
[39:32] regardless of the age
[39:34] the thing that god was looking for was
[39:36] faith
[39:37] was the revelation of what he had
[39:39] revealed to them
[39:41] amen that's the perfect faith in what
[39:43] god
[39:44] has revealed to you in your day in your
[39:47] hour
[39:47] that's oh if i believe that and i'm
[39:49] going forth lining up with it
[39:51] that's perfect faith so you come right
[39:53] on down to the to the bright message
[39:55] amen concerning the rapture concerning
[39:57] the resurrection
[39:58] amen oh lord we got the revelation of it
[40:01] we're in we're in that hour now
[40:02] but that's that's the perfect faith that
[40:05] god is looking for us to stand on
[40:07] amen to express in what we in in the
[40:10] lives that we live
[40:11] as luther expressed perfect faith for
[40:14] that age
[40:15] amen that's what god wanted to have amen
[40:18] and he got into it and brother in the
[40:20] eyes of god is perfect faith
[40:22] luther wesley the pentecostals but now
[40:24] we're in the bright age
[40:26] and maybe sometime soon that we'll
[40:29] consider
[40:30] you know uh what went on with luther and
[40:33] wesley and all the others in the
[40:34] pentecost
[40:35] and but there was a change everything
[40:38] changed
[40:39] and and the revival just died down
[40:42] the revival that luther had went down
[40:45] the revive of that pen
[40:46] that even pentecost had it just went
[40:48] down
[40:49] yeah so what happened the truth was
[40:51] still there
[40:52] but their zeal and their enthusiasm
[40:54] wasn't there and now it's the same with
[40:56] the message
[40:56] now i said lord i said help us to
[40:58] compare what's going on now around the
[41:00] message
[41:01] you know with what happened in luther's
[41:03] day wesley's day and so on
[41:05] so we know that that it began to go
[41:07] downhill
[41:08] the people were going downhill
[41:09] spiritually more and more and more
[41:12] and so i'm recognizing what happened in
[41:14] all other ages
[41:15] i'm recognizing that it's happening
[41:17] around the message
[41:18] because that zeal and that enthusiasm is
[41:21] not there
[41:22] like it used to be oh yeah we thank the
[41:24] lord for it praise the lord
[41:26] yeah but if if it's faith in our hearts
[41:29] we have a zeal we have an enthusiasm we
[41:32] have a love
[41:33] oh we have the power the anointing and
[41:35] we just can't get
[41:36] the the true bride can't get away from
[41:38] it the true
[41:40] bride is hungering thirsting amen
[41:43] because like like like the pentecostals
[41:45] oh my they kept going looking for the
[41:47] baptism the baptism and the gift the
[41:49] baptism and the gift
[41:50] the power and the anointing to finally
[41:52] it just become a creed and a doctrine
[41:54] and oh i believe it yeah you've got to
[41:56] believe it go go and manifest it
[41:59] you know luther manifested justification
[42:02] the sanctification the baptism that
[42:04] gives
[42:04] well what's god looking for in you amen
[42:08] brother that's right
[42:09] what's god looking for in me is he is he
[42:10] seeing is he seeing it in you and in me
[42:13] and brother the thing of it is oh we
[42:16] can't blame god and say oh lord you
[42:17] didn't give us the faith he did
[42:20] he did give us the faith by the grace of
[42:22] god
[42:23] amen but again is the faith controlling
[42:27] us
[42:27] or are we true are we trying to control
[42:29] the faith amen
[42:31] oh brother yeah so i'll tell you this to
[42:33] say that what happened to the same
[42:34] spirit they got around the
[42:36] methodists and the lutherans and the
[42:38] pentecostals any denomination and
[42:40] it's all a form of godliness oh yeah
[42:43] they still believed in the gifts they
[42:44] believed in the baptism they believed
[42:46] this
[42:46] oh yeah but the zeal and the enthusiasm
[42:49] wasn't there
[42:50] and it's not definitely not there now
[42:52] and i know that the zeal and the
[42:54] enthusiasm
[42:55] that was around this message when i
[42:56] first come to the message it's not there
[42:58] now
[42:58] yeah and brother brown was experiencing
[43:00] that
[43:02] before the lord took him home well he
[43:04] knew it even even even
[43:06] he felt that this it wasn't striking
[43:08] believers the way that it should he said
[43:10] was striking him the way that it should
[43:12] but again there's a generation rising
[43:14] that it should strike us
[43:15] and it should control us it not sure it
[43:17] will
[43:18] if we really believe it in our hearts it
[43:20] will control us
[43:22] by the grace of god and that we're going
[43:24] to live live
[43:25] live for the revelation we're living for
[43:28] that faith
[43:29] amen but there's too many believers oh
[43:32] that
[43:33] it's just going to church denominations
[43:35] i go to church
[43:36] they preach the message yeah but do you
[43:38] believe the message
[43:40] as we go into this tape on perfect faith
[43:42] and we've heard it before
[43:45] judge yourself by it amen let us see
[43:48] lord i want that perfect faith or lord i
[43:51] believe i've got it i believe i'm on my
[43:53] way lord i'm i'm feeding on the word
[43:54] that's giving me more and more perfect
[43:56] faith
[43:57] and lord i i'm i'm gonna make by calling
[44:00] election sure
[44:01] based on that perfect faith amen
[44:04] oh yeah based on what god has done and
[44:07] what god is doing
[44:08] and what god will do amen so where are
[44:10] we in the spirit
[44:12] of what god has done and what god is
[44:15] doing
[44:15] by the grace of god and we know that
[44:18] we're in a bride revival
[44:20] and the prophet of god did say he said
[44:22] no he said the bride revival is not
[44:23] going to
[44:24] seem like a revival right because it's
[44:27] not looking down here it's looking up
[44:29] amen for the resurrection and the
[44:32] rapture
[44:33] by the grace of god amen and your lives
[44:35] are going to reflect that
[44:37] i'm not getting too involved with in
[44:39] this when i'm not getting too involved
[44:40] in that
[44:41] i'm just living for the lord i'm living
[44:43] for the resurrection i'm living with the
[44:44] rapture
[44:45] lord because that's the only thing left
[44:47] to happen now for the gentile
[44:49] amazing this is absolutely amazing that
[44:51] we
[44:52] we we know that we are in that hour in
[44:54] that age
[44:55] amen when god has made his last move
[44:58] to give us the faith that we need for
[45:00] the resurrection rapture
[45:02] come home amen and brother as i said
[45:04] there in luke
[45:05] where he said go and ask this one ask
[45:08] that one ask that one
[45:09] to come to the marriage supper oh oh
[45:12] they couldn't they couldn't go to the
[45:13] marriage number because they were doing
[45:14] this
[45:15] they couldn't get get too involved with
[45:16] that because they were doing this and so
[45:18] on
[45:19] so finally jesus said go out into the
[45:20] highways and byways amen
[45:22] and he said call them in oh yeah they
[45:25] were they were more than ready
[45:26] more than willing a man and a great a
[45:29] greater willingness than
[45:31] hunger and thirst for it and to want to
[45:33] do it when they considered
[45:35] oh my the king of kings and lord of
[45:37] lords coming down to the
[45:39] to the to the marriage supper of his son
[45:41] our lord jesus christ
[45:43] amen brother getting out of the feelings
[45:45] they had into the faith
[45:47] amen based on the revelation of the
[45:50] marriage supper
[45:51] based on the revelation of the
[45:52] bridegroom and the bride
[45:54] oh it's going to be wonderful praise the
[45:56] lord so i pray god help us
[45:58] to judge ourselves again by the word
[46:00] that we're going to hear again
[46:02] and no doubt you might have read it and
[46:04] you may have heard the tape a few times
[46:06] well let's hear it again amen and we're
[46:09] not going to add to it not take away
[46:10] from it
[46:11] see it's the same thing again it's it's
[46:13] the word
[46:14] revealed praise the lord amen by god by
[46:17] the grace of god
[46:18] and it doesn't change he's not going to
[46:20] change it it's so it's predestinated
[46:23] it's it's ordained for this hour for
[46:25] this age because
[46:26] we need it but
[46:31] it's not mentioned it concerning other
[46:32] agents but this one
[46:35] will the lord have a problem
[46:39] amen in dealing with the people
[46:42] with perfect faith why because he said
[46:45] when the son of man comes
[46:47] will he find faith and the faith he's
[46:50] looking for
[46:51] is not just i believe god or i believe
[46:53] in god
[46:55] the faith he's looking for is those that
[46:57] believe in the whole body
[46:59] of revealed truth amen and if you do
[47:03] you know where you are amen that you're
[47:05] not in the alpha
[47:06] you're in the omega you're not in the in
[47:08] luther wesley and pentecost no
[47:10] we're going on now it's the final the
[47:13] final phase
[47:15] amen there's god's not going to do
[47:17] anything else for the gentiles
[47:19] amen so i pray grace to make our calling
[47:22] election sure
[47:23] that amen in the presence of god now
[47:27] amen so i'll tell you what we call for
[47:31] what what is the elect for oh lord
[47:34] that's right
[47:35] it's the resurrection it's the rapture
[47:37] at the time
[47:38] we're not going to condemn those out
[47:39] there in in those churches no it's like
[47:41] i said they're the called
[47:43] but they're not the chosen for the bride
[47:44] but they're going to be there outside
[47:46] the city
[47:46] and i'll tell you this the bride's not
[47:48] going to just be in the earth and the
[47:50] people think the bride's gonna be you
[47:51] know we sit with them any strong
[47:53] they're gonna be in in in that part of
[47:55] the the the kingdom
[47:57] oh yeah and then do you think that's
[47:58] gonna be bright outside the throne
[48:00] no that's why the problem oh i like it
[48:03] that's why the prophet said
[48:04] he said we can't get this we're not
[48:06] going to get this message to everybody
[48:08] only the bride that's right but he said
[48:11] that again the gospel is going out there
[48:13] concerning the basic revelation of jesus
[48:16] and it's going to go to all
[48:17] the earth everywhere amen all right
[48:20] that's going to bring forth the many
[48:21] that are called
[48:23] amen but and god and god looks for a
[48:26] certain faith in them
[48:28] but brother the faith he's looking for
[48:29] in them is not the faith he's looking
[48:30] for in you
[48:32] and me so god's grace to us let us
[48:35] be judge or judge ourselves again let
[48:37] god judge us by the word
[48:39] concerning perfect faith amen
[48:42] and again the power of god preached this
[48:43] after the opening of the seals
[48:47] in august of 1963 by the
[48:50] grace of god and we're going to we go
[48:52] into it
[48:54] we just want to go into page start at
[48:56] page four and finish with page
[48:58] 29 and i think the it'll oh yeah
[49:02] right now there's a 35 pages but we're
[49:05] going to go from
[49:06] 4 to 29 by the grace of god
[49:10] and it'll be just around 65 minutes
[49:13] amen so god help us to really
[49:15] concentrate on it
[49:16] really focus on it and not apply it to
[49:18] somebody else
[49:19] apply it to yourself amen lord i need
[49:22] this
[49:23] i need this revelation i need to know it
[49:26] so lord i pray grace
[49:27] don't let me don't let me just take it
[49:29] for granted or just a doctrine
[49:31] or that's the prophet now he's preaching
[49:32] this and preaching that
[49:34] no indeed it's like as i said on the
[49:37] on the internet there they have these
[49:39] videos of brother jack cole preaching
[49:41] and like i said when i turned that on
[49:44] and i knew
[49:44] it was exactly in the same building the
[49:47] same platform
[49:48] and the same people behind him amen that
[49:51] was there
[49:52] when we when we see brother branham's
[49:54] video
[49:55] the black and white of brother branham
[49:57] there amen and brother brown ministers
[49:59] and
[50:00] that's praying for the sick there oh but
[50:02] jack cole was also praying for the sick
[50:04] now jack cole was and maybe this is the
[50:07] way the lord took our brother jack call
[50:09] home
[50:09] at so early in age he was 38 or 39
[50:12] when the lord took him wipe because our
[50:15] brother jack oh my
[50:17] the time to make his calling election
[50:19] sure oh my he
[50:20] he knew god he believed god and i tell
[50:22] you this he knew the devil
[50:24] amen and and he and he was rebuking the
[50:27] devil he was fighting the devil
[50:30] he wasn't there to entertain this one or
[50:31] this one this one he was in a battle
[50:33] and that's why the brother jack cole
[50:37] when people come up first pray pray for
[50:39] the sick or
[50:41] oh he would just look at him and get
[50:43] away satan get out of here
[50:44] he knew that the real satan was to him
[50:47] amen
[50:48] and he knew to the devil now he said in
[50:50] the name of jesus get out of here
[50:52] amen and another time a sister came up
[50:56] and she had a bad back and she had this
[50:58] problem and that problem
[50:59] and jack cole was going to pray for her
[51:02] and he said
[51:03] sister he said stand up and and so on he
[51:06] was
[51:07] he was very very blunt with it when it
[51:09] comes to faith
[51:11] and he took that woman and he got behind
[51:13] her and he put
[51:14] he put his knee knee up into her back
[51:16] and he pulled her back
[51:18] he says you're all right he said that
[51:20] devil's gone
[51:23] amen he cast the devil out and he proved
[51:25] it amen
[51:27] praise the lord so we thank god for our
[51:29] brother jackhole's ministry
[51:31] and of course uh brother brown
[51:33] appreciated that brother too
[51:35] but at the eye at the age of 39 the lord
[51:37] took him home
[51:38] amen because god wanted the emphasis to
[51:40] move to the word
[51:42] amen to the prophetic ministry of
[51:44] william branham
[51:45] amen because the other ministry started
[51:47] to go downhill as well
[51:48] and that was our brother jack and our
[51:50] brother allen tia losbin
[51:52] and our brother oral roberts and and
[51:56] many others when it comes to evangelists
[51:59] and i remember that one of the one of
[52:01] the many
[52:03] was going around the world at that time
[52:05] was here in newfoundland
[52:08] in fact he was in the church and having
[52:10] revival
[52:11] in in a church in bishop in lewisport
[52:13] now bishop falls in lewisport
[52:15] and it was a church that's just just at
[52:17] the beginning just off the highway
[52:20] and so they had a special meeting one
[52:21] time and
[52:23] this brother came i can't recall his
[52:25] name right now but
[52:26] he was one of the evangelists that was
[52:28] right here at the time of william
[52:30] branham
[52:30] amen oral roberts and billy graham
[52:34] so and it was uh oh yeah he preached the
[52:36] word
[52:37] and he might have mentioned even william
[52:38] branham you know
[52:40] and uh because they really appreciated
[52:42] brother branham's ministry
[52:44] and the faith that he had oh yeah oh yes
[52:47] that brother that was it that brother
[52:48] that was in
[52:49] amen we know who came amen
[52:53] and that brother that preached in the
[52:55] church in little sport
[52:57] amen oh yeah he remembered brother
[52:59] branham
[53:00] and he knew brother branham and he oh
[53:03] yeah he and he was
[53:04] he wasn't afraid to express it that he
[53:07] was at absolute confidence in
[53:09] the ministry of william branham amen
[53:11] amen
[53:12] oh yeah and he i think he mentioned him
[53:14] at uh sometimes there
[53:16] when when i was attending those meetings
[53:18] in lewisport
[53:19] so i thank god for it amen
[53:22] and there was something else too that
[53:24] came up and uh
[53:26] e i like it oh yeah he was the brother
[53:28] that said he said listen
[53:30] he said right now in the world today he
[53:32] said there's over a hundred evangelists
[53:34] hundred and some money evangelists and
[53:36] he said we're going here we're doing
[53:37] this we're doing this
[53:39] but he said there's no way that we can
[53:41] compare to william branham
[53:43] amen oh yeah he said listen he said
[53:46] we're doing this oh my but he said and
[53:49] it takes all of us
[53:50] we're all doing this we're all doing
[53:52] that we're all doing that and he said
[53:53] here comes william branham
[53:54] oh my he steps on the platform the
[53:57] anointing is there the power of god is
[53:58] there
[53:59] this one's healed that one's ill he said
[54:00] he doesn't he's not
[54:02] screaming he's not bawling he's not
[54:04] shaking them and doing this with him
[54:06] he said so he told him when he when he
[54:08] was uh
[54:09] gathering together with those
[54:10] ministering brethren sometimes and he
[54:12] said listen
[54:14] i think he mentioned 120 of us he said
[54:16] can't compare he said to william branham
[54:18] oh yeah so and god will bless him for
[54:21] that amen
[54:22] no doubt he's gone on now i pray god
[54:24] rest his soul amen
[54:26] but if there's anything oh yeah brother
[54:27] brown did have perfect faith
[54:29] that's right i believe that and brother
[54:32] and he shared it with us god through the
[54:33] prophet
[54:34] was sharing the perfect faith with us he
[54:36] shared us this faith
[54:38] this faith this faith until we come
[54:40] right down to perfect faith for the
[54:41] rapture
[54:42] we need it so we'll we'll go into the
[54:45] prophet
[54:46] and as he ministers on perfect faith
[54:49] amen and let's say lord lord that's me
[54:52] amen
[54:53] lord i recognize my need amen amen by
[54:56] the grace of god
[54:57] so lord yes lord help us get into the
[55:00] revelation of perfect
[55:01] faith and listen it's not a feeling
[55:04] that's right
[55:05] no it's not feeling it what it is what
[55:07] is perfect faith
[55:08] it's the perfect revelation of god amen
[55:11] for
[55:12] your age for your day amen
[55:16] and well the what luther had was a
[55:18] perfect revelation
[55:19] amen oh yeah for that age
[55:22] amen and then god went on and and wesley
[55:25] hungered
[55:26] and thirsted for that perfect faith amen
[55:28] he got it
[55:29] pentecostal what they had was perfect
[55:31] because that's what god wanted them to
[55:33] have
[55:33] in their day and in their hour amen
[55:36] so are we rejoicing in and praising god
[55:40] and worshiping based on
[55:42] that perfect faith for this day amen
[55:44] what god wants to give us
[55:46] in this hour and what god has given us
[55:48] in this hour
[55:49] not what wesley had or luther at all
[55:51] god's already proven that that's right
[55:53] and we believe it and go on
[55:54] amen yeah go on oh yeah well i'm
[55:57] justified i'm sanctified
[55:58] i'm baptized with the holy ghost i have
[56:00] access to the gifts too
[56:02] oh yeah what what about what what about
[56:04] now
[56:05] what about the the resurrection rapture
[56:07] oh
[56:08] oh that wasn't in the pentecostal
[56:10] message
[56:12] that wasn't in luther's message or
[56:13] wesley's message that wasn't in
[56:15] the this group or that group no
[56:18] where did it come from the opening of
[56:19] the word and the revealing of the
[56:22] mystery of
[56:23] god amen see we're at the end
[56:27] we're finished and god has revealed
[56:29] himself reveal himself reveal himself
[56:31] and to the gentiles oh my look what god
[56:32] has done these last 2 thousand years
[56:35] and now let's finish amen see it's like
[56:39] egypt
[56:39] israel going down to egypt there was a
[56:41] time when they went down time they went
[56:43] under
[56:43] slavery but then at the time when they
[56:45] came back they they were going to go out
[56:48] amen and i pay i know the holy spirit
[56:50] was there
[56:51] to create in their hunger their hearts a
[56:53] hunger and a thirst
[56:55] for deliverance and god said i've heard
[56:57] the cries of my people
[56:59] amen and brother does god hear her cry
[57:02] for the resurrection does god hear our
[57:05] cry for the rapture
[57:06] amen so brother concerning the
[57:08] revelation
[57:09] of what god has done what god has given
[57:11] us brother
[57:12] is he getting the results that he's
[57:14] looking for because he did say
[57:16] when the son of man comes will he find
[57:18] peace
[57:20] that's right amen amen and again i agree
[57:22] with our brother
[57:24] in the translation of this bible and he
[57:26] said it's not a personal
[57:28] faith he said it's a belief in the whole
[57:31] body
[57:32] of revealed truth why because
[57:35] god because that's needed to give us the
[57:38] faith that he wants us to have in this
[57:39] hour amen
[57:40] amen don't stay with luther wesley at
[57:43] the pentecost
[57:44] that's why they're going to be outside
[57:46] the city amen
[57:47] because they're just they're just
[57:48] involved in what god did in the past
[57:51] amen years and years and years ago but
[57:54] they're not getting into what god has
[57:55] revealed and done in this hour in this
[57:57] age
[57:58] and as our brother jonathan mentioned
[57:59] the other night that the problem of
[58:00] god's been gone for about 55 years
[58:03] yeah and i said lord how close are we to
[58:05] the resurrection
[58:06] how close we to the rapture lord please
[58:08] in the name of jesus help us
[58:11] amen then it's getting cooler and cooler
[58:13] and colder
[58:14] and cold amen around the message
[58:18] the zeal is not there well they got zeal
[58:20] for this and zeal for that
[58:22] but how many got the zeal for the
[58:23] rapture that's right how many got a zeal
[58:25] enthusiasm for the resurrection
[58:27] don't be looking for this thank god for
[58:28] that move on thank god for that move on
[58:31] and brother when it comes to the the
[58:33] faith for of the rapture and the
[58:34] resurrection thank god for it
[58:37] the only way we can move on is into
[58:38] eternity
[58:40] amen now move on to another hour and not
[58:42] move on to another age not move on to
[58:44] another
[58:45] oh hopefully another ministry that god
[58:46] will send no no no
[58:49] power god when they asked when they
[58:51] asked the prophet
[58:52] as i said questions and answers on the
[58:53] seals will the bride have a ministry yes
[58:56] he said it's been there since 2000 years
[58:57] ago
[58:58] he said it was there he said back when
[59:00] he started
[59:02] on the day of pentecost and he says the
[59:04] five-full ministry
[59:05] and just think i don't understand how a
[59:07] person can can can just bypass the
[59:09] ministry
[59:11] under this message and move on and say
[59:13] well god
[59:14] the prophet did this the prophet said
[59:16] that i don't need a i don't need a
[59:17] teacher i don't need a pastor i don't
[59:19] need a
[59:20] an evangelist i don't need you know
[59:21] apostles oh
[59:23] don't brother why are they there
[59:26] they're there amen for a reason oh most
[59:29] definitely
[59:30] so let's not get get out of the out of
[59:32] out of the
[59:34] out of the way or the purpose for which
[59:36] god has given the ministry
[59:38] but you've got to respect the ministry
[59:41] amen you've got to acknowledge the lord
[59:43] i believe you're in the ministry
[59:44] amen sure this again that's part of the
[59:48] perfect faith
[59:49] oh yeah perfect faith and like i said a
[59:52] person
[59:53] that just looked down their noses at
[59:55] somebody out there because they're
[59:56] denominational christians uh they don't
[59:59] have perfect
[1:00:00] faith the person that got that attitude
[1:00:02] doesn't have
[1:00:03] perfect faith not by any means
[1:00:06] no as the problem god said he said if i
[1:00:10] went
[1:00:11] if i was traveling and i went somewhere
[1:00:13] and he said
[1:00:14] and i was there on a sunday and he said
[1:00:17] i would
[1:00:18] maybe looking for a message church and
[1:00:20] he said if there was no message church
[1:00:22] he said i would go to the pentecostal
[1:00:24] church that's what he said back
[1:00:26] 55 years ago or more oh yeah
[1:00:29] and yet people all might they wouldn't
[1:00:32] wouldn't consider united pentecost
[1:00:35] pentecostal
[1:00:37] of newfoundland or whatever the
[1:00:38] organization they wouldn't consider this
[1:00:40] this or independent no
[1:00:42] they're not going to go anywhere oh yeah
[1:00:44] and knowing that
[1:00:45] there are believers that have traveled
[1:00:47] around the world practically and brother
[1:00:49] and they've been here and been there
[1:00:50] and not even go to a message church
[1:00:53] probably said he go to pentecost amen
[1:00:56] not only that
[1:00:57] again as that brother that was with me
[1:00:59] one time and we're discussing certain
[1:01:00] things with another brother
[1:01:02] and and he brought up the issue that
[1:01:05] that brother
[1:01:06] didn't call this man a brother
[1:01:09] he was a message preacher but the
[1:01:12] preacher we were talking about
[1:01:13] just just looked down his nose at him
[1:01:16] and he wouldn't call him brother and so
[1:01:19] this this brother that was with me at
[1:01:20] the time
[1:01:21] and he said brother he said you won't
[1:01:25] say
[1:01:25] brother to this pastor you won't call
[1:01:28] his wife sister
[1:01:30] and i told i told them that that years
[1:01:33] ago that wife
[1:01:34] that that pastor and his wife i said
[1:01:36] they don't recognize you
[1:01:37] they don't respect you that's first when
[1:01:39] i come to the message
[1:01:41] and he said what do you mean i said i
[1:01:42] said you're not you're not brother
[1:01:44] so-and-so and sister so-and-so
[1:01:46] i said you're just the first name oh
[1:01:49] that's so on that's the one
[1:01:50] just first name they would never call
[1:01:52] him brother
[1:01:54] yeah and so this brother with corrected
[1:01:57] him
[1:01:57] and he said brother he said the pope or
[1:02:00] the prophet said he called the pope
[1:02:02] brother
[1:02:03] that's right he said i won't do this and
[1:02:06] kiss his finger and all that gives his
[1:02:07] ring
[1:02:08] but he said i call him brother amen
[1:02:11] praise the lord
[1:02:12] it's like jesus you know talking about
[1:02:14] the scribes and the pharisees
[1:02:16] you know and but he said do as they say
[1:02:19] but don't do as they do
[1:02:20] amen by the grace of god so let's keep
[1:02:23] our attitude right and our spirit right
[1:02:25] oh i tell it that's when he comes when
[1:02:27] he finds that kind of a faith
[1:02:28] amen amen a right attitude and a right
[1:02:31] spirit
[1:02:32] you're reaching out to them amen if not
[1:02:35] bride you're reaching out just to give
[1:02:37] them god's blessing
[1:02:38] amen sure if you're not bride just the
[1:02:41] bible says it's a strong god to support
[1:02:43] the weak
[1:02:44] amen just think the bible acknowledges
[1:02:46] there's going to be these these and
[1:02:48] these and these
[1:02:49] in god's calling now he said i want you
[1:02:51] to support the weak
[1:02:53] and encourage them by the grace of god
[1:02:58] amen so bear with me uh
[1:03:02] brother baum said just before he went
[1:03:05] into
[1:03:06] perfect faith message and revelation he
[1:03:08] said
[1:03:11] i get spells too he said you know i get
[1:03:15] moody
[1:03:17] he said i get to a spot to where he said
[1:03:19] what gets me
[1:03:20] is where do i get to these spells
[1:03:24] when i get all overworked and satan
[1:03:27] comes telling me
[1:03:28] why nobody cares for you and he says you
[1:03:30] really haven't got a friend in the world
[1:03:33] remember i'm not immune to the
[1:03:36] temptation
[1:03:37] and he said see i got to overcome
[1:03:40] that and if the prophet overcame it we
[1:03:43] gotta overcome
[1:03:44] it amen by the word just stay with the
[1:03:47] word
[1:03:47] encourage yourself with with what god is
[1:03:50] doing
[1:03:51] amen amen and that he's given you the
[1:03:54] revelation of what he's doing
[1:03:55] he's giving you the revelation of what
[1:03:57] he wants you to look for
[1:03:59] and hunger and thirst for amen
[1:04:03] and he said again you know what the
[1:04:06] bible said
[1:04:07] they could say nothing amiss but the man
[1:04:09] was standing right in their midst
[1:04:12] of whom the miracle was done on and he
[1:04:14] said it puts
[1:04:15] satan to a shame amen
[1:04:18] brother don't let him put us to a shame
[1:04:21] put him to a shame
[1:04:23] amen rebuke him with the word jesus gave
[1:04:26] us that perfect example
[1:04:28] when satan tempted him he didn't go do
[1:04:31] this do this
[1:04:32] no he just gave him the word get thee
[1:04:34] behind me satan
[1:04:35] thou shall not tempt the lord thy god
[1:04:37] amen amen
[1:04:39] don't do this don't do that amen
[1:04:42] oh yes think when when after 40 days he
[1:04:45] was hungry
[1:04:46] and the devil said we'll turn this stone
[1:04:48] into into a loaf of bread
[1:04:49] and he said to satisfy your hunger oh
[1:04:52] yeah
[1:04:52] so are we going to do that do they do
[1:04:54] what we're looking for spirit naturally
[1:04:56] or we're going to just move it aside and
[1:04:58] go on spiritually
[1:05:00] oh brother there's two men focusing that
[1:05:02] there's too many focusing on
[1:05:04] the natural things not the spiritual
[1:05:07] amen
[1:05:10] so he said you take your stand and so on
[1:05:12] he said it put satan
[1:05:13] to a shame doesn't it amen
[1:05:17] and he said does god raise the dead he
[1:05:19] said here sits a man right here
[1:05:22] raised from the dead amen
[1:05:25] god heal the sick oh my he
[1:05:28] the hands could just go everywhere god
[1:05:31] heals the sick
[1:05:33] and we god help us if you're sick and
[1:05:36] you need the touch of the lord
[1:05:38] please believe amen don't focus on the
[1:05:41] negative don't focus on the symptoms
[1:05:43] focus on faith

[1:05:47] praying
[1:05:47] amen he said god heal the sick yes
[1:05:51] oh my said the hands could just go
[1:05:53] everywhere god heals the sick

[1:06:07] present
[1:06:08] everywhere the same yesterday today
[1:06:11] forever

[1:09:46] let go and let god have his way
[1:09:48] by grace amen so the lord bless you
[1:09:51] and sorry to keep sister mourinho so
[1:09:54] long we'll go right into the tape
[1:09:55] brother matthew
[1:09:57] amen and uh as i said it will be
[1:10:00] it starts on page four
[1:10:04] and i assume let's certainly see
[1:10:09] yeah paragraph 17 that's where he begins
[1:10:12] to read his scripture
[1:10:13] amen so lord bless you as we go to the
[1:10:15] word
[1:10:28] amen
[1:10:34] 11th chapter of saint martin
[1:10:38] and we're going to begin to read about
[1:10:41] the
[1:10:42] the 22nd verse of the
[1:10:45] 11th chapter of saint mark
[1:10:48] and many of you know this scripture it's
[1:10:51] very familiar
[1:10:52] it was a scripture i was thinking on uh
[1:10:55] brother russell when those
[1:10:57] when he spoke to me and said about those
[1:10:59] squirrels
[1:11:01] and they that was just the very
[1:11:02] scripture i was thinking of
[1:11:04] it's always been a puzzle he said if ye
[1:11:07] say not if i say if you say
[1:11:12] now let us read jesus answering
[1:11:16] said unto them have faith in god
[1:11:19] for verily i say unto you that whosoever
[1:11:22] shall say unto this mountain
[1:11:24] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[1:11:27] the sea
[1:11:28] and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:11:32] but shall believe that those saints
[1:11:34] which he saith
[1:11:36] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:11:39] whatsoever he saith and
[1:11:42] therefore i say unto you what things so
[1:11:45] every you desire
[1:11:48] when you pray believe that ye receive
[1:11:51] them
[1:11:51] and you shall have them
[1:11:55] and when you stand praise forgive
[1:11:59] if you have ought against any that your
[1:12:02] father
[1:12:02] also that your father also which is in
[1:12:06] heaven may forgive you
[1:12:07] your trespasses but if you do not
[1:12:10] forgive
[1:12:12] neither will your father which is in
[1:12:15] heaven forgive
[1:12:16] your trespasses now
[1:12:20] faith is based on forgiveness
[1:12:26] and then as we said this morning trying
[1:12:28] to get the church
[1:12:29] into the place to where we could really
[1:12:32] see
[1:12:32] apostolic times moving among us that's
[1:12:36] what we all hunger
[1:12:38] and it's just laying right at the door
[1:12:40] yeah we see it
[1:12:41] but we want to see more of it we wanted
[1:12:44] such a flow
[1:12:45] that it'll it'll be a help to us to flow
[1:12:48] out to others remember jesus
[1:12:52] as we had in the lesson this morning he
[1:12:54] never used his power for himself
[1:12:57] he used it for others that's what it was
[1:13:00] set for
[1:13:02] and you think sometimes why would a man
[1:13:05] that was so full of power like him would
[1:13:08] have ever be sick
[1:13:10] yes sir i've read
[1:13:13] and some books somewhere where when he
[1:13:15] raised up that boy for the widow's
[1:13:18] son from nan i believe that prince the
[1:13:20] house of david
[1:13:21] that he stepped on a rock and thrown
[1:13:23] with a headache
[1:13:25] he bore our infirmities bear means to
[1:13:28] pack them
[1:13:31] and he had all things and like we have
[1:13:34] he
[1:13:35] had sickness he had temptations he had
[1:13:37] trouble
[1:13:38] he had flusteration just as we have
[1:13:40] because
[1:13:41] he had to be the right kind of a
[1:13:43] mediator
[1:13:44] so he had to be partakers the husband
[1:13:46] and of the fruit before you even know
[1:13:49] the woman has to well and many things
[1:13:51] see if we look right into the scripture
[1:13:54] i want to say that i believe every
[1:13:56] scripture
[1:13:58] never been up to this room there's
[1:14:00] critics today that don't want to believe
[1:14:01] that
[1:14:03] a critic once said that when jesus
[1:14:06] said there was disciples to where that
[1:14:08] colt was tied
[1:14:10] or two ways met that he pre-arranged
[1:14:12] that
[1:14:14] for where that quote was timed see they
[1:14:16] don't understand that god
[1:14:18] pre-arranges god told me
[1:14:22] other day was brother down here that i
[1:14:24] would shake his hand on the street again
[1:14:27] that's very strange i wasn't here that
[1:14:29] morning
[1:14:31] but two minutes longer or a minute
[1:14:33] longer i not met him on the street but i
[1:14:35] stepped off the car
[1:14:36] just in time to shake his hands when he
[1:14:38] was coming in on the street
[1:14:40] he didn't know me he had his glasses off
[1:14:43] he couldn't see me when he heard my
[1:14:45] voice
[1:14:45] he started crying what was it usually he
[1:14:48] doesn't do that but it was the answer to
[1:14:50] what was told him up there
[1:14:51] under the oxygen tent he would do it i
[1:14:54] said you were also set in the church
[1:14:56] again his heart's desire when he was
[1:14:59] having chicago meeting
[1:15:00] he wanted to come to that meeting his
[1:15:02] heart was part
[1:15:04] i sent him a telegram of greetings for
[1:15:06] us and the children told him was praying
[1:15:08] that he
[1:15:08] could get well right quick and a loving
[1:15:11] brother
[1:15:12] who visits him said that you he just
[1:15:14] wanted to come so bad
[1:15:16] but here he said tonight see
[1:15:19] that was not pre-arranged the same god
[1:15:23] arranges he makes everything work
[1:15:25] perfectly on the dollar
[1:15:27] amen a critic once said that no wonder
[1:15:30] jesus could take
[1:15:31] five loaves and feed five thousand
[1:15:34] said the loaves were bigger in that day
[1:15:36] and he just cut each loaf to feed a
[1:15:38] thousand
[1:15:39] i'll give you to understand a little boy
[1:15:41] had it in his lunch
[1:15:47] a little child packed five rows of bread
[1:15:49] that could feed five
[1:15:51] deeply then what about the twelve
[1:15:53] basketballs taking that fast
[1:15:56] oh they just that's just critics that's
[1:15:59] all
[1:16:00] that doesn't change god's word it's just
[1:16:03] the same thing
[1:16:04] moving on now we want to speak now
[1:16:08] upon faith and a different type of faith
[1:16:11] perfect faith that's a great thing
[1:16:15] now a faith we're told in the bible
[1:16:19] faith cometh by hearing
[1:16:22] now you cannot be saved without faith
[1:16:26] and faith is something that you have to
[1:16:28] believe is there
[1:16:30] that really nothing else will
[1:16:31] declaration but faith
[1:16:34] now i'm trying to bring
[1:16:37] faith to you so that you can be ready
[1:16:40] for this prayer line
[1:16:41] the next few minutes now faith
[1:16:45] he that cometh to god must believe
[1:16:49] that he is and it's impossible to
[1:16:52] to please god without faith you cannot
[1:16:56] please
[1:16:57] and if you say you believe god you have
[1:16:59] never seen him
[1:17:01] see so then you've got to believe it by
[1:17:04] faith
[1:17:04] and if you could see him it would be no
[1:17:06] more faith
[1:17:07] see anything that the sentence declares
[1:17:10] is no more faith
[1:17:11] it's a scientific fact see it's not
[1:17:14] no more faith but you have to accept him
[1:17:16] by faith
[1:17:17] and he that cometh to god
[1:17:20] must believe god and faith comes by
[1:17:24] hearing the word of god amen see
[1:17:27] you must first believe this is god's
[1:17:30] word
[1:17:32] and you must come to
[1:17:35] god by the word evan sees
[1:17:39] just take the word what it says and
[1:17:41] that's right
[1:17:43] everything else contrary to it is not
[1:17:45] right
[1:17:46] abraham had to believe just what that
[1:17:48] boss told him
[1:17:51] and when he was 100 years old 25 years
[1:17:54] later he was stronger believing it was
[1:17:56] 25 years ago when it was given to me
[1:17:59] he believed it and he staggered not at
[1:18:02] the promise
[1:18:04] of god through unbelief but was strong
[1:18:06] giving praise to god
[1:18:08] knowing that he was able to perform
[1:18:12] what he promised that's why everyone
[1:18:14] must be that way you must come with
[1:18:17] an unfailing faith believing that god
[1:18:21] made the promise
[1:18:22] but now you have to be in a position to
[1:18:24] have that faith and that's what we're
[1:18:25] going to talk about
[1:18:27] they receive that faith in hebrews
[1:18:30] the book of hebrews 11th chapter we're
[1:18:33] told that
[1:18:34] faith is the substance of things so far
[1:18:38] now here's where many people fail
[1:18:41] to receive their healing or what they're
[1:18:45] asking for because
[1:18:46] they take faith to be something that it
[1:18:50] is not
[1:18:51] see they don't believe it
[1:18:55] it's not a imagination
[1:18:59] it is a actual substance
[1:19:05] now listen close see it
[1:19:08] is not what you imagine it's just as
[1:19:12] real to you as any sense of your body
[1:19:14] will declare anything else
[1:19:16] it's just as real as my eyes says
[1:19:19] this is a piece of paper it's just as
[1:19:22] real as to say
[1:19:23] that but that is a lie
[1:19:26] it's just as real as the that i feel my
[1:19:29] coat
[1:19:30] it's just as real as the as i hear that
[1:19:34] baby
[1:19:34] talking uh there or making this noise
[1:19:37] see
[1:19:37] it's just that real it's music playing
[1:19:40] it's just
[1:19:41] as real as i taste anything in my mouth
[1:19:44] it is that real only you can't show it
[1:19:47] to somebody else
[1:19:49] you have alone amen
[1:19:53] it's yours faith is
[1:19:56] the substance amen see it's not just a
[1:19:59] myth
[1:20:00] so many people call now these are real
[1:20:04] deep lessons and i'll catch the top of
[1:20:07] it and then you dig down in it
[1:20:09] notice it is something that you possess
[1:20:14] ah not imagination
[1:20:17] you really have it it's just as
[1:20:20] real to you as any other thing that
[1:20:23] could be
[1:20:24] it's just as real as as you know that
[1:20:27] that you're right in your automobile
[1:20:29] it's just as real as you know that
[1:20:30] you're sitting in the church
[1:20:32] it's just as real as you hear my boy it
[1:20:35] is a substance not an imagination not an
[1:20:39] emotion
[1:20:41] but something that you have and it comes
[1:20:44] to you
[1:20:45] by hearing the word of god in that only
[1:20:48] amen faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:20:52] the word of god
[1:20:53] that puts it back so where
[1:20:56] your faith in is not in some individual
[1:21:00] it's not in a man it's not in our
[1:21:02] organization it's not in a group of
[1:21:04] people
[1:21:05] it's in god because god is the word
[1:21:08] amen your faith is in
[1:21:11] god faith cometh by hearing
[1:21:14] the word of god then when god
[1:21:17] by his word not what somebody else did
[1:21:20] somebody else did
[1:21:22] but by what god's word said
[1:21:25] he said let every man's worth be alive
[1:21:28] and mine
[1:21:29] be true now you see somebody else
[1:21:33] do something by a word act of god
[1:21:36] or promise of god and many of them say i
[1:21:40] can do that too it's an imagination
[1:21:44] and when they do you find them rigged up
[1:21:46] out there somewhere
[1:21:47] yes it's got to be a substance
[1:21:51] now that is potentially a faith
[1:21:54] that is something that would bring you
[1:21:56] to a faith
[1:21:58] it's potentially like if you ask me for
[1:22:00] an oak tree and i'll give you an
[1:22:02] acorn potentially you have an oak tree
[1:22:05] but it hasn't produced itself yet but
[1:22:07] when it really brings itself out it is
[1:22:10] an
[1:22:10] oak tree and when you imagine that god
[1:22:13] does this
[1:22:14] but when it's revealed to you it's a
[1:22:16] faith stand
[1:22:17] a perfect faith that cannot fail
[1:22:22] that's the reason those visions are so
[1:22:24] so tremendous to me
[1:22:27] because it's been proved right every
[1:22:29] time
[1:22:30] see and i know that he promised that and
[1:22:33] he promised in his word and here he
[1:22:34] comes and promises
[1:22:36] for this day therefore you know where
[1:22:38] you're standing when he says so
[1:22:41] that gives me a faith because he never
[1:22:43] does nothing contrary to his written
[1:22:45] word
[1:22:46] see and if it was contrary to the word i
[1:22:49] couldn't have faith in it
[1:22:50] brings it right back again to the word
[1:22:53] see faith in
[1:22:54] hearing the word of god you must share
[1:22:56] the word god's word is that all
[1:22:58] sufficient word
[1:23:00] that's all you have need of is this word
[1:23:03] now
[1:23:03] faith being deception and in there we
[1:23:06] find out
[1:23:07] in hebrews what faith was and what
[1:23:10] those did you have faith
[1:23:13] see there's many times that people have
[1:23:15] faith today and tomorrow they haven't
[1:23:17] got it
[1:23:18] the next day there's something and
[1:23:19] something else but when god wants
[1:23:21] anchors and you see it there's nothing
[1:23:24] ever going to make you move from it
[1:23:27] you're just poking reaching pursuing
[1:23:30] and pursuing this adventure without
[1:23:32] authority you're just trying
[1:23:34] this and trying this and go to this and
[1:23:36] run here and run there
[1:23:37] you haven't got the faith yet but when
[1:23:40] that is what we call thing
[1:23:44] excuse me i want you to thank you i want
[1:23:47] you to
[1:23:48] get this now we the church has got to
[1:23:51] lift itself
[1:23:52] in the power of god how we're too close
[1:23:55] to the end now
[1:23:57] and i believe the church is in condition
[1:23:59] where we can teach it
[1:24:01] a little deeper things and rub some of
[1:24:03] this make-believe out
[1:24:06] and get into something real see it's got
[1:24:09] to be
[1:24:09] something that you know
[1:24:13] if you say uh uh brother branham
[1:24:16] uh that isn't a lie
[1:24:19] yet i know it's a lot how do you know
[1:24:22] it's like
[1:24:23] i'm looking at it or how you know what
[1:24:26] you could be wrong
[1:24:27] my side has always declared to me that
[1:24:29] that was life
[1:24:32] and that's the reason i believe those
[1:24:33] visions because it's always declared to
[1:24:35] me the truth because it comes from the
[1:24:37] word amen
[1:24:39] then if he says it that settles it now
[1:24:42] when it's declared like that there's no
[1:24:43] more guesswork
[1:24:45] it's going to be then you hear it just
[1:24:48] past the law see because it's beyond the
[1:24:51] human thinking
[1:24:53] it's up into the realms of the large
[1:24:55] things
[1:24:56] but you're standing here just as the
[1:24:57] vine just as the french
[1:25:00] producing the fruit that's in the vine
[1:25:02] see
[1:25:03] god uses man and man only god doesn't
[1:25:06] use machinery god doesn't use groups to
[1:25:08] man
[1:25:08] god doesn't use organization god uses
[1:25:11] individuals
[1:25:13] always now faith is
[1:25:16] the substance and fight we understand
[1:25:19] all those things to done
[1:25:20] it's not a it's not a imagination it is
[1:25:24] a
[1:25:24] substance especially perfect faith
[1:25:27] that's what i'm talking on tonight
[1:25:28] getting to
[1:25:29] perfect faith it is not an imagination
[1:25:34] now other judge people can say well i
[1:25:35] got all faith or i sure have
[1:25:38] or you stand here for it you see see
[1:25:41] your your very actions prove that you
[1:25:44] haven't got what you're talking about
[1:25:46] see if you have faith then where you
[1:25:48] standing for airlines
[1:25:50] what do you do these things see if you
[1:25:53] had perfect faith
[1:25:54] you'd look right straight to god and
[1:25:56] believe it and walk away
[1:25:58] and you would you would have no need of
[1:25:59] coming into a prayer
[1:26:01] you'd have no need of these things
[1:26:03] because your faith has done made it so
[1:26:08] what would be the use for me saying i
[1:26:10] got to put a shirt on
[1:26:12] i got a shirt on how do you know you got
[1:26:15] a shirt
[1:26:16] well i see it feel it and i know it's
[1:26:19] there
[1:26:20] well that's just how real that when
[1:26:22] perfect
[1:26:23] faith takes the hope you don't need no
[1:26:26] more
[1:26:27] already done you know it hallelujah how
[1:26:30] do you do it
[1:26:30] faith healthy soul hey man that's it
[1:26:33] see do you get it down one of these
[1:26:36] that's perfect
[1:26:37] faith not otherwise i'm venturing out
[1:26:40] well i'll go the bible say call the
[1:26:42] elders let them know they want to pray
[1:26:43] over
[1:26:43] i know i'll go and you say well i'm
[1:26:46] going to be healed
[1:26:46] you're making yourself if don't watch
[1:26:48] how you're going to make yourself
[1:26:50] just it's worked out then when he passed
[1:26:52] you you say
[1:26:54] oh i still don't feel i see there he was
[1:26:57] you didn't have faith your genuine faith
[1:27:00] will do it right there
[1:27:02] your genuine faith will make it so
[1:27:04] surreal to you that
[1:27:06] look at that little woman with a blood
[1:27:07] issue she said if i can only touch the
[1:27:09] border of his garment i'll be made well
[1:27:12] and as soon as she did it she said she
[1:27:14] felt within herself that her blood
[1:27:16] issues stopped
[1:27:18] and she actually believed it
[1:27:22] and when she touched it the through
[1:27:25] there stopped
[1:27:26] it stopped jesus turned and said who
[1:27:28] touched me
[1:27:30] that's perfect faith and that same
[1:27:33] perfect faith tonight will touch jesus
[1:27:36] christ just as it did then
[1:27:38] a woman come with a perfect face for
[1:27:41] that time
[1:27:42] now now we see at first
[1:27:46] the disciples didn't have this perfect
[1:27:49] faith
[1:27:50] they didn't have it because they had
[1:27:53] christ
[1:27:54] walking with him but then altered christ
[1:27:57] was in that
[1:27:58] amen and so you see it's hard then
[1:28:02] to have this perfect faith without
[1:28:05] the holy spirit it has to bring it
[1:28:08] it does now you say the disciples didn't
[1:28:11] have perfect faith no
[1:28:12] or they had an epileptic child there
[1:28:15] that they were trying to cast this devil
[1:28:17] out
[1:28:18] and they couldn't do it and the father
[1:28:20] seen jesus coming
[1:28:22] and he said we have brought my son to
[1:28:25] your disciples
[1:28:26] and they could not cure him
[1:28:30] and afterwards the disciples asked jesus
[1:28:34] saying
[1:28:34] why could not we cure him and jesus says
[1:28:38] because of the lack of faith and of your
[1:28:41] unbelief
[1:28:42] that's right because of your unbelief
[1:28:45] that's
[1:28:46] i remember they had this house
[1:28:50] jesus had given them power the healer
[1:28:53] was sick to raise the dead and cast out
[1:28:55] devils just a few days before that
[1:28:57] yeah they had the power
[1:29:00] but not the faith to use the power
[1:29:04] now there's the brand tabernacle there's
[1:29:06] the church the bride today
[1:29:09] the holy spirit is here with the power
[1:29:12] amen but you haven't got that faith to
[1:29:14] prove it amen
[1:29:15] amen see what it means
[1:29:20] amen it takes faith to move it here i
[1:29:24] got a shell that i
[1:29:25] hand loaded i know what it'll do by
[1:29:27] ballistics
[1:29:28] like the word but i've got to fire the
[1:29:31] gun
[1:29:33] the fire has to get to the power the
[1:29:35] powder's got the power of us got to have
[1:29:37] the fire to light it off
[1:29:39] and the same thing that powers in the
[1:29:41] shell
[1:29:42] but it needs base to charge it
[1:29:46] and throw it out that's what it takes
[1:29:51] perfect faith to ignite the power of the
[1:29:54] holy spirit which we have now
[1:29:56] since he's come upon us ever faith to
[1:29:58] ignite
[1:30:00] to see great things issues
[1:30:04] the faith something that presents it to
[1:30:06] you
[1:30:07] for the heart full of joy you walk into
[1:30:09] the stick room knowing exactly what
[1:30:11] you're going to say
[1:30:12] walk in there and know what's going to
[1:30:14] happen something's already been revealed
[1:30:16] and you know it when you walk in in the
[1:30:19] name of jesus christ rise up from there
[1:30:22] pay up the law there you are that's
[1:30:24] perfect faith
[1:30:26] if there's these 10 million people
[1:30:28] standing it wouldn't happen you know
[1:30:29] what's going to happen anyhow
[1:30:31] because you know it it's going to happen
[1:30:34] regardless what anybody else says you're
[1:30:36] the ones got the faith
[1:30:38] could you imagine joshua he called the
[1:30:42] elders of israel together and said
[1:30:44] uh brethren we are the servants of the
[1:30:47] lord
[1:30:48] i would like for you to say uh ask the
[1:30:50] lord if it'd be all right
[1:30:52] if uh if he give us a little more
[1:30:53] sunlight see
[1:30:55] and hold his son a little while no
[1:30:58] he has need of it and without prayer
[1:31:01] without anything he had need of it and
[1:31:04] he just
[1:31:05] commanded the son he said
[1:31:08] stand there amen i have need
[1:31:12] and i'll be in the service of the yeah
[1:31:15] but he sent me over here to do this job
[1:31:18] and i'm doing the best i don't know how
[1:31:20] and the enemy is routed
[1:31:22] and they're out in here if i let the sun
[1:31:24] go down they'll get together and cause
[1:31:25] me more trouble so stand still
[1:31:36] now if the world's turning it holds it
[1:31:38] up and the sun stays in the place and it
[1:31:40] don't run
[1:31:41] what happened then that's right
[1:31:44] now you make yourself a infidel if you
[1:31:48] say
[1:31:48] this and then if you don't you shouldn't
[1:31:50] full of science because they said the
[1:31:51] world stop and drop
[1:31:53] so now if you say god's word is not
[1:31:56] right then you're in for them
[1:31:59] but it happened that's the main game i
[1:32:01] don't know
[1:32:02] the mechanics of it but it happened i
[1:32:05] don't know the mechanics of the holy
[1:32:06] ghost but i know it fell on me
[1:32:08] i can't tell the mechanics of it but i
[1:32:10] know the blessings of it
[1:32:12] that's that's all i don't know about is
[1:32:14] the blessing of the holy ghost
[1:32:16] and mechanics keyword seminars is secret
[1:32:19] this lord cannot be healed because the
[1:32:21] disciples had power
[1:32:23] jesus gave them power to heal all manner
[1:32:25] of sickness
[1:32:26] to cast out devils to cleanse the
[1:32:28] efforts and to raise the dead
[1:32:31] he gave them power but they didn't have
[1:32:34] faith to operate the power that they had
[1:32:37] and then they questioned jesus and said
[1:32:39] well now why couldn't we do it now
[1:32:41] remember they
[1:32:42] had the word and the word was flesh then
[1:32:47] and the word told them i give you power
[1:32:50] heaven amen
[1:32:54] i give you power and they had the power
[1:32:59] but they didn't have faith to operate
[1:33:01] the word that was in them
[1:33:03] amen you know what i mean but
[1:33:07] jesus had it he was the word
[1:33:11] and he had faith that what he said would
[1:33:13] happen
[1:33:14] amen he said oh bring him here
[1:33:18] how long will he suffer
[1:33:21] he had faith with his power
[1:33:25] how did he he said i can do
[1:33:28] nothing in myself why he relied
[1:33:32] upon what he was
[1:33:36] he relied in knowing that he was the
[1:33:38] word
[1:33:39] and he had faith in god who made him the
[1:33:43] word
[1:33:44] he was god the word and it was in him in
[1:33:47] that
[1:33:48] giving faith because he understood his
[1:33:50] position
[1:33:52] he knowed what he was because the
[1:33:54] scripture had said
[1:33:55] he was this and you know the scriptures
[1:33:58] tied in to prove that he was exactly
[1:34:00] what the scripture
[1:34:01] said he would be and he knew what he was
[1:34:05] therefore he relied upon what
[1:34:08] god had made him amen and if he did that
[1:34:13] then can't we rely on what god made us
[1:34:16] as believers these signs
[1:34:18] shall follow in that belief
[1:34:21] [Music]
[1:34:22] he had faith and what he was
[1:34:26] and if you are a believer you have faith
[1:34:28] in what you are
[1:34:30] you are a believer and if you've got
[1:34:33] faith in god
[1:34:34] the bible says over here you know if our
[1:34:37] uh if our hearts condemn us
[1:34:40] then we can have faith but if our hearts
[1:34:43] don't condemn us
[1:34:44] then we have faith we have confidence
[1:34:46] towards god
[1:34:48] if you want to read that found saint
[1:34:49] john 3 21. i got the scripture written
[1:34:51] down there
[1:34:52] my moment then i mean first john 3 21
[1:34:56] uh notice if our hearts condemn us not
[1:35:00] then we have confidence towards god but
[1:35:02] as long as you're doing things that's
[1:35:04] wrong
[1:35:04] you can't have confidence towards god
[1:35:06] right so you see you can you
[1:35:09] automatically know that you're wrong
[1:35:12] you're already not gonna touch yourself
[1:35:13] like you're a sinner
[1:35:15] by knowing that you're wrong but when
[1:35:18] your heart don't condemn you and you
[1:35:19] know you are a believer
[1:35:21] and there's nothing between you and god
[1:35:23] you can ask what you will
[1:35:25] and know that it will be given because
[1:35:27] it's the word that's given to you
[1:35:29] just like it was to those disciples now
[1:35:31] the only thing you have to do then
[1:35:33] is have faith in what you are
[1:35:36] and have faith in what the word says you
[1:35:39] want
[1:35:40] and jesus had faith in the word of god
[1:35:42] that said what he was
[1:35:43] it is written of me didn't david and the
[1:35:47] psalms and the prophets and all of them
[1:35:48] speak of him i am the bread of life that
[1:35:51] come from god out of heaven
[1:35:53] amen i am the tree of life from
[1:35:56] the garden of eden i am all these things
[1:35:59] i am what i am
[1:36:01] and he knew that a perfect faith that he
[1:36:04] was the anointed messiah
[1:36:06] that the spirit of god was upon him
[1:36:09] he said i myself do nothing but it's my
[1:36:12] faith in god
[1:36:13] and god presenting the word may manifest
[1:36:16] and when the word of god comes in you
[1:36:18] it's made manifest
[1:36:20] or you are a believer see and a believer
[1:36:23] is the faith of god that moves in you
[1:36:26] you like that
[1:36:28] i like when you all right before the
[1:36:31] how to what faith really is knowing who
[1:36:34] he was
[1:36:35] without a shadow out he knew he was
[1:36:38] the son of god he knew it
[1:36:42] for the word identified
[1:36:46] the word of god identified who he was
[1:36:50] he said if i do not have to worship my
[1:36:51] father then don't believe me
[1:36:53] but if if i don't do them works don't
[1:36:56] believe me but if i do
[1:36:57] then believe the worst for they are the
[1:37:00] manifested word promise
[1:37:02] or if you just wake up to you see
[1:37:07] the word itself identified who you are
[1:37:11] and he said who can condemn me and stand
[1:37:14] in other words who can show me that my
[1:37:17] life and my works don't fulfill exactly
[1:37:20] what messiah should do
[1:37:23] nobody could say nothing for he was
[1:37:26] then he had faith to believe that
[1:37:28] whatever he said it would happen
[1:37:30] then he turned around and said the works
[1:37:32] that i do shall you also a little while
[1:37:34] the world says no more yet you shall
[1:37:36] because i'll be with you even in you
[1:37:39] take those thought what you shall say
[1:37:40] for it's not you to speak it's that
[1:37:42] father that dwelleth in you
[1:37:44] he's one doesn't speak and it's not me
[1:37:46] it's the father that dwelleth in me
[1:37:48] he jewett the word see what i mean
[1:37:52] now the identification of a scripture
[1:37:56] christian these words said jesus
[1:38:00] these signs shall follow them that
[1:38:02] believe
[1:38:03] now how can you call yourself a believer
[1:38:06] of people
[1:38:07] and deny those words how can you call
[1:38:10] yourself a believer
[1:38:12] and deny any of this woman right amen
[1:38:15] you can't
[1:38:16] do it you're not a believer therefore
[1:38:18] signs can't fall
[1:38:19] because you just accept what you want to
[1:38:22] believe and let the rest of it you want
[1:38:23] don't believe it
[1:38:24] but you've got to take the whole thing
[1:38:26] and believe it amen and when you truly
[1:38:28] believe not make believe but really
[1:38:30] believe
[1:38:30] then these signs follow them they
[1:38:32] believe oh
[1:38:34] could you compare christians today with
[1:38:35] them christians of long ago
[1:38:37] how their disciples walked in the power
[1:38:39] of the spirit
[1:38:40] moved by the holy ghost to go just a
[1:38:43] prisoner as i preached on the other
[1:38:44] night
[1:38:44] a prisoner to the word and will of god
[1:38:47] he couldn't even move
[1:38:48] until god moved him would you like to
[1:38:50] see a church rise like that
[1:38:53] it's going to praise god
[1:39:04] identifies himself what he was
[1:39:07] and the same word identifies us
[1:39:12] if a man loves me he keeps my
[1:39:14] commandments
[1:39:16] and if he says he loves me keeps not my
[1:39:18] commandment that's all of me
[1:39:19] he's alive truth's not even anything
[1:39:23] you say well i don't believe well then
[1:39:24] that you're just not a believer that's
[1:39:26] all
[1:39:26] if the bible said so that makes it right
[1:39:29] amen
[1:39:31] what the bible says is the truth notice
[1:39:35] or he said to us if he abides me in my
[1:39:38] word you think john 15.
[1:39:40] if you abide me see and faith in him
[1:39:44] give by me and my word abides in you
[1:39:48] then you ask what you will
[1:39:52] now see he knew who he was
[1:39:55] therefore he had faith faith could
[1:39:58] produce when he knows what he was
[1:39:59] now if he abides me and my word in you
[1:40:02] then you know who you are
[1:40:04] yeah amen that's what you will it'll be
[1:40:07] given to you
[1:40:08] wouldn't that be a wonderful night if
[1:40:09] everybody come that prayer line and say
[1:40:11] i am a christian
[1:40:12] i have no condemnation i i know that my
[1:40:16] heart can then or not
[1:40:17] something tells me that the night's the
[1:40:19] end of my suffering
[1:40:20] and uh
[1:40:23] no matter how much you come in emotion
[1:40:25] how much you do it won't work until
[1:40:27] that perfect faith has manifested and
[1:40:30] identified itself in you as the
[1:40:31] substance
[1:40:33] when it's there then nothing's gonna
[1:40:34] shake you from it if
[1:40:36] if you had cancer and the doctor told
[1:40:39] you
[1:40:39] yesterday that you'd be dead before
[1:40:41] monday morning all your heart your
[1:40:43] respiration is gone
[1:40:44] the cancers eat you up your bloodstream
[1:40:46] become completely cancer
[1:40:48] whatever it is and something come with
[1:40:50] this substance that this genuine faith
[1:40:53] perfect faith
[1:40:54] was made of substance in you you're
[1:40:55] laughing at doctor's face
[1:40:57] you'd be like all eyes you when he
[1:40:59] walked up and down before that idol and
[1:41:01] said won't you call a little louder
[1:41:02] maybe it's pursuing
[1:41:04] he knew what he was going to do because
[1:41:06] god had told him what was going to
[1:41:07] happen
[1:41:08] he said that's the god that answers the
[1:41:10] fire be god they said we'll take that
[1:41:12] proposition
[1:41:13] and they poured water upon their altars
[1:41:16] and they
[1:41:16] they cut themselves they've done
[1:41:18] everything and called old bail bail
[1:41:20] answered elijah's just as calm as he
[1:41:21] could be
[1:41:23] he said call aloud that said maybe he's
[1:41:26] pursuing maybe maybe he's
[1:41:27] on a fishing trip maybe he's good at
[1:41:29] something else he's out somewhere
[1:41:31] it's just made fun of him because he
[1:41:34] knew it's going to happen amen oh watch
[1:41:37] when he caught everything in order
[1:41:39] walked out there and said lord god of
[1:41:41] abraham isaac and his israel
[1:41:43] never called him his name jacob
[1:41:45] scheister he called him
[1:41:47] israel prince with god lord god of

[1:42:12] altar i've done all these things
[1:42:14] according to your command

[1:42:18] fire fell from the heavens
[1:42:20] he was just as confident he's gonna fall
[1:42:22] because he had the substance
[1:42:24] why the word said so
[1:42:28] now this same bible is the same god's
[1:42:31] word
[1:42:32] amen and when you can receive the

[1:43:12] is that a chair over here will you sit
[1:43:13] down and wrestle
[1:43:16] he'll be here just in a moment students
[1:43:18] got caught
[1:43:19] that night another little boy in finland
[1:43:21] that day brother laying there
[1:43:23] dead been laying there for a half hour
[1:43:25] mashed up
[1:43:26] blood running out of eyes nose and ears
[1:43:28] his little legs broke up in his
[1:43:30] little stopping his feet out through the
[1:43:32] enemy stockings his shoe's gone
[1:43:35] ah little i thought that ought to be
[1:43:36] that boy
[1:43:38] i said hey let's look in the back of
[1:43:40] that bible brother more we got brother
[1:43:42] lindsay but more look back there and it
[1:43:43] shall come to pass saith the lord
[1:43:46] oh my there will be a
[1:43:49] land worth a lot of evergreen growing
[1:43:52] rocks will be laughed together
[1:43:53] a little boy with a croc hair cut little
[1:43:56] panty waist buttons up here
[1:43:58] and his feet your stock is pulled up
[1:44:00] high you'll have brown eyes they'll be
[1:44:02] turned back you'll be killed in an
[1:44:04] automobile accident
[1:44:05] but you lay your hands up on him and
[1:44:06] you'll come back to life
[1:44:08] there was right on there daily
[1:44:11] [Music]
[1:44:14] just waiting to work i said this boy is
[1:44:17] alive in a couple of minutes
[1:44:18] now that i'm a false prophet running out
[1:44:20] of finland but if he is on
[1:44:22] your faces and repent amen i said death
[1:44:26] you can't hold him
[1:44:27] i call him for his spirit according to
[1:44:29] the word of god in the name of jesus
[1:44:32] christ
[1:44:37] god says so there it is now that's
[1:44:40] that's
[1:44:41] god speaking in this day through vision
[1:44:45] but this if that vision was contrary to
[1:44:48] this
[1:44:48] that would be wrong this is more than
[1:44:51] division
[1:44:52] if any vision is contrary to the word
[1:44:54] leave it alone
[1:44:56] of god god don't contradict his own word
[1:44:58] so if this word told you something and
[1:45:00] you can have the same confidence
[1:45:02] that's what's going to happen there's
[1:45:04] nothing
[1:45:05] if it says they shall lay hands upon the
[1:45:07] sick and they shall recover
[1:45:09] a brother if faith that perfect faith
[1:45:11] got a hold of that
[1:45:12] you when you passed by this prayer line
[1:45:14] you'd be jumping and shouting
[1:45:16] when you're left here it's over and it's
[1:45:18] over it's
[1:45:19] all over it's finished if you had a
[1:45:21] request in your heart and believe
[1:45:22] that when that prayer was made for that
[1:45:24] it was going to be answered there is
[1:45:26] nothing you it's because that's what's
[1:45:27] going to happen like the woman
[1:45:29] was a blood issue jesus had perfect
[1:45:32] faith
[1:45:33] he had it and he come because he was the
[1:45:35] word
[1:45:36] and you become the word you become the
[1:45:39] word as you receive the word and he
[1:45:41] abides
[1:45:41] in my words in you my words which this
[1:45:44] word abides in you then asks what you
[1:45:46] will and it'll be done for you
[1:45:47] see if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:45:50] and don't doubt
[1:45:51] but believe that what you've said then
[1:45:53] you shall have what you said
[1:45:54] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:45:56] what you asked for and you shall have it
[1:45:58] it'll be given to you time space nothing
[1:46:01] else will ever change if you know it's
[1:46:02] done
[1:46:03] it's already it's already over there now
[1:46:06] what
[1:46:07] now and he said to us if you invited me
[1:46:10] in my word and you say john here
[1:46:11] you can ask what you will they'll be
[1:46:13] done then
[1:46:15] recognize your position in the scripture
[1:46:18] as a believer see you've got to
[1:46:22] recognize
[1:46:23] your position as he recognized his
[1:46:25] position
[1:46:26] yes is not it written that
[1:46:29] christ shall come and what all christ
[1:46:31] would do he said
[1:46:32] to theo be senate that morning isn't it
[1:46:34] written in the scriptures
[1:46:35] that they'll have to that he must suffer
[1:46:39] and then be killed and raised the third
[1:46:42] day
[1:46:42] said why are you so slow of
[1:46:44] understanding
[1:46:46] they thought my this man speaks a little
[1:46:48] differently mother man come to find out
[1:46:50] when they got into the end it was him
[1:46:53] eyes was withholding from him see they
[1:46:55] know that he kept laying to that
[1:46:57] scripture and they know it was him
[1:46:59] now you must believe what you asked for
[1:47:02] if you are a believer recognize yourself
[1:47:04] as a believer
[1:47:05] recognize that these things are for you
[1:47:07] if there's condensation in your life
[1:47:08] straighten that first amendment
[1:47:10] amen see if you've got condemnation
[1:47:12] you're uh
[1:47:13] or you might have oral robertson and a
[1:47:16] dozen more people who have faith to come
[1:47:17] here and
[1:47:18] pray over you and jump up and down and
[1:47:20] pull on you by the gallons it
[1:47:22] you know it won't move it's not trying
[1:47:26] what falls off from oro's meetings today
[1:47:28] i catch them in the prayer line
[1:47:30] you hear it say you was pretty far
[1:47:32] before a man with dark
[1:47:34] hair kind of big fella big jaws
[1:47:37] or roberts and that was at a certain
[1:47:40] city called
[1:47:41] certain certainty yes that's right see
[1:47:43] he was prayed for by such and such a man
[1:47:45] do you like
[1:47:46] it but here here's your trouble
[1:47:49] go make that thing right
[1:47:53] go out there and confess that sin to
[1:47:54] your husband to your wife
[1:47:56] don't do this thing it'll never do you
[1:47:59] any good no matter who you pray for so
[1:48:01] you make that right
[1:48:02] condemnations in your hearts god will
[1:48:04] not come into that heart condemn
[1:48:07] god don't dwell in that you've got to
[1:48:09] make it right then when you do
[1:48:11] you must have faith if everything's
[1:48:13] right you must have faith and believe it
[1:48:16] don't be afraid in the book of job it
[1:48:19] said here
[1:48:20] job feared and what he feared it
[1:48:23] actually happened
[1:48:24] right amen what brought it his fear
[1:48:28] that's what made it happen his faith
[1:48:31] would have kept him from us
[1:48:33] but his fear brought him brother to him
[1:48:36] he was scared to go to heaven
[1:48:38] and it did happen now if he knows it
[1:48:40] wouldn't happen it wouldn't happen
[1:48:42] see what it means if you're afraid when
[1:48:44] you come by the prayer line
[1:48:46] maybe i just haven't got the faith
[1:48:47] sufficient it'll never happen don't
[1:48:48] worry
[1:48:50] but if you know what's going to happen
[1:48:51] it'll happen
[1:48:54] it's a substance or something job had a
[1:48:56] fear that these things have come up on
[1:48:57] it and they did
[1:48:58] if you have a fear that your disease is
[1:49:00] going to leave you or won't lead it it
[1:49:02] won't
[1:49:03] if you have a faith that it will you ask
[1:49:05] any medical doctor
[1:49:06] the first thing he'll try to get you to
[1:49:08] do is have confidence and the medicine
[1:49:10] he's given you
[1:49:11] if you haven't got no confidence in it
[1:49:13] you better leave it alone
[1:49:15] right sure what is it that
[1:49:18] it's faith that does the healing hey man
[1:49:21] his faith
[1:49:22] all the time peter he was doing all
[1:49:25] right so he got scared
[1:49:28] the word told him he could walk on the
[1:49:30] water he's scared first his daughter was
[1:49:32] a ghost
[1:49:34] and he said lord if it did you bit me
[1:49:36] comfy on the water
[1:49:37] he said come on no that's just the same
[1:49:40] as james 5 14.
[1:49:42] then in march 16th the same god said it
[1:49:45] said come on and so you started walking
[1:49:48] you got all right got down and out of
[1:49:50] the ship started walking off there's a
[1:49:51] storm on scene you know great
[1:49:53] white cap waves figures these hills

[1:49:56] a foam breaking on top of them terrific
[1:49:58] maybe 15 20 feet
[1:50:00] home white caps breaking that was a
[1:50:02] terrific thing for him to ask if it be
[1:50:04] you lord
[1:50:05] see it look like they look like a shadow
[1:50:07] or spirit
[1:50:09] he said if it's you fit me come to me on
[1:50:11] the water jesus said come on
[1:50:13] and he stepped down said it's the lord i
[1:50:15] just want but when he got his eyes on
[1:50:17] the wave
[1:50:18] he got scared what time in his mind
[1:50:21] first thing he i'm going to walk because
[1:50:24] the word said for me the woman
[1:50:26] and the next thing he looked at is um
[1:50:29] well he looked at his symptoms
[1:50:31] he looked out there and seen how big
[1:50:33] that wave was and he got scared and when
[1:50:35] he did
[1:50:36] and he went see what he feared happened
[1:50:41] what he believed happened when he
[1:50:43] believed he could walk you off
[1:50:45] when he believed got scared in his
[1:50:46] belief then his substance left
[1:50:48] him see he still professed
[1:50:52] his face but he didn't have the
[1:50:53] substance
[1:50:55] right on the top of that white captain
[1:50:56] what do i don't show you
[1:50:58] if he had this perfect face anybody
[1:51:01] didn't have it
[1:51:02] he thought he did he did it first he's
[1:51:04] willing to venture right out
[1:51:06] why the lord told me to do it it's got
[1:51:08] to happen so he just stepped right down
[1:51:09] the board they saw him yeah man
[1:51:12] he never thought about the the the ways
[1:51:15] how contrary there was he never got that
[1:51:17] in his mind
[1:51:19] and when you get to thinking well now
[1:51:20] wait you know i've been sick so long i
[1:51:23] got stopped you just might not go back
[1:51:25] to the boat
[1:51:27] but when you quit thinking about that
[1:51:30] abraham considered is not his own body
[1:51:33] now dead
[1:51:35] neither the dead is the stairs move he
[1:51:38] didn't think about that didn't consider
[1:51:40] it
[1:51:40] it wasn't even brought into
[1:51:43] understanding he didn't even consider it
[1:51:44] all
[1:51:45] he just considered what god said and he
[1:51:48] went on
[1:51:49] as long as peter did that he walked but
[1:51:52] jesus
[1:51:52] lived in a world that no one knowed
[1:51:55] about
[1:51:57] he was an odd person he lived in a world
[1:52:00] of perfect faith
[1:52:02] in the perfect god in which you are if
[1:52:05] we live in a perfect faith
[1:52:07] of a christian or what we are we'll be a
[1:52:10] mystic to the world
[1:52:12] yeah the people wouldn't understand you
[1:52:14] just walk
[1:52:15] in the spirit what the spirit said you
[1:52:18] would do
[1:52:19] what it forbids you not do then the
[1:52:21] people get to say
[1:52:23] there'll be a mystic person to them
[1:52:27] that's the way it is all believers there
[1:52:29] are mystics that people don't understand
[1:52:31] because they live in a world to
[1:52:33] themselves
[1:52:34] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[1:52:36] could touch
[1:52:37] the disciples couldn't understand him
[1:52:39] when he spoke to them
[1:52:40] they say this and they say well you
[1:52:43] talking riddles
[1:52:45] we don't understand this how can this be
[1:52:47] see there wasn't in the world that he
[1:52:49] lived in
[1:52:50] they couldn't understand it nobody could
[1:52:53] understand him
[1:52:53] and so when a man lives by faith
[1:52:57] and walks by faith on his substance base
[1:53:00] he is isolated from the entire world
[1:53:03] and becomes a new creature in christ
[1:53:06] there now you're getting into bride
[1:53:08] material
[1:53:11] you're getting into rapture condition
[1:53:13] now that means for each one of us
[1:53:16] amen not just the pastors yeah
[1:53:19] zeke is trustees that means for the
[1:53:21] laity every
[1:53:22] every individual walks in a world
[1:53:25] god alone you're baptized into this
[1:53:28] kingdom
[1:53:29] and there's nobody in there but you and
[1:53:31] god he gives the orders and you packing
[1:53:34] out
[1:53:35] whatever he says is not a shadow of
[1:53:37] doubt nowhere you walk right on
[1:53:39] the lord says this there's nobody in the
[1:53:41] world can talk you out of it
[1:53:44] now you're coming into perfect faith
[1:53:47] perfect perfection that cannot fail that
[1:53:50] faith
[1:53:51] never fails yes
[1:53:54] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[1:53:57] faith
[1:53:58] and so is it now with those who have
[1:53:59] perfect faith are mystic to others
[1:54:02] we are taught to resist the devil and he
[1:54:05] will flee from
[1:54:07] now to resist just just simply turning
[1:54:10] down
[1:54:12] and just resisting that is just walk
[1:54:14] away from it
[1:54:15] god said a certain thing no matter what
[1:54:16] he's trying to tell you you don't even
[1:54:18] listen to him
[1:54:19] yeah your ears are death and anything
[1:54:21] else but what the spirits say
[1:54:23] see he that has an ear that listens
[1:54:26] see what the spirit says and through the
[1:54:28] churches the one that's got the
[1:54:30] listening pose
[1:54:31] that catches what the spirit says to the
[1:54:32] churches see
[1:54:34] what satan says well now this can't that
[1:54:36] don't have nothing well if you teach
[1:54:37] that the denomination
[1:54:39] that's going to have nothing to do with
[1:54:40] it it goes right on just a thing
[1:54:42] he that has an ear let him hear what the
[1:54:44] spirit says to the churches
[1:54:47] you know when the bible is always
[1:54:48] constantly that the him that has
[1:54:51] faith that he that has an ear to hear
[1:54:53] let him hear
[1:54:55] he that has wisdom they count the
[1:54:57] numbers of the beast
[1:54:59] all these different things he that has
[1:55:01] let him tell it to the rest of them that
[1:55:03] they might have
[1:55:04] and that's about faith we're talking
[1:55:06] about now faith that you've got to have
[1:55:09] that
[1:55:09] perfect faith that faith that says yes
[1:55:13] there's nothing to say no when god says
[1:55:16] yes
[1:55:17] he says yes yes yes nothing else can
[1:55:20] ever take it from me
[1:55:22] with his perfect faith he was very
[1:55:24] strange
[1:55:25] and the devil didn't stay around him
[1:55:27] very long we got it lesson this morning
[1:55:29] when he come with that great big a
[1:55:31] fluffle of
[1:55:32] intellectual conception he fluffled up
[1:55:35] against jesus saying when he economy
[1:55:36] found out he hit a ten thousand vote
[1:55:38] line
[1:55:39] and brought him right back again yes sir
[1:55:42] he said it is written
[1:55:44] man shall not live by bread alone
[1:55:47] you gotta shock them become a little
[1:55:49] softer the next time one said are you a
[1:55:51] great man you yourself up here to
[1:55:52] be somebody
[1:55:54] to get behind me amen oh my
[1:55:57] all you meant i shall not tempt the lord
[1:55:59] thy god
[1:56:00] see he proved himself unto
[1:56:03] satan that he was the lord god amen or
[1:56:06] it
[1:56:07] is written thou shall not hint now if
[1:56:09] satan didn't know that that was the lord
[1:56:11] god he said wait a minute you're not
[1:56:12] that person
[1:56:13] but he knows better than to the benefit
[1:56:14] of jesus do you know what
[1:56:16] ground to stand on he says thou shalt
[1:56:19] not
[1:56:19] tempt the lord thy god and that's who he
[1:56:22] was
[1:56:22] amen and satan knows better than to say
[1:56:25] that because jesus works had already
[1:56:26] proved that he was
[1:56:28] the lord thy god notice now
[1:56:31] another perfect faith is a master of all
[1:56:36] circumstances perfect faith masters all
[1:56:39] circumstance
[1:56:40] no matter what it is it masters
[1:56:43] it now just watch when you believe
[1:56:46] anything
[1:56:46] do anything and you got faith in what
[1:56:49] you're doing no matter what the
[1:56:50] circumstances that don't have one thing
[1:56:52] to do with it
[1:56:53] it masters that circumstance if it's in
[1:56:56] a
[1:56:56] a room of sickness and a large reveal
[1:56:59] that this certain thing is going to
[1:57:00] happen
[1:57:00] you just speak it and belong uh does
[1:57:03] that
[1:57:04] just don't ask any questions it's
[1:57:05] already over just keep going
[1:57:07] it masters all circumstances amen well
[1:57:10] if you do this uh sword sword sort of
[1:57:12] that see it already got it mastered
[1:57:15] faith believes that god will work it out
[1:57:16] i don't know how to
[1:57:17] do it but to do it anyhow it masters all
[1:57:20] circumstances
[1:57:21] and faith and love is relation
[1:57:25] because you can't have faith unless
[1:57:27] you've got love
[1:57:28] because your faith is in a god who is
[1:57:31] the very essence of love
[1:57:33] yes faith and love works together you're
[1:57:36] just like a young couple
[1:57:38] you take a young man young woman and
[1:57:40] they
[1:57:41] fall in love with one another and as
[1:57:43] they go along and begin to know one
[1:57:44] another more
[1:57:45] their heart just being defeated is one
[1:57:47] see they're
[1:57:49] yes they're not husband and wife but
[1:57:51] their love binds them together and they
[1:57:53] have confidence in one another
[1:57:55] now if they really love one another
[1:57:57] really love
[1:57:59] and you know that this girl loves you
[1:58:01] and
[1:58:02] and she knows that you love her you've
[1:58:04] got confidence faith in one another
[1:58:07] right you got faith in one if you didn't
[1:58:10] you better not marry
[1:58:11] me notice you gotta have faith and you
[1:58:14] separate them about one extreme south
[1:58:16] one extreme north they steal that love
[1:58:18] beachbody no matter where they're at
[1:58:20] they're just as true to one another as
[1:58:22] they can be because they
[1:58:23] love one another and if you love the law
[1:58:28] it's not trying to dodge hell but you
[1:58:31] love the law then you have faith in god
[1:58:34] and if you love him like a
[1:58:38] a young girl just happened here in
[1:58:39] louisville not long ago
[1:58:41] a woman she was uh she's been a
[1:58:43] christian for many years
[1:58:45] but her husband had just fell in love
[1:58:47] she fell over this man
[1:58:49] he had been a christian a couple of
[1:58:50] years and so
[1:58:52] they got married they loved had
[1:58:53] confidence in one another
[1:58:55] and they got married and so the woman
[1:58:58] said to the man says
[1:58:59] hubby it must be hard on you you're just
[1:59:02] a young christian
[1:59:03] you've had so much to go through with
[1:59:04] drinking what what that you've had so
[1:59:06] much to go through with and said
[1:59:07] i know you're about to be tempted
[1:59:09] awfully hard and said i want you to know
[1:59:11] one thing now
[1:59:12] now if you happen to fall if you happen
[1:59:15] to to fall into temptation
[1:59:17] and as overcome don't stay away from
[1:59:19] home
[1:59:20] you come on back you come right here
[1:59:22] because i'm gonna be right here waiting
[1:59:24] for you
[1:59:25] and i'm gonna help you praise you again
[1:59:28] until you get victory
[1:59:29] i'm going to stay with you because when
[1:59:31] i married you
[1:59:32] i married you because i loved you
[1:59:37] no matter what you are i still love you
[1:59:40] two days after that he was eating his
[1:59:42] lunch with the fellas down the border
[1:59:43] room
[1:59:44] he was telling them about so now how
[1:59:46] could a man ever do anything wrong when
[1:59:48] somebody told you like that
[1:59:50] there you are how could you trespass
[1:59:52] that confidence
[1:59:54] and when we were sinners
[1:59:57] alienated without god in the world and
[2:00:00] that
[2:00:01] muck of mothers have talked about this
[2:00:02] morning god
[2:00:04] come to us am i
[2:00:08] god sought you you never sought god
[2:00:11] no man can come to me except the father
[2:00:13] draws you first
[2:00:14] and god came down in that muck what you
[2:00:18] were
[2:00:19] and sought you out and brought you out
[2:00:24] about to create a perfect love
[2:00:28] look what you are and look what you are
[2:00:33] what did that somebody that loves you
[2:00:37] can't you have faith in what he's
[2:00:39] promised today
[2:00:42] real genuine love will create a
[2:00:44] confidence in his word
[2:00:46] he caught me when i was nothing i was
[2:00:48] still nothing but i'm in his hands
[2:00:51] he called me and he loved me when i was
[2:00:54] unlovable he loved you when he was
[2:00:56] unlovable right
[2:00:57] but he changed you yeah it's like the
[2:00:59] colored sister said that time in her
[2:01:01] testimony
[2:01:02] she said i'm not what i ought to be
[2:01:05] and i'm not what i want to be then i'm
[2:01:08] not what i used to be
[2:01:10] she knows she'd come somewhere something
[2:01:13] happened
[2:01:14] and that's the way it is if god
[2:01:17] when i was an alien from him so wealthy
[2:01:20] till he stood down to get me and pick me
[2:01:22] up
[2:01:23] that gives me confidence that he wants
[2:01:24] to use me
[2:01:26] he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen
[2:01:30] something
[2:01:30] in me he sees something in you he had a
[2:01:33] reason to save you
[2:01:35] look at the people don't save today look
[2:01:37] at the million secret tucked besides you
[2:01:40] but it's up to you amen
[2:01:44] to take your place amen you're in god's
[2:01:47] economy
[2:01:48] no one can do it that's his love to you
[2:01:51] that won't your love reach right back to
[2:01:53] him
[2:01:54] and there's a love path no matter what
[2:01:57] the situation is it's circumstances
[2:02:00] it's governed by this love and creates
[2:02:03] faith
[2:02:04] that god loves you and you love god and
[2:02:07] you love one another
[2:02:08] and that brings to faith all right then
[2:02:11] it can't
[2:02:12] it can't keep from uh bringing out just
[2:02:15] exactly what god promised
[2:02:17] it would do now watch perfect faith
[2:02:20] is pure just as pure as love is
[2:02:23] see now when you love somebody and you
[2:02:26] got
[2:02:27] you love your husband or you love your
[2:02:29] wife now there's no need of anybody
[2:02:31] telling you you
[2:02:32] don't do it because you do do it
[2:02:36] and you know you do it
[2:02:39] now if i ask you how can you you prove
[2:02:43] you do it
[2:02:44] well i've proven by the way i live to
[2:02:46] him see
[2:02:48] i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal
[2:02:50] honest husband
[2:02:52] and that proves to me that i and i love
[2:02:54] my wife or i love my husband
[2:02:56] see that your life proves what you are
[2:02:59] the same thing
[2:03:00] christianity does amen see your faith
[2:03:03] you have confidence in one another is
[2:03:05] pure
[2:03:06] and it's something real that you can't
[2:03:08] show it to somebody else yet you got it
[2:03:11] and your actions prove it and when you
[2:03:13] got pure
[2:03:15] unadulterated faith like your love is to
[2:03:18] your companion
[2:03:20] then you prove it by the way you act
[2:03:24] you ain't complaining no more you know
[2:03:26] it's done
[2:03:28] you just walk along no matter what the
[2:03:29] thing looks like what anybody else says
[2:03:31] you know what's happening
[2:03:33] you know that it's finished just as well
[2:03:35] as you know you love your husband
[2:03:37] as well as you know you love see love
[2:03:39] and faith has to go together their kin
[2:03:41] folks
[2:03:42] they love love produces faith
[2:03:46] when satan tempts us we are to resist
[2:03:49] him
[2:03:50] in a perfect faith in a perfect word
[2:03:53] like jesus did
[2:03:54] the word of god is perfect we'll have
[2:03:56] perfect faith
[2:03:57] in this perfect word and resist fate i
[2:03:59] will hurry just as quick as we can
[2:04:01] by his faith is
[2:04:05] what in his word we conquer
[2:04:09] we can conquer anything both death hell
[2:04:11] and the great we know that god
[2:04:14] is god that perfect faith in god's
[2:04:16] perfect word
[2:04:18] he conquered everything that he come in
[2:04:19] contact with
[2:04:21] death cannot even stand in his presence
[2:04:24] sickness cannot stand in his presence
[2:04:26] flowing from him is like rivers of
[2:04:28] virtue going out constantly
[2:04:30] virtue going from his garments these
[2:04:32] people laying in his shadow
[2:04:34] step put their finger on his garments
[2:04:36] with him when that woman down there then
[2:04:38] everybody wanted to touch his garment
[2:04:40] because they seen that there was virtue
[2:04:42] going from the conflict
[2:04:43] though like river there he was walking
[2:04:46] walking in a world with perfect faith
[2:04:49] because he was
[2:04:51] the word and now if he abides me
[2:04:54] through him he brought the word to you
[2:04:57] and my words abide in you
[2:04:58] then walk in the same kind of way
[2:05:01] virtues flowing from
[2:05:03] the rivers of god's fountains of
[2:05:05] blessings just going on to the people
[2:05:07] see what i mean and you're not bluffing
[2:05:10] it
[2:05:10] you're not imagining it it's actually
[2:05:12] taking place
[2:05:14] and you see it if you just imagine that
[2:05:16] don't do any good
[2:05:17] but if it's really there it really
[2:05:19] happened now notice
[2:05:20] see by when he stood and he said if you
[2:05:24] destroy this body
[2:05:25] this temple i'll raise it up again in
[2:05:28] three days
[2:05:29] why he was just as satisfying to do that
[2:05:32] because the scripture
[2:05:33] says that he won't do it the messiah
[2:05:37] i'll not leave his soul in hell neither
[2:05:39] suffer my holy one is decoration
[2:05:41] a prophet when the word comes to
[2:05:44] has said that would happen and he know
[2:05:47] he was that person
[2:05:49] and when the jesus himself said the
[2:05:52] prayer of faith shall save the sick
[2:05:55] or they shall lay hands over sick and
[2:05:57] they shall recover
[2:05:58] if you must have the same perfect
[2:06:01] confidence
[2:06:02] that my hands are they know me i shall
[2:06:05] recover
[2:06:06] ever because he said so he said you
[2:06:09] destroy this body
[2:06:11] and i'll raise it up because he know he
[2:06:12] was a messiah
[2:06:14] i'll not suffer my holy one's
[2:06:15] decoruption he knew he was the only one
[2:06:18] neither i'll leave his soul in hell he
[2:06:20] hit me he know
[2:06:21] he'd do it he had confidence
[2:06:25] that he was out of conquerable death in
[2:06:28] hell
[2:06:29] said destroy it if you wish to i'll
[2:06:32] raise it back again in three days
[2:06:33] oh my i have power to lay my life down
[2:06:36] or i have power to take it up again
[2:06:39] he knows who he was you're a christian
[2:06:42] you have
[2:06:42] rights to any redemptive blessing that
[2:06:44] jesus died for you

[2:09:34] around and see him bring another one
[2:09:36] just exactly like it
[2:09:38] because you said so and turn over here

[2:10:21] bad

[2:10:26] friends
[2:10:27] as your pastor that's just as powerful
[2:10:30] as it was when joshua stopped the sun
[2:10:32] amen because the sun was already there
[2:10:34] the elements was moving and he stopped
[2:10:36] the movement but then he brought
[2:10:38] something there that wasn't there amen
[2:10:41] he created
[2:10:42] amen until god should be acquainted with
[2:10:45] the god that could take the steps of the
[2:10:47] earth
[2:10:48] [Music]
[2:10:50] to life again and
[2:10:53] after i've been planted in the grave oh

[2:10:57] there it is my faith looks up to thee
[2:11:00] thou lamb of calvary amen if you say and
[2:11:03] don't doubt but believe that what you
[2:11:05] said
[2:11:05] you shall have what you say
[2:11:09] believed as it happened david in the
[2:11:12] psalm
[2:11:12] spoke of him and with it
[2:11:16] he took his power and he ministered to
[2:11:19] others
[2:11:20] not only did he keep it to himself but
[2:11:22] he ministered to others by
[2:11:24] also saved others even to the uttermost
[2:11:28] and he can do the same thing now and
[2:11:30] promise the same faith
[2:11:32] to the believers in his word in
[2:11:35] john john 14 12. he said so mark 16
[2:11:39] and also in mark 11 23 we just read now
[2:11:42] what
[2:11:43] now he has
[2:11:47] appeared to us in the same form that he
[2:11:50] did to them
[2:11:51] in the old testament and in the same as
[2:11:54] it is in the new testament
[2:11:57] and assured by the same word the same
[2:12:00] christ
[2:12:02] and i declare to you that christ is the
[2:12:05] holy ghost
[2:12:07] the word christ means the anointed one
[2:12:11] just the person that's anointed that is
[2:12:14] the christ
[2:12:15] the anointed one how many knows that's
[2:12:18] true that's good
[2:12:19] the anointing one there would be a man
[2:12:21] that would be anointed
[2:12:23] anointed with what the bible said in
[2:12:26] acts 2
[2:12:27] that jesus of nazareth a man approved of
[2:12:29] god
[2:12:30] anointed with the holy ghost went about
[2:12:32] us and done great works and things
[2:12:34] that god manifested through that he was
[2:12:38] in this man and now we become
[2:12:41] anointed with that same spirit
[2:12:46] anointing messiah
[2:12:49] messiahs of the last days
[2:12:52] to shine forth the resurrection of jesus
[2:12:55] christ
[2:12:56] to show that he is not dead but in the
[2:13:00] form of the holy ghost
[2:13:01] he's in his people moving among his
[2:13:05] bride with a love affair to her
[2:13:08] pouring out into her himself they are
[2:13:11] becoming one
[2:13:14] already
[2:13:16] the same sign promised by the same god
[2:13:19] in the same word is making this same
[2:13:22] manifestation
[2:13:25] there's nothing left for us to do but
[2:13:27] please i believe
[2:13:30] and that creates a perfect faith amen
[2:13:33] just think how how
[2:13:34] numb we are just think of that just a
[2:13:38] minute
[2:13:38] now let's see has he done all things
[2:13:41] well
[2:13:42] has he ever told us anything about what
[2:13:45] happened just exactly the way he said
[2:13:48] hasn't he performed and has a great
[2:13:50] feeling of fire been among us and done
[2:13:52] just exactly like he promised to do
[2:13:55] heaven we still have besides
[2:13:56] things it has been predicted what would
[2:13:58] happen go right there and have it even
[2:14:00] in
[2:14:00] the papers and magazines pack it right
[2:14:02] back and show it once told you months
[2:14:04] before it happened
[2:14:06] has it done just exactly the way he did
[2:14:08] in the old testament in the new
[2:14:09] testament
[2:14:11] exactly the same one amen the same holy
[2:14:15] spirit
[2:14:15] comes as discerner and the word of god
[2:14:18] which is quicker and sharper than a true
[2:14:20] a story
[2:14:20] a discerner of the thoughts and intents
[2:14:23] of the heart
[2:14:24] isn't that right is that the same god
[2:14:27] now that's same wrong it's not a
[2:14:29] stranger or somewhere else he's here
[2:14:32] he sure does this to create a perfect
[2:14:34] faith
[2:14:35] our feeling is right now
[2:14:38] i know that his spirit is here i know
[2:14:42] that he knows all things amen
[2:14:46] and i know he forced to do something
[2:14:49] he's been
[2:14:50] doing something to create this
[2:14:52] perspective
[2:14:54] in the people yeah are we going to walk
[2:14:57] into eternity like it was in the days of
[2:14:59] noah are they so
[2:15:00] safe are we going to come like
[2:15:04] lot but free out of sodom
[2:15:07] while we go to comrades in the days of
[2:15:09] john the baptist with six believers
[2:15:12] let us believe now for his worst is
[2:15:16] perfect
[2:15:17] that are manifested daily and perfectly
[2:15:19] before us
[2:15:20] showing that he is the word the word
[2:15:24] hebrews the fourth chapter says the word
[2:15:26] of god is sharper than any two aged
[2:15:28] source
[2:15:29] of uh uh even a deserter
[2:15:32] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[2:15:35] think of that the word of god is that
[2:15:39] a desire of the intent of the heart
[2:15:42] for the word of god is quick and
[2:15:46] powerful
[2:15:47] and sharper than any two-day sword
[2:15:49] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[2:15:51] of the soul and our spirit
[2:15:54] and other joints and of the mind and
[2:15:58] is a deserter of the thoughts and
[2:16:00] intents of the heart
[2:16:02] the
[2:16:07] a word operating in human flesh
[2:16:11] by physical science by material science
[2:16:14] by
[2:16:14] scriptural science practically bring to
[2:16:18] you
[2:16:18] a perfect face for a perfect rapture
[2:16:22] why can't we look at it not a
[2:16:25] mystic the devil has plenty of things in
[2:16:28] the world before you try to
[2:16:29] make it keep you from believing
[2:16:37] bible says rise and shake yourself
[2:16:42] pinch yourself his spirit is
[2:16:45] he knows you you've got one thing to do
[2:16:49] and that's
[2:16:50] to believe it to accept it
[2:16:54] and you know you believe that yeah
[2:16:59] he knows what's in you he knows what you
[2:17:01] are
[2:17:02] he knows what you're desiring he knows
[2:17:05] what you have need of
[2:17:12] jim
[2:17:20] praise the lord
[2:17:27] amen he goes directly into our prayer
[2:17:31] line
[2:17:32] amen amen of course he
[2:17:35] knowing what he had to do but yet he
[2:17:37] took so long to preach this
[2:17:39] and say and so he went right on after he
[2:17:43] he said he knows what you have need of
[2:17:45] and then
[2:17:47] he spoke to somebody in the audience he
[2:17:49] said jim
[2:17:50] do you believe he knows about that baby
[2:17:53] amen that was that jim had there amen
[2:17:57] and then he went on to pray for the
[2:17:58] others and discerning the thoughts and
[2:18:00] intents of the heart
[2:18:02] but but again it's a perfect faith
[2:18:06] amen it's a perfect faith and what is a
[2:18:08] perfect faith perfect faith believes god
[2:18:11] amen prairie faith follows the
[2:18:13] leadership of god
[2:18:14] is not getting this revelation that
[2:18:16] revelation in you did you wonder about
[2:18:18] this and wonder about that
[2:18:20] no no you just i pray grace god give us
[2:18:23] that kind of a faith
[2:18:25] amen by the grace of god said well god
[2:18:28] says
[2:18:28] what god reveals to us we're going to do
[2:18:30] it we'll go on we're living for god amen
[2:18:32] we're going to give the glory to god
[2:18:34] give the glory to jesus amen not be
[2:18:36] ashamed of it
[2:18:37] that's what faith is all about amen but
[2:18:40] but
[2:18:41] you're saved by grace through faith
[2:18:43] that's right
[2:18:44] it's not not grace only but grace
[2:18:46] through faith and what is faith
[2:18:48] well faith is god revealing to you is
[2:18:51] word
[2:18:52] is will in the word amen and it's
[2:18:56] faith is also a revelation that is not
[2:18:58] me that lives as christ that liveth in
[2:19:00] me that's tremendous
[2:19:01] oh my what yeah christ lives in me and
[2:19:04] you you got yourself turned over to him
[2:19:06] to his leadership you're spiritual
[2:19:08] you've got a spiritual anointing a
[2:19:09] spiritual life
[2:19:11] in your heart and in your soul by the
[2:19:12] grace of god
[2:19:14] but of course there's not many with that
[2:19:16] in these last days
[2:19:18] not by any means because the bible tells
[2:19:20] us
[2:19:21] again when he comes will he find such
[2:19:23] faith
[2:19:24] will he find people with faith you know
[2:19:27] not intellectual faith but spiritual
[2:19:29] holy ghost it's it's you and god in you
[2:19:32] you and christ in you in your heart oh
[2:19:34] praise the lord you walk in the spirit
[2:19:36] you live in the spirit
[2:19:37] you walk by faith you live by faith
[2:19:40] you're totally under his control
[2:19:42] and whatever he says you're going to do
[2:19:44] when and how and where and so on
[2:19:46] lord not my will thine be done see as i
[2:19:49] said
[2:19:50] the the the situation and and
[2:19:54] when the bridegroom came to the end of
[2:19:55] his ministry
[2:19:57] that look what was the end of his
[2:19:58] ministry surrender
[2:20:01] he surrendered amen he surrendered all
[2:20:04] and he pray
[2:20:05] you know knowing what was going to
[2:20:06] happen and knowing what god what what
[2:20:09] we thus saith the lord this has got to
[2:20:11] happen that's got to happen
[2:20:12] and just think and again there's a
[2:20:15] painting yes right here
[2:20:16] of christ in the garden and i know
[2:20:19] there's i
[2:20:20] noticed something there just uh this
[2:20:22] past week i think that i have not
[2:20:24] never noticed about that picture before
[2:20:27] and uh it was what it was was jesus we
[2:20:31] all look at jesus we see jesus
[2:20:33] and he's praying but then i drew near
[2:20:36] another copy of that picture somewhere
[2:20:38] and and oh i said who's that
[2:20:41] and there's there's three or four or
[2:20:43] five behind jesus
[2:20:45] and into into the dark cloud there and
[2:20:47] it's the disciples sleeping
[2:20:50] oh yes the disciples sleeping amen so
[2:20:53] brother and sister but jesus was
[2:20:55] he wasn't sleeping in a sense he was
[2:20:57] having a nightmare
[2:20:59] you know because he was facing what he
[2:21:01] knew that he had come to the earth to
[2:21:03] to do and that was to lay down his life
[2:21:05] and he had he's going to be beaten
[2:21:07] with many stripes and and he had to shed
[2:21:10] his blood
[2:21:11] and like i said there's a lot of
[2:21:12] paintings concerning the the crucifixion
[2:21:15] and there are very few paintings that
[2:21:17] ever show you
[2:21:18] you know the the amount of blood that
[2:21:20] jesus shed
[2:21:22] ever exactly and again that's like when
[2:21:26] the soldiers went and they and they
[2:21:27] broke the legs of the other
[2:21:29] of the other two thieves or that were on
[2:21:31] their their crosses
[2:21:32] and he broke their legs and why so as to
[2:21:36] so that they would drop down and and
[2:21:38] they would lose their breath
[2:21:39] and wouldn't be able to breathe and
[2:21:41] they'd die but when they got to jesus
[2:21:44] jesus was already dead death was already
[2:21:47] taken over he says he's dead
[2:21:48] so they knew they didn't have to break
[2:21:50] his legs so
[2:21:52] a man didn't have to do that at all but
[2:21:54] what they did was with the spear
[2:21:56] they drove it into his side and out came
[2:21:58] his blood
[2:22:00] amen brother hallelujah he had already
[2:22:03] shed blood
[2:22:04] when he was beaten with many stripes he
[2:22:06] was he he was he shed a lot of blood
[2:22:09] but then on the cross and they and they
[2:22:11] put that spear in his side
[2:22:13] and the blood all came out came out came
[2:22:15] out and uh
[2:22:16] went down and the power of god said
[2:22:18] where did that blood go
[2:22:20] he said we're down to the earth he said
[2:22:22] because he redeemed
[2:22:23] us and the earth because there's a new a
[2:22:26] new heaven and a
[2:22:27] new earth a man that that we're heading
[2:22:30] to
[2:22:30] but when he was coming to that place in
[2:22:32] that position
[2:22:34] he come on he was really desperate oh
[2:22:37] yeah
[2:22:38] really desperate knowing that what he
[2:22:39] was going to suffer
[2:22:41] in flesh and not only not just the
[2:22:43] suffering in the flesh
[2:22:45] on the cross but what was going to
[2:22:46] happen after
[2:22:48] he was going to meet the devil oh yeah
[2:22:52] and he knew the devil yes the devil was
[2:22:55] back there and he was he walked up and
[2:22:57] down in
[2:22:58] in in the trails and so on
[2:23:01] oh yeah he was he was an angel up there
[2:23:03] with the father
[2:23:05] with christ and jesus knew that
[2:23:08] now when he died and laid down his life
[2:23:10] for us shed all of his blood
[2:23:12] amen when he when he come forth in
[2:23:14] another in the other dimension
[2:23:16] he went down to set the old testament
[2:23:18] saints free
[2:23:20] amen to let them out of the prison by
[2:23:22] the grace of god
[2:23:24] but he had to deal with the devil he had
[2:23:26] to fight with the devil there
[2:23:28] amen so but again he conquered death
[2:23:32] l and the grave and he's given us power
[2:23:35] over the world the flesh
[2:23:36] the devil amen by the grace of god
[2:23:41] so brother are we coming to that place
[2:23:43] that he came to
[2:23:44] oh yeah i believe the bride is going to
[2:23:46] come to that and your prayer
[2:23:48] why it's going to be so desperate when
[2:23:50] you realize the
[2:23:51] the the the day we're living the hour
[2:23:53] we're living
[2:23:54] and then the conditions that we're
[2:23:55] dealing with the unbelief
[2:23:58] oh yeah knowing what why why are we
[2:24:00] seeing all these things around the world
[2:24:02] because the devil has come down with
[2:24:04] great wrath knowing his time is short
[2:24:06] amen so brother sister the devil knows
[2:24:10] that
[2:24:10] so what do we know what what is the
[2:24:13] faith that we have
[2:24:14] what is revealed to us oh yeah well god
[2:24:17] sent the prophet
[2:24:18] amen to forerun the lord the coming of
[2:24:21] the lord amen
[2:24:22] but he come down to be united with his
[2:24:24] bridegroom to take to his bride rather
[2:24:26] to take her into glory in the rapture
[2:24:29] amen
[2:24:30] but i'll tell you this we have a lot of
[2:24:33] unbelief to deal with
[2:24:35] yeah jesus had a lot of unbelief to deal
[2:24:38] with even in his disciples
[2:24:40] we have a lot of unbelief to deal with
[2:24:42] either around many believers
[2:24:44] but brother could that many of us have
[2:24:47] the faith that the prophet
[2:24:48] was speaking up and these have given our
[2:24:52] turn our lives
[2:24:53] over to the will of god lord i know
[2:24:56] we're living in this hour
[2:24:57] you have proved it i believe it and i'm
[2:25:00] gonna go do what you want me to do
[2:25:02] amen not my will thine be done
[2:25:05] amen by the grace of god so brother
[2:25:09] perfect faith will bring the bride to
[2:25:11] that place
[2:25:12] perfect faith brought jesus to that
[2:25:14] place praying faith is
[2:25:16] bringing us to that place and what is
[2:25:18] the faith it is a revelation of what god
[2:25:20] is doing amen so god gave us that
[2:25:24] perfect faith
[2:25:25] a revelation of what he done good but
[2:25:28] now it's a revelation of what he's
[2:25:30] doing he did that to open the word
[2:25:34] and brother the results of the word is
[2:25:37] in you and in me
[2:25:38] we believe it amen praise the lord and
[2:25:41] brother he's pointing us to the
[2:25:42] resurrection
[2:25:43] pointing us to the rapture look up amen
[2:25:46] it is the hour of our redemption of our
[2:25:49] bodies
[2:25:51] got to believe it we're not religious
[2:25:53] not religiously like most people became
[2:25:56] in the lutherans and methods and all the
[2:25:57] other churches the pentecostals
[2:25:59] and they just became religious oh we're
[2:26:02] pentecostals we believe in the holy
[2:26:04] ghost
[2:26:04] we believe in the gifts and so on and
[2:26:06] they just go on
[2:26:07] and it became it became a doctrine one
[2:26:10] time it was an experience
[2:26:12] every day every day they're living the
[2:26:15] experience
[2:26:16] amen of that faith but then they went
[2:26:19] from a spiritual faith to an
[2:26:20] intellectual faith
[2:26:21] amen just knowledge in their heads and
[2:26:24] the message is becoming that way today
[2:26:26] to a lot of believers oh yeah god did
[2:26:28] this god did that
[2:26:29] and now we're we're just getting into
[2:26:32] the word and waiting for him to
[2:26:34] we that he waiting for him to do this

[2:27:18] rapture
[2:27:19] lord i pray i'm not going to come under
[2:27:21] the influence of that
[2:27:23] that lack of faith spirit where it says
[2:27:26] that will he find that faith when he
[2:27:28] comes
[2:27:29] amen because he's going to need he's
[2:27:31] going to need that kind of faith
[2:27:33] what is it there's a belief in the whole
[2:27:35] body of revealed truth
[2:27:37] amen so will he find that in you and in
[2:27:40] me
[2:27:40] because if we believe in the whole body
[2:27:42] of revealed truth we're going to oh yeah
[2:27:44] no problem we'll we'll bring the
[2:27:46] resurrection we'll bring the rapture
[2:27:49] praise the lord as jesus did praise the
[2:27:52] lord
[2:27:52] and yeah he brought did he bring a
[2:27:54] resurrection yeah he did
[2:27:56] bring a rapture he did because the old
[2:27:59] testament saints
[2:28:00] came up with him when he rose from the
[2:28:03] dead they rose from the dead
[2:28:04] and the bible says the old testament
[2:28:06] saints they went into the city and
[2:28:08] appeared unto many
[2:28:09] but on that day when jesus
[2:28:13] was there with the angels and in the
[2:28:14] cloud that he went up they went up
[2:28:17] because it's right there in the book of
[2:28:19] psalms open up
[2:28:20] the doors open up the gates and so on
[2:28:23] they said
[2:28:24] who is the king of glory he's the lord
[2:28:25] of lord lord of lords
[2:28:28] amen mighty in battle he won the victory
[2:28:31] they said open up and let us in amen
[2:28:34] they opened up
[2:28:35] and jesus went in with the old testament
[2:28:37] saints
[2:28:38] but now it's new testament by the grace
[2:28:40] of god
[2:28:42] amen amen amen but
[2:28:46] please don't take it for granted because
[2:28:49] i
[2:28:49] i know that god is challenging us amen
[2:28:53] with what he says will i find faith when
[2:28:56] i come
[2:28:57] is he finding the faith in you is he
[2:29:00] finding faith in me so that we live
[2:29:02] by faith not by sight amen
[2:29:06] brother again
[2:29:10] the scriptures have warned us and we're
[2:29:13] dealing with this as well
[2:29:15] yeah why
[2:29:19] why why does the world come to that
[2:29:22] place
[2:29:23] of like lacking faith amen
[2:29:27] this is why i'll read it for you again
[2:29:31] take it serious concerning perfect faith
[2:29:34] and let's make our calling and election
[2:29:36] sure
[2:29:37] how do we do that make sure you got
[2:29:38] perfect faith amen by the grace of god
[2:29:42] and again let me highlight the the issue
[2:29:44] to you and like i've said before
[2:29:48] and i i did explain that to a church
[2:29:50] that i ministered to in
[2:29:51] in ontario one time a number of years
[2:29:53] ago
[2:29:54] amen and uh they were
[2:29:57] they were impressed by it
[2:30:01] they they thought that oh amazing yeah
[2:30:04] and i said it's like reading your bible
[2:30:05] like reading the message
[2:30:07] and i said if you notice my books i said
[2:30:09] there
[2:30:10] there's there's some there underlined i
[2:30:13] said with a pen
[2:30:14] i said when i first read the book that's
[2:30:15] what i did i said then i went through
[2:30:18] and then i highlighted it maybe in
[2:30:20] orange not orange
[2:30:21] but with a different color here oh yeah
[2:30:23] might have been green
[2:30:25] i highlighted something green oh yeah
[2:30:26] that struck me and then i read it again
[2:30:29] and i highlighted something yellow and i
[2:30:32] said
[2:30:32] maybe the last time i read it i led it
[2:30:34] in orange
[2:30:35] so i said every time you read a message
[2:30:37] you might something might strike you
[2:30:40] that didn't strike you when you read it
[2:30:41] first time oh yeah
[2:30:44] not only this message of course any
[2:30:46] message has the same thing with the
[2:30:47] bible
[2:30:48] that i would go through the bible and i
[2:30:50] know some people don't do it
[2:30:52] but and i usually have the
[2:30:56] excuse me i can find it there for you oh
[2:30:58] yeah a ruler
[2:31:00] and that ruler is in my bible i keep it
[2:31:03] in my bible
[2:31:04] so that when i read the bible again
[2:31:05] maybe there's something going to strike
[2:31:07] me
[2:31:07] that didn't strike me before and i'm
[2:31:09] going to i'll underline that
[2:31:11] yeah so i use the ruler to underline it
[2:31:14] by the grace of god
[2:31:15] amen and sometimes i re i use the blue
[2:31:19] pen sometimes i use a red one
[2:31:21] and so on by the grace of god why
[2:31:24] because this
[2:31:25] just strikes me now whereas it didn't
[2:31:27] strike me before
[2:31:28] amen because it wasn't ordained to
[2:31:30] strike me before
[2:31:32] and brother concerning what god has done
[2:31:34] i believe brother is ordained to strike
[2:31:36] us not the generation that the prophet
[2:31:39] preached to
[2:31:40] in 1963 or 65 no no but it's to this
[2:31:44] generation
[2:31:45] as i said that our brother jonathan
[2:31:47] highlighted where the prophet of god has
[2:31:49] been gone for
[2:31:49] 55 years yeah and and i've been praying
[2:31:53] to the lord how much longer
[2:31:54] i said will it be before the rapture
[2:31:57] because the prophet of god did say
[2:31:59] that you young preachers are ordained to
[2:32:02] take this message on to the coming of
[2:32:04] the lord
[2:32:05] amen the resurrection the rapture he
[2:32:07] said you
[2:32:08] you young ministers he said you've got
[2:32:10] to fill our shoes
[2:32:12] he was referring to issues and brother
[2:32:14] neville and brother you know
[2:32:16] brother neville was that the brother we
[2:32:18] hear responding
[2:32:20] yeah yeah brother brother neville the
[2:32:24] pastor of
[2:32:24] tabernacle oh yeah and when our brother
[2:32:28] neville was
[2:32:28] was was going on to be with the lord
[2:32:31] uh there was a brother that went to
[2:32:34] visit him
[2:32:35] and he said brother neville he said do
[2:32:37] you have anything
[2:32:38] to tell us he said that i want that you
[2:32:41] would like me to share he said with with
[2:32:43] the believers
[2:32:44] and he said yes and then he said brother
[2:32:47] said what
[2:32:48] what is it brother and he said listen go
[2:32:50] tell them
[2:32:51] he said that what they're looking for is
[2:32:53] already here
[2:32:55] he says not coming it's here amen and
[2:32:58] get them
[2:32:59] to look up amen and then the lord took
[2:33:02] our brother
[2:33:03] home amen so i pray the grace of god
[2:33:07] that now brother what the problem of god
[2:33:08] was preaching in perfect faith
[2:33:11] works his faith expressed and
[2:33:15] the rapture amen by the grace of god
[2:33:18] that brother

[2:33:26] to to give to us in these last last days

[2:34:24] that we're not going to mist miss the
[2:34:27] revelation

[2:34:43] said you want an
[2:34:44] evangelistic ministry you want the
[2:34:46] evangelist to come

[2:34:55] this people look for look for the
[2:34:57] ministry like like the evangelist
[2:34:59] and preach like an evangelist and so on

[2:35:47] thank god for what he's done
[2:35:49] and get all excited because of what he's
[2:35:51] done but
[2:35:53] fail to get what he's doing amen

[2:36:03] amen oh
[2:36:08] it's in you don't have to turn to it
[2:36:10] i'll read it before we close
[2:36:13] it's in second timothy chapter 3 and it
[2:36:16] says this
[2:36:17] no also
[2:36:23] that in the last days
[2:36:27] perilous times shall come
[2:36:31] amen and we're experiencing perilous
[2:36:34] times
[2:36:35] for men shall be lovers of their own
[2:36:38] selves you're more caught up with
[2:36:40] yourself
[2:36:41] than we are caught up with the body of
[2:36:43] christ
[2:36:44] amen they're lovers of their own selves
[2:36:49] amen and they're covetous they want more
[2:36:53] and more and more of what we can get in
[2:36:55] this world and in this life
[2:36:58] and boasters oh yeah
[2:37:02] proud blasphemers
[2:37:07] disobedient to parents
[2:37:10] yeah the relationship's not there like
[2:37:11] used to be between parents and children
[2:37:14] amen and it says unthankful
[2:37:20] and that is the generation we're
[2:37:21] experiencing for sure
[2:37:23] and unholy
[2:37:27] i'll hold it because do not live in the
[2:37:28] life of christ it might be religious
[2:37:31] life but not christ
[2:37:33] and he says without natural affection
[2:37:37] having that love is a perfect faith that
[2:37:40] works by love
[2:37:41] amen grace of god and at one time that
[2:37:45] was
[2:37:46] oh it's so natural uh such a natural
[2:37:49] thing back then
[2:37:49] years ago among among the lutherans
[2:37:52] among the methodists
[2:37:53] and the old-fashioned salvation army and
[2:37:56] the old-fashioned pentecostal the law
[2:37:59] that was there they love one another
[2:38:00] they fellowship one another that's all
[2:38:02] they wanted
[2:38:03] amen and they why was it it was the love
[2:38:06] of god
[2:38:07] loving one another love of god in you
[2:38:10] amen and your love for god amen
[2:38:13] be amen because god was in your brother
[2:38:15] god was in your sister
[2:38:17] amen but now he said they're unthankful
[2:38:20] unholy
[2:38:21] without natural affection and truth
[2:38:24] breakers
[2:38:25] yeah people there's not no repeat the
[2:38:29] the generation today that they're not
[2:38:32] normal
[2:38:32] they don't like normal don't talk normal
[2:38:35] don't react normal
[2:38:37] no it's the influence of the devil
[2:38:42] that's without natural affection truth
[2:38:44] breakers
[2:38:45] false accusers incontinent fierce
[2:38:49] despisers of those that are good no
[2:38:52] wonder he says
[2:38:53] when he comes when he finds faith yeah
[2:38:57] perilous times traitors oh yeah
[2:39:01] heady high-minded yeah
[2:39:05] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[2:39:08] god
[2:39:09] didn't say they didn't love god but
[2:39:11] their love was a pleasure more
[2:39:13] than lovers of god oh yeah he's talking
[2:39:16] about professing believers professing
[2:39:18] christians
[2:39:19] but he said instead of the spiritual
[2:39:21] taking control the holy ghost
[2:39:23] is the devil the world amen
[2:39:26] and it says having a form of godliness
[2:39:30] amen the world we're living it
[2:39:34] a form of godliness but denying the
[2:39:37] power thereof
[2:39:38] from such turn away
[2:39:42] yeah avoid those things don't get don't
[2:39:44] get caught up with those spirits
[2:39:46] even though they're religious they make
[2:39:49] sure it's a right spirit and a right
[2:39:51] attitude
[2:39:52] right motives right objectives by the
[2:39:54] grace of god
[2:39:56] that god's in control that they're again
[2:39:59] not just religious but you're spiritual
[2:40:03] amen lots of believers are religious but
[2:40:06] not many spiritual
[2:40:07] amen having a form of godliness
[2:40:12] but denying the power thereof is not
[2:40:15] what god wants you to do
[2:40:16] what they want to do god do this god do
[2:40:19] that
[2:40:20] he said from such turn away
[2:40:23] and for of this sword are they which
[2:40:25] crept into houses
[2:40:26] and led captive silly women laid with
[2:40:29] sins
[2:40:30] he said led away with diverse lusts
[2:40:34] ever learning and never able to come to
[2:40:37] the knowledge of the truth
[2:40:39] amen amazing you're learning the message
[2:40:43] but never ever getting to the knowledge
[2:40:44] of the truth
[2:40:47] oh yeah we know they're learning too
[2:40:48] they're intellectual
[2:40:50] but what about the message god help us
[2:40:55] so he said as janice and chambers
[2:40:57] withstood moses so do these
[2:40:59] also resist the truth men are corrupt
[2:41:02] minds
[2:41:02] reprobate concerning the faith
[2:41:06] concerning the faith that reprobates
[2:41:09] god help us to focus on the faith
[2:41:12] that pleases god amen
[2:41:16] but they shall proceed no further for
[2:41:19] their follies shall be manifest unto all
[2:41:21] men
[2:41:22] as theirs also was amen
[2:41:25] the grace of god be with us amen
[2:41:29] but paul said again thou hast fully

[2:42:07] our lives and it is to bring up the
[2:42:09] faith that pleases him and you and me
[2:42:11] but the faith that's going to take us on

[2:42:31] amen not my will father thine be done
[2:42:35] amen just to ask your
[2:42:38] grace of course to be with and be in
[2:42:41] prayer for brother
[2:42:42] earl ellsworth and uh
[2:42:45] when he returns again he will be here
[2:42:48] maybe for two or three weeks because
[2:42:51] he's going to have
[2:42:52] uh treatment for his cancer
[2:42:58] every day so we will have to take him to
[2:43:02] the hospital
[2:43:03] and for his treatment then bring him
[2:43:05] back to
[2:43:06] my home again and he seemed like he
[2:43:10] would like to stay with us again
[2:43:12] and he said he enjoys it with us and he
[2:43:14] feels at home with us
[2:43:16] so we pray the grace of god to bless him
[2:43:18] and the grace of god to
[2:43:20] be with us and to give us the strength
[2:43:22] we need the wisdom we need
[2:43:24] so pray grace as our brother goes
[2:43:27] through these treatments for the cancer
[2:43:29] that they they say is in his voice box
[2:43:33] and of course it's it's a difficult
[2:43:34] situation because
[2:43:36] uh it's very difficult to talk to our
[2:43:39] brother
[2:43:40] and for him to talk to us his brother is
[2:43:43] his voice is very
[2:43:45] very very low and
[2:43:48] so even when he was here before a short
[2:43:52] time ago
[2:43:53] that sometimes i would maybe try to keep
[2:43:56] conversation
[2:43:57] reduced down so as not to imp impress
[2:44:01] our brother to talk and talk and talk
[2:44:03] but i'm sure he doesn't mind doing it
[2:44:06] you know
[2:44:06] but again i would try to keep it down
[2:44:08] because of the stress that he would put
[2:44:10] on his voice box
[2:44:12] so that's where apparently the cancer is
[2:44:14] is in the voice box
[2:44:16] and we pray the grace of god to bless
[2:44:18] the treatment
[2:44:19] amen so and again praying grace that the
[2:44:23] lord will
[2:44:24] uh increase our faith and even as the
[2:44:27] brother goes for treatment
[2:44:29] then he'll go trusting the lord amen
[2:44:32] the grace of god be with him and also
[2:44:35] sister violet
[2:44:36] his wife and his brother
[2:44:40] sibling brother did call us and uh
[2:44:44] and expressed our aries appreciation for
[2:44:48] for what we're doing and the help that
[2:44:49] we're giving the family
[2:44:51] and so on so we pray god of god's grace
[2:44:54] to his family
[2:44:56] amen and of course again brother
[2:44:59] earlsworth
[2:45:00] i've known him now for well
[2:45:04] since 65 or 66 1966.
[2:45:08] that's when i first came to the word and
[2:45:10] our brother ellsworth was part of the
[2:45:12] message way back then
[2:45:14] and it's amazing that the son
[2:45:17] the son who now lives with him in in
[2:45:20] carmenville
[2:45:21] he was just a young boy back then i
[2:45:24] remember meeting him
[2:45:26] at brother manuel's parsonage
[2:45:29] home in bishop falls so i pray the grace
[2:45:33] of god to their son
[2:45:35] amen and the conviction of the holy
[2:45:36] ghost amen
[2:45:39] praise the lord so the lord be with us
[2:45:43] and also to remind
[2:45:47] i trust our brother jonathan that's
[2:45:49] online that he will be ministering for
[2:45:50] us on
[2:45:52] on wednesday i'll ask our brother to
[2:45:54] minister for us amen
[2:45:56] and to understand too that our brother
[2:45:58] is
[2:45:59] is a ministering brother okay and
[2:46:02] we've been discussing this situation and
[2:46:05] concerning
[2:46:06] uh being recognized maybe by the
[2:46:08] government as a minister
[2:46:10] well so if if like we
[2:46:13] myself and the deacons that came forward
[2:46:15] and we prayed with
[2:46:16] for him and with him and also for sister
[2:46:19] blanc as well
[2:46:20] so uh that's recognizing the ministry in
[2:46:24] our brother
[2:46:26] amen we don't need the we don't need the
[2:46:27] government's recognition
[2:46:30] no it's it's the ministry of the church
[2:46:33] by the grace of god but he does he does
[2:46:36] need
[2:46:36] a certain recognition by the government
[2:46:39] to perform
[2:46:39] certain things such as a marriage you
[2:46:42] know he
[2:46:43] you can't uh administers can't
[2:46:46] to perform a marriage unless he's
[2:46:49] recognized by the government
[2:46:50] and he's got he got the permission from
[2:46:52] the government to perform
[2:46:54] marriages and so on so i pray and one
[2:46:57] time we we had to have that do
[2:46:59] to dedicate children but we don't have
[2:47:00] to have it now
[2:47:02] one time we had to fill out papers and
[2:47:04] send it to government
[2:47:06] even for baby dedication but not not
[2:47:08] anymore
[2:47:09] and now that the responsibility to
[2:47:12] announce those things
[2:47:13] is is given turned over to the doctors
[2:47:17] and the hospitals that they they gotta
[2:47:19] send that to the government
[2:47:21] amen so keep in prayer for our brother
[2:47:24] jonathan
[2:47:25] as the lord uses him to to help us and
[2:47:27] be with us and encourage us
[2:47:29] amen through his ministry amen
