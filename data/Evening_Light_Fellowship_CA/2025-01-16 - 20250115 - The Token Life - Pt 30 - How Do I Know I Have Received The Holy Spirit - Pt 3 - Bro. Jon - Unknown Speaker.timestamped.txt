[44:44] take this forward tonight John 16:13
[44:48] says how be it he when he the spirit of
[44:51] Truth has come he will guide you into
[44:53] all Truth for he shall not speak of
[44:56] himself but what's whatever he shall
[44:57] hear that shall he speak and he will
[45:00] show you things to come amen God bless
[45:03] you you can have your seats and we're
[45:04] continuing our series on the Holy Ghost
[45:06] taking a third service on really the
[45:08] question how do I know I have received
[45:10] the Holy Spirit and last service I
[45:13] believe we've anchored that the constant
[45:14] evidence of the holy spirit in a
[45:16] believer's life is is what Jesus
[45:19] declared here and it's that you would
[45:20] know you would come into all the truth
[45:23] the holy spirit will lead you into the
[45:25] truth and so the evidence of the Holy
[45:27] spirit in in our life is when we have
[45:29] heard the word we have received the word
[45:32] we have we have applied the word and now
[45:35] at the end the big picture is you become
[45:38] one with the word that's really what
[45:40] we're talking about amen it's it's not
[45:41] that we have become one necessarily
[45:43] today we don't see the full evidence of
[45:45] it I believe we are if you've been
[45:47] sealed by the Holy Spirit you and Christ
[45:49] are one but now he's got to bring the
[45:50] rest of this into subjection and that's
[45:52] really the revealing of the word in
[45:54] flesh once more but it's for the word of
[45:56] our day it's not just the word in
[45:57] general people don't understand that so
[45:59] much today in in the nominal Christian
[46:01] World they just look at the Bible as the
[46:03] Bible but the simple fact is Noah's
[46:05] message isn't our message Moses message
[46:07] isn't our message it's there for
[46:09] admonition for correction for teaching
[46:11] and training and Doctrine and all these
[46:13] things but remember the word is the
[46:15] thoughts of God it's the plan of God
[46:17] it's the purpose of God and so we can
[46:19] find there's a place in scripture that's
[46:21] specifically for us amen it's for this
[46:23] age it's for this season it's for this
[46:25] church not this church body it's the the
[46:27] Church of of Christ the body of Christ
[46:30] the bride and so we have to find our
[46:32] place and step into that fulfillment
[46:34] because you'll find in the word as we go
[46:36] along and I'm sure you know this already
[46:38] there's parts of the word that other
[46:40] churches can't do other ages couldn't do
[46:42] it it was there they could read it they
[46:45] could have even a comprehension of it
[46:47] but yet they couldn't produce that word
[46:48] in their life why because it wasn't the
[46:50] time and season for it but now is the
[46:52] time and season we're in the the final
[46:55] age we're in the final portion of the
[46:57] Gentile dispensation of the plan of God
[46:59] for this time for this people and so
[47:01] everything that he's written about this
[47:03] church is going to be fulfilled in us
[47:06] that's where you're sitting tonight as
[47:07] you are sitting at the Apex your back to
[47:10] the restored full word it says in the in
[47:12] Revelation he says I am Alpha and Omega
[47:15] I'm the beginning and the end I was in
[47:17] that first church age and now I'm in the
[47:19] last Church age in my full revealing and
[47:21] it's in a bride each time it's in a it's
[47:23] in a body of Believers it's in the
[47:25] called out ones the church so we know
[47:28] the evidence is receiving the word for
[47:30] your day but now the question becomes
[47:32] and this is this is the way things can
[47:33] work every question kind of develops
[47:36] another question so you say well how do
[47:38] I know if I've truly received the word
[47:40] well that's what we're going to talk
[47:41] about today amen we're going to look at
[47:43] that but this is one of those things
[47:45] where it's kind of like when our kids
[47:47] come to us as they get older and they
[47:49] say how do I know that I'm in
[47:52] love and what is the answer you always
[47:55] give you'll know when you
[47:58] know and this is kind of one of those
[48:00] things but I don't think that that's
[48:02] going to satisfy our young people as
[48:04] they're looking forward perhaps the to
[48:06] having a spouse and moving into marriage
[48:08] life and these sorts of things they they
[48:10] want to say but yeah Mom Dad come on you
[48:12] got to be able to give me some sort of
[48:14] something that'll help me to understand
[48:16] well one thing I want to say is this is
[48:18] that it's the same thing that you have
[48:19] in your walk with Christ and that it
[48:21] will be a revelation it'll be a
[48:24] revelation that cannot be given to you
[48:26] somebody if somebody convinces you that
[48:28] you are in love then somebody will
[48:29] convince you that you're not in love and
[48:31] the thing is if you're not settled in
[48:33] your heart on these things that as you
[48:35] move into marriage what will happen is
[48:37] times will get tough that person will be
[48:39] less
[48:41] lovable and that's when your revelation
[48:43] of your love is going to be tested
[48:46] because when they are unlovable do you
[48:48] still love them when they're grumpy when
[48:51] they're
[48:52] rude when they gain weight
[48:57] when their when their their attitude
[48:58] changes when hard times come when
[49:00] sickness hits do you still love them
[49:03] when they get frustrated do you still
[49:04] love them that's going to be when it's
[49:06] tested and so as you need that same
[49:08] Revelation for your marriage so you need
[49:10] one for God you've got to have a
[49:13] revelation that God has sealed your soul
[49:16] that you have received Christ inside of
[49:18] you and that you are on your way you are
[49:20] sealed to the day of your Redemption and
[49:22] now you're in a journey that will take
[49:23] you into eternity with him that's what
[49:25] you have to settle and I'll tell you
[49:27] this that revelation of your love for
[49:29] your spouse you know I Blan and I were
[49:31] talking about this a while back but what
[49:34] happens is as you get further in you
[49:36] realize that God has made you and God
[49:38] has brought you to a person for purpose
[49:41] and things you didn't know were going to
[49:43] be needed are there when you need them
[49:47] and things you thought you needed are
[49:49] going to disappear As you move further
[49:51] and further into your relationship with
[49:53] God and so you'll see this is very much
[49:55] the same with our walk with God I know I
[49:57] keep saying that but when your new birth
[49:59] comes and you receive the holy spirit
[50:02] it's just the start of the journey and
[50:05] so you cannot walk into it thinking that
[50:07] you're going to be just like our elders
[50:09] that have been serving the lord for 90
[50:11] years it doesn't work that way you get
[50:15] the Holy Spirit but you're not a mature
[50:17] believer because you have received the
[50:19] Holy Spirit that's not the way that it
[50:21] works amen so don't young people set you
[50:24] up for an expectation young men don't
[50:26] think that you're going to act like
[50:27] brother Gerald or brother Mark or
[50:29] brother Bob or Brother David because now
[50:31] you have the Holy Spirit you won't you
[50:32] might have areas of your life that God
[50:34] will quickly work on that will bring you
[50:36] to a very quick maturity CU it's needful
[50:39] but there are other areas where you may
[50:41] still be a child for 15 20 30 40
[50:45] years why because it's a journey and
[50:47] this journey is to develop our character
[50:50] and our nature to reflect that of
[50:53] Christ watch what go what watch what
[50:55] Paul would say to the Corinthians he
[50:57] says for as the body is one and have
[51:00] many members and all the members of that
[51:02] one body being many are one body so also
[51:06] is
[51:06] Christ for by one Spirit are we all
[51:09] baptized into one body whether we be
[51:12] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[51:14] free and have been all made to drink
[51:17] into one spirit for the body is not one
[51:20] member but many so I want you to see
[51:22] something here The only commonality
[51:25] between you and your brothers and
[51:27] sisters is the spirit you are completely
[51:30] different than I am and I am completely
[51:32] different than you are and you are
[51:34] different from each other but there's
[51:36] one thing that binds us together and
[51:38] it's the new birth it's the spirit of
[51:40] Christ in you that's why we can have
[51:42] somebody that comes from Africa from
[51:44] India from China wherever it is and if
[51:47] they have that same Spirit then we are
[51:49] one and if they don't have that same
[51:52] Spirit it doesn't matter how good their
[51:53] Doctrine is how good they talk how
[51:55] nicely they act how well they dress how
[51:57] much they match up they will not be a
[51:59] part of the body because the spirit's
[52:01] not there but in that we can have
[52:04] comfort that we're different we don't
[52:07] need two of me in this church we need
[52:10] one cuz I won't get along with
[52:14] myself but I can get along with brother
[52:16] M because he's different than
[52:17] me and God has placed us into that body
[52:21] by that Spirit but watch what he says
[52:23] now he he jumps into I'll jump into
[52:25] second Corinthians he says therefore If
[52:28] any man be in Christ how do we get in
[52:31] Christ how do we get into the body by
[52:32] one spirit so here's our evidence If any
[52:35] man have that same
[52:37] Spirit he is a new
[52:41] creature this is how we know we've
[52:43] received it old things are passed away
[52:46] behold all things are become new so this
[52:50] is a changing that happens inside of
[52:52] this brother Ram says this way he says
[52:53] the holy spirit is a personal
[52:57] experience of the new birth regeneration
[53:00] making a new creature in Christ so it is
[53:03] not a camp experience it's not a church
[53:05] experience it's not a it's not something
[53:08] that you have based on what goes on
[53:10] around you but it is a personal lasting
[53:15] effective experience amen it is
[53:18] something you are not something you did
[53:22] or something you got it is a changing of
[53:25] you of of who you literally are brother
[53:28] Bram says it in another way he says what
[53:29] is the new birth then it is the
[53:32] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[53:35] you not you joined a church you shook a
[53:38] hand you did something different you
[53:40] said a Creed you promised to live by a
[53:42] code of rules but Christ the Bible he is
[53:45] the word that was revealed to you and no
[53:47] matter what anybody says what takes
[53:51] place it's
[53:53] Christ he says Pastor priest whatever
[53:56] ever it might be it's Christ in you that
[53:59] is the Revelation that the church was
[54:02] built upon amen so doesn't matter what
[54:05] else is going on your Revelation is not
[54:08] about what's going on what other people
[54:10] say it is personal to you and your Soul
[54:13] Is Anchored you're settled you've
[54:15] entered into rest you are assured of
[54:18] what has happened to you and it's on the
[54:20] basis that you have become a new
[54:23] creature a new creation in Christ
[54:26] brother R continues now he says that's
[54:28] the way with people who profess Christ
[54:31] many of them look like Christians try to
[54:35] act like Christians but you've got to
[54:37] have Christ on the inside of you which
[54:40] is what the word made manifest or it'll
[54:44] never mature into a real Bible believing
[54:48] Christian remember what I said this is a
[54:50] journey you are you start this journey
[54:53] as you receive the Holy Spirit and then
[54:55] you are just a baby in Christ but if you
[54:59] don't have him you will try and you will
[55:01] act and you will mimic and you will do
[55:03] what everybody else around you is doing
[55:06] but that won't produce Christ it takes
[55:08] Christ to produce Christ on the
[55:11] inside and what happens is then when you
[55:13] hit hard times you hit struggles or
[55:15] offenses or hurts or Co things that are
[55:18] are going to impact your bank account
[55:20] you back away why because it's not
[55:23] Christ inside of you and so you cannot
[55:25] mature you cannot not move on he says
[55:28] it's Christ in you sorry it'll never
[55:30] mature into a real Bible believing
[55:33] Christian it'll always be a
[55:35] denominational something it cannot live
[55:37] because there's no life in it to live
[55:41] now remember what what Paul said he says
[55:43] old things have passed away all things
[55:45] are become new if we were to look around
[55:48] and look at something that the old has
[55:50] passed away and then something else has
[55:52] become new what does it look like if if
[55:55] a building were to go away and then a
[55:57] new one be raised up in its place what
[55:59] does that look like well it's got to rot
[56:02] and it's got to break down and it's got
[56:03] to crumble and then it's going to start
[56:06] to look really bad and it might even
[56:08] smell a bit funny and then there's going
[56:10] to come the Machinery to come in and
[56:11] tear it all apart there's a lot of noise
[56:13] there's dust there's confusion and then
[56:16] after that there's a building up of that
[56:17] house again and it's still noise and
[56:20] it's still a mess but when it's all said
[56:22] and done everything's cleaned out and
[56:24] you've got a house there that replaced
[56:25] the one that was
[56:27] there in other words it's a mess
[56:30] becoming a new creation is a mess if you
[56:33] look at a tree that dies and a new one
[56:35] comes up in its place it just starts to
[56:37] sayag and it starts to get soft and it
[56:39] starts to get doy as brother Brandon
[56:41] would say and it starts to crumble and
[56:43] rot and there's a smell associated with
[56:45] it but out of all of that comes life and
[56:48] that's the way that this works in this
[56:50] in this so if we're talking about
[56:53] evidences we've said the evidences that
[56:55] you re received the word but how do you
[56:57] know you've received the word one the
[56:59] holy spirit will make a mess of your
[57:00] life absolutely 100% even if you've been
[57:04] raised in a Christian home you still got
[57:07] issues need to be sorted out I don't
[57:08] know if you know this I used to be a
[57:10] young person I used to hide things I
[57:13] used to have things in my heart that
[57:15] people didn't know about I had thoughts
[57:17] I had dreams I had desires I had things
[57:19] I was doing in
[57:21] secret you parents don't think for a
[57:23] second that because you're raising your
[57:25] kids right they don't have issues
[57:27] they've all got issues go to a camp
[57:29] sometime and ask the pastors and the
[57:30] preachers what they come up for prayer
[57:32] for they've all got issues we've all got
[57:34] issues amen so we may be raised the
[57:37] right way and we may not have things
[57:39] that we're actively doing amen but there
[57:42] are still things that need to be changed
[57:44] absolutely 100% amen and what does it do
[57:47] the Holy Spirit comes in and it turns
[57:49] our world upside down it lifts us up and
[57:51] it starts to shake and say let's see
[57:53] what falls
[57:54] out isn't it and guess what it's not
[57:57] always habits sometimes it's attitudes
[57:59] sometimes it's approaches sometimes it's
[58:01] a uh uh just the way that we deal with
[58:04] people whatever it might be and so he
[58:07] comes up and he starts to shake our life
[58:10] and the bad relationships fall out and
[58:12] the bad habits fall out and the bad
[58:14] desires start to fall out and what does
[58:16] he do then he flips us up over again and
[58:19] he starts to put the good relationships
[58:20] in and the good habits and the good
[58:23] desires and all of these different
[58:24] things amen why cuz when life is coming
[58:27] into you it has an effect it changes the
[58:29] environment it changes everything around
[58:31] you as it starts to build you up and
[58:34] when life comes into us by the Holy
[58:35] Spirit he's kicking out the old man and
[58:38] he's putting a new person in there and
[58:40] it's Christ the word that's sitting in
[58:42] our hearts amen that whole that old
[58:44] controlling nature that old worldly
[58:46] person all those things have to be
[58:48] pushed aside so that he can come in
[58:50] there so the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[58:52] one of them is certainly this change
[58:56] if you say I've received the Holy Spirit
[58:58] and you're the same person today as you
[59:00] were yesterday I'm sorry something
[59:02] didn't happen it can't because you're a
[59:05] new creation you're a new creature in
[59:07] Christ amen there's been a Changing of
[59:10] the Guard in your life that means things
[59:12] are going to change you know if you've
[59:14] ever been in a job situation where they
[59:15] changed the
[59:17] boss he always or she always changes
[59:19] something they never leave it the way it
[59:22] is every boss when they come in they
[59:24] change things even if it's going well
[59:27] they think it can be better and so
[59:29] they'll change things guess what the
[59:30] holy spirit's no different when he comes
[59:32] in believe me if he kicks me out which
[59:34] is what he does then there's going to be
[59:36] a new person in charge and things are
[59:38] going to change and we'll see why as we
[59:39] go into the
[59:41] scriptures brother brah says it this way
[59:43] he says well could you
[59:45] imagine a mother giving birth to a baby
[59:47] and not knowing it she'd have to be
[59:49] unconscious not to know it neither can
[59:52] you receive the Holy Ghost without
[59:53] knowing it there's something takes place
[59:56] place in you see there's something that
[59:58] changes you your whole system but watch
[1:00:02] how he clares clarifies this your whole
[1:00:05] spiritual system is made new again not
[1:00:08] your
[1:00:09] flesh after the New Birth your flesh is
[1:00:12] the same stinking carnal broken flawed
[1:00:16] flesh that you have before the New Birth
[1:00:19] remember it's a soul ceiling not a flesh
[1:00:23] ceiling okay he says and you become a
[1:00:26] new creature in Christ as the Bible puts
[1:00:28] it you know it so not our flesh the
[1:00:31] flesh is unregenerated and that's where
[1:00:33] the battle is now is the soul has the
[1:00:36] holy spirit inside of it he's the
[1:00:38] controlling one in our life but our mind
[1:00:41] and our attitudes and our emotions and
[1:00:43] the five senses of our flesh are
[1:00:45] completely unregenerated so don't think
[1:00:48] you don't have the Holy Ghost because
[1:00:50] your flesh is
[1:00:51] uncooperative the fact that it's
[1:00:52] uncooperative means there's a battle
[1:00:54] going on which is one of the best best
[1:00:56] evidences you can have is that the flesh
[1:00:58] is not you're not letting the flesh have
[1:01:00] its way
[1:01:02] okay Paul says it this way he says know
[1:01:04] ye not that so many of us were baptized
[1:01:07] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:01:09] death amen we died with him we were in
[1:01:12] him we die with him from God's Viewpoint
[1:01:14] he says therefore we are buried with him
[1:01:16] by baptism into death that like as
[1:01:20] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[1:01:22] the glory of the father even so we also
[1:01:25] should walk in newness of life so in
[1:01:27] other words if you've received the same
[1:01:29] spirit that Christ did your life
[1:01:31] afterward is different than your life
[1:01:33] was before even if you were raised in a
[1:01:35] Christian home as I said your life is
[1:01:38] different there's a big difference he
[1:01:40] says for if we have been planted
[1:01:42] together in the likeness of his death we
[1:01:44] shall be also in the likeness of his
[1:01:46] resurrection so there is a dying out and
[1:01:48] there's a raising up and that raising up
[1:01:50] is a new creature in Christ he says
[1:01:53] knowing this that our old man is
[1:01:55] crucified IFI with him that the body of
[1:01:58] sin might be destroyed that henceforth
[1:02:03] we should not serve sin now we've we've
[1:02:06] preached many times on what sin is and
[1:02:08] this is something that the nominal world
[1:02:09] doesn't understand because they focus on
[1:02:12] the acts of sin rather than sin itself
[1:02:15] amen but notice we've talked about this
[1:02:17] before in the Garden of Eden Adam and
[1:02:19] Eve did the very same thing and yet one
[1:02:22] of them did Sin and the other one did
[1:02:24] not remember what Paul said to Timothy
[1:02:26] he says Adam was not deceived but the
[1:02:28] woman being deceived was in the
[1:02:31] transgression so in the original sin the
[1:02:34] act that they both did was the same and
[1:02:37] yet it says the woman was in the
[1:02:39] transgression not the
[1:02:41] man what was the difference between Adam
[1:02:43] and Eve their
[1:02:45] faith that's the difference remember the
[1:02:48] woman disbelieved the word of God and we
[1:02:51] know that because she believed the word
[1:02:53] of Satan and so to believe believe his
[1:02:56] word she had to disbelieve the word and
[1:02:58] so she was deceived and her sin was that
[1:03:00] she disbelieved the word of God Adam on
[1:03:03] the other hand knew and believed the
[1:03:06] word of God but he accepted the
[1:03:09] consequences for the sake of his bride
[1:03:13] it was a type of Christ an imperfect
[1:03:14] type but a type nonetheless but he did
[1:03:16] not disbelieve the word he did it to
[1:03:19] save his bride to be with her bride amen
[1:03:22] so Paul comes along now and he says the
[1:03:25] body of sin is destroyed not will be
[1:03:28] destroyed he says it is destroyed amen
[1:03:32] so there's a changing of this natural
[1:03:33] body that's coming but he's not talking
[1:03:35] about this natural body is destroyed he
[1:03:37] says the body of sin is already
[1:03:39] destroyed by the new birth and we're now
[1:03:42] in newness of life so if we look at this
[1:03:43] scripture again and he's talking about
[1:03:45] he says knowing this our old man is
[1:03:47] crucified with him that the body of sin
[1:03:50] the body of unbelief might be destroyed
[1:03:54] that henceforth from now on on we should
[1:03:56] not serve
[1:03:58] unbelief so what is he doing what is
[1:04:00] this new birth doing is it sets our
[1:04:03] faith in the word of God and nothing
[1:04:05] else that's what it's doing amen there's
[1:04:07] more to this idea on the body of sin
[1:04:10] being destroyed we're going to take a
[1:04:11] whole service on it sometime in the
[1:04:12] future Lord willing but really what he's
[1:04:15] focused on here is that you have moved
[1:04:16] from death which is to believe
[1:04:18] everything but the word or only a
[1:04:20] portion of the word to life which is to
[1:04:23] what receive the full word you move from
[1:04:26] a body of sin to a body of life okay
[1:04:30] that's the evidence remember of a child
[1:04:32] of God is that they can hear and accept
[1:04:34] the word of God we read this scripture
[1:04:36] last service where Jesus said he that is
[1:04:38] of God heareth God's words ye therefore
[1:04:40] hear them not because you not of God so
[1:04:42] every child of God every son every
[1:04:44] daughter will accept the word as it
[1:04:47] comes your way and God is gracious he
[1:04:49] knows how to send it God doesn't just
[1:04:51] come up and just punch us between the
[1:04:53] eyes with everything
[1:04:55] that's why we have to have Grace one for
[1:04:57] another God moves at different speeds
[1:05:00] and different areas of life for each and
[1:05:02] every one of us but what he does is he
[1:05:04] gives us the word as we need it and as
[1:05:07] we accept that then he can bring the
[1:05:09] next portion and the next portion and
[1:05:11] the next portion and that's one of the
[1:05:13] other evidences we'll see is that there
[1:05:15] is a continuation in the word of God for
[1:05:17] a child of God that has received the
[1:05:19] holy spirit
[1:05:21] amen but there's more what what's he
[1:05:24] doing with that word he may just be
[1:05:25] getting somebody to the place where they
[1:05:27] realize there's more to being a child of
[1:05:29] God or a Christian than just going to
[1:05:31] church cuz that's what 99.9% of
[1:05:34] Christians think going to church makes
[1:05:36] me a
[1:05:36] Christian and that has so little to do
[1:05:39] with it in the big scheme of things
[1:05:42] Satan's in
[1:05:44] church
[1:05:46] amen the holy spirit is here to elevate
[1:05:48] us from acting like a child of God to
[1:05:52] being a child of God Pharisees were the
[1:05:56] actors remember they were acting
[1:05:59] something they were not there's a big
[1:06:01] difference we've got to go from acting
[1:06:02] like a Christian to becoming Christ big
[1:06:06] difference between those two
[1:06:07] things we read that quote where brother
[1:06:09] Bram said that our whole spiritual
[1:06:11] system is made new and that means it's
[1:06:13] got to be different than the old way and
[1:06:15] our old way was this way Paul said in
[1:06:17] Ephesians 2 he says and you hath he
[1:06:19] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:06:21] and sins this is the body of sin this is
[1:06:23] the body of death wherein in time ye
[1:06:26] walked according to the course of this
[1:06:27] world according to the prince of the
[1:06:29] power of the air the spirit that now
[1:06:31] worketh in the children of
[1:06:34] Disobedience all of us he says among all
[1:06:38] whom also we and I put all in Big Bright
[1:06:42] letters so that every one of us would
[1:06:44] see no matter where we were raised no
[1:06:46] matter how good our parents are how good
[1:06:48] the ministry was how faithful we were in
[1:06:50] church we are still all born this way we
[1:06:54] all had our conversation we all had our
[1:06:57] living our way of life in the lust of
[1:07:00] our flesh fulfilling the desires of the
[1:07:03] Flesh and the mind and were by Nature
[1:07:06] the children of Wrath even as others
[1:07:08] what are the things that are
[1:07:10] unregenerated the Flesh and the spirit
[1:07:12] he gives us a new spirit but that's not
[1:07:14] a regenerated spirit it's a new one but
[1:07:16] it's not his his is the one that we
[1:07:19] need the other one can just get along
[1:07:21] with it brother brandham said but it is
[1:07:23] not a perfect Spirit otherwise we
[1:07:25] wouldn't need his
[1:07:26] Spirit but what's Paul pointing here
[1:07:30] what I'm trying to get across he's
[1:07:31] showing us a contrast he's showing us a
[1:07:34] change in our way of life amen he's
[1:07:37] looking at the old and the new he's
[1:07:39] looking at what was and what is he's
[1:07:41] looking about how it used to be and how
[1:07:43] it is now and we ought to be able to see
[1:07:46] that no matter how old we are we ought
[1:07:47] to be able to see a progression in our
[1:07:49] walk with God as the word becomes a
[1:07:52] greater reality in our life amen
[1:07:55] these things have to be totally
[1:07:57] different what you were and what you are
[1:07:58] need to be completely different because
[1:08:01] we're all born Bound in sin to the lust
[1:08:03] of our
[1:08:04] flesh so if we've got a new system a new
[1:08:07] spiritual system that old one can't
[1:08:08] survive so we know that if we before it
[1:08:11] might have been
[1:08:12] religious but now it has to become
[1:08:15] Christ and we may have been taught well
[1:08:17] and have knowledge but now that's got to
[1:08:19] translate into Revelation because
[1:08:21] revelation will live that's the
[1:08:23] difference between knowledge and
[1:08:24] Revelation revelation has life in it
[1:08:26] knowledge has nothing it's of no good in
[1:08:29] and of itself it needs Faith behind it
[1:08:31] and that's what Revelation is is a faith
[1:08:33] is is a faith is is a revelation of the
[1:08:36] will of God but how do we feed our
[1:08:38] spiritual system there's only two places
[1:08:42] faith and
[1:08:43] doubt the word of God and everything
[1:08:45] else amen if we've got the holy spirit
[1:08:47] it's going to feed on the things of God
[1:08:49] it's going to feed our faith it's going
[1:08:50] to feed our Christian walk because our
[1:08:52] Christian walk is 100% by faith it is
[1:08:55] Faith from start to finish people ask us
[1:08:58] all the time when they're talking to us
[1:09:00] atheists people in the world maybe close
[1:09:02] friends or or or co-workers they say how
[1:09:04] can you believe what you believe by
[1:09:07] faith listen we have evidences we've had
[1:09:09] experiences and all those things but in
[1:09:11] the end it comes down to Faith amen we
[1:09:14] believe because we believe we can't help
[1:09:17] it but how do we get Faith we're going
[1:09:20] to build a bit of a circle this morning
[1:09:22] this evening Paul said this he says so
[1:09:24] then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:09:27] by the word of God so faith comes by
[1:09:29] receiving and applying the word of God
[1:09:32] it's very simple so if you're lacking
[1:09:34] something in your life where are you
[1:09:35] going to go the word of God Amen I I I
[1:09:40] if you're struggling in an area of your
[1:09:41] life where do you go to build up your
[1:09:43] faith if you're facing a trial if you're
[1:09:45] facing great Temptations If You're you
[1:09:47] know you're going to be walking into
[1:09:49] battle you know you're going to need
[1:09:50] Faith then where do you go Church the
[1:09:52] word of God every single time read it
[1:09:55] meditate upon it sing about it listen to
[1:09:58] it whatever way you can absorb it
[1:10:00] whatever way you can get it into your
[1:10:01] system if I can put it that way if
[1:10:03] there's a situation that requires a
[1:10:05] greater Faith get into the word of God
[1:10:07] nothing else will do it nothing else
[1:10:09] will do it you got to get into the word
[1:10:12] of God Peter would write to the to to
[1:10:14] the the Believers all over the the the
[1:10:17] new Gentile regions in places where the
[1:10:19] gospel was just starting and these
[1:10:21] people were not raised in a believing
[1:10:23] home they were not raised serving the
[1:10:24] one true God they had no background for
[1:10:26] these things but the apostles come
[1:10:28] through and they preach the Gospel of
[1:10:30] Jesus Christ and some of these people
[1:10:32] were converted but I want you to watch
[1:10:34] how Peter encourages them in their walk
[1:10:36] these are new Believers just received
[1:10:38] the Holy Spirit watch what Peter says he
[1:10:42] says wherefore laying aside all malice
[1:10:45] and all guile and hypocrisies and envies
[1:10:49] and all evil
[1:10:51] speakings laying aside all your feelings
[1:10:54] and all your false
[1:10:57] words he says as newborn babes why is he
[1:11:00] saying as newborn babes because they are
[1:11:02] newborn babes as newborn babes desire
[1:11:05] the sincere milk of the word that ye may
[1:11:08] grow thereby that word sincere means
[1:11:11] this it means
[1:11:14] reasonable
[1:11:15] unadulterated and pure now we would
[1:11:19] great maybe jump quickly if we're
[1:11:20] talking about the word and say
[1:11:21] unadulterated and pure that makes sense
[1:11:23] but reasonable
[1:11:25] the word is
[1:11:27] reasonable God's Expectations by the
[1:11:29] word are reasonable church because
[1:11:32] you're what a bab in Christ these are
[1:11:35] just young believers new Believers and
[1:11:37] what do you feed a baby milk that's what
[1:11:41] God has provided for a newborn baby
[1:11:43] there's a built-in food delivery system
[1:11:45] to Mama and it's just
[1:11:48] milk but notice she takes the strong
[1:11:51] meat and she converts it into something
[1:11:54] that produces milk but as we grow then
[1:11:57] what do we start to do we start to eat
[1:11:59] solid foods we start to get into the
[1:12:02] steak and the bread and the honey and
[1:12:05] the jam and all the good things
[1:12:09] chocolate we get into the good stuff but
[1:12:11] as a baby you only need one thing and
[1:12:13] that's milk and the milk will do the job
[1:12:17] if you'll just drink the milk what's
[1:12:21] Peter saying he's saying guys don't get
[1:12:24] ahead of where you
[1:12:26] are don't try and be more than you are
[1:12:30] you've just received the Holy Spirit
[1:12:32] he's saying listen you got to lay aside
[1:12:33] your feelings you got to lay aside the
[1:12:35] way you talk and just get into the word
[1:12:38] and let the word do what's reasonable
[1:12:40] for a
[1:12:41] baby get you
[1:12:44] walking cuz if you can't walk you're
[1:12:47] easy pickings just get you where you can
[1:12:50] walk and once you start to walk then you
[1:12:53] can start to run and you can start to
[1:12:54] climb and you can start to get around
[1:12:56] and you'll build your strength and from
[1:12:58] there you'll grow very quickly but you
[1:12:59] got to eat to have strength and the
[1:13:02] strength will help you to move forward
[1:13:03] in your relationship with Christ amen
[1:13:06] he's saying start small don't try and
[1:13:10] be an
[1:13:11] elder at the tender age of 19 you're not
[1:13:15] expected to even Paul told Timothy who
[1:13:19] was a special special special young man
[1:13:21] he says show by your good works
[1:13:25] prove yourself do the basics Timothy so
[1:13:29] that they'll trust you to do the bigger
[1:13:31] stuff don't jump ahead Timothy yes
[1:13:33] you're a special guy we've laid hands on
[1:13:35] you you've got a great gift inside of
[1:13:36] you but you've got to prove yourself in
[1:13:38] the basics before you can ever step up
[1:13:41] into any area of
[1:13:42] responsibility that's why the preaching
[1:13:44] of the word can't always be great
[1:13:46] Mysteries and tremendous depth in the
[1:13:48] word it can't always be great Doctrine
[1:13:50] and theology we've got to be able to
[1:13:52] preach the word to the entire
[1:13:54] congregation
[1:13:56] amen we've got to be able to preach real
[1:13:58] world examples and application we've got
[1:14:00] to be able to preach to people that
[1:14:01] aren't even under conviction or those
[1:14:04] that are under conviction and need the
[1:14:05] Holy Spirit to those that have the Holy
[1:14:07] Spirit and yet are early in their
[1:14:08] Journey all the way up to our elders
[1:14:10] that have received and are really at the
[1:14:12] Apex of their Christian walk by God's
[1:14:14] grace I appreciate how they'll sit here
[1:14:17] in these services and they say the most
[1:14:19] amens even though they've already got
[1:14:20] the Holy Spirit and have had it for
[1:14:22] decades why because they know it's good
[1:14:23] for the rest of us and here's the thing
[1:14:26] they need more of it as
[1:14:28] well absolutely but we'll see as we talk
[1:14:31] about how that transitions amen but you
[1:14:33] know we had a a funny moment in the
[1:14:35] house not funny it was it was very
[1:14:37] tender I I so appreciated it and our
[1:14:39] youngest came up to me and he he had we
[1:14:41] have these visual Bibles it's all
[1:14:43] pictures and he came up and he showed me
[1:14:46] a picture of the crucifixion and he
[1:14:49] said did he
[1:14:51] die and I said yes that's Jesus he died
[1:14:55] there he says why I said he died because
[1:14:59] we were
[1:15:01] bad and he couldn't understand this
[1:15:03] concept about how being bad could have
[1:15:06] such dire impact on a human life and so
[1:15:09] he kept asking
[1:15:11] how why did the Romans do it what and he
[1:15:15] couldn't grasp this idea what is it he's
[1:15:18] trying to catch the
[1:15:19] gospel I couldn't take him into the
[1:15:22] portals of Glory with my revelation of
[1:15:24] what was going on I'm trying to tell him
[1:15:27] when we're bad there's a price that has
[1:15:29] to be paid and he took your spanking so
[1:15:32] you wouldn't have
[1:15:35] to that's why we've got to preach from
[1:15:38] the easy stuff to the highest stuff amen
[1:15:42] and just because we preach the high
[1:15:44] stuff doesn't mean we're all
[1:15:48] there I preach stuff I don't have yet
[1:15:50] church but I preach it because it's in
[1:15:52] the word and I aspire to it I expect it
[1:15:56] I'm looking for it I'm praying for it
[1:15:58] I'm asking for it but we've got to
[1:16:00] preach the whole spectrum of the Gospel
[1:16:03] amen it's why we tend to cringe don't we
[1:16:07] when somebody comes along and they've
[1:16:09] been raised in a Christian home perhaps
[1:16:11] raised in the message I think is the
[1:16:12] worst that we see and they have lofty
[1:16:14] ideas about all sorts of things and yet
[1:16:16] they're lacking the basics of Christian
[1:16:19] Christianity their attitude's wrong
[1:16:21] their Nature's wrong they're still
[1:16:23] selfish they're still egotistical
[1:16:25] whatever it might be however that looks
[1:16:26] amen what happens is they've skipped the
[1:16:28] milk and they went straight to the steak
[1:16:32] and they never developed because their
[1:16:33] digestive system couldn't handle it if
[1:16:35] they'd have gone by way of milk and then
[1:16:37] to solid food they'd have built
[1:16:39] themselves up into a true Christian but
[1:16:41] because they skipped by way of knowledge
[1:16:44] rather than by experience it's just a
[1:16:46] cringe Fest the whole time remember what
[1:16:49] Jesus said to Peter the first thing he
[1:16:51] said was Peter feed my
[1:16:55] Lambs cuz Peter if you don't get them
[1:16:57] from Lambs to sheep it's no good giving
[1:16:59] them sheep food you got to get them from
[1:17:01] the lamb stage to the full grown sheep
[1:17:02] stage and then you can feed them by
[1:17:04] sheep food but at the beginning it's
[1:17:07] just got to be what little lambs take
[1:17:08] and that's going to be milk so he says
[1:17:10] Peter feed my lambs and then he says
[1:17:11] Peter feed my sheep and then he says
[1:17:13] Peter feed my sheep again we've got to
[1:17:15] be able to preach the whole thing you
[1:17:17] know even if you look at Jesus ministry
[1:17:19] brother Grant shared with me a Bible
[1:17:21] study that he did recently it was
[1:17:22] excellent and he was talking about the
[1:17:24] the the three the three polls and we
[1:17:26] know brother Brandon's Ministry had
[1:17:27] three PS sign of the hand discernment
[1:17:30] and then it was the spoken word but if
[1:17:32] you look at Christ Ministry he had the
[1:17:34] same thing and his ministry
[1:17:36] progressed he started with signs and
[1:17:38] wonders and yes he went around preaching
[1:17:41] but the preaching wasn't really the big
[1:17:42] focus it was the manifesting the
[1:17:45] pointing to the word and then after that
[1:17:47] what did he do he started to reveal the
[1:17:50] word and then after the revealing of the
[1:17:52] word was the fulfilling of the word
[1:17:55] signs and wonders revealed word
[1:17:57] fulfilled
[1:17:58] word that's how he progressed through
[1:18:01] these things amen and so we can see that
[1:18:03] in our own lives we don't jump to the
[1:18:05] top of the experience ladder we've got
[1:18:07] to go wrong by wrung by wrong and go
[1:18:10] through the hard work of it because that
[1:18:12] hard work is the dying out that's
[1:18:14] necessary to have the character to
[1:18:16] handle what's coming on the higher rungs
[1:18:18] that's what's going on Amen are you with
[1:18:20] me this evening
[1:18:22] amen so if there you've got the holy
[1:18:24] spirit inside of you it'll create a
[1:18:28] desire for the word like you've never
[1:18:30] had before that's what it does Amen
[1:18:34] remember Paul said Faith cometh by
[1:18:35] hearing reading is good reading is good
[1:18:38] don't stop reading your Bible but
[1:18:40] there's a hearing because hearing is
[1:18:42] what brings understanding and it's based
[1:18:44] on anointed what Ministry it's a
[1:18:47] five-fold ministry that's been appointed
[1:18:49] to bring the church into Perfection into
[1:18:53] full maturity it's not not just hearing
[1:18:55] but it's the understanding and it comes
[1:18:57] by way of that five full ministry from
[1:18:58] your prophets to your Apostles
[1:19:00] evangelists pastors and teachers but
[1:19:02] it's not men speaking it's supposed to
[1:19:04] be the Holy Spirit speaking remember
[1:19:06] when Philip was drawn out to the to the
[1:19:09] the unic in The Chariot and he was
[1:19:11] reading Isaiah and Philip came up to him
[1:19:13] he says do you understand what you're
[1:19:14] reading he says how can I unless a man
[1:19:16] Teach
[1:19:17] me well guess what a man won't do it but
[1:19:21] the Holy Spirit through a man will do it
[1:19:23] that's what it was going to take and it
[1:19:24] took a man full of the Holy Spirit to
[1:19:26] reveal to him what Isaiah was and it
[1:19:28] brought conviction on that man and he
[1:19:30] was saved and baptized that very day
[1:19:32] right there in the water it just took
[1:19:34] the holy spirit in a man you I was
[1:19:36] talking to my wife the other day about
[1:19:37] when I was studying on some things about
[1:19:39] lead DEA a while ago and I came across a
[1:19:42] well-known Baptist preacher and he was
[1:19:45] he was preaching on the leodan church
[1:19:46] Age and what he had to say was factually
[1:19:49] excellent he drove he deep down into the
[1:19:52] geography and the political and the the
[1:19:54] finan I things of those those times and
[1:19:56] his explanation of those scriptures in
[1:19:58] terms of the facts and setting a scene
[1:20:00] of leoa was was far better than anything
[1:20:03] I've ever
[1:20:04] heard but he missed the greatest part of
[1:20:07] that
[1:20:08] scripture he had all the facts he had
[1:20:10] all the ideas he had all the
[1:20:13] understanding but he couldn't see where
[1:20:15] he was in that scripture and so he had
[1:20:18] all of the facts about it but he didn't
[1:20:20] have a revelation of it and so he now is
[1:20:22] sitting there with only a half truth
[1:20:24] stuck in the very thing that he was
[1:20:27] crying out against because he doesn't
[1:20:29] have a revelation of what's going on in
[1:20:31] Le
[1:20:32] oysa amen what was he missing Church the
[1:20:36] holy spirit's
[1:20:38] voice because it's already spoken we've
[1:20:41] already had a vindicative voice amen
[1:20:43] that man is a man I believe with a gift
[1:20:46] absolutely but what he's missing is that
[1:20:48] there is a voice that has already spoken
[1:20:50] to this age and he came and he showed us
[1:20:53] what that verse was all about about what
[1:20:55] that was all about amen I'm so glad God
[1:20:57] sent a Vindicated prophet of Malachi 4
[1:21:00] of Luke 17:30 of Revelation 107 these
[1:21:03] different things all those great
[1:21:04] scriptures and it's a voice that turns
[1:21:06] our hearts back to the
[1:21:08] truth you know it amazes me because
[1:21:10] Jesus we read the scripture in in
[1:21:13] previous Services where he says the Holy
[1:21:15] Spirit even today will guide you into
[1:21:17] all truth when Christ was here in flesh
[1:21:21] form he did not preach the entirety of
[1:21:23] the Gospel
[1:21:25] he understood it he was it but it took
[1:21:28] Paul to come to give us what we have in
[1:21:32] this Old Testament in such great in such
[1:21:34] a great way who was it speaking remember
[1:21:37] what Jesus says when he the holy spirit
[1:21:38] is come he won't speak of himself why
[1:21:41] who was the Holy Spirit speaking Paul
[1:21:44] Paul didn't speak about Paul Paul spoke
[1:21:47] about
[1:21:48] Christ it was the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:21:51] through a man bringing us into all truth
[1:21:54] there is nothing we can add to Paul's
[1:21:55] Message Church brother Ram didn't add a
[1:21:58] thing to it he preached the same gospel
[1:22:01] so the holy spirit let us into all truth
[1:22:03] and that all truth was brought to us by
[1:22:05] a
[1:22:06] man and he preaches that and then what
[1:22:09] happens is now Jesus says you know they
[1:22:11] said we thought that Elijah was supposed
[1:22:13] to come he says he has first come and he
[1:22:16] sure he he will come and restore all
[1:22:20] things he had said when the Holy Spirit
[1:22:23] come he'll lead you into all all truth
[1:22:25] and then at the end he says there's
[1:22:27] going to be somebody that comes and
[1:22:29] he'll take you back into all truth he'll
[1:22:31] restore you into all things what is it
[1:22:34] once again it's the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:22:36] through a prophet to bring us back to
[1:22:39] the word that's what's going on amen he
[1:22:42] said Elias truly shall come and Reve
[1:22:45] restore all things and that's what we've
[1:22:47] got in this age is a prophet that's
[1:22:48] restoring the full word back to us to
[1:22:51] produce Christ the way it was in the
[1:22:53] original age in the First Age so yes the
[1:22:56] holy spirit will speak through men
[1:22:59] Vindicated anointed men men that are
[1:23:02] gifted and called to preach the
[1:23:05] word but I'll tell you this he'll speak
[1:23:08] to you as
[1:23:09] well why because you've heard the
[1:23:13] voice that's what he's doing is he's
[1:23:15] speaking to you he's opening up the word
[1:23:17] because you have shown yourself willing
[1:23:19] to receive the word then he can open up
[1:23:21] your word to you I have my devotions in
[1:23:24] the morning and then I study to preach
[1:23:25] in the evening and I separate those
[1:23:27] things uh intentionally because there's
[1:23:30] things that I need God to deal with me
[1:23:32] in my life
[1:23:33] about and then there's things that he
[1:23:35] needs to deal with the church and that
[1:23:37] includes me as well but there's personal
[1:23:39] and then there's group if I can put it
[1:23:40] that way but there are things that I'm
[1:23:43] reading in the scriptures and it's just
[1:23:45] for me and it doesn't open up because
[1:23:48] I'm a preacher it opens up because I'm a
[1:23:50] Child of God I believe that as you read
[1:23:53] the word with an open heart to hear what
[1:23:56] he says he'll
[1:23:58] speak catch what I'm saying we don't
[1:24:00] read to hear what we think we read to
[1:24:03] catch what he says total difference
[1:24:07] total difference we're not looking for
[1:24:09] Vindication we're looking for leadership
[1:24:12] and Direction by the word of God Amen I
[1:24:14] can't emphasize that enough the nominal
[1:24:16] Christian world has fallen apart because
[1:24:18] they've read what they want and they
[1:24:20] think rather than what the word says and
[1:24:23] they've missed the voice of the Holy
[1:24:25] Spirit to this age it's made a mess of
[1:24:29] things continuing on if so be that ye
[1:24:33] have tasted that the Lord is gracious to
[1:24:35] whom coming as unto a living Stone
[1:24:37] disallowed indeed of men but chosen of
[1:24:40] God and precious ye also so he says as
[1:24:42] Christ was a living Stone living Stone a
[1:24:45] stone that's alive men didn't want it
[1:24:47] they pushed it away but yet it was of
[1:24:49] God it was chosen of God it was precious
[1:24:51] ye also as Lively Stone so in other
[1:24:53] words just like Christ ye are Lively
[1:24:55] Stones you are built up a spiritual
[1:24:58] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[1:25:01] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[1:25:03] by Jesus Christ notice he doesn't say
[1:25:05] you are he says you are built
[1:25:08] up there's a process of choosing there's
[1:25:11] a process of digging out of the earth
[1:25:13] then there's the shaping and the cutting
[1:25:16] and the forming and the trimming and the
[1:25:18] sanding then the transport and then
[1:25:20] there's the fitting in the adoption the
[1:25:22] positional placing but it's a progress
[1:25:25] of work it's a process that's going on
[1:25:28] before we can be fully fitted into the
[1:25:30] bride of Christ and that's the working
[1:25:32] of the holy spirit in the believer's
[1:25:35] life he says wherefore also it is
[1:25:37] contained in the scripture behold I lay
[1:25:39] in zon a Chief Cornerstone elect
[1:25:42] precious and he that believeth on him
[1:25:44] shall not be confounded unto you
[1:25:47] therefore which believe he is precious
[1:25:49] but unto them which be disobedient the
[1:25:51] stone which the builders disallowed the
[1:25:53] same has made the head of the
[1:25:56] corner what everybody else has turned
[1:25:58] aside is what God has chosen you want
[1:26:00] another evidence you'll be turned
[1:26:03] down he says and it's a stone of
[1:26:05] stumbling and a rock of offense but
[1:26:08] watch this watch what stumbles them it
[1:26:11] says even to them which stumble at
[1:26:14] the
[1:26:16] word being disobedient where unto also
[1:26:21] they were appointed notice they stumble
[1:26:23] at accepting receiving the word amen
[1:26:26] they just can't take it they either
[1:26:27] reject it or they add a little bit or
[1:26:29] they take a little bit away amen Peter
[1:26:32] says they were appointed to this they
[1:26:34] are not children of God and so they are
[1:26:36] appointed to refuse the word of God but
[1:26:38] notice this it doesn't say they stumble
[1:26:40] at attending church doesn't say they
[1:26:43] they they they stumble at being a part
[1:26:45] of a local body it doesn't say they're
[1:26:47] not religious it says they stumble at
[1:26:50] the word that's what causes the problems
[1:26:53] amen the word is what trips them up
[1:26:55] makes them
[1:26:56] fall why because they're
[1:26:59] disobedient he says but ye are a chosen
[1:27:01] generation a royal priesthood a holy
[1:27:04] nation A peculiar people that you should
[1:27:07] show forth the Praises of him who has
[1:27:09] called you out of Darkness Into His
[1:27:12] Marvelous Light so we're living
[1:27:15] stones we're alive when this process is
[1:27:17] going on and we saw how at the beginning
[1:27:20] we have that that sincere uh milk of the
[1:27:23] word and God takes care of the basics we
[1:27:25] could say God cleans out our life God
[1:27:27] changes our desires God God uh you know
[1:27:30] we have those little hidden habits and
[1:27:32] those little things that we don't want
[1:27:33] people to know about and the Holy Spirit
[1:27:35] is here to take care of those that's the
[1:27:37] first thing he's doing is he's getting
[1:27:39] you ready for him to use amen but let me
[1:27:42] say it this way what you do doesn't
[1:27:45] matter nearly so much as what you want
[1:27:47] to
[1:27:48] do we are going to lose to this flesh
[1:27:50] from time to time but it's the changing
[1:27:52] of the heart that matters remember what
[1:27:54] Jesus said he says if a man looks on a
[1:27:56] woman to lust after her he has already
[1:27:58] done it with her in his heart and he is
[1:28:00] judged as if he did it in his
[1:28:02] flesh God's looking at the heart and
[1:28:05] that's the thing that needs the changing
[1:28:08] amen that's the desires so if our actual
[1:28:10] desire is to do the things that don't
[1:28:12] please God that's what the holy spirit's
[1:28:14] there to change now you can fight that
[1:28:16] desire all your life and God bless you
[1:28:18] for fighting but that's not the victory
[1:28:22] God bless you for fighting amen but your
[1:28:24] desires have to be cleansed they need to
[1:28:26] be Washed by the Water of the word your
[1:28:29] and and your your guilty conscience has
[1:28:31] to be cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[1:28:33] Christ that's the real Victory is when
[1:28:35] the desire is no longer there rather
[1:28:37] than the battle is going on in you're
[1:28:39] fighting why because now you've entered
[1:28:41] into rest you've ceased from your dead
[1:28:44] works and you've entered in the rest
[1:28:46] that is Christ amen now that doesn't
[1:28:48] mean we aren't tempted and let me drop
[1:28:50] this in here real quick that doesn't
[1:28:51] mean we aren't tempted because this
[1:28:53] flesh is sticky it has five senses It
[1:28:56] Wants What It
[1:28:57] Wants but what the what the Holy Spirit
[1:29:00] does is he changes Temptation from a
[1:29:03] desire to a
[1:29:06] choice because here's the thing I don't
[1:29:09] sit around all
[1:29:12] day I got to be real careful here got to
[1:29:15] pick something that's okay to say over
[1:29:16] the
[1:29:20] pulpit I don't
[1:29:22] desire I don't sit around all day every
[1:29:26] day even part of my day wishing I made
[1:29:28] $300,000 a
[1:29:30] year but if the opportunity comes up to
[1:29:34] make $300,000 a year let me say this
[1:29:37] this flesh is going to say lead me to
[1:29:39] that
[1:29:40] job right because the flesh wants
[1:29:44] stuff it wants Comfort it wants ease it
[1:29:47] wants
[1:29:49] security and so that there is a
[1:29:51] Temptation there from the flesh but in
[1:29:53] my my heart it doesn't matter to me but
[1:29:57] if you put it at the right time in the
[1:29:59] right place with the right spin on it it
[1:30:02] can become a greater Temptation
[1:30:04] especially if I'm dried out especially
[1:30:06] if I'm not where I want to be where I
[1:30:08] ought to be but in my heart of hearts my
[1:30:10] desire is to serve God not to make a lot
[1:30:12] of money but it's a Temptation because
[1:30:14] this flesh likes everything that money
[1:30:17] brings
[1:30:19] amen so what does the Holy Spirit do it
[1:30:22] takes away that continual thirst for the
[1:30:25] things of the world and the things of
[1:30:27] this flesh and that's when you can rest
[1:30:31] cuz can you imagine not imagine we've
[1:30:33] all been there when all you do is fight
[1:30:35] all day long because there's something
[1:30:37] in here that's wrong that's a miserable
[1:30:41] miserable place and that's the rest of
[1:30:44] Christ when you get the holy spirit is
[1:30:45] it'll take that away so now you've just
[1:30:48] got the occasional Choice rather than
[1:30:50] the constant battle to keep those things
[1:30:52] in check amen does that make
[1:30:55] sense so he changes the Holy Spirit
[1:30:58] changes your motive it changes your
[1:31:00] purpose your desires and so when those
[1:31:02] things come up it's not a heart and soul
[1:31:03] desire and so it's easier to overcome
[1:31:05] and so the holy spirit's there to have
[1:31:07] you turn your head to say no to use your
[1:31:10] feet for
[1:31:11] discernment to hit the next song
[1:31:13] Whatever that might be in our life amen
[1:31:15] Paul or John would say it this way I
[1:31:17] love the
[1:31:18] scripture he says for whatsoever is born
[1:31:21] of God how are we born Church by the
[1:31:24] holy spirit for whatsoever is born of
[1:31:27] God overcometh the world you want to
[1:31:31] know if you've been born again you're
[1:31:32] overcoming the world Amen very simple
[1:31:35] test you win the battle against The
[1:31:37] Temptations and influences of this world
[1:31:40] he says and this is the victory that
[1:31:42] overcometh the world even our faith so
[1:31:44] see how it's all tied together he says
[1:31:45] we've got to have faith to have
[1:31:47] overcoming power but we need Faith to
[1:31:49] get the victory but Faith only comes by
[1:31:51] hearing the word but you can only hear
[1:31:52] the word if you're a child of God
[1:31:54] God and you can only become a child of
[1:31:56] God by the Holy Spirit as in you can
[1:31:58] only live the word by the holy spirit so
[1:32:01] it's all tied into this one big circle
[1:32:03] here he says who is he that overcometh
[1:32:05] the world but he that believeth that
[1:32:06] Jesus is the son of God we got lots of
[1:32:08] people saying they believe Jesus is the
[1:32:10] son of God shoot this scripture and see
[1:32:12] where they end up are you overcoming the
[1:32:15] world CU if you're not you don't love
[1:32:17] him because if you did that love would
[1:32:19] do something in our life when we really
[1:32:22] believe overcoming power follows
[1:32:24] he says this is he that came by water
[1:32:27] and blood even Jesus Christ not by water
[1:32:29] only but by water and blood and it is
[1:32:32] the spirit that beareth witness because
[1:32:35] the spirit is truth Jesus said the holy
[1:32:37] spirit will lead you into all truth
[1:32:39] because what it's the spirit of the word
[1:32:41] it is the word amen so the more we
[1:32:44] mature the greatting the work the
[1:32:46] greater the working of the spirit in our
[1:32:49] life and it's not just Truth for the
[1:32:51] sake of knowledge but it's Truth for the
[1:32:53] sake sake of an experience of the
[1:32:55] reality of the
[1:32:56] word it's to take that truth and make it
[1:32:59] an applied experience rather than a head
[1:33:01] knowledge experience Amen brother R says
[1:33:04] it this way he says a hybrid plant we're
[1:33:06] talking about overcoming the
[1:33:09] world there we go a hybrid plant you
[1:33:13] have to baby it and spray it and keep
[1:33:16] the bugs and beetles off of it but not a
[1:33:18] genuine healthy plant he is sturdy
[1:33:20] strong and no bugs come on him he has
[1:33:22] got enough in him to throw the bug off
[1:33:25] and so as a genuine Christian you don't
[1:33:27] have to Baby him and Pat him and tell
[1:33:30] him this that or the other he says he
[1:33:32] has got something in
[1:33:35] him the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:33:39] throws all the rest of it off you don't
[1:33:42] have to beg him around because he's a
[1:33:43] genuine plant of God he says he has got
[1:33:46] something in him that Wars I love that a
[1:33:49] Christian fights for every inch of
[1:33:51] ground he stands on he must do that if
[1:33:53] ever expects to exist and by doing it
[1:33:56] there's something in him that takes care
[1:33:58] of him so what's he saying if you've got
[1:34:00] the Holy Spirit you'll fight and you'll
[1:34:03] fight and you'll fight and you'll fight
[1:34:05] you'll fight when you're disappointed
[1:34:07] you'll fight when you're tired you'll
[1:34:08] fight when you're weak you'll fight when
[1:34:10] it's hopeless you'll fight when you're
[1:34:12] hurt you'll fight when you're offended
[1:34:14] there's something in you that won't let
[1:34:16] it
[1:34:17] go and sometimes we think well I've
[1:34:19] given up I'm not fighting the way I used
[1:34:22] to but the thing is you hav walked
[1:34:25] away that's when you've lost the battle
[1:34:27] is when you walk away when you lay your
[1:34:29] weapon down that's when you've lost
[1:34:32] sometimes all we're doing is we're
[1:34:33] laying bloody on the on the on the field
[1:34:35] of battle and we're just slightly poking
[1:34:37] that sword up and saying stick stay away
[1:34:39] keeping the buzzards off of us but we're
[1:34:40] still fighting we're still fighting the
[1:34:43] scripture says a just man a righteous
[1:34:45] man falls seven times but he gets up
[1:34:47] again why there's a life inside of him
[1:34:49] that's bubbling up that cannot be
[1:34:52] suppressed you can put concrete on it
[1:34:54] you can put dirt on it you can slander
[1:34:56] it you can kick them you can do whatever
[1:34:58] you want but there's a life that keeps
[1:35:00] coming up because it's the Life of
[1:35:02] Christ it's not me inside that's doing
[1:35:04] this that's what we're talking about
[1:35:06] amen it may not look like we're fighting
[1:35:08] but we haven't dropped our weapon I was
[1:35:11] reading in my devotions yesterday
[1:35:12] morning and I love this it's talking
[1:35:14] about the Mighty Men of David it says
[1:35:16] these be the names of the Mighty Men
[1:35:18] whom David had and he talks about the
[1:35:19] top three it says the taconite that sat
[1:35:22] in the seat chief of among the captains
[1:35:24] this is the best of the best was Ado the
[1:35:26] eite and he lifted up his spear against
[1:35:28] 800 whom he slew at one time and after
[1:35:32] him was elazar the son of Dodo the yoite
[1:35:35] one of the three mighty men with David
[1:35:37] when they defied the Philistines that
[1:35:39] were there gathered together to battle
[1:35:41] and the men of Israel were gone away now
[1:35:43] watch the great man here he says he
[1:35:46] arose he didn't sit back he went to
[1:35:50] battle it says and smot the Philistines
[1:35:52] until his head hand was weary till he
[1:35:55] could barely lift his
[1:35:58] sword it says and his hand clave unto
[1:36:02] The Sword and the Lord wrought a great
[1:36:06] victory that day notice we've got a
[1:36:07] pause there a period of
[1:36:12] time that wasn't the end of the battle
[1:36:15] he was fighting that way for a long time
[1:36:18] it says and the Lord wrought a great
[1:36:19] victory that day and the people returned
[1:36:22] after him only to SPO oil now we know
[1:36:24] that the scriptures in the Old Testament
[1:36:26] are a type and a shadow but I want you
[1:36:28] to see something the first thing that
[1:36:30] elazar did was he went into battle he
[1:36:32] got involved he says I'm not going to
[1:36:34] stand here and let the uncircumcised
[1:36:37] Philistines take what belongs to a child
[1:36:39] of God so he arose and he took his
[1:36:42] weapon and he fought and he fought and
[1:36:46] he fought and he got tired but I want
[1:36:48] you to see something church that the
[1:36:50] longer he fought the more at one he
[1:36:52] became with his weapon and at the end of
[1:36:55] it he couldn't let that word go he
[1:36:57] couldn't let that sword go because his
[1:36:59] hand had fused to his weapon why because
[1:37:03] he said I'm not letting go and it became
[1:37:07] a part of him
[1:37:09] Hallelujah he couldn't let go if he
[1:37:11] wanted
[1:37:12] to that sword was a part of him the word
[1:37:15] had become one with the with the
[1:37:17] Christian with the believer with the
[1:37:21] warrior don't let go this morning this
[1:37:24] evening don't let
[1:37:27] go when you get tired
[1:37:31] disappointed weary depressed thinking
[1:37:34] it's just you it was just
[1:37:36] elazar and it says that what elazar did
[1:37:39] was he got something for everybody else
[1:37:41] that ran
[1:37:42] away they only returned after his he had
[1:37:46] become one with the word but they got
[1:37:47] the blessing of his
[1:37:50] battle and I'm sure it inspired courage
[1:37:52] for the next time
[1:37:54] but he became one with the word amen
[1:37:56] people say this this thing
[1:37:59] today when you've received the message
[1:38:01] you've received the Holy Spirit and I
[1:38:03] know what they're talking about I know
[1:38:05] what they're trying to say but it's not
[1:38:06] strictly correct because Jesus said the
[1:38:08] Devils believe also and tremble if we
[1:38:11] talk about simple belief or acceptance
[1:38:13] of it in that way the Devils believe it
[1:38:15] enough that they're scared of it amen
[1:38:18] but it's becoming what you believe that
[1:38:21] shows that you've received it amen you
[1:38:23] become one with your weapon with the
[1:38:25] word amen we can believe it in our head
[1:38:28] but until it drops into our soul and
[1:38:30] starts to produce the Life of Christ in
[1:38:32] this body our faith is intellectual and
[1:38:35] our belief is purely that as well it's
[1:38:37] not wrong it's not bad it just has to
[1:38:40] mature it has to grow amen we need a
[1:38:43] rapturing faith a changing faith not
[1:38:45] just a knowing faith we need something
[1:38:47] that's going to take us into a life
[1:38:49] experience that is a changing amen we
[1:38:53] start as newborn babes in Christ as
[1:38:54] Peter said Naturally Speaking we do the
[1:38:57] same thing we grow from a a baby into a
[1:38:59] toddler and toddlers aren't a much use
[1:39:01] except wrecking things and making
[1:39:05] messes we've got to be patient with our
[1:39:07] young
[1:39:08] Christians sometimes they make more
[1:39:10] messes than they help but you know what
[1:39:14] you'll find that the heart of a good
[1:39:16] child they still want to struggle and
[1:39:18] carry that one little bag of groceries
[1:39:20] up the stairs banging the freshly
[1:39:23] purchased eggs all along the stairs all
[1:39:25] along the way and then dropping them on
[1:39:28] the apples so they all get bruised but
[1:39:30] what are they trying to do they're
[1:39:31] trying to help and we let them help in
[1:39:33] their own little way they're not much
[1:39:35] use but they're a little bit they may
[1:39:38] make the difference between one trip and
[1:39:39] two trips to the car for the groceries
[1:39:42] and we appreciate that amen but then as
[1:39:44] they get a little older well they can
[1:39:45] now they can shovel the snow off the off
[1:39:47] the steps they can clear the walkway as
[1:39:50] they get older they can clear the whole
[1:39:52] driveway can't they brother Bob and it's
[1:39:53] a wonderful day they can mold along and
[1:39:55] these different things as we come into
[1:39:57] the teenager years now they have the
[1:39:59] strength to do so much but what do they
[1:40:02] need they need the right application of
[1:40:04] the strength they need the character
[1:40:07] they need the willingness to do what
[1:40:09] needs to be done they've got the
[1:40:12] strength now they need to put it in the
[1:40:14] right
[1:40:15] place so from that first stage God is
[1:40:18] really building you up and he sets that
[1:40:20] that Firm Foundation that word
[1:40:21] foundation and he gets those early
[1:40:23] principles settled on on the first on
[1:40:26] the first bit amen but once that's
[1:40:28] settled then where does God start
[1:40:29] working this is my personal experience I
[1:40:31] believe the word supports it was we move
[1:40:33] now into
[1:40:35] attitude we move into
[1:40:38] response we move into laying our lives
[1:40:41] down we move into a humility we move
[1:40:44] into a
[1:40:46] servitude amen God starts taking all of
[1:40:49] those principles and he starts putting
[1:40:51] them into action in the local body then
[1:40:53] the local community where now we don't
[1:40:55] have to fight over everything we can lay
[1:40:58] our rights down we can lay our ego down
[1:41:01] we can lay our image down amen and we're
[1:41:04] able to let the love of Christ
[1:41:07] flow rather than what this flesh wants
[1:41:09] to let flow which is usually two quick
[1:41:12] lefts and a solid right to finish the
[1:41:13] job that's what this flesh wants so many
[1:41:15] times amen but it's the love of Christ
[1:41:18] now that's flowing through us and we're
[1:41:20] starting to come then to a place where
[1:41:21] our purpose becomes clear and what used
[1:41:24] to satisfy us in the word no longer
[1:41:27] does
[1:41:29] amen I
[1:41:31] remember this may shock some people I
[1:41:35] hope you understand my
[1:41:36] heart I used to love going to youth
[1:41:39] camps when I was a
[1:41:41] youth but when I went to youth camps
[1:41:43] after I received the Holy Spirit after a
[1:41:45] while guess what I needed
[1:41:49] more it's a wonderful place it's a
[1:41:52] wonderful atmosphere but the
[1:41:54] focus is something that I didn't
[1:41:56] necessarily need it's not wrong it's not
[1:42:00] bad it's wonderful things but it's
[1:42:03] really focused on people at a different
[1:42:05] stage of their Christian walk and so
[1:42:07] when I would go to a youth camp now it's
[1:42:10] as a supporter more than it is as a
[1:42:14] receiver I'm there to work and help and
[1:42:17] set an atmosphere and pray for others
[1:42:19] rather than go in there and get a bunch
[1:42:20] of stuff for myself why cuz I've moved
[1:42:22] on
[1:42:23] I've matured I've grown amen so we need
[1:42:26] something a little stronger and Paul
[1:42:28] would talk about this in Hebrews he says
[1:42:33] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:42:36] doctrine of Christ let us do what go
[1:42:40] on go on unto
[1:42:44] Perfection onto maturity onto
[1:42:46] completeness is the the root word there
[1:42:48] he says not laying again the foundation
[1:42:50] of repentance from dead works and of
[1:42:52] Faith towards God I was talking to
[1:42:53] brother Mark the other day and he says
[1:42:55] well you'll you'll notice somebody's
[1:42:56] maturing in the word when they stop
[1:42:57] coming up to the altar every service
[1:43:00] that's a really good thing because
[1:43:02] they've got a revelation that you don't
[1:43:03] have to come up here to
[1:43:05] repent doesn't always have to be a show
[1:43:08] it's not that it was a show but it
[1:43:09] doesn't have to be a public uh uh thing
[1:43:11] you can do that in the privacy of your
[1:43:13] own home on on your bed in your car seat
[1:43:15] whatever you might be amen he says we we
[1:43:18] we moved on beyond what we had these
[1:43:21] were the principles that you're your
[1:43:23] Christian walk is built on Amen the
[1:43:26] faith that accepts the finished work of
[1:43:27] Calvary of the doctrine of baptisms and
[1:43:30] of laying on of hands and of
[1:43:32] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[1:43:33] judgment now you've moved from from from
[1:43:35] what got you into Christ now you're
[1:43:37] moving to the foundational truth of the
[1:43:39] Christian
[1:43:41] church but he says there's more to it
[1:43:43] than that there's more than just
[1:43:45] understanding there's more than just go
[1:43:47] good Doctrine Peter's saying you
[1:43:48] shouldn't need to be taught the basics
[1:43:50] again you've got them you've applied
[1:43:52] them you've received them you followed
[1:43:54] them you've obeyed them they're settled
[1:43:55] now keep going keep moving on in your
[1:43:58] walk amen there's more than just
[1:44:00] understanding Perfection maturity now is
[1:44:03] getting the full effect of it rather
[1:44:05] than just the knowledge of it a
[1:44:07] revelation is meant to be revealed amen
[1:44:11] and if we're the word made flesh then
[1:44:12] that Revelation at some point has to
[1:44:14] drop into this flesh thank you brother
[1:44:16] Matt he says' but beloved we're
[1:44:18] persuaded better things of you he says
[1:44:20] we believe you're going to do this
[1:44:23] you you're meant to do better than what
[1:44:25] you've got he says and things that
[1:44:27] accompany salvation though we though we
[1:44:30] thus speak so we don't stop because
[1:44:32] we're saved because we're filled with
[1:44:33] the Holy Spirit there are greater things
[1:44:35] that are waiting for us he says for God
[1:44:38] is Not unrighteous for to forget your
[1:44:40] work and your labor of love which you
[1:44:42] have showed uh toward his name in that
[1:44:45] ye have ministered to the Saints and do
[1:44:46] Minister and we desire that every one of
[1:44:49] you do show the same diligence to the
[1:44:50] full Assurance of Hope under the end he
[1:44:52] says don't won't stop the
[1:44:54] works your maturity won't stop you from
[1:44:57] having an effect in the local
[1:44:58] congregation and in the body of Christ
[1:45:00] and these different things but he says
[1:45:02] you've got to go on to Perfection
[1:45:04] maturity he says so be not slothful but
[1:45:08] followers of them who through faith and
[1:45:10] patient do what they inherit the
[1:45:14] promises remember when you go into into
[1:45:17] Hebrews 11 I guess the the faith chapter
[1:45:19] they would say by Faith by Faith by
[1:45:21] faith he says these all died having not
[1:45:23] receive the
[1:45:24] promises but he says you've got to have
[1:45:26] faith and patience to inherit the
[1:45:28] promises because they're meant for you
[1:45:30] to get them they're not meant to always
[1:45:32] stay out there as a carrot God holding a
[1:45:34] carrot to try and keep us moving forth
[1:45:36] but there's a day where we're supposed
[1:45:38] to receive it there's a day where we're
[1:45:40] supposed to have the reality of it in
[1:45:42] your life so he's saying don't stop
[1:45:44] because you've had a new birth don't
[1:45:45] stop because you're saved don't stop
[1:45:47] because you have gifts amen he says go
[1:45:49] all the way to the promise that's meant
[1:45:50] for you and what's our promise it's a
[1:45:53] resurrection and a Rapture it's a body
[1:45:54] change amen it's rapturing Faith it's a
[1:45:57] marriage supper of the L it's a
[1:45:58] glorified
[1:46:00] body listen you can stop here with the
[1:46:02] baptism of the Holy Spirit and you'll go
[1:46:04] to
[1:46:05] heaven but who wants to show up having
[1:46:08] sat around for the last bit keep going
[1:46:11] keep pressing keep pushing to the full
[1:46:15] promise Paul would talk to the Jewish
[1:46:17] the the the Jewish converts and the
[1:46:20] thing I love about Paul is he never
[1:46:21] pulled his punches and it wasn't wasn't
[1:46:23] Paul that was doing that it was the Holy
[1:46:24] Spirit doing it and I think it's because
[1:46:26] sometimes we need a swift kick in the
[1:46:27] rear to get us going sometimes Paul says
[1:46:30] for one for when for the time ye ought
[1:46:33] to be teachers you have need that one
[1:46:35] teach you again which be the first
[1:46:37] principles of the Oracles of God and are
[1:46:40] become such as have need of milk and not
[1:46:42] of strong meat so Peter said leaving the
[1:46:45] first principles once you got them
[1:46:47] established and now Paul's coming back
[1:46:49] and he's saying you've not grown at all
[1:46:50] and now we've got to retach you the
[1:46:52] things that you were supposed to have
[1:46:53] been taught and used
[1:46:54] already why they didn't move on in the
[1:46:58] word they didn't feed their experience
[1:47:01] they were satisfied with where they'd
[1:47:02] gotten and all it led to was a
[1:47:04] backslidden
[1:47:06] condition he says for everyone that uses
[1:47:09] milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:47:11] righteousness for he is a
[1:47:12] bab new
[1:47:15] newly Christians that have newly
[1:47:17] received the Holy Ghost let me put it
[1:47:18] this way don't go in thinking you're
[1:47:20] going to correct the church
[1:47:24] be still grow learn be humble and God
[1:47:29] will open your
[1:47:30] eyes and if you do what Timothy did then
[1:47:33] people will listen to you because it'll
[1:47:35] be the Holy Spirit speaking not
[1:47:37] you he says but strong meat belongeth to
[1:47:41] them that are of what full age even
[1:47:44] those who by reason of use have their
[1:47:47] senses exercised to discern both good
[1:47:50] and evil now I'm not going to dig into
[1:47:52] the script scripture we could preach a
[1:47:53] whole service on it but I want you to
[1:47:55] see one thing here and he says that if
[1:47:57] you have the Holy Spirit it will bring
[1:47:59] you to maturity that is reflected in
[1:48:02] your
[1:48:02] daytoday life and
[1:48:05] decisions because you've exercised what
[1:48:08] you've got
[1:48:11] amen we're we're talking about people
[1:48:13] that have moved Beyond knowing the
[1:48:15] doctrines and knowing the teachings and
[1:48:18] have fully applied the word of God and
[1:48:20] now they're able to say it's true
[1:48:23] because they've experienced the truth of
[1:48:25] the applying of the word and what does
[1:48:26] it do Church it gives them
[1:48:28] discernment it gives them an
[1:48:30] understanding it gives them an insight
[1:48:32] into what's going on and they've learned
[1:48:34] it because they've tested it and they've
[1:48:35] applied it and they've checked their own
[1:48:37] life against what the word says they've
[1:48:40] checked their
[1:48:41] decisions hey every church has things
[1:48:43] where we look back and say we wish we
[1:48:45] would have caught that earlier don't we
[1:48:47] absolutely you guys know what happened
[1:48:48] in Texas and I've said before the reason
[1:48:51] that I believe we missed it is because
[1:48:52] we were too willing to look past it we
[1:48:56] put the word aside because we wanted so
[1:48:57] bad to have a pastor there to have a
[1:48:59] minister there amen but these people
[1:49:04] they've learned to look past your
[1:49:05] clothes your good your good clothes your
[1:49:08] good
[1:49:09] words they've learned to look past what
[1:49:11] they
[1:49:12] see and look at your attitude your
[1:49:16] spirit your priorities and they've
[1:49:19] learned to have patience to see the
[1:49:21] fruit before before they fully commit
[1:49:24] listen we we ought to open our arms to
[1:49:26] every
[1:49:28] person but we also have to have deser to
[1:49:31] sit there and see first that's why we
[1:49:34] have a waiting period to serve in as an
[1:49:36] officer of this church a minimum 6
[1:49:38] months so that we can see what your life
[1:49:40] is like a minister moves in here what do
[1:49:42] we do we stop and we see unless we
[1:49:44] already know them well there's a time of
[1:49:47] waiting for those things and it's a time
[1:49:49] of testing and it's a time of proving
[1:49:50] and why do we do that church because we
[1:49:52] got discernment and we know that we have
[1:49:55] to see the fruits to really see what's
[1:49:57] in that person's life
[1:50:00] amen so in other words we can have this
[1:50:04] idea that we've received the Holy Spirit
[1:50:06] and that's
[1:50:07] good we want to believe we ought to
[1:50:10] believe and our faith ought to be an
[1:50:11] anchor for our soul but our faith needs
[1:50:13] to be anchored in something real and
[1:50:15] brother Braham said there's only one
[1:50:17] place for an for your faith to Anchor
[1:50:18] and that's the word of God Amen if our
[1:50:21] faith is anchored in an exp exp erience
[1:50:23] and it doesn't produce a life that lines
[1:50:25] up with the word of God there's
[1:50:27] something wrong with our experience it's
[1:50:29] that simple okay that experience may
[1:50:33] have been from God it may have been God
[1:50:36] but it is not the receiving or the
[1:50:37] baptism of the holy spirit because there
[1:50:40] will be a lasting effect that matures
[1:50:42] you in the word if you've received the
[1:50:44] Holy Spirit there's a growth in your
[1:50:47] Christian walk amen If all we're doing
[1:50:49] is coming to church going home and
[1:50:50] sleeping getting up going to work for a
[1:50:52] couple more days coming back to church
[1:50:54] and then having a day off on the weekend
[1:50:55] and then doing it all again and rinse
[1:50:57] and repeat rinse and repeat church
[1:50:59] that's not the Holy
[1:51:00] Ghost that's just dead
[1:51:03] religion there's a
[1:51:05] life there's a life day to day that
[1:51:08] represents and reveals Christ amen
[1:51:11] otherwise it's just dead
[1:51:14] tradition Jesus said this he says sorry
[1:51:17] John said this
[1:51:18] behold what manner of love the father
[1:51:20] had bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:51:23] called the sons of God therefore the
[1:51:25] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[1:51:28] not beloved now are we the sons of God
[1:51:32] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:51:35] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:51:38] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:51:40] him as he is now we'll have a body like
[1:51:43] unto his glorified glorious body the
[1:51:45] scripture says but will also have his
[1:51:47] character and nature that's what the
[1:51:49] lead Dean uh overcoming is remember is
[1:51:52] it's gold tried in the fire that's the
[1:51:55] deity that's the character the nature of
[1:51:57] Christ we'll have a white robe that's
[1:51:59] his righteousness and that's what comes
[1:52:02] out of this amen but then he says in
[1:52:04] John 1 this
[1:52:05] is or 1 John 3 he says but as many as
[1:52:09] received him remember only a child of
[1:52:11] God can receive Christ the word to them
[1:52:14] gave he power to become the sons of God
[1:52:17] even to them that believe on his name
[1:52:19] which were born not of blood nor of the
[1:52:22] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[1:52:25] but of God Amen so there's a
[1:52:27] transforming that it's talking about
[1:52:28] here we talk about a
[1:52:31] metamorphosis where it doesn't appear
[1:52:33] what you are until the
[1:52:36] end you always were this but the outside
[1:52:40] hid what was on the inside and so Paul
[1:52:43] is saying or pet John is saying here he
[1:52:45] says there's a power that comes here
[1:52:49] that will transform what does not appear
[1:52:51] to be a child of God into a child of God
[1:52:54] you always were a child of God but
[1:52:56] there's an appearance that has to change
[1:52:58] there's something that has to happen
[1:52:59] from the inside out that makes it very
[1:53:02] clear that you are a child of God Amen
[1:53:05] and so it starts with an inward work of
[1:53:08] the Holy Spirit sealing our soul a
[1:53:10] changing of our nature our desires and
[1:53:12] these different things and that's to get
[1:53:13] us to accept the word of God and give it
[1:53:15] the preeminence in our life but after
[1:53:18] that when that desire has changed when
[1:53:19] we've surrendered to him now all of that
[1:53:22] has to be put into action and into
[1:53:24] service it has to do something in our
[1:53:27] life amen I can't say that this Bible
[1:53:29] has changed my life if my my life is the
[1:53:32] same as it was before the Bible changed
[1:53:33] my life if my life is the same after
[1:53:36] I've received Christ then I didn't
[1:53:38] receive Christ because it will always
[1:53:40] take me further and further into the
[1:53:42] word remember what Jesus said he said I
[1:53:44] came that you might have life more
[1:53:47] abundantly more and more life
[1:53:50] continuously growing a Wellspring of of
[1:53:52] life within us amen the holy spirit is
[1:53:54] here to make us live like we never could
[1:53:56] live before that's the bottom line to it
[1:53:59] all amen because it's that eternal life
[1:54:01] springing up inside us and that's
[1:54:02] bringing now our body and our spirit by
[1:54:04] faith subject to the word of God going
[1:54:07] to read two quotes and we'll close he
[1:54:09] says the word is supposed to transform
[1:54:11] you from what the things of the world
[1:54:14] are into the image of the Sons and
[1:54:17] Daughters of God then if you accept that
[1:54:19] word it'll transform you from a son of
[1:54:21] the world a daughter of the world to a
[1:54:23] son and daughter of God he says look at
[1:54:25] you in here how many have had that
[1:54:26] experience every one of us we've had
[1:54:29] that experience why because it was
[1:54:31] spoken it was believed and the word came
[1:54:35] forth and fell into the bed of the heart
[1:54:37] and there it grew right out of it he
[1:54:40] says transforming yourself his holy
[1:54:43] spirit transforms the seed word into its
[1:54:46] likeness like if a pear tree brings
[1:54:48] forth a pear an apple tree an apple
[1:54:51] things like that his word word will
[1:54:52] bring forth Sons and Daughters of God
[1:54:55] that's what it is supposed to do if
[1:54:58] youve received the Holy Spirit it'll
[1:55:01] change you into it'll transform you into
[1:55:05] a child of God Amen God bless you let's
[1:55:08] stand yeah we look at that and it can be
[1:55:11] confusing at times because we say well
[1:55:13] what's the
[1:55:14] difference I look just like anybody else
[1:55:17] at the start for
[1:55:18] sure but you know we had this kind of
[1:55:22] disgusting experience I guess at the
[1:55:24] house where you can look around your
[1:55:26] house and if you go look at the leaves
[1:55:28] in the spring you'll see all sorts of
[1:55:30] worms and insects and all sorts of
[1:55:33] creepy crawly things and some of them
[1:55:36] look very
[1:55:37] similar but you'll notice that some of
[1:55:40] them after a while a process starts to
[1:55:42] happen and this happened on the front
[1:55:45] window of our house right next to our
[1:55:46] main door and what was it is one of
[1:55:49] those worms that didn't look any
[1:55:50] different from a lot of other worms
[1:55:53] he went up and he attached himself to
[1:55:54] our front
[1:55:56] window and then there was a fuzz that
[1:55:58] went over
[1:56:00] him and inside that fuzz we didn't see
[1:56:03] anything
[1:56:04] happen but one day the fuzz was open and
[1:56:08] a big red nasty mess was out of it but
[1:56:12] you know what else came out Church a
[1:56:15] butterfly you can go into the into into
[1:56:17] nature into the wild and you can put two
[1:56:19] caterpillars beside each other and one
[1:56:22] of them is a butterfly and the other one
[1:56:23] will never be a butterfly one of them
[1:56:26] has inside of it the nature of a
[1:56:29] butterfly
[1:56:31] amen the other one looks just like that
[1:56:34] that butterfly did at the beginning but
[1:56:36] it can do everything the butterfly does
[1:56:38] and it'll never change into a butterfly
[1:56:40] it will never go to a place where it
[1:56:42] wraps
[1:56:43] itself and it
[1:56:45] rests and it changes
[1:56:47] itself in a process called
[1:56:51] metamorphosis that's what the word does
[1:56:53] you might look like a caterpillar like
[1:56:55] everybody else but there's a DNA inside
[1:56:58] of you a word seed that says you're a
[1:57:01] child of God and when that word comes
[1:57:03] and you wrap yourself in it and you give
[1:57:05] yourself over to the process and you let
[1:57:07] it do its work one day it cracks open
[1:57:10] and all of a sudden you're a child of
[1:57:12] God and then from there guess what that
[1:57:15] butterfly isn't Bound by what it was
[1:57:16] bound by before it doesn't have to crawl
[1:57:20] it doesn't have to creep it can go as
[1:57:22] high as it wants it can go as low as it
[1:57:24] wants it can fly wherever it wants at a
[1:57:26] speed it could never do things before it
[1:57:29] has overcoming power it didn't have
[1:57:30] before it's not Earthbound
[1:57:33] anymore everything about it was meant to
[1:57:36] be this way and yet it did not appear as
[1:57:39] Paul says what we are but we know when
[1:57:42] we see him we're going to be like him
[1:57:44] what is it we'll be turned we'll be
[1:57:46] transformed into the fullness of the
[1:57:47] word for our day that's what the Holy
[1:57:49] Spirit does don't worry about how you
[1:57:51] look when you start trust the process
[1:57:54] and he'll change you into a son and a
[1:57:56] daughter of God amen amen God bless you
[1:57:59] let's bow our heads Lord God how
[1:58:02] thankful we are Lord that this is not a
[1:58:06] process Lord that relies on us Lord but
[1:58:10] you built into US Lord a way of being a
[1:58:15] child of God lord and it comes by the
[1:58:17] washing of Water by the word and it
[1:58:20] comes by the power of your spirit to
[1:58:21] quick Quicken that seed inside of us and
[1:58:24] Lord all we have to do is surrender Lord
[1:58:28] we take it we believe it we apply it and
[1:58:31] then by faith with patience Lord we look
[1:58:34] for the
[1:58:35] promise Lord we're all at different
[1:58:37] stages here tonight from The Young to

[1:58:41] given their hearts to you to those that
[1:58:44] have confessed you as their Savior and
[1:58:45] haven't received your spirit Lord to
[1:58:47] those that have but they are young in
[1:58:49] their walk Lord all the way to those
[1:58:51] that are fully experienced Lord and
[1:58:53] ready for that
[1:58:54] change Lord but from the top to the
[1:58:56] bottom we're waiting for the Perfection
[1:58:58] the maturity of that image Lord I pray
[1:59:01] you help us to rest in your word Lord
[1:59:04] that is the only thing that'll do it
[1:59:06] Lord we've accepted the word for our day
[1:59:09] Lord and we're trusting it'll do that

[1:59:16] spirit help us to trust Lord help us to
[1:59:19] wait Lord help us to be real help us to
[1:59:21] be honest honest about where we're at

[1:59:44] multitude of sins Lord those little
[1:59:47] things that we do and say that great
[1:59:50] Lord and forgive us where we fail Lord
