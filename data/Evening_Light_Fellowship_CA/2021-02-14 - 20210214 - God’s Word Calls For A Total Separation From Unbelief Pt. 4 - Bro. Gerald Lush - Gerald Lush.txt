police car parked in our lot i don't think any of us is driving them amen so we pray the grace of god be with us as we go into the word and we'll give preeminence to him amen so maybe they're just looking for somebody else but not the church here so we'll we'll see we'll leave with leave it with the lord amen because we know that well the devil has come down with great wrath and he's going to do this he's going to do that sometimes we fail to see what god does and how god does it we fail to recognize god but remember that the devil's out there god's there but satan is there and god's going to do this and do this and satan is there to challenge it amen he's come there with great wrath knowing his time is short so he'll he'll do this and he'll allow this he'll try to get this and while all he's doing is trying to get the elect the seed of god amen the believers in trouble put the pressure on them but no the more pressure he puts on us the more faith we have by the grace of god to keep pressing on so we leave that with the lord so the lord bless you and uh god bless our sister maureen for his and the special she's saying amen again it's a challenge to faith amen challenge to our faith by the grace of god that let faith take control and go all the way amen and also uh just to oh yeah just i was i thought about it and i was thinking about what was going on concerning the believers and and i thought about again something that i did see online somewhere and that was believers i'm not sure whether it's in china or in russia but they had pictures of them there and it might have been the voice of god but they were gathering up for ser for a worship and they went into the forest and into the wilderness and but it was a rainy day so they they all had umbrellas amen so we pray the grace of god that we're going to be more than willing to stay with his word stay in his will regardless of the weather regardless of the rules and regulations and so on we want we want to do the will of god amen so grace to us and so let's be in prayer for one another and be in prayer for those not with us here today oh it's it is a challenges again it's a challenge to our faith that our of oh how far are we going to go with this and so on and it's a challenge to to those not with us challenged to those in in their homes and online amen because the temptation's going to be there to go the the flick from one from this service maybe to another service online from this preacher to another preacher online so we pray the grace of god to the saints amen in their homes with their families oh i pray in the name of jesus lord don't let us lose our enthusiasm don't let us lose our zeal for what you've done for us nor that we will respond by the grace of god amen and we would do amen what god wants us to do by his grace amen so let's let's stand and let's sing only believe is my this is amazing maybe we should get the police to come in with us amen to give us a bigger congregation amen and then at the same time you know well maybe some of the things they hear they hear would hear us preach they would agree with us amen i remember one time when we were in way down there in that home we were in a two-story home at the time downward we used to be a new flat hotel across the road and our hotel newfoundland and we have services there and we had at the time i remember it was brother lanny corlett he was there but he also brought with him two or three friends and uh and they came in to witness the services to witness the meetings and to hear the word and i remember that something that was preached struck him and well i guess they had never heard anything like that before and i was talking about solomon's rededication of the temple and i said oh they had this many sheep this many goats this many of this there's many of that and there were thousands i said that they that they sacrificed for the rededication of the temple and i said i'm not sure what the group was back then that was fighting the newfoundland new flanders out there trying to catch seals and they stopped and they of course they stopped it so now they're not allowed to go and catch seals but there was a certain group in newfoundland and maybe part around the world you know and uh they we're fighting it and i said well i said it's a good good thing i said that they weren't there when solomon i said dedicated the template rededicated the temple again they would fight that for sure and say that they wouldn't they're not allowed to sacrifice these sheep not allowed to do this not allowed to do that but thank god amen that he did it amen praise why because we needed it so what do we need now i pray grace brother that we're going to stay with with what god wants us to have and what we really need spiritually no matter what it is what do you need what's your need most go to to the lord with their needs oh lord i need this i need that i need this and again i found a quote there somewhere last evening where brother brown said yeah he said they all want god to do this but he didn't want to do nothing for him god god said do this do it no no they don't think it's necessary yeah but they're right there lord i need this i need this i need this i need that amen well but god needs something too and i pray that we're going to be what god needs in these last days

going to let the word have control amen in our lives in our thoughts in our motives in our objectives all controlled and governed by the word of god and lord it is for your glory your honor your praise forgive us of our sin forgive us of our unbelief forgive us of our doubt amen help us to go forth amen in the name of the lord with absolute perfect faith amen in the name of the lord jesus christ grace grace and more grace for your glory amen and amen thank you jesus now i believe now i believe all things are possible now i believe now i believe now i believe all things are possible now i believe amen praise the lord god bless you turn with me to the book of genesis chapter 13. amen god bless you praise the lord genesis chapter 13 and i want to share with you some thoughts that the prophet god has brought to us in a message entitled god's word we're going to read the word and god's word calls for a total separation amen from unbelief and the prophet god highlights it with the scriptures in genesis 13 the situation with abraham and lot amen and now that god had to bring a separation between abraham and lot to bring abraham to the promise amen of the land that he was to give abraham and to his seed but not to lot it is to the true seed of abraham that believe god it is to throw seed of abraham that trusts god that put their absolute confidence in god amen again it's not again it wasn't abraham that was living it was god in abraham amen was god with abraham praise the lord oh brother that's that's just not in the new testament that rather you go back to the old testament and it was it was god with this one it was god with that one god in this one god with that one amen so i trust we have the same testimony that again is not you and me living it's not you and me responding here it's god amen is christ in us the hope of glory amen it was it was christ with abraham amen and we know that abraham when god called him out from among his people god called him out not just the town he lived in not just the country he lived in but he had to separate from the people amen why because god wanted to deal with abraham and god wants to deal with you and me so so so that it's not going to be interfered with you know we're all this one got our attention that one got our attention that was looking for this looking for that no all god separates us so that's our our concentration is on him our concentration is on his word our concentration is on lord what what do you want to do amen lord just grab me the revelation of your will how do you want me to do this where when and so on oh my so god called abraham out but when he came out well he should have come out just with him and his and his immediate family but he was influenced some way you know a lot came with him and not a lot but his father even his father and and god separated and remember god never spoke after he come out god never spoke to him until his father left and went back amen and yet well yet still god never never gave abraham what he wanted to give abraham still god never revealed to abraham what he wanted to reveal to him the what god had promised what god in his mind that he was going to do with abraham and boy because lot was there so god had to separate lot from abraham and abraham from lot amen praise i trusted amen just to show that we are abraham's seed i wonder if we would if we would make the the choices that abraham made if we were just like abraham gave lot to the the pre or you do this lot whatever you want you do and and he said if you go down there i'll stay here if i go down if you stay here i'll go down there and so on praise the lord so brother i trust that we're going to give god the the preeminence amen not this not that not what i want it's what jesus wants it's what god wants in me and this is this is what god was dealing with in abraham was his was god's will not abraham's will not lot's will not his father's will god oh my when they come out he had to wait till oh it's god never talked to him until his father was gone amen and god still never confirmed to abraham the promise until lot separated oh yeah so brother sometimes that oh there might be this one that we got to too close to fellowship with we got too close to this too close to that we're giving them too much preeminence no no you've got to come to where it's you and god amen you and god that's walking talking living amen it's just you and god god in control amen whether whether in your job whether it's in your home whether it's uh just in in the world in the town you're in in general well it's got to be god in control you're not going to be influenced by this one this one this one no no you're influenced by god amen by the and so god had wait till abraham was totally separated and then god will speak to you god will give you what you need god will give you the revelation need oh yeah because that can interfere with the revelation because if we're too too united with this to too much contact with that then god god can't do what he wants to do in your life so i pray grace in the name of jesus that we'll be totally separated unto the lord amen that god is that real that god is more real to us amen than the physical amen all right guys brother god i pray grace god become more real to to abraham's seed us amen than to the natural seed grace to us amen so i want to share with you the scripture that brother branham read to preach the message god's word calls for a total separation total separation from unbelief oh well well uh unbelief is just that spirit there oh you know sometimes that unbelief is a spirit in this one or in that one it's somebody else you know it could be individuals it could be this church or that church but god's calls for a total separation from it amen so it doesn't control you not going to interfere with what god wants to reveal to you not an interfere with the faith that god wants to find in you and me amen so grace to us five four here and those online amen we never ever dreamed i guess we come to this place but it's gonna get worse amen oh it's definitely gonna get worse so you better make sure that you have faith amen and the faith is in your heart not in your head amen and in genesis 13 in genesis 12 he did say the lord said unto abram get thee out of thy country amen and from thy kindred and from thy father's house onto a land that i will show thee look at the promise of god and he said i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing amen and god has given us a promise to be the bride of the lord jesus christ to sit with him in his throne amen to partake with him of the marriage supper of the lamb amen so brother has god called abraham totally separated from unbelief so god is calling after a total separation of non-belief in your life and in mine don't think oh as jesus did this jesus did that yeah well he did it so it's bring us into a greater separation amen praise the lord and he said i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed amen and abraham departed as the lord had spoken unto him but it says and lot went with him but not that he called it a lot but lot saw what was going on saw what he was doing amen he must have recognized something in abraham he wanted to be part of it yeah no so god would bring a separation between abraham and lot and in genesis 13 and abraham went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot was with him into the south and abraham was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold abram not abraham amen but brother we come to the place where like abraham our name changed praise the lord and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel onto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai unto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord hallelujah god's grace that will not lose revelation amen of our fellowship with god and lot also which went with abram at flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and god permitted it god allowed it amen what for to bring separation amen and god allows things in your life and in our lives amen to us here to those online god allows things to what for oh lord why is this why is that he wants to bring a greater separation amen because we got to be totally separated amen and that's the nasa message he preached he calls for not separation he calls for a total separation from unbelief amen god don't want as the problem god said be careful he said you can go and have so fellowship with this one fellowship with that one and he said their spirit can get on you but your spirit won't get on them amen amen because they resist the death resist the lord amen but satan is there to influence amen god has prayed grace amen we're going to recognize his leadership when it comes to separation amen don't go by your emotions don't go by your feelings you go by your faith amen god wants to do this god wants to do that let's trust the lord amen and lord also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a strife between the herdman of abram's cattle and the herdmen of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwell in the land and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee your spirit's gonna be right amen but you encourage them to keep their spirit ready amen so he said between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy heard me for we be brethren and he said is not the whole land before thee amen he said separate thyself i pray thee from me and if thou wilt take the left and then i will go to the right and and then i will go to the left if thou depart to the right then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his ice and beheld all the plane of jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord he said like the land of egypt as thou comest into zore amen and brother the enemy is there to get you to think oh this is good oh my that's wonderful i think i'll i'll do that i'll do this i'll do that i'll go here i'll go there no you better wait on the lord get his leadership amen then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other amen and abraham dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom don't pitch your life towards sodom amen so you're interest you're looking to the things of the world again it says you love the world or the things of the world the love of god's not in you amen and brother it's not necessary love for sinful things is love for that which is contrary to the will of god for you amen oh i want to do this i want to go here i want to go there oh yeah but no maybe maybe it's not the will of god find the will of the lord by his grace amen but again people people he saw sodom and gomorrah but what he liked was the land what he loved was was oh my the the the richest and the water and everything else oh it looked good amen that maybe he wouldn't have to do much you know for his cattle will do much for this too much for that he'll get he'll become even even more rich and wealthy if i do it this way yeah but again he did he wasn't seeking the will of god it was his will amen and brother if you're a christian if you're a believer if you're a bride you just you're focusing on the will of god amen if god wants you to have a lot of finances he'll do it and if he doesn't he'll take he'll take it from you oh yeah but people feel no no i got to do this i got to do that not and not many are going to say not my will time to be done i'll tell you this the bride's going to say it amen because we focus on the spiritual not the natural by the grace of god amen and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him he lift up lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward amen for all the land which thou see is to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever amen god bless you may be seated amen and brother brown ministered on this that god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief and god proved it in his word amen from genesis to revelation there is the call for separation not partial separation but absolute complete separation from unbelief so that we're putting we're putting our more and more emphasis not on the natural part of our lives but on the spiritual amen because the natural passes away but the spiritual goes on to eternity so i'm praying god by grace will find that total separation in you and in me amen that you'll find in you and me that spirit that anointing that's looking for that separation amen that wants that separation is more than willing amen to enter into god's call to total separation amen and it's it's go let god do the work in you not you make the decisions let god make them and sometimes we think oh that that can't be the lord if that was god he would do this that was god he would do that well but you better go back and check it with the word amen because god god was at a promise that he had given to abraham and god knew but abram knew too and he should have stayed with that word not going with family going with this going with that amen god brought it he separated him from his father and his natural family separated him from lot amen and when god separated them amen then god called him up into the mountain and then god said abraham he said look he said look here look here look here he said all this he said give to you and your seed amen it was and a lot lot wasn't included in that for sure amen because why because god when it comes to abraham's seed it's a spiritual seed abraham said believes god abraham say trust god abraham said is going to give preeminence to the lord amen and they're looking for the will of god and not brother not the natural things of life the spiritual are they getting richer and richer with the lord amen more and more spiritual with the lord amen and less and less caught up with the with the natural things we're getting caught up more and more with the spiritual amen and and this is what god wanted abraham to put the emphasis on and the focus on amen was his relationship with god amen and the promise that god had made input put your focus on on that on the word of god praise the lord on god's plan and god's will for your life by the grace of god amen oh brother brother we could go through the scriptures and we could highlight those that god was calling out of their own will into israel amen and just consider that the changes that god was making in their lives amen and that the influence of god was one thing the influence of the devil was another amen brother and it comes right on down from genesis right on down to revelation amen we're a god where again jesus went in to consider the the spiritual seed of abraham oh but they were focusing more and more on the natural things and they did and they said why because jesus said oh you see you say he said you are rich increased with goods and have needed nothing oh yeah that was and yet they they felt religious they felt oh yeah we're the church and we're this and we're that and we're and because we're we're the seed of god oh and the seed of abraham oh we're rich and increased with goods and that needed nothing but brother it wasn't god it was the devil amen or the satan can bless you like that satan can do this they can give you this take give you that amen he can make you richer make you all depends on the will of god god but god if you're the seed of god god will uh he can't do nothing to the seed without god's permission oh yeah so but sometimes to bring us back in line like he did with abraham god step back and let this happen and this happened this happened amen why to get us to call on the lord again amen to let us recognize that we need the lord by the grace of god amen that's why from the beginning god's word god himself calls us for to a total separation from unbelief amen and again the prophet highlights are concerning what happened in genesis and adam and eve now he said adam could have could have could have stayed separated god adam could have done this could have done that but adam did that with lot with it with eve rather amen but brother but after god came down with the promise of redemption he's going to do this he's going to do that then he called for that total separation believe what he promised abraham but remain stay separated amen abram did that to bring up the promise of god abraham did that to bring up the will of god amen and after it was revealed god went on to call for total separation from unbelief and he's still calling for that total separation by the grace of god amen so he said now he should he said i he said i would call it a text he said right here in the scriptures and he said i wouldn't know whether to call it a text or not but he said just for a text and i want to take this thought he said god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief so are we walking in obedience to that part of the word amen that god called for a total separation on belief here god called for a total separation from the prophets amen for the god prophet our lord jesus christ amen and on down to this these last days to jesus knocked at the door and he's calling you to separate he said knock open the door and come fellowship with me and feast with me and and and i with you amen by the grace of god so god wanted to get abraham separated from the influence of those others in his life amen and god and god all through the ages have been separating the the bride from the influence of the natural things so that he would have the influence in their lives he would have the control of their lives amen and so he said i'm going to preach on it because he said god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief amen but again there are those that are there too and and are sincere and they honor you and respect you well that's good and god will bless and honor them by the grace of god amen but brother if they don't believe really sincerely truly believe then brother just hello goodbye hello nice to see you we'll do what you can we can for you amen but you're more in contact with believers than unbelievers amen grace of god and as he read the scriptures he said now he said the thought of god's word calling a total separation brother one time i experienced it and witnessed it down through the years that there was a total separation from unbelief there's a total separation from unbelievers amen and again our spirit was right our attitude was right but as time went on i began to realize that everything was changing amen and there was compromise and people began to go in and people began to go and and all get closer to this one closer to that one amen whereas when they first came to the word it was total separation their spirit was right their attitude was right but then after a few years it was compromise amen oh i witnessed it in a lot of believers and i witnessed the results of it so i pray the grace of god that brother inaudible if god is going to require total separation it's going to be now the closer we get to the resurrection and the rapture amen so that why so that to god is in total control amen you're totally under the revealed word you're going to stay with the word you're going to focus on the word concentrate on what god has done what god is doing and what god will do amen and brother for god to to do it and for god to move on brother with it he's got you've got to be separated amen he wanted he wanted to do this with abraham wanted to give this to abraham but he had to move his father away he wanted to do this he had to move lot away amen praise the name of the lord brother the separation that god was wanted here god wants here amen why he doesn't want the enemy to to interfere with the word that he's given you to give the faith for the rapture amen oh yeah the devil's the devil is there oh yeah this is the message this is the message this is the message amen but is it bringing the total separation that god wants so that we're going to focus only on what god is doing we're going to focus only on what god wants us to believe for amen like pentecost and all the rest when when god did this oh they just went in and that's all they focused on amen whether it's luther or wesley or the pentecostals amen what god revealed to them that's all they focused on amen and they kept praising the lord well what what what what what what are you praising god for oh the just shall live by faith thank god amen and their lives were wrapped around that revelation amen and the sanctification amen the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit their lives are wrapped around what god was doing amen but brother but what god did was to move him on to what he was going to do amen but the thing of it is that like i said the third or fourth generation amen or they got into what god was doing but then another generation rose up and they were just they were just oh that that's what god did so we thank the lord amen praise the lord and they make a denomination out of it oh we believe this we believe that yeah that's our doctrine that's our creed and so on amen amen but they they they got that intellectually but still they got the influence of the devil in other areas of their life satan is there to influence this influence that oh yeah oh lord i believe your word yeah let the word have control amen no they feel all i gotta do is believe it in my head and so on amen and but then the enemy comes in and starts to influence you he gets you to do this could you do that but god don't want it amen the enemy was trying to influence abraham do this do this do this unto god brought that total separation today abraham heir is the law here's the promised land amen and god is trying to bring that total separation to the bride of christ to the believers amen pointing us to the resurrection and the rapture amen don't don't go back and just just take the letter of it let's brother let's oh my god help us brother totally separated i'm living for the resurrection i'm living for the rapture amen i trust by grace that those that i'm ministering to is living for the resurrection and the rapture amen brother we oh yeah i believe god sent a prophet yeah but if you got into the prophet's word you got into the prophet's message amen i tell you it's the resurrection and rapture and you can't focus on anything else oh he changed this doctrine that doctrine that well that's good amen and god got our attention and god got our focus on the word but then he brought us on up to what he's do what he was what he's doing amen as the prophet said the rapture is already on the rapture is going on now he said amen praise the lord hey oh yeah and he said what god has done and the mysteries that god has revealed he says to give us rapturing faith amen what happened to the other denominations only a day just went back and and made justification a creed they made sanctification of creed they made the gifts and and the anointing and what pentecost did and that became a creed we believe this we believe that amen yeah but what about why did god do it what's he pointing you to does he want to move you on oh yeah yeah well we believe there's going to be there's going to be there's going to be no not going to be it is a resurrection it is the rapture at the prophet of god and i i i might again bring some quotes on these things regarding the rapture he said the rapture is going on all the time and he said the rap and he said what god has done is to give us rapturing faith amen see what's god focusing on just this doctrine or to a lot of people it's the trinity oh yeah we don't believe the trinity there's only one god or a lot of people oh yeah as long as you get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen that is the father that is the son that is the holy ghost amen but it goes beyond that amen why all that god has done is bringing us into a more personal relationship with jesus amen and more personal amen relationship with the word amen praise the lord brother because amen again we're we're getting into a spiritual revelation of who we are a spiritual revelation that we are the sons and daughters of god amen by the grace of god so god elvis amen brother that we're going to allow the revelation to control us amen we're going to allow the revelation to guide us and lead us amen amen so that we're going to do we're going to talk only as the seed of god amen we'll walk as the seed of god we're going to live as the seed of god amen not followers of willem ranum amen not by any maids brother but again there there's too many believers that are just followers of william branham oh yeah and now as i said oh luther became the founder of that religion wesley that religion willing booth that religion pentecostals certain pentecostals that that religion amen and now among the message there's too many or they're the followers of william branham oh yeah god sent william branham william branham william branham no amen brother i tell you william branham wants to get his name out of it and get christ into it oh yeah and again again that's what he said what tremendous because he saw the spirits that were moving among believers amen and he said that's your problem he said you can't see the other angel amen they only saw the angel that stood in the pulpit and that was william branham oh yeah and that's why that brother put that note in his pocket and said oh william brandon is my lord what what what what an influence what what an anointing that was on that brother it wasn't jesus no like i said the prophet said if you keep that up he said i'll leave the ministry. aysan all right he said because you're making me he said antichrist and there's still there's still a lot of believers today that's making william branham antichrist amen brother let's put the focus on jesus amen this brother focus on the word because the prophet did highlight it over and over again that what god has done regarding the mystery of god and the mystery of the word reveal he says to give us faith for the rapture amen and how many are focusing on it concentrating on it they're still focusing on doctrine of this doctrine this doctrine and even the rapture becomes a doctrine amen resurrection is a doctrine oh the yeah this is the what we believe concerning the resurrection is what we believe concerning the rapture no no brother we got to believe what god is doing not what he did amen for the rapture for the resurrection amen and so he said when he read the scriptures now he said i i the thought of god's word calling a total separation amen and i recognize down through the years all the time that i've been around the message and near the message and so on amen that the total separation is what's lacking in a lot of believers they're not totally separated unto the lord amen oh they separated from a denomination and say i believe the message of william branham i believe that the revelation of this mystery of that mystery and so on amen but mainly it becomes doctrine a creed what do you believe oh i believe this oh well we believe we're the bride of christ we believe that god is working on us increasing our faith for the rapture increasing our faith for the resurrection we've got to because brother as we go into the word any man become one with the lord one with his word then the resurrection and the rapture ought to be coming more and more and more real to us more and more precious to us brother because we want it we need it amen only that god wants it god needs it to get us out of time and into eternity why because there's judgment coming and so he's got to get the bride out by grace amen and what we're witnessing today is concerning the coven issue brother it's there's other things going to happen most definitely amen i pray grace amen that we're recognizing this when it comes to all that's going on again it's god allowing it right brother this oh my just constant just think it it's to give us a greater revelation of what god is doing and what the devil is doing amen just saying satan has come down with a great wrath knowing his time is short amen and he's going to do this and he's going to do that god permits this and god is going to permit that amen brother and what and he permits it why to bring out the spirit is on the on this individual that individual and yet to bring out the resurrection and rapturing faith of the bride amen because he said he told us in the word that this is going to happen that's going to happen but he told us that when you see it look up amen brother and what do you mean okay it means that you're you're you're thinking and believing about the rapture and the resurrection amen so when this happens it's going to bring out our faith do we really believe it do we really are we really looking for it or is it just a doctrine in our church amen well if you're the seed of god when all this begins to happen this is falling down on the world that's falling on the world amen then brother we're getting more and more and more conscious or we're at the end come on let's get ready we're going we're leaving get ready for the rapture amen but still but a lot of believers are going to focus more and more on the natural things so we want we want everything to be all right we want everything to be in line we want to have this we want to have that no let it all go amen amen let's let's let's see what god wants to give us let's say what god wants to do in us now oh we think oh i'm going to have faith for this faith for that well yeah that's all you're gonna have that's all you're gonna have what what do you have faith for the rapture well people got more faith for the natural things than you do with spiritual but god is trying to get our attention from the natural to their spiritual amen praise the name of the lord uh brother it's going to make you a oddball yeah thank the lord the brother of god did preach on it oddballs yeah what for because well you're just you're just you're your nature is different your your spirit is different your your doctrines are different it's all spiritual by the grace of god amen and what god has promised and what god is doing just think what god promised he's doing for the end for the bride amen so i pray grace that we're going that not going to be that we are spiritual not religious amen he said god's word calls ray total separation and we only know this is by as we read the word and see the word of god manifest itself well brother he's the word has been manifested in a in a ministry the word has been manifested in believers and brother and god is still doing it he's still manifesting his word in you and in me amen oh he is what's his word look up amen the dead in christ shall rise first then we which our lord remains shall be caught up together with them to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord amen so that's what that's what that's what we're part of that's why god is reflecting in you and reflecting in me amen amen and as believers we should see that spirit in one another amen oh he's living for another world he's focusing on another world he still he can't forget the rapture and he can't forget the resurrection amen and he's only been thirsty again for the saints who have gone on i wonder you know how many is hungry and thirsty for fellowship with sister dunford or brother and sister man your brother sister burns yes sister coffee you know well all depends on how real the revelation is of the resurrection and rapture amen if it's real oh my sister coffee is there sister dunford is there brother sister burns is there yeah jesus said lazarus come forth amen and he that was dead stood on his feet amen brother are we getting to that place oh i tell you it's it's serious it's very challenging amen to call sister coffee sister curly come forth amen and is she going she's going to appear with you she'll stand there in that theophany body and the other brothers and sisters that are going on amen no wonder jesus said to told us concerning the the rapture concerning the resurrection that is that is in the bride amen come forth brother what a faith amen oh my martha or young martha here she said oh lord i know he's going to rise in the resurrection oh yeah that's going to come up there just think but god was going to god was going to put that responsibility in your lap the resurrection that responsibility back there was in jesus lap but through the baptism of the holy ghost amen he puts it in you amen baptism the holy ghost is the baptism of the resurrection and the rapture amen it is praise the lord that's why i pray grace we're not just looking up there for a resurrection looking there oh yeah they're going to be there's going to be a resurrection no it's already the prophet said the rapture's been going on all along amen so that why oh yeah and again there's that spiritual rapture known as the physical that we're caught up in heavenly places in christ jesus amen but the prophet said well that's where the word's revealed and what's that word going to do it's going to give us faith amen going to give us faith for the rapture the physical rapture amen and change of our bodies god help us amen to get beyond just theology and the doctrine of this creed and that creed this creed this this one that one oh yeah well we believe in the oneness of the god and we believe in water what about you in the name of the lord jesus christ and we believe what happened the original sin and all that yeah yeah gracious that we're going to believe out of our hearts amen and believing it's gonna bring forth the faith that god wants us to have now now what they add then what they have now amen and mavis got a greater faith than luther wesley booth the and the pentecostals and they was got a greater faith amen amen they cut them up the revelation that they had and god gave them it caught them up it did caught them up into a heavenly place in christ amen but now brother is catching us up physically they were caught up spiritually and we were caught up spiritually we believe this we believe that amen but we cut up spiritually into a heavenly place in christ amen with a greater testimony and a greater revelation of the natural physical rapture amen how many are really believing for the rapture amen for for though for those that for preach oh god help me a lot of preachers are preaching that well all believers are going into rapture no no jesus always jesus always laid it out in such a way as to put everybody on their guard amen what do to make their calling and their election sure amen i just don't assume because i'm a believer don't assume because i'm this because i'm that because amen oh i believe the message i believe that i believe we're at the end you know so does the devil and that's why you come down with great wrath amen but brother with the revelation we got she gave us great joy great peace great rest amen and great faith what for how many are really looking for the rapture how many wanted how many are hungry for it how many are thirsting for it and crying for it amen living morning noon and night lord will we get to the rapture today will we get to the rapture tonight amen because i believe brother brown said to brother billy paul one time might have been in a dream and and brother branham brother billy paul was in the in the brown tabernacle there somewhere and brother brown came in and he was calling calling for this one calling for that one calling them and come on come on come on and uh it's it's he's he's the coming of the lord and they got into the car and one of them was driving and driving and driving and billy paul saw this all this happened this happened it was the coming of the lord and uh and brother and brother brown mentioned somewhere that he said the lord is going to come he said between i think was six six and nine o'clock in the morning yeah and then i don't know what well which which time zone is that going to be six or nine o'clock because the original time zone starts over there in in australia new zealand amen then it comes and comes and comes going around the world amen so brother sister we should leave that with god because we we don't have that understanding amen six and nine in the morning well we'll be ready in such an hour as you think not amen just be ready regardless morning noon and night we're looking for the rapture amen how god's going to do it i don't know but but again you know we know that it the word that he gives us is going to give us the faith for the change amen it's going to give us the faith to be caught up but just get to get caught up you got to be looking out amen amen amen and that's why god gives us the word and god shows us this god reveals this what for what is to bring out the faith faith comes by hearing the word amen the faith faith for this faith for that well i heard it in the word the word said this god said this god said that the prophet said this the mother said okay amen that's that's why i feel that way that's why i i like i'm looking up and i expect him to rapture now anytime amen because i feel that they're getting closer to us anytime now by the grace of god amen there's some thoughts concerning the resurrection i am not sure what message it is but i do know that that there's i've opened up one book there and on on the left part way down and uh on the right side of the book i'm near the top brother brown is explaining this and then he comes up and he and he highlights it right here again amen pointing back to that grace grace grace for the rapture what's going on what's going to happen to the bride what's what's the bride going to be like amen attended amen i'll tell you right the brave is going to be like jesus brother he got to the place where jesus knew he knew that his hour was come to departure to this world amen and he knew what he had to do and how he was how he would go out of this world and what he had to suffer amen got to the place and i was reading in scripture again last night there and where jesus was pointing again to jerusalem what was going to happen this and this and that and peter got there and peter wouldn't no way you're not going down to jerusalem no and the bible says that jesus took peter and pushed me on pushed him behind him he said get thee behind me satan amen he wasn't as not peter's rebuking it was the devil that was influencing peter's thoughts amen oh yeah i said mine that's that's amazing and yet he was the one that that jesus ordained for the pentecostal message on the day of pentecost amen pray oh my brother is one thing for us to see is another thing for god to see amen so keep your attitude and your spirit right toward one another as the seed of god amen praise the name of the lord keep your spirit right your attitude right and again there's another message on things that i was uh highlighting who were going through what the prophet said concerning the bride and what the bride knew oh yeah and and oh yes there's another preacher i heard on the radio this morning amazing pentecostal yeah in a church that i attended in here for a number of years yeah and there he was preaching and explaining how this is going to happen that's going to happen everybody said we got to come into awareness with jesus and he said praise the name of the lord oh yeah he said we are one with jesus his attitude his spirit is is and his nature and so on and now now you're ready for the rapture by the grace of almighty god and he said oh yeah we we're we're the body of christ christ in us the hope of glory and he was saying yeah he said but he said oh if you're in the body of christ he said you're not going to say the eye is not going to say to the fingers oh i don't need you and he said he said and this part of your body up here your shoulder is not going to say to the to your feet i don't need you no he said oh i'll say to your ears i don't need you no he said we do amen so he said so this has got to be the attitude he said between all the members of the body of christ is you got to respect he said he said up here you got to respect your feet down there defeat's going to respect your head and he said again he said there he said you're going to respect your respect the small finger and the big fingers respect the small one you're gonna you're gonna have to respect your eyelids oh yes he said why because it's all there for a reason amen but and he knew but he said when it comes to christianity and things today he said there's there's that lack of respect amen even wrong so-called christianity he said look down their nose at this one look down at that look down at that one listen he said they're all there for a reason amen he said even your ears need your feet and he said even your hands he said you need your legs amen you need your toes and so on amen let's have respect he said for one another as christians asian amen because he said we are all part of the body of christ amen let's all believe that we're part of the bride of christ amen so we're going to respect this brother respect that sister amen oh yeah they might have again the bible says that there's those with his understanding and this understanding that understanding amen and he said let the strong support the weak amen you're there to encourage one another by the grace of god amen grace brother to me when we when we failed to do that we fail to recognize that we haven't been separated from unbelief we're not believing this not believing that but god moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform amen brother thank god he's not going to move in our way it's his way it's not what not how we do it it's what he how he does it amen and brother yes it's amazing that god separated abraham from his father and god separated abraham a lot from abraham amen god does and all the way if you go through the scriptures you'll find god separating separating separating amen and i'll tell you if there's anything god's got to do and god wants to do what more to take us into the resurrection rapture is bring separation amen by the grace of god because again let me highlight that he calls for a not separation total separation from unbelief amen praise the lord and brother sometimes that you you'll feel that spirit in a non in a believer professing believer amen but like i said whereas one time i was associated with a with a with a gentleman and he was an anglican man and oh and he would come and to get something that we had there for him in the natural and oh and he was he was getting i guess he was my age and he was in his 70s at the time and i said oh i said god bless you and oh he was oh he was spiritual i said spiritual and yeah i said rather i knew it and he said he said god bless you and thank you he said for your encouragement to keep believing and keep pressing on and just basic as the lord would reveal it to me and so on and uh and like i said another time he came and he handed me handed me that envelope and i opened the envelope and it was a it was tithing and 300 check for tithing i said what i said oh i'll send that overseas no no no he said it's for you he said i want to thank you for what you've done for me and he said you've helped me oh i said that's good praise the lord he said praise the lord amen thank you he was spiritual like i said i said what church do you attend he said my church are on topsail beach and he said i go down there every day sit and i walk over that rock and i get up on that rock and i pray and i worship the lord amen oh i said god bless you he was spiritual amen of course a few months later a couple years later we did hear him and he was the lord took him on he was gone amen but amen but i couldn't say i i don't need him no god i got adam there for a reason oh for a reason to be a witness and he was a witness to the church he attended oh yeah because the number of the people come and say oh it's wonderful praise the lord they said you ought to be the preacher and not your brother his brother was with a pastor or not or a clergy and uh and not him but but other members of the church would come and say you you should be preaching why because they recognize that anointing and that spirit on them that revelation that understanding that he had this oh i believe that they saw the anointing of god in his life amen and when it comes to witnessing old is wonderful yeah and then and to them concerning the word of god he was spiritual and it's like i said when i was going back and forth to the glenbard lodge and brother then there were there was a brother that used to come to the chapel in a wheelchair but after a while he couldn't come because he was bedridden but i had to go see him after the chapel and again this was the last time i saw him and was one time then one of the nurses there came in and she said pastor he wants to see you in his room and i went up to see him and praise the lord and he was anglican you know and and he said oh brother she he said i want you to pray for me and he said the grace of god and he said lord be with me he said because he knew he was going and i and he showed me his bible and he said brother he said that's me right there law in the bible i said as you yes he said right there and when i went and read that scripture and he said i said yes brother i said that's who you are i knew he wasn't part of the bride i felt he wasn't by the bride but he he said i'm i'm among that group right there i said you are and it was in the book of revelation amen i said god bless you he said brother he said i want you to pray for me and i said well brother he said i said praise the lord i said oh my i said i wouldn't expect this i said for somebody like your religion that you come from and i and he had his bible here and all he had that underlined this underlined that underlined oh i said wonderful oh he said listen he said my bible he said when i lived home my bubba was always on my table and he said when anybody come in he said brother regardless of where our conversation started it ended on the word oh yeah he said and there's some family members didn't like it he said because they felt i was too too religious he was not religious he was spiritual amen i said okay brother you're right oh he said i would always highlight this and point out this and part of that the grace of god and the love of god what god did for us what god's doing for us amen so he said brother pray for me because he felt he was going home and i pray for him committed to the lord amen not long after that he was gone amen amen praise the lord i believe he's in that other dimension now in a theophany body hallelujah and he's gathered together with all those that that believed like he believed whatever revival that he was uh identified with that's who he's with amen it's like when we go beyond the curtain of time it'll be believers for the last day amen probably god said and he said those that were living in luther's day and believe in luther's message to gather with them and the others gathered with the pentecostals gathered with this amen but during the resurrection of the rapture we're all coming together amen the bride is going to be in the city the others outside the city hallelujah oh brothers let's have a right attitude right spirit because they're not all bright amen amen thank god we are we believe we're part of the bride but to believe that there's going to be all of those there's going to be people out there now they're not raptured no no no no one going to rapture but they're going to be there outside the city god said god amen i praise grace amen that we'll be in the city and they outside the city but again the prophet of god did say you're gonna be surprised who made it and you'll be surprised who didn't make it amen so you know what we got you know what that means keep your attitude great keep your spirit right amen the finger if your head makes it your face your fingers are going to make it if your head makes it your your feet are going to make it and so on in a glorified body praise the lord and that's what that minister this morning on the radio was preaching on he says all these parts in the body amen so he said brother he said listen he said they're still part of the body you're part of the body they're part of the body he said they might be feet or they might be toes he said you might feel that you're you're you're the head or the other the eyes or the or the hearing but he said even that what's down there is still part of the body and he said the body needs defeat amen so god of grace be with us i'll tell you this just like that i don't know i guess maybe some of you have seen him on on the internet the gentleman that's born without arms born without legs yeah i think he's in his thirties now and he's and he's preaching the gospel what preaching yes he's preaching oh yeah he's not upon up he's not on a platform and with a pulpit no no they just bring him in and put him up on a table yeah and oh praise the lord amen and even the bible is always on the table the bible's on the table and he'll go and he's only got he's only got part of one foot just a part of it it doesn't look like feet or foot or toes nothing like that but it's perfect there and he'll go and with that foot he'll open the bible yeah he's gone even to prisons and preached you know he'd been around the world and preached yeah amen brother but he didn't he didn't just give everything up and feel um no i can't do nothing in this world i can't do this i can't do that no no no he's right there praise the lord shouting him giving the glory to jesus thank you jesus and i discovered now that he's he's married and i have three or four children yeah yeah two or three children praise the lord i thought god bless him amen he showed me there somewhere because i tell you dear so-called christians brother would even even you know we wouldn't add the losses that he got amen wouldn't be in the in the in the body like he got amen and they're using that excuse they can't do this i can't do that amen brother he'll rise in judgment against many that god wanted to do this god wanted to do that amen and but they were never like him but he's there with praising the lord he's there with joy and peace oh yeah i love it he said you know to god be the glory amen brother how many he did i believe he could he could he could do it what he could say not my will father thine be done oh yeah but just think and not only that just to think he's not only born into the world with that and no arms and no legs amen but born into the world where he can't do anything hardly he don't have he don't have arms here to do it don't have hands there to do it he don't have feet there to do it except that that little bit of a toll we got there our foot and and and still quote thanking god thank you lord oh praise the lord i'm going to do this for your glory amen going to preach for your glory and here he is preaching to thousands and thousands and thousands of people around the world amen so i god bless him amen we look forward to seeing him somewhere amen amen but he'll have you'll have arms and he'll have legs amen blessing glory oh yes his attitude is absolutely tremendous when it comes to spiritual he loves the lord and he loves to see the sons and daughters of god he loves the seed of god amen he wants to do the will of god amen lord even though i'm in this condition i'm going to do it for you praise the lord oh we look down our noses at him oh he can't do anything what well he's doing a lot around the world amen praise the lord introducing jesus to a lot to a lot of people not not abraham not lot no not that lot with abraham no not not by any means amen because he was he wasn't really there just get the will of god he wanted his will oh he professed to believe god amen and lot was there and the angels there was two angels there ministering to them and to this do this do this amen and and and and lot and and his wife so they got out of the city they got out of the city but she she something come on her and she turned to look back to see what was going on you shouldn't do it don't look back we're out of it leave it let god deal with it and yeah she became a pillar of salt it's like i said your boat when we were when we were in in israel and we were at the at a hotel there where we met a meal and then we went back we went back and it was the dead sea and uh and there was further up there was pillars of salt and i did ask the the the jewish tour guide there and i said i said oh i said is that where lot's wife was she turned to a bill or something he said lost wife he said that's her up there he said she's there she's still there and i said oh she is oh yes she's one of those pillars there he said yeah thank god grace grace grace don't the bible that's why god ordained god give us that warning remember lot's wife don't look back to what you came out of don't look back amen no to what god is judging no move on keep moving on god gives you this revelation move on amen but it's too many looks back and they become a denomination exactly god have mercy on us oh sorry i was only attending just to read the quotes but god wanted me to say other things so god bless you and god bless those online amen so i'll just share a few of the quotes with you and the lord willing on wednesday our brother jonathan carlitt will be ministering to us amen and i thought i said lord i'll just get up and just talk about some of these things and i said give some quotes and i'll finish it i said so i don't have to go into part two but god got a dozen parts praise the lord so let me leave you again with the understanding that what god requires in you and in me god's looking for total separation from unbelief and sometimes you got to bring total separation from friends yeah it does you keep your attitude right your spirit right you know but you don't go out of your way if they want if they want to go out of their way and and have some fellowship with you that's one thing but not you go out of their way by the grace of god or it takes the anointing of the holy ghost but he said god separated the light from the darkness in creation so he said the word of god began to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning so does it remain till this day and he said e being the word said knowest thou not that i must be about my father's business amen and he says so the word is always corrective and always right and the word will correct every wrong always amen and he said god separated the light from the darkness and it's been doing that ever since separating light from darkness amen he's separating light from darkness naturally and spiritually in our lives by the grace of god he said even the water was separated from the land amen he said god speaks every word with a meaning and something that he is trying to achieve and will achieve by his word and he's when god says anything he must back up what he says amen and when the word of god has been vindicated amen vindicated he said it is light now he said the word itself isn't light until it's vindicated light in your word in your life amen so what is your life reflecting to your family friends and neighbors there's your family friends and neighbors to see it see something spiritual oh mom's spiritual dead spiritual they're always talking about the lord they're always praying and doing this and so on lord jesus watch what what is it this this and this yeah so brother what are we reflecting what is peop like those that you work with do they recognize you're a christian do they see that that different christian life in you if you are a christian they will see it oh yeah not they would agree with all that do you do and don't do amen but they'll recognize oh he's a christian god help us yessiree he said when god says anything he must back up what he says and when the word of god has been vindicated the word has been vindicated it's light amen vindicated with your life it's going to come forth in your life your attitude your spirit and he said when that promise is vindicated then that is light that's the light of the day when the word is vindicated the word for the hour is vindicated and it's in you you're going forth and vindicating the the the revelation of the bride those who are going into rapture resurrection and they're going to see in you that total separation from unbelief but you still in in it they still recognize that you got a right spirit and a right attitude yeah they do know that oh yeah that they're christians i know that because they got a nice spirit nice attitude they're very friendly amen grace of god and you know it's like i've experienced it and a couple of gentlemen that i've met over the years and they weren't weren't christians i remember i'll always remember that once one time i was in fellowship or conversation with one of them and we're just starting with natural things and got to the place where he was getting caught up with this car with that and he and he swore and he cursed a couple times and oh and we only a matter of seconds he stopped oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry he said forgive me he said i didn't mean to do that he said you're a christian and he said i shouldn't be doing that he said in the presence of christians i said okay i said i forgive you and he said thank you oh yeah just think if he and if he was that conscious a conscious are we to be as christians of what we're presenting god help us and again as i was working again in the military with the military and uh and i was walking through the kitchen and i was doing something going to do this going to do that and again this elderly he was an older man at the time and he said oh excuse me excuse me excuse me and i said yes i said what's the problem well he said no problem he said just wanted to tell you he said i know you're a christian oh you do oh yes he said i know he says he said it's your spirit and your attitude i appreciate that so he said he said i just want to let you know although i didn't tell it to him i don't know who he was or what it was but he just wanted to tell him god help us amen god bless him for sure now if they recognize god in you god bless them amen he said when the promise is vindicated then that that is light vindicated in you and it's when the word is vindicated the word for the hour is vindicated amen praise the lord we're not re we're not reflecting what happened 100 years ago 200 years ago we're reflecting what god is doing not what he did the rapture the resurrection amen luther went on justification justification justification trying to get others to to to see it and to believe it pentecostal went on with the baptism and the gifts got trying to get others to see it and experience it experience it and now is moving on to the rapture and the resurrection by the grace of god amen encouraging others to experience the resurrection and the rapture what an experience that we have i pray god that you got that experience of the resurrection in your heart and you had the quicken made alive spiritually what's that's what we need to focus on our spiritual life amen you at the and made alive and we and you at the raptured and brought up to the up to christ amen what for to get the revealed word to give you faith amen to give you faith so that you're going to be resurrected and raptured into a body a glorified body amen amen he said in genesis he said god separated life from death and if we believe the word of god it's the word of life to us but if we question the word of god it's death to us don't question it believe it accept it let it digest in your soul amen he said god also had an atonement be merciful to us he accepted a substitute death for their death and he separated life from death in the garden of eden he did it by his word and he is still speaking his word of life to those who want to believe it amen you recognize what you need and it's by the word jesus has constantly told us that there is a separation and we find that the last thing that is that's predicted to the human race before the great and final day when we ascend into the presence of god there will be a final separation and he will separate the sheep from the goats amen and god will continually has been separating separating and that's what he's doing tonight he said amen that's what he always does he said he separates faith from unbelief amen and now as we find out in the numbers the sixth chapter that an azerite call was to separate themselves from all the world to the word of god that is a nazarite call separation amen it is total separation and we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but claim only unto god amen and jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world the cares of this world she is separated from fashions of this modern age that we live in i've noticed now that even believers are getting more caught up with the fashions of this world because i've i've been into certain public buildings and i see the people going and common going to come and i've even seen just the worldly people out there i guess and i've seen the old seniors old and i said what what's she dressed like that for you know even though even the old people are caught up just shows that where what it's insane because the word prophet said the world is going to go insane and all that's going on in the world today is insanity yeah and i said it's unbelievable i said my you would never see an old woman dressed like that and not only in her clothing but even her hair the way she had her hair and i said what i said oh she must be crazy she's got to be insane you know because ordinarily you just see senior citizens you see them you know they might dress worldly but it's just basic clothes but not the foolishness that that lady had on oh yeah it was it absolutely amazed me and knowing that i'm seeing like like like in their hair do they they're hairstyles no i said lord i said that's insanity well because your hair is just you know all out over here all out over there pushed over here oh dear hanging out there hanging out somewhere else that's insanity and not only that but now you see believers acting that way and some of the clothes that believers put on is just just crazy and and their hair cells it's just crazy it's not a style it's anything but a style yeah amazing i trust by grace of god that you've got that revelation and you're walking through this world and you see this and see that i trust by grace you're going to have the revelation that it's insanity amen so i pray the grace of god to give the believers amen our sisters a holy ghost revelation to keep it normal keep your hearing off just keep it normal god have mercy help us amen he says and the husband and the wife is one he said so the bride of christ and christ is one the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride so amen so i pray the grace of god to our sisters that'll be the word in simplicity amen living through them praise the lord the word and our brothers amen god in simplicity living through you oh yeah praise the lord amen brother it's like all again someone highlighted about faith and laying that lane out of hands and brother brown was was reminded to lay hands all because they said oh in the bible jesus laid hands on this one this one laid hands on that one they were healed this brother brown said yes that's right and uh but he said there was the centurion and it says he said jesus i'm not worthy you come under my roof speak the word only brother brown said see speak the word only he said he never found such great faith no not in israel god help us to have that great faith amen speak the word only and he said my servant whole servant today they become more with their with their sons and daughters mothers and fathers grandmother grandfathers but that was a centurion's roman soldier and his servant was sick nigh unto death my that centurion he had a nice spirit oh oh he he felt right and why because his heart was going out to his service servant maybe his servant's family and so on and all mine and so he when he heard that jesus was over there somewhere oh he he went he went out look find jesus and he called on jesus yeah and jesus said you have great faith i haven't found so great faith no not in israel would he find such great faith in newfoundland speak the word only and my servant will be healed and he was amen grace of god the prophet highlighted that again he says see great faith amen do we have great faith for the resurrection great faith for the rapture speak the word only amen hallelujah he said the only credential that a believer has is the word of god living in him amen declaring jesus christ lives in that person that's a separated nazarite unto the lord separated for the word's sake he said the first adam he says separated himself from the word to his wife now he could have stayed with the word if he wished to but he separated himself from the word to wish with his wife why because he believed that redeeming him god would redeem his wife now that's exactly what the common carnal church member does today separates themselves from the true living word to hold to their church but god help us to separate from the church stay with the word amen god be with us let me finish with this now he should the first man separate himself the first adam from the word to go with his wife and question whether god kept his word or not what a perfect type of the lukewarm carnal-minded believer today that still wants to cling with what their tradition says instead of taking what the word says amen god help us to stay with the word amen i want to finish right there amen and i thought i would be able to do it one service but we'll wait till maybe another service or two god help us we're living in a spiritual warfare definitely don't let the devil win i pray god by the holy ghost is going to win the victory over over our senses in our flesh amen so that we're going to walk in the spirit amen not in the flesh god's grace lord bless you amen let's pray god's grace to give us the revelation of total separation from unbelief pray lord is there anything yet in my life that you want me to separate from grace grace grace amen let's let's say number 437 sing them over again to me wonderful words of life and let me
