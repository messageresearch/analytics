welcome us all to the service this morning and pray the lord bless you amen in the going forth of the word and i pray god bless you in the receiving of the word amen and the lord willing this morning we're going to hear the prophet of god minister and the sermon that we that i've chosen it is a part of the revelation of jesus christ amen and when it was first published it was published as who is william branham and so that wasn't the correct title and of course the brother brown takes a very serious stand here in this message concerning well the revelation of jesus christ and and now they've entitled it uh bruce serpent well he gets in there and he begins to highlight the the attitude of the people and even in his own tabernacle as i've said there's too many times that the prophet god has had to rebuke branham tabernacle he's had to rebuke a lot of the believers there because of their attitude and because of the spirit that they had not just toward the word not jewish toward the message but toward him amen and he does highlight it again here in this message that the the idea and the thoughts that they were saying about william branham oh he really took his stand and he was he was very very very serious and of course he did before and he did here i believe i like that he maybe would would leave the ministry why because of the attitude that people had because of what people were thinking about him and he said no he said you do that you're going to make me antichrist and he said i'm not going to do that he said he would step out of the ministry if they insisted on it oh yeah he took a serious stand so brother and i'll tell you this he'd be taking a serious stand in this hour too oh yes after all these years since he's been gone amen and and god is still requiring of us the message oh yes you're requiring of us to reveal word so brother what is our attitude now toward the word not just back then but what is our attitude now after uh well almost 60 years since well yeah 60 years since he ministered this one so and it's been almost way around i guess 55 years since the god has called him uh yeah more than that quite a quite a number of years off the scene so where's what what faith do we have now amen god was looking for a great faith then he's looking for a greater faith now when we consider all that we have heard and all that we have read and concerning the message of the hour oh brother the bible god did i like and he said back way back in the in in the early 60s again he said now he said i know he said that this message he said is not striking your right amen it's just not striking me right well even what concerning what concerning what god had done concerning what god was doing and concerning our are facing the reality of the hour that we're living or it didn't really strike them then is it really striking that's not now concerning the end concerning that it's over concerning that it is finished amen concerning that god has brought his last message to the gentiles amen that there's not another revival coming no no brother we're supposed to be in the bride revival that's taking us into the rapture taking us into the resurrection so brother how is the word that was the message of the hour striking you amen brother i trust by grace that we're not just like any denomination and as i said all this this oh this is a creed uh we believe this and they get another message book oh we believe that we believe this and to a lot of believers there's no more than a creed that's right but to the right it's faith to the right it's absolutely real genuine faith they got a revelation of what god is doing amen not just what he did two too many this is what he did 1961. yeah when he preached the series on the revelation of jesus christ oh yeah and and first when it was printed they printed the the title who is william branham well he wouldn't he wouldn't appreciate that not by any means right and again the they they also printed it and they read this one right here and and they've entitled it bruised serpent no that's not what he preached on not the brute serpent not who is william branham no no it was revelation chapter 5 and it's the revelation of god revelation of christ in these last days amen so what revelation do you have of jesus what does jesus mean to you amen to many it's not jesus as william branham oh he too really took his stand against it and he blasted it oh yeah threatening to leave the ministry if they kept up saying oh william branham it was jesus william ran him as the united messiah william branham is there no he said he was just a messenger amen oh yeah because again he said that's why he said that the message is not striking you right he said because he says not striking me right well that was william branham himself that was the messenger amen how did he know that amen by by the attitude action reaction of the people oh yeah he knew it should do this it should do that but they were just getting just getting in involved in william branham just getting involved you know they wanted william branham why they wanted william branham for more of the signs and wonders amen not the word not the message but again brother when when he was commissioned he was he was commissioned he was ordained to get the people to believe the message to believe the word amen he said go do this go to he said i'll give you this sign i'll give you that sign he said get the people to believe amen and not just a sign but to get their attention to the word and get them to believe the word so brother sister are we believing the word are we believing the message are we believing what god has done we have praise the lord good are we believing what he's doing amen oh there's too many still caught up with what he's done because they they they didn't get into it the the living word the living revelation no no brother because if you really get into it you really recognize what god did you know what he's doing like why because what he did is pointing us on to what he's doing amen and what he's doing is going to move us on to what he will do and brother there's only one thing left and that's the rapture the only one thing left that's the change of our bodies we want to get out of here by the grace of almighty god amen so brother how much do you want to get out of here oh the the there's it's a generation that's hungry and thirsting for this i'm going to 13 for that oh they want this they want this they want that they make sacrifices oh yes to get what they want naturally are we making sacrifices to get what we need spiritually right brother amen but i'll tell you if anything we need now is the rapture anything we need is to get out of time and into eternity by the grace of god amen and the lord willing that will be after the this message for sure and after our brother minister son goes to stephen after he ministers that brother from british columbia ministers uh over the weekend amen then i want to come back and minister on two things and the lord just sort of laid on my heart after i heard our brother jonathan minister there the the three times i believe it was yeah and it struck me yeah so i want to i want to minister on it and i light it amen bring it to our attention what going from eternity to time and then going from time back to eternity amen oh yeah and highlight it and and and to to give us to get the revelation that the prophet was highlighting amen and you know he he drew him he drawn since and uh well back then he had a big board standing up in front of the pulpit and he just went and he and he drew this big circle on it he said that's eternity and then he drew down below like this he said this is time he said we come from trinity to time and this all happened in time now this is where we are right now he said going back to eternity amen so i want to get in and highlight some of those things again by the grace of god amen as the lord was and like i said brother of my heart conviction as our brother jonathan was ministering oh my say lord grace to us amen brother we amen we got the revelation of going from eternity to time now what about going from time to back to eternity amen because there's a beginning there's an end of time amen brother there's an alpha and there's an omega oh he's the beginning and the end oh yeah beginning into what it's not the beginning and end of jesus not the beginning and end of god no no it's a plan purpose pattern amen the beginning of it the end of it amen so brother let's see what where it all began let's see what he was doing let's see what what he's doing what to get back to eternity brother that's why he asked job he said where were you where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth where were you when i did this where were you and i did that sure he was he's supposed to be back there amen but you're so caught up with time brother don't lose the revelation of eternity no indeed and thing oh just waiting for god went no god's waiting for you amen god's in eternity waiting for you amen yeah the angels of god waiting for you to come back home home yeah brother praise the name of the lord brother don't let like our brother sisters here from africa from other parts of the world don't focus on that country you come from no no no no no not by any means god's focusing on getting you back with getting us all back in the same place you me amen whether we're here in newfoundland where you're no matter what part of the world you're in let's get it i ordered the united states let's get little brother let's get back let's get back home and home is not canada home is not africa home is not india amen no amen almost eternity he said a new heaven a new earth amen new and brother brown said that the earth is going to be white there we're born again he said the earth is going to be born again he said from the inside out amen and the old earth he said god is going to throw it into the sun and he said it's going to burn from the inside out and he said oh pull it back and everything's going to be purged all sin is going to be gone amen praise the lord amen god help us brother the focus on eternity what do you want to do what's more important to you is what's going on in this whole world foolishness craziness well i'll tell you if you if you got the experience of eternity oh my time you're sick yeah and you're like jesus how long shall i be with you i want to get out of here amen why because he came down he was up there he came down he was he was still there he had a he had a representation in eternity he said no man has sent it up he that came down even is not a man who is in heaven amen we are in heaven amen we just need we just need to get out of this this link here and getting to get into the eternal one by the grace of god amen and brother the ministry of the word is ordained to give us that faith not not just oh i believe the message and god said this god said that god did this god did it yes brother why what is he accomplishing in us why he did it amen he did it to give us this faith he give us give us that faith not just faith what he did is faith in what he's going to do by the grace of god to get us out of time into eternity elvis lord to be spiritual by the grace of god amen so we'll go in and hear the prophet minister and they've got this booklet here entitled bruised serpent but what it is he's just re he's just ministering on revelation chapter five yeah and that that's his that's his title and that that's what he's he's focusing on amen not who is willing branham and uh not necessarily bruce serpent but no it's getting out of time into eternity get back let's surrender to god by the grace of god amen and again this is part one july june the 11th 1961 it was on a sunday morning amen so again if you have the booklet you might be entitled bruce servant but again don't focus on that focus on the revelation amen for the bride to give us the faith that pleases god amen and again uh i've got our brother matthew there to do it to start and focus on paragraph 12 and uh to move on again to near the end but not totally right at the end but i think it's where the brother prophet prays after the sermon and commits everything to the lord amen so god of all grace be with us in the going forth of his word amen please i pray let into that thing not ears no no not ears no god's not interested in these ears let them that hath an ear from where's that ear it's in your heart that's right amen too many are just hearing with these ears no no the devil ears with them too but i tell you the devil got more revelation than a lot of people that profess to be believers he does he has come down like i said look at the faith look at the faith that the devil got he's come down knowing his time is short how about you do you know your time short in time so you're going to get back to eternity by the grace of god amen we come from eternity we're going back to eternity amen to our young brothers and sisters in christ hallelujah let's stand and sing only believe as we go to hear the prophet of god amen all

soul body and spirit well glory it's all for your grace our lord for our grace lord from you for your glory your honor your praise oh hallelujah thank you jesus grace in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen god bless you may be seated as we start the message again the title here it is revelation chapter five part one and uh they've entitled of course bruce serpent we want to get to hear the word that'll give us the faith for the resurrection amen i was sitting talking to my loyal little friend here in the city of medical doctor sam adair and he said how are you doing bill and i said all pretty fair i suppose doc i said yourself and he said oh a lot of patients that have had 15 examinations this afternoon i said well that's good as long as it's this examinations and finding nothing wrong i said you know we got talked about back when we were boys and i said well doc i don't know just how long i'm going to be around we're both in our 50s and he said that's true bill i said but all these years about 31 years of ministry now i have kept my heart prepared for that hour when he comes so it doesn't matter when he comes so he said that is true i said the greatest thrill i have is living for others and he said that's what life is makes life real it's when you not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others that's when you're really living and if there happens to be someone among us who has never did that tried to live for somebody else give that a try and you'll see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life and you'll find that it's more blessed than riches or anything all it can be the thought of is what you can do for someone else to make life's burdens which life in itself is a burden and it will make it a little lighter for someone else you just don't know the joy unless you've tried it once to do something for someone else then that uh brings me a thinking of 31 years will be soon of ministry for the lord and i guess every man thinks of some time when he has to come to his last service and come to his uh last hour and look back down the path and see what has been accomplished see what's went on have you did anything and if i just said it's what you do for others that counts i often wonder what would be when i got to the end of my road which we don't know what time that will be none of us so i thinking about looking back down along the trail or i've come to life and seeing the different hills and briar patches and rocks and hard places and smooth runnings and what i did in those kind of times it'll all show up one of these days at the hour am i going away and it'll do that on each one of us we will all be sure of that that it'll it'll show up to each one when that time comes and that brings me or leads me to say something that i would rather run than say amen it leads me to say something that i it grinds my heart to the bottom to say it but what i say i am forced to say realizing that this is being taped in the world here but i have uh left the ministry for uh a cause that i'm sorry that i have to leave far and perhaps many of you have heard it i closing my office and so forth and leaving the field i don't know where our lord will lead me to and that i have no control of or whatever he will have for me to do but i'm thinking at the end of the road where i must come down along life's journeys i have made so many mistakes that i am very sorry from my heart off because of i guess being human in weakness and so forth causes a person to do things or say things that and even act that they would not want to act otherwise but being the weakness of a human being while we we have those times but there if there's anything that has been in my heart to do was to hear those words of our lord jesus at the end of this journey to say it it was well done [Music] my good and faithful servant and many times i have said i'd like to been standing there when he said come unto me but i did desire to hear it say well done that i did not hear the voice in the original sake come unto me back in the times of the writing of the bible but i do desire to hear it say well done and if anything i always wanted to be and desires in my heart to be was a true servant to jesus christ my lord and savior i want my testimony to be clean clear cut that i stood in all my mistakes i yet loved him with all my heart and i do that this morning with all my heart and because of that it forces me to say i'm leaving the ministry is because that there is something arose up amongst the people that's caused me to do it that is that i have been taken from a bracket of a minister our brother and been called jesus christ and so uh call and that would brand me as an antichrist and i'll meet god as a quitter before i would meet him as an anti-christ to take away from him uh i heard of it a few years ago and i thought it was a joke and i met a couple brethren which i don't see neither one of them in the meeting this morning two or three of them one time in a fishing trip and they approached me by the subject of saying brother branham aren't you the anointed messiah the christ and i put my arms around the neck of both brethren or all of them and i said brethren as much as i have tried to be a true servant of christ i would not that you would say such a thing as that and if it would ever be set off me then i will leave the field with a clear conscience and you who do that will be responsible for every soul that i would have saved during that time see for taking me from the field and i thought that ended it and i heard it a few more times but it wasn't so and the other day in canada a brother showed me a little ticket of a thing he's packed in his pockets that william branham is our lord baptizing in the name of william branham and a little a precious fib in an enemy if he'd been my enemy i would have known it was a joke but a precious darling brother come up to confess his sins and his wrongs and his faith in me as being jesus christ and i have got letters at home and calls from chicago and different places asking me if i believe that dogma now i got all kinds of letters that's come in the last few days and calls from different places so uh saying that i was christ brethren that is a horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil [Music] i am your brother now that would run any person from the field that would make anyone that loves christ run from the very thing i went to the lord here not long ago when i first heard it about a year ago and then i went to the lord and he referred to me to the scripture that when john came forth of preaching that they hadn't had a prophet on the earth for so many years until it would uh there's all amazed in their hearts thinking maybe john was the messiah so then i john they went and asked him and he said that he was not you read that luke the third chapter 15 first and so then but that kind of quietened down so i let it go like that but then when it comes to this then i know that something must be done now i say this that the visions and the angel of the lord that appeared at the river if this is to be my last message or last thing to the church to the world those things are truth as far as the age of the lord and i stood still if people call me a prophet many times because the prophet in the english testament is just a preacher a prophesier foreteller of the word and so forth i'd stand for that because you could just kind of push that down but when it comes to be calling anointed christ or something that was too much for me so i just couldn't stand that and so then about i come after leaving the meeting at canada i found out that way up in the eskimos or the indians up there it got among them and so it just tore me all up in the hunting trip that i had planned so long i could not take it i was afraid of a hunting accident if you understand what i mean i got so shaky worse than i am standing here now and i just couldn't stand it any longer to think that 31 years of ministry went down the devil's gutter pipe into the when i'm gone what would it say there he is that's exactly what it was all the influence that i had upon the people then you see where to be i'd be an antichrist now i just couldn't stand it i thought i'd rather die here in the woods like i fell on my gun or something and and i seen i was then i thought about my little joseph and so forth that had to be raised and i was no condition to hunt so i just left the woods and come home and i've been for about eight or ten days and such a fix out of i thought i was losing my mind and i just asked everybody to stay away from me and let me alone because i'm in such a fix and nervous and upset and all toward the pieces and i wondered if it would have been some enemy of mine it would have been all right but i would just laugh at it went on but when it come to be precious brothers precious sisters then that's what hurt me and i said lord the great things too great for me i'll just have to walk out leave it in your hands i i don't know nothing else to do a few nights ago to make it sure i had a visitation from the lord and i seen a precious one a baby a serpent which was yellow and black and telling me and right along and the thing struck me on the leg but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect on me and i looked down there's where been bit before and i turned quickly with a gun and shot the thing and it hit it right in the middle of the thing and the brother said i've turned with my gun to shoot its head off and he said don't do that just pick up the stickling in their body you want to turn my back to pick up the stick it wiggled into some water just a small puddle of water i said well it can't hurt very much longer now because i believe the brother realizes the brethren that what would happen i said it it's morally wounded so it'll die and i asked many of my members of my church here in this tabernacle with brother neville and i has come approaching me with that same question brothers sisters haven't i tried to be a true servant of christ before you i'm not trying to be your brother wherever it is it's a spirit on precious people many people has asked me that but it's it's a spirit but i hope that today that it receives a deadly wound and will die out quickly so i can return back to the ministry until then i'll ask you each one pray for me i don't know what i'll do not place up for sale i just can't stand it i i stay around i'll go completely start mad and i ask you pray for me and remember if you've ever believed me if you've ever believed me to be a servant of christ remember that is an era it's falsely thus saith the lord it is wrong have nothing to do with it i am your brethren let us bow our heads heavenly father my flesh is trembling my hands are squeezing together my toes are drawn up in my shoes oh god be merciful what have i ever done lord to deserve this i pray that you'll be so merciful to me lord and to all and up there and that precious darling people may they see their air on what they have did lord to break the heart of their brother and to not only the brother but our savior our heavenly father i pray that you forgive us of our era's law let the holy blood of christ now draw our us beings together lord and blessed be the tithe that binds our hearts in christian love and fellowship god made the enemy that approached our brothers and our sisters may it receive the deadly wound that cannot exist any longer may it just die away lord when you do that father i'll return back to the field again but until then lord i am your heartbroken servant waiting waiting it's beyond anything i could do with tears and with crying and with persuading i tried lord hard you know my heart to stop it before it got that far but it went beyond anything i could do so father i committed into your hands from this pulpit to where i preached for all these years i committed into your hand now you see to it father in your own divine way and when it's all finished and everything is over then thy servant shall return until then i'll be waiting to hear from you lord bless us now and give us a great service today as we're here not all together for this but just to make it clear publicly before the world that they might know father that i love you and believe you and have stood for you and and want to if i have to go let me go lord with a clean heart and a real record i believed you and trusted you granted and i'll praise thee and we will give thee glory through all ages that is to come through jesus christ amen thank you however in the scriptures let us turn in the bible to the i thought this morning it would be a good thing if brother neville don't mind all right just to continue on for a few minutes in now i don't let me hear it one more time mentioned among any of you just pray and keep it out shut it off see uh don't i i'm i'm 52 years old but i think maybe if god spares me i've got a little life left and i want to spend every ounce of my time for christ amen so remember i'm leaving because i'm driven to do it now in the book of the revelations in the fourth chapter where we left off the other day when we were in the study revelations the fourth chapter i believe at the last part of the verse of the chapter we'll have how many likes revelation wonderful now i believe we quit at the fifth the fifth chapter that we we left off the fourth chapter the four living creatures now let's approach the word now forgetting those things are in the past father god you help us now as we are nervous but we approached the word forgetting that which is in the past we press now to the mark of the high calling amen high calling of the ministry to be a servant to christ give us the word this morning and feed our hungry souls for we are longing lord and waiting for that precious anointing of the holy spirit come among us lord thank you for giving our sins and trespasses and letting us be your servants for we ask that in jesus name amen now we talk the church ages the last seven church ages and then um now i believe some of them are trying to go write this up the church ages then we come into the fourth chapter of the book of the revelation of what is this the revelation of jesus christ the revelation called in the latin the apocalypse which means to be revealed taking the the cover off of to show to expose to bring out the revelation of jesus christ which was is and shall come the root and offspring of david now in the fourth chapter we find out that john was caught up into heaven actually seen the church ages just giving a little background now and then we'll maybe be best to read a few verses of the fifth chapter and then we'll start writing with the background and i saw in the right hand of him that set up on the throne a book written within and the backside seal was seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and of wept because no man was found worthy to open and read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the line of the tribe of the of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof and i'll be held in low in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb and it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth unto all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on the throne that's the first seven verses now now in the third chapter of revelations we find the ending up of the church age which ended with the lady austin the lukewarm church age then we find out that immediately after that john was caught up in the spirit up into the heavens and he saw things that was and was to come and things that had been now we find out the church doesn't appear anymore until the 19th chapter of revelations and she returns with her lord amen gloriously washed in the blood now in this last quotation for a little background to get set where john is now we found out that in the last message i was just briefly looking over it yesterday some of the context that i'd spoken on and john was carried up into heaven and saw those things and i noticed in there that he gave me a revelation that you know after his resurrection manny was with him and some said what will happen to this man that's leading up on your bosom john jesus turned and said what is it to thee if he carries till i come amen so he never then there when a doctrine out see how easy can start everyone are doctoring out that john wasn't going to die until he seen jesus coming until the second coming the bible said there's a doctrine went out of that hobby it jesus never said it that way he said what is it to you if he carries till i come now we find out that he was lifted up into the heavens and saw from then until the coming of the lord as though he had been there and seen it all happen john himself did not live he lived to be 90 something years old and then died and a natural death the only one of the apostles after coming from his exile from our apartments now there's one outstanding point that i would i think they've taken my the blackboard down but i would like to emphasize on a little before we strike this vital thing oh this is glorious a wonderful wonderful chapter and then the very next chapter begins with opening up these seals oh my then we have to skip from there and go different places in the bible to get these seals when they open and what the mysteries of them are oh they are glorious just rich with spiritual vitamin now we see that one of the great outstanding things i'd like to bring your attention to was the living creatures of the last part of the fourth chapter that john saw watching that art of the covenant remember how they were fixed just like israel in its march they had uh uh oh there was a face of the living creature and we found out that these preachers were not angels neither were they man they were turbans and we found them in the old testament with the ark we find them in the new testament and then we find them over in the coming of the lord again cherubians guarding the mercy seat the mercy seat which no one could approach unless there was an atonement there for that person amen only way that the sanctuary when it was sprinkled of the blood then it became a mercy seat but after the blood was taken off and it became a judgment seat and oh my no one could stand the judgments of god the only thing that we can look for is mercy not judgment not righteous righteousness we cannot approach is a justice because as justice you'll have to keep his word and keeping his word the day either of that day you die who would want justice i don't want justice i call for mercy my that's the mercy of god and the mercy seat sprinkled but there was a time of the cleansing of the sanctuary when it was a judgment seat as long as the blood was off of the seat now we're approaching that time now we are now approaching in this age a cleansing of the sanctuary and the judgments coming up on the earth see as long as blood is there god cannot destroy the earth long as blood is there nobody is a sinner before god everybody's right because there's an atonement for everybody but if you fail to accept that atonement and go into his presence then you are a sinner you're beyond that mercy then you've judged yourself but now while there is mercy but when the cleansing of the sanctuary comes the blood goes off the mercy seat and then the wrath of god falls upon the earth oh my god be merciful to us that we be not in that day found without mercies of god now we see in there i'll try to uh kind of spiritualize it here draw it for you by my hands that there were four corners how israel uh camped themselves they put the the ark in the center and on the four sides of the tent was three tribes of israel and three fours is twelve or four threes rather twelve and each three had a head and each head of the tribe one of them was reuben he always camped to the the south he was the head of man and ephraim was to the west with three tribes he was uh the ox the then on the east was judah which is the line and on the north was dan which was the eagle now notice you remember all of you remember well how he had him brought out the eagle and the ox and the the man and the lion now you notice judah guards the eastern gate and christ is the line of the tribe of judah he shall descend from the eastern sky enter in by the way of the gate he comes from the eastern gate from the tribe of judah and he's the lion of the tribe of judea and we find out over in our coming message this morning that he still is proclaimed the line of the tribe of judah the root the very beginning of david david was the king eternally and christ sets on the throne of david in the millennium which is eternal king there will never be one faith hallelujah never be one failed david god promised that said none would ever fail david that one he said what about today where's those jewish judges he still has the seed christ is his son according to the flesh there once said sir david shall not fail that's right and christ is that line of the tribe of judah from which david sprang from now we find out that they were the guards to the mercy seat they watched the mercy seat nothing come to it it crossed over the tribes first before to get to the mercy seat every man willing to give his life every israelite camp would die before anything that enter into that camp over there and take that mercy seat and now we find out that was the old testament order and in the new testament order we find the same thing that it was guarded the mercy seat oh i hope you get it the mercy seat is still guarded still got the guards we found out that those guards were matthew mark luke and john guarding the book of acts uh acts of the holy spirit done amongst the apostles which is the the book of acts of the new of the new testament and the four writers of the gospels matthew mark luke and john all guard that mercy seat to show that it is god the holy spirit today each scripture matthew mark luke and john everyone will back up the true gospel of the lord jesus christ and the acts of the holy spirit now when we get beyond that then that's not it but it backs up the true message like we find out then uh acts 2 38 will repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins in the day they adopted the name of father son and holy ghost to be baptized in there's no scripture for that there's no background there's no there's nothing to guard that not a thing you say matthew said it matthew guarded it matthew 28 1 18 says the birth of jesus christ is on this wise when his mother mary was exposed to joseph before they came together she was bound with a child are the holy ghost amen this is all done while joseph her husband rather being a just man not willingly to make her public example was minded that the putter away privately on this one but while he thought on these things behold the angel lord appeared to him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thou life for that which is conceived in her is all the holy ghost and the holy ghost and god the father is the same person already had two fathers so you see and she shall bring forth a child call his name jesus and this is done that might be fulfilled spoken a prophet god would be with us called emmanuel which is god father son and holy ghost in one name jesus christ [Music] against era a few days ago in chicago before a ministerial association of chicago greater chicago i knew the holy spirit got me up the night and told me stand by the window said there is a group of ministers in there fixing the breakfast for you said be careful they're going to attack you up on this i said thank you lord you showed me where it would be set and i went and told some ministers brother carlson brother tommy hicks how it would be i said the place that you've ordered it won't be like that we're going to be in another place told how dark for me to be set and how colored man would come in set this weight all about it then that morning they said my son said to me he said daddy are you going over there next plus i said i'm going to refuse i'm going over anointed with the holy spirit with a word of god that will guard that mercy seat as long as he's there so when we got down there before they even had a chance to ask one thing the holy spirit spoke to him he said now is the time to say it i said i know why you're here now i said now brother hicks and you brother carlson the head of the christian businessman i said isn't everything just exactly where the holy spirit told me day before yesterday that you did not get that room with me over here and this got it that morning god said now look at everybody's place just the way it said it would be i said the thing you want to approach me on is on the name of jesus christ for baptism and when we the holy spirit begin to take the word of god and reveal it didn't interpret it down like that when all those bunch of trinitarian ministers sat there reaching on the table shaking hands with one another tears running down their cheeks and i understand that 72 of them is coming down here to this tabernacle for me to baptize them in the name of jesus christ the mercy seat is guarded see the holy spirit guard and the mercy seat we must keep it just exactly let that word of god then great messenger sitting there matthew mark looking john that backs up every act out that new testament and now not that's exactly what i said in the first part of this morning's message let's keep it right there guarded by the gospel amen keep it right there where the gospels will guard it now we find out in there they were guarding god's mercy seat in the old testament and there matthew mark luke john all of them and even the line of the tribe of judah laid down his life to guard that mercy seat let it be sprinkled with his own blood and there he stands this morning today the great conqueror who shall descend from the east someday and we shall see him now we turn quickly because i know there's a baptismal service what is this seven sealed book oh what a great thing did you notice how it says here it was seven seals on the back of the book it's something oh may god help us now and give us courage and maybe sooner or later i can get it to you look this is not written in the word it's sealed on the back of the word the book was sealed by these seven seals the whole mystery of the book is sealed up in these seven seals this is one of the most greatest chapters in the whole book of the revelation look and i saw in the right hand of him that set up on a throne a book written within and written within inside's written that's what we're reading this morning and the backside sealed with seven seals outside the bible what the bible doesn't even say it's sealed in here with seven seals the mysteries of god now what is it now notice a seal represents a finished product something that has been already tested proven and then sealed where is we have the earnest of our salvation now by being sealed with the holy spirit that is the earnest of our salvation let's go back just a minute i've got a scripture written down here several of them i don't have time to get to all but let's go back to ephesians just a moment and read the in the first chapter of ephesians so that you might get the real meaning paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and remember john had this letter addressed to the ephesians the ephesus and the faithfully christ the ones that paul had preached to and brought up nurtured with the gospel the ephesus and to the faithful in christ that's those who are already in christ how do we get in christ by one spirit we're all baptized into one body which is the body of christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father in the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ jesus think of it now he has blessed us with all heavenly grace blessings as we assemble together in christ jesus as the believers the elected church called out set aside he sealed us in by his holy spirit and now is revealing to us all the things that is in the future for us now we're up to the seven seals according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame and love having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to his own good pleasure what a beautiful thought this is let's just read on just a minute i want to get down here especially to the 12th first and 13th 14th that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in him in whom he also trusted after that you heard the word of truth and the gospel of your salvation whom after ye believed you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise after ye believe oh my baptist brother how could you say that isn't so you say you receive the holy ghost when you believe it's that after you believe then you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise notice which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchase procession onto the praise of his glory now we find out then that a seal means that it is a finished thing with god it's already settled and every believer was sealed with this promise from the very beginning because before the foundation of the world we were predestined unto the adoption of sons before the world ever begin oh wow i hope that makes us rest steadfast and sure i anchor to the soul not tossed about here and there but anchored in christ a hope that sure predestinated us before the foundation of the world to the adoptions of sunlight jesus christ i love that finished work with god now let me just quote another scripture to you all that he foreknew he has called all that he called he justified all that he had justified he hath glorified all the way from the beginning god in his great infinite mind foresaw his church and predestinated it unto the adoption of children to jesus christ [Music] what a beautiful praise brother neville that just makes me feel lots better adoption by the blood of jesus christ now notice as we go on uh now we know it's a finish we are predestinated with the lamb the holy spirit is our seal the earnest means more is yet to come we only have the earnest of it now the earnest is just the down payment oh how beautiful just the down payment that holds it in secures it and anchors it so no one else can touch it it's the earnest of our adoption amen the holy spirit is now the earnest of god in our hearts seal the adoption of sons awaiting us at the end of the road sons and daughters of god let's turn to another scripture right quick i got written down on this other picture romans 8 22 i think it's beautiful now in studying yesterday i kind of wrote out a few scriptures here that i'd like to refer to we know that we know that the whole creation growth and surveillance in teens together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our bodies oh do you see it all creation is groaning said paul everything is groaning look at the trees how they struggle look at the flowers how they struggle for life just for the frost to tear them down look at the trees how they struggle to hold their branches out to say glories of the god see everything all nature all animals all birds how he flies from the enemy quickly and gets away everything groaning and we ourselves said paul we've grown too with them or we're waiting for the redemption of our body but now amen now they did all those years until now now we have the earnest of our inheritance what do we have we have the evidence that god lives we have the evidence that god is with us we have the evidence that god is not forsaking us that we are his and he is ours because we in our bodies we now tabernacle the holy spirit of god it cries out as our father and there's nothing can ever take that away we are anchored in christ now the trees does not have it nature doesn't have it but yet we are still groaning with them because as yet we haven't received the fullness of our adoption but we have the earnest of it amen that we were picked up from the things of the world and now become sons and daughters of god what kind of people should we be oh my when we think of that now we have the earnest our spirits groaning for the full adoption but now we have the earnest of it as we receive the holy spirit it is the earnest of our complete adoption our complete salvation oh how beautiful i just love that all right we are waiting for the foolish of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection hallelujah that's when our bodies will be changed from these vile creatures that we are and we'll have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him as he is and we will be like him when he appears we appear in his likeness we will have a body like his a glorious glorified body and all the trials and struggles of life will fade off into a little myth and blow aways and never be no more and these earthly tabernacles which we now have grown in we are waiting for that earnest that earnest uh for this salvation fully in its fullest to come but now in these tabernacles of clay we have something that tells us that we have raised [Music] now watch when we love the things of the world once when we sinned and went about doing things to the world and cared not for god we were alienated from him without god without christ in the world now god sent his holy spirit and through that we are lifted up from those things we have the earnest that we know that we pass some death under life amen here as i was trying to show this like this here's where the ordinary center runs down here on the bottom now the christian goes up a little higher than this he rides above all that stuff that's the earliest of his salvation now that you might know when what visions do to you so help me god being my judge i never intend to have another one if it does i'll keep it to myself see because i see what it does the people are not ready for such a ministry so you just have to let it go you see go on back here if i ever come to feel again i'll be in advances but look here on this year coming back in here up in here you go up into this heavenlies up in here you live right up around in those rims there you go beyond anything that man can think of beyond anything and it brings you up into them spaces there but you see now we have by the holy spirit the earnest of our inheritance because we've been lifted up from the things of the world and we ride right along with the world but we are above the world god be merciful and grant to the church of the living god when we ever get to a place to think that the church a beautiful church that we're trying to compare with the things of the world we're trying to have a better basketball team than they got we got to have a better feeling we've got to have a better bunko game we've got to have better this and better that what can we ever compare with the glamour and the glisten of the world we are not the gospel isn't a glisten it's a glow there's a difference between a glitter and a glow see we just go around as i've said taking one uh one corpse from one more to another changing members and things like that well what good does it do us and we're trying to make it glittery big times people's great big fine places we got to have a better than the methodists are better than the baptists and we're all trying to compete with the catholic and we're having bunk hole games and parties and suppers and entertainments and everything the church can never compare with the world how can your church entertainment ever compared with the masonic lodge or any of those people who can entertain that's their grounds don't try to go over on their grounds but we've got something to happen we've got jesus we have jesus they okay can't have jesus watch how they come over here and when we get over there we're all for his ground don't try to glitter go and you can't go you got to let it go through you the little glowworm he doesn't go because he wants to go because he does glow it's something that he's blowing it's in itself it's himself dude something inside of him is glowing through well that's the way it is with the holy spirit we don't have to be peculiar be different be anything more just let loose and live a godly life and he said god that'll go for the gospel not glitter glitter that makes monkeys jump at things like that any glitters you know they're always jumping for something shiny but glow is a soft mellow sweetness of the of the holy spirit now we are waiting for that resurrection but now do you understand say amen if you do what i mean by saying the earnest we've been we know we have passed some death in the life because we're lifted up we are lifted up not in ourselves but lifted up from the things of the world that we love everybody and god loves us and we know it and we watch our lives and see that it is the holy spirit because we don't more care for the things of the world amen there you are as long as you love the world and things of the world than the love of god not in you but as long as you're above that then you know you have your inheritance you're on your road to your full redemption and now that will not come you see until we have first first we must see jesus and when he comes then we'll have a body like his body and will be made like him all right now we see something that was lost here because the bible said so and in the book here that that has redeemed us what are we redeemed from something we must have lost before you can be redeemed there must be something that redeemed us back and all the inheritance that we had has been has been redeemed back then we must have had something one time that we do not have now that this lamb come to redeem amen see we had something was lost from now notice what did we lose well it was given to adam to have eternal life as long as he eat from the tree he had eternal life and we uh notice again that adam was the uh he inherit the earth he was a like a an amateur god over the earth the earth was his everything was given into his hand he could do with whatever he wanted to he named it and called it and done whatever he wanted to he was truly a son of god now in the fall adam farfart the title deed to that amen he forfeited it to satan satan took the title deed adam was very soulful and he did not redeem his rights for he could not redeem his rights but satan which does not rightfully own it but he possesses that he is the god of this earth amen he possesses that not because he that he he really rightfully gets it but he possesses it now do you get it amen satan possesses that he holds it into his hand death is in his hands the earth is in his hand the world belongs to you every nation belongs to you he governs and controls the whole world and everything in the world amen satan does but thank god we're not all the world you are see i don't mean the church you don't control the church he just controls the world he said there were his and he's the god of the world jesus said he was and he is he's the god of this earth that's blind the eyes of the people the god of this earth he's the god of heaven and now he rightly don't own this he does not own it but he's forfeit and adam forfeit the title deed to it to this all this stuff that we own eternal life and the inheriting of the earth jesus said in matthew 5 blessed are the meeks for they shall inherit yeah see now we don't have it now and look it wasn't that adam or any of his seeds adam's seed absolutely lost everything too it's not the seed of adam no matter how much we try to beautify as the world and how much we try to make big fine homes and things that still doesn't belong to adam's seed no sir amen it did not go to adam seed no sir because satan tucket lock stock and barrel [Music] yes so many things could be said i just don't want to take too much of time now so we have to baptize all right he possesses it but he does not rightfully own it satan does when the rifle owner rifle owner owner lost it there's only one way that it can be redeemed now that's by our near kinsman is the only one who can rightly redeem it now of course this week i have in the virgin birth of jesus christ now i want to say something here the first thing that we want to go back to is if we go back in the in the old testament you know i believe i got it wrote down here somewhere in leviticus 25 little bit because 25 23 and 24 you can get the laws of redemption you who are putting down to redeem anything while a man when god gave israel it's divided this land up to joshua each tribe and each fellow was given a land well his children inherited what his possession now if this man got poor and lost anything to another man this uh only way to be redeemed would be by a near kinsman but it finally must come back this man only holds it for a certain amount of time it must come back to the original owner right you must go back to the original owner if it was out of the tribe of judah if it was if he was there and this was allotted to his father then it was to him or some near kinsmen could take it but now nobody else could right they could hold it they could hold the deed on it they could hold the deed until the debt was paid but when the right wind come along the person that say for instance if i owned a piece of property and i lost it and i sold it over to brother neville which is of another tribe of judah or maybe sold it to an alien and he rightfully owned and he only he could come in there and farm it and take the goods off of it and so forth but really he just held the deed he could not own it that was a law in israel now you really re read the benefits 25 and you'll see that they could not rightfully open it he just held it well now for instance my son wanted billy back there wanted to take my come by this ground well then if uh the alien or brother neville or some other person owned it was holding a deed to it now if this was my next kinsman was my blood relation he could not hold it any longer amen no sir he had to give it over yes sir when that price was paid yeah when he gave him say twenty five thousand dollars for the pizza property one and say uh brother tony would come over and say uh brother neville i buy brother bran's property he couldn't do it brother would say no sir i don't want to sell it what'd you get for 25 000. well i'll give you 35 000 i'll give you someone so i don't care what you want i don't want to sell it i'll keep it but billy paul could come along and say i want my daddy's possession here's your 25 000. he had to let it go am i trying because that was the law oh hallelujah praise god i hope you christian says we are the salt of the earth [Music] god gave this to his sons he gave us the jewish teachings over all nature all animals all life everywhere but adam our father decision [Applause] but where does it fall to the right corner god who made it no wonder john said he wept bitterly before he could find no man who was worthy to redeem it the man must be worthy john said i wept bitterly when no one was able to take the book or to look on it or loose the seals out he said well no man in heaven no man on earth no man beneath the earth no man everywhere no man now he never disregarded angels remember this earth wasn't given to angels it's the inheritance of man sure somebody else is worthy michael might have been not as he might have been worthy to do it but there was no man worthy amen see and john went amen someone said because he found himself not worthy that isn't so the man's under the influence of the holy ghost he couldn't make an arrow like that but he he was he was he was he wasn't him not only worthy he could find nobody worthy so just saying he says a elder came for their strong angel said we not amen far away in the tribe of judah there is over [Applause] [Music] remember he hadn't seen him up to this time why he was set it on a seat on a throne in their god's throne he was on the inside the sanctuary he hadn't seen him at this time so john was expecting to see a lion come forth but he saw him lord there you are [Music] still be a servant of christ that's a conqueror now i said he has prevailed and he's worthy to take the book and open it into lucille's arab now we're going to find out why maybe not today but what these seven seals hold what they did now let's take a little bit on redemption before before this person could be uh could redeem the first thing he had to be worthy he had to be the right kind of person so this was accomplished when jesus christ was born a virgin birth for he was god he was god himself made a man he was god in human flesh he had to be worthy and the virgin blood of jesus christ made him worthy now we find out if you want to go to the scripture of it the first peter 1 18 to 20 if you're keeping the scriptures down he had to be worthy and he was because he took upon him the form of man he became man god became kin folks to us and there we find then the beautiful part of god jehovah made flesh and lord among us as the worthy one amen he prevailed god took on the form of human flesh and came to the earth was born a little baby and walked among us and through his holy blood he prevailed now in the old testament how a man was to proclaim his own what did he do he took an uh elder 10 elders and went to the gate and introduced what he was doing to redeem what he had been lost and sold who he was and his give a witness we find a beautiful story here as i had a little note wrote here so i wouldn't forget it being nervous this morning up on ruth the kinsman and boaz we went through it not long ago i want you to notice the three stages now of this resting i want you to notice the resting of the church just exactly the same thing now watch the first place we find as we've all been through that sermon the kinsman redeemer god was made flesh in order to become the redeemer he was the one here in the fifth chapter in the fifth chapter said and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book or to read or to read the book neither to look their own and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof he's the one he's that one we're looking at notice how ruth how in uh naoma is just boaz perfect picture how neoma in a time of famine left the church left the country went over into the mobernite land to dwell during sojourn in there she lost all she had and when she went away her husband amelie died while i was over there so that left his inheritance to fall to anyone then when we come when she comes back she brings back the beautiful young mobinite willow with her and when boy i saw this widow a type of christ he fell for her and he loved her so he had to redeem the only way he could ever get her to be wife was to redeem what his brother amulek had lost and so then he asked his other brother if he would redeem it one question he couldn't do it so he went down to make a perfect uh example of the laws of god he went to the gates and he kicked off his shoes and so let it be known this day that i have redeemed all that knee on my hand all that she has all that hamlet my brother lost i am the next kinsman now and i'm the one that can redeem it so i have come to claim it if there's any man here can show or just call why are anybody close to me let it be known and everybody kept their mouth shut so he kicked off his shoe and thought it for a testimony i have redeemed that our brother emily's had why he was a kinsman he was a kin spokes redeemer oh how beautiful it is it's such a beautiful story and then all this time ruth was resting and waiting to find out how it would come out then he comes back no one can give a testimony against it he come back and talk uh neoma and talk ruth the beautiful moment girl and they were married and lived on this possession what a beautiful story there's three stages of ruth ruth uh uh ruth deciding she's deciding whether she would make the decision or not to go back into the homeland just like the church ruth serving when she went out to glean ruth resting that's what ruth is doing now the church now ruth rewarded now that's where the next thing happens is the reward of the church now we're going to have time because you've got a baptismal service and it's quarter after 11 now but maybe we'll pick this up next sunday or some other sunday in the future the lord willing and i'd like to take this down here to show these seven horns and seven eyes and exactly it was seven seals seven ministries seven angels of the church seven stars said oh this old spirit and right here ties the whole thing together yes sir had to be worthy so jesus is worthy at his return we will fully enjoy all the fullness of redemption blessings meat shall inherit the earth men and women shall be back sons and daughters of god and the complete millennium swing will be what a beautiful thing and the strong angel with a loud voice proclaiming who is worthy who is able to do this and then the elder said don't we for the line of the tribe of judah he is worthy and he has overcome and he tucked the book and opened the book and loosed the seals thereof and never told what happened to them when we hit them seven seals being opened right down through the bible watch what took place right in this seventh seal book that we're in and out holds a whole mystery of all the redemption blessings of god remember he is the lamb he's the only one that redeemed it and remember it's sealed on the backside of the book not written within amen it's sealed on the backside and it's not written within and he was the only one was able to even open the book or to reveal the book or to reveal the seal the only one that could do it so this is one thing they might squabble about this in here about what it is but he's the one that divinely interprets it but on the back side here there's no one can do it it belongs to him and him alone and he's the one that can reveal those seven mysteries out and watch every bit of it his own redemption how the church was redeemed and what will be the redeeming oh let us just love him with all of our hearts do all that we can a certain writer was writing a story just before close and turn the service back to brother neville do you enjoy revelation [Music] [Applause] amen we just got by three verses of it this morning but we'll pick it up again notice we just a writer was writing a book about a young girl that was trying to find god so many times that we uh hunt for god and look for god and if god was just everywhere and he had a great be well if he had a great big throne sitting up here somewhere everybody would believe in god then if god set up on a big drone here somewhere say he sits in this certain city and here he is this is god you go to me turn it like that well everybody would believe him then faith would be void we wouldn't have to have any faith at all and see that would be that will be in the millennium but now he's calling and trying to find out those who it looks mysterious and dark and you don't know how to do it but by faith we believe it we believe that's jesus did you understand that brother elmer see that now if god set up on the throne and said well here there here's god he lives down a certain place we'll go down there and say uh dear sir god uh would you do it yes i'll do it and it'd be done see well of course that's god well we see that so it would be faith would be made by faith's no good when you're positive what if every person in this world was a christian what if everybody was a spirit-filled christian well we wouldn't need any faith no more amen wouldn't need any faith at all and faith is a very is a very thing that we're saved by i think and that's reason it has to be some disagree with it so that we can exercise faith do you understand it now yeah you've got to have the other side see you've got to have a bad woman to make a real one stand out right see you got to be alive make the truth positive make it shine good if everything was truth it would just be so common but you see it's something wrong with something real when truth and faith and so forth now there we are now we've got to have these pro and cons that's the way it goes you've got to have good days to make you enjoy it or bad days make you enjoy the good you have to have a little sickness to make you enjoy good health see and you have to have your valleys to make you enjoy the mountaintops and so then some of these days will all be mountain tops they'll all be healthy they'll all be gone we'll all be joined there'll be a unending joys but until that time see we got to have this pro and con now everybody understands that say amen this girl was telling that she was trying to find god everywhere she went she'd go to this church in that church and whatever more but she couldn't find it once she found going down the road there was a little old man going down to a little fella and he had a whole big cathedral on his back he was walking down the road and she said oh ho good man she said my that's awful nice of you said but uh you you got the whole thing on your back he said it'll crush you he said no it won't crush me therefore i am the rock that it's built on [Music] that's him that's free oh rock of ages i'm so glad that this arrived in the cathedral knowing that we're resting up on the run oh he said the it's not more than paper and as the rocks begin to move over swiftly with it the beautiful bells begin to chime on the inside o rock of ages hide us in thy mercy carrots down the road and stream of life that our hearts will be full of joy and jingling praises to thee all along the world we thank thee for this visitation this morning of the holy spirit in the word amen as it comes in and makes the word so real to us forgive us of our shortcomings and all that we have did or said that was wrong forgive us for us help us to be better christians father god we pray that your mercies will rest upon us i ask lord to be your will that we can return again pretty soon and finish these chapters here and take these seven seals we're we're looking forward to that time lord when you you you let us do that and father right here in your own little church we pray that you'll grant it to us that we might understand these great things of god not because that we deserve it our hungry hearts are bleeding for we pray that you'll grant it we pray for our brother neville our our faithful god-sent pastor we pray for him that you'll help him in blessing his sweet little wife beautiful little thing and his little children we pray for all the trustees and the deacons and everybody comes to this church not only for ours but for others and all that calls upon your name i pray for my friends from across the country just a breast notice and here they are father i i just thank you for this i pray that you'll hasten the day that when jesus shall come and we shall all be gathered together for there'll be no more day tonight and no more time that'll blend into eternity and where we can all be together forever granted lord if there be some here this morning lord who doesn't know he is their savior may they want to get acquainted with this lamb who holds a seven seal mystery book in his hand god may we be acquainted so in the future when we see those seals broke open then we can see what god is speaking to us about we asked it for god's glory through the name of his son jesus christ and while we have our heads bowed for the word again to understand more clearly some of the things he did say he was moving on to the revelation of the seven seals amen and that burden was on his on his heart it's on his shoulders as it were to move on with god not exactly knowing when it was going to take place i was going to take place amen but he wanted to be led by the spirit amen that's the same thing with you and me in this hour brother what are we looking for oh we're not looking for the suit yes we are because the problem of god or did explain to us that the revelation of the seven of the of the seven seals the revelation of what god was going to do in the ministry of william branham it was to give us rapturing faith give us the faith that we need amen all down through the ages god sent a messenger with a message to give them the faith that they needed in the age they lived oh yeah whether it's luther's age or wesley's or the pentecostal age and so on god said sent the the messengers with the message oh yeah and whether it was luther to give them the faith of justification wesley the faith of sanctification the pentecostals the faith of the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but praise the lord as i said but what was left after god finished with the pentecostals what else was left what was god going to do next amen we were justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost given access to the gifts of the spirit well lord what else is there well the only thing or anything else that was left left for god to do was the resurrection and the rapture amen and he was to send a messenger with a message to give us faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture amen brother god well yeah thank god for justification thank god he sanctified us thank god he filled us with the holy ghost and he gave us access to to the gifts of the spirit amen but brother now what is god required of us but that was previous ages that was previous believers amen it was the bride of christ in every age now again understand this many are called if you were chosen amen don't and don't condemn all that's called amen just just rejoice at your your number with the children amen the bride because again even the call they're going to be there as i said they'll be outside the city the chosen is the bride that'll be in the city so and again as i said i've had to preach it for years for believers to keep your attitude right keep your spirit right toward those out there amen and and god had to even even rebuke the prophet himself amen because uh because of his attitude toward those that oh they weren't pentecostals they weren't this they weren't that they didn't believe the message and oh and there were certain of the of the of the sisters or the ladies there and he would look at him and condemn them and the angel said brother brown don't you do that oh yeah he said because he says some of them are my children amen so brother sister keep your attitude right keep your spirit right thank god for what he has done and what he is doing in your life amen thank god for what he has done through the revealed word to give us resurrection and rapturing faith amen brother like i said he's not requiring what what he gave luther wesley the pentecostal we got that it's there amen praise the lord thank you jesus but and but now oh lord what are you requiring now for the resurrection oh and that's why he that's why there was a malachi 4. amen the ministry of malachi 4 the opening of the seals the revelation of the mystery of god amen and brother the mystery of god was going beyond justification sanctification the baptist the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen brother we're entering into the great mystery of the resurrection the rapture by the grace of god and brother the ministry of the word now is to folk get us to focus on the resurrection focus on the on the on the rapture to get out of here because that is what god is requiring of us amen so he's not just saying oh lord thank you for the prophet thank you for the prophet thank you for repeating this mystery of this mystery and that mystery well that's good yeah what's it doing for you and what are we doing for it amen praise the lord are we living for it amen that we're healing ourselves to the to the mystery of god in these last days amen and if we are more and more we're we're under the influencing money look up look up oh lord we're looking for the resurrection lord we're believing for the rapture we're believing for the change amen because lord you've done everything else this is the only thing left amen grace keep pressing on by the grace of god amen and of course in 1961 it's around this time that god was dealing with william branham and causing him to an anointing him to to move away from the first and second pull of his ministry to a third pull amen and even even brother bamwood was it was a mystery to him oh yeah and god had to deal with him deal with him let go let go let go leave that move on move on move on amen and and god had to allow this to happen in his ministry that to happen in his ministry to get him to leave that the first poll leave the second pull and basically eventually that's what a lot of people still wanted william branham for was the first and second pull and finally they turned him down because why because god got a hold of him and he stopped using the first and second gif as gifts that got to get signs yeah discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart and doing this and oh yeah the sign in his hand and so on so he stopped using it yeah what for because god had to bring the people to the place to believe not signs and wonders but to believe believe the word amen and he was the prophet was moving on to the to give us the faith for the resurrection and the rapture oh yeah brother god wasn't the lane on the veins wasn't going to produce the resurrection and put us in the resurrection put us in the rapture no it was believing the word amen believe us thou this amen will come that hour to believe that jesus is the resurrection and the rapture he challenged martha why delight to raise lazarus or she said oh you'll rise you'll come up in the resurrection you'll be up there no he said i am the resurrection yeah now not will be now amen god help us to have the present tense revelation of the resurrection and the rapture not oh yeah i believe you'll do this you'll do this no son i want you to do it i want you to do it amen yeah well well you lord you you'll do the resurrection no he said i'm get i've given you the word i've given you the faith for the resurrection for the rapture i want you to do it that's why again and again i've said it so often that's why the prophet said he said god is waiting on us yeah and the dead in christ he said are waiting on us what they're waiting on us lazarus for waiting on jesus but if he if he stayed with martha he wouldn't have done it i don't know but he did it to show to show martha that he was the present tense resurrection not a future he said i am that i will be he said i am the resurrection praise the lord and brothers the same thing now is not oh we will be in the resurrection we're going in a restaurant no no we are in the resurrection we are being resurrected now and we're being caught up the true bride is being cut more and more away from the world and the things of the world more and more conscious of heaven and eternity so the grace of god be with us brother and god help us to believe the word amen again we just ministered on adoption and what is it is it's the placing we're being placed in the right position yeah adoption is placing yeah and not being adopted is being placed in that position like the like the scripture speaks about the the song that was trained and trained and trained and then when it when he was trained he was brought back to the father he said there he is he can do it you know he's been trained so he knows he knows how to write a check he knows how to sign the check he knows how to do this you can trust him yeah yeah i trust pray god can trust us with the word that we're not gonna lie we're not gonna take advantage of the word just to take advantage of god who want god to do this brother brown said that's our trouble he said we just want we want god do this god do this god do this god wants you to do it oh yeah he said there's so many just want god do this for him oh yeah god god you'll bless me you'll bless me you bless me yeah but let's bless god amen with the resurrection that he has given us and the rapture amen oh yeah
