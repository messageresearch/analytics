[37:16] holy hand we
[37:20] worship
[37:26] and
[37:32] s we bow before your
[37:37] [Music]
[37:39] face
[37:40] offering
[37:43] Nothing
[37:45] but to
[37:50] you.
[37:52] Hallelujah. Let's just bow our hearts
[37:54] before him as we approach the throne of
[37:58] grace this
[38:01] evening. Eternal God and Father, Lord,
[38:04] we give you thanks for your mercies and
[38:08] your grace that you've extended towards
[38:10] our lives.
[38:12] Lord God, we are happy people, Lord God,
[38:15] that we have heard that
[38:17] voice. And Lord, you have given us a
[38:19] heart, Lord God, that we're able to
[38:21] respond to the
[38:23] [Music]
[38:24] call. Oh God, Lord, it's nothing that we
[38:27] have done, Lord. It's it's your
[38:30] righteousness. It's your truth. It is
[38:33] your spirit,
[38:34] Lord. Lord God, it's your grace, Lord
[38:38] God. Lord, when we come, Lord, to
[38:41] gather, Lord, in places of worship,
[38:43] Lord, and when our hearts, Lord God,
[38:46] begin reflecting, Lord God, on the
[38:48] goodness that you have shown. And Lord
[38:51] God, in with such respect and humility,
[38:54] Lord God, we acknowledge the Lord God
[38:57] that you are truly to be worshiped.
[39:00] Lord, we know there's coming a time,
[39:02] Lord God, when Lord, the stories will be
[39:06] told of the goodness, oh God, of the
[39:08] overcoming, Lord, of the blessings that
[39:11] you have bestowed and the joy
[39:13] unspeakable and full of glory, oh God,
[39:16] that will unfold in your presence. But
[39:19] Lord God, in recognition to the praises
[39:22] that you deserve this evening, Lord, we
[39:24] give her the glory, Lord.
[39:26] Hallelujah. Lord God, we say Lord God,
[39:30] hallelujah, let all everything that has
[39:32] breath, Lord God, let the the praise
[39:35] your wonderful and precious name this
[39:37] evening bless your people, Lord, as we
[39:40] come together, Lord. Remember the needs,
[39:42] Lord God. We are such a needy people.
[39:44] There's so many needs or sicknesses, oh
[39:47] God. Needs of the body, Lord God.
[39:50] There's so many things that are over
[39:52] represented, Lord God. And to some
[39:54] extent, Lord God, it seems so
[39:56] impossible. It seems so far-fetched. It
[39:59] seems so unreachable. But Lord God, but
[40:01] Lord, you told us to trust you, Lord.
[40:04] And Lord God, we're trusting in your
[40:06] mercy this evening that you bless us,
[40:09] your people. Have thine own way, Lord.
[40:11] May you come on the scene this evening,
[40:13] Lord. And may you speak to an heart. May
[40:16] you bless us, Lord God. And may the
[40:17] words that we hear, Lord God, may it not
[40:20] be the word of a man, but Lord God, as
[40:22] we unveil our hearts to you, Lord, may
[40:24] you come on the scene one more time and
[40:26] speak to your people, bless us, we pray
[40:29] in Jesus Christ's name. And we say,
[40:33] "Amen." And
[40:35] amen. Praise God. Ain't God
[40:39] good? Praise God.
[40:42] Just want to thank the Lord for another
[40:45] opportunity to be standing before the
[40:47] bride of Jesus Christ this evening. You
[40:51] know each time I stand here I stand
[40:54] humble and as an humble servant to the
[40:57] people of God you know to you know to
[40:59] render service for the purpose of the
[41:02] kingdom of God. Amen. I just also want
[41:05] to thank you know the brother thank
[41:07] brother John and my time you know for
[41:09] this opportunity and also thank brother
[41:11] Mark he has been very instrumental you
[41:13] know has been giving me too much
[41:17] information I can't keep up with all the
[41:19] information that the mark is giving but
[41:21] let me thank God you know um tonight we
[41:25] like to start a thought is something
[41:27] that has come into my heart and I said I
[41:30] want to share it amen I would like to
[41:33] look on the great
[41:35] conflict. Amen. I you know we believe
[41:38] that we are in a battle and you know I
[41:41] think it's fair it's a fair statement to
[41:43] say that you know we are we need to
[41:45] prepare for war you know because this is
[41:48] not a picnic this is not a you know is
[41:52] the time in which we have to engage you
[41:55] and I don't you know one writer would
[41:57] say that you know God didn't give us
[41:59] anything to cover our backs so we cannot
[42:01] run away from it. Amen. Amen. We have to
[42:04] fight. Amen. So, we will turn our Bibles
[42:07] to the book of Ephesians chapter
[42:10] 6 and we begin reading from verse 10.
[42:15] And it read
[42:17] thus. Finally, my
[42:20] brethren, be strong in the Lord and in
[42:24] the power of his might.
[42:27] put on the old armor of God that he may
[42:31] be able to stand against the ws of the
[42:35] devil. For we wrestle not against flesh
[42:38] and
[42:39] blood, but against
[42:42] principalities, against powers, against
[42:45] rulers of darkness of this world,
[42:48] against spiritual wic wickedness in high
[42:52] places. Wherefore take unto you the old
[42:56] armor of God that he may be able to
[43:00] withstand in the evil days and having
[43:03] done all to stand. May we stand this
[43:07] evening. Amen. May we be seated.
[43:13] You know, I would like
[43:15] to before we go into the the conflict,
[43:19] the actual conflict, I would like to use
[43:23] this service to show us that we are not
[43:26] defeated
[43:27] people. The the bride of Jesus Christ,
[43:30] she's called as an
[43:33] overcomer. And you know, because we are
[43:36] called as an overcomer, you know, God
[43:38] will equip us in our overcoming.
[43:41] Amen. And
[43:43] so before we go into the conflict, we
[43:47] like to see what the end of the conflict
[43:50] looks like. In other word, I might as
[43:53] well tell you that the bride is
[43:56] victorious. That it doesn't matter what
[43:58] we are what conflict that confronts us.
[44:01] Really, we are certain of the victory.
[44:04] We are certain of the outcome because
[44:06] God is in
[44:08] control. Hallelujah. Praise God. But we
[44:11] find church that we are caught in a
[44:14] battle in a war that didn't start here
[44:17] on earth. It started in heaven. And it's
[44:21] a war between God and Satan really. And
[44:25] it that battle that started all the way,
[44:27] you know, into eternities back then. It
[44:30] was brought down here
[44:32] unheard. And we are in the midst of that
[44:35] battle tonight this evening. Amen.
[44:38] But we want to say this evening
[44:42] that Hallelujah.
[44:44] You see at the end of
[44:46] it, you know, the Bible said, you know,
[44:49] and we look at Ephesians 1 and verse 5,
[44:53] you know, the Bible said, "Having
[44:55] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[44:57] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[45:01] according to the good pleasure of his
[45:03] will to the praise of the glory of his
[45:06] grace."
[45:08] In other word, hallelujah, at the end of
[45:11] this battle, hallelujah, God will
[45:14] present you not as a defeated bride, but
[45:17] as the praise of the glory of his grace.
[45:21] In other word, the grace of God will
[45:23] help us through this battle. The grace
[45:26] of God, hallelujah, will see us through.
[45:28] Are you there with me, church? And so,
[45:31] hallelujah, God will, he will present us
[45:34] as victorious, as as the trophies.
[45:37] Hallelujah. of of the battle that you
[45:40] know of of the time of the war and we
[45:42] know that by this hallelujah that we
[45:45] know that you know we he heaven will
[45:48] rejoice at the end of it all really and
[45:51] so the bride will also rejoice. We s see
[45:54] also in verse 6 verse 12 rather the
[45:56] Bible said that we should be the praise
[46:00] of his glory who first trusted in Christ
[46:04] in whom he also trusted after that he
[46:08] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[46:11] your salvation in whom also after he
[46:14] believed he were sealed with the Holy
[46:17] Spirit of
[46:19] promise which is the earnest of our of
[46:22] our inheritance
[46:24] until the redemption of the purchased
[46:26] possession unto the praise of the of his
[46:30] glory. In other word, I I want to
[46:31] emphasize that tonight because I want us
[46:34] to understand that hallelujah that God
[46:37] is happy. Hallelujah. That yes, we are
[46:39] subjected to a battle, but yes, we will
[46:42] be victorious.
[46:44] Hallelujah. Praise God. But we want to
[46:47] look on our position as son because we
[46:50] don't want to just see ourel in a battle
[46:52] trying to overcome. But we want to look
[46:55] before this battles actually started.
[46:58] What was our position? Hallelujah. We
[47:01] were sons and daughters of God. Are you
[47:04] there with me church? And being sons and
[47:06] daughters of God. We were Hallelujah. As
[47:09] you know we we know our hurtly father.
[47:12] We were a part of our hurtly father
[47:14] really. Hallelujah. And so you know
[47:16] there was a time that we weren't made
[47:18] expressed but and there's another time
[47:20] through the bed and ground of our of our
[47:22] mother we came into being. So we were a
[47:26] part of our father we were part of the
[47:29] genes of our father a part of his
[47:31] attribute a part of his eternal source.
[47:35] Hallelujah. And so if we were part of
[47:37] God it mean that if God cannot be
[47:39] defeated it mean that this bride cannot
[47:42] be defeated. Amen. Are you with me,
[47:44] church? Hallelujah. Praise God. Because
[47:48] we're a part of him. Hallelujah. Praise
[47:51] God. Amen. You bear with me a little bit
[47:53] as we as we grow into this. And so the
[47:57] Bible said in Romans 8 and verse 14 or
[48:01] verse 34, the Bible said, "Who is he
[48:04] that
[48:05] condemnth? It is Christ that died, yay,
[48:08] rather, that he is risen again.
[48:12] Who is even at the right hand of God?
[48:15] Who also maketh intercession for us? Who
[48:20] shall separate us separate us from the
[48:22] love of of Christ? He said, "Shall
[48:25] tribulation or
[48:28] distress or or persecution or famine or
[48:31] nakedness or peril or our sword, as it
[48:35] is written, for thy sake we are killed
[48:37] all the day long. We are accounted as
[48:41] sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all
[48:45] these things we are more than conqueror.
[48:48] Oh my. Hallelujah. We are more than
[48:51] conqueror through him who have loved us.
[48:54] For I am persuaded that neither death
[48:57] nor life, nor angel, nor principalities,
[49:00] nor power, neither things present or
[49:03] things to come, neither height nor
[49:05] depth, hallelu, nor any other creature
[49:10] shall be able to separate us from the
[49:12] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[49:16] Lord. Hallelujah. Church, uh, this was
[49:18] declared over our lives.
[49:20] In other word, before you go into a
[49:23] battle, think about what he says about
[49:25] you. That we are more than conqueror. We
[49:28] are more than victorious. Hallelujah. In
[49:31] other words, how God is it's like an
[49:33] unfair game, brother John. God said, we
[49:36] win the the the the war before we enter
[49:40] in it. God declares that we are
[49:43] victorious before we enter into that
[49:45] battle. Hallelujah. So into you know
[49:49] what what I want you to see to the
[49:51] tonight before I take you into the
[49:54] conflict see exactly that God said
[49:56] you're more than conqueror you know Lord
[49:59] you have achieved the maximum you have
[50:02] achieved the victory from the battle you
[50:05] are conqueror this evening hallelujah
[50:08] praise God
[50:10] amen so we say the sons of God are part
[50:14] of God we are part of his gene
[50:17] Hallelujah. And so being a part of God,
[50:20] Hallelujah. Brother Pam said,
[50:22] hallelujah, that the the the thoughts of
[50:24] God were made manifest or the attribute
[50:27] of the genes of God were made manifest.
[50:31] And if you're part of God, it means that
[50:33] when God manifest himself, you are part
[50:36] of that manifestation.
[50:39] Are you there, the church? Hallelujah.
[50:41] Praise God. I don't want to go very
[50:43] fast. Just bear with me. I kind of get
[50:45] excited sometime but Amen. praise
[50:48] God. But the word manifests the genes,
[50:53] the attributes of God and we are
[50:56] expressing or manifesting that attribute
[50:59] of God. Are you there at the church?
[51:02] Hallelujah. In other word, hallelujah.
[51:04] If God is victorious, h if God cannot be
[51:07] defeated in in his expression of you,
[51:11] you cannot be defeated because the world
[51:14] cannot be defeated. The world cannot be
[51:17] stopped. The word cannot be hindered.
[51:20] And if you're part of that word, it
[51:22] means that you cannot be stopped. You
[51:25] cannot be hindered. You cannot be
[51:27] prevented. Why? Because you're
[51:29] expressing a part of your eternal
[51:31] father, the word of God.
[51:35] Hallelujah. But brother Benham said on
[51:38] the message invisible
[51:41] union. Brother Benham
[51:44] said and so and so we and so we were you
[51:49] sons of God and daughters of
[51:52] God before there was even a moon, a
[51:55] star, a me a molecule. You were sons and
[52:00] daughters of God. He said you are only
[52:03] the physical manifestation of the
[52:05] attribute that was in God at the
[52:08] beginning for there is only one form of
[52:12] eternal life and that was you. It said
[52:15] before he said you didn't know nothing
[52:18] about it neither did you know when you
[52:22] were in your earthly father but he said
[52:25] but you were manifested that in in his
[52:27] image in the image of God you were made
[52:31] you were made and you were manifested
[52:34] for the glory and the fellowship of God.
[52:38] Amen. Praise God. We take another quote
[52:41] from the message communion preached
[52:45] 1965. Brother Bham said what was it? He
[52:49] said there was another William Brham. He
[52:53] said see a little spot of eternal life
[52:57] down there. He said from the genes of
[53:00] God, the word of God that was placed in
[53:04] there is that each one of you can think
[53:07] of similar thing. You see, he said it
[53:10] was it was working. He said, "Then look
[53:14] up to the tree." He said, "And I think
[53:18] leave. I see you fall off last year." He
[53:22] said, "Why are you back there again?" He
[53:26] said, "We we have you have come from."
[53:28] He said, "Where have you come from?" He
[53:30] said, "What brought you here?" He said,
[53:31] "See, it was the eternal life that is
[53:35] working in the body." Are you there,
[53:37] church? In other word, if I if I may
[53:40] illustrate this to you, you know, when
[53:42] you see a fruit tree and you look at it
[53:45] at one time, it doesn't it's not bearing
[53:48] any fruit. It it's just leaves and limbs
[53:50] and all of that. But there comes another
[53:53] time that is called the season,
[53:56] hallelujah, of the fruit where the tree
[53:59] produces. And you you will watch the
[54:02] tree and you wonder where did that fruit
[54:04] comes from? What you're looking at is a
[54:07] physical manifestation of something that
[54:10] was in the tree. Are you there with me,
[54:12] church? And so when we see the fruit,
[54:15] then we know that something in the in
[54:17] the in the genes of the tree was made
[54:20] manifested. So the fruit, hallelujah, is
[54:23] the manifestation of the tree itself,
[54:26] the inner core of the tree.
[54:29] Hallelujah. Praise God. It's an
[54:33] expression. In other words, What I want
[54:36] you to see tonight that God is a God of
[54:40] reality and if Hallelujah and so God in
[54:44] himself have thoughts but God want to
[54:47] express those thoughts. Are you there
[54:49] with me church? Because those thoughts
[54:51] are reality. Amen. Hallelujah. But what
[54:54] does he do? He takes from within
[54:57] himself. Who did he took from himself?
[55:00] He took you and I from himself and
[55:03] express hallelujah al us by the word to
[55:06] do what? To manifest God to bring
[55:09] himself into manifestation. You got to
[55:12] see hallelujah that you're not just a
[55:15] mistake but you are a part of God but
[55:18] you are called to manifest God. And if
[55:21] you're manifesting God by the word
[55:23] hallelujah the gates of hell cannot
[55:26] prevail against you.
[55:30] Hallelujah. Praise God. Because God has
[55:33] declared it. The words that comes from
[55:36] me must go out and accomplish after
[55:40] those things that are sent in our word.
[55:42] It must reproduce. It must become
[55:45] fruitful. It must be victorious. It must
[55:48] achieve the end result as God has
[55:51] expected it to be. It cannot be
[55:55] defeated. Hallelujah.
[55:58] said now then one day as I walk on he
[56:02] said that vice talking don't never drink
[56:07] smoke drink enough so
[56:09] forth and the young fellow and all got
[56:13] older he said see there was something
[56:18] moving he said but yet all at once I
[56:22] look up and I said I'm not the son of
[56:25] Charles and Elsa Brham said There's
[56:28] something calling me. It's a light that
[56:31] my that my little eagle I'm not a
[56:34] chicken. There's something up yonder
[56:37] somewhere. He said, "Oh, great
[56:39] Jehovah." Is that whoever you are, uh,
[56:43] open up. Hallelujah. I want to come
[56:47] home. There's something in me calling.
[56:50] Hallelujah. Here, a man feeling the
[56:53] essence of God calling him back. Uh,
[56:56] hallelujah. to the true essence of the
[56:59] word. That's where we need to go,
[57:01] church. We need to get back to the word.
[57:03] Uh we need to get back into that state
[57:06] of manifesting God again.
[57:09] You see where I'm going with all of this
[57:11] tonight. Hallelujah. But I got to show
[57:14] you your godly inheritance that if you
[57:17] come from
[57:18] God that Hallelujah. The reason why
[57:21] you're able to give birth to the word is
[57:24] because you come from God. And if you're
[57:27] called to give birth to the word, it
[57:29] means that the word in you is Christ.
[57:32] And Christ cannot be defeated. Amen. It
[57:36] doesn't matter who is challenging you.
[57:38] It could be an angel from heaven. It
[57:41] could be an agency from here. The bride
[57:44] of Christ cannot be
[57:46] defeated. There's no battle that can
[57:49] defeat the bride of Jesus Christ.
[57:51] There's no sickness that can defeat you.
[57:53] There's no need that can defeat you.
[57:55] Why? Because the word of God speaks for
[57:58] you.
[57:59] Hallelujah. Praise
[58:01] God.
[58:03] Amen. Amen. Forgive me if I'm shouting,
[58:06] brother
[58:07] Mark. Oh my. I'm getting a little bit
[58:12] excited.
[58:14] Amen. Brother said, "Then I was born
[58:17] again, and that little life was laying
[58:21] there. The life of water was poured upon
[58:25] it. Then it began to grow. Now the old
[58:29] life was he said was forgiven. Put in
[58:33] the sea of God's
[58:34] forgetfulness. Never to be remembered
[58:37] again. He said me no more. See now we
[58:41] stand justified as though we have never
[58:44] had sin. Hallelu in the presence of God.
[58:48] Hallelujah. Praise God. We are
[58:51] justified. Hallelujah. By hal by the
[58:55] spirit of God. Amen. So listen church.
[58:59] Listen better said that we did not
[59:01] become son by the new birth. Hal but
[59:04] because we were in him church. We were
[59:07] in the genes of God. We were part of the
[59:11] eternal locust. Hallelujah. We're part
[59:13] of him. And so because we're part of him
[59:16] that's the reason why we can be reborn.
[59:19] And if you're reborn and you're reborn
[59:22] by the word of God, it means that if
[59:25] you're subjected to a condition,
[59:27] hallelujah, listen, before you are
[59:30] subjected to the condition, there's a
[59:32] word, hallelujah, that speaks to the end
[59:35] result of the of the battle that you're
[59:37] going through,
[59:39] God already, the Bible said that he may
[59:42] give you unexpected end. Hallelujah.
[59:45] Praise
[59:46] God. Amen.
[59:49] Hallelujah. So we said
[59:52] those of his divine
[59:55] attribute were made a part of the word
[59:57] at the beginning. Brother said when God
[1:00:01] was writing Christ the word the lamb's
[1:00:04] book of life he said he slat our names
[1:00:07] there. Hallelujah. And so our names were
[1:00:11] written with Christ. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:15] The lamb's book of life.
[1:00:17] And but said and the Bible said and he
[1:00:20] is the word and if he is the word if
[1:00:24] Christ is the word the bride is also the
[1:00:28] word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:00:31] God. He said you said I thought it was
[1:00:35] just a a a figment of God's thought. You
[1:00:39] thought that you were just a part of God
[1:00:41] thought but no church you're part of his
[1:00:44] genes.
[1:00:46] In other word, hallelujah. If God is
[1:00:48] eternal and you came from God, it means
[1:00:51] that you are eternal just as God is
[1:00:55] eternal. It means that if God was
[1:00:58] fighting a battle, h in heaven, it means
[1:01:01] that you are fighting that battle in God
[1:01:04] in heaven. It means that Hallelujah. If
[1:01:07] you defeat the enemy in heaven, oh my
[1:01:10] church, hallelujah, you will defeat him
[1:01:12] again.
[1:01:14] Hallelujah. Praise
[1:01:16] God.
[1:01:19] Amen. That is a figment of God thought.
[1:01:22] But you are in Hallelujah. is mine.
[1:01:26] Hallelujah. You're not just in his mind,
[1:01:29] but you are. Hallelujah. You are in the
[1:01:31] his very genes. You are his essence. You
[1:01:35] are his person. Oh my. That takes
[1:01:39] everything out of a church. Hallelujah.
[1:01:42] So here I'm saying to you now as we get
[1:01:45] down to a little bit of of the the meat
[1:01:47] on the bone side of it really you see
[1:01:50] only sons of
[1:01:52] God you know and and I'm using this you
[1:01:55] know these statements really to
[1:01:56] establish the thought only sons of God
[1:02:00] can manifest the full revelation of God.
[1:02:03] It's not given to angels really. Yeah.
[1:02:06] It's not given to animals or anything
[1:02:08] else. It was given to sons of God. And
[1:02:12] so all that God is. Hallelujah. And he
[1:02:15] poured it out. But when he poured it
[1:02:17] out, hallelujah, what was he doing? He
[1:02:20] was emptying himself that the sons of
[1:02:23] God would take the thought of God and
[1:02:25] manifest God. Amen. Hallelujah. So the
[1:02:28] bride of Jesus Christ, uh, hallelujah,
[1:02:31] she's a part of him, a part of his God,
[1:02:33] a part of his chains. She's a part of
[1:02:36] him.
[1:02:38] Hallelujah. Sons of God was given the
[1:02:41] world to manifest God the complete
[1:02:44] revelation of God. And so being a son of
[1:02:47] God, Hallelujah. You see when God
[1:02:50] created all his creation to to include
[1:02:53] the animals and the angelic forces and
[1:02:56] all of this. Hallelujah. God have an
[1:02:59] estate that each created being must
[1:03:02] occupy. In other word, that's their
[1:03:05] position for which they're created and
[1:03:08] they are not expected. They cannot
[1:03:10] proceed beyond that estate. For them to
[1:03:13] do that, it has to be a breach. There
[1:03:16] got to be a breach. Hallelujah. To step
[1:03:19] outside of that position in to step into
[1:03:22] a different position. Hallelujah. And so
[1:03:25] the position, hallelujah, that God has
[1:03:28] given you and I is a position by
[1:03:32] inheritance.
[1:03:33] Hallelujah church. Oh my. You have an
[1:03:37] inheritance in God.
[1:03:40] Hallelujah. An inheritance. Hallelujah.
[1:03:43] But put your position in God as a part
[1:03:46] of your creative and a part of your
[1:03:48] father. Hello. You came forth in his
[1:03:51] expression. You were the physical
[1:03:54] manifestation of your father.
[1:03:57] Hallelujah. That's your inheritance.
[1:04:01] And you know what? And the gates of hell
[1:04:04] cannot take that away from you.
[1:04:08] It cannot be taken away.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah. Amen. So we receive that.
[1:04:15] Sons of God, daughters of God.
[1:04:18] Hallelujah. Receive my inheritance.
[1:04:21] Hallelujah. Praise God. And we were
[1:04:24] given Hallelujah. the
[1:04:26] responsibility. Hallelujah. To manifest
[1:04:29] the will of your father. You see the
[1:04:33] will of God. Hallelujah. Hal is in God.
[1:04:36] In other word, the will of God is in
[1:04:40] himself.
[1:04:41] Are you there me church? And so in order
[1:04:44] for him to give he you the will, he has
[1:04:47] to give you that part of himself to
[1:04:49] manifest that part of his himself. In
[1:04:52] other words, hallelujah. What God was
[1:04:54] doing, God was revealing himself. Uh he
[1:04:58] was making himself known. Are you there
[1:05:00] with me church? But when he does that,
[1:05:03] the full revelation of him himself, he
[1:05:06] gave that by inheritance to sons and
[1:05:09] daughters of God. Hallelujah. And so
[1:05:12] when you see this the child of God,
[1:05:15] hallelujah, you're looking on the
[1:05:16] physical manifestation of God.
[1:05:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:05:25] God. So
[1:05:27] we we Hallelujah have received an
[1:05:31] inheritance.
[1:05:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You
[1:05:35] see looking at the on the creation and
[1:05:39] this is just thing that we you know
[1:05:40] thing that we used to looking at the
[1:05:43] creation of God looking at the animal
[1:05:46] creation the that's that's an
[1:05:47] animalistic side of things you know said
[1:05:50] the animal that they have a body and
[1:05:53] they have a spirit but they don't have a
[1:05:56] soul the angelic being h they a soul and
[1:06:00] a spirit but they do not have a body
[1:06:03] there church But you and I church that
[1:06:06] takes the genes of God. Hallelujah. We
[1:06:09] have body, spirit and soul. In other
[1:06:13] word, hallelujah. We are trying you know
[1:06:15] in other word we can occupy three spaces
[1:06:18] at the same time. That sound crazy. But
[1:06:21] I can be here in this body and somewhere
[1:06:24] else. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's why
[1:06:27] Paul could say hallelujah. Right now,
[1:06:30] tonight uh we are seated together in
[1:06:33] heavenly places in Christ. Hallelujah. I
[1:06:37] am present. Hallelujah. There with him.
[1:06:40] But yet I'm here in this mortal body.
[1:06:43] Church. There's great an understanding.
[1:06:46] Hallelujah. Of the mystery of God. But
[1:06:49] God has given to you and I. Hallelujah.
[1:06:52] Through all contents of this mystery to
[1:06:54] manifest.
[1:06:56] Hallelujah.
[1:06:58] sunship of God. And so the Bible said in
[1:07:01] Hebrews 1, that's Hebrews chapter 1, the
[1:07:06] Bible said, "God who at sun time and in
[1:07:09] diverse manner spoke in time pass unto
[1:07:11] the fathers by the prophet has in these
[1:07:16] last days spoken unto us by son, whom he
[1:07:21] appointed here of all things, to whom
[1:07:24] also, hallelujah, he made the hurt."
[1:07:28] Hallelujah. I'm trying to show you the
[1:07:30] position of sunship. Hallelujah. But by
[1:07:34] inheritance, hallelujah. The blessing
[1:07:36] belongs to the children of
[1:07:38] God. He said, who being the brightness
[1:07:42] of his glory and the express image of
[1:07:45] his person and above all things by the
[1:07:48] word of his power, when he by himself
[1:07:52] purged our sins, sat down at the right
[1:07:55] hand of the majesty on high. Hallelujah.
[1:07:59] Hallelujah. Praise God. Verse four,
[1:08:01] Bible said, "Being made so much better
[1:08:04] than the angel." Hallelujah. He has by
[1:08:08] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:08:10] name than they. Hallelujah. In other
[1:08:14] words, church, I want to understand what
[1:08:16] Paul is doing. Paul is comparing. You
[1:08:19] see when we talk about angel being the
[1:08:22] thought is we are thinking about this
[1:08:24] great being with hessence and and and
[1:08:27] glories and all of that but church in
[1:08:29] the position as sunship uh your position
[1:08:32] of sunship uh elevate you way beyond
[1:08:35] that really hallelujah praise God
[1:08:38] hallelujah you're not just a little you
[1:08:41] know you know you as a little boy coming
[1:08:44] to church or anything like that but you
[1:08:46] are a sons of God you are daughter of
[1:08:48] God. You were made for the purpose to
[1:08:51] manifest God. So the Bible said in verse
[1:08:53] 5, "Unto which of the angels said he at
[1:08:57] any time, thou art my son, this day have
[1:09:00] I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
[1:09:04] him a father, and he shall be to me a
[1:09:07] son." And again, when he bringeth the
[1:09:10] first begotten into the world, he said,
[1:09:13] "And let all the angel of God worship
[1:09:16] him." Hallelujah. I'm deliberate in my
[1:09:19] statement tonight because I want you to
[1:09:22] understand that the enemy, Hallelujah,
[1:09:24] is out of position. He wants you to
[1:09:28] worship him. But church, he was created
[1:09:31] to worship the seed of God. Hallelujah.
[1:09:35] In other words, church, it's not above
[1:09:37] your head, it's under your feet.
[1:09:39] Hallelujah. You must walk upon him. The
[1:09:42] Bible said we walk upon serpent and had
[1:09:45] and your dragon we will put him under
[1:09:47] our feet. It's under your feet church.
[1:09:50] Satan is under your feet by way of a
[1:09:54] position of
[1:09:56] sunship. God hallelujah by the birth has
[1:09:59] elevated your position. Hallelujah. And
[1:10:02] the Bible said verse seven, "And the
[1:10:04] angel he said, who maketh his angels
[1:10:08] spirit and his ministers a flame of
[1:10:11] fire, but unto the son he said, thy
[1:10:15] throne, oh God, is forever and ever, a
[1:10:20] skeptor of righteousness is a skeptor of
[1:10:23] thy
[1:10:24] kingdom. Thou hast love righteousness
[1:10:27] and hate iniquity. Therefore, God, even
[1:10:31] thy God, has anointed thee with a high
[1:10:35] of gladness above thy
[1:10:38] fellows. And thou, Lord, in the
[1:10:41] beginning has laid the foundation of the
[1:10:44] hurt, and the heaven all the works of
[1:10:47] thine
[1:10:48] hands. They shall perish, but thou
[1:10:52] remainest. They shall h they all shall
[1:10:56] watch old and thus as dust a garment and
[1:11:00] has a vesture that thou shall fold them
[1:11:04] up. Hallelujah. They shall they shall be
[1:11:09] changed but thou art the same and thy
[1:11:12] hearers shall not fail. In other word
[1:11:16] church, the Bible said uh the grass
[1:11:18] witherth the flower fadeth but the word
[1:11:22] of God stands forever. Oh church,
[1:11:25] hallelujah. If it's not God's word, it
[1:11:28] stays and it continues for a while and
[1:11:30] it seem as though it's progressive.
[1:11:32] Hello. But church, it has an end to it.
[1:11:35] But the Bible said, "But only the word
[1:11:38] of God stands forever because the word
[1:11:41] of God is
[1:11:42] eternal." And if you are part of that
[1:11:45] word that put you right in the in the
[1:11:48] eternal position like God
[1:11:52] if you are born again with God word in
[1:11:55] your heart. Hallelujah. You're as
[1:11:58] eternal as God is and everything else
[1:12:01] pass away but God's word. Hallelujah.
[1:12:05] Verse 13, the Bible said, "But the which
[1:12:07] of the angel said he at any time, sit at
[1:12:11] my right hand until I made thy enemies
[1:12:14] thy
[1:12:15] foottool?" Paul responding, verse 14, he
[1:12:19] said, "Are they not all ministering
[1:12:21] spirit sent forth to minister for them
[1:12:24] who shall be here of
[1:12:27] salvation?" Oh my. Are you there at the
[1:12:30] church? In other words, they are not
[1:12:33] your leader. They're not in control of
[1:12:35] your life. But they are your servant.
[1:12:38] Hallelujah. That's why that's the reason
[1:12:40] why they were created to conduct service
[1:12:43] on behalf of the church on behalf of the
[1:12:46] seed of God. And so if they're not doing
[1:12:50] that, it means then that they're out of
[1:12:53] position. And if they're out of
[1:12:55] position, h anything they do, h it's
[1:12:58] against the word of God and it won't
[1:13:01] last. Hallelujah. Church, God is only
[1:13:05] known by
[1:13:08] revelation. He's only known by
[1:13:10] revelation. And he gave the complete
[1:13:13] revelation of himself by the word only
[1:13:16] to seal to sons of God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:20] Praise God. And we said who are a part
[1:13:23] of the genes. Hallelujah. Not angel. But
[1:13:27] he gave the complete revelation of
[1:13:29] himself to the sons who are part of this
[1:13:32] gene. Hallelujah. Not just a part of
[1:13:35] revelation. In other word, brother Benam
[1:13:37] said when God brought the angel into
[1:13:39] being. This was before the world was. He
[1:13:42] said the angel know him as God. They had
[1:13:45] a part of the revelation but not the
[1:13:48] complete revelation. They only know him
[1:13:50] as father. But church but you know him
[1:13:54] as redeemer. You know him as savior. You
[1:13:58] know him as provider. In other word, you
[1:14:01] get more of the revelation of God. Why?
[1:14:04] Because you're a sunship. Hallelujah.
[1:14:07] Put you in a position to know who God
[1:14:10] is. Amen. And the only way you can know
[1:14:14] who you are. You see, in a battle, you
[1:14:17] cannot go in a battle wondering who you
[1:14:19] are. You got to believe, hallelujah,
[1:14:21] that you are able, you're competent,
[1:14:24] you're reliable, you're able to take
[1:14:26] this enemy. And you must believe you
[1:14:28] must be able to defeat that enemy. If
[1:14:32] you go in a enemy in in a battle without
[1:14:34] without that confidence that the enemy
[1:14:37] will get you. But when you're confident,
[1:14:40] you know, it reminds me when I was back
[1:14:43] home as a law
[1:14:45] enforcement, you know, it was my joy
[1:14:47] really to walk in my uniform on the
[1:14:50] street. You know, I didn't need any
[1:14:52] backing. I didn't need anyone. I was in
[1:14:54] my uniform. And so when I walk, they
[1:14:56] said when you walking, you must walk
[1:14:58] bossy. You know, you lift your chest,
[1:15:00] your your hats shine, your shoes shine,
[1:15:02] and you walk slow. You don't walk fast
[1:15:04] really because you want everyone to know
[1:15:06] that, hey, the law is here. And when
[1:15:09] they see the law, everybody keep on
[1:15:11] running up and down. Everything fall
[1:15:13] perfectly in line. Why? Because,
[1:15:15] hallelujah, they recognize the authority
[1:15:17] that comes with the uniform. Oh church.
[1:15:21] Hallelujah. Listen, if you can recognize
[1:15:23] uh who you are, it doesn't matter what
[1:15:26] battle that Satan want to bring at your
[1:15:28] door, hallelujah, church, you cannot be
[1:15:30] defeated because the word of God
[1:15:33] declares that you're more than conqueror
[1:15:35] to him who have loved you. Hallelujah.
[1:15:38] Praise
[1:15:39] God.
[1:15:41] Amen.
[1:15:43] Hallelujah. Praise God. Are you there
[1:15:46] with me, church? So by faith church, the
[1:15:50] bride catches that
[1:15:52] revelation, hallelujah, of the perfect
[1:15:55] thought of God. Because you see what God
[1:15:57] wants, church, God want the bride to
[1:16:01] live by every word. Hallelujah. The the
[1:16:04] God wants you to know exactly what his
[1:16:07] perfect will is. Hallelujah. And so in
[1:16:10] order to do that, hallelujah, God will
[1:16:12] have to open the mystery. In other
[1:16:14] words, hallelujah. This hallelujah this
[1:16:18] gene of God this part of God cannot be a
[1:16:21] mystery to you. Hallelujah. It have to
[1:16:24] be been be known hallelujah that you can
[1:16:26] able to manifest it. You what I'm saying
[1:16:29] to you now?
[1:16:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so when he
[1:16:33] when we saw Adam had in the book of
[1:16:37] Genesis said hallelujah God gave him the
[1:16:41] title deed of redemption.
[1:16:44] said it was an abstract title deed. And
[1:16:47] he said, "What kind of title deed was
[1:16:49] that?" He said, "It was the title deed
[1:16:51] of the entire heart and of eternal
[1:16:54] life." Are you there, church?
[1:16:56] Hallelujah. And what type of deed was it
[1:17:00] he was able to do with that deed? You
[1:17:02] see, with that type of deed, he was
[1:17:04] able, hallelujah, to tap into the
[1:17:06] supernatural and see the perfect will of
[1:17:09] God and speak God's word. You know what
[1:17:12] the Bible said? that the enemy was in
[1:17:14] the garden of God. He was standing there
[1:17:17] with Adam having that ty and he was
[1:17:21] powerless. Hallelujah. Because when the
[1:17:24] world is in action, it cannot be
[1:17:26] stopped. There's no demon that can stop
[1:17:28] the
[1:17:29] world. So he held the world and the
[1:17:33] world was in flesh made manifested. You
[1:17:37] said how did Adam knew to call the the
[1:17:42] creation. Hallelujah. It did that
[1:17:44] because Hal was the part of the eternal
[1:17:47] source. He could speak the eternal word
[1:17:50] in its perfect context. And when God
[1:17:53] hear that word, God said, "Amen."
[1:17:58] Amen. Hallelujah. How you got me,
[1:18:00] church? Do you know it's rare when God
[1:18:03] said, "I am pleased." In Genesis, he was
[1:18:06] pleased. Uh when Jesus was here, he was
[1:18:08] pleased. Uh but church, but in your day,
[1:18:11] God will be made pleased again. Uh
[1:18:14] because the bride had have the word of
[1:18:16] God. And brother Brham said, "And she
[1:18:19] will be the final voice for the final
[1:18:22] huh. She have thus said the Lord." Uh
[1:18:25] she received the word of
[1:18:29] God.
[1:18:31] Hallelujah. Oh my. I never intended to
[1:18:36] to preach intended to preach to
[1:18:38] teach. I'm so sorry. Kind of run out of
[1:18:42] breath.
[1:18:44] Amen. Hallelujah. But that title
[1:18:48] deed. Hallelujah. If I can show you what
[1:18:50] it is, it's life.
[1:18:54] Hallelujah. It is the life source. In
[1:18:57] other word, hallelujah. As I use the
[1:19:00] illustration of the tree, where did the
[1:19:02] leaf come from? It was in the life
[1:19:05] source. Hallelujah. But let me tell you
[1:19:08] something that is beautiful. God knows
[1:19:11] every leaf that is in the source.
[1:19:14] Hallelujah. That is the power of his
[1:19:17] omniscency. By his omniscience, he's
[1:19:19] able to see all things. God knows all
[1:19:23] things. Amen. Hallelujah. And so he hand
[1:19:27] that book to Hadam. Hallelujah. And so
[1:19:31] Hadam had the mind of God and he could
[1:19:34] speak the perfect word. Hallelujah. And
[1:19:38] Hallelujah. You know one writer said,
[1:19:40] "And when Adam say the word, the word
[1:19:42] will go out of his mouth and there will
[1:19:45] flash like a lightning." Hallelujah. And
[1:19:47] it will create his desire. Oh church.
[1:19:50] Hallelujah. Praise God. I believe that
[1:19:53] title deed is being restored to the
[1:19:56] bride in the same
[1:19:58] time.
[1:19:59] Hallelujah.
[1:20:01] Hallelujah.
[1:20:03] Hallelujah. So in this position, we
[1:20:06] could speak the eternal word right from
[1:20:09] the mind of God. And we say church that
[1:20:12] the thoughts of God are a
[1:20:17] reality. Now this is hard to explain.
[1:20:21] I'm trying to show you, hallelujah, that
[1:20:24] before a tree can bear a fruit, the
[1:20:27] creator of the tree know every fruit
[1:20:29] that the tree will be will will create.
[1:20:32] Hallelujah. And so if if the tree had a
[1:20:35] way of accepting that, hallelujah. That
[1:20:38] all that is in me will be made
[1:20:40] manifested. Hallelujah. Then the tree
[1:20:43] cannot be defeated. Why? because it has
[1:20:46] a source by which all it it eternal
[1:20:49] resources of understanding is coming
[1:20:51] from our church. Hallelujah. Do you know
[1:20:54] that we have received a voice from God
[1:20:57] uh that spoke from the eternities uh and
[1:20:59] he speaks the eternal things and church
[1:21:02] we have heard an eternal voice uh that
[1:21:05] speak the eternal word uh and we said
[1:21:08] this bride uh have eternity behind skin
[1:21:11] again.
[1:21:13] Hallelujah.
[1:21:14] Praise God.
[1:21:19] Hallelujah. It's real and they are
[1:21:22] eternal and they hold the mystery of
[1:21:25] God. It's all the mystery of God. We
[1:21:28] stay a mystery if you are not a seed.
[1:21:30] But if you are seed, it's not a mystery.
[1:21:33] It's a reality. Hallelujah. Because we
[1:21:36] are called to step in that reality.
[1:21:38] Hallelujah. on anything else outside of
[1:21:41] that reality is not a reality.
[1:21:44] Hallelujah. The only reality is God's
[1:21:47] perfect word. Hallelujah. If we're able
[1:21:52] to see it. So God's divine nature, the
[1:21:56] perfect word, hallelujah, was the
[1:22:00] perfect word of God in him. Hallel that
[1:22:04] was made manifested alive by the spoken
[1:22:07] word. Hallelujah. And they were brought
[1:22:10] into
[1:22:11] manifestation by the sons of God,
[1:22:14] speaking them into existence in their
[1:22:17] season. Hallelujah. 1 Corinthian 2 and
[1:22:20] verse 9 the Bible
[1:22:22] said but as it is written eyes have not
[1:22:26] seen nor hears heard neither have it
[1:22:29] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:22:32] which God has prepared for them that
[1:22:35] love him but God has revealed them unto
[1:22:39] us by his spirit for the spirit searchth
[1:22:43] all things yeah the deep things of
[1:22:47] God. Sorry. For what? For what man
[1:22:51] knoweth the things of a man? Save the
[1:22:54] spirit of man which is in him. Even so
[1:22:58] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[1:23:01] spirit of God. Are you there church?
[1:23:05] Hallelujah. And so we said to restore
[1:23:08] those hallelujah to whom it is written
[1:23:10] to. Hallelujah. Halle they will catch
[1:23:14] that word. Hallelujah. And listen
[1:23:17] church, it cannot be a mystery because
[1:23:21] you have received the spirit of God. And
[1:23:24] the spirit of God knows the mind of God
[1:23:27] revealed in your heart the perfect will
[1:23:30] of God. I I am I'm just emphasizing that
[1:23:33] that you see exactly. Hallelujah. That
[1:23:35] you're not defeated, that you're
[1:23:37] victorious. Hallelujah. And so church, I
[1:23:41] like to move a little bit higher if you
[1:23:44] can follow with me a little bit. Now we
[1:23:46] look on this life because but when I'm
[1:23:49] talk about the the book of of or uh the
[1:23:52] title deed that Adam had and so we look
[1:23:56] on life, we look on this mortal life and
[1:24:00] we look on the nature associating with
[1:24:04] this mortal life. Brother Benham said
[1:24:07] hallelujah life is precious to God and
[1:24:10] God inscribed it had a life in a book
[1:24:13] and all your walk all your journey
[1:24:17] hallelujah was already inscribed in the
[1:24:20] book of life are you there my church and
[1:24:23] so when you came into the world you came
[1:24:25] subjected to this mortal life hallelujah
[1:24:28] we came subjected to the conditions of
[1:24:31] this mortal life we're subjected uh we
[1:24:34] had to go school by myself going to
[1:24:37] school, you know. Hallelujah. We had to
[1:24:39] work. We we we when we sit, we go to the
[1:24:42] hospital. Hallelujah. But church, can
[1:24:44] can I catch your thought a little
[1:24:46] better? Look at this mortal
[1:24:48] life. Hallelujah. Look out
[1:24:52] unfolds because that's what it is.
[1:24:55] That's the mystery. Hallelujah. But life
[1:24:58] unfolds and all we do is just simply
[1:25:02] connect. In other words, hallelujah. You
[1:25:04] hear what I'm saying to you? I didn't
[1:25:06] know a month ago that I'll be standing
[1:25:08] at this pulpit. I didn't know that.
[1:25:12] Hallelujah. But a thought came and I
[1:25:15] connect with it. And here am I
[1:25:18] manifesting that part of it.
[1:25:21] Hallelujah. Brother John probably didn't
[1:25:24] know that he would would be an engineer
[1:25:26] when he was younger. Hallelujah. But as
[1:25:29] life unfolds, he connects with it. Are
[1:25:33] you there in me church? What am I trying
[1:25:35] to show you? That this mortal life all
[1:25:38] it produces, hallelujah, it's you. Is
[1:25:42] your story while you are here, the
[1:25:45] things you do, the things that happened
[1:25:47] to you. Oh my. Hallelujah. Sometime you
[1:25:52] get sick, sometime you get hungry,
[1:25:54] sometime you end up in the hospital, you
[1:25:57] know, and like myself, like my good
[1:26:00] friend brother Bob, you know, brother
[1:26:01] Bob is getting a little bit older, you
[1:26:03] know. Brother Bob couple years ago
[1:26:05] didn't imagine himself, you know,
[1:26:06] getting this old, but here he is, you
[1:26:08] know, but life unfolds him to that
[1:26:10] position. And you know what brother Bob
[1:26:12] did? He just stepped right into it.
[1:26:15] Hallelujah. Watch it, church. It is life
[1:26:18] by nature unfolds and as it unfolds you
[1:26:22] step into it and as you step into it it
[1:26:25] becomes a reality to
[1:26:27] you. Hallelujah. But let me tell you
[1:26:30] about another life somewhere.
[1:26:33] Hallelujah. Brother said and when you
[1:26:36] come in contact with Christ, God
[1:26:38] transfer you from the from the book of
[1:26:41] life and God put your name in the lamb's
[1:26:44] book of life. Hallelujah. In other word,
[1:26:48] oh my, they ask me why I'm different.
[1:26:53] But here the reason why I come from God,
[1:26:57] another life, from another world, from
[1:27:00] another nature, has entered. Are you
[1:27:04] there me church? And what am I doing?
[1:27:07] I'm unfolding. Hallelujah. And as he as
[1:27:11] he reveal I unfold and I'm walking in
[1:27:16] the perfect walk of God. And brother Bam
[1:27:19] said keep on walking, keep on rejoicing,
[1:27:24] keep on shouting, keep on jumping
[1:27:27] because one day you'll walk all the way
[1:27:30] to eternity.
[1:27:33] Lord, our journey starts here. Our
[1:27:36] eternal life starts here.
[1:27:39] Hallelujah. And so as you walk, it
[1:27:42] become more real. But but said, but as
[1:27:46] you walk, there's a groaning that is
[1:27:48] taking place on the inside because life
[1:27:51] from another world has entered in. And
[1:27:55] Lord, the Bible said, "And as you walk,
[1:27:57] you grown and you grown." Why? Because
[1:28:00] you're calling for more of God. But if
[1:28:04] you're calling for more of God, there's
[1:28:06] more of God somewhere, church.
[1:28:08] Hallelujah.
[1:28:11] Glory.
[1:28:13] Hallelujah. The reason why you're
[1:28:15] calling for it because there's somewhere
[1:28:18] more of God and God give you a little
[1:28:21] tips of it. And every now and then when
[1:28:24] you feel sick and you go down on your
[1:28:26] knees, what you're doing, you're
[1:28:28] connecting back with your eternal source
[1:28:31] because you know by in that state you
[1:28:34] cannot be sick.
[1:28:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Life from
[1:28:41] another world has entered in.
[1:28:45] Hallelujah. God's divine nature and what
[1:28:49] God is doing. Hallelujah. God is
[1:28:52] rewriting your script. God is rewriting
[1:28:55] your life. Hallelujah. You said brother
[1:28:59] Godfield, what happened to my journey
[1:29:01] here? Because I'm still in this mortal
[1:29:04] bodies. Hallelujah. But brother Bham
[1:29:07] said what God did when he transferred
[1:29:09] you from this mortal life and he wrote
[1:29:12] your name and the lamb's book of life.
[1:29:15] Brother said God justify you.
[1:29:18] Hallelujah. In other word for this
[1:29:21] journey for all your endeavor for all
[1:29:24] your battlesh for all your conflict the
[1:29:28] hind the sea of God's
[1:29:31] forgetfulness never more to be
[1:29:33] remembered. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:35] Hallelujah.
[1:29:37] They say, "Abraham, did not you lie?
[1:29:41] Sarah, did not you laugh? Show me the
[1:29:44] record. Here is my Bible." It was that
[1:29:47] record. Because in God's lamb's book of
[1:29:50] life, there's no weakness. There's no
[1:29:53] defeat. There's no sickness. There's no
[1:29:56] Hallelujah.
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:00] Hallelujah.
[1:30:02] We struggle here. Hallelujah. In this
[1:30:05] mortal bodies, but we feel the pull.
[1:30:10] Hallelujah. Something from another
[1:30:13] world. It's calling my name. He said,
[1:30:17] "Child, you belongs to me." And I'm
[1:30:20] saying, I'm responding. I said, "Papa, I
[1:30:23] recognize that voice." Hallelujah. And
[1:30:26] he's saying, "Son, h you're more than
[1:30:29] able to do the
[1:30:31] impossible. You're more than able to
[1:30:34] overcome. You're more than able to
[1:30:37] achieve the maximum." Why? Because I am
[1:30:41] standing by
[1:30:43] you. I'm standing by your
[1:30:46] side.
[1:30:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:30:51] You're there with me, church. Amen. Let
[1:30:53] me watch the time.
[1:30:57] Hallelujah. And
[1:30:58] so, hallelujah. You see, the God we
[1:31:02] serve is a wonderful God. You see,
[1:31:07] hallelujah. To
[1:31:09] ensure what I'm saying to you this
[1:31:11] evening, to ensure that your victory is
[1:31:15] sure. To ensure, hallelujah, that you're
[1:31:19] not defeated. Hallelujah. What God did,
[1:31:23] Hallelujah. It did not stay in heaven
[1:31:25] while you fighting the battle. Holler
[1:31:28] ear and hurt. But what he does church,
[1:31:31] he descended. Because listen, if his son
[1:31:35] is in the battle, hallelujah, he got to
[1:31:38] come get up get into the same battle and
[1:31:40] God and you will have to join forces
[1:31:43] because you see the opposition you're
[1:31:45] dealing with is very cunning. H and he
[1:31:48] knows a heart of war. Hallelujah. But
[1:31:51] our God knows a heart of victory. Are
[1:31:54] you there me church? Hallelujah. And so
[1:31:58] he had to descend church. Hallelujah.
[1:32:01] And see you what I'm saying to you now.
[1:32:03] Oh my. Revelation 12 and verse
[1:32:07] 7.
[1:32:09] Hallelujah. The Bible
[1:32:14] said, "And there was war in heaven. And
[1:32:18] Michael and his angel fought against the
[1:32:22] dragon. And the dragon fought against
[1:32:25] fought and his angel and prevailed not.
[1:32:28] Neither was their place found anymore in
[1:32:32] heaven. And the great dragon was cast
[1:32:36] out. That old serpent called the devil
[1:32:39] and Satan which deceiveth the whole
[1:32:43] world. He was cast out into the earth.
[1:32:47] and his angel were cast out with him.
[1:32:51] And I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:32:54] heaven, "Now is
[1:32:56] salvation. Now is come salvation and
[1:32:59] strength and the kingdom of God and the
[1:33:02] power of his Christ. For the accuser,
[1:33:06] call it." That's what I want to preach
[1:33:07] on the next time. That that
[1:33:10] accuser the accuser of our brethren is
[1:33:14] cast down which accused them before our
[1:33:17] God day and night. Hallelujah. When the
[1:33:20] Bible said, "And they overcame by the
[1:33:24] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[1:33:26] their testimony, and they love not their
[1:33:29] lives unto death." Hallelujah. Praise
[1:33:33] God. So now I'm saying church.
[1:33:36] Hallelujah. Now you understand why it is
[1:33:38] necessary. Hallelujah. For you to win
[1:33:40] this war. Hal, you got to know where
[1:33:43] your victory is at that your victory is
[1:33:45] in the word. And the word that you're
[1:33:47] standing on is eternal. Hallelujah. And
[1:33:51] that God didn't just give you a Bible
[1:33:52] word that you walk with an empty Bible
[1:33:55] walking. No. What God did, God take it
[1:33:58] from the pages and put the word in your
[1:34:01] flesh. So you become a walking epistle,
[1:34:05] a living victory. In other word, if this
[1:34:08] word cannot be defeated, brotherham
[1:34:10] said, in every instance when Satan
[1:34:13] challenged the word, he's defeated.
[1:34:16] Hallelujah.
[1:34:18] Praise God. Oh my. So the war that
[1:34:22] started in
[1:34:23] heaven, the Bible said, "Woe unto the
[1:34:27] inhabitants of the hurt, for the
[1:34:30] accuser, your enemy has descended unto
[1:34:34] the hurt having great wrath, knowing
[1:34:37] that his time is short."
[1:34:41] Hallelujah. Praise God. And so Ephesians
[1:34:44] 6 and verse 11, the Bible said,
[1:34:49] hallelujah, put on the old armor of God
[1:34:53] that you be able to stand against the ws
[1:34:56] of the devil. For we wrestle not against
[1:34:58] flesh and blood, but against
[1:35:00] principalities and powers. Hallelujah.
[1:35:04] Against rulers of darkness of this
[1:35:07] world, against spiritual wickedness in
[1:35:10] high places. Hallelujah. Church, when
[1:35:13] they were cast out of heaven, where did
[1:35:16] they go? Hallelujah. They're heavywhere.
[1:35:20] Demons are heavywhere. They inoculate
[1:35:23] the atmosphere. They're in the school.
[1:35:25] They're in the church. They're in the
[1:35:26] politics. They're in the rumbar. They're
[1:35:28] everywhere. Church, hallelujah. The
[1:35:31] demons from hell. They have inoculated.
[1:35:34] Hallelujah. And so the Bible call them
[1:35:37] the prince of the power of the hear. Are
[1:35:40] you there, my church? Why? What are they
[1:35:42] doing? They are suppressing us.
[1:35:45] Hallelujah. You you feel sometime you
[1:35:48] pray and nothing happened. What is
[1:35:50] happening? Because of the war, because
[1:35:53] of the demonic power and the demon
[1:35:55] demonic influences. But church, I have
[1:35:59] news for you that your prince Michael
[1:36:03] has descended to fight your battles for
[1:36:07] you. Hallelujah.
[1:36:11] Amen. Glory to
[1:36:14] God. Hallelujah. Spoiled principalities
[1:36:17] and powers. That's what they are.
[1:36:21] Hallelujah. They have lost their first
[1:36:23] estate and they came here to the act of
[1:36:27] deception and the whole the whole world
[1:36:30] into captivity. Hallelujah. until
[1:36:33] brother said when man fell into that
[1:36:35] state of sin it was impossible to get
[1:36:38] back to God. Hallelujah. And with all
[1:36:41] the demonic forces that are acting upon
[1:36:44] you and I. Hallelujah. In other words,
[1:36:46] the battle is sore. The battle is real.
[1:36:49] It seem as though there's no victory to
[1:36:52] this. Hallelujah. But let me tell you
[1:36:54] church. Hallelujah. I tell you this
[1:36:57] evening, hold on a little bit further.
[1:37:00] The battle is long, but the Bible said,
[1:37:03] "Though you go to the water, it will not
[1:37:05] overflow you. Though you go to the fire,
[1:37:08] it will not burn you." Are you there, my
[1:37:11] church? He told David told him in the
[1:37:13] Psalms, he said, "Be still and know that
[1:37:17] I am God. I be exalted among the
[1:37:20] heathen. I be exalted in the hurt."
[1:37:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Can we get
[1:37:28] excited again?
[1:37:30] Oh my. Now you hear what I'm saying to
[1:37:32] you now. Hallelujah. We are here and
[1:37:34] hurt and it feel like we are solid by
[1:37:36] darkness. We are solid by a dark
[1:37:39] reality. But let me tell you tonight,
[1:37:42] hallelujah. That in heaven, hallelujah,
[1:37:45] beyond the throne barriers of these
[1:37:48] angelic forces in heaven, the word is
[1:37:52] already settled. Hallelujah. Your
[1:37:55] victory is already settled in heaven.
[1:37:57] Are you there church? All it need is a
[1:38:01] conveyance. Somebody to come down from
[1:38:04] heaven and whisper in my ears about my
[1:38:08] victory. Are you there church? I need a
[1:38:11] word from God. I need to hear about my
[1:38:14] victory. Hallelujah. Because if I can
[1:38:16] only hear about it, then Satan won't
[1:38:19] can't stop you
[1:38:21] again. So your victory is there. But I
[1:38:25] am here, brother John.
[1:38:27] How do I be become victorious? I need to
[1:38:30] get my victory. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:38:34] Praise God. We saw in Daniel
[1:38:37] 9 Daniel 9 or 10. You can overlap that.
[1:38:40] You can read more chapters. It speaks of
[1:38:42] the same thing. But Daniel, hallelujah,
[1:38:45] was in a stirration. Rebound spoke about
[1:38:48] it. They were taken captive into into
[1:38:50] the land of Babylon there. And Daniel,
[1:38:53] it was close to the time where Daniel
[1:38:56] need a word from God. I need to hear
[1:38:59] something from God. Hallelujah. And so
[1:39:02] Daniel set his heart in prayer. And
[1:39:05] while Daniel was praying and he started
[1:39:07] the first day, nothing happened. Church.
[1:39:10] Oh my.
[1:39:12] Hallelujah. When he start the second
[1:39:14] day, nothing happened. Hallelujah.
[1:39:17] Daniel could have gotten frustrated and
[1:39:19] walk away, but he stays strong. And for
[1:39:22] 21 days, he was praying. Hallelujah. For
[1:39:27] 21 days, he was praying. Hallelujah. And
[1:39:31] Daniel 10 and verse 19, the Bible said
[1:39:34] when Gabriel was conveying the message
[1:39:36] to Daniel, the Bible said, and it said,
[1:39:39] "Oh man, great to be beloved, fear not.
[1:39:43] Peace be unto you. Be strong. be, he
[1:39:47] said, be strong. Yay, be strong. And
[1:39:51] when he had spoken unto me, I was
[1:39:54] threatened. And said, let my Lord speak,
[1:39:58] for thou hast threatened me. Then said,
[1:40:01] he knows thou therefore I come unto
[1:40:05] thee. Now I will return to fight with
[1:40:09] the prince of Persia. And when I'm gone
[1:40:12] forth, lo the prince of Gersia of Greca
[1:40:16] shall come. Verse 21. I want you to mark
[1:40:19] verse 21. He said, "But I will show thee
[1:40:23] that which is noted in the scripture."
[1:40:27] He needed a voice. He needed a word. And
[1:40:31] so Gabriel came, hallelujah, and brought
[1:40:34] a word to him.
[1:40:37] Where was that word coming from? It was
[1:40:39] coming from the eternal source. How you
[1:40:42] doing my church? No wonder Paul said God
[1:40:46] at sund times and in diverse manners has
[1:40:49] spoken to the fathers but in these days
[1:40:52] is speaking by Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:40:56] Because church what we need is not an
[1:40:59] angel to come down from heaven and to
[1:41:02] give us a word when the time requires
[1:41:04] it. No church, what we need is a
[1:41:07] connection to the eternal source that
[1:41:10] when you go through your trouble, you're
[1:41:12] connected. You can hear from God. Are
[1:41:15] you there, my church? And you're not
[1:41:17] left alone. And you're confident in
[1:41:19] that.
[1:41:21] You're confident that your source that
[1:41:25] is in heaven is in
[1:41:28] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. After the
[1:41:32] Bible, brother, the message beginning
[1:41:36] and ending of the gentile

[1:42:34] with the word to give the bride.
[1:42:36] Hallelujah. To help her in her battle.

[1:42:58] Christ himself has stepped down.
[1:43:02] Hallelujah. We're getting
[1:43:04] there. Getting close to the end now.
[1:43:07] Hallelujah. And so what I'm saying
[1:43:09] church that your headship hallelujah
[1:43:13] Christ has stepped down. Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] What to do to sit upon the body? Brother
[1:43:20] said that the body was identified in his
[1:43:24] resurrection. Hallelujah. He said that
[1:43:27] when the head came from the grave, the
[1:43:29] body also came from the grave. In other
[1:43:31] word, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He did not
[1:43:35] allow the body to be subjected to the
[1:43:37] will of the enemy. But hallelujah. But
[1:43:40] Michael your head has stepped down to do
[1:43:43] what? To fight for this battle for this
[1:43:46] body. Are you getting me the church?
[1:43:48] Christ is here. Michael is here.
[1:43:51] Hallelujah. And what is he doing? He's
[1:43:53] given the bride the word. And she's
[1:43:56] hearing from the eternal source. And
[1:43:58] she's having faith in the eternal things
[1:44:01] of God.
[1:44:04] Brother said in the message Christ the
[1:44:07] mystery of
[1:44:08] God. Hallelujah. He said the kingdom of
[1:44:12] God is within you said the Bible Jesus
[1:44:16] the kingdom. We are not a denomination.
[1:44:20] We belong to a kingdom and the kingdom
[1:44:23] is the word of God made spirit and life
[1:44:27] in our own life. He said, "Bringing to
[1:44:30] pass every promise in this day." He
[1:44:33] said, "As it did that day when the word
[1:44:36] and God was one." And he said, "And the
[1:44:40] word and God is one in the church today,
[1:44:44] making it the etip of the body that it
[1:44:48] redeem to bring the message in the last
[1:44:51] day and to be taken up from the dead in
[1:44:55] the
[1:44:57] resurrection to go, hallelujah, and will
[1:45:01] restore again as Adam and He in the
[1:45:05] beginning in the garden of Heeden. said
[1:45:07] the three-fold mystery of God.
[1:45:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His body, he
[1:45:14] said, "Oh my, Hallelujah. We're coming
[1:45:17] down to a closure now." Listen what I'm
[1:45:19] saying to you. Hallelujah. You see, we
[1:45:23] saw the headship, the world came down
[1:45:27] three
[1:45:28] times in the full manifestation of
[1:45:31] himself. We saw the word, the complete
[1:45:35] word, hallelujah, came down in the book
[1:45:37] of Genesis when Adam was here.
[1:45:40] Hallelujah. And when the word descended,
[1:45:43] it descended for one purpose. The word
[1:45:46] was descended to be made flesh and to
[1:45:50] operate through the agency of flesh.
[1:45:52] Hallelujah. We saw the word was made
[1:45:55] flesh again in Jesus time. The complete
[1:45:59] revelation of God. Hallelujah. But
[1:46:02] church, hallelujah, can we rejoice
[1:46:05] tonight? Hallelujah. To take us out of
[1:46:08] here. Hallelujah. God, Revelation 10:1.
[1:46:12] The word, hallelujah, has descended. Why
[1:46:15] did he come? He come to take control of
[1:46:19] your flesh. God will dwell in you to do
[1:46:23] what? To fight the battle. It's not
[1:46:26] fighting the battle out there. It's
[1:46:28] fighting the battle from here.
[1:46:32] The word is in you.
[1:46:35] Hallelujah. And if the word is in you,
[1:46:37] tell me who can stand against you.
[1:46:41] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:46:45] Amen. Hallelujah. Brother Bam said in
[1:46:48] the message junction of time is
[1:46:51] infinite. He said he's infinite. He's
[1:46:54] God. He's omn
[1:46:57] omnipotent of the om of the present
[1:47:00] omniscient. You see he knows all things.
[1:47:04] He's all wisdom all and all time is a
[1:47:09] covers all space all power is infinite.
[1:47:14] And if he isn't that he said he's not
[1:47:16] God. And if he isn't almighty God, he
[1:47:20] said if he can't do all thing, he's not
[1:47:24] almighty God. But if he's almighty God,
[1:47:27] he can do all things. So that's the way
[1:47:31] we have to believe him. Oh church.
[1:47:34] Hallelujah. The infinite God is here.
[1:47:38] Are you there, church? And what is he
[1:47:41] doing? He's taking us back to the
[1:47:43] eternal thing, back to himself. that
[1:47:46] when we read the word that's why he had
[1:47:48] to send a prophet in the same time
[1:47:51] because we by oursel could not read the
[1:47:53] mystery of God. Hallelujah church is no
[1:47:56] longer a mystery. We are not reading a
[1:47:59] mysterious book but we are reading a
[1:48:01] book of reality. We are reading the the
[1:48:04] reality of what God say about us. Oh we
[1:48:06] will fight. Oh we will overcome. Oh we
[1:48:09] are not defeated. Hallelujah. And at the
[1:48:12] end of it all, the bride will take
[1:48:15] possession.
[1:48:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:48:21] Hallelujah. So under heaven, hallelu, we
[1:48:24] are fighting, but church, hallelujah,
[1:48:26] but there's a word that God has placed
[1:48:29] in our heart. Hal, I'll just take one
[1:48:32] more quote and then we finish.
[1:48:33] Hallelujah. And I want you to get this.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah. In the message, Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] Uh the uh Israel by himself preached
[1:48:43] 1954. Brother Bam said God wanted to
[1:48:47] show you how can I point at you. He said
[1:48:51] God wanted to show you by his counsel.
[1:48:54] He wanted it. He confirmed it by an oath
[1:48:58] that you would not have any reckless um
[1:49:02] term about it. He said now watch here.
[1:49:04] He said by two immutable thing in which
[1:49:08] hal it is impossible for God to lie. He
[1:49:12] said that we may have a strong a strong
[1:49:16] consolation. Hallelujah. Who have fled
[1:49:19] for refuge who lay hold upon the hope
[1:49:22] that is set before us. He said it's
[1:49:25] absolutely impossible for God to lie.
[1:49:28] You know why God can't lie? Because when
[1:49:30] God speak, God is looking within himself
[1:49:34] and God seen the action before it
[1:49:36] happened. So when God tell you about it,
[1:49:39] God foreseen it. Are you there me
[1:49:42] church? And if God say you're
[1:49:43] victorious, God can't lie. Because God
[1:49:47] already see your victory. Are you there
[1:49:49] church? If God say you are healed,
[1:49:51] you're already healed. Why? Because God
[1:49:54] saw that in himself. Oh
[1:49:57] my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You're not
[1:50:00] defeated. So said by two little thing it
[1:50:05] was impossible for God to lie. He said
[1:50:07] it's absolutely impossible for God to
[1:50:10] lie. He said that's the one thing. He
[1:50:13] said is that right now it's impossible
[1:50:16] for God to lie. He said two of them two
[1:50:19] immutable things. These are your two
[1:50:21] mutable things. He said first it's
[1:50:24] impossible for God to lie. Now the next
[1:50:27] thing is he said that God himself that
[1:50:31] can't lie and and he said and to make it
[1:50:34] perfect he said he swore by it
[1:50:39] my he said amen and he would confirm it
[1:50:42] with an oh what a great listen church
[1:50:46] too immutable thing it's impossible for
[1:50:50] God to lie hallelujah because God when
[1:50:53] he says it to you God knows the hand as
[1:50:56] it were from the beginning. He sees the
[1:50:58] hand and when he speaks the head,
[1:51:01] hallelujah, he speak the word and the
[1:51:03] word creates because that's the creative
[1:51:06] power and the authority of God's
[1:51:09] word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:51:12] God. It's impossible for God to lie. Too
[1:51:17] immutable thing. Are you there with me,
[1:51:20] church? It's
[1:51:22] impossible for God to lie. In closing
[1:51:27] tonight,
[1:51:28] hallelujah. You see, the trials of our
[1:51:33] faith that they're not here to push you
[1:51:38] under, but the trial of your faith is
[1:51:42] sent forth to mature
[1:51:43] you.
[1:51:45] Hallelujah. You see, listen what I'm
[1:51:48] saying to you. There are things about
[1:51:50] yourself that you don't even know. There
[1:51:53] are potential that you possess that you
[1:51:56] don't even know until you are put in the
[1:51:59] situation. How? Are you there me church?
[1:52:01] You see, God chose you for this. Above
[1:52:05] all the angel, God chose you for this
[1:52:09] because God hallelujah sees the
[1:52:12] potential and God want to manifest it.
[1:52:16] But listen, but how could he do it? How
[1:52:19] could he manifest it if there's no
[1:52:21] reason to call for it? And so what he
[1:52:25] does, he put the seed in time and
[1:52:29] subject that seed to
[1:52:31] conditions. Are you there me church?
[1:52:34] Knowing exactly that all it take is just
[1:52:36] a consciousness of the reality that I
[1:52:40] can. By God's grace, I can. By God's
[1:52:43] will, I can. Are you there, church?
[1:52:46] Hallelujah. There's no defeated
[1:52:48] children. God's children are all
[1:52:50] victorious.
[1:52:54] Hallelujah. By God's grace, we are
[1:52:57] called overcomers. Hallelujah. And so

[1:53:04] be when you receive that new birth, your
[1:53:07] victory is already in your seed. Your
[1:53:10] overcoming is already there. Your
[1:53:12] healing is already in you. All it takes
[1:53:15] is a reality is a is a is a wake up an
[1:53:19] awakening to the reality. Are you there
[1:53:21] church? Oh my. That's why the enemy is
[1:53:25] is is presenting himself as if he's
[1:53:27] strong because in our minds we are
[1:53:30] wondering can God do it? What what is
[1:53:33] the result? Should I should I should I
[1:53:35] venture there? Hallelujah. There's so
[1:53:38] much uncertainty. Oh my, you know, every
[1:53:41] time I think about this, I remember, you
[1:53:43] know, myself talking to brother Joe, you
[1:53:46] know, brother Joe, we said that man, you

[1:55:07] defeat this enemy. You're more than
[1:55:09] conqueror to him who have loved you.
[1:55:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I I didn't have
[1:55:16] this quote but the scripture but you can
[1:55:18] bring it. First Peter uh uh 4 and verse
[1:55:22] 12. The Bible said, "Beloved, think it
[1:55:26] not strange concern the fire trial which
[1:55:30] is to try you. Although some strange
[1:55:32] things is is not strange thing is God's
[1:55:36] perfecting your character. God want to
[1:55:38] bring out more of himself. And so when
[1:55:41] he's subjected, he's watching you. Come
[1:55:43] out." Hallelujah. He's watching your
[1:55:45] action. Hallelujah. Are you going to
[1:55:47] back off? Are you going to run away? But
[1:55:49] sons of God, you don't run away in
[1:55:52] battle. You stand your ground and you
[1:55:55] fight uh with all your might and you
[1:55:57] believe in the God in whom you're
[1:55:59] trusting in. He cannot fail because he
[1:56:03] is God.
[1:56:06] What are you worrying about? Well, the
[1:56:09] enemy will get you. Hallelujah. If he
[1:56:11] get you, he'll get you a long time.
[1:56:13] Hallelujah. If if he's going to kill
[1:56:15] you, he'll kill you a long time. I I I'm
[1:56:18] I'm just a a record of that really. The
[1:56:21] enemy does everything in trying to kill
[1:56:24] me. But here am I still standing today.
[1:56:26] I'm singing my song of victory. Hal I'm
[1:56:29] sing hallelujah. I'm still singing
[1:56:32] victory in Jesus my savior forever. He
[1:56:36] bought me and he he sought me with his
[1:56:38] redeeming blood. He loved me here. I
[1:56:41] know it. Hallelujah. And all my joy is
[1:56:45] Hallelujah. I don't Hallelujah.
[1:56:48] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He plunged me
[1:56:51] into victory beneath the plunge the
[1:56:54] crimson floor. Hallelujah. So the Bible
[1:56:57] say don't think some strange things is
[1:56:59] happening to you. God is perfecting you.
[1:57:03] Take your mind off the the the conflict
[1:57:05] and look on the victory because
[1:57:07] somewhere in the midst of that God
[1:57:09] promise is going to come through. He
[1:57:11] promised is going to come through
[1:57:13] church. Hallelujah. But verse 13 said,
[1:57:15] "But rejoice in as much as ye are
[1:57:18] partakers of Christ suffering, that when
[1:57:21] his glory shall reveal, he may be glad
[1:57:25] also with exceedingly joy. But if he re
[1:57:28] if he be reproached by the name of
[1:57:30] Christ, happy are he, for the spirit of
[1:57:33] glory and of God rest upon you."
[1:57:36] Hallelujah. And on their part is he
[1:57:39] spoken of but on your part he is

[2:15:29] Lord, I thank you, Father
[2:15:32] God, that you give us a spirit that just
[2:15:35] don't
[2:15:35] quit. You give us a spirit that keeps
[2:15:38] fighting on even though the battle is
[2:15:41] hard and times are tough and all the
[2:15:44] things we go through in life. Lord,
[2:15:47] we thank you for a word as our brother
[2:15:50] preached tonight.
[2:15:53] Lord that shows us the battle but also
[2:15:57] shows us the victory.
[2:16:00] Lord, I thank you for my
[2:16:01] battles. I thank you for every trial,
[2:16:05] every hard time, Lord. And I sit here
[2:16:07] and give you praise, Lord.
[2:16:10] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Father.
[2:16:14] I pray Lord that the words of this
[2:16:16] sermon tonight touch us something deep
[2:16:19] inside and break something open Lord
[2:16:21] that we could really see the truth Lord
[2:16:24] behind those statements. Not just to
[2:16:27] understand it in knowledge Lord but to
[2:16:29] feel it deep down in our soul that you
[2:16:31] may take your place Lord on the abode of
[2:16:33] our hearts Father God that we may see
[2:16:35] that true victory
[2:16:38] and walk towards it Lord. move us past a
[2:16:41] place of trying into a place of
[2:16:44] position. Lord, Father, lead
[2:16:47] us. I pray for Brother John, Lord, our
[2:16:51] pastor. I I pray that you continue to
[2:16:54] unfold revelation in his heart. Lord, as
[2:16:57] brother Bob said, that we may see
[2:17:01] more, Lord. I said, if we want more,
[2:17:05] there must be more of you. Lord, we want
[2:17:08] more tonight. Lord, we're not satisfied
[2:17:10] with the status quo. You said there
[2:17:12] would be a church, Lord. I pray that we
[2:17:14] are that church, Lord. Father, whatever
[2:17:17] it is we got to do, Lord, bring the
[2:17:19] revelation. Bring the word,
[2:17:22] Lord. Thank you for brother Garfield,
[2:17:25] Lord, and his dedication to your word.

[2:17:30] for putting himself aside, Lord, and

[2:17:36] way. restore any virtue that has left
[2:17:38] them, Lord. Father, we pray for Sister
[2:17:41] Blanca and Sister Selena. And we pray
[2:17:44] that your angels go all around them,
[2:17:46] Lord. Whatever sickness, whatever demon,
[2:17:49] whatever try to hinder them, Lord, we
[2:17:51] pray that your angels go and stand right
[2:17:54] beside
