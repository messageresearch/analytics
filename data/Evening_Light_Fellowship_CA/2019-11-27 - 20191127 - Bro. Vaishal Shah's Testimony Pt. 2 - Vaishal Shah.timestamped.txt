[42:02] a mad trust for singing the revelation
[42:05] of what we're doing we're coming to him
[42:08] because we need him amen
[42:10] we need him every hour we need him every
[42:12] second amen it's not a moment but we
[42:15] need him and especially in this our
[42:18] brother we consider the scripture we
[42:20] consider the prophecy that Christ
[42:22] Himself spoke of this day this age old
[42:25] brother I tell you it's just it's just
[42:27] so I like in your heart and mind our
[42:30] need for his presence our need for his
[42:33] anointing on the inside of the inside
[42:35] and when he said and I've mentioned that
[42:37] many times and he said he said if he
[42:39] didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved
[42:41] because there's going so deceiving the
[42:44] love of many wax cold and not completely
[42:46] gone but it's cold a man and he said to
[42:50] me and he said deceiving that beam to
[42:52] see and he went on went on he said it's
[42:54] gone it's gonna be so bad he said I
[42:56] don't shorten time to be no flesh saved
[42:58] that's pretty bad
[43:00] a man is getting worse and worse and
[43:02] worse so thank God brother for for his
[43:05] presence think offer his anointing thank
[43:07] God for his promise that he's gonna
[43:09] shorten time for the elects sake a man
[43:12] so I trust by the grace of God that were
[43:15] getting closer and closer and closer to
[43:17] the resurrection rapture a man than it
[43:20] was when the truly when the Prophet was
[43:22] here a man so he's gone on for a I said
[43:26] over fifty years but we trust by the
[43:28] grace of God not much longer and we'll
[43:30] be gone I trust will be gone not here to
[43:34] miss it but will be gone by the grace of
[43:36] God we need you every hour praise the
[43:40] Lord
[43:40] so the Lord bless you and praying the
[43:44] grace of God to be with our brother
[43:45] vice-chair as he comes up to do part two
[43:48] of his testimony amen and it was good to
[43:53] what he brought out on Sunday concerning
[43:56] what was going on in India and it helped
[44:00] us to better understand you know the
[44:02] situation in India and not only are our
[44:04] brothers circumstances and what he
[44:06] endured and what he experienced
[44:08] but what believers are
[44:10] enduring there now and what believers
[44:12] are dealing with now in India a man so
[44:16] brother considering what our brother
[44:17] said on Sunday the spray for the
[44:19] brothers and sisters in India a man and
[44:21] the grace of God be with them and again
[44:24] we're praying the grace of God be with
[44:26] him to stay in line with the word and
[44:28] not to not to as I know that some AB
[44:31] done
[44:32] unfortunately that they have they have
[44:34] really gotten into fanaticism message
[44:37] some went certain message believers when
[44:39] we pray the grace of God to deliver him
[44:41] a man because that's the spirit of the
[44:43] devil and brother and it is not it not
[44:46] this teaching or this teaching that the
[44:47] Prophet taught himself that's going to
[44:49] bring reproach on the message sometimes
[44:51] it's what those believers so-called
[44:54] believers are teaching it's what those
[44:56] so-called believers are doing and how
[44:58] they do it what they say and how they
[45:00] say it'll bring reproach on the word so
[45:02] we pray the grace of God to the
[45:04] believers in India amen
[45:06] so let's just be in prayer for them but
[45:08] don't don't just say well there that's
[45:10] believers in me in India they're doing
[45:12] fine no no they're being tested brother
[45:15] and our brother by so I'm sure is aware
[45:17] of it and he knows what we're what I'm
[45:19] referring to
[45:20] amen so the grace of God and and I've
[45:24] been in contact a number of times with
[45:26] with the voice of God representative in
[45:29] India so we pray the grace of God to him
[45:31] because it's not his faith is being
[45:34] challenged but again is his
[45:36] determination to hold things you know
[45:39] steady to hold things in the middle of
[45:40] the road a man it's a challenge to our
[45:43] brothers we pray the grace of God to
[45:45] that brother of the voice of God in
[45:48] India and I said not maybe a few years
[45:51] ago that our brother the Lord took our
[45:54] brother's wife home that was a that was
[45:56] a real heart for the brother to deal
[45:59] with a man so we breathe pray grace to
[46:02] our brother the Lord continue to sustain
[46:04] him amen
[46:06] so we want to eventually turn it to our
[46:09] brother Michael amen and to bring into
[46:13] more and more understanding to us
[46:16] concerning what God did in getting him
[46:19] out of India and I said to put laughs a
[46:22] man
[46:24] out of one India to another one a man so
[46:27] again you know God moves in mysterious
[46:29] ways his wonders to perform for me it is
[46:35] it is mysterious for God to do this in
[46:37] Newfoundland for God to do that and new
[46:39] for life and not only that you know
[46:41] after all that we've done by the grace
[46:43] of God through the homepages
[46:45] and the the ministry that we've sent
[46:48] overseas and the pamphlets and the
[46:50] booklets and the pictures and everything
[46:52] and yet when I remember when I went to
[46:55] went into a certain place in the States
[46:57] there through three years ago and met
[47:01] number believers were you from
[47:02] Newfoundland where's that they didn't
[47:05] know where they didn't know where new
[47:06] tonight was a man but the Lord has
[47:09] somebody there to who to inform them of
[47:12] where it was somebody else may be
[47:15] overheard they said don't know where
[47:16] Newfoundland is no didn't know a number
[47:20] of people but again others knew and
[47:24] again it's not because of they were
[47:27] familiar with geography and the maps and
[47:30] all of that but again what God has been
[47:32] doing in Newfoundland amen
[47:35] so we give God the glory brother amen
[47:38] give God the glory and will not take
[47:41] that glory to ourselves you know because
[47:43] again that this is known around the
[47:45] world that's known around the world but
[47:47] we give the glory to God we did it for
[47:49] him amen
[47:51] the glory of what he had and what Gloria
[47:54] what doing amen so to God be the glory
[47:58] and so thank God for bringing our mother
[48:00] vital all the way from India and to
[48:03] Newfoundland and to give us the
[48:04] testimony that he gave us on Sunday to
[48:08] give us a greater understanding of what
[48:11] what get the individuals in India are
[48:13] dealing with a man what he dealt with
[48:16] and yet in at all God brought them to
[48:19] the truth by the grace of God and again
[48:23] God moves in mysterious ways his wonders
[48:25] to perform and it is a wonder definitely
[48:29] a wonder why God did this and why God
[48:32] did that so the Lord blessed our brother
[48:34] when he comes to give us his testimony
[48:37] and I'll just say that I heard for
[48:40] brother brother John Kadesh in Ottawa
[48:43] and being prayer for him he is looking
[48:47] for another church somewhere in order in
[48:50] Ottawa he did attend one on Sunday but
[48:55] he's looking for another one so we pray
[48:58] the grace of God to give him the
[48:59] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and
[49:02] because our brother can pour out a right
[49:05] spirit a right attitude message
[49:07] anointing by the grace of God so we
[49:11] thank the Lord for the for the inflow
[49:14] this Assembly has been on our brother
[49:16] amen and may it continue with him and
[49:20] also he also informed me that he did
[49:24] hear our brother voice will give his
[49:26] testimony on Sunday and he said he
[49:27] enjoyed it it was a blessing so that's
[49:29] good god bless our brother John a man
[49:32] and granting the leadership of the Holy
[49:35] Ghost brought by the great and also
[49:38] there's no more information about the
[49:41] Fulcher we're still waiting on more
[49:45] information regarding about the fortune
[49:46] we leave it with the Lord and committed
[49:49] compact what our brother in in god James
[49:51] amen as I said I wrote I will always
[49:55] remember my fellowship with brother
[49:56] Folger amen and a good spirit a right
[50:02] attitude it's good
[50:04] I appreciate he was he was quite what
[50:08] trying to call it humorous and I
[50:12] remember one time when he came here to
[50:15] do for lion and that's 1985 I believe
[50:18] ready for and they were delayed in
[50:21] Ontario and for finally they did get a

[50:34] go over there when I did he said I would
[50:36] have missed it no I said you would I

[50:40] the Holy Ghost God did God cost you to
[50:42] do that amen he was he was he was wound
[50:45] up because he had missed a first flight
[50:48] and he thought he would miss the second
[50:50] one
[50:51] I said no brother I said that was the
[50:53] Lord and sister function was there yes
[50:56] she's your brother I agree with you a
[50:58] man a man so we have nice fellowship
[51:01] with our brother Fulcher and of course
[51:03] he ministered for us here as well and it

[51:13] remember that we did have a certain
[51:14] brother here ministry at the time too

[51:19] preachers in the full end of its
[51:20] audience and the one brother city was

[53:04] here yes on Sunday and what I was
[53:08] thinking about when they went our
[53:09] brother read it of course I've got notes
[53:11] here in my Bible too and concerning the
[53:15] the parables and and with seven parables
[53:18] but it's represents the seven church
[53:21] ages amen and we're going to read the
[53:26] mystery of the seventh age in Matthew 13
[53:31] and verse 47 thank God
[53:33] rather for the word thank God for the
[53:36] understanding of the word this is
[53:38] tremendous praise the name of the Lord
[53:40] brother again like I said this is just a
[53:43] religious book to a lot of people it's
[53:45] just a Bible or you know that's God's
[53:47] Bible that's God's book but they have so
[53:50] little understanding of the planned
[53:52] purpose and pattern they know this in
[53:55] the Bible they know that's in the Bible
[53:57] and but they wonder what they're lacking
[53:59] is understanding amen
[54:02] they might have wisdom but since we've
[54:04] got wisdom get understanding you know
[54:06] you got you know this you know this you
[54:08] know this and it's in the Bible but do
[54:10] you understand it
[54:11] what what it what is the plan what is
[54:14] the what part is it in the plan what
[54:17] part is it in the purpose of God and the
[54:19] pattern of God most don't don't
[54:21] recognize it but I thank God but I
[54:23] really do thank God for the message of
[54:26] the hour through a prophet that I lights
[54:29] us regarding the plan of God and pattern
[54:33] of God and the purpose of God amen and
[54:36] that's why that's why we have the
[54:38] understanding that we have from Genesis
[54:40] to Revelation to the God be the glory
[54:43] and brother again in Matthew chapter 13
[54:47] to most is just parables but and God
[54:53] diggy the Jesus is comparing the kingdom
[54:55] of God this way or this way or that way
[54:57] yeah but it represents prophecy down
[55:00] through seven ages and in verse 47
[55:05] concerning the seventh mystery
[55:07] and he said again the kingdom of heaven
[55:09] is like unto a net that was cast into
[55:13] the sea and gathered of every kind which
[55:17] when it was full they drew to shore and
[55:21] sat down and gathered the good into
[55:24] vessels but cast the band away
[55:28] this is the our living a separation a
[55:31] man and it says so shall it be at the
[55:35] end of the world
[55:36] the angel shall come forth and sever the
[55:40] wicked from the just among the just
[55:43] God's gonna totally separate a man is
[55:46] elect onto himself sever severing the
[55:49] wicked from among them and shall cast
[55:53] them into the furnace of fire and there
[55:56] shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
[55:58] and jesus said unto them and he
[56:01] understood a man all these things praise
[56:06] the Lord for understanding and they say
[56:09] unto Him yay Lord and then said he unto
[56:12] them therefore every scribe which is
[56:15] instructed under the kingdom of heaven
[56:18] is like unto a man that is an
[56:20] householder which bringeth forth out of
[56:23] his treasure things new and old and
[56:27] that's what God brought forth out of the
[56:29] treasure in these last days the mystery
[56:33] of the seven seals a man the seven full
[56:36] mystery of God to reveal to the bride to
[56:41] give the bride the resurrection and the
[56:42] rapturing faith by the grace of God a
[56:46] man thank God for the revelation of the
[56:50] parables thank God for the understanding
[56:52] of the parables not just stories not
[56:55] just a little lesson here a little
[56:57] lesson there no it's revelation of the
[57:01] mystery of God his revelation of the
[57:03] plan of God the purpose of God and the
[57:05] pattern of God to God be the glory amen
[57:10] we're going to turn to our brother vice

[1:00:18] Lord be with us Lord in Jesus name sir
[1:00:31] it's really good what brother Gerald
[1:00:33] mentioned like about the believers in
[1:00:35] India like it's it's like here also
[1:00:38] believers are like facing persecution
[1:00:40] it's not nothing different it's just the
[1:00:43] nature of persecution here it's like as
[1:00:46] a whole people know Christianity they
[1:00:48] know Bible they know different things
[1:00:51] about the Bible but at the same time
[1:00:52] they don't want the name of God to be
[1:00:54] mentioned whereas when you go back to
[1:00:56] India it's a different persecution like
[1:00:58] they don't know about Bible they don't
[1:01:00] know who is Jesus it's more of the
[1:01:02] religious conflict that is going on and
[1:01:04] persecution at times can be so bad like
[1:01:07] not that I believe it would be a decade
[1:01:11] or two decades ago like a missionary
[1:01:13] family was burned alive like in a
[1:01:16] village and there was recently I read an
[1:01:20] incident I mean like a year or two
[1:01:22] before like there was a pastor and there
[1:01:26] like the people in that village like
[1:01:28] they just beat him up they broke the
[1:01:32] church and then they it's just different
[1:01:36] things were done unto him and they put
[1:01:38] him on a donkey took him around the city
[1:01:39] and it was just a lot of disgraceful
[1:01:42] things were done to him and just a few
[1:01:46] examples like there are many many more
[1:01:48] things
[1:01:48] on so but it's a religious conflict it's
[1:01:51] it's more like it's a more of like a
[1:01:54] communist mentality within the religions
[1:01:56] not as a whole country alright so coming
[1:02:02] to like my testimony so lastly like
[1:02:06] close up on like you know about coming
[1:02:07] to Newfoundland so like when I keep
[1:02:09] before I came to Newfoundland I went on
[1:02:12] the internet and I searched Pentecostal
[1:02:14] church in Newfoundland that's all I knew
[1:02:17] about I didn't have like a full ideals
[1:02:18] of what what a Pentecostal church means
[1:02:20] and as I mentioned last time there were
[1:02:25] two things that came up one was the
[1:02:27] Pentecostal Assemblies of Newfoundland
[1:02:30] and second was the church where I came
[1:02:32] to and on the Pentecostal Assemblies of
[1:02:35] Newfoundland I mentioned that there were
[1:02:36] five nearly 500 Pentecostal churches in
[1:02:39] Newfoundland so like 100-person I was
[1:02:42] excited like I was like this is the
[1:02:45] place where I'm meant to be and this is
[1:02:48] it like this is my moment like I'm gonna
[1:02:51] grow like this is what I was thirsting
[1:02:53] for and if I look at the timeline like I
[1:02:55] was eight months I think yeah eight
[1:02:58] months into as a new believer and like
[1:03:01] trying like as a new believer you're
[1:03:03] really excited to grow and it's a
[1:03:05] different level of I guess and passion
[1:03:09] at that time but there was not really
[1:03:11] any maturity that had happened in me it
[1:03:14] was it was a growth phase but there was
[1:03:16] no maturity and that's when I came to
[1:03:20] Newfoundland and to God's grace like I
[1:03:24] think I landed here on Saturday and the
[1:03:27] very next day I went to the church that
[1:03:29] I saw on the link and this was my
[1:03:33] initial experience like initially like
[1:03:36] the first couple of weeks I was really
[1:03:38] good like really I'm enjoying it I like
[1:03:41] the worship and everything is going
[1:03:42] really really good but this is the
[1:03:46] testimony of like I would say what
[1:03:50] happens to a church when it tries to
[1:03:52] identify with the world that's what this
[1:03:54] testimony will be about and I just
[1:03:57] wanted to go back like to my last
[1:03:59] Sunday's testimony which
[1:04:02] this is an apology i io which is like I
[1:04:04] was not intending to like go into
[1:04:06] teaching but I just somehow went here
[1:04:11] and there but for me the biggest miracle
[1:04:15] for me it has been like coming out of
[1:04:17] the spiritual darkness and it's just the
[1:04:20] different stages of darkness that God
[1:04:22] brought me out from and that's what
[1:04:24] exactly what I wanted to bring out
[1:04:26] through my testimony which is what was
[1:04:28] that spiritual darkness and in India
[1:04:31] I've experienced the spiritual darkness
[1:04:33] in terms of religion or in terms of
[1:04:36] atheism or being an agnostic but when I
[1:04:39] came to Newfoundland here that's when I
[1:04:41] started facing like a different kind of
[1:04:44] Darkness and this is exactly like I was
[1:04:46] trying to I was really praying to God
[1:04:48] like how can I convey what what did I
[1:04:50] come through and it's like I don't I I
[1:04:52] cannot take back to people like into
[1:04:55] those days and show them what I was
[1:04:57] going through that's when he actually
[1:04:58] brought the example of the water and
[1:05:00] it's it so nicely gets into it is like
[1:05:04] this is exactly how it was like I didn't
[1:05:11] add anything today I just brought it as
[1:05:13] it is but on that day like there was
[1:05:18] like one cough was just a boiled water
[1:05:20] like I had boiled it to like an extreme
[1:05:23] extent like where I had taken out
[1:05:25] everything from it and for me that was a
[1:05:28] representation of like my time Adam at a
[1:05:32] Methodist Church and also like what I
[1:05:35] was experiencing some things in my own
[1:05:37] life when I became regimented about
[1:05:39] things when other glass had like a sugar
[1:05:43] water in it and that was like just again
[1:05:47] a delusion from an emotional gospel and
[1:05:49] the third glass had like a salted water
[1:05:52] and it all looked same but that's
[1:05:54] exactly the deceit that I came out of
[1:05:56] and now that's what I'm gonna lead who
[1:05:59] is like what that deceit looks like and
[1:06:01] then I'm just gonna bring it back
[1:06:03] why again I use the example of water in
[1:06:06] it yeah so like when I came here like I
[1:06:11] came to a Pentecostal church and that
[1:06:13] church had been he
[1:06:14] for like now almost I believe like 40 or
[1:06:17] 50 years it has been here and it had
[1:06:21] like a very great like like a social
[1:06:24] standing very great name and it could
[1:06:27] theoretically you cannot find anything
[1:06:29] wrong about it like you try to look into
[1:06:32] the doctrines that they have listed on
[1:06:33] their website or everything that they
[1:06:36] stand for there is nothing wrong into it
[1:06:37] it will all go and meet the Bible but
[1:06:40] it's exactly where the deceit is going
[1:06:42] to be before I go into like some of the
[1:06:46] symptoms that I like came through at the
[1:06:48] church like I first go into how much I
[1:06:52] started getting involved with the church
[1:06:54] so this is something that I knew when I
[1:06:57] was in India that as a Christians we are
[1:07:00] meant to serve but at the same time I
[1:07:03] didn't have God's leadership on like
[1:07:05] what it means to serve I had my own
[1:07:08] understanding what I need to do as I
[1:07:09] serve and I was reading I was trying to
[1:07:12] read a lot trying to understand about
[1:07:13] different types like you know just
[1:07:15] different aspects of Christianity and I
[1:07:18] just wanted to serve that that's I
[1:07:19] really in my heart but at the same time
[1:07:22] when God's will is taken out of serving
[1:07:25] it really creates a big chaos and you
[1:07:28] will never find peace like that
[1:07:30] something no matter how much I served I
[1:07:33] could never find peace and it all
[1:07:35] actually the worst part was like when I
[1:07:38] stopped doing it that's when I found
[1:07:39] peace and there was like it was it is
[1:07:44] the truth and like one thing okay I'll
[1:07:48] just when it came to serving so like
[1:07:50] when I came to church I was like I
[1:07:52] believe it was the first or second week
[1:07:54] I set up a meeting with the pastor I'm
[1:07:56] like what can I do
[1:07:57] how many areas can I get into and they
[1:08:00] said okay this is all that is going I'm
[1:08:02] like okay I'm going in each and every
[1:08:03] one of them and it's like only those
[1:08:06] things which I cannot meet according to
[1:08:08] my schedule those are the only ones that
[1:08:10] I will skip and sad part was like I
[1:08:13] didn't hear back for a while so I was
[1:08:15] like okay what's going on so I went
[1:08:20] again and I started following up like
[1:08:22] okay when can I start when can I start
[1:08:24] and the first thing that I started was
[1:08:27] with
[1:08:28] a small group Bible study that we were
[1:08:31] having like a youth group that was
[1:08:34] happening here evict and there was later
[1:08:37] on I started going to like this that's
[1:08:40] so very good actually what they're doing
[1:08:42] it happens at the Eastern held once in a
[1:08:45] month and they go and pray for the
[1:08:48] elders and they have like hold a service
[1:08:50] there third thing I got into was like
[1:08:53] what we called as the conversation cafe
[1:08:55] so in conversation cafe you have a lot
[1:08:58] of refugee immigrants coming here like
[1:09:00] from embalm Sudan Uganda it could be
[1:09:03] from a multiple different country so the
[1:09:05] whole point of conversation cafe was to
[1:09:08] help them with English and I mean I just
[1:09:12] more like helped them to get integrated
[1:09:14] into the society here the I started
[1:09:19] going to a second Bible study along with
[1:09:21] the first one and that was the most
[1:09:23] interesting one because they're the
[1:09:25] lowest average age of that group was
[1:09:28] seventy years like it was that and above
[1:09:31] and I was the lowest one after that and
[1:09:33] I actually knew like an elder couple in
[1:09:37] the church and they would have been
[1:09:38] really close to me and through them I
[1:09:40] came to that I was ready group but
[1:09:43] surprisingly by coming to that group it
[1:09:47] really opened to me the Pentecostal
[1:09:49] history of Newfoundland because they
[1:09:51] were the witnesses of that time over
[1:09:53] here and there were people who were in
[1:09:56] their 90's and they were still coming
[1:09:58] but the knew the full history of
[1:10:00] Newfoundland and the other part was like
[1:10:04] for me that was really striking the knew
[1:10:07] the history of the church I was going to
[1:10:09] because they were there with Thatcher
[1:10:11] since the foundation so they have seen
[1:10:14] that sure starting from a real
[1:10:16] Pentecostal revival and going into the
[1:10:19] complete like a charismatic worldly
[1:10:21] Church so that's why that group had been
[1:10:24] a real blessing to me then I was also
[1:10:30] doing like morning coffee like preparing
[1:10:33] for the service there were some more
[1:10:35] things that that are going on so my
[1:10:38] thought now this is my intellectual
[1:10:39] thought is like I'm gonna
[1:10:41] like I'm gonna really really grow into
[1:10:43] the world by doing everything that I was
[1:10:45] doing and so like this was the
[1:10:51] involvement with the church but at the
[1:10:53] same time I started like seeing
[1:10:57] different things at the church like I
[1:10:59] spent nearly I believe at least one and
[1:11:03] a half years at that church and that's
[1:11:06] when I like you know came back to the
[1:11:09] example of the glass less like just
[1:11:11] imagine if this sugar or like like a
[1:11:14] salted water what would happen if you
[1:11:16] drink like just one or two glasses of it
[1:11:19] you won't feel anything there's nothing
[1:11:21] that would go wrong in your body but now
[1:11:23] just imagine you're drinking it for a
[1:11:25] whole 1 and 1/2 year it will just create
[1:11:28] a full chaos in your system and also
[1:11:31] like you will feel like you're walking
[1:11:32] in a desert and you'll be thirsting for
[1:11:34] real water like where can I find real
[1:11:37] water and that's exactly what I was
[1:11:39] looking for is like where can I get any
[1:11:41] real water because I was feeling thirsty
[1:11:44] like it's a like in a literal sense I
[1:11:47] was feeling thirsty I could never feel
[1:11:49] satisfied I was just never at peace why
[1:11:53] was that like why was that sure even
[1:11:55] after trying to serve this much why I
[1:11:57] could not feel like that so just
[1:12:00] starting with the leadership of the
[1:12:02] church first of all in the leadership of
[1:12:04] the church there was system there was
[1:12:06] organization but at the same time there
[1:12:09] was no scriptural order in it it was all
[1:12:12] man-made ideas of hierarchy of like
[1:12:16] communities and there is no godly
[1:12:19] leadership even within the leaders and
[1:12:21] the leaders were also not seeking the
[1:12:24] will of God it was more like what what
[1:12:26] is what it means the government
[1:12:28] criterias how it should be managed
[1:12:30] really like it was more like trying to
[1:12:32] run an organization then trying to lead
[1:12:35] a church and what happens is that is
[1:12:38] like when they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:12:40] leading in them and they try to run a
[1:12:42] church with their own ideas the first
[1:12:45] thing they will do is like squeeze out
[1:12:47] the spirit out of the church by itself
[1:12:49] and that's not how the church began when
[1:12:53] the when I can
[1:12:54] I started I started investigating is
[1:12:57] like has discharged in like forever when
[1:13:00] I went back and I just asked like the
[1:13:02] initial leadership of the church like
[1:13:04] when they were really filled with the
[1:13:05] Holy Ghost the choice was in a revival
[1:13:08] they actually brought a revival within
[1:13:10] Newfoundland to in Bell Island at
[1:13:12] different places but at the same time
[1:13:15] when the leadership started changing
[1:13:16] over the years and with the current
[1:13:18] leadership
[1:13:19] first of all with with all like loving
[1:13:24] grace and all they have women preachers
[1:13:26] and like they have with the women
[1:13:28] preachers they are like perfectly as
[1:13:31] worldly preachers as I can imagine and I
[1:13:34] would even say like even in the women
[1:13:37] preachers but not only that but they
[1:13:39] were even leading their own homes so
[1:13:40] like there was not even that
[1:13:43] understanding of what we say is like man
[1:13:45] is the you know the woman and Christ is
[1:13:47] the head of the man so first of all
[1:13:49] that's here's here's a direct fall out
[1:13:51] of the scriptures and in terms of makeup
[1:13:55] like I mean I I'd never like I spoken
[1:13:58] against it or anything much about it but
[1:14:00] like when I look back now I can see like
[1:14:02] why I was feeling uncomfortable the way
[1:14:04] I was feeling uncomfortable it was like
[1:14:06] it was like a painting that means they
[1:14:09] were putting on before preaching is like
[1:14:11] whatever is going on like and like it's
[1:14:15] just there was even way more like with
[1:14:19] like even like the man like I haven't
[1:14:25] spoken much on like dressing sense and
[1:14:26] all but it it was as worldly as I can
[1:14:29] imagine like I mean it was just and
[1:14:31] they're preaching now so it's that's not
[1:14:35] what that's that's that you can like
[1:14:36] that was like okay indication to me that
[1:14:38] this is very worldly now going to do
[1:14:41] like the lead the head pastor like first
[1:14:44] of all he was not at all like integrated
[1:14:47] with the people no interest at all and
[1:14:49] that was a big shock to me like I was
[1:14:52] felt like as if like somebody gave like
[1:14:53] a punch on my heart because when I was
[1:14:56] in India like that was the biggest
[1:14:58] support that I had like the church was
[1:15:00] really big but at the same time like I
[1:15:03] would always like could have a
[1:15:05] conversation with my pastor he would
[1:15:07] have time like to Italy
[1:15:08] have a were denied I knew who he is he
[1:15:10] knew who I am and here I barely ever
[1:15:14] spoke to him like in one and a half
[1:15:16] years and he knew my name but that's all
[1:15:18] and he didn't care at all is like
[1:15:21] whether anybody is interested in having
[1:15:23] a conversation or not all the counseling
[1:15:27] was also not like a scriptural
[1:15:28] counseling it was a psychological
[1:15:30] counseling and that also doesn't do any
[1:15:33] good like it's and then you have like a
[1:15:36] communications pastor who is responsible
[1:15:39] for engaging people you have a youth
[1:15:41] pastor you have a young adult pastor you
[1:15:43] have a worship pastor you have teens
[1:15:46] pastor and then you have all the leaders
[1:15:49] under them it's like it could be as hard
[1:15:52] article as I can imagine and you cannot
[1:15:55] go to the second year without speaking
[1:15:57] with the lower tier like it was it was
[1:16:00] exactly like that if I go to like
[1:16:02] anybody like a higher ok did you speak
[1:16:04] with this person like reporting to that
[1:16:06] person and then I go and speak with that
[1:16:09] person and only if need be he'll direct
[1:16:11] me to that higher authority so it's like
[1:16:14] for me there was like was a big shock
[1:16:17] like I never saw that before in my life
[1:16:19] and in some way it was a reflection of a
[1:16:21] Hindu temple too because you know were
[1:16:24] in temples also we had this hierarchy's
[1:16:28] that's about leadership and there was
[1:16:33] another thing which really like scared
[1:16:35] me about the leadership which was a fear
[1:16:37] there was a tremendous amount of fear in
[1:16:40] the leadership they were afraid of like
[1:16:43] taking a stance for the word they were
[1:16:45] really afraid of displeasing the people
[1:16:47] and I got this comments often like when
[1:16:49] I used to go and like ask them you know
[1:16:51] like why don't you preach against this
[1:16:52] or why don't you preach about that or
[1:16:54] like so this is what I was getting the
[1:16:56] feedback is like the preaching has to be
[1:16:59] according to your group of people here
[1:17:01] and it was like like again now it sounds
[1:17:05] like ok is it related discernment or is
[1:17:08] it like no it was more what they were
[1:17:10] trying to like it needs to be pleasant
[1:17:12] for the audience and it needs to be
[1:17:13] exciting and like it would be diluted up
[1:17:17] to such an extent like just what I said
[1:17:19] about the boiled water
[1:17:21] there is no nutrition left in it and all
[1:17:24] you would try to keep preaching about is
[1:17:26] like Jesus died on the cross and we got
[1:17:28] saved and it's like let's say Easter is
[1:17:30] coming then there will be a full
[1:17:32] planning there will be actual schedule
[1:17:33] of like for the next like 20 or 30 weeks
[1:17:37] like this is exactly how we are going to
[1:17:39] preach about and leading up to the
[1:17:41] Easter and how God got Rosetta it would
[1:17:44] be like diluted diluted diluted like
[1:17:47] even more diluted and as soon as Easter
[1:17:50] is over there will be a gap and then
[1:17:52] preaching for the Christmas and it's the
[1:17:54] same cycle it would keep going on again
[1:17:56] and again and I remember like this
[1:17:59] really struck me when I came actually
[1:18:00] first day here I'll never forget that
[1:18:03] image out of my head when brother Andre
[1:18:05] was here and that was my first day when
[1:18:07] I came and it was his last day of
[1:18:09] preaching here he said this you know
[1:18:11] that people keep revolving around faith
[1:18:13] grace faith grace faith grace hope they
[1:18:15] will keep going around that like and
[1:18:18] that that really struck me at that
[1:18:19] moment because that day was still going
[1:18:22] to that church and I came here and he's
[1:18:25] saying the exact same thing that I've
[1:18:27] been trying to like convince people on
[1:18:29] that it's really wrong to keep revolving
[1:18:32] around this topics again and again again
[1:18:34] and again and even they were not going
[1:18:36] in the depths of it it was like just on
[1:18:39] a such a surface level that there was no
[1:18:41] real word moving like now moving like
[1:18:51] out from the leadership like now how the
[1:18:53] congregation was like now in the
[1:18:55] congregation like there was no
[1:18:57] understanding of Bible at all and you
[1:19:01] know like we often hear this phrase like
[1:19:03] that there are three types of believers
[1:19:05] that believers make believers and
[1:19:07] non-believers and I would say like maybe
[1:19:10] like more than half of the church was
[1:19:12] filled with the make believers because I
[1:19:14] knew them outside the church too and I
[1:19:17] had spent enough time that I could see
[1:19:20] that okay this is a make belief system
[1:19:23] they were non-believers and personally
[1:19:25] no it's a very personal belief like I
[1:19:27] can deal with a non-believer but not a
[1:19:29] make believer because they don't stand
[1:19:31] for anything and it's
[1:19:35] it's a really a dry place like when it
[1:19:37] becomes like a make belief system and
[1:19:40] give some examples of like how big the
[1:19:42] make belief system was there so now you
[1:19:44] have all these ministries but now just
[1:19:47] cash they start now the purpose of any
[1:19:49] ministry is to glorify Jesus Christ and
[1:19:52] that was the exact thing that was
[1:19:54] missing from all the ministries so like
[1:19:56] when you go to like the conversation
[1:19:58] cafe
[1:19:58] it is about English I understand but at
[1:20:01] the same time don't know do it in the
[1:20:03] name of the church just just don't put
[1:20:06] it under than any under the name of
[1:20:07] Christ that you're doing it for the
[1:20:09] glory of Christ and secondly if you're
[1:20:11] doing it still there needs to be an
[1:20:13] element of Jesus in it like you can
[1:20:15] still work it out and I understand
[1:20:19] cannot do it with the King James Version
[1:20:20] but there are still different ways to do
[1:20:23] it like you have scriptural doc books
[1:20:25] like be written about the Bible at least
[1:20:27] you can use them to read out to the kids
[1:20:30] like if you want to teach them English
[1:20:32] but you need to have an element of Jesus
[1:20:34] in it taking about the Bible studies and
[1:20:37] all I never remember like my our Bible
[1:20:40] study going beyond like like Jesus
[1:20:43] Christ coming and dying for us that's
[1:20:46] where our Bible studies always stayed at
[1:20:48] and it would start like okay what is the
[1:20:51] importance of prayer what is the
[1:20:53] importance of evangelization what is the
[1:20:55] importance of reading the word and then
[1:20:57] the fifth last closing would be like
[1:21:00] okay so Jesus Christ pain he saved us
[1:21:03] again the same series we are going again
[1:21:05] and again and all these Bible studies
[1:21:07] were also now just a minute such a you
[1:21:09] church like maybe it is 15 or 20 groups
[1:21:13] are doing it and it's all being
[1:21:15] centrally governed by them by the lead
[1:21:18] leading management in the church this is
[1:21:21] exactly what the Bible study will be or
[1:21:23] this is exactly the questions that will
[1:21:25] be discussed music how can the Holy
[1:21:27] Ghost have a move it's never like a one
[1:21:29] fit for all system with when it comes to
[1:21:32] Jesus and it's exactly what they were
[1:21:35] doing with all the Bible studies is like
[1:21:37] just the same circle and that will keep
[1:21:40] going on like you have this series going
[1:21:42] in like September then you will have it
[1:21:44] again in January you will have it again
[1:21:46] in September so say there is no
[1:21:48] moving us forward like this nothing
[1:21:51] there now like now this is the church
[1:21:54] trying to identify with the world and
[1:21:56] they are they like you know it became so
[1:21:59] deceitful like exactly like this waters
[1:22:02] nice like is it a community center is it
[1:22:04] a not-for-profit organization or is it a
[1:22:07] church I don't know it I sort i started
[1:22:10] accepting later on like midway which is
[1:22:12] like it's a not-for-profit organization
[1:22:15] and we come to talk about jesus between
[1:22:17] 9:00 to 11:00 on a Sunday that's what
[1:22:19] exactly became it became for me it's
[1:22:21] like that's what it is
[1:22:24] all right III just God's move like I
[1:22:29] actually told two people that this is
[1:22:32] what exactly this church has become now
[1:22:34] and I did feel like a crazy person for a
[1:22:37] while because I was going to people like
[1:22:40] and like I'm telling them that I still
[1:22:42] remember like there was one I worked for
[1:22:45] the full night at the Irving gas station
[1:22:47] the next day morning I went to the
[1:22:49] church from church like a family invited
[1:22:52] me for lunch and I was definitely out of
[1:22:54] my mind like I was working for the full
[1:22:56] night and it's like I went to church and
[1:22:58] I'm going to a lunch and I strongly I'm
[1:23:02] like for half-hour I was like going on
[1:23:04] and on but like how this church is
[1:23:06] diluted it's like and everybody was
[1:23:08] agreeing with me but nobody was ready to
[1:23:10] do anything about it I was like and that
[1:23:16] became pretty much my whole schedule
[1:23:17] like every second or third Bible say I
[1:23:20] would be going on like how crazy it is
[1:23:22] how the Spirit has left there's no talk
[1:23:24] about the Holy Ghost
[1:23:25] there was no talk about Revelation I
[1:23:27] don't ever remember talking about the
[1:23:30] importance of Revelation this was
[1:23:32] another thing to God's grace and that's
[1:23:33] where I started looking back to
[1:23:35] predestination when I came here I always
[1:23:38] ask them when are we going to talk about
[1:23:39] the future of the rapture or like the
[1:23:42] like the Book of Revelations are we
[1:23:43] going to open it or not like we are
[1:23:45] always going back to just specific books
[1:23:47] but we never went to the Book of
[1:23:49] Revelations so it's like you're taking
[1:23:52] only half of the Bible and this is the
[1:23:54] biggest struggle because again it's not
[1:23:56] scripturally wrong it's all like
[1:23:58] theoretically it all meets the Bible but
[1:24:01] at the same time
[1:24:02] there is no Holocaust how it impacted
[1:24:06] the people like now the youth they had
[1:24:09] no understanding of Jesus at all like
[1:24:12] young adults like I would see like this
[1:24:15] was a shot like again I I know it
[1:24:17] shouldn't be a shock but when I came
[1:24:19] here and I saw like okay there is a
[1:24:21] godly like like a choir there is a godly
[1:24:24] like worshiping service happening here
[1:24:27] there is a huge like a breeder for me
[1:24:30] because there I could see like people
[1:24:32] leading on the stage and I had seen them
[1:24:34] outside the church and they could be
[1:24:37] again like as worldly as I can imagine
[1:24:38] and there they are leading the song
[1:24:42] service I'm like I'm seeing them outside
[1:24:45] the church in university they're going
[1:24:48] on a Sunday to a church that happens in
[1:24:50] a pub on Sunday nights I'm like they go
[1:24:53] there on Sundays in the evening and then
[1:24:55] they're worshiping and Sunday morning
[1:24:57] here they are leading it's like what
[1:25:00] double standards there are like so it
[1:25:04] went up to that bad extent that I later
[1:25:06] I started finding that people are in
[1:25:08] live in relationships in the church
[1:25:10] there were like like there was like
[1:25:15] someone who had child before like
[1:25:17] marriage at a very young age and there
[1:25:20] were people like you can see all these
[1:25:21] things happening inside the church
[1:25:23] because now it's again the mistake of
[1:25:25] church because they try to identify with
[1:25:27] the world so the world now entered into
[1:25:29] the church there was like even like when
[1:25:34] I went to the scriptural order like when
[1:25:36] I used to talk them what assure and all
[1:25:38] like they made it into full volunteer
[1:25:40] positions anybody can come and anybody
[1:25:43] can become a deacon anybody can become
[1:25:45] because it's all volunteer positions and
[1:25:47] you get certificates for doing all that
[1:25:53] and come when it come like coming to the
[1:25:55] service like the service became was like
[1:25:57] really like a nine to eleven service
[1:26:00] like it would be so regimented services
[1:26:02] like I could actually see on my cloth
[1:26:03] like I it went so bad like I started
[1:26:06] skipping the worshiping services like I
[1:26:08] wouldn't even go the in there
[1:26:09] I'll be outside just doing my stuff and
[1:26:12] like because like the first struggle
[1:26:14] that I started having with the worship
[1:26:16] service
[1:26:16] like it'll be a lot of like audio driven
[1:26:19] like it would be a lot of emphasis on
[1:26:21] like the technology and like adding
[1:26:23] artificial sounds to it and like how all
[1:26:26] the you know like instruments are
[1:26:28] happening you can't at times it would be
[1:26:30] even so loud that you cannot even hear
[1:26:33] what what is being sung so it's like I
[1:26:35] could easily feel that they are trying
[1:26:36] to attack my emotions but it's not
[1:26:38] anything moving in my spirit I I don't
[1:26:41] even like in India it would be a very
[1:26:44] spirit full worship service because it
[1:26:46] was never about the instruments or
[1:26:47] anything just sing and Derick I remember
[1:26:51] like crying in a worship service in a
[1:26:53] Methodist Church while in the worship
[1:26:56] service I could feel the presence of
[1:26:57] Holy Ghost like really high and here I'm
[1:27:00] in a Pentecostal church and I barely
[1:27:02] feel anything in the worship service so
[1:27:04] like there was again a chaos like it was
[1:27:06] driving me crazy so I just stopped going
[1:27:08] in there and when it comes came to the
[1:27:13] service like dude instead of like trying
[1:27:15] to be on the scriptures they would try
[1:27:17] to give all the worldly examples try to
[1:27:20] bring like jokes to it like - like
[1:27:23] explain the Scriptures I'm like have you
[1:27:25] mad like you don't play with the
[1:27:27] scriptures like you just understand the
[1:27:29] seriousness of it anyway like so like so
[1:27:35] understand under like congregation like
[1:27:37] no I I was quite involved with the
[1:27:40] church but the paradox is I didn't know
[1:27:42] anyone at the church I knew them at
[1:27:45] their face as I knew them by their names
[1:27:47] but except two people I had never had
[1:27:50] any fellowship with anyone at the church
[1:27:52] and there were people who I'd be meeting
[1:27:55] like almost every week but we barely
[1:27:58] knew each other this another shocking
[1:28:00] moment happens like the Bible study that
[1:28:02] I was going into there was a person who
[1:28:05] had been going to that Bible study for
[1:28:07] like a number of years and after I
[1:28:09] started having conversation and I
[1:28:11] started getting people to even talk with
[1:28:13] each other people started getting shots
[1:28:16] about each other oh this was in your
[1:28:17] life oh this was in your life you've
[1:28:19] been here for like a couple of years
[1:28:21] together it's like and you don't know
[1:28:23] each other you don't know even like that
[1:28:25] what's happening in each other's
[1:28:27] families like I'm not saying into the
[1:28:28] personal stuff but
[1:28:30] at least on a broad level like if
[1:28:32] anybody's family is facing difficulty
[1:28:34] like one person's father he he will he
[1:28:37] had been to prison for a different
[1:28:38] reason and nobody even knew about it
[1:28:41] it's like you don't even pray for each
[1:28:43] other you have no ideas why are you even
[1:28:45] having this Bible studies once I ran
[1:28:48] into a worse conflict in that Bible
[1:28:50] story which was like somebody actually
[1:28:52] posted a group like a discussion about
[1:28:54] like inclusion and diversity and all
[1:28:58] like this which ours grew and the
[1:29:00] biggest shocker for music that person
[1:29:02] new to scriptures like back of the hand
[1:29:04] like person could find scriptures of you
[1:29:07] name and she could find that and here
[1:29:09] she's inviting people to that roundtable
[1:29:11] discussion I just immediately went into
[1:29:14] the link because I was leading the group
[1:29:16] so it was my responsibility to make sure
[1:29:18] that I protect it by any means and I
[1:29:21] just went into the link I saw on
[1:29:23] Facebook and the first thing I see in
[1:29:26] that picture was a pride flag I'm like
[1:29:28] what's the deal here so I just wrote
[1:29:30] wrote on the group like okay with
[1:29:33] genders are you actually talking about
[1:29:34] in terms of inclusivity and diversity I
[1:29:36] just put this question I didn't want to
[1:29:38] blame so I just put the question on I
[1:29:40] get I got back the how does that matter
[1:29:43] I'm like it perfectly matters to me this
[1:29:45] is what I saw and this is what I don't
[1:29:47] want people to get into it's not gonna
[1:29:49] happen and the verse was like some
[1:29:53] people had orderly agreed to like
[1:29:56] participate in that and even recently I
[1:29:59] found like one of the person again who
[1:30:01] was related to our group I she was in
[1:30:04] she's in Ontario or somewhere Alberta
[1:30:07] and she actually went into the Pride
[1:30:09] Parade I was like how bad it can get
[1:30:12] like it's like there is no one's choice
[1:30:14] she's not taking a stand so that's what
[1:30:16] exactly this corruption was sitting
[1:30:18] inside the church there's another thing
[1:30:23] that really drove me crazy was I saw
[1:30:25] Halloween inside the church
[1:30:27] I had like pumpkins and they had
[1:30:29] decorations and they're this was their
[1:30:32] rationale when I started reaching out to
[1:30:33] people against it that it's better to
[1:30:36] have the people coming over here into
[1:30:38] the church than going out into the
[1:30:40] society that's why we try to have
[1:30:41] something in between like what is in
[1:30:44] between like that's what the exact make
[1:30:45] believer stuff is so I was like there
[1:30:50] was another discussion where's like I'm
[1:30:51] sitting here like there are eight to ten
[1:30:53] people and they're trying to debate with
[1:30:55] me that it's okay to have one or two
[1:30:58] glasses of alcohol it's okay to have
[1:31:00] beer is scriptural that little is fine
[1:31:02] and like I'm like and it went so bad
[1:31:06] that for a moment it went it makes me
[1:31:09] feel like okay maybe I'm not getting the
[1:31:11] scriptures correctly maybe it's me who
[1:31:14] is not trying to who is being too
[1:31:16] regimented about the Bible like I mean
[1:31:18] everybody saying that there they are
[1:31:20] born into Christian families they are
[1:31:22] reading Bible for years maybe it's me so
[1:31:25] like I started dance like ice I stop
[1:31:28] like okay it's trying to like fight
[1:31:30] against it or like maybe I need to go
[1:31:32] back into Bible and I I didn't identify
[1:31:34] with it where like maybe I'll go back
[1:31:35] and see what the truth is for me and the
[1:31:39] truth was still the same that it's all
[1:31:41] wrong but the same time I stopped
[1:31:43] fighting against it like because I was
[1:31:45] all exhausted by then there was nothing
[1:31:48] moving I just keep getting worse and
[1:31:49] worse and what when I reached out to the
[1:31:51] head pastor about the heroines I was
[1:31:53] like white I just wrote why the hell are
[1:31:55] celebrating Halloween inside church he
[1:31:57] didn't reply back to me I'm like anyways
[1:32:07] like is this her like there is more
[1:32:10] stuff going on like I knew about the
[1:32:12] politics that's going on in the church
[1:32:13] there was financial corruption was just
[1:32:15] I don't have any proofs against it I
[1:32:17] just knew through some people and it's
[1:32:19] like I it was going on like I just buy
[1:32:22] this elder groups and all that I was
[1:32:24] participating in that's how I started
[1:32:27] coming to know is like what's going on
[1:32:28] in the background of the church they
[1:32:30] would like try to send evangelist and
[1:32:32] all just yeah like I mean to sum it all
[1:32:36] like this this is exactly what happens
[1:32:39] when a church tries to identify with the
[1:32:40] world and just to like you like you know
[1:32:46] if I have to break it down into like two
[1:32:47] parts like so if I go back to like the
[1:32:50] sugar water so that's where I look at it
[1:32:53] as like the prosperity gospel when it's
[1:32:55] being like the sugary emotion
[1:32:57] picture about Jesus there's no
[1:32:59] understanding of what a Christian
[1:33:01] persecution means what it means to take
[1:33:02] a stand and said exactly what the church
[1:33:05] was doing I was all like that that's
[1:33:09] what I would classify it like a diluted
[1:33:11] Pentecostal Church and when I look at
[1:33:16] from the salt water so here's the
[1:33:18] example that I would give like this is
[1:33:20] this this was again like a big blow to
[1:33:23] me like really big blow there was one
[1:33:25] day they organized in the church again
[1:33:27] that time I was really excited about
[1:33:29] serving so they are like okay we are
[1:33:31] gonna go to some different schools like
[1:33:33] the McDonald tri school there were some
[1:33:37] other schools and you know we are going
[1:33:39] to clean their pain there and yes the
[1:33:42] day will be about serving I was excited
[1:33:44] I was like you know at least there is
[1:33:47] some brightness in this darkness like
[1:33:49] something at least they are trying to do
[1:33:50] so soon I come to find out that they are
[1:33:53] going to do it only for one day okay I'm
[1:33:56] like okay at least one day then again I
[1:34:00] ran into an uncomfortable situation
[1:34:01] while I was there because they asked me
[1:34:04] to interview and I was not expecting
[1:34:07] that
[1:34:07] and I denied it at the beginning but
[1:34:09] they knew I was participating in
[1:34:10] different stuff so they're convinced I
[1:34:13] got convinced said okay I'm gonna
[1:34:14] interview again my thought was they're
[1:34:17] gonna just play it in the service for
[1:34:18] the people like you know just just what
[1:34:21] happened in the ministry but later on
[1:34:24] like from people like through some
[1:34:26] professional relations they started
[1:34:29] coming back to me that you are on TV
[1:34:31] this is going to the chair like go into
[1:34:33] this shirt my friend I'm like how do you
[1:34:35] know about it then it's like that there
[1:34:38] are advertisements on the television
[1:34:40] going on okay I'm like now I get it
[1:34:43] what was all that day was about they
[1:34:45] just wanted to create some video
[1:34:47] materials and then they were running
[1:34:49] advertisements like across the year like
[1:34:52] those advertisements were not stopping
[1:34:53] and there was a whole purpose of that
[1:34:55] serving which was to advertise and like
[1:35:00] and every service they would keep
[1:35:01] showing her and that never happened
[1:35:03] again that's serving that never happened
[1:35:05] again so it was very clear what was the
[1:35:08] objective which was like was to market
[1:35:11] the church and when they started doing
[1:35:13] that there were some another parallel
[1:35:15] stuffs ika started coming to know about
[1:35:16] they actually started keeping like
[1:35:18] analytics on the church what are the
[1:35:21] church growth numbers going on how far
[1:35:23] we want to grow how much we should
[1:35:24] expand the building to accommodate more
[1:35:26] people what is the growth you're on your
[1:35:28] growth we are looking at and they even
[1:35:31] started keeping analytics on the Bible
[1:35:33] studies like have an attendance how many
[1:35:35] people are attending and what is the
[1:35:37] mixer like and like really like that's
[1:35:41] not how the holy ghost works like it's
[1:35:43] it's not possible in it's like so that's
[1:35:48] what I started viewing is like a worldly
[1:35:50] like a charismatic Pentecostal Church
[1:35:52] where it's just all about the numbers
[1:35:54] it's a community center it's no more a
[1:35:57] church now and I I remember I think
[1:36:00] brother Gerald or somebody from the
[1:36:02] visiting ministry said that when it
[1:36:04] really struck me they say that in future
[1:36:07] someday it will go that bad that they
[1:36:09] will try so much to identify with the
[1:36:11] world that they will even stop writing
[1:36:13] it as a church but they might write it
[1:36:15] as a community center and it's already
[1:36:17] happening I think when coming to
[1:36:18] Paradise I saw like a spruce community
[1:36:21] center shirt so like and Bethesda is
[1:36:24] also like now trying to take out certain
[1:36:27] things and you know try to look more as
[1:36:29] a neutral Church so like just to like
[1:36:37] sum it up on this testimonial like by
[1:36:41] the time like I said initially here I
[1:36:43] started with a real passion real you
[1:36:46] know like expectation that I'm gonna
[1:36:49] grow into a Pentecostal church it's
[1:36:51] gonna be a revival for me instead I was
[1:36:54] served like the deceitful water and at
[1:36:56] the end of the one and half year I was
[1:36:58] almost on a nervous breakdown because of
[1:37:00] all this I mean I was continuing my
[1:37:02] education finish what I need to do and I
[1:37:05] shouldn't say this but like this accept
[1:37:08] it with grace we're like this is where I
[1:37:10] started coming to understanding like
[1:37:12] there's nothing that good that any good
[1:37:14] can come out of this place like this
[1:37:15] place is like just completely gone
[1:37:19] like I have to move out of the place
[1:37:20] otherwise like my Christian life will be
[1:37:23] lost like I would I would have
[1:37:25] nothing that I can identify with like
[1:37:27] that was the level I I came to the
[1:37:29] conclusion at the end is like finish my
[1:37:31] studies and find a church somewhere and
[1:37:33] even though I remember like up to that X
[1:37:35] when I was in or I was in a more that
[1:37:37] maybe if Lord brings me back to the
[1:37:40] church in India I'm willing to accept
[1:37:42] that because at least there was some
[1:37:44] Holy Ghost movement there it was not a
[1:37:47] Pentecostal Church but there was some
[1:37:49] spirit there it is there was no
[1:37:51] corruption like there was no worldliness
[1:37:53] like I want to be debating with people
[1:37:55] like okay whether there should be
[1:37:56] Halloween or not in a church yeah so
[1:38:03] like that's that's the whole picture of
[1:38:07] like whoa that's this is the exact seed
[1:38:10] that I really wanted to plant like so in
[1:38:12] the first part of the testimony I just
[1:38:14] wanted to show like what different
[1:38:16] religions and what all like can do to us
[1:38:19] and like how meaningless they are or how
[1:38:21] flat there and today's this part of the
[1:38:24] testimony I just wanted to share like
[1:38:26] what delusion or worldliness can do to a
[1:38:28] church I saw nothing new it's all
[1:38:31] brother branham has like said about you
[1:38:34] read it in the church age book he's
[1:38:35] trying to blast it and this is the
[1:38:38] reason like I've lived it why he's
[1:38:40] criticizing it so that's that coming to
[1:38:46] our church like as I came like I mean I
[1:38:51] have testified about that often and like
[1:38:53] I still say this is like when I came
[1:38:55] here like the first day when I listened
[1:38:58] I fellowship with the like a de jure
[1:39:00] with the church to after the service and
[1:39:01] that's what I felt is like this is what
[1:39:04] I say it like okay this church is trying
[1:39:06] to go towards a book of facts I'm
[1:39:08] getting that feeling is like I nobody
[1:39:10] had mentioned to me but this is where
[1:39:12] you know that that was like God's
[1:39:14] convictions like number one I was asking
[1:39:16] God like God is it the place where you
[1:39:19] want me to be and that's where I asked
[1:39:21] God is like give me an experience that
[1:39:23] gives me a confirmation that this is
[1:39:26] where you want me to be and I was still
[1:39:28] swinging back I was going there I was
[1:39:30] coming here going there coming here so
[1:39:32] like this was my first conviction is
[1:39:34] like okay I feel the Holy Ghost moving
[1:39:36] here people really want to like
[1:39:38] consecration there is a thirst for Jesus
[1:39:40] we're not perfect but there is a thirst
[1:39:43] for Jesus I'm like people are opening
[1:39:46] the book of Revelation like that's what
[1:39:48] I was looking was like anybody gonna
[1:39:50] look towards the future the rapture and
[1:39:52] he's like okay well that's that's the
[1:39:54] main topic to talk about so I said I say
[1:39:58] there was another confirmation from his
[1:40:00] like okay keep going just so like now
[1:40:07] like when I came to the messages like so
[1:40:17] then I came the biggest initially the
[1:40:21] days I was struggle I was having was
[1:40:23] like you know I had never heard about
[1:40:26] there being any prophet this is what I
[1:40:30] was conditioned to like when I left
[1:40:32] India as I came out of all the religions
[1:40:34] is like Hinduism is centered all around
[1:40:37] like gurus and Saints and also this I
[1:40:41] fixated like since my childhood I had
[1:40:43] hammered like I'm never gonna believe on
[1:40:45] people that's never gonna happen like
[1:40:47] I'm done with this stuff from India and
[1:40:49] this is big again I was not denying or
[1:40:53] criticizing what brother Branham is
[1:40:55] preaching but it was now like my own
[1:40:58] conflict with my own selves like I have
[1:40:59] to fight with what I know and what I
[1:41:02] stood for and what helped me to come out
[1:41:04] of Hinduism or will come out of all the
[1:41:07] things and now it's like okay here's the
[1:41:09] confusions like is the message around
[1:41:11] the Bible is there is a presence of
[1:41:14] Bible or am I trying to follow brother
[1:41:15] branham am i accepting him for exactly
[1:41:18] what he's saying or what was the
[1:41:20] scriptural basis of all that so that
[1:41:22] that's what exactly I started having the
[1:41:24] struggle another struggle for me that I
[1:41:27] started facing was like I'll be honest
[1:41:30] at the starting it will it was about the
[1:41:32] baptism because now I'm trying to fight
[1:41:35] a scripture with a scripture because my
[1:41:37] struggle was here Jesus is saying like I
[1:41:40] think in Matthews that you know be
[1:41:42] baptized in the name of the son the
[1:41:44] father and the Holy Ghost and I'm like
[1:41:46] there is a scripture in the book of Acts
[1:41:48] to where it's saying be baptized in the
[1:41:49] name of Lord Jesus Christ so I'm like
[1:41:51] here's once
[1:41:52] scripture here's another scripture so
[1:41:54] how do I choose between the scriptures
[1:41:56] and you from Bible is the Word of God
[1:42:01] how can I deny God's Word and that's
[1:42:04] where my real struggle began is like was
[1:42:07] okay all this needs more deeper
[1:42:10] exploration so but again this is one
[1:42:12] mistake I did and this is what I had to
[1:42:14] step out of which was like again I try
[1:42:17] to seek it intellectually started going
[1:42:19] into like different literature trying to
[1:42:21] find more evidence he's trying to escape
[1:42:23] again it started driving me I'm like
[1:42:25] okay I need to close this stuff Park it
[1:42:28] aside and just keep praying keep reading
[1:42:30] my Bible and keep praying and stick
[1:42:34] slowly and slowly lot started working
[1:42:36] miracles went and brother Jonah law said
[1:42:38] but when we were in Calgary like there
[1:42:41] was a miraculous trip for me like a lot
[1:42:43] of things happen on that trip like it
[1:42:46] was all like again very subtle miracles
[1:42:48] but they were big for me and when I came
[1:42:51] to like you know just just meeting with
[1:42:52] the believers and meeting I I could
[1:42:55] truly see in our church there is a
[1:42:57] passion for Bible there is a passion for
[1:42:59] Jesus and that's what our choice but you
[1:43:01] know my question was like is is the
[1:43:03] ministry as a whole focusing on that
[1:43:06] like is the message ministry as a whole
[1:43:08] going back to that and when I may met
[1:43:10] more people I met like more likely like
[1:43:13] pastors and all that was a confirmation
[1:43:16] for me that okay it's not just at our
[1:43:19] church but it says the ministry as a
[1:43:21] whole is is about the Bible and that's
[1:43:24] that that's that's you know there was
[1:43:26] enough for me then there was another
[1:43:31] like I when I got more awareness of like
[1:43:35] why am i rejecting like we're not
[1:43:37] rejecting but I'm having this struggle
[1:43:39] to even accept the message or read the
[1:43:41] message which was because I was still
[1:43:43] living in like the burns of the Indian
[1:43:47] environment and that's the exact reason
[1:43:49] why I wanted to emphasize on the
[1:43:51] environment like I did on the Sunday
[1:43:52] because that's what the burns but once I
[1:43:55] became aware of it that's when I started
[1:43:57] becoming more and more easing into the
[1:43:59] message and then scripture started
[1:44:02] opening so like the first scripture like
[1:44:03] that God really struck me with we
[1:44:06] about from the Old Testament it was not
[1:44:08] just one scripture many scriptures you
[1:44:12] can see often in Bible like God was like
[1:44:14] you know I named this place so-and-so
[1:44:16] because this place has been bad and I
[1:44:19] named this place so-and-so because this
[1:44:21] place has been fruitful then you can see
[1:44:24] like Bible and like in the Bible God
[1:44:26] giving different names for a certain
[1:44:28] purpose and that's it that was my moment
[1:44:30] that was my confirmation that that's why
[1:44:33] it's important to be baptized in the
[1:44:34] name of Lord Jesus Christ because it's
[1:44:37] not just a name it's it's way more it's
[1:44:40] what it represents it's what I'm
[1:44:41] standing for and is again like you know
[1:44:45] God has this like interesting ways to
[1:44:47] like not just scripture like it just
[1:44:49] like started making me like now not
[1:44:51] started building thoughts upon thoughts
[1:44:53] which were like you know you you see
[1:44:56] even like the human marriage but like
[1:44:58] like whenever I have witnessed a
[1:45:00] marriage like for me when I see like
[1:45:01] okay this person got married to this
[1:45:03] person I already know that this wife is
[1:45:06] standing for what the her husband
[1:45:08] represents and like even my friends like
[1:45:10] I have known them enough and I can
[1:45:13] totally see that maybe they might have
[1:45:15] some differences on certain preferences
[1:45:17] but at the same time they both have one
[1:45:20] vision they both stand for the same
[1:45:21] thing and if it's a teasin they both
[1:45:23] ugly towards that and if it's like
[1:45:25] earning career they both are moving in
[1:45:27] that same direction and that's exactly
[1:45:29] what started sending me or like if we
[1:45:31] are called out to be the bride of Jesus
[1:45:32] Christ then I have to wear the name and
[1:45:36] it's not just the name I'm wearing that
[1:45:39] day for me baptism like that that was
[1:45:41] really struck my heart was I now when we
[1:45:45] take on the name we are not just taking
[1:45:46] the name but we are taking the
[1:45:48] responsibility of the Jesus Christ
[1:45:50] that's what now we are putting on and
[1:45:53] that's what now whole our life will be
[1:45:55] over and by taking that responsibility
[1:45:57] we will be truly identified as the bride
[1:46:00] of Jesus Christ and those were my
[1:46:04] convictions that led all to baptism at
[1:46:06] the end and how often our pastor has
[1:46:11] preached about it once whether mark in
[1:46:13] the message he talked about it and the
[1:46:16] final like the final like a
[1:46:18] would say like the finishing was when
[1:46:21] like brother Jonathan came and he talked
[1:46:23] about the check and he's like you know
[1:46:25] and that that's when it all just sum it
[1:46:27] up and there was no more doubt like
[1:46:29] there was no more confusion like there
[1:46:31] was no more scope it's like it's enough
[1:46:33] for me to now move and it's it's
[1:46:36] scripture verses scripture but at the
[1:46:37] same time or brother Branham said about
[1:46:39] the niceiy and convention what happened
[1:46:42] in that how they had changed the
[1:46:43] scriptures at all it all started coming
[1:46:45] together okay
[1:46:46] this all has happened and this is the
[1:46:50] important and again like this was
[1:46:52] another thing that really struck me
[1:46:54] about baptism is like you need two more
[1:46:57] I think sister Maureen had said that is
[1:46:59] like you need two more scriptures to as
[1:47:01] two witnesses for another third
[1:47:04] scripture to stand and I could not find
[1:47:06] two more scriptures that would prove the
[1:47:09] baptism in the name of titles but when
[1:47:12] you go to like the baptism in the name
[1:47:14] of Jesus Christ you'll find at least
[1:47:16] four twenty scriptures that stand
[1:47:17] witness for it
[1:47:18] so like that that's it like there are
[1:47:21] scriptures that are vindicating that
[1:47:23] Scripture so that that's it like there
[1:47:26] was my moment like to go for the baptism
[1:47:32] and what with our shores like I mean I
[1:47:37] say I'm closing so but like to sum it up
[1:47:45] like they're like this this is just one
[1:47:47] moment in the church like there was a
[1:47:50] testimony that I gives some time event
[1:47:52] that time I shared about like how I met
[1:47:54] brother Joe and how miracles were
[1:47:56] happening in my life and how we came and
[1:47:59] how Lord was testing both of us and all
[1:48:02] that and like not like if I bring all
[1:48:04] these parallel stories together then for
[1:48:06] me it was like this is now how God's
[1:48:10] grace and God's like miracle works which
[1:48:12] is like I had no clue how I'm going I'm
[1:48:15] walking in a desert I want to break down
[1:48:17] I have no answers I have no
[1:48:21] understanding of leadership of God I'm
[1:48:23] struggling to understand how to live by
[1:48:25] the will of man here God picks me out
[1:48:27] from all this mess and I had no role to
[1:48:32] play in it
[1:48:32] I already testified it was a miracle a
[1:48:34] missed call from their guard like picks
[1:48:37] me up and brings me to the message and
[1:48:40] it's like for me like that moment like
[1:48:43] my struggles with the worship were over
[1:48:46] even those days I was struggling like
[1:48:48] okay can I find even any good spirit for
[1:48:51] songs like on online to listen to that I
[1:48:54] couldn't even find those there were like
[1:48:56] any songs that I was listening like
[1:48:58] before they were never satisfying to me
[1:49:01] I just felt so incomplete and I was like
[1:49:04] now I have so many songs that I cannot
[1:49:07] cover enough so there was that secondly
[1:49:11] it was about reaching stories like I
[1:49:13] used to go online and try to look for
[1:49:14] preachings but never anything could
[1:49:16] satisfy me now I'm just not able to
[1:49:19] catch up like just so much and even one
[1:49:24] preaching like I would have to go back
[1:49:26] and listen to or three times to get full
[1:49:27] of it and before us I didn't make a
[1:49:30] difference before when I was at the
[1:49:32] other shows like if I list don't listen
[1:49:33] it still vote and create any difference
[1:49:35] so now I'm actually sometimes I have to
[1:49:37] go back and listen like three times okay
[1:49:39] to get the full gist of it so my whole
[1:49:44] spiritual life like now was coming
[1:49:46] together like the worst shape the church
[1:49:48] even like the fellowship too and this is
[1:49:51] something that I testify like this is my
[1:49:54] testimony of being at the church I have
[1:49:57] seen enough black to see the white here
[1:50:00] and it's the way I was like not you know
[1:50:04] you know in like - like a build up like
[1:50:07] ego or anything but like today I want to
[1:50:10] say that like the way our church is like
[1:50:12] together or like trying to build as one
[1:50:14] family one body and like the way we have
[1:50:16] fellowship we need to have more of it
[1:50:18] and it's like with time like we need to
[1:50:21] grow stronger that's the only way we'll
[1:50:24] be able to stand is as one body and I've
[1:50:28] seen it outside like when that body goes
[1:50:30] like each one in their own direction it
[1:50:32] rips apart and like that was another is
[1:50:36] like finally I found people who I can
[1:50:39] identify that like they I don't have to
[1:50:42] debate with them that okay we need to
[1:50:44] live up to the Bible every
[1:50:45] Lord of it no more like yep that's
[1:50:48] everybody agrees on that so that was
[1:50:54] like a honestly for me it was like a big
[1:50:56] breeder like it was really tiring now
[1:51:00] that uh solved like from work to like I
[1:51:06] mean III told to brother Joe like this
[1:51:07] is something that I had been praying
[1:51:09] like since I came to Christ because this
[1:51:12] is was a big loophole in my life because
[1:51:14] I mean of course like when I was working
[1:51:16] before coming to Christ I was in like
[1:51:19] and sales and marketing roles so I had
[1:51:22] my worldly ways to deal with stuff so I
[1:51:25] didn't know the Christian ways I didn't
[1:51:26] know what it means to even work by faith
[1:51:28] what it means to even like this is
[1:51:31] something that I really needed Joe's
[1:51:34] help in the beginning is like how to
[1:51:35] stop worrying about your competition how
[1:51:38] to accept it in like leave it in God's
[1:51:40] hand and just just keep moving just just
[1:51:43] leave it God will deal with everything
[1:51:44] around and just just keep living by
[1:51:47] faith and that's where like I it really
[1:51:51] like that it was big for me like to just
[1:51:54] live by faith like we won't work by
[1:51:55] faith this is another thing for me is
[1:51:58] like I used to be a really aggressive an
[1:52:00] impulsive person before I can say like I
[1:52:04] would get into like physical fights but
[1:52:06] I would have verbal spats like real bad
[1:52:09] ones and I remember like at my like job
[1:52:13] in India like if I don't feel like if
[1:52:16] anybody is like trying to back out from
[1:52:18] there is like I would fire off like
[1:52:19] anything I wouldn't care who was around
[1:52:22] like we had like things like not only me
[1:52:25] but how we were all dealing with each
[1:52:27] other we had actually named that meeting
[1:52:29] room as a war room that we had a label
[1:52:31] out there it's a war room and any time
[1:52:33] those conflicts are happening go into
[1:52:35] that room fight as much as you want and
[1:52:36] come out as I it was working so
[1:52:43] like this is how God's grace is like
[1:52:46] slowly and slowly he like you know the
[1:52:49] Holy Ghost started working and like it
[1:52:51] did a liposuction on me like it took out
[1:52:53] that aggression from me and it's like
[1:52:55] now I could start moving away from my
[1:52:58] emotional realm and like try to now
[1:53:01] actually be more conscious of my own
[1:53:03] emotions and the biggest thing that I
[1:53:06] was never recognizing like at there
[1:53:08] before is like when I was operating at
[1:53:11] my emotional level even if I'm right
[1:53:13] still I will have like hurtful words to
[1:53:15] other people and I was having and now I
[1:53:18] can see when I look back but not when I
[1:53:20] was doing that so like that was God's
[1:53:24] grace like no I'm telling like all this
[1:53:28] parallel struggles I'm having here that
[1:53:30] are going in my life and through this
[1:53:33] one moment and last the same on God is
[1:53:35] like like converging it all one place
[1:53:38] one solution and he's solving all these
[1:53:40] areas and it's like I had no role like
[1:53:44] again I'll keep saying it again I had no
[1:53:46] role in it like it was all true like
[1:53:50] miscommunication how it all started so
[1:53:52] it's like and it's like I don't know
[1:53:56] it's just yeah it is weird that is the
[1:53:59] miracle for me like that's much my
[1:54:01] miracle and it also like it really helps
[1:54:07] to have the faith that God is moving in
[1:54:08] my life and he has never left me even
[1:54:10] when like I was not a Christian he was
[1:54:13] still with me and I like I really feel
[1:54:20] led to even tank the church to is like
[1:54:22] to because I know that sometimes I can I
[1:54:25] can be like my intention wouldn't be
[1:54:27] there but I could be too aggressive with
[1:54:29] my questions or I could be a bit trying
[1:54:31] to like I could be maybe I'm trying to
[1:54:33] shake phaidor like trying to shake the
[1:54:35] pillars here I could be that sometimes
[1:54:37] too negotiating on stuff and that's when
[1:54:40] like I really like Church was patient
[1:54:42] with me and like trying to give my space
[1:54:44] trying to give me my time let God move
[1:54:47] in my heart and having that trust that
[1:54:50] okay I'll I'll come to the right place
[1:54:52] at the right time where God wants me to
[1:54:54] be after
[1:54:55] my convictions and even like that that
[1:54:59] was really like and I really needed that
[1:55:01] support and having that support was a
[1:55:04] big comfort for me and one of the reason
[1:55:08] that I want to mention is like like me
[1:55:11] it will be Lord's will but like our
[1:55:14] church will have a revival and like when
[1:55:16] new people come to our church I really
[1:55:19] like you know for us to keep holding the
[1:55:21] spirit and keep welcoming them and lord
[1:55:23] help us to be patient with them and this
[1:55:28] is my closing like final closing
[1:55:30] statement which is like I come I don't
[1:55:33] remember the scripture but I do remember
[1:55:35] listening this phrase is a there will
[1:55:38] like there are low here and a low there
[1:55:40] and there are people who are waiting to
[1:55:43] be saved like I was one of them God did
[1:55:46] make a move but like I will testify that
[1:55:50] it was brother Joe Boone who shared his
[1:55:53] testimony and sent me an invitation and
[1:55:55] email to come to the church why don't
[1:55:58] you come and see for you like if it's
[1:55:59] for you and we were recently talking
[1:56:02] that he has given that invitation or to
[1:56:04] testify to to hundreds of people but at
[1:56:08] least one came and just imagine how it
[1:56:11] worked for me is like from a nervous
[1:56:13] breakdown to a fulfillment and to a
[1:56:15] bigger revelation so there might not be
[1:56:18] a hundreds out there but there will be
[1:56:20] 10 so like if we are to be the bride of
[1:56:22] Jesus Christ we have to hold the
[1:56:25] responsibility of testing testifying
[1:56:27] witnessing and it's again not gonna be a
[1:56:30] hundreds or thousands but there will be
[1:56:32] tens out there so that's my prayer I
[1:56:37] request preserved
[1:56:51] he left the water for me to go on for
[1:56:54] another three hours
[1:56:56] so I thank the Lord brother for the
[1:56:59] testimony is a testimony of grace amen
[1:57:03] the grace of God and it's some
[1:57:05] revelation concerning grace that the
[1:57:07] Lord has been dealing with me for the
[1:57:08] last few days I said O Lord I said we
[1:57:10] need I said we need to understand that I
[1:57:12] said that the purpose of grace divine
[1:57:15] love projected grace a man what for well
[1:57:20] well well
[1:57:21] number one we know is to bring our
[1:57:23] brother the way that God brought him the
[1:57:25] way that God led him you know from him
[1:57:27] from India I am not knowing that from
[1:57:29] one religion to Christianity from yah
[1:57:32] into another phase of Christianity and
[1:57:34] then to the word to the message of the
[1:57:37] Allen Amen so that was the grace of God
[1:57:39] in your life brother
[1:57:40] that was God working in you a man by the
[1:57:43] grace of God not that you deserved it we
[1:57:47] didn't deserve it none of us deserved it
[1:57:49] don't don't get that don't get that idea
[1:57:51] oh well you know well I'm not so bad
[1:57:54] what do you mean you're not so bad we're
[1:57:55] all the same
[1:57:56] the divided the Bible says God has
[1:58:00] concluded us all under sin that he might
[1:58:03] have mercy upon us all so brother
[1:58:05] there's none righteous here no when it
[1:58:07] comes to ourselves and our flesh and our
[1:58:09] now natural being none not one of us you
[1:58:12] know it's it's a our righteousness is
[1:58:14] according to our faith Amen by the grace
[1:58:16] of God and again that's grace and it's
[1:58:19] there and again it's not it really it's
[1:58:21] not my righteousness is the
[1:58:23] righteousness of Jesus that he imputed
[1:58:25] to me a man again if you do this you do
[1:58:29] this you do that if your spirit is right
[1:58:30] you ready to is right gobble imputed
[1:58:32] righteousness to you we're gonna give
[1:58:34] him the glory give him the honor not
[1:58:36] praise this brother praise that sister
[1:58:38] oh they're good they're good I've heard
[1:58:40] that so often I was everything good good
[1:58:43] you know what now are you good good what
[1:58:46] I said there's none good but one so I
[1:58:49] saw I said well you're not that one you
[1:58:52] know I said it's the one that gives us
[1:58:54] this goodness that shares His goodness
[1:58:56] with us by the grace of God well brother
[1:58:59] I prayed
[1:59:00] you give us the true real revelation of
[1:59:03] grace old grace brings me through this
[1:59:06] grace brings me to that but then your
[1:59:08] grace is ordained for another purpose
[1:59:09] than another reason oh yeah oh it's by
[1:59:12] grace through faith I'm say yeah
[1:59:14] what does Grace do Oh grace gives me
[1:59:17] faith yeah well but again when you get
[1:59:20] into that faith you still need grace hey
[1:59:23] man you don't leave grace behind you
[1:59:25] still you definitely still need it and
[1:59:26] and God has proved that through our
[1:59:28] brothers testimony a man they get the
[1:59:31] grace gave of this revelation and he
[1:59:33] walked into it but he discovered the
[1:59:35] meaning more grace Oh Lord
[1:59:37] I need more grace more grace Lord and he
[1:59:39] went on a little further and all the
[1:59:41] challenge were the challenge was that
[1:59:44] was bringing forth the need for more
[1:59:46] grace and more grace and more grace amen
[1:59:48] so let's let's respect grace this honor
[1:59:51] grace must be thankful for grace and
[1:59:53] let's be let's be praying constantly
[1:59:55] more grace lord I need more grace amen
[1:59:59] well because brother and our brother
[2:00:02] mentioned concerning thirsty only he was
[2:00:06] thirsty for something but again there

[2:00:10] amen even and even in India even even
[2:00:13] the Indian religion God was with you you
[2:00:15] know even when you were maybe even just
[2:00:17] just realized you were sinner living
[2:00:19] like a sinner and that's so on it was
[2:00:21] still God God was there because God at a
[2:00:24] time appointed for you then he was gonna
