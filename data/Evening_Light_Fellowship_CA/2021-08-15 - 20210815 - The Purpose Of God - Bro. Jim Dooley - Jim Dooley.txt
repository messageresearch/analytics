i believe amen so she was in british columbia for a while but she's moved to st john's for another while i guess amen so god bless her as she fellowships with us amen to god be the glory amen amen so i glorified the lord to continue to to minister to each one of us amen through his word and we thank the lord for the ministries that we've administered over the last few services and our brother jim dooley of course again from british columbia well originally i guess anuffi amen so again they're going to be a lot i think a lot of new flanders in glory amen but again as uh to god be the glory as our certain politician did ask individuals he said when we get to heaven oh yeah he he apparently believed in heaven he's a politician for many many years provincially and federally and he did ask him he said when you get to heaven he said are you going to tell the new flanders from all the rest they didn't know the answer well he said it's a very simple answer he said they're the only ones that want to go home amen because wherever a new fee goes he wants to go home amen and brother being here in this world we want to go home amen not to newfoundland not to the island not to canada but to glory amen by the grace of almighty god so to god be the glory and it was there that a certain revival started from around the earth they come from it went and started in england and they to spray them around the world they came to newfoundland oh yeah they did many many many years ago so we thank the lord that god has predestinated us for that purpose amen and again yes when it comes to the message of the hour oh yes there's been that the newfoundland has highlighted you know this revival that revival this one that one and god started there but they came here amen and we thank the lord that he used us and he laid that burden on our brother mark here some years ago in 1995 to put a a site on online regarding the message because at the time i believe our brother did a research on the internet he did a search for william branham well there's no william branham he just came up with one branham and i think he was a he was a sports figure somewhere in the united states that was the only reference to branham's so he said they said brother gerald he said would you like to put the message online so we we checked it out and we put it online amen of course if that maybe could be 3 million hits right now for sure when it comes to the william branham home page amen and it's known around the world and by the grace of god that we have ministered to 62 countries amen and it's absolutely tremendous and and as i said well to go to god be the glory there was a time when our the lord laid it on brother mark's heart here to print to certain messages in uh in the language in swahili you know in this there were three different messages and he and he felt uh led of the lord to to print them in swahili and so we printed 10 000 each of those three messages there was 30 000 and we sent to africa and we just left it with the lord amen and then when i was in tucson some years ago and we were at a restaurant going to get our meals and this brother tapped me on the shoulder from behind me and i turned around it was a black brother on oh and he said oh brother he said you're from newfoundland i said yes i am amen and he said well he said brother i want to thank you for what you did i said what do we do oh he said you brother and he said printed three messages in swahili i said yes i said our brother mark in newfoundland i said he translated that and we printed ten thousand each one for three three thirty thousand and all praise the lord he said brother thank you is i wanna let you know the first message material in our language and he said it's still going and he told me that he's such a blessing he said that he said there's a number of the brethren he said they take the book and he said they're they they're writing it out he said in in in a scribbler and he and always said they're passing the book onto somebody else i said what well how many of us are writing out the message in english amen well brother well if we don't write it out let's leave it out by the grace of god amen i said so that's tremendous he said brother he said you brethren there in newfoundland he said you have started over 300 churches he said in africa and he said they're still growing i said what we did that i said well to god be the glory i said we'll just keep on doing what god wants us to do amen so it's it's a tremendous blessing amen that what the lord laid on our brother's heart and what and and and the and the home page and so on and again like i said it's been i guess almost three million hits on the home page yeah well thank god and we were uh i was highlighted and a number of emails there once where our brothers certain brother was highlighting that brother gerald losch had no right to use the name william branham on the william branham home page and saw without permission from jeffersonville so i contacted jerry savelle and brother the brothers there came back they said brother god bless you for what you've done and what you're doing he said keep up the good work and it didn't matter to them if we used the name of william branham it was for the glory of god amen so to god be the glory so god bless we may pray the lord continue to bless the william branham home page amen and of course we know it's it was highlighted among the top five percent of all websites we got that award oh yeah and then we got another award it says you deserve this one he said and i said what is it he said it's a study web award they said you've he said your own page is laid out in such a way he said everything is balanced he said pictures he said words he said large words small words large letter smaller everything is balanced he said and he said it's such a way that it's it's so easy to study if anybody's interested in this interested in that oh wonderful they said you deserve it so as well to god be the glory amen amen and and the page is still going amen and there's there are those that are still clicking in and clicking in and so on we leave it with the lord amen to god amen eternity will reveal what god has and god is accomplishing through it it's been a witness well been a witness to the world that's right the message online like that come on when you consider so many million viewers tick clicking in clicking in just to check it just to check it amen we've give by the grace of god we've been a witness to the world concerning what god has done in these last days amen the hour is finished amen so god i pray the lord continue to be with us continue to help us continue to lead us and continue to bless what we've set our answer to do but is not for our glory it's for the glory of god amen i'm sure that because brother mark and myself were not taking the glory for it we just give the glory to god and say oh just contact this one contact that will contact somebody else you don't have to contact us amen contact the lord amen so brother it's a witness to the world by the grace of god to god be the glory amen so the lord bless us and also want to welcome our oh i mentioned brother ellie yeah sister lily amen so and pray the grace of god to our brother jonathan curlette and uh he recommended our brother jim dooley yeah he felt that that he's been blessed by brother jim dooley's ministry amen in in the bay city he's only ministered a few times occasionally where he is in british columbia amen so we thank the lord for our brother's visit with us here again and to minister with us amen and i do remember when he was here before and i believe your family was here and they were sitting right there amen the seat is empty amen he should have invited his family down amen so anyway god bless them and we're looking forward to his ministry of the word amen and of course too judge a reminder that after our fellowship today that we will be journeying to brother bob and sister brendas for fellowship and uh four o'clock i believe oh we'll eat at four o'clock okay so if you got a spiritual appetite our brother jim dooley is going to meet it amen you've got a physical appetite we'll leave it to sister brendan brother bob amen so we'll we'll meet the spiritual appetite first feed on the word amen oh yeah we need to feed on don't just take it and look at it say well that's good that's good that's good and then lay it aside no no you got to feed on the word amen oh well how do you know i'm feeding on the word because you'll go out and live it oh yeah you reflect the word in your heart in your soul in your in your life in your thoughts in your words and your deeds amen so it's not you that lives it's the word living in you it's the message living in you amen what you do is all based on the revelation of the word how you do it based on the revelation of the word the leadership of god based on the revelation of what god has done and what god is doing praise the lord there's too many only caught up with what god has done but what is god doing amen into the present tense grace to us brother thank god that we're into the revelation of what he's doing so we're not going to get caught up in just what he's done and make a denomination out of it amen thank you lord what you did what you did what you did no god wants to control us so and and go out and reflect what he's doing in your life amen and no no and not and not just you as an individual but in in this assembly this gathering of believers amen and again thank the lord that it's only a few of us because straight is the gate narrows the way and few there be that find it amen as i said it's going to be difficult for large churches even around the message considering that the bible says it's only going to be very very very few go in the rapture in fact you know and then the problem of god said mind there might be a dozen dozen brother is there more than a dozen here are we going in the rapture just this church god help us brother to to be faithful god help us to be sincere and loving with all of our hearts amen let's stand we're going to turn to our brother jim dooley amen i told him to minister as long as he wants amen by the grace of god and i pray that as he he's healing to the lord to give out we're going to be hungry and thirsty for the word amen we got to be pulling on the word amen by the grace of god god bless our brother as he ministers to revelation the truth the prophet of god did say he said this is the god's judgment seat amen this is god's judgmency and he's going to be judging us through the word and he's going to give us the word that we need to judge us and maybe to bless us with this and on the other end to cast out unbelief to cast out certain spirits god help us to yield to the word amen only believe all things are possible as our brother jim comes amen only believe amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] praise the lord [Music] just only hallelujah amen jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here yes amen hallelujah he is to the end of the age praise the lord hallelujah because jesus is here amen jesus is here lord i believe lord i believe amen [Music] [Music] oh [Music] grace [Music] we have to sing this little chorus we'll walk in the light amen i think that's our song if there's any light in the world i believe today we're walking in it we are that light a light that shines in a dark space amen amen hallelujah we [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] jesus [Music] [Applause] amen god bless you this morning hallelujah there's a sister here from british columbia who's that oh right here i don't think i know you do or sister no may god bless you we're going to read a verse of scripture in ecclesiastics chapter 3 and verse 1 i believe brother brother gerald laid a foundation for my message here this morning you know do everything there is a season amount rain do everything there is a season that's right and at time to every purpose under the heavens that's right to everything there's a season and at time to every purpose under the heavens amen may the lord have his blessings and you may have your seat i want to read before we start there uh what brother gerald shared with us this morning with regards to the church here and and to what what has happened down over the years and how you've ministered to so many countries and so many people and in so many nations and you know i think that's uh that's a great accomplishment and we should thank god that we have that honor that he's placed on us steve placed them for the journal and sister betty and brother the coffee brothers here and other brothers that have you know praise the lord but they're back to the plow or to to do that and have that undying love of the word because that's what it is it's the undying love of the word to get the word out you know what i mean and uh this is i'll just read this from for to you from the message i know my redeemer liveth i know my redeemer lived and he says i was studying last evening during the storm and was thinking what would be appropriate words to say in the morning at this resurrection service and my thoughts fell upon this subject that our brother has just read of job the 19th chapter and the 23rd to the 27 verses i know my redeemer liveth said job and i chose that for the subject and as we come why are we coming is for this purpose only that we could find new hopes right we are on this earth here and we know we're living in darkness we just don't have to kind of imagine these things or kill ourselves as it was because we know that we're living in the shadows of death each time we hear an ambulance scream when we pass the cemetery when we see a hospital every gray here marks it on our memorials that we are doomed people to both young and old amen right and we come on such a morning to gather hopes some new hopes of what we are here for and what is the purpose and i think that is a wonderful time to think of the hopes that god has given us amen right now we want to draw this first into our mind that there is not one thing and this is important what brother branham is saying here there is not one thing that can destroy us destroy us until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled right and i know everybody has heard this before and time and time again but it's good for us to have that on the forefront on the tablets of our mind you know nothing can go wrong with you or i we can get sick we can have all these things going on but nothing is going to take us out of here until the purpose of god in our lives each individual life here brothers and sisters has been fulfilled and you can take that to the bank amen so uh there could be nothing we are made for a purpose this church was built for a purpose and we can say this church was built for a purpose maybe it wasn't brother gerald that built a church i don't know who built the church at the beginning but the church is here and it's producing souls to the kingdom of god amen the message of the hour the light of the hour jesus says if you walk in the light as i am in the light you have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin in god there's no darkness amen in god there's no sin in god there's only light amen you know and then we sang that little chorus at the end there we'll walk in the light that is the only light brothers and sisters in this age that there is to walk in that is the light of the age see it's not westerly age it's not pentecostal age it's not luther age it's not any other age right but we're at the top of the age amen right walk in the light as he is in the light right it behooves us amen he says this foundation was not dug and the cornerstone wasn't laid and the blood apart me and the blocks laid into the building and the roof ending in the interior was put here not just to see if it could be done it was put here for a purpose or for a purpose he says your home that you live in was not just accidentally put there or somebody just wasting some time your home was made for a purpose to serve a purpose to raise up your family amen to have that fellowship together to eat together to walk together to live together to pray together he says if you did drive this morning in your automobile that automobile was made was not made just to see if it could be made the materials was not wasted by man it was put here for a purpose and to serve a purpose which we all enjoyed that purpose this morning didn't we hey we didn't have to hook up our horse and buggy amen brothers didn't have to go out and feed the horse and tackle it up and and you hear the bells coming down the road amen but we have these nice automobiles praise god i thank the lord i thank the lord when i go to the gas pumps that i have a dollar in my pocket that i have that i can put some fuel in it and i can go from a to b amen that's what we thank god for these things all these things how he takes care of us he says the clothing that you wear was not just to see if somebody could fashion something it was for a purpose the food that you eat was not grown on the earth just to see it grow it was made to serve a purpose and god did that did not just make a tree to be a tree he made a tree for a purpose amen nice pulpit is made from a tree and god did not make you and i just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose amen amen amen hey we didn't know what the purpose of god was always in our lives we may have had had a desire to serve god and wait but we didn't have to wear with all to serve god because we didn't have a revelation of how we should serve god amen and what god requires of us therefore he says there is a purpose of us all being here you're not here to just be another human being see there's many many human beings on the earth the earth's been populated and overpopulated and and so on he says you are here because that god made you for some purpose you're not here just to eat the food that god growed you're not here just to live in the house that god made or that man made pardon me or to wear the clothing that someone fashioned you are here for a specific purpose and little ones big ones unimportant ones and important ones he says no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are or how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose the bible says that which every joint supply amen right amen sisters slaving the kitchen day after day week after week month after month washing clothes ironing clothes doing this doing that all those things right fulfilling the purpose of god that purpose is just as important as any other purpose in god's economy amen and just as necessary amen hallelujah amen brother branham says motherhood can be considered to be the fifth gospel hallelujah amen we don't have mothers these days you know the world has sort of gone a little wonky on that day okay i'll just be finished here in a second then i can quit eh and uh okay where was i how big you are he says just as my finger is here for a purpose then there is nothing can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us until that purpose that god has put us here for amen has been made manifest that's right amen no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache or sorrows that we go through all of these are reasons and there's a reason for it amen he says we we we we will take for instance noah in his bible in the bible there was a flood that came by and all the earth was destroyed the vegetation everything was destroyed but noah and the seed that he had take was taken into new york god's purpose can never be defeated right god's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing can defeated can somebody say amen and so how happy ought we be we to be today wrestling on that beautiful revelation of the word of the living god amen amen that there is nothing neither thing's present and he's reading from the book of romans here nor things that can come there's no sickness there's no sorrow no death no plurals no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the living god amen the purpose of the living god i just heard brother girl speaking about the sister from new brunswick and she lives in new brunswick she's coming to school here but there's a purpose for that amen what is the purpose for that that purpose that's our sister has that purpose in her life she feels a purpose to be here to go to school what's god's purpose in this right and we all have to ask ourselves the same question brothers and sisters what's god's purpose in my life amen right we ought to know the purpose of god in our lives amen young young ladies growing up you know there's a purpose that's right amen god has a purpose for you each one each one of us amen and we see the older saints here that has fulfilled a lot of the purpose of god in our lives i mean but the journal is the same age and me i'm 73 they're votes and you know my only thing i still i tell my folks back home you know i wish i had known god earlier on in my life amen amen hallelujah i wish i had experience praise the lord yes the holy ghost amen amen earlier in my life amen i was 28. i believe i've told you that here before but you know then you start seeing the purpose of god then you start seeing your life through different eyes amen then you start realizing you know well life wasn't life's not about what my first 28 years was about that's right life is about something totally different amen in that 28 years you know coming from catholicism and having a born-again experience coming into the message of the hour the light of the hour not knowing anything about god i didn't know anything about god i mean just a blanket heathen but god by his mercy you know what god knew that's right amen amen god knew there was a young man on earth that was wandering around out there in the maze not knowing who he was or what he was or what he should do and what he shouldn't do not knowing right from wrong not having any power in his life to resist the temptations and everything else that came but god came down and rescued me 45 years ago the journal 45 years and now that's a long time amen right i mean we can rejoice you can look back and and and rejoice with that with the day that god came to your life when you saw that there hey there's a purpose for me amen i'm not i'm not the the guy i used to be i don't do the things i used to do that's right i don't go to places i used to go amen i don't do any of those things no more amen you know god has called me unto a different different ministry it says when god no pearls not only can separate us from the purpose of the living god what god has imagined in his mind the attributes of god what god has purposed in his heart to bring to pass he says there is no demon there there's no power amen there is nothing can ever separate god's great immortal eternal plan that's right amen it has to be as god has said amen amen you know man may do this and man may do that and man may do whatever man is going to do on this earth and man may thought up their websites that do think they're doing a lot of damage but you know what i'm going to read some more stuff to you here that'll tell you there ain't nothing man can do to damage the economy of god not even with a bomb the bomb can go off this morning underneath this building you know and we're safe in the arms of god not a molecule will be changed i can guarantee you that we're in god's will i was reading a message and i've been uh i gotta have a talk with brother jonathan when he when i see him again i wasn't uh i was here on holidays and uh i was thinking well i'm gonna come to church on sunday and uh listen to brother gerald or brother jonathan or whoever is gonna be speaking here today so so that that kind of got twisted around amen now jonathan's on holidays and i'm standing here so we we go back to our statement at the beginning the purpose of god maybe the purpose of god is that brother jonathan should take his family and go rest a bit and enjoy some quiet time and i should stand here this morning and and be in the harness and brother girl can rest as well to everything there is a purpose that's right there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heavens amen a reading from the message that was spoken in 1965 november 27 there are boats i think i have heard but now i see amen right right i have heard but now i see brother branham used the book of job and he used job as a for his text here and he says i have heard of thee by the hearing of the year and now might i have seen thee wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes he says i want to take a text from that fifth verse i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now my eye see at thee now i wrote down some stuff here that i'd like just to read some more i told by the journal uh this morning that i'm i'm a spare tire i preacher i'm not a flat tire i'm not totally you know useless but uh i don't minister very often so bear with me [Music] brother branham used jobs used job he said let's take a little of his life take a little of his life job was a prophet he was a man that lived back before the bible was written he says it's been thought that job was one of the oldest books of the bible because it was written before genesis was written job this great warrior and prophet was a mighty man in his day no doubt that he had been brought up and had served the lord all of his life and had lived such a gallant life to the people all had respects to him right but he come to a place to where he calls it here being tempted off the lord brother branham says but i'd like to use the word being tested by the lord amen right and he uses scripture from over in hebrews he says every son that come to god must first be tested and tried and child trained amen that's right and then if the testing gets hard and we think it's too hard and won't listen take heed that he says we become an illegitimate child excuse me and not a child of god now he says because there's nothing can move a real born-again child of god away from his parents amen see he's part of him you could no more deny it than you could deny yourself see you've had the experience so you've been trained and tested amen now this is job we're talking about here but we've had a profit in our day we'd come in our day son of a moonshiner he had to go through the same thing that job went through amen and the bible tells us in hebrew every son that cometh to god must be tried and tested and proved and proved then the adoption takes place and now this man being a prophet he had access to god's grace yes access to god's grace that's the bank account right that's god's bank account you just put your signature right there along with his say lord that's for me right this walks for me this gospel is for me amen that's right but job didn't have a bible to read the bible wasn't wrote then but he had access to god by revelation and by vision by revelation and by vision that was before the bible was written and we find out and take some of his life when god blessed him and made him a great man why even everybody respected him even to his wisdom had become so great his inspiration from god had vindicated him to be god's servant so plainly until the people come from everywhere to hear him and then satan began to accuse that man amen satan began to take notice of job [Music] and that's the way he does every inspired servant of god satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right and now we find out his life and trials and his great faith faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen amen for by it the bible tells us the elders obtain a good report hey elder amen elder don't have to be this color here to be an elder amen you just have to be full of the holy ghost in power amen bald timothy even jesus when he came on the earth he referred to the patience of job he said have you not read of the patience of job referred to in james 5 11. see faith brother branham says here in this message faith waits with patience amen for the promised word to be fulfilled amen remember that faith waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled amen amen yes that's right praise the lord all down true scriptures brothers and sisters old testament on to the new testament to where we are right today faith faith waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled and that's that statement can go individually into our lives to become that part in our lives when we never forget that those two go together faith and patience go together right amen patience in an age of instant everything this is my words i wrote down here by how impatient we become how impatient we become and we can we can judge that ourselves i don't need to to preach how how or ask you how impatient you are i know what impatience is all about i talk to my wife about it sometimes you know i say honey don't be impatient or she says dad don't be impatient just wait and see what what's going to go on you know just wait can anybody tell me how many months job was on the ash sheep i think it was a lot of months i think it was a lot of months it got so bad he was boiled from head to toe he had lost everything all his stuff that god had built up there for him it was all gone his kids was gone the servants were gone the farms were gone the cattle was gone the donkeys and whatever else he had there all gone and you know what job said anybody know what job said the lord give it and the lord take it away amen see in all this the bible says in all this job did not sin all this can you imagine and you go through that message there i have i have heard but now i see you go through that message and study it a little bit there you know and you find out that job went through all this trial because satan had gone before god right satan was studying job right and he he's got this brain wave you know i'm going to go before god and i'm going to tell him god i can make job cursed you this was satan so i think maybe god had a sense of humor at the time about that and uh god didn't tell job the conversation was between god and satan it wasn't god job and satan so job didn't know what was going on which proved his righteousness right he didn't know that he was being tested that way he had no idea he's been tested that way all job knew was that he had faith and he had patience and he sat on the ash heap for that so many months right and every friend he had turned against them every colleague he had turned against him every one of the business people that he dealt with on a daily basis down at the gate there whatever they all turned against him and finally the most precious thing that god could give a man his wife turned against him joel why don't you curse god and die let it be over job let it be done he says you speak as the foolish woman as a foolish woman shall not we receive from god but satan thought he could twist him around a little bit oh he'd like to twist this word he'd like to twist his word hey he'd like to twist this amen but you know what there's no twisting this this this this is a purpose that's right amen you are the purpose amen glory you were job where were you when the sons of god dance for joy right we were part of god this message came in the end time to reveal god to us amen not just in word form brothers and sisters not just in word form the gospel came not in old times but it was revealed by man but it came in the power and demonstration of the holy spirit amen that is the gospel that's right absolutely not emotions i'm not talking about emotions or anything like that i don't mind emotions i like emotions i'm a little emotional sometimes and i get reading this word here i tell you what i think i can jump over the moon you know i might i might hit the cement wall but you know you get that you get that really good feeling you know you let go and let god have this wonderful way amen and when that happens brothers and sisters you let go and let god have his way it's not all about me what i think we can't get it done we can't do this we can't pay this we can't pay that we can't do something else but god can right god can there's no there's no limit to him his checkbook that's right amen or anything else right but you see job is perfect revelation of god and who god was and how god loved him he waited no matter what no matter what circumstances was he waited waited for his faith to be confirmed because he had a grip of god a revelation hallelujah i think that's so important hallelujah praise the lord that is so important right just to you know instant age we live in instant age in an age that's instant everything is instant you got to send a text if you don't get an answer to that text in five seconds you pick up the phone and find phone did you get my text yeah but my phone's in the bedroom on my phone i'm out doing the laundry or whatever you know see wait i mean we're all we're all humans we all get impatient right we all want things right now immediately if not sooner rain but job you see job with his perfect revelation of god he wasn't in no hurry he just sat there on his ash heap and he had this piece of rock and he's scraping boils head to toe scraping boils so many months one month one month two month three month four month five however long it was every day you had visitors oh job i can't believe you're here job i can't believe this is happening to you what did you do what sin did you do job that caused god to do this what caused this to happen job sat i didn't do anything i didn't do anything brother branham says you know sometimes that's the truth he didn't do anything right but god had hid from job what was going on job sat there all that time and that inspiration that vision that he had always had it was gone amen the vision and the inspiration was gone he couldn't he couldn't make contact no more but yet through the weeks and months until that time came when the end of the trial was up how god loved him but you see job is perfect revelation of god that's what we need right we need a perfect revelation of god amen who god is most people don't know if he's father if he's son or if he's holy ghost if he's all three if he's two if he's one you know that's the way the world today i'm talking they don't know how you're going to how are you going to make contact how are you going to make contact with god if you don't know who he is we don't have a revelation that i and my father are one yeah rey and you i mean we all have we all have christian friends out there in the denomination and so on he waited for his faith to be confirmed because he had a grip on god a revelation amen now brother branham says this now when the sick people that's in the building the crippled people or you that have in need of god when you can get that type of revelation that you are justified justified means you didn't do it that's my interpretation that's the one i've been we didn't do it when you are actually justified in asking the thing that you're asking for and believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him you believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently diligently seek him there's nothing can separate you from that faith that's anchored in you see you know how come this brother here i'll ask you how come you're in the message so many years now don't you know it's time to vacate and you know this message is wrong you heard that right this is the stuff right but you know what he's going to say to me there is nothing wrong there is nothing wrong with the message not one iota not one iota praise the lord he believed it from his youth and he still believes it and he's still acting come on and receiving the word of god amen i read a scripture from to peter and a simon a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith that's what this is really because we have that life that attribute of god in us have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior amen jesus christ he says now this is peter he says now all right says now this is the fisherman that denied he even knew jesus at the crucifixion cussed and so on three times even when he was full of the holy ghost he made a stumble or two peter right him and paul had a few chats so on and he says grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord according as his divine power had given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that had called us to glory and virtue he called us right i was at a little when i was a 14 year old boy i was walking down the sidewalk with a buddy school chum and we were going to the pool hall to get a pop and and so on and i walked by a little i don't know if it was a little was a little church like this one and a lot of noise coming out of that church looked like a lot of live people in there sounded like right and i think it was a pentecostal church and i thought nice stop because it it got my attention right got my attention and i'm just a kid and i thought man i said the vince my chum there i said i think those folks are enjoying their church right well we never did that in the catholic church i mean we went there saturdays and sundays and stuff but i don't remember enjoying anything about that i don't there's nothing to enjoy right what i can understand is how people can still swallow all that right whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by the these you might be made partakers of the divine nature we have our nature changed amen having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue divert your knowledge into knowledge temperance and the temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity love for if these things be in you and abound if they be in you and they abound right amen they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ amen glory hallelujah i mean you can rejoice with me i'm not at home here so i'm just i'm just holding down a little bit nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacked these things is blind and cannot see afar off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if these things be in you ye shall never fall right for sow an entrance hey brother for sowing entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth present truth right that's right yes sir the word present present truth we should rejoice i mean the world has gone insane or has gone insane right people are going insane at a very rapid rate amen right common sense this is like the penny it's gone right amen it's gone common sense right right praise jesus pursue an entrance but wherefore i will not be negligent but you remember of all these things though you know them and be established in the present truth yea i think you'd meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as the lord jesus christ had showed me praise god yeah i'm just about done here for the journal faith is our victory amen faith was job's victory right overcoming power is what we have today right overcoming power to keep the devil away right he can come and and he can go before god and you know i could make her curse you today god i can make her i can make him and you know what god's going to do go ahead i'll just read you this and i think this is a beautiful this is a beautiful i gotta think where it is here it is right here i've heard but now i see satan came before god because he could come before god and accuse the christians or the believers all the time so he accused job of many things and said that job the reason he could serve god because everything was coming good to him for him but said if you'll just let me have him in my hands i'll make him curse you to your face see he says i want you to notice i want you to notice the confidence confidence that god had in a believer all right i want you to notice the confidence that god had in the believer amen in other words god said to job upon me or said to satan like this you can't do it you can't do it he's a just man there's not one like him in the whole earth right there's no one like him in the whole earth oh what a man god was saying this right oh what a man that god himself would say to his enemy my servant is so perfect does not another man on earth like him see oh he says if we could only be that kind of a man that god could bestow that confidence upon us that know that we that we will not twist from his word or his being anyway stay exactly say what the word says right say what the word says don't worry about what anybody else is saying don't even bother with it don't even click onto it forget it right they're not saying what this word says they're not worthy of your attention amen the god could bestow that confidence in him that'll know that that know that will not twist from his word or his being anyway stay exactly and he can put his trust in us now job was a man that carried out god's commandment to the letter exactly and satan knew that but he said if you'll just let me have him even though he knew it but he he wanted to carry on anyways he won i'll make him curse you to your face so god told him he says now he's in your hands but don't take his life and satan even stretched as far as he could on that he took every friend and everything he had almost his complete life but he couldn't take his life but job still held right on there there was no turning back no turning back [Music] take the whole world but give me jesus amen amen jesus john in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh the word was made flesh became a person amen thank you jesus the monsters hallelujah amen praise the lord you see when a man or a person has once really come in contact with god we made the contact amen have you made the contact with god once a man has made the contact with god or a woman or a boy or a girl or anyone with that genuine reveal faith that god is god is right there's nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from his god on the ash heap whatever it is doesn't matter what it is sickness sorrow whatever it may be nothing can separate that man from his god amen right i said he said i believe it was paul says there's no strife and no hunger no pearls neither living creatures and so on he says you are securely anchored in him because because you were ordained to that life you're ordained to that life brother why why am i standing here because god ordained me to this life ordain me a heathen catholic right god before the foundation of the world but satan thought he could twist him around a little bit and cuff him up and make him do it but you see job with his perfect revelation of god and who god was and how god loved him see he waited no matter what the circumstances was circumstances was the boils the family the farm the animals all that he had all the wisdom that he would share back in the day with all the people that came to him asking for advice everything it was all gone all he had was his ash sheep that he was sitting on and he had his faith see he waited for his faith to be confirmed he waited for his faith to be confirmed because he had a grip on god in revelation he says that i spoke off last night he says now when the sick people that's in the building the crippled people or you have that have a need of god when you get that type of revelation that you are justified that you are justified when you are actually justified in asking the thing that you are asking for and believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him does nothing can ever separate you from that faith that's anchored in you amen it's not something that you put on that that's there that's given to you by god there's nothing can ever separate you from that faith that's anchored in you see but first it has to be revealed to you it has to be revealed to you amen if you if you read along in this book he's talking about demas and those guys and god had showed brother venom branham a vision where the oil was in down in kentucky there someplace right yeah but i mean they could have had all that oil but they wouldn't listen to him yes that's right it wasn't god it ended up if you read through this here you'll find out it was all for the wrong wrong reason all for the wrong reason you know they got in squabbles and everything over and so on amen right i'm just about clued up here at the end of that oil thing you know brother branham says they were having lunches as the holy spirit showed me a great crack in the earth and in that was full of oil and these overflows in kentucky was just little beds of oil that we're pumping from but this one comes from the mainstream and i said brother demas it's there so they went to searching for it says go down and tell us where where the oil well is to ask billy branham he says oh no no no see we don't use the gift of god for commercial no no see he could he could tell me where it was at but i don't have any need of it i wouldn't i wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him see so you judge faith right if you have faith brother branham had faith we have faith but here's a prophet of god and they said they're saying go down and tell us where it's at and he says i wouldn't i wouldn't have faith do you and even if i did he said i wouldn't have faith to ask him he had no need of that and why what what motive what objective reign he says you don't use the gift of god for a commercial no no he could tell me where it's at but you don't have any need of it see i wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him see if i had in need of it i believe if i'd ask him he'd tell me he says but first first you see your motives and objectives has to be right right you have to have reasons for this see god don't give you those things just because you ask and you cannot ask in faith unless there's a real objective to that you cannot ask in faith see unless there's a real objective to that see to be in the will of god see if you want if you want to be well what you want to be if you want to be well he says if you want to be well if you're sick you want to be well he says see well what do you want to be well for see if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling god what do you want to do with your life when you get healed see there's got to be you've got to have a motive and objective and they have to be right according to the will of god hallelujah and then and then when the faith is revealed to you then's when the faith then the fate is revealed to you right and god by his sovereign grace places that faith in there then it's over see and he says and and he says but because of selfishness talking about the oil people the object got among it the objectives was wrong signing up in a bunch of stuff it would be this way and then so on when they promised they would do it for the kingdom of god see but looked like it was for themselves and it won't work he says no selfish thing will work your motives and objectives has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith there see and that's what first john says if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence with god amen then you have confidence to go on your knees and pray and everything is good between you and god when all the channels and all the flus are blowed out you know what i mean and and and you get that pathway clear between you and god because you're his child amen father and son father and daughter right he says then we have confidence see we've got to have confidence i want this to be to be to the honor and the glory of god then faith has a channel to move in faith has that channel to move in see faith has got to have that channel to move in right that channel has to be clear if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine faith from god that intellectual faith will get you no worse might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for excuse me so job checking himself with the genuine faith that god had given to him that he was just pardon me that he had done everything that god required him to do and he says now when we're going to be prayed for for our sickness i wonder if we've done everything that god requires us to do have we followed every iota of the scripture have we given him our hearts and lives to service have we what's the reason you want to be healed that's the reason that's the reason you can't get faith enough seed because you haven't maybe make this thing to god sincerely from your heart like hezekiah did give god give god the reason he wants to set his kingdom in order that was hezekiah and god sent his prophet back and told him and and he'd be healed see but have those things made right first see so then as soon as you get to those places and know that it's been revealed to you by the word of god by the revelation by the word that god requires you to do then you have faith genuine faith amen amen is there a clock here someplace what time does that say i can't see it from here i can see the clock but i can't see the handset 12 47 when did i start 12 46. i could figure out when did i start really quarter to 12 and now it's 12 45. is that a half an hour 62 minutes okay that's good i thought man i'm getting slower and slower and slower not getting nothing done we just read one more here it's about our father abraham he's always a good subject amen amen i don't i don't want to to go for half an hour more but i'll just i'll just read this now just like abraham when he was 99 years old i believe genesis 17 god appeared to this old man old man so old man 73 73 not so old not so old i don't think they right but god appears to old men i just want you to know that now 90 and 90 years old so we got a long ways to go brother gerald 20 years is a a long time when when he was almost 100 years old that had been waiting upon that promise all these years he appeared to him in the name of el shaddai the breasted one and what an encouragement it was yet the promise wasn't fulfilled then see but abraham he says i am the almighty god ill shadow the strength giver the breasted god like i've told you before like the little baby that's fritting and sick and crying and it lays upon its mother's breast and nurses its strength back from her because it's satisfied while it's nursing because the only access it has and knows off is the mother's breast and it knows no dose of medicine you might give him a dose of medicine he'll squeal and cry give him a shot in the arm and he'll carry on but the only access to satisfy him is the mother's breast and he said abraham you're old your strength is gone your arms are withered up your manhood's gone but i am your mother just take a hold of my promise be satisfied while you're waiting be satisfied while you're waiting job was the yaniya sheep he was satisfied while he waited he couldn't they couldn't move him they couldn't budge him he was rock solid yes they couldn't budge joke be rested now that's the way every believer no matter how bad the cancer has got you how long you've been in a wheelchair or any of these things just if you can grasp that revelation from god then he then be satisfied if you can grasp that revelation from god god is right god is he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him god is see then be satisfied knowing that it's going to happen because faith waits patiently for diplomacy job knew that he was right when we find out here in the scripture that them fellows come to him them church members everything that once seemed dear to him had turned against him and tried to accuse him of being a secret sinner all of these things happen to him you hear people yet today say i told you look at him i told you right everybody got their own ideas right right see that that ain't all together the truth he says and i spoke this before to you sometimes it's god testing his people in this case it was god testing job the best man there was on the earth at the time now he was holding him then because he knew that job was a prophet that had a vision from god that he had exactly done what god told them to do see god was duty bound to keep his promise to him oh all christians has got to be that has got to be that when the last struggle of our life comes and death rattles in our throat we still must hold steady and remember that god said i'll raise him up at the last day right see got to hold that on our testimony our place in christ our position when we what we are knowing that we have kept every word of his commandment blessed are they that do his commandments that they might have the right to enter in and when we know that no matter what anyone has said we've kept every commandment that we see in the bible that god has told us to do with reverence and love and respect to the creator who wrote the bible there you go and i'll i'll finish there so maybe we can sing that chorus again we'll walk in the light [Music] [Music] we
