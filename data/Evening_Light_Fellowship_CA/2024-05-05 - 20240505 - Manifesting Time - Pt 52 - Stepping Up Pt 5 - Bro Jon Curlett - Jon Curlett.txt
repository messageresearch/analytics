we're resting on it it's a sure Foundation Lord It's a shelter in a time of storm Lord It's a rock in a weary land and Lord we're here this morning to claim your word Lord we're here to rest on your word we're here to obey your word we're here to receive your word we're here to act on your word Lord God lord we're here that your word could have dominion so that Satan cannot Lord Lift us up this

new this morning Lord may you overflow Lord fill this building we pray Lord we give you the glory we give you the honor we give you the praise in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you this morning and turn if you would to Revelations chapter 1 amen sure enjoy the song service this morning the spirit that's in the building this morning God is so good amen amen God bless you just a quick announcement before we preach this morning we've got the Family Camp finally booked and and confirmed so that's the camp we usually do every year in August and it'll be from August 22nd through August 25th so that starts on a Thursday and ends on Sunday so we're going an extra day this year now we won't have service on the Thursday night we're just going to make it nice and easy so people don't have to rush if they have to stay for work and and whatnot that we can just kind of get there Thursday get settled in and then we'll have Services Friday night Saturday night and Sunday morning Lord willing amen so certainly thankful for that it takes a while to to book because they they have people that and groups that book all the time every year and so they've got to they've got to let all of them have their first opportunities and then we kind of get with whatever is left behind but by God's grace we got the weekend we were looking for so we praise the Lord for that um we don't have a minister just yet I'm I'm just still praying on that and waiting on that there have been some changes to my original intentions so we'll see how the Lord would lead but uh keep those in prayer amen amen it's good to be here this morning Revelation chapter 1 the same scripture we open with on Wednesday says John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and ha made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for forever and ever amen amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing with our series on manifesting time and I want to take a fifth service on stepping up and we spoke last service quite extensively about the the priesthood side of things and the royal priesthood and we read in the scriptures there that we are priests unto God our services to God but we are outwardly facing to the people that are around us we know that God had a chosen people he had the Levites that he ordained and he anointed and he clothed and he he set them up with purpose so that they could atone for the sins of the people that they could be a mercy to the people they were the ones that had the blood amen and then we talked about how that has come into our lives now and and we are literally brother Bram says the bride is the blood by the spirit amen we are a walking Mercy seed because where the life is that's where the blood is and so we are there to intercede on behalf of those that can't approach the throne that don't know don't know how to come to God they don't even know there is a God and yet they see something in our lives something in our testimony whatever it is and they come to us and they say can you help us can you pray what should I do and these sorts of things and so we intercede and we saw there that our attitude and reaction is one of the biggest things we need to control because if our attitude is wrong we can hold somebody back from something that would help them or save them amen and that becomes so critical it's easy to to be kind and gracious when people need you but what about when people are persecuting when people are giving you a hard time when it's affecting your work and your income and your your family and these different things it's a whole lot more difficult to be charitable in those situations and to show that love and grace of God but we saw that that intercession is greatest when the person doesn't deserve it amen when they're persecuting when they're pushing when they're fighting it but yet we absorb that and we see that Christ did that on the cross of Calvary is that he absorb the punishment he said don't charge them with this they don't know what they're doing charge it to my account I'll pay the price I'll take the pain I'll take the suffering I'll take the persecution only save them give them an opportunity for mercy and Grace amen but we know that this n this gospel is the nature of Grace amen the gospel is first and foremost free it's for whosoever will we know that and ultimately to reject it is to accept judgment but the Judgment comes later amen our judgment to others comes later for now we offer grace and mercy because the blood is still on The Mercy Seat but we want to step into this this this other portion of the scripture and I said last service that if you get the priesthood right you'll get the kingship right because the nature of a priest slides into the kingship as we'll see as we go through these things and we're going to take at least two services on this kingship I believe because I've been studying on two different things simultaneously and it's hard to preach when you've got your mind going in two directions but it's two parts of the same thing and I want to speak about this kingship role perfectly and we read in Revelations 1:6 it says and ha made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen it says now we are Kings now we are Kings now we are priests to God Amen we're not made Kings to the people around us we're not Kings to New Finland we're not Kings to Canada we're not Kings to the the nations of this world Amen but we are Kings to God and we are in that role right now today amen if we Are Holy Ghost filled Sons and Daughters of God then this is what God has built us for is to be Kings and Priests to him to serve those that are around us and Jesus said this in 25 because we want to look if we're Kings we have to have a kingdom amen we have to be part of a kingdom and so we need to know our kingdom if we are if we can understand our kingship and and Jesus said this he says when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory he says and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a Shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand and the Goat but the goats on the left he says then shall the king say unto them on his right hand who the Sheep those are out of his household those that are of his family he says then shall the king say unto them on his right hand Come Ye blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the world in other words full kingship comes after our time on this Earth and what we get is not a kingdom because we have fought for it we have a kingdom by inheritance amen it is his work it is his provision because it was before the foundation of the world that this kingdom was created for us and we're now being brought back to what was supposed to be ours in the very beginning then we jump to Revelation five amen a and we see the seven seal book of redemption and after that book is opened the book has to be open for us to step into this role we'll see that and it says here that it has and thou Hast made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall future tense Reign on the earth amen our our our our rule on this Earth is not now amen over the natural over the elements of the world these different things that is not our Rule now remember what Jesus said when he was here in his first Ministry and he's before Pilate and pilate's talking to him about who are are are you the king of the Jews and Jesus says my kingdom is not of this world my kingdom if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews he says but now is my kingdom not from hence so Jesus Is Telling pilate here he says my servants fight for their Kingdom and they fight for their Kingdom for their King he says but you'll notice my servants aren't fighting for me me why because this is not my kingdom this is not it if it was my servants would be fighting you'd have a riot on your hands you'd have a rebellion on your hands he says but notice nobody's fighting for me why because I'm not a king of this world but notice what he says but now is my kingdom not from hence he says for now it's not of this world but in one day it will come down to this world and it'll be my kingdom instead of Satan's kingdom there's a time and a season for him to rule and Reign and it'll be in the millennial Reign where he rules with a rod of iron as the son of David on the throne of David to give them the Thousand Years of Peace but when that's done that's not his kingdom truly his kingdom is what comes after it that's the son of David rule but then now he comes back and what is he he is Lord of lords he is overall and it's back in in in the Garden of Eden condition again because the Earth is cleansed by fire if we look at Ministries we can see if they're off the word or Not by what kingdom they're fighting for what are they struggling for what is it they're pulling for are they pulling for money are they pulling for influence are they pulling for wealth are they pulling for for all of these things are they trying to take back the country take back the city Take Back The Province we can't do those things it's not in the word that is not our it's not our fight it's not our kingdom we're not here to establish your theocracy that's what the world was supposed to be was one World under God but it's not now and it will never be that way until we come back completely to Christ and so when we look at Ministries we look at them and we say are they looking to to get away from the world or are they looking to control the world are they looking to influence the world or are they looking to get people that want to leave this world you know my wife always says this she says I know that you're part of my people when you want to get out of here amen that's who that's how we identify is that we are pilgrims and strangers here and what we're looking for is other pilgrims and strangers not citizens of this Kingdom amen we've got a a desire to go to a city whose Builder and maker is God Amen that's what we're looking for day by day and so the ministry's work is to find those pilgrims and strangers and say let's get out of here together let's help each other along the way the ministry of this end time is to prepare our souls for a Heavenly Kingdom not to recruit people for an Earthly Dimension that's not what we're looking for Paul says this in 1 Corinthians 7 he says but this I say Brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they Rejoice not and they that buy as though they possess not he says for they that use this world is not abusing it for the fashion of this world passes away in other words you go into the Amplified it says for the outward form of this present world is passing away so in other words what this world has is dying it's falling away it's decomposing it's bound for Destruction and there's no hope for it and therefore it has to fall in order that Eden can be restored it has to be destroyed so that that perfect Eden can come back therefore we can't hold tightly to it we can't claim it we can't make it a part of our our our inheritance it's not force it's already under a curse there is no coming back from under a curse it has to be destroyed and something has to come up new and it's going to have to require a full Redemption amen Christ's kingdom is not of this Earth and so if we're looking and saying now as adopted Sons and Daughters we're going to be going around claiming this earth that is not it we are not part of that Kingdom we have control and we have we have rights within this world and it has an impact on the physical absolutely it does we know that it does because we've seen it in our own lives amen but our kingdom is not of this Earth and what we're fighting for is not of what is here right now that is not what we are pulling for amen if we are Kings to God then our kingship is in his realm not in a realm of our choosing amen it's a spiritual realm and we see here today that Christ has Authority in this earth absolutely it does because what happens is when Sons and Daughters of God are here God moves in situations God influences things God changes things anden we have prayed for perfect weather for things and we get it we have prayed for provision we prayed for jobs we prayed for uh Grace in the eyes of people we prayed for opportunities and God has given it to us hasn't he God is concerned with the Affairs of the children of this Earth a as they are his children but he is not here to assert his full Authority here he's only here to get his children to the Finish Line that's what he cares about the rest is Bound for Destruction and so he's left it is part of Satan's Eden and Satan is the one that is in control we know that cuz he offered it to Jesus he says I'll give you these kingdoms if you'll just worship me they belong to him all of it belongs to him so our kingdom must be of a different realm and therefore our kingship must be of it and it must be of a different place and a different purpose and it can't have anything tied to this Earthly this Earthly Kingdom that we're here brother Brian would say this he says in Revelation 15:3 it says and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great and marvelous are thy Works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou King of saints he says do you see it the lamb the high priest holding his blood as an atonement on The Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God Almighty he says that is his present office that's why we are priests today amen we're under a mercy gospel he says this is what he's doing now pleading his blood for our sins he says but one day that lamb will become the lion of the tribe of Judah you know we we maybe you've seen this this thing before and people say Only God can judge me we never want to get there because he's a lamb right now he comes back as a lion you don't want to mess with a lion a lamb you can work with a lion he has no mercy it's only judgment under a lion Ministry he says he will come forth in power and glory and take his authority to reign hising King he's the coming king of this Earth of course he says that does not say he's not King now for he is our King he's the king of the Saints right now it is a spiritual Kingdom it's not of this world system even as we are not of this world that's the reason we act different from the world our citizenship is of Heaven amen we don't get caught up in the things of this world as citizens of Canada or as residents of new land that's not where we focus he says we reflect the spirit of the world of our rebirth where Jesus is the king he says that's why are women do not dress in men's clothing or cut their hair or use all those cosmetics and other things that the world likes so much he says that's why our men don't drink and smoke and carry on in sin now catch this he says our Dominion is the dominion over sin our Dominion is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us he says every Kingdom on Earth is going to be torn down but ours will remain our Dominion is what over sin and the power that enforces it is this life of Christ inside of us which is the holy spirit amen amen let's step it up a notch now we're talking about stepping up this morning we're talking about being Kings and we know that Kings have authority Kings have power Kings have armies Kings have resources kings are absolute Within in their Kingdom Nobody messes with a king what a king says happens nobody can go against a king amen let's go back to the beginning because we'll see there where our Dominion is and what we were meant to be and we'll take the type and Shadow through to where we are today now in Genesis God said this he says let us make man in our image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over what the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over all the Earth and over everything every creeping thing that creeps upon the Earth see from the beginning we were meant to have dominion we were meant to be rulers we were meant to be Kings and Queens on this Earth that was our purpose and we see today that what's happened is that man is striving for Dominion we have this world and we're taking it and we're using it for our benefit we have conquered all animals there's no animal out there that can beat a human while we're in our little wimpy flesh perhaps but what have we done we have made weapons and we've made armor and we've made great things that help us to have dominion over everything on this earth when it comes to any living creature we have dominion and we're using this Earth for our benefit but what is happening in our Dominion is what death and destruction that's the only thing that's coming out of it amen why because it's a broken Dominion because we're craving Dominion but we lack the holy spirit that they had in the beginning we lack that perfect character that was there and so everything that's coming out is what death and destruction we think we're making our lives better and all that happens is they just make it worse it never comes to a higher level I was talking with somebody and and they're saying you know every every year or two what we do is we correct what we thought was right speaking of World Knowledge and these things and then what happens is a couple years after that we correct what we thought was right and we're constantly correcting and adapting our knowledge and trying to do what have a perfect Dominion but we can't do it we've Fallen away we're Fallen creatures but what's driving it what's driving it is God said let them have dominion and so man has something inside of him that's craving for Dominion that's craving for control that's craving for Authority but we're going to step it up because we're talking about ourselves this morning we don't want to talk about the world so much brother B says this he says no wonder Elijah laid his body upon that dead baby and it come to life it was God in that man God had took over I say this morning God take over amen that when I touch something when I speak something when I believe something when I'm in prayer for something God takes over and it happens amen he says Jes he was anointed Jesus said he was every prophet of God in the Old Testament was anointed with the Holy Ghost they were then they were lesser lights he was the fullness of God being Messiah they were Messi hates then smaller Messiahs they were Anointed with the same spirit that he was anointed with only he had it in the fullness so what makes the difference Church the holy Holy Ghost the anointing of God that's what makes the difference not what I think not what I say not what I believe but it's the holy spirit in me that's going to make the difference when it all comes down to it we read that scri that that quote last service where he was saying we are little Messiahs what each of us little lights little anointed ones that God is trying to work through in this earth I don't care how little your light is if you have light then you can defeat any Darkness that's it that's it Darkness cannot stand where light is because darkness is the absence of light so where light is automatically you have Victory where you have the holy ghost victory is automatically there light is there now catch this because he's speaking about prophets and we we look at those great men of God and we say well obviously that's what they had but watch this he says and every man today let me say every woman today that's received the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is Anointed with the same spirit that Jesus of Nazareth was he says that went about doing good and Healing The Sick he says oh my that makes me feel good to know that he lives today he says there's something about a man he is a God he was made to be a god his purpose here on Earth was to be a God to have a dominion over everything in the earth that's what it was meant to be but we notice as we're reading these scriptures that we don't get that full Dominion till later we have a portion now and it's by the leadership of the Holy Spirit but we don't have full Dominion why because we don't have full Redemption full Dominion comes with full Redemption because with full Redemption we'll have not only the character but we'll lose the sin nature of this flesh as well that's needed to have full dominion and the problem is today is that we're seeking not we people are seeking Dominion without the fullness of redemption and so all that leads is it it to is to destruction now brother Bron would talk a lot about dominion and he' talk about kingdoms and I'm going to start with kingdoms this morning and then we'll move into Dominion but we see here what it looks like to be a king in a kingdom because a kingdom is made up of what a person and then a property a person and a property a kingdom is a parcel of land it can be a city it can be a country whatever it is and then the kingdom is everything within the borders of that land whatever is within it is a kingdom and the one that has full Authority there is the king amen what is our borders the word of God that's I know that I have absolute Authority is if I can find it in the word of God I know that it is part of my Dominion if I can find it within the word of God and anything outside of that I have to leave it alone we don't go on Satan's Satan's Turf he has his Turf and we have ours and we've got to stay there amen but who is our kingdom if if who is in our kingdom if our kingdom is the word of God then who is our citizens who is our Dominion it's anyone that's in that Kingdom anyone that comes comes under our Authority by the word of God either willingly or by relationship as we'll see or by headship maybe if we want to do that so A kingdom is a portion of land with defined borders amen and it's written and it's drawn everybody knows where the borders of Canada are why because they've got them on maps and then they've got it drawn and then they've got Gates that are there and they've got controls to keep people from going in and out without do do Authority or access and then everything within those borders is also part of that Kingdom so look at Canada and we have we have all these people and that's part of the country we call it a kingdom in the old days amen all the citizens all the Crown Land all the resources all the minerals the water the forests all these different things are part of the kingdom and under a kingship rule all of those things are under the authority and Rule of that King he owns it all he controls it all it all belongs to him and what's he's saying here he's saying that we all belong to a kingdom and we have dominion in that Kingdom but we have to know what that Kingdom looks like amen we're built to be in Dominion we long for it We crave for it there's a thing that's calling out for it and you know why we want it is because we want control because if we can have control then we can have the peace we can have the rest we can have the certainty of all the things that this flesh wants that's why we want Dominion that's why people are struggling to be the big dog is because they think if I get to the top then I will have all of my needs I will have all of my wants nothing can touch me thou fool know you not that tonight your soul will be required of thee but they're doing it because there's something inside of them that's meant for Dominion the thing is a child of God has a place that can be filled and that's what the Holy Spirit coming into the heart but a child of Satan can't fill that hole why because there's nothing there that will fill it it's empty there's nothing that can fill it they're a child of Satan there's nothing that can come in to change it it's just being natural it's a natural part of humanity to try and control what's around of us but we look at a kingdom so often as what is around us something that's outside of us but when we look at a spiritual Kingdom there's only one place we truly have control and that's right here the only thing I can control is me and even that only poorly how in the world could I control you why in the world would I want to control you if I recognize my true condition our true Fallen condition we spoke about adoption how its purpose is to bring ourselves subject to the purpose and the will of God for our lives and kingship is always first found in our own lives before we ever have dominion over anybody else absolutely that's true we see it in Scripture that before you can have authority you must be under Authority before you can be a king you must be under a king when we're talking about the spiritual Kingdom otherwise what happens is it's a blind leading the blind and we both end up in the ditch you can't do it it won't work that way listen to what David said he says he that had no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls anywhere in other words a man that has no rule over his own spiritual Kingdom his own Spirit his own nature inside of him if that is out of order you can't help somebody else bring theirs into order why he says you got no walls anybody can come in and out you are completely open to influence because you have no boundaries around your life you are completely open to somebody else coming in and taking over your kingdom he says a man that has no self-control that has not set up boundaries in his life that has not protected his life by the word of God is going to be under influence that is uncertain at all times we never know who's in control but here's the thing is he who says he has no choice is already under Dominion see we say there's no there there's nothing around here there's nothing protecting me I have no choice what you realize is if you if you don't have any walls then you've already made your choice that's your choice is to not have walls anden as Believers we need to have walls and those walls need to be firmly balanced and and structured in this amen that's where our walls are and when you take that away here's the way that Satan works as Satan Works to get us to a place where we say I don't have a choice when you've done that you've You' already made a choice let me take you to the scriptures Shadrach mhach and Abednego the three Hebrew children they said we have no choice We Will Not Bow why because they were living by the word of God but every single other so-called believer bowed themselves to the idol why we have no choice they had committed themselves to a different Dominion they were under Dominion of Satan in their believing that they were what well I it's okay I'm trying to save my life God will understand God will not understand God gives his word and he backs up his word and in saying I don't have a choice every single other one of those Hebrew children lost the ability to have a supernatural experience that's it when we say I have no choice I must do this I've got to put God aside for the moment what we do is we put the supernatural completely out of our life cuz God's got nothing to back up now you're on your own you're under another Dominion you're under another influence in your life the key to self-control is to set boundary by the words by the word of God that's the way we do it if I can't guard myself how can I guard you if I can't protect myself how can I protect you Paul said this in Romans 6 and we're going to spend a bit of time here this morning he says let not sin therefore re in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof the first place that we must have reigning is in our own lives there must be a king and he says Don't let let sin be king in your life don't let unbelief in the word of God have control in your life he says otherwise you're going to obey the lust of this body and this flesh you're going to fall into a lifestyle of feeding this flesh What It Wants rather than what it needs Amen brother B says this he says and a man never knows what it is to live a Victorious life until he's completely overcome Glory who himself he says that's the big biggest enemy you've got is yourself amen if we're going to be Kings we've got to let somebody else be king amen there has to be a victory in these lives Paul will continue he says neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness of sin unto sin he says but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God what's the key to not letting sin be king let somebody else be King instead of sin Let The Great king of kings and Lord of Lords be king and that way you've got that King there sin can't come in and be king sin can't reign in your body if you'll give the kingship to him then he'll protect you he'll take authority he'll control what's going on in your body and in your life amen cuz one thing certain church I can't be king of me and you can't be king of you that ain't going to work it's got to be somebody outside of us because we are born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world SE speaking Lies We cannot control ourselves we need another Dominion or authority in our lives to take us out of who and what we are in our natural birth amen if we're going to be in Authority we've got to yield ourselves first we've got to let another Authority be in US Paul says yield yourselves unto God give control to him he says how do you do it act like you're dead and somebody else made you alive act like you've died out and don't just act like it die out die out daily Paul would say this in Galatians 5 he says and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts our kingdom is what a kingdom of God we're under his headship we're under his authority and we are Kings and Priests but we are under God and so we see here that under that kingship we must first conquer self and the only way to do that is to kill self and everything attached to it that's it that's it amen we've got to conquer this before we can conquer anything outside of it Paul continues in Romans he says for sin shall not shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace church I love when something says shall not because that makes it an absolute it's not just a promise but church this is something that we can enforce this is something we can enforce I was talking with somebody a while ago and they said how do I get rid of this I said you've got to want to let it go you've got to want to let it go but when you want to let it go then you've got this that says sin shall not have dominion over me and God is behind his word the Holy Spirit is there to enforce the promise that sin doesn't have rain in your life that's what we're supposed to do as we say Lord I'm enforcing the promise you said sin won't win I don't want sin there I'm asking you to take it out of my life Lord I'm asking you to take away my unbelief Lord I'm asking you to take away the coolness of my relationship with you Lord I'm asking you to heal my body whatever it might be say sin shall not have dominion not may not not no no no there's no doubt about it sin shall not and Lord I'm here for your word to enforce that promise in my life you know I was listening to brother Aon mcir this morning and he said he said for the Believers he says whenever there's a des there's a deficit there's desperation and I thought that was just a beautiful thing to say because what happens is when we see the promise and we see our lives we see our bodies we see our relationships we see whatever we're at this morning when we see a difference a deficit between the word and ourselves then a desperation ought to come before us and say God lift me higher Lord help me to step up in your word Lord build up my faith Lord build up my strength Lord build up my relationship help me to look and feed on the things that are of God so that I can come into the place where your word promises deficit ought to drive what what's driving us what's driving us why do we work harder deficit of money why do we try and get a better job def deficit of housing or vehicles or these different things he says a Believer when they have a deficit in the word ought to have a desperation that God would fulfill it in their lives that he would raise them up to a higher level but Paul says this he says you're not under grace you're not under the law he says the way this works will not be under that Mosaic law thou must thou must thou must he says but it will be under grace that this happens this overcoming this Dominion is by yielding is by yielding to the Holy Spirit and that is what will have dominion now this is what will change you from a sin Dominion to a holy ghost to a kingdom of God Dominion but it's a day-by-day thing this is a day-by-day fight it's a day-by-day struggle it's a day-by-day choice for the believer in this age amen it's not just a salvational experience it's not just coming to the altar it's not just a baptism it's not just a church service but it's a day byday uh struggle it's a day-by-day battle to let the Holy Spirit take dominion over any sin to hold back any unbelief amen amen that's a choice we make it's a daily choice of where I'm going to let Dominion be in my life Paul said this he says but I keep constantly always I always keep under my body and bring it under subjection you go to the Amplified says I keep control of my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Cast Away remember I said last service that I keep my body away from things that i' ought not to have and and these different things except for donuts and chocolate Easter eggs Jonathan gave me some more yesterday but I guard my life why because this flesh loves the Dominion of sin it loves it that never changes until we get our full Redemption when we get a glorified body this body loves it and so what do I do my soul is sealed I have no worries about where I'm going if I should die today but this body is in a constant battle Paul says and I've got to keep it under subjection and how do you kill your enemy starve him starve him don't let him have food don't let them have water because if I take this body now now catch this if I take this body and I put the world in front of it it will feed on the word and it will start to like it because the world is built to satisfy the flesh that is Satan's kingdom that is his temptation for us is to satisfy the desires of the flesh Paul says we've got to kill it with its affections and with its lusts we've got to crucify it so how do I do that I take it away from those things that it craves but if I put it in front of me then this flesh will feed on whatever I put on it did you know you can feed your flesh the word of God absolutely you can but it wanton wants everything but the word of God but the Inner Man desires something else and so when the Holy Spirit is in Dominion in my life then my inner man controls my outer man and it controls what I put in front of it because otherwise I can sit there and if I put rock and roll in front of this fleshly body it'll eventually start to feed on it the things that I now hate it will start to like because that's what I'm feeding it if I put worldly entertainment in front of it if I put worldly friends around it all of these things if I put the problems of this world you know come on I mean we we know this country is Fallen we know the world is Fallen it's in debt it it's it's completely gone insane and if I dwell on the insanity if I dwell on the unfairness if I dwell on the problems and what happens is this body starts to feed on it and those things start to take dominion and so then what we have is the flesh rising up in dominion and the inner man is starting to fail why because my feeding is mostly on the flesh side rather than the inner man this body feeds on those things and it'll dominate my conversation it'll dominate my spare time it'll dominate my testimony it'll dominate everything that I have around me and it will overcome my life and it'll start to rule over me that's the way s works as he's working from the outside in and what God is saying is saying let the Inside Man out let him push out and let him take dominion over things that's why people today are so consumed with issues that have nothing to do with them and that are so small and insignificant is because they're feeding on those things and it rises up inside of them and it becomes an influence and it takes dominion over them and so often what they see is is this big problem and they don't see all the other problems it's creating in their very life why because it's a demonic Dominion that's taken over them they've got tunnel vision now everything's tunnel vision everything is you know the alphabet Lifestyles and everything's this and that and it's like we've got so much bigger problems and yet we're sitting here wondering about pronouns and gender what is it gotten obsessed and they've come under the Dominion of something and it's not Christ what comes out of it what comes out of it we see what this world is full of fear stress obesity worry concern marital problems mental problems something like 80% of people now in North America they say suffer from a mental a mental issue 80% that's almost everybody as much as matters why because they're feeding this flesh rather than the Inner Man and it has dominion over their lives that's why we need to keep it under there is no satisfying this body that's the thing nobody tells you there is no satisfying this body much craves more this flesh will want more and more and more you make more money it'll want more money you make more than that then it'll want more you buy a car it wants a nicer car you buy a big house it wants a bigger house you go on a good vacation it wants a better vacation you buy nice clothes it wants better clothes there is no end to this there is no end to it it's a hamster on a tread you know those wheels that are inside the only way to stop is get off otherwise it'll keep spinning and nothing changes nothing changes on that tread willll nothing's going on so I've got to refuse to cater to the desires of this flesh I have to willingly consciously say no no no more chocolate Easter eggs whatever it is Satan throws in front of us why cuz if I do that then I've got a promise that sin will not have dominion over me and now I can rise up in kingship I can rise up in priesthood this is what Paul said about this this is Paul speaking to his own church now he says that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man you know what that word might is it's that word dunamis it means Force Power strength ability it means the power the power to achieve by the Lord's Spirit those things that are innate in him in other words what is built into the Holy Ghost will come out of you that is not just a spirit but is a spirit with power it is a spirit with abilities it is a spirit with purpose and when we are strengthened in the inner man then what comes out of it is power what what comes out of it now is effect amen that's what we're looking for Paul says this in second Timothy for God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind that word sound mind has a twofold meaning and the first one is the one that we would think it's a mind that is settled a mind that is is not swayed by anything outside of the word of God but the second meaning is of sound mind is selfcontrol and moderation that we have a spirit that keeps us in balance that doesn't keep us running after this and running after that but it keeps us right in the middle of the road where God wants us to be amen that's the spirit that we have in the Holy Ghost that's what he's doing you know we're looking for great things in our in our Christian walk I believe this in talking and fellowshipping with many of you over the past six months perhaps we're in expectation for God to not just move in our personal lives and in our personal bodies but in those that we're interacting with in our co-workers and people we meet on a daily basis and in school and all of these different things and we're looking for these things but I want to say before we look for that who's in control today in our lives who's in daytoday control not Sunday morning and Wednesday night control but dayt day where is Dominion in our life who has Dominion who is it that's controlling what we're doing how we're speaking how we're spending our time and all of these things there ought to be overcoming in our dayto day if the holy spirit's there amen why because the first work of the holy spirit is always internal it's in me and it's in you as individuals before it ever starts pushing out to somebody else that's why they had to go to the upper room before they could ever fulfill Mark 16 they had to go up and get power what they had to they had to defeat themselves they had to settle it in inside of them they had to yield to the power of the Holy Spirit you know we think of Kingdoms and we think of Thrones and crowns and great wealth and power and authority and armies and Military might and Wars and victories and all of these things and we know that with kingship comes great power and that what you say is law if you're King everything is absolute Kings Kings when there was in the time of the Kings they were Untouchable nobody could mess with a king if they said you die you died if they said your stuff is mine your stuff was theirs there was no stopping and holding back a king he had absolute power but that is an Earthly Kingdom design that's the way of man that's not the way of God and so everything in an Earthly Kingdom is always focused on the king himself but under Christ's Reign under Christ's Kingdom this heavenly Kingdom we have a different model we have a different model for how we run things and Jesus said this in Matthew 20 he says but Jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them and that they are great exercise of authority upon them so Satan's model is that you exert Authority you force yourself onto people you force them to obey you you force them to give to you you tax them you take from them you do all these things that Satan's model is force I'm going to force you to give me what I want and it's for self-benefit it's for self-benefit he says but it shall not be so among you this is not the way God's kingdom Works he says for whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister now we look we talk Minister and we talk about The Man Behind the pulpit the preachers but remember the the root word for minister is servant servant and it's a servant that's given authority over a certain area but it is still a servant they serve somebody else he says and whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many so we see this kingship model is not the same as this world's kingship model it is not about the king it is about the people under his authority that that's what we'll see he says Jesus said brother Braham says this he says Jesus said give me some help here Jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant of all a wise man commented on that saying and here's what he says only history will prove the truth of that dictum he says that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame you look at some of these great generals you look at Napoleon look at his failing look at Julius Caesar killed by his own best friend you look at these great men and in all their conquering and all their leading yet it was for personal gain and they go down in shame he says even the very rich are condemned by God that they have not used their wealth right but look into history he says and you will find that the truly great were those who served others history can never Acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others we're looking at a kingdom model now he says now let us apply that to ourselves this is for me this is for you he says even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the Apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet church I don't think we understand what dirty feet look like because we wear we wear these great shoes that cover us up and we've got waterproof this and that but in those days it was sandals and as you're walking along what happens dirt gets in there sweat gets mingled with it there's animals that are droppings everywhere and you're stepping in these things and so those feet are not just dirty they are filthy they're not something you want to touch and that's why they had the servants do it and he says this is what he does and he comes to his Apostles he comes to those that are beneath him and he serves them he does something disgusting he does something that is so below him brother Bram calls him a footwash flunky amen are we willing to lower ourselves for the sake of our brothers and sisters for those that are around us he says he said you don't know now what I'm doing but you'll know Hereafter but what you see me doing you ought also to do he became a servant in order that God could Elevate him to the highest Heights the Way Up Is Down he says and one day in the Judgment of the Saints we're going to hear him say Well done good and faithful what servant enter thou into the joy of the Lord next slide it says it is hard to be always a servant always oh we get tired out don't we brother Bob we get tired out it's hard doing a Sunday school lesson every weekend no matter what it's hard to clean the church two times a week when we've got busy lives it's hard to sit down and study and study and pray and pray and pray without ceasing there are no breaks to the servants you know it's funny you look in the scripture and Jesus saidou know if a servant works all day you know then then will the master come and lay out food for his servants and say here let me serve you he says no a servant serves and so what the Master's going to do is say serve me my food and then you can have yours it's hard to always be a servant because nobody serves you but if we're part of a body remember every joint supplies what's needed we're all here to support each other but we're all giving knowing that if we're part of the body we'll get what we need as well that's the way these things work he says it's hard to always to be always a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne he says it'll be worth it all then and then he say he gives the words from when the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there see here we see a very different hierarchy from this world where those that are Kings serve and those that are citizens are served that's the kingship we're under that's the kingdom we're under that's the Dominion that we have in our lives amen that's why I said we need to recognize our role as priests first is because priests are always there for the other person they've been taken care of they've been anointed they've got the blood for themselves they're clean and so what they're doing is being concerned about everybody else now and so you take that nature now into a king and what do you do is you serve as king you do it for the benefit of the body you do it for the benefit of the Kingdom not just yourself brother says this he says we are Kings spiritual Kings oh we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive what abundance of Grace he says and of the gift of righteousness shall that shall means Contin continuously on and on into eternity they shall continuously reign in life by one Jesus Christ he says and in Colossians 1:13 it says who had delivered us from the power of darkness and had translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son he says right now we reign with Christ now we're talking about kingdoms now we're moving into dominions he says having dominion over what sin the World the Flesh and the devil now sin wants to be in you the world is outside of you the flesh is with you and the devil's trying to get in as well so 3/4 of this is internal amen three4 of it is internal why are we looking so much outside let's have the the the real Dominion inside of us that we're supposed to have to he says right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the world the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure remember we said before we can be Kings we've got to have a king over us he says yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we keep hearing those words dominion and I want to talk about that for the last bit of this service this morning because we know that we are part of a dominion and we have dominion and so we look at that word dominion and that word dominion is an amazing word because it means supreme authority not just Authority supreme authority sovereignty and absolute ownership supreme authority sovereignty and absolute ownership I want you to understand and this is where we're going to finish this morning is on this Dominion because we're going to be we're going to be speaking a while on this even in the coming services I know even as we move past this one he says Dominion is supreme authority that means there's nothing higher I like Authority but what's better than that is supreme authority King of Kings Lord of lords that's what is in our lives that's the Dominion that we have supreme authority nothing higher when you're in Supreme author Authority you are the top of the food chain everything bows before you nothing can defeat you nothing can control you nothing can hold you nothing can harm you you are in supreme authority they can try they can try and trap they can try and entice they can attack they can do all these things but in supreme authority nothing can defeat you nothing can override you he says Dominion is also sovereignty that means we are self-governed what that means means is we cannot be influenced by something outside of us what that means is we better have the right thing inside of us because we are self-governed and if I am self-governed by my own will and by my own thoughts I'm lost that's our natural condition but what happens is that we can bring ourselves now into the self-control of the Holy Spirit by the new birth and now we live a life by the word and that's what we're looking for amen and under that sovereignty you don't have to obey anything that is contrary to the word of God you don't have to accept anything that is contrary to the word of God you don't have to believe anything that is contrary to the word of God you don't even have to listen to it church you can walk away because you are self-governed by the Holy Spirit doesn't mean there's not a battle doesn't mean we don't have to develop character through our trials and testing we know those things doesn't mean we won't struggle doesn't mean there isn't a battle but it means that we will win sin shall not have dominion shall not have dominion Dominion is absolute ownership you know what it means when you have absolute ownership we don't have this in Canada because we there there are elements of everything we own is Crown Land and so we really only own the top I don't know what it is it goes down a certain level of feet but everything below us still belongs to the crown they have mineral rights they have water rights to everything in the properties that we own but in in the United States they have a deed they can get an abstract title deed and what they own is everything above and everything below their property and when you have a a title deed when you have absolute property ownership you have property rights and so nobody can come on your property without your permission nobody can take anything on your property without your permission nobody can put anything on your property without your permission remember we had that Saga with the land below us where people were coming in and they were ripping around their vehicles and they were leaving drug needles and trash and all sorts of things over there and it was very annoying because they were doing it at all times a day and night but it was also dangerous because our kids go down and the neighborhood children go down there and they play and so I didn't want them down there but I didn't have any property rights but what I did have was land that was next to theirs and so it looked like I had property rights so I bluffed them out and I went up and I pounded in a a sign that said private property no trespassing and you know what it worked and from time to time I go down and I tell tell people you're on private property I didn't say it was mine I said you're on private property and there's a sign that says there no trespassing and you know what they all left praise the Lord a bluff works at times but Satan's been trying to Bluff the bride of Christ hasn't he and we've got to realize that with our Dominion comes absolute ownership of our land anden we have it defined remember we have those walls we have those boundaries that are defined by the word of God and within those boundaries we have property rights we have a right to enforce our Dominion we have a right to hold on to that which has been given to us that for which we have a title deed that for which we have an abstract title deed that says everything in there belongs to me you know if I went if I had property rights on that land below me I would never have hesitated to go down there why because I know that land belongs to me I've got the title deed in my house and when it what happens is I would have called the cops immediately I would have messed around I wouldn't have talked to them yes sure you go down talk just ask them to leave nicely but we had a group of young men that wanted to be resistant to it and so I threatened to call the cops I bluffed them but if I was the true property owner I wouldn't have bluffed I'd have just said the cops are on the way why because when the police get there I'm going to show them my deed and say this is my property they're trespassing I want them off and you know what the cops would have done they'd have told them to get off and they would have said Mr klette do you want to press charges for trespass why I'd have property rights but I'll tell you what if they ever come on my land there will be no hesitation because I've got property rights I have dominion over 15 Smith place that belongs to me and I have rights that are enforceable in that what's he saying when we have the Holy Spirit on our property there are enforceable property rights amen we don't have to accept those things things that try and come on our land people try and dump things on our land we don't have to accept that Satan tries to squat on our land Satan tries to plant something on our land we don't have to accept it we have property rights because we're in a dominion and we have kingship Jesus said this he says in Matthew 12 Jesus knew their thoughts he's talking to the Pharisees now and said unto them every Kingdom divided against itself is brought to Desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand we've seen that in the natural and we've seen that in the spiritual have we not but notice he says if a kingdom is divided against itself it's brought to Desolation it's brought to ruin it has no walls if you're in God's will and I'm in God's will we've got to be able to work together because if we're contrary then we're fighting each other and he says that can't be part of the same Kingdom so if we're fighting that means either you're wrong or I'm wrong or we're both wrong amen let's not put it on the other guy let's sayl are we truly right but he says we can't fight against each other otherwise the kingdom falls apart he says' if Katan Satan casts out Satan he is divided against himself how then shall his kingdom stand how's it going to hold up if he's fighting with himself you ever see that that video of the dog that's scared of his own tail and so he's laying there and his tail starts to wiggle and move and he thinks it's something coming to get him and so what does he do he tries to bite his tail and eventually he gets it and then what does he get a big surprise he was fighting against himself I don't know how a dog gets scared of his tail but it's one of the funniest videos you ever see because he thinks he's fighting something external to him and all of a sudden he comes up and he Chomps down on his own tail and then he realizes that's me I was fighting against myself he says and if by Beelzebub cast out Devils by whom do your children cast them out he says therefore they shall be your judges he says but if I cast out Devils by the spirit of God then the kingdom of God is come unto you he says if the spirit of God is here destroying the works of Satan's kingdom then the Kingdom of Heaven is here already the Kingdom of Heaven is here already what are the works of the spirit to destroy the works of Satan that's the way it works he says or else how can one enter into a strong man's house and spoil his Goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house in other words he's saying you can't defeat something unless you bind it first you can't defeat something unless you're stronger than it it he says the only way that I'm casting out Devils is because what I have is stronger than what it is he says and that's how you know it's the Kingdom of Heaven because Satan's not going to cast himself out but the Kingdom of Heaven is here the holy spirit's here to cast those things out he says he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad amen there's only two forces in the world Christ the word and everything else and you know what everything else is trying to paint itself to be different from that guy next to them that church next next to them that political party next to them that country next to them everybody's trying to make themselves different to appeal but Christ just stands there and he never changes the word never changes and it's him and then it's everything else amen he says listen you're either with me or he says you're against me even if you're sitting on the sidelines you're against me because you're not helping and anything that's not helping is a dead weight and it's going to hold back the kingdom there's no neutrality with God you're not going to get to heaven because you didn't choose not choosing is a choice not choosing is a choice we've got to make a choice and it's got to be that amen so we've got to be about the father's business a son and daughter of God's no good sitting on a couch or just sitting in a Pew we've got to be about what God has for us otherwise we're wasting his resources brother Brown would say this he says when he was on Earth Adam's race had many fears he says and it's true they still have them but they shouldn't have have them we're talking about Dominion now we're talking about property rights we're talking about absolute Authority he says Christ won once for all at Calvary when he was here on Earth he walked up to a sick man that sickness had bound the human race and he said thou Spirit of the devil I charge thee come out of the man he conquered the devil when a man lay in the grave dead he conquered death for the man or the sickness when the maniac came out to destroy him and the maniac realized he was the son of God he said to him oh if you'll cast us out suffer us to go in that bunch of H for he knew the authority that Jesus Christ had amen we're talking about Dominion he says he conquered the devil everywhere he met them he conquered the devil everywhere he met him he says and he not only conquered in himself he says but he left the commission to the church that anything you ask in my name that I will do talking about stepping up we're talking about Dominion this morning kingship he says fight with what's in your hands look at shamgar 600 Philistines coming his way fully armored modern weapons trained men and what does he beat them with whatever God put in his hand an ox go that's it why because it's the supernatural it's not the natural amen what he gives us is what he fights with we fight with watch what brother Braham says here Church see the Simplicity of where you can gain your Victory he says fight with what's in your hands if it's singing sing The Gospel we got some wonderful singers in here we got people that like to worship you know what let's take it out of the church and let's start putting it in our day-to-day lives start singing I can't tell you church I'm not one of those great singers but I love to sing I was talking with with with some people the other day and we were listening to some different music and you know these people with amazing amazing voices and and they can just spiral the notes and they can flutter and they can it's amazing and I said I long to do that in my worship but I don't have the voice for it I I I've got a struggle to just hit the notes and and stay in tuned my voice cracks when I try and go any higher it it break the service but there's something in me that long to worship the way that they can do with their voices he says if it's singing sing The Gospel sing in your home I hear my daughter singing constantly downstairs in her room praise the Lord praise the Lord why because it sets an atmosphere it sets an atmosphere for us to receive and then go do he says if you can't do nothing but whistle whistle just as loud as you can for the glory of God if you can't do no more then Pat your hands he says Pat them conquer with whatever you got in your hand he says clap them in such a way till all the neighbors will love you whistle in such a way that all denominations will know that you belong to Christ he says conquer them play the game fair play it right what by the spirit he says we're living in a day that when this social gospel is becoming predominant and ain't that the truth like I said I you know in the in the last 6 or eight months I've listened to many services across many types of churches and the vast majority is a social gospel and it's a shame because there's no power in it no power in it he says it's becoming predominated when the churches are uniting themselves together and making a social religion and binding themselves together he says it's a terrible day why cuz it's all under the curse of death because when the Holy Spirit left death entered life is in the Holy Ghost and without the Holy Ghost there death is all that can come out of it and so it's just man's ideas on top of man's ideas on top of man's ideas but I want to close on this thought of dominion today because today we've got people that are asking us for Dominion aren't we we've got politicians saying give me power and I'll make everything right I'll make everything good I'll undo everything I'll change your life I'll turn Canada I'll turn New Finland into a Utopia just give me Dominion let me have the power to make decisions let me have the power to manage the economy let me have the power to manage Commerce let me have power and dominion and I'll make it good for everybody and you know what we do we vote in the person that's going to make our lives the easiest and what did they do make it worse every single time we're getting into more and more debt our social services are falling apart our Medical Systems falling apart housing spiraling out of control in terms of cost everything is it's almost impossible to make a living off of single income unless you live like we do which is simply thank God we can live but they have destroyed this world and yet they say give me dominion and I'll I'll fix it there's no fixing it it's under a curse and the curse is me and you without the Holy Ghost that's all they're left with then we have Ministries and churches and they say give me your money give me your support and I'll take back Canada I'll take back newf land I'll take back St John's can't do it church it's already cursed we're not here to take back this Kingdom we're here for souls and it's just going to be one here and one here and one here and one there it's all through scripture it's just a little bit in everyone nothing's coming back to God except those little few predestinated seeds that's it the rest is just religious system and you'll you'll absolutely bring them to your religious system but you won't bring them to Christ Paul had 12 people in his church in Ephesus the Ephesian church was the greatest Church of all of them greatest of all of them remember Ephesians types Joshua and there you see that these are a special people that's where you see the full mystery revealed it's where you see the full blessings the full grace of God on them they were the most mature believer in the old test in the New Testament and it was Paul's own church and he only had 12 Paul has 12 what hope do the rest of us have why cuz it's just a select elect few we're not taking back this world we're not taking back this country we're not taking back this province or this city or even this little Community we're not taking it back we're getting out of here that's what we're focused on yeah there's only one hope and that's Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's a living God it's an everpresent God I was counseling somebody a while ago and I said listen I've only got one remedy for you and that's Jesus Christ give your life to him and it'll take care of your situation I I said it won't change your situation it'll change how you go through your situation because what they don't they don't need a situation change they need an inner man change an inner woman change whatever that might be I said give your life to him and it'll take care of everything you're looking for we're a broken record we are a broken record come to Christ or perish that's the only thing we have to offer is Christ the word amen but what happens what people want to go in between what did Joshua say choose you this day make a clear decision draw the line and step one way or the other but don't live in the middle because that's the most miserable place you can be is on the line neither in nor out committed uncommitted no no no get in or get out be hot or be cold make a choice but what happens when we do that we make that choice and we step into the Dominion of Christ we get the benefits in the power of His domain now his Dominion his kingdom his power his Spirit brother Bram says this and we're going to close he says symptoms are something like say tomorrow when you go home now to your place the express agent will come up and say are you Mrs doe yes I have a present for you all right what is it he hands over a box and you hear something hitting in that box and you're looking it it's a big box of snakes rattlesnakes he says 'well you don't want them things well you say I don't want them he says oh but they're yours somebody sent them to you here's your name here's a name it's somebody sent the snakes to you they're yours you have to take them we're talking about Dominion he says now in one sense of the word they're yours and in another sense they're not how are they yours your names on them but remember when you're under a kingdom it's not your name it's the king's name amen I am no longer Jonathan klet I am Christ I'm a Christian so my name I don't have to accept things in because I do all things in his name he says in one sense they're yours and another they're not somebody sent them to you but they're not yours until you sign for them that you've received them he says and when you sign that you've received them then they're yours but if you refuse to sign for them he has to take them back to the express company and the express company has to send them back to the one them sent them to you he says is that right amen when they come up to your door and they hand you a package if you say I didn't order this and I don't want it they have to take it back you don't have to assign you don't have to sign for it you don't have to accept it he says well don't sign for nothing the devil brought he says no sir just refuse to have it no sir say I just haven't got it devil you take it all back that's all I won't have it refuse to have your sickness your arthritis whatever it is I just haven't got it by his Stripes I'm Healed he says stand right on your ground you've got to stand and know that it is your ground you're on then he says confess it what we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony our words matter don't say it in your head Church don't say it in your head say it out loud and I don't care who hears you say this does not belong to me Satan take it back you have to talk to him you have to command him you'll never see Jesus praying in his mind to Satan having a conversation with Satan in his mind he speaks the word we have to confess it we have to believe it and then what do we do stay there and say uh-uh no this is my property this is my life you're not allowed here you're not a part of this Kingdom he says stay there God will bring it to pass immediately no God will bring it to pass his word never fails he says no matter what it is just believe him now I want you to see what this looks like because so often what we're looking for and this is our human the human elements of us is we're thinking that the sickness will come and great faith will rise up and it never comes on us at all what that's what we're looking for we're looking for a future realm or a future power or situation where we just refuse it upfront and nothing comes on us but that is not what the scripture promises it says we will get sick but if we pray the prayer of faith we will recover if we cast out Devils they will leave but listen brother bradam prayed for John Ry and it took two weeks for him to get healed of his truly healed in terms of the manifestation of his eyes he was blind and brother Bram he came to brother Bram the next day and he couldn't see he said I thought you said I was healed he said I thought you said you believed so often what we're saying is where is God and God's saying where are the Believers where are those that will accept it confess it and believe it and stay there amen but I want you to see what this looks like because as many of you know my sister atanta she was healed of uh of stage four Hodgkins lymphoma back in 2018 but she gave a testimony and and brother John Andes has taken them taken it and put it into words of what she was going through and and kind of what that process was because remember Satan sent her a box of cancer and he sent him with an x-ray that said you've got cancer now she can't deny that the B what's in the box but she can deny that ain't for me amen remember brother Bram says it's yours but it's not really yours she said this isn't for me why because his word says by his stripes I'm Healed catch this these are her own words and this is what she says right after they got the diagnosis okay she has a 7 cm uh tumor on her right side she's got Hodgkins lymphoma spread all throughout her lungs and into her nodes and these different things she says these are her words exact words while this was a great shock I began to look to God for comfort and healing and we encouraged our family to do the same church I'm not running around looking for healing until I need healing amen but when the need arises then the faith has to come with it the word has to raise up a standard she says and we encouraged our family to do the same we made what a conscious decision not to fear we have to choose we have to decide how things are going to go he says and the bad she says we made a conscious decision to fear not to fear and the battle was on okay the lines are drawn you're not allowed to come on and he's trying to push in she said I experienced many wonderful moments in the Lord in that battle Church we're talking about real life now she says I experienced many dark moments during that time I lost more weight getting down to 95 PBS Church there's there's the box of rattlesnakes you've got cancer you're losing weight you're losing the battle and what is she doing Satan's trying to bully her into taking it many of you know my sister she's just a little thing the wind blows and she falls over and now she's getting lighter and lighter and it looks like 's winning watch the process now see we see us moving back or getting weak and we think I don't have it no resist the devil resist power is not yours the resistance is yours he only said resist I can't move Satan for anything but I can resist him with everything I've got and then I can trust in the ever loving hands of God watch this what did they do there they decided on their mindset and they stuck with it I shall not fear why because we have a spirit that casts out all fear perfect love cast it out we haven't received a spirit again to fear as we read earlier catch this I was strengthened oh I was strengthened by the love and the scriptural encouragement shown to me at that time and I looked to God for healing what would she doing reminding herself who she was and who her daddy was she says it immediately no no no it gradually became real to me that God truly is a Healer how do you know God's a provider church he provides how do you know God's A Healer you get sick and he heals how do you know that he's a guide you lose your way and he shows you the way I gradually it gradually became real to me that God truly is a Healer that he took stripes on his back the day he went to Calvary for my healing she says I began to believe his promises you know my sister she's a holy ghost filled stable well-founded Christian I don't think anybody would deny it but she had to come up higher she had to step up because what the battle was raging I began why she' never had to believe like this she' never had to believe like this she had never faced something that she couldn't deal with with some aspirin or some penicillin or something basic doctoral work even she says I began to believe his promises and I began to even look for a super natural intervention what's she doing she's resisting she's pushing back she's feeding the inner woman and she began to have faith which means she didn't have it in the first place what it's growing inside of her it's the spirit of God raising up a standard what did she do Church she made up her mind it's de Deliverance or nothing it's healing or it's nothing see Satan will keep us right in that land of compromise live with it I'll reduce the impact I'll let you live a little while no no no it's victory or it's death it's all the way or it's no way that's what the word says total Victory when they went into the land of Canaan what did they say what did God say kill them every everyone let nothing live and you know what Israel did and we'll get into this in the next couple of services is they went in there and they said we're going to make it work for us we're going to let you live and we're going to let you generate wealth for us and we'll just take a tax we'll take a tithe we'll take whatever it is and we'll benefit from you and you know what happened is those people got stronger and stronger then God used them against the Israelites when they fell out of favor kill it God's solution is always total Destruction of Satan's kingdom so she's pushing back and she's beginning and she's beginning and then what happens we've all seen the the video of her in that service when they saying um leaning was it leaning on the Everlasting Arms right and she danced around that church in Victory and I think it was the next day or two she went to the doctors she said to the astonishment of my doc of the doctor all traces of cancer were gone including the 7 cm tumor in my lung over 4 years later I'm still giving glory to God for his wonderful Healing Touch 6 years now let's Stand Together Church you look at that picture there's no compromise this isn't a partial Victory this is a total Deliverance why because she has Dominion she has property rights she has a god of supreme authority living inside of her and she didn't realize how great that God was until this battle see so often like I said before we say I don't have a choice and we go the way of compromise but God saying I want to give you total Victory I want to give you total Deliverance I want to give you total provision but you got to back away from your compromise you've got to say I am determined that this is what will Happ the preeminence in my life amen I said it last service church and I'm going to keep saying it how important is it to have the Holy Ghost not just on you in you it is life it is peace it is Joy it's provision it's victory it's Deliverance it's rest it's satisfaction it's contentment all of those things are those attributes and that's the dunamis we are talking about it's the literal attributes of Christ now coming into you and enforcing his dominion over your own life and so if we've got it if we've got it are we letting it have dominion and this is the great question isn't it does it have dominion does it truly have dominion see we want it for our bodies we want it for our lives we want it for our family but the thing is it's got to have full dominion over me it's got to have full dominion over you and when that happens you'll find the rest Falls right into place that's what happened on the day of Pentecost was they finally got out of their own way and the Holy Spirit walked down those stairs and it converted 3,000 people in 10 minutes when we let go when we let God have his way in our lives let him set up his kingdom here then he makes us a king to those that are around us that would come to us for help that we can pray that we can expect that we can believe in a supernatural expectation for the events that we're facing in our lives amen without it we're a city Without Walls and anything can come in and out but when that Holy Spirit takes up residence it builds Walls by the word and all of a sudden we're a city sit on a hill where a light that can't be hidden we're Overcomers we're more than Overcomers amen we're the Victorious Church of the bride of Christ we're healed we're everything that he is the very attributes of God are resting inside of us and it's for a people that will let it have dominion in their own lives first amen we still have battles we still have battles amen we still fight we still struggle we have the dayby day one with the Flesh and the question is who has dominion over our flesh today because if he's got it in our heart if he's got it in our mind if he's got it in our soul then what happens is the flesh will become subject to the Dominion that's inside of that and it'll bring about every promise of God that He gave us by his word amen we've got to realize our position that that Dominion comes with absolute Authority sovereignty and property rights that we can say Satan you have no place in my life and when he tries to send you a package when he tries to set up camp when he tries to squat on your land you can say you've got to go because you're not a part of this title deed you're not a part of this Kingdom and therefore you can't be here and what happens is the authority of the Holy Spirit comes behind you to push him out of our Lives amen look at that look at that simple housewife simple mother that took God at his word it took two months but she took God at his word and what happened is he came down and he Vindicated his word in her body to prove he's alive and well and that when we give him Dominion that he'll hold nothing good from us and that every attribute of his spirit and his nature is available for the bride for her day-to-day walk amen you want that do you want that do you want every bit that he has for you that's the desire I believe of every every true son and daughter's heart is Lord I want more of you I want everything you have for me and it comes with that then desire to lay down everything else amen the first thing we've got to overcome the greatest enemy is this inner man if we can surrender that God just can flow through US amen that's my desire amen I want him to be king of me before I can ever be king of anything else amen let's pray our heads Heavenly Father Lord what beautiful words we've read this morning Lord that when you take up Dominion in our lives Lord nothing can stand before us Lord your word says one of us will chase a thousand but we've got to be found under your kingship not by word not just by talking about it Lord but we've got to be there by decision by a willing heart a surrendered heart a humble Heart Lord God and Lord we see in your word there's lots of room to step up Lord I lift my hands this morning Lord I say help me to step up Lord not me but the Christ Within Me Lord that the Holy Spirit Lord would just have such absolute pre Ence in my life Lord in the lives of those that are listening in this very service Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would have free reign in our hearts Lord that as we surrender Lord those loads would lighten Lord those sicknesses would disappear those worries those stresses would let go Lord and that we' be Lord experience the blessing of God in the land of the living Lord you're not a god of the Dead you're a God of the living and Lord we're here this morning saying Lord make a change in me Lord make a change in the brothers and sisters that are here Lord we pray Lord have dominion over us Lord that we could bring your Dominion to others Lord draw them into the kingdom where you are king of kings and Lord of lords we pray Lord I pray for sister Kimberly at home with those two sick babies this morning Lord I pray that the power of your Holy Spirit would even go now Lord that it would touch those two young boys Lord that it would bring relief and healing Lord that they would testify of your goodness this morning Lord let us not take no for an answer Lord let us not compromise on our position Lord but let us hold fast to that which you've shown us Lord to The Inheritance that you prepare for us from the foundation of the world Lord that we' not let go of any of it Lord raise up a standard Lord I pray in pray you pour in more of your spirit grant us Grace Lord to look to you for all these things Lord to believe it to accept it to confess it Lord and to stay there right with it until you bring it to pass in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen he's my Lord 597 he's my Lord there is no other one who can come the storms of life like my Lord and he gives rest to the wey gives new life to the
