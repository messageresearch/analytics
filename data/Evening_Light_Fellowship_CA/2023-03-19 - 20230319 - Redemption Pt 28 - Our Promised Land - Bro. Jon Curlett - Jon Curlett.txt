just keep marching forward Heavenly Father Lord looking to the end of the of the road Lord to that Eternal Victory Lord that we have in you nor would you just draw us up a little higher this morning heavenly father would you bless us with your presence Lord and by the going forth of your word we pray Lord minister to hearts and souls remembering those Lord many not here this morning Lord my family brother Chad sister Leah Lord Brother Gerald sister Betty Lord the different ones Lord we pray your mercy and Grace to them each one Lord and bless us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen may God bless you if you turn in the scriptures to Galatians 3 this morning amen I thought I heard brother Ellie's voice out there and sure enough when I came out there he is so it's good to see him amen God bless you amen I know there's many await today and sick and traveling and whatnot but uh good to have us all back in the service this morning amen and then Galatians chapter 3 and we'll start at verse 26 Galatians 3 and 26. for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there's neither there's neither Jew nor Greek there's neither Bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be Christ then are ye Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we are continuing our series on Redemption this morning and we're kind of getting to the to the end as we start to cross over into Canaan so to speak and we've got a little ways to go and we'll be talking about things like adoption and overcoming power in a Victorious Life and these different things but these are all kind of part and parcel of what's inside of what that promised land is and what it represents for the believer what we want to realize in all of this is that we're going back to what belongs to us that's what this is all about is we're painting a picture of what it means to not just be a believer but what it means to have what a Believer has and to experience the reality that it is to be a believer so I want to kind of springboard off the last serve person take a last time we spoke of of your your land of promise and then today I'm going to say our promised land so I want to bring it to where we are in this age and in this time and and I will read some quotes this morning but I want to preach it out of the scriptures this morning to really set a scripture balance for it so that we know that we're not just just taking the words of a man so to speak but we're basing it on the word of God Amen and we've spoken at length of how Redemption takes you out of something and it's a wonderful thing and so many people stop just at the taking out and they get that freedom and justification and and under their their sins are under the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary and and the guilt is stripped away and they say that's good I'm I'm happy with that and they go out and they live the exact same life they've always lived but without the guilt but that's not what God that's not what the full Redemption process looks like and we know there was the desert portion that's a time of Separation that's a time of sanctification it's a time of taking you away from the things that have affected you for so long but again that's not the end of redemption but as we start to now come up to Jordan and to cross over to Canaan now we're getting into what it means to be redeemed because now we're getting back to where we belong we're getting back to the position that we were promised in the first place we're getting back to relationship and all these things and that's the fullness of redemption and the day of our Redemption will never happen on this Earth the Redemption happens when we cross over to the other side to that marriage supper of the lamb but everything here is building up to that climax which is the rapture and it is the resurrection and that's really the proof of of who is redeemed and who is truly a child of God and who isn't amen but Redemption is always always always about taking you back to where you belong so if you stop along the way you can't be Redemption and then you've got to keep going until you get to where you were in the beginning amen redemptions of restoration process that puts you back to your original position and when he gets you into your position then you have possession of all the things that come with that position but he's got to get you into your original position and that's easy for us to forget as Christians because so often what we really seek are the benefits you know we're sitting here and and we're sick and so we desire healing we have needs and so we desire provision and and we have problems and so we we seek deliverance and we start to seek after those things but what we need to really recognize is who we are and if we recognize who we are then we'll recognize and have the benefits that come with who we are this morning amen if we're put in our proper position then the possessions will follow but if you're not in your right position then all you are is a gold digger you know like you're seeking after God for the things that he has amen rather than who you are in him and so you've got to recognize who you are so what that means to me as a Believer right now is that the greatest thing I need is a revelation of who I am that's what I need to know is who I am in Christ in the context of God not in the context of whom my father or my mother is or what Ministry I was raised under or where I live or what my job is but who I am in Christ is the greatest Revelation that I have in need of this morning amen I don't need a revelation of healing if I don't have a revelation that healing is for me you've got to be able to read this Bible and say this is speaking to me and this is speaking of me and therefore based on that I am a child of God and therefore I have all that the Bible says that I have but if you don't believe that that Bible is talking about you you'll never get healing you'll never get Deliverance you'll never get provisioned because you don't realize it's talking to you and you'll read the Bible until you're blue in the face and it won't have any effect on you but as soon as you realize I am a child of God and it is talking to me and it is speaking of me now you can start to say what this is mine and this is me and now you can start to take possession of these things but as I was studying that because I I know there's more for us I know there's more for me I believe there's more in in Christ than what we have here today and that's not to put down what we have but it's to say let's keep moving forward and if I'm going to keep forward moving forward what is it that's going to draw me into that what is it that's going to bring me into a greater revelation of who I am in Christ and I ask myself that question I think we need to ask ourselves that question is what is it that's drawing us forward or what is it that's holding us back because I want to be moving forward every day I want to be moving forward if it's only one step I want to move forward every day and I went back and brother Branham says this he says you know there's something about getting a loan to yourself it's one of the hardest things to do today especially speaking to to our couples that have children the hardest thing to do is get time alone he says many people never pray until they come to church many people think that the only place to pray is at church but the Bible said for men to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands and then when we get by ourself we'll usually pray different than what we would if we prayed in church it's the secret prayer that Jesus spoke of saying enter ye into a secret closet and close the door and when you have done so pray to your father who sees in secret then he that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly we have to have a place where we can pray in secret and it's just us and him he says and when we're praying like that there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out of it because what you don't have to have a facade with God because if you know he's there you know he sees right through it he sees right through everything that we throw up every every bit of spirituality that that we posture in front of him he sees through it and he sees right to the heart and he sees right through to the nature and the motives and the objectives and you'll never that it'll be like you're praying with a with a brass ceiling above you if you go in there and you try and posture in front of God but brother bam says when you get there and you really start talking to God it takes the hypocrisy out of it you don't pretend what you're not anymore you're just stripped down to who you are and you break down and you say Lord here I am again and I'm in need and I'm looking for more and I have need of more and I need answers and I need leadership and I need guidance and all of a sudden you stop pretending that you have all the answers and you start to realize you're in the presence of the one that has the answers and that's where your need is going to be supplied he says it seems like that we get a better connection with God to get alone and there's been many times in my life whereas perhaps in your life that you just have to get alone once in a while with Jesus and I this is a cut down quote I hope you don't mind because he talked about I'll get out in the mountains he says and they think I'm going to hunt he says but I'm going out there to get alone with God to get away from it all he says and then you just have to sometimes sit out there on a rock and just talk to him he says oh for those precious hours alone with God and it's there that when the greatest Revelation and inspiration comes is when we're alone with God you say brother John that ought to be under the preaching of the word hey there's a lot happens in services and you've got to be sitting under the preaching of the word but you've got to have your time alone with God as well where he can work with you as an individual he says the greatest Revelation and inspiration comes when we're alone with God we take more time on that I'm sure that we would live a better life a more Victorious Life In Christ so real prayer time matters Church now that this is down where you live soft this is simple but you know what I love about simple it's doable it's doable you know what we do so many times is we do three amazing things a year and expect it to have this great impact and guess what it doesn't and it won't that's what happens with people that'll go to two or three camps of special means a year and that's supposed to sustain their spirituality and their walk with Christ for the year it will not work it is the habitual life of the believer in constant communion with Christ that will give you the overcoming power that you seek that'll give you the direction that will give you the leadership in your life we duck away from the little thing every day and then we try and do the amazing thing once or twice or three times a year that's never going to work it's never going to work that has to be a daily thing that we're doing amen brother Brown says Oh how we need Revelation by the spirit we don't need a new Bible we don't need a new translation though some of them are very good and I'm not against them but we need the revelation of the spirit and thank God we can have what we need what is your need this morning he says you can have we can have what we need for God wants to reveal his word to us by his Spirit God's wanting to reveal himself to us he wants to do it so the only thing that will hold it back is you that's the only thing brother Bob said God wants to heal you more than you want to be healed God wants to bless you more than he you want to be blessed God is just waiting to pour it out upon his people that will call on his name and ask for it he says God wants to reveal his word to us by his Spirit may God begin to give his Spirit to do what to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing Revelation all if the church could only get a fresh Revelation and become by it the Living Word manifested we would do the Greater Works and glorify Our God in heaven oh I love that continuous life-giving and prevailing Revelation I need more continuous I need a day in and a day out not an ups and not a Downs not a back and not a fourth but just straight as an arrow I'm going through every single day that's what I'm seeking in my life day in and day out more of it if I take one step today tomorrow I want two steps and the next day I want three steps and building and growing and building momentum where Satan can hold me back where Satan can't hold you back where you're pressing forward continuously what is it it's life-giving and prevailing Revelation overcoming power not being held back by circumstances not being held back by by the symptoms that we face in our life amen but it's a winning believer day in and day out amen we're talking about our promised land this morning I want to Anchor this in because everything here you can do everything you can accept him as your savior you can walk through the desert you can go through justification justification sanctification but if you don't go into the promised land you fall short of the grace of God the full grace of God if I can put it because it's three works of Grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit but if you only do the first two you fall short of his grace his grace doesn't fall short you fall short of it because you won't go all the way brother Brown says that's the problem is that they always turn back I don't want to be one of those that turn back amen we're not scripture says we are not of them that turn back indeed amen so I don't want to scare you this morning and say you're not going to make it I'm saying keep pressing keep pushing keep walking keep crying out keep praying keep expecting keep looking to God for these things amen keep believing I'm going to open up again with our original scripture in Galatians 3 it says for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus now I want you to recognize one thing because we're talking about our promised land and we know it's an inheritance and we'll get into that a little later it's an inheritance and you don't get an inheritance because of what you do you get an inheritance Because of Who You Are that is what we have to realize and that's why I was talking about that need for a greater revelation of who we are in Christ because if our inheritance is in him we need to recognize who we are and recognize that what we have is because of what who our parents are who our parent is not because of what we do listen I do believe that most parents are wise and if they set up a will so that when they die then certain kids get certain things guess what they give more to the good kids because the good kids can handle it and the not so good kids usually have some restrictions or they get a little less and guess what it's no different with Christians some bring full 34 some 60 foot some 100 full right God gives things to the ones that he can trust more but etch each and every child of God has an inheritance each and everyone has an inheritance and it's it's really up to us how much we'll limit those things I think but we have an inheritance from our natural parents not because of what we've done but because of what they've done because they put in the sweat they put in the blood they put in the tears and that's what Christ did for us is he did the work to get what an inheritance for us so what we get is not because of what we're done we've done or what we're going to do but it's because of what has already been done a work that's already been done and it's been set aside for us and we just have to step into it amen and Paul's saying here what look at who your daddy is because if you recognize who your father is if you recognize who your dad is you'll recognize what sort of an inheritance you're supposed to be looking for amen why because Godly Cho the children of God get what a Godly inheritance so don't go looking around this world for your inheritance that's not it our attorneys our inheritance comes from Eternal God so it's going to be an eternal inheritance our our inheritance comes from a supernatural God so it's going to be a supernatural inheritance so we don't preach a gospel of wealth and great things in this world but we what we seek a city that is to come because that's where the fullness of our inheritance is and brother Brown will go over on the other side and his inheritance was what those that he saved those that he brought to Christ that was his inheritance all that loved you and all you ever loved will be there that was his inheritance and he says there was Millions Millions over there that he was going to what introduced to God that he was gonna he was going to bring us his representation as his his sacrifice amen listen all of it he says here starts with faith in Christ Jesus and each and every one of us that's the confession of the Believers that I am doing this by faith in the finished work of calvary that's the starting point for every single one of us there is no other starting place but Calvary it has to be there it doesn't start with the message of the hour that's not it you've skipped you've skipped to the end you skip to what the holy spirit will lead you into and you make that your Calvary you will not make it because it's an idol then you've got to start at Calvary you've got to repent you've got to get down confess your sins and what accept the finished work of Calvary and then after that everything will follow that he promised amen listen our part is to confess that Faith but that is not the finish and that is not what makes us children of God because there are millions and millions professing Believers that have knelt there at an altar or maybe stood in their seat and prayed a sinner's prayer and they took that finished work of Calvary and they stopped there and there are no more children of God than Esau was it's the truth remember Jacob and Esau came from the same family but only one of them was a child of God why because only one of them would do what the word said to do but watch this sequence because this is a this is pointing us back to what it looks like uh in our promised land and it's our inheritance he says in verse 27 for as many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on Christ now we see there's a baptism but this is not a water baptism right he says we're baptizing to Christ but we'll see that there's a specific baptism that's required verse 28 says for there's neither June or Greek there's neither Bond nor free there's neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus uh I was talking to my wife about this I says we have a true Multicultural church now we have all colors we have all ages we have people from every region we've got the whole thing and the beautiful thing about this scripture is it says every one of us is the same every one of us is a part of the body of Christ there is no limitation in Christ because you're a woman or because you're a man because you're a boy or a girl because you're black or white or yellow or purple or whatever your color might be whatever your socioeconomic background is it's a big word for us this morning how much money you have how good your parents are or weren't none of that matters in this we are all one in Christ he says and if if ye be Christ then he ye are ye Abraham's seat and heirs according to the promise this is the key to the whole thing because Paul is tying us back to Abraham's promise and he's saying you're what you're in line with Abraham you have the same you're from Abraham's seed you have the same nature as Abraham you have the same way to receive it as Abraham did and if you are in Christ then you are one of Abraham's seed and there's an inheritance that's waiting for you amen because remember Israel got caught up in who their dad was naturally speaking and they forgot about the God behind them and so they focused on the natural and they focused on the land and all they wanted was the land now they wanted was the land and they forgot that Abraham was chosen by God's election Abraham was chosen by election Abraham was walking around I believe brother Brown said he was packing Idols in these different things he was just like everyone else and then God came down sovereignly and he picked out Abraham and then by faith Abraham acted on God's choice if I could put it that way God chose him and then by faith Abraham responded to it God chose Abraham and he spoke to Abraham and called him out and Abraham had an opportunity to act in faith and he did and that's what proved what was inside of Abraham that he was a child of God it was that there was Faith there to receive the word of God and act on it now we notice Abraham did not act perfectly but he acted he started down the road but God was going to take him to where he would have a perfect walk where he would do exactly what God had told him to do it's the same thing we have today and we can sit here and we can say I'm raised in a in a Christian home and I'm raised around the message therefore I am a child of God no I'm not saying you're not I'm saying how you respond to what is preached to you how you respond to the word is what proves what's inside of you not where you're born or who you're born into that is not what's going to happen like I said Jacob and Esau were were raised in the same family and early on we could maybe say that Esau was a better guy than Jacob because Jacob was a shyster remember Jacob was a cheater he was a manipulator Esau was what he was but at least he didn't pretend to be otherwise but Jacob always had an inclination towards the things of God but he always tried to get it on his own was the problem and God had to take that out of him but his inclination was towards that and over time Jacob finally surrendered and he finally started letting God have a hand in his life instead of trying to make it all happen on his own and that's when we see when we're children is when we will not only humble ourselves to the world but we'll take to the word rather but then we'll take take our hands off of it and say Lord my life is in your hands and that's what Jacob had to do he came to the point where he knew he couldn't save his own life and so he had to step fully into God Amen but Paul says here that you are heirs according to the promise now the thing is when we look at Abraham's life and we look at what God Said to Abraham there were many promises given to Abraham it wasn't just one but it was three and four and depending on where you look at these things amen so but we see that Abraham's seed natural Israel they only cared about one thing and that was the land they wanted the land the land the land and they forgot about the big promise so let's go back to what God Said to Abraham in the beginning in Genesis 12. now this is him calling him out this is this is the first time that Abraham as God speak to him he says now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee now I want you to catch something here he didn't say unto a land that I will give thee he said unto a land that I will show thee he says go where I tell you to go there was no promise of land he says and I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing so here's the blessing here's the promise he'll be a great nation he'll be blessed he'll have a great reputation and he'll be a blessing to others as well and in verse 3 says and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed this is the final portion of the blessing he says the entire world is going to be blessed Because of You Abraham so this couldn't be a promise that was fulfilled only by Israel it couldn't just be Israel because all he said all the nations the whole world is going to be blessed so it couldn't just be focused on Israel this was a global blessing and a global impact that Abraham was going to have so the Israel and Israel in the land was not the fulfill them fulfillment of the abrahamic Covenant it couldn't be because it had to bless the entire world Amen now we know later that God promises Canaan to Abraham and Promises to bring his descendants back to the land and that was a big part of Israel's identity but that was not supposed to be the great part that was not supposed to be the big part of it amen but this was just a type because we know this the Bible and all of its stories is about Redemption it's a book of redemption so him bringing Israel back to a place where Abraham walked was a Redemption story but it was a type of the bigger picture of what he was doing with the entire world Amen like we said it's not just about possession of land but it's about position it's relationship it's communion it's about restoration of what we had in Eden and sorry to say but Israel the land of Israel is not Eden it never was Eden and yet they treated it as Eden and all they cared about was the land the land the land and they forgot the God that was giving them the land now Paul says this earlier in Galatians 3 Verse 6 he says even as Abraham believed God and he was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of Faith the same are the children of Abraham so it's people that are of faith that are related to Abraham it is not the natural lineage but it's the spiritual lineage those that have faith to take the promises of God and live by them it says in verse 8 and the scripture foreseen that God would justify the Heathen through faith just like Abraham preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying in these shall All Nations be blessed so in other words the Fulfillment of Abraham's promise was the Gospel coming to the entire world through Christ that was the Fulfillment of the promise amen and it was not only to the Jews but it was to the Gentiles also paulicene verse 9 so then they which be of Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham so in other words if you have the faith of Abraham you get the promise of Abraham if you have the faith of Abraham you get the inheritance of Abraham if you have the faith of Abraham you are identified with him and you have this the access to the same things that Abraham had verse 16 says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made and say he saith not and to seeds as of many he says but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ so we're trying to tie this package together and I preached on this before and and we preached on you know people of the Covenant and these different things or or along those lines I think that's brother Tim's thing but but we preached on the the people of the promise I think or whatever it was but I've covered this before so I'm going to tie it together quickly Lord willing but Paul's saying your children of faith and that's what makes you children of Abraham because he was the man that was righteous by faith you look at Abraham's life and it was not righteous by action all the time Abraham was a very very human man very he would forget so easily the things that God had told them amen but what is what is it that makes Abraham righteous was he received a faith promise and that Faith promise was fulfilled in Christ was a fulfillment of that and so all that are baptized into Christ get the full blessing because that is the Fulfillment of Abraham's inheritance is in Christ we look at Abraham's life and we see him do great things we see him do foolish things but as I was thinking on these things and it drew me to to Genesis 15 which is right after Abraham goes and Slaughters the five Kings remember they came and they battled against Sodom and Gomorrah and they went and they took out lot and his family and they took them captives and the Kings and all these different things so Abraham goes out and he takes his servants 300 plus of them and they go out and they actually destroy those kings and after that the king of Sodom comes to him and he says Abraham you've saved us thank you he says here take everything that we have because if you hadn't come into and saved us we'd have lost it anyway so he says you take the good stuff we'll take our families we'll go back we'll rebuild we'll be okay you take all of this wealth and listen that's not a an unreasonable thing to do and it's not unreasonable for maybe Abraham to take it he's the one that stuck his neck on the line I'm sure he had costs he spent food you know he had to take his servants out he had to keep him going the whole time maybe it'd be reasonable for him to take at least something from it but Abraham says I won't even take a shoelace from you not even a shoelace he says because if I do you will say you've made me wealthy why did Abraham turn it down Abraham turned it down because he didn't want to taint his personal testimony of the provision of God by taking something from an Unholy man he was he was more worried about his testimony than the provision that he may have gotten from that from winning that battle amen and then right after Abraham does that right after he has this great Victory and he he routes an army that he should never been able to do and he makes that conscious decision to turn down that that treasure from those kings that well from the King God walks into his life and look at this conversation he has after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abraham don't worry that you turned down all of this wealth Abram he says I am thy shield and I exceeding great reward Hallelujah I am your reward Abraham what Comfort we can take church when we turn down things that anybody else would have taken for his sake and he comes back and he says I am your reward I I am what's going to give you what you're looking for in the first place that would never have given it to you Abram but I'll give you what you're really seeking I'll give you the reward that you want I'll give you the inheritance that lasts beyond anything that this King could have given you he says what I am thy exceeding great reward can you imagine what an exceeding great reward looks like if I were to give it to you listen we go out and we compete and we work hard and maybe we get employee of the year and they give us a bonus for five thousand dollars or the company does really well and they give us a 20 bonus of our annual salary and we say that's a great reward and it's commensurate with the work we put in maybe if it's a really generous man he he'd write you a huge check that day and you'd say that would be a great reward somebody goes to the Olympics and they spend years and years four years training they come and they win a gold medal and that's the reward they get a gold medal they're the world champion they're the best in the world and we say that's a great reward but God comes to Abraham and he says no no no I'm not just going to give you a reward I'm not just going to give you a grave reward I'm going to give you an exceeding great reward I'm gonna go above and beyond what you can even ask or think I'm going to blow your mind with how great it is that I am for you Abraham that's the kind of God we're serving churches that he goes so much further than we could ever expect amen above and beyond your effort is the reward that you will get that's what he promised to his church Paul says this in Corinthians he says that is as it is written I had not seen nor your hurt neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him that's what God has for us Church in ways we never expect in times we can never expect above and beyond whatever we could we could even think about whatever we've seen it's greater than anything we've seen whatever we've heard it's greater than anything we've heard brother Bradham when he went beyond the curtain of time and he comes back and he says you can't imagine and he says whatever you do don't miss it don't miss it because it's better than we ever imagined oh I was thinking this morning I've been listening to the adoption series and brother Branham is talking about a place of Prayer and we look at how our lives are in this church building and the things we will and won't do in a church building and it struck me that will keep this church building so clean and yet in our life we'll do the little things that we'd never do in church and guess what this isn't the Tabernacle of the Living God this is the Tabernacle of our living God my if we could recognize what's waiting for us he was talking about he says the entire he says somebody can lose our their healing because of what we're doing in our personal life Church how serious is it this morning how serious is it this morning but the promise to Abraham and assib was what was it a promised land no the promise was I am I am not I was not I will be I am the present God today that is what we're looking for that is the continuous life-giving prevailing revelation we need as the I am is with me and he's given himself to me and he's given his word to me and so I can have Victory so I can have overcoming power so I can have my needs met so I can have the leadership and direction that I need in my life amen he is the promise he is the dwelling place he is a rock he is a shadow in a weary land he is our all in all amen that's what we seek amen our promised land is not a what it's a Who that's where our rest is that's where our joy is that's where our peace is that's where our communion is that's where our provision is that's where our food is that's where our water is it is in Christ amen what is it our promised land is that person first and foremost then from that person comes a position in Christ and then from that position in Christ comes the possessions of the promises of the word of God for each and every believer amen Israel all they wanted was a land of promise they wanted Eden again and they completely missed out that there was a person that was supposed to be walking in the midst of their Eden in the cool of the evening every single day and that's what they missed out and time and time again they started doing what was right in their own eyes and they lost that communion and they lost that communion and they lost that communion and when they lost that communion they lost the land every time if they'd have focused on the communion they'd have had the land even today they'd have never lost it they'd have never lost it if they'd stuck with that amen but Abraham got the god of the promise and he got the land and that's what we want we want the God first and get the promises later make sure you've got God in your life make sure you've made him welcome in your life and everything else will fall into place amen listen make no mistake Abraham wanted the blessing Abraham wanted the land and he wanted the promised son but more than anything he wanted the god that made that promise and time and time again Abraham proved Lord you're more important to me even than the life of that promised son even that he says he'll raise him up if he asks me to do it I'll do it because he's got to raise him up because there's a promise in that lineage amen what is it God's the blessing God himself is the blessing that we seek he's the promise that we're seeking but look what happens just before God gives Abraham the promised son in Isaac look at his commission to Abraham look at God's requirement of Abraham it says when Abraham Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect the Holy Ghost hasn't been given yet there's no sacrifice at Calvary yet there is no way to be perfect as we would deem Perfection but yet God says do it do the impossible Abram Church what is perfection Perfection is to do what the word tells you to do to walk as the word does tell you it's it's the Fulfillment of the word of God and Abraham is unable to do it God's saying Abraham have your child and Abram's 99 years old Sarah's 89 years old and God's saying Arab go fulfill the word of the Lord that's what perfectionist is to do what God told you to do because that's all that matters if you do what he tells you to do then everything else doesn't matter that's what he's looking for is the children that will obey him I was I was listening again this morning to adoption brother Bram says Cain and he says it represents that it must be a perfect walk and we think Perfection means sinless Perfection no it means to fulfill the word of God so that's what he was telling Abraham here he's saying fulfill the word Abraham Abram he says and I will make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly now you'll notice if he's what he's doing here is he's performing through Abraham's seed the thing that he told Adam and Eve to do he told Adam and Eve he says go forth and what multiply replenish the Earth that's what he told the Adam and Eve to do and they messed it up and now he's coming to Abraham and he says and Abram through your seed I'm going to do what I told them to do in Eden and that's going to happen through Christ and that's going to happen through the new birth that's what we're looking at in this is that's going to be the Fulfillment of what he told him to do in the beginning now he's bringing it down through Abram and it's prophetically pointing to Christ and the and the falling of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost so Abraham still hasn't had a name change Isaac hasn't been born he's 99. sarai's 89 he's weak and old and frail and able to Father child and God says now is the time Abram walk the walk that I've told you to walk do what I've told you to do bring forth the promise Abram God knows how to time a request doesn't he Church when you're feeling at your worst when you're feeling like you're past your due date God comes down says Now's the Time listen if Caleb can do it we can do it because Caleb went into the land and he came out and says we're more than able and 40 years later he hadn't lost an ounce of strength and he says we're still more than able and we're going to go into it and then he says give me this my Mountain give me what you told me to do but God's telling Abram he's saying Abraham time to have that child Abraham's saying are you kidding I'm 99. my wife is 89. it ain't happening God says nonetheless Abram time for you to do it but listen God didn't say you will produce a son what did he say he said I will return unto thee I will return to you Abram and when that happens a birth will take place and it's my returning that brings the birth not your doing that that does it what is it and he gave them a body change he put a change inside of them that made it possible and that's what happens when he comes back when he returns to you when he restores you to position there's a change in you where life can now come forth where before it couldn't before amen it says in Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall end thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee so notice Abraham Abram gets a name change to Abraham which means father of many nations and he's now a laughing stock because he's still 99 he hasn't had a body change Sarah hasn't had a body change there's no pregnancy yet and yet he's going around he's telling everyone by the way don't call me Abram anymore call me Abraham and they're saying you're 99 Abraham right he's a laughing stock and God has put his name in him that is what pointing to the promise that's coming and he's got to carry that for three months he's got to carry that for three months with nothing happening but God's working in the background regardless isn't he says and I will make the exceeding fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of Thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee what is he saying I am thy exceeding great reward and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the lamb wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God so the first promise was Supernatural the second one is natural amen and Israel was focused on the natural all the time that's why so few really really did anything wonderful in Israel was because they only cared about the land and they didn't care about the God that was supposed to be in their midst amen they assume that if they're in the land everything was all right no if they had the god that gave them the land then everything was going to be all right because they had to follow the statutes of God to stay in that land and God said unto Abraham thou shall keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their Generations this is my Covenant which he shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised but this doesn't sound very much like our promised land does it sounds like pain but I'm promising you this is it we're going to get there God says I promise that I will be a God to you and your seed your family forever and that's a standalone promise that's a standalone promise because the next one is for Israel only but the Seed of Abraham spiritual that's the one that we're looking to because we're not looking for land here we've been promised no land here but that first one is the one that we seek after and that's the one that Christ came to fulfill was that Covenant that he would be a god unto us all the way through these things amen he says I will be a a god unto you personal then he says the land is for them but the God is for you right now here today listen so we can't be seeking something natural that's not what we're here for we're not seeking a land we're not seeking big houses we're not seeking great wealth in these different things but we're seeking something else that he promised and that's that he says I will be with you even in you to the end of the age that's our promise amen as I was reading this and I came across this quote as I was studying it's a bit of a long one and we'll we'll be almost done after this but the prophet breaks down what he's talking about here in Genesis 17. and he says now watch here if you can get that next one brother vaishal now watch here the first thing you know I see when he's 19 and 9 God Appears to him to kind of confirm this thing the 17th chapter of Genesis he appeared to him in the name of El Shaddai and now when the El which the El Shaddai is the Hebrew word which means the breast or the breasted one like the mother he said now Abraham I am El Shaddai the almighty God now yet you're old your strengths all gone Sarah's womb is dead she's 90 little grandma like now a great great great grandma 90 years old she's awful old the people's laughing at you making fun of you thanks Lord for boosting my faith he says there's nothing here Abraham and you and Sarah that's going to make this happen but he says but I am the breast of one like a mother to her sickly fretting baby now when the little baby's all weak and run down his strength's gone the mother pulls it to her bosom and the child nurses his strength from the mother he says the mother's strength becomes the child's strength as he draws it from her and so he said now Abraham you're old you're past the age shares past the age but I have to bless her through you so you just lean upon my bosom and just keep nursing amen hallelujah he says I'll give you your strength you draw it out of me now watch the breasted one not one but two he says he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes were healed he says just turn your head to the other one if you need healing amen see I'm the breast of God that's what it means in so many words Abraham I am the breast of God now what I will have to do I'll give you eternal life by nursing from here now I'm going to do some Divine Healing in your body if you'll nurse from there listen God is a source of healing eternal life is the source of healing because he says Divine Healing is what the down payment is the proof of what eternal life prophet of God would teach us that he said he's the same El Shaddai tonight he changes not and his Covenant people has the same privilege to draw from the same resource that Father Abraham had to draw because God swore by the same Covenant that he'd give us the promise hallelujah oh my there you are that's where my hope is built on nothing less but Jesus blood and righteousness when all around my soul gives way he's All My Hope and stay on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand he says there you are El Shaddai the bosom the breast of God if you need salvation for your weak Soul draw from this side if you need healing for your body draw from this side for my Covenant was with Christ my son and in there he was wounded for your transgressions by his stripes you were healed I am the almighty just lean up here and go to drawing from them promises he says take them in your heart tonight and just drawing from them God you promised it tomorrow I don't care how you feel what you look like Lord I'm drawing from that promise watch how strength begins to renew how things begin to straighten up how arms begin to move out how eyes begin to brighten up how Hearts begin to beat normal the breasted God I'm drawing well I don't care how I feel what I look like I'm drawing from that breast Lord you promised it I'm the Seed of Abraham that's why I said the greatest revelation we need is who we are in Christ I am your child and I'm drawing This Promise it's thus saith the Lord I believe you next day I'm sicker than I ever was I'm still drawing I'll stagger not at the promise of God through unbelief but strong in faith giving glory to God for the promise that he said it will be so he says hallelujah Church what a covenant we have and it's a Covenant of Grace it's a Covenant of Grace amen it's his doing it's not ours the promised land for us is an eternal land not a natural one and it's not bound by our actions but it's bound because God swore by himself that he would have a bride without spot or wrinkle and so the very fact we're sitting here today we're standing here today is because he wrote our name in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world before we took the breath of life here and that is why we can stand and we can overcome today amen that's why you have access to the word of God to the promises of God to the very attributes of God is because he wrote your name in that book before the foundation of the world Amen before you ever chose him he chose you you can't stop the grace of God you also can't earn it you can't deserve it all you can do is accept it and walk in it and show your appreciation by the life that you live back to him amen everything we have today is because of Grace as we start to close I want to just wrap this up in a bit of a bow and then we'll we'll continue on Wednesday Lord willing but we read this earlier in the service and he says for ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ for as many of you has have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there's neither Jew nor Greek there's neither Bond nor free there's neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus and if he be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so he says what to be the heir of the promise to be the children of Abraham you have to receive this Promise by a baptism it's not a baptism of natural water that's our confession but this is a baptism that's Supernatural because when you have that baptism it takes you into Christ it baptizes you into a body amen so we're looking for a promise that's related to baptism and then Paul comes in first Corinthians 12 and says for as the body is one and had many members and all the members of that one body be many are one body so also is Christ he says you look at your body it's got all different parts and members and organs and these different things and he says that's the way the body of Christ is it has a bunch of different things put together and they work as one but in verse 13 He says what for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body Israel have one land we have one body and were baptized into it by capital S Spirit that's the Holy Spirit whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and we have all been made to drink into one Spirit remember last verse we spoke about how it was the land with springs and Brooks and there was there was ponds and lakes and there was a pressure behind it and brother Bradham says that or Paul says here he says that what we're drinking from one Spirit there's a life-giving source in each and every one of us and it's the same thing and it's the Holy Spirit he says for the body is not one member but many so that means it isn't just me and that it isn't just you but it's all of us together that make up this body that make up this Promised Land so the true baptism of the true promise to the true Seed of Abraham is a baptism of one spirit and that is the very spirit of God which is the holy spirit amen but then we remember that God told Abraham he says listen you've got to reflect this Covenant back to me you've got to do something you've got to let me know that you're accepting it you've got to let me know that you're believing it you've got to let me know that you're accepting the identification of This Promise Abraham and he says what this is my Covenant which you shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised so there was a sign in their flesh that they were children of promise and then Paul comes along and he's talking about Jesus Earthly Ministry and he says now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision he's not talking of the circumcision that the act or the the process but he's saying Jesus Christ was the minister of the Jews for the truth of God to confirm the promises made unto the fathers so in other words Jesus Christ came and preached to the Jews the natural Seed of Abraham to confirm the promises God made to them but Israel was in the land so if the land was the promised and why did christ need to come and why was he coming to preach promises if they already had the promise the only answer can be was because that wasn't the real promise that wasn't what they were supposed to be looking for amen there was a greater promise than just a natural land and then Paul comes in Colossians 2 and he says and ye are complete in him in Christ which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also ye are circumcised so there is a circumcision that we have to have just like they did and when they crossed over Jordan they had a time of circumcision because the parents hadn't circumcised their children so they went over Jordan they died to themselves and then there was a circumcision there and they had to rest and heal and Paul says each and every one of us is circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ so there is a supernatural circumcision there's a supernatural cutting away of something and guess what we have nothing to do with it these hands can't perform the circumcision that we need it has to be a supernatural circumcision because it brings a supernatural promise with it it can't be something you do it has to be something done and he says it's a circumcision of Christ amen it's a work of God because God's covenant is one-sided so he's got to do the circumcising amen we are merely the ones that benefit from it in verse 12 he says buried with him in baptism that's our doing we do that thing but it's a representation of a death that's supposed to be happening in another way he says wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh so your flesh needs a circumcision hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross so what is he saying he's saying now it's possible for you to walk thou before me and be thou perfect he's made a way he's taken away all the ordinance he's taken away the law he's taken away the sin he's taken away everything that would hold us back from walking before him and fulfilling the word being a perfect believer amen he took care of it all he took care of it all I want to close with this quote I know there's a lot here and it's a lot to dwell on and we'll bring more in the next service Lord William but I want to set this foundation for what it means and what the what the the what Kanan really is for the believer but brother Bram says this he says God keeps his word church if there's one thing we ought to believe it's that God will fulfill his word sometimes he says I can't keep mine and you can't keep yours always but God can keep his I don't know what's in the future but God being infinite knew the end from the beginning and then he cannot make a statement unless it's absolute truth for he knows everything to be infinite we're mortal and we're finite so therefore we can make mistakes but God can't make mistakes and our thought this afternoon is dealing with Israel in a time of such as the church is going through today listen he says all things come to a place of Crisis before it hits a climax diseases usually you go through the crisis and after the crisis then you get Well turns one way or the other he says you die or you get well he says and God has been dealing with the people in those days he was dealing with a nation the nation of Israel and God had let them go down into Egypt and they were there for 400 years according to his word catch this according to his word they go into Israel into Egypt it says they lost their fellowship with God when they went down into Egypt but they did not lose their Covenant for God's covenant was made with Abraham unconditionally for all generations not only Abraham but but to his children through all generations if we could just think of that that you being Abraham's children the promise is just as much to you as it was to Abraham for God made the covenant not only with Abraham but his children and who is Abraham's children those with our that are dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and our heirs according to the promise therefore if you're born again of the spirit of God you become Abraham's children and every promise that God made to Abraham you are an heir to that Promise by grace and their Journey coming through the Wilderness out of Egypt going to the promised land is a type of the church today in its Journey coming up out of Egypt or chaos the world and on its pilgrimage up to the promised land he says and I'm sure that we can all agree today that we are on our way to the promised land we're just camping building little campfires passing through deep Waters and hard trials amen God bless you let's stand this morning amen amen there is a promise for us and we'll see that that promise is the Holy Ghost brother Brian would say it's not just about the Holy Ghost he says but finding your place in the Holy Ghost what an amazing statement to say you say I just need to get the Holy Ghost no you need to be positionally placed you need to be put where you can do the most damage to Satan's kingdom and the most benefit to the kingdom of God and that's what it is is God's going to give it to you and then God's going to use you and place you positionally where you can do what he's he's ordained he's prophesied for this age he's prophesied for each and every one of us to do something in this age that's a reflection of the prophetic aspects of this Bible each and every one of us is going to fulfill prophecy we're doing it here today but we're going to fulfill Prophecy in the last one we're going to fulfill is that death where is thy sting and Grave where is thy Victory amen but until that point he's going to use us he's going to place us in a pace of adoption and then he's going to start using us first Kingdom purposely man that's what we're going forward in in this in this little series from here on amen God bless you let's just close our eyes and go to the throne of grace Heavenly Father Lord how beautiful it is to see your types Lord and how wonderful it is to see the Shadows but Lord how much more wonderful is it when we see it happening in our very lives Lord God Lord that we can lift our hands and voices and worship and praise Lord that we can thank you for the falling of the Holy Spirit Lord the infilling of the Holy Spirit Lord not just something that's on us or around us Lord but something that's inside of us that can give us continuous life-giving prevailing Revelation heavenly father and Lord we want to be quick and more and more each and every day Lord we want to be quick into your word and we want to be dead to the things of this world Lord we want to be so set aside Lord so Sanctified Lord so pulled away from those things that Satan has no access to us Heavenly Father Lord would you lift us up in your word Lord help us see who we are Lord would you grant us Grace Lord to dig deep into your word Lord to eat it to drink it day in and day out Lord to have that time alone with you each one in prayer Lord where you can reveal yourself to us and show us who we are in you we pray Lord God Lord grant us Grace Lord how we need it Lord forgive us forgive me Lord we fall so short many times of our potential but Lord if you'll give us another chance Lord just one time more Lord would you strengthen us for battle Lord and grant us Grace to keep walking this Highway to Heaven Lord just bless your people now we pray in Jesus Christ's name we
