want to thank those that helped brother Matt do the the the move yesterday to get their things out of their house and into storage while they wait on their the house they purchased to come available but we thank the Lord for providing a house amen and trusting him to just continue to be with them in that I also notice the parking lots been the lines have been painted and I understand brother Vel is the one we have to thank for that so good job brother Vel appreciate that amen it's good to see brother Chad and family back as well amen God bless you certainly want to remember the meetings this week and just trusting the Lord to move amen keep it in prayer as the deacons it's sent out by email there'll be a prayer meeting this Wednesday night it's optional you don't have to be here there won't be any preaching or song leading or anything like that it'll just be a time to come in and pray and prepare and and just invite God on the scene for our meetings this weekend amen God bless you each one Jeremiah 2129 let's start in verse 11 I only have 13 up there but just in the study let's start in verse 11 it's a very familiar scripture he says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're taking a second series and as far as I know the last series on this thought of of how do I find the Lord's will for my life the clicker is not not connecting there for some reason amen how do I find God's will for my life and we spent last service really uh going through the big picture and we spoke about how the the big picture of God's will is to bring us into a place of spiritual maturity Amen to bring us to a place of adoption he wants to bring us to a place where he can trust us where he can use us where he can flow through us for his glory and for his purpose amen it's not to put us into something great but it's to reveal Christ in this age amen God was revealed in Christ and Christ is being revealed in his bride and there's a a great mystery revealing that's happening in that and it's a process of time it doesn't just happen in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's the finish of it is in a moment in the twinkling of an eye but it's a process of time amen and last time we showed how Jesus never did anything except the father showed him to do it and we would say that was anything relating to his kingdom purpose I don't believe Jesus was going around saying praying Lord should I eat this second piece of bread at this meal or what robe should I wear today those are not generally things that that that we're talking about but we're talking about those that relate to the kingdom amen and and that's the things we want to make a matter of prayer those things that affect where we go and what we do and and how we spend our time and whatnot so we're talking about being uh led by the spirit of God Amen walking in the word of God and that's that purpose is to destroy the works of Satan amen it's it's to destroy it first in our life and then we turn into a tool in the hands of God and it's to destroy the works of Satan in other people's lives amen it starts with us and it goes to them and Jesus came to do that very thing and we know that we're a continuation of the works of Jesus Jesus said the things that I do you'll do also and Greater Works than these shall you do but in 1 John 3:8 it says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning and for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil that is the overarching view of of of Jesus Christ's Ministry was to destroy the works of the devil so if we're continuing in the works of Christ let me ask are you destroying the works of the devil this morning what is Christ doing through you this morning is he destroying Satan's hold in your life and then is he destroying it in others or is he just kind of sitting on the sidelines because if the ministry of Jesus Christ is active in you then it is destroying the works of Satan in your life amen it is bringing you out of the world it is separating you for the things of the world it's separating you from the influence that Satan's trying to put on you and it's bringing you closer to the word and it's making you sensitive to the Holy Spirit that's how you know that he's working in our life amen Christ always sought the father's will amen why because there was a portion of the word that was given to him but he had to know when and how to do those things amen it's not just about fulfilling the word that's written but it's about finding God's time and season to fulfill those things Jesus was a Healer he was a redeemer he was a savior he was a he was all of these things but he didn't just go out and do those things as soon as he found out who he was but he sought the father daily he prayed to the God that was within him what would you have me to do and how would you have me to do it and when do you want me to do it now we read this scripture in John 5:19 last time but just to Anchor it this morning it said then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever he doeth those also does the son likewise but we would know that even by by the Malachi 4 Ministry we have today that Jesus had an open Vision Ministry that's what we saw with brother Brandon we see it with Paul as well but he would literally see a vision of what was going to happen and his role and his timing in it and then he would go do it and until he was supposed to do it he would do nothing remember brother BR would talk about that person that was going to get healed and he had a vision of the whole scene and there was a hat that had to be placed in a certain spot now brother brandom going into that room saw the Hat was in a different spot so he knew it was not time to pray or declare thus sayeth the Lord and he could not move the Hat because the vision didn't show him moving the Hat the vision just showed that the Hat had to be in a certain place and so he sat back and he waited until somebody moved the hat and then he says then I was in the vision and then I could step and say thus sayeth the Lord you'll be healed amen you have to stay with the way that God reveals it to you and these sort of things amen now we don't have generally speaking an open Vision Ministry it's not that God can't do it it's God that God won't do it amen remember he said I'll give your young men visions and your Old Men Dreams there's a promise of that being available to the believer but speaking frankly most of us don't have an open Vision ministry as far as I know there's no one in this church has an open Vision Ministry some of us have had Visions some of us have had spiritual dreams but it's not always the way God works with us but he does do it with some of them but yet we have to find God's will and if we don't have visions and we don't have dreams it means there must be another way than those things and believe me there is because God can't say I want you to find my will and then not tell you how to do it and not F give you a way to find his will but you know it's so often when we're talking about adoption we're talking about doing but what I find a lack of is we don't find so much a talk about finding first we talk about when I'm a Ed Son of God I'll speak and this will happen and I'll do do this and I'll do that but what I don't hear so often is the ministry focused on the finding the will of God so much as doing the Greater Works and we we'll find as we go through this that we preach so much about speaking and nobody's talking about seeking come on now amen we're all looking for for the part that we're going to do but the part that we're going to do starts with letting him know what he wants done that's the way it works amen we preach about Victory but we forget about the leadership that takes us to Victory amen this is all part and portion of being an adopted son and daughter of God so we can't just say I'm going to go do do do and then forget that we have to wait wait wait and find find find and seek seek seek first because otherwise we're going to fall flat on our face amen and we'll realize as we go through this and I think by experience most of us could say this morning the seeking and the finding and the waiting is by far the hardest part of the Christian walk because that's the trial of our faith Amen brother bramwood put it this way in the message perseverance he says You must first find the will of God God before you can do the will of God well I'm an adopted son I'm going to go do well if you're an adopted son you're going to find first he says You must first know what his will is in the matter and then don't turn it loose and as the lady said today she was trying to get beyond that sound barrier he was talking about a lady trying to break through doubt to for her healing he says then the plane just picks up speed and it goes on unlimited when it passes the sound barrier we talked before and we read the quote where when you're going up to the sound barrier everything starts to shake and vibrate and it feels like everything's going to fall apart and blow up and you're going to be left with nothing but he says once you break through that sound barrier once you break through that doubt barrier he says it's unlimited what can happen after that he says well when you pray until you passed the doubt barrier then you're running free you can go on and there's nothing can bother you then because you're running free you're past the unbelief it's done been settled it's all over when you get the Assurance in your heart that it's going to be that way you're just as happy as if it had already happened that's the kind of Faith that's the kind of assurance the Blessed assurance that is available to the bride of Christ this morning that you can break through the doubt by what by Prayer by seeking God by dwelling on his promises and come to a place where you know it is finished it's a done job it's a finished work and nothing is going to hold me back from getting what God has promised to me the challenge is always will we seek and find and then having found it will we hold to it will we not let anything deviate us from that will we wait for that Assurance or will we what presume will we presume that we know that it that it is God's will the characteristic of a child of God is that they are led by the spirit of God we read this we we spoke of this last service but just to put it down Paul said for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God the defining characteristic of a child of God an adopted son is that he is led by the Holy Spirit you have to be led amen you're sealed first and you're LED second amen you've got to have a ceiling in your soul that is the new birth that is a requirement it is not baptism it is not a confession in Jesus Christ's name it is the New Birth by the sealing of the holy spirit in your soul and that and that alone gives you access to adoption that's the requirement for us Amen brother B would put it this way now this is a bit of a long quote but hold me because this this Paints the whole picture we're looking at this morning he says notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first shown him by the Father John 5:19 as we read I do nothing except what the father shows me he says this harmony is now to exists between the groom and his bride between Christ and the bride of Christ he shows her his Word of Life first two she receives it she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again then he says here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary in seed form he says the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what she want what he wants done with the word why because she is a seeking bride she is a listening bride she is a Praying bride she is a waiting bride he says she performed the command of the word in his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord he says then the word is quickened amen it is put into action with power the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass he says like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full Harvest there's a process of planting a watering a growing and then there's a full Harvest what you get in the end is what you started with in the beginning and then all of and but it's multiplied he says it's planted and watered it comes to full Harvest serving its purpose it's always done with purpose he says those in the bride do only his will how do I find the Lord's will for my life one thing's for sure the bride will only do his will no one can make them do otherwise he says they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still they do not speak and they do not move both you stand and you wait and you say Lord give me direction a I go the wrong direction amen they know why do they stand still church this is the key to it all they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word I can do nothing in myself anything I do will fall flat over this Pulpit you can do nothing of Eternal value except God is in it because it takes God to do a Godly work amen he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time he says now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs did coming in sight he did not declare it to be here he says now Joshua me means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua he says now remember God had started Israel as a virgin with his word but they wanted something different and so did the last day Church notice how God did not move Israel or let her go into the promised land until it was his own appointed time the word promises there the deliverer is there the word is there the signs and wonders are there but they had to wait on God and you'll notice the first thing that held them back was that they had to come to a place of worshiping the one true God they had to find a place of worship and they built the Tabernacle before they ever went in because God said I've got to be first in your life you've got to know who I am and you got to know where to go to worship you got to know how to find me he says now the people might have put pressure on Joshua the leader and said the land is ours let's go and take it Joshua you're all through you must must have lost your commission you don't have the power you used to have you used to hear from God and know the will of God and act quickly something's wrong with you what oh Moses is dead let's go in immediately Joshua he's made you the leader you got to go this is our time this is our season the word's been given he says but Joshua was a god-sent prophet and he knew the promises of God so he waited for them he waited for them he waited for a clearcut decision from God and when the time came to move God placed the full leadership in Joshua's hands why because he had stayed with the word stay with the word and if you're not with the word get back to the word he says God could trust Joshua but not the others and so it will repeat in this day he says the same problem the same pressure what people saying the promise of God is here let's go do it I'm not saying let's stop I'm saying what is God's will that is the only question here is what is God's timing what is God's season for these things because timing is so often what's missing in our decisions we know who we are we know what God wants done we know the plan for this age we know we're coming to a resurrection and rapture we know we've got an end time message to declare and all of these things but what is God's time and season for our actions in this life God wanted Israel to go into or Cana Israel to go into Canaan that was his will but he had a time of it and remember his time came up at kades Baria and he said go in and the people backed away and God said because of that you'll die in the desert then they said oh okay we'll go in now and God said no you can't go in you've missed my time they said well we'll go in anyways and what happened a bunch of them died why they missed God's timing and God said now I've got a different timing you can't just say okay I'm I'm sorry I'm sorry no you've got to go back to God and say okay what's the new plan you can't presume something that was something was wrong to cause you to miss the first one you've got to fix that before you go the second time cuz they didn't go in in faith they went in desperation we missed it I don't want to die in the desert so I'm going to go in anyways and they were completely out of the will of God Amen there are promises available to us in the Bible healing is the children's bread it is the earnest of the resurrection and the Rapture but look there's a man that prayed at the pool Bethesda until he was 38 years old and when he was healed it was in God's perfect time and it was in God's perfect season and it was to glorify God and Jesus perceiving Faith he had perceiving he had Faith to be healed said do you want to be healed stand up go your way that woman with the issue of blood for 12 years sought every bit of help and nothing happened and she blew all her money on doctors and then one day she touched the Hem of His Garment and she is recorded in history for that action Abraham and Sarah 25 years waiting on the promised son and then God gave a completely new body to Sarah and to Abraham to produce the sun Lazarus died the friend of Jesus died too late and then Christ comes over and he raises him from the dead just just in time God's got a time and God's got a season even Isaac Church Isaac had a promise of being the start of a great gener of a great nation and he had to go to God and say God you promised us a child because Rebecca was Barren Rebecca with the promise was Barren and Isaac had to go to God and say God give us the child that you promised there was a seeking there was a finding and there was a timing amen trusting God to work out the timing is one of the hardest things for a Believer it's that trial of our faith and and we look at that so often and we say God why is it because he wants a mature bride and a mature bride is going to be a faithful bride able to stand still amen sometimes we know his will we absolutely know it we know who we are we know what God wants done but will we wait and say Lord when do you want me to do it see here's the thing we know our purpose but we don't know his plan I know who I I am but I don't know how I fit in it and so what happens is he give us his plan and that gives us where the timing is for our purpose greatest example that when you when you when you look at Moses brother BR puts it this way he says now when you have a call from God that doesn't altogether mean you just jump right out and you're doing the will of God Amen the gift does not mean you just go do because you want the Holy Spirit to be behind that gift he says you have to find out the will of God and the time of God to do it Moses thought well the children of Israel will understand now that I'm to be their deliverer so he starts out to do so and he killed a man and he found out that the children of Israel did not understand who are you you're going to kill us the way you did the Egyptian and he fled Into the Wilderness Moses was a deliverer from his birth but he was out of God's will in his timing he says and then what happens Moses lost all the hopes and all the power that he had thinking that freedom wasn't for the children of Israel he' lost all thoughts of Freedom till God met him one day in a burning bush and then when God's season came along just exactly he says then he revealed his plans to Moses now the reason that Moses had forgot about Freedom God's promise that he would free them but God had him forgot his promise Moses tried in himself and failed that's what the church has done many times we've tried in ourselves to do this and when we fail to find God's El element of time see that's our part find God's will find God's timing find God's plan and then you step right into it and nothing can stop you he says this God's got a time for all things we plant corn we got a time that we plow corn then at the time we harvest corn the spring rains come the drought come through the summer the fall rains in the snow you just can't say I plant my wheat today and tomorrow and go out and harvest it God has times for season he has seasons for his word he has times in the scripture where it said and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick that's when Jesus was ministering too and the presence of the Lord was there to heal the sick maybe at other times the presence of the Lord wasn't there to heal the sick he says we find out that God works everything seasonally and now when Moses what he failed to find was the time limit of God then when God revealed himself to him in the burning bush he found out that the very thing that was in The Burning Bush was the thing that he lacked what the leadership of God the presence of God with him the pillar of fire that's what made the difference Moses wasn't necessarily any better or worse but he needed God to go with him he says I think that's what a whole lot with us today that many times we try to do the program ourselves and failed to get what was in the burning bush the direct revelation of the will and time of God church if he's saying that's what we need then that's got to be available to us he says so then Moses found out now the real direct will of God and the time of God and the revelation of everything to do he says now try to keep him out of Egypt right back to Egypt he went just as hard as he could go for he knew that God had promised deliverance and the time for deliverance had come God had promised promised it and now is the time for it he says now Moses was looking first at the word that's where we go that's our claim is right here you find it here you say God that's mine when is it mine is it today is it tomorrow what's holding it back lord what would you have me to do he says Moses was first look looking first at the word the word of God had promised them Deliverance he knew the time was nigh why because God gave them a timeline he says now he had to have a direct contact with God to know how and when to do it he says now we as Full Gospel people I think we have made many mistakes by looking into the word and say God said this and we failed to find the direct revelation of our life to fit in that program see it's not just about me it's not just about you it's not just my little issue or my little problem or my little maybe it's your big situation or your big problem or my big problem but he says how does it all fit into the program of God cuz see God sees the big picture God sees the big picture and we're sitting here in our own little bit of humanity saying me me me me me God do it for me God do it for me sometimes God's using you for a testimony that you really don't want sure testimonies don't feel real good in the middle of them usually but God will use you to help somebody else I I sent a a video around to the to the to some of the church members uh on on our our WhatsApp chat there brother Matt Watkins was talking about a uh an event or a thing they had there and he was talking to this this couple that had been saved in their in their church and then they had a a a friend or a relative that had stage four non Hodgkins lymphoma cancer now you've seen the testimony of my sister right and so he said he went in and he was testifying to them and he was showing them the pictures of my sister atanta her before and after and remember she didn't have it that bad generally speaking and I say that bad because when you see what this guy was like it was completely worse and they were saying this is what we believe God does this is what God did and the sis and this lady said I've always wanted to believe that God heals like that I've always wanted a God that had a reality like that and so brother Matt went and he prayed for this man and this man his body was black with cancer from his neck all the way way down to his groin almost solid black if you look at the pictures and he has like this big growth out of his neck the exact same thing that my sister had and you know what happened he laid hands on him he prayed and a little while later he sitting with them and they look down at their phone and they say oh my goodness he's completely healed of cancer there's nothing left church this man had a growth the size of a large potato on the side of his neck visible and completely healed completely healed there's a time and there's a season she went through that testimony so God could do a greater work in somebody that had it even worse than she did can you imagine what God can do if we'll just sit back and say God I'm trusting you I believe you're with me I believe you're a Healer I believe you're a deliverer I believe you're a provider and even though it doesn't look like it right now I still believe you're it cuz that's the faith of the believer as they hold on when nothing else seems to be pointing in that direction we're growing into rapturing Faith Church what's below rapturing Faith healing Faith saving Faith leading Faith providing faith and so we've got to be growing up bit by bit precept upon precept line upon line word upon word a little bit here and a little bit there growing up into the rapturing faith I'm sorry to tell you I know I've said it many times you're not just going to get rapturing Faith but you will go from Faith to Faith and glory to glory until you step off of this Earth it's a process of time that's going this is what brother Ram saying it's starts as a seed and it's growing through your life and what matters is what you do to help it grow do you water it do you get in the presence of God to let it ripen in the sun that's our part that's our portion that's the part that's holding people back because you get to choose to water it you get to choose to get in the presence of God you get to seek and find that's the part that you play in side of this thing amen Jud would say this he says but ye beloved building up yourselves on your Most Holy Faith don't stop with salvational faith keep moving on into the next step and the next stage of your life and the growth that God has for you he says praying in the Holy Ghost that means getting in the presence of God that means fighting for these things how do we get up in that how do we how do we grow in the in God Church how do we get our faith to stret stretch out there's only one way there's only one way you can have faith so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing comes by the word of God that's a supernatural hearing that's a spiritual hearing that's not just saying I went to church and I heard the word but something deep inside of me laid hold of that word and it finally caught what that preacher was talking about it finally caught what that scripture meant and it changed my life it only comes by the preaching and hearing of the word of God Amen my wife shared a testimony with us yesterday and I was down studying for most of the day it was a long day and she was in the room NE she was in the room just opposite me and I through the wall I could hear her listening to brother brandom all throughout the day and she came up and she said I want to tell you what happened because she said I was listening to this message and brother R's going through it and through it and then he gets to the end and he's about to call a prayer line and then he stops and he says how many in here want to be healed or need to be healed that doesn't have a prayer card this is maybe 40 50 60 years ago well my wife needed healing so he said I want you to just repeat this prayer with me in faith and she repeated it and she was healed immediately Faith cometh by hearing does it matter it matters who you sit under it matters what you're hearing and it matters whether you go to hear it amen she put on an anointed word from an anointed prophet and it had an anointed effect in her body it brought her body subject to the word that she was listening to if she could accept it she had to say that's for me I don't have a prayer card I've been tormented by this and God sent a Deliverance to her if she could hear it by ears of Faith by spiritual ears amen finding the will of God is always an exercise of Faith amen but those that come to God must believe that he is that he exists that he's real and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him diligently seek him all the time in everything unrelentingly seeking the will of God in their lives amen not just sitting back but knocking knocking and knocking Jesus talked about the unjust judge and that woman that went to him and just kept knocking on his door and saying deliver me deliver me he says if the unjust judge will do it well how much more will your father in Heaven do if you keep knocking in faith and saying deliver me provide for me heal for me whatever it might be that we have need of David said this in Psalms he says teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of mine enemies why because there's things all over trying to drag us out of the will of God trying to influence us just that little bit just to take us a little bit away lay something aside compromise a little bit but what is a the word do it keeps you in the minds and thoughts of God so that you can see that deviation you say not today Satan I'm going straight brother B puts it this way we've lost it he says you've got to First find the will of God now you've got to find the will of God this morning as you're coming to be prayed for you've got to find the will of God whether it's God's will to heal you or not you say it's God's will to heal everyone God would desire that we would be healed but there are conditions to healing for the real believer absolutely God is not just a grandfather that gives healing to everyone there's a purpose behind it and he's got to see certain things in our lives we'll talk about that in a bit he says the next thing you have to do if you're coming to get salvation you got to find out whether it's God's will to save you or not the first thing you have to find out is what God's will is he says and then if you really have receive the seed in your heart then you can be persistent you seek until you find and once you find then you lay hold of it he says there's nothing going to move you no matter what wisdom man tries to say it's not so and it's not this and that and the other it doesn't move you one iota because you know what the will of God is he spoke it into your heart by he says and your faith sits there and it'll hold right on no matter if there's no more than like a grain of mustard seed he says it'll bring you right out to that place the will of God it doesn't take much I was talking with someone after church the other day they're talking about healing and remember that woman that comes up and she gets healed and brother Braham says you didn't realize you had that much Faith did you it just has to be the real deal doesn't have to be much it just has to be real because you got a little bit and it'll move a mountain he says as I was speaking on private interviews today and met a couple a man and his son I said you can never never go forward until you're perfectly satisfied and know without a shadow of a doubt you're walking in God's will he says then when you know that you're in God's Will and walking in his way nothing can stop you nothing can stop you because you know where you're standing he says the know you know the way you're going you know what you have in your mind you know what the will of God is and then you can do it we've got to find the will of God you say brother John we got it how do we do it let's talk about that let's get to the Practical side how do we find the will of God for our lives amen now I want to prefis a bit because we have we we have the will of God for two things we have the will of God for us to receive something and then we have the will of God for us to do something and those are very different things the process is the same but yet they're very different in terms of what we're looking for amen you're seeking God's will to receive something perhaps it's healing financial needs something he provides amen but we we read last last service in the scripture where he said that it is that it is God's will for us to prosper and be in health even as what even as our soul prospers so what God's looking for in The Believer is not Earthly wealth it is spiritual wealth it's spiritual growth it's spiritual maturity the revealing of his work of his will the mystery of his will is to produce adoped Sons and Daughters of God so Above All Else God wants us to grow spiritually I I've quoted that that thing that brother Eugene taught me so long ago that agape love God's love is based on spiritual growth that is all he looks for spiritual growth everything he does is to get us to grow spiritually because the scripture says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and then all these other things that he knows you need he'll add them to you but seek that first amen so whatever we need to receive is so often depend dependent on our spiritual condition now just because you're sick just because you're in financial need just because you're dealing with things doesn't mean we're spiritually sick amen but it may indicate that there's a deeper issue than just the sickness or the the the want that you're you're going through in these different things so we always need to check up we always need to check up but really as we come into adoption we're not talking about receiving because remember adoption is about service not receiving it's about working it's about destroy destroying the works of Satan and so it's not about what I get it's about what I can give it's about what I can do for the body of Christ amen and so when we're going into action when we're in adoption then what we're doing is we're saying God I'm about your kingdom work now what would you have me to do where would you have me to go how would you have me to do it when would you have me to do it why because we're going to face opposition we're going to face uh battles we're going to face struggles and so we've got to know that when those things come that we're facing them because we're in the will of God not because we're proud of the will of God now here's the thing you say how do I find the will of God for my life if only we had somebody that had asked the profit this question how do you feel is the best way to find the Lord's will in some important matters here you go he says I tell you dear friend the best way not the only way the best way to find the will of God in some important matters is prayer he says here's a wonderful little thing here if you have a matter that's very important now here's the way I do it I take it before the Lord it's always been my strength what's my his strength his Visions his dreams no I wait upon the Lord and see what he says he says and I just let myself be neutral to it and don't take either side it's not wrong to have a preference Jesus had a preference in Gethsemane I don't want to do it it's going to hurt a lot but he said nevertheless less not my will but thy will be done that's what neutrality means this flesh is always going to have a preference and it's always going to be the easy Road the fun road the nice Road the wealthy Road the healthy road it's not wrong to want it but we've got to lay it aside and say Lord I know your way is the best way he says and so if I was in your place and didn't have visions from the Lord I would just wait upon the Lord and say Lord now you show me what's the decision to make notice he did not say Lord here are your three options tell me which one to take he said Lord you tell me the decision to make because so often what Satan does is he gives us three options and we think one of them's got to be the will of God no that's Satan's tools they're putting us through these things that work and and it's these situational things that are uh it's it's all this alternative lifestyle stuff and everything they're trying to get us to to think wider and bigger and you know what they do they give you four answers as to how to respond to a situation you know what I do I don't click any of them because none of them are my answer but here's the thing Satan will give you answers and say pick four one of the four one of the three one of the two whatever it is listen God can give you an answer that you don't even realize God can lead you in a way you didn't consider before so don't go and say God here's the option say God here's the situation what do you have me to do amen he says and then the way you feel led to do it oh I got an unction brother John he says wait a little wait just a little bit okay it's still there and then wait a little little while longer he says and see which way which side you lean towards which way the spirit would lead say now father in my heart you know it doesn't matter but I want to know what you want to do about it and he doesn't say it here but I will add to it this when you get an answer check it with the word always always I've had too many people come to me and say I feel led to do this and I say it's against the word of God and you know what that's embarrassing for them and it's embarrassing for me check it with the word because God cannot lead you outside of his word he cannot Lead You contrary to his word can't do it he doesn't do it he says that's the way I do about meetings sometimes I feel kind of led to go this way or that way then I'll follow that way that's the way to do it cuz it's in prayer then you're doing the best you can he says and I believe this my friends as Paul was in the new Testament in days gone by he was between two Straits which way he should go and he started on the wrong road and he got a Macedonian call he says and I believe if you are making a decision for god making a decision for God and do it the best you can I believe God will correct you and see that you don't go wrong I believe God will do it that's a great grace and mercy to us this morning amen that in your sincerity if you step outside of his will he'll bring you right back around to it why because a sincere heart is easily corrected a sincere heart is always easily corrected now this isn't a platform for laziness church let me say that again this is not the platform for laziness well brother John I prayed once and this is how I feel led to do it and you're not answering to me by the way I have nothing to do with it you answer to him but you don't just say I prayed last night for three minutes and this is the way I feel led to do it he may give you a clear answer in three minutes but the prophet God says wait a little bit and then wait a little bit more and make sure it stays that way make sure it stays that way amen remember what we said we read the scripture says God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him diligently constantly it's a continual thing and it's got to be sincere and it's got to be honest remember what Paul said pray without ceasing now that doesn't mean that your entire day is spent in prayer we has only so much capacity we have a a mind that has to work and take care of things and whatnot but what he says here when you go into this it means be prayerful pray constantly without unnecessary gaps in time meaning don't go long times without talking to God don't go a week without praying to God don't go a day without having a conversation with god and as you come up to situations say Lord I need you Lord lead and guide me because what's going to happen in those situations so many times you don't know you can't pray ahead of time when they say this what do I say so you've got to go in prayed up you got to go in prepared you got to go in Washed by the Water of the word you got to go in fortified with the sword of the word so that when the situation comes up when circumstances go sideways you know how to respond because you've been in his presence like brother brah talked about David he says David was prayed up when he met Goliath he didn't have to go get ready he was ready for the battle right then and there amen you can't read your Bible too much and you can't pray too much that's for sure there's a lot of things you can do too much but those aren't them you when you look in the scriptures and you look at Believers you'll see that there are always people of prayer always people of prayer David is probably the greatest example of a man that just went in and he didn't leave until he got his answer because David never lost the battle why because he kept looking for God's will that's the way it always worked with David he sought the Lord in all of these things amen you know I think of Paul and and remember he's he he he's appealed to Caesar God tells him appeal to Caesar I'm going to send you for a witness you've got to go before Caesar and plead your case and you're going to die there by the way Paul so Paul goes and remember he's going to take a ship and before he gets on the ship because the Centurion is taking him he says guys we really shouldn't go on this trip it's not going to end well Paul was a prophet they knew he was something special and he says I highly recommend we don't do this and so what happens the the Centurion says no no no the sailor's no better than you P we're going to go and they go out and they get this storm and for three days they're doing everything they can to to hold the ship together and then what does Paul do Paul's not comfortable in this situation Paul knows he's going to make it through because he's got to go to Caesar Paul's not worried for his life but what does Paul do in this situation they've they they they've disobeyed his his his recommendations they put his Prophet uh mantle aside and now he goes and he starts to pray for those Souls that are in that ship they've turned him down but he goes and he starts praying for them and then he gets an answer and what does he do Church does he come up and say ner ner ner I told you not to do it and now look where you're at Paul says you should have listened to me he reminds them you got you had the word of the Lord and you turned it down but watch what he says he says for there stood by me this night the angel of God whose I am and who I serve adopted sons have access to something that many people will never even know about he says saying fear not Paul for thou must be brought before Caeser and lo God have given thee all them s them that sail with thee Paul goes down and he starts to pray for the souls on that ship and he gets an answer from God that says I'll give you every one of them cuz he asked cuz he asked Church doesn't matter if we pray it matters if we pray does it matter how we pray it matters how as we pray continually Paul's there for three days and that thing drags on for 14 days if I'm not mistaken 14 days where everything's just going south south south and Paul says listen don't worry let the ship go get in the water you'll all be safe and sure enough they come out there they come out safe it's not just about praying but it's praying the right way they said to Jesus teach us how to pray have you ever looked at the order of the Lord's Prayer I did a whole series on on on this way back when here in Newland but you notice that it always starts with acknowledging who God is you know what that's saying God you're the most important thing you're the Sovereign power You're My Healer you're my provider you're my deliverer you're my guide you're my protector and I just want to knowledge that before I talk about anything else Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thank you Lord I love you Lord I appreciate that you've been my God then what does it say thy kingdom come thy will be done Lord You're Sovereign your will is perfect your will is what's best for me and then after that it says thy will be done on Earth this Earth as it is in heaven and then it says give us this day our daily bread and forgive us lead us not in Temptation Deliver Us from Evil see so often we go into prayer and all we're focused on is me and at the end we say I love you Lord by the way if we'd invert that and say Lord I love you I worship you I praise you I'm sick I'm tired I'm weary I'm broke I'm broken but I love you anyways You Are God Alone and you do all things well I think that it changed sometimes the results we have Amen brother Bram says this he says now if we have went to seeking the giver instead of the gifts I believe the church would have been further up the road don't you think so he says if we'd stayed close to God and loved him and just kept living for him and not trying to push things over not trying to make it happen not trying to do it our way not trying to force our will into his will not trying to tell God what to do but just living for him he says just live for God live a pure and holy life and live and pray every day keep yourself refreshed in his presence and God will take care of the rest of it he will adopt the people into his own beloved body the church and when the Rapture comes you'll be found without a blemish because you're living in the presence of the king he says that's the secret friend living in the presence of the king he says there it is when you're meeting really face to face with demon powers when you're meeting face to face with opposition where there's where the testing time comes he says a chains only its strongest at its weakest link that's right and when you're face to face with opposition be sure that you know what you're talking about what's he saying your daily life your daily experience with God is what's going to hold you in those moments because you know who you have believed you know that he's real you know that you've talked to him you know that he's spoken back to you he's LED you he's guided you he's provided for you he says live a Pure Life live a life that's pleasing to God and keep yourself refreshed in his presence this world it used to be you had to go out of your house to get influenced by the world now all you have is a smartphone and Satan has every bit of influence he ever used to have at the tap of a button at a couple little queries or searches apps Satan can be influenced just by the simple picking up of of a phone Satan can influence us by a simple picking up of our phone turning on your computer right you don't have to go buy a book anymore you don't have to go look at a bad magazine you don't have to go to a concert or something it is all available right there and here's a sad thing sometimes we're inviting him in sometimes we go down that road and guess what when you invite somebody into your house they have full access and full right to your home we've got instant access to distraction to entertainment to filth to news to personalities to influence and what happens is Satan moves in slowly and what happens is we stop seeking the presence of God Prophet said keep yourself refreshed anyone need a refreshing this morning weary God bless you weary tired you know what this ought to be the happiest time of the year for us as as we have summer and sunshine and it's the most miserable time for me because of my allergies you know what I get weary in the spring and early summer I don't sleep well my eyes are watering my throat gets acting up I get weary and you know what this body can drag down my spirit when you're tired when you're worn out I need to get in his presence to refresh because I've got to be able to push past how I feel Amen to get into the promise of the word and let the Holy Spirit Quicken me amen he says keep yourself what does that mean it's our choice we have to do it God is a gentleman he will not force himself in we have to seek we have to push we have to give the time because what happens is we're trying to cram God into the 15 minutes we've allocated for him each day and then we get stuck on our phone for two hours and you think that 15 minutes that you got is going to push out the two hours that you spend looking at stuff that's a total waste of your time my time meaning me personally I'm preaching to us all refreshment of the presence of God let ask us ourselves this morning what's the timeline look like between time with God and time with everything else my phone every Sunday morning gives me a report on how much time I averaged on my phone every week per day and I cringe when I see it go up because I don't want it going up I want it going down down down because I know that half of it at least is a total waste of my time where are we at we want rapturing faith we want healing faith we want delivering faith we want provisional Faith where's the diligence amen God's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him not conveniently seek Him amen my mom said this way she said I give God a tithe out of my day minimum your waking hours give them one tenth of that that's a good rule that's a good rule but guess what you're going to have to fight you're going to have to seek that out you're going to have to push things away and decide what really matters what's really in your core work for the kingdom of God and then take everything else and say sorry that's got to go by the wayside because I want to go in a Rapture I want to get out of here so often we're asking where's the god of Elijah and God's saying well where are the elijas God hasn't changed God has not changed the Holy Spirit has not changed so where are those that'll have the commitment of Elijah the prayer life of Elijah Elijah got weary too remember Elijah got tired Elijah got down but it never stopped him from following the will of God finding and following the will of God in his life and God backed him up every time we're human we're going to get tired we're going to get worn out we're going to get weary we're going to get dragged down we're going to trip up and fall but ajust matter a righteous man gets up over and over and over again that's not what defines us Christ is our Perfection but spiritual maturity brings us to a place where we give him the preeminence in our day and in our time amen Elijah had lots of Trials and Faith of his faith amen but he rested in knowing that God had told him what to do he's going up and he's facing 450 prophets he's putting himself in the lion's mouth and God backs him up his simple prayer Lord vindicate your word vindicate your word and he destroys everything the altar the wood the stone The Oxen the water everything just vindicating you stay with my word I'm the one true God brother Braham says this but whatever I'm trying to get these things settled down where I can find his perfect Divine will number one then he says his channel to walk in and stay there there regardless of what anyone says about it he says when you find the will of God don't let nobody talk you out of it there's a story of a young prophet in the book of First Kings and God gave him a message for King jeroboam and he went and he he gave it to the king and the King reacted poorly and he went out to grab him and as soon as he laid hold of him his hand withered and the King was of course very shocked I'm sorry will you pray for me and so the young Prophet prays for him and his hand is restored and the King says to him he says well come home with me and he says I'll give you a good meal and I'll give you a reward for what you've done to me but catch this thought now cuz God knew what was coming coming and he told his Prophet what to do he says and the man of God said unto the king if thou will give me half of thine house I will not go with thee in other words you give me half of what you own I still won't come he says neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place for so it was was it charged me by the word of the Lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou came he says you came by the King's Way do not go back by the king's way and don't eat anything with anybody he says and so he went another way and returned not by the way he came to bethl notice he followed the word of God and did not tempt himself because when you walk by a place of Temptation you're going to be tempted more than you were if you weren't there amen we've talked about this before Joseph used his feet for discernment he did not sit and have a conversation with Piper's wife when she tried to force him to have a relationship with her he used his feet for discernment 99% of the battle is won if you just walk away do not give yourself the option you know your weakness you know that hole in your armor you know where Satan's got a Punch Coming do not give him the opportunity and here's the beautiful thing God had shown him don't do it don't do it so he just had to Simply obey and he did he did but I want you to see how Satan works because sometimes he can't get you with an un believer so he'll get you with a Believer or somebody you think is a Believer now I want to be very careful this morning this isn't aimed at anyone or anything but but I want you to look at this story because every bit of scripture is given for our admonition we're talking about personally finding the will of God for our lives because there's this old prophet in bethl do you remember what bethl means House of God there's an old prophet in the house of God that hears of all of this that's happened and so he gets on his donkey and he chases down the the younger prophet and he's trying to bring him in for Fellowship but he knows the message that young man has been given that says do not stop and yet he goes and he willfully seeks without that young man and watch what he says so he comes up to that young man and the young man says hey uh nice to see you but I can't come back with you I can't stop and eat God told me don't do it listen to what this believer says and he said unto him I'm a prophet also as thou and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water it says but he lied unto him remember what Paul said though we are an angel from heaven speak any other gospel when God shows you his personal will for you do not move do not move I have no idea how this Prophet did it maybe God hadn't been using him in a while maybe he got jealous maybe he was trying to exert his influence the scripture never tells us why but this man intentionally went to get this young man out of God's will it's not inspiration and the only thing that we can decipher from this is that he wants to destroy this young man cuz he knows the promise is death if you get out of the word he says and so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water he listened to what someone else had said even even though the word of the Lord had come to him and had come true already and God had stayed with them all the way through this he had God's Will and now somebody else coming somebody senior to him comes and tells him no God's will for you is different it says and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the Lord came unto the prophet that brought him back now the old guy is suddenly getting a word from the Lord a real word from the Lord and he cried under the man of God that came from Judah saying thus sayeth the Lord for as much as thou Hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord and has not kept the Commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee but camest back and has eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the Lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcass shall not come unto the separer of thy fathers he says you're not going to make it back to where you live alive and you won't even get buried with your fathers you went against what I told you you got influenced by somebody who was not me you let their gift override your test your personal witness and testimony now that young Prophet took his donkey home and on the way back a lion killed him killed him did not eat him and it stood over his body and you know who came and dragged it back that old Prophet came put it on a donkey and came and buried it with his family that old Prophet that old believer dragged that young man to his death by exerting an influence on him because he knew that young man would respect him as ministers we have to be so careful but church let me say it's not just ministers it's Mom and it's Dad amen deacons we can push people in directions without knowing the situation if they prayed and it is not contrary to the word of God we must let them go but here's the thing sometimes we've been down that road and it looks the exact same we're allowed to say I'm not sure that's the best idea but we should never try and force it cuz they've got to grow and learn just like we did and guess what you learn by your mistakes as much as by your your successes amen we're here to edify one another but here's the thing I've got weaknesses that you don't and you've got weaknesses I don't and so God can lead me a certain way and it's perfect for me and it's horrible for you and vice versa so God may lead you in a way that's different than mine and he may lead me in a way that's different than yours amen and so we've got to find God's will for our lives each one I can't do it based on my life and you can't do it based on yours amen but as long as our our leadership doesn't contradict the word of God then we've got to let it go but if it is contrary to the word of God you have an obligation to speak up and so do I you see a brother or sister going in a way that is absolutely contrary to the word of God you have a right and an obligation to say brother sister watch out and here's why not I feel not I believe thus says the word that's it no opinions word that's that's how we do it amen but let me stop here because sometimes it's not contrary meaning there's nothing in the word that says you should not do this but what we do is we ignore the instruction of the word in other areas so sometimes the word doesn't say don't do this but what it does say is do this and when we do this it doesn't allow us to do this can I give an easy example we're living in Alberta uh we had a lot of people that worked on the oil rigs and if you know oil rig jobs they are typically 3 weeks on and then one or two weeks off and then they come back well in those three weeks they have no church they're away from their families they're among some of the the crudest roughest people on the planet they work hard they play hard and there's all sorts of Filth that's available in those camps okay there is nothing Godly about it but yet the scripture does not say don't work on an oil rig amen the scripture doesn't say don't go work don't work work there we all work in filthy workplaces I work for the federal government and it's as filthy as any place I've ever been in many ways but it's not filthy the way an oil rig is but yet it's filthy it's more subtle though so that in and of itself is not bad so you can't say well the the word doesn't say no to oil rigs amen but remember we're supposed to thrive spiritually in God's Will and everything else comes next so if we're surviving in that oil rig job that's not what God's looking for he's looking for us to grow I was talking to a a minister from Alberta there a while back and he said you know I've had a number of young men that that wanted to go there and he says and I've told every one of them it is not a good idea he says I'm not saying it's not God's will he's saying I'm not it's not a good idea and he says for you to survive it it takes a very strong Christian not to mention grow amen but here's the problem is the scripture does say forsake not the assembling of yourselves together so it doesn't say don't go to the oil rigs but it does say keep going to church it does say You're supposed to be home with your family you're supposed to lead your house and what happens so many times in those families is that the mother is left the wife is left to completely take care of everything on her own and she's put out of her position because you get out of your position amen so there's nothing wrong with an oil rig job except when you look at the instruction of the word the job fails and so you say I'm sorry you can say to a brother like that and say I'm sorry I don't believe the word supports that kind of a life I don't believe the word supports that kind of a way of making money because it's going to destroy your family it's going to destroy your your ability to support the local body if nothing else it affects the body see here's the thing and we'll get into this in a little bit if it's purely selfish it's not God's will if it only benefits you it's not God's will CU God's got a purpose for all these things and it's for a body amen he says brother Bram said find his perfect Divine will his channel to walk in and stay there regardless of what anyone says to do it that's simply put but it's harder to put into practice as we're talking about how do I find God's will for my life and brother B said pray and wait and wait and wait and wait amen and too often I find what we're doing is we're resting on the fact that we are a child of God we've been filled with the Holy Ghost we've received an end time message and we believe that because of that everything we do will be blessed that's never that's never in the scripture it's not there just because you sit in a certain place sit under a certain Ministry just because you're a a holy ghost filled child of God does not mean that anything you do will be blessed you'll never find that in scripture quite the opposite quite the opposite scripture never says you'll never be sick but it says if they lay hands on them they'll recover and it doesn't say that you'll never have Financial stress but it did say I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor seed begging bread it did not say you'd never face a battle but it did say you'll be delivered amen there's a way that God works in these things and sometimes we're looking at our lives and saying why aren't I flourishing why aren't things going well well it's because God's looking at the spiritual side of us first and foremost many times and that's failing and so he can't bless us in the other ways because we're children of God anybody else he just lets them go they can do whatever they want and they will maybe flourish in those things how how often would David say why do the why do the Heathen you know get rich and do so well and I'm stuck here and running around the desert trying to keep my head on its shoulders our Soul's health is what God's looking at and if we're focused on the flesh rather than the soul guess what the flesh is going to keep suffering got to put God first in our lives and then second all even our sincerity Even in our sincerity there's still a requirement for us to seek the will of God not to presume on these things amen this is an age where everybody presum assumes I'm right and I'm good that's a lat ofy and curse isn't it and people assume these things and this is not just a mental issue it's not just a social issue but it's a spiritual issue as well well I'm a message believer I've received this end time message and we think that then all of our thoughts and our ideas and our influences are there good and right and God's obligated to bless them wrong wrong it's never been that way amen we've got to check up constantly we got to check up constantly because satanic influence tends to come in very slowly and you don't realize it often until you get to a big decision and that's when it falls apart brother Bram says it this way he says oh that's what we do sometimes we go off on a tantrum somewhere and not think about God not pray over it or ask the Lord whether we should do it or not and we find out that our supply of blessings is cut off he says then we wonder sometimes we'll wonder why I can't have no more blessings he says you don't watch and you let down in your prayer life you're not guarding in you're not keeping an eye on what's coming in and what's going out you're not tapped in to what God's trying to do on your life you're just cruising assuming presuming and guess what God says I'm going to stay here when you want to come back to me you can but you just keep cruising then when you get sick of the bruising you can come back he says you don't watch you let down in your life you say well I'm a Christian I'm a message believer he says well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever amen he says read the Bible every day pray every day church this is this is rubber meets the road Simplicity there is nothing here that not a single person in this church can do except maybe the ones that can't read and they can still pray Samuel loves to pray amen why because he's seen it as an example of what it's supposed to be where it's supposed to be in our life he says don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly notice that harshly that's an attitude problem that's an attitude problem and it comes down to motive and objective he says don't make any decisions too harshly or too quickly without first considering God about it ask him shall I do this father ask him is it your will for me to do do this then see what the holy spirit will speak to you he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you to let you know if you'll be sincere and ask him not just ask him be sincere and ask him he says then we see that when the crisis come it showed just who was down in their heart yet a Believer that's the time you get to see the true colors amen who's been praying and who hasn't who's been reading and who hasn't who's really got something in their soul and who doesn't amen reading your Bible as I said before it sets you in the mind and intentions and purpose of God and we're forgetful hearers we're forgetful hearers we're forgetful readers amen and so the more you read it prayerfully and the more you consider it the more it'll take away these thoughts and give the mind of Christ in replacement because what's happening is the washing of the word takes away the world and the influence of the world and it replaces it with deity by the word that's what you're doing is you're wanting to wash that away so that he can have the preeminence amen and that's got to be a daily thing CU Paul said I Die daily and that's what's happening with the word washing over us is it's causing that flesh to Die daily and then what happens is with that daily death comes a daily quickening as well by the Holy Spirit to make the word live inside of us notice what he says here he'll show you in some way he'll speak if you'll be sincere and ask him ask sincerely you know we spoke last service about asking for permission that's not sincerely sincerely is what do you want me to do not can I do it it amen prayer is not getting permission it's about getting direction amen permission injects us into the situation amen but Direction puts God in the driver's seat so we need to seek that direction first and foremost because permission Seekers find themselves in the permissive will of God and the person that's always affiliated with permissive will is balum and you do not want to become a balum balam was a true Prophet as in he had a true gift and by the end he's called sser he's a preacher For Hire he's a prophet For Hire that'll tell you what you want to hear that's where he went from he went from being able to get the word of God to merely being a paid guy that tell you whatever you wanted what a story of balum what a fall brother B is talking about people that seek the permissive will of God he says they remind us exactly of balum he had the prophetic office he knew the proper approach to God as demonstrated in the sacrifice of the clean beasts yet he was not a true word Prophet for when God told him not to go honor BAC with his presence he sought to go anyway for he was motivated by his Lust For Gold and Prestige catch this so God let him go the perfect will of God gave way to the permissive will of God because of the heart desire of balum God actually said go ahead go listen to the message false anointed ones anointed ones at the end time he says did God change his mind no sir God had his way regardless of balum going balam did not an know the will of God God had his way regardless it was balum who was the loser for he bypassed the word he says today we have that very same thing women preachers organization false Doctrine Etc and people worshiping God manifesting in the spirit and going right on as did balum claiming that God has spoken to them even when the commission received is opposite to to the revealed word now catch this last statement he says and I will not deny that God spoke to them he says but it was just like what he spoke to balum that second time he says as he knew that balum wanted his own heart desire above the word and he gave it to him yet all the while in the end having his own way even so God today tells folks to go ahead in their own heart's desires for they have already rejected the word he says but the will of God will be done regardless Hallelujah he says amen I hope you see this it will not only clear up much of what is seen in all ages but it will especially help in this last age which has so much manifestation and external blessings when the whole period is so against the word revealed will of God what a sad State of Affairs the lean church I am rich and increased with good and have need of nothing what manifestations and external blessings and he says and you know not that you are poor wretched miserable blind and naked and know it not amen the prophet saying here you better check why you're asking as much as you're checking what you're asking amen why because balam wasn't seeking to glorify God he said he wanted Prestige he wanted honor he wanted influence he wanted wealth amen he wanted to be a big shot and guess what there ain't no big shots in this God's the big shot and he calls the shots amen we're just his tools we're just vessels we're surrendered vessels amen all glory belongs to him and when we seek our own benefit above his then that's when we get off the rails he would say this he says You must test your motive and objective first he says first find the will of God he says and then find your objective you find the will of God then find your objective and then test your motive and see if your motive is right then as Jesus said in mark 11:24 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart he says but as long as you've got doubt in the heart whether it's the will of God number one he says or your motive or objective is wrong he says how's it going to move he says but when you know that your motive is right and it's the will of God and your objective is right it's got to move that's all or God told something wrong and we know God doesn't tell us something wrong so therefore there must be an issue on our motive objective or finding his will amen sometimes we B at that inner type of examination I think I don't really want to look too deep sometimes we know it's there but here's the other time other side of it truly in sincerity sometimes we say if it benefits me it can't be God's will sometimes we're Catholic that way we beat ourselves up that if anything for me is good for me out of this then then I must be wrong my motive and objective must be wrong no not NE not necessarily that's for sure if all we want is our benefit we're wrong totally but if I get a benefit and the body of Christ gets a benefit and my intent is to benefit you first and foremost as the body of Christ then yes that's fine I get tremendous satisfaction out of ministry it's a ton of work it is a stress but it's something that that that's in me to do and it it's a tremendous thing it's a tremendous benefit to me to do that but if I'm only in it for me it's going to fail every time but I do benefit from it Amen brother B said check find your objective and test your motive what is your objective that's your goal it's your true purpose and it's your desired impact so what do you want to happen as a as a as a preacher as a minister my objective cannot be to make the people shout it cannot be to have the altar full of people it has to be Lord that your word would find good ground and produce life because if all we're looking for is the appearance then we'll be satisfied with anything but if we're looking for the real thing then we know that comes with patience it comes with the hard work of sewing and watering and then reaping amen I can't force God I had a brother say one time we had a tremendous service and he said say wait till the next service and something struck me wrong about what he said and I said well I'm just going to I just want to see what happens and you know what that next service flopped and this is just me I felt there was an arrogance behind it God showed me what's going to happen here's what's going to happen I know what's going to and you know what nothing happened it's not about me it's not about the ministry it's about the God that's work working in US it has to be amen objective goal the true purpose what you really want to happen the desired impact then the motive is the reason behind your request why do you want this why do you want it to happen simple example pick on our singers and musicians this morning you say Lord should I sing a song in service on Sunday and you pray about it you pray about it and the Lord said and you feel that the Lord wants you to sing a song remember we're supposed to use our gifts as we're led to use them amen but let's not get so spiritual we never use them but the Lord hasn't shown me to do it start seeking because he doesn't give us a gift so we don't use it then seek his time seek his his his way of doing these things so God's shown you his will his will is for you to sing a song he wants you to go up there amen but now you're supposed to check what's behind that question why did you say Lord should I sing a song on Sunday amen what's your objective what do you want to happen if if you sing do you want people to give you compliments do you want want to show somebody up do you want to get in the spotlight do you want to attract a young man or a young woman do you want to put it up on social media so you can get lots of likes if that's your objective guess what's going to happen probably all of those things and nothing of Eternal benefit or god'll just let you flop amen but if your objective is to glorify him to testify to thank to give him the preeminence to encourage to set an atmosphere now you've got the right objective don't you but now he says what's your motive what are you as you know why are you asking God if you should sing is it because you want recognition is it because you're trying to show somebody up is it because you want to be popular you want to be recognized or is it for the benefit of the body of Believers that are there because if you can say Lord you know my heart and say Lord I'm doing this for you cuz guess what it it ain't always easy to get up here some people do it really easily and some don't and there's a real sacrifice that comes behind those things but you say Lord I'm in it because you want me to do it because a lot of times you'll find with these gifts is that they don't really want to they don't always feel up to it I hope sister Marine's okay with me saying this but she's had times where she didn't feel she should be up there but the Lord told her to do it and so she did it and it was a tremendous blessing there's a blessing in obedience Church absolutely we don't always feel anointed but if we're in in under his call then we know that it's going to happen amen gifts are not about perfection unless you're prophesying prophecy has to be perfect but gifts are not about perfection gifts are about anointing and it's anointing on the giver and it's an anointing on the receiver and if they're both anointed then something something Supernatural is going to happen and then because it's God that's working now it's a vessel that's yielded amen when you you're you're coming in God's will and you're in God's Channel and you're and you're setting yourself aside and you've got the right m an objective that's when God can really use people amen I don't know if you've noticed this but not every special song is perfect sometimes people cry a lot when they sing right sister Priscilla she beats herself up about it sometimes those are the greatest blessings we have is that heart that says I'll praise you I'll Trust you I'll worship you even in the midst of the storm even when the battle's Raging even when the answer doesn't seem to be there amen it's not about perfection it's about anointing it's about surrender amen that's what it is the thing to check is what brother Bram saying here is what is your purpose in the kingdom of God for doing what you're doing because if there's no Kingdom Purpose why are we doing it in the first place Brothers your kingdom purpose is to provide for your family but it needs to be according to God's will we get educated according to God's will or we don't according to God's will there are things we have to do but let's not let's not just make it about a job let's not just make it about an education let's not just make it about a career or a house or these things but say Lord how would you glorify your kingdom and your people with what I'm about to do when we bought our house we bought a bigger house than I ever wanted for the specific reason that we knew that we were going to have to open it up for Fellowship not that we had to it's not that we didn't want to but we literally bought the house we did for the sake of having people over cuz otherwise i' I prefer a smaller one it's easier to clean easier to maintain and it's cheaper to buy as well but we bought it with the intent of using it for the sake of the body not just for ourselves amen the question is does it glorify God or does it glorify you and if it's all about you walk away very very quickly lay it down lay it down that's really what we do amen listen when God is truly using men and women it brings attention and the thing is what do you do with that attention what do you do with that influence what do you do with that Spotlight do you point it right back to him or do you leverage it for yourself that's easy way it's an easy way to look at it brother puts it this way we're almost done he says then what's your objective in doing it if it's selfish you'll never get it done that's all he says it's got to be real Clean and Clear before God or it just won't happen that's all he says you have to always keep that on your mind that it's got to be clean and clear your cups must be clean and clear before God or God cannot work with you now see that can feel like a lot of pressure we can we can put that into this sphere of perfection we can work ourselves into a place that we won't make a decision because we're scared that things aren't perfect or things aren't perfectly clean or clear and then we get paralyzed and the problem with that is that it's fear that's doing that and fear is never of God that's not that's not righteous fear that's that's satanic fear that holds you in a place where you can't make a decision you can't move God's not looking to put us under his thumb God's just asking us to yield to him that's all he's looking for amen God looks at the heart that's the beauty of all this God looks at the heart God looks at the Integrity of the heart where remember what he said to Solomon he said if you'll walk before me as your father David did in Integrity of heart he didn't say David was perfect David was clearly not perfect murdered another man for his wife he numbered Israel caused the death of what 25,000 people David was not perfect but in his heart God said he's just like me there's an Integrity there's a sincerity there's an honesty there there's a purity of purpose in David's heart that lets me know that he loves me even when he makes mistakes amen that's what God's looking at remember what brother Bram said if we in sincerity make a wrong decision God will come right around and he'll say no no no come over here do this let's fix this up this isn't quite what I was looking for and then we don't always go to our kids if we see our kid I've told the story many times of one of my children who shall not be named who wrote Love in the side of the car with a rock what do you do with that in sincerity and integrity of heart that person that young child who knew no better wrote it so did I take that person over my knee and just beat the living toar out of them no what did I say Daddy's glad you love him just don't ride it on the car with a rock anymore right in sincerity they did it and in Integrity of heart I responded the way that I knew they meant it just said let's not do that anymore let's not do that anymore and they didn't they didn't God wants to be with us church he wants to work with us he wants to work through us he's not seeking to punish us he's just looking for yielded vessels people that'll seek Him daily da people that will commune with him daily people that will invite him in Daily and in that we'll find his will for our lives he promises it if you seek me you'll find me when you seek me with your whole heart I'll show you a plain path amen one last quote as we close the musicians can come he says so we really believe that God never changes his mind about what he said he always keeps it true but he has a permissive will now there is where the trouble is we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive will to work out together to glorify his perfect will amen even balam and his Disobedience could only bless Israel with his prophetic gift but then he used his knowledge of their weakness to come in and what get an angle that they couldn't protect against that's where he lost it he says there is nothing will go wrong with God you say Brother John I know I made mistakes and I'm scared I'm going to keep making them he says there is nothing will go wrong with God he knows just where the clock is ticking at tonight there's nothing wrong look at your life look at your situations Church let's stand together if we would look at your situations and say it doesn't look right and you're wondering do I am I in his will am I not it seems like I'm not it seems like I'm struggling more than I'm winning it seems like I'm defeated more than I'm inct Victory he says there's nothing will go wrong with God he knows just where the clock is ticking at tonight there's nothing wrong he says every lick is hitting just the way exactly it should be everything he says we think it's wrong but he knows it's right it's supposed to be like this amen we take some inventory this morning how many's facing a battle how many's in a struggle this morning 10 of us the rest of you are going to be in one very shortly then but we struggle we fight we seek we ask we knock we pray we plead it seems like things just spiral so many times that's the trial of our faith it's a very it's the very foundation of the believer if you remember his faith then to you had virtue strength to hold on strength to hold to what he's given you amen but he says every lick is hitting just exactly the way it should be we think it's wrong but he knows it's right why he's got it all in control he sees the way this is going I think that's the reason that Satan thinks he can win is because it looks like he's winning more than he's losing and then what happens is God finally comes down and he says enough is enough and magically Satan has no power anymore he has no access anymore and the thing that you thought would hold you down cannot even be seen remember what the scripture talks about when we finally look at Satan in his Incarnation says we're going to look narrowly on him and say is this the man is this the thing that we were so scared of about cuz he's just a puny little shriveled up little weasel and the youngest weakest Christian has more than enough strength by the Holy Ghost to defeat that devil but we got to fight be brave against all evil never run or even lag behind if we would win for God in the right keep on the firing line amen I'm encouraging you this morning keep on the firing line even when it looks like nothing's happening say Lord I believe you Lord I trust you I'm your child you're in the situation amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord what Comfort we can take this morning Lord that even when it looks like it's not right when it looks wrong when it looks unchanging Lord yet you're in it and you're working and you'll bring it to that expected end Lord Lord you have good thoughts towards your children you have good thoughts towards your bride Lord You've clothed her you presented her with your word Lord you've given her the mind of Christ Lord and if she can only lay hold onto it this morning Lord by Faith Lord by the power of the Holy Ghost Lord to just trust you and believe Lord to stand still and see the salvation of God lord to know that you are real and you're a rewarder of them that diligently seek you Lord I pray you help us Lord be diligent Lord help us to be serious about this Lord let our time let our energy reflect Lord that we're seeking a kingdom that is to come Heavenly Father Lord I pray for each soul I pray for each person in here this morning Lord you see the needs Lord you see the sickness Lord you see the trials you see the struggles you see the hardships you see the disappointments Lord God I pray you lift us up this morning Lord by Your Word Lord touch your people we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen he's got it all in control 11:16 he's got it all in control he's got it all in control for he's put that reassurance way down in my soul [Laughter] he's got it all in control my father knows what I [Music] need my father knows what I need so in everything I go through he knows what's better for me my father knows what I [Music] need and I put my life in his [Music] hands I put my life in his
