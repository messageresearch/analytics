[36:12] lord speaking through us
[36:14] lord loving through us encouraging
[36:16] through us lord spreading mercy and
[36:18] grace through us lord
[36:19] we pray that you would just minister

[36:26] your people just be able to receive what
[36:28] said lord grant me grace to say it as
[36:30] you would have it said lord god
[36:32] lord touch our lives we pray lord
[36:33] remembering the many services going on
[36:35] this morning lord the ministries that
[36:37] are coming forth lord may you just
[36:39] anoint them powerfully to speak lord to
[36:41] draw your bride just that much closer to
[36:43] you heavenly father lord clothe us with
[36:46] your word we pray have your way in your
[36:48] people we ask in jesus christ's name we
[36:50] pray
[36:51] amen amen god bless you thank you
[36:53] musicians if you turn the scriptures to
[36:55] genesis chapter 3.
[36:57] genesis chapter 3 amen
[37:00] welcome each one here this morning
[37:02] appreciate the deacons doing the work to
[37:04] get us through the vaccine check-ins and
[37:06] all these different things and uh it's
[37:09] good to see each one that's here this
[37:10] morning and then i had a lot of feedback
[37:12] on the last service certainly appreciate
[37:14] it i had it from young and old men and
[37:16] women alike amen and uh i appreciate it
[37:20] when people come and talk to me and and
[37:21] whether it's good or bad or whether
[37:23] they're unsure or sure and then
[37:25] certainly like to have people talk to me
[37:26] about it and let me know what's going on
[37:28] amen the thing is this this is a house
[37:30] of correction
[37:32] now we look at correction in such a
[37:33] negative light but the first line of
[37:35] correction is always instruction and men
[37:37] and we're not responsible for something
[37:38] until we hear it but once we hear it now
[37:40] we're responsible for it so when we take
[37:42] a service like that it is not given as a
[37:44] correction in order to to spank somebody
[37:46] or to single anybody out but rather it's
[37:48] to show us what the word says and then
[37:50] we can come in line with it amen we're
[37:52] not responsible for what we don't know
[37:54] but once we hear it then god holds us
[37:56] responsible for him and we've got a lot
[37:57] of young people in this church by god's
[37:59] grace and they need to hear these things
[38:01] our young men need to hear it our young
[38:03] women need to hear it amen and the
[38:05] olders too the olders all had lots of
[38:06] feedback and and talking about the ways
[38:08] it impacted them amen we did we never
[38:11] stopped growing we never stopped
[38:12] learning we never stopped changing amen
[38:14] into the glory of christ so these
[38:16] services are are direct in many ways
[38:19] and if you can just take it as the word
[38:21] says it and if you feel i'm off a little
[38:23] bit then grant me a bit of grace amen
[38:25] and hopefully the lord can speak through
[38:27] it amen genesis 3 verse 17 says and unto
[38:30] adam he said because thou has hearkened
[38:32] unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten
[38:34] of the tree of which i commanded thee
[38:36] saying thou shalt not eat of it curse it
[38:38] is the ground for thy sake in sorrow
[38:41] shalt that eat of it all the days of thy
[38:44] life
[38:44] thorns also and thistle shall it bring
[38:46] forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the
[38:49] herb of the ground in the sweat of thy
[38:51] face shalt thou eat bread till thou
[38:53] return unto the ground for out of it
[38:56] wast thou taken for dust thou art and
[38:58] unto dust shalt thou return amen god is
[39:02] blessing to the word you may have your
[39:04] seats this morning and then we're
[39:05] continuing on our series on that kingdom
[39:07] come and i want to continue to focus on
[39:09] the men today and i want to take a title
[39:11] of christ-like provision amen
[39:13] christ-like provision remember the
[39:15] kingdom of heaven the kingdom of god is
[39:18] within us i mean this is not something
[39:20] that we're looking to to experience on
[39:22] this earth in this timeline that we're
[39:23] here in this age amen we're peculiar
[39:26] people on this earth and that's because
[39:28] we have a power within us that makes us
[39:30] live differently than people that allows
[39:32] us to not be influenced by the world
[39:34] we're not here to take power we're not
[39:36] going to rule and reign as we will in
[39:37] the millennium amen this is a time for
[39:39] us to be shaped to have our character
[39:41] molded for us to be tried for us to be
[39:43] proven and is for us to overcome our
[39:45] flesh and overcome what satan throws at
[39:46] us in this time amen
[39:49] john said this he says i write unto you
[39:52] fathers because you have known him that
[39:54] is from the beginning i write unto you
[39:57] young men because ye have overcome the
[39:59] wicked one i think that's a beautiful
[40:01] scripture we we spoke to the young men
[40:03] in the last service and john says i'm
[40:05] speaking to you young men because you
[40:07] have overcome that's not just because
[40:09] they did then that's a prophetic voice
[40:10] speaking to the future generations
[40:12] saying you have overcome amen it's a
[40:14] finished work for you and though we
[40:16] struggle and we strive and we have
[40:18] difficulties and we fail and these
[40:20] different things yet john's saying you
[40:21] have overcome him and greater is he that
[40:23] is in you than he that is in the world
[40:25] amen you have a you have a call in your
[40:27] life to be an overcomer and you have
[40:29] overcome in god's eyes and we're just
[40:31] going through time here to prove it he
[40:33] says i write unto you little children
[40:35] because you have known the father i have
[40:37] written unto you fathers because because
[40:39] you have known him that is from the
[40:40] beginning i have written unto you young
[40:42] men again because ye are strong and the
[40:46] word of god abideth in you and you have
[40:49] overcome the wicked one amen that's a
[40:50] promise i want to take in my life amen
[40:52] that's the promise each one of us should
[40:54] have is that what the word of god
[40:55] abideth in us and we have overcome the
[40:58] wicked one amen again this is a prophecy
[41:00] not just a declaration for that day love
[41:03] not the world neither the things that
[41:05] are in the world if any man love the
[41:08] world the love of the father is not in
[41:11] him amen amen so when we talk about the
[41:13] kingdom of god coming the kingdom of god
[41:15] coming in power even it is not just
[41:17] looking ahead to the day when christ
[41:18] comes back with his saints and clouds of
[41:20] glory and we come back for a millennial
[41:22] reign but we're talking about what the
[41:24] kingdom of god being displayed in our
[41:26] lives today with overcoming power so
[41:28] that satan has no influence on us while
[41:30] we are here the power of god the holy
[41:32] spirit that has sealed our soul is so
[41:34] powerful that satan is is completely
[41:36] bound in our lives amen that's what
[41:38] we're looking for that's the completion
[41:39] of our faith is when satan has no
[41:41] influence on us amen when god is so
[41:43] completely in control on us that we can
[41:46] influence the world at best but they
[41:48] cannot influence us amen that the word
[41:50] has put up a barrier and satan can't
[41:51] pass through that barrier in our lives
[41:54] amen but we know it's a battle every day
[41:56] it's a battle to express it's not just
[41:58] cruising through life but it's a
[41:59] struggle because satan's trying to punch
[42:01] us and hit us every day of our lives to
[42:03] try and get us off of the word amen
[42:05] so with that in mind we want to dive
[42:06] into a bit of a deeper look at this
[42:08] great attribute that god has assigned to
[42:10] the men and it's a critical attribute
[42:12] it's perhaps the greatest attribute and
[42:13] it is that of the provider and then i
[42:15] said in the last service how god has
[42:17] taken the man and he's taken the woman
[42:19] and he's given them different roles and
[42:20] different responsibilities and when we
[42:22] talked about the man we said the key the
[42:25] the key principle here is that he acts
[42:26] as christ as in his love towards his
[42:29] wife his love towards his family is
[42:31] christ-like which means it is first and
[42:33] foremost sacrificial and second it is
[42:35] provisional it means that he may he what
[42:37] he puts himself at at their
[42:40] he sacrifices himself for their good and
[42:42] in that he makes a way for them to have
[42:44] what they have need of amen amen so the
[42:46] man is always to act christ-like to the
[42:48] woman if christ wouldn't do it to us we
[42:50] shouldn't do it to the people that are
[42:52] under our authority amen
[42:54] and we talked about how he still doesn't
[42:56] replace god he acts like god
[42:58] right he has been placed in the position
[43:00] of headship but he acts as god but he
[43:01] doesn't replace god amen we said a man
[43:04] cannot heal you a man cannot redeem you
[43:06] a man cannot save you a man cannot
[43:07] deliver you in and of himself but it is
[43:09] only through god using him that he can
[43:11] have even any influence in those things
[43:13] and it's still god that does it amen
[43:16] amen so i want to talk about first
[43:18] before we get into men as a provider we
[43:20] want to look to the great provider amen
[43:22] and that is jehovah jireh amen that
[43:24] jehovah jireh means the lord who sees
[43:27] and we say that that's a beautiful thing
[43:29] but it's not just the lord who sees it
[43:31] is the lord who will see to it amen so
[43:34] he will see the need and he will make a
[43:36] way for that need to be met amen he is
[43:38] not just forward-looking he doesn't just
[43:40] have foresight he doesn't just have
[43:41] understanding but he has a will and he
[43:43] has a way to meet the need that he sees
[43:45] coming up amen and he doesn't see it
[43:47] when it happens he sees it before it
[43:49] happens and he makes a provision for
[43:51] that need before we ever ask him for it
[43:53] amen amen what is it we know that god
[43:55] sees everything in our life and he's
[43:57] bringing all things together for our
[43:59] good and he has made a way he has made a
[44:01] provision to meet every need that we
[44:03] have and we want to take this into the
[44:05] scriptures and there's perhaps dozens
[44:07] maybe hundreds of scriptures that talk
[44:08] about god our provider i've just picked
[44:10] a few here but i want to take it all the
[44:12] way back to genesis because we see
[44:14] jehovah jireh in action as soon as man
[44:16] sins that's the first time he comes in
[44:18] in a new way and he shows himself to be
[44:20] jehovah gyra so if we look at genesis 3
[44:22] 7 it says and this is right after adam
[44:25] and eve adam and the woman sinned and it
[44:26] says and the eyes of them both were
[44:28] opened and they knew that they were
[44:31] naked and they sowed fig leaves together
[44:34] and made themselves aprons
[44:36] this is man's first attempt at provision
[44:38] as soon as he sins he tries to step into
[44:41] a place of provision what does he do he
[44:42] makes something that is ineffective and
[44:44] temporary amen that is his way of doing
[44:47] it he knows that something has to be
[44:49] done he knows that there's a need there
[44:51] and he does the best that he can with
[44:53] what he has but we know it wasn't enough
[44:56] right we know it wasn't enough that adam
[44:57] and eve did what they could but it
[44:59] wasn't enough and when they had
[45:01] when they saw that something had to be
[45:03] done they took it on themselves to make
[45:04] it happen
[45:05] and then that's the human condition is
[45:07] we see the need and we say i've got to
[45:09] take care of the need
[45:11] but it's rarely effective because why
[45:13] we're we're in a fallen condition now
[45:16] and we can't have a supernatural effect
[45:17] in a fallen condition amen the first
[45:20] action after sin was to try and handle
[45:22] the situation our own way and it didn't
[45:24] work did it but after god pronounces
[45:26] judgment on the man and the woman he
[45:28] doesn't just send them away empty-handed
[45:30] right he doesn't just say all right you
[45:32] sinned get out of my sight you have
[45:33] nothing i'm not going to deal with you
[45:35] anymore you're on your own you live you
[45:37] live you die you die it doesn't matter
[45:38] but no we see jehovah jairus step in
[45:40] here in genesis 3 21 and he says unto
[45:43] adam also and to his wife did the lord
[45:46] god make coats of skins and clothe them
[45:50] now they originally made aprons of
[45:51] leaves now i don't know about you but as
[45:52] far as i know leaves don't last very
[45:54] long
[45:55] right very ineffective to what was going
[45:57] to be a life of toil and sweat and
[46:00] struggle and striving leaves aren't
[46:01] going to last long they're going to curl
[46:02] up they're going to die they're going to
[46:04] get brittle and then it's not going to
[46:06] give them the covering that they need
[46:07] for the work that's ahead of them but
[46:09] god comes down and he's supernaturally
[46:11] he divinely provides a covering for them
[46:13] that will give them some longevity but
[46:15] this isn't just a practical solution
[46:17] amen they needed a covering for their
[46:19] sin
[46:20] and the thing is they didn't know they
[46:22] needed it they didn't know they needed
[46:24] it that's why they tried to do leaves
[46:25] they were trying to cover their
[46:26] nakedness but it wasn't their nakedness
[46:28] that was the problem it was the sin that
[46:30] opened their eyes to that negative to
[46:31] that nakedness that had to be addressed
[46:33] so they had need to have a covering for
[46:35] their sin not just their nakedness it
[46:37] was their understanding that said they
[46:39] were naked but it was sin that kept them
[46:40] out of the presence of god moving
[46:42] forward so they had to have a covering
[46:44] for their sin amen they needed there
[46:47] needed to be a death that day and god
[46:49] said something has to die because they
[46:51] were supposed to be death that day says
[46:53] the day you eat thereof is the day you
[46:54] die something's got to die that day and
[46:56] what did god do he went and he took a
[46:58] lamb he took an innocent animal and he
[47:00] killed it and said that death will be
[47:02] yours for today and in that it will
[47:04] cover your sin and now you can actually
[47:06] approach me now you won't die as soon as
[47:08] you step into my presence the next time
[47:10] the next time that you talk to me i
[47:11] can't i won't judge you because i've
[47:12] judged you through the innocent life
[47:14] that's covering you right now amen what
[47:16] was it he saw the problem and he
[47:17] provided the need so that they could go
[47:19] out and live until he could come and
[47:20] redeem them back a final time amen
[47:23] brother braham says this he says now
[47:24] notice when adam his fig leaves were all
[47:27] right as long as he didn't have to face
[47:29] god
[47:30] but when he had to face god he realized
[47:33] his fig leaves was no good
[47:35] and now friend you might think you're a
[47:37] pretty good person see and you might be
[47:40] that's right but when you come to face
[47:42] god if you haven't accepted god's
[47:44] provided sacrifice for you you're lost
[47:47] and you'll know it
[47:48] amen you'll hear stories of people that
[47:50] are on their deathbed and they may have
[47:51] been professing christians all their
[47:53] life and they get to their death bed and
[47:55] what happens they start panicking
[47:56] because they realize that i don't have
[47:58] what i'm supposed to have i don't have a
[48:00] peace i don't have a rest i don't have a
[48:02] closeness to god and so they start to
[48:04] freak out because they realize that
[48:05] they're missing something and they're
[48:06] about to face god and they can't face
[48:08] him in that condition and so they start
[48:10] trying to do whatever it is that takes
[48:12] them and gives them peace
[48:14] but says in another way he says now we
[48:15] know the word religion means a covering
[48:18] and adam instead of saying god cover me
[48:23] catch that adam should have went and
[48:25] said i'm naked lord can you cover me he
[48:27] says no no no he didn't say that he made
[48:29] himself some aprons out of fig leaves he
[48:32] and eve and they worked all right as
[48:34] long as god wasn't around but when they
[48:36] come in the presence of god they realize
[48:38] that their fig leaf religion wouldn't
[48:40] work and brother there's so much of that
[48:42] today too i'm afraid that you're going
[48:45] to find the same thing when god comes
[48:46] again that homemade fig leaf religion
[48:49] won't stand in the presence of god god
[48:51] had to make a covering for them amen god
[48:55] has a provided way and we've got to come
[48:57] by that way brother brahm says in that
[48:59] message god has a provided way he says
[49:01] there's only one way provided and if you
[49:02] don't come by it will never work there's
[49:05] only one way that god's done it amen so
[49:06] when we try and do it our way rather
[49:08] than god's way what is it he says it's a
[49:10] fig leaf religion and it won't survive
[49:12] it won't stand in the day that we stand
[49:14] before god and what we don't remember
[49:16] and what we don't realize sometimes is
[49:18] that when we do it god's way we're not
[49:20] just doing it his way and it's obedience
[49:21] and therefore it's good but that it
[49:22] gives us protection it gives us access
[49:25] it gives us rest it gives us strength it
[49:27] gives us a place to to what claim the
[49:29] word for our lives because we're in
[49:32] obedience we don't realize until we're
[49:33] out of it that there was something in it
[49:35] that we missed that we didn't realize
[49:37] was in our lives all along because we
[49:39] are in accordance with the word amen
[49:41] amen so god was the great provider here
[49:43] in eden even as he's kicking them out of
[49:45] eden even as he's putting them away from
[49:47] eternal life yet he is the great
[49:48] provider because he's made a way for
[49:50] them to still approach him moving
[49:52] forward amen
[49:53] but we see the first time that the word
[49:55] jehovah jireh has ever used is when
[49:57] abraham is about to sacrifice isaac and
[49:59] he's got the knife up here and he comes
[50:01] to stab isaac he
[50:03] god tells him to kill his son as a test
[50:05] and the knife's about to go down he puts
[50:07] his weight into it and what happens is
[50:09] the angel stays his hand and says stop
[50:11] and then what what happens is and
[50:13] abraham lifted up his eyes and looked
[50:15] and behold behind him a ram caught in a
[50:18] thicket by his horns and abraham went
[50:21] and took the ram and offered him up for
[50:23] a burnt offering in the stead of his son
[50:25] and abraham called the name of that
[50:27] place jehovah jireh as it is said to
[50:30] this day in the mount of the lord it
[50:32] shall be seen that's where we first see
[50:34] this redemptive name of god as jehovah
[50:37] jireh the god who sees and what the god
[50:39] who will see to it amen god was jehovah
[50:42] jireh first in the beginning what did he
[50:44] do he provided a lamb to cover them and
[50:46] then we see him come around with abraham
[50:47] and he provides what a ram again a male
[50:50] substitute a male clean lamb it was a
[50:52] type of christ that was there again in
[50:54] foreshadowing what he was going to do at
[50:57] calvary amen god's perfect isn't it he
[50:59] started it in the first way and then he
[51:01] comes to abraham and he confirms it and
[51:02] then he comes as christ in the end and
[51:04] he does it in in his own body and a body
[51:06] prepare for him and he gives his life is
[51:07] that perfect sacrifice for us amen that
[51:10] jehovah jireh is a redemptive blessing
[51:12] amen to us is that he provides the need
[51:14] he sees it and he provides the need amen
[51:17] and he's constant
[51:19] god is constant in this in this
[51:20] attribute he's constant in his provision
[51:22] he's constant in his understanding in
[51:24] his scene our needs and he is constant
[51:26] in providing the needs that we have amen
[51:28] i find it interesting i was listening to
[51:30] um greater than solomon is here um and
[51:32] brother branham said you know we've got
[51:34] we talk about the god of abraham and
[51:36] isaac and jacob
[51:38] he says it's no good if it's just for
[51:39] abraham isaac and jacob amen we need to
[51:41] have a god of jonathan corlett we need
[51:43] to have a god of ellie colombo amen we
[51:45] need to have a god of sandy curlette we
[51:47] need to be able to say that he is not
[51:48] just a god of the past but he is a god
[51:50] of my needs here's jehovah jireh to me
[51:53] he is the god that sees my need he sees
[51:55] my family he sees my situation and he's
[51:57] going to see to it that the need is met
[51:59] amen
[52:01] amen so when we stop start talking about
[52:03] providing or working to live and survive
[52:05] even to prosper in this world we do not
[52:07] look to ourselves for that as men we
[52:09] cannot look to ourselves to even be the
[52:11] one that does that but rather whatever
[52:13] role we find ourselves we do not look to
[52:15] ourselves as the ultimate provider but
[52:17] we look to jehovah jireh as the great
[52:19] provider amen
[52:21] so what it must always be god that we're
[52:23] relying on not on the arms of flesh not
[52:25] on the intellect not on our education
[52:27] not on our experience but we look to god
[52:29] and we say god you are the one that has
[52:30] made the promise you are the one that
[52:32] has said that you will meet all of my
[52:34] needs and on that basis i'm keeping
[52:36] myself under your headship under your
[52:38] word and in that now i can hold on to
[52:40] the promise that you're going to be the
[52:41] great provider for my family and for my
[52:43] situation amen amen i want to read a
[52:46] number of scriptures here that talk to
[52:47] us about the provision of god as an
[52:49] encouragement amen because when we get
[52:51] into situations we need to remember who
[52:54] is our great provider who we are looking
[52:56] to amen if you're a wife if you're a
[52:58] daughter whatever it might be and you
[52:59] say you know it's not working dad
[53:01] doesn't have this ability dad's not able
[53:03] to provide my husband's not able to
[53:04] provide are you looking to your husband
[53:06] or your father are you looking to the
[53:08] great father the great provider amen
[53:11] so paul says this he says in philippians
[53:13] 4 19 but my god shall supply
[53:16] all your need
[53:20] we could stop right here and why would i
[53:22] ever read another scripture because that
[53:24] is all-encompassing but my god shall
[53:26] supply all your need according to his
[53:29] riches in glory
[53:30] by whom
[53:32] by christ jesus
[53:34] so let me put it this way but my god
[53:35] shall supply all your need by christ
[53:38] jesus who is christ jesus he is our
[53:40] bridegroom and he is our husband amen
[53:42] what is he doing he's saying you have a
[53:44] great provider that is a relation to you
[53:46] and he is the one that provides all of
[53:48] your needs amen
[53:49] [Music]
[53:51] psalms 23 1. david says the lord is my
[53:53] shepherd i shall not want that means i
[53:56] shall not lack anything i need and i
[54:00] will not diminish under his provision
[54:03] that the working and provision of god
[54:05] will not decrease me but it will grow me
[54:08] it will strengthen me it will bring
[54:09] forth fruit it has a positive effect
[54:12] always now he'll trim us down won't he
[54:15] but god will be what manifested in his
[54:18] provision for us and through us amen
[54:21] david says in psalm 37 he says the steps
[54:23] of a good man are ordered by the lord
[54:25] and he delighteth in his way though he
[54:27] fall he shall not be utterly cast down i
[54:30] thought he was good why is he falling
[54:33] right why is he falling if he's good
[54:35] because he's in human flesh amen we all
[54:37] make mistakes let us take comfort that
[54:38] when we make mistakes that he will what
[54:41] the lord upholdeth him with his hand and
[54:43] then what's he going to do he's going to
[54:44] lift him up out of where he fell he's
[54:46] going to set him on the right path and
[54:47] he's going to keep him moving forward
[54:49] david said i have been young and now am
[54:51] old yet have i not seen the righteous
[54:54] forsaken nor his seed begging bread he
[54:58] is ever merciful and lendeth and his
[55:01] seed is blessed
[55:03] paul says let your conversation be
[55:05] without covetousness and be content with
[55:08] such things as you have for he has said
[55:10] i will never leave thee nor forsake thee
[55:14] david says in psalm 16 the lord is the
[55:16] portion of mine inheritance and of my
[55:18] cup
[55:19] thou maintainest my lot
[55:21] amen what that means is lord you hold on
[55:24] to what is for me and you keep it safe
[55:26] and you give it to me as i have need of
[55:29] psalms 84 says for the lord god is a son
[55:33] and a shield what is the sun required
[55:36] for growth what is the shield required
[55:38] for protection
[55:39] the lord will give grace and glory no
[55:42] good thing will he withhold from them
[55:45] that walk uprightly
[55:46] o lord of hosts blessed is the man that
[55:49] trusteth in thee
[55:52] peter says this grace and peace be
[55:54] multiplied unto you through the
[55:55] knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
[55:58] according as his divine power had given
[56:00] unto us all
[56:02] things
[56:03] all things that pertain unto what just
[56:07] the spiritual
[56:09] he says all things that pertain unto
[56:11] life
[56:12] that's this life
[56:14] and godliness amen we have a provision
[56:17] for our carnal needs here for the body
[56:19] that we're in for the attributes that
[56:20] need to be corrected and changed for the
[56:22] things that need to be grown in our life
[56:24] he says i made a provision for all the
[56:25] godliness part but listen you're still
[56:27] living on this earth and i have made a
[56:29] provision for your life as well
[56:32] amen god sees what we are he is not
[56:34] somebody that can't be touched by our
[56:36] infirmities amen he knows what it's like
[56:38] to be human and he says i've made a
[56:40] provision for life and godliness through
[56:43] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[56:44] to glory and virtue whereby are given
[56:47] unto us
[56:48] great and precious promises that by
[56:51] these ye might be partakers of the
[56:53] divine nature
[56:55] having escaped the corruption that is in
[56:57] the world through lust
[56:58] amen when i read all those all i say is
[57:01] where's my portion in this
[57:03] there there's nothing here that i can
[57:04] add to this when he's provided all of my
[57:07] needs then what is my portion
[57:09] my portion is to take it and only step
[57:12] into the role and expect him to keep
[57:13] feeding it through me amen that as he
[57:15] gives it to me i can give it to those
[57:17] that rely on me and as he gives it to
[57:19] you that you can give it to those that
[57:20] rely on you and if you're under somebody
[57:22] that's providing it that you can have
[57:23] trust that you'll receive what you have
[57:25] need of amen every need supplied as the
[57:27] song said amen amen amen so our reliance
[57:30] is in god now the curse on adam was that
[57:33] what you've got to work the ground and
[57:35] it's going to fight you
[57:37] so we have a curse that's working
[57:38] against us to keep us from doing what
[57:40] we're supposed to do so it's always
[57:42] going to be a struggle and if we don't
[57:44] look to the promise we're going to get
[57:45] down sometimes when it's not going so
[57:47] great amen but it is a curse that we're
[57:49] fighting against and the only time that
[57:51] curse is lifted is when we get off of
[57:53] this earth amen just because you have
[57:55] the holy ghost doesn't lift the curse
[57:56] off you that you're gonna have to work
[57:58] men you're gonna have to strive you're
[58:00] gonna have to struggle you're gonna have
[58:01] to toil you're gonna have to sweat
[58:02] you're gonna have to strain you're gonna
[58:03] have to to what kill yourself over time
[58:06] working to provide for your family
[58:09] and for the household of faith even as
[58:10] we get into that amen amen so the
[58:12] christ-like provider has to realize what
[58:15] what makes this provision possible is
[58:17] god not his own strength amen amen
[58:20] amen glory now there's a very simple
[58:22] process to be under god's provision and
[58:24] that is one thing stay with the word
[58:26] amen we've seen it from genesis to
[58:28] revelation stay with the word and god's
[58:29] provision is guaranteed
[58:32] now he didn't say we'd have all of our
[58:33] wants he didn't say we'd have all the
[58:35] clothes we want the greatest cars the
[58:36] biggest houses the best vacations
[58:39] amen he didn't promise us that but he
[58:40] says i'll meet your needs amen you know
[58:43] remember what david said i've never seen
[58:44] the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[58:47] begging bread didn't say we'd have steak
[58:49] every night
[58:50] right fried chicken
[58:52] whatever it might be the thing that you
[58:53] like most but he says he'd never be
[58:55] begging bread and then he'd always make
[58:56] a way provided for us
[58:58] listen to what jesus said okay we've
[59:00] talked from peter's standpoint from
[59:01] paul's standpoint david's standpoint
[59:03] let's take it back to jesus own words on
[59:05] earth where he says why take ye thought
[59:07] for raiment for clothes consider the
[59:10] lilies of the field how they grow they
[59:12] toil not neither do they spin
[59:15] and yet i say unto you that even solomon
[59:17] in all his glory was not arrayed like
[59:19] one of these wherefore if god so clothed
[59:22] the grass of the field which today is
[59:24] and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall
[59:26] he not much more clothe you oh ye of
[59:29] little faith
[59:30] amen notice when you doubt it god says
[59:31] why are you doubting where's your faith
[59:33] listen i've got the whole earth covered
[59:35] i've got a provision for them you're
[59:37] much more important to me than them so
[59:39] why are you doubting that i can't take
[59:41] care of you
[59:42] he says therefore take no thought saying
[59:44] what shall we eat or shall we drink or
[59:47] where with all shall we be clothed
[59:50] for these for after all these things to
[59:52] the gentile seek now catch that because
[59:54] this is a gentile problem we're gentiles
[59:57] so this is a gentile problem
[59:59] he says it's a worldly problem a worldly
[1:00:01] influence jesus is talking to who the
[1:00:04] elect the members of the kingdom of
[1:00:05] heaven and saying you are not like the
[1:00:07] gentiles you're not supposed to be going
[1:00:09] around wondering who's going to provide
[1:00:11] for you tomorrow don't get caught up in
[1:00:13] this this is a heathen thing right don't
[1:00:15] get caught up into how am i going to
[1:00:16] make ends meet tomorrow or this day or
[1:00:18] that way now he's not saying don't plan
[1:00:19] but he's saying don't worry about it
[1:00:22] right don't get caught up on it don't
[1:00:23] let it keep you up at night because why
[1:00:25] your father in heaven is the one that
[1:00:27] does it it's something the rest of the
[1:00:29] world has to worry about but you're my
[1:00:30] children you don't have to worry about
[1:00:32] this i've said i'll take care of it
[1:00:34] he says for after all these things do
[1:00:36] the gentiles seek for your heavenly
[1:00:37] father knoweth that ye have need of all
[1:00:40] these things what things clothes
[1:00:43] food
[1:00:44] a roof over your head he says look god
[1:00:47] knows that you've got to have these
[1:00:48] things
[1:00:49] he's not just interested in growing you
[1:00:51] spiritually but he knows you've got
[1:00:52] needs on this earth and he's there to
[1:00:54] provide them
[1:00:55] sometimes we diminish god and say he's
[1:00:57] only about spiritual growth but in that
[1:00:59] spiritual growth he has made a way for
[1:01:01] us to be provided for our natural needs
[1:01:03] amen and so when we get into natural
[1:01:05] needs we can say we have a provider
[1:01:07] the question is is he meeting our
[1:01:08] spiritual needs as well because if he's
[1:01:10] not meeting our spiritual needs he
[1:01:11] usually backs away from the natural
[1:01:12] needs as well
[1:01:14] amen
[1:01:15] he says take therefore no thought for
[1:01:17] the moral for the moral sorry seek ye
[1:01:20] first verse 33 but seek ye first the
[1:01:22] kingdom of god what's the what's the
[1:01:24] kingdom of god it's the holy spirit in
[1:01:26] you bringing forth christ the word
[1:01:29] so seek forth or seek first but the holy
[1:01:32] spirit making you live a christ-like
[1:01:34] life and his righteousness and all of
[1:01:37] these things shall be added unto you
[1:01:39] all of these things things for life and
[1:01:41] things for godliness for the carnal
[1:01:43] needs and for the spiritual needs
[1:01:45] what all these things will be added unto
[1:01:47] you
[1:01:48] take therefore no thought for the moral
[1:01:50] for the moral shall take thought for the
[1:01:51] things of itself sufficient unto the day
[1:01:54] is the evil thereof amen we've read
[1:01:57] multiple times when they did it when we
[1:01:58] did our series on the overcomers about
[1:02:00] how they were told to stay with the word
[1:02:02] meditate on it keep it in front of you
[1:02:04] keep it in front of you lot walk it talk
[1:02:06] it live it all these different things
[1:02:08] and when you do with it when you stay
[1:02:09] with that whole word of god then he gave
[1:02:11] them every promise that they have need
[1:02:12] of to have a land and meant to have a
[1:02:14] kingdom to have a place with their where
[1:02:15] they could raise their families
[1:02:17] the problem is is when things are going
[1:02:19] great then what happens to our zeal
[1:02:21] it tends to die off doesn't it when
[1:02:23] we're not fighting when we're not
[1:02:24] struggling when we're not growing then
[1:02:26] our zeal for god drops off
[1:02:28] why because we we're not thinking about
[1:02:30] him because we have everything we need
[1:02:33] amen but we've got to be seeking first
[1:02:34] the kingdom of god and saying lord what
[1:02:36] more do i need what more do i need to
[1:02:38] change lord what do you have to add and
[1:02:39] what do i have to take away to get you
[1:02:41] to do it and we open up our lives to him
[1:02:44] deuteronomy 8 says this and this is a
[1:02:46] warning to the children of israel beware
[1:02:48] that thou forget not the lord thy god in
[1:02:50] not keeping his commandments and his
[1:02:52] judgments and his statutes which i
[1:02:54] command thee this day
[1:02:55] lest when thou has eaten and are full
[1:02:57] and has built goodly houses and dwelt
[1:02:59] therein and when thy herds and their
[1:03:01] flocks multiply and thy silver and thy
[1:03:03] gold is multiplied and all that thou
[1:03:05] hast is multiplied in other words when
[1:03:07] the promise of god comes to pass
[1:03:09] look out
[1:03:10] amen he says then thine heart be lifted
[1:03:13] up and now forget the lord thy god which
[1:03:15] brought thee forth out of the land of
[1:03:16] egypt from the house of bondage who led
[1:03:19] thee through that great and terrible
[1:03:20] wilderness wherein were fiery serpents
[1:03:22] and scorpions and drought and where
[1:03:24] there was no water who brought thee
[1:03:26] forth water out of the rock of flint who
[1:03:28] fed thee in the wilderness with manna
[1:03:30] which thy fathers knew not that he might
[1:03:32] humble thee and that he might prove thee
[1:03:34] to do the good at thy ladder in
[1:03:37] all that difficulty he says was to do
[1:03:39] you good at the end
[1:03:41] amen
[1:03:42] but watch this this is the warning sorry
[1:03:44] my voice has been going
[1:03:46] and thou shalt say in thine heart my
[1:03:48] power and the might of mine hand has
[1:03:51] gotten me this wealth
[1:03:53] why because we've sweated and we've
[1:03:54] toiled and we've gone through the
[1:03:56] struggle and we've gone through the
[1:03:57] trial and what is it i deserve it i've
[1:03:59] done all the work therefore it makes
[1:04:01] sense that i have reaped a great reward
[1:04:03] he says no no no no no no this is me
[1:04:06] that did that
[1:04:07] but thou shalt remember the lord thy god
[1:04:09] for it is he that giveth the power to
[1:04:12] get wealth that he may establish his
[1:04:14] covenant which he swear unto thy fathers
[1:04:17] as it is this day amen amen so when
[1:04:21] things get tough when things get tough
[1:04:22] financially when things get tough with
[1:04:24] our careers when things get tough where
[1:04:26] we see that there's more month at the
[1:04:27] end of the paycheck than there is
[1:04:29] paycheck at the end of the month what do
[1:04:30] we have to do check up and say lord have
[1:04:33] i gotten slack lord are you just are you
[1:04:35] just bumping me a little bit to say hey
[1:04:37] buddy we haven't been talking so good
[1:04:39] anymore right you've been just cruising
[1:04:41] on your own
[1:04:42] lord is there something that i need to
[1:04:44] need to tighten up here lord do i need
[1:04:45] to get a little closer to my bridegroom
[1:04:48] amen and sometimes that's what he's
[1:04:50] doing but if we check up and we say lord
[1:04:52] my heart's open show me where i'm
[1:04:55] slacking show me if i'm off and we get
[1:04:57] nothing back and we give him time to
[1:04:59] answer mind you
[1:05:00] if we get nothing back then what can we
[1:05:02] say we can say that he is still working
[1:05:04] it for what to do the good at thy latter
[1:05:07] end because he brought them through
[1:05:09] scorpions he brought them through times
[1:05:10] without water he brought them through
[1:05:11] times without food he brought them
[1:05:13] through trials and tribulations to bring
[1:05:14] them to a place where they could trust
[1:05:16] god and then so sometimes we need to
[1:05:18] have an experience so that we will trust
[1:05:20] so that we can say that we have faith so
[1:05:22] we can say we know that god is a god of
[1:05:24] provision but he's got to have something
[1:05:26] taken away before he can be a god of
[1:05:27] provision sometimes and sometimes what
[1:05:29] he's just trying to do is show you the
[1:05:30] magnificence of god to show you that
[1:05:32] there is no problem too big for him
[1:05:34] there's no situation he can't resolve
[1:05:36] there's nothing that he can't do to meet
[1:05:38] your need and sometimes the problem is
[1:05:40] he's just got to give you a need before
[1:05:41] he can meet it
[1:05:42] sometimes we've got to realize the need
[1:05:43] before he can meet it right
[1:05:46] so the man's role here that moses is
[1:05:48] pointing them to the man's role is to
[1:05:50] keep the family in a position to be
[1:05:53] blessed by god
[1:05:54] by resting and staying with the word of
[1:05:56] god
[1:05:57] the man's role as the provider the
[1:06:00] provider role comes by sticking with the
[1:06:02] word of god first and foremost it is not
[1:06:04] in working your tail off it is not as
[1:06:05] wearing your fingers to the bone it is
[1:06:07] not in coming home tired every day it is
[1:06:09] in keeping the family under the headship
[1:06:11] of the word so that god can bless and
[1:06:13] provide for the family amen that is the
[1:06:15] jehovah jireh attribute in a man is to
[1:06:17] give it to jehovah jireh himself and
[1:06:19] keep himself in subjection and under
[1:06:21] that authority amen
[1:06:23] so when god delegated authority to adam
[1:06:25] he put him in the role of working
[1:06:26] outside the home i don't think that's
[1:06:28] debatable at this point amen that he
[1:06:30] said the ground is what you're going to
[1:06:31] work he didn't tell a woman she was
[1:06:32] going to work the ground doesn't mean
[1:06:34] she can't or she won't but he told the
[1:06:35] man this is your main role this is your
[1:06:37] primary role is to get out there and
[1:06:39] work and sweat and toil amen
[1:06:42] and then as a you know
[1:06:44] we take that because
[1:06:46] god we said before wasn't just looking
[1:06:48] to have people he was looking to have a
[1:06:50] family right and so he's putting the man
[1:06:52] in the role that he was and so now we
[1:06:54] see that there's a drop down again of
[1:06:56] the woman into the role of the bride to
[1:06:58] do something with what he gives her
[1:07:00] right she magnifies what is brought to
[1:07:02] her she glorifies what is brought to her
[1:07:04] and she makes it better than what was
[1:07:05] brought in and then my wife and i were
[1:07:07] talking about this and she said somebody
[1:07:09] said i bring in the pig and she turns it
[1:07:10] into bacon and eggs right that's way
[1:07:12] better than the pig that you brought in
[1:07:14] wasn't it right she takes in she she
[1:07:16] magnifies it you look at proverbs 31 she
[1:07:18] brings in something and she turns it
[1:07:20] into something more valuable she takes
[1:07:22] in the work that he's brought and she
[1:07:23] turns into something that was better
[1:07:24] than what he gave her that she she
[1:07:26] blends it together and makes it into
[1:07:27] something amen and then he's bringing
[1:07:29] the food and she's bringing forth life
[1:07:31] that's what we see in the woman is the
[1:07:33] man's bringing forth a provision and
[1:07:34] she's bringing forth life and that's a
[1:07:36] that's an amazing thing to be able to
[1:07:38] say
[1:07:39] amen
[1:07:40] now much of what we're about to say is
[1:07:41] geared toward married couples
[1:07:44] okay
[1:07:45] so just because you're not married
[1:07:46] though doesn't mean you don't need to
[1:07:47] listen because you may be married
[1:07:48] someday amen as a young man you may be a
[1:07:51] husband and as a wife as a young young
[1:07:53] girl you may be a wife and mother so you
[1:07:55] can look ahead and say this may apply to
[1:07:57] me someday so listen up and then we've
[1:07:59] got of course lots of married couples in
[1:08:00] here young and old and so we want to
[1:08:02] just listen to this a little bit and see
[1:08:03] what god has to say about this
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:06] i'm going to take us to a scriptural
[1:08:08] frame of reference for this because we
[1:08:10] we see where god told adam that he was
[1:08:12] the one that was going to work and sweat
[1:08:13] and these different things but i want to
[1:08:14] take it beyond adam and i want to take
[1:08:16] it back to christ because if that is the
[1:08:18] perfect example and what we're what
[1:08:20] we're setting a a setting for here today
[1:08:22] is the perfect example and i'll say this
[1:08:25] and that's that we aren't a perfect
[1:08:27] example our relationships our marriages
[1:08:29] aren't perfect we're living in an
[1:08:30] imperfect world with imperfect spouses
[1:08:32] at least a couple of us have imperfect
[1:08:34] spouses right and so we know that things
[1:08:37] can there it's not that there are
[1:08:39] exceptions it's that we're living in the
[1:08:40] real world and sometimes things have to
[1:08:42] be done that aren't according to the
[1:08:43] perfect example but i want to show us
[1:08:45] the perfect example because that's what
[1:08:46] we strive for amen we want to be as
[1:08:48] christ is we want to do as christ does
[1:08:51] as much as we possibly can in this world
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:55] and if we can take it back to the
[1:08:56] scriptures then it's not my opinion
[1:08:58] amen
[1:08:59] it's not even god's opinion god doesn't
[1:09:01] have an opinion did you know that god
[1:09:02] doesn't have an opinion god has truth
[1:09:04] and that's all it is and if it's not
[1:09:06] what he says then it's wrong and then so
[1:09:08] if god says it then we stick with that
[1:09:10] and we say it's truth it's not an
[1:09:11] opinion okay so i'm going to take it
[1:09:13] back to the scriptures here and this is
[1:09:14] a bit different approach perhaps but
[1:09:16] stay with me if you would
[1:09:18] isaiah 9 6 we're talking about christ
[1:09:20] now for unto us a child is born unto us
[1:09:23] a son is given and the government shall
[1:09:25] be upon his shoulder and his name shall
[1:09:28] be called wonderful counselor the mighty
[1:09:30] god the everlasting father the prince of
[1:09:33] peace isaiah 22 22 says and the key of
[1:09:37] the house of david shall i lay upon his
[1:09:39] shoulder so he shall open and none shall
[1:09:42] shut and he shall shut and none shall
[1:09:44] open amen take it all the way to
[1:09:46] revelation 3 verse 7 and to the angel of
[1:09:48] the church in philadelphia write these
[1:09:51] things saith he that is holy he that is
[1:09:53] true he that had the key of david that
[1:09:56] he openeth and no man shutteth and
[1:09:58] shutteth and no man openeth now we're
[1:10:01] talking about man being the in the role
[1:10:03] of the primary provider the primary
[1:10:04] worker for the home this doesn't look
[1:10:06] like those type of scriptures does it
[1:10:08] but let us take it back and i'm going to
[1:10:09] read a quote here i could explain it
[1:10:11] myself but i figure if i say it the way
[1:10:12] brother branham said it then we're on a
[1:10:14] very sure foundation as he explains
[1:10:16] these scriptures amen and this is in the
[1:10:18] church age book he says he that had the
[1:10:20] key of david he's referring to
[1:10:21] revelation 3 7. he says this beautiful
[1:10:24] phrase follows and comes out of the
[1:10:25] preceding phrase he that is true
[1:10:28] remember we said god doesn't have
[1:10:29] opinions he is truth
[1:10:31] christ the perfect realization
[1:10:34] contrasted with partial realization
[1:10:36] we're painting a perfect picture here
[1:10:38] now
[1:10:39] here it is moses was a prophet of god
[1:10:42] but jesus like unto moses was the
[1:10:45] prophet of god
[1:10:46] david a man after god's own heart was
[1:10:48] king of israel but jesus is the greater
[1:10:51] david king of kings and lord of lords
[1:10:54] god very god amen now david was born of
[1:10:57] the tribe of judah out of whom no priest
[1:11:00] came yet he ate of the show bred
[1:11:02] reserved for priests he was the great
[1:11:04] warrior overcoming the enemy
[1:11:06] establishing the people as king he said
[1:11:08] on the throne he was a prophet he was a
[1:11:11] wonderful type of christ
[1:11:14] now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key
[1:11:17] of the house of david shall i lay upon
[1:11:19] his shoulder so he shall open and none
[1:11:21] shall shut and he shall shut and none
[1:11:23] shall open
[1:11:24] the spirit uses this old testament
[1:11:27] reference concerning the lord jesus
[1:11:29] christ and his ministry in the church
[1:11:32] what the key of david signified at this
[1:11:34] time is mere shadow which is now
[1:11:36] fulfilled in jesus standing in the midst
[1:11:38] of the land lampstands what's that in
[1:11:40] the midst of the gentile church amen it
[1:11:43] has to do with our lord after his
[1:11:46] resurrection and not his earthly
[1:11:47] pilgrimage but what does this key
[1:11:49] signify the answer lies in the position
[1:11:52] of the key
[1:11:54] it is not in his hand it is not worn
[1:11:57] around his neck it is not placed in the
[1:11:59] hands of other men or the verse could
[1:12:01] not be saying that he alone has the use
[1:12:03] of that key for he alone opens and shuts
[1:12:06] and no man has that right but jesus
[1:12:08] himself he says isn't that right
[1:12:10] but where is the key it is on his
[1:12:13] shoulder but what does the shoulder have
[1:12:15] to do with it read isaiah 9 6 the
[1:12:18] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:12:20] but what does this mean
[1:12:22] he says the answer is this the phrase
[1:12:25] the government upon his shoulder comes
[1:12:27] from the wedding ceremony of the east
[1:12:29] when the bride has been committed to the
[1:12:31] groom she takes off her veil and places
[1:12:34] it over the groom's shoulders signifying
[1:12:37] that not only is she under his dominion
[1:12:39] that she has transferred her rights to
[1:12:41] him that he is the head
[1:12:43] right that's great brother jonathan but
[1:12:45] listen to this but also that he
[1:12:48] bears the responsibility and the care
[1:12:51] and that he and he alone
[1:12:54] no one else no other man no other power
[1:12:57] has any right and responsibility to do
[1:13:01] what provide and care for her amen
[1:13:05] and that beloved is the key of david and
[1:13:08] god being sovereign he foreknew by
[1:13:10] divine degree decree exactly who would
[1:13:13] be in his bride he chose her she did not
[1:13:16] choose him he called her she did not
[1:13:18] come on her own he died for her he
[1:13:20] washed her in his own blood
[1:13:22] he paid the price for her she belongs to
[1:13:25] him and him alone she is wholly
[1:13:27] committed to him and he accepts the
[1:13:30] obligation he is her head for christ is
[1:13:34] the head of his church as sarah called
[1:13:36] abraham lord even so the bride is happy
[1:13:39] that he is her lord he speaks and she
[1:13:41] obeys for that is her delight
[1:13:45] so what is it the responsibility of the
[1:13:47] bride is on the shoulder of the
[1:13:49] bridegroom she takes her veil she
[1:13:51] unveils herself before him and passes it
[1:13:54] over to him and says now it is your care
[1:13:57] to provide for me it is your
[1:13:59] responsibility alone she doesn't put
[1:14:00] that veil on anyone's shoulders and she
[1:14:02] doesn't leave the veil on her own
[1:14:03] shoulder she takes her responsibility
[1:14:05] off of herself and gives it to that man
[1:14:07] and says now it's your responsibility
[1:14:09] and it says what that he accepts it he
[1:14:12] accepts the obligation amen this is the
[1:14:15] perfect picture of christ and the bride
[1:14:18] this is the perfect example for a
[1:14:19] marriage this is perfect example of the
[1:14:21] union of a man and a woman and as men as
[1:14:24] paul tells us we are supposed to love
[1:14:26] our wives as christ did
[1:14:28] so we are supposed to accept the
[1:14:30] obligation for the care and
[1:14:31] responsibility of our family of our
[1:14:34] wives amen
[1:14:35] but that's the perfect example
[1:14:37] is anybody here perfect
[1:14:41] we're not in our flesh if you didn't
[1:14:43] know we're not we're not in our flesh
[1:14:45] we're not perfect and then so we've got
[1:14:47] to be able to do what
[1:14:49] be able to reconcile this with the fact
[1:14:51] that we are imperfect amen that we can't
[1:14:53] always do what we need to do that we're
[1:14:55] living in sinful bodies that we're
[1:14:56] living in a sinful earth and so there
[1:14:58] are things that can change what this
[1:14:59] looks like in our lives amen
[1:15:01] amen but let's see what paul says to our
[1:15:04] friend timothy again
[1:15:05] about what this means for the man today
[1:15:08] he says but if any provide not for his
[1:15:11] own and especially for those of his own
[1:15:14] house he had denied the faith and is
[1:15:17] worse than an infidel
[1:15:19] the amplified says if anyone fails to
[1:15:21] provide for his relatives and especially
[1:15:23] for those of his own family he has
[1:15:25] disowned the faith now catch this by
[1:15:28] accompanying his faith with fruits
[1:15:32] and is worse than an unbeliever who
[1:15:34] performs his obligation in these matters
[1:15:37] and then so paul takes a man's
[1:15:38] responsibility and his ability to
[1:15:40] provide for his household and it's not
[1:15:42] just for his household and his immediate
[1:15:45] family but it is for his relations and
[1:15:47] for the household of faith as we'll see
[1:15:48] later it said he he ties that into the
[1:15:50] man's spiritual walk
[1:15:52] he says this is a reflection of a man's
[1:15:54] faith is how well he provides for his
[1:15:57] family he says what the in the amplified
[1:15:59] there it says by what his faith isn't
[1:16:02] accompanied with fruits if he's not if
[1:16:03] he's not providing for his family he
[1:16:05] ties that into what the fruits of the
[1:16:07] holy spirit in a man's life is his
[1:16:09] provision for his family
[1:16:11] now that's a pretty serious thing isn't
[1:16:13] it that's a pretty serious thing to say
[1:16:15] well i know all the revelation
[1:16:17] in the word i can i can get up i can
[1:16:18] preach i can talk i can exhort i can
[1:16:21] testify but paul says but can you take
[1:16:23] care of your own family
[1:16:24] right
[1:16:26] why because you're in that role that was
[1:16:27] your that was your god-given role was to
[1:16:29] provide for your family so if you're
[1:16:31] doing everything else but you're not
[1:16:32] doing what god placed you on earth to do
[1:16:33] then there's a problem and then you've
[1:16:35] got a lot of head knowledge you've got a
[1:16:36] lot of understanding but the application
[1:16:38] is lacking in your life so the provision
[1:16:41] of a man for his family is a fruit of
[1:16:42] his faith and and paul ties us directly
[1:16:44] to a spiritual walk amen but catch now
[1:16:48] that this is a refusal of the man
[1:16:50] it's a refusal of a man to do it it's
[1:16:53] not if a man literally can't do it hey
[1:16:55] man if you got both your legs lopped off
[1:16:57] in the war then you're going to struggle
[1:16:58] to sew and and toil in the fields aren't
[1:17:00] you if you've got a physical disability
[1:17:02] you're there's going to be a real
[1:17:03] struggle there and you may not be able
[1:17:05] to make ends meet that's why i say
[1:17:06] there's grace for us because we're in an
[1:17:08] imperfect world with imperfect bodies in
[1:17:10] a sinful fallen condition amen but what
[1:17:13] it's speaking of a man that is fully
[1:17:15] capable of doing it that refuses to do
[1:17:17] it
[1:17:18] amen that refuses to sweat and toil to
[1:17:21] the point that he provides for his
[1:17:22] family but instead backs away
[1:17:25] and either doesn't provide for them or
[1:17:27] lets it fall on somebody's else's
[1:17:28] shoulders to provide for his family amen
[1:17:31] so when we look at this scripture where
[1:17:32] do we see the woman
[1:17:35] we don't see her sitting there providing
[1:17:38] for her house there's no he there's no
[1:17:40] she there's no her here it is all he his
[1:17:43] all he and his right because why the
[1:17:46] primary role of the man is to be the
[1:17:47] provider
[1:17:48] right not that the woman doesn't work
[1:17:50] heaven knows the women work
[1:17:52] amen but the primary role the primary
[1:17:54] provider in the family is to be the man
[1:17:55] and that's why paul addresses the men
[1:17:57] specifically amen
[1:17:59] why the woman is not responsible to
[1:18:01] provide for herself
[1:18:03] are we responsible to provide for
[1:18:04] ourselves in relation to christ no he is
[1:18:07] a great provider for us so imperfect
[1:18:09] type the woman is not to provide for
[1:18:11] herself the husband is to provide for
[1:18:12] her amen
[1:18:15] her veil is on the husband's shoulder
[1:18:16] and he accepts that
[1:18:18] now again bear with me
[1:18:19] don't get tight
[1:18:21] i'm not saying that women can't work
[1:18:23] and i won't be saying that and i won't
[1:18:24] be preaching that so don't get all up in
[1:18:26] arms with me okay i'm not saying women
[1:18:28] can't work but i'm showing us the the
[1:18:30] perfect image
[1:18:32] so that we can strive for the perfect
[1:18:33] image amen and then we can have grace
[1:18:35] where we fail amen grace for each other
[1:18:37] grace for ourselves and those sorts of
[1:18:39] things amen i'm showing you god's
[1:18:41] provided now pride provided way and
[1:18:43] that's where i would prefer to rest amen
[1:18:45] is god's provided way but we still want
[1:18:47] to have grace we still want to have
[1:18:49] mercy for where things change in
[1:18:50] situations change in these different
[1:18:52] things
[1:18:53] but i want to look into this scripture a
[1:18:55] little deeper because it says if any
[1:18:56] provide not for his own that word
[1:18:58] provide means to perceive
[1:19:01] before
[1:19:02] to foresee to think of beforehand
[1:19:05] now where did we just read about that
[1:19:07] jehovah jireh the lord who sees and the
[1:19:10] lord who sees to it this is the jehovah
[1:19:12] jireh attribute in a man being applied
[1:19:14] to the provision of his family amen
[1:19:17] so what is it a man is supposed to be
[1:19:19] forward looking
[1:19:20] not just saying what is the need for
[1:19:21] today but what do i see coming down the
[1:19:23] road where there's going to be a need
[1:19:25] that i have to provide for and then when
[1:19:27] you have a wife when you have kids then
[1:19:28] guess what you know if you have a wife
[1:19:30] chances are there's going to be children
[1:19:31] coming someday so you have to be
[1:19:33] planning how am i going to add kids to
[1:19:34] this family is the home that i rent is
[1:19:36] the home that i own going to support
[1:19:38] that family what kind of vehicle do i
[1:19:40] have how many kids can i fit into it
[1:19:42] what kind of budget do i need for my
[1:19:43] kids they need eyeglasses they need
[1:19:45] braces they need chiropractic
[1:19:47] appointments they have sports that they
[1:19:48] want to play they have school they have
[1:19:50] to attend all these different things a
[1:19:51] man's got to be looking forward to see
[1:19:53] what's coming down the road so he can
[1:19:54] make
[1:19:55] provision and planning now so that when
[1:19:57] the need arises he said i've got this
[1:20:00] amen that's the jehovah jireh attribute
[1:20:02] is looking ahead and saying this is
[1:20:04] what's coming down the road now we don't
[1:20:06] do this just by planning
[1:20:08] let me say that remember paul paul
[1:20:09] admonishes us he says he says we don't
[1:20:11] say we're going to go to this city and
[1:20:12] we're going to do this and buy this and
[1:20:14] sell this and go here and go there he
[1:20:15] says we say what if the lord willing
[1:20:18] amen that is remember he's taking it
[1:20:20] back and saying we've got to check up
[1:20:21] with god on these things but how many
[1:20:23] times can i say that we've gone in
[1:20:24] prayer and we say lord what do we need
[1:20:27] to do is there something coming is there
[1:20:29] a change coming in am i going to have to
[1:20:30] turn a corner am i going to have a need
[1:20:33] here and do i need to make provision for
[1:20:34] it and guess what god will put an action
[1:20:36] on you to save got to put an unction for
[1:20:38] you to start looking for new work god
[1:20:40] will put an action on you to maybe
[1:20:41] upgrade your education upgrade your
[1:20:43] training whatever it might be because
[1:20:45] what's he doing he's preparing you for
[1:20:46] what's coming down the road now you
[1:20:48] can't see all these things
[1:20:50] there are things we can see like i said
[1:20:52] if you're married and you have a wife
[1:20:53] chances are a kid is going to come at
[1:20:54] some point right that's just a we ought
[1:20:56] to be able to see those things if we
[1:20:58] have kids we know they're going to have
[1:20:59] needs they're going to need clothes
[1:21:00] we're going to need a vehicle we're
[1:21:01] going to need new winter tires we're
[1:21:02] going to have to maintain the home
[1:21:04] something's going to break those are all
[1:21:05] things that we ought to be able to do
[1:21:06] we're going to have to retire someday
[1:21:08] right that's all things that we can see
[1:21:10] but there are things that are coming
[1:21:11] down the road that we can't know but yet
[1:21:13] if we are tied to god then he can
[1:21:15] prepare us for
[1:21:16] why through prayer through dwelling on
[1:21:19] it through meditating on it and saying
[1:21:20] lord what would you have me to do
[1:21:23] right we can see there's something
[1:21:24] potentially coming so we say lord what
[1:21:26] is it and how would you have me prepare
[1:21:28] and all of a sudden you come to that
[1:21:29] point and you say wow he really did know
[1:21:31] what was coming and he really did
[1:21:32] prepare me
[1:21:33] but we've got to take that time to say
[1:21:35] lord will you open my eyes to what i
[1:21:37] need to do now to prepare for the need
[1:21:39] that's coming down the road because he's
[1:21:40] the one that sees it before we ever will
[1:21:42] and he's the one that can show us how to
[1:21:43] provide for it amen
[1:21:45] so this planning does not start when we
[1:21:47] become
[1:21:48] a married man when does it start it
[1:21:50] starts when we're young and single
[1:21:52] because we've got to start planning then
[1:21:54] for what's coming down the road if we're
[1:21:55] going to get married our young men have
[1:21:57] to prepare to be married don't they they
[1:21:59] need to have a stable career they need
[1:22:00] to have a stable job they need to have
[1:22:02] savings they need to have a vehicle they
[1:22:03] need to have an income that can support
[1:22:05] a home they need to have an income that
[1:22:06] can furnish a home they need to have an
[1:22:08] income that can send their wife home
[1:22:10] because everybody here we know we're
[1:22:11] gonna have to bring in wives right
[1:22:14] that's the pattern that's the pattern
[1:22:16] right we gotta import newfoundland is
[1:22:18] short on on messaged women
[1:22:21] of the same age
[1:22:23] of the same age right so what we've got
[1:22:26] to be looking at that and as young men
[1:22:27] we have to look and say what is going to
[1:22:29] be the requirement for me as i step into
[1:22:31] this role and if i'm not ready for it
[1:22:34] then i shouldn't be stepping into it
[1:22:35] either amen i remember when i got
[1:22:37] married i had ten thousand dollars in
[1:22:39] the bank
[1:22:40] by the time we finished doing everything
[1:22:42] for the wedding and furnishing the house
[1:22:44] i had less than a hundred dollars left
[1:22:46] that's how tight it was
[1:22:48] but i had it
[1:22:49] i had it and that was the plan i had it
[1:22:51] i had what we needed to get going but
[1:22:52] then after that you're really you're
[1:22:54] really working to build that thing back
[1:22:55] up again aren't you why you have to look
[1:22:57] and see what's going to be coming and
[1:23:00] how can i take care of it amen
[1:23:02] so so often the problem is not whether
[1:23:04] women should work for not it's whether
[1:23:05] men are planning or not
[1:23:07] that's direct but it's true is is the
[1:23:09] man planning and providing or is he not
[1:23:12] doing that and so he's caught by
[1:23:13] surprise and now he's saying to his wife
[1:23:15] can you please work to make up the the
[1:23:16] difference here right
[1:23:18] why because he hasn't done the jehovah
[1:23:20] jireh part that god's asked of him and
[1:23:21] that's to be forward-looking to provide
[1:23:23] by looking ahead
[1:23:25] and meeting the needs himself amen
[1:23:28] the needs exceed the income all of a
[1:23:30] sudden and he says well what can i do
[1:23:32] this is my job this is what i make i
[1:23:34] don't expect to you know anything more
[1:23:35] than this amount of a raise and all of a
[1:23:36] sudden our lifestyle is expended ten
[1:23:38] thousand dollars when i say lifestyle i
[1:23:40] just mean whatever's happened sometimes
[1:23:42] it is lifestyle but sometimes it's a
[1:23:43] baby comes along sometimes we have
[1:23:45] triplets right that's a big hit isn't it
[1:23:47] you know these different things we have
[1:23:48] things happen in life and all of a
[1:23:49] sudden he's saying holy cow how am i
[1:23:51] going to deal with this
[1:23:52] well the thing is we got to be forward
[1:23:54] looking we got to be planning for this
[1:23:56] and here's the thing is satan is
[1:23:57] attacking every day the ability of the
[1:23:59] man to be the primary breadwinner in the
[1:24:01] family every day i lived in vancouver
[1:24:04] where the the the average house was over
[1:24:06] 1.1 million dollars who's got that kind
[1:24:09] of money
[1:24:10] right to make that to make that house
[1:24:12] payment comfortably you'd have to make
[1:24:14] almost 300
[1:24:15] dollars a year anybody here making three
[1:24:17] hundred grand
[1:24:19] never will
[1:24:20] you never will for most of us
[1:24:22] three hundred thousand dollars and yet
[1:24:24] here's the thing i know young men that
[1:24:27] are there that have good stable jobs and
[1:24:29] that have found a way to make a living
[1:24:31] provide for their family still be a
[1:24:33] church amen still be at the household of
[1:24:36] faith still supporting the local body
[1:24:38] and make a living and do that but they
[1:24:40] work their tails off amen they're
[1:24:42] sweating and they're toiling and they're
[1:24:44] doing what it takes to get the job done
[1:24:46] why they're planning and they're looking
[1:24:48] and they're trusting god to provide what
[1:24:49] they need and they're just letting god
[1:24:51] do it remember they got to work they're
[1:24:54] still pushing they're always looking for
[1:24:55] something amen the other thing is that
[1:24:57] satan is working to do what turn our
[1:24:59] wants into needs
[1:25:00] isn't it because we look around and we
[1:25:03] see what everybody else has and we say
[1:25:04] well that's the standard but that's not
[1:25:06] the standard when i got married i had a
[1:25:09] 1994 volkswagen golf that kept rusting
[1:25:12] out the uh the flex joint in the exhaust
[1:25:14] so that it sounded like it had a hole in
[1:25:16] the muffler all the time okay
[1:25:19] blocker hated driving it because reverse
[1:25:20] was right next to first gear and you
[1:25:22] beat a stop light and you go to put it
[1:25:24] in the first and you go backwards if you
[1:25:25] weren't careful so we learned to just
[1:25:27] touch the release the clutch a bit and
[1:25:28] make sure it was going forward before we
[1:25:30] pushed ahead
[1:25:31] right
[1:25:32] it's not all fun and games right we
[1:25:34] don't start at the top we start at the
[1:25:36] bottom and we work our way up but what
[1:25:38] is happening is satan is saying no
[1:25:40] you've got to have a vacation or two
[1:25:41] every year you got to have a new car you
[1:25:43] got to have a nice home it's got to be
[1:25:44] beautifully furnished you have to have
[1:25:46] the latest and greatest clothes you got
[1:25:48] to do this you got to do that you got to
[1:25:49] drive this you got to be here you got to
[1:25:50] do that that's not a need that's a want
[1:25:53] in most cases right
[1:25:55] yeah my vehicles are eight and nine
[1:25:57] years old right now
[1:25:58] right we don't need the latest and
[1:25:59] greatest
[1:26:00] right what we need is something reliable
[1:26:02] that will do the job right we don't need
[1:26:04] the biggest house
[1:26:05] now you may need a big house
[1:26:07] if you're going to be hosting a lot if
[1:26:08] you're doing these different things but
[1:26:10] we don't need it it's a nice to have
[1:26:12] amen and when i look at what i started
[1:26:14] out in blanc and i have lived in a place
[1:26:15] that wasn't even a one bedroom it was an
[1:26:17] all room it was one big room and that's
[1:26:19] what we lived in
[1:26:20] right why that's what we could afford
[1:26:24] it's the way it is and then you work
[1:26:25] your way up and you get to this and that
[1:26:26] we can't be looking ahead to what
[1:26:28] everybody else has because if you look
[1:26:30] at what it took to get there you got to
[1:26:32] go through the same thing amen
[1:26:34] it'll develop your character as you go i
[1:26:35] can definitely say that i remember
[1:26:37] living in bc and we rented a townhouse
[1:26:39] for almost two thousand dollars a month
[1:26:40] and that was a good deal
[1:26:42] and blanc and i we used to go for a walk
[1:26:43] pretty much every day and i walk around
[1:26:45] and as we walk by the driveways i'd list
[1:26:47] out how much was how much car payment
[1:26:50] was sitting in that driveway and i can't
[1:26:52] tell you how many driveways had more
[1:26:53] fifteen hundred dollars or more in
[1:26:54] vehicles sitting in their driveway
[1:26:57] how do you afford a fifteen hundred
[1:26:59] dollar car payment every month right you
[1:27:01] know how you do it dual income and
[1:27:04] usually no kids
[1:27:06] that's how you do it and what you do is
[1:27:08] you get both of them in there to support
[1:27:09] a lifestyle rather than to support a
[1:27:11] need and those kids that they might have
[1:27:13] are going to a daycare center every day
[1:27:15] and they're not being raised by their
[1:27:16] mother they're they'd obviously be
[1:27:17] raised by their father and instead
[1:27:19] they're living a great lifestyle to what
[1:27:21] make the payments on every all the stuff
[1:27:23] that they have amen the latest phone the
[1:27:25] latest gadget the latest this the latest
[1:27:27] that and all of a sudden they've got to
[1:27:28] make so much money to live a lifestyle
[1:27:30] rather than living it the way god has
[1:27:32] intended us and what happens something's
[1:27:34] got to give
[1:27:35] right you can't step out of the you
[1:27:37] can't step out of the perfect image of
[1:27:38] god and expect to grow
[1:27:40] right something's got to give right if a
[1:27:43] man is always working then it's going to
[1:27:45] have an impact if a man is never working
[1:27:47] it's going to have an impact right if a
[1:27:49] wife is being pulled out of the home
[1:27:51] it's going to have an impact isn't it
[1:27:52] the meals are going to suffer the kids
[1:27:54] are going to suffer the wash is going to
[1:27:55] suffer and usually what happens is what
[1:27:58] the woman's pulled in to do more and the
[1:28:00] man doesn't step up and do more himself
[1:28:02] right there's no there's rarely an
[1:28:04] offsetting of duties is there if he
[1:28:06] wants her to step in then all of a
[1:28:07] sudden she's doing everything a wife is
[1:28:08] supposed to do everything a mother's
[1:28:09] supposed to do and she's working
[1:28:11] and he's just working
[1:28:13] right it's not right it shouldn't be
[1:28:15] amen we ought to have a balance in these
[1:28:17] things amen the thing is something's got
[1:28:19] to give and the question is this will it
[1:28:21] be the thing of god that gives right
[1:28:23] will it be the word of god that gives or
[1:28:24] will it be something else is the big
[1:28:26] question we have to ask so watch who the
[1:28:28] man is responsible it says if he provide
[1:28:30] not for his own
[1:28:32] and then especially for those of his own
[1:28:34] house now that house means household
[1:28:37] and the greek says it is belonging to a
[1:28:39] house or family domestic and intimate so
[1:28:42] that's our family
[1:28:43] but it also says belonging to one's
[1:28:45] household related by blood
[1:28:48] kindred or belonging to the household of
[1:28:52] god
[1:28:53] right this is not just an obligation now
[1:28:55] to your blood relations to your wife to
[1:28:57] your children to your mom your dad your
[1:28:59] brothers or sisters or those different
[1:29:00] things but this is to the household of
[1:29:02] faith that we are also responsible for
[1:29:05] now you say how do we do that
[1:29:07] look in the book of acts chapter 4 and
[1:29:09] we see the provision that's there it
[1:29:11] says and when they had prayed the place
[1:29:13] was shaken where they were assembled
[1:29:14] together and they were all filled with
[1:29:16] the holy ghost and they spake the word
[1:29:18] of god with boldness and the multitude
[1:29:20] of them that believed were of one heart
[1:29:22] and one soul neither said any of them
[1:29:24] that ought of the things which he
[1:29:26] possessed was his own but they had all
[1:29:28] things common
[1:29:29] now here they held all things in common
[1:29:32] that means that everyone took their
[1:29:33] money put it into a central pot and it
[1:29:35] was divided by the by the deacons and
[1:29:37] whatnot to meet the needs of the local
[1:29:39] body
[1:29:40] now this is not a scriptural command
[1:29:42] we're not commanded to hold all things
[1:29:44] in common but what we are commanded men
[1:29:46] is we are commanded to provide for the
[1:29:48] needs of the household of faith as well
[1:29:50] so the bible doesn't say we have to do
[1:29:52] this and that's why we don't do it
[1:29:53] right that's why we don't do it but it
[1:29:56] does say you need to be looking out for
[1:29:57] your brothers and sisters as well
[1:29:59] and then we need to be helping where we
[1:30:00] can help and it's not always financial
[1:30:02] amen i loved it i so appreciated it when
[1:30:04] i moved here and i asked people to come
[1:30:06] help guess what all the brothers showed
[1:30:07] up
[1:30:08] and it took us what 20 minutes or
[1:30:10] something like that because all the
[1:30:11] brothers showed up also because we
[1:30:12] didn't bring much but it was great
[1:30:13] because it was just quick in and out in
[1:30:15] and out in and out and everything was
[1:30:16] done and then when we go and we go to
[1:30:18] the church and we clean up what is it
[1:30:20] the brothers and the kids come and they
[1:30:21] do it if somebody has a need over at the
[1:30:23] house what happens the brothers will go
[1:30:24] and do it and then they're providing for
[1:30:26] the household of faith not just for
[1:30:28] their own family now your first
[1:30:30] responsibility is to your own family and
[1:30:32] man we can't be doing more for everyone
[1:30:33] else and leaving our family destitute in
[1:30:35] any way but if you've got time and money
[1:30:37] or effort and strength after that then
[1:30:38] it's to be put into the household of
[1:30:40] faith first and then those that are
[1:30:41] without after that amen we're to be
[1:30:43] providers throughout the entire
[1:30:44] community if we look at the scripture
[1:30:46] fully
[1:30:48] listen to this galatians 6
[1:30:50] says and let us not be weary in
[1:30:52] well-doing for in due season we shall
[1:30:55] reap if we faint not
[1:30:57] as we have therefore opportunity
[1:31:00] let us do good unto all men
[1:31:03] now this is not just to the men but
[1:31:04] we're talking to the men today
[1:31:06] especially unto them who are of the
[1:31:09] household of faith
[1:31:10] amen so even if you don't have a family
[1:31:13] as in you're not a married man at this
[1:31:15] point you still have a family you have
[1:31:16] your local family you have your your
[1:31:19] your your uh your you know your your mom
[1:31:21] your dad your sisters and and brothers
[1:31:23] and these different things but you also
[1:31:24] have the household of faith so the young
[1:31:26] men have an obligation to support what
[1:31:28] the local household of faith and how do
[1:31:30] we do that
[1:31:30] ties and offerings right how is it that
[1:31:33] we pay to bring people in
[1:31:35] by ties and offerings right so the more
[1:31:38] we bring in the more we can give right
[1:31:40] and so when we do that by working when
[1:31:42] we do that by bringing in income and
[1:31:43] then we tithe and do our offering on it
[1:31:45] then it helps the household of faith
[1:31:47] when there's a need in the body how do
[1:31:49] the deacons pay for it
[1:31:51] they don't pull it out of their pocket
[1:31:52] typically what do they do they go into
[1:31:54] the church offering fund and they say
[1:31:56] there's a need hey there's money praise
[1:31:58] the lord let's meet the local need with
[1:32:00] what we have to do we see that with our
[1:32:01] tuition reimbursement program we see
[1:32:03] that when we have needs people that have
[1:32:05] lost their jobs are facing difficult
[1:32:06] situations and whatnot is what we're
[1:32:08] supporting the household of faith with
[1:32:10] what we give in tithes and offerings as
[1:32:11] well so god has a whole way provided to
[1:32:14] to support and provide for the needs of
[1:32:15] the local body right and it's not just
[1:32:17] when we get married that we start doing
[1:32:19] it we do it as soon as we're of a
[1:32:20] workable age and we can bring in income
[1:32:23] it has an effect on the whole local body
[1:32:24] amen
[1:32:27] now there's plenty of examples of women
[1:32:29] helping out and we're going to get into
[1:32:30] that when we start talking about the
[1:32:31] sisters lord willing but the primary
[1:32:34] role is for the man to do it and paul
[1:32:35] ties it directly to your spiritual walk
[1:32:37] and that's that if you refuse to do it
[1:32:39] or you refuse to do it to your full
[1:32:41] strength then you're worse than an
[1:32:42] infidel because you're not bringing
[1:32:43] forth the full fruit of the holy spirit
[1:32:45] as being the provider for your family
[1:32:47] amen it's part of a christ-like
[1:32:48] masculine nature and it's not just a
[1:32:50] suggestion it's a command to the men
[1:32:52] it's a command to the men it's not a
[1:32:54] command to the women doesn't mean that
[1:32:56] women can't help but it's a command to
[1:32:57] the men and the men alone amen it's
[1:33:00] optional for the sisters if i could put
[1:33:01] it that way
[1:33:02] and then like i said before this is a
[1:33:04] type of christ in the bride and does the
[1:33:05] bride provide for herself
[1:33:08] she doesn't we read it i'll read it
[1:33:09] again but my god shall supply all your
[1:33:12] need according to his riches and glory
[1:33:14] by christ jesus
[1:33:15] and that's where we stand as we look to
[1:33:18] the we look to the main provider we
[1:33:20] trust in the main provider and then in
[1:33:22] the in this world
[1:33:24] if we have to put in a helping hand
[1:33:25] we'll see that amen
[1:33:27] amen amen
[1:33:29] almost done
[1:33:31] we see that the bride takes the word and
[1:33:33] she puts it into action
[1:33:34] amen that's what we're looking for is a
[1:33:37] bride that'll take what is brought into
[1:33:38] the house and she'll put it into action
[1:33:40] she'll put it into good action into
[1:33:41] profitable action into fruitful action
[1:33:43] and then we see a shift if i could add
[1:33:45] this
[1:33:46] we see a shift because prior to calvary
[1:33:48] we have this this word that says be
[1:33:50] fruitful and multiply and he never backs
[1:33:52] away from it he never backs away from be
[1:33:54] fruitful and multiply all the way
[1:33:55] through to the all the way to revelation
[1:33:57] but what we see is we see be fruitful
[1:33:58] and multiply because you have a worldly
[1:34:01] kingdom coming your way you're having a
[1:34:03] natural land coming your way so you need
[1:34:05] to be fruitful and multiply so that you
[1:34:06] can be in there so that you can be
[1:34:08] blessed in there and so that you can
[1:34:09] hold it amen so you need a people to do
[1:34:11] that you can't walk into the whole land
[1:34:13] of canaan and hold it with with jacob
[1:34:15] and his twelve sons you needed hundreds
[1:34:16] of thousands you needed millions of
[1:34:18] people to go in there and to make it a
[1:34:19] great land right so the fruitful
[1:34:22] multiply was to what bring them into
[1:34:23] their kingdom
[1:34:25] right that was their promise god's
[1:34:27] promise to israel was not future you
[1:34:29] know it wasn't future home like we
[1:34:30] looked a future home it was the land of
[1:34:32] israel that was their promise was it was
[1:34:34] a natural land where they could have
[1:34:35] natural lives where they could have
[1:34:36] natural safety and natural provision and
[1:34:39] it was god that would be doing that for
[1:34:40] them but it was a land that was supposed
[1:34:42] to be theirs forever and ever but but
[1:34:44] then what happens is they reject christ
[1:34:46] and after calvary we don't see him
[1:34:47] saying to the new bride right to the
[1:34:50] real bride he doesn't say be fruitful
[1:34:51] and multiply what does he say go ye into
[1:34:54] all the world
[1:34:55] right it's a different fruitful and
[1:34:56] multiply because what now we're looking
[1:34:58] for spiritual seed we're not looking for
[1:35:00] natural seed so that's why we don't have
[1:35:02] to focus so much on having a ton of
[1:35:04] children we're not looking for natural
[1:35:06] children now our goal is not to bring in
[1:35:07] natural children our goal is to bring in
[1:35:09] spiritual children it's to go out and
[1:35:11] bring in the seed of god that are
[1:35:12] waiting to go into that rapture
[1:35:14] bring them into the bride let them see
[1:35:16] who they are and when that's done then
[1:35:18] we get to go to our kingdom amen that's
[1:35:20] our be fruitful and multiply for the
[1:35:21] gentile now is what go ye into all the
[1:35:23] world and preach the gospel and bring in
[1:35:25] those that are meant to be in this land
[1:35:27] why the kingdom of heaven thy kingdom
[1:35:29] come that's the work that we're doing
[1:35:31] now is the kingdom of heaven not the
[1:35:32] kingdom of this earth all of israel was
[1:35:34] looking for what a kingdom on this earth

[1:50:00] believe what god once said
[1:50:03] amen so let's reach out and touch him
[1:50:06] just before we go today

[1:50:10] in faith
[1:50:12] you know brother branham said that
[1:50:15] when the soldiers
[1:50:17] crucified jesus when they touched his
[1:50:19] garment there was no virtue
[1:50:22] but he said a little poor old woman came
[1:50:25] and touched the hem of his garment and
[1:50:26] she was healed
[1:50:28] and he said he said it's not um
[1:50:31] he said it depends on how you touch him
[1:50:34] right that's really good advice
[1:50:37] but it depends on how you touch jesus
[1:50:39] how we approach him and how we touch him
[1:50:42] he said it's what you believe
[1:50:45] that's what he said
[1:50:47] so let's uh let's just
[1:50:49] remember that it's
[1:50:51] it's a beautiful quote really really
