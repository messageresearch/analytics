[53:18] bless you richly it's good to be back in
[53:19] the house of the Lord again a couple
[53:21] more faces here it's good to have have
[53:23] you here and just trusting that the Lord
[53:26] will speak you know we say be done to me
[53:28] according to that word and his word he
[53:30] said where two or three are gathered in
[53:31] my name amen it's not about this vessel
[53:34] up here it's about us gathering in his
[53:36] name and we trust him to speak came in
[53:37] let's turn in the scriptures if we would
[53:40] to Ephesians 4 where we left off just
[53:42] near the end of service last night
[53:44] Ephesians 4 and verse 10
[53:47] regions 4 verse 10 again staying on the
[53:50] idea of an open show of victory but
[53:52] we'll do a subtitle here just after we
[53:54] we start this here this evening so
[53:56] Ephesians 4 and verse 10 say Amen when
[53:59] you're there
[54:01] amen Ephesians 4 10 and this is where we
[54:04] talked about after Christ led a trail or
[54:08] a train of vanquished foes it says he
[54:10] did this and it says verse 10 he that
[54:12] descended is the same also that ascended
[54:14] up far above all heavens that he might
[54:17] fill all things or that he might fulfill
[54:19] all things and he gave some apostles and
[54:23] some prophets and some evangelists and
[54:25] some pastors and teachers why for the
[54:29] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[54:31] the ministry for the edifying of the
[54:33] body of Christ how long are they to go
[54:37] for it says till we come in the unity of
[54:39] the faith we talked about that last
[54:41] night that's the rapture itself and of
[54:43] the knowledge of the Son of Man of God
[54:46] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[54:49] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[54:51] and what's the effect of this fivefold
[54:53] ministry it says that we henceforth be
[54:55] no more children tossed to and fro and
[54:57] carried about with every wind of
[54:59] doctrine by the sleight of men and
[55:01] cunning craftiness whereby they lie in
[55:03] wait to deceive and what is the end
[55:05] result but speaking the truth in love
[55:07] may grow up into him in all things in
[55:10] all things not in a few things or not in
[55:13] most things but in all things which is
[55:15] the head even Christ they meant is that
[55:17] our goal to grow up into the headship of
[55:19] Christ the perfect body under his
[55:22] purpose Amen let's just close her eyes
[55:24] as we go to the author and prayer
[55:26] Heavenly Father Lord what a wonderful
[55:29] time we have had in your presence
[55:30] already Lord God but Lord this is the
[55:33] main event not because of me bored but
[55:36] because this is where your priority is
[55:38] Lord is in your word because this is you
[55:41] more than we've lifted you up and we've
[55:43] sacrificed but Lord we ask you now to
[55:45] come back and that you would just come
[55:48] down in a special way and open your word
[55:50] to us Heavenly Father well we know
[55:52] there's nothing new Under the Sun I
[55:54] doubt I'm bringing anything that is new
[55:55] to the people Lord but there may be a
[55:57] new angle or there may be a new thought
[55:59] there may be something that would touch
[56:01] them in a way it's never touched them
[56:03] before or maybe there are questions here
[56:05] or maybe are those that are bound here
[56:07] but Lord we pray today that your world
[56:09] would have its full effect on the people
[56:11] within the hearing of this voice Lord
[56:13] God maybe just minister to the hearts of
[56:15] your precious people Lord may you just
[56:17] help prepare your bride a little bit
[56:19] more Lord as we step closer to that
[56:21] rapture we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[56:23] we ask it amen you can have your seats
[56:26] this evening
[56:27] again just to recap slightly we have
[56:29] some that weren't here last night we
[56:31] talked about the the three full purpose
[56:33] of God that brother Branham brought out
[56:34] in that that message Christ is the
[56:36] mystery of God revealed and last night
[56:38] we spoke on the victory through the lamb
[56:40] and how God came and had that perfect
[56:41] preeminence and perfect expression
[56:43] through Christ and then because he
[56:45] identified him as that when he said hear
[56:47] you him he was the perfect sacrifice and
[56:50] when he died God rent the veil from the
[56:51] top to the bottom showing that God had
[56:53] accepted the sacrifice and his presence
[56:55] was no longer in the Holy of Holies but
[56:57] that he was seeking a new place to dwell
[56:59] another place to put his name amen so
[57:01] that was Christ's victory that was his
[57:03] personal victory if you will over Satan
[57:06] was when he took death went down took
[57:08] the keys of hell death in the grave and
[57:09] then rose again that was his victory but
[57:12] now we want to work into that second
[57:14] phase of the plan of redemption and
[57:16] brother Branham said this again he said
[57:18] the second part was what for Christ to
[57:20] have the preeminence 'as in his church
[57:23] which is his body the bride until he
[57:26] could have the preeminence to express
[57:28] himself through them amen so for a
[57:30] subtitle tonight I want to talk on
[57:32] Victor through preeminence but I want to
[57:34] dig into this a little bit because
[57:36] brother branham gives us this beautiful
[57:37] clue as to where we are and in time and
[57:40] where we are in the age is he he speaks
[57:42] there and he starts off when he says
[57:43] have the preeminence 'as in his church
[57:46] preeminence is plural he says have the
[57:49] preeminence is in his church which is
[57:51] his body the bride why because he has to
[57:54] have the preeminence in each one in the
[57:56] body before he has the preeminence in a
[57:58] collective body so the first victory he
[58:00] has to have is over you as an individual
[58:02] he has to have the preeminence in each
[58:04] and every one of your lives and then
[58:06] when he has the preeminence in each and
[58:08] every one of your lives but the RAM says
[58:09] this until he could have the preeminence
[58:12] singular to express himself through them
[58:15] so now he says once he has the
[58:18] preeminence says now he has the
[58:20] preeminence because once he's got you in
[58:22] his fully in his control as an
[58:24] individual what does he do he fits you
[58:25] into this body now and those within the
[58:28] body now act only according to the head
[58:30] and with that it means there's only one
[58:32] preeminence now everybody is working
[58:34] together for one common goal and one one
[58:36] common purpose so preeminence is
[58:38] individually and then he brings you into
[58:40] one big group the body Bride of Christ
[58:42] and has the preeminence within you there
[58:44] it's kind of like a newborn baby right
[58:47] if we could look at it that way you have
[58:49] a newborn baby and it has all of the
[58:50] parts that an adult has but guess what
[58:53] when it's laying there in the bed it's
[58:55] just kind of doing this and twitching
[58:56] that in the legs here in the legs there
[58:57] and there's no coordination is there all
[59:00] the parts are there but that bought that
[59:02] baby's head doesn't have the preeminence
[59:03] over its body yet it hasn't trained
[59:06] itself it hasn't taught itself how to
[59:07] work and so as it gets the individual
[59:09] preeminence in its arm and as its
[59:11] fingers what's the first thing you see
[59:12] with the babies they try and do what
[59:13] they reach out to grab something right
[59:15] and the fingers sort of work and they're
[59:17] doing this and this and this and they
[59:18] drop things and whatnot and all of a
[59:20] sudden they can do that and they can
[59:21] reach out and they can move it but then
[59:23] once they can grab it's not just for the
[59:25] sake of grabbing but now it's for
[59:26] grabbing with a purpose it's to be able
[59:28] to take something and lift it to their
[59:30] mouth to chew on the things that you
[59:31] told them not to chew on right it's to
[59:33] put food into their mouths it's to keep
[59:35] the body fed so it's they have to get
[59:37] the preeminence over the fingers and
[59:39] then they have to blend those fingers in
[59:40] to the purpose of the body so that it
[59:42] can feed so it can protect so that it
[59:44] can move and change things that's what
[59:46] God's doing with us getting the
[59:47] preeminence is in the little fingers and
[59:48] then he now brings them in under the
[59:50] headship of the purpose and the and the
[59:53] growth of the body so that it all works
[59:55] together now in one grand unified plan
[59:57] because the fingers have to work in
[59:58] concert with the head and the feet and
[1:00:00] the rest of the body in that it has a
[1:00:01] purpose and so that's what he's saying
[1:00:03] get the preeminence is in each one of us
[1:00:05] and now integrate it into this beautiful
[1:00:07] Bride of Christ amen so when God has
[1:00:10] when Christ has the preeminence in us we
[1:00:12] will work for one purpose of one purpose
[1:00:14] only we will work together as a unit and
[1:00:17] that's the only way we're going to get
[1:00:19] out of here so he says look if we're at
[1:00:21] the stage where I'm only getting the
[1:00:22] preeminence as in you you got some ways
[1:00:24] to go but if he's got the pre evidences
[1:00:27] in us individually now we're looking to
[1:00:28] see is he using us as a body is he using
[1:00:31] us as a group are we working towards
[1:00:32] this one plan of God to take us away
[1:00:35] into a rapture but we've got a plan and
[1:00:37] a purpose here this is not just to take
[1:00:39] us out but what he's got to have the
[1:00:41] preeminence in his by to express himself
[1:00:42] now through her just as he did through
[1:00:44] Christ amen
[1:00:46] so if you want to see how close you are
[1:00:48] to the rapture my question is how close
[1:00:50] are you and unity you can say I'm
[1:00:52] wonderful I'm ready to go on a rapture
[1:00:54] but if you're sitting at home by
[1:00:55] yourself you're not a part of a body
[1:00:57] you're not even close to a rapture
[1:01:00] because there is a body that needs you
[1:01:02] now right you can sit there and say I'm
[1:01:04] the perfect finger but if that finger is
[1:01:06] not attached to a hand it's not attached
[1:01:08] to an arm it's not attached to a body it
[1:01:09] is of no purpose so that is a question
[1:01:12] he says he's got to have the preeminence
[1:01:13] as in you individually now he's going to
[1:01:15] bring you in so are you attached to a
[1:01:16] body and are you working with that body
[1:01:18] to achieve the purpose of Christ in your
[1:01:20] local area amen what did he say and
[1:01:23] brother balm talks about this in
[1:01:24] restoration the bride tree and what is
[1:01:26] the second last thing that comes back he
[1:01:28] says it's the leaves of fellowship and
[1:01:30] after the leaves of fellowship quickly
[1:01:32] comes now the full manifestation of the
[1:01:34] fruits of the spirit and then were gone
[1:01:36] so that fellowship has to be restored
[1:01:39] not just you with Christ but you with
[1:01:40] each other to work together to achieve
[1:01:42] much right the scripture says what would
[1:01:45] you take one or two sticks they're
[1:01:46] easily broken but what when you have a
[1:01:48] bunch of them together nobody can break
[1:01:50] it and that's the unbreakable body of
[1:01:52] crisis when were unified together under
[1:01:54] his word amen Paul said listen first
[1:01:57] corinthians verse 12 verse 25 he says
[1:01:59] that there should be no schism in the
[1:02:02] body that's a division or a separation
[1:02:04] or even a crack in materials in
[1:02:07] engineering if there is a crack it may
[1:02:09] not have failed but in time it will fail
[1:02:11] if there is a break there so you have to
[1:02:13] fill that crack in and you'll find when
[1:02:14] they do it they can't just fill with
[1:02:16] material but they have to go in and
[1:02:17] grind it out to get the sharp edges out
[1:02:19] and then they fill it back in and then
[1:02:20] it can handle the stress again so he
[1:02:22] says that there should be no cracks that
[1:02:24] there should be no divisions in the body
[1:02:25] but that the members should have the
[1:02:27] same care one for another and whether
[1:02:30] one member suffer all the members suffer
[1:02:32] with it or one member be honored all the
[1:02:34] members rejoice with it he says now ye
[1:02:38] are the body of Christ singular and
[1:02:40] members plural in particular and I'm not
[1:02:44] going to dwell too much in this tonight
[1:02:46] it's a whole sermon in itself but the
[1:02:48] idea is each one of you is here for a
[1:02:50] purpose and only you can do what you are
[1:02:52] meant to do here we have poor
[1:02:54] substitutes sometimes where you have
[1:02:55] somebody with a willing heart that says
[1:02:57] I'm willing to step up and do this for
[1:02:59] the sake of the body but that is not the
[1:03:01] one that's ordained to do it necessarily
[1:03:02] that is one that is filling the place
[1:03:04] until he has the preeminence in you and
[1:03:06] you will step forward into the place
[1:03:07] where you're supposed to be but that's
[1:03:09] what we're looking for is a perfect
[1:03:10] presentation of your gift your attribute
[1:03:13] of Christ into that body amen amen
[1:03:16] we want to get into the preeminence I
[1:03:18] looked it up it says surpassing all
[1:03:20] others superior or distinguished above
[1:03:23] all else so here to write rewrite what
[1:03:25] brother Branham says he says the purpose
[1:03:27] the second purpose would be for Christ
[1:03:29] to have the superiority in his church
[1:03:31] which is his body the bride until he
[1:03:34] could surpass everything within them to
[1:03:36] express himself through them so he's got
[1:03:40] to have Kingdom Authority within you
[1:03:42] before he expresses Kingdom Authority
[1:03:44] outside of you right so he's got to come
[1:03:46] in and he's got to have full control
[1:03:47] over the inside before he can now start
[1:03:50] to move you into the work to do outside
[1:03:52] if you will so the battle is internal
[1:03:54] we're talking about the preeminence now
[1:03:55] and we've got to start with each one of
[1:03:57] us individually does he have the
[1:03:59] preeminence is he getting his kingdom
[1:04:01] Authority inside of me so that he can
[1:04:03] now move that and show it outwardly amen
[1:04:05] so the first manifestation of what by
[1:04:07] the talking about is internal he's got
[1:04:10] to have a work inside of you right the
[1:04:13] the control tower has to be given
[1:04:14] completely to him there's only one way
[1:04:16] you can do that and that is not just by
[1:04:18] sitting under the word and in attending
[1:04:20] a particular church but it is to have
[1:04:22] the very life of God within you it is to
[1:04:23] have the Holy Spirit inside of you and
[1:04:25] we'll talk a bit about that tomorrow
[1:04:27] night god willing but we want to again
[1:04:29] take our scriptural authority I used a
[1:04:31] quote to start but I want to take us
[1:04:33] back to the scriptures here so that we
[1:04:35] can get that so if we can turn in the
[1:04:37] scriptures here very quickly to
[1:04:39] Colossians chapter 1
[1:04:44] my voice is a little rough I'm not used
[1:04:47] to preaching long sermons
[1:04:50] my hands a little sore too I'm not used
[1:04:53] to hitting books in the pulpit
[1:04:55] amen Colossians 1:17 it says and he is
[1:05:00] before all things and by all things
[1:05:01] consist we've read that yesterday seeing
[1:05:03] everything on earth everything in the
[1:05:04] heavens visible invisible it was all
[1:05:06] made by him and though it's fallen out
[1:05:08] of its purpose his its original purpose
[1:05:10] that he created it for yet it was all
[1:05:12] created by him and it's used by him for
[1:05:15] his grand plan of redemption here he
[1:05:16] meant it says for he is the head of the
[1:05:18] body the church who is the beginning the
[1:05:21] firstborn from the dead so if he is the
[1:05:23] beginning and the firstborn that must be
[1:05:25] there therefore mean there are more to
[1:05:27] follow if there is an only child you
[1:05:30] don't call him your firstborn you call
[1:05:31] him my only child but he says I'm the
[1:05:33] firstborn and the beginning so there
[1:05:35] must be something at the end as well not
[1:05:37] just at the beginning there must be many
[1:05:39] more that follow the firstborn to be the
[1:05:41] second born third born fourth or not and
[1:05:43] on down through amen so wide that in all
[1:05:46] things he might have the preeminence
[1:05:48] right but he's talking about what those
[1:05:50] that come after the firstborn right he
[1:05:53] was the firstborn in Christ had that God
[1:05:55] had the preeminence in Christ and now he
[1:05:56] says who is the beginning the first form
[1:05:58] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:06:00] things that follow him is what he's
[1:06:02] talking about he might have the
[1:06:04] preeminence right those that are born of
[1:06:06] the spirit in Christ for please the
[1:06:08] father that in him should all fullness
[1:06:10] dwell but he just said he's going to
[1:06:12] have the preeminence in all things so
[1:06:13] he's looking for what the fullness to be
[1:06:15] expressed what in those that follow
[1:06:17] after him jumping up to verse 25 says
[1:06:20] wherefore
[1:06:21] I Paula made a minister according to the
[1:06:24] dispensation of God which is given to me
[1:06:26] for you to fulfill the Word of God even
[1:06:29] this mystery which has been hidden the
[1:06:31] ages and from generations but now has
[1:06:33] made manifest to his Saints to whom god
[1:06:36] would make known what is the riches of
[1:06:38] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:06:41] gentiles so this is for the gentiles not
[1:06:43] for the jews necessarily I mean the Jews
[1:06:45] could come in but this was expressly
[1:06:46] given to the Gentile bride which is this
[1:06:48] mystery this riches of glory of this
[1:06:51] mystery which is Christ in you the hope
[1:06:53] of glory so what is this mystery it is
[1:06:55] Christ in us the hope of glory amen whom
[1:06:59] we preach warning every man and teaching
[1:07:01] every man in all wisdom that we may
[1:07:04] present every man perfect in Christ
[1:07:06] Jesus so what is the end goal of this
[1:07:08] what is the end result it is that we
[1:07:10] would be presented perfect in Christ
[1:07:12] Jesus
[1:07:13] but he says presented and we we can't a
[1:07:16] glimpse of that when the Prophet you
[1:07:17] know he had that vision of the bride
[1:07:19] going up and he talked about presenting
[1:07:21] his church age presenting the bride of
[1:07:24] this age to Christ and he talked about
[1:07:26] you know what's Paul going to do it and
[1:07:28] yes how how will he be judged and by
[1:07:29] Paul Singh and what not but there's a
[1:07:31] presentation that comes for the bride of
[1:07:34] each age and it's the messenger of each
[1:07:36] age gets to present them to Christ amen
[1:07:38] and Paul talks about this in in 2nd
[1:07:40] Corinthians because what he's talking
[1:07:42] about is is changing now from a
[1:07:43] caretaker role into that marital role
[1:07:46] it's like led a czar to Isaac right Paul
[1:07:48] is only a caretaker
[1:07:50] he wasn't the husband he wasn't the end
[1:07:52] goal he wasn't the one that they married
[1:07:54] they had to listen to him but he was not
[1:07:56] the end goal and he's saying I'm going
[1:07:58] to present you to somebody else so don't
[1:08:00] have a relationship with me don't look
[1:08:02] to me for a relationship look to the one
[1:08:04] that sent me and he's the one that
[1:08:06] you're going to have the relationship in
[1:08:08] 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 2 Paul says
[1:08:10] this for I am jealous over you with
[1:08:12] godly jealousy not spousal jealousy
[1:08:15] godly jealousy he says for I have
[1:08:17] espoused you to one husband I have what
[1:08:21] what he says I've engaged you to
[1:08:24] somebody not to me to somebody else he
[1:08:27] says that I may present you as a chaste
[1:08:31] virgin to Christ
[1:08:34] so unadulterated by his seat as a man
[1:08:36] you do not want it physically for sure
[1:08:39] but even spiritually Paul was not to
[1:08:41] inject anything but to send them to
[1:08:43] Christ that was the only thing he could
[1:08:44] do that what chaste means pure modest
[1:08:47] but catch this immaculate immaculate not
[1:08:51] touched by another man amen so what is
[1:08:55] it it's the mystery of Christ being
[1:08:56] revealed in an election tile blood God
[1:08:59] was expected expressed in Christ the
[1:09:01] firstborn and now he's saying there's
[1:09:03] going to be a second expression that's
[1:09:05] what brother bands talking about he's
[1:09:06] got to have this perfect expression this
[1:09:08] preeminence now in a bride so that's a
[1:09:10] mystery though Paul talks about the
[1:09:13] mystery and it's a mystery to me how God
[1:09:15] is doing that and how he's going to
[1:09:17] finish that work why because we talked
[1:09:19] about last night this badger skin that
[1:09:21] each one of us is wearing I say how can
[1:09:23] God express himself through a badger
[1:09:25] skin like this now Jesus had this this
[1:09:28] advantage we could say because he was
[1:09:30] sinless
[1:09:31] but I don't see sinlessness when I look
[1:09:35] in the mirror and I don't have to walk
[1:09:37] very far to get remind of it on a daily
[1:09:38] basis but that's what we covered last
[1:09:40] night is we actually have the same
[1:09:42] advantage as Jesus Christ we are the
[1:09:45] sinless spotless chaste virgin that is
[1:09:48] espoused to Christ there is no
[1:09:50] difference now between his righteousness
[1:09:51] and my righteousness and we'll get into
[1:09:53] that I have his righteousness there is
[1:09:55] nothing written on my page that can
[1:09:59] condemn me so we don't have a different
[1:10:01] advantage than Christ he didn't have one
[1:10:03] over us what he did have though was a
[1:10:05] fullness a fullness that we don't have
[1:10:08] amen and that's where the real struggle
[1:10:11] is going to happen is in bringing that
[1:10:12] carnality into surrender to what the
[1:10:14] word says about us rather than what our
[1:10:16] flesh would remind us of amen
[1:10:18] but I want to the difficulty for us is
[1:10:22] always this thing called time because we
[1:10:24] look in the word and we see what's
[1:10:26] happening and we see what's going to
[1:10:27] happen but in there there is time and
[1:10:30] and God has this wonderful thing with
[1:10:32] the Jews where he gives them an exact
[1:10:33] calendar
[1:10:35] but the Gentiles he doesn't give them a
[1:10:37] calendar he just says this is what I'm
[1:10:39] going to do and then he walks away and
[1:10:41] when he does that he does it and the the
[1:10:43] elect will catch it and the other ones
[1:10:45] do not
[1:10:46] but there's a time and we don't know
[1:10:47] when that time is going to be so we have
[1:10:49] to sit and we have to wait and we have
[1:10:51] to be ready but it's up to him to
[1:10:53] determine that time but it's a question
[1:10:55] of when not if but that Wayne is the
[1:10:57] most difficult thing of being a
[1:10:59] Christian these days but we want to
[1:11:01] place this in our day because we know
[1:11:03] this is the end time we know beyond a
[1:11:06] shadow of a doubt that this is the end
[1:11:07] time so we want to make sure that we're
[1:11:09] placing this preeminence here that it's
[1:11:11] not for another day and it's not for
[1:11:12] another group of people amen we're going
[1:11:15] to going to go into Revelation so we
[1:11:17] want to start with revelation 10 as you
[1:11:19] turn there again a very familiar
[1:11:21] scripture but we look at this so often
[1:11:23] as a mysterious book and and deep
[1:11:25] revelation in these different things and
[1:11:27] it is and and this is a book to the
[1:11:30] bride certainly the first half of the
[1:11:31] book of Revelation is to the Bride of
[1:11:33] Christ it is specifically for her until
[1:11:36] she goes up and then after that it's
[1:11:38] judgment and we don't it's not that we
[1:11:39] don't care about it but it's not for us
[1:11:40] we don't have to know everything that's
[1:11:42] going to happen to the Jews and all the
[1:11:43] mechanisms inside the tribulation we
[1:11:45] won't be here for it by God's grace but
[1:11:47] this is not just for us to know I mean
[1:11:51] there are things here that we have to
[1:11:52] experience there are things that we have
[1:11:53] to take for ourselves that we have to be
[1:11:55] an expectation for and it has to be a
[1:11:57] part of our life it is not so that we
[1:11:59] can walk out maybe amongst the
[1:12:00] denominations and say do you know what
[1:12:01] the seven seals are do you know what the
[1:12:03] seven church ages were that he didn't
[1:12:06] bring it to us for head knowledge he
[1:12:08] didn't bring it to us so that we could
[1:12:09] say we know more than you more you do
[1:12:11] but he brought it to us so that we would
[1:12:13] have an expectation we would have an
[1:12:14] experience that matches what he writes
[1:12:16] here amen so I want to keep it simple
[1:12:18] and say how what's so special about this
[1:12:21] and how can I do well on it and how can
[1:12:22] it grow me in Christ on a daily basis
[1:12:24] how can how can read them the the tenth
[1:12:27] chapter revelation grow me personally
[1:12:30] because this is for our day and we'll
[1:12:32] get into it but how does that build you
[1:12:33] up day to day how do you take this now a
[1:12:35] great revelation like this and say yeah
[1:12:37] this is going to build my faith on a
[1:12:39] day-by-day basis this is going to help
[1:12:40] me overcome amen let's start with
[1:12:42] revelation 10 verse 1 it says and I saw
[1:12:45] another mighty angel come down from
[1:12:46] heaven it has a number of attributes it
[1:12:49] says he's clothed with a cloud a rainbow
[1:12:51] was upon his head and his face was as it
[1:12:54] were the Sun and his feet as pillars of
[1:12:56] fire now we know who this purely based
[1:12:58] on the description because he's
[1:12:59] described earlier in Revelation chapter
[1:13:02] 1 verse 10 and I'll read it out it's
[1:13:04] very familiar and John says I was in the
[1:13:05] spirit on the Lord's Day and heard
[1:13:07] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:13:08] saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first in
[1:13:12] the last and he said what thou seest
[1:13:15] write in a book and send it unto the
[1:13:17] seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus
[1:13:20] Smyrna Pergamum it's the attire of
[1:13:21] Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea so we
[1:13:23] know this is for the Gentiles right
[1:13:26] those are Gentile churches and Gentile
[1:13:27] countries this is for the Gentiles and I
[1:13:30] turned to see the voice that spake to me
[1:13:32] and being turned I saw seven golden
[1:13:33] candlesticks and then the midst of the
[1:13:35] seven candlesticks one like unto the Son
[1:13:37] of Man clothed with the garment down to
[1:13:39] the foot and Girt about the paps with a
[1:13:41] golden girdle his head and his hairs
[1:13:43] were white like wool right we saw
[1:13:44] clothed with the cloud that's white
[1:13:46] right as white as snow and his eyes were
[1:13:49] as a flame of fire and his feet were
[1:13:51] like unto fine brass that's gold and
[1:13:53] shiny metallic like it said earlier as
[1:13:54] pillars of fire as if they burned in a
[1:13:56] furnace and his voice is a sound of many
[1:13:58] waters so we see this general
[1:14:00] description here of the bright face the
[1:14:03] white head the shining bright feet him
[1:14:05] what not and he tells us in verse 16 who
[1:14:07] this is he says and he had in his right
[1:14:09] hand seven stars and out of his mouth
[1:14:11] went a sharp two-edged sword the word
[1:14:12] and he and his countenance was as a sun
[1:14:15] shine it in his strength when I saw him
[1:14:17] I fell at his feet as dead and he laid
[1:14:19] his right hand upon me saying unto me
[1:14:20] fear not I am the first and the last and
[1:14:24] now he identifies himself completely
[1:14:26] says I am he that liveth and was dead
[1:14:28] and behold I am Alive for evermore amen
[1:14:30] and have the keys of hell and of death
[1:14:32] so we know there's only one person and
[1:14:35] that is Christ that would match that
[1:14:37] description amen but we notice there's a
[1:14:39] slight difference here between
[1:14:40] revelation 1 in revelation 10 it is
[1:14:42] Christ we know what's Christ but there's
[1:14:45] two differences here because it says in
[1:14:47] Revelation 10 that he has a rainbow over
[1:14:49] his head and he's clothed with the cloud
[1:14:51] those are two things that show there is
[1:14:54] a specific event that is going to happen
[1:14:56] in Revelation 10 that is not just about
[1:14:58] Christ but rather there are things tied
[1:15:00] to it that match it to our day amen
[1:15:03] brother Brown says this and the breech
[1:15:05] he says but here comes one down from
[1:15:07] heaven a rainbow covenant see only
[1:15:10] Christ it could be so he says this
[1:15:12] coming Christ in Revelation 10 is in
[1:15:14] answer to a covenant and not just any
[1:15:16] covenant he says but a rainbow covenant
[1:15:18] the rainbow identifies it as a specific
[1:15:20] covenant right so if we read the
[1:15:24] revelation 10 it doesn't say and I saw
[1:15:25] another mighty angel it would say and I
[1:15:27] saw Christ come down from heaven clothed
[1:15:29] with the cloud and a rainbow was upon
[1:15:31] his head and his face was as of where
[1:15:32] the Sun is feet as pillars of fire so
[1:15:35] this is not just a messenger or just we
[1:15:37] say another mighty angel but this is
[1:15:39] Christ himself coming down in a very
[1:15:41] specific event to fulfill a very
[1:15:43] specific covenant to a very specific
[1:15:45] people in a very specific time right
[1:15:48] this is not a general coming this is for
[1:15:50] a covenant that he has already laid in
[1:15:53] the scriptures amen and this is not
[1:15:55] something that anyone else can do but
[1:15:56] Christ himself now we read last night
[1:15:58] that he came down with what an open book
[1:16:00] in his hands so we know that only he
[1:16:02] could open the seals but what's he doing
[1:16:04] with all of this is what we want to get
[1:16:05] into a little bit tonight he meant now
[1:16:07] I'm not going to dwell too much on the
[1:16:08] cold with a cloud part amen except to
[1:16:11] say this you know when Christ came down
[1:16:13] clothed with a cloud based on what
[1:16:14] happens after he came down clothed with
[1:16:17] a cloud and the scripture says in
[1:16:19] Revelation timbres - says and he had in
[1:16:22] his hand a little book open right we
[1:16:24] read the other day in Revelation 5 the
[1:16:26] book was closed but in Revelation
[1:16:27] tenants open so he identifies the time
[1:16:30] when he came down with a cloud as when
[1:16:32] the seals are opened amen and it says
[1:16:35] and he said his right foot upon the sea
[1:16:36] and his left foot on the earth and cried
[1:16:38] with a loud voice as when a lion so not
[1:16:41] a lamb remember he saw him as a he said
[1:16:44] the Lion of the jaw of the tribe of
[1:16:45] Judah has prevailed he saw him as a lamb
[1:16:47] but now when John sees him in Revelation
[1:16:49] 10 there's no more lamb this is a king
[1:16:51] this is the lion now coming for to
[1:16:53] redeem his bride amen he says I saw him
[1:16:56] as when a lion I cried with the loud
[1:16:58] voice as when a lion north and when he
[1:17:00] had cried seven thunders are their
[1:17:02] voices so if the seven thunders have
[1:17:05] been spoken if the seven seals are open
[1:17:07] because that's what was under the
[1:17:08] thunders by the bottom said he said
[1:17:10] those seven thunders were preached under
[1:17:12] those seals because that's what John was
[1:17:13] told not to write when the seven
[1:17:15] thunders uttered he said don't write it
[1:17:17] what could me write what was under those
[1:17:19] seals so if the seals have been open
[1:17:21] then we know Christ must have come down
[1:17:23] clothed with the cloud
[1:17:25] now we look and when the seals were open
[1:17:27] that was 1963 that's what we believe so
[1:17:31] Christ must have come down clothed with
[1:17:32] a cloud before then now listen to what
[1:17:35] brother Branham says about this he says
[1:17:36] that day they took pictures all across
[1:17:38] the southern United States and Mexico
[1:17:39] there it hangs now in Life Magazine do
[1:17:42] we have it here
[1:17:44] right he says there it hangs now in Life
[1:17:48] magazine still a mystery to them but he
[1:17:51] declares it in the heavens before he
[1:17:54] does it on earth he always does that he
[1:17:56] shows his signs in the heavens first now
[1:17:58] I'm not going to say that is Christ well
[1:18:01] the RAM doesn't say that is Christ you
[1:18:02] can believe it that way and it doesn't
[1:18:03] matter to me because it in the end it's
[1:18:05] about what was thus it was it signifying
[1:18:07] right he said he declares it in the
[1:18:11] heavens before he does it so whether we
[1:18:13] think that's Christ or not and some have
[1:18:15] made a doctrine out of it where they
[1:18:16] turn it into a certain thing it doesn't
[1:18:18] matter to me the point is we know that
[1:18:20] after that cloud was shown the seals
[1:18:22] were open so that signified the coming
[1:18:25] of Christ whether that was him or not
[1:18:26] clothed in a cloud you can believe it
[1:18:28] any way you want I believe that was him
[1:18:29] coming down clothed in the cloud that's
[1:18:30] what I believe that makes sense to me
[1:18:32] but after that the seals were opened and
[1:18:35] so we know he must have come down
[1:18:36] clothed with a cloud so because of that
[1:18:39] then we know that Christ has come down
[1:18:41] and he is here now to fulfill this
[1:18:45] rainbow covenant amen
[1:18:48] what was what is a rainbow covenant
[1:18:50] Genesis 9 you're all very familiar with
[1:18:53] this it says and God said this is the
[1:18:55] token of the Covenant the token of the
[1:18:57] Covenant which I make between me and you
[1:18:59] and every living creature that is with
[1:19:01] you for perpetual generations so he says
[1:19:03] forever I do set my bow my rainbow in
[1:19:07] the cloud and this shall be for a token
[1:19:08] of a covenant between me and the earth
[1:19:10] and it shall come to pass when I bring a
[1:19:13] cloud over the earth that the bow shall
[1:19:16] be seen in the cloud and I will remember
[1:19:19] my covenant which is between me and you
[1:19:21] and every living creature of all flesh
[1:19:22] and the waters shall no more become a
[1:19:25] flood to destroy all flesh so we see a
[1:19:28] rainbow is a specific covenant that God
[1:19:30] has with the people but this is not a
[1:19:33] two sided covenant the rainbow covenant
[1:19:35] did not say if you do well then I will
[1:19:38] not ever flood the earth again didn't
[1:19:41] say if you do your part then I'll do my
[1:19:42] part and I won't destroy the earth again
[1:19:44] he says this is between me and you
[1:19:45] forever I will do this and he says I
[1:19:48] will what I will hold back the
[1:19:50] floodwaters of destruction I will never
[1:19:52] again destroy the earth by water amen
[1:19:55] one side of Covenant and this is what we
[1:19:58] have to remember about this covenant
[1:19:59] that Christ is coming down this age and
[1:20:01] that's that you cannot inject yourself
[1:20:03] into this covenant you cannot make
[1:20:05] what's going to happen under this
[1:20:06] covenant happen to yourself right this
[1:20:09] is not going to be of your work it's not
[1:20:11] going to be of your strength it's not
[1:20:12] going to be of your discipline it's not
[1:20:13] going to be of your knowledge this is
[1:20:15] going to be Christ's coming down to do
[1:20:17] what he said and that is it amen it is
[1:20:19] all grace grace grace and then that is I
[1:20:23] believe the eternal cry of the bride is
[1:20:25] Grace because we did nothing to deserve
[1:20:27] it we do nothing to make it happen we
[1:20:29] can encourage we can open it but it's
[1:20:32] his time and his place to come down and
[1:20:34] do this amen we are completely and
[1:20:37] totally reliant on the blood that Christ
[1:20:38] shed on that cross to keep us in a
[1:20:41] condition that he can work with him in
[1:20:45] well the brown said this and show us the
[1:20:48] father he says then I think to happen I
[1:20:51] happen to think again that when John on
[1:20:54] the Isle of Patmos turned around and
[1:20:55] seen this he's seen Jesus sitting there
[1:20:58] to look upon a rainbow this is brother
[1:21:00] by him setting us up for this rainbow
[1:21:02] covenant he said his sardis and Jasper
[1:21:05] stone which was the Reuben and Benjamin
[1:21:07] that's the first son of Jacob and the
[1:21:09] last son of Jacob he which was and which
[1:21:12] is and is to come the root and the
[1:21:14] offspring of David the Morningstar and
[1:21:16] over him was a rainbow with these seven
[1:21:18] golden candlesticks meaning that he had
[1:21:20] a covenant for the seven last Church
[1:21:22] ages
[1:21:24] so what's that covenant it must have
[1:21:27] been declared because he's coming down
[1:21:28] to fulfill it so he must have declared
[1:21:30] it somewhere and listen to what brother
[1:21:32] Brown said there because this is the key
[1:21:33] point he says I saw Jesus sitting there
[1:21:35] to look upon as a rainbow his Sardis and
[1:21:38] Jasper stone which was the Reuben and
[1:21:40] Benjamin the first and the last so
[1:21:43] brother Brendan takes you back to what
[1:21:45] revelation 1 where John says I was in
[1:21:47] the spirit on the Lord's Day and I heard
[1:21:48] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[1:21:50] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[1:21:54] and the last so he ties it back to the
[1:21:57] first mass born of Jacob and he says now
[1:21:59] you have Christ now the first born and
[1:22:01] the last born is the way he puts it
[1:22:02] there so he doesn't say Alpha and Omega
[1:22:05] and everything in between I don't know
[1:22:07] all the other Greek letters I know a
[1:22:08] couple from my engineering degree but
[1:22:09] I've messed them all up but he says I'm
[1:22:11] Alpha and Omega I am A & Z I'm the
[1:22:14] beginning and the end in the middle
[1:22:16] that's not me so he says he's saying I'm
[1:22:19] the eighth I'm at the beginning and I'm
[1:22:20] at the end perfectly expressed but in
[1:22:22] the beginning I'm not I'm starting
[1:22:24] perfect I'm ending perfect but there's
[1:22:26] this process it's now going to happen in
[1:22:28] between amen so we see though that he
[1:22:31] says I'm the first in the last so what
[1:22:32] he started with is what he's going to
[1:22:34] finish with but we're gonna have to go
[1:22:35] through what these seven church ages
[1:22:37] that's a Berber I'm said the Rainbows
[1:22:38] over the entire seven church ages all
[1:22:41] the way through alpha to Omega the
[1:22:44] covenants over that but this is when he
[1:22:45] comes down to fulfill the covenant amen
[1:22:47] amen
[1:22:49] are you with me
[1:22:51] so we know the seed because he remember
[1:22:54] he talked about he's the firstborn he
[1:22:55] had to die that many could come out
[1:22:57] after and we'll get into that now a bit
[1:22:58] because the the key is that what goes
[1:23:00] into the ground must come out of the
[1:23:02] ground and then we get into the sea
[1:23:03] principle and brother Lonnie Jenkins
[1:23:05] does a really beautiful job of this in
[1:23:06] in the revelation series I'll cover a
[1:23:08] little bit of here because he ports us
[1:23:10] back to Genesis 1 it says and God said
[1:23:12] let the earth bring forth grass the herb
[1:23:14] yielding seed the fruit tree yielding
[1:23:16] fruit after his kind whose seed is in
[1:23:18] itself whose seed is in itself not in
[1:23:21] another in itself upon the earth and it
[1:23:23] was so and the earth brought forth grass
[1:23:25] and herb yielding seed after his kind
[1:23:26] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[1:23:28] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[1:23:31] that it was good it meant so weird to be
[1:23:33] born again of the seed incorruptible
[1:23:35] which is the Word of God which was
[1:23:36] buried in Christ and now is to come back
[1:23:38] in a bride Amen as he rose again so we
[1:23:41] have to rise again from the same
[1:23:42] planting but we saw then there that he
[1:23:45] was not just in Christ but he moved into
[1:23:47] an alpha church the the original
[1:23:48] Pentecostal church amen so we see here
[1:23:51] that it's two different times John 12:23
[1:23:54] says this and jesus answered to them
[1:23:56] saying the hours come that the Son of
[1:23:58] man should be glorified barely barely I
[1:24:00] say unto you except a corn he says a
[1:24:02] kernel or a seed of wheat falling the
[1:24:05] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:24:07] it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:24:09] that's what he's talking to now about
[1:24:11] himself he says I have to die and be
[1:24:12] planted so that now more of me will come
[1:24:14] up and when you plan one do you get one
[1:24:16] or do you get many right when that one
[1:24:19] dies you are many pleasant ones that are
[1:24:20] scattered and now you bring up more and
[1:24:22] it just multiplies itself over and over
[1:24:24] again so he was the seed that was
[1:24:26] planted in there and now he's saying now
[1:24:28] in the end we've got the same thing
[1:24:29] that's going to come back again and then
[1:24:31] so he's planted into the ground we know
[1:24:33] that he rose again but that alpha is not
[1:24:35] just Christ but it is that original
[1:24:37] Pentecostal church and we'll get into
[1:24:39] that a little more heavily tomorrow to
[1:24:40] show you how he does that but that word
[1:24:42] came back into the body of believers and
[1:24:45] up in an upper room in Jerusalem a
[1:24:46] hundred and twenty of them received that
[1:24:48] seed into their souls and they again
[1:24:51] reflected the perfect life of Christ no
[1:24:53] we talked about it last night that they
[1:24:54] did not express it in the way we will in
[1:24:56] that they did not go in a rapture but
[1:24:58] they were still the perfect expression
[1:24:59] of Christ that church had no
[1:25:01] denomination it had no group of men
[1:25:04] telling them what to do and leading them
[1:25:05] in different directions
[1:25:06] he said go there tarry till your endued
[1:25:09] with power from on high and then out you
[1:25:10] go and that's what they did and the Lord
[1:25:12] added to them daily such as were needed
[1:25:14] and then they were out showing signs and
[1:25:16] wonders and ministering and this and
[1:25:17] that and the other thing in perfect
[1:25:19] unity and we know that unity because on
[1:25:21] the the day of Pentecost they only had
[1:25:22] one that was supposed to speak and they
[1:25:24] didn't fight about it Peter comes up he
[1:25:26] stands up nobody's saying hey let me do
[1:25:28] it Peter I got this Peter stands up and
[1:25:30] he speaks so well and the Lord moves so
[1:25:33] powerfully that they added 3,000 souls
[1:25:35] in one day not 3,000 souls that went
[1:25:38] away but 3,000 souls and then it K
[1:25:39] continued there and they build it up and
[1:25:41] it moved out and all of a sudden the the
[1:25:43] priests are worried why because this
[1:25:44] church has sprung up so quickly and it's
[1:25:46] powerful it has a life that follows
[1:25:49] behind it amen it's a very wonderful
[1:25:51] thing that was the Alpha Church amen and
[1:25:54] you say how do you know that was the
[1:25:56] Alpha Church because look at what he
[1:25:58] said to Saul when he knocked him off of
[1:25:59] his horse he said Paul why do you
[1:26:02] persecute persecute me
[1:26:05] he identified them as himself Paul
[1:26:09] wasn't persecuting Christ the man that
[1:26:11] had died and rose again he was
[1:26:12] persecuting a church he was persecuting
[1:26:15] a body of believers but when Christ
[1:26:16] knocks him off the horse and speaks from
[1:26:18] that light he says Paul Saul why do you
[1:26:20] persecute me he identifies them as the
[1:26:24] same as him so that is the Alpha Church
[1:26:26] that we see so you see a pattern now you
[1:26:28] see a Christ ministry and then you see
[1:26:31] the church that follows an expression in
[1:26:33] a multi-member body amen
[1:26:36] the only reason they didn't go in a
[1:26:38] rapture was because God's plan was to
[1:26:39] spread it out into all eight all ages
[1:26:41] and all generations and all tongues and
[1:26:43] nations it had to go everywhere I think
[1:26:45] we're very close now I think there's
[1:26:47] only a couple left not just people but
[1:26:49] there are some tribes and nations that
[1:26:50] haven't heard yet and they're trying
[1:26:51] very hard to get to them but that is the
[1:26:53] last thing when that's done we get to go
[1:26:55] when the last one's brought in causes
[1:26:57] the door hey that's filthy be filthy
[1:26:59] still he that's holy be holy still amen
[1:27:01] they started out perfectly but they too
[1:27:04] had to die why so that there could be
[1:27:06] another rising come up in the end right
[1:27:08] revelation 2 he's speaking to the the
[1:27:10] Church of Ephesus he says nevertheless
[1:27:12] have somewhat against thee because thou
[1:27:14] hast left thy first love
[1:27:17] the Holy Spirit had perfect unity and
[1:27:20] was was working perfectly the gifts were
[1:27:22] there to keep the church clean and all
[1:27:23] these things he says what you left your
[1:27:25] first love the Wolves Paul warned they I
[1:27:27] fear that the wolves have gotten in
[1:27:29] among you and they're tearing you apart
[1:27:30] and you know the plans of men are
[1:27:32] starting to have their effect on that
[1:27:33] and that's what happened was they
[1:27:34] started replacing the true baptism of
[1:27:37] the Holy Spirit the indwelling life of
[1:27:38] God with what the deceits in the slate
[1:27:41] of of men as we talked about earlier
[1:27:43] there's a plan that they were saying we
[1:27:44] can leverage this we can use this to our
[1:27:47] own benefit and the Holy Spirit just
[1:27:48] slowly started backing away and then
[1:27:50] they went down right they started dying
[1:27:52] and so we see it here remember the light
[1:27:53] is here and in the beginning it would
[1:27:55] have been perfectly white because there
[1:27:57] under perfect fellowship perfect unity
[1:27:59] right they were all with one Accord in
[1:28:01] the in the upper room all in wondercore
[1:28:03] that's the unity of the spirit right
[1:28:04] there so that's perfectly light but by
[1:28:06] the time they end him 8170 they lost the
[1:28:10] majority of the power within the church
[1:28:11] right and so what happens now darkness
[1:28:14] comes in until we get to the fourth
[1:28:15] church age and that's when it's fully
[1:28:17] rotten there was no power there in the
[1:28:19] fourth church age there's virtually
[1:28:20] nothing happening it was a very select
[1:28:22] few but now as it starts to rise up is
[1:28:24] that rotting is complete now the life
[1:28:25] starts to come forth again and in this
[1:28:28] age we get the full manifestation
[1:28:29] now I want you to see here that he we
[1:28:32] show a bit of light but when the angel
[1:28:34] drew this out on the wall for brother
[1:28:35] Brandon was there any light at seven
[1:28:37] church age why not because at the end we
[1:28:40] read in revelation three he's outside
[1:28:42] the church if he's outside the church
[1:28:44] how can he be in here because God did
[1:28:46] work through the churches through here
[1:28:47] where are we I don't want to calm
[1:28:50] organizations but there were groups of
[1:28:51] people that he was using there right
[1:28:53] he'd use Martin right Martin Luther and
[1:28:56] these different ones right he would use
[1:28:58] them so he's working in a group but then
[1:29:00] they always denominated and threw him
[1:29:01] out again but here he gets out and he's
[1:29:03] thrown out for the last time and that's
[1:29:05] why we say we're no longer a part of
[1:29:07] Laodicea when you come out of that now
[1:29:08] you're into a bright age because that's
[1:29:10] the only place that Christ is Christ is
[1:29:12] no longer working in the church he says
[1:29:13] come out of her my people stands outside
[1:29:15] the door knocks amen amen
[1:29:18] so in between the planting here right
[1:29:21] they died and they're planted there's
[1:29:23] this necessary process that it has to go
[1:29:25] through to go all the way through
[1:29:26] rotting so that it can then start to
[1:29:28] grow back in in fullness and newness
[1:29:30] amen so at no point does ever Christ
[1:29:33] fully manifested in here he started here
[1:29:36] and there's nothing here you have brief
[1:29:38] moments they had signs and wonders all
[1:29:39] throughout here it's not that it's not
[1:29:42] just signs and wonders but it's a
[1:29:43] perfect expression of Christ it's a
[1:29:45] fully overcoming power in your life that
[1:29:48] will give us the full expression here
[1:29:50] right so that he can use you not just
[1:29:52] preeminence in you but preeminence in a
[1:29:54] group and use you powerfully because as
[1:29:56] a group we're way stronger than we are
[1:29:57] individually amen
[1:30:00] I'm dancing around my notes here amen
[1:30:04] but this is the point is that he makes
[1:30:07] this mighty manifestation here and then
[1:30:09] he makes it here in this bride age and
[1:30:10] that's the only place he says I'm gonna
[1:30:11] do it I'm Alpha and Omega Christ in the
[1:30:14] beginning Christ in the end but in the
[1:30:15] middle he's just doing a partial work if
[1:30:17] we could put it that way it's a dark
[1:30:20] dismal day like Zacharias says in
[1:30:22] chapter 14 verse 7 he says but it shall
[1:30:24] be one day which shall be known to the
[1:30:26] Lord not day nor night but it shall come
[1:30:28] to pass that at the evening time it
[1:30:30] shall be light all right so we see here
[1:30:33] now at the end time what is it it's very
[1:30:35] dark over here but he says there's an
[1:30:37] evening light that comes here and that's
[1:30:39] where the bride is found amen then as we
[1:30:42] as brother Jared was saying like don't
[1:30:43] just see the light walk in the light
[1:30:45] to see the lighthouse at a distance is
[1:30:47] no good if you don't you don't heed
[1:30:49] what's going on there he says what walk
[1:30:50] in the light so that that end is what
[1:30:52] we're looking for him in and what is it
[1:30:56] that happened he sends a prophet with a
[1:30:57] message to do what not draws to the
[1:31:00] prophet but to point us back to the work
[1:31:02] and to show us what's supposed to happen
[1:31:04] these days to show us all those things
[1:31:05] that happened so we can recognize where
[1:31:07] we are today right so what is the what
[1:31:10] is the Covenant he's coming to fulfill
[1:31:12] it's that Alpha and Omega but it has two
[1:31:14] phases we know this
[1:31:17] right we know that Ministry of brother
[1:31:19] Branham was brought back to what turned
[1:31:21] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:31:23] faith of the Pentecostal fathers that's
[1:31:24] what he said not the Pentecostal church
[1:31:26] today but the original Pentecost which
[1:31:29] is the Holy Spirit moving in his people
[1:31:31] amen because what he says it behold I
[1:31:33] will send you Elijah the Prophet before
[1:31:34] the coming of the Great and dreadful day
[1:31:36] of the Lord he shall turn the hearts of
[1:31:38] the fathers to the children John's
[1:31:40] ministry and the hearts of the children
[1:31:41] to their fathers that's the second
[1:31:43] Elijah that the the following Elijah
[1:31:45] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[1:31:47] curse and then we know where was to
[1:31:48] reveal the the mysteries of the seven
[1:31:50] seals part of revelation 10 chapter 10
[1:31:53] verse 7 because it says in the days of
[1:31:55] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:31:57] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:31:58] should be finished now what is the
[1:32:00] mystery of God the mystery of God
[1:32:03] remember Paul says this Christ in you
[1:32:05] the hope of glory right
[1:32:07] we have ministry sitting here and there
[1:32:09] talking about the mysteries the seven
[1:32:10] seals is no brother this is in you the
[1:32:13] seventh seal is not at words on a page
[1:32:15] it's not a mystery that that Satan could
[1:32:17] corrupt and that's why brother Branham
[1:32:18] says you can't write it down because
[1:32:19] otherwise Satan were corrupted but what
[1:32:21] does he do he writes it in the fleshly
[1:32:22] tables of your heart he puts it inside
[1:32:24] of you and gives us an inheritance
[1:32:25] incorruptible so that we can now Express
[1:32:28] the mystery he says what the mystery
[1:32:30] should be finished completed right Alpha
[1:32:34] Omega he says as he had declared to his
[1:32:36] servants the prophets but before he did
[1:32:38] that he had to break the seven seals and
[1:32:39] without those seven seals you can't go
[1:32:41] into that rapture because that's what
[1:32:42] gives us rapture in faith now why is it
[1:32:44] give us rapture in faith because it
[1:32:47] tells us this is rapture time
[1:32:48] everybody else in Christianity is
[1:32:51] believed well not all of them actually
[1:32:52] that's the scary thing they're believing
[1:32:53] for a rapture some of them after the
[1:32:55] tribulation so that's definitely not
[1:32:57] going to happen and that one's that are
[1:32:59] believing before it comes it comes
[1:33:01] before the tribulation but if they don't
[1:33:03] know that this is rapture season how are
[1:33:05] they going to have wrap between faith
[1:33:06] because they're believing for a way and
[1:33:07] any time rapture amen but we know we
[1:33:10] have a word that comes to us and says
[1:33:12] today is rapture season and then this is
[1:33:14] the time that I have declared and now is
[1:33:17] when you want to be looking for a
[1:33:19] rapture not with hope but with
[1:33:21] expectation with a revelation with the
[1:33:23] knowledge that today is the day and if
[1:33:26] it's not today it's tomorrow with a
[1:33:27] certainty that he is going to come and
[1:33:29] take a spotless bride away amen
[1:33:32] so this Omega promise is nothing less
[1:33:34] than the promise that we will be a
[1:33:35] church with the full life and expression
[1:33:37] of God collectively
[1:33:39] collectively and I want to hit that
[1:33:41] again if we are sitting at home we are
[1:33:44] not going in this rapture I'm sorry a
[1:33:46] brother came to our church and said one
[1:33:48] of the most amazing things I've ever
[1:33:49] heard he said in the scripture a sheep
[1:33:52] by itself is always described as lost
[1:33:57] sheep by itself is always described as
[1:34:01] lost a sheep by itself will not survive
[1:34:03] it needs a shepherd it needs the great
[1:34:05] Shepherd but he gave us Shepherds here
[1:34:07] on earth to handle that situation amen
[1:34:09] and then that one's for free we have a
[1:34:11] pastor here so we're okay
[1:34:15] amen the brown said this and Jehovah
[1:34:19] Jireh says God was showing there to
[1:34:20] Abraham that through his seed that God
[1:34:23] Himself will become flesh and then have
[1:34:25] to be separated at Calvary where Christ
[1:34:27] being God on earth he was separated God
[1:34:29] tore him apart the royal seed of Abraham
[1:34:31] and took the life out of him and raised
[1:34:34] up the body up to sit on his throne in
[1:34:36] heaven and sent back the spirit of him
[1:34:38] upon the church that the church has to
[1:34:40] have the same spirit that was in Christ
[1:34:42] to make it come together you cannot
[1:34:45] unify in this body unless you have the
[1:34:47] Spirit of Christ they meant
[1:34:48] making Christ now listen to this
[1:34:51] hallelujah says making Christ the same
[1:34:53] yesterday today and forever brother
[1:34:56] Brown what do you talk about he said my
[1:34:57] message is to declare him that he's here
[1:34:59] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:35:01] and forever yesterday Jesus Christ we
[1:35:04] have a prophet company shows us Christ
[1:35:06] in our day but he says forever so after
[1:35:07] he's gone there has to be at Christ that
[1:35:09] continues on this earth named as in and
[1:35:12] is expressed in the exact same way he
[1:35:15] says I'm the he says God separated he
[1:35:17] says listen us he says Jesus Christ the
[1:35:19] same yesterday today and further
[1:35:21] confirmation of the Covenant God
[1:35:23] confirming the Covenant that is what
[1:35:26] he's talking about here in Revelation 10
[1:35:27] God's separating tearing the life from
[1:35:29] crisis on taking the spirit out of him
[1:35:31] as he cut those animals into standing
[1:35:33] between them the light God Himself went
[1:35:36] between them showing that he separated
[1:35:37] the body the seed the roll seed and took
[1:35:39] the spirit and sent it back upon the
[1:35:42] church and the Church of today that goes
[1:35:44] to meet Christ will have to have the
[1:35:46] same spirit that he had because it'll
[1:35:48] have to be letter by letter word by word
[1:35:51] why he is the word jesus said he
[1:35:54] personal pronoun that believes in me the
[1:35:57] works that I do shall he do also
[1:35:58] confirming the Covenant the life that's
[1:36:01] in Christ will be in the church the
[1:36:02] Royal seed of Abraham so this end time
[1:36:06] is what Christ the Anointed One
[1:36:08] manifesting himself in an Omega church
[1:36:10] as he did in the Alpha Church amen and
[1:36:14] we know in our day he came just as he
[1:36:16] did in that day he came as Christ make
[1:36:19] no mistake that message and that
[1:36:22] Ministry of William Branham was Christ
[1:36:24] coming down but they turned it into
[1:36:27] worship of a prophet and it had nothing
[1:36:29] to do with that prophet that was Christ
[1:36:31] there when he stands and he turns his
[1:36:33] back and does exactly what he did in the
[1:36:35] days of Abraham and Sarah right before
[1:36:37] when the Covenant coming forth when he
[1:36:40] said the promise is for you and you I'm
[1:36:42] gonna make a great nation of you and
[1:36:43] sale we'll have a child what do you do
[1:36:45] right before he comes he turns his back
[1:36:47] and he listens and guess what what does
[1:36:49] he hear he hears doubt right how is this
[1:36:52] going to happen and then this mystery
[1:36:54] and flesh how is this going to happen
[1:36:55] how is life going to come forth he says
[1:36:58] in the time appointed right in the
[1:37:00] season appointed now I'm going to come
[1:37:02] forth and and Sarah right I've come down
[1:37:06] and Sarah now is going to bring forth a
[1:37:07] child she's gonna bring forth the life
[1:37:10] that he promised amen
[1:37:12] that's what brother Branham does he
[1:37:14] stands there he gives the word he points
[1:37:16] us to our place and then he stands he
[1:37:18] turns around and he says what Christ is
[1:37:20] here he doesn't just say it but he shows
[1:37:22] it in a way that nobody else did before
[1:37:24] take no ecology could prove him wrong
[1:37:25] before they have wireless this and
[1:37:27] miniature that and CIA technology and
[1:37:29] all these things before it was ever
[1:37:31] there he stands there he walks through
[1:37:32] and he discerns the thoughts and intents
[1:37:34] of the heart why to say Christ is here
[1:37:37] not me a son a man revealing these son
[1:37:40] of men why there was doubt in the people
[1:37:43] as the scripture says when the Son of
[1:37:45] Man comes will he find faith
[1:37:46] not just faith we need faith for healing
[1:37:49] why to get to a rapture right that
[1:37:52] healing is just the earnest of our of
[1:37:54] our new body and how are you gonna have
[1:37:56] rapturing faith if you don't know that
[1:37:57] now is the time right something's got to
[1:37:59] be pulling on you you've got to be
[1:38:01] looking for the better Brown talks ye
[1:38:03] says before God does something he sends
[1:38:05] the Holy Spirit with an unction to the
[1:38:07] people to have what calling for calling
[1:38:10] for it how many are out there today
[1:38:11] calling for a rapture how many of them
[1:38:14] are out there say is brother JL was
[1:38:15] talking about last night I am raptured I
[1:38:17] am I am lifted up I am raised up I have
[1:38:20] been what resurrected how many are
[1:38:23] saying that we say it because we know it
[1:38:26] is time but we've got to make sure it's
[1:38:28] an experience of our time not just a
[1:38:30] knowledge of it right this let's face it
[1:38:33] the message books are open there's
[1:38:35] nobody stopping anybody from going in
[1:38:36] there and reading them and catching the
[1:38:37] truth and then but you've got to have an
[1:38:39] experience that matches what he's
[1:38:41] talking about so this rob stream faith
[1:38:43] is what knowing that this is the time
[1:38:45] and he's doing the work of me and I'm
[1:38:47] seeing that rapture unfold in my body
[1:38:49] amen
[1:38:51] so we saw that as that what that that
[1:38:54] sheaf offering that's what Christ was
[1:38:55] right before that that Pentecostal
[1:38:58] church came he was what he was that
[1:38:59] sheaf offering the first board and then
[1:39:01] he moves into them and he does the same
[1:39:02] works and then in our age he comes he
[1:39:04] does the exact same ministry right the
[1:39:06] exact same ministry unfolding in his in
[1:39:09] the words that he spoke in the sense
[1:39:11] that if he said it it was true I
[1:39:13] remember a story where a sister was at
[1:39:15] the meetings and her friend went up and
[1:39:18] under discernment brother bottom he gave
[1:39:21] her name and he gave her her address and
[1:39:22] the sister that was sitting in the in
[1:39:25] there knew her address and she said
[1:39:27] that's wrong he's wrong on her address
[1:39:29] and she went up to the sister afterwards
[1:39:31] after she'd been healed of all things
[1:39:33] and and said um you don't live there how
[1:39:37] come didn't correct him she said I moved
[1:39:40] last week I moved last week and he told
[1:39:43] her what the address was where she lived
[1:39:45] right never proven wrong why because the
[1:39:47] word is speaking and the word cannot
[1:39:49] fail he meant the words of a mountain
[1:39:51] will fail right I don't pretend to think
[1:39:54] that the message in every single one of
[1:39:55] those books is perfect in and of itself
[1:39:57] but the word that he brought forth that
[1:39:59] he matched up to Scripture he corrects
[1:40:01] those errors and he brings us down he
[1:40:03] points us to the word said I can now go
[1:40:05] in here and I can preach directly from
[1:40:07] this I was talking with our brother here
[1:40:09] and I said would we be able today to
[1:40:12] walk into a message church and not read
[1:40:13] a quote what we have the maturity to say
[1:40:17] this is an open book and if I never read
[1:40:19] you from a quote again will we be able
[1:40:21] to accept it would you be able to
[1:40:24] because he didn't point us to the
[1:40:25] message books he didn't say if you want
[1:40:27] to get closer to God plate he didn't say
[1:40:29] play the tapes he said read your Bible
[1:40:31] and pray so what the Holy Spirit if he's
[1:40:34] come he's going to lead you into all
[1:40:36] truth while we believe that those
[1:40:38] messages were opening up the truths that
[1:40:39] were already in here but you don't have
[1:40:42] to read a message book to have truth in
[1:40:44] the sense that that is not our absolute
[1:40:46] it is the scripture that is our absolute
[1:40:48] and we've got to be able to line it up
[1:40:49] in here talking with brother mark about
[1:40:51] this he says he doesn't like to throw
[1:40:52] quotes back and forth why because the
[1:40:54] quotes are not my absolute I'm sorry I
[1:40:57] disagree with jeffersonville on that the
[1:40:58] quotes are not the absolute the Word of
[1:41:00] God as he's expressing here that's what
[1:41:02] he says if you add one word or take one
[1:41:04] word away he says that's when you're in
[1:41:06] trouble amen so anything that points us
[1:41:08] to the word I'll take it but we've got
[1:41:10] to go back to the word on it amen amen
[1:41:13] so this is the restoration covenant to
[1:41:16] Malachi for is an Omega church not just
[1:41:19] the son of man ministry because that's
[1:41:21] what he does but we don't just look to
[1:41:23] the son of man ministry but what that he
[1:41:24] is restoring the hearts of the children
[1:41:26] to the father's and then he's bringing
[1:41:28] us back into a condition that he had
[1:41:29] before
[1:41:31] but what did the opening of the seals
[1:41:33] show because what is the opening of the
[1:41:36] seals what is it revealing program said
[1:41:38] the church ages was was the church and
[1:41:40] how things move through history but he
[1:41:42] says the seals were Christ Christ moving
[1:41:44] through the churches now I want to ask
[1:41:46] you
[1:41:47] do you think they saw the great plan of
[1:41:50] God when they're here in the Dark Ages
[1:41:53] how many of them saw the purpose of God
[1:41:55] as they were down there how about in the
[1:41:57] First Church ages they were slaughtered
[1:41:58] right as they walked willingly into the
[1:42:01] the arenas and they were cut down one by
[1:42:03] one and mothers losing their children
[1:42:04] and cut in half and and all these
[1:42:06] different things they did not see the
[1:42:08] purpose in the plan of God but in the
[1:42:10] last stage he comes here and he says
[1:42:12] this is what I was doing all through it
[1:42:14] and that's why a prophet can call the
[1:42:15] Holocaust the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:42:17] because he can see the purpose and the
[1:42:19] plan of God and what he's doing not only
[1:42:21] in the Gentiles but he's he gives us a
[1:42:22] little nugget of the Jews but he points
[1:42:24] us there so that we can see what he was
[1:42:26] doing through here and how we had it and
[1:42:28] we lost it and the effects of those loss
[1:42:30] and the different things that he's
[1:42:31] having to restore he goes there but he
[1:42:33] shows us that that Christ was in it all
[1:42:35] so that even when you don't see him even
[1:42:39] when you look at yourself and you can't
[1:42:40] see Christ yet Christ is there that he
[1:42:43] is moving whether or not you recognize
[1:42:45] it and that he is not going to be
[1:42:46] frustrated by the way things are here
[1:42:48] he's not going to be stopped he's not
[1:42:50] going to be slowed down but the plan of
[1:42:51] God is going to move on regardless right
[1:42:53] so when it seems like nothing is
[1:42:55] happening or worse when it seems like
[1:42:56] we're going backwards that does not mean
[1:42:59] God is not moving what it says he'll
[1:43:01] withhold no good thing from his kid from
[1:43:03] his children says all things work
[1:43:05] together for the good of them that are
[1:43:06] the called so when we don't see the
[1:43:09] purpose when we don't see the plan these
[1:43:10] seven seals are open so that we can say
[1:43:12] it looked miserable through here and
[1:43:14] look miserable and then look at what God
[1:43:16] had God did there and look what he
[1:43:18] achieved and look how he cut away this
[1:43:19] and look how he took away that look how
[1:43:21] he brought you back to this and that and
[1:43:22] the other things so that what we could
[1:43:23] see even though it doesn't appear
[1:43:25] sometimes that were closer than we were
[1:43:27] yesterday or last month or last year yet
[1:43:29] God is moving I was talking again with
[1:43:32] by mark and sister Moria I said that
[1:43:33] sometimes the the greatest benefit of
[1:43:35] being in fellowship with people and
[1:43:37] being in the body of Christ is that they
[1:43:38] can see a change in you far better than
[1:43:40] you can
[1:43:41] they can see what God is doing in your
[1:43:44] life far better than you can because for
[1:43:46] you it's just a millimeter a day but
[1:43:48] they don't see you maybe for a couple
[1:43:49] days or a week or these different things
[1:43:51] or they may have seen you react a
[1:43:53] certain way in a situation last year and
[1:43:55] then this whole thing comes around
[1:43:56] because that's what God does is you
[1:43:58] react poorly and he brings it back
[1:43:59] around again after he's worked on you a
[1:44:01] bit to see if you'll react the proper
[1:44:03] way and he'll keep you in that cycle
[1:44:04] until you do it and guess what one day
[1:44:06] you pass the cycle and you move on
[1:44:08] everyone says what happened to Paul
[1:44:09] Coffey
[1:44:11] Paul doesn't even know he doesn't even
[1:44:14] realize what's happened right
[1:44:16] but mark I just had wonderful Prussia we
[1:44:19] talked about that Roman we were you know
[1:44:20] the little woman bill brown talked about
[1:44:22] people went in they came out and things
[1:44:23] have been restored and changed and
[1:44:24] healed they said what happened we don't
[1:44:26] know let me tell you how you got over
[1:44:29] that besetting sin tell me how you got
[1:44:32] over it tell me how you got over your
[1:44:34] temper how tell me how you got over your
[1:44:35] complexes tell me how you got healed you
[1:44:39] can't do it but he does it and it's
[1:44:42] indescribable but when he does it you
[1:44:44] know you know what he's put that limb
[1:44:46] back you know when he's replaced
[1:44:47] something you know when he's cut that
[1:44:49] tumor out of your life but you can't
[1:44:51] tell me how he did it
[1:44:53] can't tell you how he did it but he did
[1:44:55] it that's what he's saying here that's
[1:44:57] why he opened all this up though it
[1:45:00] looks like he did nothing yet he was
[1:45:02] moving through it all he had a purpose
[1:45:03] and a plan because in this age the the
[1:45:05] most wicked the most complex the most
[1:45:08] difficult age it's gonna look sometimes
[1:45:11] like we're not getting anywhere it's not
[1:45:13] what we're getting it's good where he's
[1:45:15] getting us in it right that's why they
[1:45:17] embraced these trials and these
[1:45:19] temptations that come our way because
[1:45:20] why God's doing a work in us amen amen
[1:45:24] hallelujah
[1:45:26] Philippians 1:6 says being confident of
[1:45:29] this very thing that he which he which
[1:45:32] had begun a good work in you will
[1:45:33] perform it until the day of Christ you
[1:45:36] know what that tells me you're only
[1:45:38] going to be done the day we go
[1:45:40] when anybody says I'm ready to go we're
[1:45:43] ready to go in the sense that we want to
[1:45:44] get out of here amen but we're not ready
[1:45:46] to go until we go because the day we go
[1:45:49] we're all ready to go as a unified body
[1:45:51] not just one or two or three but each
[1:45:53] one of us is step perfectly in so that
[1:45:55] we have that perfect statue of a man in
[1:45:57] it under the headship of Christ amen
[1:45:58] what faith that ought to build up to it
[1:46:00] in us that he is not going to stop until
[1:46:02] he's done and when he's done he's done
[1:46:04] and he takes us I believe that's why the
[1:46:06] scripture says it'll be a quick short
[1:46:07] work because that end will just be we
[1:46:10] don't see much happening but I think
[1:46:12] then things will start to it's like the
[1:46:13] dominoes little things start to go over
[1:46:15] I saw video of a demonstration of the
[1:46:18] power of a small Domino and they started
[1:46:20] out with this tiny little Domino you
[1:46:22] know and I want to say was about an inch
[1:46:24] tall and
[1:46:26] they put it next to one that was this
[1:46:28] tall and then one that was next to this
[1:46:30] tall and I think the ratio was one two
[1:46:32] three so if this was one this would be
[1:46:34] three this would be nine and on and in
[1:46:36] the end they had a domino that was this
[1:46:38] tall and weighed something like six
[1:46:40] hundred pounds I think
[1:46:41] and you know what they did they tipped
[1:46:44] this one and it hits with just enough
[1:46:47] force to this one and knocks that one
[1:46:51] down and this one and it's just enough
[1:46:53] to get it there but it just starts
[1:46:55] speeding up as it goes and boom the last
[1:46:58] one goes and it's done the smallest
[1:47:00] little victory builds you up to the next
[1:47:03] victory in the next trial and then as
[1:47:04] that falls down this one but let me tell
[1:47:07] you is that time starts to hit and
[1:47:09] things start to click and all of a
[1:47:10] sudden it's not a battle it used to be
[1:47:12] and things step in front of you and you
[1:47:14] now start to speak to that what they
[1:47:16] start to fall quicker and quicker and
[1:47:17] quicker and then you go into eternity
[1:47:19] and you're done amen amen
[1:47:22] hallelujah now
[1:47:24] I've got something on my page
[1:47:27] amen amen
[1:47:33] within pretty much within everything but
[1:47:36] within the message I feel we're
[1:47:37] particularly good at pointing to what
[1:47:39] God did and it's a wonderful thing but I
[1:47:42] think sometimes it's our greatest
[1:47:43] failing because we're so busy looking at
[1:47:46] what has been done that we're not
[1:47:48] focused on what's going on now and we're
[1:47:51] really good at looking towards the
[1:47:52] future is anybody looking for the
[1:47:54] rapture and then I don't think it's just
[1:47:56] me we're looking forward to it but
[1:47:58] brother Brown said this he says they
[1:47:59] always miss it man is forever praising
[1:48:02] God for what he did do looking forward
[1:48:04] to what he will be and ignoring what he
[1:48:05] is doing that's just the nature of man
[1:48:08] he hasn't changed his nature the man of
[1:48:09] the world I
[1:48:11] told Joe today a ship doesn't sail on
[1:48:13] yesterday's wind
[1:48:14] yesterday's victory isn't going to push
[1:48:16] you today you've got to be victorious
[1:48:18] day over day there's got to be a dying
[1:48:20] out that happens day after day can't be
[1:48:22] he healed me last year or he delivered
[1:48:25] me this no no what's he doing today
[1:48:28] as your faithful what is he doing it to
[1:48:30] you and responding and faithfulness back
[1:48:32] came in this is here now this is today
[1:48:35] and that's why you know this is where
[1:48:37] the rubber starts to meet the road and
[1:48:38] tomorrow especially God willing but we
[1:48:41] don't want to be looking back we don't
[1:48:43] want to rest in what he's done and leave
[1:48:45] it there because that should be the
[1:48:47] faith that tells us what he's doing now
[1:48:49] and that as that unction comes across us
[1:48:51] so we would now look in expectation for
[1:48:53] the needs that we see for the
[1:48:55] deliverance that we require for the
[1:48:56] salvation that's needed within our
[1:48:58] families amen all of these things it
[1:48:59] should be pushing us to look for those
[1:49:02] victories in to claim them amen and like
[1:49:04] Abraham though he sees nothing to speak
[1:49:06] of them in faith until they come to
[1:49:08] fruition 25 years 25 years and it was
[1:49:11] only in the 24th year that God comes
[1:49:12] down and personally confirms it but in
[1:49:14] the time between him giving that and
[1:49:16] after and him coming down there's all
[1:49:18] sorts of things there's more separation
[1:49:20] there's more trials right there's
[1:49:22] infighting there's him trying to make it
[1:49:24] happen on his own there's people
[1:49:25] fighting over the land that he's been
[1:49:27] promised right you've got destruction of
[1:49:29] his family and saving to them but they
[1:49:31] still don't come in and they create an
[1:49:32] incest shoot incestuous tribe it's a
[1:49:36] mess right and then the 24th year he
[1:49:39] comes down and he says now is the time
[1:49:41] and Sarah says it's way too late it's
[1:49:43] way too late I'm dried up we haven't had
[1:49:46] pleasure together for him forever
[1:49:48] right that year she goes off and a king
[1:49:53] takes her as his bride because she's so
[1:49:56] beautiful as a 94 year old Oh
[1:49:59] [Music]
[1:50:01] 94 years old and the king is taking her
[1:50:04] over the 21 year olds Blanca shared this
[1:50:06] with me I hope it's not too much over
[1:50:08] the pulpit
[1:50:10] as women grow older the age of a man
[1:50:14] they find attractive grows with them so
[1:50:17] they always prefer a man that's younger
[1:50:18] than them but you know as they're 20
[1:50:21] they're like a 20 year old as a 30 maybe
[1:50:22] they'd like a 25 year old so you go 40
[1:50:24] they like maybe a 30 year old and that
[1:50:25] goes up as they go man 21 year olds all
[1:50:28] the way across
[1:50:29] that's what they like so you're telling
[1:50:33] me that there wasn't a change in Sarah
[1:50:35] before that promise came forth
[1:50:38] when a king has all the 21 year olds to
[1:50:41] pick from and he picks the 94 or the 9
[1:50:43] year old I guess he'd be 90 and 100
[1:50:44] right 89 years old there we go 89 years
[1:50:47] old and she's walking around the King
[1:50:48] and saying hmm hmm it's wrong it's just
[1:50:51] wrong you think but yet there was a body
[1:50:54] change in Sarah that happened as that
[1:50:56] process came forth and that's what we're
[1:50:58] looking for is what this badger skin
[1:51:00] starts to follow away more and more and
[1:51:02] more until what Christ has the full
[1:51:04] preeminence and the fullness of the
[1:51:05] promise comes forth amen
[1:51:08] so we've already said this is not of our
[1:51:12] doing this is a grace grace grace this
[1:51:14] is Christ doing it but there is
[1:51:15] something that we have to do while we're
[1:51:18] here it's got to be through his power
[1:51:19] through his anointing his direction but
[1:51:21] we have a part to play now the scripture
[1:51:23] says we are sinless perfect and spotless
[1:51:25] but did you know it's not enough to be
[1:51:27] sinless perfect and spotless
[1:51:30] what's sinless perfect and spotless all
[1:51:32] right if I erase everything off of this
[1:51:34] that sinless perfect and spotless
[1:51:38] what's the good of it
[1:51:41] that just means I stand and there's
[1:51:43] nothing to nothing to indict me but
[1:51:46] that's useless that's useless just
[1:51:49] because I have his righteousness that
[1:51:50] doesn't do me any good I'm not doing
[1:51:52] anything with it I'm just standing there
[1:51:54] and saying yeah nobody can condemn me
[1:51:57] but he didn't make you perfect and
[1:51:59] spotless and sinless so that you could
[1:52:01] stand around or so that you could sit on
[1:52:03] your hands amen it's not enough to say
[1:52:05] I'm a child of God and I have the seed
[1:52:06] of God it's not enough to say that he's
[1:52:08] my dad and I am his son he's my father
[1:52:11] and I am his daughter what he has to
[1:52:13] confirm that he to now bring you into
[1:52:15] the family business he has to take you
[1:52:17] now from a child and adopt you in that
[1:52:19] Eastern tradition of adoption where he
[1:52:21] brings you in and says now I recognize
[1:52:23] you and I'm going to bring you in to do
[1:52:25] the same thing that I did a man even
[1:52:28] Christ was perfect but he had a work to
[1:52:30] do in his perfection there was now
[1:52:32] something to do I've heard it said the
[1:52:34] Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy
[1:52:36] Spirit the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:37] we could put it that way is not the end
[1:52:39] of your work it's the start of your work
[1:52:42] because that's at the point where he can
[1:52:44] actually use you and trust you and we
[1:52:46] see that with Jesus he he takes him and
[1:52:47] he puts them in into into the Jordan
[1:52:50] River he comes down so this is my
[1:52:51] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and
[1:52:52] they takes him off and runs him into the
[1:52:54] desert drives him into the desert for
[1:52:56] forty days and nights and tempts him
[1:52:58] there to prove him and then later on he
[1:52:59] confirms him so the the the the
[1:53:01] indwelling of the Holy Spirit we could
[1:53:03] put that way is only the start of the
[1:53:05] work right it's only the start of what
[1:53:07] you have to do what God is going to do
[1:53:09] in you on this earth amen buh-bam said
[1:53:12] this in blind bottommost he said Jesus
[1:53:13] with his head back walking on the priest
[1:53:15] screaming at him making fun of him and
[1:53:17] others crying Hosanna but did you notice
[1:53:19] the whole burden of all the world rested
[1:53:21] upon him Calvary the dark hours in
[1:53:23] Gethsemane lay before him and all as he
[1:53:25] went he never noticed their scoffing you
[1:53:27] know when someone says something evil
[1:53:29] about you and you want to take it up and
[1:53:30] get angry about it that shows you aren't
[1:53:33] quite deep enough yet with God
[1:53:35] that hurts who thou burn your hide off
[1:53:40] on it
[1:53:41] how many of us can say that when
[1:53:43] somebody comes up against us we can say
[1:53:45] yeah that's no big deal because it hurts
[1:53:48] doesn't it hits our emotions hits our
[1:53:50] pride right that shows you haven't went
[1:53:54] quite deep enough yet with God big men
[1:53:56] let me say there's big women
[1:53:59] but not big women but
[1:54:03] mature fully grown adults
[1:54:07] they don't do those things that's what
[1:54:09] made him God to me he was big he didn't
[1:54:12] have to notice their little scarfing he
[1:54:14] had a purpose he had a work to do and
[1:54:17] that was to fulfill what God had sent
[1:54:19] him to do and he was determined to do it
[1:54:21] he didn't care what anyone said so that
[1:54:24] was what his work was to do and he had
[1:54:27] to give his life it's the most difficult
[1:54:29] thing to do but he says now this is what
[1:54:32] a big person will do this is what a
[1:54:34] grown person is this what a mature
[1:54:35] person will do is ignore the scoffing
[1:54:37] ignore the little hurts right as iron
[1:54:41] sharpens iron this scripture says that's
[1:54:42] what's happening as we're here amongst
[1:54:44] each other we're not here because we're
[1:54:46] all perfect we're here because we're
[1:54:48] unified in our purpose and that running
[1:54:50] together a brother and brother and
[1:54:51] sister and sister sometimes it hurts a
[1:54:53] little bit but what's he doing knocking
[1:54:54] off the rough edges God is not above
[1:54:57] using your brother or sister to knock
[1:54:58] some Christ into you in some of the
[1:54:59] world out of you amen we could all use a
[1:55:02] little bit of humbling sometimes that's
[1:55:03] for sure now Christ now in his work he
[1:55:06] defeated everything right he defeated
[1:55:08] depression he defeated oppression he
[1:55:10] defeated sickness he defeated death
[1:55:11] himself when he rose but he defeated
[1:55:13] death with with Lazarus right and then
[1:55:15] and the widow's son and named
[1:55:17] temporarily they still died but he
[1:55:19] showed he had full control over those
[1:55:20] things before he goes and even then he
[1:55:22] didn't give say Satan didn't take his
[1:55:24] life Christ said I lay it down willingly
[1:55:26] I lay it down to myself amen but we have
[1:55:30] to overcome just as he did and it's not
[1:55:32] just over because remember he's in a
[1:55:34] perfect body but we're in a carnal body
[1:55:36] so we still have to overcome those
[1:55:38] principalities and powers but now we
[1:55:39] have to overcome ourselves and the
[1:55:41] effects of those things within us as
[1:55:43] well amen we have to overcome the
[1:55:45] Laodicean influences of this church age
[1:55:47] because we've got to come out of it but
[1:55:49] to come out of it you have to overcome
[1:55:50] it
[1:55:51] you can't overcome it and stay in it but
[1:55:54] you have to overcome it to get out of it
[1:55:55] because it's got a hold on you right
[1:55:57] rich and increases Goods and have need
[1:55:59] of nothing and they said but you're
[1:56:01] spiritually destitute and we know there
[1:56:04] is an overcoming revelations 3:21 says
[1:56:06] to him that overcometh the latest CNH
[1:56:08] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[1:56:10] even as I also overcame and I'm set down
[1:56:13] with my father in his throne so she
[1:56:16] identified how does she overcome she
[1:56:18] takes the word for a day and applies it
[1:56:19] to her life that is how she does it
[1:56:22] because the the revelation 3 tells us
[1:56:24] exactly how to overcome the lady to see
[1:56:26] an age and move into that bride body
[1:56:28] amen 1 you have to answer the knock but
[1:56:32] he says here's the process he says I
[1:56:34] counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in
[1:56:37] the fire that thou mayst be rich and
[1:56:38] white raiment that thou mayst be clothed
[1:56:40] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[1:56:42] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[1:56:43] eyesalve that thou mayest see
[1:56:46] you won't see this without the ICF it's
[1:56:49] not going to happy he says and as many
[1:56:50] as I love I rebuke and chasten be
[1:56:52] zealous therefore and repent we'll talk
[1:56:54] about that last bit tomorrow Lord
[1:56:56] willing but wait wait white raiment we
[1:56:58] know speaks of the righteousness of God
[1:57:00] but Paul and 2nd Corinthians 5 also
[1:57:03] calls it our theophany that is the
[1:57:05] ultimate expression of the white raiment
[1:57:06] is what our new bodies right he says I
[1:57:09] saw speaks of revelation or spiritual
[1:57:11] understanding so he says you're going to
[1:57:13] have to have revelation
[1:57:15] but notice both of those things he says
[1:57:17] are free he tells you to buy of me gold
[1:57:19] tried in the fire and then he says I
[1:57:21] didn't get these other two things as
[1:57:22] well right white raiment and I said
[1:57:24] those are free because you can't buy
[1:57:26] them you notice the scripture doesn't
[1:57:29] say go to those that sell revelation no
[1:57:31] no revelation is only given by God and
[1:57:33] only God has the righteousness that
[1:57:36] you'll need to go in this rapture amen
[1:57:38] that is all that you can get that from
[1:57:39] as him and he has to give it freely and
[1:57:41] he does give it freely but he says you
[1:57:43] have to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:57:45] why because there is a price that must
[1:57:47] be paid for this gold and we know that
[1:57:49] that's godly character first Peter 1:7
[1:57:52] says that the trial of your faith being
[1:57:53] much more precious precious than a gold
[1:57:56] that perisheth they'll be tried with
[1:57:58] power might be found unto praise and
[1:58:00] honor and glory at the appearing of
[1:58:02] Christ Jesus at the appearing of Christ
[1:58:04] Jesus so he's Tainan now to an event
[1:58:06] this godly character is tied to an event
[1:58:08] so they remember that the the earth is
[1:58:11] burned by fire right the cleansing is
[1:58:14] always by fire so you can burn later you
[1:58:16] can burn now and what you have to be
[1:58:19] burned by what the Holy Spirit the fire
[1:58:21] of God coming in and burning out the
[1:58:23] dross of your life so that you can have
[1:58:26] this godly character and what is our
[1:58:27] battle our battle is to Express
[1:58:30] perfectly but to do it in a badger skin
[1:58:32] that is that battle with us day in and
[1:58:34] day out like Paul said yesterday there I
[1:58:36] find there a law there and when I would
[1:58:37] do good evil is with me so that's the
[1:58:40] constant battle the back and forth and
[1:58:42] the back and forth between those things
[1:58:43] and when we do that the the process of
[1:58:48] those two things the carnal battery
[1:58:50] battling with the supernatural within
[1:58:51] you the process of that developed
[1:58:53] something called character right and
[1:58:55] when they when Christ wins its godly
[1:58:58] character and with Jonathan curl up wins
[1:59:00] its idolatry because what I've done is
[1:59:02] I've placed something now ahead of
[1:59:03] Christ and that's taking preeminence in
[1:59:06] my life and now I'm worshipping
[1:59:07] something other than the word so
[1:59:09] character godly character is when the
[1:59:12] word has preeminence and that's the only
[1:59:14] way you can define it because anything
[1:59:16] else is idolatry because that's what's
[1:59:18] in influence in your life amen
[1:59:20] so what is the price of that character
[1:59:23] what do we have to pay to win this
[1:59:26] battle self will my thoughts my ideas my
[1:59:31] own survival instincts my own carnal
[1:59:34] inclinations my own comfort nobody ever
[1:59:38] willingly goes into discomfort with
[1:59:42] human nature you will not enter into
[1:59:43] discomfort unless you can see a reward
[1:59:46] that's worth it
[1:59:47] you just won't do it why do people go
[1:59:50] into the gym and sweat and workout for
[1:59:53] 30 minutes or an hour it's because
[1:59:55] there's something that they want on the
[1:59:56] other end that's worth more than the
[1:59:57] pain that they're going into but you've
[1:59:59] got to see the benefit in it to go do it
[2:00:01] and so we don't willingly choose to go
[2:00:03] into things usually to develop godly
[2:00:05] character why because we don't know what
[2:00:06] it's going to take for our life and so
[2:00:08] God has to drive us into those things
[2:00:10] and push us into those things so he can
[2:00:12] bring out using the tools that he has at
[2:00:15] his disposal him in us and that's the
[2:00:17] only way we can do it we won't willingly
[2:00:18] go into something that takes us through
[2:00:20] a godly trial look at what my sister
[2:00:23] went through recently cancer stage 4
[2:00:25] cancer how many here would say yeah I'm
[2:00:28] going to get into stage 4 cancer here so
[2:00:29] that I can develop faith
[2:00:32] nobody's going to do it we're not
[2:00:34] willingly going to step into that but we
[2:00:36] have to be willing to go through it and
[2:00:38] trust him as we go through it learn the
[2:00:40] lesson come out the way he's looking for
[2:00:42] or else he's going to just run us the
[2:00:44] fire all over again amen
[2:00:46] brother branham said this he says unless
[2:00:48] we suffer with him we cannot reign with
[2:00:50] him you have to suffer to reign the
[2:00:54] reason for that is that character simply
[2:00:56] is never made without suffering he says
[2:00:59] character is a victory not a gift and
[2:01:01] that's where you see these trust fund
[2:01:03] babies not naming any names or people
[2:01:06] that are wealthy and they give their
[2:01:07] kids everything but they don't have to
[2:01:08] work for it you will never find
[2:01:10] character in those people because
[2:01:12] there's no appreciation they didn't have
[2:01:13] to work for it they don't understand the
[2:01:14] sacrifice that's behind it and so they
[2:01:16] spend it willy-nilly right they just go
[2:01:18] and do whatever and they get into
[2:01:19] pleasures of the of the flesh rather
[2:01:22] than going and dwelling on those things
[2:01:23] that are worth they just they'll never
[2:01:25] do it it can't happen it's the Word of
[2:01:26] God so where God's not me saying that's
[2:01:28] what he's saying is you can't do that
[2:01:30] you have to go through a fire to
[2:01:31] appreciate what you have it's a victory
[2:01:34] says a man without character can't rain
[2:01:35] because power apart from character is
[2:01:37] satanic but power with character is fit
[2:01:41] to rule and since he wants us to share
[2:01:43] even his throne on the same basis that
[2:01:46] he overcame and is set down in his
[2:01:48] Father's throne then we have to overcome
[2:01:50] to sit with him
[2:01:53] scripture says he learned by the things
[2:01:55] that he suffered
[2:01:56] so then the little temporary hallelujah
[2:01:59] temporary we know there is an end to it
[2:02:01] and there's a purpose the little
[2:02:03] temporary suffering that we go through
[2:02:04] now is not worthy to be compared to the
[2:02:07] tremendous glory that will be revealed
[2:02:08] in us when he comes all what treasures
[2:02:10] are laid up for those who are willing to
[2:02:13] enter his kingdom through much
[2:02:15] tribulation I want to read that again
[2:02:18] all what treasures are laid up for those
[2:02:21] who are willing to enter his kingdom
[2:02:23] through much tribulation a
[2:02:27] man of character is a victory that means
[2:02:29] there is a battle you can't have a
[2:02:31] victory unless there's a fight that
[2:02:32] happens first amen and as we said
[2:02:34] earlier the first victory is over the
[2:02:35] inner man to where you surrender to
[2:02:37] Christ the Holy Spirit comes in after
[2:02:39] that he's working in your body he's
[2:02:41] cleaning out your life then after that
[2:02:43] he moves on he brings you now into the
[2:02:44] work of the Father amen
[2:02:47] so that character is a victory when
[2:02:49] everything about Jonathan Kurla has died
[2:02:51] and in its place Christ reigns ray not
[2:02:55] rest but rains right he's in every door
[2:02:57] in every portion of my life he's in
[2:03:00] there and there's full access and
[2:03:01] there's no hiding it from him there's no
[2:03:02] desiring to hide it from because he's in
[2:03:04] every room amen like I said the product
[2:03:07] of that battle is called character where
[2:03:09] it's my will versus his will and when
[2:03:11] his will comes in that's where godly
[2:03:13] character happens amen so every day
[2:03:16] we're going to express that and this is
[2:03:17] where the rubber starts to meet the road
[2:03:18] as you say how do I know that Christ has
[2:03:21] the preeminence in with in me well look
[2:03:23] at what you do and look at how you spend
[2:03:25] your time are you doing it for kingdom
[2:03:26] purpose or are you doing it for other
[2:03:28] purposes how are you ruling the kingdoms
[2:03:30] that are that you have in front of you
[2:03:31] right now for every man that's married
[2:03:33] now his first kingdom is his family and
[2:03:35] if you rule and reign over that properly
[2:03:37] then maybe God will add to it but he's
[2:03:39] still waiting for us to show ourselves
[2:03:40] faithful and the smaller things it's not
[2:03:42] a small thing when God gives you a wife
[2:03:44] and children that's not a small thing
[2:03:45] that is your first ministry and if you
[2:03:48] can rule and reign there as Christ would
[2:03:50] have you to in love right then after
[2:03:53] that he'll start to add to those things
[2:03:55] right what do we do at our jobs what is
[2:03:58] our confession at our jobs what is our
[2:03:59] expression of Christ at our jobs what do
[2:04:01] we do in our spare time what does our
[2:04:02] entertainment look night look like all
[2:04:05] of these things show where the
[2:04:06] preeminence is in our lives and guess
[2:04:08] what we're not out of here so no one in
[2:04:10] here is able to say I've got the
[2:04:11] preeminence everywhere nobody none of us
[2:04:15] can do it we're all subject to this
[2:04:16] battle and when the battle is over
[2:04:18] that's when we leave but until then
[2:04:19] until that day that's sticky flesh of
[2:04:22] ours that just latches onto so many
[2:04:23] things we'll be fighting it day in and
[2:04:25] day out I noticed the newest operating
[2:04:28] system for the iPhone has screen time on
[2:04:30] it does anybody know about this
[2:04:32] probably turn it off
[2:04:34] like me because it pricks your
[2:04:37] conscience when you look at it and you
[2:04:39] realize that all those bathroom breaks
[2:04:41] and
[2:04:42] all those little moments where you just
[2:04:44] want to sit down and veg imitate right
[2:04:46] they add up in a day I'll tell you it
[2:04:49] pricked my conscience the first time I
[2:04:51] looked at that realize how much time I
[2:04:52] spent on my phone I'm not a big heavy
[2:04:54] phone user in general but it still adds
[2:04:56] up and I thought to myself what would
[2:04:58] happen if I had the same preeminence
[2:05:01] towards Christ and the things of the
[2:05:03] kingdom so that instead of sitting down
[2:05:05] and saying oh maybe I can fit a little
[2:05:07] game in or maybe I'll check Facebook or
[2:05:08] maybe upload my first selfie to
[2:05:10] Instagram what if I said I can charge up
[2:05:13] with a scripture so-and-so needs prayer
[2:05:16] maybe I can just bow my head for a few
[2:05:17] minutes you know what I could really use
[2:05:19] something right now and now go on my
[2:05:21] open my Bible on my phone I've got the
[2:05:23] full message and Bible on my phone I
[2:05:24] have no excuse I have everything on that
[2:05:26] I'd ever need to want to to want to
[2:05:28] dwell on the the things that God's doing
[2:05:30] amen but I looked at that and I was
[2:05:32] shocked and how that adds up and we're
[2:05:35] trying to fit into our lives and then we
[2:05:37] look at our phones and we see we spend
[2:05:38] 17 hours on it in the last week
[2:05:40] 17 hours doing what I guarantee 95% of
[2:05:44] his absolutely useless it got you know
[2:05:47] closer to God and most chances it
[2:05:48] probably put you further away right
[2:05:51] you're always moving forward or backward
[2:05:53] and I looked at that and I didn't like
[2:05:55] it so I turned it off no it did I didn't
[2:05:57] but it's a check cuz every month it
[2:05:59] fires it up and says hey you want to see
[2:06:00] how many hours you spent on your phone
[2:06:02] it averages it it tells you the apps
[2:06:03] that you used on all these things right
[2:06:06] so what I like to do now is instead of
[2:06:08] reading the message I listen to it on
[2:06:10] the table app on my phone because that
[2:06:11] gives me credit for it on my phone right
[2:06:13] I got I got proof I listen to messages
[2:06:16] this week it's there right I can see it
[2:06:18] all in there so
[2:06:21] unfortunately that's not the record
[2:06:23] God's going to look at
[2:06:25] but it helps me sometimes amen amen
[2:06:29] amen
[2:06:32] this battle is about a land being taken
[2:06:35] because what he's got a conquer here I
[2:06:37] know that I remember when brother Allen
[2:06:39] Kader was preaching one time and he he
[2:06:41] was preaching on job and he said Satan
[2:06:43] came before God and he said Satan
[2:06:45] where've you been he said walking to and
[2:06:47] fro in the earth and brother Allen cares
[2:06:49] up he said rocking to and fro in the
[2:06:51] earth like this right your body he says
[2:06:53] what's he doing is walking through there
[2:06:55] he's stomping all over our land he's
[2:06:57] stopping all over this earthly flesh
[2:06:58] what trying to take dominion over it and
[2:07:01] this is the Dominion that we have to
[2:07:02] take this is why we're talking about
[2:07:04] when he says the preeminence this
[2:07:05] Jonathan Collette has to come under
[2:07:08] submission the land of Jonathan core let
[2:07:10] the life of Jonathan Carlat has to be
[2:07:13] defeated it has to be defeated I'm not
[2:07:17] trying to defeat Satan I'm trying to
[2:07:19] defeat Jonathan Kralik because when he's
[2:07:20] out of the way Satan doesn't have a
[2:07:21] chance but Satan's trying to link
[2:07:23] Jonathan Colette into the battle with
[2:07:25] him so we can push Christ out so they're
[2:07:28] pushing and pulling at me saying who are
[2:07:30] you gonna listen to who you gonna listen
[2:07:31] to who you're gonna obey what are you
[2:07:32] going to do with this what are you gonna
[2:07:34] do with this Christ right day in and day
[2:07:37] out and they're pulling me back and
[2:07:38] forth back and forth and what happened
[2:07:40] we have a prophet comes in this day and
[2:07:42] he has the title deed he says hey the
[2:07:44] title deeds open I'm gonna read out of
[2:07:45] the title deed to you now I'm gonna show
[2:07:48] you what's in the title deed he says I'm
[2:07:49] gonna walk through the land a little bit
[2:07:51] ahead of you just to show you and he
[2:07:53] does what he casts out Devils he defeats
[2:07:55] all these different things I mean there
[2:07:56] was nothing that came up in front of
[2:07:58] brother Branham that he didn't defeat
[2:07:59] there was nothing that God wouldn't
[2:08:01] honor his prayer for in vindicating that
[2:08:03] prophet up to an including homosexuality
[2:08:06] that's one that scares people to death
[2:08:08] today and I don't blame him because it's
[2:08:10] a pervasive spear and it's a part of the
[2:08:12] age but remember that that young man
[2:08:14] that came up and he met him I believe up
[2:08:15] in Alaska or someplace and he took him
[2:08:17] back there he prayed for him he didn't
[2:08:18] tell anybody what it was but that's what
[2:08:21] it was he told he told one or two people
[2:08:22] and they let him know what was going on
[2:08:24] there and it was that homosexual spirit
[2:08:25] cast it out of him we've got we've got
[2:08:29] brothers in this message and I'm sure
[2:08:31] there are sisters as well that have
[2:08:32] fought with that very same thing you
[2:08:34] know what that God never left there was
[2:08:36] nothing that came before him including
[2:08:37] remember that man that tried to break up
[2:08:39] the meeting and and what happened the
[2:08:42] spirit of Lord spoke up and said you're
[2:08:43] challenging me right it's not he wasn't
[2:08:46] challenging brother Brahim he was
[2:08:47] challenging Christ and he says you have
[2:08:49] to bow before me and he couldn't do
[2:08:51] anything before him right full dominion
[2:08:53] was given to him right there we'll get
[2:08:55] into that a little bit tomorrow Lord
[2:08:56] willing but there's a line that has to
[2:08:58] be conquered we have to conquer ourself
[2:08:59] and then when that's conquered now we
[2:09:01] walk into that land right in the full
[2:09:03] promises of God and moving as he would
[2:09:04] have us move in these different things
[2:09:06] but the problem is again this this this
[2:09:09] thing that annoys us so much is time
[2:09:11] because when they went into the land or
[2:09:15] before they went in God says behold the
[2:09:18] land of Canaan which I give unto the
[2:09:19] children of Israel for a possession then
[2:09:21] in Joshua says every place that the sole
[2:09:23] of foot shall tread and that which I've
[2:09:25] given you if I as I have said unto Moses
[2:09:27] right so we've got a Moses comes in our
[2:09:30] day he reads the title deed and remember
[2:09:32] in Moses day Joshua wasn't the one that
[2:09:34] said where all the tribes to go God laid
[2:09:36] that out for Moses and then Moses gives
[2:09:38] that to Joshua so he lays out all the
[2:09:40] title deed who goes where what they're
[2:09:42] gonna do what they have there you know
[2:09:43] the strengths and all the all these
[2:09:45] different things he's got it all laid
[2:09:46] out what that man looks like nice is go
[2:09:48] in and take it everywhere that the solar
[2:09:50] foot shall tread so imagine some of them
[2:09:52] said I've got my Fitbit on I'm gonna do
[2:09:54] my 10,000 steps for the day I'm just
[2:09:56] gonna walk in and by the time I'm done
[2:09:57] I'm gonna have a quarter section of land
[2:09:59] and things are gonna be good to go
[2:10:00] praise the Lord do you know how long it
[2:10:03] took them to conquer is conquer Cain
[2:10:05] until the point where they could start
[2:10:06] settling it about 10 years they figure
[2:10:08] 10 years from the time they started to
[2:10:12] the time that Joshua said alright you're
[2:10:14] on your own now ten years and do you
[2:10:17] think God told them at the beginning
[2:10:18] that there were gonna be believers that
[2:10:20] died
[2:10:21] when did the first believer die second
[2:10:24] Battal disobeyed in the first battle and
[2:10:27] went in and died in the second battle
[2:10:29] right but was it when they went into AI
[2:10:31] and a kentuc they went in when they were
[2:10:33] in Jericho he took that out right he
[2:10:35] took the Babylonian garment and the
[2:10:36] these different things and buried it
[2:10:38] what was he took something that they
[2:10:40] were supposed to destroy and tried to
[2:10:42] use it right God said you can't have it
[2:10:45] this is a pure word this is a pure
[2:10:47] people you can't do it and what he was
[2:10:48] killed and his wife and his children
[2:10:51] they all paid the price for it right
[2:10:53] what about the ones that didn't actually
[2:10:54] want to go into the land and they said
[2:10:55] no we're gonna take an inheritance back
[2:10:57] across the Jordan didn't tell him that
[2:10:59] that was going to happen did he didn't
[2:11:02] tell me there were gonna be those that
[2:11:03] got tired and quit and didn't push
[2:11:05] everyone out of their land he didn't
[2:11:07] tell him that he said it's yours go take
[2:11:09] it but that's not what it looked like
[2:11:12] for those ten years did it there was a
[2:11:13] process now of taking that land and I
[2:11:16] guarantee you when they got the end of
[2:11:18] it they were sick and tired of fighting
[2:11:19] even the first victory was so amazing
[2:11:22] Jericho didn't even have to do anything
[2:11:24] they just had to walk silently or they
[2:11:26] had to walk around and around and around
[2:11:28] around then the walls came down right
[2:11:30] like I said they got there ten thousand
[2:11:32] steps on their Fitbit every day and when
[2:11:33] they did it for seven days they did a
[2:11:35] really long walk and the walls came
[2:11:36] tumbling down can you imagine after that
[2:11:38] first victory they probably had that
[2:11:39] expectation that every wall was going to
[2:11:40] come down like that you
[2:11:42] notice early on in your walk a lot of
[2:11:44] times the victories come easy don't
[2:11:45] think because God's just what confirming
[2:11:47] to you that he's got your back
[2:11:49] but then he starts to pull back and he
[2:11:51] says look there's a work for you to do
[2:11:53] they go up the cities and they lay siege
[2:11:55] to it they'd have to starve them out
[2:11:58] it's the way we need to overcome some
[2:12:00] things in our lives to starve them out
[2:12:02] scripture talks about if your eye offend
[2:12:04] thee pluck thee pluck it out right if
[2:12:06] you've got something in your life that's
[2:12:08] causing you to have a beset in sin you
[2:12:10] need to get rid of what's allowing you
[2:12:11] access to it and sometime that's a
[2:12:13] confession sometimes that's being
[2:12:15] accountable to somebody else and
[2:12:16] sometimes it's the technology that we
[2:12:17] use isn't it sometimes it's the friends
[2:12:19] that we have right I've seen so many
[2:12:21] people and they're willing to cut off
[2:12:23] their friends and all of a sudden their
[2:12:24] walk with God starts to take off because
[2:12:26] that influence isn't there anymore right
[2:12:28] they're hanging around with the right
[2:12:29] people and all of a sudden boom things
[2:12:30] just start to flower and grow amen
[2:12:33] but it wasn't easy to take the rest of
[2:12:36] Canaan he does a miracle takes them
[2:12:40] across the Jordan without getting their
[2:12:41] feet wet knocks down the first city and
[2:12:43] then they have the first death in the
[2:12:45] second battle then after that they're
[2:12:47] fighting and they're waiting and it
[2:12:48] takes years and years and years and
[2:12:50] years and there's no rest there's no
[2:12:52] rest that's what we're facing today is
[2:12:54] we're in the long dreary fight for
[2:12:57] what's written in the title deed because
[2:13:00] we have to have a victory here before we
[2:13:03] go over there amen before we have rest
[2:13:05] we don't get our rest here our rest is
[2:13:07] in Christ here there we have rest for
[2:13:09] the three and a half years and then we
[2:13:10] come back with him we've got a work to
[2:13:12] do thousand years and then we have the
[2:13:14] full you know you're into eternity then
[2:13:15] right
[2:13:16] time is the difficulty that we face him
[2:13:19] in but what happened there was one in
[2:13:21] there there was one in there that after
[2:13:23] was all done he wasn't tired I mean that
[2:13:26] was Caleb Caleb was a type of that bride
[2:13:29] and what happened he comes up to Joshua
[2:13:30] being a type of the Holy Spirit and he
[2:13:32] says look Moses came to me and he says
[2:13:35] that mountain is for you Caleb I'll give
[2:13:37] it to you and your families he says when
[2:13:39] you come back in that one's for you
[2:13:40] we're saving that for you so now he goes
[2:13:43] up to the Holy Spirit to Joshua and he
[2:13:44] says now give me my Mountain I've helped
[2:13:48] everyone else with theirs but now is a
[2:13:49] time for me to take what you've promised
[2:13:52] me I believe there will be some of these
[2:13:54] things that we've been holding on to and
[2:13:56] we've been believing for for so long and
[2:13:58] at that end we go up and we say now is
[2:14:00] the time the time is close and now it's
[2:14:03] time for you to give me what your word
[2:14:05] is promise what your Holy Spirit is told
[2:14:06] me is mine when you promised in that
[2:14:08] prophet when he came he said this is for
[2:14:11] you amen into every one that that I'm
[2:14:13] going to call afar off and these
[2:14:14] different things right well we got today
[2:14:17] that's what happened we had a Moses come
[2:14:19] we had a prophet came they told us all
[2:14:21] about that land and we got to walk
[2:14:23] around in it a little bit and then they
[2:14:25] said no it's not for us but now we have
[2:14:27] the Holy Spirit comes and he takes us
[2:14:28] into there and what do we have to do we
[2:14:30] have to say I'm not tired well Caleb
[2:14:33] says he says it's been what 40 years he
[2:14:36] says and I'm as strong as the day that I
[2:14:38] was first here this Caleb was going back
[2:14:41] to the first place that they got the
[2:14:42] firstfruits from I said I know I spoke
[2:14:44] about this last time he went to the
[2:14:46] place where they had the biggest Giants
[2:14:47] the one that had put fear into the light
[2:14:49] into the end of the children of Israel
[2:14:51] was where he wanted that was in Hebron I
[2:14:53] believe that was where they got the
[2:14:55] grapes from but that was the biggest
[2:14:57] Giants in the land was where Caleb
[2:14:58] wanted to go he's not in fear then he
[2:15:01] says now is my time right I'm not tired
[2:15:03] out I'm still ready to go now it's time
[2:15:05] to give me my mountain amen amen
[2:15:08] the musicians can come as we start to
[2:15:12] close here I mean that's where we are
[2:15:15] now our Moses is off the scene but the
[2:15:18] Holy Spirit is still here to guide us
[2:15:21] into that place amen but what's it got
[2:15:24] to be there's got to be a preeminence in
[2:15:26] there there's got to be a willingness
[2:15:27] for us to sacrifice every thought every
[2:15:30] idea every purpose every plan you know
[2:15:34] what I ain't choosing to be behind this
[2:15:36] pulpit and you're going to be placed in
[2:15:38] situations and the call of God for what
[2:15:40] you're gonna have to do in your life and
[2:15:41] it will not be by your choice or
[2:15:43] preference I'm sorry that's not the way
[2:15:45] it's gonna be and if you're expecting it
[2:15:47] you might as well get ready because the
[2:15:48] Hammers coming right he's gonna mold you
[2:15:50] and make you into what he needs you to
[2:15:52] be but when you stand in the place that
[2:15:55] he's put you now you can speak with
[2:15:57] confidence and authority because you
[2:15:58] given him what he asked for and now the
[2:16:00] kingdom comes out from you amen amen the
[2:16:04] last Scripture Habakkuk 2 it says I will
[2:16:07] stand upon my watch and set me upon the
[2:16:09] tower
[2:16:10] and we'll watch to see what he will say
[2:16:13] unto me and when I shall answer when I
[2:16:15] am reproved and the Lord answered me and
[2:16:18] said write the vision and make it plain
[2:16:20] upon tables that he may run that readeth
[2:16:23] it not that he may sit still but that he
[2:16:27] may run what's written in the vision
[2:16:29] what's written on these tables is going
[2:16:31] to make us move it's going to put us
[2:16:33] into action him and it's gonna do some
[2:16:34] make us do something he says for the
[2:16:36] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[2:16:40] at the end it shall speak and not lie
[2:16:43] though it Terry wait for it I feel we're
[2:16:47] in a Terry situation in many ways right
[2:16:49] now we're looking and we're waiting and
[2:16:51] we're an expectation and we're making
[2:16:53] small steps but we're looking for the
[2:16:55] big one we're looking for that big step
[2:16:57] we're tearing to wait for what the
[2:16:59] fullness of what he's promised to come
[2:17:01] to pass in us amen they says wait for it
[2:17:03] why because it will surely come will not
[2:17:07] tarry he's going to hold it but there's
[2:17:09] going to be a day when he releases
[2:17:10] everything and then the doors close and
[2:17:12] we're out of here amen let's stand
[2:17:15] together
[2:17:16] Bram said this and the identified
[2:17:18] masterpiece of God he says the great
[2:17:21] sculptor is counting on you willing to
[2:17:23] stand and have yourself self shaped into
[2:17:26] the likeness of his requirement that His
[2:17:30] Word requires
[2:17:32] to have yourself shaped willing to stand
[2:17:35] willing to take it he says in the last
[2:17:37] days I'll pour out my spirit upon all
[2:17:39] flesh your sons and daughters shall
[2:17:41] prophesy he says Christ as the
[2:17:43] identified masterpiece of the Word made
[2:17:45] flesh you are asked to identify yourself
[2:17:47] in him by the same word to be the
[2:17:49] masterpiece of the bride he says now
[2:17:53] brethren God had a masterpiece then to
[2:17:55] present to the world now he wants a
[2:17:57] masterpiece today are you willing or are
[2:18:02] you ready my Christian friend are you
[2:18:05] really sure that your life is so
[2:18:07] reflecting for Christ no matter what the
[2:18:10] world says they say you lost your mind
[2:18:13] they say you've gone crazy you went and
[2:18:17] joined that bunch of holy rollers don't
[2:18:19] you pay no attention to that if you're
[2:18:21] not really truly saved and in that body
[2:18:25] and the Word of God in you and
[2:18:27] reflecting itself
[2:18:29] and the life of Christ reflecting out of
[2:18:31] you if you're not in that brother/sister
[2:18:33] don't you take that chance I don't care
[2:18:36] what you are what kind of an experience
[2:18:38] you have let that word reflect through
[2:18:41] you each day because God in this last
[2:18:44] days is taking a bride for his son Jesus
[2:18:47] Christ amen are we willing this morning
[2:18:50] to stand and let him carve and shape and
[2:18:53] beat and press and push us until we
[2:18:56] shine in a fullness of the reflection
[2:18:59] that he would have us for amen I love
[2:19:01] sitting in there listening to you
[2:19:02] worship because you know what anybody
[2:19:05] else would think you're crazy thank you
[2:19:09] join that bunch of holy rollers right
[2:19:11] but we all talked about this go to a
[2:19:14] game and they're doing way more than
[2:19:18] that they're painting themselves up
[2:19:20] there are ugly fat men that take their
[2:19:22] shirts off and paint their bodies in the
[2:19:25] colors of their favorite team and
[2:19:26] they'll stand there and be shown on
[2:19:29] television for multi millions of viewers
[2:19:31] while they're screaming and wiggling
[2:19:33] their fat bellies and were crazy for
[2:19:36] sitting in here and shouting and
[2:19:37] praising for a little bit it makes no
[2:19:39] sense it doesn't make any sense but he
[2:19:41] says what join that bunch of holy
[2:19:43] rollers I'm glad I'm with holy rollers
[2:19:45] tonight amen I'm glad I'm in a place
[2:19:47] where we have a freedom to express our
[2:19:50] thankfulness for the grace that God has
[2:19:52] given us they meant for the blood that
[2:19:53] He shed and the promise that he is going
[2:19:56] to finish that masterpiece and all we
[2:19:58] have to do and this is our part is to
[2:20:00] say like brother brother Bob close with
[2:20:02] that song at the beginning said be done
[2:20:04] to me according to that word and say
[2:20:05] well whatever your word is for me let me
[2:20:08] express it I know I can't do it all
[2:20:11] that's not what you told me but Lord let
[2:20:12] me express the peace that you have for
[2:20:14] me and let me give you the preeminence
