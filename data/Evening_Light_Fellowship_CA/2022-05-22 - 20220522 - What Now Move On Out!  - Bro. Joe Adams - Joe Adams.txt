that it's done i believe it's already done amen amen god didn't make the promise for nothing you know you know there's a purpose and and he just wants to increase our faith he wants us to trust him amen and also uh sister cordella has sent a message as well she really enjoyed the services online and she's requested prayer for her sister is 55 years old she has lung cancer she's so prairie was requested for her for her condition and also for the salvation of her soul and um she because she and she mentioned that she had already just lost a month ago lost her cousin she was 58 to cancer so we just want to remember sister cordella today and it's my privilege to announce that brother levi has asked for baptism so we're going to do that in two weeks time when sister amber's home god willing she'll be home by then and we'll have it in the same place and uh of course we'll send out a reminder uh as we get closer to that in two weeks time so be in prayer for him we thank the lord for that amen that's interesting this might have been the thing that brother joe said that god was dealing with him over over at the house you know you don't know right it's a supernatural thing isn't it amen god did wonders and he does wonders let's just sing it not in trying but entrusting hold your needs upon your heart as we approach the throne and we approach it in faith believing that god has already answered the prayer amen let's sing it it's not in trying [Music] [Music] hallelujah it's not in wandering [Music] it's not in trying but interesting [Music] praise the lord [Music] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah blessed be your neighbor amen before we pray i want to share a testimony this morning jensen came up last night he's had trouble breathing at night and if you go into his room it sounds like you've got a 747 trying to land at st john's airport and so he came up he wanted to be prayed for last night and i went in last night and all i could hear was samuel's soft breathing they both sleep in the same room you couldn't hear that jensen even had a problem ever all i could hear was samuel jensen could have been dead for all the sound that was coming from that top bed and normally it would have drowned out anything that was in there amen so we praise the lord for his healing amen just in a moment in a moment that's all it takes amen that we trust that he touches lives that he changes our bodies amen that he gives you what you have need of amen so maybe you went to bed last night and you said the symptoms are still there guess what he's still a healer amen whether it's today whether it's tomorrow whether it's next month he's still the healer amen he's still the deliverer it is not based on how we feel it is not based even on how we act amen but his word is true and he's going to fulfill what he promised he would do last night if we will do what hold on confess it and keep it before him and say lord i believe you amen so we're going to pray this this morning for these needs sister cordella asked us specifically to pray for her sister so we're going to pray for her sister what did we hear last night not even cancer amen so we're going to pray over cancer today and we're going to say lord we're trusting you to deliver the sister from cancer amen and for every other need that's here you say we had the wonderful service last night what more could we do today guess what we need more of god we need more of god every single day man we need more of our life to be put out so that his life can come in amen we need less of me and more of him in our lives we don't want to stop with last night amen we want to continue the push forward amen we want to grow in grace we want to grow in the word of god we want him to have a greater effect in our lives amen so that what we can now be a light to those that are outside amen not just to say i am i have him but i want to now go and show it to somebody else to share it with somebody else so that they can see a living christ today amen amen do you believe this morning let's bow our heads and let's pray together amen praise the lord thank you jesus lord jesus lord we come here this morning because we have a desire in our hearts to hear from you though we have a desire in our hearts to be changed though we have a desire in our hearts to be healed to be delivered lord to be drawn closer to you lord lord that jonathan colette would become less and that jesus christ would become more lord and that each one of us will be set aside so that you can have lord a greater portion a greater effect in our lives heavenly father and lord so we look for your word to have effect this morning lord not just a sermon not just a good thought or a good idea but lord we look for a living christ in our midst heavenly

in prayer father what a great honor we have before us today lord to stand before the elect of god to be able to proclaim your word and we just lord we gather together we assemble as believers father and we're looking for one thing and that's for your word to come forth fathers we feel your presence lord and in that presence there is strength in that presence there is healing in that presence lord there is power to overcome every scheme of the enemy lord in that presence and we're asking today god that you would just captivate us by your presence once again lord remember may we not be concerned about what's going to take place after service but lord keep us in your presence right now lord for the next no it looks a little wild father may we just lord just vast in your presence oh god and and just lord just receive the wonderful benefits and the blessings that there are to being a child of god and father we just look to you now god we invite you to be the guest speaker lord for these meetings and lord is this the final meeting of the weekend we just lord ask that you would come once again and lord just begin to reveal your heart to his father anoint the lips of the minister lord not the ears of the hearer father that we each and everyone can be in tune with what their spirit would have to say lord for the even like fellowship so father we just love you now we commit this service into your care it's in jesus name amen amen well it's certainly a great honor to be here with you again certainly enjoyed all the specials through the weekend i know i hadn't mentioned anything about that and i didn't wait till my wife sang to say that but i've certainly enjoyed all the specials they have definitely have just been a blessing you know you never know what you get when you come to a small church you don't know if it's bound up or if it's free if they have special singers if they don't have special singers can they sing good can they not sing good are they just making a joyful noise but i can certainly say this has been a refreshing for my wife and i to come and be here to be with you believers you know i was telling brother john i said you know you see churches kind of like our size we're a lot bigger but yet you see the same spirit here as you see there the same god here as you see there the same worship here you see there so god is moving it's not just an evil light in louisiana or some of the great well-known ministers that there are but god is right here the same god that moves there is the same god that moves here he's anointing men and women to sing the songs of zion to preach the gospel to pull on the gift of god he's the same god so we're so thankful for that and we have been we have truly been blessed and we just trust that we've been a blessing to you as well i want to this morning though i wanted to pick back up where we ended last night when we looked at the evidence that were in the land but before i do i want to read a quote as i was listening to it this morning brother bam said i was speaking on a private interview today and i met a couple a man and his son and i said you can never never go forward until you're you're perfectly satisfied until you're perfectly satisfied and you know without a shadow of a doubt you're walking in god's will then when you know that you're in god's will and walking in his way nothing can stop you amen amen notice he says now because you know where you're standing when you know where you're standing and you know that you're in god's will the devil doesn't have enough amen i don't care how long sister maureen the devil doesn't have enough when you know you're walking in god's will you know where you're standing during a devil in hell can knock you off the promise of god and he says now because you know where you're standing you know the way you're going you know what what's you got in your mind you know what the will of god is and then you can do it so i wanted to share that because this morning i want to speak to you on make your move but i was just thinking about this uh uh you know kind of maybe even giving another subtopic where do we go from here we've had a tremendous weekend hadn't we we have seen the presence of god move we've heard already a testimony of what god's done for for little jensen but he's still god for you and he's still god for your need and he's still god today and he's saying where do we go from here you got to make your move so we're going to look here in deuteronomy 1. it's going to read a portion of scripture and we'll just kind of get into the preaching of the word it says when they departed from horeb and went through all the great and terrible wilderness which they saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadesh barnea and i said unto you you are coming to the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doeth give unto us notice what moses is telling the children of israel i'm bringing you to the mountain of your enemy but not only am i bringing you to this mountain i'm telling you that god has given it to you so now whatever mountain you're facing this morning some of you that came into the prayer line last night with your mountain i want you to know god is declaring he's giving you that mountain i'm giving it to you you're coming to the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god does give unto us and behold the lord thy god has set the land before thee go up and possess it as the lord thy god of thy fathers has said unto thee and fear not neither be discouraged amen so we're just going to jump in from here and just take off you know brother jewel forney they would call him the helicopter or the parachute preacher well i'm just going to be a jet preacher and just get on started we ain't going to have time to build up we're just going to preach this morning what we find here that god has brought his children out of egypt he brought them through a wilderness and now they find themselves at a pivotal point called kadesh barnea and the prophet of god will tell us this is the holy place of desert dwelling or the holy place a desert wandering it's a holy place he would say it's the judgment seat of god he would also call it the word showdown it's a place that the children of israel had to make their decision and the prophet of god would say every service is a kadesh barnea so this morning we had had a tremendous time we have seen god move we have seen god declare to you nothing will stand before your prayer and we saw last night we brought you evidence of the lamb not even cancer will stand before your prayer but where do we go from here what is the decision we make from this weekend what are we declaring this weekend do we continue around the wilderness that we've been in and we've come and we've waited can god do it will god do it maybe god will do it i'm declaring to you today church that god has already done it all that you've got to do is make your decisions you're at the pivotal point you're at your kadish barnea are you gonna pack up and move are you gonna stay where you're at see do we follow our doubts and let our doubts keep us out of the land do we allow our doubts to keep us free from living a life of victory do we eventually die off and die out and dry up because we're holding on to something but god hasn't meet in your he's not meeting your time frame god's not required to meet your time frames as we heard last night mustard seed faith just keep holding on keep trusting god keep believing look i said last night we were going to see something supernatural something special i don't know if some of you you may have not caught it last night but we have seen god move and i believe just right over here god did something very special what's the testimony that you can't go too far but what the hand of god doesn't reach down oh you may try to be on your way out but god's declaring you can't leave because i called you for this moment i called you to come into the land i've called you in this hour i've anointed you for this position [Applause] we saw god move in a special way but where do we go from here where do we go as a church brother lust from here we're in a cadish barnea we're at a showdown do we take what we heard this weekend and press forward or do we just let it be some intellectual garbage and we just put it out because you know what god ain't meeting me on my time frame we got to trust god we got to trust god that he had visited us this weekend it's our showdown do we accept the message do we believe what was preached or do we continue to wander notice they have come out of sin they come out of unbelief they left the harsh treatments of egypt and they followed the prophet of god they followed the word to a certain point and never nowhere do we ever find moses telling the children of israel stop here they stopped on their own accord moses was ready to take them into the land because god said i've given you i brought you to the the mountain of the amorites but it sure is to possess and he told them go in and possess the land but the people refused to move forward the people refused to progress with the word they refused to follow the prophet's ministry and what did they do they wondered so we got a bigger realize where do we go from here as a church do we take this message do we embrace this message do we move forward and let the holy spirit holy ghost let him do what he wants to do and not kind of put god in our own little box the prophet god will tell us in the results of decision 1955 he says we're no longer in egypt we've done pulled up our tent stakes and left church we're not in denominational systems anymore we've pulled up our tent stakes we've left we come through the red sea the blood of the lord jesus seen all the old habits all the things of life that were drowned all the old task masters that drove us through the bar rooms into the cocktail lounge and so we seen all that drown like pharaoh and his horses and then now we're in the wilderness moving along following the angel of the covenant the holy ghost and knowing that we're on the road to a great land and he goes and that'll be here during the days of the millennium so what what are we going to do are we going to progress or we're going to stop they were in an exodus we're in another exodus they followed a prophet we're following a prophet they had a pillar of fire we had a pillar of fire they left egypt we left the world we've seen the task masters drowned they've seen them drown we've seen them drown the things that used to hinder you they don't hinder you no more but church we're at a pivotal point where the kadesh barnea nowhere did he tell you to stop nor did he encourage you to stop believing nowhere did he encourage you to stop trusting nowhere did he tell you that he told you i've given you the mountain i've given you the land rise and go possess the land so we have something to do this morning we have to make our decision and let me say it like this everyone in this building this morning your decision is not your pastor's decision it's your own personal decision you got to make your decision whether mom and dad don't want to go on with god young person you got to make your decision i'm going on with god when i gave my heart to god at 21 years old i moved over to even like tabernacle i was the only one in my family my mom and dad stayed back my brother and sister stay back but eventually one by one they began to follow one because they saw god had done something real in my life and i was no longer playing church i was no longer out in the world but i dedicated my life to god i dedicated my life to the ministry and hear what god just started to do he began to follow or have my family follow me over there to where they can receive the same promise the same word the same anointing but you got to make your decision well you got to go at it alone whether you got to leave family whether you got to leave friends i packed up and left a whole bunch of friends or what i thought was friends he had to leave that worldly influence and i'm going on with jesus got to leave that worldly influence and make your decision from this point forward i'm going on with god i'm serious he met me this weekend and i'm not staying where i've been i'm moving forward see we're in another exodus we're at a point in the journey where we got to make a decision and we find there's so much negativity right now that follows our message so much negativity is swirling around about them the prophet of god and now they find in every little fault every little mistake but 60 years ago they didn't find one so now we find it and what does it its purpose is to discourage and disillusion those that are coming back are those that have come back now they're coming to their congregations they're coming to the people coming to the masses and they're disillusioning them and they're discouraging them you know and yet we find but you got to make a choice you can go to those websites if you choose and read all the garbage you want to read or you can make a choice just to stay right here in this land why garbage your mind up with all that when you can stay right here is this the message is it still the truth does it still have power look i've seen the power we witnessed it last night he not only healed but he caught he got a little young man gave his heart to the lord last night he's going to be baptized look the devil didn't do that god is doing that we said well he's just a child no he's not just a child he's a child of god that god handpicked for that and god declared to this little church that i'm not only the god of the owner i'm the god of the young i can take them and raise them up i can protect them from the scars of this world and i can dedicate their life to almighty god god is showing ye still a god of abraham isaac and jacob he's still the god of the bride of jesus christ well the prophet of god will tell us the greatest sin that i find in the church today is unbelief that's the only sin there is there's no other sin but unbelief see the failure of the children of israel at cades barnea was due to their unbelief toward god and toward his promise now see you got a choice that lays before you you got to not only believe god but you also got to believe his promise okay god is faithful and his word cannot fail so if god is faithful and he speaks a word and we heard last night that his word cannot and will not return to him void but it will accomplish that which it was purpose and we prayed the prayer of faith over you and he said the prayer of faith shall save the sick if they committed any sins it will be forgiven them we also believe that we can lay hands on it they shall recover we can cast out all these things are in god's word so if god's word can't fail and we pronounce healing on you because the word says i'm the lord thou god that heals all thy diseases then that word can't come back and fail god can't fail god cannot cease to be god the only thing that limits god is you your unbelief and we find here the people because of their unbelief they neither believe god nor do they believe his promise and their unbelief offended god their unbelief so if their unbelief offended god what does our unbelief do thankfully we serve a god who's rich in mercy thankfully he don't just scratch us off and say you know what i'm tired of dealing with little old joe not you joe this joe got to get our jobs correct but you know what he just can't seem to get it together i'm just going to move on to joe coffey now and maybe he'll take the promises of god and go to another level see thankfully god doesn't work that way because god had planted a seed of life on the inside of every individual and no matter what god is god is duty-bound to see that seed come to life and satan is going to do everything he can to stop that seed so we find now they begin to murmur they begin to complain and notice here in deuteronomy 1 and verse 6 the lord your god spake unto us in horeb saying you have dwelt long enough in this mount aren't you tired of being where you've been aren't you just tired of camping out where you've been there's so much more of the promises of god to tap into but we find believers today what they do well you know what this is all i know oh my goodness well you know what we knew that 60 years ago it's time to move it's time to advance the word has been opened up to us it's time that we flourish in the opening of the word it's time that we become what god has intended us to become and yet we find that he says you have been here long enough even like fellowship you had been here long enough now where do we go from here see you've been around this mountain of sickness well can god do it maybe god can do it you know we saw some videos last night some pictures we seen that he did do it but can he do it for me stop going around that mountain if god can will god can i'm telling you god's able you got to turn your doubts to belief gotta like the prophet god says start doubting your doubts you know well maybe the situation is too big and maybe i can't get out of it and you've been camped out on this situation for a long time because it seems impossible god does impossible math god does the impossible and he says all things are possible to you if you can believe maybe it's some habit and you don't can't down on a habit and you seem like you can't get the victory over it's time to make your move it's time you sell out lock stock and barrel and say god i'm going to serve you hella high water i'm going to serve you no matter what i'm moving from this point i've been in the mountain long enough i've stayed here long enough i've been here as long as i want i've got all the scars i got all the memories i know what this mountain looks like from the front to the back to the side i know the top and the bottom lord it's time to move forward so it's time that we leave the mountain and it's time that we start progressing into the promised land see some of us i'm gonna say us i'm gonna include myself just so i don't point anybody out but some of us we have camped out on justification oh bless god i'm saved there's more of the promises of god amen you need to move on into sanctification some of us have camped out on sanctification and you're living a godly life but there's more to the promises than that you need to pack up and you need to move on into the power of the holy spirit and let the holy spirit capstone your life and complete change your nature and keep you so committed to god when you want to give up you can't give up because you don't belong to yourself because you've been bought with a price and now the holy spirit owns you now the holy spirit is tabernacle and now the things that you used to do you don't do anymore but as long as you're camped out on sanctification well you can pick out flaws you can pick out this because a lot of times you find people in the sanctification process they're holier than thou they're going through the refining stage and they can pick out false but oh my when you finally step into grace of the holy spirit man you begin to have love one for another because you realize you didn't deserve what you got but god did it anyway because god called you he said you've been here long enough it's time that we step on into the promises of the baptism of the holy ghost and keep moving forward with the opening of the word notice church this bride is not in her infancy anymore we're not in the embassy of the message anymore we have come to be a mature bride and it's time that this mature bride begins to take possession of everything that belongs to her his time look we're without an excuse the word has been open it's time that we find ourself like john in the book of revelations when he saw his name in the book he wasn't afraid to shout he wasn't afraid to declare who he was he said all of heaven heard i john everything in heaven everything below heard me shouting why because john saw his name there he knew there wasn't enough devils in hell to take his name off the book what am i telling you church it's time that we move forward and realize your name has been inscribed in the pages of the book the promises of god are for you you're not an infant bride anymore you're a mature bride and a mature bride has a responsibility and the prophet of god said she had a sacred trust to holiness to righteousness to the anointing and to the word of god she's got a sacred she's got a sacred vow to those things and we got to keep it but we can't do that with unbelief see god gave us a promise the land is before you all that you have to do is go go that's a simple two-letter word even you newfees know what that means go not very hard you can look it up in webster it means the same thing there as it does on google get up and move so where do we go from here brother mark notice now deuteronomy 1 verse 20 you have come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doeth give unto us notice he's given you the promise verse 21 behold the lord thy god has set the land before you go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers has said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged so god has set the promises before this is your land this belongs to you well you know what we find the same parallel in the book of acts and we look in acts 2 and 38 and peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you otherwise put your unbelief aside i've given you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall now he's declaring you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost which is the believer's promised land notice for the promise is unto you it's unto your children it's unto them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call god it's called whosoever will let them come i'll give you the land occupy the land but you got to do something to to get to the land and that's you got to move and you got to make your move the prophet of god would tell us in god using this gift he said every promise is yay and amen to the believer every promise in the book belongs to the believer how many your believer this morning so every promise this morning belongs to you i don't care how small i don't care how big i don't care how far away i want you to know today that that promise belongs to you it belongs to your children it belongs to your siblings it belongs to you this morning it belongs to you this morning whatever your need is he said ask for big things because big things is just as easy with god as small things he said it doesn't matter about our numbers you know god can meet it when in circles of 500 he can meet in circles of 50 he can mean in circles or two or three and sometimes we just kind of cast guard that two or three what does that mean well this ain't a very big church but the prophet of god said you give me two people on fire for god to do more for the church than 40 revivals so if he's there in the midst of two or three what kind of service can we have this morning we got about 30 people here this morning i say man let's have church i mean let's get behind the word of god and let's pull on let's rise up and pull up our our tent states and move into the promised land of the word of god he said christ keeps all his words he has to he has to do it i don't have to i'm mortal i'm subject to mistakes he's immortal let's go back on that real quick i just caught something inspiration just hit notice the problem of god says i'm mortal subject to mistakes well we thought he was perfect well i then think a prophet made mistakes under the anointing he doesn't but outside of that anointing he's just a regular man like you and i man but notice he says christ because that's the one we're focusing on and i love about our prophetess because he never pointed to himself he never pointed to his ministry he pointed us to christ always pointed this bride to christ his purpose his mission his vision his his his commission was to call out a bride for the bridegroom notice christ keeps all his words he has to he has to do it ah oh my i don't have to but you're a prophet but i'm mortal but you're a prophet i'm subject to mistakes but you're a prophet see he's immortal infallible he has to keep his but i don't have to keep mine and you don't have to keep yours so it's okay for us not to keep our end of the bargain but yet we exalt the prophet up here the prophet said don't look to me look to the christ look to the look to the anointing look to him he goes you don't have to keep your yours but he does oh doesn't that just place something in you to know that he he's absolutely bound to that word not a prophet not a preacher not a pastor not an evangelist not a deacon not a mom not a dad but god is bound to that word noticing what did he say and i've gone over this several times because sometimes i'm very repetitive i'm not a teacher but i'm just a full-on evangelist and sometimes you learn things by repetition i was taught by that by a good teacher my pastor he does a lot of repeating at times and eventually you get it it sticks what we find here christ in ephesians 5 20 he said he his purpose he was going to present to himself a glorious church not some failed church not some dismantled church not some bruised up church who's just been manhandling beat up and tossed about don't know where she's going don't know where she come from but no he's going to present to himself a glorious church not having a spot not having a wrinkle or any such thing but that should be holy without blemish so god's got an image of his bride and she's not going to have a blemish oh you may have woke up this morning for some of you that have full-length mirrors and you looking at me like oh my god oh man all you saw was blemishes you see wrinkles i don't know don't say amen to that some of you've probably seen i look in the sink i'm like oh my goodness my hair is falling out but we find we don't see what we see here because we're seeing through the eyes of humanity but see he's not looking through the eyes of humanity he's looking through the eyes of his promise he says i'm gonna have a glorious church and lotus the prophet of god tapped into the vision of what god saw when you look into the invisible union of the bride of christ he says you are the pure the virtuous the sinless bride of the son of the living god every man and woman that's born of the spirit and washed in the blood of jesus christ and believes every word of god stands as though you never sinned in the first place so he's declaring in his word in ephesians 5 27 this is what my bride is gonna be and then he sends down a seventh angel a seventh messenger a prophet and he taps into the mind of god and he declares this is what you are you know sometimes we can see without blemish but oh man to have god put it in color and he tells you you are the pure you are the virtuous you are the sinless bride of the son of the living god he says you're standing completely you never sin at the first place god don't even know oh man that should make you shout man that should make you shout knowing that you you're living in failed humanity you're living in a body that's not been redeemed yet you're living in a body that's still failing you you're living in a body that's not been converted yet but god is telling you never sin in the first place god don't even know it it's in the sea of forgiveness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of god and you're standing there was that's how you're there today church you're not some dirty somebody you're not just some fly-by-night member of a church no but you're the wise you're the virtuous you're the pure you're the sinless bride of the lord jesus christ he says you're the virtuous bride of christ washed in the blood of christ precious virtuous sinless son of god standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed us by the water of his own blood that become flesh and manifested that notice that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the before the beginning the same as he was oh i love this you know what a promise to the believer you're not getting this in the denominational system you're not getting this wandering around the desert you're not getting this in egypt no this is promised land manna prophet of god went on the other side and he's come back and told you this is who you are this is what the word declares that you are satan declares you're a sinner satan says you're a castaway satan says you might as well give up satan says nobody cares about you but here christ is coming through a prophet saying you are the pure sinless you've never done it in the first place where's the first place in the back part of god's mind you were a thought god thought of you when when god thought about what he was going to do and how he was going to do it he knew you'd be sitting right here this morning he knew you'd have a prayer line last night he knew there'd be a breakthrough for the church last night he knew that nothing would stand before the sinner's prayer or the believer's prayer not even cancer and he knew right here this morning what topic to bring it's time that we make our move and rise up from the mountain that we've been kept out around and take our steps into the land of the promise see god never seen you as a sinner he saw you as a son and daughter of god amen now you're standing as a pure unadulterated bride word that he was not washed by man man didn't talk you into it and man can't talk you out of it man never won me to christ i had a voice come to me in a car driving 120 miles an hour down the road trying to take my life it wasn't a man i didn't go speak to a man about my condition god dealt with me now you may not have that supernatural experience but nevertheless god can speak to you in a service just like he did for many of you last night but notice kadesh barnea where the children of israel made their mistake the prophet of god will tell us but we're going to look back here and deuteronomy they turned and they went up into the mountain and they came into the valley of esco and they searched it out and they took the fruit of the land you know it's one thing to tell somebody about it try to paint them a picture try to be very i'm not a very detailed person i'm like get me to the back of the book give me the punchline let's be done with this i don't need all this frivolous stuff in the middle but some people love all that frivolous they want all the little intricate details i'm like man i ain't got time for that i'm gonna go get her let's go and get get me to the back of the book i'll find out give me the cliff notes i'm good how i made it through college is still a mystery but we find here they came and they had the fruit of the land in their hands they brought back some water brother lush from the promised land now i can talk to you about this world i can tell man that water tastes so good and just keep the water you never see it man that water was so crystal clear it was so cold it was you just had to be there but you never see it but when i come and present you the water and you can see the water and you can taste the water and i'm telling you look this is what's in the land i can talk to you about cancer i can talk to you about alopecia i can talk to you about a little boy who never walked in the spirit of god swept into the room and he got up and he hasn't stopped walking since he hadn't he just ran his first 5k race back around easter time or something like that what am i telling i'm talking to you about the fruits of the land he said they brought it down unto us and they brought us word again and said it is a good notice their confession it's a good land which the lord our god doeth give us but in verse 26 notwithstanding you will not go where do we go from here i told you about the evidence but where did we go from here notwithstanding you would not go but you rebelled you rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and the prophet of god said israel made his mistake when it stopped amen it made its mistake when it stopped when they went over there and they stopped marching they started wandering church don't ever stop ministers in this church today don't you ever stop preaching this pure gospel you preach with everything in your heart you preach until your mind is numb and you don't know anything else but you know this word and you know it's true and you know it's faithful and you may spit it out over and over and it may be the same thing but you keep preaching it you keep preaching it you keep proclaiming it you keep proclaiming don't ever back off of the promises of god because the promises of god are yea and amen to every believer see when you stop marching when you stop moving forward in the present truth in the word of the hour you start wandering you begin to find every reason not to go forward you begin to open up your mental capacities to doubts into reasons and you begin to find faults you begin to complain well so-and-so did this well so-and-so did that so-and-so said this so-and-so said that now i would say this this church is not the promised land you're going to get hurt there's going to be wounds not intentional wounds but we've got to be willing to move forward and not let those wounds keep us wandering and circling and wandering and circling notice you find people all they want to do is they want to complain about this when they want to complain about that when you think man how's that it's never you you ever wonder that maybe that's just me i'm thinking man you pick out this problem on this person you find fault in this person you find fault in this preacher you find fault in this deacon you don't like this sister you don't like correct singing i mean there's everybody's at fault when did god die make you god but see the problem is that that person had stopped short of the promise and they started wandering and then they started complaining then they started murmuring and see they're not looking at the promised land they're just going around the mouth and picking out everything that they can pick out and we find when you when you stop moving forward you start wondering is this right is that right is the cloud right did that really happen was it really a rocket was it not a rocket how many fell off the bridge was it how are they trying to describe it did it really happen we can't find articles here do we really care come on let me tell you i'm not worried about the cloud i'm not worried about the bridge all i do is when i get to the end of a tape and i see a prayer line and i see him begin to call your name out here so and so you're from such and such this is your problem what i realized right then i'm not worried about the cloud you can take a picture all day long of any cloud you want but i'm declaring right there there's a prophet ministry there's christ coming down in this day there's god discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and not only that pronouncing healing pronouncing deliverance pronouncing the gift of god over their life that's what i'm looking at but if you're if you stop short of the promised land you begin to wonder well he said it this way here and he said it this way there certainly he can't be right i mean come on how many are over 40 oh god i show our hands how do you how many of you remember everything exactly the same that it took place 20 years ago are you for real gotcha so we made brother mark blush last night we make you bless today but you don't remember things exactly saying why because we're human and this brain of ours is an organ that begins to decay over time it's not lively it's not vibrant when you get past 40 good lord things start checking out and you're backing up like no we're moving forward brain but we find these things and yet they want to find every little fault you begin to wonder i mean really is he a prophet or did he make mistakes as a man he made mistakes but underneath that anointing he was a prophet he never failed it never missed under the anointing when dust said the lord followed whatever was said you can count on it and that's what we have to differentiate and we have to learn that we don't want to exalt a man to a level because a man's gonna fail he says i make mistakes but we find here if you're kept short of the promised land you begin to wonder well even is the holy ghost for me can i even be healed have i gone too far have my kids gone too far have they straight is there enough time left see the promise is unto you to your children even to those that are so far out there they don't even know they want god what a promise what a promise look let me tell you how do you know that brother because i was one that wasn't looking for god i didn't know i needed god but there was a promise given to me it was a promise given to my grandmother who was a believer and she no doubt prayed for her grandchildren and one day in the most inopportune time at the most inopportune place at the wrong speed obviously and yet the voice of god came in my car and said turn your car around i wasn't looking for god but the promise of god held true the holy ghost is for you it's for your children it's for those that are far off even those that ain't looking for god it's for them today don't give up on your loved one don't give up on your children don't give up on your family don't give up on your friend we got a promise of god we can take it church we can take it so they came to the land whither thou sent us us and they said surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it notice nevertheless they're looking at the problems nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anec there the malachites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites they dwell in the mountains and the canaanites throw down by the sea and by the coast of jordan so notice 10 spies out of 12 tasted the very same thing that caleb and joshua did let us put like this they sat in the same surface felt the same anointing seeing the same outpouring seeing a little boy give his heart to the lord seeing jensen receive healing just like that seen a girl dedicate our life back to god like that they seemed they witnessed it they saw the pictures same way you saw him last night and yet they brought back a completely different report how can 12 people look at the same thing and come 10 of them see something different how can 12 people look at the same thing and 10 of them see something different see these spies walked through the land they were 40 days in the promised land man they were feasting on grapes they feasted on all that the land had i'm sure it's probably unimaginable what that land provided as far as production of fruit and and everything else they had all the land at their fingertips they walked through it they spotted they saw the mountains they saw how glorious it was they saw the cliffs they saw that oh yeah they saw a couple giants you know but caleb and joshua saw the same mountains saw the same giants took her the same fruit and yet they said the land is a land of milk and honey you know what milk and honey represents it means fertility of the soil it's productive and prosperous otherwise it's a rich land that's full of natural resources now they left the bering lands of egypt and they're coming into a land that god had given them a land that was rich with natural resources where cultivated you can cultivate produce and things of that nature the oriental will use this term milk and honey and they would say it's to drink in the food of gods so what was god doing god was leading more gods into the promised land a land that was only fit for other gods what has god done in this day he's given you spiritual food in due season not everybody's partaking of this man this milk in this honey it's only for the elect but if we stop short of it you never reach the promised land notice they ate they explored the beauty of the glory of the land but when it came time to tell others about the land they gave a negative report see it's okay for them to experience a revival it's okay for them to shout in church it's okay for them to enjoy the presence of the lord but not the people not the congregation and we find the same thing today is happening in the ranks of the message i'm going to be very very blunt here but at the same time we find today there's churches that don't no longer want prayer lines in their church because they refuse to fight the giants in the lives of the people too much work too much effort but god said it's yours what were we doing last night we were fighting giants oh it made it look simple but it was a giant in the life of that individual and god said we could have it and i refuse i'm a caleb i refuse to back off the promise of god god you give me my mountain i'm here to fight i'm here to put my shoulder to the wheel with that brother that sister of the ministry here and we're going to fight for the promises of god notice we have men today they've tasted of the land they've seen the milk and honey flow but they don't want their congregation their congregation to partake of it no there are no there's some today that no longer want altar calls i know altar calls prolonged service doesn't it well shame on you your carnal carnal-minded thing amen and yet that individual has come up in a walled city in their mind and they come up to the altar and they're looking to be free and god said i've given you the land you can pull down the walls that are surrounding that city and bring that individual to freedom but we find they don't want it was good for them when they were a kid or when they were a young a center out in the world and they needed an altar experience but now it's not any good for the members of the church see it's okay for them they tasted of it the prophet of god will tell us now every generation has its own revival it gets its chance at the word so who were we to keep this generation from their chance who are we as men of god as churches leadership or who are we to refuse this generation their opportunity at the word and we find the people be too strong in the land and they bring a negative report you know and it's just like satan that's what he loves he loves to put a negative report or let me say it like this he loves to plant scarecrows in front of the promise scarecrow how many have ever seen a scarecrow y'all have those here in newfoundland probably not no not really well you probably see it in facebook somewhere but a scarecrow is a straw bean don't have a face just got clothes on look they got it y'all know what it is okay do y'all want me to google it real quick and show you a picture no i appreciate it but brother brown says now the devil's nothing but a scarecrow just scares you into something he said he has no legal rights at all he was stripped of every right principalities spoiled of everything that he did at calvary there was he begins to tell this story he says there was a man that lived down there and he really loved birds and he had a wild strawberry patch and he wouldn't let nobody bother he kept it there for the birds and he went to florida one year and he didn't get back in time and some fella he wanted to pick those berries so he put a big old scarecrow out in the field to keep the birds away and that's what satan has done oh he he's got a beautiful field here for us full of promises and he hasn't come back in time so satan has camped out and put a scarecrow in the field to keep you from the promises he says he says now he said well i thought he goes well i thought that was amazing because i thought that was amazing remember let me back up excuse me and these birds making their habit of coming there every year they came to service every sunday every wednesday every special meeting they come and they found this patch and there was a scarecrow in it and some of them birds were sitting up in the trees some were sitting on the tele to telegraph wires some on the poles and they were just squawking and carrying on about it what is that scarecrow doing down there i can't overcome i can't this you know how it is right satan plants a scarecrow in your life fear grips you and some reason now your your faith just turned to doubt he says well i thought that was amazing look at that but to my amazement right in the middle of the patch sitting right on the arm of that scare ro or scarecrow said two great big crows just eating their bully their belly full just as hard as they could two scare two crows all the other crows are sitting back on the wires squawking about it we can't do this we can't do that and we don't believe in miracles anymore the days of miracles is passing we can't have emotion in the church anymore we can't let the holy ghost there's no such thing as speaking in tongues anymore that went away when the problem went off because now we're no longer pentecost now we got to move away we got the word word word word word and they realize there's a scarecrow in the patch but god has put promises behind that scrap crop and there's two crows sitting on the right arm and on the left arm and they're feeding on the word of god they're feeding on him and he will say there's no condemnation to them that are feasting on the strawberries and i'm going to tell you tonight church there's no condemnation to those who are walking in victory there's no condemnation to those who have decided i'm making my move to the promised land there's no condemnation that those that are feeling their spiritual appetite by the promised word of god there's no condemnation tonight those that are feasting on heavenly manner there's no condemnation for you tonight just move past the scarecrows in your life god's promised you the land there's no life in that scarecrow satan is nothing but a bluff he's been defeated he's been stripped of every power and authority yes sir let people say what they want to say but what god what does god say about it let them say what they want to say but what does god say about it so this when they came to the border land academy barnea oh my i've been gone an hour when they got to the land and they looked over into the promised land notice he's talking about caleb and joshua or he's talking about the ten spies here they looked into the land they saw the videos they saw the proof of it and they said we can't take it he goes what was the other ten they looked at the circumstances the prestige of what they would lose and they said we are grasshoppers on the side of the others but we have been taught by the message that we have brought out even this past weekend that we're not to look at circumstances we're not to look at anything to distract us from the promise and we are to look at this word in this word only we are taught to believe all the promises of god are yea and amen to the believer so many believers continue today to look at the giants him wondering why their homes are in trouble oh they sit on the pew but their homes are in shambles because they're not looking at the promise they're looking at the problems instead of having an altar call and a prayer meeting in their house and a time of devotion they just let willy-nilly anything come in and anything go and they wonder why their house is in chaos because you got to keep the word before us because it's the promise you got to keep the word pulled you got to keep in tune you don't let things come in your home that shouldn't be in your home and i understand you may get a black eye from it because some people may not be where you are in your your process with your kids i mean my wife and i we have four kids and i think they probably would say we're probably the most rigid ones out of the entire church we don't feel that way but hey i'm glad that's what you think because i know when your kids come to my house their cell phones ain't going in the bedrooms their cell phones are coming on the bar they're gonna be left there at night there ain't gonna be no secret surfing on the internet at my house there ain't gonna be little things slipped in little movies that shouldn't be slipping in here and little things here because we're in tune with it because why i got a responsibility i'm taking my kids to the promised land i'm not throwing them out there to the gators notice but they lacked faith these ten spies lacked faith and their doubt had turned to unbelief and their unbelief turned to rebellion against god notice instead of saying notice how the word would say in numbers 13 and verse 27 they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentenced us verses saying we have come to the land which the lord giveth us sinneth versus giveth so that perception was wrong about the promise and when your perception gets turned around and it's not well god's sending you here and this this message is a bunch of do's and don'ts a bunch of regulations but it becomes man it's my message it's my promise this is for me it's no longer i got to do this and i got through that because your perception has changed and that was the thing with caleb and joshua they didn't have the perception of well god's sending us here no this is my lane god's giving it to me guys give me that mountain god give me that patch of ground god's giving me that there god give me that city i'm gonna change that city to the city of joe start picking out your city that's right start picking out your mountain start claiming it for your own look 40 years later they didn't get to enter into the land but caleb never forgot his mountain kayla kept his mind on his mountain and you may have gone around and around and it seems like time has given up on you and this has given up on you but i want you to know god is raising up another crop and caleb was still alive and caleb said joshua hey you remember moses told me when i went in there i picked out my mountain i want my mountain give me my mountain how won't my kid say i want my kids built with the holy ghost i don't care if it took 40 years 50 years give me my mouth and give me my promise it belongs to me he never took his eyes off the promise no longer no matter how long he had to dwell in the wilderness oh sons of god i'm telling you this morning keep your eyes on the promise where do we go from here it's time that we pack up and we move into the promised land of the word of god they saw giants caleb saw victory they saw walled cities caleb saw a dwelling place oh what are you looking for they tasted other grapes caleb's like i'm gonna make me a salad i'm gonna put all this together this is gonna be great see they looked at the obstacles they didn't look at the promise of god they looked at the hindrances they looked at the sickness in their body they looked at the disappointments that life was brought on they looked at the hurts and the scars from somebody at church but they never looked at the promise oh church i'm trying to get your eyes off the problems get your eyes off the circumstance get your eyes on the promise and notice when they came back and gave their report amen their crowd of unbelief had such an influence to the congregation these men were hand picked by moses each and every one of them were hand-picked they were rulers in their tribe otherwise we're going to put it in layman's terms they were preachers and some of them were well-known preachers some of them were not so well known you never heard about caleb until this story he knew about joshua joshua had a good ministry he was right there with moses so you heard about joshua but you never heard nothing about caleb you may have heard about some of the other ones but they had not only did they some of them were well known some were not but they had an influence in their tribe and when they came back and gave the negative report what did it do it influenced the congregation i guess this is not for me i guess we can't have miracles i guess we can't have the emotion i guess we just got to stay with the word we got moses moses moses moses moses moses we got the ten commandments commandments commandments we got them we got them we got them we got them we done printed them we didn't did this we didn't google them we didn't copy them we got them every family's got the ten commandments but god was wanting to be personal god was wanting to take them into the promise of the word god was going to take them beyond the ten commandments and he was gonna manifest himself as a living god i've given you this land so that i can reproduce myself and they saw every reason not to go and again the people of their trials began to pull back and notice they settled to live on the outskirts of the promise and never to obtain never to occupy and never to enjoy the land what a sad place to be and you find many churches today are at this point they don't want any emotion in the church they don't want you shouting they don't want those acts 238 screaming youngins it'll certainly put her out of her denomination but the prophet god said it's the only kind the word can't produce it's the only kind the word is gonna bring forth is another book of acts church not an azusa book of acts but a holy ghost upper room indwelling the power of god when people can hear you in your own language when you walk out stumbling you may not be drunk because it's only the the third hour of the day but i'm gonna tell your brother says you've been in the presence of the angel of the lord so we're not a people to pull back from the promise but we need to move forward see what we find unbelief says look at the obstacles unbelief says look how long you've prayed no results yet unbelief says look at the challenges unbelief says we're not able but faith sees the opportunities faith says i can do all things through christ who strengthens me faith says it's time that we possess the lamb faith says make your move faith is here today say now is the time today is a day this is a service for some of you to make your move and quit wandering around quit beating that dead horse quit expecting to get different results when you're doing the same thing that's the very form of insanity look we're not insane people if there was any sane people in this world it's the people of god and god has commissioned us god is telling you i got a land for you to go to i got a promise for you to take and you need to rise up today this is your hour let the faith of the lord come into your heart this morning and you make your step to the promised land oh it's time we make our steps don't be afraid to go look the testing time come probably says and they were afraid to go he goes i think brethren today that's what's the matter with the churches at the end of the great doctors in theology and goes and i think it's a testing time for the church and you see people we our church and i just can speak for experience but there's a lot of liberty in our church thankfully we have it but it hasn't always been there it's it's graduated to this place where it's at today we've moved and we have grown and we have matured like every other church but we find people start to stream in and they begin to see oh that one jumped out of their seat and they ran around and they began to see the the the movement of the motion and the the emotion of the holy spirit moving in the church we have tongues in our church not every service but it happens we have interpretation of tongues in our church we have the gift of prophecy that will go forth in our church and many people view in and they criticize what's going on so what they're done they have looked over the border and they're complaining about what's in the promised land they're complaining about the liberty that they have in the promised land [Music] see the land the land god wants you to go but they were afraid to go and many messes believers are afraid to let go well what are they going to think i don't care what does he think what does he think you know i understand we're human right and everybody's a robot this morning and sometimes how many you've ever felt something just come over and you just want to do you want to run but you ain't going to run very far in here you'll be out in the middle of the street or you're bouncing on the wall but you just you wanted just something that comes over and you just like oh my well we seen brother paul you better be ready when he goes to shout out hallelujah it'll make a chill run up your body down your body out the door into the house you better know where you're standing or they're sitting for that matter because you if you're standing you may be sitting but it just something comes over you and you just want to yield to it but yet you just refrain it and that's what's the problem we have to learn to let go and allow the holy spirit to move now not every service is going to be a carbon copy of what we saw last night not every server is going to be a jumping emotional and everybody's in an euphoric condition no but god don't don't don't don't hinder god from moving the way that he wants to and we find they want to criticize our worship they want to criticize our young people because they're free they want to say they need church order we need church order and even like i got the meanest preacher in the message as a pastor and they're going to tell me we need church orders and he's amen and now yeah he knows i mean brother tim has no no spring chicken he's been around the block and he's a tough old bird i mean the man but he preaches the gospel flat and true and he's not gonna let any funny business happen in his church and yet you find people well brother tim you need to repent you've done this and you've done you've allowed this you know what you need to get out of order so you can get saved that's the problem they stopped marching on they stopped feeding on what the prophet of god said and they maybe capped down on a couple quotes i mean they took the nugget book and that's all they had and the nugget book was only because somebody was looking at a topic the way he wanted to look at it and they didn't search it all the way through the message oh don't stop at the nugget book don't start at these little little camps that we got today you need to take it all the way through the message what did he say from 47 all the way to 65 and give the prophet an opportunity to progress in his revelation as well because the revelation he had in 65 wasn't the same revelation that he had in 47 because he was visited by an angel of god and that angel began to express the word and begin to share and tell them you were wrong here and you were wrong there and this need to be here and this need to be and he he grew in his revelation just like we grow in our revelation but i will say this he was a prophet the entire way through so notice the unbelief of the preachers went into the land hindered the congregation from going and taking their promise now you will say oh it's impossible see they were looking at the circumstances caleb and joshua was looking at the word of god and that's what made the difference and that's why i've been preaching faith to you just look to the word look to the word don't look to your brother don't look to your sister look to the word of god he will be an absolute he will be a present help in a time of trouble see don't look at the circumstances don't look at the time don't put time refraints on god he says brother baby says that if you'll look at the circumstances around you you'll faint we know the story peter got off the boat he said lord if that be you bid me to come peter stepped out on faith but soon as he started looking around at all the ways everything around him he immediately sunk but the word of god says jesus was so close he immediately reached out and picked him right up that's how close he is to you so don't let your unbelief shadow the presence of god you're right there we're at the verge of going into the promised land church notice the problem god will tell us is he said talking about a borderline believer he said then he will be brought right up to the borderline set right in the meetings watch the working of the holy spirit see others get healed hear them speak with tongues see sign signs and wonders done they'll sit right around and watch it but afraid to put their hand on it that's the borderline believer that fella if he ever turns away there's no more remission for him stand right up there and even look at the lamb who's received the knowledge of the truth and had a knowledge of the truth know that it was right but because of prestige well if i do this it'll do this if i accept that it'll do this see they refuse it and they walk from it he said that's a borderline believer i'm not preaching to borderline believers i'm preaching the genuine sons and daughters of god this morning he said a real born-again believer how that real born-again church is moving on into the promised land the promise of the eternal life a land flowing with eternal life there he goes where there is no more sickness no more death sorrow nothing has to harm them he said but when carnal minds began to come among them notice intellectual minds carnal minds began to come among them it finally drove them off the main path into the desert amen and they wandered and they wondered we can't have miracles anymore that's just carnal we don't want that we got the word we don't believe in speaking in tongues anymore we got the word because when that which is in part is done away and that which is in whole no i want the part i want the hole i want all of it i'm not throwing out the part because now i got the hole because the part is included in the hole give me it all to me speaking in tongues is in the part well it's part of the hole as well the emotion is in part it's part of the whole as well give it all to me i'm not throwing out the part because now we got the whole i want it all but we found carnal minds they began to come among us and it drove them to the desert and they made their final mistake when they failed to go on they were on their journey and the prophet of god would say not very many miles they could have made it in a few days with all the 2 million people out there in the desert if they could have just stayed on the path in one place the prophet of god told us they were three days away from the promised land look how close if they were three days away how close are we today the world has never been in the condition that it's in right now we see it all we hear you hear rumors of nuclear war nuclear war nuclear war russia getting ready russia getting ready threatening and threatening and threatening and threatening you hear different feeling of different ones wanting to join nato for protection and russia's putting an ultimatum on them because you know you don't you do this we're going to go to war with you trying to flex your muscle and the problem of god warned us watch russia but more importantly don't put your eyes on that put your eyes on the promise because if that's taking place out there what's taking place in the body how close are we from entering into the land he says when they got there they camped and god had been good to them showed them many great wonders and signs down in egypt on their journey and have prepared everything for them but they still had to come to the place which was almost in sight of the promised land and just a little while after that they had left he said but they get camped church don't camp down you know we've we've seen men around this message camp down on thunders and they never progress with the opening of the word that's all that they know is their thunders you got perugia you got two souls you got no souls you got all kind of things you got all kind of doctrines what is that that is camps god never intended for us to camp down he never intended for us to put a period at the end of our experience no you never saw a prophet camp down on these ideas so who were we to come behind a prophet and start setting up camps no the prophet was leading us into the promised land amen and it's time we go it's time we pack up and it's time we go let me start trying to wrap this up because i got about another 50 pages here y'all don't have enough time and i don't preach this is my third service i'm wearing down but the prophet of god said you'd have to you'd have to fight for every inch of ground you got to fight mom dad daughter brother sister you got to fight for your own ground amen he said foot footprints means possession let's move in tonight amen let's go in footprints is possession let's take every inch of ground that god give us if you haven't got the baptism of the holy ghost peter said the promise is unto you unto your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call footprints is possession let's go get it it's ours jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever let's possess that the works that i do shall you do also well that's another topic that we can look at for just a brief minute everybody wants to put it on a prophet you can't have prophecy anymore because that was only for a prophet you can't pray for the sick because that was only for a prophet no god established a five-fold ministry and then there there's prophets there's teachers there's evangelists there's missionaries there's preachers so the gift of prophecy never ceased because a prophet went off the scene there will never be another major prophet that's right but there are gifts of prophecy your young men shall do what they will have prophecies and your old men will do what they will dream dreams so we see it's still among the body amen if the body's marching onto the promised land amen snow does now joshua had to fight for every inch of ground from one end of the country to the other but he had a promise you got the same promise they were giants in the land joshua didn't know how he was going to take the land caleb didn't know how he was going to take the mountain brother said i don't know how a black cow can eat green grass and produce white milk but i drink it anyway he goes i don't try to find out the formula to divine healing i just know god said it and it brings the results because it's fruit of the promised land it's your possession move into it tonight or today rather notice they made their mistake when they camped down and what did they do they begin to murmur they begin to complain brother mark they begin to pick out faults and flaws well you know brother brother i ain't gonna save brother lush but you know this brother and that brother man he preaches for four hours and i think he said the same thing every 30 minutes he just puts himself on replay and he just keeps repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating four hours what can he say in four hours i mean four hours man you could have got that done a long time ago and they find every reason to pick apart the ministry they don't do it in the congress they do it around the supper table they begin to complain they begin to murmur they begin to find fault with this one and find fault with that one they're probably saying right now i wish brother joe would hurry up because we're getting hungry i wish he'd come on we didn't heard about this problem he wants to talk about repeat he didn't put himself on replay several times already but we find how do they do it they murmur and it influenced their family and then that family influenced another family and that family influenced another family and then another family and then to find the entire tribe was influenced with negativity and said we can't go and then you wonder why your kids don't want to serve the lord because the murmur is being done around the dinner table when they get of age and they have no desire to serve god because you have killed that man's influence the prophet of god said there's more ways to kill a man there's more ways to besides just stick a knife in his back you start talking about him and you kill his influence you kill his ability to have an impact on your children's life when they come to the age of accountability and they need to have confidence in a man and they no longer have condoms because why because you destroyed the man in front of them you destroyed the church you destroyed the message and wonder why they want to wash their hands of it they begin to murmur why do we need to go into that land it's just like every other land right and they wander and they wander and they wander and they wander and the prophet of god say carnality had cut off their spiritual supply and they wander and to wander he says we've been around this mountain 40 years we've been here long enough church he says we've been here long enough he says we stayed on this mountain 40 years we stayed in our denomination 40 years fussing the way that we have do you think what he says do you even think or do you ever think what them people done out there for 40 years i couldn't imagine being around those people and all that negativity for 40 years oh my goodness i mean there was only caleb and joshua had a positive testimony and maybe their families and their tribes but we find here he goes well he said sure god was with him he's been with us they've been out there for 40 years they raised children they had prospered them they had good crops they'd done a lot of good out there god had blessed them and healed them healed them of their sickness they weren't the feeble one among them and they when they come out of the wilderness but he let them stay right there to the old bunch of fighters left and died out that's right why are we still here some of these old fighters if you've heard are starting to die off some of those have camped down and refused to go on with the word starting to die off and the prophet of god would tell us he says oh you bunch of old fighters a bunch of fighters god just let you sit right there till you die that's exactly the bible said they stayed there to the old fighters died out that's exactly right he let them stay right there till the old fighters died out those fighters they were fighting and fussing over organizational boundaries and you don't have fellowship with this group and that group oh my goodness where are we at today you can't go to this church you can't be a partaker of that meeting there because that meeting they don't believe like we believe and they're perusal we're thunder so we can't intermingle we can't mix we're all messes believers church and we find here these old fighters have these organizational boundaries and they won't let you do this they won't let their congregate congregation go there but at the end of the 40 years the old fighters begin to die off and the problem of god sent a new generation a new generation from those old fighters will begin to rise up and they don't want to fight anymore no they got one motion they got one purpose they got one desire and that's to go into the land we have heard about it for 40 years we have seen the pastors going around that mountain fighting about this state and fighting about this doctrine and fighting about this idea we don't want to fight anymore we want to possess the promised land we're going to take our kids and take our families and take our churches into the blessings of the holy spirit and move into a rapture of the church [Music] a new group the prophet of god would tell us he said in the beginning he goes ah i'm beginning to get old excuse me and i know that my days are numbered but we know that these young men notice he goes i know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the lord these young men hope they've seen the fighting in that camp and the fighting in that camp and this one camped down on that doctrine this one camped down on that when ain't about camping down on a doctrine i'm ready to move into the promised land and i ask you where do we go it's time that we make our move church it's time that we move don't settle for just some halfway religion don't just settle for halfway healing move into the promised land move it to the joys of the lord we don't want to fight anymore we're not picking this preacher apart and picking that pastor apart and preaching this one apart no we got a word preach the word quit preaching about man's ideas and preach the word of god that's what keeps the people coming these young they weren't concerned about fighting no sir they want one thing i want my land i want the mountain the prophet god says time let's he said let's get off this mountain and move up to the promised land let's start going up possess the land god told them go up and possess it and the old fighters is gone now put your sword back in your sheaves and don't fight oh my listen man he says don't make the same mistake your fathers did or you'd be here another 40 years don't make the same mistake but the promise is unto you and it's unto your children and it's unto them that are far off and i've given you evidence of a good land i've given you evidence we're at the border we're less than three days journey we can see it from here while there's something stirring within a bride there's something stirring within a bride she wants the supernatural the prophet of god would say the move is on for the bride the move not camping down but the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord now as i bring this to a close i want the musicians to come back if they would caleb stealed the people before moses and he said let us go at once if there was ever time to run now's the time to run run with everything you got run with all the passion you have in you from with all the zeal you have in you run with every bit of energy that's left in you you run and you take this message and you run look and if you go by the way the grave the devil didn't get the victory because you're going to come up first you're going to be the one that comes and visits the family member says all right it's time i haven't been over there in the land i'm coming back to tell you it's all that he said it was oh but look church caleb and joshua caleb steal the people before moses and he said let us go at once and possess it we are well able more than able to possess the land oh the odds may be against you there may be a lot out there right now obviously against this church you're very tiny right maybe one of the only churches on the island i don't know how many people you have here but let's just say the odds are against you today and you're wondering how is this going to happen how is this going to be possible notice for every spy that had a negative report it was five to one five negative to one caleb five negative to one joshua the odds are against you but last year there was a two-year-old colt that finished dead last in his first race just play something sister maureen disappointed his owners placed him in a claiming race where anyone that wanted to take ownership of this horse could do it for a fee and he was sold for thirty thousand dollars and that's not a lot of money in the horse racing industry some of those horses are million dollar horses and their seed sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars hoping to get another prodigy horse out of that seed but this man this horse was placed in a claiming race where anyone that wanted to take ownership of this horse could do it for a fee and an older man he claims his horse after missing his chance to claim another horse that he wanted and he says this is my last attempt to have any success in the horse racing industry and in that race that coat wins by 17 lengths i mean he's like oh i got me a good one now you know and the new owner was encouraged but the race the several races that followed he finished third twice fourth once in fifth once but his owner still believed his owner still believed you may have come in only once once but he still believes he may have come in fourth once but he still believes he may have come in third you got close maybe you you know you really getting there three times but he still believes but in 2022 the colts only chance to race in a major thoroughbred race which was limited to three-year-old horses notice now the day before the kentucky derby the field of horses was already full he had no chance he was already full aren't you glad god doesn't do you like that just waiting for somebody to fail so you can move into the pack no god's already hand-picked you guys already got your place set at the table oh church if you can start looking through the eyes of fates right now him realize who is going to be my neighbor at the dinner supper man i like eating supper and i can't wait to eat this evening but wait till we get to the wedding supper and i got a special place nobody can sit at my place brother paul nobody can take my place at that table i'm just wondering will i get to sit next to paul i hope god puts me next to shamgar because i think me and sham guard will just hit it right off just put me right in front of them shaman guard tell me about your story because i sure display it really fine there when i go out and preach the sham guard story i love one of my favorites but yet at that table nobody can take your place but here it was all the field of horses is already done but at the last moment a famous rider a famous trainer scratches or he withdraws his horse from the kentucky derby and the cult takes his place in the field of 20 horses just 30 seconds before the deadline look how close 30 seconds before the deadline now he's in the game it's not by mistake that you're here this morning now you're in the game now you got a chance oh the owner has faith in you he has confidence in you he's got confidence in the seed brother mark that he put inside of you notice all the metrics and all the predictors are against him neither his owner nor his trainer nor his jockey has ever been associated with any horse in the kentucky derby his jockey has never won a major event that jockey shouldn't have been on that horse and that horse shouldn't have been in that race you know what and that's exactly what the devil tells you you shouldn't be here you don't belong here you're not worthy to be here you just squeaked on by he only had 30 seconds but it ain't by mistake that he was put there he was gonna make history i'm talking about a bride that's about to make history i'm telling i'm talking about a bride who's about to make history saints through every age as long for this moment they have longed for this race [Music] they have longed to be where you are right now you know i just made it in i just got in about 30 seconds hold but you're in you're in the game this morning you got a chance this morning what do you gotta do you gotta prove that you're not gonna stay in the shop you're gonna move out and you're gonna run the race with everything that's within you see this jockey had never won a major event they were outsiders they were newbies in an elite arena in the morning of the race the odds of winning are set at 80 to 1. 80 to 1 the second longest shot in the kentucky derby history 80 to one halfway around the track y'all want to hear the rest of the story oh y'all want me to just leave halfway around the track he's 16 horses back from the lead there they go again they can't even run look at them we put them in this major event we're running the greatest race of all time and they just loafing and that's how we feel sometimes ain't it you got all these thoroughbreds out there running snorting and hollering everybody's just ripping and going and they're just sitting back 16 horses from the back he can't even be seen in the field of view by the drone that's flying overhead he's a nobody he's a throwaway he's an inconsequential participant in the race he was only there to fill a quorum so that they could do the kentucky derby but he began to make his move he began to make his move and the prophet of god say when god moves he moves oh church don't don't don't don't give up on yourself oh believe in yourself he begin to make his move he begins working his way through the crowded pack he began to work his way through cancer he began to work his way around fear he began to work his way around the oppression he began to work his way around anxiety he began to work her way around the difficulties of the family he began to find the little narrow pass little fleeting opportunity to improve his position and as they head toward the finish line he's moved up the fifth then he's moved up to four still he's unnoticed nobody sees them nobody hears them and he's still unnoticed and here he is almost in a single breath he goes now the announcer has struggled to identify him and to say his name let me back up he said only seconds before the finish he suddenly and magically passes the two front runners suddenly magically because he's in the race the greatest race of all time is you're running it notice nobody counted you in the odds are against you only seconds before the finish he suddenly and magically passes the two front runners and the announcer struggles to identify him i'm so glad god doesn't struggle to identify who we are god knows your name god know he said your names are engraved on the palms of my hand god ain't looking over there make sure okay you're paul right okay and your joke right now god ain't looking at god knows where you are in the race god knows your name and he's just waiting he's just looking he's oh man they're close to the promised land they're close to they're close to the victory right there they're close to their healing right there there's just a few seconds away from faith right there let faith rise up and we find just a few seconds hear the announcements and say oh this struggle he's struggling to find his name but he says in a single breath rich strike is coming up on the inside oh my goodness the longest shot in kentucky derby history has just won the race i mean i tell you church you're the longest shot ages and ages have been waiting for you to be here and the devil didn't count you in nobody counted you in but you're in the race this is your moment this is your time make your move make your move past fear make your move past depression make your move past cancer make your move church make your move make your move sister maureen we ain't backing off that prayer last night we're making our move we're making our move you're in the game you're in the race the thing about it is you can't lose we've already read the back of the book brother paul you're a winner brother joe you're a winner oh brother you're a winner you can't lose god's got your placement set you're there he's just waiting he's waiting we're that close to a body change we're that close to a rapture it's time we don't get earthbound it's time we don't count down on things it's time that we make our move oh hallelujah yes sir don't you want to make your move this morning won't you just stand to make your move right there in your seat make your move say god i'm not going to stay where i'm at i'm not going to let this weekend pass me by god i'm going to make my move i'm going to go from this place and i'm going to make advancements i'm going to keep tying down stakes i'm going to keep driving forth into the promised land of the word of god father how we thank you this morning how we thank you god lord we're not some thoroughbred horse that made history just a few weeks ago but god were your bride and yet lord all the historians in the world has counted us out lord our worlds turn liberal or they don't want anything to do with the righteous but god we're in the race and god we're running with everything within us and i pray lord that the believers here and even like fellowship father they by no means start to look around father and wonder where the other participants are in the race but may they just keep their eyes focused may they continue to run god may they lay aside every weight and every sin that was so easy but settlement and pull them back lord may they not feed on the things that would decrease their faith but may they begin to just look on the things of god lord feast on that word
