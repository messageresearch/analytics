[39:27] Lord, to hear our name called,
[39:31] Lord. To realize there was more to our
[39:32] life than we ever thought, Lord. To
[39:35] realize that we are children of God,
[39:38] Lord. That we've been called. We've been
[39:39] elected. We've been predestinated. Lord,
[39:42] we've been prepared. Lord, there's a
[39:43] seed inside of us that's growing out,
[39:45] Lord, to express your word.
[39:48] Lord, we're thankful for how you picked
[39:50] us up, cleaned us up, moved us out,
[39:54] Lord. How you set our feet on a highway
[39:56] of holiness, Lord. How you moved us
[39:58] forward, Lord, into your word and into
[40:00] your way. And Lord, we just want to
[40:02] continue that day by day, Lord, that we
[40:04] would just put one foot in front of the
[40:06] other, Lord. Just take one day at a
[40:08] time, Lord, trusting you by faith, Lord,
[40:10] to fulfill your end of the promise.
[40:12] Lord, we're here this morning, Lord,
[40:14] expecting you to speak, to encourage, to
[40:16] anchor, to correct, Lord, to draw us
[40:18] closer to you, to separate us further
[40:20] from the world. Lord, to give us
[40:22] victory, to give us healing, to give us
[40:23] deliverance, to give us direction, Lord.
[40:26] You know the lives, you know the hearts,
[40:27] you know the situations for each one.
[40:30] Lord, we're asking you to just be with
[40:31] us this morning once again now. In Jesus
[40:34] Christ's name we pray it. Amen. God
[40:37] bless you. Turn if you would to Luke
[40:38] chapter 17.
[40:40] Amen. Luke chapter 17 verse 26.
[40:44] Amen. Good to see each one here this
[40:47] morning. And I forgot to welcome my mom
[40:49] when she was here last Sunday. And so I
[40:51] have to at least remind that she's going
[40:54] out tomorrow. She's flying home
[40:55] tomorrow. So we want God's grace to be
[40:57] with her. Keep her safe as she travels.
[40:59] Amen. It's always good to see her and
[41:01] have her here. Amen. Luke 17. This is a
[41:05] very familiar chapter for those that
[41:06] believe this end time message. Amen. It
[41:09] says this. And as it was in the days of
[41:11] Noah, shall so shall it be also in the
[41:14] days of the son of man. They did eat,
[41:16] they drank, they married wives, they
[41:18] were given in marriage until the day
[41:20] that Noah entered into the ark, and the
[41:22] flood came and destroyed them all.
[41:24] Likewise also as it was in the days of
[41:26] Lot, they did eat, they drank, they
[41:28] bought, they sold, they planted, they
[41:29] builded. But the same day that Lot went
[41:32] out of Sodom, it rained fire and
[41:33] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[41:35] all. Even thus shall it be in the day
[41:38] when the Son of Man is revealed. Amen.
[41:41] God bless you. You can have your seats
[41:42] this morning. We're taking a fourth
[41:44] service on this idea of a restoration
[41:47] message and we've preached now multiple
[41:49] services on this. And I'm hoping some of
[41:52] this will be eye opening for some of you
[41:53] that haven't seen or heard what I'm
[41:55] going to show today. But it'll also
[41:56] reinforce why we preach what we preach,
[41:58] why we believe what we believe today.
[42:00] And we've been preaching on a prophet to
[42:02] this final age. And if you haven't been
[42:04] here for those services, again, I would
[42:06] suggest you go back and listen to parts
[42:07] one, two, and three because it'll set
[42:10] you up for this part and then the fifth
[42:11] part again hopefully, Lord willing, on
[42:13] Wednesday. Amen. But we want to today
[42:15] name him. We want to show him. We want
[42:17] to let you see who this person is and
[42:19] how we know that he's the prophet that
[42:21] the scriptures spoke about. But two
[42:23] services ago, we read these words that
[42:25] Jesus said. And he says, "And his
[42:27] disciples said unto him, why then say
[42:29] the scribes that Elijah or Elias must
[42:31] first come." So there they had seen him
[42:33] on Mount Transfiguration. He'd been
[42:35] changed. He was glorified. And they
[42:36] thought that this was the coming of the
[42:38] the son of God that had been prophesied.
[42:40] And so the Romans were going to get
[42:41] kicked out and this would be the
[42:43] restoration of the kingdom to the to the
[42:45] Jews. They'd have Israel back. They'd
[42:47] have a thousand years of peace. And they
[42:48] said, "Hey, I thought Elijah was
[42:50] supposed to come." And Jesus answered
[42:52] and said unto them, Elias truly shall
[42:55] first come and restore all things. So he
[42:58] said, "This is not what you think it is.
[43:00] What you just saw is not what you
[43:01] thought it is. This was just a a a
[43:04] foretaste of what's going to happen to
[43:06] me, and you've got an insight into that.
[43:08] But this is not the day where Israel
[43:10] gets set free from all that's over them,
[43:12] where they get to turn their their uh
[43:15] weapons into plow plows and the farming
[43:18] instruments and those different things."
[43:19] He says, "You missed it." He says Elijah
[43:21] still has to first come. And when he
[43:23] comes, his ministry will be to restore
[43:26] all things. Well, you can't restore
[43:27] something unless it's lost first. It has
[43:30] to come, it has to be received, and then
[43:32] it has to be lost and then restored
[43:34] again. Amen. And so, we know that this
[43:36] coming of Elijah, and it's not Elijah,
[43:38] it's the spirit of Elijah. It's the
[43:40] anointing that was on Elijah will be a
[43:42] restoring anointing. Amen. And that
[43:44] means it has to come with a restoring
[43:46] message. Amen. Because God always comes
[43:49] through his word. Amen. And so we see
[43:51] Jesus pointing forward to this Elijah
[43:53] ministry. We see where Peter pointed to
[43:55] it. We've been reading in Revelation
[43:56] where John pointed forward to it. And
[43:58] it's all specific to the time that we're
[44:00] living in today. And we know that Elijah
[44:03] was a prophet. Elisha was a prophet.
[44:06] John the Baptist was the other Elijah
[44:08] that was supposed to come and he was a
[44:09] prophet. So I think it's safe to say
[44:11] that the next Elijah is going to be a
[44:14] prophet. Is that too much of a stretch
[44:16] to say that if the the three previous
[44:18] anointings of Elijah were prophets, then
[44:20] the fourth ought to be a prophet as
[44:21] well? It also means the fifth ought to
[44:23] be a prophet because there's five
[44:24] comingings of Elijah that come to this
[44:26] earth. Amen. So, we see that that
[44:28] follows in the Bible pattern of the
[44:30] Elijah ministry being a prophetic
[44:32] anointing. And in Revelation 11, we see
[44:35] the spirit of Elijah coming down on that
[44:37] final Elijah prophet to the Jews. And we
[44:39] know he's a prophet because he acts like
[44:42] a prophet. He speaks like a prophet and
[44:44] he gets the same results of the prophet
[44:46] Elijah. Amen. So the Elijah spirit is a
[44:49] prophetic spirit. We can't make it
[44:50] anything else than that. Amen. It has to
[44:52] be a prophetic spirit. The whole
[44:54] scripture declares it. We read it in
[44:55] Malachi 4:5 and 6 that what that spirit
[44:58] is. And then we read in Matthew 17 what
[45:01] Jesus said. And then we read about it in
[45:02] Revelation 3. And we see again in
[45:05] Revelation 10 that this Elijah prophet
[45:07] is tied to an end time message. He's got
[45:10] a voice that's supposed to speak and
[45:12] it's supposed to bring the people back
[45:14] to what was lost from the first church
[45:17] age. Bring us back to the days of the
[45:19] faith of the original apostolic fathers.
[45:22] Amen. And it's an end time preparation
[45:25] for Christ to be revealed to his bride
[45:28] and then to take her into a rapture.
[45:30] Amen. That's what he's supposed to do.
[45:32] He comes before judgment. He comes with
[45:34] a restoring message to draw the true
[45:35] believers back to Christ, the word.
[45:38] Amen. And we've read all these
[45:39] scriptures in the last few services. But
[45:41] the question is, what does his ministry
[45:43] look like? What will be the sign of his
[45:45] ministry? How are we going to identify
[45:46] this man? And to do that, church, we can
[45:49] only go one place, scripture.
[45:52] We don't want to make up a criteria of
[45:53] oursel. We want to go back and look in
[45:55] the scripture and see what Elijah did,
[45:57] what the scripture says Elijah is
[45:58] supposed to do. And then we take that
[46:00] criteria and we we compare every
[46:02] ministry against it until we find one
[46:04] that locks into all of those attributes
[46:06] that are supposed to come here. Amen. So
[46:08] I want to start with something to set
[46:09] the stage here because we have to
[46:11] understand how Christ comes. Amen. We
[46:14] call Jesus the son of God. When you talk
[46:16] to a trinitarian they say God the
[46:18] father, God the son, God the holy ghost.
[46:20] So they call Jesus the son of God. But
[46:22] we see that when Jesus came in flesh and
[46:24] died for our sins he did not call
[46:26] himself the son of God. He called
[46:28] himself something completely different.
[46:30] He used a different title. He used a
[46:31] different identifier while he was here
[46:34] in flesh. And we see, and I could do
[46:36] dozens of scriptures with this, but I
[46:37] just picked three. He said, "For the Son
[46:39] of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath day."
[46:42] Remember when they were saying, "Your
[46:44] disciples, they go and they're eating
[46:45] corn on the Sabbath day." He says,
[46:46] "Listen, I'm the Lord of the Sabbath
[46:47] day. I can tell him to do whatever I
[46:49] want because I'm the Lord of the
[46:50] Sabbath." But he calls himself there,
[46:51] the son of man. Then he says later, he
[46:54] says, "There's only one sign going to be
[46:55] given to you." He said, "For as Jonas
[46:56] was three days and three nights in the
[46:58] whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man
[47:01] be three days and three nights in the
[47:02] heart of the earth." He doesn't call
[47:04] himself son of God. He calls himself son
[47:06] of man. Then he says later in Matthew
[47:08] when Jesus came to the coast of Cesaria
[47:10] Philippi he asked his disciples who do
[47:12] men say that I the son of man am. So
[47:17] over and over he identifies himself as
[47:19] son of man. Over 80 times in the four
[47:22] gospels he calls himself son of man.
[47:24] Notice he doesn't identify himself as
[47:26] deity
[47:28] his title I'm talking about. He doesn't
[47:30] identify himself as a spirit, but he
[47:33] identifies himself with mankind. He
[47:35] identifies himself with human flesh.
[47:37] Amen. He is the son of man. He's a
[47:40] human. He's blood and bone and flesh.
[47:42] And that's the office. That's the title
[47:44] of the office he took while his he was
[47:46] here. So remember now that Jesus came to
[47:49] fulfill the word that was written of
[47:51] him. And notice what Moses said that he
[47:54] would be. When we go back to the book of
[47:56] Deuteronomy, it says, "The Lord thy God
[47:58] will raise up unto thee a prophet,
[48:02] capital P, not a lowercase P, a capital
[48:06] P prophet, the prophet.
[48:09] God will raise up unto thee a prophet
[48:11] from the midst of thee of thy brethren.
[48:14] He'll be flesh and bone, and it'll be
[48:16] like unto me, him ye unto him shall ye
[48:20] hearken." So why does Moses say here,
[48:22] "He's going to be like me." He says,
[48:23] "It's like unto me." He says, "This
[48:24] great future prophet will be like me."
[48:28] Why does he say that? Why does he just
[48:30] say a prophet? Because you have to
[48:32] understand that Moses wasn't just any
[48:33] old prophet. There were lots of regular
[48:36] prophets in the in the Bible, but Moses
[48:38] was a special prophet. And God made it
[48:41] clear that Moses was different than
[48:43] anybody else that he dealt with in
[48:45] scripture. So much so that God told
[48:47] Moses, he says, "The mo the people have
[48:49] chosen you to speak to them. Therefore,
[48:51] I will make you God to them.
[48:57] He wasn't God. Catch it. But he says,
[49:00] "You will be God to them. They can't
[49:02] hear me speak. They've rejected my
[49:04] voice. It scares them too much." He
[49:06] said, "So Moses, you will speak as God
[49:09] and Aaron will be your prophet."
[49:12] So God, when he dealt with Moses, he was
[49:14] a word prophet. He got access directly
[49:17] to God like nobody else did. God told
[49:19] Moses things. God showed Moses things
[49:21] that he didn't breathe a word about to
[49:22] anyone. He didn't give a hint to anyone.
[49:24] He spoke to Moses in a very particular
[49:26] way. And God was God set Moses aside. He
[49:29] was very special to God. And God dealt
[49:32] with him in ways that he never did with
[49:34] any other people. Now remember when
[49:36] Aaron and and and Miriam spoke against
[49:38] Moses because he had married that
[49:40] Ethiopian woman and they were giving him
[49:42] a hard time about it. And God told
[49:45] Moses, he says, "Call Aaron and Miriam
[49:47] into my into the tabernacle. I want to
[49:49] talk to them. Now look at this
[49:50] conversation God has. It says, "And the
[49:53] Lord came down in the pillar of cloud
[49:55] and stood in the door of the tabernacle
[49:57] and called Aaron and Miriam. They both
[49:59] came forth and he said, "Hear now my
[50:02] words. If there be a prophet among you,
[50:04] I the Lord will make myself known unto
[50:06] him in a vision and will speak to him in
[50:08] a dream."
[50:11] That's a pretty typical prophetic
[50:12] experience. But notice verse seven. He
[50:14] says, "My servant Moses is not so. Who
[50:19] is faithful in all mine house?" Notice
[50:23] faithful. Aaron's a prophet. Aaron
[50:25] wasn't faithful, church.
[50:28] Aaron wasn't faithful. Aaron built the
[50:30] golden calf.
[50:32] Aaron was a prophet. Aaron had the word
[50:34] of the Lord. Aaron had a gift. Miriam
[50:36] was a prophet. This, she had a gift. He
[50:38] says, "Listen, Moses isn't like you two.
[50:41] And that's your problem. and you think
[50:42] he's just like you. He says, "With him
[50:45] will I speak mouthto mouth, even
[50:47] apparently and not in dark speeches."
[50:50] Another translation says, "I speak with
[50:52] him face to face, visibly, not in
[50:55] riddles."
[50:57] It says, "And the similitude of the Lord
[50:59] shall he behold." He gets to see what
[51:01] God actually looks like. He says,
[51:03] "Wherefore then were you not afraid to
[51:05] speak against my servant Moses." See pro
[51:08] the prophets were so often shown things
[51:10] in visions and dreams and many times in
[51:13] symbol form. They would hear words. They
[51:15] would see things but it didn't
[51:17] necessarily mean anything to them. They
[51:19] caught something but they didn't always
[51:21] have even an understanding of what they
[51:22] saw. You look at what Isaiah saw. You
[51:24] look at what Daniel saw in particular,
[51:26] John the Revelator. They saw these
[51:28] things and they saw wheels in the middle
[51:30] of a wheel and they saw a stone coming
[51:31] down not cut out of hands and they saw
[51:33] uh all these different things. And
[51:35] Daniel said, "What is this and when is
[51:37] it going to be?" And God says, "It's not
[51:38] for you to know. It's for you to see,
[51:39] but it's not for you to know." And so
[51:41] prophets would get these things. You
[51:43] look at the book of Isaiah in
[51:44] particular, and it's prophetic, and it's
[51:46] speaking to all the things that are
[51:48] going to happen to to the Israelites,
[51:50] and it doesn't say who these people are
[51:51] going to be. It'll say a king from the
[51:53] south, a king from the north, and this
[51:54] one will come in, and that one come in.
[51:55] Not named. It just says they're going to
[51:57] come. And you only knew it when it
[51:59] happened, hopefully. But the prophets
[52:01] didn't know about these things. It
[52:02] wasn't always obvious what God was
[52:04] saying because God has a time to reveal
[52:06] these things, but he still brings it
[52:08] through his prophets. But he says with
[52:09] Moses, it's different. He says, "I talk
[52:11] to him directly. I give him plain
[52:13] speech. There's no riddles. There's no
[52:16] guesswork. When I want to tell him
[52:18] something, he knows exactly what I'm
[52:19] talking about." He didn't come out
[52:21] wondering. Now, guys, here's what God
[52:23] told me, but I'm really not sure. So,
[52:24] let's just sit on it a bit. Remember
[52:26] when God gave Moses the commandments for
[52:28] the people and and he said, "You can't
[52:31] do any work on the Sabbath." And then
[52:32] that man went out and he he gathered up
[52:34] some sticks to make a fire to cook his
[52:36] breakfast. And the people caught him.
[52:38] They brought him to Moses. They said,
[52:39] "Moses, what do we do?" What did Moses
[52:40] do? Moses said, "Let me talk to God."
[52:42] And he went in and God said, "That man's
[52:44] got to die. He broke my word." See, he
[52:47] didn't say he he didn't give him a
[52:49] vision. He didn't didn't give him a
[52:50] dream. God came down and spoke to Moses
[52:53] lifted to ear church. God had direct
[52:56] back and forth conversations with Moses.
[53:00] He didn't do that with Aaron. He didn't
[53:01] do that with Miriam. He would come down
[53:03] and it was a one-way thing. He would
[53:05] send something and that they were
[53:06] supposed to share. But with Moses, it
[53:08] was a back and forth discussion. Okay?
[53:10] You catch what I'm saying? Amen. Not
[53:13] through an angel. Daniel had an angel.
[53:16] Remember, John had an angel,
[53:20] but Moses had God himself speaking to
[53:22] him. Okay, Moses prophesied of the
[53:26] coming Messiah and he said he's going to
[53:28] be a prophet just like me. Okay, a
[53:33] prophet, not a it's a son of man, not a
[53:35] son of God or a Holy Spirit, a son of
[53:37] man, someone in flesh revealing the
[53:40] direct will and word of God. And Jesus
[53:42] came fulfilling that scripture like a
[53:45] prophet, like unto Moses. And in doing
[53:47] Deuteronomy 18:19, Moses would say, "I
[53:50] will raise them up a prophet from among
[53:51] their brethren like unto thee, and I
[53:54] will put my words in his mouth, and he
[53:57] shall speak unto them all that I shall
[54:00] command him." So he has a direct line to
[54:03] God, and he will speak words as he has
[54:06] given them. No wondering, no darkness to
[54:09] it, no symbolic form. What I tell him,
[54:12] he's going to speak. He will be fully
[54:14] subject to God. Okay. He says, "And it
[54:18] shall come to pass that whosoever will
[54:19] not hearken unto my words which he shall
[54:22] speak in my name, I'll require of him."
[54:24] The Common English Bible says, "I myself
[54:27] will hold accountable anyone who doesn't
[54:28] listen to my words."
[54:32] He says, "Which that prophet shall speak
[54:34] in my name."
[54:37] So, he'll speak it as God.
[54:41] And if you don't listen to him as God,
[54:43] God's going to hold you accountable for
[54:45] it. We saw what happened in Moses day.
[54:47] Moses gave the people the word and they
[54:49] had to take it or they had to leave it.
[54:50] But if they leave it, God held them
[54:52] accountable. And under the law, it
[54:54] wasn't good to be held accountable
[54:55] because it was death. It was
[54:57] dismemberment. Your family suffered. You
[54:58] lost your home. You lost your
[55:00] possessions. You lost your life. It was
[55:01] a miserable thing to be held accountable
[55:03] by God. He says, "This is the way it's
[55:06] going to go." Why? Because they weren't
[55:07] rebelling so many times. See, church,
[55:09] they thought they were rebelling against
[55:10] Moses. It wasn't Moses. It was God they
[55:13] were rebelling with. Moses was just
[55:15] repeating God's words. And so their
[55:17] rebellion was not against Moses. Their
[55:19] rebellion was against God. And so God
[55:20] judged them for it. And so whenever
[55:22] Moses said something, it came to pass.
[55:25] When Moses said, "Let there be flies,"
[55:27] flies came. When Moses said, "Let there
[55:29] be blood in the water," there was blood
[55:30] in the water. When Moses said, "Let the
[55:31] waters be divided." The waters were
[55:33] divided. Whatever he said came to pass.
[55:36] And that's what makes Moses the faithful
[55:38] witness that we read about. He says,
[55:40] "Moses is faithful in all the camp."
[55:42] Moses is the one that is faithful no
[55:44] matter what. That word faithful means
[55:46] trustworthy, believable, truthful. So in
[55:49] other words, you could bet your life on
[55:50] what Moses said. You could rest on what
[55:53] Moses said that it was going to happen.
[55:55] And that's the identifier of a prophet
[55:57] is that what they say in the name of the
[55:59] Lord comes to pass every time. Amen.
[56:03] That's how you know a true prophet.
[56:04] Amen. That was a test of the prophet was
[56:06] that if he said it and it came to pass,
[56:08] then believe him and fear him. In other
[56:10] words, respect what he's saying. But if
[56:12] it didn't come to pass, he said, "You
[56:13] don't have to respect him. You don't
[56:14] have to listen to him. Leave him alone."
[56:17] Okay? Now, then Christ comes as a son of
[56:20] man in flesh 2,000 years ago, and he
[56:22] comes as a prophet like unto Moses. And
[56:25] we see him him identifying his prophetic
[56:28] experience on earth. And he says, "Then
[56:30] answered Jesus unto them, and said,
[56:31] verily be unto you, the Son can do
[56:33] nothing of himself, but what he seeth
[56:36] the Father do." what he seeth, not just
[56:40] heareth, seeth. He says, "For whatsoever
[56:44] things he doeth, those things also the
[56:46] son likewise." So he could do nothing
[56:48] except what God was showing him. Amen.
[56:50] He was bound by what he saw in those
[56:53] visions. So Jesus would see visions.
[56:56] He'd see things that were going to
[56:57] happen. He would see into people's
[56:59] lives. He would see all these things and
[57:01] he would act on what God told him to do.
[57:03] Now notice Moses was a type of Christ.
[57:05] But Moses still failed.
[57:08] Because Moses smoked the rock. Remember
[57:10] God said, "Call out water from the
[57:12] rock." And Moses went out and he says,
[57:14] "Ye rebels, how often do I have to do
[57:16] this?" And he smote the rock and then it
[57:18] split open and water came out of it. Now
[57:20] remember that rock was a type of Christ.
[57:22] And Moses broke the type because Christ
[57:24] obeyed the word. It was spoken to him
[57:28] and he did what he was told to do. Moses
[57:31] broke it by forcing the rock to give
[57:33] water. Christ didn't wasn't forced to
[57:35] give his life. He willingly gave his
[57:37] life and Moses broke the type and that
[57:39] was his one disobedience and God judged
[57:41] him for it and he wasn't allowed to go
[57:42] in. But Jesus never failed. Jesus was
[57:47] always a faithful witness. Amen. And we
[57:49] would say today that Jesus had what we
[57:51] would call an open vision ministry. He
[57:54] could have a vision at any time,
[57:56] anywhere, and he would see events happen
[57:58] and he could he could relay what he was
[58:00] seeing. He could act on what he was
[58:01] seeing. He could do what God showed him
[58:03] to do. And we read about him in Samaria
[58:06] or in John 4 about when he's going to go
[58:07] to Samaria. And the scripture says he
[58:10] must needs go through Samaria. In other
[58:12] words, he had to go through Samaria.
[58:14] Now, if you look at a map, it seems that
[58:17] perhaps he should go. So, the black line
[58:19] is going through Samaria. The red line
[58:21] is going through the Jordan River and
[58:23] through the river valley. And see, the
[58:25] thing is, none of the Jews wanted to go
[58:28] through Samaria because of all the
[58:29] tensions that were there. over a
[58:31] hundred-year feud that had been going on
[58:32] with the Samaritans. They were a mixed
[58:34] group of people. They were despised by
[58:36] the Jews. So, nobody would go the short
[58:38] route through Samaria. Everyone would go
[58:40] the longer route, but the easier route
[58:44] to go through the Jordan Valley. But
[58:45] Jesus said, "Guys, we've got to go
[58:47] through Samaria." Oh, church. He took
[58:50] the harder way. He went to where people
[58:52] would say, "Why is he doing that?" He'd
[58:54] get criticized. He'd offend people. He'd
[58:56] bother people because he he went
[58:58] someplace where they wouldn't go. But
[59:00] why was he going? Because something had
[59:02] been shown to him and he had to obey
[59:05] what he'd seen and he had to go meet a
[59:08] woman. Church, he took the heart away to
[59:11] go go see a daughter of God in her
[59:13] horrible condition. And I want to read
[59:15] this story and I want to read the whole
[59:17] story today for a purpose. Amen. Because
[59:20] he went there to touch a soul.
[59:23] Not just to change circumstances, but he
[59:25] went there to change a life completely.
[59:28] And I want us to read this this morning
[59:29] because I'm going to show you the same
[59:31] thing in our day. And we look in John 4
[59:33] and it says, "He left Judea and parted
[59:35] departed again into Galilee. But he must
[59:38] needs go through Samaria. Then cometh he
[59:40] to a city of Samaria which is called
[59:42] Sikar near to the parcel of ground that
[59:44] Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now
[59:47] Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore
[59:49] being wearied with his journey sat thus
[59:51] on the well and it was about the sixth
[59:52] hour." That's around noon. It says, "And
[59:55] then cometh a woman of Samaria to draw
[59:57] water. Jesus saith unto her, Give me to
[1:00:00] drink, for his disciples were gone away
[1:00:02] into the city to buy meat. Then saith
[1:00:05] the woman of Samaria unto him, how is it
[1:00:08] that thou being a Jew ask this as drink
[1:00:10] of me which am a woman of Samaria? For
[1:00:12] the Jews have no dealings with the
[1:00:14] Samaritans." So church, he's broken
[1:00:16] tradition right there. He's talked to a
[1:00:18] person that he should never have talked
[1:00:20] to according to the Jewish tradition.
[1:00:22] people despised, people rejected, people
[1:00:25] that would never be seen with the good
[1:00:28] people of the Jewish faith.
[1:00:31] She says, "Why are you talking to me? No
[1:00:32] Jews talk to me." And Jesus answered
[1:00:35] unto her, answered and said unto her,
[1:00:38] "If thou kneest the gift of God,"
[1:00:42] church, you got to recognize him
[1:00:43] yourself. You got to recognize him
[1:00:46] today. If thou kneest the gift of God,
[1:00:49] and who it is that saith today, give to
[1:00:51] give me to drink, then thou wouldest
[1:00:53] asked of him, and he would have given
[1:00:55] thee living water. Now, sure, she's got
[1:00:58] an answer she has never heard in her
[1:01:00] life. He says, "If you knew who I was,
[1:01:03] you'd ask me to give you water, living
[1:01:05] water." And the woman said unto him,
[1:01:07] "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
[1:01:09] and the well is deep. From whence then
[1:01:11] hast thou this living water?" She says,
[1:01:13] "You don't have a bucket. You don't have
[1:01:14] a rope. you can't get water and you told
[1:01:17] me that you're going to give me water.
[1:01:18] How are you going to do it? And he says,
[1:01:21] "Are you greater than our father Jacob,
[1:01:23] which gave us the well and drank thereof
[1:01:25] himself and his children and his cattle?
[1:01:27] Are you bigger and better than Jacob?
[1:01:31] Are you better than our forefathers?
[1:01:34] The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[1:01:36] the three that are listed as our
[1:01:38] forefathers. Are you greater than him?
[1:01:41] Because he couldn't get it out except
[1:01:42] this way. and you're saying you can. It
[1:01:45] says, "Jesus answered and said unto her,
[1:01:47] whosoever drinkketh of this water shall
[1:01:50] thirst again." So, he's trying to
[1:01:51] elevate her, church. He's trying to get
[1:01:53] her sights a little higher. He says,
[1:01:55] "But whosoever drinkketh of the water
[1:01:58] that I shall give him shall never
[1:02:00] thirst, but the water that I shall give
[1:02:03] him shall be in him, a well of water
[1:02:05] springing up into everlasting life."
[1:02:08] Now, I want you to catch something here
[1:02:09] because Jesus is about to show her a
[1:02:11] sign. But his purpose is not to show a
[1:02:14] sign. His purpose is to get her to
[1:02:16] receive Christ the word.
[1:02:20] He says living water. Water is always
[1:02:23] the word.
[1:02:25] Amen. The water is the word of God. He's
[1:02:27] getting her attention so she can believe
[1:02:29] his word, not just accept that he's a
[1:02:32] prophet. church. That's why we don't
[1:02:34] force people that come through our
[1:02:35] church doors to dress the way we dress,
[1:02:37] to look the way we look, to eat the way
[1:02:39] we eat, to not do the things we don't
[1:02:40] do, to do things the we way we do. Why?
[1:02:43] Because until their thirst is satisfied
[1:02:45] with living water, we're just convincing
[1:02:47] them in and somebody else will convince
[1:02:49] them out. But what happens when you meet
[1:02:51] Christ is your thirst is quenched. And
[1:02:54] you only want to drink what he brings
[1:02:56] you rather than what the rest of the
[1:02:58] world has. That's your deliverance is
[1:03:00] when you're satisfied with Christ.
[1:03:02] That's what we're looking for here is a
[1:03:04] new birth. Not just a reformation, not
[1:03:07] just a confirmation. Amen. It's what?
[1:03:10] Their thirst will be quenched by the
[1:03:12] living word of everlasting life. Amen.
[1:03:15] Now, catch this. She He says, "Listen,
[1:03:17] when you drink the water I give you,
[1:03:19] you'll never thirst again."
[1:03:22] The woman said unto him, "Sir, give me
[1:03:24] this water that I thirst not, neither
[1:03:27] come hither to draw." Church, you have
[1:03:29] to realize something. She's drawing
[1:03:31] water in the middle of the day when the
[1:03:33] sun is hot. She couldn't go in the
[1:03:36] morning with the other women because she
[1:03:38] was a woman of ill fame. We'll see what
[1:03:41] he says about her a bit. She wasn't
[1:03:43] allowed to walk with the good people of
[1:03:44] Samaria church. They were the bad people
[1:03:46] and she was the worst of the bad people.
[1:03:49] They wouldn't allow her to go with them
[1:03:50] to the well because she was an unclean
[1:03:52] woman. She was disgraced.
[1:03:56] Her life was a mess. She said, "Give me
[1:03:58] this water so I don't have to have this
[1:04:00] shameful walk every single day." See,
[1:04:02] church, she wanted to be set free from
[1:04:04] the fruit of her decisions.
[1:04:07] Can you blame her? Don't we all want
[1:04:09] that?
[1:04:11] But listen now. Jesus saith unto her,
[1:04:14] "Go call thy husband and come hither."
[1:04:16] What a weird thing to say. Remember, he
[1:04:19] has an open vision ministry church. "Go
[1:04:21] call your husband and then come back."
[1:04:24] The woman answered and said,"I have no
[1:04:26] husband."
[1:04:28] Jesus saith unto her, "Thou hast well
[1:04:30] said, I have no husband." She says, "I'm
[1:04:33] not married." He says, "You're right.
[1:04:35] You're not married." But watch the next
[1:04:37] thing. He says, "For thou hast had five
[1:04:39] husbands."
[1:04:42] I can't imagine what many people would
[1:04:44] feel when that word, those words came
[1:04:46] out of his mouth.
[1:04:49] He says, "And he whom thou now hast is
[1:04:52] not thy husband." in that set us out
[1:04:54] truly. He said, "What you said was
[1:04:57] technically true, but here's the full
[1:04:59] truth about your life, sister. You've
[1:05:02] been married and divorced five times,
[1:05:05] and now you're living in a common law
[1:05:07] relationship." He says, "You're right.
[1:05:09] You don't have a husband."
[1:05:12] What would our reaction be to be called
[1:05:13] out?
[1:05:15] Because we can feel it as a being called
[1:05:17] out, church, or we can take it the way
[1:05:18] she took it. Amen.
[1:05:22] He says, "You're right.
[1:05:24] You have no husband, but here's what
[1:05:26] you've had, and here's what you
[1:05:27] currently have." She didn't lie, but she
[1:05:29] didn't tell the whole truth, church.
[1:05:32] None of us like to tell the whole truth.
[1:05:35] But Jesus shed said, "Here's the whole
[1:05:38] truth." Why didn't she say it, church?
[1:05:42] She was ashamed of it.
[1:05:45] None of his business.
[1:05:49] But watch her reaction. And this is what
[1:05:52] I love about this story, church, is her
[1:05:54] life has been laid bare
[1:05:57] for who she is. But he has no problem
[1:06:00] talking to her.
[1:06:02] He's not talking down to her. He's just
[1:06:05] talking to her. But what? Look what
[1:06:08] happens. She's not mad at him.
[1:06:11] She might be ashamed, but she's not
[1:06:13] running away from him. She's not
[1:06:15] berating him for butdding into her
[1:06:16] business, for opening up doors she
[1:06:19] didn't want opened. Why church? Because
[1:06:21] light has struck something in her that's
[1:06:23] never been struck before.
[1:06:25] Watch this. She said, the woman saith
[1:06:28] unto him, "Sir, I perceive that thou art
[1:06:32] a bigot. You're just like the rest of
[1:06:35] them."
[1:06:36] No, she said, "Sir, I perceive you're a
[1:06:40] prophet."
[1:06:43] Why? Because he was speaking in love,
[1:06:45] not in judgment.
[1:06:48] He was touching a part of her that had
[1:06:50] never been touched before.
[1:06:52] He was speaking to her soul. He was
[1:06:55] speaking to the seed gene of God that
[1:06:58] was laying inside of her. And it had
[1:07:00] just started to break open. And she
[1:07:02] said, "Whoa, what's this?"
[1:07:05] Because life was coming out.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; She was getting a taste of what she'd
[1:07:10] been searching for her entire life.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:16] church, you can't help but be a child of
[1:07:18] God if you're a child of God. And when
[1:07:20] he comes your way and he goes into your
[1:07:22] life, all you can say is, "I perceive
[1:07:25] that thou art the Christ."
[1:07:30] What a moment
[1:07:32] when most of us would, not most of us,
[1:07:35] most people would get offended, would
[1:07:38] get hurt, would walk away. He's judging
[1:07:42] me.
[1:07:44] He thinks I'm filth. He thinks I'm not
[1:07:46] worthy. She says, "Sir, I perceive thou
[1:07:49] art a prophet."
[1:07:51] Hallelujah.
[1:07:53] She said, "Art
[1:07:56] thou greater?" Sorry.
[1:08:00] He said, "Sir, I perceive thou art a
[1:08:02] prophet." She's on the right track,
[1:08:04] church, but she still hasn't caught it
[1:08:07] completely, but she has started to come
[1:08:09] into life. Amen. Now she gives him a
[1:08:13] scriptural question that's bothering
[1:08:15] her. Our fathers worshiped in this
[1:08:17] mountain and you guys say that in
[1:08:19] Jerusalem is the place where men ought
[1:08:21] to worship.
[1:08:23] Political question tied to spirituality.
[1:08:29] Jesus saith unto her, "Woman, believe
[1:08:31] me, the hour cometh when you shall
[1:08:33] neither in this mountain nor yet at
[1:08:35] Jerusalem worship the Father." He says,
[1:08:38] "You worship, you know not what."
[1:08:42] Another chance to get offended. You
[1:08:44] don't have a clue who you're worshiping.
[1:08:46] You don't even know what you're doing,
[1:08:48] lady.
[1:08:49] And he's not just saying you. He's
[1:08:51] saying the Samaritans.
[1:08:53] Your whole family group, your whole
[1:08:55] community doesn't have a clue what
[1:08:57] they're doing. He says, "We know what we
[1:09:00] worship."
[1:09:01] He says, "For salvation is of the Jews."
[1:09:03] He's saying, "We're here and you're
[1:09:05] here."
[1:09:07] Wow, she should have run away.
[1:09:10] He says, "But the hour cometh
[1:09:13] and now is."
[1:09:15] He says, "There's a time here." What I'm
[1:09:17] telling you about, it's here right now.
[1:09:19] When the true worshippers shall worship
[1:09:22] the Father in spirit and in truth, for
[1:09:25] the Father seeketh such to worship him.
[1:09:28] See, Jesus doesn't answer like the Jews.
[1:09:31] Because the Jews don't have a word
[1:09:32] answer. Jesus answers by the promise of
[1:09:35] the word of God that there is a spirit
[1:09:38] coming that's going to be poured out on
[1:09:40] them and it'll be the spirit of truth
[1:09:41] and they can worship wherever they are
[1:09:43] because he'll be in them. Amen.
[1:09:47] Remember what Paul said. He had broken
[1:09:49] down the wall of partition. Jesus said
[1:09:52] the hour's coming where it won't matter
[1:09:53] where. It'll just matter who
[1:09:57] because the spirit of truth will be
[1:09:59] inside you. The word quickened by the
[1:10:01] Holy Spirit is the only true place of
[1:10:03] worshiping.
[1:10:04] You can't worship under a false word.
[1:10:06] You can't worship under a false
[1:10:07] anointing. You've got to be under the
[1:10:08] word that's quickened by the spirit of
[1:10:10] truth. He says, "It's coming and it's
[1:10:12] here now where you can do that." He
[1:10:14] says, "God is a spirit, and they that
[1:10:16] worship him must worship him in spirit
[1:10:18] and in truth." And the woman saith unto
[1:10:21] him, I know that Messiah cometh, which
[1:10:24] is called Christ. When he's come, he'll
[1:10:26] tell us all these things. go into our
[1:10:29] lives and he'll bring us to the truth.
[1:10:32] And Jesus saith unto her, I that speak
[1:10:34] unto thee am he
[1:10:38] a beat up, worn out, adulterous,
[1:10:44] I dare not say the word.
[1:10:47] Put whatever name you want in there,
[1:10:49] church.
[1:10:52] And she recognizes the Messiah. And the
[1:10:55] priests call him a devil. And the
[1:10:57] scribes and the Pharisees say that he's
[1:10:59] of Satan and reject him. And a woman in
[1:11:03] a totally lost condition, we would say
[1:11:07] beyond salvage
[1:11:10] says, "When Messiah comes, he's going to
[1:11:12] tell us exactly what you just told me."
[1:11:14] And Jesus reveals himself to you. He
[1:11:16] says, "I'm he." He wouldn't tell the
[1:11:18] others,
[1:11:20] but he'll reveal himself to a broken
[1:11:22] woman. Amen. What was he doing, church?
[1:11:25] What caught her attention? He showed her
[1:11:27] the sign of the son of man. He went into
[1:11:31] her life. He discerned what she was
[1:11:33] thinking. He discerned what was going
[1:11:35] on. He saw what was happening in her
[1:11:37] life. And he was looking into her life,
[1:11:39] but he was speaking to her soul.
[1:11:42] Not just trying to change her condition.
[1:11:44] He's trying to change the inside of the
[1:11:46] inside by bringing that seed gene of God
[1:11:49] inside of her to life. Amen. He broke
[1:11:51] open that yearning in her life that had
[1:11:53] never been met. never been satisfied.
[1:11:56] And she'd been scratching an itch that
[1:11:58] could not be satisfied. And in one
[1:12:01] little conversation, church, she had the
[1:12:03] full satisfaction she'd been looking
[1:12:05] for. She left her water pots and she ran
[1:12:07] into the city and she says, "Is not this
[1:12:10] the very Christ who told me all of my
[1:12:12] life?"
[1:12:14] Why? She recognized him by his son of
[1:12:17] man pattern. Okay,
[1:12:20] notice the sequence of events. He shows
[1:12:22] her the Messiah sign. the son of man
[1:12:25] sign, the discernment of the thoughts
[1:12:26] and intents, looks into her life, shows
[1:12:28] her things he could never know. He's
[1:12:30] never met this woman. He's never been in
[1:12:31] this city before. And he comes in and he
[1:12:34] tells her exactly who she is and what
[1:12:37] her life situation is. But he doesn't
[1:12:39] stop there, church. He takes her into
[1:12:41] truth.
[1:12:43] See, the sign is to get her attention,
[1:12:45] but the intention is to get her into
[1:12:47] truth. He doesn't just leave her in
[1:12:49] that. Amen. The proof of Christ being
[1:12:52] revealed is twofold. He does the
[1:12:53] discerning of the thoughts and intents
[1:12:55] of the heart and he takes you into
[1:12:56] truth. That's what Christ does because
[1:12:59] he's the word. Amen. The scripture says
[1:13:01] the word is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:13:03] and intents of the heart. Thy word is
[1:13:06] truth. The two identifications. Okay.
[1:13:08] Let's look at another scripture. Says
[1:13:10] the day following Jesus would go forth
[1:13:12] into Galilee and finds Philip and said
[1:13:14] unto him, follow me. And now Philip was
[1:13:17] of Besa, the city of Andrew and Peter.
[1:13:19] Now Philip findeth Nathaniel, and saith
[1:13:21] unto him, We have found him of whom
[1:13:23] Moses in the law and the prophets did
[1:13:25] write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
[1:13:28] Joseph. And Nathaniel said unto him, Can
[1:13:31] there any good thing come out of
[1:13:33] Nazareth? And Philip saith unto him,
[1:13:35] "Come and see." Nazareth was a bad city
[1:13:38] on the wrong side of the tracks. We'd
[1:13:40] say, Philip said, or Nathaniel says,
[1:13:42] "Are you kidding me? Something good come
[1:13:45] out of Nazareth? The Messiah come out of
[1:13:48] Nazareth?" And what does Philip say?
[1:13:51] Philip doesn't try and convince him. He
[1:13:52] says, "Come and see for yourself,
[1:13:54] church." That's what we're supposed to
[1:13:56] do. I like what Sister Morin says. I'm
[1:13:59] not a saleswoman.
[1:14:01] I'm not here to sell you what I believe.
[1:14:04] All I'm here to do is reflect Christ.
[1:14:07] And if you like what you see, come and
[1:14:10] see for yourself. Because there's one
[1:14:12] thing you can't do, church. You can't
[1:14:14] grow plants by moonlight. And that's are
[1:14:17] we all? are just reflecting Christ's
[1:14:18] light. But to grow, you have to come
[1:14:21] into Christ. And so all I'm trying to do
[1:14:24] as a preacher is not to get you into my
[1:14:26] church, not to get you into my religion,
[1:14:28] not to get you into my beliefs. It's to
[1:14:29] get you to Jesus Christ so he can lead
[1:14:31] you into all truth. So he can bring that
[1:14:34] seed of life to grow inside of you so
[1:14:36] that you can come into an eternity.
[1:14:38] That's all we're trying to do here.
[1:14:40] Amen.
[1:14:42] Now, watch what happens. Nathaniel.
[1:14:45] Philip says, "Nathaniel, just come and
[1:14:47] see. You make up your own mind. I'm not
[1:14:49] going to convince you. I'm just telling
[1:14:50] you it's him." So they come out and it
[1:14:52] says, "And Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to
[1:14:54] him and saith of him, behold an
[1:14:56] Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile."
[1:14:59] So Jesus has never met Nathaniel,
[1:15:01] obviously. But as he's coming up, Jesus
[1:15:03] says, "Look, this is a man with no
[1:15:04] guile." That word means no deceit. In
[1:15:06] other words, this is a man of integrity.
[1:15:09] He's never met Nathaniel before.
[1:15:12] Nathaniel saith unto him whence knowest
[1:15:14] thou me? How do you know me? When did
[1:15:16] you ever meet me Jesus? And Jesus
[1:15:19] answered and said unto him, before that
[1:15:21] Philip called thee. So before Philip
[1:15:24] came to see you, he says when thou were
[1:15:26] when thou was under the fig tree, I saw
[1:15:29] thee. So there was a time before Philip
[1:15:32] ever came to Nathaniel. Philip was
[1:15:34] sitting under a fig tree and chances are
[1:15:36] he was doing something that was special
[1:15:39] to him.
[1:15:40] And Jesus said, "Before Philip ever saw
[1:15:42] you, you were under a fig tree. That's
[1:15:44] when I saw you."
[1:15:47] And Nathaniel answered and said unto
[1:15:49] him, "Rabbi, thou art the son of God.
[1:15:51] Thou art the king of Israel." Wow. He
[1:15:54] tells him one thing. I saw you under a
[1:15:56] tree. And Nathaniel says, "That's it.
[1:15:58] You're him."
[1:16:00] And Jesus commends him for his faith
[1:16:03] because he believed immediately just
[1:16:05] with that one little sign. It says, "And
[1:16:07] Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:16:08] because I said unto thee, I saw thee
[1:16:10] under the fig tree, believest thou,
[1:16:13] church, Jesus always commends faith."
[1:16:17] Remember when the centurion fa centurion
[1:16:19] came and he says, "I've not seen faith
[1:16:21] like this. Yay, in all of Israel, you
[1:16:23] Jews have the full word and you don't
[1:16:25] believe the way that this gentile who
[1:16:27] has no truth has believed." Church,
[1:16:29] that's where we are today.
[1:16:32] That's where we are today. It's the
[1:16:34] faith. Time and time again, he said,
[1:16:36] "Thy faith has healed thee
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; because of thy great faith."
[1:16:43] And so he says to Nathaniel, "Because I
[1:16:46] said, because I told you one thing about
[1:16:48] yourself, you believe me to be the
[1:16:49] Messiah." He says, "What? Thou shalt see
[1:16:52] greater things than these." Hallelujah.
[1:16:54] Why? Because faith drew him to the
[1:16:56] Messiah. He recognized that. Amen. Can
[1:16:58] you imagine having that happen today? I
[1:17:00] don't have that ministry.
[1:17:03] But can you imagine a stranger, Sister
[1:17:04] Nadine, walking in? Can you imagine if
[1:17:06] Sister Nadine walked in and me having
[1:17:08] never met her, never having shook her
[1:17:09] hand, and yet I go to her and I'd say,
[1:17:10] "Hi, I know your name is Nadine. I know
[1:17:12] you come from here. I know you have
[1:17:13] this. I know you have that." Wouldn't
[1:17:14] that be amazing? Sister Nadine, but I
[1:17:17] don't have that ministry. But Jesus has
[1:17:19] that ministry. Jesus has that ministry.
[1:17:22] And we have elements of that. A spirit
[1:17:26] anointed preacher has moments of
[1:17:28] discernment. Absolutely. 100%. Without
[1:17:31] it, he is not a true preacher. I'll say
[1:17:33] it that way. Amen. But that's not I
[1:17:36] don't have open visions. I didn't know
[1:17:39] anything about Sister Nadine until she
[1:17:40] told me about it. One, I'm not a
[1:17:42] prophet. Two, I don't have that gift.
[1:17:46] But can you imagine having that?
[1:17:47] Wouldn't that be an amazing thing to
[1:17:48] see?
[1:17:50] But let me show you something because we
[1:17:52] have seen it. We have heard it today.
[1:17:55] Amen. I'm going to show you in action
[1:17:57] some videos this morning. Amen. And this
[1:17:59] is a real person, a real ministry, a
[1:18:01] real preacher. Amen. It's before the
[1:18:03] internet. It's before wireless
[1:18:05] headphones. It's before you could search
[1:18:07] people up and have face recognition and
[1:18:09] all these things today that allow people
[1:18:11] to bamboozle people.
[1:18:14] Today, I mean, I've looked at so many
[1:18:15] prophets, it's not funny. I I use the
[1:18:17] term loosely, prophets, and they're up
[1:18:19] there and they're telling a person this,
[1:18:21] and they're telling a person that, and
[1:18:22] they're telling a person this, and some
[1:18:23] of it's true, and some of it's not. But
[1:18:24] the thing is, you can look up anybody
[1:18:26] these days and you can find something
[1:18:29] about them on the internet. But God had
[1:18:31] to do this before you could ever look
[1:18:32] people up. Before you could have
[1:18:34] technology in your ear where somebody
[1:18:36] could be telling you about that person
[1:18:37] based on their research, based on what
[1:18:39] the internet says, based on on whatever
[1:18:41] it is that they're looking at. Okay? So,
[1:18:43] I want to show you something. Amen. This
[1:18:45] is when video was barely decent and
[1:18:47] audio and radio were still relatively
[1:18:49] new to things. Okay? So, I'm going to
[1:18:50] play you a clip here. We're talking
[1:18:52] about the Son of Man ministry. We're
[1:18:54] talking about a restoring message. So
[1:18:55] listen to this this morning.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; I'm
[1:19:00] I'm your brother. I This is not
[1:19:03] psychology. I felt that coming into the
[1:19:05] audience. It isn't. It's almighty God.
[1:19:08] See, it's not psychology. No, it isn't.
[1:19:12] Now, don't do that. Just think of being
[1:19:14] the Lord Jesus. See, and one accord.
[1:19:18] Now, sister, I just want to speak with
[1:19:20] you just a moment. We're strangers, I
[1:19:22] suppose. But Jesus Christ knows the both
[1:19:25] of us. This is our first time meeting on
[1:19:28] earth.
[1:19:30] But he knows you and he's fed you all
[1:19:33] your life. And he knows me. And of I,
[1:19:36] your brother,
[1:19:38] and by his grace, by a divine gift that
[1:19:42] I had nothing to do with it coming. When
[1:19:45] I was born a little baby, the first
[1:19:47] thing I can remember was a vision. Now,
[1:19:53] I want you to look this way just a
[1:19:55] moment.
[1:19:57] Of course, you're sick
[1:19:59] and you're suffering with a condition.
[1:20:03] It's a it's a dark spirit around you.
[1:20:05] It's death and it's in a form of cancer.
[1:20:10] And the cancer is located on the breast
[1:20:14] and you're seeing you're examined by
[1:20:17] someone strong and it's a you got a a
[1:20:20] ruptured condition and the rupture is in
[1:20:23] the bowels and you have a stomach
[1:20:27] trouble also a severe heart trouble. It
[1:20:30] caused you fainting of here a few days
[1:20:33] ago you're sitting sideways on the side
[1:20:35] of a bed and nearly passed out looking
[1:20:37] towards your window.
[1:20:43] Are those things the truth?
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; That was all true.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; All true.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Or whatever it was, of course, it's gone
[1:20:49] from him. But what do you think that was
[1:20:53] that knows your lie? Was it Jesus
[1:20:56] Christ? You accept it to be that.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; And I believe that
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; you're willing. You know that something
[1:21:02] supernatural is here. And if you believe
[1:21:05] it to be the Lord Jesus as I have
[1:21:07] preached it out of the word and you
[1:21:09] believe it to be the Lord Jesus.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; I know there's a dark spirit. I see it
[1:21:13] hanging at you yet. It's something very
[1:21:16] serious.
[1:21:17] Say, I see you.
[1:21:21] Your name is uh Eva.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And your last name is York.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; And you live in this city?
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do. And your house number is 6136
[1:21:34] Street. Is that right?
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; You're going home to be well in the name
[1:21:38] of Jesus Christ. May you go and be made
[1:21:41] well. God bless you.
[1:21:45] Notice what he does there. Not
[1:21:48] entertainment.
[1:21:50] It's not a show.
[1:21:53] Humility.
[1:21:55] Simplicity.
[1:21:57] But notice what's happening here. Okay?
[1:21:59] He preaches the word.
[1:22:02] He does not start with this. He finishes
[1:22:03] with this. He preaches the word to that
[1:22:06] group of people there. Maybe a thousand
[1:22:09] people there. We're going to see some
[1:22:10] more clips from this very campaign.
[1:22:13] But what does he do? He preaches the
[1:22:14] word and then he comes back and he says,
[1:22:16] "Lord, confirm your word to the people."
[1:22:20] Because he's preached on divine healing.
[1:22:22] He's preached on deliverance. He's
[1:22:23] preached on Jesus Christ is the same
[1:22:25] yesterday, today, and forever. And then
[1:22:27] he says, "We're going to ask him to
[1:22:29] confirm his word." And that's all he's
[1:22:31] doing here, church. He's confirming his
[1:22:32] word. But notice what he does. He says,
[1:22:34] "This is a gift given to me. I'm your
[1:22:37] brother." Doesn't make himself anything
[1:22:39] special. He says, "This is just a
[1:22:42] calling that I've had." And then he
[1:22:43] tells her what's wrong with her. Not
[1:22:45] once, not twice, not three times, four
[1:22:47] different things. Church, she doesn't
[1:22:48] walk up and give him a prayer card. See,
[1:22:50] Oral Roberts, when he did this, they
[1:22:52] give him a prayer card and he'd read out
[1:22:54] the prayer card, who they were, that
[1:22:55] where they were from, and what was wrong
[1:22:56] with them there. She just comes up to
[1:22:58] him and stands there and everything
[1:23:00] about her life is opened up to him
[1:23:02] relevant to that. What's he doing? He's
[1:23:04] pointing to the presence of Jesus Christ
[1:23:06] in the audience. Amen. And he's trying
[1:23:09] to get them to believe he's the same
[1:23:11] yesterday, today, and forever. He's here
[1:23:13] today as he was 2,000 years ago, except
[1:23:16] it's in the form of the Holy Spirit. But
[1:23:18] what is he doing? He's working through a
[1:23:20] prophet like he promised. Amen. Then
[1:23:22] what does he do, church? He tells her
[1:23:24] who she is. First name, last name, where
[1:23:27] she lives, including her perfect
[1:23:29] address. Having never met her before, he
[1:23:32] says, "Is this true? Is this true? Is
[1:23:34] this true? Is this true?" Never touches
[1:23:36] her, never feels her pulse to see if
[1:23:38] he's going in the right or wrong
[1:23:39] direction the way some of these guys do.
[1:23:41] Just reads it off. And what does he say?
[1:23:43] You notice he says, "I see you sitting
[1:23:45] on the bed." And he's he's going with
[1:23:47] his hand. because he's seen it happen in
[1:23:48] real life. And he says, "I see you
[1:23:50] sitting sideways on the bed and you
[1:23:52] nearly passed out looking towards your
[1:23:54] window. He's in the room where she was
[1:23:56] seeing the event unfold before him just
[1:23:59] the way that Jesus was doing it with the
[1:24:01] woman at the well and with Nathaniel."
[1:24:03] Amen. And we see time and time again,
[1:24:05] Jesus would be at the right place at the
[1:24:08] right time talking to the right person
[1:24:10] and he would speak the truth into that
[1:24:12] person's life. He would show who they
[1:24:14] were. He would show what their condition
[1:24:16] was and he would bring discernment there
[1:24:17] and then he would bring healing or
[1:24:19] deliverance as was needed time and time
[1:24:21] again. Amen. He didn't think make things
[1:24:23] up as he went. He merely reported what
[1:24:26] he saw or what he heard. Amen. Why?
[1:24:28] Because that's all a prophet can do.
[1:24:30] He's just a microphone for God to speak
[1:24:32] through. Amen. So, he's only repeating.
[1:24:35] And that man that I just showed you
[1:24:36] says, "This isn't me.
[1:24:39] That's just my voice. I'm not doing
[1:24:42] this. It's Christ doing this." Amen.
[1:24:44] Jesus Christ was using that man to
[1:24:46] reveal his presence to the audience.
[1:24:49] When Jesus did it, he was a perfect
[1:24:51] witness of the presence of God. Okay? He
[1:24:54] only did what the father told him to do.
[1:24:56] And so we see that's what the prophet
[1:24:58] always does. Us in the five-fold, the
[1:25:01] rest of the five-fold ministry, we get
[1:25:02] things messed up.
[1:25:04] I've seen it, done it, make mistakes,
[1:25:08] interject ourselves into situations,
[1:25:10] presume, god forbid, but we presume.
[1:25:13] Prophets don't do that. They only share
[1:25:16] what they've been shown or told. Okay?
[1:25:18] But when a prophet speaks, "Thus sayeth
[1:25:21] the Lord," that's when he is a faithful
[1:25:23] and true witness because he's not
[1:25:25] putting himself in. He's merely bringing
[1:25:27] exactly what God said. Look at Balam.
[1:25:29] Even though Bale Balam was a false
[1:25:31] prophet, yet he was a true and faithful
[1:25:33] witness because he said, "I can only say
[1:25:35] what God tells me to say. The words that
[1:25:37] he puts in my mouth, that's the words
[1:25:38] I've got to say." A false man, but a
[1:25:42] true prophet.
[1:25:44] See the difference? When he's acting as
[1:25:46] a prophet, he was a faithful and true
[1:25:47] witness even though the vessel was false
[1:25:49] and he ultimately lost his life.
[1:25:52] Revelation 1 says, "And from Jesus
[1:25:54] Christ, who is the faithful witness and
[1:25:57] the first begotten of the dead and the
[1:25:59] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[1:26:00] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:26:03] sins in his own blood." Moses was the
[1:26:05] faithful witness. That's what the
[1:26:06] scripture says. Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:26:08] man, a faithful witness, a prophet. And
[1:26:11] when we come to the church ages, the
[1:26:12] seven church ages to the Gentiles, then
[1:26:15] we come to that final church age, the
[1:26:16] Leysian church age. God says this. He
[1:26:19] says, "And unto the angel of the church
[1:26:20] of the latest." So unto this church age,
[1:26:23] write these words. These things sayeth
[1:26:25] thee, "Amen." Now remember what amen
[1:26:27] means. So be it. In other words, this is
[1:26:30] the fulfillment age of all the promises
[1:26:34] for the Gentiles. He says, "The faithful
[1:26:37] and true witness, the beginning of the
[1:26:40] creation of God." Now, for the sake of
[1:26:41] time, we're not going to go into this
[1:26:43] salutation, but I'll give you the
[1:26:45] principle is that when what's written to
[1:26:47] the salutation or the introduction to
[1:26:49] each church age is the way that Christ
[1:26:51] is revealing himself to that church age.
[1:26:55] So, what he says about himself here is
[1:26:57] how he will reveal himself to that group
[1:26:59] of people. It'll be the attributes.
[1:27:01] It'll be the nature. It'll be the way
[1:27:02] God operates with that particular church
[1:27:04] age. So here in the Leosian church age,
[1:27:06] he says it's the amen. It's I'm going to
[1:27:08] be the so be it. He's the covenant angel
[1:27:11] we see coming down in Revelation 10
[1:27:13] fulfilling the covenant. Then he says
[1:27:16] he'll be the faithful and true witness.
[1:27:18] Well, the only faithful and true witness
[1:27:19] is the son of man ministry. It's the
[1:27:21] prophetic ministry. That's what we've
[1:27:23] seen in the scriptures so far. Amen. So
[1:27:25] we find then that once he introduces
[1:27:27] himself to the church age he carries
[1:27:29] that nature all the way through all the
[1:27:32] way through that. And so the faithful
[1:27:34] and true witness is the character and
[1:27:36] nature of God that's going to be shown
[1:27:38] and acted through the this final church
[1:27:41] age. Amen. So that means he'll operate
[1:27:43] in this church age in a prophetic
[1:27:45] anointing. Now, we hear lots about
[1:27:47] prophetic anointings, but I want you to
[1:27:49] catch something that this is a prophetic
[1:27:51] anointing that is a restorer, not a
[1:27:54] reformer.
[1:27:58] Luther was a reformer. He didn't have
[1:28:00] all the truth. He just had a portion of
[1:28:02] it. Wesley had a little more. The
[1:28:03] Pentecostals had a little more. But this
[1:28:05] is one that's coming back to restore us
[1:28:07] back to what was lost, the original
[1:28:09] faith, which means you have to have the
[1:28:11] original word. And we'll talk more about
[1:28:13] that in the next service, Lord willing.
[1:28:15] But he came and he straightened out all
[1:28:17] of the messes that have been made
[1:28:18] through 2,000 years of denominational
[1:28:20] thinking of the things that men came up
[1:28:22] with and the pump and circumstance and
[1:28:24] the false doctrine and all these
[1:28:26] different things. He cleared these up.
[1:28:27] Amen. But this anointing I want you to
[1:28:29] catch is one of the four beasts that
[1:28:31] surround the throne. Remember, it's a
[1:28:33] lion, an ox, a man, and an eagle. And
[1:28:36] that eagle anointing is the prophetic
[1:28:37] anointing because it rises above
[1:28:39] carnality. It rises above situations. It
[1:28:42] goes into the eternity. It goes far
[1:28:44] above it. And that anointing raises us
[1:28:46] up out of where we are.
[1:28:49] We're not bound by earthly
[1:28:50] circumstances. And it's not just an
[1:28:52] anointing for the prophet. It's the
[1:28:54] anointing of the age cuz it's Christ
[1:28:56] revealing himself to and through that
[1:28:58] age. And so it's an anointing that
[1:29:00] raises us up. Amen. And it's the only
[1:29:02] age that has it because it's the only
[1:29:04] one that goes away without seeing death.
[1:29:06] It's the only rapture age. But I want to
[1:29:09] set the scene here for this final church
[1:29:10] age.
[1:29:12] We have to tie all these scriptures
[1:29:13] together to paint a picture. We're
[1:29:14] talking about that son of man prophetic
[1:29:16] ministry. We've talked about the
[1:29:17] faithful and true witness ministry.
[1:29:19] That's a prophetic ministry. But look at
[1:29:21] how that ministry is revealed now. And
[1:29:23] we can see that by looking at what Jesus
[1:29:25] said in our opening scripture today. And
[1:29:27] he says, "As it was in the days of Noah,
[1:29:30] so shall it be also in the days of the
[1:29:32] son of man." So Jesus speaking here says
[1:29:34] there's a day of the there's days of the
[1:29:36] son of man coming in the future. It was
[1:29:38] the days of the son of man right then
[1:29:40] while he was there in flesh. He says
[1:29:41] there's another revealing by prophet
[1:29:44] that's going to happen in the future.
[1:29:46] Okay, Jesus time in the future. There's
[1:29:49] another revealing of Christ that's going
[1:29:50] to happen. It says in Noah's day they
[1:29:53] ate, they drank, they married wives,
[1:29:54] they were given in marriage until the
[1:29:56] day that Noah entered into the ark and
[1:29:58] the flood came and destroyed them. So
[1:30:00] only eight souls were saved under Noah's
[1:30:02] ministry. But notice how everyone was
[1:30:04] mixing and blending. It was one big
[1:30:06] celebration. It was one big party.
[1:30:08] Everyone was having a good time. But God
[1:30:10] wasn't in it. But the scripture says
[1:30:12] that Noah found grace in the eyes of the
[1:30:15] Lord. Noah was just a humble man. Amen.
[1:30:18] And he had a message that would bring
[1:30:20] them through.
[1:30:22] Only Noah had a message that would bring
[1:30:24] them through. Amen. Everyone else may
[1:30:26] have built boats after hearing Noah's
[1:30:28] message. Just as a backup plan, just as
[1:30:31] insurance, just in case that crazy guy's
[1:30:33] right, let's all build a boat. But you
[1:30:35] notice only Noah's boat lasted. Why?
[1:30:37] Because it was according to his message.
[1:30:40] It's the only one that made it through.
[1:30:42] It was only obedience that could save
[1:30:44] those people from what was coming.
[1:30:46] Obedience to Noah's message. So this son
[1:30:48] of man ministry that's coming that Jesus
[1:30:50] is talking about is like how he revealed
[1:30:53] himself in the days of Noah. How was it?
[1:30:55] A simple man, a humble man with a
[1:30:58] message of escape. And the only way to
[1:31:01] escape is to listen to that message.
[1:31:03] Okay? It's always been that way. People
[1:31:06] preach about elitism. Well, you believe
[1:31:07] you have the truth. Church, if we don't
[1:31:09] believe we have the truth, we shouldn't
[1:31:10] be believing it. It makes no sense to
[1:31:12] believe that you're right and I'm right
[1:31:14] and we believe two thing two things that
[1:31:15] are opposite. It can't be. You can't
[1:31:17] have two opposite things and they both
[1:31:18] be truth. We better believe what we have
[1:31:21] is truth, but we better believe it for
[1:31:22] reason. For scriptural reasons. Amen.
[1:31:25] So, what Noah had was not a popular
[1:31:28] message, but it was still truth.
[1:31:30] Okay? Noah was a faithful and true
[1:31:32] witness. Noah preached that message for
[1:31:35] 120 years and it never changed.
[1:31:39] Moses, what are you going to preach on
[1:31:40] today? Judgment's coming. Build an ark.
[1:31:42] Get out.
[1:31:45] That'd be pretty tiresome. But I'll tell
[1:31:47] you this, those that believe it went
[1:31:49] into action. And it kept them out of
[1:31:51] trouble. It kept them out of trouble
[1:31:53] because they joined in on building the
[1:31:54] ark. Amen. It's not enough to believe
[1:31:56] it. You got to act on it. You've got to
[1:31:59] act on it. He says, "Likewise also as it
[1:32:01] was in the days of Lot, they did eat,
[1:32:03] they drank, they bought, they sold, they
[1:32:05] planted, they builded." Church, there
[1:32:07] was lots of great things happening down
[1:32:08] in Sodom.
[1:32:11] Wealthy, affluent, great lifestyle. It
[1:32:14] meant great time, lots of wealth, ease
[1:32:15] of living. And it seemed like for all
[1:32:17] the evil that they were doing, it was a
[1:32:18] homosexually based society. God was
[1:32:21] going to let it all go. And they were
[1:32:23] just having a grand old time. It says,
[1:32:25] "But the same day that Lot went out of
[1:32:27] Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from
[1:32:29] heaven and destroyed them all." But I
[1:32:32] want you to catch something because it
[1:32:34] says the days of the son of man are
[1:32:36] going to be like the days of the son of
[1:32:37] man here. Now, where was the prophet
[1:32:40] then? Where was the son of man being
[1:32:41] revealed? Because the scriptures
[1:32:43] pointing at Lot and Sodom. But the son
[1:32:46] of man wasn't in Sodom. He was with
[1:32:48] Abraham. Abraham wasn't in Sodom.
[1:32:51] Abraham wasn't in Gomorrah. Amen. He was
[1:32:54] separated. He kept himself away and he
[1:32:57] was sitting on the plains of memory
[1:32:58] believing the word of God.
[1:33:01] He was traveling where God told him to
[1:33:03] travel and he was waiting for God to
[1:33:05] fulfill his promise. Amen. And so the
[1:33:07] world or the Christian world will look
[1:33:09] around and they'll say, "Hey, we're in a
[1:33:11] solemn condition." Look, we're at this
[1:33:13] time. We're fulfilling it. But are you
[1:33:15] fulfilling it the way you're supposed
[1:33:16] to? Because if you're in it,
[1:33:19] that's not where the Son of Man's going
[1:33:20] to be revealed. If you're outside of it,
[1:33:23] that's where the Son of Man's going to
[1:33:24] be revealed. And we'll talk about this
[1:33:25] in just a minute. Amen. But the thing
[1:33:27] is, Lot was in it. But vexed, Abraham
[1:33:32] said, "I'm not going to have anything to
[1:33:33] do with it. I'm going to stay away from
[1:33:35] it." Two totally different things. So,
[1:33:38] are we fulfilling it by being bothered
[1:33:39] by it, or are we fulfilling it by being
[1:33:41] separated from it? Lots of people are
[1:33:43] bothered by what they see, but they
[1:33:45] don't separate out. When it came to the
[1:33:47] days of Lot, where was the Son of Man?
[1:33:49] He wasn't revealing himself to Lot. He
[1:33:51] got two judging angels,
[1:33:54] Oral Roberts and Billy Graham.
[1:33:57] Get out. That was their message. Save
[1:34:00] yourself. Why? Because Lot had left the
[1:34:04] word.
[1:34:05] Lot had left the promise. The promise
[1:34:07] was with Abraham. Lot had gone to what
[1:34:10] he wanted instead of taking what God had
[1:34:12] promised. Lot took the here and now
[1:34:14] instead of the future home.
[1:34:16] See, Abraham searched for a build a city
[1:34:18] whose builder and maker was God. He
[1:34:20] wasn't looking for a kingdom here. He
[1:34:21] was looking for a kingdom to come. Lot
[1:34:23] said, "I'll take what's here." Thank you
[1:34:24] very much, church. Lot was a halfway
[1:34:27] believer. There's no there's no two ways
[1:34:29] about it. And let me say it this way. A
[1:34:31] halfway believer is not a believer.
[1:34:34] They're not. Amen. He believed enough to
[1:34:36] keep his life mostly clean, but not
[1:34:38] enough to stay out of Sodom altogether.
[1:34:41] He chose to live in a place where the
[1:34:43] people and the lifestyles becked his
[1:34:46] soul because it was a better life for
[1:34:49] him.
[1:34:52] How far do we sink?
[1:34:56] Lot got out of fellowship and it dragged
[1:34:59] him into politics.
[1:35:01] Amen. It dragged him into wealth. It
[1:35:03] dragged him into being desensitized
[1:35:05] enough that he could deal with it day in
[1:35:07] and day out.
[1:35:10] church. We are not called to deal with
[1:35:12] it.
[1:35:14] We're called to stay out of it. Amen.
[1:35:18] All of it. So he could have a wealthy
[1:35:20] lifestyle.
[1:35:22] Church, you might think it's not
[1:35:23] affecting you. It does. I'll tell you
[1:35:26] this. It affects your children. It check
[1:35:29] It affects your family. It affects your
[1:35:31] church. Lot wasn't even going to church.
[1:35:35] Lot had separated himself from
[1:35:37] fellowship.
[1:35:38] And look what happened. Parents, you
[1:35:41] might think you can live on the edge.
[1:35:42] Your children can't. Cuz wherever you
[1:35:44] go, they'll go one step beyond it. And
[1:35:47] if you're on the edge, the only place
[1:35:48] they've got to go is over the cliff.
[1:35:49] Amen. Don't sacrifice your children for
[1:35:51] a lifestyle.
[1:35:53] Don't sacrifice yourself for a
[1:35:55] lifestyle. We'll see. Lot in the end
[1:35:58] came to nothing. Amen.
[1:36:01] I know I'm teaching today. Can I be your
[1:36:03] pastor for a moment?
[1:36:05] I'm seeing way too many people coming
[1:36:07] and talking to me, coming and visiting
[1:36:09] with me. I go someplace in the middle of
[1:36:11] nowhere and I meet up with a believer
[1:36:13] and they are more than happy to stay
[1:36:15] right where they are. No fellowship, no
[1:36:17] church, no body, no support, no
[1:36:20] leadership, no correction.
[1:36:24] And they're so blas about it. So blasé
[1:36:27] about it. I can't I can't fathom in this
[1:36:29] last age how we can as a believer live
[1:36:32] someplace where there is no other
[1:36:34] believers and say we're in the will of
[1:36:35] God. I don't understand it, church. I
[1:36:39] don't understand it. I'll be honest.
[1:36:40] Amen. They don't fellowship. They don't
[1:36:42] want to be a part of the body. The
[1:36:43] scripture says the love of many shall
[1:36:45] wax cold. And what are they left with,
[1:36:47] church? There's no zeal. There's just
[1:36:49] knowledge. I know the truth. Therefore,
[1:36:51] I am a believer. Therefore, I'm going in
[1:36:52] the rapture. No, you are not because
[1:36:54] you're not being led by the spirit. So
[1:36:56] listen to brother Luke Gibson the other
[1:36:57] day just short clip. He says the Holy
[1:36:59] Ghost loves to be in church. Amen.
[1:37:03] That's for sure. The scripture says that
[1:37:05] the city and what it lived its lifestyle
[1:37:09] vexed Lot. In other words, it bothered
[1:37:12] him. But we can see that he put up with
[1:37:14] it by choice because he liked what he
[1:37:16] got from living in that place.
[1:37:19] I'll tell you what, Lot's daughters paid
[1:37:21] a price. Do you know Lot's daughters
[1:37:24] married worldly men?
[1:37:28] You're thinking of the other two when
[1:37:29] you say I'm wrong there. Lot had
[1:37:31] daughters. They married men of Sodom.
[1:37:34] And when those angels came, they refused
[1:37:36] to leave and they died in judgment.
[1:37:39] Lot left with his wife and two other
[1:37:41] daughters that were single. And as they
[1:37:44] went out, the wife was so attached to
[1:37:46] what she left behind, she turned around.
[1:37:48] She was turned into a pillar of salt.
[1:37:49] Died right there. Then what happened
[1:37:51] after that? Lot goes up. He refuses to
[1:37:54] go back to civilization, scared they're
[1:37:56] going to kill him. So he lives in a cave
[1:37:58] with his two single daughters. They get
[1:37:59] him drunk, perform incest, and get
[1:38:03] pregnant by their own father.
[1:38:07] I don't think Lot saw that coming,
[1:38:09] church.
[1:38:10] But there were signs. And the sign was
[1:38:13] he separated himself from fellowship. He
[1:38:16] separated himself from the word. He
[1:38:18] chose lifestyle
[1:38:21] over a future home.
[1:38:25] Ammon and Moab were the two children
[1:38:27] that came out of Lot's daughters.
[1:38:29] Incestrous relationship, messed up, and
[1:38:32] they were a thorn in the side of the
[1:38:33] true children of Abraham for centuries
[1:38:37] after that.
[1:38:39] Completely gone into idol worship.
[1:38:43] That's what came out of Lot's decision.
[1:38:45] church, you telling me he saw that when
[1:38:46] he went down to the wellwatered plains?
[1:38:48] Mm- He just thought he was doing what
[1:38:50] was best for him and it wasn't. It
[1:38:53] backfired on him. But where was the Son
[1:38:56] of Man revealing?
[1:38:58] That's a warning.
[1:39:00] Make your choice.
[1:39:03] Out on the plains of Mamry, old Abraham,
[1:39:05] church, 99 years old, old Abraham is
[1:39:09] sitting out in the heat of the day.
[1:39:12] And what's he doing?
[1:39:16] believing,
[1:39:19] obeying,
[1:39:21] waiting
[1:39:23] faithfully.
[1:39:24] It's all he's doing. He's sitting in a
[1:39:27] tent and he sees three people coming
[1:39:28] towards him.
[1:39:31] And he gets up and he recognizes one of
[1:39:34] them because he calls him Lord.
[1:39:37] He calls him Lord.
[1:39:40] And he comes down and he starts to talk
[1:39:41] to him.
[1:39:44] And this is now the son of man. It is
[1:39:47] God in flesh speaking to his faithful
[1:39:51] servant. And he reveals himself. But how
[1:39:53] does he reveal himself? Because Jesus
[1:39:55] said the way he revealed himself then is
[1:39:56] the way he's going to reveal himself in
[1:39:58] the future. He's saying as I did it in
[1:40:00] Abraham's day, I'm going to do it in the
[1:40:02] final day. Now watch. I'm going to read
[1:40:05] this because I'm trying to show you a
[1:40:07] pattern so we can fit the ministry to
[1:40:08] it. So these three men are sitting there
[1:40:11] and Abraham says, "Hey, come in. let's
[1:40:12] have a meal. And he he kills a calf and
[1:40:14] he bakes he's baking bread. He says,
[1:40:16] "Hey, sit down. Take a load off." And so
[1:40:19] they said unto him, "Where's Sarah thy
[1:40:20] wife?" He says, "Behold, she's in the
[1:40:22] tent." So the tent was behind where they
[1:40:24] were sitting. She's in there. She's
[1:40:25] screened off from their view.
[1:40:28] And he said, So this is the Lord said,
[1:40:30] "I will certainly return unto thee
[1:40:32] according to the time of life. And lo,
[1:40:35] Sarah, thy wife shall have a son." And
[1:40:37] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:40:40] was behind him. So she's behind him.
[1:40:42] She's behind the clothes the the the the
[1:40:43] the cloth of the door.
[1:40:46] He says, "Now Abraham and Sarah were old
[1:40:48] and well stricken in age and it ceased
[1:40:49] to be with Sarah after the man of
[1:40:51] women." So God comes down as a son of
[1:40:53] man in flesh. identifies who they are.
[1:40:57] Now church, he calls them Abraham and
[1:40:58] Sarah.
[1:41:00] How does he know their name? Their name
[1:41:03] was Abram and Sarai to everyone else for
[1:41:06] for decades. And then God came down and
[1:41:09] he changed their name to Abraham and
[1:41:11] Sarah. How does a stranger know their
[1:41:12] name? Because he gave them their name.
[1:41:15] He identifies them by name. And then he
[1:41:18] says, "I'm What's the sign to do,
[1:41:20] church? To point you to the promised
[1:41:23] word." He didn't just identify himself.
[1:41:25] He says, "I'm here to fulfill the word."
[1:41:27] The covenant angel coming down again.
[1:41:29] Okay? It says, "Now Sarah laughed within
[1:41:32] herself."
[1:41:34] Sorry, let me read that again. Now
[1:41:36] Abraham and Sarah were old and
[1:41:37] wellstricken in age, and it ceased to be
[1:41:38] with Sarah after the men and women. In
[1:41:40] other words, she couldn't have children.
[1:41:41] She could never have children, but the
[1:41:43] her body functions were completely gone.
[1:41:45] She was way past menopause. Okay. It
[1:41:48] says, "Therefore Sarah laughed within
[1:41:50] herself, saying, after I am waxed old,
[1:41:52] shall I have pleasure? My lord being old
[1:41:54] also. Abraham's old, I'm old. We don't
[1:41:56] do those things anymore." And she
[1:41:58] laughed internally. Okay? She laughed
[1:42:00] within herself. So, this is an inward
[1:42:02] chuckle. No sounds making. And then she
[1:42:05] thinks, "Am I going to have relationship
[1:42:07] with my with my husband again?" Ha,
[1:42:10] whatever.
[1:42:11] But it's all internal, no word spoken.
[1:42:14] And the Lord said unto Abraham, why did
[1:42:17] Sarah laugh, saying, "Shall I have a
[1:42:18] cert bear child which I'm old? Is
[1:42:21] anything too hard for the Lord?
[1:42:24] At the time appointed, I will return
[1:42:26] unto thee according to the time of life,
[1:42:27] and Sarah shall have a son." He says,
[1:42:28] "Why'd Sarah laugh back there? And why
[1:42:30] is she saying she won't have a son?" And
[1:42:33] Sarah denied, saying, "I laughed not,
[1:42:36] for she was afraid." I didn't laugh,
[1:42:40] but she laughed in her heart. And the
[1:42:42] word is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:42:44] intents of the heart.
[1:42:47] It says she was afraid. Why? Because she
[1:42:49] recognized who was who that was. I just
[1:42:52] laughed at the son of man.
[1:42:55] I just laughed at God in flesh.
[1:42:58] God doesn't like to be laughed at.
[1:43:01] Our prophet said he'd have struck her
[1:43:02] dead except she was a part of Abraham.
[1:43:05] It's the same reason he doesn't strike
[1:43:06] us dead because we're a part of him.
[1:43:10] He says, "And he said, nay, but thou did
[1:43:12] slap." He says, "Oh, yes you did. You
[1:43:15] know it and I know it. Don't lie to me."
[1:43:18] But what is this is what is supposed to
[1:43:20] happen on our day because it's the same
[1:43:22] as what happened in the days of Lot and
[1:43:24] the days of Sodom and Gomorrah. Our
[1:43:25] church church, we're not looking at
[1:43:27] Sodom. That just tells us what time it
[1:43:29] is. But we're not looking into Sodom.
[1:43:31] Amen. where our sight is on the Lord
[1:43:33] coming and fulfilling his promised word
[1:43:35] and we're believing that promise. Amen.
[1:43:37] We've seen it and we've heard it in our
[1:43:39] day. So, I'm going to play a second clip
[1:43:41] here to show you this is exactly what
[1:43:43] we've seen in this day. Okay?
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; I know now that seeing you, you are
[1:43:49] becoming a younglook person,
[1:43:52] much younger than what you are in my
[1:43:54] presence.
[1:43:56] you are suffering with some sort of a
[1:43:59] headaches
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; and it's um it's come many years ago
[1:44:04] about 25 years ago your headache started
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; and it's been bothering you ever since
[1:44:10] you have been a great believer and you
[1:44:13] have you have prayed for this hour
[1:44:15] that's standing here now you've said in
[1:44:18] prayer to God that if you could only get
[1:44:22] to me that if I would pray that your
[1:44:25] headaches would cease.
[1:44:30] Those things true.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Everything
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; that is true.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Now you heard what said that that wasn't
[1:44:36] me. That was just my voice. Was those
[1:44:40] ever what it was is something I remember
[1:44:42] seeing a young person or something. Was
[1:44:44] it just the way it was said? There
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; James just the way it was said. Now you
[1:44:48] believe that God did it. You believe
[1:44:49] God. Now
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; you're sure that God is here. Just a
[1:44:55] moment. I see something else. A young
[1:44:58] woman seems to be standing near you.
[1:45:01] It's a It's a daughter and um Yes. You
[1:45:06] was just fixing to go on a trip
[1:45:07] somewhere. You were going to see her and
[1:45:09] she's from Indiana. Richmond, Indiana is
[1:45:13] where she lives. and she her husband is
[1:45:15] a minister and she has wrote you a
[1:45:18] letter or something telling you not to
[1:45:20] come because I was coming here. Is that
[1:45:23] right? You're healed. You can go on.
[1:45:27] God bless you.
[1:45:31] That's in front of maybe a thousand
[1:45:33] people. Notice he's standing off from
[1:45:35] her, not touching her, not reading her
[1:45:37] body signals, nothing like that. And
[1:45:39] what does he do? He tells her what her
[1:45:40] problem is and how she got it. He says
[1:45:43] it's been 25 years and you got this
[1:45:45] headache from when you struck your head
[1:45:46] in an accident. He's seen the accident
[1:45:49] 25 years ago. He says, "And you've been
[1:45:51] waiting 25 years to have be prayed for
[1:45:53] and have it healed."
[1:45:56] Joseph waited 13. Moses waited 40. David
[1:46:00] waited 15. Church, your day is coming.
[1:46:03] Amen. Your day is coming. But what is he
[1:46:06] doing? He's relaying what he sees. He
[1:46:08] sees the accident happening. He sees
[1:46:10] what she's gone through. But notice he's
[1:46:12] not just seen her. Then he says, "I see
[1:46:14] someone standing near you." Oh, it's
[1:46:16] your daughter. And what she did is she
[1:46:18] wrote a letter. Oh, by the way, she's
[1:46:20] from Richmond, Indiana. She's married to
[1:46:22] a preacher. This has nothing to do with
[1:46:23] what a prayer card would ever say,
[1:46:25] church. He's going and he's saying, "The
[1:46:26] reason you're here is because you are
[1:46:28] going to go on a trip and your daughter
[1:46:31] found out I was going to be here, sent
[1:46:33] you a letter and said, "Don't go on the
[1:46:35] trip because he's going to be right
[1:46:36] where you are. Come and get prayed for
[1:46:38] him right there." He says, "Is that the
[1:46:39] truth?" She says, "That's the truth."
[1:46:40] Boom. done
[1:46:44] and he's seen it all happen in real
[1:46:46] time. It's an open vision ministry all
[1:46:48] over again. Tells her all these things.
[1:46:51] Why, church? He says, "That wasn't me.
[1:46:53] That was my voice." He says, "What did
[1:46:54] he tell you?" Because it's Christ
[1:46:56] speaking through that man. That's the
[1:46:58] gift he had was to allow God to speak
[1:46:59] through him to where he wouldn't
[1:47:01] interject anything. He says, "I thought
[1:47:02] I I thought he said something about a a
[1:47:05] young a young woman, a young child. Is
[1:47:07] everything he said true?" He's so
[1:47:09] unaware of what's happening because he's
[1:47:10] yielded himself to Christ.
[1:47:13] That's what's happening. It's the son of
[1:47:14] man ministry being revealed. Amen. We're
[1:47:17] not looking at that man. We're looking
[1:47:19] at the Christ that's using the man
[1:47:22] because the it's a it's not here to
[1:47:24] prove the man. It's here to prove the
[1:47:25] Christ that's using him. Amen. Because
[1:47:28] the scripture said he was going to do it
[1:47:30] in this age. And so what are we doing?
[1:47:32] We're taking that ministry and we're
[1:47:34] we're looking through the filter of the
[1:47:36] scripture and we're applying it against
[1:47:37] that and we're saying, "Is that what he
[1:47:38] said he was going to do?" Yes, that's
[1:47:40] exactly what he said he was going to do.
[1:47:42] I mean, church, he did this thousands
[1:47:44] upon thousands of times and never once
[1:47:47] was it wrong. Let me say this. There's a
[1:47:49] story of a woman who went up there and
[1:47:50] he told her her address and her friend,
[1:47:52] her acquaintance was sitting in the
[1:47:53] audience. She went to her afterwards and
[1:47:55] she said, "You told that man that you
[1:47:56] live at that place and you don't live at
[1:47:58] that place. I know where you live." She
[1:47:59] said, "No, I moved last week. I just
[1:48:01] hadn't told you.
[1:48:03] A young girl had eyes put into empty
[1:48:06] sockets
[1:48:07] and I believe they went in as brown and
[1:48:09] then she said, "I would really like blue
[1:48:11] eyes." And he said, "Lord, would you
[1:48:12] change it to blue?" And they changed to
[1:48:14] blue in real time.
[1:48:18] Time and time again, church, I listen to
[1:48:21] there's there's thousands of hours of
[1:48:23] audio and video of him doing this over
[1:48:27] and over and over again. Never wrong.
[1:48:30] Never wrong.
[1:48:32] Why? Because it's the son of man
[1:48:34] ministry. It's Christ that's doing it.
[1:48:36] It's not the man that's doing it. Amen.
[1:48:39] But listen, he's not just coming back to
[1:48:41] discern thoughts and intents. See,
[1:48:43] that's what everybody wants. They want
[1:48:44] the supernatural. But he's coming back
[1:48:46] to what? Restore us back to the word
[1:48:50] because that's what's going to cleanse
[1:48:51] us. That's what's going to change us.
[1:48:52] That's what's going to take us into a
[1:48:54] resurrection and rapture. Amen. These
[1:48:56] people had great experiences.
[1:48:58] They went home healed. But guess what,
[1:49:00] church?
[1:49:01] All of them got sick again at some point
[1:49:02] of something and all of them died. It
[1:49:05] was just an experience. But his message
[1:49:08] had to follow that to bring us into a
[1:49:10] rapturing condition, a rapturing faith.
[1:49:12] Amen. Jesus would do it time and time
[1:49:15] again. Discern what's going on. He would
[1:49:16] know their thoughts. He would see into
[1:49:18] their souls. He would know what they
[1:49:19] were thinking. Amen. That's the sign of
[1:49:20] the son of man. That's the hallmark of
[1:49:22] the presence of Jesus Christ because the
[1:49:25] word says that the word is a discerner
[1:49:27] of the thoughts and intents of the
[1:49:28] heart. But that's the sign that he's
[1:49:30] there. But that is not his message. See,
[1:49:33] too many people are focused on the signs
[1:49:35] and wonders, the gifts. Amen. But the
[1:49:38] focus has to be on the message that he
[1:49:39] would bring. But he would go through and
[1:49:41] there's this is again there there's tons
[1:49:43] of records of it and there's audio of it
[1:49:45] and all these video and these things and
[1:49:46] he would be in a place he's never been
[1:49:48] before and the audience is sitting there
[1:49:50] and he'd start on the left and he'd go
[1:49:51] bang bang bang bang bang bang bang and
[1:49:53] just talk to each person. Here's who you
[1:49:55] are. Here's what you have. Here's what
[1:49:56] you are. Here's what you have. And he'd
[1:49:57] just go through there back and forth
[1:49:59] across the audience.
[1:50:01] No prayer cards, no coming up close to
[1:50:04] him. Just call them out from there. What
[1:50:06] was it? God trying to catch our
[1:50:07] attention. Just trying to catch our
[1:50:09] attention. Okay, listen to this. I want
[1:50:13] you to catch something. Remember that
[1:50:14] woman that had a she she was always
[1:50:16] hemorrhaging. She had an issue of blood.
[1:50:17] I think it was 12 years. Spent all her
[1:50:19] money on doctors. They'd only made it
[1:50:20] worse. And she said, "If I can but touch
[1:50:22] the hem of Jesus garment, I'll be made
[1:50:25] well." Okay, now watch this. He's been
[1:50:27] up here and he's had these people come
[1:50:28] up. These are the people that have
[1:50:29] prayer cards. People that were given a a
[1:50:31] special opportunity to come up and be
[1:50:33] prayed for directly and talk to
[1:50:34] directly. But now watch what's happening
[1:50:36] because remember it's not about the man.
[1:50:38] It's about Christ. So catch this next
[1:50:40] one. Okay. So now he looks out across
[1:50:42] the audience and he starts to speak to
[1:50:44] the audience. Now, now listen to this.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Always ready to help and to believe to
[1:50:49] help the people in need. Just a moment.
[1:50:52] The lady
[1:50:54] now I see the Holy Spirit standing in
[1:50:57] the corner.
[1:50:59] It's uh over a colored lady. She's
[1:51:02] looking this way. She has been and she's
[1:51:05] praying. She has a growth and that
[1:51:08] growth is in her throat.
[1:51:11] She's got her hand up. You accept your
[1:51:13] healing lady?
[1:51:16] The lady sitting right behind you there
[1:51:19] also. She has a growth in his in her
[1:51:21] shoulder. Is that right, lady? Both of
[1:51:24] you, stand on your feet right now. The
[1:51:25] two ladies right there with the growth
[1:51:27] on the two-color lady. Jesus Christ
[1:51:30] healed you both, you can go home and be
[1:51:32] made well for God's glory. Your faith
[1:51:34] has healed you. Remember, what does God
[1:51:37] respond to? Faith. The woman said, "If I
[1:51:41] can but touch his garment, the hem of
[1:51:43] his garment, I'll be made well." That's
[1:51:44] her faith was, "If I can touch him, I'll
[1:51:46] be healed." And what's he trying to do?
[1:51:48] He's trying to get the people to
[1:51:49] believe. And those women are sitting
[1:51:50] there and they're believing. And he
[1:51:52] says, "I can see the Holy Spirit, that
[1:51:54] pillar of fire." He says, "And it's
[1:51:56] right above them." And what does it do?
[1:51:57] It starts to tell them where they are,
[1:51:59] what their problem is. He says, "You got
[1:52:00] a growth here. You got a growth here.
[1:52:02] Oh, the one next to you has it as well.
[1:52:04] Both of you stand up. You're healed in
[1:52:05] Jesus name. Your faith has made you
[1:52:07] well."
[1:52:09] See, he's trying to get it off of him
[1:52:10] and into our laps.
[1:52:13] The goal is not to have us believe in a
[1:52:14] prophet. The goal is to get us to
[1:52:15] believe Jesus Christ.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. so that he can do a work in our
[1:52:19] lives individually. But remember, you
[1:52:21] saw there he had a woman and a child
[1:52:22] there. And I'm going to play this. This
[1:52:23] will be the last clip before we close
[1:52:25] tonight. But I want you to catch the
[1:52:27] seriousness of this. When he says what
[1:52:28] that child has, I want you to catch the
[1:52:30] audience reaction
[1:52:32] going to happen.
[1:52:37] How do you do lady?
[1:52:39] [Music]
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Do you believe me to be God's prophet?
[1:52:45] Is I mean, well, a prophet is a
[1:52:47] preacher.
[1:52:48] You don't expect me to be of the enemy.
[1:52:51] You expect me to be of God. Is that's
[1:52:52] the way you accept it? Well, then I can
[1:52:55] help you. Or he told me if I would get
[1:52:57] the people to believe me and be sincere
[1:52:59] when I prayed that nothing would stand
[1:53:02] before the prayer. And now it isn't
[1:53:06] I that helps. It's God that does the
[1:53:09] healing. I question. I said they won't
[1:53:12] believe me. He said, "There'll be two
[1:53:14] signs given to you as was to the prophet
[1:53:17] Moses. In this the people will believe,
[1:53:20] and one of them was to reveal the
[1:53:22] secrets of the hearts of the people to
[1:53:24] them." Now, you're not here for
[1:53:27] yourself. Although you're nervous and
[1:53:29] run down, but it's been caused by a
[1:53:31] disease of this child. This child here
[1:53:34] is suffering. It's been turned down by
[1:53:36] the doctors to die. It's leukemia.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? You've brought the
[1:53:42] child from out of town. You've traveled
[1:53:45] coming from the west coming east. You
[1:53:49] have come. You've come from a a state
[1:53:52] that has mountains. It's Pennsylvania.
[1:53:55] And your city, I believe it's
[1:53:56] Chambersburg. Isn't that right?
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Bring the child to me. Little sister,
[1:54:01] dear, the Lord Jesus was here. He'd lay
[1:54:05] his hands up on you and death would
[1:54:08] leave you and you'd live. Do you believe
[1:54:10] that I am his servant?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Then in hisstead I lay my hands on this
[1:54:15] child and bless it and ask that the
[1:54:20] demon leaves the child and that life
[1:54:23] comes to the child and it will live and
[1:54:25] be well. Come out of the child, Satan.
[1:54:29] By the authority of God's Bible with a
[1:54:31] divine gift ministered by an angel, I
[1:54:34] adure thee to leave the child. Come from
[1:54:37] the Lord.
[1:54:39] You leave your get well. God bless you.
[1:54:42] Turn around. Wave to the audience.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; God bless you. The little girl with
[1:54:46] tremendous.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Now you say she didn't get healed. She
[1:54:52] got healed.
[1:54:54] Time and time again. Like I said, I've
[1:54:57] got thousands. I spent hours and hours
[1:54:58] this week listening, watching,
[1:55:00] listening, watching, learning how to
[1:55:02] clip things. Finally going to Chat GPT
[1:55:05] to do it for me.
[1:55:08] But time and time and time again, he
[1:55:10] went around the world seven times with a
[1:55:12] healing ministry. Remember what the
[1:55:14] scripture said, the son of righteousness
[1:55:16] will rise with healing in his wings.
[1:55:19] Many ran around seven times in South
[1:55:20] Africa alone. One set of meetings, they
[1:55:22] took seven dump trucks of crutches and
[1:55:25] wheelchairs and other things out of
[1:55:27] those meetings that he had there. Seven
[1:55:29] dump trucks full. Church, people don't
[1:55:31] give it up because it because they're
[1:55:33] not healed.
[1:55:35] If you can walk, that's when you give up
[1:55:36] your crutches and your your wheelchair.
[1:55:38] You don't go and throw it away because
[1:55:40] you believe you're healed. You go
[1:55:41] because you are healed. Amen. You know
[1:55:43] what happened in India? He had that man
[1:55:45] that worshiped the sun and he was blind
[1:55:46] because they they stare at the sun with
[1:55:48] open eyes. And he said, "Listen, can any
[1:55:51] of you heal this man? I'm going to
[1:55:52] challenge you all. All of your
[1:55:54] religions, this man, can you heal him?"
[1:55:56] Nobody came up. He says, "If he'll be
[1:55:58] healed in the name of Jesus Christ, will
[1:56:00] you give your hearts to God?" And he
[1:56:02] laid hands on him. That man's eyes came
[1:56:04] open. He went around. He went to the
[1:56:05] mayor of the city. All these different
[1:56:07] ones completely healed. If I'm not
[1:56:08] mistaken, that was the same meetings
[1:56:10] where a crippled dog was walking across
[1:56:11] when he was praying for somebody and the
[1:56:13] leg was instantly healed and he started
[1:56:14] walking normally.
[1:56:17] See where the spirit of the Lord is.
[1:56:20] There's freedom.
[1:56:24] But did you notice she had leukemia? And
[1:56:26] when she he said leukemia, did you hear
[1:56:27] that gasp that went up in the crowd?
[1:56:30] See, some of that back then they could
[1:56:31] do surgery for some cancers, things that
[1:56:33] were tumorous and those things like
[1:56:34] that. Leukemia, you can't do that. And
[1:56:37] they knew it was a death sentence for
[1:56:38] that little girl. But remember what
[1:56:40] happened. The angel said, "If you can
[1:56:41] get the people to believe, nothing will
[1:56:44] stand before your prayer, not even
[1:56:47] cancer." And we've seen it, haven't we?
[1:56:49] We've seen it with Sister Betty. We've
[1:56:50] seen with Brother Bob. We've seen it
[1:56:52] with my sister Elena, her testimony,
[1:56:53] leaning on the everlasting arms. Look it
[1:56:55] up on YouTube if you haven't. In nine
[1:56:57] weeks, she went from death to life.
[1:57:01] Completely healed. Nothing. No sign, no
[1:57:04] trace of cancer in her. The doctors
[1:57:05] thought she would die within a couple of
[1:57:07] weeks. Totally healed. Brother Brandham
[1:57:11] didn't pray for her. Who prayed for her?
[1:57:14] Five-fold ministry. Why? Because we
[1:57:16] believe in divine healing. Why? Because
[1:57:18] the son of man ministry came and showed
[1:57:19] us it was still available. Amen. That's
[1:57:22] what we had time and time again. Amen.
[1:57:27] God sent us an end time prophet
[1:57:29] according to his word to fulfill these
[1:57:30] scriptures.
[1:57:32] And this is him. This is William Brham.
[1:57:36] Amen. He was from Kentucky, born to a
[1:57:38] poor family, an alcoholic father,
[1:57:41] uneducated, basically had a six-year
[1:57:44] education, just barely finished sixth
[1:57:46] grade. But God called him from birth by
[1:57:48] a sign. When he was born, a star came
[1:57:51] into the room and hovered over the bed.
[1:57:53] He was raised in a Baptist church of all
[1:57:55] things
[1:57:57] and he separated from the church when
[1:57:59] God started working for him and he went
[1:58:00] his own way. And remember he was
[1:58:02] commissioned with a healing ministry
[1:58:04] that would foreer the second coming of
[1:58:06] Christ. And in 1933
[1:58:08] he was baptizing on the Ohio River. And
[1:58:11] what happened is a supernatural light
[1:58:13] came down publicly
[1:58:15] and said, "As John the Baptist foreer
[1:58:18] the first coming of Christ, your
[1:58:19] message, your message, not you, your
[1:58:22] message will forrun the second coming of
[1:58:24] Christ." And the newspapers printed it.
[1:58:26] People heard it. It was like when Paul
[1:58:28] had his his experience on the road to
[1:58:30] Damascus. Everyone saw the light. Some
[1:58:33] heard a voice, some heard a sound, some
[1:58:36] didn't know what happened. And it was
[1:58:37] the exact same thing that happened to
[1:58:39] him. And what was it? Like I said, it
[1:58:41] was the son of righteousness rising with
[1:58:43] healing in his wings. Remember what
[1:58:45] Peter said? He said when he was
[1:58:46] preaching on the day of Pentecost, he
[1:58:49] said, "Ye men of Israel, hear these
[1:58:50] words, Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved
[1:58:53] of God among you by miracles and wonders
[1:58:56] and signs which God did by him in the
[1:58:59] midst of you, as ye yourselves know."
[1:59:02] What did he do, church? Why am I showing
[1:59:04] you this today?
[1:59:06] I've never done this before.
[1:59:09] I'm showing you the revealing of the son
[1:59:11] of man ministry.
[1:59:13] This man is just I say use just it's not
[1:59:16] just he's a word prophet
[1:59:19] but Christ was using him to reveal
[1:59:22] himself one last time and he performed
[1:59:24] the same signs the same wonders raising
[1:59:27] from the dead healing of the sick
[1:59:28] casting out of demons discernment of the
[1:59:30] thoughts and intents of the heart. He
[1:59:32] would have uh personal um uh interviews
[1:59:36] with people
[1:59:38] And he would write down before they ever
[1:59:40] came in. All he would know was their
[1:59:42] name. And this the Holy Spirit would
[1:59:44] tell him what was going to happen and
[1:59:45] what they needed to do. He would write
[1:59:46] it down, put it in a sealed envelope and
[1:59:48] lay it on the table before they ever
[1:59:50] came in. They would tell him all the
[1:59:51] story, tell him all the things. And then
[1:59:53] he would say, "Open the letter and read
[1:59:54] out what's there." And it would say
[1:59:56] everything they told him, including
[1:59:57] correcting the things that they hadn't
[1:59:59] told him.
[2:00:01] What was it? It was Christ revealing
[2:00:03] himself and saying, "Hey, I'm here. I'm
[2:00:06] real. I'm alive. We're not serving a
[2:00:10] dead man. We're not serving a theology.
[2:00:12] We're not serving an idea. But there is
[2:00:14] a living Christ that is here to confirm
[2:00:17] his word to those that will believe.
[2:00:21] Amen. Let's stand together.
[2:00:24] Amen. I've just shown you the signs and
[2:00:26] wonders, and that's just a small portion
[2:00:30] what I could readily get my hands on and
[2:00:31] and download and clip together in these
[2:00:33] different things. But remember, signs
[2:00:35] and wonders are just the bait on the
[2:00:36] hook. Signs and wonders never saved
[2:00:39] anybody. Israel lived under signs and
[2:00:41] wonders, and only two went in. But it's
[2:00:44] there to catch the people's attention. A
[2:00:46] sign is pointing you to something or
[2:00:48] somewhere. And that's all that this was.
[2:00:50] Amen. But notice what Jesus did.
[2:00:53] Amen. When Jesus was there, and what's
[2:00:56] he doing? He's doing the very same thing
[2:01:00] where he's just preaching a general
[2:01:02] gospel. Jesus didn't start out with deep
[2:01:06] mysteries.
[2:01:07] He went around preaching healing. He
[2:01:10] went around preaching deliverance. He
[2:01:11] went around preaching that the day of
[2:01:13] liberty is here. Remember he preached
[2:01:15] from Isaiah and he says, "This day the
[2:01:17] scriptures fulfilled came to set the
[2:01:18] prisoners free, the captives free and
[2:01:20] these different things." But then what
[2:01:22] happened after a while once he caught
[2:01:24] the attention? What did he start to do?
[2:01:26] He started to preach revealed truth. He
[2:01:28] started to show them the depths of what
[2:01:30] they had been taught but had never
[2:01:32] grasped. Amen. And what happened when he
[2:01:34] started to preach the full truth. People
[2:01:37] started to leave.
[2:01:39] People started to leave. And he said,
[2:01:41] "Why?" Because you were here for the
[2:01:42] loaves and the fishes. You were here for
[2:01:44] the signs and the wonders. You were here
[2:01:45] for the healings. You were here for the
[2:01:46] good times. You were here for the
[2:01:48] emotions. And we love all that. We love
[2:01:50] all that. Amen. But what happened when
[2:01:53] the word came is they wanted to stay in
[2:01:55] their traditions. They wanted to stay in
[2:01:56] their comforts. They wanted to stay with
[2:01:58] the rest of the crowd.
[2:02:00] Only a few of them left. And then he
[2:02:02] went to the disciples, if you remember,
[2:02:04] and he said unto them, "Are will you
[2:02:06] leave me also?" And what did Peter say?
[2:02:09] Did Peter say, "Lord, no, we can't leave
[2:02:11] you because we saw the fishes and the
[2:02:13] loaves and we saw the healings and we
[2:02:14] saw the demons cast out and we saw the
[2:02:17] waves stilled." Peter didn't say that.
[2:02:20] He said, "Where else can we go? Thou
[2:02:24] hast the words of life.
[2:02:28] It was the word he was preaching that
[2:02:30] they were latched on to, not just the
[2:02:32] signs and wonders. That's why people run
[2:02:34] around following this gift and this
[2:02:36] ministry and that. They're looking for
[2:02:37] the latest and greatest rather than
[2:02:38] anchoring themselves in the word. But so
[2:02:41] we know what has to follow for a son of
[2:02:43] man ministry is it leads with signs and
[2:02:45] wonders to catch the attention of the
[2:02:46] people. But it's to bring them into
[2:02:48] truth. And that's what we've been
[2:02:51] preaching about for all this is to bring
[2:02:53] the people into the revealed truth that
[2:02:55] have been lost since the days of Paul
[2:02:57] because of what's happened. Amen. Our
[2:02:59] anchor is not in the emotions.
[2:03:02] Amen. Our anchor is not in the feelings.
[2:03:05] It's not in the hooping, the hollering,
[2:03:07] the shouting, the wonderful prayers,
[2:03:10] the wonderful praises. Our anchor is
[2:03:13] that his word is true and he sent it to
[2:03:17] me and I'm going to stay with it until
[2:03:20] he fulfills what he promised. Amen.
[2:03:22] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our
[2:03:24] heads. Heavenly Father,
[2:03:27] Lord, how glad we are to see that you've
[2:03:29] revealed yourself to us again in this
[2:03:30] age, Lord. That you are Jesus Christ,
[2:03:33] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:03:35] Lord, that when you took your stripes at
[2:03:37] the whipping post, Lord, when they beat
[2:03:39] and ripped the flesh and muscle off your
[2:03:42] back till the muscles or the the bones
[2:03:44] showed through, Lord, it was for our
[2:03:46] healing. It was for our deliverance. It
[2:03:49] was for our freedom,
[2:03:51] Lord. When you shed your blood at
[2:03:52] Calvary, Lord, and released your spirit,
[2:03:55] it was to give us overcoming power,
[2:03:58] Lord. It was to give us over power over
[2:03:59] ourselves. It was to give us power over
[2:04:01] sin, Lord. It was power to get out of
[2:04:04] the way and let you take control of our
[2:04:05] lives. Lord, we are so thankful we've
[2:04:08] heard and seen a ministry that shows us
[2:04:10] the reality of Jesus Christ today. And
[2:04:13] Lord, though we have only a portion of
[2:04:15] that in and of ourselves, Lord, we're
[2:04:17] thankful for what you've given us. Lord,
[2:04:18] we're thankful we have, as Jesus said,
[2:04:20] eyes to see and ears to hear, Lord, that
[2:04:23] we've heard what the spirit is saying in
[2:04:25] this age. Lord, we don't worship a man,
[2:04:27] Lord. We worship you. We raise up your
[2:04:29] name. We give thanks to you, Lord. We're
[2:04:32] looking to you as the covenant angel,
[2:04:34] Lord, our bridegroom that's coming back
[2:04:36] for a bride that you prepared by washing
[2:04:38] us with your word again. Lord, I pray
[2:04:41] you take away our sickness this morning.
[2:04:44] Lord, I tell you pray you take away our
[2:04:45] sin sickness, our unbelief, Lord, our
[2:04:48] failings and fallings, Lord.
[2:04:51] Lord, that we could stand on the promise
[2:04:53] of your word, Lord, faithfully, waiting,
[2:04:56] faithfully in action, Lord, in obedience
[2:04:58] to what you brought us, Lord, until the
[2:05:00] day that you come and say, "It's time.
[2:05:03] Touch your people, Lord. Bless us, we
[2:05:05] pray, Lord. We're so thankful. We're so
[2:05:08] thankful that you're here with us, Lord.
[2:05:10] Let us have faith, Lord, that even if
[2:05:12] that prophet, because that prophet's
[2:05:14] gone, Lord, you haven't left us. You've
[2:05:16] not forsaken us, Lord, but you you're
[2:05:18] here by your spirit, Lord, to raise us
[2:05:20] up above all these things. You're here
[2:05:22] to heal. You're here to deliver. You're
[2:05:24] here to change. You're here to save.
[2:05:26] You're here to transform us, Lord, by
[2:05:28] your word and by your spirit. Lord, have
[2:05:30] your way. We ask in Jesus Christ's name
[2:05:32] we pray. Amen. Amen. I've got a note
[2:05:36] here says, "Brother Matt checked in with
[2:05:37] Brother Dale Walsher, and he's feeling
[2:05:40] much better." Amen. So, we thank the
[2:05:42] Lord for that, for his goodness to him.
[2:05:44] Amen.
[2:05:47] I can only think of one song to sing and
[2:05:48] that's He's in the house.
[2:05:52] 11:37
[2:05:56] Little Girl was lying there. The people
[2:06:00] all were weeping. 11:37
[2:06:04] They just laughed at Jesus when he said,
[2:06:08] "She's only sleeping."
[2:06:12] But as he took her again,
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; she began to live again.
[2:06:21] Some began to praise the Lord.
[2:06:33] has to flee.
[2:06:37] Now there is
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; where darkness used to be.
[2:06:45] Now
[2:06:54] his name
[2:06:58] is his name.
[2:07:07] We were like that little girl dead in
[2:07:12] all our sins
[2:07:15] till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[2:07:19] and gave me life again.
[2:07:24] I am just a house of plague.
[2:07:28] But ever since that blessed day,
[2:07:32] there's a light that shines in me for
[2:07:35] all the world to see.
[2:07:40] He's in the house.
[2:07:43] again has to be.
[2:07:48] Now there is light.
[2:07:56] Now there is hope.
[2:08:00] There's no one down.
[2:08:03] Praise his name.
[2:08:07] Praise his name.
[2:08:11] He's in the house.
[2:08:14] So death has to flee.
[2:08:19] Now there is light.
[2:08:23] Where darkness used to be.
[2:08:27] Now there is hope.
[2:08:31] There's no more doubt.
[2:08:35] Praise his name.
[2:08:39] Praise his name.
[2:08:43] He's in the house.
[2:08:49] Little girl was lying there. The people
[2:08:54] all were weeping.
[2:08:57] They just laughed at Jesus when he said
[2:09:01] she's only sleeping.
[2:09:05] But as he took her by the hand,
[2:09:09] she began to live again.
[2:09:13] Some began to praise the Lord. Some
[2:09:17] began to say,
[2:09:20] "He's in the house."
[2:09:24] So death has to face.
[2:09:28] Now there is life
[2:09:32] where darkness used to be.
[2:09:36] Now there is hope.
[2:09:40] There's no more doubt.
[2:09:44] Praise his name.
[2:09:48] Praise his name.
[2:09:52] He's in the house.
[2:09:58] And we were like that little girl dead
[2:10:02] in all our sins
[2:10:05] till Jesus touched this heart of mine
[2:10:09] and gave me life again.
[2:10:13] I am just a house of clay.
[2:10:17] Ever since that blessed day,
[2:10:21] there's a light that shines in me for
[2:10:25] all the world to see.
[2:10:29] He's in the house.
[2:10:32] Death has to flee.
[2:10:36] Now there is life
[2:10:40] where darkness used to be.
[2:10:44] Now there is hope.
[2:10:48] There's no more doubt.
[2:10:52] Praise his name.
[2:10:56] Praise his name.
[2:10:59] He's in the house. So death last to
[2:11:04] flee.
[2:11:07] Now there is light
[2:11:10] where darkness used to be.
[2:11:15] Now there is hope.
[2:11:19] There's no more doubt.
[2:11:22] Praise his name.
[2:11:26] Praise his name.
[2:11:30] He's in the house.
[2:11:34] Death last.
[2:11:38] Now there is life
[2:11:41] where darkness used to be.
[2:11:45] Now there is hope.
[2:11:49] There's no more doubt.
[2:11:53] Praise his name.
[2:11:57] Praise his name.
[2:12:01] He's in the house.
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:16] wanted to give a testimony. I don't know
[2:12:18] if you've noticed, but um the last week
[2:12:20] or so I've been limping. Um I had a
[2:12:22] procedure done and um the but I just
[2:12:25] purposely blistered the bottom of my
[2:12:27] foot and cut out a very big hole out of
[2:12:29] it and um I haven't really been able to
[2:12:31] walk and um
[2:12:34] even just this morning I tried to put my
[2:12:36] foot down and it was unbearable and I
[2:12:38] couldn't um uh just towards the end of
[2:12:41] the service I decided I'm going to stand
[2:12:43] up and um I stood up and there's no pain
[2:12:46] whatsoever. I can walk perfectly normal.
[2:12:49] So praise the Lord. Amen. Praise the
[2:12:51] Lord.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. He's still
[2:12:57] alive and well. Amen. Do you believe
[2:13:00] that?
[2:13:02] Amen.
[2:13:05] [Music]
[2:13:08] The healer. 1363.
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:15] You hold my every

[2:13:57] in
[2:13:58] you.

[2:14:06] you're my healer.

[2:14:26] I believe
[2:14:28] that you're my portion.
[2:14:34] I believe

[2:14:44] Jesus, you're all I need.
[2:14:51] And you hold my every
[2:14:55] moment.
[2:14:58] You call my rageing
[2:15:02] sea

[2:15:13] and you heal all my
[2:15:17] disease.
[2:15:21] Oh, I trust
[2:15:23] in
[2:15:25] you.
[2:15:28] Lord, I trust.
[2:15:37] I believe
[2:15:39] that you're my healer.
[2:15:45] I believe
[2:15:47] that you are all I need.
[2:15:54] I believe.
[2:15:59] I believe
[2:16:02] that you're my portion.
[2:16:07] I believe
[2:16:09] you're more than enough for me.
[2:16:17] Jesus, you're all I need. And I believe
[2:16:24] that you're my healer.
[2:16:29] I believe
[2:16:31] that you are.
[2:16:38] Oh, I believe.
[2:16:43] I believe
[2:16:46] that you're my portion.
[2:16:51] I believe
[2:16:53] you're more than enough for me.
[2:17:01] Jesus, you're all I need.
[2:17:06] I will praise the mighty name of Jesus.
[2:17:08] 1296.
[2:17:10] [Music]
[2:17:25] My troubled soul,
[2:17:29] why so weigh down?
[2:17:34] You were not made
[2:17:36] to bear this heavy load.
[2:17:41] So cast all your burdens
[2:17:46] upon the Lord.
[2:17:50] Jesus cares.
[2:17:53] He cares for you.
[2:17:58] Oh Jesus cares. cares. He cares for you.
[2:18:05] And all your worry won't help you make
[2:18:10] it through.
[2:18:13] So cast all your burdens
[2:18:17] upon the Lord.
[2:18:21] Trust again
[2:18:24] in the promise of his love.
[2:18:29] And I will praise the mighty
[2:18:34] name
[2:18:36] of Jesus.
[2:18:38] Praise the Lord, the lifter of my head.
[2:18:46] Praise the rock of my
[2:18:51] salvation.
[2:18:54] know
[2:18:55] my days are in his faithful hands.

[2:25:38] Let's just bow our hearts before him as
[2:25:41] we approach his throne this evening.
[2:25:45] [Music]
[2:25:48] Lord God, with humility we come before
[2:25:50] your presence. Lord,
[2:25:53] with humble hearts, Lord God, we come
[2:25:55] forth
[2:25:58] saying, "Thank you, Lord God, for your
[2:26:00] grace." Yes, Lord.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God, Lord God, when we examine our
[2:26:07] lives before the light of your word,
[2:26:10] Lord God, we see yourself so unworthy,
[2:26:14] Lord.
[2:26:16] There's so much, Lord God, besetting,
[2:26:18] Lord God. And there's so many things,
[2:26:21] Lord God, that would have disqualify us
[2:26:24] as being your children, Lord.
[2:26:28] But Lord God, in your grace you called
[2:26:31] us and by your mercy we are here this
[2:26:34] evening Lord God. Not because Lord God
[2:26:38] Lord we are good. Not because we have
[2:26:40] any righteousness to present Lord,
[2:26:44] but because Lord God, you have called
[2:26:47] us, Lord God,
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; and we have heard that voice, Lord God,
[2:26:51] and
[2:26:53] we saw your presence, Lord God, as you
[2:26:55] unveil yourself, Lord God, through your
[2:26:57] man's servants. And we knew, oh God,
[2:27:00] that that was your voice. And something
[2:27:02] in our hearts, oh God, was able to
[2:27:05] respond to that call.
[2:27:07] And here we are Lord God in a world in a
[2:27:10] time oh God. But the scripture declares
[2:27:14] Lord God the time of chaos. But yet Lord
[2:27:17] God in our heart Lord God we are feeling
[2:27:20] the effect oh God of the heavenlies.
[2:27:23] Lord God we're feeling the call oh God
[2:27:26] of the voice of God echoing in our
[2:27:29] hearts. And and so God for this we say
[2:27:32] thank you Lord.
[2:27:35] Oh God, Lord,
[2:27:38] the word of God to us, Lord God, is onto
[2:27:41] perfection,
[2:27:43] Lord God, unto completion,
[2:27:46] Lord God, unto the day of the Lord. And
[2:27:49] so God, we surrender our lives into your
[2:27:52] hands, Lord God, for your leadership,
[2:27:55] for your guidance,
[2:27:57] Lord God, for your stewardship, Lord
[2:27:59] God, over our lives. Lord God, for this
[2:28:02] journey, Lord God, that we are called
[2:28:04] the walk of God. And may, oh God, we
[2:28:08] find true fellowship with you, Lord.
[2:28:11] Father God, may you come, Lord God, in
[2:28:14] our times of weakness, in our times of
[2:28:16] of of failures, in our times, oh God,
[2:28:19] when we feel, Lord God, that we are left
[2:28:22] alone, may that small, still voice still
[2:28:25] whisper the words of comfort. May you
[2:28:28] come Lord God in our lives Lord and may
[2:28:32] Lord God nothing matters nothing of this
[2:28:34] world nothing of our own desires nothing
[2:28:37] of our own thinking Lord God may nothing
[2:28:40] oh God lord take the place of us oh
[2:28:43] hallelujah of the leadership of the Holy
[2:28:45] Spirit Lord God may father God with all
[2:28:49] the fibers with all the strength we can
[2:28:52] gather Lord God within our with oursel
[2:28:55] this evening Lord God may we pour our
[2:28:57] hearts before you, Lord God. May you,
[2:29:00] Lord God, see our lives, oh God,
