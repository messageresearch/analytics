[39:26] Exodus chapter 16 and verse 1.
[39:29] it says and they took their Journey from
[39:30] elim and all the congregation of the
[39:32] children of Israel came unto the
[39:34] Wilderness of sin which is between Elam
[39:36] and Sinai on the 15th day of the second
[39:38] month after their departing out of the
[39:40] land of Egypt and the whole Congregation
[39:42] of the children of Israel murmured
[39:44] against Moses and Aaron in the
[39:46] wilderness and the children of Israel
[39:48] said unto them would to God we had died
[39:51] by the hand of the Lord in the land of
[39:53] Egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and
[39:55] when we did eat bread to the full for ye
[39:58] have brought us forth into this
[39:59] Wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[40:01] with hunger then said the Lord unto
[40:04] Moses behold I will reign bread from
[40:07] heaven for you and the people shall go
[40:09] out and gather a certain rate every day
[40:11] that I may prove them whether they will
[40:14] walk in my law or no amen God bless you
[40:17] you can have your seats this evening
[40:20] and then we want to continue our series
[40:22] on Redemption
[40:24] and we want to take a thought tonight
[40:27] again of of no turning back in the
[40:29] second part I'm sorry my clicker's not
[40:31] working up here if you can hit the next
[40:33] slide we'll see if it picks up as we go
[40:35] through
[40:36] remember we're going to take a a a
[40:38] second portion of of no turning back
[40:41] amen and we talked last time about how
[40:43] pharaoh and the armies came up against
[40:44] Israel and God had led them
[40:46] supernaturally into a place where they
[40:48] had walls on both sides and they had the
[40:50] desert in front of them and they had the
[40:52] water behind them the Red Sea behind
[40:53] them and then after that God had had
[40:56] lured the Egyptians down the same path
[40:58] he had miraculously opened the Red Sea
[41:01] and when he did that then the Israelites
[41:02] crossed safely and then pharaoh and his
[41:04] army tried to follow through and we
[41:06] learned that if you're not
[41:06] supernaturally meant to follow with God
[41:09] then you'll fall off the path it'll be
[41:10] to your ruin every single time but we
[41:13] wanted to understand how that the
[41:14] supernatural leadership of God will take
[41:16] us to places where we think we're in
[41:18] danger and it'll take us to places of
[41:20] trial and it'll take us to places maybe
[41:22] where we're feeling tempted in these
[41:24] different things and is God bringing us
[41:25] to those places for our good and for our
[41:28] deliverance and for the destruction of
[41:30] Satan's kingdom amen and so the lesson
[41:32] we were supposed to learn there is that
[41:34] when the walls close in and when things
[41:35] look bad and things look poor then don't
[41:38] get worried don't get frantic don't
[41:40] start to panic don't start to complain
[41:41] because if God has led you there then
[41:44] God has a purpose in that amen and we
[41:46] saw after that and we won't read it for
[41:47] the sake of time but Exodus 15 is a song
[41:50] of praise and worship and victory and we
[41:53] see there that Moses sings his song of
[41:55] Victory there and he talks about how the
[41:57] Lord has has destroyed the Chariots and
[41:59] he's brought the sea crashing down and
[42:00] he's destroyed their enemies and and
[42:02] they're free and all these different
[42:04] things and then Miriam gets up and she
[42:06] takes a a timbrel she takes a tambourine
[42:08] and she leads all the sisters in the
[42:10] Jericho March before there even was a
[42:11] Jericho merch and they're running around
[42:13] the camp and they're shouting and
[42:14] praising and dancing and having all of
[42:17] these just this wonderful time in the
[42:18] Lord
[42:19] it was an amazing scene to see the
[42:21] wreckage maybe and the dead bodies of
[42:23] your enemies floating up and you're
[42:24] having a Revival service immediately
[42:26] after this and then we jump to verse to
[42:29] Exodus 16 which we just read and God is
[42:33] supernaturally leading them just as he
[42:35] did before the Red Sea the same
[42:37] leadership that was before the trial is
[42:39] now leading them after the trial and the
[42:41] the scripture tells us that they've been
[42:43] going for days they've been going for 45
[42:45] days under the protection and the
[42:47] leadership of the pillar of fire and the
[42:49] pillar of cloud
[42:51] nothing has changed it's still
[42:53] Supernatural Moses being be at the head
[42:55] of the line but he's following a cloud
[42:57] he's following the Holy Spirit he's
[42:58] following the presence of God and there
[43:01] are about a third of the way to Canaan
[43:02] if you look at the map they're about a
[43:04] third of the way if you calculate out
[43:05] what they've got there they're about a
[43:07] third of their way to the promised land
[43:08] when we get to Exodus chapter 16 and
[43:11] then we see that they get into trouble
[43:13] again
[43:13] so if we look here at Exodus 16 thank
[43:15] you brother Matt Exodus 16 verse 1 which
[43:18] we just read it says they took their
[43:19] Journey from Elam all the congregation
[43:21] of the children of Israel came into the
[43:23] Wilderness of sin to me it's always
[43:25] interesting that they entered the
[43:26] Wilderness of sin because that's what it
[43:28] became for them was a place of unbelief
[43:30] it was a place of death
[43:32] which is between Elam and Sinai on the
[43:34] 15th day of the second month after
[43:36] they're departing out of the land of
[43:38] Egypt
[43:39] 45 days in the presence of God visibly
[43:43] we know how wonderful it is to be in
[43:45] church and to feel the presence of God
[43:47] and yet we don't even get to see him
[43:49] most times I can only think of one time
[43:52] in my life that have ever seen a pillar
[43:54] of cloud in my life just once that's it
[43:57] in my entire life and they're sitting
[43:59] there for 40. they're walking for 45
[44:01] days with a visible presence of God
[44:04] above them and with them day in and day
[44:06] out
[44:08] what that ought to have done for them
[44:10] what that ought to have done for them to
[44:12] see the visible presence the proof that
[44:14] God is with them day in and day out the
[44:16] unchanging all-powerful delivering
[44:18] Victorious God leading the way through
[44:21] the desert
[44:23] they're there and they're they're
[44:24] they're they're rich they're free
[44:26] they're taken care of they're delivered
[44:29] everything that we want as believers
[44:31] they have right there in that Wilderness
[44:33] as they're walking through not only that
[44:36] each and every one of them is in
[44:38] marching health
[44:39] I was reading through Exodus 16 because
[44:42] I knew it was in the Bible and I
[44:43] couldn't find it so I had to go
[44:44] searching and it was in Psalms 105. he
[44:46] said he brought them forth also with
[44:49] silver and gold we say that's wonderful
[44:51] I'd love that but he said but there was
[44:53] not one feeble person among their tribes
[44:57] not one feeble person now the scripture
[45:00] tells us that there were six hundred
[45:02] thousand men that walked out of Egypt on
[45:04] that on that Exodus morning
[45:06] so women and children they estimate they
[45:09] had at least two million people women
[45:12] children young old
[45:14] walking out you'd think as slaves they
[45:17] would have some some broken bones they'd
[45:19] have some some sore muscles they'd have
[45:21] something that would have held them back
[45:23] but it says on that day there was not
[45:25] one feeble person that walked out of
[45:27] that Exodus that day of God's
[45:29] Deliverance that day of God's the start
[45:31] of his Redemption not a single one was
[45:34] being held back by their physical
[45:35] ailments
[45:37] so we're 45 days in with the visible
[45:39] presence of God and they still have
[45:40] their health
[45:42] they still have the victory they still
[45:44] have everything that they've started out
[45:45] with and it's the entire thing is
[45:47] Supernatural they've got a sea full of
[45:49] dead Egyptians and sunken chariots
[45:51] because cherries don't float very well
[45:53] behind them in the Red Sea and they're
[45:55] walking and everything's great and the
[45:58] praise in the God and they're shouting
[46:00] and they're dancing until all of a
[46:02] sudden they aren't
[46:04] and we see how they go throughout this
[46:06] that every time they come up against any
[46:09] little trial any little struggle any
[46:11] other time where God didn't do something
[46:13] just the way they wanted in the way that
[46:16] they wanted and how they felt they
[46:17] needed it then they started to complain
[46:19] and all of a sudden they lost the
[46:21] Revelation they lost the benefit of the
[46:23] presence of God in their midst
[46:25] time and time again they start to
[46:28] complain and we see here in verse two it
[46:30] says the whole Congregation of the
[46:32] children of Israel murmured against
[46:33] Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and
[46:36] the children of Israel said unto them
[46:38] word to God we had died by the hand of
[46:41] the Lord in the land of Egypt notice
[46:43] that it says we wish God had killed us
[46:46] in Egypt God rather than saving us God
[46:49] rather than delivering us God rather
[46:50] than redeeming us God rather than
[46:52] healing us and bringing to this little
[46:54] hardship we're facing we wish you to
[46:57] just left us where we were in our
[46:58] slavery and in our misery and you killed
[47:01] us
[47:02] if your Redemption could have been death
[47:04] that would have been better for us than
[47:06] what we're going through right now
[47:09] 45 days of the supernatural presence and
[47:12] all they're saying all of a sudden
[47:13] they're saying God you should have
[47:15] killed us
[47:16] why they said when we sat by the flesh
[47:20] parts and when we did eat bread to the
[47:23] full for you have brought us forth unto
[47:25] this Wilderness to kill this whole
[47:27] assembly with hunger
[47:29] their belly's got a little tight their
[47:31] faces got a little pinch they lost maybe
[47:34] that little bit of fat they might have
[47:35] had in in the good eating after leaving
[47:37] Egypt and not having to slave and work
[47:39] the way they did but as soon as they did
[47:41] it as soon as they came to a place where
[47:43] God didn't give them everything they
[47:45] felt they needed they started to
[47:47] complain
[47:48] and what were they they were ungrateful
[47:51] they were ungrateful God had done so
[47:53] much for them and then he held back
[47:57] did he hold back because he couldn't do
[47:58] a church
[48:00] he held back to see where their hearts
[48:01] were he was testing them to see what
[48:04] they would do what the nature what the
[48:06] heart what the attitude of the people
[48:08] was going to be as they moved into this
[48:10] towards this land of Canaan amen
[48:12] and you can notice an ungrateful person
[48:14] every single time an unbeliever is what
[48:17] they are because what happens is they
[48:20] look to the past as a greater blessing
[48:22] than the present even if God has been
[48:24] leading them to where they are today
[48:27] we can get that way sometimes where we
[48:30] forget all of the things that God has
[48:31] done for us because we're so caught up
[48:33] in the circumstances of this moment
[48:36] that's what caught up with the children
[48:38] of Israel time and time again and you'll
[48:40] see those people
[48:42] and I'm not saying it's not me I'm
[48:43] saying you'll see people that they are
[48:45] grateful until something bad goes wrong
[48:47] and then they forget everything and what
[48:49] they do is they take and they take and
[48:51] they take and they take and then the
[48:52] minute they can't take anymore they get
[48:54] ungrateful
[48:55] they're never giving they're always
[48:57] taking and so when they don't get what
[48:59] they want they have nothing to offer
[49:01] except complaints and it drives division
[49:03] into things amen
[49:04] they forget what God has done they
[49:07] forget that God is with them and he's
[49:08] trying to do something with them right
[49:10] now because they're so focused on how
[49:11] they're feeling what they're missing
[49:13] what's hurt them
[49:15] what's causing them some sort of
[49:16] discomfort
[49:18] and they've forgotten that God has led
[49:19] you to this point and he's got you here
[49:22] for a reason right now
[49:24] the prophet of God will put it this way
[49:25] he said ungrateful we've got that kind
[49:28] of people in the world today you don't
[49:31] realize that the bread you eat and the
[49:34] Very air you breathe comes from God
[49:37] I want to ask us this evening are we
[49:39] grateful for everything that we have
[49:42] from the small things to the big things
[49:44] because what I found is if you're not
[49:46] grateful then God will usually pull it
[49:47] away for a little bit just to let you
[49:49] see how blessed you truly are
[49:52] it's God's grace that we have what we
[49:54] have today it's God grace God's grace we
[49:56] have a roof over our head that we have
[49:58] food on our tables that we have money in
[50:00] the bank that we have our health that we
[50:02] have a church building to gather in
[50:04] brother Joe was just over in Tanzania
[50:06] and when you see the lives that they
[50:08] live in the houses they live in and the
[50:10] fact that they have to walk for hours
[50:11] many times just to get to church you say
[50:14] I'm blessed to be where we are today
[50:16] but let's not turn it into a curse by
[50:18] taking it for granted
[50:21] let's not take it for granted that we
[50:23] need all these things because let me
[50:24] tell you we can live with a whole lot
[50:26] less I've been down in third world
[50:28] countries I've been down maybe even
[50:30] worse than third world countries where
[50:31] they have nothing and yet God is with
[50:34] them and they feel that they are blessed
[50:35] we have much to be thankful for amen
[50:39] do our lives reflect that gratefulness
[50:42] so often we're looking for the next best
[50:43] thing instead of realizing that we're
[50:45] perfectly okay right where God has us
[50:47] right now that we can deal with what
[50:48] we've got for quite a while longer
[50:50] before we truly have a need before we're
[50:52] truly hungry
[50:54] listen you see those pictures that the
[50:56] National Geographic used to have them uh
[50:58] you know of over in Ethiopia when they
[51:00] had that famine and they had war and all
[51:01] these things and they had babies that
[51:03] had a belly that just came out like this
[51:05] not because they were so full but
[51:07] because they were so hungry that it
[51:08] distended their belly
[51:10] that's how that's how little they had to
[51:12] eat
[51:13] and we worry if we we don't maybe make
[51:15] the bills for one month
[51:17] or maybe we have to eat a little
[51:18] different because inflation's killing us
[51:20] in these different things amen let's not
[51:22] be ungrateful he's met our needs and he
[51:24] continues to provide our needs amen
[51:27] but brother Brown would say this he says
[51:29] now the question is for us tonight do
[51:31] you care
[51:33] he cares but now do you care if you
[51:36] don't care then he can't help you but if
[51:38] you care enough or care about yourself
[51:40] I've heard people make this insane
[51:43] remark I Don't Care What Becomes Of Me
[51:45] oh my I sure Care What Becomes of me and
[51:48] I believe any person in their right mind
[51:50] cares I want to know what's going to
[51:52] happen to me
[51:54] and I know if he loved me there's no one
[51:57] else could love like that he cares for
[51:59] you he says he cares for you
[52:01] so if you know that he loves you if you
[52:04] know that he's called you if you know
[52:05] that he's filled you with the Holy
[52:06] Spirit you have to know that he cares
[52:08] for you and whatever situation you're in
[52:11] is because he cares for you
[52:14] no matter how hard it looks no matter
[52:16] how difficult it is he cares for you
[52:20] but listen how he puts us he says no
[52:23] matter how little you are
[52:26] how insignificant you are
[52:29] how poor how indifferent he says how
[52:33] many times you've tried and failed he
[52:36] still cares his love still knocks at
[52:39] your heart's door he says but are we
[52:42] ungrateful for that
[52:43] sometimes they're so caught up in the
[52:45] moment with its trials and its problems
[52:47] and we forget we've only even survived
[52:49] and made it to this point because of the
[52:52] grace of God
[52:53] that he's kept us through so many other
[52:55] things through many dangers toys and
[52:58] snares I have already come
[53:00] but it's his grace that's brought me
[53:02] this far and as it's his grace it's
[53:04] going to take me all the way home amen
[53:06] so whether we're standing on a
[53:08] Mountaintop in clear air and in clear
[53:10] air on top of the big mountain sometimes
[53:12] you can see for a hundred miles
[53:14] and you're up there and you're full of
[53:16] Victory and praise that's a wonderful
[53:17] thing and you say God is with me but
[53:20] he's as much with you down in the valley
[53:22] where he's placed you into battle where
[53:24] you're struggling and striving day in
[53:26] and day out as you are on the
[53:28] Mountaintop you had to go through the
[53:30] valley to get to the Mountaintop and it
[53:32] was his grace in the valley as much as
[53:34] it was his grace to get you to the
[53:35] Mountaintop amen we're there because he
[53:38] cares
[53:39] listen sons of God Daughters of God are
[53:42] led by the spirit of God and so where we
[53:45] are today in our life as long as we are
[53:47] led by the Holy Ghost as long as we're
[53:48] in accordance with the word of God is
[53:50] because he wants us to be exactly where
[53:52] we are
[53:54] you might not like where you're at today
[53:57] trials are rarely easy or fun nor do we
[53:59] nor do we volunteer for them but we're
[54:01] there because he wants us to be there
[54:02] because he's got something for us out of
[54:04] that situation amen
[54:07] how many of us would say I'm grateful
[54:08] for this trial
[54:11] one person
[54:14] I don't I don't ever say it while I'm
[54:16] going through it
[54:19] but
[54:20] when you look back afterwards
[54:23] and you see what is done in your life
[54:25] and you see the benefits of it you can
[54:28] usually say praise the Lord for what
[54:30] I've gone through amen
[54:32] I always bring it back to the gym and
[54:34] working out because I exercise regularly
[54:36] I went on Monday I was operating about
[54:40] 80 percent I had slept poorly and
[54:42] Mondays are leg day
[54:44] leg day is the worst day it's the
[54:45] hardest days the heaviest day you move
[54:47] the most weight your whole body is tired
[54:49] out and I went there and so often I just
[54:52] feel old quite frankly in the gym
[54:55] and you go there and you exert and you
[54:57] sweat and you get stars in your eyes and
[55:00] you wonder why you're here but if you
[55:02] look back into what it has done for you
[55:04] throughout your life to where you can
[55:06] stand today and you can be healthy and
[55:08] you can be fit for service and God can
[55:10] use you and you don't get sick easy and
[55:13] you don't tire out as much you say
[55:15] that's why I keep going here that's why
[55:17] I'm sweating it out that's why I'm
[55:19] flushed that's why I'm so worn out here
[55:21] is because I know in the end this is
[55:24] better for me than if I didn't do it at
[55:26] all
[55:27] that's why we exercise that's how we eat
[55:29] that's why we eat well isn't it some of
[55:32] you have the benefit of liking to eat
[55:33] vegetables
[55:35] I don't
[55:36] I don't like most vegetables but the
[55:38] reason I eat them is because they're
[55:40] good for me I don't enjoy vegetables but
[55:43] I enjoy the benefits of vegetables
[55:46] I much prefer sugar and donuts and chips
[55:50] but that doesn't do any good for me
[55:53] and so sometimes I've got to eat
[55:54] something I don't really like so I can
[55:57] get what I really want and that is a
[55:59] healthy body
[56:00] that's so that I don't fall over when
[56:03] I'm 55.
[56:05] of a heart attack
[56:07] or or have to go on on some sort of
[56:09] medication that that is debilitating for
[56:11] me or keeps me down
[56:13] we do we have to do things we don't like
[56:15] because they're good for us and God
[56:17] knows that sometimes we've got to be
[56:18] forced into doing the things we don't
[56:20] like to get to the good things that he
[56:22] has for us in these situations amen
[56:25] we have to learn as Believers to embrace
[56:28] the challenge to embrace the trial to
[56:30] embrace the situation and say as long as
[56:33] my conscience is clear according to the
[56:35] word of God
[56:36] because it has to be clear according to
[56:38] the word of God not just clear because
[56:40] sometimes our consciences are seared
[56:42] and just because you don't feel anything
[56:44] doesn't mean there's nothing wrong it's
[56:45] got to be clear according to the word
[56:47] but if our conscience is clear by the
[56:49] word of God then we know that where we
[56:51] are today where we are tonight is
[56:53] because he wants us there
[56:55] it's not a we're not in a hardship of
[56:58] our own making remember Paul says listen
[57:00] if you do wrong and people give you a
[57:02] hard time about it he says there's no
[57:03] glory in that
[57:05] he says it's only Glory if you do right
[57:07] and people persecute you but if you do
[57:09] wrong and people call you out for it he
[57:11] says you deserve that because you did
[57:12] wrong
[57:13] so don't make sure that if you're in a
[57:15] tough time that you're not there of a
[57:16] decision of your own making of a path of
[57:19] your own choosing rather than one that's
[57:20] according to the word of God
[57:22] but if we know that we're there by the
[57:24] word of God then we can have faith that
[57:26] God's going to take us through it and
[57:27] it'll be to our benefit every time
[57:29] now First Peter 1 says blessed be the
[57:32] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[57:34] which according to His abundant Mercy
[57:36] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[57:39] hope a Living Hope by the resurrection
[57:41] of Jesus Christ from the dead to an
[57:44] inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled
[57:46] and that fadeth not a way reserved in
[57:48] heaven for you
[57:50] who are kept by the power of God through
[57:53] faith unto salvation ready to be
[57:55] revealed in the last time
[57:58] verse 6 says wherein ye greatly Rejoice
[58:01] though now for a season if need be Ye Ye
[58:05] are in heaviness through manifold
[58:06] Temptations
[58:08] did you catch what he said there I
[58:09] highlighted it to to make sure you catch
[58:12] it because he said Rejoice that you are
[58:14] kept by the power of God even if now
[58:17] because it's needed because it's
[58:20] necessary you're going through many
[58:22] Temptations you're going through many
[58:24] trials you're going through many
[58:25] difficulties amen we go through as a
[58:28] Believer many Temptations or trials
[58:30] because they are needed Peter says they
[58:34] have a purpose amen they are doing
[58:36] something to us and I believe that one
[58:38] of the things that they do is they
[58:39] separate us from the world and the
[58:41] influence of the world
[58:42] because you give in to a Temptation one
[58:44] time you'll see the fruit of that
[58:46] Temptation and you won't like it and
[58:48] next time that Temptation comes around
[58:49] hopefully you can turn it down and say I
[58:51] don't like what that did last time I'm
[58:53] not going to do it this time
[58:55] he teaches us sometimes our our will
[58:58] gets in the way and so he has to say all
[59:00] right you go down that path for a little
[59:02] while you do that for a little bit see
[59:04] where it takes you and then come back to
[59:06] me and let me know how you want to move
[59:07] with the rest of your life do you want
[59:09] to go there do you want to come back to
[59:10] where I am amen
[59:13] when it comes to Temptation This just
[59:16] dropped him while I was studying it's
[59:17] kind of off the topic but what is
[59:20] Temptation because we beat ourselves up
[59:21] as Christians sometimes because we're
[59:23] tempted
[59:24] what is Temptation
[59:26] temptation is simply a choice
[59:29] will you follow the word of God or will
[59:31] you follow something else
[59:33] now the classic case is when Jesus was
[59:36] the the in one in one book it says that
[59:39] the Holy Spirit led him into the
[59:40] Wilderness the other one says it drove
[59:42] him into the Wilderness to be tempted to
[59:44] be tried to be proven amen and
[59:47] Temptation if we see it is Satan
[59:49] whispering in your ear Satan whispering
[59:52] in your mind Satan trying to influence
[59:54] Satan trying to inject something into
[59:56] you that wasn't there to start with
[1:00:00] I want you to catch that because so
[1:00:02] often and I'll say this especially as a
[1:00:03] young man when I would be tempted by
[1:00:06] something what would happen is Satan
[1:00:08] would twist that scripture where Jesus
[1:00:09] said if you do it in your head it's as
[1:00:11] if you did it for for real you know he
[1:00:13] was talking about lusting after women
[1:00:14] but it goes through many things and I
[1:00:16] take that insane with twist and he'd say
[1:00:18] listen you just thought about it and you
[1:00:21] dwelt on it and therefore you're at
[1:00:23] fault as if you did it
[1:00:25] and guess what that's not true
[1:00:28] what he's trying to say is that thought
[1:00:30] originated from you that desire
[1:00:32] originated from you and then he'd try
[1:00:34] and get me to do it because I committed
[1:00:36] the sin of thinking about it in the
[1:00:37] first place when he's the one that put
[1:00:39] the thought in my mind in the first
[1:00:40] place because I've got God sitting here
[1:00:42] and I've got Satan sitting here and
[1:00:44] they're both trying to influence me and
[1:00:45] we're creatures that can be influenced
[1:00:47] because our mind our spirit can catch
[1:00:50] the thoughts of the spirit Realm we are
[1:00:53] receivers and so we can receive what the
[1:00:56] holy spirit's saying or we can receive
[1:00:57] what Satan and his kingdom are saying
[1:00:59] and so Satan will sit there and he'll
[1:01:01] say because you are tempted that is
[1:01:03] within you
[1:01:04] but it's not it's just Satan whispering
[1:01:07] in your ear but if he can get you to
[1:01:09] think it's something coming out of you
[1:01:10] he's got half the battle one because
[1:01:12] then you think you're already in sin and
[1:01:14] then it's easier to just continue
[1:01:15] further down the road amen
[1:01:19] it's Satan that's putting those mind
[1:01:21] those things in your mind and that Satan
[1:01:23] trying to awaken something that God has
[1:01:25] already defeated in your life
[1:01:28] I've said it before I remember when I
[1:01:30] went to the gym with Brother John I
[1:01:32] think it was his brother John Andrews or
[1:01:33] me it was Joe Adams and they were
[1:01:34] playing a song and I said that's the
[1:01:36] kind of music I used to like
[1:01:39] but guess what it didn't have any effect
[1:01:41] on me
[1:01:42] why because I've been delivered of that
[1:01:45] but let me tell you if I sat around that
[1:01:48] long enough Satan would start coming in
[1:01:50] there and he'd start reminding me
[1:01:51] remember how much you like that hey
[1:01:53] remember that other song that was on a
[1:01:55] tape because it was a tape that I
[1:01:56] listened to way back then right
[1:01:58] and he'd start to bring those memories
[1:02:00] to my mind and he'd start to try and
[1:02:02] build it into me thinking that I had a
[1:02:04] desire for that
[1:02:05] but yet I know when I walked in and
[1:02:07] listened to that I could identify it as
[1:02:09] something from my past I could identify
[1:02:11] it as something I defeated but I also
[1:02:13] knew it was familiar and if I stick
[1:02:14] around with something familiar Satan
[1:02:16] will try and put it back on me
[1:02:19] so I don't stick around with things that
[1:02:20] are familiar but don't get dragged down
[1:02:22] into thinking that because you're
[1:02:24] tempted to something in your past or
[1:02:26] something that that appeals to your
[1:02:28] nature your your human body that that is
[1:02:30] coming from you that is Satan trying to
[1:02:32] get you to do something that the holy
[1:02:34] spirit inside you is fighting and that's
[1:02:35] the reason that it doesn't happen easily
[1:02:37] is because you've got something inside
[1:02:38] you that's fighting for against it and
[1:02:40] saying I don't want to do this
[1:02:42] I mean this there's that saying that
[1:02:45] says you can you can you can't stop a
[1:02:47] bird from flying over your head
[1:02:49] but you can stop it from building the
[1:02:50] nest
[1:02:51] listen you can't stop Satan from firing
[1:02:53] darts at you you can't stop Satan from
[1:02:55] trying to attack you you can't stop
[1:02:57] Satan from trying to influence you but
[1:02:59] you can change your thoughts you can
[1:03:01] focus on something different you can
[1:03:03] turn on different music you can read a
[1:03:05] different book you can read a different
[1:03:06] Bible you can be in Fellowship you can
[1:03:08] change your friendship you can change
[1:03:10] your situation you don't have to sit
[1:03:12] there and listen to it but when you sit
[1:03:14] there and do nothing then Satan will
[1:03:16] occupy your time every single time
[1:03:18] listen Satan's got lots of time to talk
[1:03:20] he's got lots of patience to wait for an
[1:03:22] opening amen so we've got to backfill
[1:03:24] those things with the things of God and
[1:03:26] the good things of God and the victories
[1:03:28] of God and what he's done in our lives
[1:03:30] so that Satan knows we're not sitting
[1:03:31] there and listening and going back to
[1:03:32] what he thinks that he wants us to do
[1:03:34] amen
[1:03:36] brother Brown would say this he said
[1:03:37] some of you young people that has wasted
[1:03:39] your living
[1:03:40] the hours that mother spent in prayer
[1:03:43] for you and Dad all the teaching that's
[1:03:44] been done to you and yet you've turned
[1:03:46] it aside to listen to what the whisper
[1:03:50] of the devil
[1:03:52] now you're Desiring the music of the
[1:03:55] world you aren't Desiring it before he
[1:03:57] says but you listen to the whisper and
[1:03:59] now you're Desiring it
[1:04:02] Satan tries to tell you that desire was
[1:04:04] in you no no he built that desire into
[1:04:06] you because you kept listening to what
[1:04:07] his whisper
[1:04:11] now you're Desiring the music of the
[1:04:13] world the things of the world
[1:04:15] he says but you're coming to yourself
[1:04:17] like the prodigal in the pig pen he says
[1:04:20] would you raise your hand sister brother
[1:04:22] and say God remember me bring me to
[1:04:25] myself this morning and let me come to
[1:04:28] Father's house it doesn't cost you one
[1:04:30] thing he's expecting you no matter what
[1:04:33] you've done he says though your sins be
[1:04:35] a Scarlet they shall be white like snow
[1:04:38] red like Crimson they'll be white like
[1:04:41] wool
[1:04:42] check your thoughts church and put a
[1:04:44] filter on them
[1:04:46] and realize that if it's coming from the
[1:04:48] opposite side of where you're living
[1:04:49] then Satan is trying to influence you
[1:04:53] so you just put a filter on it and if it
[1:04:55] is contrary to the word
[1:04:57] then you just stop that and you start to
[1:04:59] read what the word says about the
[1:05:00] situation rather than listening to him
[1:05:02] try and tell you what's inside of you
[1:05:03] because the scripture says greater is he
[1:05:06] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:05:08] world remember brother Bradham said in
[1:05:09] the quote he said to overcome means to
[1:05:12] recognize Satan in every one of his
[1:05:14] tricks
[1:05:15] so you recognize who's talking to you as
[1:05:18] Satan but that's not the end of the
[1:05:19] quote because he says and to realize
[1:05:23] that he that is within you is greater
[1:05:26] than he that is in the world
[1:05:28] you've got to have him on the inside and
[1:05:30] you've got to turn that conversation
[1:05:31] around and say I've got something living
[1:05:33] in me that's not going to allow me to go
[1:05:35] down that path that doesn't desire that
[1:05:37] and you're a liar Satan because that's
[1:05:39] what he is
[1:05:40] anything Satan says is a lie everything
[1:05:44] he cannot tell the truth
[1:05:46] he's a liar
[1:05:49] he's a liar church so if he's telling
[1:05:52] you a lie that means there must be truth
[1:05:53] in the word of God to offset what he's
[1:05:55] saying go find that and start reading it
[1:05:57] out to him you'll find he doesn't like
[1:05:59] it very much scripture says resist him
[1:06:01] and he'll flee and you resist him with
[1:06:03] the word it's not by strength it's not
[1:06:05] by discipline it's by the word of God
[1:06:07] that you're going to overcome
[1:06:09] amen
[1:06:11] Peter would finish and say that the
[1:06:12] trial of your faith being much more
[1:06:15] precious than of gold that perisheth
[1:06:17] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:06:20] found unto praise and honor and Glory at
[1:06:23] the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:06:25] the effect of your trials he says it's
[1:06:27] more precious than even gold that's
[1:06:29] tried with fire the most pure gold he
[1:06:31] says isn't as valuable as what these
[1:06:33] trials produce in you because he says
[1:06:35] when Christ comes it will be honor and
[1:06:37] glory and praise unto him
[1:06:40] remember the scripture says they
[1:06:42] overcame by the blood of the lamb and
[1:06:43] the word of their testimony this is the
[1:06:45] word of your testimony that you came
[1:06:47] through and he tried you and you came
[1:06:49] through tried his gold you're pure amen
[1:06:51] you're proven you've got the very
[1:06:52] character and nature of Christ
[1:06:55] if we understood this if we accepted it
[1:06:58] how different would our attitudes be
[1:06:59] when we go through tough times
[1:07:01] when we don't get the answer we want
[1:07:03] when we want it in the way we want it
[1:07:06] how different would it be
[1:07:09] look what happened with them in in
[1:07:11] Exodus
[1:07:12] says then the Lord said unto Moses
[1:07:14] behold I will reign bread from heaven
[1:07:18] for you what a God
[1:07:20] you think he's maybe just supernaturally
[1:07:22] make the bread last that they had he
[1:07:24] said no I'm going to Reign it out of
[1:07:26] heaven for you I'm going to do something
[1:07:28] that's never been done before
[1:07:30] supernaturally to meet your complaining
[1:07:36] and the people shall go out and gather a
[1:07:39] certain rate every day that I may prove
[1:07:42] them whether they will walk in my law or
[1:07:44] no I was reading this and something said
[1:07:46] stop
[1:07:48] catch that dig into it he said I'm going
[1:07:52] to prove them whether they'll walk in my
[1:07:53] law or not
[1:07:56] he says I'm going to feed my people in
[1:07:58] the way that I feed them the way that
[1:08:00] they gather it up is going to decide
[1:08:02] whether or not they are True Believers
[1:08:04] or not
[1:08:05] how they gather the food
[1:08:07] is going to determine who's going to
[1:08:08] walk in my law or not and this is a test
[1:08:11] right where they live folks this is
[1:08:12] right down this is home cooking he
[1:08:14] didn't ask them to go start a new
[1:08:16] ministry he didn't ask him to go give
[1:08:18] all their money away he didn't ask them
[1:08:20] to to give all their wealth away he
[1:08:22] didn't ask them to sacrifice all their
[1:08:23] cattle he asked them to do one little
[1:08:25] thing
[1:08:26] he asked him to do one little thing and
[1:08:28] he says this is going to prove Who You
[1:08:30] Are
[1:08:32] it reminded me as I was reading it of of
[1:08:34] the the parable of the talents in
[1:08:36] Matthew 25 and it said so he that have
[1:08:39] received five talents came and brought
[1:08:42] other five talents saying Lord thou
[1:08:44] deliverest unto me five talents behold
[1:08:46] I've gained beside them five talents
[1:08:48] more and as lord said unto him well done
[1:08:51] thou good and faithful servant thou Hast
[1:08:54] been Faithful over a few things I will
[1:08:56] make the ruler over many things enter
[1:08:59] thou into the joy of the Lord
[1:09:02] I believe God has gifts and blessings
[1:09:04] and Supernatural events for every single
[1:09:07] person in this congregation
[1:09:10] every single one of us
[1:09:12] but you'll notice so often that before
[1:09:14] you get the big things you have to be
[1:09:16] faithful in the small things
[1:09:17] and God will put a little test in front
[1:09:19] of you
[1:09:20] we say I wanna I wanna be blessed in the
[1:09:23] kingdom of God I want to do great things
[1:09:24] for the kingdom of God I have so much to
[1:09:27] offer and God says well I put something
[1:09:29] little in front of you do that
[1:09:32] because you've got to prove yourself
[1:09:33] faithful in the little things before you
[1:09:35] get into the big things amen if I want
[1:09:38] to do something for God I've got to use
[1:09:40] what he's given me now
[1:09:42] and when I proved myself faithful in
[1:09:44] that and if I stay humble then he'll add
[1:09:46] to it
[1:09:47] and if I stay humble in that then he'll
[1:09:50] add to it again and I'll go as far in
[1:09:52] the kingdom of God as I can humble
[1:09:54] myself
[1:09:56] that's the only requirement use what
[1:09:58] he's given and stay humble you do that
[1:10:02] and God will put you at the Pinnacle of
[1:10:03] his kingdom
[1:10:04] that's all he's looking for amen but it
[1:10:07] takes time and it takes proving amen and
[1:10:09] it's God putting me in it's God putting
[1:10:11] you through the ringer testing you to
[1:10:13] make sure that you're going to stay
[1:10:14] humble and that you're going to stay
[1:10:15] true to what he's asked you to do no
[1:10:17] matter the circumstances we don't jump
[1:10:19] to the top of the pyramid in God's
[1:10:21] economy you have to be proven
[1:10:23] listen he prophesied what Joseph was
[1:10:26] going to be and then he put Joseph
[1:10:27] through 17 years of hell
[1:10:30] he told David he was going to rule as
[1:10:32] King David having never asked for it and
[1:10:34] then he put David through 15 years of
[1:10:36] running before Saul
[1:10:39] he put Joseph or he put Moses
[1:10:42] through 40 years in the desert
[1:10:45] to mold him and break him down so that
[1:10:47] God could finally come and use him
[1:10:49] listen even Jesus had to be proved
[1:10:53] Jesus wasn't just born and immediately
[1:10:55] was blessed with the Holy Spirit and the
[1:10:58] way he was in the baptism of John but he
[1:11:00] was forced to go into the desert and he
[1:11:02] was forced to be tried and tempted and
[1:11:04] when he passed that then he had to go to
[1:11:06] a mount Transfiguration and there God
[1:11:07] gave him his full adoption
[1:11:10] so if Christ had to be proven if Christ
[1:11:12] had to be put through trials and Moses
[1:11:14] and Joseph and David then don't think
[1:11:15] that we're going to do any different
[1:11:16] we've got to be proven amen
[1:11:19] you see sometimes you you get maybe
[1:11:21] these young men in particular and they
[1:11:23] go to a great school they go to Harvard
[1:11:24] they go to Yale and they come out and
[1:11:26] they have this wonderful degree
[1:11:29] and they think that because I have a
[1:11:30] degree from a great University I should
[1:11:33] be put into a position of great
[1:11:34] responsibility at a company and they
[1:11:36] think they should be the CEO they think
[1:11:38] they should be a big shot they think
[1:11:39] they should be a manager right out of
[1:11:40] school
[1:11:41] and what happens is they go in and
[1:11:44] because they have no character but they
[1:11:45] have an education they can't even hold
[1:11:47] that job down much less be a CEO amen
[1:11:50] that's why a strong work ethic will get
[1:11:52] you further than a nice piece of paper
[1:11:53] every single time I never worried too
[1:11:56] much about what school I went to for my
[1:11:57] engineering degree listen I could go to
[1:12:00] to the best university in Canada and in
[1:12:02] the end if I can't come out and apply it
[1:12:04] and I can't have the right work ethic
[1:12:05] I'm not going to be a good engineer no
[1:12:07] matter what
[1:12:08] but if you come out thinking that
[1:12:09] because you got something that you're
[1:12:11] going to be something then you're
[1:12:13] severely going to be very sad you're
[1:12:15] going to be very disappointed in these
[1:12:17] things amen how many of us have worked
[1:12:19] in a job maybe the older ones amongst us
[1:12:21] and somebody comes in and thinks they're
[1:12:22] so great and they're so smart and guess
[1:12:25] what they can't even last a month
[1:12:27] because it takes a work ethic it takes
[1:12:29] Integrity it takes consistency it takes
[1:12:31] dependency it takes somebody that really
[1:12:34] is committed to their job to go through
[1:12:36] the proving time to get to the good
[1:12:38] times because what do you do with a with
[1:12:40] a new employee
[1:12:42] first thing you do is you give them a
[1:12:43] simple task and you say go do it
[1:12:47] and if they can't humble themselves to
[1:12:48] the simple test they're never going to
[1:12:50] get to the next thing or the next thing
[1:12:51] if they can't do the basics you're never
[1:12:54] going to give them any more
[1:12:54] responsibility amen and so what God's
[1:12:57] saying is here is he says I'm going to
[1:12:59] give them a little law
[1:13:01] and it's going to be a test to see if
[1:13:03] they can keep that little one whether
[1:13:05] they'll obey me when we get down the
[1:13:06] road to the big stuff because if you
[1:13:08] can't obey me in a little law what are
[1:13:10] you going to do when we get to Canaan
[1:13:11] you've got to follow my leadership as we
[1:13:13] take over that if you can't do what I
[1:13:15] say here in the wilderness when nobody's
[1:13:16] bothering you and there's no pressure on
[1:13:19] you
[1:13:20] then how's it going to work when we get
[1:13:22] to when we get to Jericho
[1:13:24] if you can't if you can't obey me here
[1:13:26] you'll never obey me when we get to
[1:13:27] Jericho because I've got very specific
[1:13:29] instructions waiting for you so we're
[1:13:31] going to give you a little instructions
[1:13:32] to see if you follow that and if you
[1:13:34] can't do that then you're not going to
[1:13:35] make it to the land
[1:13:37] what are our little test Church
[1:13:39] it's always the basics
[1:13:41] and yet that's so often where we trip up
[1:13:43] what are the basics
[1:13:45] dress right
[1:13:46] live right listen to the right music be
[1:13:50] faithful in devotions faithful and
[1:13:51] church attendance faithful and ties and
[1:13:53] offerings faithful to help when there's
[1:13:55] a need faithful in Fellowship
[1:13:57] these are just basics of the Christian
[1:13:59] walk and God says if you can't do that
[1:14:01] you'll never be anything in this Kingdom
[1:14:05] because if you can't do the little
[1:14:07] things how am I going to trust you with
[1:14:08] the big things
[1:14:10] we're sitting there so often we say I
[1:14:12] have so much to offer
[1:14:14] and God's saying yeah just do the little
[1:14:16] things first
[1:14:17] prove yourself in the little things and
[1:14:19] then we'll get to the big things
[1:14:21] I'm not going to go into details I'm
[1:14:22] going to I'm going to tell on myself for
[1:14:24] a little bit
[1:14:25] but I've been preaching on something
[1:14:27] recently
[1:14:28] and it was very direct
[1:14:30] it's very specific and I knew why it was
[1:14:32] I knew who it was for
[1:14:35] and I finished that service
[1:14:38] and the next day
[1:14:41] the Lord said he says that was a great
[1:14:43] sermon
[1:14:45] when are you going to do it
[1:14:48] yeah
[1:14:49] now let me tell you
[1:14:51] it's not that I wasn't doing it it's
[1:14:54] that what I was doing was 80 percent
[1:14:57] and he wanted a hundred percent
[1:15:00] okay sometimes we think oh I'm doing it
[1:15:03] but are you doing it the way he wants
[1:15:04] you to do it are you doing it with all
[1:15:06] your body Soul might and strength amen
[1:15:09] and so he said your city you're standing
[1:15:11] there and you're preaching and you know
[1:15:13] who that's for he says but you're only
[1:15:14] at 80 in that area yourself he says are
[1:15:17] you going to give that up are you going
[1:15:18] to let me have full control in that area
[1:15:20] of your life
[1:15:23] church I might be up here saying the
[1:15:25] words but he still holds me accountable
[1:15:27] the same way
[1:15:28] and so I had to do that and I had to
[1:15:30] humble myself and I had to say Lord
[1:15:31] you're right I've been trying to control
[1:15:33] that I've been trying to hold that too
[1:15:34] much I'll give that to you a hundred
[1:15:36] percent and as soon as I did within two
[1:15:39] weeks he had completely met the thing
[1:15:42] that I was trying to fight back
[1:15:44] the thing that I was trying to hold the
[1:15:46] thing that I was trying to control he
[1:15:48] had met the need he had taken control of
[1:15:50] the situation completely and above and
[1:15:52] beyond whatever I could ask or think it
[1:15:54] was pressed down shaken a measure
[1:15:55] flowing out into my life the need that I
[1:15:58] had that I was trying to control by
[1:15:59] holding back on God
[1:16:03] just the little things sometimes that
[1:16:05] are holding us back
[1:16:07] I'm less stressed now
[1:16:09] having given it up and given it back to
[1:16:11] him than I was trying to control it
[1:16:14] that's what I'm trying to let you hear
[1:16:16] give them the little things
[1:16:19] give them the little things and they'll
[1:16:21] watch the big things roll in after it
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:25] look at this little test that God gives
[1:16:27] them
[1:16:29] he says and it shall come to pass
[1:16:32] that on the sixth day they shall prepare
[1:16:35] what they bring in and it shall be twice
[1:16:37] as much as they gather daily so he said
[1:16:40] they're good they're supposed to gather
[1:16:41] a certain amount every day based on how
[1:16:42] much they eat he said but on the Friday
[1:16:45] they're supposed to gather twice as much
[1:16:50] he didn't explain it
[1:16:52] he just said do it
[1:16:54] he didn't say here's why you need to
[1:16:56] gather twice as much on Friday as you do
[1:16:59] any other day of the week he said just
[1:17:01] do it
[1:17:03] no explanation and so Moses and Aaron
[1:17:06] said to all the children of Israel and
[1:17:07] even then you shall know that the Lord
[1:17:09] hath brought you out from the land of
[1:17:10] Egypt and in the morning ye shall see
[1:17:12] the glory of the Lord for that he
[1:17:14] heareth your murmurines against the Lord
[1:17:16] and what are we that ye murmur against
[1:17:18] us Moses reminding them that they're
[1:17:21] complaining against God
[1:17:23] but they're speaking to the ministry
[1:17:24] listen Ministry make mistakes sometimes
[1:17:26] we deserve the complaining but in this
[1:17:28] case they were complaining against the
[1:17:30] Lord God Almighty that was leading them
[1:17:31] and guiding them Moses said why are you
[1:17:33] coming to us with this
[1:17:35] he's the one that's LED you he's a great
[1:17:37] provider he's Jehovah Jireh why are you
[1:17:39] yelling at us
[1:17:41] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying I
[1:17:44] have heard the murmurings of the
[1:17:46] children of Israel so speak unto them
[1:17:48] saying that even ye shall eat flesh and
[1:17:51] in the morning you shall be filled with
[1:17:53] bread and ye shall know that I am the
[1:17:55] Lord your God
[1:17:59] watch this now because he's going to use
[1:18:00] his provision to prove who's really
[1:18:03] a believer he says it came to pass that
[1:18:06] at even the quails came and covered the
[1:18:08] camp and in the morning the Doula round
[1:18:10] about the host
[1:18:11] and when the Dew that lay was gone up
[1:18:13] behold upon the face of the Wilderness
[1:18:16] there lay a small round thing as small
[1:18:18] as the frost on the ground
[1:18:21] and when the children of Israel saw it
[1:18:23] they said one to another it is manna for
[1:18:25] they whis not what it was and Moses said
[1:18:28] unto them this is the bread which the
[1:18:31] Lord had given you to eat
[1:18:34] do you know what Manna means
[1:18:36] Manna means what is it
[1:18:39] the definition of God's provision was
[1:18:42] what is this
[1:18:44] it's the weirdest name I've ever heard
[1:18:46] of it's a question
[1:18:47] it's defined by a question I don't know
[1:18:50] what God's provision is
[1:18:53] sometimes we don't realize what God's
[1:18:54] provision is when it's standing in front
[1:18:57] of us staring us straight in the face
[1:18:58] and we're saying what is it
[1:19:00] I don't know
[1:19:03] I don't recognize it it's new to me I've
[1:19:05] never seen this before
[1:19:09] if you understand that you don't have to
[1:19:10] recognize it to benefit from it
[1:19:13] you'll go a lot further in life and your
[1:19:16] walk with God because sometimes what he
[1:19:18] brings in front of you doesn't look like
[1:19:19] the answer until you get into the
[1:19:22] situation and you realize this was God
[1:19:24] all along
[1:19:25] now I'm going to read this story and
[1:19:27] it's a familiar story
[1:19:28] but I want you to catch this idea
[1:19:30] because remember the children of Israel
[1:19:32] are hungry
[1:19:33] and sometimes we get to the point where
[1:19:35] we've given a lot
[1:19:37] and then what happens is we think that's
[1:19:39] all God requires us for us to give a lot
[1:19:42] but then God comes behind and he says
[1:19:45] give it all
[1:19:46] empty it out
[1:19:48] give me everything you've got
[1:19:50] and then Watch What Happens
[1:19:52] and brother Branham tells a story of the
[1:19:55] widow woman with the little child that
[1:19:57] came and had to had to give the meal and
[1:20:00] the oil to the prophet and make him a
[1:20:01] cake but I want to read this through
[1:20:03] just to kind of set this and we're going
[1:20:05] to be closing shortly it's a long set of
[1:20:07] quotes but I tried to cut it down and I
[1:20:09] said this is too good not to share the
[1:20:11] whole thing so just stick with me as we
[1:20:13] go amen because remember we're looking
[1:20:15] at something that God asked them to do
[1:20:16] without explaining it
[1:20:19] and sometimes that's the way it is with
[1:20:21] God is that you'll get an unction you'll
[1:20:23] get a leadership you'll get a conviction
[1:20:24] to do something and you don't understand
[1:20:26] why it's so extreme you don't understand
[1:20:28] why you have to give so much you don't
[1:20:31] understand why God's asking you when the
[1:20:32] person next to you could do it so much
[1:20:34] better that has way more energy way more
[1:20:36] time way more money way more gift
[1:20:38] whatever it is and God comes to you and
[1:20:40] he lays it on your lap and he says I
[1:20:42] need this from you
[1:20:44] listen to this
[1:20:46] program says this woman was a widow
[1:20:48] woman the drought was in the land and
[1:20:50] she'd started out after death of her
[1:20:52] husband she had a little baby to raise
[1:20:54] she was struggling to try and make a
[1:20:56] living for the little fellow and finally
[1:20:58] the bread began to cease and it come to
[1:21:00] a place one day when she went in to look
[1:21:02] at her little fellow she's seen his
[1:21:04] little sleeves out torn
[1:21:06] she might have looked at herself in the
[1:21:07] mirror and seen how she'd left the table
[1:21:09] with something on it for the baby and
[1:21:11] her own cheekbones was sticking out and
[1:21:13] her little frail looking arms she didn't
[1:21:15] mind it for herself but the little boy
[1:21:18] she was trying she didn't want to see
[1:21:20] him die
[1:21:22] so finally one day she went to the meal
[1:21:24] barrel and there was just one handful of
[1:21:26] meal left she goes over to the cruise to
[1:21:29] see how much oil and just about a good
[1:21:31] tablespoonful that stood between her and
[1:21:34] death
[1:21:35] I suppose that night there was an
[1:21:37] all-night prayer meeting
[1:21:39] he says isn't it strange how God lets us
[1:21:42] get right down to the end of the road
[1:21:45] the question is at the end of the road
[1:21:48] do we turn to complaining or do we turn
[1:21:49] to an all-night prayer meeting
[1:21:52] he says no doubt but she checked up
[1:21:56] said Lord God I've served you I've done
[1:21:58] all that I know how to do I've met your
[1:22:02] requirements and here I've got one
[1:22:04] handful of meal and a spoonful of oil
[1:22:06] between death for Child by child and
[1:22:09] myself he says all night long she must
[1:22:11] have prayed
[1:22:13] and the woman as she's seen that crucial
[1:22:15] hour coming no doubt she checked up and
[1:22:18] said Lord I've done all that I know how
[1:22:20] to do
[1:22:21] listen if you're at that place have
[1:22:24] faith
[1:22:25] have faith having done all to stare and
[1:22:28] stand as we said last service
[1:22:30] when you've done everything that you
[1:22:32] know how to do and met every requirement
[1:22:35] that God has required that's where Faith
[1:22:39] takes hold that's where faith comes in
[1:22:41] if you've met every requirement that God
[1:22:44] required you to do then sometimes God
[1:22:46] tests your faith to see what kind of a
[1:22:49] reaction you'll have on your action he
[1:22:52] said oh he's good at that it just proves
[1:22:54] whether you really believe what you
[1:22:57] think you believe
[1:22:58] you know he does that many times
[1:23:02] she was certain she'd walked up right
[1:23:04] before God and God proved it by inviting
[1:23:08] his Prophet to live with her
[1:23:12] she has nothing and now she's bringing
[1:23:15] God's bringing another mouth to feed
[1:23:19] see he says God confirms things so the
[1:23:23] morning was breaking the birds were
[1:23:25] beginning to sing as Dom began to break
[1:23:27] she looked at that little fellow again
[1:23:28] she patted him she knelt down and said
[1:23:30] Lord God he will be getting up in a few
[1:23:33] minutes I'll go and prepare the last
[1:23:35] thing I got and give it to who him
[1:23:38] and then I'll take him in my arms and
[1:23:41] we'll die together so she went and got
[1:23:43] the handful of meal he says now meal was
[1:23:46] a me it was now meal was a meal offering
[1:23:49] which means Christ the word
[1:23:51] she went to the last bit of the word
[1:23:53] that she could have
[1:23:56] she tried all of it
[1:23:58] she'd used it all up she's down to her
[1:24:00] last scripture she's down to her last
[1:24:02] thread of Hope
[1:24:04] and when they ground the meal offering
[1:24:06] in the days of the Bible they used a
[1:24:07] certain Burr that ground every little
[1:24:09] bit bit of meal just exactly the same
[1:24:12] there was no difference in it no
[1:24:14] difference in size he says well that
[1:24:16] types this the same means that Jesus
[1:24:19] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:24:21] forever when God ground his life out of
[1:24:24] him at Calvary he gave it to the church
[1:24:26] that he'd be the same yesterday today
[1:24:28] and forever
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:32] then she goes and gets the oil the oil
[1:24:35] represents the spirit that's why we
[1:24:37] anoint with oil it represents the spirit
[1:24:39] and she put the oil and the meal
[1:24:41] together and begin to prepare it now
[1:24:44] catch this he says and when the spirit
[1:24:46] and the word gets together something's
[1:24:50] going to take place
[1:24:52] the word on its own isn't going to do it
[1:24:55] because the letter killeth but you put
[1:24:57] the cricketing power of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:59] to you that it is yours that it belongs
[1:25:01] to you that the promises of God are
[1:25:03] yelling amen for my life not just yours
[1:25:06] now something's going to happen
[1:25:08] he says she was at the end
[1:25:11] so she got the word and the spirit and
[1:25:14] began to mix it together now she he said
[1:25:17] it's ready for baking she goes out in
[1:25:19] the yard to pick up two sticks did you
[1:25:21] notice the Bible said two sticks
[1:25:24] you take two sticks and cross them and
[1:25:26] you put the fire right in the middle and
[1:25:28] as the sticks burn you push them in if
[1:25:30] you're out camping at night it keeps the
[1:25:32] fire going all night long pushing it in
[1:25:34] if the fire was in the middle he says if
[1:25:37] you notice those two sticks represented
[1:25:39] the cross he says self sacrifice
[1:25:42] he says now she'd mix the word and the
[1:25:45] spirit together and was ready to put it
[1:25:47] on the fire and she goes to pick up
[1:25:48] those sticks and perhaps she got the
[1:25:51] last one in her hand and was starting
[1:25:52] back in the house and she looked at the
[1:25:55] gate
[1:25:56] she's got everything she needs to
[1:25:57] prepare her last meal before she dies
[1:26:01] there was a gentle looking old man
[1:26:03] perhaps bald-headed Whiskers hanging
[1:26:06] down standing leaning across the gate
[1:26:08] he said would you fetch me just a little
[1:26:11] drink of water
[1:26:12] she looked at him and thought well I've
[1:26:14] got just about half a gallon in the
[1:26:16] house but the poor old fella looks so
[1:26:18] thirsty I'd be willing to divide it with
[1:26:21] him
[1:26:22] and she might have said yes kind sir
[1:26:23] I'll get you a little of the water
[1:26:25] because the Springs have dried up and
[1:26:26] everything all Waters has dried up and
[1:26:29] she started in to get the water it says
[1:26:32] and he knew
[1:26:34] listen to what brother Brown says now
[1:26:37] he says you see God answers on both ends
[1:26:41] of the line see so often we're sitting
[1:26:44] there we're saying I've got a need I've
[1:26:46] got a need I've got a need Lord help me
[1:26:48] Lord help me
[1:26:50] and he says God answers your need by
[1:26:53] sending you somebody with a need because
[1:26:56] you're going to be the answer to their
[1:26:58] need and they're going to be the answer
[1:26:59] to your need but you're going to have to
[1:27:01] give up what you have so you can get
[1:27:03] what they have
[1:27:06] he says about two hours before that the
[1:27:08] brook had dried up on top of the
[1:27:10] mountain where Elijah was he said Elijah
[1:27:12] go down to the city and keep walking
[1:27:14] until you find a woman with two sticks
[1:27:16] in her hand she's going to feed you
[1:27:19] he says God does things real
[1:27:24] this isn't just Theory this isn't just
[1:27:26] spirituality we don't walk around in a
[1:27:29] in a world of of clouds of ease and
[1:27:31] fairy tales it's real real struggles
[1:27:34] real pain real trials real hardships
[1:27:37] real loss
[1:27:39] real disappointment
[1:27:41] but he says God does things real and
[1:27:44] sometimes to get real he's got to strip
[1:27:46] us down to nothing
[1:27:47] to get us down to the bare Bedrock of
[1:27:50] our foundation with God so he can come
[1:27:52] in and build on that
[1:27:53] and give us a blessing that we can't we
[1:27:56] can't we can't contain
[1:27:57] he said I've sent you down there and
[1:27:59] she's going to feed you she hasn't got
[1:28:02] nothing in the house but I'm going to
[1:28:04] feed you and he walked down the street
[1:28:06] till he saw that woman packing those two
[1:28:08] sticks and that must be her
[1:28:11] so he had to catch your attention he
[1:28:12] said would you fetch me a little water
[1:28:14] she said I will
[1:28:17] now catch this now because she's got
[1:28:20] lots of water compared to the meal in
[1:28:22] the oil
[1:28:23] he asks her for something that is rare
[1:28:25] but that she has enough to share
[1:28:28] and she says I will
[1:28:31] listen to this next bit
[1:28:34] it said and as she turned and started he
[1:28:37] said and
[1:28:40] the and is the Killer
[1:28:42] every time
[1:28:45] give me what you're willing to share
[1:28:48] and then give me what you can't afford
[1:28:50] to share
[1:28:53] and
[1:28:55] God doesn't want what we're willing to
[1:28:57] give
[1:28:58] he wants to get he wants what we don't
[1:29:00] want to give
[1:29:01] that we can't afford to give that's too
[1:29:04] much
[1:29:06] the and was the killer here the and is
[1:29:08] her test it says and just bring me a
[1:29:12] little morsel of bread in your hand
[1:29:15] that's such a small thing to ask
[1:29:17] sometimes
[1:29:18] but when that's the last thing that that
[1:29:20] person has
[1:29:21] when you're asking for their last little
[1:29:23] bit of patience
[1:29:24] their last little bit of love their last
[1:29:26] little bit of consideration the last
[1:29:28] little bit of time
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:31] when it's asked of us what do we do
[1:29:33] remember you've probably seen the
[1:29:35] picture it's been around a long time it
[1:29:36] says I've got one nerve left and you're
[1:29:37] getting on it
[1:29:39] what do you do when God says
[1:29:41] somebody needs that last nerve now
[1:29:44] that last shred of patience that last
[1:29:47] bit of composure that last bit of time
[1:29:50] that last night that you had free that
[1:29:53] last day in your week that you thought
[1:29:54] you could relax and now somebody has
[1:29:56] need
[1:29:57] what are you going to do now
[1:30:01] he says Elijah seen that Vision already
[1:30:04] knew what the condition was he knew what
[1:30:06] he was asking of her
[1:30:08] and she said as the Lord liveth Elijah
[1:30:11] knew she was a Christian then a Believer
[1:30:13] as the Lord liveth I've only got a
[1:30:16] handful of meal and a spoonful of oil
[1:30:17] that I've already prepared I've dressed
[1:30:20] it got it ready and I'm going to take
[1:30:22] these two sticks to make a little cake
[1:30:23] for my son and I we're going to eat it
[1:30:26] and die
[1:30:28] now you think as the prophet he would
[1:30:31] say I understand
[1:30:34] that's really heartbreaking
[1:30:37] I shouldn't ask this of you
[1:30:40] but listen when somebody has a need they
[1:30:42] have a need
[1:30:44] and us being on our last nerve
[1:30:47] doesn't mean that the need is going to
[1:30:48] go away
[1:30:50] the need is the need and the need has to
[1:30:52] be met
[1:30:53] and so he doesn't back away and say
[1:30:55] that's okay I'll go ask somebody else
[1:30:59] he says see now here comes a great
[1:31:02] lesson Elijah said bake me one first
[1:31:07] heartless old Prophet crotchety old man
[1:31:10] selfish
[1:31:13] take the bread out of a child's mouth we
[1:31:15] talk about stealing the candy out of a
[1:31:16] baby he was stealing candy from a baby
[1:31:19] he was stealing the last bit of food
[1:31:21] from a baby's mouth and a young Widow
[1:31:26] but he did it brother Brown says by
[1:31:27] vision
[1:31:28] knowing what would happen if she did it
[1:31:31] he says oh what is it there what lesson
[1:31:33] do we learn seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:31:36] God and his righteousness
[1:31:38] bake me one first and she looks she said
[1:31:41] I wonder who that is there's something
[1:31:43] about that man that seems to be
[1:31:45] different
[1:31:46] and he said make me one first and bring
[1:31:48] it
[1:31:50] now listen to this it says and she
[1:31:52] started in to do what he said
[1:31:56] then
[1:31:58] it wasn't until she agreed to do it that
[1:32:01] she heard what she needed to hear
[1:32:03] then and only then she heard that
[1:32:06] comforting word that always comforts
[1:32:08] he said for thus saith the Lord
[1:32:11] the barrel will not be empty nor the
[1:32:14] crews run dry until the day that God
[1:32:17] sends rain on the Earth
[1:32:21] what was it
[1:32:23] he says that very dark crucial moment
[1:32:26] come but God's always on the scene if
[1:32:30] you're sure that it's God if you've
[1:32:31] repented of your sins if you've met
[1:32:33] God's requirement then be sure that God
[1:32:36] will keep his promise
[1:32:38] who he says if men and women could only
[1:32:41] realize that God is obligated to his
[1:32:43] promise and if you've met his
[1:32:45] requirements if you confessed your sins
[1:32:47] and you've made your rungs right and
[1:32:50] you've done everything God has required
[1:32:52] then hold on to God you've got to see
[1:32:57] daylight he's got to bring it through
[1:33:00] just be certain that it's God and he
[1:33:03] will take care of the rest of it if
[1:33:06] you're sure that it's God
[1:33:09] Church let's not miss the answer to our
[1:33:11] prayers
[1:33:11] because it's asking us to give
[1:33:13] everything we have in order to gain
[1:33:15] everything that we need
[1:33:18] let's not miss that sometimes we need to
[1:33:21] sacrifice that last little bit before
[1:33:23] God pours out the blessing that we're
[1:33:24] looking for
[1:33:26] it's the little things so often that
[1:33:27] he's asking for it's just the little
[1:33:29] things amen
[1:33:31] God's saying and what he told him what
[1:33:33] he was telling the children of Israel
[1:33:34] just do what I ask
[1:33:35] and Trust
[1:33:37] you don't always have to understand you
[1:33:39] don't always have to know you don't
[1:33:40] always have to see the end game The End
[1:33:41] Road you don't always have to see what
[1:33:43] I'm doing but you have to be instant in
[1:33:45] season
[1:33:46] so that when the holy spirit moves with
[1:33:48] it when God starts talking when God
[1:33:50] starts leading you can drop right into
[1:33:51] his will regardless of what he's asking
[1:33:53] you to do amen
[1:33:56] the answer is on the way and sometimes
[1:33:57] even though you feel you've given your
[1:33:59] all yet God says there's more to give
[1:34:02] but in the end of it you're going to be
[1:34:03] happy you did it
[1:34:05] back to the children of Israel in Exodus
[1:34:07] 16 says it came to pass it on the sixth
[1:34:09] day they gathered twice as much bread
[1:34:11] two omers for one man and all the rulers
[1:34:13] of the congregation came and told Moses
[1:34:15] so many obeyed
[1:34:17] and he said unto them this is that which
[1:34:19] the Lord said so he says here's why God
[1:34:21] told you to do it tomorrow is the rest
[1:34:23] of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord Becky
[1:34:26] what you will bake today and seethe what
[1:34:28] you will see and that which remaineth
[1:34:30] over lay up for you to be kept until the
[1:34:33] morning
[1:34:34] now remember Moses tells him why they
[1:34:36] had to gather it but I want you to
[1:34:37] realize that these people were now
[1:34:39] experienced with manna
[1:34:42] by the time the sixth day rolled around
[1:34:44] they had seen what happened to men if
[1:34:46] you kept it overnight
[1:34:48] what happened it got wormy it rotted it
[1:34:52] stank
[1:34:53] so they've had six five days of do of
[1:34:56] experience with the supernatural
[1:34:59] and then God says yeah but gather twice
[1:35:02] as much
[1:35:03] and so people were there sitting and
[1:35:05] said I know better than God I've got
[1:35:07] experience with the things of God I'm
[1:35:10] not going to do it because it's just
[1:35:11] gonna stink and get rotted
[1:35:13] but God had told them to do it
[1:35:16] but they didn't do it because they
[1:35:18] thought they knew better than God
[1:35:20] now watch this it says and they laid it
[1:35:23] up till the morning as Moses bade and it
[1:35:25] did not stink neither was there any worm
[1:35:28] therein
[1:35:29] so somehow supernaturally God baked the
[1:35:31] Manna a little different on that Friday
[1:35:34] so that on Saturday morning it was still
[1:35:36] good to eat
[1:35:37] but everyone that thought they knew
[1:35:39] better was sitting there with nothing
[1:35:42] and they went hungry that first Sabbath
[1:35:46] it says and Moses said eat that today
[1:35:47] for today is the Sabbath unto the Lord
[1:35:49] today you shall not find it in the field
[1:35:51] six days ye shall gather it but on the
[1:35:53] seventh day which is the Sabbath in it
[1:35:55] there shall be none
[1:35:56] verse 27 says and it came to pass that
[1:35:59] there went out some of the people on the
[1:36:00] seventh day four to gather and they
[1:36:02] found none
[1:36:04] God had told him to do it he didn't tell
[1:36:06] him why and then when it was too late he
[1:36:08] said here's why you're supposed to do it
[1:36:10] and this is going to carry you over
[1:36:11] through the Sabbath so you don't have to
[1:36:13] do any work you don't have to do any
[1:36:14] Gathering and I'll keep the food that
[1:36:16] I've given you
[1:36:18] and they went hungry because they
[1:36:20] refused to obey the word of God because
[1:36:21] they didn't understand it
[1:36:25] God doesn't tell us to understand
[1:36:27] you'll never find anywhere where he says
[1:36:28] you've got to understand it he says just
[1:36:31] believe it and Obey it that's it that's
[1:36:33] it the only requirement of the of the
[1:36:35] believer is to obey in faith amen
[1:36:39] and then God rolls he finishes it up he
[1:36:41] says and the Lord said unto Moses how
[1:36:44] long refuse ye to keep my Commandments
[1:36:47] and my laws
[1:36:49] God said if you can't do this how are we
[1:36:52] going to be friends
[1:36:53] how are we going to take over Canaan how
[1:36:55] are we going to push out the hivites and
[1:36:56] the parasites and the jebusites and all
[1:36:58] these different ones if you can't even
[1:37:00] obey me in terms of how to gather your
[1:37:02] food
[1:37:02] how are we going to make this work
[1:37:04] you're sitting here thinking we should
[1:37:06] be better off in in Egypt and we should
[1:37:08] have died back there and then when I
[1:37:10] give you a provision you won't even
[1:37:11] listen to me about how to use what I've
[1:37:13] given you
[1:37:14] what kind of faithless people are you
[1:37:17] I don't know if God gets disheartened
[1:37:19] because he doesn't have the emotions we
[1:37:20] do but I'm sure he wasn't happy
[1:37:23] this is not a happy statement how long
[1:37:25] refuse you to keep my Commandments and
[1:37:27] my laws it's only giving them two the
[1:37:29] Passover and this
[1:37:31] and circumcision
[1:37:32] that's it he says you can't even keep
[1:37:34] the little one
[1:37:37] sometimes what we're missing is we've
[1:37:39] got all the little things that are just
[1:37:41] not quite where they need to be and
[1:37:42] that's the only thing holding God back
[1:37:44] I'm a testimony that's literally in the
[1:37:46] last month
[1:37:47] the last month the little things if you
[1:37:49] do it then God will come in and he'll do
[1:37:50] the big things in your life
[1:37:54] listen to this
[1:37:56] brother Graham says if you will believe
[1:37:58] just be faithful with the little things
[1:38:01] God will show you great things believe
[1:38:03] him and God will do it amen let's Stand
[1:38:07] Together
[1:38:09] I mean I'm determined to not let the
[1:38:11] little things hold me back
[1:38:13] it's the little things it's it's amazing
[1:38:15] when you get into a relationship and
[1:38:17] those of you that are married know this
[1:38:18] is that you can't go through a marriage
[1:38:20] with big Grand demonstrations every
[1:38:23] month you do one good thing a month and
[1:38:25] then you ignore your spouse for the rest
[1:38:27] of the time you can't do that it's that
[1:38:29] day by day thing it's the little things
[1:38:31] that build into a great relationship
[1:38:33] it's that constant caring it's that
[1:38:35] constant love it's that constant
[1:38:37] consideration it's that constant
[1:38:38] sacrifice it's that constant molding and
[1:38:40] humbling that draws a couple together
[1:38:42] and it's no different than with the
[1:38:44] things of God that he calls us to do the
[1:38:46] little things
[1:38:48] and when he can trusts us with those
[1:38:49] little things now he says all right now
[1:38:51] we can build this into the bigger things
[1:38:53] now I can trust you nor now we can move
[1:38:55] into a higher sphere of responsibility
[1:38:57] now we can take you to a different
[1:38:59] Ministry now we can take you to a
[1:39:00] different role in the church now we can
[1:39:02] give you a spouse now we can let you go
[1:39:03] to university whatever the case may be
[1:39:05] but he's wanting to see those little
[1:39:07] things just the basics just the basics
[1:39:10] if we can take care of those amen
[1:39:13] we've been speaking on no turning back
[1:39:14] and that's maybe a bit of a weird topic
[1:39:17] but I want you to understand that when
[1:39:18] you don't take care of the little things
[1:39:20] and you say I'm better off doing the
[1:39:22] other things that's turning back
[1:39:25] when we refuse to obey the things that
[1:39:27] God's called us to do that's turning
[1:39:29] back
[1:39:30] and sometimes like I said it's because
[1:39:31] we don't understand and he hasn't told
[1:39:34] us to understand he's just told us to do
[1:39:35] it and the results will come and maybe
[1:39:38] later on you'll understand it
[1:39:40] that song says we'll understand it
[1:39:41] better by and by and I find that's the
[1:39:43] way it works
[1:39:45] is the further you go with God the more
[1:39:47] he reveals but he's not going to give
[1:39:48] you the whole story up front because
[1:39:49] otherwise why do you need faith
[1:39:51] because he's trying to build us up into
[1:39:53] a faith that'll take us off of this
[1:39:54] Earth amen
[1:39:56] we don't want to go back to the old way
[1:39:58] the old way of haphazard here a little
[1:40:01] there little in and out up and down and
[1:40:03] then we want to be consistent we want to
[1:40:04] be tight on the little things and trust
[1:40:06] that God will take us all the way
[1:40:07] through amen let's just bow our heads
[1:40:10] together
[1:40:10] Heavenly Father
[1:40:14] Lord we don't want anything to turn us
[1:40:15] back
[1:40:16] Lord I don't want to go back to Leading
[1:40:18] my own life Lord I don't want to go back
[1:40:20] to my own leadership I don't want to go
[1:40:22] back to my own thoughts or lower my isms
[1:40:25] my ideas my theologies but Lord I want
[1:40:27] to step out by faith into the power of
[1:40:29] the holy spirit in my own life Heavenly
[1:40:31] Father Lord and I believe each one
[1:40:33] that's gathered here tonight wants that
[1:40:36] but Lord we've got a flesh that doesn't
[1:40:38] Lord we've got a body that's lord it's
[1:40:41] it's doomed lord it's a body of death as
[1:40:44] Paul called it Lord and it fights us
[1:40:46] every day and Satan uses our mind and he
[1:40:49] tries to inject himself heavenly father
[1:40:50] to break us up over those little things
[1:40:53] Lord would you give us strength Lord
[1:40:55] would you grant us Grace day by day Lord
[1:40:57] to be concerned about the things that
[1:40:59] you care about Lord and we know you care
[1:41:01] about him because you told them to us
[1:41:02] and you gave them to us and you've
[1:41:04] called us to do them Heavenly Father
[1:41:06] Lord we don't want to be legalistic
[1:41:09] Lord we're not doing it because we're
[1:41:10] legalistic we're doing it because we
[1:41:12] love you and because we trust you
[1:41:14] Heavenly Father Lord help us to take
[1:41:16] care of those little things Lord to be
[1:41:18] faithful in those and trusting that if
[1:41:20] we do Lord you'll bring us into greater
[1:41:22] and bigger things in our lives
[1:41:24] Lord grant us Grace to Humble ourselves
[1:41:25] to your word
[1:41:27] Lord and minister to us now we pray
[1:41:29] in Jesus Christ's name we ask him
[1:41:32] amen
