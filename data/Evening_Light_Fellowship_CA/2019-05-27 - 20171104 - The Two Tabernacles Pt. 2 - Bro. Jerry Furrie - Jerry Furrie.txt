wasn't Avene I'm amazed at the price I chose to pay and think I ignored what really mattered cuz I thought the sacrifice would be too but when I finally reach the point of giving in I found the cross was calling even and even though we're trying to survive I've never felt so much [Music] for I am crucified with Christ not i but christ lives within me his cross will then engage oh it's not my string but he is there's no greater sacrifice I am crucified with Christ and yet as I hear the save a call for tea the time I will brown beneath the weight of Calvary then my hand surrender to his piercing purpose that holds me to the cross and sets me free [Music] I can't and with the suffering I identified and by His resurrection power crucify advice [Music] then for it's not my strength but he there's no better sacrifice for I am crucified with Christ and yet I will offer all I have so that is cross is not in there for I have found to live is Christ and to die is true I am crucified with rice and that i but christ lives within me his cross oh it's not my straight but he there's no greater sacrifice for I am crucified with Christ and not i but christ lives within me his cross will never us for more then [Music] for it's not my straight but he is there's no greater sacrifice [Music] Hey [Music] a man that was wonderful and this so true speaks to the speaks to the Christian experience doesn't it amen his cross will never ask for more than what they can give amen you know when you look at that sacrifice they'll really look what can you offer then oh yeah in ourselves were pretty fit we're pretty feeble aren't we pretty weak on our righteousness is as filthy rags thank God for His grace to us is all I could say because it just all this magnifies grace to me that's magnifies grace and it should bring us down more and more humble just so thankful for what God has done listen let's sing cover me it's 11:41 up there praise the Lord cover me [Music] [Music] Oh Oh

for us Lord father I pray that you'll just take the service tonight father speak to your people father I don't want to Lord project any of my own thoughts but I want to just project you father Lord Jesus is the mind of Christ has come down this day father I'm thankful for your grace for your mercy in our lives father I just want to know Lord that father this anybody needs to be touched here tonight father if you want to direct me a certain way lord I pray Lord that father you know how you yield to you you can direct me father granted I pray I asked us to the name of Jesus Christ God bless you Saints everybody fine tonight amen god bless you rest it for tonight you know friends the thing is is that if we have a good understanding of what the message is actually done for us in this day think about this John the Revelator everybody knows who John the Revelator is right well John the Revelator was at Calvary all right John the Revelator was in the upper room John the Revelator was with Jesus John the Revelator scene of many things but John the Revelator still wept and cried because nobody was able to take the book so all those things he seen but he still was weeping so understand friends this message of the hour the Lamb came forth took the book of Redemption and brought it down in whose hands as it is it's in our hands understand this friends John was in the upper room seeing Calvary seeing the empty tomb seen all those things seen the resurrection all those things but he's still wept and cried because nobody was worthy to take the book but our lamb was worthy his friends were in a day in an hour because you got to understand under the opening of the seventh seal comes forth again the mock Kazakh order back within our midst you know what that means that means we're in communion with him not just physically we'll get into this but it's nuts not physically but we're under the Melchizedek order under the opening of the seven seals it's actually true worship under the opening of the seven seals this is why friends the thing is is that two Tabernacles is the Levitical order or if I should say the denominational order or there's also the Melchizedek order understand France because what denominations are it's not taking the headship of the word anymore they booted him out of the church they've left him and I'm not just talking because you can be a one-man denomination see a one-man denomination will not take the headship of the word see friends but the bride she takes the headship of the word she doesn't have her own opinions she doesn't have her own mind she has the mind of Christ amen in this if you have your Bible turn to Revelation chapter five I just want to recap a little bit that we'll go into a little bit farther in this understanding that you know what God is actually doing within our midst in this day because like I says if you don't if you don't have an identity in the scriptures of yourself and who what God's called you to do friends it's hard to you know it's too abstract for you but we want concrete understanding of who we are where we come from not just by intellect but by revelation because we know the church is built by on Revelation amen let's read from verse eight and we had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood of a every kindred and tongue and people and nation he has made us us unto our God unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth in every seas now friends that's now that's not so much in the future that is now the scripture of course we know the book was closed and we know we understand in Revelations 10 was the opening was actually the mighty angel coming down spoke through a prophet understanding this friends if I and I hope you catch this is that we are the opening of the seven seals it's our life it's not something that is just in our thoughts or it's on pages is on tapes but it's actually in us because the breaking of the seals actually broke in your life and you're a part of the seven seals taking the book eat in the book and friends the thing is what it's actually happening you're finishing up the ministry of Jesus Christ and I know friends the thing is like I said last night many times people don't think they're important but we're all important is if we're in the body of Christ we all have a place we all have a position sometimes we think all who who really knows and who well I'm just a lazy person I said I'm church but let me say it this way friends if you know who you actually are what God can actually do with you is you can make you a mighty force in this end time now friends we all have our places we all families we got children's stuff like this and you know the father's a head of the home you've got a wife kids and stuff like this you got you there's something something you have to be doing with your family and to instill certain things in them and understand friends the thing is under the open of the seven seals there was a call that went forth it was a call for true worship true worship in spirit and truth because the thing is in today's way the denominations have gone we've seen all see the way they've gone but not not even just in the denominations it's in it's in the message now because the Prophet came along and says you know when in order for us to be actually have a power the bride I'm talking about is to be able to recognize that to spirits within the framework of a church see friends the thing is and every every every move of God there's always been twins and this is what I'm speaking about here tonight and I spoke about that last night is there was two for two Tabernacles or two forms of worship and one was ritualistic and one would go through the things because like I said last night when you looked at Abel and Cain Cain there was a lot of work he put into growing his garden but there's a lot of things he had to do and the thing is is that Abel all he had to go out in the field because he got a revelation gets the gets the lamb brings it in and sacrifices on the altar and the thing is is that it was something that was reflected in heaven and that's what the bride is actually doing she's actually reflecting something from heaven see we're sitting here tonight we're actually reflecting something from heaven it's not just our own doings it's not her just our own thoughts it's actually we're doing and we're reflecting something from God's mind and of course we are here tonight as the children of God we believe that we believe we're the bride of Jesus Christ all those different things but to have an understanding that we're actually there's a building going on right now it's called the body of Jesus Christ or the building of Jesus Christ now as I read last night the scriptures here 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 5 y'all we also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ first Peter first Peter chapter 2 verse 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people that should show forth the praises of him who have called you all the darkness into his marvelous light which in time past we are not a people but are now the people of God which have not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy now let's not just take things lightly because remember God wants expression in order to him for him to have expression he has that preeminence first thing he had to do was separate us from sin and death that's the first thing he had to do in order to get preeminence in us in order to give expression see the thing is is that it's all about the question of Jesus Christ now that's why I said last night the second coming of Jesus Christ is on earth right now we are it there's nobody else that we're looking for here this is this is the second coming of Jesus Christ and you know and we and sometimes some people just don't some people take that lightly or they don't really think about it but you imagine it's Jesus Christ in human flesh once again on earth now here's the characteristic of the brides that I was talking about last night one of the characteristics is that the eyes of your understanding will be enlightened he says that ye may know that the hope of his glory and what riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints so that's one of the characteristics of the bride she'll be initiated in the mysteries and once you know something it's simple right and you don't eat all mystery as a mystery but when the mysteries unveil its simple what you know what's behind it and if friends the thing is we are sitting here tonight and we've been initiated by the mysteries it's no longer a mystery to us it's a mystery in the in the denominations it's actually even sometimes a mystery amongst message people and the thing is is that things have not been actually opened up to them and some people don't believe that this see that seven seals been open see your friends the thing is is the seventh seal the seventh seal I think that's my phone don't worry to Africa but but there but the opening of the seventh seal some people don't believe the open sense beyond see it's not the first six seals that give such the problem or confusion it's the seventh seal and people when they're when they look at the seventh seal they look at it in a confusing way they try to study out they try to look at it this way look at that it's simple to me that I'm the unveiling of the seventh seal just like you are because revelations 10 see was to bring the seventh him him Christ the seventh seal bring him back to earth again and we know revelations 10 is the seventh seal I'm in that revelations 10 brother bran was in revelation Stan the mighty angels in revelations 10 we're all in together and friends a thing is what I'm speaking about tonight it's all around and we'll go look at this later later at the end of the service but the understanding this is that friends we're back in the Melchizedek order from it from not just our own thinking not our Pentecostal ideas on our Catholic ideas not our denominational ideas were we're actually being taken to a place called the Melchizedek order and many people say though well the son of man ministry III he will I know where I'm missing a minute and the rapture and all I have to do is sit there yeah you just sit there but you absorb what God is actually doing in your life because it's the workings of God through your life see it's that's why a lot of people they just don't see God work in their life and that's when they get backslidden that's when they get depressed that's when they look down on themselves and all those things and says where's God where where is this and we're and friends what they don't see is the working of a living God working actually through their life and that's why friends will thing is that's what you have to see that the word is made flesh like I said last last night is this day the Scriptures fulfilled in us see friends that's the opening of the Seventh Seal that it's actually been redeemed see there's the sing questions over the blood is already we know the blood was already a blood was already spread on the mercy seat we know friends that's not the question anymore the question is now can we meet the enemy of this hour and I say Amen I can overcome myself because that's the greatest enemy I can have Satan right beside me and he's not my greatest enemy my greatest enemies me brother Branham says my greatest enemy is William Marion brim you know why that is because we caught we carry this thing around and it gives us all kinds of problems see friends because the DNA that you've been heritage from your parents their stubbornness their pridefulness all things you inherited in brother bounces from your great-grandfather grandfather all the way down here all that junk into you and that's why friends it's a greater greater thing happening right now because when Jesus came here two thousand years ago he didn't inherit all that DNA because he was born from the father right see now he's on a work on human beings that have a lot of junk in them and they are going to be overcomers because the word says though they're going to be overcomers that's the promise to us that's part of our inheritance amen I'm going to mean overcome by the grace of Almighty God not by my will and I'm like I says he's gonna Pat me in the back at the end and say he did a really good job but it's been all him that's done it now watch this as I read this quote last night and just so we can kind of draw a foundation here he said let now let me read the rest of this so I can get it you right quick now the eighth verse he says when they had taken the book of the four beasts the twenty and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials of orders and prayers of the saints and now this is a time when everything must be worshipped now remember how appropriate now don't let us miss this now listen close when all the mysteries of the churches was finished which it is and all the mysteries of the plans were indention then seven seals was opened right immediately after this now look it's time for everything in heaven everything in earth to worship God now watch what takes place listen at it he says just this not this just a minute he says and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy listen what a worship was this was the elders the priests everything fell right before him see like I thought he says when he made his his complete plan it's a time of worship now listen he says listen them redeemed souls crying out there everything in heaven is worshiping the lamb so friends the thing is the Mount Zion as I was speaking a little bit last night mouths and of course nutria or Jerusalem or David actually brought the tabernacle of David back we all know that what happened is because James stands up in the first Church agent says no the the restoration is supposed to be the pattern Akal of David so the church ages was that was that was representing under tabernacle the wilderness Moses and then the tabernacle of David comes off and of course the millennium is going to be under the reign of Solomon so then we're honor living under the tabernacle of David and when you begin to begin to understand and get that in your mind it's not a real ritualistic form but it's actually a cathodic form of worship in other words friends were rejoicing praising everything that we were I was reading last night we're in where we're actually manifesting what actually David actually was doing in the Old Testament what James was saying that was going to be restored at this end time so we know that omit all the mysteries have been opened up we all know that but there's still two forms of systems working within the framework of the church there's the one that just goes to church ritualistic maybe has the dress rate has this rate has that right but there's no opening in their heart to actually have true worship back to God see and Friends of thing is that's one part of form of worship but it's not the worship that God is actually looking for see because what God is actually seeking for he's actually seeking for true worshipers he's not seeking people that are just ritualistic like a Pharisee not ritualistic like a sad you see or a Herodian he's actually looking for a seeking for a true were sure that's actually been birthed under the reveal word of this day now friends and I want to get this across to you real heavy here because the thing is is that the new birth is is the most necessary thing we need a born-again experience and it's going away by the wayside in the messages because every Bridge is piles in information and it's information information age and B let me just say it this way the way God's worked with a person 2,000 years ago as far when he brings them into a new birth and through an adoption through a process he works the same way tonight in this day and age we're in a technology type of age where we got computers we got the phones and all this and all this technology and we want to quick facts like this all the time but God doesn't work with men he didn't ever change his way the way he works with men he works with men the same ways who work 2,000 years ago see it's a process see that's why friends the thing is and many times when you talk about the rapture people think the rapture is something on on the outside of them but is not the rapture the rapture is inside see it's an actual many events in an individual's life that are actually taking taking a process in order to go in the rapture it's not something that's going to be one day it's gonna be lottery to hell my numbers come up I'm gonna go in the rapture it's not that we're actually in our process because like I said Enoch walked with with with God for 365 years he walked with God and friends the thing is is that it ain't always a process for you not the enoch baby get tired sometimes maybe he did maybe he made mistakes because a person went the holy ghost can still make mistakes but they want to get right with the Lord right away see that is a difference so wondering what God is looking for he's seeking for is a true worshiper now we read last night that Matthew 15 verse 8 he says and people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and artha me with their lips but their heart is far from me so but they they still worship they come to church clap their hands they still sing they still worship but they it but it's just with their lips it's not it's not reality to them it's not the Living God I achieve working in them but they're still teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so friends the thing is there so there's two forms of worship one will have the pillar of fire and one won't you realize this the third pole is it we know it's not a public show you realize they could be preaching here tonight and the person next to you might not begin and the other person right next year is getting it that's the way it works you just you I I'm not here to sort anything out it's not up to me it's up to God see friends the people gonna be sitting right in church service under the third pole preaching because part of the third pole preaching is preaching the lost and they can be hearing the pure word on dross and altering Word of God and they still cannot get it because they have no new birth in them no representation in them I can't do that I mean I can't do nothing both that so when gave up in the in the book of Acts and this is after this I'll return and I'll build again the tabernacle of David which is falling down I'll build again the runes thereof and I'll set it up and we know the class that I was saying the Pharisees were trying to get the Gentiles to come back under the law of God as far onto the Levitical order they were trying to get them to come back and in order to say that's where salvation is but the thing is is that when Jesus came he done away with a little bit of glory amen see them when the Levitical order was because what it was it was a Micah's order coming on the scene right now as we go see and understand this is that David would be like I was playing last night was prophet King and and preached well you didn't have that in the Old Testament that wasn't supposed to be a king wasn't supposed to be a priest but it actually was a type for us showing us that this Tabernacle were restored in this end time and you not being realized friends it was a one-room tent and priests could come in now in time knock on the waters Moses's Tabernacle they couldn't do what they could do what they could do then but what God wants in this day and age is a face to face communion because we're in a face-to-face age and what is that that's the presence of God in you the presence of God will never depart the bride once she is born again once she is saved by the presence of God but God German ties in that scene in you friends the thing is is that you're in a tent meeting with God himself and that's what the restoration of the tabernacle David was actually referring to because the thing is that you had the tent gimme on and you had the tent in in in the New Jerusalem if I could say it that way or in Jerusalem or the City of David or Mount Sion so he had two things right so and so in other words friends the thing is is that they're coming to Jerusalem it was this new form or a new order that Dave was actually bringing in now we had a prophet in this generation that actually brought in a new order it was not like any other order before it for the last 2,000 years see Jesus would he came he brought that new order in but the thing is is that they went by the way of denominational thinking or a little vertical type of thinking they have to do this and do that do this no we're here to freely worship God worship God without hinders I know our flesh gives us Enders but I'm talking about in rejoicing clapping worshiping God all those different things under the order of Melchizedek nation lism or the order of a little vehicle but under the order of Melchizedek this is why friends the thing is is that people when we look at all this tonight to understand that people are actually worshiping God false falsely and I'm not just talking me nomination systems I'm talking within the framework of the message amen they have a form of godliness but they're denying the very power that came in this day and that's why friends the thing is is that they're under a false pretense they're on the worshipping God on the outside they're like in the tabernacle the in the wilderness there's no Ark of the Covenant there no soul no let's just move on here and I'll just cover a couple things here and we'll move on to where I really want to get to tonight who was that then what did the veil rent remember it was death to go into nobody could see it most saw in the form it was a world it was a man's back well here it is a bleeding back the same man what was it God wanted to show them the mercy seat God wanted to show them who he was so the veil in the temple from the hand of God above was rent from top to bottom and show God in plain view it was Jesus Christ hanging on the cross the mercy seat now after after this now okay Ephesus the high priests and all the Jews and all those certain things they would still go to the temple but God did not recognize it there was no emergency there was no place to put the blood so I'd see what they were doing they're actually worshipping God by their imagination how many people come to church and actually worship of God by imagination because we're actually under the bleeding word amen while you're here tonight as a bleeding work and the bleeding word is what gives life see there's a bleeding word that is sprinkled on the people because remember when Moses came down he's put put it on the book and they had actually ate the juice at Amen before they got the blood sprinkled on them it was not just okay yeah I believe it but there was a death if they actually Amen the word and Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people because what was it it was a covenant he was making and that's happened in this day when people are actually yet the born-again experience really depth actually revelaed it in the depths of God see the blood is sprinkled on them now we'll get into tomorrow because the thing is as you walk in the light as he is in light then the blood covers you now remember friends the light is first and then the blood not the blood first and then the light you got to be walking in the light of the hour and if I ask you the question what is the light of the hour I might get how many people 20 30 40 people hear different answers you know what because what people think what the light is they think it's a message book they think it's a tape and I always get some message people just wait talking about no friends you got to know what the light is it's more than the tape and it's more than so understand those friends of thing is that we need the veil ripped to understand what we're actually worship see Jesus veil was ripped on the Calvary with the believer would know what they're worshiping but the Jews have built their whole system on things from the old tests and their whole root systems that the religion was built on worshiping Jehovah and the thing is that here's your wagon on the crop and they didn't recognizes no osseous st. John 2 and 19 Jesus answer sit on them destroy this temple and three days I'll raise it up so two temples like I said in the existence ain't done to High Priest is the same time - always always at the same time and the thing is so they were should be in the wrong place the Jews were because they there was a high priest named Jesus Christ who's touched by the feeling of our infirmities so you can come to church here tonight he knows how you're feeling because he was one of us one time he knows so we can actually take me cannot you touch him by the feeling of her in Fermi's we're not feel good her this doesn't and he knows what you're going through because he actually brought all those things into him when he was here on earth to be tempted of those things you realize brother man told us that Jesus was tempted by women he says he was tempted by alcohol he was tempted by all these damn things you know what friends he wasn't born that way because you didn't have all the DNA he had actually bring those things into him to know how you would feel see friends the thing is is that you were born in a body that has an addictive type of personalities and a lot of different things it could be gossipy it could be drinking it could be smoking give me all these things that are in your body and you're overconfident and God knows how you feel because he brought all those things into himself to know what it was like so you can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities oh yeah so watch the to dive around where the mercy was behind the veil Hebrews 10:19 having therefore brethren boldness enter in the hoist of the blood by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way what she had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh so he was actually making a new living way now remember this is the Melchizedek order get your mind away from any nomination order get your mind away from a little bit of order because the thing is is that God was actually bringing in a new order because remember the Old Testament they feared to going behind the veil but we want to vent we don't have to fear going in behind the veil and I know when the denominational churches go to church they read from the same Bible we do they cop sing gospel songs nothing there's good people in there I'm not trying to put them down they're good people nation in the nomination right but I understand this by God's grace we have been opened up to another order we've been actually a changing of an order in this day where we can actually worship under the opening of the Seventh Seal people don't get to get that in these denominations we get it we understand those things because why we're under new order and David when he came back to Jerusalem he brought a new organ a new preached a new order of worship all those things and Friends of things were brought into a new order being the bride Jesus Christ of worsley praising him without any hindrance but rejoice in all those different things friends the thing is by not the MAL Catholic order we have brought into that see friends it's not just something that is we can read about who's a schmuck as if we're in that order that's the order we're honor see because remember friends the thing is is that when David was brought the ark back what was he showing actually he was showing the falseness of of no Ark of the Covenant behind the Tabernacle in the wilderness when Jesus come and they rent the veil he was showing that there was no art looked on behind there it was false religion what do the seals do for us in this day and showed us the Antichrist system and show the Antichrist system for the last two thousand years under the denominational systems and all they were doing was false worship but when you read any shortest sort of opening of the seven seals he shows him a true worship is and we're under that call we didn't call back to that no he says this he says remember we have shown clearly all through the ages then even as out of these foul because they left the word soul Ephesian age felt by turning the sliding from the word until is every age continue to turn away we have a final repetition of the word by the world church system the lay on scene ends in a blackout of the word thereby causing the departure of the Lord from the mist now brother Bram in the same season of the opilio seven seals he preaches indictment do you realize in the message and I can he says there will be another denied indictment because bouncing off the scene now we're in the mat-su schnell and there's another indictment actually going on right because the majority of the preaching the word I shouldn't say the majority but the preaching of the third Pole word third pole preaching is actually preaching the loss and the thing is what it is friends they people have left the word for church joining if I could say it this way for message joining for message theology message intellectual that's what they've joined the push in the word out and says well I want more information one more investment and that's all this it's not reality to them and the thing is is that their soul and but now we're slowly but more and more I don't hate that you see this message five years down the road but slowly moving the word out and what it is it they're doing the same thing as he did in Davis time and I'm under Jesus's Tabernacle see they're actually pushing the word out where there's no Ark of the Covenant monks them there's no pillar of Father there's no mercy all those things and what it is is showing the fallacy of worship and friends the thing is that we're in that time period right now where people are feeding on things that aren't even the word anymore because they've left the word a long time ago now let me just say it this way to you now friends how much air can you have and still make it how much air can you have in your belief system and still make it one two three four four things how many things can you see because we've been given a perfect word and brother Bram said that the bride will here in this perfect word once again as they did at the day of Pentecost so friends were sitting here tonight how much air can we have and still make it see you know people don't think about it I think they think well okay I believe the message but what's the message what's the message of the hour what actually is its Christ unveiling himself in you but people they said they put it on on this they put it on that they put and actually they make an idol of it see because the thing is that Christ is not alive in them Christ is something outside of them not understand that the crisis ought to be unveiled in them that's why friends the thing is is that when we look at David's David's tavern up here at the restoration of it it really truly means should mean something to us because the restoration took place not just friends the thing is as a yeah I believe that we've had a restoration problem but actually a restoration in your own life took place individually not just in churches but in the vision of restoration took place in you now brother Brad says David was not only King but he was a prophet so a prophet priest and King goes on again he says II even David himself the greatest military genius that Israel ever had and yet Dave was a prophet sir t was he was a prophet David so David the Prophet brought in another way of worship a prophet came in this generation and brought in another way of worship under the Melchizedek order and watch friends because the thing is the tabernacle Moses everybody was used to the town of Moses in the denominational systems right and when a prophet came onto the scene and they begin to begin to preach the Melchizedek or people refused that is actually hopping again within the message see because the thing is is that under the opening of the seals what it did for us have brought the bride the true bride back into another order so we've come into a new and living way see it's the God don't wait that ignorance that wiggins all over with that's why you know people can get by with this couple if they could be appeal to get by with anything in this day and age then what in the world are we doing what are we actually preaching about what are we actually believing because the thing is is that in this hour the priest has changed because the book was closed now it's open and he made his kings and priests so under the Levitical order type the time Michael Mo's or type the church inches but in this age on Mount Zion is actually bringing back the mckusick order the bride actually brings back the about Cossack order we had a prophet for Asian but there's actually a life source coming out of the bride this way I always say did you really know who you are you're actually the door to salvation I'm talking about the bride see when somebody comes to you you can actually impart into them life because why because you got the life it'll be the same way as you live in 2000 and Jesus speaking to someone have the words of eternal life the words of eternal life now it's out of the bride under the Month category she's the one that speaks she's the one that's the arc so friends the thing is the McKenith of casick of this day is actually the bride manifesting though the order of Melchizedek a new priesthood a prophetic people right now in Hebrews 7 1 4 this bout Catholic Kings Salem priest of the Most High so we know that David was a priest was a king and a prophet now for is the thing is he was a prophet and he stood before the ark as a in the office of a priest in the art of the tabernacle of David first samuel of 6:17 and they brought the Ark of the Lord set it in this place in the midst of the tabernacle David that pitched for it and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord and as soon as David made an end of offering burnt offers peace arms he blessed the people you realize only the high priest could bless the people but David standing in an office of a priest do you know who you are or are we I'm Todd your friends under the opening of the Seventh Seal if you don't know who you are friends it's gonna get scary as we go along in this message because everybody says they're born again but the thing is there's got to be a manifestation or an expression of this born-again experience he says that Moses and Aaron went to the town Medical College came out and blessed the people same as David did under the map Kasikorn he brought them out cousin quarter back to Jerusalem and the bride brings them the cows quarter back to Jerusalem because we are the New Jerusalem understand friends the thing is is that the to town Michaels there's a difference between those abit accord or denomination order and I'm a classic order but many people are still faking denominational terms I'm talking in the message friends let me just say this so you can understand I don't have to go down to the Bible bookstore and pick up the book and say how I could be a better pastor I don't have to go down the bottle bookstore and say well how do I raise my family and read a book on some theologian that wrote about family probably divorced three or four times I don't have to do that I have an outcast order in this day and age I have a life source so they can go to and that life source tells me because what it is is that mount Catholic order within Zion within the New Jerusalem so I have to go up there I don't have to do that I don't have to go and get psychology books and friends the thing is I don't need that because the thing is that we have everything that we have need them in this day and age that's been sent to us amen I don't have to go outside of that now watch this verse 6 verse 4 6 chapter 5 he saves on us also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek so David's time David brought me back the order of Melchizedek or the order of my Catholic back to Jerusalem now we're sitting here and we're in this about Kazik order so in other words friends were on the my cousin in Christ I'm it's the same thing now friends the thing is in this age under the openness seven seals were under the same thing that Christ was and was dead was and it was promised by James that the restoration of the tabernacle of David would happen in this date this is the time that I'm in this is the time I'm living this I'm not living than any other time I'm living in the bride time I'm Britain living in the bride age from the church ages to the bride age we're surrounded by the aoc nage which is always trying to make us lazy always trying to make us lukewarm I was trying to make this cool I was trying to make this formal but friends the thing is shake that thing off shake it off let God's begin to rule and reign in your life let God do something with you no washes he says the law was given to Moses failed he came down struck the rock that was in his hand through it down broke the commandments on because of weakness he had was a temper he broke the commandments and went back showing the priests the Levitical priesthood would be broken the Levitical priesthood we booked these nomination systems would be broken under the breaking of the seven seals there's a people that lives in this endtime that lives under the Melchizedek order doesn't live under some denomination idea some denominational opinion some denominational things but friends the thing is they live under the high score because the Levitical priesthood can never make you perfect denominational denominational order will never make you perfect you know why friends because the denomination or the Levitical priesthood there's no callings in it there's only calling under the Melchizedek order there's only a calling under the Seventh Seal see your birth by the will of God you're not birth because that will do to be birth I never will Jim it's only God that wills you to be birth it's not my flesh but on another denominational system or our denominational thinking I know a biblical order it was by their calling man's calling but we're not under man's car we're under God's Khan because the Bible said it st. John 1:12 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become sense of God even to them that believe on his name was you're born not of blood nor the will of flesh nor the will of man but of God it's God's will that I'm living in the same time under the mouth kasica it's his will it's not your will not my will it's his will that's why friends the thing is is that we're not under carnal thing here it's not a carnal lineage like they had a little bit of court or denomination it's not under that lineage it's under the lineage of the Living God I came from the mind of God I came from God I'm going back to God that's why friends the thing is my soul was a part of God my soul was a part of that priesthood my soul was a part of that Malpensa order that's why friends I can manifest when I manifested you know what because I'm a part of it Hebrews 7 verse 11 if therefore perfect swear by the little bit ago priesthood for honor the people receive the law he said what father need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek he should not be called after the order of Aaron no perfection in a little bit of order only perfection under the mckusick order we're living in a time we've had a perfect word there's going to be a perfect bride that hears the word in its purity absolutely purity that's why I don't have to go like I said to a Bible bookstore I don't have to listen to nominal preachers translate I don't have to listen I go on I listen to brother Brown and I know Christ came down and through that veil begin to preaches Christ and that call went out on the Seventh Seal now I'm worshiping under the Seventh Seal I'm worshiping under the Melchizedek or friends the thing is if we only knew how lucky we were how blessed we are how much grace in our life is that we're actually worshiping under that order first 12 for the priesthood being changed there is made of a necessity a change also of the law only the high priests ago in the Holies not now only the high priests ago no authority but a friends the thing is that now every priest that is called kings and priests every priest says call can go to the holds the Holies and have that fellowship amen now verse 16 speaking of of the malkos priesthood who is me not out for the law of carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life that's the Michela school we're off to the power of an endless life will never be done we are eternal beings not these bodies these bodies aren't born again but friends realized friends you are for the power of an endless life verse 19 for the law the law the Lilith of the mythical law had no power in it but but it made nothing perfect but the bringing of the better hope did by which we draw nigh on to God so what was David trying to what was this whole thing about was trying to get people close to God you couldn't do it on the denominational systems he not only is thinking he can only get close to God under the mile kassig order that's why we needed a knife cuts quarter so much that's the only reason instead have communion with action with God himself he says now the Levitical brother Graham says sees that the death of Lord Jesus now we live in the Malkovich priesthood Christ that's what we're up a men so you got all that now let me preach my message see understand friends if you can have an understand we've been brought into this age and and I'm not saying you don't have the revelation I'm just saying it would help you because so many people think the message is apart from them but I am that prophet spoke I've come out of the pages of the message in a manifest in what those pages said about me I've come in the volume of the book like Jesus says i come in the volume of the book I've actually come that's where you guys you've come and out of the volume of the book with that prophet said about you you are amen now watch the Psalms 84 4 blessed are they that dwell in the house they all still be still praising the Selah blessed is the man who strengthens thee in who's far the ways of them who passing through the valley of the baka make it a well the rain also fills the pools he says they go from strength to strength every one of them in Zion appeareth before God in Zion under the Melchizedek order we peers before God so everyone that is in Zion appears before God we're under the Melchizedek order okay everybody still with me I know I'm preaching a lot of word here somebody goes but hopefully by God's grace he'll he'll give you the revelation of it because they understand what we've been called into first Peter chapter 2 verse 5 he also has lovely stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ this only comes under the breaking of the seventh seal this is what we didn't called into he says the ER chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people that should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of the darkness into his marvelous light this only happens under the Melchizedek Priesthood this is all about you friends see the Seventh Seal is to bring the bride into the mount cast or so we are kings and priests sitting here tonight amen so you are spiritual house right priesthood making sacrifices priest living priesthood obeying a priesthood under the order all those different things what is it because you've been brought back to sign Xion types the broad only the Zion can come in to the New Jerusalem because they are the New Jersey thus all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord with shouting so when they return to Zion the show they begin the shoutout what because the Ark of the Covenant was coming back amen and that's what's copy to this day the Ark of the Covenant actually come about and the Lord himself shall descend with a shout and we know the shout is the message but friends don't leave it just on paper and tapes bring it into yourself see friends the thing is is that when David prophet Tom Rock he was bringing it back to where to Mount Zion amen I shaft for seven verse 48 howbeit to the most high dwells not in temples made with hands as saith the Prophet happiness my throne and earth is my footstool whose house we build me he says save the Lord or what is the place of my rest Zara bright new juice we are his rest remember I rode for a read last night he desires us he desires more than we desire ourselves he says shows that God doesn't dwell on houses made with hands God dwells in human hearts he says for our body as Elmen prepared me the Holy Ghost don't dwell in the house it dwells in the heart that's the temple the opening of the seventh seal points us to the true temple of God what is the true temple of God milk has a quarter in human flesh you realize like I said last night God used imperfection in perfect human beings ministry to perfect the bride by what by the preaching of the perfect word not that friends of thing is that we look at at ministry as in lot you guys but people look at ministries and necessary evil but they don't understand the order of Melchizedek they don't that's why people can miss church and don't think nothing of it doesn't mean nothing to them thank you just said there was just said homeless of the days it don't mean nothing you know what because they're not only my cousin they don't understand the order because God is actually building a building and the thing is part of building that building is come to a church and part of the building is friends the thing is this building this church Billy not this church but human bodies church building is going to be unmovable and it's unshakeable because you know what because they're built on under the order of Melchizedek now the seventh seal brings him back to earth so friends David represent the McKusick or priest prophet and King and Melchizedek after the slaughter of the Kings what did he do with Abraham he served him communion amen no David also served communion I'm just I'm gonna get into something here so just stay with me here for a second he dwelt every one of them Israel both man and woman and to every one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so communion in this tabernacle now does everybody know what communion is I hope you do I believe you do but don't look at communion just come to church and partaking on the ordinance of communion communion because this is under the MAL custom order this is what God brought us into in this generation this is rare to me it's very sacred because it's it's something that God has given me he says to minyan brother ben is not the bread not the wine the communion is talking back and forth with God okay now listen to me friends because people mistake what communion is all about they immediately think it's the ordinance it's more than that he says now he says now we're going to have to mean service now we call it to me and but it is a commune she mean is to talk to commune commune is when we stop and talk to the Lord communicate now this is under the tent this is under the tabernacle of David order came out doesn't it this is what we've been brought into this day some people who only have time to pray anymore they're too busy maybe I should preach a parrot or more but how important prayer is friends in your life your communication your your your communication line people just look at that as an intellectual thing that message but it's not intellectual it's actually has a purpose to it it actually has a communion with and actually you're under the order of Micah it has a purpose to it he says now you do not communal he's because you cannot talk back or television but when you can buy but when you can buy telephone because you can mean one to another it's just isn't one side I cannot commune with you now because you do not talk back so therefore it would not be coming to hear a minister deliver his message so you come to church or tonight it's not communion with God because I'm only one preacher you're a man of me saying Sikkim dog but that's not communion he says that would not be coming together but do you mean communion would not be that if you come just like you mean with the minister you call him to one side or any individual like you mean with him or her but to what that would not be coming to communion taking communion you need him would not be I don't know if he come to commune with the ministry come and call one side or any individual and can mean with him or or she but to what we come into communion he says is for each of us as individuals can be with Christ that is communion then communities not all together one doing the talking us doing all the talking but way and seeing what he says back to us miss my friends is important this is the order that we've been come into this message is not theology to me there's a purpose behind this because Davis restoration of Davis Tabernacle was all about bringing the people close to the ark the mercy seat so what so they can commune he says now there's were many times that we get our great mistakes as we do all the talking and don't wait and give him a chance to answer back we do sometimes say Lord I would thought you would do so-and-so song so amen he says and get up and leave now that really isn't Kamini he says that's going and asking a favor our laundry lists our shopping list that's not communion do this Lord do he's not our mascot he's our husband invisible union of the bra light he says but when you stay long enough until he answers back that's when you're getting to be in communion with the Lord this is what Davis tabernacle is talking about all these things it is not just coming for the Lord and asking favors which a lot of people do they get before the Lord of all he do is I stated that's not what God wants God watched him Union he wants you to talk to him and he wants you to wait for him to talk back to you now this takes time I'm out of time brother Jerry well are you in the order of Melchizedek what do you been called to this day here's a people in this day and age we live busy lives we have a life outside of church in the sense of work and almost of God knows all these things God knows our busy people but the thing is that to take time to actually commune with him it will actually restore your spirit even here your human spirit gets down see your conscience your reason your affection all those things that get down sometimes that friends the thing is you begin to reason with things but God wants you to purge these things out of you want you to pur some of these things out that we get down on because his life gets us down he wants to commune with us see friends the thing is communion is very important he's a communion with the Lord is like an oasis in a desert have you ever got so thirsty really thirsty and drinking water you know friends I can sit here and tell you all the ingredients of this h2o yer tell you about it preach to you talk to you about all those things it doesn't do nothing for you it only do something for me when I take a drink you can be sitting there in the bench thirsty dry and all those things but friends the thing is I'm the one with the glass I'm the one with the water I take a drink and what does it do it quenches my thirst but communion it's like an oasis in the desert see friends the thing is you might be dry I'm talking spiritually though you might be oh my my prayer life is one like Oh God what is it it's an oasis it coming to me with God and also and God begins to really talk to you and revive you and you're ready to take on the world again he knows this world he knows what's going on he knows the pressures the things that are going on in this life but what we do we don't take time enough to actually commune with him to fellowship with him amen he says it's like a spring underneath the pond that were the traveler come by stops and drinks the water will be he crunches his thirst that's remembering the Lord coming by the order of his top table where the passing program that's our journey here on the earth with us together that we can come by his table and their drink of his blessings and of his grace of his word and fellowship around his word until our thirsty souls are satisfied have you ever had that or am i talking to people that's never experienced this I don't believe that but understand friends this is why under this mell category we can know all the knowledge around it but if I don't take advantage of it what God's given us if I don't take advantage of what God's actually that's part of this is part of my inheritance this is part of the things that God's given me he says and then we leave the place of worship refreshed satisfied going out to meet the deserts problems again the problems of life's desert yes an oasis in the desert refreshing ourselves making herself when we're thirsty community oh I got too far because I was I was playing with my PowerPoint last night and of course a I you know I probably puts a bunch of quotes together but understand this friends you know under the Seventh Seal God made a new and living way for us to come in under the bleeding word to come in and that have actual communion and fellowship with him you know friends in the Old Testament Aaron were going behind the veil I'm just gonna be closing here mmm when Aaron would go in behind the veil and all those priests that weren't high priests or Levites that couldn't go in behind the veil was just airing this sons they'd have to wait - Aaron comes back out and ask them what the experience is like but under this new and living way you don't have to wait you don't have to wait for brother Gerald to get up here and tell you what the experience is like you can experience it yourself see many times people they'll come up to you this is what's it like brother Jerry well you need to experience it yourself now I can tell you a lot of things about you know whatever you know maybe okay I worked in the oil field I can tell you a lot of things about a punk jock and friends are they going to 28 and 320 exports doesn't mean nothing to you those are sizes of pump jacks I didn't tell you all those Signet up with the packing I ain't talking about the motors 25 50 works but all's there doesn't mean nothing to you until you would experience it and then we can talk and have communion right same with God friends that's what he's longing for communion with you you might say well God's just too great too much he is but he wants to commune with his wife he wants that fellowship with us he wants to be able to come and have that that then of the relation that that talk with you but friends the thing is we don't allow sometimes you know why because we think our theology is gonna give us by your theology won't get you bought you need that communion with the Lord in order to get by in this life friends your si ology your understanding an adult you know all those things dolphins are fine they're great on board we need to understand the right dog there's all those things but understand that there's more to this message than that there's more under than my cousin there's a there's a time period where you just have communion with the Lord now friends watch this it's Psalms 27 verse 6 and we know Psalms 27 is actually the rapture master's brother brand preaches and we understand friends the thing is is that under mountains on the tabernacle of David brought the talent of the Ark of the coming back to to Jerusalem and Mon song and the thing is is that what it is is that it was trying to find its resting place and when when brother Brown because this is a strange scriptures of brother Branham used when he preached in the rapture message to us it's not strange humor because are you having a good better understanding of it but listen what he says here now this is under the Melchizedek order he says now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies around about me therefore well I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of joy I will sing yay I will sing praises unto the Lord so in other words there's worshiping go there's praise there's this is this another option is see friends a thing is that we're not supposed to be just sitting here like lumps on the log this there's there's action to this there's praising him there's worship to all these different things friends the thing is there's seen come another's Tabernacle and let me just say it this way Melchizedek is here to serve you communion and our friends we've been blessed in this thing we've been blessed under the opiate of the senses we am blessed in all these things because friends are understanding sometimes needs to be changed because end time evangelism isn't calling the masses to the altar that's not what the message is all about what it is is a molding and molding the character of Jesus Christ in our lives so when he looks at us he sees his character friends the thing is is that in order to get his character there's gonna be some communion because there's got to be some transferring of life coming into it but we all need more communion alive we need more Gunnar we not agree transmissible life is just getting so busy you know technology let's go on the Internet's the way it's going friends the thing is it takes you up to it you go on YouTube you could might be looking at something you know not bad or anything sinful but also in your look at this two hours later what is it just ate your time up can I have that time for prayer the time you don't just just have communion with God but friends the thing is just so many things eating their time up now you know uh God no one was just you know that we have to provide for her family's God knows all these things he'll make provision for the whole things but friends he still wants Communion and that's under the order of Melchizedek that's under what we've been called to in this day and age this is the bride of Jesus Christ this is for us because I count myself a part of that you count yourself a part of that amen let's stand hallelujah I hope I didn't rush it through I hope you got what I was actually trying to convey because the thing is friends it's important to us what we understand about what we've been called to in this day and age I haven't been just called to another religion it's not a ritualistic form that we're taking on here tonight you can do many things like the Pharisees could do they could take on the religion of the law but they could never take on the life I want to take on the life I want to have Christ working out of me Christ isn't something that friends we set aside it's something living out of you that's why many times that's why they can never understand Jesus when Jesus came on the scene the Pharisees looked down further and they said you're the devil why why why they say the devil here's the very thing that they're waiting for because they built an image in their minds of what Christ was supposed to be like and they looked at that and didn't compare to their image you know things same things happening today you know in the message of the hour people are building images again in their minds and not recognizing that the bride has taken the word and taken flesh the word has taken flesh in the bride they don't recognize that they recognize the theology the RET recognize the dachshund recognize a lot of things but they do not recognize that the bride Zach she's been veiled by the word Amen I said word prayer Father in heaven gracious Holy Spirit merciful God how wonderful you are to us old Jesus I pray dear God that you just

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank God for the word Amen it was the word and I was thinking I said oh my I said he must have been tuned in to our services or I said maybe I said brother Matthew was sending in the DVDs a man but know it what it is it's the same spirit it's the same anointing it's the same milk as today taking the hand a many Z's in that temple I'm in that temple we are in that temple a man and what we say is going to be going to be the same thing it's going to come out the same revelation by the grace of Almighty God a man it was tremendous hallelujah to God be the glory a man and when he said that and I said old mine I said he must have heard me yeah administering the word he must have been listening to me and so on so God knows it's not him it's the Holy Ghost it's not me ministering the word is the Holy Ghost ministering the word and not our brother Jerry ministering the word is the Holy Ghost ministry the word a man and in the deep calling to the D and it's bringing this out bringing that out what um need of by the grace of God a man so we pray that and it's a confirmation what he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same in that ministries the same in this ministry that it that's ordained to the Bride of Christ amen praise the name of the Lord that is absolutely wonderful so I thank God for that and we look forward to hearing hearing the the word tomorrow as he brings it to a climax amen they praise the name of the Lord so I trust it was a blessing to you it was feeding your soul it was it was encouraging you and increasing our faith praise the name it's got to be the faith that pleases God amen God as God has brought us through the Prophet god-ordained your your pastor then God since our brother Jerry a mayday madam out of two three witnesses let it be established praise the name of the Lord a man we've heard of the Prophet you heard it of the pastor now you're hurting in are visiting man ministering brother here a man a man were under that same Antonia Melchizedek praise the name of the Lord that's wonderful bring out what he's bringing out concerning were in that temple praise the Lord hallelujah no no no they're trying to break it down to this and break it down to that you know and so that you know just just making it like track they the old temple no no no that's good I like that a many yeah David didn't building like the old temple no no he build a one-room temple that's good praise the Lord so we enter into oneness with him and oneness with each other a man by the grace of Almighty God and it's true again what we've heard tonight the part of God say that when the ministries or whether it's the pastor and the other ministers standing there in the pulpit he said he's the angel of God to you a man it's the angel of God bringing forth the word that you needed to hear tonight praise the name of the Lord it was good and I was singing at and I just just quickly and I was shocked that he studying that he finished and I was hoping that he go on for at least another hour so maybe he's going to do that tomorrow happy man because we the clock goes back to night though so we got an extra hour so we pray the Lord Allah given given that extra anointing tomorrow amen but it's Jesus here now that's good a man many don't know it and many do take it lately amen brother Jerry you're right that was the truth many are taking it too lately they die they're not into the enthusiasm that they worry and at least I can go back to 51 years ago when I first came to this word in this message and the people had that hunger thirst enthusiasm for the word the things of God the mystery of God and worse chipton worshiped and worship a man and they can and again they couldn't wait for those doors to open a maid that couldn't wait for whether whether there was a church or whether it was the cottage mean they just couldn't wait they were looking forward to it constantly for the hearing of the word sometimes there was a ministering brother sometimes just the tape of the prophet but brother I'd say to the estate they didn't take it lightly but as time goes on there's more and more taking it lightly more and more just becoming religious in the end our brother brought all that out tonight and I trust you heard it and I trust that you're gonna put your foot you put us on our toes so that we're not going to be guilty of it Amen we're not gonna be guilty of losing the hunger the force for the things of God and just taking it lately no no no no break grace of God to us brother that is that is not not like taking lightly as it's light and it's life to the Bride of Christ by the grace of Almighty God and again either brother brought it out but word about worshiping in vain for a form of worship and he said dead works amen I think the Holy Ghost bring it to your remembrance what our brother has minister concerning these things tonight because many have gone from the Holy Ghost worship to a form of worship and the boat of gods and it's all out of the head but not the heart Holy Ghost verse that comes out of the heart by the grace of Almighty God a man dead works and it's in vain he brought the scripture out in vain do they worship Me grace to us brother there were not worshiping out of our heads but were worshiping out of our hearts amen and living we're living not acting out the word the Pharisees were actors and the scribes they were actors and there was a lot of actors around the message they're acting it out but there's a bride there are the elect the chosen that are living it out they are the message living it night morning noon and night day and day and day out you want to if they want to listen goddess you're gonna judge the world and it's going to be the life you live Oh Oh Lord as I preach in our sister Burns's shooter some years ago I said I said they're going to say oh well I didn't see this I didn't know this and I said but God is going to come back to that person and say listen I was made flesh in Julia Barnes and I live next door to you I was little I was made flesh and Julie burns and I and I lived it I lived in middle gamble and that was me that wasn't her amen and then they they could see in her a different life a different attitude amen you know even in our brother Burns and I trust that it can be said of you tonight and me tonight through the hearing of this word it will confirm that we are the Word made flesh amen and got a point to you and say there I was I lived in that person I was made flesh in that person a man by the grace of Almighty God is wonderful amen and again that's true as our brother Jerry brought out God doesn't weaken our ignorance because now the whole truth is revealed we are without excuse that's the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth had been revealed as I brought it out just recently there was no ministry in this hour in this age like William Branham he was a man that had they god had a plan for his ministry others made made their own planes but God had a plan for his because it was to the bride this is wonderful thank God that it wasn't a man-made ministry but was it was there was prophecy fulfilled for in this day and in this hour so brothers sisters don't think God's going to wink at this and we get that because God's going to require the truth manifested in our flesh I like what our brother is bringing out concerning milk isn't it good oh my praise the Lord hallelujah Melchizedek brother is a mystery to the people back in Abraham's day Melchizedek is a mystery to them today but not to the bride praise the name of the Lord because he was that mighty angel descending for the opening of the seals oh did you hear it revealing the Melchizedek order of the word that's good amen thank God for brother Jerry fury a man not furry a man he come with the word if it's furious of the people think it's furious well that's that that's that's that's the anointing upon our brother amen a confirmation of his name amen by the grace of God sort of thing I was thinking about that when he was preaching I said come on I said Amen Lord I said anoint our brother as you're bringing out I said his name and I thought about it a few times I said is he furry you're furious so it's just lay you get up there you live the word amen it's a challenge especially in this hour when people are compromising and then they when they want the minister to compromise a man they want you to had a word take away a word allow for this and love for that brother we gotta stay with the truth by the grace of God amen so we thank the Lord for our brother and for his name amen by the grace of God and brother again just a point of this Melchizedek came to Abraham but not to lot many are called few are chosen by the grace of God amen that's wonderful and he came to the to the bride brother not to this not to the lots of this generation or this age amen and thank the Lord that he brought out what he just said concerning communion I pray lord help us god forbid God forgive us Lord if if if communion is just a ritual just a you're just a religious form god help us to realize that it's it's fellowship with him by the grace of God and that's what he wants that's what he wants see it was lost because of sin but he wants to bring it back to Redemption a man because he said I stand at the door not healed over the door he said I'll come in he said sup but he saw coming in and fellowship with you and you fella sit with me that's good god bless our brother Jerry as he continues with the word it's good we thank the Lord for them amen let's believe with all of our hearts the same love lifted me divine love I was sinking deep in the sin of this last age far from the peaceful Shore very deeply stained within singing to rise no more but the master of the sea heard my despairing cry and from the waters lifted me now safe mi it's wonderful I pray God give us the revelation of what God has done and what God is doing and our part in it I pray the Alpha was revealed to that generation of elect 2,000 years ago I pray the Omega is revealed to us the alphas become the Omega it's the same one on he's made flesh and his bride now by the grace of Almighty God he redeemed our souls now he's redeeming our bodies a body like his glorified body come on let's be conscious more conscious at work on the more you get into the word the more you become one with the word after hearing what we heard tonight rather the more real the rapture becomes the resurrections come becomes and you're more conscious of it and you're not interested in this world every day you're living an expectation of the change to get out of this world amen god help us that we're going to be as we're going to be that the resurrection rapture is going to be as real to us as the flood was to Noah that's right he believed it he spent 120 years building a ship yeah a boat and then he went in got all the animals in and went in himself in his family so he believed it I pray God that we believe the resurrection the rapture you know it's already in progress now our brother brought that out it's all it's all it brother was just waiting for the climax of it by the grace of God by praying as real to us as as the as the flood was to know him I praise his route of us as God was to Enoch because he he walked with God and was not because God took him and Noah walked with God and God took him in the arm my brother he had it had to be real for him to spend a hundred and twenty years building a boat expecting something to happen that had never never never happened before rain had never rained in the days of Noah but he believed it was coming because God told him do we believe in the climax of the resurrection the rapture do you read do we really believe that were that we're gonna change go to get a new body disrobe of flesh all drop and rise and sees the everlasting price and shout while passing through the air farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer Amy god help us father that the word that you're that went forth tonight going to our hearts may the Holy Spirit come down and make us one with it make it flesh in you and me by the grace of God let's sing it I was sinking deep in sin but God is by grace lifted us out amen I was
