somebody well just hold him before the Lord as we approach the throne hold your needs before before him as well as we approach that Throne today in faith and trusting the Lord so let's just sing not in trying is but in trusting is not in wondering but it's in resting and but in praying let's sing that brother of Joel open in prayer it's not in Tri but in trusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in wondering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord it's not in trying but in trusting Amen in it's not in running but in [Music] resting it's not in wondering but in [Music] praying that we find hallelujah praise the Lord once more it's not in trying but in trusting it's not in running but in resting it's not in wondering but in praying that we find the strength of the Lord amen just before we pray uh quick announcement uh we are planning uh a week from today next Sunday to have a um general election so obviously the pastor has already been voted in in the November election so this is for the the other offices and uh one thing to note is that we uh brother Dale is uh stepping down uh as as trustee as you know and we have not had another trustee uh take his place uh to to step forward and volunteer uh to be to be voted on uh ideally we we would like to have two trustees uh just the nature of of that position um in dealing with finances and those types of things it's it's good to have two people there in the event of a um decision needs to be made and and so forth so um I just want to real quick uh to flag that I had it pulled up here and it's gone so Ju Just for those that would that might be interested um the trustee position um this is the this is from the Constitution so the trustees oversee the physical aspects of a church such as Finance property buildings Property Maintenance liabilities trustees are responsible for disclosing the plans for the church property at the annual General business meeting managing the overall upkeep of the property such as uh you know paintings snow clearing repairs Renovations new construction Etc and uh trustees are accountable to members of the church for all activities and decisions obviously so that's that's the nature of the role I will add that um things like snow clearing are being delegated now U to you know um other brothers and and their sons you know that are able to come out and do it so it's not like he'd be responsible for you know all the snow clearing um just want to note that um but if anyone's interested in in being um in being on the ballot for that position just let myself or brother Matt know there there is no uh um you know criteria uh as I'm aware with deacons it's different but trustees it's you know any any male here any adult male could step forward and and uh raise their hand you know for that position so just just keep that in prayer um if you if you are interested in going on the ballot just let us know ASAP this week because we'd like to finalize the ballots and and get all that ready so is that it man anything else okay so if you want if you really feel like there's somebody here that do a great job with the exception of by the Dale don't nominate brother brother Dale um we'd love to have your brother but we understand so uh if anyone's interested in in nominating somebody again just let myself brother Matt know and and we'll take it from there so let's pray Lord Jesus we're just so thankful Lord to be gathered together again father in this place and we're just asking now Lord that your presence Lord would be among us father that you would just be in everything in this service today Lord in the singing in the worship father we just also pray that you'd be with Brother John as the ministers Lord that you would speak through him help us Lord to have ears to hear Lord the word as it goes forth Lord to to hear what you have for us Lord to ponder it Lord reflect on it and to by Grace Lord apply it in our lives we pray also Lord for all the needs that have been mentioned here this morning also the unspoken requests father those that couldn't be here this morning Father we just pray Grace to each one I pray especially for sister Leah Lord you be with her Lord and her uh her hip I pray she'd make a quick recovery Lord be brother Ivan Lord as he continues to adjust Lord in the coming weeks and months Grace to him and the family Lord um all the needs Lord there's there's many needs but there's many promises father you are the the great father Lord the great deliverer the great comforter Lord and we're just uh laying all this at your feet this morning and and trusting you Lord with uh each day Lord each moment be with each one Lord we just want to be more like you forgive us Lord where we fall short for our sins and mistakes Lord and but we're just thankful Lord how you've brought us through another year for your grace Lord for your provision Lord we just ask that you'd go before us in the coming year father that we would seek your kingdom first Lord that that would be our our number one desire Lord is to be more like you to be used of you Lord to be found in your perfect will so be with each one Lord we

Lord we're thankful Lord for your call for your election Lord for your predestination Lord that you do all things well and that we're right exactly where you want us to be Lord God lord I pray Lord under the preaching of the word this morning morning Lord you just encourage our hearts Lord may we just be able to see your hand moving in our lives Lord may we recognize your presence Lord each day and in everything that happens Lord May our trust be in you we pray Lord God lord there's still many sick Lord many working these different things Lord we pray your grace to them this morning Lord for brother Paul especially Lord praying your grace to him as he recovers Lord praying you guard his home and his family from anything that would come against him Lord God lord just be with us now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to numbers 24 numbers 24 amen it's good to be back good to see each one good to see that we've made it through certainly had a rough spell there with all the sickness that was going around and some even getting it twice in a couple of weeks but amen we're still here thankful for it it's good to see my mom she's here for the first service and then she leaves today so we didn't mean to to have so few services but just with the sickness going around and how catching it was is evidenced by basically if you stood next to somebody or talk to them on the phone you pretty much got it so anyways we're we're glad to be back but she travels back today so trusting God's grace to her amen I got a a card here for brother Ivan Brenton as many of you know we went number of us went to the funeral and I want to thank each one that went there publicly but it was a big deal to him and anyways he sent this car back it says uh to brother Jonathan and the Saints at evening Light Fellowship and the card says this extra special thank you note sent to you today holds more appreciation than any words can say for you're among the nicest people I've ever known and you'll never be forgotten for the thoughtfulness you've shown he says with heartfelt gratitude and appreciation without measure you will never know the burden that you lifted off my shoulders I want to thank you and the saints that took the effort to come and help with sister Edna's funeral I really felt the presence of the Lord and know that his will was done God bless with love brother Ivan so that's to to each one that went and each one that supported and so he's just passing on those those uh those things so we say God's grace to him amen it's a lonely time for him now and we're just praying and as I admonish the the people there don't just pray for brother Ivan be his hands be his feet go and fellowship with them and these different things and so even those of us that know him we should probably check in with him from time to time and just encourage him you know you can't tell somebody don't grieve you can't tell somebody to be happy amen but you can say we're praying for you and we're we're there with you and we know that there's there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it does get better as the days go by and we're here to help them any way we can amen man God bless you this morning we're going to read the scripture in numbers 27 says I shall see him but not now I Shall Behold Him but not nigh but there shall come a star out of Jacob and a scepter shall rise out of Israel and shall Smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the children of sheth amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and as you might imagine this was my Christmas message if I could put it that way but the lovely thing about being Believers is if it comes out of the word you ought to be able to preach at any time and I think you'll see as we go here that this is something that we ought to be able to preach any time amen but it's it's something I've been dwelling on for for a couple of months and and I want to I want to take a title this morning of Rejoice amen rejoice and I've been thinking about this service for quite some time and just you you dwell on things and you read something and then it's good to dwell on things you know when when something jumps out at you it's good to just spend some time and and meditate on it you know or David would wrri in the Psalms many times after he'd write a Psalm then he'd say sa and that means think about it dwell on it for a bit and and mull it over and chew it over and and whatnot and I find that as you dwell on things then God brings more to your to your mind and he brings he opens it up and he makes it a little more real to you you know and I think if we dwell on the things of God then it'll start to become more real to us we'll be an expectation for things we'll be looking for things and as we'll see in the service this morning when you start expecting things and when you start looking for things that's when you start seeing them amen it ought not to be a surprise to us many times that things that happen because so often the presence of God has gone before to prepare us for the things that he's bringing our way amen but this is a prophetic scripture in numbers 27 and I didn't read the whole chapter obviously but the surprising thing here is this is balum speaking right a false prophet a man with they true gift but he's a false prophet because he could never bring his life subject to the will of God but he's there and he he says something here and he talks about there shall come a star out of Jacob and there's so many things that are hidden in scripture and even if you think about this message there's things that that we focus on that nobody else focuses on but if you see here there's a scripture here that says there shall come a star out of David and it takes a special person to catch that and it takes a special person to receive it because there's there's a time and a season for every part of the word you'll see and it's allocated to people it's ordained to people that are going to be living in that time that are supposed to see it that are supposed to get something from it amen and this is this is a special scripture because of this scripture only this portion is meant for a particular time the scepter is not going to come out until he rules in the Millennium but the star part was for the time of Christ as we'll see amen but there was going to be a people that would catch it and they would be the ones that would see it happen they'd be the ones that would be privy to the revealing of the word of God in their time if we look in Matthew Chapter 2 it says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and we have come to worship him now there's a lot to unpack here and I want to take my time this morning we haven't had Church in in almost 2 weeks so I'm not going to rush through it if that's okay this morning amen I want to unpack this a little bit cuz I want you to understand the journey not just the destination cuz guess what we're going to spend most of our life in the journey not in the destination we're going to be believing for things we're going to be looking for things we're going to be expecting things and guess what there's a lot of journeying before you get what you're looking for this whole life is a journey and it's not always going to be the season of getting a lot of times it's going to be the season of waiting it's going to be the season of Walking it's going to be the season of expecting but it's not always going to be the day you get what you've been believing for so I'd rather rather we understood what we're going through and not always be looking to the future but to be able to dwell in the presence and have the right at the present and have the right attitude and the right spirit so that we can actually be the way that God wants us to be in our day-to-day walk because if we're walking through life and we're always looking for we'll never met we'll never see what's happening right now brother BR would say time and time again people are always looking back at what God did always looking forward to what he's going to do but they're missing what he's doing now and this service is about what do you do in the now amen so we're in the season this was the season of Christ's first appearing amen and and and we're in the season of his second appearing and so the same thing that's happening then is what's happening now and so I want us to see ourselves in this you know when we see the Christmas scene so many times and they have a manger scene and they've got the Shepherds and they've got the sheep and the donkeys and they have the wise men there as well but that's not the way it was the wise men did not come to the manger they did not come to him as a baby they came to him as a young lad and we'll we'll see that as we go through these scriptures but rather these men Came From The Far East the scripture says they came from the East it literally means from the rising of the Sun and and traditionally it's held it's believed that they came from Arabia Persia and India and it's believed that they were descendants of the three sons of Noah shemam and jeffi and so they had a nominal understanding and reading of the Old Testament they were aware of it but they were not necessarily ones that were fully involved or engaged in it the way that a Jew would be but I want you to understand one thing they were men that studied the stars and because they were men that studied the Stars than any Scripture that related to Stars had special meaning to them there are things today like I said that that we believe and it means something to us because of who we are there are scriptures in this Bible that are only meant for the bride of Christ to see to understand and to experience absolutely it's only for a certain people amen this scripture was meant for them because of who they were and they were ordained they were predestinated to see it and God made them who they were so that they would latch hold of this scripture and it would take effect on them when they saw certain things happen amen it didn't mean much to any many others as we'll see nobody else caught this scripture in in in Deuteronomy the way that they did even the Jews didn't catch it but they caught it and because of that it had an effect to them amen others could accept it as part of the scripture but it didn't mean anything to them it didn't mean mean anything about the time and season brother BR puts it this way he says many of those people in the days of the wise men they didn't pay any attention to the star they weren't looking for it they had their own domestic affairs to take care of they belonged to church that's all they cared for but they had no time for such but these wise men reading the Bible and knowing that the star was to appear as soon as they got the thought that that was to appear they watched for it day and night that means we ought to be searching for something we ought to be looking for something we ought to have something in the word that's causing us to look amen it says and the men and women today in this world who are watching for the signs of the coming of the Lord they see the Revival breaking and their hearts begin to bloom up and rejoice not because it's done but because they can see it coming forth they can see it starting they can see it breaking it's not there yet but they can see what's happening and they can rejoice in the now even though it's not in Full full fulfillment but they can Rejoice because they can see what's unfolding before them under this message of the hour we focus on scriptures that mean something to us far more than to other believers even other Christians are so-called and it's because of who we are it's because we've heard a message that focuses us on something that's particular to us we don't focus on a message from yesterday we don't Focus on a message from 2,000 years ago we're focused on the message that's supposed to draw us into a full relationship with Christ and the revealing of the word to us and in US amen it causes us to look at things differently because we've been ordained to it because we're looking at certain things Malachi 45 and 6 doesn't mean much to many people in fact most of them would say it was in John they don't realize that it's a twf scripture that that happens over 2,000 years Revelation 10 doesn't mean anything to most people today and for even message Believers some of them only go to 107 and they forget about 8 through 11 which is our portion it's the bride portion Luke 17:30 doesn't even register to most people but to a message believer these are signs of the times and there scriptures that we focus on because it places Us in the word and in a season that we're supposed to be recognizing amen people will read those scriptures and you you could read it out and say you know Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man they'll say yeah that's scripture I believe it they believe it because of scripture not because they recognize it's today but we believe it because we've seen it we've seen it to be happening in this day why because those words are meant to be fulfilled the word is prophetic it's the very thoughts and intentions of God and so he doesn't give it to us to mystify us or to cause us frustration or keep us in the dark but rather it's the intentions of the almighty God and he's bringing it to a people that are meant to take those intentions and embody it and experience it amen the word is given for us to take to ourselves that it would have an effect in our lives in its proper time and season brother B will continue he says the wise men the Magi from the East followed the star for two years down across the Tigers river through the plains they come up over way over in Arabia over into India come down to Jerusalem following that star it says and it passed over every Observatory and none of them wrote anything about it they didn't see it he says but they saw it that means you're going to see things that other people don't see and you'll get excited about things that other people don't see and they will say what are you talking about and you're saying don't you see this can't you see it happening and they say I don't know what you're talking about but it's in the scripture yes I believe it's in the scripture but it's happening they're saying what are you talking about why because you've seen something Supernatural brother Adam says the light that went before them was the star it was the pillar of fire it was God Almighty leading them this wasn't a natural star because we'll see this star can come and go it can disappear it can move continuously Stars don't move like that stars come and go every night this is a star that led them continuously for two years and they saw something and nobody else does there's nothing in recorded history you know we have we have these computer programs now where we can take the entire visible solar system and we can unwind the clock so we can see where every Star was at any particular time we can literally turn everything back to the way it was in Jesus day and if they did it they would not see a star because it was not a natural star this is a star that can move it's a star that can appear and disappear and then it's a star that can hover that ain't a star like like we're used to calling Stars it's a supernatural thing you know what happens sometimes I know this has happened to you and I know it's happened to me you'll read something in your scriptures you read something in the Bible you read something in the message and you go talk to someone and you're so excited about it and what did they say oh that's great that's lovely you're excited and they're not does that mean they don't have the Holy Ghost does that mean they're not a real believer no it just means that you've got something happening in your life that God has quickened to you that he hasn't quickened to them yet and it's not because they're bad or they're wrong or they're out of his will or they're not a real believer but it's because you've got to see it for something that's in your life at that time they don't need it today they believe it but they don't see it the way you see it because they don't need it the way you need it so we don't put somebody down because they do those things amen but what matters is that you see it that God's given you a word for your day that God has come into your situation and he's opened something up to you that's what matters is that you see it amen the wise men were the only ones that saw the star and it was supernaturally revealed to them because they were looking for it brother brandham says amen so we can't expect everyone to see everything we see at the time we see it with the same enthusiasm we see it they'll believe it we believe it as we believe as Believers we believe every word of this Bible but that doesn't mean it's opened up to us at all times and all ways for every everyone else the same way it is to everyone else amen we're all going through different things in life some of us are fighting and struggling and worrying and dealing with different things and my great scripture may not be your great scripture and yours may not be mine but what matters is that you see it and that God's opening up to you because God's got a word for each and every one of us for every day for every season for every situation just trust that he's opened your eyes when you need it Amen brother Bram says this he says so I believe tonight that the holy spirit is here he said says it's here for those who are destined to receive it who that believe it and who is awaiting on it destined believing and awaiting it he says it's here to straighten out every one of them spiritual problems it's here to heal every sick person that's present it's here he says but you've got to come and get in the atmosphere of it he says and the attitude to receive it you got to come not in an emotional workup you got to come upon the basis of what believing a promise that God made he says that does it that's what does it sickness spiritual problems relationship issues issu stress sorrow we're all dealing with things and mine are not yours and yours may not be mine but he's saying God's got a power in his word to come into your life to come into your situation and deal with it and you've got to come what believing and awaiting that's your part you got to come in believing saying Lord whatever you bring my way I'll accept it and I'll take it as mine notice what he says so he says you've got to come and get in the atmosphere and the attitude to receive it and that's a battle we all fight equally we've all got to fight that battle remember the last service I I spoke I think it was we talked about taking the kingdom by force just for that brief moment and how we've got to press into the kingdom of God that's a battle every day is you got to press for the things that God has ordained for you you got to press into the promises of the word you can't just sit back this is not a static gospel this is not a sit on your rear end gospel you got to take the sword of the word and you got to say Lord I believe and start walking by that word amen we've got to press for it but God's got a time for everything and he's got a season for it reading Ecclesiastes there's a time to be born a time to die a time to mourn a time to laugh all these different things but when it comes to the fulfilling of the word when we need it God has already provided the way in his word it's already there we come in we need a word and God has already given it to us but we just got to find it this is already here every answer we need is here and yet sometimes we say where's the answer it's in here you just got to find it and God's got a way to give it to us amen and he's got a season he's got a times for these things and all he does he just opens up our eyes to it you read a scripture I mean if if I was to show you my Bible here and you probably can't see it but there's underlined scriptures everywhere and you go in and sometimes it's easy to skim over the things you've already underlined because you say well I already got that and then you read it and you're like oh my goodness I didn't really get that because you you really underlined the first half and the second half is what you need now or because you've read more and God's opened more things up to you you read that again and you say oh my goodness there's a whole another layer of depth into something like that and you realize what it means you know sometimes can I just be honest this morning sometimes I don't feel like I read enough I I try and give an hour hour and a half every morning but sometimes it seems like you're not doing enough and sometimes life is busy and and and mama needs help or you got to run out the door to do something for work or something and you don't read everything you ought to and sometimes it's hard it's easy to get down on myself about that but you know one thing I've noticed sometimes he's in that because what happens is I delay and I don't read that one chapter and then something happens that day the next morning when I read it my answer is in the chapter and because I delay now I read that chapter in a whole new way and it's an answer to a question it's an answer to a situation it's leadership for what's happened what I'm saying is my limitations don't stop God from giving me answers church now let's not rest on our weaknesses let's not make excuses for but what I do or don't do ain't going to stop him because he's got a plan he's got a word that works regardless and if he needs me to shut down for a while he'll shut me down if he needs my busyness to stop he'll stop my busyness he'll lay me flat on on my back he'll put a full stop to anything he needs if he's got to get my attention but in the meantime he knows we deal with life and so he comes and he finds a way to give us his word no no matter what Amen brother Bram says it this way he says it's usually when you keep your mind on Christ that he comes to you it's usually at a times when you're thinking about him when he appears he says you know when you're thinking about getting right doing something right that's when he comes to you to help you what I'm saying church is he got it all in control he's never late he's never worried or worked up that's us that's us but he comes all times when he's needed and our weaknesses don't stop him our inconsistencies don't stop him our little isms our little flaws and failures big ones even they don't stop him he's got a word that's already working and it never rests and it brings us to that expected End Amen brother Brandman speaking of the the wise men he says and it must have been while they were thinking on this he said the sacred fires burning that they happened to notice that there was a stranger among them something that they could not account for none of their Scrolls told of it none of their writings said anything about it but there it was and they couldn't deny it they watched the heavenly bodies and they knew that something Supernatural had taken place notice their Scrolls their writings they're not Jews right they're not children of Abraham but they were ordained to come and worship Christ and so God has to get their attention regardless and he gets their attention by getting them to see something that they've never seen before they're looking and where they're looking he puts the sign in their way and they can tie it back to a scripture watch this he says oh he is so good he will catch the attention of what every person that he's ordained to life catch this maybe in their own ways of worship ship you can be sitting in a denomination and he can catch your eye you can be walking down the street Godless you can be in a bar you can be in adultery you can be as black and dirty as night and he'll catch your attention because you're ordained to it not that you did anything but you're ordained to it by his choosing his election he says but he is God and he knows the hearts of men and he watches them he protects them and he brings them to a place you say brother John I'm not where I need to be don't worry he's bringing you to a place and he'll guard you and he'll protect you until you get there he says when the Deep call it to the Deep there's got to be a deep to respond to that call and if a man is thirsting for something it shows that there's something out there to respond to quench that thirst they they saw something that Drew them and it was a special star and the prophet of God is pointing out they're ordained to see it and he came to them in their way of worship whatever it was and he drew their eye to it and he caused them to follow it amen he had ordained them to bring gifts he' ordained them to worship but first he had to get them moving amen he gave them the calling he gave them the understanding he gave them the focus on the scriptures that would pull them to worship Christ amen I'm saying that to say we're not where we are by chance wherever we are we're not here by chance amen we're here because we're ordained to be it he said the wise men what did they see when they followed the start of Jesus he said nobody else saw it it passed right over the observatory every planetarium is that right every city had a planetarium they kept time by the stars is that right and isn't it strange that those wise men ran right through city after city city after City following a star that even the stargazers and the men in the planetarium and telling the time and things never saw nothing of it he says they were looking for it that's where it's at you get what you expect you and I are no different Church we're no different we're called We're ordained we're placed for these things we're in expectation and we're looking for the things of God that he has in his word for us we see things because God's appointed us to see them we have them because we're appointed to have them we are them because we're appointed to be them Jesus would say time and time to his disciples he' say Blessed Be Your Eyes for they see and your ears for they hear but why were they blessed they were blessed because they were in his presence because aside from him they didn't understand anything they didn't understand the Parables any more than everyone else they didn't they say they'd come to him time and time again tell us what the parable means tell us what the parable means and he'd come and he'd say blessed be your eyes and then he'd tell them what the parable meant why because they came into his presence they were ordained to see it and he opened up their eyes and he explained what was going on and he gave them Clarity to what he was talking about but Braham says nobody else saw that star but those wise men they were looking for it he says and Jesus is here tonight in his power all of his power to heal every person that's in this building he says if you're looking for him you'll find him he's here there's a fountain open tonight and brother when a man hungers and thirsts for God there's bound to be something in there to create create that thirst we don't follow something blindly we don't have something just for the sake of having it but we have a desire we have a thirst we have a seeking nature for the things of God why because he put it in us remember scripture says no man can come to God except God draw him first you have it because he give it to you and he doesn't give it to you to leave it unfulfilled right he gives it to you that your joy may be full that you would have what you would seek inside of you amen and so they saw this Supernatural star and something in them said we got to follow that star and it drew them on nobody else saw it can you imagine maybe they looked around at others and they said do you see that they'd say see what that star that's up there look over here in this quadrant this they said what are you talking about and only the three of them is as far as we know only three of them saw it but the three of them got together and they joined together and they went on a journey but you see the confusion that they caused when they got to Jerusalem after two years because they come in and they're saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him no it says we have seen it they couldn't see it anymore it led them to Jerusalem and then it vanished God got them started by revealing that star to them and they tied it to scripture that it was linked to Christ's birth and they started on a journey and the only thing they can do in their condition is follow the star they don't have anything else except the star cuz the star is going to lead us to that King coming out of Jacob it's going to lead us to where he is amen that's all they had they didn't have this big knowledge or understanding of what was going to happen what he'd look like any of these things all they knew was that they had saw a light and it was leading them somewhere and for two years they followed it Church two years they followed this moving star that nobody else could see can you imagine when other people can't see it and you're following something like that we follow something Supernatural we believe it but they saw something that was physically visible to their eyes and yet everybody was calling them crazy no doubt and for two years they followed it why cuz something stirred inside of them something was Quicken to them that they couldn't deny no matter what it's like I remember when all this stuff would believe the sign went around and that and people were leaving left and right and they said how can you follow it how can I not follow it because something inside me says this is the truth I don't choose it chose and I just can't deny it I'd be miserable outside of it because I wouldn't be following what it is if this is false then I'm a false believer but it's the only thing I can be because that's what I respond to you can only respond to what God's put inside of you amen and they follow for two years something that Drew them on and that said this is the time of fulfillment two years we've everyone got a road to walk and we start it when we see something in the word of God and guess what we don't all start at the same place we don't all see the exact same thing we aren't born into the same type of family some come into broken homes some into good homes Godless homes Christian homes some have more Advantage than others but we've all got a road to walk and we've got to be following something that's real to us amen that we see and that that that that we know is real and what matters is not where we started walking what matters is what got us walking in the first place because if it was just a Ministry it won't keep you if it's Mom and Dad it won't keep you it's got to be the word it's got to be the word that's calling us on time and time amen you know I think of brother Joe and brother Chad both entrepreneurs and I don't have enough Faith to be an entrepreneur which is a good thing because you can't mix Ministry and business you know so I don't have what they have but they both came to a fork in the road and they had to decide what they were going to do with their lives amen and they had to choose a road and it's their road to walk it's not mine I wouldn't want their Road and I'm sure they don't want my road but they had a road to walk and when God opens up that decision and you walk it you got to stick with it you got to know your place you got to know what he's called you to do and then you got to stick with it because it's for you it's Sovereign to you brother Matt's road is not my road we're going to the same place but the way we get there may not be the same way amen and so as soon as God opens it up to you we see here that he gives you Faith to walk it that's what God does that's God's gift to you is he gives you Faith to walk the road that he opens before you he gives you Faith to step into it amen and it's just for you and you're built for that road you say it's been a tough road yeah you're still here though that's proof you're built for it that you made it when nobody else could you're built for the road that God has laid out before you amen and it gets lonely sometimes it might feel dark it might feel frightening it might feel just like there's nothing happening but yet it's your road and God is called you to walk it so when God quickens the word to you whether it's a prophecy a promise whatever it might be that's your sign that he's prepared a way for you to make it when he quickens it to you that's a sign of his will for your life cuz he never start you on a road that he won't take you all to the end he's faithful to complete the work he started he always starts you on something that he intends to take you all the way through amen that's why we preach the full breadth of the word in this church we preach the practical all the way to the Supernatural cuz guess what the Practical is in here and the Supernatural and everything in between sometimes you got to throw some meal in the pot and that's practical and sometimes you need an axe head to float on the water and that's Supernatural and it's the same Prophet with the same word did both of them amen we believe it all the way amen we're a supernatural bride but we don't thr throw away the practicality of the word of God either amen but whatever he's called you to do it's meant to live in your life it's meant to produce something in your life brother BR would say the Wise Men followed the star from Babylon all the way down they kept time by the stars crossed over every Observatory and no one saw it it was shown to the wise men and he said God chooses who he will choose and he does what he wants to do he is God that's why we don't tell him what to do we just accept what he's doing he says and he will never go contrary to his word always with his word now uh in dealing with people when you give them the word if they say but you know you've got a problem because God never says but to the word he'll add to it as in he'll say it is also written but he'll never put it away and so when God's leading you if you have to cross the word then it cannot be God leading you ever ever doesn't mean God can't turn it around doesn't mean can't God can't work through it that God can't turn it into something good but that is never God's perfect will for you to step out of his word it can't be because he is his word and he can't disagree with it at all you know I remember when I hope brother Chad's not here this morning I hope he doesn't mind me saying this but I remember when he was talking about opening up the the clintar franchise and I don't know the will of God for brother Chad's life anym than I know for the rest of you maybe God would show me something at some point but I remember when he was talking about this and I didn't know what to say because his intentions were right to be home with his family and to be in church so I believe his intentions were right but whether that was supposed to happen by way of a clintar franchise or by him getting a regular job or by him getting a trucking job that allowed him to stay local I didn't know but it's up to the individual to find the will of God it's not up to me to tell you it I can point you to the word I can point you to what's right but the that you take to get there is up to you and God how he brings you into his will is completely up to him amen and I believe that brother Chad's motives and his objectives were right but I don't know that clintar was right for him at that time I didn't know that amen but what matters is that he was convinced of it that's all that matters my prayer is for him to come to the right place his prayer has to be how do I get there as long as his heart's right God will take him there amen and so now you can look back and can you say that was the will of God praise the Lord we're trusting we're continuing to trust right sister Leah but it wasn't up to me to say yay or nay but it's up to me to prayerfully say Lord give him the desire of his heart which is to be in church and to be with his family on a nightly basis amen so I can't convince him into it and I can't convince him out of it cuz if I can convince him in then you can convince him out and circumstances will convince him out but when he's convinced of it then he'll stay with it and that'll be between him and God Amen so once God shows you his plan and his purpose it's up to you to walk in it and it's up to you to be faithful it's up to you to be fanatical the the wise men were fanatical two years of traveling following something that nobody else saw that's fanatical but that's the way we ought to be is that when God shows us his will and his purpose stay with it and stay with it until he shows you a corner amen stick with it give it everything you've got give it everything you've got don't hold back anything listen once we've made a once we've made a decision and and trusting it's prayerfully and by the word of God give it everything you've got and stay on that road stay on that road and don't let anything pull you to the side amen why because we're looking for a reality of God in our lives and we've got to stay and we've got to walk with him we've got to walk in the light as he is in the light we've got to stay as close to him as we can and you know what sometimes it's going to be emotional sometimes it's going to be lonely sometimes we're going to be praising and sometimes we're going to be crying and it's not always going to coincide with everybody else's crying and praising and emotion and these different things amen but the idea is that you stay close to him and so that no matter what comes you know you're in his will and you can have faith for whatever lies ahead of you amen we can stay on the road these wise men they said Someday my father said here it is written in the Bible his father said there be a star of Jacob r and when they saw that star when it appeared they were looking for it they saw it and the rest of them didn't see it now watch brother Bram here he's making a transition because he says they're fanaticals Fanatics and now he starts to talk about how we're Fanatics how we see something that other people don't see he says somebody said don't you think them people who cry and Shout are all emotional and worked up no sir they're not don't you think it's psychology speaking no sir I do not they're expecting something they're expecting Mana from Heaven to feed their souls and while they're sitting there under expectations God is under obligation to give them the Mana from heaven cuz they're expecting it you come in expecting you'll get you come in not expecting it'll only be by his grace you get cuz remember you got to come in the attitude to receive it the wrong attitude with the the right word won't mix you got to come in with an attitude to receive what God's feeding what God's giving and we'll see in a little bit as we get to the near the end of the service what that looks like God's under obligation to give them the Mana from Heaven because they're expecting it he says you're expecting a meeting God's under obligation to give it to you that's our part we ought to come to service ready we ought to come to service on time we ought to come to service prayed up so that the song leader doesn't have to drag us up out of our depths of our murky life and the pastor doesn't have to beat himself out trying to get you to respond to the word of God right we ought to come in ready and expecting and we'll get a lot more out of the service amen it'll be easy easier if we come in the right way we come in expecting we get what we expect brother Brown would say it time and time again you get what you expect you get in what you put out get out what you put in amen but you see here so often he's just trying to get us started he's just trying to get us moving in the right direction he's trying to get us to follow him and he doesn't show us the whole journey I think any any mature Christian can say I didn't know I was going to go this way when it's all said and done that the path has led in many ways that I didn't expect up front but he's just trying to get us going in the right direction he's just trying to get us started on these things amen and brother brah said as we said earlier he guides us he protects us and we don't always understand what's happening or what's about to be around the corner in these things we just have to trust and follow and it's simple and it's not always glamorous it's not always fun it's not always shouting and praising either is it there's battles there's struggles there's there there there's endurance that's required in these things but like Abraham and Sarah he leads we follow it says and he took them to a land and they didn't even know where it was they didn't even know where they were going but they were following his leadership we know where the end goal is but we don't know when it's going to be and we don't even know how it's going to happen necessarily explain how the Rapture is going to happen we know what it is we can't explain how it's going to happen we don't know when it's going to happen we don't know what's going to trigger it all we can see the signs of the times but God has it all wrapped up in a little mystery and we'll understand it when it happens and probably not a whole lot more before that but watch what happens with these wise men we just read this said same where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him they've lost the star and they're saying we need some help here brother says up and down the streets witch men testifying like holy rollers where is he tell me where he is that's born King of the Jews for we've done seen his sign and we've come to worship him we saw his star in the east and we've come to worship him he says but they didn't have the end answer they haven't got it today the same thing now notice when God sends a sign into the church the church fails to see it this is an individual Affair and it's only for the elect he says same as they did then so what they made so much fuss about it until they had to call the San hedin Court to find out what this was all about it says when Herod heard the the king heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him why why are they troubled because you've got these men that can see a star that are proclaiming the birth of the Messiah and nobody else can see it but these men have been so convinced that they've traveled for two years from a far away country and they're convinced that the Christ has been born now they're coming to the Jews who are supposed to know this stuff it's meant for the Jews it's their Messiah it's their Christ and they're saying we don't see a star we haven't seen a star but yet clearly these men are convinced that there is one and it troubled them because they knew they ought to have seen it but they couldn't see it that they were talking about something that was in their scriptures but they couldn't place it in this time and season it says and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded to them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel so catch what's happened now the star has led them to Jerusalem and then it's disappeared it's left them high and dry for two years they've given everything they have and then it leads them to Jerusalem and then it disappears so they say well it's disappeared so clearly he must be in Jerusalem so they're going around trying to find him where is he where is he you guys are the people of the Messiah you ought to be able to tell us where the Messiah is and everyone's like there ain't no m mesiah what are you talking about nobody's got an answer but then what happens is they go to the word and they say well the word says he's going to be born in Bethlehem but their eyes are blinded to the season they're in they give him a word answer without recognizing the word is happening right now it's already happened and they didn't know it Their Eyes Were blinded even though they knew all about it catch this the Jews could have taken inspiration from the those wise men and went to Bethlehem and they still would not have found Christ why CU it takes a supernatural event to find Christ he's got to lead you to him you can't find him on your own they'd have gone and they could have searched all the Bethlehem and they'd have walked right over Jesus you know why cuz he looked just like you and I came from a broken home a mother with a bad reputation something wasn't quite right and they'd have completely said they have missed them completely why because they didn't have a supernatural word leading them they knew they had the knowledge of it but they didn't have a revelation of it knowledge wasn't going to get them to Christ scripture says few the few there are there many there they are called few are chosen right few there be that find it they had all the knowledge in the world but they didn't have a revelation of what it meant or that it was the time and the season it had put him in the right general area and you'll see it today I remember my wife I watching a man in Dallas Texas on YouTube maybe 78 years ago and he was going into the seals and he was getting so close but he couldn't hit the target why it wasn't revealed to him all of his study all of his knowledge all of his time it was getting close but it couldn't hit the target it takes God revealing himself to us amen says when they got the court out and opened up the scriptures that perhaps they hadn't read just their own Creeds for for years but as they read the scriptures they got Micah's prophecy that said in Bethlehem of Judea he says listen brother if the church hasn't got the answer to these signs and wonders the words got the of God's got the answer if your pastor hasn't got the answer God's word's got the answer if you're hungering for it God will show it to you in the word because God keeps his word every true servant of God points you to the word not to himself points you to the word because the word has the answer that ought to be it if we're dropping down into the ranks of ministerial opinion we've lost something we need a word answer for our lives every day scripture continues it says then Herod when he had privily called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared so Herod wants to know how long it's been since that star appeared cuz the star said that's when he was born and Herod needs to know how old are the children that he has to kill this is how Herod knows that he's got to kill the two and under two-year-old and underr it says says and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also now when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East so they saw it they followed it then it disappeared but now it's back as soon as they leave Jerusalem it comes back it went before them until it came and stood over where the young child was so notice it didn't just take them to Bethlehem it didn't just take him to the street it took them to the specific house where Christ was it took them right exactly to where they needed to be it takes a supernatural experience to find Christ amen you can't fight him he's got to lead you to himself it says now when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy we're speaking of Rejoice this morning says and as soon as they found out the place where that this thing was to take place they left the city and the council setting thinking what they would do they'd have to get rid of this this couldn't get breezed around amongst the people they'd have to stop this because it would break up their tradition they'd have to put an end to it so all those religious people could think to do was to suppress it he says and the wise men had to get away from that he says and as the wise men went out of the city Gates as soon as they got out of that gloomy place the star appeared again he says when you come out of the world and its Traditions the glory of God will appear to you and will lead you when you come out of yourself and out of your sins out of your unbelief and leave it all behind and raise your heart to God then God will appear to you he says and when they saw that star again the Bible said they rejoiced with exceeding great joy they must have shouted a little exceeding great joy for they knew that they were following the sign that was going to lead them to the Savior and it did just that notice their rejoicing was over the right thing and the right thing LED them to what they were looking for it says may I say tonight that God has a sign today and it's a sign of his spirit that where Jesus is there's life for he is life where Jesus is there's Gospel Light for he is light and where Jesus is there is fire for he is a consuming fire that burns up all your unbelief and your draws oh my church we have some dross that needs to be burned out this morning the little lumps the little bumps the little flaws the little failures the little lims amen the little impurities that hold us back so many times see we've got people that will say he's life and he's light but what about the fire brother Bram said I'd rather a little Wildfire than no fire at all sometimes we're so worried about what it's going to do that we don't let it do what it's supposed to do amen amen let's not quench the spirit of God but notice what was their time of rejoicing we're speaking on rejoice this morning there's a 2-year Journey that's happened then they come in and they lose the star but they've spent two years of hardship two years over valleys and mountains and winter cold and summer heat and desert and rivers and floods and all sorts of adversities faithfully following that star let me say something you're going to face difficulties you're going to face hard times now here's the question what's your attitude going to be because they had a star that was going before them so when they came up to that that river that was flooded and everyone else would have pulled back they could sit there and they could groan and say we're going to get wet and we're probably going to die and they get down at the mouth or they could say the star is on the other side and that star is a guarantee that I'm going to make it that the god that's led us this far will take us through the flash flooded Rivers will take us over the mountain will take us through the deep snow will take us through the land where there is no water we can say that he's led us th far and so we've got to keep going and he'll guarantee our safety or we can sit here and say woe is me life is so difficult either he's LED you here or he hasn't church either he's real or he's not either you're a Believer or you're not either he's LED you this far or it's been all in your head either that or you've LED yourself astray and if we've LED ourselves astray Church we've got to take us back to where we left him cuz sometimes we are sometimes we get out of his will sometimes we make our own decisions and we've got to be mature enough to say that was me it wasn't him and go back to where we left him but if he's leading us then we ought to be able to go through whatever he's taking us through cuz he's leading and he doesn't lead us in there to kill us he leads us to overcome it amen to survive everything he brings us through what do you think they felt like when that star disappeared Faithfully two years risking life and limb ridiculed seeing something that nobody else sees Lord I'm trusting you and then God disappears The Light disappears the thing that they've been leading them for so long left it do you think they said well that's it we've been fooling ourselves sit down and have a good cry no they didn't do that they said he took us this far he'll take us all away and they started digging and they started seeking and they started asking until they got the answer that they were looking for sometimes God takes us in a particular direction like I said before he's just trying to get us started and we have no idea what Waits us we don't know what the journey is going to look like we don't even know what the end's truly going to look like but he's just getting us going and then we come to a place and it seems like our leadership was for nothing I've experienced that in my life many of you know I mean I've been I've traveled a lot in the 20 years I've since I left the church Church in 20 2003 I've been to a lot of places a lot of Ministries made and lost a lot of friends sat under all kinds of preaching all kinds of people and there were times where I said what's going on doesn't seem like anything's happening just seems like all it's come to is failure many of you know the stories I've told Pastor fell away and these different things you sit there and say did I miss the will of God but now 20 years later you can look back and say he was leading me every step of the way because you see the effect and I survived where many people would not survive we've got to be able in the times when it seems like he's not there say he's led me this far I'm standing on the word and he'll keep me going he'll show me the way amen there was times I absolutely felt what's next what am I doing here why am I still here but he had a plan but he actually had a time and a season for those things God never forsakes us church and his word is always there for direction it's always there and I would say it this way when God gives you a direction keep going in that direction until he until he stops and you say well I can't see him keep going in the direction he showed you last cuz when he wants you to turn a corner he'll show you when to turn a corner and he'll put a stop and that's what he did here was they got into the right place they just weren't in the exact right place they were in the right land they're in the right General vicinity but they needed to go someplace specific amen so they didn't Panic they didn't turn back they didn't sell off their gifts they didn't give up they started banging on doors walking down the street saying does anybody know where the king of the Jews is and they didn't rest until they got an answer and what was the key that unlocked it Church the word of God maybe they didn't have all of the scriptures they hadn't studied it all the way that the Jews had but the answer was unlocked in the word of God and notice Jerusalem might have seemed the obvious place that was the capital the city of David City of Peace but it wasn't that word LED them right out of Jerusalem into a little lowly town called Bethlehem but notice when they rejoiced they didn't re when they saw Christ they rejoice when they saw the word leading them they rejoiced even while they were on the journey they rejoiced before they even got to see the Fulfillment before the end of everything that they'd worked for all the travel that they put on you know so often we wait until the end to rejoice and we miss out the joy of the journey that's why we're talking about it this morning if you can find your place in the word if you can find yourself in the will of God and the promise of God then the journey can be as enjoyable as the destination that you can have joy whether you're in a season of uh of greatness and goodness and and all these things happening or whether you're in a lean season whether it's winter or summer spring or fall whether you're on a Mountaintop or down in a valley whether you're walking alone or whether you got some fellowship along the way you can Rejoice because you see the word going ahead of you our attitude now is what matters as to how this journey is going to go you can get to heaven sad down at the mouth or you can get there Joy full of joy full of thankfulness full of the goodness of God the attitude doesn't change what you get just changes how you get it I'd rather come to Heaven happy I'd rather come to Heaven rejoicing in the way I've gone rather than boning my fate because I've had rough years and I've had great years but the ability to be content with the leading and provision of God through all of it is a Grace that I believe is available to us amen scripture says he's bringing us to an expected end and if you know the end you can rejoice in the in the journey that's taking you there amen when you've got a burning in your heart when the word is being quickened to you that's a time when you can Rejoice even though you don't see it yet because he doesn't Quicken it without an intention of giving you what he's quickened to you amen what is it it's God being personal that's why we need to have our devotions and read our Bibles so God can be personal you know how many times when we have special meetings and I get up and I say if God gets personal Rejoice I don't want a generic message I don't want a generic gospel I want God to come in and sit down in the Pew right next to me and give me what I need whether I like it or not CU I'm not always going to like it as in it's not always going to feel good it's not always going to build me up sometimes it's going to tear me down sometimes going to knock some things off amen but if he's personal then that means he he cares about me he loves me cuz God gets real personal with sons and daughters amen what's he doing he's showing you his way of bringing you back into his presence says and so the wise men when they heard that they struck out the gate and as soon as they left that old cold backslid and formal place there hung the star again the star was there and the Bible said they rejoiced with exceeding great joy oh I might say they shouted a little when they found it that that blessed Supernatural that they had seen when they got out of them old cold formal ways it appeared again there was and had led them to Bethlehem where they found that one where he who was Emanuel was being raised up in a carpenter shop poor says and when they came into the H they were com into the house they saw the young child not a baby remember they saw a babe in a Manger now it's a young child he's grown with Mary his mother and they fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh brother R says and when they and they unloaded everything they had and laid it at his feet he says and they worshiped him because they know the light had come and the savior of the world was being born they gave everything they had because God had given God so loved the world friend and that's you and I that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterian the Infidel whatever you are whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life what you're seeking for he says have life what's the battle Church to keep seeking they didn't stop they didn't rest they didn't sit down on the corner they didn't take a suite in the hotel they walked and they asked and they sought and they sought until they got their answer the scripture says seek and you'll find knock and it'll be opened unto you but you've got to seek you've got to knock you've got to press you got to push you got to say Lord I'm waiting on you I'm trusting in you don't blindly set off in a direction of your own choosing find your way into the presence of God find your way into the word of God and stay there until he gives you an answer there's nothing so critical that we have to make a decision on our own nothing nothing amen but as soon as he gives you Direction that's when you can Rejoice because if he gives you Direction then he's got a way to work it all out and he's got a plan he's got a purpose and all of these things there's a certainty when God's leading us that allows us to have the celebration before we ever reach the Finish Line the scripture you know we we have that old Cathedral song that I mentioned so many times I've read the back of the book and we win that means we can Rejoice about the victory even while we're in the midst of the battle you know what and when can you imagine that you know that you know that you know that you can't lose if you truly knew you couldn't lose what confidence ought we to have if you had a battle you know they they have that that famous battle of the 300 Spartans that went up against the I don't know if it was a Persian king I think it was 300 and they stood in this this spot where it got real narrow and for days and days and days they fought hundreds of thousands and they believed they could never be defeated and they held and they held and they held until finally the enemy got up above them and behind them and that's the only thing that brought them down a traitor took them down but for days for weeks they held off an army that was thousands their size they didn't believe they could be beaten they were trained to believe that nobody could beat them and guess what when the Persians got through them they went in and an army of Spartans destroyed the entire Persian army outnumbered massively they didn't believe they could be beaten scripture says we've already overcome he overcame for us we're facing a defeated enemy that's trying to Bluff us out of the promises of God if we truly believe we can't be beaten we probably act a little differently when we go through trials when we go through situations when Satan comes knocking on our door Amen brother Braham says and when these wise men saw that word of God said a star would rise out of Jacob they followed that little god-given token to the source of eternal light so will wise men today who are not blinded by Creeds will follow the god-given spoken word till see there's a gap I remember when Brother David Nash was here and he he said pay attention to those little marks in your Bible those little commas and those semicolons because it means a period of time we're following a star we're following a god-given message for this hour aren't we he says follow it till that means there's a span of time between there's a journey remember what Paul said you did run well what did hinder thee don't let what's happening in the journey hinder you keep pressing forward don't let anything Sidetrack you don't let anything keep you from finishing he says they will follow the god-given spoken word until they see the fullness of the power of God blooming forth in this hour they see it they know that it's here in the scripture God promised it for this day that's what we're believing amen we're believing for the supernatural in every aspect of Our Lives you I was talking with a brother recently and we were talking about that third poll and brother Brown says it won't be a public show why because it's an individual Affair only one person at a time went into that little room and what happened there was a mystery even to the person that experienced it but they knew the effect they knew that something had happened that something had changed and that's what's going on on in little Believers lives little wives at home little husbands in in our humble jobs and humble places and these different things but yet the word of God is coming forth and it's doing a work a supernatural work to prepare a bride that's going to go out amen you I'm reminded of the Prophet Elijah on Mount Carmel and he had a showdown up there and he proved God as the real God before all the people he killed the 400 false prophets and he'd offered an atonement for Israel their sin was covered and they had returned back to worshiping God if you remember they've been in a time of drought for 3 and 1/2 years at his word at the prophet's word no rain had fallen no DW had come and for 3 and 1/2 years the rain had ceased and nothing was there and Israel was brought back into obedience to the word and so Elijah knew that he could speak the word and Rain would come but I want you to see something because we're speaking of Rejoice this morning and you know the wise men rejoice when they saw the star but you'll see here that as you come into maturity the rejoicing can start even even before you see something because when you take God at his word you can rejoice as if you already have what he's given that's what happens as you become more mature as you start to realize your position in Christ it can be expressed in your expectation that you can worship like brother Bram said if they give you money to buy a loaf of bread you can rejoice as if you have the loaf of bread and that's what the word is is it's the price paid all you have to do is go to the store and get the food as you mature you can rejoice as soon soon as you see it in the word as soon as he quickens it to you my sister Alanta you many of you have seen her testimony being healed from cancer but when that scripture struck her that by his stripes we are healed she rejoiced then because the word was Quicken to her and so as soon as she goes back to the doctors she has the proof of what she already knew because she had accepted the word and she rejoiced in the receiving of the word having not seen any results yet that's what we happens as we mature that's what happens as we're quick to the word listen now as we start to close said and Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain it hasn't rained in three and a half years Church Elijah hasn't even said a word yet he hasn't done a thing and yet he's telling the king he says I can hear the rain already and it ain't just a bit of rain it's a big rain it's an abundance of rain it's a rainstorm it's going to be a life-changing storm have the rain is coming dry as a bone nothing happening Clear Blue Skies hot as blazes and he says I hear the sound of abundance of rain everything's crying for rain conditions are ripe for rain because Israel has come back to God and Elijah says I can hear the abundance of rain nothing visible nothing changing but he says there's rain coming says so Ahab went up to eat and drink and Elijah went up to the top of caramel and he cast himself down upon the Earth and put his face between his knees so he's already said rain's coming and lots of it and now he goes and he prays to God for rain he's already declared it now he's going to go ask for it and then he said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and he said there is nothing nothing the prophet of God remember God said there'll be no rain except by Thy word and now he gives the word he speaks the word and nothing happens I don't have the quote here I don't think but brother Braham says unbelief can catch that he says watch what unbelief would have done in that situation but Elijah is not an unbeliever he's a Believer he and he said go again seven times so six times Elijah says go check and tell me if something's coming and six times nothing happens six is the number of man you can do everything in your power and nothing will happen he says brother Bram says remember there's nothing wrong with the Elijah's Faith there's nothing wrong with this prayer there's nothing wrong with this condition there's nothing wrong brother Braham says this he says you know what's the matter with the churches today we give up too quick Elijah stayed there and he prayed and he prayed and he prayed until something happened you say Lord I shouldn't have to pray and pray and pray I'm going to pray the prayer of faith and it should happen no there is an enduring there's a persevering for the real believer that says I'll not let you go until you answer until you give me what I'm seeking he says if men and women in here who wants Christ or the Holy Ghost who want to be healed if they would just stay there and say Lord you promised it you promised it then feel that little trickle little Trickle not this thing that swoops over you always a little Trickle and say here it is Lord I accept it he says something's going to happen says and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a massive raincloud out of the sea no a little cloud like a man's hand like this a little cloud like this is coming out of the ocean Elijah barely worth talking about we've seen little moves before and nothing happened remember we're talking about the Journey Church we're talking about rejoicing in the journey we fac situations like this all the time we've done everything we need to do we've met every requirement of God we prayed the prayer of faith and now we're in prayer and we're looking and we're watching and sometimes it's just us we don't know what everyone's praying in their little closet in the little things that you talk to the Lord about it's just us looking and we're believing because we're called to believe but does it always happen in just one moment no sometimes things have to Tumble Bit by Bit by Bit remember brother BR talking about speak to the mountain he says sometimes it might just be a little grain of sand that moved and you don't see it but it's still moved and it's God working on the situation amen what is it many times there's a delay many times it's something small that turns into something big and our response is what's so key here our attitude the way that we respond to what's happening Brother Bram says watch Elijah get the rain barrels out I hear the sound of abundance of rain he says the first little move he says Glory the first little move at the pool of Bethesda they rushed to get to it amen oh if the people here if you haven't received the Holy Ghost this morning morning if that first Little Tinker would say that's the truth that man is telling the word that's the truth then hurry as quick as you can don't wait what are you looking at what are you waiting for the hour is later than you think get moving towards it as fast as you can why he says when Elijah saw that move that little Cloud the size of a man's hand he says it was the evidence of an answered prayer there's no rainf falling there's no ch really there's just a tiny little thing that's happened that didn't happen six times before he said it was evidence of an answered prayer you say that's that's a cloud the size of a man's hand that's not an answer brother John it's an answer if you've got the right attitude it's an answer if you're a Believer it's not an answer if you're a hot house plant says and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said said behold there ariseth a little Cloud out of the sea like a man's hand and he said go up and say unto Ahab prepare thy Chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not C capture the the ludicrous elements of this statement a cloud this big is going to stop ahab's Chariot there's going to be so much rain come out of a little cloud like this that ahab's got to get moving now otherwise he's going to get stuck and he's not going to make it off the off the mountain silliness Elijah's crazy it says and it came to pass in the meanwhile little space of time that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and Abraham Ro and Ahab rode and went to Jezreel and the Hand of the Lord was on Elijah and he gted up his loins and ran before Ahab to the entrance of jezrael I don't have to quote here for the sake of time but brother Bram says that that that uh Elijah got rejuvenated under that rign it made him young again and he outran the king's horses and chariots that's what happens when you can Rejoice before you see the reality he says the sign of the hand in the sky Elijah said that cloud the size of a man's hand like a vapor what was it catch his church he kept believing he was believing he saw that and it didn't diminish his faith it expanded it he kept believing I hear the sound of abundance of rain that cloud become two clouds two clouds become a hill a hill become a mountain the mountain become Another Mountain the first thing you know the whole skies were thundering and rain was falling what was it he accepted what God sent Church the answer is the answer God is God whatever he sends is the answer we need so often we can sit sit there and we can say this isn't what I wanted this isn't what I expected church either you're a son or daughter of God or you're not and if you are then you're led by the spirit of God and so his answer his provision whatever it is is his answer for your prayer to your situation and you've got to keep believing that it'll produce exactly what you've been asking for amen we've already seen the Star Church we've seen the the the this the the angel messenger of Revelation 1 and Revelation 3 and Revelation 10 and we can Rejoice at that but that's a sign that's already moved on the Stars disappeared it hovered and it led us to Christ cuz remember the prophet's not the not the end result it's just part of the journey the end of it is Christ remember like like Eleazar leading Rebecca to Isaac it was just part of the journey but then when she got there only Isaac was in the tent right there was a changing of the guard there was a changing of the light and now we're in his presence we're in the shikina glory amen and that's where the supernatural truly happens in our lives not in the presence of a prophet in the presence of the son of man in the presence of the Holy Spirit itself amen there's a second book of Acts that's being written and then there's a scripture says the people will know their God and do exploits that's where we're at the only thing ahead for us is a resurrection and a Rapture that's all the prophet said he says a student of the scripture the only thing I see is a Rapture that's what we're getting ready for that's what we're focused on Amen and if you've received the Holy Ghost you can rejoice in the journey that we're on that when you don't see it all happening right now you can Rejoice because he's promised it because you've received a word you've accepted a word that said that you are his child and that he's going to dwell with you he's going to be with you and the same works that he did he's doing in your life not all of it right now but he's always working he's always leading he's always drawing he's always filling always pushing out amen let's stand together as we read this last quote brother Braham said oh brothers and sisters be encouraged then he says straighten up now this is just me I don't think he means straighten up like get your house in order he's saying lift up lift your heads up straighten your backs up don't get bowed down don't get don't get wearied don't get worried straighten up things are moving he says we're nearing something you'll hear the sound of abundance of rain for one of these days the curtains will be draw back from the heavens and God will pour out his Spirit without measure among that group of people that's fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas he says and what a meeting we'll have you can look back on your life and you know at the end of the year and you look back at what's happened and hasn't been easy all the time this year we haven't all had beds of ease and these different things some harder than others some easier than others but you know we can look back and we can say God's Grace has been with us through it all amen that his healing has been here his presence has been here his guidance has been here his discernments been here his Provisions been here and we ought to be able to rejoice in what he's done recogniz what he's doing and be in expectation for what he's going to do amen amen I'm looking for a resurrection and Rapture there's nothing left church and we see what's happening remember brother Braham said Israel is God's time clock there's only one nation holding back the wrath of this world from Israel right now that's the United States and they're slowly backing away it could be gone tomorrow and when the World Turns against Israel we know that Armageddon is not far away that's where we're at brother Braham says it's closer than you think amen but in all of that he said when you see these things look up cuz you're Redemption is I amen the worse it gets the more we ought to Rejoice the more we see things falling apart the more we see things breaking up the the more ridiculous the more insane this world gets we ought to be in a in an attitude and a spirit of rejoicing because it means we're that much closer to a body change and then that Nan I'm I'm convinced that Nan is going to be the one sister coffe is going to be the one that knocks on my door one morning whoever that loved one is that's gone on but I don't want to wait till then to Rejoice I don't want to wait till then to have joy in the Holy Ghost and man I don't believe we're meant to suffer through all this I don't believe we're meant to be down in the mouth overworked overstressed I don't believe that that I believe there's a place of rejoicing where we can rest in knowing that he does all things well he's got our lives in his hands he won't lose a one of us you look around and you say like Israel it's been dry for three and a half years whether it's loved ones that haven't come to the Lord ones that have left the Lord and it seems things are devolving rather than evolving towards what they should be say Lord I believe and I'm going to Rejoice at every little thing that I see that points to your word being fulfilled that my prayers have been answered like Daniel Daniel waited three weeks remember what the angel said he heard you the first time but I was delayed because of the battle amen don't let the delay stop the rejoicing amen have faith in who you are have faith in what he's called you to be and trust that the answers on the way amen God bless you let's bow our heads Lord God Lord how thankful we are that we have a light that's leading lord it's definitely not me it's not a man Lord but it's your divine presence through your quickening word Lord that's drawing us up into a resurrection and a Rapture Lord and it's causing us to leave the things of this World Behind Lord It's cutting those strings lord it's removing those little things that so easily beset us Lord and you're pulling us through and your lord your your fire is burning out those dross and impurities Lord It's purifying us Lord help us to rejoice in those moments Lord for when we look around there's not many going through a purifying process but Lord you're calling us to a higher Place Lord you're calling us to give you're calling us to rest you're calling us to trust you're calling us to believe that you do all things well Lord God lord you see each heart and each life that's here Lord you see the hardships we Face the trials the sickness Lord you see everything Lord help us to rejoice in the path you've led us Lord and if we've walked away Lord bring us back quickly to your will Lord so we can rest in the promises of your word Lord be with us now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen can we sing that song the goodness of God 12:54 I love you Lord for your Mery never fails [Music] me and all my days I've been
