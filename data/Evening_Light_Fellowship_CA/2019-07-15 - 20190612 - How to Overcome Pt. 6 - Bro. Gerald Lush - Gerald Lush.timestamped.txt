[48:36] it works out by the grace of God they
[48:38] met and again you know you would like to
[48:41] have most most of the Saints here amen
[48:44] and it's very very few I guess that's

[48:52] I pray and grace that you're following
[48:55] the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[48:57] is that what you want is what he wants a
[48:59] man but what he wants you to do where he
[49:03] wants to go as I keep saying and then
[49:05] when he wants you to go and how he wants
[49:07] you to go so on so the grace that God be
[49:10] with us but I tell you it takes death to
[49:12] self to really become alive to him and
[49:16] follow his leadership not my will but
[49:19] thine be done you got to die amen
[49:22] and that's what Jesus did he was laying
[49:25] down his will when it comes to physical
[49:27] because he knew what the word required
[49:30] and he stayed with the word so he said
[49:32] not my will he died to self he died to
[49:35] the fears of the flesh remember oh yeah
[49:37] he was Jesus but he experienced fear he
[49:41] was tempted in all points like as we are
[49:43] yet without seeing and so he experienced
[49:46] all these things even unto fear but he
[49:49] got to the place an angel came and
[49:51] ministered to him amen and he said not
[49:54] my real father dying be done he let go

[1:00:45] know I want this or I want that or you
[1:00:48] might think I need this and I need that
[1:00:49] what is the will of God a man in all
[1:00:53] circumstances and in all situations if
[1:00:56] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:00:59] himself and take up his cross and follow
[1:01:04] me for whoever will save his life shall
[1:01:07] lose it
[1:01:08] a man gracious that we want to lose our
[1:01:13] lives in this world and we'll find our
[1:01:15] lives in the world of God and whosoever
[1:01:19] will lose his life for my sake amen
[1:01:23] now living for yourselves but you living
[1:01:25] for Jesus and whosoever will live it and
[1:01:28] lose his life for my sake shall find it
[1:01:31] for what is a man profited if he shall
[1:01:35] gain the whole world and lose his own
[1:01:39] soul amen grace of God be with us to
[1:01:43] give us the understanding we need to put
[1:01:45] us on our guard so that we're gonna be
[1:01:47] on our toes not my will going to be done
[1:01:49] a man for what is a man profited if he
[1:01:56] shall gain the whole world and lose his
[1:01:59] own soul or what shall a man give in
[1:02:03] exchange for his soul for the Son of man
[1:02:07] shall come in the glory of his father
[1:02:09] with his angels and then he shall reward
[1:02:14] every man according to his works a man
[1:02:20] that the works that are reflecting the
[1:02:23] word works that reflect the will of God
[1:02:26] in your life
[1:02:27] a man verily I say unto you there be
[1:02:31] some standing here which shall not taste
[1:02:33] of death till they see the Son of man
[1:02:37] coming in his kingdom god bless his
[1:02:41] words you may be seated
[1:02:44] turn we meet at saint luke's gospel
[1:02:46] chapter 9 let's make sure that we are in
[1:02:54] the will of god make sure we're doing
[1:02:56] the will of god and sometimes there's a
[1:03:00] price to pay because even paul we have
[1:03:05] the record in the in the scriptures
[1:03:07] concerning the apostle paul a messenger
[1:03:09] to the first age that he got caught up
[1:03:12] with his emotion but not his faith and
[1:03:15] it wasn't a revelation from god it was
[1:03:18] his census and maybe it was the enemy
[1:03:20] that was influencing paul
[1:03:22] because they wanted to go to Asia and
[1:03:25] then they journey to Asia and they were
[1:03:27] going to do this and we're going to do
[1:03:29] that but it didn't work they realized
[1:03:34] but too late that it wasn't the will of
[1:03:36] God amen and Paul said we hurt so much
[1:03:40] he said they we we wanted to die things
[1:03:44] were going so bad for them in Asia
[1:03:46] he said we wanted to die but again the
[1:03:48] grace of God was there to bring them
[1:03:50] back to Israel a man bringing back to
[1:03:54] those for whom he was a messenger for
[1:03:57] that age a man and to do what God wanted
[1:04:00] him to do and when God wanted to do it
[1:04:02] and where God wanted to do it so let's
[1:04:04] make sure that we're in the will of God
[1:04:05] and doing the will of God and that God
[1:04:07] is God is able at any time to contact us
[1:04:10] amen and that put us into his service
[1:04:13] amen wherever it is whatever it is we're
[1:04:16] going to do the will of God we want the
[1:04:19] will of God by the grace of God so truly
[1:04:22] brothers sister a man truly we am to be
[1:04:26] dead to ourselves and alive to him amen
[1:04:29] so why so there were sensitive to him
[1:04:32] and not to ourselves sensitive to his
[1:04:35] leadership and his faith but not to our
[1:04:37] own not on what I want to do Lord what
[1:04:40] do you want me to do amen
[1:04:42] by the grace of Almighty God a man this
[1:04:45] is tremendous in Luke chapter 9 and
[1:04:47] verse 23 and he said unto them all If
[1:04:53] any man will come after me let him deny
[1:04:57] himself take up his cross daily deny
[1:05:02] yourself take up your cross daily not
[1:05:06] just Wednesday and Sunday but you take
[1:05:10] up your cross daily you're living for
[1:05:12] him everyday amen
[1:05:14] we're in contact with him every day when
[1:05:16] they get up in the morning you greet the
[1:05:18] Lord a man you're asking for the grace
[1:05:21] of his presence and continue with you
[1:05:23] through the day when you're going you go
[1:05:24] to bed at night you're going to say good
[1:05:26] night to the Lord asking the grace of
[1:05:27] his presence to watch over you and to
[1:05:30] protect us amen by the grace of Almighty
[1:05:33] God old brother it's so important to us
[1:05:36] to die to ourselves and swim and brother
[1:05:38] I tell you this there's only one way for
[1:05:40] us to be to do that we had to be
[1:05:42] overcomers to be dead to yourself you
[1:05:45] had to be a spiritual overcomer
[1:05:47] a man in your soul and your body and
[1:05:50] your spirit if you're overcoming your
[1:05:52] soul then you're you got the power and
[1:05:54] you got the anointing to overcome in
[1:05:55] your spirit and to overcome in your
[1:05:58] flesh by the grace of God you have the
[1:06:00] power over the devil a man and this is
[1:06:03] what we want to be an overcomer we have
[1:06:06] to have that power we are there that
[1:06:08] Ananya we are overcomers we will have
[1:06:10] that power if we are overcomers we will
[1:06:12] have that anointing because what do we
[1:06:14] do we did exactly what God told us to do
[1:06:16] what must I do to be saying what must
[1:06:19] they do they're back here what must they
[1:06:20] do in every age to be saying repent amen
[1:06:23] is anything that God expects first and
[1:06:26] foremost in your relationship with them
[1:06:28] is repentance amen
[1:06:30] you got the attitude of repentance you
[1:06:32] got the spirit of repentance he made
[1:06:34] morning new tonight a man you're
[1:06:37] continually in there the attitude that
[1:06:40] spirit a mayor because if at any time
[1:06:42] you step out of the way if at any time
[1:06:44] you step out of his will if at any time
[1:06:46] that selfishness took over a man you got
[1:06:49] to repent a man and and you're going to
[1:06:52] call on the Lord for more and more of
[1:06:54] his anointing more and more of his
[1:06:56] presence amen so the devil will
[1:06:58] influence us less and less amen
[1:07:01] well the prophet of God was seen in
[1:07:03] madam chairman tackling that and again
[1:07:05] let me emphasize this is why he preached
[1:07:07] how can I overcome and again nitros
[1:07:10] adjust for Bamm tabernacle
[1:07:12] I believe it applies to a lot of messy
[1:07:14] churches amen
[1:07:16] he's now preaching to those are there he
[1:07:18] is preaching to believers amen
[1:07:20] he is preaching to those under his
[1:07:22] ministry amen oh my brother they they
[1:07:25] they believe brother around to be a
[1:07:26] prophet yes they do or they did and I
[1:07:30] have a profession belief that that this
[1:07:32] was a prophet of God in the pulpit there
[1:07:34] was a prophet of God that was
[1:07:35] ministering to them but then what they
[1:07:37] were they were putting the emphasis on
[1:07:38] was the signs the sight in the hand and
[1:07:41] the discernment amen not necessarily the
[1:07:44] word to put the emphasis on the word and
[1:07:46] the Bible Oh God began to see they
[1:07:49] they were drifting from the revelation
[1:07:51] of the word amen
[1:07:53] they're recognizing him as a messenger
[1:07:56] but what about the message amen there's
[1:08:00] one thing to recognize a messenger to
[1:08:01] receive a messenger it's another thing
[1:08:03] to receive the message a man I
[1:08:05] appreciate that some years ago about
[1:08:08] somebody coming to your door knocking on
[1:08:10] your door and you look out so I don't
[1:08:12] know who that is I mean I'm not going to
[1:08:14] go out there but they have a message for
[1:08:16] you
[1:08:17] amen so they'll keep knocking on till
[1:08:19] you answer but it took what for you to
[1:08:22] recognize the message for you to really
[1:08:25] take the message serious you've got to
[1:08:27] recognize that person as the right to
[1:08:30] deliver the message amen
[1:08:32] that person is ordained with the company
[1:08:34] that received it he's ordained to bring
[1:08:37] it from the company to the person that
[1:08:38] it was sent to a man and bribry preached
[1:08:41] on that years ago maybe it may be an
[1:08:44] empire avenue or another building that
[1:08:48] we were hearing but we've really got to
[1:08:51] recognize that it's from God we got to
[1:08:54] recognize they want to come to within
[1:08:55] brand well he was the prophet of God he
[1:08:57] was the servant of God but what about
[1:08:59] his message amen the many were coming as
[1:09:03] I said coming to see or robbers coming
[1:09:05] to see T laws weren't coming to see
[1:09:07] aaand but who was coming to see Jesus
[1:09:10] amen and again the Father God knew that
[1:09:13] they were coming to see him but they
[1:09:15] weren't coming to see Jesus they were
[1:09:16] seeing more and more and more a William
[1:09:19] Branham and less and less of Jesus amen
[1:09:21] as he was put out of the law to see in
[1:09:23] church age now there's many that came
[1:09:25] out of those ages into the message many
[1:09:28] of our putting them out of their lives
[1:09:29] he never had the control of their lives
[1:09:33] amen oh he control their doctrine you
[1:09:36] know the common when it comes to the
[1:09:37] serpent seed and water baptism and all
[1:09:41] the other doctrines said the power of
[1:09:43] God was highlighting God was
[1:09:44] highlighting in the province ministry
[1:09:46] but when it comes to a God having
[1:09:49] control their personal lives
[1:09:50] no power God was seen less and less
[1:09:54] young and old because he did a question
[1:09:58] about the the young ray if they're going
[1:10:00] to lose their experience if they're
[1:10:02] lose this and they're going to lose
[1:10:03] their touch with goddess of mine he said
[1:10:06] it's going to be pretty bad he suffer
[1:10:09] for all the rest amen
[1:10:11] because God and God is depending on the
[1:10:13] young to maintain their testing not too
[1:10:15] young by the old to maintain their
[1:10:16] testimony and examples to the to the
[1:10:20] young by the grace of God God Elvis
[1:10:22] rather no no your now brother believing
[1:10:25] that the the younger generation is as
[1:10:27] man Saul for sure they had that
[1:10:29] generation and now God is depending on
[1:10:32] you oh yeah most definitely
[1:10:34] God's depending on you God depends on
[1:10:37] Noah and at the time of the flood and to
[1:10:41] build the ark and he had the supervisor
[1:10:42] he has Elam is telling this tell him
[1:10:44] that but brother I tell you this after
[1:10:47] after the flood now going in the Guyana
[1:10:50] God took Noah where was God dependent on
[1:10:52] God wasn't Benny on his sons Amen and
[1:10:55] their descendants and but again we know
[1:10:58] that there was there was one son that
[1:11:00] never stayed with the truth once I never
[1:11:02] stayed with the word and God God had to
[1:11:04] cut them all amen you know we know that
[1:11:07] Surrency did come through the ark man we
[1:11:10] know that it was in the women sure it
[1:11:12] was there a man but but again as some of
[1:11:17] them into fell fell subject to that
[1:11:18] Spiritist of the Serpent's he smear amen
[1:11:22] letting letting that spirit control them
[1:11:24] but I pray the guard god help us in this
[1:11:26] iron in this range a man that worry
[1:11:29] where we're going to stay with the word
[1:11:31] God took know of the men off the field
[1:11:33] but there are others who stay with the
[1:11:35] word and I meant again we know that
[1:11:37] before Noah went we know Enoch walked
[1:11:39] with God and he was raptured amai he
[1:11:42] walked with God and I did it is that's
[1:11:45] what made him an overcomer
[1:11:47] and brother he overcome the world he
[1:11:50] overcome the flesh and he overcome the
[1:11:52] devil and he oh he overcome this whole
[1:11:54] world he overcome the life that he was
[1:11:56] living in the flesh a man because he was
[1:11:58] raptured he was changed why by our
[1:12:01] brother what what how did he walk with
[1:12:04] God what kind of a relationship that he
[1:12:06] had with God then how much of an
[1:12:09] overcomer was he that he overcome the
[1:12:12] world and he overcome the flesh and
[1:12:14] overcome the devil and he any and he
[1:12:16] stepped at a time into eternity this is
[1:12:18] absolutely amazing because now God is
[1:12:21] requiring that of us in this generation
[1:12:24] God's requiring that of us in this age
[1:12:26] brother that we have a brother we have
[1:12:29] gone beyond the are the loudest cities
[1:12:31] where it were supposedly in a bride age
[1:12:33] and in the bride age is the union of the
[1:12:36] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:12:38] bride by the grace of Almighty God
[1:12:41] brother I trust say we recognize
[1:12:43] ourselves for who we are as truly as the
[1:12:46] Bride of Christ and you conduct yourself
[1:12:49] as the Bride of Christ brother neither
[1:12:51] brighter oh there are the denominations
[1:12:53] no no they let him go there anything
[1:12:57] they want there
[1:12:58] my God has called it a bride a man I
[1:13:00] trust we are bright but the public are
[1:13:03] recognized that a lot that came out of
[1:13:05] denominations was not Brian al are they
[1:13:08] were under under the realms of the
[1:13:10] message and the same they believed the
[1:13:13] message and follow him with her man they
[1:13:14] were not bright a man and again that's
[1:13:17] what he warned us he said you can be out
[1:13:20] of it and still a part of it because you
[1:13:22] got the spirit of it amen and there are
[1:13:25] those around this message they they're
[1:13:26] still salvation it's because they come
[1:13:29] out of the Salvation Army they still got
[1:13:31] the spirit of it the modern-day spirit
[1:13:33] amen
[1:13:34] and the same with Pentecostals they came
[1:13:36] out of Pentecost and they're still going
[1:13:37] to put a console spirit ain't man and
[1:13:40] then a brother brother brother this God
[1:13:43] brings us out to give us his spirit and
[1:13:46] his anointing for this hour and with
[1:13:48] this age not just a recognized Luther
[1:13:50] not just a recognized Wesley not just a
[1:13:52] recognized the Pentecostals and what God
[1:13:54] was doing through there but now is to
[1:13:57] recognize the bridegroom that the right
[1:13:59] ruler has come the brother has descended
[1:14:02] from heaven with a shout amen the
[1:14:05] bridegroom at entry ended through the
[1:14:06] Word of God through the message of the
[1:14:08] hour amen brother amen this is what God
[1:14:12] did then what's God doing now brother
[1:14:14] and it goes beyond with Lorena because
[1:14:16] he's gone that way that was there there
[1:14:19] all praise the Lord that the Ministry of
[1:14:21] the probably was there to reveal a sauna
[1:14:23] man revealing lease on a man
[1:14:26] relationship is not with him Branham our
[1:14:29] relationship is with the son of man hey
[1:14:31] man
[1:14:32] praise the Lord he said I am the
[1:14:34] resurrection and the life and then again
[1:14:38] it wasn't with Loretta it was Jesus
[1:14:40] because the part of God even with the
[1:14:42] Eve with the gifts and deserting the
[1:14:44] thoughts and intents of the heart the
[1:14:45] sign of the hand now he said you know he
[1:14:48] said I can't do this he said well who
[1:14:51] was doing it it was Jesus amen the Son
[1:14:55] of Man descended from heaven with a
[1:14:57] shout and the public guards to the
[1:14:59] science and to the Ministry of the word
[1:15:01] was revealing Jesus a man says Jesus in
[1:15:06] the Alpha ministry and he went forth
[1:15:08] with his signs and his wonders amen and
[1:15:11] he got their attention but again then he
[1:15:13] gave them the word concerning who he was
[1:15:16] oh my he saw him my father won and it
[1:15:21] upset the scribes and Pharisees allowed
[1:15:23] these of what oh they said this man is
[1:15:25] crazy
[1:15:26] this means the devil he's making himself
[1:15:28] equal with God he's making himself God
[1:15:31] and so on
[1:15:32] oh they got really upset no they they
[1:15:34] were attracted to it they wanted his
[1:15:36] signs and wonders wonders and all of
[1:15:38] these things but not the word Amen they
[1:15:41] continued not in the word that's why he
[1:15:44] put the emphasis there in John if you
[1:15:46] continue in the word then are you my
[1:15:48] disciples indeed amen
[1:15:50] but again they never continued in the
[1:15:52] word they continued in signs and wonders
[1:15:54] amen and Jesus would always bring out
[1:15:56] the word to separate amen God has always
[1:16:00] used the word to separate the believers
[1:16:03] from man from the unbelievers hey man
[1:16:05] or there are the unbelievers from the
[1:16:07] believers and doing in to a certain
[1:16:09] extent make believers from the believers
[1:16:11] amen
[1:16:12] as I told you concerning the the
[1:16:14] scripture there where Jesus would accept
[1:16:16] you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
[1:16:17] drink his blood you got no life in you
[1:16:19] all of that story for us in this hour
[1:16:21] two thousand years later but what did it
[1:16:23] mean they back there 2,000 years ago and
[1:16:26] here was a man that to them it was just
[1:16:28] he was just a man and to many that he
[1:16:31] was born out of wedlock
[1:16:32] Amen oh yeah they accuse them of the
[1:16:36] fornication and so on
[1:16:38] and they sing but
[1:16:40] but again they recognized oh yeah he's
[1:16:42] doing this he's doing that and the
[1:16:44] people who came and came and gay because
[1:16:46] they wanted God to do this for them want
[1:16:49] a God to do that
[1:16:50] amen the popular consciousness or
[1:16:52] problem buddies what are you going to do
[1:16:53] regard he said everybody wants God to do
[1:16:56] something for them but he said what
[1:16:58] about what are you going to do for God
[1:17:00] amen amen
[1:17:02] brother he witnessed it in this age he
[1:17:05] witnessed it in the Pentecostal revival
[1:17:07] he witness it in all rubbish ministry
[1:17:09] tea logs when a Yellin and many many
[1:17:11] other evangelists amen and some of them
[1:17:14] were even in Newfoundland 50 years ago
[1:17:16] or 55 or 60 years ago yes amen but again
[1:17:21] the thing that is what about the word
[1:17:23] what would the message amen
[1:17:25] they wanted the sunnies in the waters
[1:17:27] man and back then the emphasis was on
[1:17:29] shines and wonders and that's why
[1:17:31] brother Oral Roberts came to brother
[1:17:32] Branham and told him to stop preaching
[1:17:34] these things it's not preaching to you
[1:17:38] nobody but a woman should do how people
[1:17:40] should live how they should act and so
[1:17:42] on and he said brother brownie he said
[1:17:44] they're going to leave you if you don't
[1:17:45] stop preaching that and brother he was
[1:17:48] willing to pay the price or Roberts
[1:17:50] wasn't a man and Billy Graham and TLR
[1:17:54] husband and all the rest they were not
[1:17:55] willing to pay the price not not by any
[1:17:57] means buddy but with her men and worse
[1:17:59] he says somebody unappreciated the word
[1:18:02] amen it's the truth the whole truth and
[1:18:04] nothing but the truth
[1:18:05] it is thus say the Lord it is written
[1:18:08] and sweetie he had brother brought
[1:18:10] Robert sort of walked away amen because
[1:18:13] he compromised and what did all due
[1:18:15] respect to our brother but what did he
[1:18:17] do he got raised about this and then he
[1:18:19] way God gave me the revelation of the
[1:18:21] Pentecostal revival guy came in the
[1:18:23] anointing of signs and wonders and he
[1:18:26] went for that a tremendous ministry but
[1:18:29] then he became more and more and more
[1:18:31] intellectual and less spiritual and he
[1:18:34] laughed and I'm believing them but he
[1:18:36] joined the Methodists I think of church
[1:18:40] I know in another church I said what
[1:18:43] when I was back there a young man and
[1:18:46] reading all these things and hearing but
[1:18:48] all these things why the world I said
[1:18:51] woody Lee Pentecost and
[1:18:53] and join this church or that church
[1:18:54] surely recognizes that the Pentecostal
[1:18:57] revival I suppose was the endtime
[1:19:00] revival for the vow to see interchange
[1:19:02] amen
[1:19:04] but the brave revival er for those that
[1:19:06] God calls out in Revelation 3:21 and if
[1:19:10] the old I stand in the door and knock
[1:19:11] amen and he wants to fellowship with
[1:19:14] them that's the bride he wants really do
[1:19:16] wonders with you that's the bride a man
[1:19:19] and it's called out of the churches by
[1:19:22] the grace of Almighty God amen god help
[1:19:25] us rather to recognize the word the
[1:19:28] message neither neither cupcake put
[1:19:30] emphasis on William Branham we don't
[1:19:32] bread and winter brown he wouldn't want
[1:19:34] that a man that by any means would he
[1:19:36] would he would allow if he were alive
[1:19:38] today a man he was alive today as I said
[1:19:42] he'd be pushing to get to believers and
[1:19:44] tell believers to line up with the word
[1:19:45] tell believers to be on their toes a man
[1:19:48] as he as he was doing right here the
[1:19:50] message how can I overcome a man he was
[1:19:52] laying it out laid it out later
[1:19:54] according to the word what God required
[1:19:57] all believers to the overcomers amen
[1:20:01] while God was looking for in the
[1:20:03] believers that was an overcomer my god
[1:20:05] Widow before in the sisters regard with
[1:20:07] everywhere in the brothers amen the very
[1:20:09] spiritual minded not religious spiritual
[1:20:12] but the thing of it is brother that they
[1:20:14] were getting more religious and less
[1:20:16] spiritual a man and again as I say this
[1:20:19] is what he preached I can't overcome is
[1:20:22] ministering this to believers is
[1:20:24] ministry this tube there are other
[1:20:27] messages that he preached to the bride
[1:20:30] in this last age brother again we could
[1:20:33] go back to the you know to the 50s and
[1:20:35] that's fine and go back to the 1940s my
[1:20:38] messages said that he preached and we
[1:20:41] can listen to it or we can read it a man
[1:20:43] but what what is the message now for the
[1:20:46] bride amen as I said the prophet of God
[1:20:49] went and he preached other messages
[1:20:50] because he felt that the bride needed it
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:55] and in concerning you know not just how
[1:20:58] can I overcome but I'll get I'll get the
[1:21:01] list of those messages eventually
[1:21:03] amen to let you
[1:21:06] so it was it was God may he called the
[1:21:09] bride arrow now he was getting the bride
[1:21:12] to line up with a word and I was getting
[1:21:13] the brighter in her new wonders with the
[1:21:15] word know he was getting the bride to
[1:21:17] recognize the break room and Adrienne
[1:21:20] and visual union of the heavenly
[1:21:22] bridegroom and the earthly bride amen

[1:21:59] Jesus amen amen

[1:22:03] honor amen by the grace of God for mates
[1:22:07] let's make sure that we are we have
[1:22:08] repented as we are two of our scene of
[1:22:11] our selfishness of our own ways and our
[1:22:13] own ideas lord I forgive me I want your
[1:22:17] I want your anointing I want your ways

[1:22:36] portion of that life in me
[1:22:37] amen the bathroom of the Holy Ghost in
[1:22:40] me by the grace of God amen what is that
[1:22:43] that's the resurrection amen that's the
[1:22:46] resurrection that's the rapture praise
[1:22:49] the name of the Lord and we repeated it
[1:22:51] a number of times
[1:22:52] amen sure but again not now that there
[1:22:55] are those that profess it but they
[1:22:57] haven't experienced it
[1:22:58] amen do you have there do you have other
[1:23:01] experience of the Resurrection in your
[1:23:03] soul do you have the experience of the
[1:23:05] rapture in your soul amen
[1:23:07] not all guys that experience they they
[1:23:11] but they have the doctrine but they
[1:23:12] don't have the experience oh I believe
[1:23:14] in the resurrection you do why what the
[1:23:18] Bible says this
[1:23:21] well you got to have a personal
[1:23:23] experience a personal testimony hey
[1:23:26] you've been in the resurrection why
[1:23:28] because I'm resurrected you want yeah I
[1:23:31] was a sinner I was dead in sins and
[1:23:33] trespasses
[1:23:34] but Alleluia when I am and I heard the
[1:23:36] Word of God and I repented and I asked
[1:23:38] God to forgive me and help me brother he
[1:23:40] came on the scene and he helped me he
[1:23:42] came on the scene and he gave me a part
[1:23:46] of his resurrection and rapture a minute
[1:23:49] he was resurrected he was raptured and
[1:23:51] he come back to share with us a man with
[1:23:54] the Gentile bride and eventually with
[1:23:56] Israel praise the name of the Lord
[1:23:58] brother this is tremendous a man so
[1:24:02] again as I said I said I believe that
[1:24:04] our service said that God has brought us
[1:24:05] beyond just a prophet he got us into the
[1:24:08] message amen
[1:24:10] and there are other message that he
[1:24:11] preached after the old me of the seven
[1:24:13] seals and he said to the in a certain
[1:24:16] message there now he said this is
[1:24:18] another revelation of the seals a man
[1:24:21] any priesthood after the seals maybe a
[1:24:24] year maybe a few months maybe three
[1:24:27] years after the sealed before God took
[1:24:29] him home hey man but he lady of this he
[1:24:32] laid in there into a port to get us to
[1:24:35] mature in the Word of God amen amen the
[1:24:38] only other seals is to reveal the
[1:24:40] mystery of God calling out of a Gentile
[1:24:42] bury a man he got he got the Jews there
[1:24:45] but he also got a Gentile bride a man
[1:24:48] and again and the Father God has brought
[1:24:51] out in this message right here and he
[1:24:52] said to remember he see there's there's
[1:24:54] a calling out and there's the elect when
[1:24:57] the conmen it comes to the Jews and the
[1:24:59] Gentiles and they're not all they are
[1:25:02] called out are elected then all that I
[1:25:04] called out are going to be part of the
[1:25:05] New Jerusalem a man but there there's
[1:25:09] elected and predestinated juice and
[1:25:12] Israelites that are a part of the New
[1:25:14] Jerusalem and he said of course he said
[1:25:16] there is a Gentile bride that is part of
[1:25:19] the New Jerusalem by the grace of God a
[1:25:22] man and then when I had gone through
[1:25:25] this message before but that apparently
[1:25:27] didn't didn't strike me for a long time
[1:25:29] until I was going through it just
[1:25:30] recently here
[1:25:32] as I've been ministry on it and the
[1:25:34] private of God brought out concerning
[1:25:35] again the call in the elect of the Jews
[1:25:38] and the call of the elect of the
[1:25:40] Gentiles a man and any any highlights
[1:25:43] again the New Jerusalem and he should
[1:25:45] look he said what it says right here
[1:25:46] concerning the New Jerusalem he said
[1:25:48] that's the Gentiles not gender that's
[1:25:50] the Jews he said right there and he said
[1:25:53] right here it is the Gentiles
[1:25:56] amen praise the name of the Lord so
[1:25:59] brother God Elvis who recognized God's
[1:26:01] plan purpose and pattern and I'll be the
[1:26:04] recognized God what he does and how he
[1:26:06] does it amen and again don't forget if
[1:26:10] you're going to get it as you ought to
[1:26:12] get it it is God hidden and it is God
[1:26:15] revealed in simplicity amen God is
[1:26:19] hidden in revealing simplicity so that
[1:26:21] only the elect are going to catch it
[1:26:23] amen only the true seat of God are going
[1:26:26] to recognize it Amen and move on with
[1:26:28] him
[1:26:28] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:26:31] praise the Lord he sends the Holy Ghost
[1:26:33] to them I pray the father sent you
[1:26:35] another comforter and he saw not leave
[1:26:37] you comfortless I will come to you and
[1:26:39] in that day said you'll know that I mean
[1:26:41] the father the father me ie you you and
[1:26:43] me brother water oneness brother one
[1:26:46] thing to believe in the oneness of Jesus
[1:26:48] with the Father the Son and the father
[1:26:50] whatever the wonders of the children the
[1:26:53] sons and the daughters with their with
[1:26:55] Jesus and with the father a man that I
[1:26:58] am one with him hallelujah praise the
[1:27:00] name of the Lord or ever he was God so
[1:27:03] my praise and Aaron area I really well
[1:27:07] you got to have that revelation because
[1:27:09] he said God gives birth to gods Amen
[1:27:13] that's what we've been reminded of that
[1:27:15] so as no we're not when our church
[1:27:17] members when I denominational sons and
[1:27:19] daughters we are the sons and daughters
[1:27:21] of God
[1:27:22] we've been burdened again by the Word of
[1:27:23] God amen and we got the Holy Ghost that
[1:27:26] puts us into oneness with our Father
[1:27:28] amen amen amen
[1:27:31] brother says hallelujah we need that we
[1:27:35] certainly need the Holy Ghost mother in
[1:27:39] and well they needed we needed at every
[1:27:42] hour every age but how much do we need
[1:27:44] it
[1:27:44] sour for the resurrection how much we
[1:27:47] needed in this hour for the rapture and
[1:27:49] brother to be part of the resurrection
[1:27:51] part of the rapture there has to be a
[1:27:53] total separation amen
[1:27:56] total separation of unbelief and you're
[1:27:58] going to give preeminence to the faith
[1:28:00] by the grace of our God God was bringing
[1:28:03] to bringing our Lord Jesus Christ weight
[1:28:06] to that to that position of absolute
[1:28:08] separation amen so even his disciples
[1:28:12] were separated from him well he had to
[1:28:15] rebuke Peter and when he was betrayed of
[1:28:19] that they walked away
[1:28:20] Oh Peter we'll follow them yeah well why
[1:28:26] why that description be fulfilled that
[1:28:29] what Jesus said would be fulfilled jesus
[1:28:31] said Peter you're going to deny me three
[1:28:32] times
[1:28:33] yeah also I want the oh yes he said yes
[1:28:37] you will
[1:28:38] Peter but he was the only one all the
[1:28:42] rest went away all the res went
[1:28:43] somewhere else because they they didn't
[1:28:46] they didn't want to identify with Jesus
[1:28:47] or to recognize this or recognize them
[1:28:50] toward torturing him and doing doing
[1:28:52] these things hey man but oh they're
[1:28:54] right at Calvary amen but when Jesus was
[1:28:58] in to get cemani they were they slept as
[1:29:01] I said they slept naturally now
[1:29:03] believers are sleeping spiritually oh
[1:29:05] yeah not really into the word one time
[1:29:10] when Jesus was right there with his
[1:29:11] signs and wonders and everything they
[1:29:13] were really into it what Jesus was
[1:29:14] saying because their signs and wonders
[1:29:16] oh and they were glorified and so on
[1:29:18] because they went forth Jesus a goal
[1:29:21] heal the sick raise up this raise up
[1:29:23] that raised the dead they gave them
[1:29:25] power even Lucifer even a Judas Amen to
[1:29:30] do this to do that but here it is at the
[1:29:34] end and they're not supporting him
[1:29:35] Dursley it's amazing now people are so
[1:29:40] subject to the natural being and give
[1:29:44] premature than that and to the natural
[1:29:45] but not to the spiritual brother you
[1:29:49] need when the enemy comes in and tells
[1:29:50] you this oh you're tired get thee behind
[1:29:52] me Satan God's gonna give me the Holy
[1:29:55] Ghost you'll take it away yeah that'll
[1:29:57] get me the end
[1:29:58] need a man praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:02] old brother sister is not a generation
[1:30:05] they are very fair very few in this
[1:30:08] generation in this age that would have
[1:30:11] stood the revival fifty years ago he may
[1:30:17] have very food they would have stood the
[1:30:19] revival hundred years ago
[1:30:20] even fewer amen because way we gave our
[1:30:25] hearts to the Lord our life to the Lord
[1:30:26] we're living for the Lord and so I told
[1:30:28] our brother Billy Paul when I met I met
[1:30:30] him in Jeffersonville at the voice of
[1:30:32] God there and he greeted me and he's a
[1:30:34] little brother and glad he said yeah you
[1:30:35] made it he said glad you made it brother
[1:30:37] and thank you for what you've done and
[1:30:40] what you're doing for the Lord I said
[1:30:42] brother I we live for the Lord and I
[1:30:45] said all down through the years even
[1:30:46] when I way we were younger I said we
[1:30:48] live for Jesus I said when we took
[1:30:51] holidays I said we didn't we didn't look
[1:30:53] for a holidays I said just so we could
[1:30:54] have a rest on a break no I said we look
[1:30:57] for holidays to fellowship I said we
[1:30:59] went and traveled here travel there and
[1:31:01] felt sure with this brother and sister
[1:31:03] tell us with that brothers sister
[1:31:04] anybody praise the name of the Lord we
[1:31:07] were looking forward to going to gamble
[1:31:09] I felt assured brother sister Barnes and
[1:31:11] the Saints that were that were there go
[1:31:14] on to vishal falls go i go on even
[1:31:16] beyond that ain't man to Hampton amen
[1:31:19] why fellowship fellowship fellowship
[1:31:22] amen and well that was so much that was
[1:31:25] good that was a blessing amen
[1:31:28] because there was more and more of the
[1:31:29] anointing present then but now it's less
[1:31:32] of the poppy anointing that's right
[1:31:35] and that's why it feels in that world we
[1:31:37] live in feels so empty spiritually
[1:31:39] everybody it's empty brother sister
[1:31:44] because I feel that enthusiasm is not
[1:31:47] there like it used to be it's not there
[1:31:50] like like it used to be when when God
[1:31:53] first sent the Prophet is not there like
[1:31:55] it used to be in the opening of the word
[1:31:56] the seven seals amen
[1:31:58] because this is shortly after the only
[1:32:01] the word and the Prophet began to
[1:32:02] recognize a lot and I know their spirit
[1:32:04] was taking over amen
[1:32:06] why God it is ministry I come to a
[1:32:10] climax
[1:32:11] amen the third bottle they'll be the
[1:32:15] word and the people after that begin to
[1:32:17] draw back why because in 1962 the angel
[1:32:20] told him to stop using those signs and
[1:32:22] wonders start looking looking for God to
[1:32:25] do this God to do that now it's called
[1:32:28] looking for you to do this do this do
[1:32:29] this a man God did know to call it the
[1:32:33] brine
[1:32:34] God did that to get our attention God
[1:32:36] did that to reveal to us the mystery of
[1:32:38] God amen
[1:32:40] the mystery of God God's plan God's
[1:32:43] purpose cause pattern so that we would
[1:32:45] recognize where we are who we are in
[1:32:47] this hour amen the Lutheran's recognize
[1:32:50] them that in that age and the other ages
[1:32:52] and so on and the Pentecostals recognize
[1:32:54] it well this is God in this hour amen
[1:32:56] but now that's gone where we now what
[1:33:00] what revival are we in now we're
[1:33:03] certainly not in a lunar of the room the
[1:33:04] Lutheran revival we're not in a
[1:33:06] Pentecost revival we're not in another's
[1:33:08] rate I know amen we're not in the
[1:33:10] old-fashioned salvation everybody though
[1:33:12] amen
[1:33:13] so where everyone are we in the brave
[1:33:15] revival and everybody what is a reviving
[1:33:19] it's a stirring up a man they giving us
[1:33:22] hunger thirst enthusiasm zeal amen
[1:33:26] everybody's got a guy got that a man
[1:33:29] based on this revelation that Martin
[1:33:32] Luther had he was he was he has real
[1:33:35] enthusiasm all mine he was really built
[1:33:38] on even screaming it out and preaching
[1:33:40] it that the just shall live by faith
[1:33:42] and so on and that we are justified by
[1:33:45] faith according to our faith and I'm
[1:33:47] gonna get in in in in eventually what
[1:33:50] happened after Luther went off to see
[1:33:52] and he wasn't there is real is real win
[1:33:55] with him his enthusiasm went with him
[1:33:57] and they were very very few a man that
[1:34:00] moved on to another age with that
[1:34:02] Zealand that enthusiasm and went on and
[1:34:04] picked up with a Wesley went on and
[1:34:06] picked up the old fashioned army when I
[1:34:08] picked up there there the old fashioned
[1:34:10] Pentecostals amen
[1:34:12] so brother a guy got less and less and
[1:34:14] less so I I a witness the same around
[1:34:17] the message amen that feeling that a
[1:34:20] true Gemini there like it used today
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:24] they're bigger they're more religious
[1:34:25] and they are less spiritual amen because
[1:34:29] again that's why there's going so few
[1:34:31] that are going in the resurrection and
[1:34:33] the rapture so few that are hungry no
[1:34:36] thirsting for their for the resurrection
[1:34:38] for the rapture there are so few that
[1:34:40] are merican but that are not cut off
[1:34:44] with this world so they're not cut up
[1:34:47] with the things of this world what's
[1:34:49] going on in this world anybody but I
[1:34:51] tell you the brine got no got nothing to
[1:34:54] do with this world the bride doesn't
[1:34:56] want to brides discontent was be content
[1:34:58] with such things as G I know people want
[1:35:02] God to make them bigger
[1:35:04] not physically they were rather comical
[1:35:07] smaller but when it comes to financially
[1:35:10] mentally emotionally oh I'm all right
[1:35:15] and you know I believe this and I
[1:35:17] believe that yeah what's the life your
[1:35:20] life reflecting it amen brother sister
[1:35:24] is more more than just religion it's
[1:35:27] more than saying I will obey was a
[1:35:28] prophet and more than saying I will I
[1:35:30] believe you the mystery of God is
[1:35:32] revealed amen no it's God coming down
[1:35:35] and revealing the mystery in you and
[1:35:37] through you it one thing for the Prophet
[1:35:40] to speak another thing for that word to
[1:35:42] become flesh in you amen
[1:35:45] for God to bring this to pass on that to
[1:35:47] bears to God to make us overcomers amen
[1:35:51] not just over coming to the religion or
[1:35:54] denomination but overcoming to religious
[1:35:56] spirits overcoming you just to be caught
[1:35:58] up with the mechanics of the word not
[1:36:01] the dynamics and this is this again
[1:36:04] another reason of that way the prophet
[1:36:07] of God preached how can I overcome it's
[1:36:09] because he was seeing less and less of
[1:36:11] the dynamics and more and more of the
[1:36:13] mechanics yeah they had the word any-any
[1:36:17] in the message why Christ me that's what
[1:36:20] he emphasizes mechanics versus dynamics
[1:36:22] and he said listen ISA we're going to
[1:36:24] take a double portion of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:25] to get us off the earth and he said
[1:36:28] there's too much emphasis on the
[1:36:29] mechanics and not enough on the dynamics
[1:36:30] amen brother amen you got to have any
[1:36:34] God I know the dynamics of that
[1:36:37] person that the powder God mentioned my
[1:36:40] Christ make any and he should a said
[1:36:43] when that hour comes for the rapture he
[1:36:45] says only take a boy or a girl or a man
[1:36:47] or a woman or a brother sister has a
[1:36:48] word he said to lift up there and say
[1:36:50] Lord I'm coming home and he said it'll
[1:36:52] trigger the rapture amen
[1:36:55] not say Lord what do you say no Lord

[2:04:11] Brown said this was the closest painting
[2:04:14] that he saw that was like Jesus and he
[2:04:19] was just looking at the face of Jesus
[2:04:21] and know that one brother round saw him
[2:04:23] he never had on that colored clothes I

[2:04:31] and he had the vision and then he said
[2:04:33] he ended up going up to Chicago I
[2:04:35] believe it was and he said I went into
[2:04:37] her brother's church or home and and he
[2:04:40] said he had a picture there othman said
[2:04:42] of Christ and he said I noticed it he
[2:04:44] said that was the closest he said to
[2:04:47] that look like Jesus

[2:04:52] closest I've seen and he said he's never
[2:04:55] never been without one sense yeah he he
[2:05:01] he had in his house yet it wherever he
[2:05:03] went he had he had the picture of
[2:05:05] Hoffman's head of Christ that he saw in

[2:07:21] new creature not the old one you're not

[2:07:33] whole world and lose himself or be cast
[2:07:36] away for whoever shall be ashamed of me
[2:07:40] and of my words of him shall the Son of
[2:07:45] Man be ashamed when he shall come in his
[2:07:48] own glory and in his father's and of the
[2:07:52] Holy Angels we have witnessed it but I
[2:07:56] tell you of a truth there be some
[2:07:58] standing here which shall not taste of
[2:08:00] death till you see the kingdom of God
[2:08:03] praise the Lord and it came to pass
[2:08:08] about an eight days after those these
[2:08:10] Saints he took Peter and John and James
[2:08:13] and went up into a mountain to pray amen
[2:08:17] and as he prayed the fashion of his
[2:08:23] countenance was altered and his raiment
[2:08:26] was white and glittering amen and Bo
[2:08:30] there talked with him two men which were
[2:08:33] Moses and Elijah Elijah who appeared in
[2:08:38] glory and speak of his decease which he
[2:08:40] should accomplish at Jerusalem amen
[2:08:43] brother here Moses and Elijah they knew
[2:08:47] it
[2:08:48] where were they where were they
[2:08:55] as I know there's certain Christians are
[2:08:56] there they don't believe in and that
[2:08:58] other dimension they don't believe in
[2:09:00] theosophy bodies you believe when you're
[2:09:02] dying you're dead and you're in the
[2:09:05] graveyard they believe that you know
[2:09:08] what you know what Scripture they base
[2:09:09] that on it's in the Old Testament - one
[2:09:14] verse part of our verses sister did know
[2:09:18] not anything and I've told those peeps
[2:09:24] some of those people that believe that
[2:09:25] certain church there don't look they
[2:09:28] don't believe in going from here to
[2:09:29] another dimension
[2:09:30] no they believe you got to go from here
[2:09:33] to the graveyard no I said the dead know
[2:09:37] not anything I said about this world but
[2:09:41] I said they do know a lot about the
[2:09:43] world to come I said where did Moses and
[2:09:45] Elijah come from I said when Jesus met
[2:09:48] and on the mound Transfiguration I said
[2:09:50] where did this one come from that one
[2:09:51] come from so on that Jesus met so on he
[2:09:55] saw this he saw that they still don't
[2:09:58] believe they want to believe that verse
[2:10:02] the founder of that denomination taught
[2:10:06] taught those things
[2:10:08] my brother didn't she didn't bring it
[2:10:10] into in to compare it to the New
[2:10:13] Testament revelation that if this
[2:10:16] Tabernacle be dissolved we got one
[2:10:19] already waiting eternal in the heavens
[2:10:24] amen and Paul was long easy to cast down
[2:10:27] this one and to pick up the glorified
[2:10:29] one he said I want to cast it down you
[2:10:33] know he's sitting nor play grace of God
[2:10:36] amen so brother Jesus met Paul and and
[2:10:43] Elijah
[2:10:48] bear with me I love you brother
[2:11:01] - the promise there of that body the
[2:11:08] disturber neck will be dissolved for we
[2:11:12] know that if our earthly outs of this
[2:11:15] Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[2:11:18] building of God and house not made with
[2:11:20] hands eternal in the heavens for in this
[2:11:24] we groan earnestly desiring to be
[2:11:28] clothed upon with our house which is
[2:11:31] from heaven amen for we that are in this
[2:11:35] tabernacle to grow me burden not that we
[2:11:38] should be unclothed but clothed upon
[2:11:40] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[2:11:43] life
[2:11:44] amen amen and he said he that wrought us
[2:11:49] for the South same thing is God who also
[2:11:51] has given unto us the earnest of the
[2:11:53] Spirit therefore we are always confident
[2:11:56] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[2:11:58] the body we are absent from the Lord we
[2:12:03] walk by faith not by sight and we are
[2:12:06] confident I say and willing rather to be
[2:12:08] absent from the body and to be present
[2:12:10] with the Lord now brother this scripture
[2:12:13] let us say at the Lord and yet they
[2:12:16] won't believe it yeah brother that's the
[2:12:20] grace of God in your life and in mine
[2:12:22] amen that is the testimony of an
[2:12:26] overcomer
[2:12:26] Paul had overcome the world the flesh
[2:12:29] the devil that verse of scripture was in
[2:12:31] 2nd Corinthians 5 chapter 5 but we're
[2:12:35] we've overcome by the grace of our Lord
[2:12:38] Jesus Christ I won't be able to get
[2:12:40] again into the message we'll see amen we
[2:12:47] need to continue on overcoming because
[2:12:53] there's less and less that are that are
[2:12:54] overcoming less and less that have
[2:12:57] overcome
[2:13:00] come the world overcome the flesh and
[2:13:02] overcome the devil so brother sister
[2:13:05] grace of God to us and God is testing us
[2:13:12] God's testing us yeah I'll just give you
[2:13:16] a couple of quotes here and I may have
[2:13:18] already give it to you but we can we can
[2:13:21] hear it again to 2nd 3rd 4th 5th Kwan's
[2:13:24] repeated amen
[2:13:26] because faith comes by hearing the word
[2:13:30] the prophet of God said he that cometh
[2:13:33] to God must first be tested amen
[2:13:40] tested what he said tested with the word
[2:13:44] he said that's God's test do you believe
[2:13:48] it he that cometh to God must be tested
[2:13:50] and the only you know that only shows a
[2:13:53] true child and he said when the when the
[2:13:57] test comes on you can't overcome less
[2:14:00] there's a test give you you've got to
[2:14:04] have a test to overcome oh yeah and you
[2:14:09] pass the test you're an overcomer
[2:14:11] hallelujah and when a test is given it's
[2:14:17] to see whether you can overcome or not
[2:14:19] jesus said to him that overcometh the
[2:14:22] test is the greatest thing that ever
[2:14:25] happened to you to test to see if you're
[2:14:31] going to overcome to him that overcometh
[2:14:33] he would give us life eternal
[2:14:38] and he said our trials are worth more to
[2:14:40] us than precious gold it's a testing
[2:14:44] time and one good evidence to us that
[2:14:47] God is with us when we are tested for
[2:14:50] all children of God are tested and tried
[2:14:52] and he gives us the example of Daniel in
[2:14:57] Babylon and he said Daniel wasn't afraid
[2:15:00] of the spies when the law went forth
[2:15:03] that he weren't allowed to pray only to
[2:15:07] the Babylonian king our God the king but
[2:15:15] Daniel prayed unto the Lord and he would
[2:15:20] kneel and he would face Jerusalem and
[2:15:24] pray didn't matter to him when the spies
[2:15:29] came and took them before the king and
[2:15:31] they sentenced him to go into the the
[2:15:34] lion's den yeah he said David Daniel
[2:15:41] wouldn't compromise but I tell you
[2:15:43] there's a lot of people would compromise
[2:15:45] today rather than rather than go to the
[2:15:48] test that God wants to test them with
[2:15:49] the things that God wants to test you
[2:15:51] with he's testing sometimes his God
[2:15:53] testing you he allowed this to happen
[2:15:57] the staff and that to happen and it's a
[2:15:59] test personal test is between you and
[2:16:01] God see if you see if you really really
[2:16:06] want to be a holy ghost overcomer
[2:16:11] there's a problem was I wasn't saying
[2:16:13] the prophet of God was seen that there
[2:16:15] were those in random time Necker that
[2:16:16] were not overcomers Satan was overcoming
[2:16:20] them with these thoughts amen
[2:16:25] not to get him to deny what the the
[2:16:27] doctrines but get him to be more like
[2:16:32] the world and when he the way they act
[2:16:34] the way they dress and so on and their
[2:16:37] hairstyles yeah I see prophet
[2:16:42] I was recognizing it here in 1963
[2:16:45] oh my don't think because you got along
[2:16:51] here I'm alright
[2:16:54] no it's like a father God said you
[2:16:58] couldn't you could have you could go and
[2:16:59] be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[2:17:01] Christ and be a dead work it is not real
[2:17:04] old egos fate and you can you can a
[2:17:07] sister can I belong here but again if
[2:17:10] you're not going to do it right then the
[2:17:14] way you go one way God wants you to have
[2:17:16] it
[2:17:16] you're going to pattern after the world
[2:17:18] but people who were all yeah they like
[2:17:20] this they like that brother you're going
[2:17:25] to do it for the Lord they like it but
[2:17:29] don't pattern after then and right and
[2:17:32] he saw this from downtown tonight and
[2:17:35] then we thank the Lord that such a bet
[2:17:37] he was a witness the other day she just

[2:18:52] Lord not man
[2:18:55] we love him lovest thou me more than
[2:18:59] these amen and he talked about Daniel
[2:19:04] and he said Daniel was the Prophet that
[2:19:10] was the size of the church in that last
[2:19:12] day the bride there's lots of church
[2:19:17] about two million and they went down
[2:19:19] there but there was the size of the
[2:19:21] overcomers Daniel was one out of all the
[2:19:23] other Jews and the three Hebrew children
[2:19:28] was three out of all the other Jews
[2:19:30] whereas all the others got down and
[2:19:32] worship the God that they part they had
[2:19:33] there but they wouldn't worship but
[2:19:35] these three Hebrews they wouldn't
[2:19:38] worship Him no no
[2:19:41] so they true that they threw them into
[2:19:44] the into the fire furnace the fire yeah
[2:19:47] and he did it seven times hotter
[2:19:52] did they we can't say oh no will will
[2:19:56] will go worship your God over it no
[2:19:57] we're not gonna do it and they get they
[2:20:00] gave them time to make up their mind
[2:20:02] notice and when I couldn't do it casas
[2:20:05] into the fire and and the fire was so
[2:20:08] hot that the ones that cast him in died
[2:20:11] but when they landed and the King looked
[2:20:14] down instead of three there was four
[2:20:18] thank you lord see if you're gonna take
[2:20:21] your stand in your test he's with you if
[2:20:25] you don't take your stand
[2:20:26] he'll move away repentance will bring
[2:20:29] him back
[2:20:31] thank God brother
[2:20:36] set a trap for Daniel and I believe he
[2:20:39] should the probably Daniel knew that but
[2:20:41] he wasn't afraid of them spies why live
[2:20:45] or die
[2:20:46] he had the victory and therefore there
[2:20:48] are so much victory to the law and lions
[2:20:51] couldn't eat it
[2:20:53] Daniel overcame the lions amen he said
[2:21:00] Shadrach Meshach Abednego had so much
[2:21:02] victory unto the lion until the fire
[2:21:05] rather he said couldn't burn them and he
[2:21:08] said you know he said victory is a hard
[2:21:10] thing to burn out a man thank God huh
[2:21:16] lot victory they were over comers can
[2:21:20] you imagine how much of over comers were
[2:21:23] they so that they were standing in the
[2:21:25] fire but the fire never burned them no
[2:21:29] they weren't crying they weren't
[2:21:30] screaming they were just walking around
[2:21:32] and there was and then came this this
[2:21:36] this other being there and that was God
[2:21:39] yeah God came down and walk with him and
[2:21:44] there a fellowship with God in the fire
[2:21:46] now sometimes brother in the test we
[2:21:49] have more fellowship closer fellowship
[2:21:51] with God then we do when everything has
[2:21:53] gone good yeah so God God allows things
[2:21:57] to go not exactly good sometimes but for
[2:22:01] its to test us and to bring us into a
[2:22:03] closer relationship with him Amen that's
[2:22:06] right
[2:22:07] praise the Lord wonderful he says tired
[2:22:11] thing to burn out he said it when it
[2:22:15] comes to being an overcomer and he said
[2:22:21] they had it he said I might mention
[2:22:24] another character in the days of lot
[2:22:26] Jesus referred to there was only three
[2:22:28] that overcame lot and his two daughters
[2:22:31] not even his wife didn't overcome she
[2:22:34] started out but look back he said many
[2:22:39] of us you had left to many of you would
[2:22:42] left these things to take your stand
[2:22:44] after you searched this through the
[2:22:45] scripture find it's right you see
[2:22:49] are you seeing the vindication of
[2:22:51] Almighty God
[2:22:52] so you set out to leave Sodom leave the
[2:22:55] denominations leave the things that bind
[2:22:58] you to accrete and follow Christ by the
[2:23:00] Holy Spirit vindicate himself by the
[2:23:03] written word of God in other words you
[2:23:07] took the Bible instead of the Creed and
[2:23:08] you set out to follow well he said Lot's
[2:23:12] wife did the same thing she set out to
[2:23:15] go with lot follow her husband her
[2:23:17] children her lovin loved ones but it
[2:23:19] wasn't in her heart she still loved the
[2:23:23] world so it's possible that you can make
[2:23:25] a start and still be the world in you
[2:23:29] see she never overcome and even though
[2:23:32] she was well on the road it finally
[2:23:37] overthrew her she had to take that one
[2:23:40] big last long last look and there's
[2:23:44] where she got caught
[2:23:45] don't even look back don't have no
[2:23:48] desires keep going put your mind on
[2:23:51] Calvary keep moving towards Christ but
[2:23:55] she looked back she was she was all
[2:23:57] gonna versity for that a man but but her
[2:24:03] husband locked and our two daughters
[2:24:04] they did they would they would look back
[2:24:06] they they believed absolutely completely
[2:24:09] what the messenger said they took it
[2:24:13] there was the saying the Lord they
[2:24:14] weren't going to look back they kept
[2:24:16] looking ahead and believers not going to
[2:24:19] look back to the world of things of the
[2:24:20] world if you love the world you know the
[2:24:23] world the level of God not in you and
[2:24:24] there's a lot of believers love the
[2:24:26] world and they love the things of the
[2:24:28] world god help us
[2:24:32] he said keep going put your mind on
[2:24:35] Calvary and keep moving towards Christ
[2:24:38] see it is that love affair with with
[2:24:40] Jesus unfortunately not many got that
[2:24:44] baptism a divine law the Holy Ghost is a
[2:24:47] divine law and it says anyone you love
[2:24:50] love the Lord with all your heart and
[2:24:55] then you'll love the body of Christ
[2:24:58] because you love God
[2:25:01] as you love Jesus remember if she
[2:25:05] started out as an overcomer but she
[2:25:07] never did overcome oh she left the
[2:25:10] denomination she did she walked out of
[2:25:12] Sodom with lot but she wanted to go back
[2:25:14] and have her hair cut she had to look
[2:25:17] back again to see what the rest of them
[2:25:20] was doing that's right
[2:25:21] oh did you know I have some good friends
[2:25:23] down there after all that's what she
[2:25:26] thought but he says after all this might
[2:25:31] be just a little new I don't know
[2:25:33] whether it could be right or not I have
[2:25:35] only got this man's word for it though
[2:25:37] he's my husband but yet your pastor is
[2:25:40] your husband spiritually speaking a man
[2:25:45] many say if you are not perfectly
[2:25:47] satisfied you're not perfectly know that
[2:25:50] it's the Word of God then you can't go
[2:25:53] you've got to be really sold out you
[2:25:57] have got to know it not just say well I
[2:25:59] see others doing it I see a sign you
[2:26:03] know Israel started it out they started
[2:26:05] out to millions strong and ended up with
[2:26:07] two men see it wasn't in their heart
[2:26:12] they didn't overcome they just come out
[2:26:15] but they never overcome and they
[2:26:19] perished in the wilderness and are
[2:26:21] eternally dead he said it means eternal
[2:26:25] separation he meant and he goes into
[2:26:30] other examples in the scriptures and the
[2:26:33] Lord willing we're trying to get to some
[2:26:35] of them in another message we'll see
[2:26:39] what the Lord is in mind brother let's
[2:26:43] make our overcoming sure make our
[2:26:48] election sure where else to make sure

[2:27:03] elected I've overcome amen by the grace
[2:27:06] of God they are overcoming the world the
[2:27:08] flesh the devil so but don't think
[2:27:11] you're because you're in this church
[2:27:12] you're overcome
[2:27:13] No is you in Christ and Christ in you
[2:27:17] that's what makes us overcome amen
[2:27:20] it's it's the resurrection and rap for

[2:27:47] him to change his mind on know he said
