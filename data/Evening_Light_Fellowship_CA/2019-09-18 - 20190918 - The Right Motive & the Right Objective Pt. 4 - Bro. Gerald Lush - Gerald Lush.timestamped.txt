[51:16] a man by the grace of God a man just to
[51:21] ask your grace to keep the Saints are
[51:24] the yes with some of them are Saints in
[51:26] prayer in Buuren and as I've given some
[51:31] of you to understand that sister Betty's
[51:34] cousin Jessie Jessie is is not well and
[51:38] really doctors have not given her much
[51:41] time to to live well we told her we're
[51:47] praying for us she said well you can
[51:48] keep praying and she wants us to keep
[51:51] praying for a man but she has lost 100
[51:57] pounds
[51:57] and again as she's sister Betty's aunt
[52:02] aunt betty is her daughter
[52:04] and of course even Jessie has lost her
[52:09] daughter her daughter died when she was
[52:11] in her 40s and also her husband died
[52:14] when he was in his 50s and a number of
[52:16] years ago and Jessie looked after her
[52:21] mother for many many years until Jessie
[52:24] got sick and they had to put her Rena in
[52:26] in a senior zone and she's but she knows
[52:30] that as far as the understanding is that
[52:33] her daughter Jessie is is about to die
[52:37] but she's been brain that she would at
[52:41] least live she saw hope she's still
[52:43] alive she said when I turned
[52:45] 95 years old and she'll be 95 Friday
[52:49] now this writing and she was hoping that
[52:53] she said I hope that she'll she'll be
[52:55] she'll be there so but during the
[52:58] gathering for the birthday I don't think
[53:00] that she'll be able to make it so we
[53:02] pray the grace of God to Jesse and of
[53:05] course that Jesse's brother is also
[53:07] fighting cancer and they've already lost
[53:12] two brothers to cancer and they died
[53:17] again when they're in summing the
[53:18] 40-some in the 50s
[53:20] so most of really aunt Betty's children
[53:23] are gone on before her amen so it's a
[53:26] tremendous test of faith for sure for
[53:30] for our sister and Betty to to endure
[53:34] all these things and to go on trusting
[53:37] the Lord amen because we have been with
[53:40] her and we prayed with her when she was
[53:44] with Jesse in in the apartment they were
[53:47] in there oh yeah we usually go in and
[53:50] visit them and pray with them to
[53:52] encourage them to keep pressing on by
[53:54] the grace of God
[53:55] so keep Aunt Betty and prayer and keep
[53:58] Jessie and prayer because it is serious
[54:01] and of course sir we met it was only a
[54:04] couple of days ago that we met
[54:06] Jesse's sister pearl and her husband
[54:11] oh my remember his name but her husband
[54:15] in in the mall now I we didn't see them
[54:19] but they saw us and he saw us and in and
[54:23] they came over to greet us and so we and
[54:26] she's also sick and a serious sickness -
[54:31] so the grace of God be with her pearl
[54:34] and her husband of course he's easier
[54:36] because he's got together some something
[54:39] put in here to control his heart and
[54:42] he's also got to have implants in his
[54:45] ears so it's amazing but again you know
[54:49] thank God for the grace in your life
[54:51] yeah grace of God because we're not
[54:55] getting younger we're getting older
[54:57] and even to you that are in your 30s and
[54:59] 40s you're getting older a man so he
[55:03] should pray the grace of God to those
[55:06] that are that are above you amen
[55:09] so God be with us is my prayer a man and
[55:12] God be with aunt Betty's family at this
[55:16] time and also we have been informed that
[55:20] sister Betty's brother oldest brother in
[55:24] Grand Bank at this time is not well and
[55:28] so we pray grace to him and that's a
[55:32] Herbert Dunford so the grace of God to
[55:35] Herbert amen so he's he's emotes i guess
[55:39] 78 years old now so God's grace to us
[55:42] all amen but the Bible says threescore
[55:47] years and ten a few more if by reason of
[55:50] strength and they shall be filled with
[55:53] pain and sorrow amen to God be the glory
[55:56] amen
[55:57] in Deuteronomy chapter 4 if we go to the
[56:00] word remember sister Betty and prayer
[56:03] she had problems again of course with
[56:05] the pain in her neck and there and her
[56:07] back in her hips and so on so the grace
[56:09] of God to her amen and pray for because
[56:12] she's got to wait until January for an
[56:15] appointment with specialist so it's
[56:17] another almost another three months amen
[56:21] in Deuteronomy chapter 4 and beginning
[56:25] to read at verse 7 for what nation is
[56:30] there so great who had God so nigh onto
[56:35] them as the Lord our God is in all
[56:39] things that we call upon him for and
[56:42] what nation is there so great that as
[56:46] statutes and judgments so righteous as
[56:50] all this law which I have set before you
[56:54] this day only take heed to thyself a man
[57:01] this understand this received the
[57:05] counsel of the word only take heed to
[57:08] thyself and keep thy soul
[57:11] diligently lest I forget the things
[57:16] which thine eyes have seen unless they
[57:20] depart from thy heart all the days of
[57:24] thy life God deals with us in our hearts
[57:28] God deals with us in revelation in our
[57:32] hearts in experience in our hearts it's
[57:34] the Holy Ghost on the inside of the
[57:37] inside so again as says keep thy soul
[57:43] diligently lest I forget the things
[57:47] which ionize have seen unless they
[57:50] depart from thy heart all the days of
[57:52] thy life but teach them thy sons and thy
[57:56] sons sons especially the day that stood
[58:02] it thou stood us before the lord thy god
[58:05] in Orab when the Lord said unto me
[58:09] gather me the people together and I will
[58:12] make them hear my words that they may
[58:16] learn to fear me
[58:18] all the days that they should live upon
[58:22] the earth a man and that they may teach
[58:26] their children you're responsible to
[58:31] train them in the way that they should
[58:33] go a man now the nature they were born
[58:37] to with well you're training them in
[58:40] another nature a man the right nature
[58:43] and he came near and stood under the
[58:46] mountain and the mountain burned with
[58:48] fire onto the midst of heaven with
[58:52] darkness clouds and thick darkness and
[58:56] the Lord spake unto you out of the midst
[58:59] of the fire and you heard the voice of
[59:03] the words but saw no similar toot only
[59:07] he heard a voice grace that we hear the
[59:11] voice in all that we see grace a we hear
[59:15] the word of God the revelation and he
[59:18] declared unto you is covenant praise the
[59:21] Lord
[59:22] Alleluia which he commanded you
[59:25] perform even ten commandments and he
[59:28] wrote them upon two tables of stone and
[59:31] the lord commanded me at that time to
[59:34] teach you statutes and judgments that ye
[59:37] might do them in the land whether he go
[59:40] over to possess it god bless his words
[59:43] you may be seated
[59:45] amen turn with me to the book of Hebrews
[59:51] chapter 12 Hebrews chapter 12 and
[1:00:07] beginning to read at verse 25 warnings
[1:00:15] and instructions and considering the
[1:00:19] thoughts that we want to put emphasis on
[1:00:22] again tonight and hopefully to bring it
[1:00:24] to a conclusion but as a result of study
[1:00:30] for tonight I discovered that the
[1:00:35] prophet of God put more emphasis on
[1:00:38] motive and objectives than what I
[1:00:40] realize I thought was only maybe a few
[1:00:44] thoughts here and a few thoughts there
[1:00:47] but I discovered that he has put the
[1:00:50] emphasis on motives and objectives right
[1:00:52] motives right objectives spiritual
[1:00:55] motive spiritual objectives hundreds of
[1:00:58] times since 1953 that if you do a
[1:01:03] research on the internet regarding the
[1:01:05] message of the hour you'll find that a
[1:01:07] number of under times that he mentioned
[1:01:09] motive and objective and he brings into
[1:01:13] the emphasis his motives and his
[1:01:15] objectives in doing what he was doing
[1:01:17] his motives and his objectives in his
[1:01:20] ministry his motives and his objectives
[1:01:22] in his relationship with Jesus Christ a
[1:01:25] man and he has put the emphasis on well
[1:01:28] this is my motive this is my objective
[1:01:30] this is why I believe Jesus this is why
[1:01:32] I serve Jesus this is why I do this and
[1:01:35] this is why I do that this is my motive
[1:01:37] and this is my
[1:01:38] objective so what it what is your
[1:01:40] motives and what are what are your
[1:01:42] objectives for being even being here
[1:01:43] tonight a man you're gonna have a right
[1:01:46] motive and you got to have right
[1:01:47] objectives a man according to the Word
[1:01:50] of God according to the will of God it
[1:01:52] is not again it is not my will it is thy
[1:01:55] will a man so Jesus kaitlin's I say
[1:01:58] Jesus came to that in the third pole of
[1:02:00] his ministry not in my will but thine be
[1:02:02] done a man why was it why wouldn't he
[1:02:06] come to that pressure and then that test
[1:02:08] because the grade the greatest trial of
[1:02:11] our faith the greatest manifestation of
[1:02:13] faith would be in the third pole a man
[1:02:16] and as it was with our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:18] so it was with the with the prophets in
[1:02:21] the Old Testament so it is with the with
[1:02:23] the New Testaments messengers and the
[1:02:25] New Testament Saints and the New
[1:02:26] Testament prophets a man but I tell you
[1:02:29] the third pull of our of our experience
[1:02:31] with God is the greatest test of our
[1:02:34] faith a man as it was with Jesus soon as
[1:02:37] what was with the Apostles as it was
[1:02:40] with Jesus who was with the church all
[1:02:42] the way down through the ages as there
[1:02:44] was with Jesus saw was with Martin
[1:02:46] Luther a male it was his motive and
[1:02:49] objective a man that came to the test
[1:02:52] when he took his stand for the
[1:02:54] revelation that God had given him and it
[1:02:56] was nearing the end of his ministry
[1:02:58] brother that they had to take him as a
[1:03:00] were denied him because why because
[1:03:02] there were still those that were
[1:03:04] endeavoring to kill Martin Luther there
[1:03:06] were still those that were endeavoring
[1:03:07] to kill John Wesley a man and again when
[1:03:10] it comes to the Pentecost revival
[1:03:12] because they stayed with their motives
[1:03:14] and their objectives in believing what
[1:03:16] they believe and taking the stand that
[1:03:18] they took a man they are they're just
[1:03:20] they had to take the the the rejection
[1:03:25] of the world a man praise the Lord
[1:03:29] but again they took their stand for the
[1:03:31] truth they took their stand for the word
[1:03:33] even though even though that the world
[1:03:35] began begin to mock them make fun of
[1:03:37] them and to fight the Pentecostal
[1:03:40] revival yet it was a revival that was
[1:03:42] greater than Wesley's revival greater
[1:03:44] than Luther's revival or mine they said
[1:03:47] the Pentecost revival was a worldwide
[1:03:50] revival
[1:03:51] man and brother and God God was pointing
[1:03:54] to an even greater revival which is the
[1:03:56] bride' revival and that also was a
[1:03:58] worldwide revival a man now the
[1:04:01] Pentecost said signs and wonders and the
[1:04:03] Pentecost and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:04:05] but brother the bright revival and the
[1:04:07] Ministry of the Son of Man
[1:04:09] it was the Ministry of our Lord Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ a man not just not just the
[1:04:14] anointing of the Holy Ghost to do this
[1:04:16] and to do that no no it was Christ
[1:04:19] himself coming down to discern the
[1:04:20] thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:04:22] it was Trace himself coming down to call
[1:04:25] out the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ a
[1:04:28] man not just the call of the the
[1:04:30] Methodists or the Lutheran's or the
[1:04:32] Pentecostals but her brother he was
[1:04:34] coming - to the bright it was Brittany
[1:04:37] Alleluia it was Brittany me he was
[1:04:39] calling out his right role what we think
[1:04:41] that was just in this hour just in this
[1:04:43] age no no it was in the pentacle it was
[1:04:46] anything it was in the day of Pentecost
[1:04:47] but that's when that's when again when
[1:04:49] Jesus begin to deal with his bride
[1:04:51] that's when Jesus began to unite with
[1:04:53] his bride in the Pentecostal age the
[1:04:55] first stage brother right on down
[1:04:57] through under finally it come to a
[1:04:59] conclusion a man and Alleluia and the
[1:05:02] bride and the bridegroom became one and
[1:05:04] the right in the right room in turn
[1:05:06] entered into a Alleluia an absolute
[1:05:09] fellowship praise the name of the Lord
[1:05:11] the province the province represented
[1:05:13] God but brother than it came to God
[1:05:15] prophet trace the name of the Lord but
[1:05:18] then all down through they represented
[1:05:20] Jesus in the braid the representative
[1:05:22] Jesus - finally Alleluia
[1:05:24] - finally Christ with may flesh in his
[1:05:26] right a man not just a little here and a
[1:05:30] little there but it was the fullness of
[1:05:32] the Godhead bodily
[1:05:33] in the bride but it was God in the
[1:05:35] promise to embody the fullness of the
[1:05:37] Godhead bodily
[1:05:38] was in the god prophet praise the name
[1:05:40] of the Lord hallelujah as God was doing
[1:05:42] it in India in the Old Testament so God
[1:05:45] was doing this in the New Testament God
[1:05:47] was revealing the Old Covenant God
[1:05:50] revealed the New Covenant
[1:05:51] a man praise the name of the Lord and
[1:05:54] brother and I and we know that there's
[1:05:55] brethren going off with these false
[1:05:57] teachings concerning a third Testament
[1:05:59] no brother
[1:06:00] there's there's no nothing in the Bible
[1:06:02] concerning a third Testament
[1:06:04] man it's the first Testament is the
[1:06:06] second Testament it is the old it is the
[1:06:08] new a man the new the new one is the one
[1:06:11] that concludes and takes us into
[1:06:13] eternity by the grace of God amen so
[1:06:16] this is tremendous god help us to see
[1:06:18] him what he has done and what he did
[1:06:21] anyway and what he's doing a man to see
[1:06:24] brother that what he did in the Old
[1:06:26] Testament and what he what he's doing in
[1:06:28] the New Testament a man going from the
[1:06:30] prophets to the god prophet and going
[1:06:33] from from the the representation of
[1:06:35] Christ in the bride a man in the first
[1:06:37] stage on to finally it is same as the
[1:06:39] fullness of the Godhead bodily in the
[1:06:41] bride a man it was in the black room now
[1:06:44] sin the bride a man is a tremendous
[1:06:47] revelation amen but again we need that
[1:06:50] revelation in order to get us into the
[1:06:52] rain to the faith that we need in this
[1:06:54] age a man the God prophet had to come on
[1:06:57] the scene and God was made flesh in the
[1:07:00] in the in that God prompted why because
[1:07:02] brother he had to do something that the
[1:07:04] other prophets couldn't do he had to lay
[1:07:06] his life down and pick it up again a man
[1:07:09] and now the bride has got to do
[1:07:11] something of the other those in the
[1:07:12] other angels could not do and they do
[1:07:14] Alleluia and that is to bring forth the
[1:07:16] resurrection and the rapture a man then
[1:07:20] I judge not just look good and be a
[1:07:21] witness of this me a witness of the
[1:07:23] resurrection be a witness of the rapture
[1:07:25] and then lay down their lives yeah they
[1:07:27] lay down their lives when they couldn't
[1:07:29] pick it up why because they had the
[1:07:31] weight for that that that part of the
[1:07:33] bride to come they had to wait for the
[1:07:36] FIR for God to able to bring that in to
[1:07:38] a conclusion a man so that the fullness
[1:07:40] of the Godhead bodily would come in the
[1:07:43] bride a man and if the fullness of the
[1:07:46] Godhead bodies of the bride was she's
[1:07:48] got in her was a bridegroom adding in
[1:07:50] and the resurrection and the rapture
[1:07:53] praise the Lord a man God was waiting on
[1:07:56] Jesus now and now could no know Jesus is
[1:07:58] waiting on the bride praise the Lord
[1:08:00] Alleluia why for the resurrection and
[1:08:03] the wraps are all God elbows Lord bird
[1:08:06] brother sister we better we better make
[1:08:07] our are calling an election Shore we
[1:08:10] better make sure that we had the right
[1:08:11] motive for being in the message we have
[1:08:13] the right objective her for believe in
[1:08:15] this message
[1:08:17] jesus said the right motive the right
[1:08:19] objective for doing what he did a man
[1:08:21] Jesus Lee the right motive and right
[1:08:23] objective for eventually a man moving
[1:08:25] from the second pole to the third pole a
[1:08:27] man he knew that there was a change
[1:08:29] coming in his ministry there is a change
[1:08:32] coming in the life that he was living
[1:08:34] there was a change coming in the message
[1:08:36] that he had 2000 years ago yes he did
[1:08:40] because the Bible says that he turned
[1:08:42] and what'd he do he said his face toward
[1:08:45] Jerusalem amen because there he was
[1:08:48] gonna eat was going to be retrained it
[1:08:50] was there he was going to lay his life
[1:08:51] down both praise the Lord he was going
[1:08:54] to pick it up again
[1:08:55] a man praise the Lord now the other
[1:08:58] prophets couldn't do it they laid their
[1:08:59] lives down but they couldn't pick it up
[1:09:01] again they're waiting on him to come
[1:09:03] hallelujah and when he would pick up his
[1:09:05] life he would pick up theirs because
[1:09:08] they would say they would also as the
[1:09:10] Bible says they arose a man came and
[1:09:12] rolled from the dead and they came and
[1:09:14] appeared and went into the city and
[1:09:16] appeared on to our mini and so on
[1:09:17] amen because why because the God
[1:09:20] probably was there a man he did what
[1:09:22] they couldn't do any man and jesus knew
[1:09:25] what he was going to do but he knew the
[1:09:27] place he had the pain he knew what he'd
[1:09:29] had to endure a man he had a motive in
[1:09:32] coming he had an objective in coming he
[1:09:34] had a motive in coming through the womb
[1:09:37] of a woman like myth like Mary a virgin
[1:09:39] to be virgin born hey man and there was
[1:09:41] a motive and there was an objective a
[1:09:43] man and a motive an objective that he
[1:09:45] knew even though even as a young boy a
[1:09:49] man when he was he went into the into
[1:09:52] the synagogue and here he was just just
[1:09:55] a few years old here he was teaching
[1:09:56] teaching in this the elders in the
[1:09:59] synagogue teaching the priesthood a man
[1:10:01] they were amazed at his understanding of
[1:10:04] the word a man and then well of course
[1:10:07] when Mary and Joseph went looking for
[1:10:10] him she she just tried to get him almost
[1:10:13] she didn't mean to say that but that was
[1:10:15] that was human a million and she said
[1:10:18] she's an a they Gino God did your mother
[1:10:20] and your father have been seeking you
[1:10:22] for three days and so on his mother and
[1:10:25] father well who was his mother and
[1:10:27] father and she and
[1:10:29] and he knew that it wasn't Joseph I know
[1:10:31] what they thought concerning the answer
[1:10:34] that he gave but he knew it she wasn't
[1:10:36] his mother and she wasn't he's fun and
[1:10:38] he and Joseph wasn't her father his
[1:10:40] father no no it was God was his father a
[1:10:43] man he was merchants mourn by the grace
[1:10:46] of Almighty God he knew where he come
[1:10:49] from he knew way was here and he knew
[1:10:51] who he was going hey man why wasn't this
[1:10:54] young boy in the temple and he was
[1:10:55] teaching the elders of the temple and
[1:10:57] teaching and teaching the screen to
[1:10:59] describes in the end and the varices and
[1:11:02] so on in the temple a man and they were
[1:11:05] all amazed that he knew the word there
[1:11:08] right there Jesus teaching them hey man
[1:11:12] he knew more about the word they knew a
[1:11:14] man so brothers sisters our saintly in
[1:11:18] this hour that was the braid now it's
[1:11:20] the braid grew it know that was the
[1:11:22] bridegroom now it's the bride amen

[1:19:48] Internet has gone beyond the television
[1:19:50] now and people are more caught up with

[1:19:55] result of the internet and all these
[1:19:57] things they they're dead the message
[1:19:58] today they say it's a witness the world
[1:20:02] has received the witness of Jesus and is
[1:20:05] receiving a greater witness and brother

[1:29:48] prophet oh yeah he said that yeah he
[1:29:53] said always said if your motive was not
[1:29:54] right he said your objectives not right
[1:29:56] he said God doesn't doesn't recognize it
[1:30:02] God doesn't see it God doesn't hear it
[1:30:05] he said God he said ghost by a right
[1:30:08] mode and a right objective amen
[1:30:11] God give Abel the right motive and the
[1:30:14] right objective praise the Lord
[1:30:17] Cain never added he he wouldn't did what
[1:30:21] he did but his motive was right his
[1:30:23] objective wasn't right hey man I traitor
[1:30:26] this okay Cain's Akane's that motive an
[1:30:29] objector was down here but Abel's was
[1:30:31] way up there
[1:30:32] Cain was he was time Abel was eternity

[1:30:42] his soul he wanted Redemption he want to
[1:30:46] get back and fellowship with God glory
[1:30:49] glory glory what is your motive and your
[1:30:52] objective for the resurrection and the
[1:30:55] rapture is it because you love him or is

[1:31:18] love based on love it's the law oh yeah
[1:31:24] when you start because there he loved
[1:31:25] you he loved his seed that's why he did
[1:31:29] what he did it was his sons and his
[1:31:31] daughter study that he redeemed he come
[1:31:33] down to redeem and look what look at her
[1:31:36] oh yeah
[1:31:37] and he I'll do this I'll do this the pub
[1:31:39] as prophet of God said many others have
[1:31:42] said it listen he said God could have
[1:31:43] went when Adam and Eve fell and sinned
[1:31:45] he they could have waked it all off and
[1:31:47] wiped it off and started over again
[1:31:49] because before Adam and Eve as we said
[1:31:55] there was there was another culture and
[1:31:58] that's that's what that's what puzzles
[1:32:01] man today when he study in history and
[1:32:04] he's finding these these these creatures
[1:32:07] out there these animals and all that and
[1:32:09] finding this and they say this was man
[1:32:11] this was man so on yeah but it was a it
[1:32:14] was a it was a culture that God had and
[1:32:16] God created but God destroyed why
[1:32:19] because they all come under Satan's
[1:32:21] influence and you go into the book of
[1:32:23] Revelation it is
[1:32:24] the spirits that are that are in the end
[1:32:26] of waters and they're loosed oh yeah
[1:32:31] so God God destroyed it all because and
[1:32:35] the earth the Bible said in the
[1:32:36] beginning God created the heaven of the
[1:32:38] earth and and waters covered they
[1:32:41] covered the deep yeah but God came down
[1:32:45] her and it started over again and he
[1:32:47] brought in Adam and Eve but this time it
[1:32:51] was the manifestation of his plan amen
[1:32:55] manifestation of his predestinated will

[1:39:24] wonderful word wonderful this and that
[1:39:27] no mind but how many are there - how
[1:39:30] many feel that way for Jesus not many
[1:39:39] too many Jesus is just it's a history
[1:39:42] that he did this and he did thank you
[1:39:44] Laurie
[1:39:45] so I I'm saved now thank you
[1:39:48] so I'll see you know if you really say
[1:39:53] you love him and you want to be with him
[1:39:56] and you want to stay with him for
[1:39:59] eternity and you want to worship Him
[1:40:01] it's like the prophet of God said he
[1:40:03] said I want to introduce you to Jesus
[1:40:05] and he said after I introduce you to
[1:40:07] Jesus he said I want to crawl up to his
[1:40:10] feet and worship you amazing grace you
[1:40:18] talk about a right motive and a right
[1:40:19] objective he said one time brother Brown
[1:40:22] said one time he said listen if he sends
[1:40:23] me to hell he said I'll still love him
[1:40:27] what brothers people today question the
[1:40:32] love of God because Oh God didn't do
[1:40:34] this God didn't give me this God didn't
[1:40:36] give me that old Lord I want this I need
[1:40:38] this and so on
[1:40:38] No he said oh if he sent me to hell I
[1:40:41] love you that's love that is absolutely
[1:40:48] love I minimus got that love for God
[1:40:52] grace so what is our motive and
[1:40:57] objective in our worship
[1:41:03] is it just religion is it emotion is
[1:41:12] it's just feeling or is it the anointing
[1:41:18] in your soul God Elvis
[1:41:27] so brother let's make our worship Shore
[1:41:32] with a right motive and a right
[1:41:34] objective what is your motive and
[1:41:38] objective for listening to the word and
[1:41:43] what is our mode of and objective for
[1:41:46] calling for the resurrection Wester why
[1:41:49] do you want to be resurrected is it
[1:41:54] because you love him so much you just
[1:41:56] can't wait to see him or is he just want
[1:41:59] to be saved
[1:42:01] most people is just I just want I just
[1:42:04] want to be safe thank you Lord for
[1:42:06] salvation yeah but what produced it yeah
[1:42:12] how did he do that why did he do that
[1:42:16] great start so what is our motive and
[1:42:20] objective in calling for the rapture
[1:42:23] just to get out of here yeah yeah but
[1:42:28] that's good do you want to get out well
[1:42:30] why do you want to get out what is your
[1:42:32] motive and objection for wanting to get
[1:42:33] out amen it's because you hate anything
[1:42:39] that's contrary to is righteousness amen
[1:42:44] god help us again I thought there was so
[1:42:49] little that we are else we could say
[1:42:51] regarding motive and objective but
[1:42:55] there's a lot because everything that
[1:42:58] God is looking for since the fall of man
[1:43:00] God's been testing man's motives and
[1:43:03] objectives God is still testing your
[1:43:09] motive and objective Amy you want the
[1:43:13] evidence of the Holy Ghost a right
[1:43:16] motive and a right objective amen
[1:43:19] the motive and the objective that Abel
[1:43:22] had the motive and the ejector that
[1:43:24] Abraham had what is the motive and of
[1:43:27] dear objective that Enoch had well he
[1:43:31] walked with God he walked with God his
[1:43:37] motive was right his objective was right
[1:43:43] yeah there's some serious quotes right
[1:43:48] there
[1:43:49] concerning motive and objective I share
[1:43:54] with you shortly
[1:43:55] amen so brother Noah what was his motive
[1:44:01] what was his objective do we have the
[1:44:04] mode of an objective that they had what
[1:44:08] was the motive that object the objective
[1:44:10] of the three Hebrew children putting
[1:44:17] their lives at risk
[1:44:19] didn't matter to them no there's not
[1:44:23] didn't mate didn't mean a thing to them
[1:44:25] they were they wanted to do it they gave
[1:44:28] the glory to God
[1:44:29] I'll share this they had it they had
[1:44:31] they loved God they had a right
[1:44:35] revelation of God amen
[1:44:38] and the word what about Daniel what was
[1:44:43] his motive his objective he he didn't
[1:44:47] hide when he went to pray he opened the
[1:44:50] drapes he opened the window whatever it
[1:44:52] was there he opened it all up and got
[1:44:54] down and prayed toward Jerusalem because
[1:44:58] God told him when you look to this place
[1:45:00] Psalms 121 you look to this place
[1:45:04] wherever a Jew went no matter where he
[1:45:06] went all he had to do was when he prayed
[1:45:07] he a certain hour he had do it and he
[1:45:10] would turn toward Jerusalem where he
[1:45:13] might have been miles and miles and
[1:45:14] miles away but he went toward Jerusalem
[1:45:18] because why he believed that the pillar
[1:45:21] fire-god was in the Ark of the Covenant
[1:45:24] in the temple in Jerusalem their motive
[1:45:31] was right your objective was right they
[1:45:33] honored God they respected God amen
[1:45:36] they loved the Lord
[1:45:39] ah no wonder Strait is the gate now it's
[1:45:43] the way and few there be that find it
[1:45:45] but most don't have a right motor and a
[1:45:49] right objective God's looking in your
[1:45:51] heart to see your motive and your
[1:45:55] objective and if you got the right
[1:46:00] motive and the right objective e is
[1:46:02] number one in your life he is the most
[1:46:07] important person in your life you will
[1:46:12] you're not going to compromise with
[1:46:14] anyone no no no you gonna put him first
[1:46:24] the prophet of God brings that out right
[1:46:26] here yeah so brother sister he said he
[1:46:38] said e knows the objective and the
[1:46:41] motive that we have in our hearts he
[1:46:50] said you can't do anything too little
[1:46:52] but what Jesus will see it no matter
[1:46:55] where it is what it is
[1:46:57] any little testimony or display of
[1:46:59] loyalty to Jesus he said he knows the
[1:47:02] very thoughts of the heart and the Bible
[1:47:05] said that he knew the sparrows fell into
[1:47:07] the street and we're so glad to know
[1:47:10] that every little thing that we do Jesus
[1:47:13] sees it amen and he said he will reward
[1:47:21] us he knows the objective in the motive
[1:47:25] we have in ours he says you got to
[1:47:29] forsake everything and you've got to
[1:47:32] make your choice now are you ready to
[1:47:35] forsake everything to follow him if God
[1:47:39] goes to putting a thirsty in your heart
[1:47:42] he said you'll forsake everything in the
[1:47:44] world listen to what he says he said I
[1:47:47] walked away from my own father and my
[1:47:50] own mother
[1:47:52] yeah at home he walked away and he said
[1:47:59] I got a wife and three children sitting
[1:48:02] right out here now and if they would
[1:48:05] tell me no more preaching he said I walk
[1:48:08] right away from home yes sir as much as
[1:48:12] I loved them died for them right here
[1:48:15] easily but Christ is all in all but this
[1:48:28] is the world that really they're not
[1:48:36] going to make that sacrifice with
[1:48:37] children no well well I love them
[1:48:43] yeah but love them with the divine love
[1:48:49] not a natural love you mean oh my god I
[1:48:56] pray God give us the love we should have
[1:48:59] for one another give mom and dad the
[1:49:02] Lord they should have for their children
[1:49:04] amen just saying he said I walk away if
[1:49:10] they if they didn't want me to preach I
[1:49:13] walk away oh yeah each
[1:49:21] is my objective Christ is my objective
[1:49:24] and my motive to him is to sacrifice
[1:49:27] everything that I have to follow him and
[1:49:30] whether I'm called a fanatic a divine
[1:49:33] healer a Holy Roller whatever it might
[1:49:35] be I don't care heesu for the things in
[1:49:38] the world I don't I don't believe any
[1:49:40] Christian does and he said we want to
[1:49:42] follow Christ and he said that's my
[1:49:43] objective follow him lift him up and
[1:49:46] that's what we need today is people
[1:49:49] willing to sacrifice people one time
[1:49:54] they follow Jesus like that they never
[1:49:58] allowed anything to come between them
[1:50:00] and Jesus whether it was family or
[1:50:02] friends or neighbors jobs no matter what
[1:50:04] it was they always put Jesus first but
[1:50:09] this is the this is the generation that
[1:50:11] compromises and they feel what God won't
[1:50:13] mind this God won't mind that that's the
[1:50:15] devil getting us to reason it is he said
[1:50:23] we are brethren and he said redeeming
[1:50:26] love has been my theme and shall be till
[1:50:29] I die he said that's right get love in
[1:50:32] your heart and be true and honest and
[1:50:34] have the right kind of a motive and the
[1:50:37] right kind of an objective and God will
[1:50:40] take care of the rest but you've got to
[1:50:43] have the right kind of a motive
[1:50:45] Holy Ghost motive Holy Ghost objective
[1:50:48] and God will take care of the rest if
[1:50:51] your objective is rate and your motives
[1:50:53] are right
[1:50:54] you know he said your objective is right
[1:50:57] and your motive is wrong it won't work
[1:51:02] won't work if you know it is the will of
[1:51:06] God then your motive right and your
[1:51:09] objective right and you must test your
[1:51:12] motive and your objective verse first he
[1:51:16] said find the will of God and then find
[1:51:19] your objective and then test your motive
[1:51:23] and see if your objective is right and
[1:51:25] he said then as Jesus said in mark 11 he
[1:51:30] said if you say to this mountain a man
[1:51:34] said be moved he said don't doubt in
[1:51:37] your heart but as long as you've got a
[1:51:39] doubt in your heart whether it's the
[1:51:41] will of God or your motive or objective
[1:51:43] is wrong
[1:51:44] how is it going to move he said but when
[1:51:48] you know that your motive is right and
[1:51:51] it's the will of God and your objective
[1:51:54] is right
[1:51:55] he said that mountain has got to move
[1:51:58] and it doesn't move because they're most
[1:52:02] their motive is not right their
[1:52:04] objective is not it's maybe a selfish
[1:52:08] reason but not for the glory of God
[1:52:12] it's got to be absolutely for the love
[1:52:14] of God and for the glory of God giving
[1:52:17] him the preeminence amen then the
[1:52:19] mountain will move a man he said now
[1:52:28] it's rough friend very rough I don't
[1:52:31] mean to be that myself but he said I
[1:52:34] hope you understand but today I am
[1:52:37] giving the expression of why I did the
[1:52:39] things that I have done and I want you
[1:52:42] to know that this has been my motive and
[1:52:44] my objective is God's Word my motive is
[1:52:49] to please him yeah no matter what you're
[1:52:53] doing no matter how you do it where are
[1:52:55] you doing when you do it is to please
[1:52:57] God again not my will my and be done no
[1:53:02] what I want to do for your glory amen
[1:53:05] and you're gonna do for his glory it's
[1:53:08] gonna be his will you got to do it do
[1:53:10] his will by the grace of God yeah he
[1:53:15] said my motive is to please him and I
[1:53:17] can't listen to everything and believe
[1:53:19] God's Word neither can I listen to
[1:53:21] everything and please God my motive is
[1:53:24] to know his word and to please God by
[1:53:27] serving him by his word not that I have
[1:53:31] anything against this or that but he
[1:53:36] says to please God not my will is will
[1:53:45] time is running out the Bible said as
[1:53:49] many as I as believed were baptized
[1:53:52] well I pray Heavenly Father that every
[1:53:54] one of us that raised their hands in
[1:53:56] true confession that the Word of God
[1:53:58] that they have read and seeing that they
[1:54:01] have been wrong I never looked at a for
[1:54:04] them he said it's not me for the look
[1:54:06] Lord it's you to look Lord he said you
[1:54:10] know the motive and the objective behind
[1:54:12] the hand that raised up a man as I said
[1:54:17] he emphasized motive an objective many
[1:54:22] many many times over the years he said
[1:54:28] Lord you know the motive and you know
[1:54:29] the objective behind the hand that
[1:54:31] raised up you know if you're gonna raise
[1:54:35] your hand in worship God sees your mold
[1:54:37] of an objective now what caused him to
[1:54:41] do that well he sees the heart so he
[1:54:47] said let them from this very our purpose
[1:54:50] in their heart from this day ends forth
[1:54:53] I'll take the word of God and the voice
[1:54:56] of God and follow it no matter what the
[1:54:59] price is a man I commit them to you Lord
[1:55:03] in the name of Jesus Christ he said you
[1:55:06] must never look at things in the natural
[1:55:08] he's a look at spirit of anything you
[1:55:13] want to look at a city look at a spirit
[1:55:15] of it yeah
[1:55:17] just places that I've drove by or drove
[1:55:20] through and I didn't like the spirit of
[1:55:24] it there's a certain city or town
[1:55:28] Newfoundland that I've gone by many
[1:55:30] times but I know and right from teenage
[1:55:36] years I said Lord there's something
[1:55:39] wrong with this place I said I don't
[1:55:42] like the spirit of this place
[1:55:46] yeah all those years all those years and
[1:55:50] it's and I still feel the same thing
[1:55:52] when I Drive by that place yeah go towns
[1:56:00] other towns Oh something wrong here be
[1:56:09] in prayer yeah because the Bible warns
[1:56:17] us but even though going into a house
[1:56:21] there's there's house you're going to
[1:56:23] end and and they and they the right
[1:56:25] spirit is right and you can stay there
[1:56:27] but it's the spares not right you don't
[1:56:29] stay there the Bible tells you they say
[1:56:34] peace be to this house but it's just if
[1:56:36] they refuse it and then the spirit is
[1:56:39] wrong and opposed to it then you you
[1:56:41] leave it and go out yeah oh yes you
[1:56:48] imagine what the prophets felt what he
[1:56:50] desert when he was in travelling oh yeah
[1:56:55] grace he said you look at a family look
[1:57:01] at the spirits in the family look at a
[1:57:04] man look at the spirits in him see
[1:57:07] anything you look at everything has got
[1:57:10] to have a motive and objective amen yeah
[1:57:15] and the Spirit of God determines the
[1:57:17] motive and the objective you got yeah
[1:57:21] the church was put air for a purpose and
[1:57:24] there is a spirit behind this church
[1:57:27] certainly heesu spirit behind your home
[1:57:30] he said spirit behind every building he
[1:57:33] said behind everything there is a spirit
[1:57:36] there is a motive and an objective and
[1:57:38] if this church comes here to greatly
[1:57:40] exalts um human system each and his
[1:57:42] motive is not right if it's putty or to
[1:57:45] try to achieve something for the kingdom
[1:57:47] of God then the motive and the objective
[1:57:49] both is right but it's got to be for the
[1:57:52] kingdom of God
[1:57:58] as motovan objective was right in
[1:58:00] wanting to bring the profit light of
[1:58:02] this and another sermon he said his
[1:58:04] motive was right in wanting to bring the
[1:58:06] Ark of the Covenant he said back to
[1:58:08] Jerusalem but he said he didn't do it
[1:58:12] God's Way his motive and objective was
[1:58:16] right but he didn't do it God's Way he
[1:58:20] was supposed to consult the Prophet but
[1:58:23] he didn't he consulted man not only that
[1:58:26] he was supposed to put the Ark of the
[1:58:27] Covenant on the on the shoulders of the
[1:58:29] eye of the priesthood but he didn't do
[1:58:31] that he put it on new current God was
[1:58:39] working on David David's spiritual
[1:58:41] motives and objectives in his heart
[1:58:43] concerning doing it right what you do
[1:58:47] you might you might add Oh Lord this is
[1:58:49] what God wants me to do yeah but you got
[1:58:51] to do it the way God wants you to do it
[1:58:55] God wanted David to do that but he had
[1:58:58] to do it the way God wanted him to do it
[1:58:59] he didn't do it and there's things that
[1:59:03] we do sometimes and we do it God wants
[1:59:07] us to do it but we do it our way instead
[1:59:09] of doing the cards way you got to do it
[1:59:13] God's Way grace
