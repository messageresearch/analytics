[36:36] no
[36:38] but those online amen i trust they're
[36:41] awake
[36:42] and out of their beds but we we pray the
[36:45] lord is going to change this situation
[36:47] maybe back to normal for a while
[36:50] but didn't get all of this what's going
[36:51] on it's just a test of our faith
[36:54] that's true god's allowing it oh god's
[36:57] doing that allowing that to out there in
[36:58] the world yeah for them for them for
[37:00] them
[37:00] but yeah but he's looking for something
[37:02] in us too amen whatever he does to bring
[37:05] up what's in them
[37:06] is going to bring out what's in you and
[37:07] me amen they're going not going by faith
[37:10] but
[37:11] we're going by faith by the grace of god
[37:14] and that's some of the thoughts that we
[37:15] want to share with you this
[37:16] this morning in that we just went
[37:18] through a message on perfect faith
[37:20] and our brother jonathan expressed
[37:22] appreciation for it
[37:24] he said it's a message that he felt
[37:25] maybe that we should be hearing
[37:28] every week you know at least once a week
[37:30] we should be hearing this message on
[37:31] perfect faith
[37:32] why because we need to be kept mindful
[37:35] amen of what god is looking for
[37:37] in your heart and in mind amen and not
[37:40] and again perfect faith it's a faith
[37:42] faith that begins a faith that ends
[37:44] it's a faith that's totally absolutely
[37:46] complete amen
[37:48] in all that god's looking for we have
[37:50] that faith
[37:51] amen all that god has done and is doing
[37:54] and will do
[37:55] we have it in our faith praise the lord
[37:57] and we're moving on
[37:58] to follow his leadership so that's the
[38:01] truth
[38:02] brother brother brown highlighted it
[38:03] perfect faith
[38:05] and it's therefore it's there yet for
[38:06] our salvation it's good
[38:08] oh i'm saved you know in my heart and my
[38:10] soul
[38:11] but again we're looking for our
[38:13] salvation in our flesh
[38:15] to be to be redeemed amen a new body
[38:17] like unto his glorious body
[38:20] so brother i trust that we got the faith
[38:22] oh i'm saved
[38:23] yeah good but what's going on in your
[38:25] life what's going on
[38:27] amen is he still working in you with you
[38:30] or are you just going by the faith of
[38:31] what he did
[38:33] but you don't have the faith of what
[38:34] he's doing and maybe we don't have the
[38:36] faith of what he's going to do
[38:37] amen well i tell you the world is not
[38:39] living by that kind of faith
[38:41] no no and a lot of the churches out
[38:43] there
[38:44] it's just the faith of what god has done
[38:46] and if he did it for me he did this he
[38:48] did this
[38:49] what's he doing he did that but what's
[38:51] he doing now
[38:52] amen so there's many that see god in the
[38:55] in the past
[38:56] but not very many are identifying with
[38:59] god
[39:00] in the present tense amen and believing
[39:03] all what he's going to do
[39:04] well yeah there's still others out there
[39:06] that mark that's the faith that jesus
[39:08] brought out in martha amen when he
[39:11] talked about lazarus
[39:12] rising from the dead yeah oh yeah she
[39:14] said he's going to rise in the
[39:15] resurrection up the road
[39:17] jesus said i am the resurrection and the
[39:20] life
[39:20] believeth out of this so he amen he was
[39:23] challenging her faith
[39:25] amen and he's challenging our faith now
[39:27] amen do you believe
[39:29] over well the word the world is getting
[39:30] to a place where it's it's all going
[39:32] down down down it's going
[39:34] it's going to be judged and it's going
[39:35] to be destroyed yeah that's that's right
[39:38] that's good
[39:39] but are we going to be destroyed or are
[39:41] we
[39:42] with our faith in jesus getting ready
[39:44] amen to go from this dimension to
[39:46] another dimension
[39:47] i talked about it i'm thinking about it
[39:48] this last couple of days you're
[39:50] certainly all
[39:51] look up because your redemption draws
[39:53] near and i say yes lord i know
[39:55] we have to look up but i said we got to
[39:57] get out of this dimension
[39:59] and into that one first and we don't
[40:01] have to look up for that dimension
[40:03] amen it's just right here amen this is
[40:05] absolutely amazing
[40:07] so we thank god for that revelation amen
[40:10] so we're going to step out of this
[40:11] at a time and into eternity and then
[40:14] look up
[40:14] because the prophet of god did highlight
[40:17] when it comes to the resurrection and
[40:18] the rapture
[40:19] he lightly highlighted that the dead in
[40:20] crisis can appear to
[40:22] the living saints amen and then he said
[40:24] we're going to be changed instantly
[40:26] into a glorified body and get and go
[40:28] into that dimension with them and
[40:29] fellowship with them
[40:31] and he did say we want to fellowship for
[40:33] just uh
[40:34] well we're into eternity but if you're
[40:36] in time you say was fellowship with a
[40:38] short space
[40:40] and then he said all of a sudden then he
[40:42] said we're in that dimension
[40:43] then we're going to look up and then he
[40:45] says there's jesus
[40:46] amen coming in the clouds and and then
[40:50] and uh oh yes it's jesus
[40:53] because he you know he's with us now in
[40:55] the pillar of fire
[40:56] and so on and we with us in our hearts
[40:58] and our souls
[40:59] amen but in that time oh brother
[41:02] and he gets us into that dimension then
[41:04] he goes up
[41:06] to get the body that he died in the body
[41:09] that he
[41:10] he redeemed us in by grace you go up why
[41:13] because the prophet said the body is
[41:14] is right next to the throne of god as a
[41:17] testimony
[41:18] amen that is were redeemed christ has
[41:21] been paid
[41:22] by the grace of god and now the pillar
[41:25] fire goes back to that body
[41:26] and now he's going to come down and
[41:27] receive us onto himself at the end of
[41:30] the ages
[41:31] so it is a tremendous hour that we are
[41:33] living we are living
[41:34] in the end time praise the lord that's
[41:36] good and we see tremendous things
[41:38] happening
[41:39] in the world but i pray the grace of god
[41:42] that the resurrection of the rapture
[41:44] is more precious to us amen
[41:47] then what's going on out there in the
[41:48] world god help us brother
[41:50] that we're going to focus on what he is

[53:31] believe it that's perfect faith
[53:32] what god gave luther and wesley was
[53:34] perfect faith because
[53:35] it was from the lord and it was what
[53:37] they needed for the hour that they were
[53:39] living in
[53:39] amen they were hungry and thirsting for
[53:42] that
[53:42] amen justification argument thirsting
[53:45] for sanctification
[53:47] amen the pentecostals the baptism of the
[53:49] holy ghost the gifts of the spirit

[53:56] amen morning noon and night amen whether
[53:59] they walked the street
[54:00] whether they were in church where they
[54:02] were in prayer privately or personally
[54:04] amen that's what they were hungry for
[54:06] thirsting for more of the holy ghost
[54:08] amen it was so powerful and such a
[54:11] wonderful experience to
[54:12] to have god in in them and god with them
[54:15] and amen and have access
[54:18] to the gifts of the spirit oh morning
[54:20] noon and night
[54:21] hallelujah they're focusing on the gift
[54:23] of tongues morning new tonight they're
[54:25] focusing on the gifts of healing and
[54:27] salvation redemption
[54:29] amen other things that god was doing in
[54:31] their hearts and their souls
[54:33] but again let's understand god we did
[54:35] what he did in luther to get him ready
[54:37] for
[54:37] wesley he did what he did in wesley to
[54:39] get him ready for the pentecostal
[54:40] revival
[54:41] amen that's the truth amen it's amazing
[54:44] that if we go in and study it and you go
[54:46] in and search out
[54:48] some of the teachings of even william
[54:50] branham or not william brandon by
[54:52] william booth a man of the salvation
[54:55] army amen and now that he was focusing
[54:58] on the pentecostal
[55:00] revival amen why no one and again it
[55:04] proves
[55:05] it proved what the prophet said yeah god
[55:07] he said raised up william booth with red
[55:09] on salvation
[55:10] he said he said because the methodists
[55:12] had organized so quickly
[55:14] amen so willing booth went on without
[55:16] that organization
[55:18] but nearing the end of his ministry amen
[55:21] why
[55:21] praise the lord he brother he had a
[55:24] revelation he must have had some
[55:26] revelation god had
[55:27] god was dealing with him and revealing
[55:29] those things to him he was preaching by
[55:31] wesley preached
[55:32] justin and luther and justification
[55:34] sanctification
[55:35] jesus has done this jesus has done that
[55:38] amen
[55:39] but then also our brother william booth
[55:41] and as i said his wife

[55:47] ghost the gifts of the spirit
[55:49] amen the the revival that god gave
[55:52] on the day of pentecost amen well yeah
[55:55] because i remember even
[55:57] within booth and his wife in some of
[55:59] their preachings and teachings there

[56:04] appointing the the people in that
[56:05] generation
[56:06] to pentecost and they oh yeah they were
[56:09] oh yes
[56:10] these william buddha said oh he said you

[56:18] that was god
[56:19] amen that wasn't man that wasn't
[56:22] lutheran control was in control within

[56:33] now god wanted to do this
[56:35] and brother he put that he put that
[56:37] revelation in the heart of william boo
[56:39] amen and then the real real real
[56:42] old-fashioned salvationists amen
[56:45] and that's what he was pointing to and
[56:46] not long after that of course not long
[56:48] after god took
[56:49] william booth off the scene amen the
[56:51] pentecostal revival came
[56:53] amen brother and and again i thank god

[1:01:53] with the world on what's going on
[1:01:54] there amen and we're going to get more
[1:01:56] and more caught up with the spiritual
[1:01:58] with what god is doing by the grace of
[1:02:01] god

[1:02:24] stay with pentecost let's move on
[1:02:26] amen brother god god oh yeah god's
[1:02:29] looking for justification in me
[1:02:30] sanctification in you

[1:02:34] access to the gifts of the spirit amen
[1:02:36] but now he's looking for resurrection
[1:02:39] and rapturing faith
[1:02:40] is that what we're believing is that
[1:02:42] what we're going to preach on focus on
[1:02:44] amen brother whatever god's doing that's
[1:02:46] what we'll focus on
[1:02:48] by grace amen so the lord bless you
[1:02:52] and turn with me to james chapter 2
[1:02:57] praise the lord
[1:03:01] james chapter 2 and
[1:03:04] let's begin to read at verse 14.
[1:03:11] praise the lord and as i said i want to
[1:03:14] share with you some thoughts
[1:03:16] of the prophet in the message works
[1:03:20] is faith expressed amen
[1:03:24] and i'm reading the scriptures that
[1:03:26] brother random read
[1:03:28] before he got into the message on works
[1:03:30] his faith expressed
[1:03:31] and to understand also that the prophet
[1:03:33] of god as he when he got up behind the
[1:03:35] pulpit the anointing must have struck
[1:03:37] him
[1:03:37] concerning that what god was doing in
[1:03:39] his ministry
[1:03:41] amen what god was doing in the bride and
[1:03:43] this message was preached
[1:03:45] november the 26th 1965
[1:03:48] and that's about three or four weeks
[1:03:50] before god called him home
[1:03:53] amen but he was he was identifying
[1:03:56] with something that god had done in his
[1:03:58] in his his ministry that god had done in
[1:04:00] his life
[1:04:01] and what god had done in others amen
[1:04:04] and then yet there was still a mystery
[1:04:06] because we know that it was
[1:04:08] god was bringing forth the resurrection
[1:04:10] god was bringing forth the rapture
[1:04:12] god was doing this and god was doing
[1:04:13] that amen
[1:04:15] and he talked about having a dream but
[1:04:16] he said again he said i don't dream
[1:04:18] i don't have dreams because he had
[1:04:20] visions but the lord showed him a dream
[1:04:23] amen and brother and he and he basically
[1:04:27] was showing him the revelation of the
[1:04:30] rapture
[1:04:31] the revelation of the resurrection amen
[1:04:34] and brother he was screaming
[1:04:36] in the dream to to warn this one to warn
[1:04:38] that one to one another one
[1:04:40] and this one was lining up and that one
[1:04:41] was going going on and going on
[1:04:44] but then he said he all of a sudden he
[1:04:46] cried he
[1:04:48] called out the name of a certain brother
[1:04:50] amen
[1:04:51] that to do this to do this to do that
[1:04:53] and he
[1:04:54] he never got any response from that
[1:04:57] brother
[1:04:58] and that's one of the concerns that he
[1:05:00] is mentioning
[1:05:01] in the first part of this message here
[1:05:03] is he shares those experiences
[1:05:05] and and he tried to get that brother's
[1:05:08] attention
[1:05:09] but he couldn't do it the brother never
[1:05:11] responded and brother brown was
[1:05:13] wondering what's going on
[1:05:14] you know and so on and uh and he also
[1:05:17] shared
[1:05:17] shared the dream with that brother amen
[1:05:20] and
[1:05:21] i a brother that that most of us all
[1:05:22] know and
[1:05:24] not what i mean is that we know him
[1:05:26] through the message
[1:05:27] we've heard the problem of god mention
[1:05:28] his name a number of times
[1:05:30] a man but in this dream and brothers are
[1:05:33] one of the last experiences that the
[1:05:34] prophet of god had
[1:05:36] before god took him off the scene amen
[1:05:38] but
[1:05:39] as i said that brother did not respond
[1:05:42] to the prophet
[1:05:43] and he couldn't hear him and he i don't
[1:05:44] know if he could see him or not but
[1:05:46] he just trying he was screaming out to
[1:05:48] him to do this to do this to do this
[1:05:51] but no no response and of course that
[1:05:54] brother
[1:05:54] is he's gone on now for quite a number
[1:05:57] of years
[1:05:58] and uh his wife of course is still with
[1:06:01] us
[1:06:02] and she's still working at the voice of
[1:06:04] god
[1:06:05] so but we pray the grace of god that our
[1:06:08] brother that brother brown was looking
[1:06:09] for would rest in
[1:06:10] rest in peace amen that he did that he
[1:06:13] didn't miss it but by grace somewhere
[1:06:15] that
[1:06:16] amen some reason that that he never
[1:06:19] responded to the prophet
[1:06:20] in that dream so god had mercy on us
[1:06:22] brother sister
[1:06:23] listen we ought to take it serious amen
[1:06:26] not nothing that's not emotion it's not
[1:06:29] sensation it's not feeling it is faith
[1:06:31] amen and so again go back and listen to
[1:06:34] the message perfect faith
[1:06:36] and the message works is faith expressed
[1:06:40] amen and again he preached this one in
[1:06:43] november just before the lord took him
[1:06:46] off the earth
[1:06:47] he knew his time was coming because at
[1:06:50] the beginning of 1965
[1:06:52] he was preaching somewhere up in
[1:06:54] northern united states
[1:06:55] and he said here i am and he said i see
[1:06:58] my end coming
[1:06:59] at six at 56 years old amen
[1:07:03] that's what he said praise the lord
[1:07:06] god had a reason amen and again
[1:07:09] let's very rem remember what he said
[1:07:12] that what was in his heart he said i'll
[1:07:15] take it it'll be in my heart when i go
[1:07:18] when he went to his grave and it was
[1:07:19] there's a lot of things he wouldn't tell
[1:07:21] he wouldn't reveal but brother i believe
[1:07:23] that we're seeing a lot of it
[1:07:25] i pray grace that we have spiritual
[1:07:26] revelation amen
[1:07:28] to know what's going on amen spiritual
[1:07:31] revelation
[1:07:33] by the grace of god perfect faith by the
[1:07:36] grace of god
[1:07:37] and again faith is a revelation perfect
[1:07:40] faith is the perfect revelation
[1:07:42] of god in the hour we're living god help
[1:07:44] us
[1:07:45] amen in james chapter 2
[1:07:48] and verse 14
[1:07:53] what doth it prophet my brethren thou a
[1:07:56] man
[1:07:56] say he hath faith and have not
[1:08:00] works amen god help us
[1:08:05] he said can faith save him
[1:08:10] it's a living faith yes it was a dead
[1:08:12] faith no
[1:08:14] if a brother or sister be naked and
[1:08:16] destitute of daily food
[1:08:19] and one of you say unto them depart
[1:08:22] in peace be warmed and
[1:08:25] filled notwithstanding
[1:08:28] you give them not those things which are
[1:08:32] needful to the body what does it profit
[1:08:36] and he said even so he said faith
[1:08:40] if it hath not works is dead
[1:08:43] amen being alone oh i believe this and i
[1:08:47] believe that
[1:08:48] yeah but if you truly believe it in your
[1:08:50] heart it's going to reflect in your
[1:08:52] life your faith amen
[1:08:57] so even so faith if it hath not works is
[1:09:00] dead being alone yeah a man may say
[1:09:04] thou hast faith and i have works
[1:09:08] show me thy faith without thy works
[1:09:12] and i will show thee my faith by my
[1:09:15] works
[1:09:16] amen thou believers say there
[1:09:20] is one god thou do as well
[1:09:23] the devils also believe and
[1:09:27] tremble amen
[1:09:31] but will thou know o vain man
[1:09:34] that faith without works is dead
[1:09:39] they got faith they got the revelation
[1:09:41] of this message
[1:09:42] oh i believe this and i believe this
[1:09:44] this is what god has done i believe what
[1:09:46] god is doing
[1:09:47] amen grace but brother
[1:09:50] is a controlling you or influencing your
[1:09:52] life what you do how you do it how you
[1:09:55] live
[1:09:56] what you talk and how you talk and so on
[1:09:58] amen
[1:09:59] is it influencing your conversation amen
[1:10:02] perfect faith with the perfect anointing
[1:10:06] amen there are those with faith but it's
[1:10:07] a dead work
[1:10:09] amen praise the lord
[1:10:14] and it says well thou know vain man that
[1:10:17] faith without works is dead
[1:10:19] was not abraham our father
[1:10:23] justified by works when he had offered
[1:10:26] isaac his son
[1:10:27] upon the altar amazing
[1:10:31] talk about perfect faith
[1:10:35] while his faith without work without the
[1:10:37] works wasn't
[1:10:39] would be dead but just think what god
[1:10:41] asked abraham to do
[1:10:43] and he's going to do it how much will we
[1:10:46] do
[1:10:48] how far will we go amen
[1:10:51] brother i trust we got the leadership of
[1:10:53] the holy ghost and not just a religious
[1:10:55] spirit
[1:10:57] amen so he said was not abraham our
[1:11:00] father justified by works
[1:11:02] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[1:11:04] the altar
[1:11:05] right see thou out faith
[1:11:09] brought with his works and by works was
[1:11:12] faith made perfect amen
[1:11:16] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:11:19] saith
[1:11:21] abraham believed god
[1:11:24] and it was imputed unto him for
[1:11:26] righteousness
[1:11:28] and he was called the friend of god
[1:11:31] hallelujah yeah ye see then
[1:11:35] how that by works a man is justified
[1:11:38] and not by faith only amen
[1:11:44] likewise also was not rahab the harlot
[1:11:47] justified by works
[1:11:48] when she had received the messengers and
[1:11:51] it sent them out
[1:11:52] another way for as the body without the
[1:11:55] spirit
[1:11:56] is dead so faith without works
[1:12:00] is dead also god bless his word you may
[1:12:02] be seated
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:08] you have faith show me your faith
[1:12:11] don't tell me your faith show me your
[1:12:13] faith amen
[1:12:15] and that's what god's looking for a
[1:12:17] faith that controls
[1:12:18] the life you live amen a faith that
[1:12:22] influences the life you live what you do
[1:12:24] how you do it when you do it where you
[1:12:26] do it amen
[1:12:27] because it has to be for the glory of
[1:12:29] god amen
[1:12:31] turn with me to genesis chapter 22
[1:12:35] and again to remind you that this that
[1:12:38] the prophet
[1:12:40] read i think it was four scriptures
[1:12:43] before going into the message works is
[1:12:46] faith express
[1:12:48] and in genesis chapter 22 and
[1:12:52] verse 1 and it came to pass
[1:12:56] after these things that god did tempt
[1:13:00] abraham and said unto him
[1:13:03] abraham and he said behold here i am
[1:13:07] and he said take now thy son thy only
[1:13:11] son isaac
[1:13:12] whom thou lovest and get thee
[1:13:16] into the land of moriah and offer him
[1:13:19] there
[1:13:20] for a burnt offering upon one
[1:13:24] of the mountains which i will tell thee
[1:13:26] of
[1:13:28] my this is amazing god was going to ask
[1:13:31] him to sacrifice his son
[1:13:34] not a sheep not a lamb not even a goat
[1:13:38] but sacrifice his son amen
[1:13:43] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[1:13:46] and saddled his ass
[1:13:48] and took two of his young men with him
[1:13:52] and isaac his son
[1:13:55] enclaved the wood for the burnt offering
[1:13:57] and rose up
[1:13:58] and went on to the place of which god
[1:14:00] had told him and then on the third day
[1:14:03] abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the
[1:14:05] place afar off
[1:14:07] and abraham said unto his young men
[1:14:10] abide ye
[1:14:11] ear with the with the ass
[1:14:14] and i that i am the lad
[1:14:17] will go beyond go yonder and worship
[1:14:23] and come again to you well
[1:14:27] he didn't lie oh but he was going to
[1:14:30] kill
[1:14:31] isaac yes but he but he had his faith
[1:14:34] not only believed in the death his faith
[1:14:36] believed in the resurrection
[1:14:38] amen he had that faith in their faith
[1:14:41] that he
[1:14:42] he could sacrifice isaac and amen and
[1:14:45] that god would raise him again from the
[1:14:46] dead
[1:14:48] amazing what is our faith
[1:14:51] what is our faith we want to do this we
[1:14:53] want to do that do this do this do this
[1:14:55] do what god wants you to do amen amen
[1:15:00] and again isaac speak unto abraham his
[1:15:03] father and said my father
[1:15:05] and he said here am i
[1:15:10] my son and he said behold the fire and
[1:15:14] the wood
[1:15:14] but where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:15:16] offering and abraham said my son
[1:15:19] god will provide himself a lamb for a
[1:15:21] burnt offering
[1:15:22] so they went both of them together
[1:15:27] amen and they came to the place
[1:15:31] which god had told him off and abraham
[1:15:33] built an altar there
[1:15:35] and laid wood on in order and bound
[1:15:37] isaac his son
[1:15:38] and laid him upon the altar upon the
[1:15:42] wood
[1:15:42] amen praise the lord pray grace lord
[1:15:48] abraham didn't stop and wait no no
[1:15:52] he just knew that there was something
[1:15:55] god god was moving in his in his life
[1:15:57] god was moving in isaac's life and so on
[1:16:00] because god had promised
[1:16:01] that he was going to have that child
[1:16:02] isaac and so on
[1:16:04] and through isaac this would happen and
[1:16:06] that would happen so on
[1:16:07] so he knew that if he if he did what god
[1:16:10] wanted him to do
[1:16:11] and sacrificed his son he knew that god
[1:16:13] would have to raise him up from the dead
[1:16:15] amen to do what he said he would do
[1:16:17] through isaac
[1:16:18] amen praise the name of the lord what
[1:16:21] faith do we have
[1:16:23] amen see our faith is only in the
[1:16:25] present tense
[1:16:26] what's going on this is going on that's
[1:16:28] going on but god wants you to do this
[1:16:30] and then then he'll change that
[1:16:32] by grace amen you got to take your stand
[1:16:36] for god
[1:16:37] amen praise the name of the lord for in
[1:16:40] the midst and in in the presence of
[1:16:42] family
[1:16:42] friends and neighbors you got to give
[1:16:45] god the preeminence
[1:16:46] amen amen they're not going to take
[1:16:50] god's place they're not going to get
[1:16:52] your attention amen
[1:16:54] more than god god got your attention
[1:16:56] what does god want you to do
[1:16:57] amen see works is faith expressed
[1:17:00] abraham had the faith
[1:17:02] and he went and did what god wanted him
[1:17:04] to do amen at least he did it all and
[1:17:06] got ready for it
[1:17:07] amen made the altar and even put isaac
[1:17:10] on the altar
[1:17:11] and he had raised the the the knife that
[1:17:13] he that he was going to use
[1:17:14] amen praise the lord amen say god let it
[1:17:17] go right on and on and on and on
[1:17:19] amen right to the almost to the end of
[1:17:22] it amen
[1:17:23] but when he raised his hand with the
[1:17:25] knife the angel stopped them
[1:17:27] praise the name of the lord hallelujah
[1:17:29] and sometimes god
[1:17:31] is looking for that same faith in you
[1:17:32] and me god wants you to move on move on
[1:17:35] move on
[1:17:36] and brother if and it brought forward to

[1:23:01] word
[1:23:01] or the spiritual revelation amen
[1:23:04] is it faith real faith there's too many
[1:23:08] that are going and that's all they have
[1:23:10] is religion amen they're controlled by
[1:23:12] religion
[1:23:13] they're governed by religion amen oh our
[1:23:16] religion is this our religion is that
[1:23:18] what about your faith to what you
[1:23:20] believe
[1:23:21] amen and believe in your heart by the
[1:23:24] grace of god
[1:23:25] not in your head many have got religion
[1:23:27] and in their heads
[1:23:29] but they don't have that faith in their
[1:23:30] hearts that's the truth
[1:23:33] i've met many many people over the years
[1:23:35] amen
[1:23:36] some are just religious and others are
[1:23:38] spiritual oh yeah
[1:23:40] i admit i just like i've already
[1:23:43] mentioned and gave testimony of it
[1:23:45] anglicans a couple of anchors that i met
[1:23:47] one time and they were spiritual
[1:23:50] amen it's like the animal man that came
[1:23:52] to my home a couple of times
[1:23:53] and like i said he gave me the tithes
[1:23:55] and he thanked me i thank you he said
[1:23:57] for you know what
[1:23:58] what you've done and you spiritually and
[1:24:00] and just
[1:24:01] encouraged me and so on and again and
[1:24:04] when i
[1:24:04] went somewhere to uh my i might have
[1:24:08] been the
[1:24:09] senior citizens home the glenbrook lodge
[1:24:11] at the time
[1:24:12] and this one of the men that was always
[1:24:15] in the chapel when i was there
[1:24:17] he was anglican that's the truth and he
[1:24:20] was right there worshiping and praising
[1:24:21] the lord
[1:24:22] and again one day i went there and he
[1:24:24] wasn't he didn't come to the chapel
[1:24:25] but then that's when the nurse come in
[1:24:27] and says pastor this this gentleman
[1:24:29] wants to see you
[1:24:30] he's in his room and he's sick and like
[1:24:32] i said i went off and he had his bible
[1:24:33] there and he had on things underlined in
[1:24:35] his bible
[1:24:36] and so on and and he said just well he
[1:24:39] said pastor thank you
[1:24:40] i just want you to have a word of prayer
[1:24:42] for me and uh
[1:24:44] but he knew that he was go he was dying
[1:24:46] he's i'm going
[1:24:47] and like i said he even showed me the
[1:24:49] scripture and he said that's
[1:24:50] i'm with that group right there he said
[1:24:52] and i said i believe it
[1:24:54] i said you're going to be there by the
[1:24:55] grace and he was anglican
[1:24:57] oh yeah and again like i said i i've
[1:24:59] been blessed by by the testimony of
[1:25:01] other
[1:25:02] roman catholics even oh yes
[1:25:05] and sometimes they'll bring things more
[1:25:07] more spiritual than what the protestants
[1:25:08] would bring out
[1:25:09] that's the truth praise the lord like i
[1:25:12] said that woman that
[1:25:13] was a neighbor to me one time some years
[1:25:15] ago and she's gone on
[1:25:16] and she just come out and she said
[1:25:18] excuse me what about this and i
[1:25:20] explained it oh
[1:25:21] she said that's right she said i believe
[1:25:23] that thank you
[1:25:25] yeah she be hallelujah amen god was
[1:25:28] was was vindicating her faith god was
[1:25:30] bringing out manifesting her faith
[1:25:32] amen at least to me and
[1:25:35] she's going on now and i think she was
[1:25:37] in her 90s when when the lord took her
[1:25:39] home
[1:25:39] amen so i i pray you grace you see and
[1:25:42] like i said keep your spirit right keep
[1:25:44] your attitude right toward everybody
[1:25:46] amen because there's some of the bride
[1:25:48] but others
[1:25:49] again like i said they're they're of
[1:25:51] god's calling but not not the chosen
[1:25:53] bride so they're going to be outside the
[1:25:55] city
[1:25:55] amen to god be the glory and again
[1:25:59] oh praise the lord i think it's a
[1:26:00] revelation we need amen
[1:26:02] to believe what god has done in this
[1:26:04] hour and he's doing in you and me
[1:26:06] amen that's the problem god said we want
[1:26:08] to reach everyone with this message
[1:26:11] no but he said bride because the message
[1:26:13] is the calling of the bride
[1:26:15] but but there's going to be others out
[1:26:16] there they're going to be saved so we
[1:26:18] pray the grace of god to them
[1:26:20] concerning what god is doing and what's
[1:26:21] what god is
[1:26:23] has done and what god is doing in these
[1:26:25] last days
[1:26:28] and i'll tell you that there are even
[1:26:29] even in denominational churches
[1:26:31] there are still those out there that
[1:26:33] brother
[1:26:34] they're spiritual amen they're not and
[1:26:36] again they're not
[1:26:37] not not everybody but many of them are
[1:26:39] spiritual in their hearts they see
[1:26:41] what's going on and they believe god
[1:26:43] and and they just say lord just just
[1:26:45] help us to keep believing
[1:26:46] help us to keep pressing on lord now
[1:26:49] they're not bright if they're
[1:26:50] bride they be in the message but they're
[1:26:52] definitely not bright
[1:26:53] saying yet it's been a mistake and a
[1:26:56] misunderstanding among
[1:26:57] a lot of believers thinking that we've
[1:26:59] got a witness of this message to
[1:27:01] everyone
[1:27:01] everyone everyone no no you should you
[1:27:04] just follow the leadership of god
[1:27:06] amen as the prophet of god said and he's
[1:27:08] if you're talking to a farmer i think it
[1:27:10] was
[1:27:10] and he said and he said you and he said
[1:27:13] something comes up
[1:27:13] it's spiritual and he said you can
[1:27:15] mention something with the lord and if
[1:27:17] you feel anything he said
[1:27:18] they're coming back at you he said
[1:27:19] change the conversation just
[1:27:21] go on talking about farming or if he's a
[1:27:24] car salesman
[1:27:25] he said you can speak something
[1:27:27] spiritual and if they resist it
[1:27:29] he said just keep on talking about cars
[1:27:31] see keep your attitude right and your
[1:27:33] spirit right
[1:27:34] amen because i tell you we are not
[1:27:36] self-righteous
[1:27:37] we're righteous amen we are righteous
[1:27:40] through our lord jesus christ
[1:27:42] amen so keep your attitude right and
[1:27:44] your spirit right
[1:27:45] amen these are those that are ordained
[1:27:48] to go in the resurrection and the
[1:27:49] rapture
[1:27:50] amen for to be the bride of the lord
[1:27:53] jesus christ
[1:27:54] amen we are we are united with him it is
[1:27:56] the as the prophet said
[1:27:58] we are experiencing the invisible union
[1:28:00] of the heavenly bridegroom
[1:28:02] and the earthly body amen so are we are
[1:28:05] do we have the faith of the bride of
[1:28:07] christ
[1:28:08] and do we have the works amen of the
[1:28:11] bride of christ
[1:28:13] amen by the grace of god in genesis
[1:28:16] again romans chapter 4 and verse 1 again
[1:28:22] what shall we say then that abraham our
[1:28:24] father as pertaining to the flesh
[1:28:27] hath found for if abraham were justified
[1:28:29] by works he hath we're off to glory but
[1:28:32] not before god
[1:28:33] for what saith the scripture abraham
[1:28:36] believed god
[1:28:37] amen grace that we believe god
[1:28:42] amen oh well i believe the message
[1:28:46] so does the devil amen
[1:28:49] do we believe god that we have that
[1:28:52] faith in god
[1:28:53] amen god help us that we we believe him
[1:28:56] we
[1:28:57] we love him we trust him we respect him
[1:29:00] we respect his word
[1:29:01] and we respect his it's his sons and
[1:29:03] daughters
[1:29:04] amen so he said
[1:29:09] for what saith the scripture abraham
[1:29:11] believed
[1:29:12] god you believe god do you believe what
[1:29:16] he said do you believe what he's
[1:29:17] what he's what he did you believe what
[1:29:18] he's doing you believe what he's going
[1:29:20] to do
[1:29:21] amen for abraham believed god and it was
[1:29:24] counted unto him for
[1:29:26] righteousness so how righteous are we
[1:29:29] yeah but does god recognize that
[1:29:30] righteousness
[1:29:33] and the only way that god's going to
[1:29:34] recognize that righteousness is the
[1:29:36] faith that's in your heart
[1:29:38] amen there's too many of there they got
[1:29:40] the message in their heads
[1:29:42] but they're not righteous before god
[1:29:43] because they're not in their hearts
[1:29:45] amen because i i've met so-called
[1:29:48] believers and they're just that their
[1:29:50] spirit and their attitude is not
[1:29:52] spiritual no it's more religious
[1:29:56] than spiritual they're just religious
[1:29:59] got religious spirits oh yeah they read
[1:30:02] the message
[1:30:03] yeah but you can meet the devil and you
[1:30:05] tell you the same thing
[1:30:07] i believe the message and sometimes the
[1:30:09] devil is more enthused
[1:30:11] and excited over all these things what's
[1:30:13] going on than so-called believers
[1:30:15] amen god help us brother
[1:30:19] so again verse 4 not to now to him that
[1:30:23] worketh is the reward not reckoned of
[1:30:25] grace
[1:30:26] but of death and he said to him that
[1:30:28] worketh not
[1:30:29] but believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:30:31] ungodly
[1:30:32] his faith is counted for righteousness
[1:30:35] amen
[1:30:36] but brother it's a faith but it's a
[1:30:38] faith with works
[1:30:40] you do god gives you the faith and you
[1:30:42] go and you live it
[1:30:44] and you walk it and you can talk it
[1:30:47] amen not just talk it
[1:30:50] but you live it and you walk it
[1:30:53] god help me have mercy amen that we go
[1:30:56] forth today
[1:30:57] amen with the righteousness of our faith
[1:31:01] amen that god is god was with me to
[1:31:03] bring me in here
[1:31:04] god's going to with me to go out and
[1:31:06] god's going to be with me when i do this
[1:31:07] when i go here when i go there
[1:31:09] there's nowhere you can go and leave god
[1:31:10] out
[1:31:12] there's nothing you can do and and
[1:31:14] forget the lord
[1:31:16] no no you want god in it all as i said
[1:31:19] in
[1:31:19] regards to the work that i did i wanted
[1:31:21] to do it in the name of the lord
[1:31:22] regardless of the work that i did i i
[1:31:24] just wanted god's leadership and god's
[1:31:26] anointing to god help me to do it
[1:31:28] amen and that's why it's like i said
[1:31:30] they said oh brother you do this you do
[1:31:32] this this is wonderful this is wonderful
[1:31:34] no it's not me it's jesus
[1:31:36] amen he's with me to help me he gives me
[1:31:38] the wisdom he gives me the understanding
[1:31:40] amen he's given me this leadership by
[1:31:43] the grace of god
[1:31:44] amen and brother again oh my
[1:31:48] well we think well no no and god's not
[1:31:50] in that you're in the department store
[1:31:52] there
[1:31:52] yes god's in it god's helping me
[1:31:56] amen brother and
[1:31:59] they asked me one time just how you do
[1:32:01] this how do you do that now do you do
[1:32:02] that and why do you do this what
[1:32:04] i said well i said i don't want to leave
[1:32:05] god out of it and i said
[1:32:07] oh because they said you're doing
[1:32:08] something this is good and that's good
[1:32:10] oh my

[1:32:23] and he's given me the wisdom that i need
[1:32:26] oh they said this is good
[1:32:27] why because when i would go to do work
[1:32:30] here and do the work there
[1:32:31] they just thought i was really
[1:32:32] experienced but it wasn't me it was god
[1:32:34] amen yes don't be afraid

[1:32:44] lord is helping me
[1:32:46] and and regarding you or whatever i'll
[1:32:48] pray for you

[1:38:00] amen thank the lord praise the lord
[1:38:03] sorry romans chapter 4
[1:38:07] yeah we we read it
[1:38:17] listen again abraham believed god and it
[1:38:20] was accounted unto him for
[1:38:22] righteousness amen because he believed
[1:38:25] in his heart
[1:38:27] you're righteous if you're righteous god
[1:38:29] recognize your faith
[1:38:30] in your heart not your head amen
[1:38:34] god recognizes truly that you're born
[1:38:36] again from the inside out
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:45] and verse 5 again of chapter 4 to him
[1:38:48] that worketh not
[1:38:49] but believeth on him that justifieth the
[1:38:52] ungodly
[1:38:53] his faith is counted for righteousness
[1:38:57] amen god give us faith
[1:39:00] trust the lord amen
[1:39:04] even as david also described the
[1:39:06] blessedness of the man
[1:39:07] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[1:39:10] without
[1:39:11] works alleluia saying blessed are they
[1:39:15] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[1:39:17] sins are covered
[1:39:19] blessed is the man to whom the lord will
[1:39:22] not impute sin amen
[1:39:27] and one more scripture genesis 15
[1:39:38] amen
[1:39:40] praise the lord
[1:39:46] and in genesis chapter 15 just a couple
[1:39:49] of verses
[1:39:54] after these things verse 1
[1:39:58] the word of the lord came unto abram
[1:40:01] in a vision saying fear not
[1:40:04] abram i am thy shield
[1:40:09] and thy exceeding great reward
[1:40:13] and abraham said lord god will thou
[1:40:18] what will thou give me seeing i go
[1:40:21] childless and the steward of my house
[1:40:26] is this eleazar of damascus
[1:40:30] and abram said behold to me
[1:40:34] thou has given no seed
[1:40:37] and lo one born in my house is mine heir
[1:40:41] and behold the word of the lord came
[1:40:44] unto him saying
[1:40:47] this shall be thine thine air
[1:40:51] but he that shall come forth out of
[1:40:52] thine own bowels
[1:40:55] shall be shall be thine air
[1:40:59] amen and he brought him forth abroad
[1:41:04] and said look now toward heaven and tell
[1:41:07] the stars
[1:41:08] and if thou be able to number them and
[1:41:10] he said unto him
[1:41:12] so shall thy seed be and he believed in
[1:41:16] the lord
[1:41:17] and he counted it to him for
[1:41:19] righteousness
[1:41:20] praise the lord he believed he didn't
[1:41:23] question god
[1:41:24] he believed god he didn't know god
[1:41:27] he trusted god amen praise the name of
[1:41:31] the lord
[1:41:32] and after having read all these
[1:41:34] scriptures the prophet of god said
[1:41:39] now he said paul justified abraham by
[1:41:41] what god
[1:41:42] saw in abraham but he said james
[1:41:45] justified abraham by what
[1:41:47] man saw in abraham
[1:41:50] so we're justified not by what man sees
[1:41:53] but by what god sees
[1:41:55] amen so he said abraham believe god
[1:41:58] and that's what god saw in him he
[1:42:01] believed it
[1:42:02] but then when he went to acting as
[1:42:04] though it was already done
[1:42:06] that's what man saw in abraham amen
[1:42:10] praise the lord hallelujah do we have
[1:42:14] that absolute faith
[1:42:15] in the resurrection that absolute faith
[1:42:18] in the rapture
[1:42:20] that we're not looking for for this to
[1:42:22] improve out here
[1:42:23] we're looking for our faith to improve
[1:42:25] we're looking for our faith to grow
[1:42:27] and increase amen so that oh but there's
[1:42:30] too many just still looking for god to
[1:42:32] change that out there
[1:42:33] no he's got to start here amen when it
[1:42:36] comes to the changing of the world he's
[1:42:37] got to start with you and me
[1:42:39] in our hearts and our souls amen so do
[1:42:42] we believe god
[1:42:43] as abraham believed god amen and if we
[1:42:47] believe
[1:42:47] god as abraham believed god we're going
[1:42:49] to go forth
[1:42:50] with the works of faith amen
[1:42:54] oh yeah you're going to reflect your
[1:42:56] faith in the works you do
[1:42:58] in what you do and how you do it amen
[1:43:02] are we going to do it as god wants us to
[1:43:04] do it are we just going to do this oh i
[1:43:06] just want to impress
[1:43:07] god and all you impress god by what he
[1:43:08] wants you to do
[1:43:10] amen not by what you want to do and if
[1:43:13] we're born again
[1:43:14] and we have the faith the true faith
[1:43:16] that pleases god
[1:43:17] we're going to do what god wants us to
[1:43:19] do we're going to do what pleases god
[1:43:22] again as jesus said not my will but
[1:43:25] thine be done
[1:43:26] praise the lord amen and there are
[1:43:28] religious people
[1:43:29] and there's oh yeah there's so many a
[1:43:31] believer they wanted they feel to do
[1:43:33] this they feel to do that
[1:43:35] oh they oh i'm a believer so i'm going
[1:43:37] to do this for god i'm going to do that
[1:43:38] for god
[1:43:39] but does god want you to do it amen
[1:43:43] brother we can do this and do that
[1:43:45] brother and it's and again

[1:44:27] everyday living are reflecting the love
[1:44:30] of god
[1:44:31] the grace of god the mercy of god amen
[1:44:34] are you reflecting the righteousness of
[1:44:37] god
[1:44:38] amen because this is this is what faith
[1:44:41] is considered
[1:44:42] amen righteousness abraham believed god
[1:44:45] and it was counted to him for
[1:44:47] righteousness
[1:44:49] amazing and if we believe god is
[1:44:51] accounted to us for righteousness
[1:44:53] amen it is the righteousness that's
[1:44:56] imputed to us by
[1:44:57] faith amen holy ghost
[1:45:00] faith amen you can be religious and you
[1:45:03] can believe this believe this believe
[1:45:05] that
[1:45:06] in your head but it's not righteous in
[1:45:08] the eyes of god
[1:45:09] you're just religious amen but you
[1:45:12] believe it in your heart
[1:45:14] oh god looks down and he sees the
[1:45:15] righteousness of god in in you
[1:45:18] amen why because what you believe
[1:45:21] is the revelation of the word in your
[1:45:23] soul redemption
[1:45:25] salvation amen he's there to help you
[1:45:30] amen and you're there to let him do what
[1:45:32] he wants to do through you

[1:45:37] him

[1:45:40] of his grace testify of his mercy and
[1:45:41] his love
[1:45:42] testify of his redemption amen praise
[1:45:45] the name of the lord
[1:45:46] testify amen of the planned purpose and
[1:45:49] the pattern of god to
[1:45:51] oh you're going to give the glory to god
[1:45:54] most definitely
[1:45:55] amen if you're redeemed if you're if you
[1:45:58] feel that you're saved you've had an
[1:45:59] experience with god
[1:46:00] amen you're going to give the glory to
[1:46:02] him thank you lord

[1:46:05] you did that lord keep me in the spirit
[1:46:08] lord
[1:46:08] amen so i'm going to be led by the
[1:46:11] spirit
[1:46:12] sons and daughters of god led by the
[1:46:13] spirit of god amen
[1:46:15] by the grace of god by the grace of god
[1:46:18] amen is his spirit in control
[1:46:21] of you from your heart praise the name
[1:46:24] of the lord
[1:46:26] amen and again the prophet said he said
[1:46:31] see he said abraham believed god and
[1:46:34] that's what god saw
[1:46:35] in him he believed it but then he said
[1:46:38] when he went to acting
[1:46:40] as though it was already done that's
[1:46:42] what man saw in him
[1:46:44] yeah god saw sees the faith
[1:46:48] that motivates you why you live the way
[1:46:50] you live and act the way you act
[1:46:52] oh it's not because of something in your
[1:46:54] head no it's it's it's a it's the new
[1:46:56] life in your heart
[1:46:58] ah you're born again not not out here
[1:47:01] not there
[1:47:02] you're born again in on the inside the
[1:47:04] inside
[1:47:05] amen praise the lord but that's what god
[1:47:08] sees
[1:47:09] that's what god's looking for what's on
[1:47:11] the inside of the inside
[1:47:12] amen man is going to see what you're
[1:47:15] doing outside
[1:47:16] well why do you do this why do you do
[1:47:18] that
[1:47:19] well it's just the nature of god i guess
[1:47:22] i i've had an experience with the lord
[1:47:24] and he's in control amen i'm just going
[1:47:27] to do what he wants me to do
[1:47:29] by the grace of god amen
[1:47:33] so he said god saw his faith but man saw
[1:47:36] his works praise the lord amen
[1:47:40] and that's the same as it is to us
[1:47:42] because our works
[1:47:44] express what faith we have all right
[1:47:47] is the life you live at home and at work
[1:47:51] is the life you live expressing what god
[1:47:55] sees in you amen praise the lord
[1:48:01] and that's the same as it is to us
[1:48:02] because our works
[1:48:04] express what faith we have but if we're
[1:48:07] afraid
[1:48:07] to act on what we believe then we do not
[1:48:11] believe it
[1:48:12] amen sister that's right praise the lord
[1:48:16] if we're afraid to act on it or uh
[1:48:20] they'll think i'm religious regard it
[1:48:23] doesn't make it then what they think
[1:48:24] what does god think do it for the glory
[1:48:27] of god
[1:48:28] amen you're not going to do it to
[1:48:31] impress anybody
[1:48:32] amen do it for to be be oh my god hidden
[1:48:35] and god revealed in simplicity in your
[1:48:38] life
[1:48:39] amen praise that you're just yeah
[1:48:42] you're not you're not showing off as if
[1:48:45] you're overly spiritual
[1:48:46] and you're this and you're that no no
[1:48:50] brother i tell you jesus didn't go and
[1:48:51] live that kind of life
[1:48:53] it was god in simplicity amen
[1:48:56] and then but the thing of the thing of
[1:48:58] it is that his his life was
[1:49:00] was was simple his life was humble amen
[1:49:03] and of course that if you went along
[1:49:06] with jesus before you knew that
[1:49:08] he was he was united with god
[1:49:12] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:49:15] brother god help us
[1:49:18] it's not it's not they recognize oh they
[1:49:20] recognize your faith because
[1:49:22] oh on wednesday you're going to go to
[1:49:23] church or sunday you got to go to church
[1:49:25] well yeah they're religious that's what
[1:49:28] most people think
[1:49:30] when you go to church you're religious
[1:49:32] but there are others
[1:49:33] who will watch your life and see your
[1:49:35] see your life more personal
[1:49:37] and what you're doing and how you do it
[1:49:39] and the visitors that are coming to you
[1:49:41] and so on
[1:49:42] oh yeah they'll recognize oh they're
[1:49:43] spiritual or
[1:49:45] they must be christian not this church
[1:49:49] or that church or that church no you're
[1:49:50] a christian
[1:49:52] see a christian is not church like a
[1:49:54] christian is christ-like
[1:49:57] amen praise the lord and there's too
[1:49:59] many church-like
[1:50:00] there's too many like this and like that
[1:50:02] and like that amen
[1:50:04] people can identify him and connect them
[1:50:06] with maybe with even william branham
[1:50:08] and they'll connect you with this and
[1:50:09] connect you with that that's church or
[1:50:10] that church
[1:50:11] or their pentecost pentecost
[1:50:15] no plenty cross
[1:50:18] yeah brother no no we're spiritual
[1:50:22] we're christian again as i said that and
[1:50:25] it's for the glory of god
[1:50:27] as that elderly man came to me one time
[1:50:31] when i was working there somewhere
[1:50:32] and he was older much older than i was
[1:50:35] then
[1:50:35] amen and he just said just want to let

[1:50:39] i know you're a christian oh okay thank
[1:50:42] you
[1:50:42] oh he said just want to let you know
[1:50:43] what he said and i don't know what told
[1:50:45] him or
[1:50:46] how he i just what what led him to
[1:50:48] believe that but he said i just just
[1:50:50] want to thank you yeah amazing
[1:50:54] to god be the glory how many feel that
[1:50:57] with you
[1:50:57] if they meet you brother let's see that
[1:51:00] you're a christian
[1:51:01] not you know because of your spirit
[1:51:04] because of your attitude because of your
[1:51:05] actions because of your reaction not
[1:51:06] because
[1:51:07] it that you as a sister got long hair
[1:51:10] you as a sister are dressed this way in
[1:51:12] that way
[1:51:13] no you're different people recognize you
[1:51:15] as a christian
[1:51:17] that's part of it but again it's
[1:51:19] discerning your spirit
[1:51:20] and your attitude you know the way you
[1:51:23] talk the way you
[1:51:24] do this the way you do that you're not
[1:51:26] boasting in

[1:51:30] yourself
[1:51:31] or we believe this we believe that and
[1:51:33] so on no see it's just like again
[1:51:35] there's a lady online
[1:51:38] i said that there was a gentleman online
[1:51:40] that's preached for a hour and a half
[1:51:42] and why he left the brand of message
[1:51:45] and there's a lady there online and
[1:51:48] she's
[1:51:49] she's just talking maybe a half hour or
[1:51:50] so and

[1:52:10] she was born and raised around the
[1:52:12] message
[1:52:14] yeah and then as she got older she began
[1:52:17] to question the message
[1:52:19] she began to question this and
[1:52:20] questioned that yeah
[1:52:22] and they said oh they believed this and
[1:52:24] they believed that and she felt it
[1:52:25] wasn't
[1:52:26] it wasn't right to have that kind of a

[2:12:50] as i said
[2:12:52] this is another issue
[2:12:55] that when i was working in that
[2:12:57] department store many many years ago
[2:13:02] and then i noticed that a gentleman cam
[2:13:04] comes in
[2:13:07] and he had three or four children with
[2:13:09] him
[2:13:11] and then i i was near and i said oh
[2:13:15] i said good day he said yes thank you
[2:13:17] thank you
[2:13:19] and i said what's wrong with this one oh
[2:13:21] he said she's sick
[2:13:23] she's not well and they said that but
[2:13:26] they don't think that she'll ever make
[2:13:28] it to go to school
[2:13:29] i said what i said i'll pray for her
[2:13:32] oh he said good thank you and so what
[2:13:35] did i do
[2:13:36] i left the that area and i walked on
[2:13:40] into the
[2:13:42] the the other area where they go to take
[2:13:44] their breaks and so on
[2:13:46] and then i went beyond that
[2:13:50] amen to where i was i was alone and i
[2:13:53] bowed my head and prayed for the grace
[2:13:56] of god to that child
[2:13:58] amen praise the lord and i came out
[2:14:03] and he said thank you yes that's good
[2:14:07] amen and the child was looking better
[2:14:10] and feeling better
[2:14:12] oh i said wonderful praise the lord he
[2:14:14] said thank you

[2:14:18] now
[2:14:19] amen maybe serving the lord that's right
[2:14:22] and again in that in another
[2:14:26] place it was a supermarket and we were
[2:14:28] there and at groceries and i came out
[2:14:30] and we were all lined up and right in
[2:14:33] front of me was a child in a in that
[2:14:36] cart and it was sick oh she said yes the
[2:14:40] mother said she's sick
[2:14:43] and i just moved closer and i prayed
[2:14:47] i said lord in the name of jesus i pray
[2:14:49] grace to heal this child
[2:14:51] amen and the lord undertook
[2:14:54] by the grace of god so brother sister
[2:14:57] what testimony are we going to leave
[2:14:59] with the people amen amen

[2:15:04] much we're taking too much natural
[2:15:06] things

[2:15:09] natural natural natural death this this
[2:15:11] this
[2:15:12] let's talk spiritual amen

[2:15:19] and let our faith be manifested in our
[2:15:22] works
[2:15:23] by grace amen
[2:15:27] and the angel they told a god told
[2:15:29] abraham and sarah said they're going to
[2:15:31] have a baby
[2:15:32] and he believed god's promise amen
[2:15:36] we're going into a resurrection rapture
[2:15:38] do we believe
[2:15:39] the resurrection are we really looking
[2:15:41] for the resurrection
[2:15:44] are we looking for the rapture he said
[2:15:48] see
[2:15:48] he made every he made ready everything
[2:15:51] for this baby
[2:15:52] yeah and see that's what god saw
[2:15:56] when he believed god and man saw what he
[2:15:58] did
[2:15:59] to express what he believed man sees you
[2:16:02] what you do to express the faith of the
[2:16:05] resurrection and rapture
[2:16:07] amen and that's the same thing that
[2:16:11] works tonight
[2:16:12] the same way it is with us amen
[2:16:16] it had been revealed to him so he
[2:16:18] believed it
[2:16:19] and was acting as though it had already
[2:16:22] took place
[2:16:25] and he said listen just a minute
[2:16:28] sometimes he said we
[2:16:30] misunderstand it and people gets emotion
[2:16:33] and they try to work on emotion that
[2:16:35] won't work
[2:16:37] amen what god is looking for is faith
[2:16:39] that you believe it in your heart
[2:16:42] not emotion not sensation not failings
[2:16:46] but faith amen
[2:16:55] trying to skip some of this
[2:16:59] he's talking about a problem with a boy
[2:17:05] and he said little boy that never walked
[2:17:08] would try to walk down this aisle again
[2:17:10] he would fall down a dozen times and be
[2:17:13] wore out
[2:17:14] before he got there but anybody who
[2:17:17] knows how to walk
[2:17:18] an athlete would walk right down that
[2:17:20] aisle and never even notice
[2:17:22] doing it well he had that to start with
[2:17:25] and that's what he is now
[2:17:27] he said well that's the way with
[2:17:28] preaching divine healing
[2:17:32] and he said as you go along you begin to
[2:17:34] learn and if you don't learn there's
[2:17:36] something wrong
[2:17:37] he said you've got to learn amen
[2:17:40] surely you've learned something from the
[2:17:42] ministry through the preaching of the
[2:17:44] word
[2:17:45] amen pray the grace of god
[2:17:49] that's through the ministry of our
[2:17:50] brother jonathan that we're we're
[2:17:51] learning
[2:17:52] and we're hallelujah we're getting a
[2:17:55] greater and a greater revelation of
[2:17:56] faith amen faith
[2:18:00] and he says you've got to learn how to
[2:18:03] accept god
[2:18:04] and what it really means you got to
[2:18:06] learn how to accept
[2:18:08] yes salvation redemption the
[2:18:12] healing amen the resurrection the
[2:18:15] rapture
[2:18:16] amen get into the word to know what it
[2:18:19] means
[2:18:21] amen and that's the thing that that will
[2:18:23] control
[2:18:24] your thoughts your words your deeds
[2:18:26] everything you're living
[2:18:27] looking for the rapture looking for the
[2:18:29] resurrection oh lord
[2:18:31] in the name of jesus bring the
[2:18:33] resurrection see we gotta be calling for
[2:18:34] it
[2:18:35] as luther was calling for justification
[2:18:38] then they called for sanctification
[2:18:40] amen the gifts of the spirit the baptism
[2:18:42] of the holy ghost
[2:18:43] so what are we calling for we're calling
[2:18:46] for the resurrection we're calling for
[2:18:49] the rapture
[2:18:50] because that's the next thing in line
[2:18:52] for god
[2:18:53] amen grace to us
[2:18:57] amen
[2:19:02] he says the same way with preaching
[2:19:04] divine healing and he said as you go
[2:19:06] along
[2:19:06] you begin to learn again we what are we
[2:19:09] learning
[2:19:10] not not doctrine oh i learned this
[2:19:13] doctrine the
[2:19:14] the the the of the godhead and
[2:19:17] the doctrine of water baptism the
[2:19:18] doctrine of this the doctrine of that
[2:19:20] brother we need to get more and more
[2:19:21] into the revelation of the resurrection
[2:19:24] we need to think think more and more
[2:19:25] about the resurrection think more and
[2:19:26] more with the rapture
[2:19:29] i'll tell you if we're if we got the
[2:19:31] baptism of the holy ghost that we won't
[2:19:33] we won't in our hearts
[2:19:34] we won't forget it there's no way that
[2:19:37] we'll be able to live a day
[2:19:38] without thinking about the resurrection
[2:19:39] of rapture no
[2:19:42] no they couldn't luther couldn't forget
[2:19:44] justification
[2:19:45] the others couldn't forget saying the
[2:19:47] the pentecostals they couldn't forget it
[2:19:49] the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts
[2:19:51] of the spirit morning noon and night
[2:19:54] that's all they were praying for calling
[2:19:55] on the lord screaming out
[2:19:57] amen worshiping amen to find
[2:20:00] a lot of them began to speak with tongs
[2:20:02] and this and that that and again there's
[2:20:03] nothing wrong with that like brother
[2:20:05] brown said that god didn't take the gift
[2:20:06] of thumbs away
[2:20:07] he said he just laid it on the shelf so
[2:20:09] he says there he said if
[2:20:10] you if you need it it's there if you
[2:20:11] want it and so on
[2:20:13] and so brother now it's moving on
[2:20:17] what are we calling for and but again
[2:20:19] that was
[2:20:20] my luther's revival john wesley's
[2:20:23] revival
[2:20:24] the salvation army revival the
[2:20:26] pentecostal revival
[2:20:27] oh my but then there's a bride revival
[2:20:30] but the prophet of god said it's not
[2:20:32] he said well he said the broad revival
[2:20:34] is not going to be like that
[2:20:36] like the methodists like the lutherans
[2:20:39] no no
[2:20:40] or like the pentecostal no now the bride
[2:20:43] revive is going to be different
[2:20:45] it's not feelings it's faith
[2:20:49] amen it's not god oh my god doing this
[2:20:53] god doing that
[2:20:54] always god changing us from time to
[2:20:56] eternity
[2:20:58] amen getting our attention away from the
[2:21:00] flesh
[2:21:01] and into the spirit by the grace of god
[2:21:05] oh yeah brother the prophet said he said
[2:21:07] the bride revival
[2:21:08] is not going to be like these revivals
[2:21:12] no no he said the people are going to
[2:21:14] wander you know or think oh it should be
[2:21:16] like this you'd be like that no no
[2:21:17] bright revival it's not like that be
[2:21:21] still
[2:21:22] and know that i am god
[2:21:25] amen be still and experience the
[2:21:29] resurrection
[2:21:30] be stale and experience the rapture amen
[2:21:34] god was moving all the others down
[2:21:35] through the ages he was moving them on
[2:21:37] move on move on
[2:21:38] move on no now stop
[2:21:43] look up your redemption
[2:21:46] draweth not oh oh
[2:21:49] so oh we're not going on no no we're not
[2:21:51] going on
[2:21:52] go back to eternity
[2:21:55] it's the end go back where you come from
[2:21:59] amen that's what jesus did amen
[2:22:02] he went on and on and on until he came
[2:22:04] to that time in his ministry in his life
[2:22:07] not my will father thou be done because
[2:22:09] he knew to get back
[2:22:11] he said no man has ascended up only he
[2:22:13] that came down
[2:22:14] from heaven even the son of man who is
[2:22:17] in heaven that was him amen
[2:22:21] so it's theophany body that he had there
[2:22:23] it was still there
[2:22:25] and jesus was going to go back to that
[2:22:27] amen
[2:22:29] or he's going to have he's going to have
[2:22:30] that body because he got a fellowship
[2:22:31] with you and me
[2:22:33] and it was the body of jesus amen praise
[2:22:36] the name of the lord
[2:22:38] hallelujah so break grace of god that he
[2:22:41] that was it it was the end of his
[2:22:43] ministry like that he knew the price
[2:22:45] he'd have to pay
[2:22:48] to get back he'd had to lay down his
[2:22:50] life and pick it up again
[2:22:53] he had to suffer and endure much
[2:23:00] i i don't think many believers
[2:23:04] are with jesus and the fellowship of his
[2:23:06] suffering
[2:23:09] now can we stop and really consider
[2:23:12] what jesus did to redeem us what he
[2:23:15] experienced to redeem us the pain
[2:23:17] the agony the sorrow that jesus had
[2:23:22] and that he experienced in the flesh and
[2:23:23] it wasn't just for me
[2:23:26] it wasn't just for us brother it was for
[2:23:29] millions
[2:23:31] that he did it millions
[2:23:35] yeah of those that were born in sin
[2:23:40] grace of god to us thank you jesus for
[2:23:42] what you did
[2:23:43] brother if we consider what he did uh he
[2:23:46] it will humble us
[2:23:48] amen consider what he suffered for you
[2:23:50] it'll humble you
[2:23:52] god help us amen that will
[2:23:55] as he lays down for us that we're going
[2:23:57] to lay down our lives for one another
[2:24:00] amen by the grace of god amen
[2:24:07] a gift is a wonderful but you can't base
[2:24:11] your eternal destination on gifts
[2:24:14] he said you cannot major on a minor and
[2:24:17] the gift is a minor
[2:24:19] and satan can impersonate any gift that
[2:24:21] god's got
[2:24:22] and you can make something just exactly
[2:24:25] like it
[2:24:26] and he said therefore he said we got to
[2:24:28] watch it like sometimes i express
[2:24:30] that about shouting and i've been i've
[2:24:33] seen demons shout
[2:24:34] speak in tongues i've seen demons speak
[2:24:37] in tongues
[2:24:38] amen sure he impersonates it
[2:24:42] and it's a genuine but it's impersonates
[2:24:45] it if either you see it makes it looks
[2:24:48] like it's real
[2:24:49] and people sometimes he said who don't
[2:24:51] know the difference declares this to be
[2:24:53] a real
[2:24:54] when it isn't real amen is satan
[2:24:57] impersonating
[2:24:59] is satan impersonating christians
[2:25:02] impersonating believers yeah yeah he's
[2:25:05] got he's got him out there and drawing
[2:25:06] is a 19. yeah grace of god
[2:25:10] drawdry is influenced
[2:25:15] and people who sometimes don't know the
[2:25:17] difference and declare this to be real
[2:25:19] when it's not real
[2:25:22] and the same thing they do about divine
[2:25:24] healing
[2:25:26] he said they think well it's ocus pocus
[2:25:30] or something like that it isn't it's a
[2:25:32] genuine all adulterated fate in what god
[2:25:35] said to be the truth amen
[2:25:38] and when it anchors he said there's
[2:25:40] nothing going to move it
[2:25:41] it's going to stay there i tell you it
[2:25:43] didn't move abraham's faith
[2:25:46] no siree he believed god at 75 years old
[2:25:50] he believed god at 100 years old oh yeah
[2:25:53] his faith in god brother he lived for
[2:25:55] god
[2:25:56] and amen when he was 75 he lived for god
[2:25:59] when he was a hundred
[2:26:01] he listened to god when he was 75 he
[2:26:02] listened to god when he was a hundred
[2:26:04] i pray grace that we keep listening to
[2:26:06] the lord and we become more and more
[2:26:08] spiritual
[2:26:09] i'll have to finish right here somewhere
[2:26:14] he said faith is a revelation from god
[2:26:18] and faith is a revelation
[2:26:21] there's where i want to stay just a
[2:26:23] moment
[2:26:24] he said it's a revelation he has
[2:26:27] revealed it to you by his grace
[2:26:30] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[2:26:33] yourself up into faith
[2:26:35] you never have you ever have faith it's
[2:26:37] given to you
[2:26:38] by the grace of god yeah you got faith
[2:26:42] faith for salvation faith for healing
[2:26:44] faith for the resurrection faith for the
[2:26:46] rapture
[2:26:46] god give it to us amen
[2:26:50] and god reveals it to you and therefore
[2:26:53] faith
[2:26:53] is a revelation and the whole church of
[2:26:56] god
[2:26:57] is built upon the revelation amen
[2:27:01] brother is is not natural in our heads
[2:27:04] or in our natural
[2:27:05] ears lit in that earth an ear
[2:27:09] one here it's in your soul
[2:27:12] hear what the spirit is saying to the
[2:27:13] churches hear what spirit is saying to
[2:27:16] you
[2:27:16] amen praise the lord that's like in the
[2:27:19] ministry of the word
[2:27:20] those that are they're using these ears
[2:27:22] oh
[2:27:23] they hear this they hear that but then
[2:27:25] there's the one led into death in the
[2:27:26] ear
[2:27:28] oh did you hear this hear what oh
[2:27:32] hear this oh i didn't know if he said
[2:27:34] that oh yes i caught i caught the
[2:27:36] revelation when he said it
[2:27:38] yeah where's the person that's just
[2:27:40] listening to the ears they don't catch
[2:27:41] it
[2:27:42] but if they listen to the ear of the
[2:27:44] soul or they'll catch it
[2:27:46] well they'll see what the others don't
[2:27:49] see they hear what the others don't hear
[2:27:51] amen by the grace of god amen
[2:27:54] because why it's spiritual by the grace
[2:27:57] of god
[2:27:58] amen
[2:28:04] and he goes back to start with abel by
[2:28:07] faith
[2:28:09] abel by faith revelation
[2:28:13] amen remember there was no bible written
[2:28:15] in those days
[2:28:19] but he said able by faith believed
[2:28:23] god had given him a revelation of
[2:28:26] redemption
[2:28:27] just thinking
[2:28:30] cain refused it cain didn't think he had
[2:28:33] to go do it that way
[2:28:36] oh yeah that's like there are those that
[2:28:38] looking maybe some that believe in a
[2:28:40] resurrection believe in a rapture
[2:28:41] but they don't think that we got to go
[2:28:43] this way to get the rapturing faith
[2:28:45] and the resurrection faith they don't
[2:28:47] think that we got to leave
[2:28:48] denominational churches and we got to do
[2:28:50] this we got to
[2:28:51] find the prophet and and hear his
[2:28:53] message and believe the message to get
[2:28:55] resurrection right no no they don't
[2:28:56] think that
[2:28:59] they think well god's going to do it
[2:29:00] yeah but they don't recognize what god's
[2:29:02] doing
[2:29:03] or the way he's going to do it all god
[2:29:05] will give us is god to give us that yeah
[2:29:07] and he's done it through the prophet no
[2:29:09] we don't believe that
[2:29:10] he wasn't the truth they feel he wasn't
[2:29:12] the true prophet
[2:29:14] oh my the negative things that are on on
[2:29:16] the internet concerning william branham
[2:29:19] oh he couldn't preach he couldn't do
[2:29:22] this he couldn't do that
[2:29:25] no maybe they felt jesus the same way
[2:29:29] yeah but look what he did he conquered
[2:29:32] death hell in the grave
[2:29:34] amen and not only that praise the name
[2:29:37] of the lord
[2:29:37] william bradley come and look what he
[2:29:39] did
[2:29:41] the victory that jesus purchased paid
[2:29:44] for
[2:29:45] was manifested giving us victory over
[2:29:48] the world the flesh the devil amen
[2:29:51] over death hell and the grave because we
[2:29:55] need it now
[2:29:57] we need it amen
[2:30:00] they didn't need it in luther's day
[2:30:01] wesley's day they had that faith to take
[2:30:03] them on
[2:30:04] on on into glory or into into that
[2:30:07] dimension when they died but now there
[2:30:10] is a generation that needs the faith
[2:30:12] for the resurrection the faith for the
[2:30:14] rapture
[2:30:15] amen god help us to believe
[2:30:20] and he said by faith abel it was
[2:30:23] revelation
[2:30:24] and there was no bible written in those
[2:30:26] days
[2:30:28] by abel by faith offered unto god a more
[2:30:31] excellent
[2:30:32] sacrifice than that which came which god
[2:30:35] testified he
[2:30:36] was righteous and how he said god
[2:30:39] testified by faith
[2:30:41] it was his faith was his righteousness
[2:30:44] that god saw
[2:30:46] amen and abel offered unto god
[2:30:50] a more excellent sacrifice because it
[2:30:53] was revealed to him
[2:30:55] that it wasn't the fruits of the field
[2:30:57] it was the blood
[2:31:01] amen that caused the fall and blood
[2:31:04] would redeem us
[2:31:05] amen oh yes it was blood
[2:31:09] blood was shed amen
[2:31:14] considering what what eve did oh yeah
[2:31:18] she shed blood grace of god
[2:31:22] and this woman that's on the internet
[2:31:25] there and talking about
[2:31:26] she was raised in in william brown's
[2:31:28] message and raised this way in the
[2:31:29] church
[2:31:30] and she left it and she talked about the
[2:31:33] oh yeah she said
[2:31:34] oh they tried to tell us that oh
[2:31:37] there's no such thing as a trinity well
[2:31:41] we're not denying the trinity we're
[2:31:42] denying the personage of the trinity
[2:31:44] they're trying to say it's three persons
[2:31:46] no no it's just one person
[2:31:48] yeah and he he came in in in the father
[2:31:52] he came in the son they came in the holy
[2:31:54] ghost
[2:31:54] but it's just one person by the grace of
[2:31:56] god but she
[2:31:58] she was finding fought with this finding
[2:32:01] fault with that oh yeah they teach this
[2:32:02] they teach that and so on
[2:32:04] yeah and she highlighted the trinity and
[2:32:08] she liked it just maybe a few other
[2:32:10] things oh yeah
[2:32:10] concerning what happened in the garden
[2:32:12] of eden and she laughed at it
[2:32:15] she tried to teach she said this is what
[2:32:17] happened in the garden of eden
[2:32:20] and she was laughing
[2:32:23] one day god laugh at her
[2:32:26] yeah because her spirit is not right
[2:32:30] please let's have respect for god let's
[2:32:33] have respect for the message
[2:32:35] amen just have respect for what god is
[2:32:37] doing in our lives
[2:32:39] by the grace of god amen
[2:32:44] grace
[2:32:48] he says he said by faith and he said
[2:32:51] how is that by revelation
[2:32:55] abel offered the more excellent
[2:32:56] sacrifice because it was revealed to him
[2:33:00] that it wasn't the fruits of the field
[2:33:02] it was the blood
[2:33:03] amen it's revealed to us that it's not
[2:33:06] denominations
[2:33:08] no it's the reveal word
[2:33:11] by the holy ghost amen
[2:33:15] and that's why he said some people can
[2:33:17] believe it and some cannot believe it
[2:33:20] he said some try to make believe it
[2:33:23] god help us and he said there's some
[2:33:27] that's trying hard to believe it
[2:33:29] trying to work themselves into it some
[2:33:31] just can't do it
[2:33:32] and all others he said it's just
[2:33:36] by grace given to them
[2:33:39] and there is a difference and he said
[2:33:41] that's the real revelation because
[2:33:43] faith is a revelation from god and it
[2:33:46] must be revealed first
[2:33:48] amen praise the name of the lord
[2:33:53] amen god help us that we have a true
[2:33:56] holy ghost faith
[2:33:58] by the grace of god amen
[2:34:02] and faith we manifest that faith through
[2:34:04] our works
[2:34:05] and in our world the life we live is a
[2:34:08] reflection of the faith that god has
[2:34:10] given us
[2:34:12] it's not religion it's not something the
[2:34:13] church gives us it's something that god
[2:34:15] has given
[2:34:16] us by the grace of god help us lord
[2:34:19] to go on by faith amen
[2:34:22] go on keep moving as god reveals it keep
[2:34:26] doing it
[2:34:27] amen stay in the spirit by the grace of
[2:34:30] god
[2:34:31] amen god bless us let's stand
[2:34:34] and let's sing my father's house 261

[2:34:42] and we'll turn to our brother bob so
[2:34:44] grace again to understand that it is
[2:34:46] god's looking for faith that's right
[2:34:50] but god's looking for a real genuine
[2:34:53] faith
[2:34:54] that is going to be reflected in the
[2:34:55] works we do
[2:34:57] that's going to control the works we do
