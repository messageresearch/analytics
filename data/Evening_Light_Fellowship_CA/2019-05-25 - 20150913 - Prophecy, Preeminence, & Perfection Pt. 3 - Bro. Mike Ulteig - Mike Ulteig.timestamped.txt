[41:46] [Music]
[42:00] [Music]
[42:10] [Music]
[42:16] [Applause]
[42:37] [Music]
[42:55] when
[42:56] [Applause]
[42:58] [Music]
[43:09] maybe that happened this morning god
[43:12] bless you thank you turn your eyes upon
[43:15] Jesus and look phone to this wonderful
[43:19] face amen
[43:22] and the things of Earth will grow
[43:25] strangely dim the strange thing will
[43:29] take place everything start fading away
[43:32] he said you forget about the beans
[43:34] cooking on the stove you forget about
[43:36] this forget about that he said what is
[43:39] that he said the word is beginning to
[43:41] materialize before you so that's what we
[43:45] want this morning is for God's Word to
[43:47] materialize before us and everything
[43:50] will strangely just grow dim around us
[43:55] amen just haven't really enjoyed my time
[44:00] here and fellowship and and just really
[44:05] felt the delivered in your ministry and
[44:09] just you know when you have the Liberty
[44:13] what happens is when a minister is
[44:17] ministering
[44:19] and there's a genuine fool
[44:23] the net always maybe the congregation
[44:26] knows because it's not always a lot of
[44:28] noise and things going on but when
[44:31] there's a true divine pull and and I
[44:36] believe that comes from the people were
[44:39] in a unity and you know when brother
[44:43] Branham was on the scene there was a
[44:45] certain unity amongst the people because
[44:48] everybody was looking at him when he
[44:52] passed off the scene then there was a
[44:53] disunity everybody jockeying for
[44:56] position and different things taking
[44:58] place so then when he begins to manifest
[45:03] himself in a congregation through
[45:05] worship and in preparation for the word
[45:08] there becomes a certain unity not just
[45:12] looking to the minister that's
[45:14] ministering we're looking for Christ to
[45:17] come and reveal something to us and when
[45:20] you have a true unity brother Brown said
[45:22] that there's nothing but what the Holy
[45:23] Ghost can't do if we are in a true unity
[45:26] right and that's not all trying to think
[45:29] the same thought but turning our eyes to
[45:32] him this morning looking past these
[45:35] veils of flesh and then a strange thing
[45:38] happens that while the minister is
[45:39] ministering things start coming forth he
[45:43] never thought of before or oh I'll
[45:48] preach sometimes the subject at home and
[45:50] then I'll go someplace else and preach
[45:52] it and while I'm preaching it other
[45:55] things begin to open up on the thing
[45:57] that I preached at home I go home and I
[45:59] preach it again because it it unfolds
[46:02] under that inspiration so I'm as much as
[46:07] in anticipation as you are because I
[46:11] need revelation just like you do
[46:14] and sometimes it comes from my own mouth
[46:17] I'll be up preaching and I'll say
[46:19] something and you know and I'll be
[46:22] thinking while I'm preaching and I think
[46:25] that was that was good that was pretty
[46:30] good you know just and that's what we
[46:34] want this morning is we got the things
[46:37] laid out we got our notes but without
[46:42] here we can do nothing new notes coming
[46:47] from a man can be a lecture and I can go
[46:51] out and be received in an academic way
[46:55] but what we want this morning is his
[46:58] inspiration he said we've accepted the
[47:02] very truths of the Bible he said the
[47:06] scripture says we had become the very
[47:07] righteousness of God not imputed to
[47:10] become the righteousness of God he said
[47:14] but to many it's not real he said
[47:17] because it's not inspired so there's
[47:20] much of the message this morning that
[47:21] we've accepted and we believe it with
[47:23] our hearts but there's something that
[47:26] strangely it hasn't caused
[47:30] the the world to grow strangely dim in
[47:34] the light of the glory of his presence
[47:38] because that's what his face is when he
[47:41] turns his face towards someone that's
[47:44] his that's his presence unveiling
[47:47] himself to that individual so we want
[47:50] this morning as a further unveiling a
[47:53] greater realization you know I go out I
[47:58] Love New Mexico that's where I'm from
[48:00] and I'll go out there and I'll stand oh
[48:03] you can you can see for a hundred miles
[48:08] down there in Carolina the beauty is
[48:11] like a woman it's trees it's a softness
[48:13] to go out west and those Rockies it's
[48:16] like the ruggedness of the man and I
[48:19] just love the shield' of wind blowing
[48:20] and I'll go out there and I know I've
[48:23] got to come back to Carolina I try to
[48:26] soak it I tried to absorb it I try to do
[48:28] everything I can but you know when I go
[48:31] back home it's like I've never been
[48:33] there because he can't take it with
[48:37] but I've been there I know what it's
[48:39] like and I can tell you about it and I
[48:42] can create a vision in you but if you
[48:44] haven't been there you really don't know
[48:46] what it's like and some of you go there
[48:49] or no now stand there with you on a
[48:51] mountain I said isn't this just
[48:53] wonderful and you be seeing rocks and
[48:55] cactus and lizards and snakes and no
[49:00] tree within 100 miles just say I say
[49:04] isn't this beautiful you say what a
[49:06] waste as a beauty isn't I have the
[49:10] beholder
[49:11] this branch shall be beautiful in that
[49:14] day but not to all people it will be a
[49:19] beauty to behold but not to all people
[49:23] so may unfold himself this morning and
[49:29] may he inspires or to thy word just pray
[49:35] for me it just seems like when you come
[49:37] to the close of a service you're trying
[49:40] to bring everything to a summarization
[49:44] and to a climax and so that we can we
[49:48] can leave you with something that will
[49:52] take you further down the road
[49:54] and it's not our desire to confuse you
[49:57] or to leave you in a bewildered state
[50:00] but to leave something of his word in
[50:03] your heart to bring a greater clarity in
[50:07] the day that we live and so just pray
[50:12] for me that we can I was trying to
[50:15] explain to brother Marcus morning coming
[50:18] I just the more I try to condemn
[50:20] something the more it gets scattered out
[50:22] but I know he can do all things
[50:25] my desires that you know there's things
[50:28] I would like to say but there's things
[50:30] that he wants to say so if I can channel
[50:33] myself and just let him speak what he
[50:35] wants to speak this morning then that
[50:37] would be all that we need God can do
[50:43] much with a little Peter just a 15 or 20
[50:48] minute message and 3,000 people were
[50:51] converted
[50:53] brother branham went over to the two end
[50:56] you know I think it wasn't missionary
[50:58] been over ten years and he had what one
[51:00] convert to show for all that and in
[51:05] fifteen minutes thirty thousand
[51:09] blanketed natives if he comes on the
[51:13] scene he can do much a little
[51:17] they might to fish five loads he can do
[51:19] much with little and man he does little
[51:23] with much so may he come the song that
[51:29] and do much with what little that we
[51:33] have in our hearts and minds I'd like to
[51:37] maybe this morning I kind of do not
[51:40] changing directions but I my notes a
[51:43] little bit different man sitting here in
[51:45] the study but I'd like to if we can I'd
[51:51] like to read two verses of Scripture let
[51:55] you be seated and then read some more
[51:58] I'd like to turn the Psalms 103 and
[52:04] verse seven
[52:18] and David riding here in the Psalms
[52:23] Psalms 103 in verse 7
[52:27] he made known his ways on to Moses his
[52:33] acts on to the children of Israel
[52:37] so now David writing here and her
[52:40] inspiration that there's a difference to
[52:42] know his ways and his acts you know
[52:48] people can be in church and they can see
[52:50] God do a lot of things they can see sick
[52:52] people heal I could see miracles they
[52:55] could see much but there's a difference
[53:00] in seeing the acts of God and the ways
[53:02] of God as we was talking that he said I
[53:05] have not given you a heart to perceive
[53:06] and yet they'd seen things they'd heard
[53:08] things they'd witnessed things they'd
[53:10] actually been partakers of those things
[53:12] they've eaten at those things they drink
[53:13] of those things but yet they only knew
[53:16] according to the scriptures they only
[53:18] knew the acts of God but there was
[53:21] something different in Moses and we also
[53:23] know when Joshua and Caleb that they had
[53:26] a heart to perceive and what was God
[53:28] trying to reveal to them in the
[53:30] wilderness he said that you might know
[53:32] that I am the Lord your God and then we
[53:36] taken from the scripture he said to whom
[53:39] is the arm of the Lord revealed and that
[53:41] means to whom is the power of God made
[53:44] known so in if you turn over to Psalms
[53:48] 95 and verse 10
[53:53] we also read this
[53:57] remember that he said over there in
[53:59] Deuteronomy 29 I've led you these 40
[54:02] years but I've not given you a heart to
[54:06] perceive or a heart to understand when I
[54:10] led you all these years you've seen
[54:12] these things you've heard these things
[54:13] to particularly things but I'm not
[54:16] giving you a heart to perceive or to
[54:18] understand and the whole purpose was
[54:21] that he would reveal himself his great
[54:23] power to the people
[54:24] that when they came to Kadish Bardia
[54:27] they would trust in him and his power
[54:29] and stand in the power of god and not
[54:32] her own verse 10 Psalms 95 40 years long
[54:38] was I grieved with this generation and
[54:41] said it is a people that do err in their
[54:45] heart then they have and they have not
[54:49] known my ways
[54:55] and that and that word error there it
[55:00] actually means to go straight and I want
[55:04] you to turn to Hebrews I said two
[55:07] scriptures but I got I had that one
[55:09] marked out in Hebrews chapter 3 I want
[55:12] to read this same thing verse 7 of
[55:19] Hebrews 3
[55:24] we're for as the holy ghost death today
[55:30] if you will hear his voice harden not
[55:34] your heart as in the provocation in the
[55:40] day of temptation in the wilderness when
[55:44] your father's tempted me proved me saw
[55:48] my mighty saw my works forty years
[55:51] wherefore I was grieved with that
[55:54] generation and said they do always err
[55:58] in their heart that means again to go
[56:02] astray and they have not known my ways
[56:06] now remember Israel didn't know the acts
[56:09] of God there was a portion of God that
[56:11] was revealed to them that they
[56:13] experienced but yet he hadn't given them
[56:16] a heart to perceive and here he says nor
[56:19] my ways of this heart to perceive or to
[56:21] understand actually has to do with
[56:24] knowing God and knowing his ways and
[56:28] that's what they lacked and that's why
[56:30] they failed because the power of God had
[56:32] not been revealed to them when they came
[56:34] to Katie's Bardia now if we look over
[56:39] here in chapter 4 of Hebrews
[56:43] verse two for unto us was the gospel
[56:46] preached as well as on to them but the
[56:51] word preached did not profit them not
[56:54] being mixed with faith and I looked at
[56:58] word up one time it's the same word
[57:00] mixed means like married becoming one
[57:04] mixed mixed with faith and them that
[57:08] heard it so this heart to perceive what
[57:11] they lacked was faith or a revelation
[57:14] because this is all speaking of the same
[57:16] thing using a little different words but
[57:18] it's the same it's the same picture for
[57:22] we have the four we which have believed
[57:26] do enter into rest and they were just
[57:30] barrier hips
[57:31] Heavenly Father faced Lord we thank you
[57:35] for your mercies and graces mornings and
[57:39] through your people your children that's
[57:41] gathered themselves together
[57:44] and I ask that you'd bless each one
[57:46] that's come and you bless our gathering
[57:50] together may you bless the reading of
[57:54] your word and Lord as those that stood
[57:59] that day and the enemy was around about
[58:01] them far they laid their petition before
[58:05] you they declared your majesty in your
[58:09] power they declared their relationship
[58:13] to you as the seed of Abraham and then
[58:16] they stood and they said our eyes are
[58:20] upon you
[58:21] and Lord as they had said that and they
[58:24] stood waiting upon you then you inspired
[58:28] a man and you spoke to them and said the
[58:31] battle is not yours
[58:33] this is mine so father we gathered
[58:36] ourselves together this morning to
[58:38] worship you and to praise you and for
[58:41] the hearing of your word
[58:44] no father their eyes of our hearts are
[58:46] upon you this morning may you reveal
[58:50] yourself to each and every one of us and
[58:55] unfold yourself in the path and in the
[58:58] way that we're at the level of where
[59:01] we're at the corner where we're at the
[59:04] crossroads where we're at may you
[59:07] supplied to us the revelation
[59:12] Lord to take us through the trials that
[59:15] surround us the enemy that desires to
[59:18] destroy us for our eyes are upon you
[59:22] destroy ya so father we commit these
[59:25] things into thy hands that's the best as
[59:28] we can as your children and as human
[59:30] beings we take our hands off of this
[59:33] Lord and let you guide us this morning
[59:36] for a moment in time that may turn into
[59:39] eternity we ask in Jesus name Amen amen
[59:43] he may be seated so we're trying to
[59:48] follow this thought of prophecy
[59:49] preeminence imperfection and so we've
[59:53] we've just been looking at this aspect
[59:56] especially of prophecy David says you
[1:00:00] know in the Psalms 42 he said the god of
[1:00:02] my life
[1:00:04] he's talking about how he he thirsts for
[1:00:06] God and not for God but a living God and
[1:00:10] he was he was so thirsting for God and
[1:00:13] said I've been to church and I worship
[1:00:16] there at the house of God the temple and
[1:00:18] the yet there's tears in my eyes why
[1:00:21] because he longed for the presence of
[1:00:23] God and he identifies him in that Psalm
[1:00:26] as the psalm of our the god of my life
[1:00:30] and then the next Psalm he comes down
[1:00:32] and he declares the God of my strength
[1:00:36] he talked about the god of his strength
[1:00:38] so this morning we're looking for
[1:00:40] strength we're looking for Revelation we
[1:00:44] don't stand in the in our power but
[1:00:46] we're wanting to spend in the power of
[1:00:49] his might not not looking upon our
[1:00:52] strength before Goliath but looking to
[1:00:54] that God that has delivered us from the
[1:00:57] world that has called us out of this on
[1:01:00] for generation this generation of
[1:01:03] darkness and ignorance and he's called
[1:01:05] you into the kingdom of his son into the
[1:01:08] kingdom of light and now he has taken us
[1:01:11] from the power of darkness and set us
[1:01:14] into his kingdom and so as we were we're
[1:01:17] looking at prophecy being unfolded being
[1:01:21] revealed but too many they can walk in
[1:01:24] this
[1:01:24] prophecy and it can be made known to
[1:01:26] them they can realize the prophecy as we
[1:01:30] looked at Israel in a in two groups we
[1:01:33] had one one group of people and they
[1:01:35] they all come out together it was a
[1:01:37] mixed multitude we know and they they
[1:01:40] all was delivered from the enemy they
[1:01:43] all came out from under the blood they
[1:01:46] had all applied that blood over the
[1:01:48] lentil in the doorpost and all protec
[1:01:51] another of the lamb they'd come out
[1:01:54] together they was baptized on the Moses
[1:01:56] and and they they were affected by the
[1:02:00] prophecy being fulfilled they danced up
[1:02:02] and down but now it comes here to
[1:02:05] Deuteronomy and Deuteronomy I understand
[1:02:09] it means two laws but it doesn't mean
[1:02:11] two different covenants or two different
[1:02:13] laws but when God brought them out of
[1:02:16] Egypt and brought them to Mount Sinai he
[1:02:20] gave them his word Moses brought the Ten
[1:02:23] Commandments brought the law of Moses
[1:02:26] all of that was called the law the civil
[1:02:28] all the moral law all those things he
[1:02:32] gave him the commandments he set before
[1:02:34] them the way of life and the way of
[1:02:36] death the way of life obedience the way
[1:02:39] of death rejection so now he's come down
[1:02:42] there standing in the fields of Moab
[1:02:45] standing right there to Jordan getting
[1:02:47] ready to cross over now and they're
[1:02:50] going to go in and take possession
[1:02:51] adoption so they're there now right at
[1:02:55] at the final stage just before
[1:02:59] circumcision and Moses is speaking to
[1:03:02] them so the messenger that gave that
[1:03:04] that original word as we would not say
[1:03:08] on the day of Pentecost or back there in
[1:03:11] the book of Acts now he's given what he
[1:03:15] had given they're the same messenger
[1:03:18] what he gave to them at Mount Sinai now
[1:03:21] he's bringing it again so it's not two
[1:03:23] different laws but we find it's that
[1:03:25] original message being given to them by
[1:03:29] that messenger
[1:03:31] could we say that under the first and
[1:03:34] second pull we're getting that word that
[1:03:36] was brought on the day of Pentecost is
[1:03:38] actually being brought under that first
[1:03:41] and second pool and he's restoring back
[1:03:44] that which was lost down through the
[1:03:46] church ages because Paul said there has
[1:03:51] to come a falling away they're going to
[1:03:53] give heed to seducing spirits and and
[1:03:55] and doctrines of the devil expressly in
[1:03:59] the last days not just down because he
[1:04:03] cannot come until the man of sin be
[1:04:06] revealed the one that's caused us
[1:04:09] falling away so there has to be in the
[1:04:12] even time your largest shall restore all
[1:04:14] things so there had to come a message of
[1:04:16] restoration so as Moses now is standing
[1:04:21] there he's standing on the edge of a
[1:04:23] dispensational change because they've
[1:04:27] come out but they've got to go in so
[1:04:30] they come out they haven't gone in yet
[1:04:32] and so now he's restoring to them this
[1:04:36] generation that was born in the way they
[1:04:39] didn't have that Mount Sinai visitation
[1:04:44] or experience so now God has given them
[1:04:48] that same experience through Moses the
[1:04:50] same messenger is now the son of God now
[1:04:54] is still bringing this message in that
[1:04:57] dispensation but it's fixing to change
[1:05:01] from from Moses to Joshua it's fixing
[1:05:06] the change from the Son of God the Son
[1:05:08] of man because under the Son of God
[1:05:12] ministry he met the pillar of fire and
[1:05:16] the same pillar of fire he met they met
[1:05:21] but now Joshua doesn't meet them at
[1:05:23] pillar fire he meets a man the captain
[1:05:26] of the host so we're at a we're at a
[1:05:30] dispensational change Katie's bar dia
[1:05:35] there they they forfeited their rights
[1:05:38] not even seeing the enemy but being
[1:05:42] intimidated by fear and because that the
[1:05:46] arm of the Lord had not been revealed to
[1:05:48] them because they they had not
[1:05:51] recognized the Lord their God he doubt
[1:05:55] been recently seen the acts of him but
[1:05:58] Moses knew his ways and we know that
[1:06:01] Joshua and Caleb they also knew his ways
[1:06:04] because when it came and they looked at
[1:06:08] the same challenge of the hour they had
[1:06:11] the strength to face the challenge of
[1:06:13] the enemy just as David's stood there
[1:06:17] and face the challenge of Goliath why
[1:06:20] not his ability but his eyes was looking
[1:06:24] away to Jesus he was looking to God
[1:06:27] because he had had an experience with
[1:06:29] him and while he was in the wilderness
[1:06:32] backer keeping the Sheep the mighty God
[1:06:36] unveiled himself to David and David knew
[1:06:39] his ways but salt knew his acts to whom
[1:06:46] is the arm of the Lord revealed to them
[1:06:49] that's heard the report and believed the
[1:06:51] report and to them it opens up the
[1:06:54] avenue and channel of Revelation to
[1:06:57] recognize prophecy being fulfilled and
[1:07:01] because that prophecy has been fulfilled
[1:07:03] and they've been given a heart to
[1:07:05] believe or perceiver to understand when
[1:07:08] they come to Katie's Barnea the word has
[1:07:11] a preeminence in her heart because they
[1:07:15] said the defense the the enemy's defense
[1:07:19] is gone from them God has given us the
[1:07:22] land so they had come to actually that
[1:07:25] the word had a preeminence and they came
[1:07:28] to perfection and perfect faith
[1:07:31] yeah man tries to bring these things but
[1:07:37] you can't do that God has to do that and
[1:07:43] the time that God speaks like on the
[1:07:47] telephone there's a preconceived
[1:07:50] theology that takes place but man must
[1:07:54] wait on God to reveal his word and to
[1:07:57] interpret it and unfold it so then then
[1:08:04] Jesus he speaking to Peter
[1:08:06] he says it's coming to time Peter you
[1:08:10] won't be able to go where where do you
[1:08:11] want to go but there's going to be a man
[1:08:14] he's gonna come and he's gonna bind you
[1:08:17] speaking of his death and he says well
[1:08:23] what about him the one that laid his
[1:08:26] head on your bosom what what about him
[1:08:28] what's gonna happen in the world what is
[1:08:30] it chief
[1:08:31] he should tarry till I come and all of a
[1:08:35] sudden they heard the voice and they
[1:08:38] built a body around that voice they they
[1:08:42] heard the prophecy they heard the word
[1:08:44] of God and they said how'd you hear what
[1:08:47] he said he ain't gonna die Ethan I
[1:08:50] didn't say that they said that so we
[1:08:54] find that when God speaks many times
[1:08:57] behold a virgin shall conceive many
[1:09:00] heard that they they had preconceived
[1:09:03] theology but preconceived as something
[1:09:07] that you concede before it actually
[1:09:10] comes to pass or it's revealed and they
[1:09:16] had some certain preconceived ideas but
[1:09:18] when they came to Kadish Bardia they
[1:09:21] knew the acts of God but they didn't
[1:09:23] know them the way of God and it says
[1:09:25] they did err in her heart and that means
[1:09:28] go astray in other words to go astray
[1:09:30] means you no longer following the
[1:09:33] leadership you go astray you go back in
[1:09:36] the edge if you go back into the
[1:09:38] denomination's you err in your heart you
[1:09:41] go astray what caused them to go astray
[1:09:44] because in their hearts they didn't know
[1:09:47] his way they knew the acts of God but
[1:09:49] not his wife many people in this message
[1:09:52] they know the acts of God they loved the
[1:09:54] Prophet they many things but now they're
[1:09:57] going into error because why they're
[1:09:59] going astray because the power God has
[1:10:03] not been revealed here he's coming to
[1:10:06] the seals he's coming to he's stepping
[1:10:09] into his ministry there's a there's a
[1:10:11] changing of dispensations from son of
[1:10:14] God the Son of Man why because the son
[1:10:18] of God has come to what I believe was
[1:10:21] the capstone of the Son of God ministry
[1:10:23] which was which was a the maasai excite
[1:10:29] amongst them Messiah kind didn't call
[1:10:32] the bride but it brought both all that
[1:10:36] those ages of gifts of the Spirit and
[1:10:39] prophecy now the giver of the gift had
[1:10:43] come not brother Branham but Christ and
[1:10:47] the Messiah kind revealing the secrets
[1:10:50] of the heart so to me I see the capstone
[1:10:53] other of the restoration of the word and
[1:10:56] the Holy Spirit
[1:10:57] unveiling himself in a way that he'd
[1:11:00] never unveiled himself before since the
[1:11:03] days of Jesus Christ but it had to come
[1:11:06] a sign to the Gentiles because they
[1:11:08] never had that sign but it didn't call a
[1:11:11] bride it caught her attention but those
[1:11:14] are the things that many people major on
[1:11:17] sign in the hand the Messiah time to
[1:11:21] know the secrets of the heart but when
[1:11:24] it came to that there was a rejection a
[1:11:28] rejection of the unveiling of God in
[1:11:32] that day the stumbling stone it wasn't
[1:11:36] really the doctrine it was the unveiling
[1:11:38] of prophecy they stumbled at the stone
[1:11:42] but to us it was a precious stone they
[1:11:46] rejected the word
[1:11:48] what did it say in the beginning was the
[1:11:51] word and word was with god and it came
[1:11:54] as a light to lighten all man send thy
[1:11:58] light and truth to give me strength to
[1:12:01] lead me tonight Tabernacle that I might
[1:12:06] worship you in truth and spirit give me
[1:12:10] a heart to perceive because we can know
[1:12:15] as acts and we can draw benefits from it
[1:12:20] we can change the way we act and dress
[1:12:24] but the center of that must be the life
[1:12:27] of Christ and you and me and when they
[1:12:33] come to cater smarty attend and go
[1:12:35] astray but that was really a mental
[1:12:38] battle they never physically met the
[1:12:43] enemy they were only told about the
[1:12:45] enemy and so they began to draw a
[1:12:49] picture of these enemies well we're like
[1:12:51] grasshoppers oh my they started in their
[1:12:53] imagination there they were probably
[1:12:55] bigger than they really were they
[1:12:58] thought about that little grasshopper
[1:12:59] and I thought mine these men must be
[1:13:01] like mountains but they couldn't trust
[1:13:04] God you know there's a lot of people
[1:13:08] that came right up to this message so
[1:13:10] you got to be rebaptised in the name of
[1:13:12] Jesus Christ but they said well I was
[1:13:16] already baptized and Father Son and Holy
[1:13:18] Ghost and I was thinking about Jesus
[1:13:20] when I went in the water
[1:13:22] are you new women you know you ever done
[1:13:24] anything wrong before you married your
[1:13:28] husband and and you didn't tell him you
[1:13:30] got to confess that you know there was a
[1:13:35] lot of things and and they they couldn't
[1:13:38] face those giants it was too much for
[1:13:42] him like the rich ruler but now here
[1:13:44] they was they was actually that
[1:13:46] generation died off a new generation is
[1:13:48] born and they're fixing the cross Jordan
[1:13:51] into the adoption and here's Moses now
[1:13:54] delivering again rehearse and rehearse
[1:13:56] in the church ages all the things
[1:13:58] they've been through and rehearsing the
[1:14:01] promise that perfect
[1:14:02] step into so here they are standing
[1:14:06] right now Jordan well how did the enemy
[1:14:07] meet him Baylin thousand fell the world
[1:14:15] in this church natural oh we believe the
[1:14:19] same message come on over let's watch
[1:14:21] the movies on TV and I had any nothing
[1:14:24] wrong going a little swimming and
[1:14:26] bathing your knowing it who likes to go
[1:14:28] on your clothes let's just really get in
[1:14:30] the spirit of this swimming let's put on
[1:14:32] our swimsuits oh you men you know
[1:14:35] there's nothing wrong wearing these
[1:14:37] shorts you know the army wears shorts by
[1:14:40] these ain't no women's underneath
[1:14:42] clothes they got over there to debayle
[1:14:46] yard anything and those women those
[1:14:50] false doctrines those harlots
[1:14:55] they entice them and they fell he said
[1:14:59] the major sin of the day the major sin
[1:15:05] were leanness what did we see creeping
[1:15:09] in other churches now let's not only
[1:15:12] been in this message than 73 I don't
[1:15:17] understand what's taking place the
[1:15:20] fashions of the world are coming in is
[1:15:24] everything sensuality is coming back in
[1:15:29] men masculinity I just I don't like to
[1:15:33] go into it just leave it alone
[1:15:38] people are going astray they don't
[1:15:44] believe in holiness and holiness don't
[1:15:46] get you to heaven that's what the
[1:15:48] Pentecostal Holiness thought long
[1:15:50] sleeves long dresses cover everything up
[1:15:53] well that's what they did
[1:15:54] they covered everything up they covered
[1:15:56] the evil spirits up temper to fight like
[1:16:02] a buzz on gossip and oh I outside they
[1:16:06] look good remind me of others AIDS virus
[1:16:10] you know the bird flu it are this bird
[1:16:14] virus it it attacks the respiratory
[1:16:18] system and and the word said he breathed
[1:16:23] into them and they became a living soul
[1:16:28] so it takes the breath of life what is
[1:16:30] that it it's the inspiration but but
[1:16:35] what does the AIDS virus do it attacks
[1:16:37] the immune system and in the body what
[1:16:41] is it it's a it's the white blood cells
[1:16:43] that's your immune system and they say
[1:16:46] that this virus is a highly intelligent
[1:16:48] virus
[1:16:49] remember that virus belongs to the
[1:16:52] kingdom of Satan and I find there's
[1:16:56] there's much of a parallel between the
[1:16:59] way he works in the religious room as he
[1:17:01] works in the in the physical rim through
[1:17:04] infectious diseases
[1:17:07] and so this this AIDS virus from what I
[1:17:10] understand that it attacks the white
[1:17:13] blood cell now it just don't gather
[1:17:20] around it and destroy it it infiltrates
[1:17:25] it like an osmosis it it actually places
[1:17:30] its life in the white blood cell and it
[1:17:34] destroys it from the inside 300 years of
[1:17:39] persecution of the church and they grew
[1:17:43] stronger they went down in catacombs and
[1:17:46] they hid and they were killing them they
[1:17:49] were hiding him down but it kept the
[1:17:51] church pure because to be a believer you
[1:17:56] had to be rugged knows days but then
[1:18:01] chant but then Satan changes in morphe
[1:18:05] he became the champion of Christianity
[1:18:08] Constantine and what he couldn't do
[1:18:12] under under 300 years of persecution and
[1:18:15] trying to trying to kill a church now he
[1:18:19] he injected his own life into that
[1:18:24] and he became the champion of
[1:18:26] Christianity became respected became the
[1:18:29] national religion in just a few years he
[1:18:34] destroyed it through worldliness and
[1:18:35] paganism and it evolved into the great
[1:18:39] Catholic Church and so they say that the
[1:18:45] throne I understand that this this AIDS
[1:18:48] virus is white blood cells it's actually
[1:18:51] got two divisions you have a command
[1:18:55] center in your white blood cells and
[1:18:58] then you have the soldiers in the white
[1:19:00] blood cells now this memory system of
[1:19:05] the white blood cells it has a longer
[1:19:08] longevity it it it lasts longer it lives
[1:19:11] longer and it's the part of the white
[1:19:14] blood cells that remembers things it
[1:19:17] remembers the infections it discerns
[1:19:20] that when there's an enemy comes into
[1:19:22] the body and so then it it has a way to
[1:19:25] the intelligence of our body and through
[1:19:28] our immune system it sends it out it
[1:19:31] sends the soldiers out and you get a
[1:19:33] little infection and all that pus and
[1:19:35] all that it's those white blood cells
[1:19:37] giving their life and they're fighting
[1:19:39] that that that infection and so they
[1:19:43] were trying to find the control center
[1:19:47] of this of this this viruses AIDS virus
[1:19:51] and you know where it hit itself right
[1:19:54] in the memory system and they couldn't
[1:19:57] attack that memory system with with the
[1:20:02] they couldn't kill it because if they
[1:20:04] killed it they would kill a new system
[1:20:10] and what kills that person is because
[1:20:13] that the immune system is neutralized
[1:20:17] then they can be killed by just common
[1:20:20] diseases that our body normally that are
[1:20:23] normally rejects but there's another
[1:20:26] thing they said that what what the
[1:20:30] medical community was was concerned
[1:20:32] about is that these people with the AIDS
[1:20:35] virus because they didn't have a on a
[1:20:38] new system they became a betting ground
[1:20:42] for new diseases and so they were a
[1:20:46] betting ground for diseases that would
[1:20:47] come out and attack the normal person
[1:20:52] and that disease that the body didn't
[1:20:56] have an immune system to that disease
[1:20:59] but if something new like polygamy and
[1:21:04] did in return ministry and get on
[1:21:09] talking about so you used to be able to
[1:21:13] walk through those through those
[1:21:16] communities and people look like zombies
[1:21:18] you could tell he's got a virus yeah
[1:21:22] stay away from him but then they come up
[1:21:27] with this antidote it didn't heal him it
[1:21:30] would it only had a way of putting this
[1:21:32] AIDS virus kinda in in remission so you
[1:21:37] could take this this whatever it was is
[1:21:39] concoction and you know what after a few
[1:21:44] years you could walk into these
[1:21:45] communities and they look just as
[1:21:47] healthy as you and me women didn't cut
[1:21:50] their hair I mean didn't wear shorts why
[1:21:53] because they knew then they didn't go
[1:21:57] down and playing golf in their little
[1:21:59] shorts and things and and they didn't go
[1:22:02] out here mix bathing why because they
[1:22:05] highly intelligent you know but yet on
[1:22:09] the inside there was spirits of adultery
[1:22:13] fornication they they looked fine but
[1:22:18] now they said that because they look
[1:22:21] fine and they felt good
[1:22:23] you know you can be running a fever and
[1:22:25] feeling just all kind of achy all over
[1:22:27] and take about two or three aspirin or
[1:22:31] Advil whatever you take and the symptoms
[1:22:34] go away and you feel fine you go hug
[1:22:37] your brother and you're all drinking out
[1:22:38] think up but you need well yeah you feel
[1:22:44] good and so the AIDS virus has spread in
[1:22:46] three times faster than what it was and
[1:22:51] the AIDS virus starting a community of
[1:22:53] homosexuals and now we've legalized this
[1:22:59] and so they say that that now that we're
[1:23:03] standing on the edge of the pre
[1:23:05] penicillin age there are so many
[1:23:08] antibiotics I don't know what is I just
[1:23:09] pick a number I'll just say twelve
[1:23:11] twelve no more worship but I'll just say
[1:23:13] twelve and so with each passing age that
[1:23:18] there's a war taking place between
[1:23:20] infectious diseases and antibiotics
[1:23:24] there's a war taking place and they say
[1:23:27] each time that this this this disease or
[1:23:30] whatever it is
[1:23:31] overcomes it's antibiotic then they pass
[1:23:34] it on somehow genetically to the next
[1:23:36] virus and now that these antibiotics
[1:23:38] don't have an effect and and so we're
[1:23:43] coming to the place now that we're we're
[1:23:45] to the last two or three antibiotics and
[1:23:48] once and once that that last antibiotic
[1:23:51] is rendered neutral as far as being able
[1:23:54] to take care of these these sicknesses
[1:23:57] then we're back into pre penicillin age
[1:23:59] in other words would be back where it
[1:24:02] was before God allowed man to break into
[1:24:05] his laboratory of healing and discovered
[1:24:08] by accident penicillin
[1:24:15] and so now we've come to the end of the
[1:24:18] age and Satan the Antichrist the man of
[1:24:24] sin has been attacking our immune system
[1:24:28] and our immune system is the Holy Spirit
[1:24:32] and the Word of God and the control
[1:24:35] center is the fivefold ministry that
[1:24:40] keep us from going into amnesia and
[1:24:42] forgetting who the enemy is so he is
[1:24:46] infiltrated the pulpit to neutralize the
[1:24:50] church so God is sent an antibiotic the
[1:24:58] Lord himself shall descend with a
[1:25:00] challenge and if this antibiotic is
[1:25:03] rejected you're back in the pre gospel
[1:25:09] age no more salvation no more redemption
[1:25:14] for the Gentiles
[1:25:23] we're really at the end of civilization
[1:25:25] in time and we can see the effects of
[1:25:29] this upon the people spiritually that
[1:25:33] once the whole world knew that all the
[1:25:36] Christian world knew that that Rome was
[1:25:39] the great [ __ ]
[1:25:41] you never heard him preach too much on
[1:25:43] the on the daughters we hear a lot of
[1:25:46] people preaching about the great [ __ ]
[1:25:48] Luther about the great [ __ ] but Luther
[1:25:51] never talked about daughters but we not
[1:25:55] only talk about the great [ __ ] we talk
[1:25:57] about daughters because we know who they
[1:25:59] are so now we find that the problem was
[1:26:09] was in their heart and David after he
[1:26:12] had been with Bathsheba and Nathan met
[1:26:15] him and his sin was exposed he knew it
[1:26:20] was there it's kind of like the man that
[1:26:22] brother Brandon was talking to was
[1:26:23] homosexual he was going to kill himself
[1:26:25] you remember the story brother Bisco
[1:26:27] tells it on this on his own witness that
[1:26:31] that boy no he was a homosexual he had a
[1:26:33] wife he had he had children but he was
[1:26:37] in such a disparity that he he despised
[1:26:40] and yet it was something couldn't get it
[1:26:41] was a spirit that had gone with him and
[1:26:44] he could not get delivered from that
[1:26:46] spirit he was subject to that thing and
[1:26:49] yet he hated it like drugs or alcohol or
[1:26:52] whatever and he had a wife that he loved
[1:26:55] and his children that he loved or else
[1:26:57] he wouldn't been thinking about taking
[1:26:59] his own life
[1:27:01] and there was that profit just to preach
[1:27:04] in the way and he stops he said soldier
[1:27:06] boy cries out to them what happens that
[1:27:10] friend of his he catches him right on
[1:27:12] the edge of the wilderness just a few
[1:27:16] minutes later he had been gone out there
[1:27:18] and they wouldn't have known where he
[1:27:19] was they couldn't track him they didn't
[1:27:24] have the GPS a little smartphone right
[1:27:27] but there was somebody else it was
[1:27:30] leading them that arranged a time like
[1:27:33] the woman at the well it takes him out
[1:27:36] to him the walk takes his hat off
[1:27:37] presence of the Lord tells him what's
[1:27:40] wrong with him prayed for him he comes
[1:27:41] back he said I'm free he's a saint
[1:27:47] I might not be able to take you down but
[1:27:51] he can take you down this morning and he
[1:27:54] can talk to you and you can be free he
[1:27:58] won't tell you something you don't
[1:27:59] already know but with that he'll bring
[1:28:02] with the exposure he'll bring
[1:28:04] deliverance and so Davidson was exposed
[1:28:09] and he wanted to serve God but you knew
[1:28:13] he knew that the problem laid down in
[1:28:16] his heart he was a man after God's own
[1:28:19] heart not something was there he said
[1:28:21] create in me a clean heart for as a man
[1:28:26] thinketh in his heart so is he out of
[1:28:29] the heart comes the issues of life he
[1:28:31] said create in me a clean heart restore
[1:28:36] unto me the joy of my salvation see when
[1:28:40] man gets caught in sin it needs to go
[1:28:43] down to the heart and only the word can
[1:28:45] go to the heart and it can clean that
[1:28:50] heart if you allow them to come in and
[1:28:53] invite his presence the love of the
[1:28:55] truth and let him clean you
[1:29:01] now I want to start over again over here
[1:29:05] in Matthew 24 and we're trying to
[1:29:10] remember what we've been bringing coming
[1:29:13] through and Matthew 24 one through three
[1:29:17] and we'll just take this as far as we
[1:29:28] can and then we'll just we'll just we'll
[1:29:31] just put it on pause and then God sent
[1:29:35] another ministries raise up your pastor
[1:29:39] brother lush and the journal he can he
[1:29:43] can just it's the Holy Ghost that's his
[1:29:44] message it's not money so if anything is
[1:29:48] incomplete he's the one that's going to
[1:29:50] complete it Matthew 24 in the first
[1:29:54] three verses and Jesus went out and
[1:29:56] departed from the temple and his
[1:30:00] disciples came to him for to show him
[1:30:03] the buildings of the temple and jesus
[1:30:06] said unto them see and not all these
[1:30:08] things verily I say unto you there shall
[1:30:11] not be left here one stone upon another
[1:30:14] that shall not be thrown down and as he
[1:30:20] sat upon the Mount of Olives the
[1:30:23] disciples came unto him privately saying
[1:30:25] tell us when shall these things be and
[1:30:29] what shall be the sign of thy coming and
[1:30:32] of the end of the world so now I want to
[1:30:38] drop down to verse 36
[1:30:44] but of that day and hour no man no not
[1:30:54] the angels of heaven but my father only
[1:31:02] so no man knows he said he himself
[1:31:05] didn't know and the angels in heaven
[1:31:08] didn't know but only his father so this
[1:31:12] was a this was a secret this was a
[1:31:15] mystery that God held within himself it
[1:31:23] was a mystery
[1:31:24] he wasn't Jesus's mystery it wasn't the
[1:31:28] Angels mystery it was God's mystery the
[1:31:32] mystery of the time when he would return
[1:31:37] his return is not a mystery the rapture
[1:31:42] is not a mystery the Second Coming is
[1:31:45] not a mystery the time is a mystery it
[1:31:52] was not a mystery that Israel was going
[1:31:56] to go in captivity 400 years and it
[1:32:02] wasn't because of the chronology of time
[1:32:04] and what God had given out it wasn't as
[1:32:06] much of a mystery as Wynand he was going
[1:32:09] to come but then living for hundred
[1:32:13] years you know 400 years is a long time
[1:32:16] it don't sound like much in the Bible
[1:32:19] when we think about a thousand years two
[1:32:21] thousand six thousand we think four
[1:32:23] hundred years but the United States has
[1:32:25] been a nation just a little over two
[1:32:27] hundred years and you look at our grass
[1:32:31] roots when we started look at the women
[1:32:33] where we started look at the churches
[1:32:35] where we started look at the faith where
[1:32:38] we started
[1:32:38] look at the patriarchs the father's when
[1:32:41] we started now look at it can you
[1:32:45] imagine the condition of 400 years when
[1:32:47] America would look like if it would go
[1:32:49] that long
[1:32:53] look at look at denominations Baptist
[1:32:57] Pentecostal look how they've evolved in
[1:33:00] just just a few years not even a hundred
[1:33:03] years they don't even hold the same
[1:33:06] image they had when they started
[1:33:07] corrupted infiltrated by Satan you said
[1:33:13] they've infiltrated us ministers crept
[1:33:17] in other words infiltrated to get inside
[1:33:23] to kill it from the inside
[1:33:25] - to destroy us when man was telling me
[1:33:31] about a article he read about that and
[1:33:32] he said science calls the AIDS virus a
[1:33:35] beautiful virus he's a beautiful well
[1:33:38] it's beautiful because of its
[1:33:39] intelligence and the way that it
[1:33:41] operates not because it does good things
[1:33:43] that great [ __ ] was beautiful
[1:33:46] john looked at her and wondered hee hee
[1:33:50] hee my what a beautiful thing and he
[1:33:56] said they put that aids virus on a slide
[1:33:58] with an antibiotic and and what I
[1:34:02] understand what he told me was that that
[1:34:05] AIDS virus didn't attack that antibiotic
[1:34:08] it surrounded it and it studied it and
[1:34:14] when it studied it it attacked it and
[1:34:16] neutralized it oh you say that men can't
[1:34:20] wear shorts hmm and well I see right
[1:34:24] here it's it's just in your heart too
[1:34:26] what counts this isn't women underwear
[1:34:28] he didn't already with Tomba you say
[1:34:31] it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair
[1:34:32] oh but it gives you headaches don't it
[1:34:35] and then right here it says in this word
[1:34:39] it says it's a value it's not your hair
[1:34:43] you know they study it serpent seed I
[1:34:46] don't know
[1:34:48] and they circle it and they study it and
[1:34:50] then they inject her preconceived see
[1:34:53] ology the doctrine of the devil and they
[1:34:56] neutralize it is that I don't know if
[1:34:59] they do that
[1:35:00] Jesus said because that you've taught
[1:35:03] the commandments of men for the
[1:35:05] commandments of God and the tradition of
[1:35:07] man as the Word of God you neutralized
[1:35:10] the effect of the word you made the word
[1:35:14] not affect they didn't do away with the
[1:35:17] word they neutralized the effect of the
[1:35:20] gospel because they didn't have the
[1:35:24] right prescription to put the antidote
[1:35:27] together that would kill it the disease
[1:35:30] they said well I think that's just a
[1:35:32] little bit too much of that that's not
[1:35:33] that you know sometimes when you cook
[1:35:36] there's a recipe but a real cook they
[1:35:38] just I just picture this and adapt of
[1:35:41] that and a handful of this well can you
[1:35:43] give us a recipe oh yeah
[1:35:45] two pinches of this and one dab of that
[1:35:47] and throw in a little bit of this and
[1:35:51] but you can't do that with God's Word
[1:35:55] you can't throw in a pinch of this and a
[1:35:57] dab of that and come to this and stir it
[1:36:00] up and it's gonna come out gods god of
[1:36:03] water he's a got a precision and st.
[1:36:09] wants to neutralize that word so now we
[1:36:12] have
[1:36:14] Christ speaking of his coming because I
[1:36:17] say tell us when these things shall be
[1:36:20] what shall be the sign of thy coming so
[1:36:25] somehow they knew that there was a
[1:36:26] coming somewhere along the line they
[1:36:30] knew that there was a coming he says I
[1:36:33] don't know he gave him the sign for the
[1:36:39] parable of the fig tree but he said I
[1:36:41] don't know the day or the hour he said
[1:36:44] the angels in heaven don't know only my
[1:36:46] father all right st. John 14 we're just
[1:36:50] going to read some really familiar
[1:36:54] Scripture with you in st. John 14 and
[1:36:59] first three verses let not your heart be
[1:37:02] troubled he believed in God believe also
[1:37:04] in me in my father's house are many
[1:37:07] mansions if it were not saw I would not
[1:37:10] I would have if it were not so I would
[1:37:14] have told you I go to prepare a place
[1:37:16] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[1:37:20] for you I will come again and receive
[1:37:23] you unto myself and where I am there may
[1:37:28] you be also so now the church has been
[1:37:32] looking from the day of Pentecost has
[1:37:36] been looking for Christ to return in
[1:37:39] what we call the rapture or the
[1:37:42] resurrection and the change of the body
[1:37:45] and rising to meet him in the air this
[1:37:48] is not a mystery to most of the church
[1:37:50] there's part of Christianity that denies
[1:37:52] this what they call prima Linnaeus and
[1:37:55] Postman Linnaeus and all this other kind
[1:37:58] of stuff and and so they've been waiting
[1:38:03] for his return Peter speaks of it
[1:38:07] Paul speaks of it they're looking for
[1:38:10] the return so now I can't come until
[1:38:13] after the falling away and this and this
[1:38:16] virus this man has since been exposed to
[1:38:19] nickel ad and Antichrist spirit this
[1:38:23] this horseman that went down with
[1:38:24] identity until until the fourth fourth
[1:38:28] seal and then he was identified and his
[1:38:31] name was called out his name was death
[1:38:33] and hell followed him he was identified
[1:38:37] same man but he didn't have an identity
[1:38:40] until the last seal of the four seals
[1:38:43] the church age so he says I go to
[1:38:50] prepare a place for you and I'll come
[1:38:51] again
[1:38:52] so I understand there's a I forget what
[1:38:55] church it is what denomination it is but
[1:38:58] they believe that on the day of
[1:38:59] Pentecost that's when he when he came
[1:39:01] back you know there was many comings of
[1:39:04] Christ Christ came to Paul there's many
[1:39:09] comings of Christ but this coming he
[1:39:12] says I'm gonna come and receive you unto
[1:39:14] myself he didn't do that when he come to
[1:39:17] to Paul he didn't do that on the day of
[1:39:19] Pentecost so we're looking for the time
[1:39:22] that he comes to receive us onto himself
[1:39:24] and we meet him in the air that corporal
[1:39:28] body won't touch the earth but we'll
[1:39:31] meet him in the air
[1:39:34] so we've been looking for that the
[1:39:37] Ezreal was looking for God to deliver
[1:39:39] them with a mighty hand they were
[1:39:43] waiting for that prophecy to be
[1:39:45] fulfilled here come Moses here come
[1:39:49] Aaron signs and wonders vindicated the
[1:39:52] message they were said of God to deliver
[1:39:55] them but you know in their preconceived
[1:39:58] ideas that didn't happen just as lexing
[1:40:00] like they thought it would second
[1:40:02] service they didn't even hear him they
[1:40:04] wouldn't even listen to him why because
[1:40:07] there was so much going on in their
[1:40:08] lives they were so distracted by the
[1:40:12] taskmasters and the burden of the of the
[1:40:14] bricks they became impatient with the
[1:40:17] ministry and you know and Jesus said all
[1:40:22] when he tarries there's going to be
[1:40:23] those they're gonna start beating people
[1:40:25] and just you know but in patience you
[1:40:30] possess your soul and you can't have
[1:40:32] that kind of patience unless you know
[1:40:34] God's Way so now we find that he's
[1:40:41] coming again that's what the church has
[1:40:43] been waiting on let's go to Romans 8 I
[1:40:46] just want to read these just kind of
[1:40:49] because we want to say something here
[1:40:52] but we've got to simply say sometimes
[1:40:54] get all on the same page we just want to
[1:40:56] get a flow of something here and we pray
[1:41:00] it's just a continuation of what we
[1:41:01] started Friday with the basic that we've
[1:41:05] got to we've we've got to have the
[1:41:10] inspiration to give us a heart to
[1:41:13] understand that we might the power of
[1:41:15] God would be revealed to us more than
[1:41:18] just a Pentecostal way Romans 8 chapter
[1:41:23] 16 I mean verse 16 the spirit itself
[1:41:26] bears witness unto our spirit that we
[1:41:29] are the children of God and if the
[1:41:31] children then heirs of God and
[1:41:34] joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we
[1:41:38] suffer with him that we may also be
[1:41:40] glorified
[1:41:41] first comes humility and then comes
[1:41:44] exaltation so sir first comes
[1:41:48] offering an in glorification so we're
[1:41:51] not waiting for the sons of God to come
[1:41:53] the sons of God have already been here
[1:41:58] John says now are we the sons of God
[1:42:01] Paul says now are we the children of God
[1:42:04] but we're waiting for something we're
[1:42:05] waiting for our inheritance verse 19 for
[1:42:10] the expec for the earnest expectation of
[1:42:13] the creature waiteth for the
[1:42:14] manifestation of the sons of god
[1:42:16] so all creation is waiting for this
[1:42:20] unveiling of the sons of God they're not
[1:42:23] waiting for the sons of God we're
[1:42:25] waiting for the unveiling or the
[1:42:27] manifestation of the sons of God verse
[1:42:31] 22 for we know that the whole creation
[1:42:35] groaneth and travaileth in pain birth
[1:42:40] pains together until now why why are
[1:42:45] they waiting for the manifestation of
[1:42:47] the sons of God that would you told us
[1:42:49] verse 23 and not only and not only they
[1:42:54] but ourselves also I just want more of
[1:42:58] the Holy Ghost I just feel me every
[1:43:00] fiber I want to walk closer to you
[1:43:02] groaning and travailing what is it it's
[1:43:05] the soul calling for revelation
[1:43:08] inspiration not information not
[1:43:11] knowledge it comes through the womb
[1:43:13] first it's got to come through the womb
[1:43:15] but the conception takes but the life
[1:43:18] takes place down in the heart the soul
[1:43:22] who has believed our report who has
[1:43:26] accepted it into the womb of the mind
[1:43:29] to whom is the arm of the Lord been
[1:43:31] revealed as inspiration struck that is
[1:43:35] it a concede life down here or is it
[1:43:40] only in the womb and then rejected
[1:43:44] because this is a female ovulate since
[1:43:48] she's not with a male what is it then
[1:43:50] her body rejects that but if there's a
[1:43:53] conception there's no rejection you
[1:43:57] understand what I'm talking about
[1:44:00] and then in that rejection because
[1:44:03] there's no conception before that she
[1:44:06] can enter into the congregation's you
[1:44:08] have to go for purification
[1:44:09] Chindi nothing wrong but if life takes
[1:44:14] place and no rejection she enters into
[1:44:18] the congregation
[1:44:29] verse 23
[1:44:31] not only that but ourselves also which
[1:44:36] have the firstfruits
[1:44:38] of the spirit even even we ourselves
[1:44:42] groan within ourselves waiting for the
[1:44:47] adoption now what are they waiting for
[1:44:50] the manifestation the unveiling the
[1:44:54] revealing of the sons of God in other
[1:44:57] words they are already here but they
[1:45:00] haven't come to the fullness of the
[1:45:02] expression of God creation because only
[1:45:07] God can create and it's only given to
[1:45:09] his children to create Satan would like
[1:45:12] to create
[1:45:12] if Satan could create there never would
[1:45:15] have been a Serpent's Eden but because
[1:45:19] he did not have the power of creation he
[1:45:22] used the power of injection
[1:45:27] that he can inject his own life as God
[1:45:31] was going to do he wanted to have a son
[1:45:38] and how about having a Sun God injected
[1:45:40] his own life into the human race this
[1:45:43] morning
[1:45:44] and Satan wanted to do the same thing
[1:45:47] and he had to have a soul because God
[1:45:52] injects himself into the human race by
[1:45:55] the new birth in that soul Satan he
[1:45:59] didn't want a dog he didn't want the
[1:46:01] serpent he wanted a human soul that he
[1:46:04] could put his life into but he could not
[1:46:08] unite with those souls it was in the
[1:46:11] Lamb's Book of Life from the foundation
[1:46:13] of the world that's why some people can
[1:46:17] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:19] every day of their life even on their
[1:46:21] soul but if there's nothing there to
[1:46:24] quicken
[1:46:27] he said only in the seed can be
[1:46:30] quickened that's why when you was out in
[1:46:35] the trinitarian organizations and and
[1:46:38] out in the world no matter how much st.
[1:46:40] Ninoy did that soul it could not bring
[1:46:42] life but when the Holy Spirit came and
[1:46:45] anointed it there was a conception and
[1:46:48] God seal the wound but I'll tell you it
[1:46:52] was sealed before that because it's God
[1:46:54] protected sir he protected you he placed
[1:46:58] the law in you that no seed could
[1:47:02] penetrate that soul but his own and he
[1:47:07] put an entity between the woman and the
[1:47:10] serpent no longer will that seed mix
[1:47:15] because st. now had an open door the
[1:47:24] manifestation of the sons of God and we
[1:47:27] groan and travail as all the creation
[1:47:30] were waiting for the manifestation of
[1:47:32] the sons of God were waiting for the
[1:47:34] adoption to include the change of the
[1:47:37] body that's what we're waiting for and
[1:47:43] we know that comes after resurrection
[1:47:45] and the translation now let's go a
[1:47:51] little further Ephesians 1
[1:47:58] now we're talking about prophecy not
[1:48:02] what Israel's looking for but what but
[1:48:05] what the bride is looking for seasons 1
[1:48:10] verse 13 and 14 in whom also in whom ye
[1:48:17] also trusted after that you heard the
[1:48:21] truth the gospel of your salvation in
[1:48:26] whom also after that she believed you
[1:48:30] know the gospel is a pretty simple thing
[1:48:35] it's received it's rejected but did you
[1:48:42] know that the scripture says that the
[1:48:44] gospel is the power of God unto
[1:48:47] salvation
[1:48:49] to them that believe not everybody faith
[1:48:55] cometh by the hearing of the word but
[1:48:57] not everybody that hears the word has
[1:48:59] faith and the gospel doesn't save
[1:49:02] everybody that hears it but him that
[1:49:05] it's inspired by God that has a heart to
[1:49:07] perceive and grabbed a hold of it it
[1:49:09] becomes the power of God unto salvation
[1:49:17] he were sealed with that holy spirit of
[1:49:22] promise because it first fruits and here
[1:49:26] he calls it the earnest of the promise
[1:49:30] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:49:32] until the redemption of the purchased
[1:49:36] possession onto the praise of his glory
[1:49:38] so now we're sealed onto a to a goal a
[1:49:42] capstone we're sealing to a destiny
[1:49:47] until we come and receive our
[1:49:50] inheritance
[1:49:52] that's reserved for us in heaven it's
[1:49:55] incorruptible and where the thief can't
[1:49:57] come in it was it was through faith that
[1:50:05] it might be by grace God chose the
[1:50:08] avenue of faith that it could be by
[1:50:12] grace you're saved by grace and through
[1:50:15] faith but he said it was through faith
[1:50:17] that it could be by grace in other words
[1:50:20] it's the sovereignty of God to reveal
[1:50:23] whom to ever so he will he'll give a
[1:50:26] heart to perceive to whoever so he will
[1:50:28] but how does he choose how'd he pick you
[1:50:31] how'd he take you why didn't he take
[1:50:33] that one well it's just the way the
[1:50:35] Bible was spun and the way it ended up
[1:50:37] nor wasn't you were in him he's one of
[1:50:41] the foundation of the world his children
[1:50:44] he knew they'd be stolen and so he
[1:50:46] provided Redemption and he put you in
[1:50:48] that book of redemption and he
[1:50:52] predestinated you to make sure that you
[1:50:56] received your inheritance he didn't
[1:50:59] leave it to a lawyer he didn't leave it
[1:51:01] to a preacher he hauls it in himself
[1:51:04] that you are predestinated to receive
[1:51:08] your inheritance verse or chapter 4
[1:51:21] verse 30
[1:51:24] grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:51:26] whereby you're sealed unto the day of
[1:51:30] your redemption we now are redeemed but
[1:51:34] we're waiting for the fullness of our
[1:51:36] attention to include the change in this
[1:51:40] body which is the manifestation or the
[1:51:43] adoption of the children of God were
[1:51:47] replaced upon the throne of power
[1:51:50] and it's no longer that's a it's the
[1:51:53] Lord all the prophets before Jesus
[1:51:58] yes saith the Lord all the prophets
[1:52:02] after Jesus just say at the Lord Jesus
[1:52:06] didn't say thus saith the Lord he said I
[1:52:10] tell to you your sins are forgiven there
[1:52:13] will come a time that your children will
[1:52:15] stand in the throne but it won't be to
[1:52:18] throne as a father it'll be the throne
[1:52:20] of Christ an earthly ministry and
[1:52:23] they'll have a power creation
[1:52:28] you potentially have it now the third
[1:52:32] poll has been identified it's among us
[1:52:35] but it hasn't come to the fullest of the
[1:52:38] power of the purpose that have sent for
[1:52:40] now that I was on the earth per second
[1:52:44] and pull but the third pull he stepped
[1:52:46] into the power what he was called to do
[1:52:48] to call abroad to turn the hearts he
[1:52:53] could not do that through the restored
[1:52:54] word first second Pole he could not do
[1:52:58] it to the massage time
[1:53:09] first Thessalonians and we know that now
[1:53:13] we know the path were on 1st
[1:53:16] Thessalonians 4 for this we say unto you
[1:53:20] by the word of the Lord that we which
[1:53:26] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[1:53:30] the Lord shall not prevent them which
[1:53:33] are asleep for the Lord himself shall
[1:53:37] descend with heaven not just with a
[1:53:42] voice but with a shout
[1:53:47] a shout in other words he's not going to
[1:53:50] come and say something but a shout to us
[1:53:53] we could say he hollers something no
[1:53:57] there it's a shout
[1:54:03] he comes with a shout and brother answer
[1:54:06] that's a message together the people he
[1:54:10] said father sanctify them
[1:54:14] through thy truth
[1:54:18] you know what that word sanctify means
[1:54:20] it means to set apart call them out set
[1:54:24] them apart
[1:54:27] father sanctify them through thy word
[1:54:30] and I were at not that truth is word so
[1:54:34] how is he going to call him and and and
[1:54:36] and separate him from the world
[1:54:42] heard the word all in her divorce wasn't
[1:54:44] separated but those that was inspired
[1:54:47] and by faith faith you're separated from
[1:54:51] the rest of the world in faith you're in
[1:54:54] another dimension yet in this world
[1:54:57] Abraham was separated by his faith they
[1:55:01] admired in me they looked at his
[1:55:03] strength as prosperity but when he gave
[1:55:05] us testimony David said I'm for peace
[1:55:11] but when I opened my mouth their war
[1:55:24] all right let's go a little further
[1:55:28] let's go to Hebrews nine
[1:55:35] he ruled I'm I'm yeah he was 9 verse 24
[1:55:43] for Christ has not entered into the holy
[1:55:47] places made with hands which are the
[1:55:50] figures of the true but into heaven
[1:55:55] itself now to appear in the presence of
[1:55:58] Christ for the world No
[1:56:03] for us who's us the children of God
[1:56:07] those is born again like I said for
[1:56:10] loozer
[1:56:10] for Wesley for down through the church
[1:56:13] ages partial revelation but he was
[1:56:16] interceding for them why because they
[1:56:19] had blood applied because they had
[1:56:21] accepted the gospel and they were
[1:56:24] walking in the light of the age and for
[1:56:26] that sin that they had he was
[1:56:29] interceding for their ignorance but when
[1:56:34] he comes and the fools of the word comes
[1:56:37] he cannot go longer intercedes regrets
[1:56:40] to be caught in the wrong court to be
[1:56:44] caught in the denomination
[1:56:48] there will be no appeal for that so now
[1:56:52] what's happened is the Ministry of
[1:56:55] intercession that was in Christ down
[1:56:58] through the church ages what's happened
[1:57:01] it's coming to the bride through the
[1:57:03] fullest of the word and now she is
[1:57:06] interceding to the fullest of the word
[1:57:12] because this is not the age of ignorance
[1:57:15] how can he how can you intercede on
[1:57:18] ignorant when he's opened up the entire
[1:57:20] word
[1:57:23] [Applause]
[1:57:27] cuz of Oh
[1:57:30] what's the significance of milk isn't it
[1:57:32] because the high-priest only can go into
[1:57:35] the holiest of holies and Melchizedek
[1:57:38] and we are of the order not of Aaron we
[1:57:43] are of the order of Melchizedek
[1:57:47] so as Aaron was a high priest and those
[1:57:50] that in his tribe was part of that
[1:57:52] Aaronic priesthood we are part of the
[1:57:55] Melchizedek Priesthood
[1:57:57] we are kings and priests so we become
[1:58:01] intercessors
[1:58:02] we are the victors of Christ on earth he
[1:58:07] said that's a bad word for the Catholic
[1:58:09] Church where the true Catholic Church
[1:58:13] not Roman Catholic Church but the
[1:58:16] universal body of Christ he said how can
[1:58:19] we be vicars he said Moses you're going
[1:58:24] to be gone Pharaoh because I'm going to
[1:58:29] speak through you and so you're going to
[1:58:32] become God to him but he never became an
[1:58:35] object of worship but he was God's
[1:58:41] mouthpiece in other words he was God's
[1:58:44] vicar on earth so now where's the Vicar
[1:58:49] the representative where's God failed
[1:58:53] where's the last voice to the last
[1:58:55] generation and ain't going to come up
[1:58:58] there it's going to come out of here
[1:59:01] out of you you are the voice of God
[1:59:05] [Applause]
[1:59:08] we're the true thicker not to be
[1:59:11] worshipped but to point people to Christ
[1:59:14] through the gospel repent be baptized in
[1:59:17] the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:59:19] remission of sins that brings you to a
[1:59:21] resurrection but now the message of
[1:59:25] Malachi for the prophecy unveil brings
[1:59:31] you to a translation so we're preaching
[1:59:36] the dual message we're preaching to a
[1:59:39] resurrection and we're preaching to a
[1:59:41] translation this is the first generation
[1:59:43] has ever had that message
[1:59:45] because the Lord Himself descended with
[1:59:47] that key the key to the translation not
[1:59:52] the resurrection but the key to the
[1:59:55] resurrection is the gospel repent me
[1:59:57] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:59:59] the gift of the Holy Ghost their earnest
[2:00:01] will be given to you and it's going to
[2:00:04] seal you the grave won't have power your
[2:00:07] hell won't have power over you but it's
[2:00:09] going to see you into that sixth
[2:00:11] dimension until one day God releases you
[2:00:14] and you come and pick that glorified
[2:00:16] body up first and they would remain
[2:00:21] alive she'll be changed he said we need
[2:00:24] rapture in faith faith for healing won't
[2:00:29] do it you can have faith to move
[2:00:33] mountains and that won't do that
[2:00:35] it'll take a faith that's born in the
[2:00:39] heart of the believer it'll have to be a
[2:00:43] heart to proceed
[2:00:47] what's he saying so Christ was once
[2:00:50] offered to bear this verse 28 so Christ
[2:00:54] was once offered to bear sins of many it
[2:00:57] didn't say all and on to them that
[2:01:01] looked for him now for the for him for
[2:01:04] them for them that looked for him you
[2:01:09] know what that word means
[2:01:10] it doesn't mean get up in the morning I
[2:01:13] don't there's the Sun no wonder if it's
[2:01:15] going to rain today or you know but it
[2:01:18] means an eager anticipation those that
[2:01:24] are eagerly looking for why are they
[2:01:26] eagerly looking for him because
[2:01:28] something has been spoken to them that
[2:01:32] now they are an expectation and they're
[2:01:34] eagerly looking for him to them will he
[2:01:39] appear the second time not to everybody
[2:01:41] but to those that have been made aware
[2:01:44] that the train is in the block and
[2:01:49] they've dropped their sandwiches they've
[2:01:53] left the restaurant and they're getting
[2:01:56] over to the boarding dog because they've
[2:02:01] heard the whistle the training haven't
[2:02:04] seen the train but they know it's on the
[2:02:05] block because the whistle said it was
[2:02:08] for those that are eagerly waiting for
[2:02:12] those that look for him eagerly waiting
[2:02:15] anticipating shall he appear the second
[2:02:19] time without sin on the salvation that
[2:02:22] means not pertaining to sin he's not
[2:02:25] coming to offer another sacrifice he's
[2:02:27] coming to claim what he had sacrificed
[2:02:29] for
[2:02:32] because that's what Ephesians said he's
[2:02:35] coming to take possession when boy has
[2:02:38] left the gate he went to take possession
[2:02:41] when he came with that book and there he
[2:02:44] was descending from heaven he'd come to

[2:05:01] covenant I will return and receive you
[2:05:04] unto myself and he's coming prophecy and
[2:05:11] he had in his hand a little book open
[2:05:14] not the whole book because this isn't to
[2:05:19] Israel it's not even to the earth it's
[2:05:22] not to the foolish who's it to the very
[2:05:25] elect the bride the Lord showed his sin
[2:05:29] with a little book not for the whole
[2:05:33] book but the message for the bride to
[2:05:36] prepare her heart for the second coming
[2:05:38] of Christ
[2:05:40] it's her message and the ark the word is
[2:05:45] coming to his place we're in the belly
[2:05:48] of John in the bride becoming one the
[2:05:50] word made flesh watch what it says verse
[2:05:57] three and he cried with a loud voice
[2:06:04] what a shout he didn't just speak with a
[2:06:09] voice he cried with a loud voice I shout
[2:06:17] the Lord Himself you did sin with a
[2:06:19] shout and here he's coming and he cried
[2:06:22] with a loud voice
[2:06:25] as a lion horse and seven thunders
[2:06:34] uttered horses the Lord she listened
[2:06:41] with a shout here comes his angel he
[2:06:43] cries with a loud voice prophecy world
[2:06:53] looks forward they got different
[2:06:55] theologies on them but what if this
[2:07:00] prophecy like down in Egypt what would
[2:07:05] happen if this prophecy was fulfilled go
[2:07:12] over to the Book of Luke look of Luke
[2:07:17] chapter 24
[2:07:30] verse 30 and 31 Luke 24 verse 30 and 31
[2:07:37] and it came to pass as he said it meet
[2:07:41] with him he took bread and blessed it
[2:07:43] and brake and gave to them and their
[2:07:47] eyes were opened and they knew him they
[2:07:53] recognized him their eyes were open they
[2:07:56] were already open but now they were open
[2:07:59] to the supernatural like Elijah said
[2:08:02] Lord let my servant see he said he
[2:08:05] didn't create the angels he only changed
[2:08:08] his eyesight to see those angels and
[2:08:10] cherubs and those chariots all around
[2:08:13] him and he said wow there's more us than
[2:08:16] there are them and their eyes were
[2:08:20] opened and they knew him and he vanished
[2:08:23] out of their sight verse 44 and he said
[2:08:27] unto them these are the words which I
[2:08:30] spake unto you while I was yet with you
[2:08:36] not a new message but now enlightenment
[2:08:41] comes with the message inspiration comes
[2:08:44] he didn't have to bring a new message
[2:08:49] Deuteronomy he didn't bring a new law
[2:08:55] these things are the words which I spake
[2:08:58] on to you while I was yet with you that
[2:09:01] all things must be fulfilled which are
[2:09:03] written in the law of Moses and in the
[2:09:05] prophets and in the Psalms concerning me
[2:09:08] then opened he their understanding that
[2:09:14] they might understand
[2:09:17] the Scriptures then wouldn't he do the
[2:09:20] same he's the same yesterday today and
[2:09:22] forever did he not do it for for Moses
[2:09:25] did he not do it for Joshua and Caleb
[2:09:27] and not the rest they were participators
[2:09:31] in the opening of that prophetic time
[2:09:34] they drew benefits from the power of
[2:09:37] that prophetic time but there was
[2:09:40] something that they lacked they did not
[2:09:42] recognize the mighty God among them nor
[2:09:45] his power to deliver so when it came to
[2:09:49] Katie's marnya they knew the acts of God
[2:09:52] but not the way of God they knew about
[2:09:55] the tree of life but not the way of the
[2:09:59] Tree of Life the way of God the way of
[2:10:01] Christ Christ revealed and he is
[2:10:05] prophecy revealed or maintenance
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:17] let me tell you this real quick I don't
[2:10:20] want to drag this out real quick job 32
[2:10:28] [Music]
[2:10:33] is a little bit warm in here is it just
[2:10:36] me it's a little bit warm
[2:10:39] some say yeah I'm something no in my
[2:10:42] church we got those that's going and
[2:10:45] then right next to and we got the one
[2:10:46] with the shawl it just felt a little
[2:10:51] stuffy more than it is just just cold or
[2:10:53] warm job 32 verse 7 I said they should
[2:11:00] speak and multitude of years to teach
[2:11:03] wisdom but there is a spirit in man and
[2:11:07] the inspiration of the Almighty giveth
[2:11:09] him understanding great men are not
[2:11:13] always wise neither to understand
[2:11:17] judgment now they were trying to discern
[2:11:20] something here what was going on in a
[2:11:22] spiritual rim and trying to equate it
[2:11:24] with natural events but they could not
[2:11:27] come to a discernment to know what it
[2:11:29] was so they just accused him anyway but
[2:11:34] now here comes Elly you and he said why
[2:11:36] I thought two people been in the message
[2:11:38] the longest they would know these things
[2:11:40] or maybe the great and the important men
[2:11:43] the top 10
[2:11:46] but not always the top ten knows these
[2:11:48] things remember wisdom wisdom has to do
[2:11:52] with the inspiration of the Word of God
[2:11:55] because Paul says I preach the wisdom of
[2:11:58] God had the princes of this world had
[2:12:00] this wisdom they wouldn't have killed me
[2:12:02] here's understanding here's wisdom let
[2:12:05] him that have understanding count the
[2:12:06] number the Beast wisdom has to do with
[2:12:08] spiritual inspiration he said I thought
[2:12:12] I thought these people had been reading
[2:12:14] their Bibles all our life well this
[2:12:17] man's been in the message for 40 years I
[2:12:19] just come in 10 years but then the flip
[2:12:23] side is that well that old fogey you've
[2:12:25] been in this message all along and I
[2:12:27] know more than him we're not talking
[2:12:30] about men start talking about ability
[2:12:33] we're talking about the inspiration of
[2:12:36] the almighty giveth him understanding
[2:12:38] you know what that word in my Bible says
[2:12:40] inspiration means breath the breath of
[2:12:45] God brings life he breathed into Adam he
[2:12:48] became a living soul he said oh man son
[2:12:53] of man prophesy Knievel's live ISA down
[2:12:56] knows he said prophesy lets new let's
[2:13:00] wish let it come upon them and then call
[2:13:03] the winds to come and let it breathe and
[2:13:07] that word breathing means breath of life
[2:13:09] then he goes on down he says son of man
[2:13:12] this is Israel and I will cause her
[2:13:16] first renew our bone to come to bone and
[2:13:19] sinew and flesh and I will call breath
[2:13:22] to come into her and then he says and I
[2:13:25] will put my spirit in her breath of life
[2:13:30] to know to have wisdom 144,000 -
[2:13:36] prophets
[2:13:38] what do they do they bring him out of
[2:13:40] Jewish traditions out of the law of
[2:13:43] Moses and bring them to the gospel and
[2:13:47] he breathed in them the both alive I put
[2:13:51] my spirit in them it finishes the drag
[2:13:54] racing and sin and then they recognize
[2:13:59] him they accept him and they're baptized
[2:14:07] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:14:09] remission of sins and he puts his life
[2:14:11] in them and seals him in the forehead
[2:14:14] with the name of their God Lord Jesus
[2:14:15] Christ and then he comes and I said who
[2:14:21] are you
[2:14:23] Wow where do you get those scars how's
[2:14:27] my friends and only recognize
[2:14:35] I wonder if he's gonna do it again he
[2:14:40] did it on the day of Pentecost didn't it
[2:14:42] he stood there Jehovah God and he
[2:14:46] breathed on to the disciples and said
[2:14:48] receive you the Holy Ghost receive you
[2:14:50] eternal life the breath of life the life
[2:14:52] to give you the mind of Christ to know a
[2:14:54] heart to perceive and on the day of
[2:14:58] Pentecost there is a rushing mighty wind
[2:15:01] and it's Hill the house where they were
[2:15:04] out and pillars of fire came down and
[2:15:07] the prophet said he's gonna do it again
[2:15:08] in the evening time the same pouring out
[2:15:12] of his spirit is gonna happen in the
[2:15:15] evening time but he said what they
[2:15:16] thought on the Xu's the street was that
[2:15:17] original outpouring he said it wasn't
[2:15:20] then what is it how do you know what it
[2:15:24] is if you don't know what happened on
[2:15:27] the day of Pentecost how are you gonna
[2:15:29] know if it's fulfilled of anything how
[2:15:32] are you gonna know if you got the Holy
[2:15:33] Ghost if you don't know who he is and
[2:15:35] how he acts and what is to do you don't
[2:15:38] know the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[2:15:39] you'll never know if you got him he has
[2:15:43] to be identified in his characteristics
[2:15:46] so what happened on the day of Pentecost
[2:15:51] there was a change of dispensations glad
[2:15:56] was changing as he morphe glad was
[2:15:59] changing from Son of Man the Son of God
[2:16:02] that's what happened on the day of
[2:16:04] Pentecost and it had the effect on them
[2:16:07] and they came out they said this is what
[2:16:10] Joel said prophecy revealed identified
[2:16:16] they know they didn't know what those
[2:16:21] thunders what they didn't know what the
[2:16:23] promise of the Father was they just knew
[2:16:26] the thunders they just knew what the
[2:16:28] promise of God was it was coming
[2:16:32] and when the promise come they were
[2:16:34] filled with the Holy Ghost and when the
[2:16:40] thunders come
[2:16:43] we either bribed we tried gods either
[2:16:48] called a bride or ain't called a bride
[2:16:51] either got the Holy Ghost you don't have
[2:16:53] the Holy Ghost and those that you got to
[2:16:57] hold a ghost
[2:16:58] st. want you to believe you ain't got
[2:16:59] the Holy Ghost where you go seeking
[2:17:00] another spirit seven thunders he said
[2:17:09] it'll take those seven thunders to call
[2:17:13] the bride either we're called and we're
[2:17:16] not called yeah but I don't know what
[2:17:18] those certain well it doesn't make a
[2:17:21] difference but it does it doesn't make a
[2:17:23] difference in effect because it was sent
[2:17:26] to the scene but it does for you to know
[2:17:28] where you stand so you're not insecure
[2:17:33] that you're like Christ you know where
[2:17:35] you come from you know who you are you
[2:17:38] know what God has done and you know
[2:17:39] you're part of what he has done now you
[2:17:42] stand in the enemy it challenges you let
[2:17:48] him challenge you I know where I come
[2:17:51] from and I know where I'm going
[2:17:56] hell where's the power to hold me grave
[2:18:01] where's the power to hold me
[2:18:04] you can put a seal on it but all the
[2:18:07] seals of Satan and all the seals of the
[2:18:11] denomination's can't hold me in that
[2:18:13] grave because it couldn't hold him
[2:18:24] so Israel received the breath of life
[2:18:27] and we're to have another outpouring
[2:18:30] what it's going to be there's going to
[2:18:31] have to be a crucifixion or a rejection
[2:18:33] and that's the rejection of the Son of
[2:18:36] God they didn't reject the Son of Man
[2:18:40] they rejected to my understanding the
[2:18:44] way I look at it that it came to this
[2:18:49] the capstone of the demonstration of the
[2:18:53] Holy Spirit by them aside son the sign
[2:18:57] of Jesus Christ among us discern in the
[2:19:01] heart well your name is your addresses
[2:19:04] reason why you're here before you left
[2:19:06] the house your husband said pray if you
[2:19:08] get in the prayer line I haven't prayed
[2:19:10] for me he was in the doctor's office 20
[2:19:13] years ago and the doctor looked at you
[2:19:15] and said you got cancer he was wearing a
[2:19:18] great suit you had a pink dress on and
[2:19:20] this is what he said this is what you
[2:19:22] said and the nurse walked in and this is
[2:19:23] what she said this what happened made on
[2:19:30] the hook
[2:19:32] so what was it that was to waking us he
[2:19:36] said it was a third pool so there had to
[2:19:40] come a crucifixion there had to come a
[2:19:42] rejection so there was a crucifixion and
[2:19:46] a rejection he always turns back to the
[2:19:48] time that where those those ministers
[2:19:51] had come to trap him he always points
[2:19:56] back to that when Peter where did Peter
[2:19:59] point he pointed back to Calvary but
[2:20:04] there had already been a resurrection
[2:20:05] and there already been a new
[2:20:07] dispensation but now he's packed
[2:20:11] pointing back to the old to say this is
[2:20:13] why the new came because now he was
[2:20:16] crucified to son of man but he's
[2:20:19] returned in a resurrection i quickened
[2:20:21] in power as the son of God he said the
[2:20:24] same thing is going to happen in the
[2:20:26] evening time my spirit I'm gonna breathe
[2:20:30] into a group of people actually only my
[2:20:35] children and as I breathed in the atom
[2:20:39] as I breathe into Israel I'll breathe
[2:20:41] into her the breath of life just as I
[2:20:48] did on the day of Pentecost so a prophet
[2:20:51] comes and he preaches the seals and he
[2:20:55] starts out with God in simplicity it's
[2:20:59] at all what's the trouble with man he's
[2:21:02] always looking for the great things that
[2:21:03] God is going to do and he points back to
[2:21:07] how that God did things in such a
[2:21:08] simplicity but he doesn't recognize when
[2:21:12] it comes right around him why because
[2:21:14] there were sea urchins and Pentecostals
[2:21:17] and they had preconceived ideas of what
[2:21:20] was going to happen when these seals was
[2:21:21] preached it's like I said but when I got
[2:21:24] baptized I thought when I came out of
[2:21:26] the water here is gonna be angelic
[2:21:28] beings that old son was going to be
[2:21:30] glimmering all this I went down I come
[2:21:32] up and I said what happened
[2:21:35] but something that happened in here but
[2:21:38] I was looking out here for some time and
[2:21:41] they come out and I said ha I knew that
[2:21:44] I thought we was going to really get
[2:21:45] something he said now be careful who's
[2:21:49] believed our report and to whom is the
[2:21:51] arm of the Lord now who's believed our
[2:21:53] report who has God inspired to believe
[2:21:56] the voice of the shepherd that it might
[2:22:00] allow him to have the authority to step
[2:22:02] into the court and become a son of God
[2:22:05] not born a man not born a clergy not
[2:22:08] born of a church but born of God not
[2:22:12] flesh not the will a man but God that
[2:22:16] shows mercy to whom that I reveal myself
[2:22:25] we got we ain't got time for all this
[2:22:28] and I know that that brother lushes
[2:22:31] probably but I just want to go over a
[2:22:33] couple things and I'm not really
[2:22:37] prepared for this because now we know in
[2:22:39] God in simplicity he says never dawned
[2:22:44] on me to something till long late we
[2:22:48] hours last night in prayer I began to
[2:22:51] see something now you can follow these
[2:22:55] quotes all the way down through the
[2:22:56] message now if you're wide awake you'll
[2:22:59] see something see I hope I don't have to
[2:23:03] hold it in my hand to show you and then
[2:23:07] it and then it begins to talk about the
[2:23:09] constellation of angels he was troubled
[2:23:11] by that he preserves this is the time is
[2:23:14] this the time service but that thing is
[2:23:16] still troubling him he goes that the
[2:23:18] Arizona in it that thing just won't
[2:23:20] leave him it's troubling him so he goes
[2:23:22] up in the mountain and this is why he
[2:23:24] goes up in the mountain he wants the
[2:23:25] axle or what is this constellation of
[2:23:27] angel what's this all about
[2:23:29] so he goes that there's his lord what is
[2:23:32] this all about
[2:23:33] what's this constellation agent what
[2:23:34] what's this vision what's it mean
[2:23:38] as a sword he said that's the king so
[2:23:43] what was that it was an answer to the
[2:23:45] question of what the constellation of
[2:23:48] Angels was he said that's the Kings
[2:23:53] sword he said don't be afraid of it
[2:23:56] that's a third pool so the sword the
[2:23:59] constellation angels he's telling us
[2:24:01] it's only the interpretation of what the
[2:24:04] constellation of Angels was and so then
[2:24:08] he comes and he's caught up into that
[2:24:10] constellation that actually materializes
[2:24:12] and so he's going over this in the
[2:24:16] breach because he's trying to point the
[2:24:19] people to something the third pole of
[2:24:23] his ministry the third pull of john's
[2:24:25] ministry behold the lamb of god that was
[2:24:31] his third pole because he stepped into
[2:24:32] what he was called to do mother brown's
[2:24:37] third pole was what to turn the hearts
[2:24:39] of the children back he said he could
[2:24:41] only do that through those seven
[2:24:43] thunders which he said is he opening
[2:24:47] another word so now he's in here and
[2:24:53] he's preaching and he's coming down
[2:24:55] through these seals our Heavenly Father
[2:25:00] here comes the great night this is the
[2:25:03] seventh seal the great hour that went
[2:25:07] great when when a great thing has
[2:25:09] happened
[2:25:11] not going to happen he said have
[2:25:13] happened it's been all around the people
[2:25:16] and father I pray that tonight that will
[2:25:21] be made known beyond a shadow of a doubt
[2:25:25] to the people's hearts and mind our
[2:25:28] heart to perceive prophecy being
[2:25:31] fulfilled to whom is the arm of the Lord
[2:25:35] revealed the power of God that you can
[2:25:38] stand on the day of Katy smart here that
[2:25:41] you can stand on the banks of Moab
[2:25:43] looking at Jordan but not looking at the
[2:25:46] worldly Church they're looking at the
[2:25:47] inheritance keeping your eyes on Christ
[2:25:55] nothing's loophole lawyers that call
[2:25:57] himself
[2:25:58] teachers we ain't looking for no
[2:26:02] loophole lawyer we're looking for Christ
[2:26:06] [Applause]
[2:26:11] chat up a debt the people's hearts and
[2:26:14] mind that they know that God is still in
[2:26:16] the on the throne and that he still
[2:26:19] loves his people and it's the hour the
[2:26:22] hour that it that the world is longed to
[2:26:25] see it's now approaching for it cries
[2:26:28] for redemption what is it the whole
[2:26:31] world groans and travails it's time for
[2:26:35] redemption he says the hours come all
[2:26:39] that they can recognize it
[2:26:41] [Music]
[2:26:46] now why let us prove it why it is the
[2:26:51] secret that no one knows about Daniel
[2:26:56] saw and he's that seal up the vision
[2:26:59] Daniel
[2:27:00] he said Daniel heard the same thing that
[2:27:03] John her seal it up he said it's the
[2:27:09] secret it's the mystery that no man
[2:27:11] knows not even Christ not even the
[2:27:15] Angels what could it be
[2:27:18] the time of his appearing it's a secret
[2:27:24] that no one knows about John was
[2:27:26] forbidden to write about it even even
[2:27:29] write a symbol about it why why this is
[2:27:33] why there was no activity in heaven it
[2:27:37] might give away the secrets you see it's
[2:27:40] so it's so great it must mean it must be
[2:27:43] included because it's got to happen but
[2:27:47] when the seven thunders seen one Thunder
[2:27:53] and he really emphasizes his first seal
[2:27:56] and this one thunder and then he alludes
[2:28:00] back to that blast in those seven angels
[2:28:03] one blast he says one thunder seven
[2:28:09] seals seven thunders so he's trying to
[2:28:14] ties in with this constellation and this
[2:28:17] sword and with this first seal offender
[2:28:23] he's tying the two together
[2:28:26] [Applause]
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:34] what secret Matthew 24:36 forbidden the
[2:28:38] right what the seven thunders seven
[2:28:41] thunders a second coming to Christ
[2:28:43] these are these are my notes seven got
[2:28:50] perfect number seven just write down a
[2:28:55] roll seven thunders uttered or uttered
[2:28:57] straight together like they were
[2:28:59] spelling out something notice at that
[2:29:01] time John started right
[2:29:04] he said don't write it Jesus never spoke
[2:29:08] of it John couldn't write it angel
[2:29:10] didn't know nothing he's telling us that
[2:29:14] what what these seven thunders are that
[2:29:16] they couldn't write is the same thing
[2:29:18] that Jesus couldn't tell him the day in
[2:29:21] the hour he said no man knows I don't
[2:29:24] know no angel only my father knows but
[2:29:27] now this mystery is being revealed it's
[2:29:31] not being talked listen when Moses come
[2:29:35] down it wasn't being talked the prophecy
[2:29:38] was unfolding he tried to point them to
[2:29:42] the prophecy but they wouldn't hurt him
[2:29:46] because they had preconceived ideas oh
[2:29:49] they were they they heard the message
[2:29:52] they knew the acts of God but they erred
[2:29:55] they went astray in their hearts because
[2:29:58] they didn't know the way of God they
[2:30:00] didn't have an intimate relationship
[2:30:02] they didn't have a heart to perceive
[2:30:06] they didn't have the breath of life
[2:30:09] breathed into them
[2:30:21] that's one thing jesus said even in
[2:30:25] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[2:30:27] about it
[2:30:28] he didn't know it himself that only God
[2:30:31] would know it but he told us when we
[2:30:34] begin to see these signs coming now
[2:30:37] you're getting somewhere
[2:30:38] alright notice we can see these signs
[2:30:41] coming this thing could get a hold of it
[2:30:44] and he goes on down
[2:30:51] I'm just trying to pick these things out
[2:30:53] and it's hard for me because when you
[2:30:55] get up here you go blind you'd be
[2:30:57] looking for a note to be right friend
[2:30:59] can't find it and you get back in the
[2:31:00] study so whatever it is it was there all
[2:31:02] the time I'm just trying to he talks
[2:31:09] about the constellation he says so he
[2:31:12] says now now I don't know what I don't
[2:31:16] know the next step here this is where
[2:31:19] actually the tape stopped and and then
[2:31:22] he has a record but now they've picked
[2:31:24] it back up now I don't know what I know
[2:31:27] the next step I know the next step there
[2:31:30] but I don't know what how to interpret
[2:31:32] that it won't be long I've got it wrote
[2:31:35] down here when it happened
[2:31:36] if you see here stop go no further
[2:31:41] that's right here now I'm not prone to
[2:31:44] be a fanatic I'm just I'm just telling
[2:31:47] the truth
[2:31:47] but you remember the little shoe now
[2:31:51] he's going back to what the tenth vision
[2:31:53] the little shoe you're gonna find that
[2:31:57] all these things is one again the little
[2:32:01] shoe the tenth the seventh seal all
[2:32:07] these things he talks about the dream
[2:32:11] that that Jackson had where he went west
[2:32:14] took the trip to cap off the pyramid he
[2:32:17] talks about it no riding in there angel
[2:32:21] didn't know what was that it was the
[2:32:27] coming of Christ to receive his bride
[2:32:31] prophecy David said send thy light and
[2:32:35] truth God of my strength he breathed
[2:32:39] into him to give him strength daniel
[2:32:43] said he put strength in me how by
[2:32:46] revealing the prophecy
[2:32:56] but you remember the little shoe that I
[2:32:59] always tried to explain how that that
[2:33:02] soul laid next to so-and-so in the inter
[2:33:07] conscience and all that kind of stuff
[2:33:10] which it only made a big bunch of
[2:33:12] impersonations started that start after
[2:33:14] it now you'd have to take up the hand
[2:33:18] now huh now how you'd have to take up
[2:33:22] the hand and and hold the people and
[2:33:25] have vibration everybody had vibration
[2:33:27] in her hand but remember when he took me
[2:33:30] up there and said this is the third poem
[2:33:34] no one will know it do you remember that
[2:33:38] visions never fail they're perfectly
[2:33:40] true notice remember the vision of the
[2:33:44] constellation Charlie I hear you are
[2:33:48] something going on I told you this week
[2:33:51] that you I've been all around its men
[2:33:54] all around you but I wonder if you
[2:33:56] noticed it remember the constellation of
[2:33:59] the vision of angels when I left here to
[2:34:02] go to Arizona you remember what time is
[2:34:05] it sir do you remember the dream the
[2:34:06] pyramid cap going west notice there was
[2:34:11] only one great burst of thunder seven
[2:34:13] angels appeared that right one burst of
[2:34:16] thunder seven angels appeared one
[2:34:17] Thunder first sealed one Thunder
[2:34:20] constellation see he's trying to tie all
[2:34:25] these things together and he says this
[2:34:27] thing's been going on around here he
[2:34:29] stands in one place and he says he said
[2:34:32] this is what you've been looking at
[2:34:38] so what does st. an attacking the cloud
[2:34:43] but it's not the cloud it's Christ a
[2:34:48] heart to perceive they can't know the
[2:34:52] acts of God everything was open and they
[2:34:56] seals they're looking for a tent he said
[2:34:59] this is a fulfillment he said that's
[2:35:01] what you've been looking at shut-in with
[2:35:07] God in a secret place it's to give you
[2:35:11] strength to what Satan tried to do he's
[2:35:14] trying to take away your immune system
[2:35:17] he's trying to take away your breath
[2:35:21] he's trying to take away your food he
[2:35:25] wants to starve you to death you don't
[2:35:27] need to go to church you don't need a
[2:35:31] pass through all those brothers and
[2:35:34] sisters they don't understand and you
[2:35:36] know I'm a farmer they're city people we
[2:35:38] don't get along do get it anyway you
[2:35:43] know what Paul said said you're sick
[2:35:47] you're spiritually sick for something
[2:35:50] long Satan has gotten into your life and
[2:35:53] he's trying to separate you from the
[2:35:55] body and he wouldn't he does that he
[2:35:58] you're gonna die you're gonna die
[2:36:02] spiritually you don't need a
[2:36:05] hierarchical system here you need God's
[2:36:07] system to bring it to perfection listen
[2:36:13] you can try all you want to give him the
[2:36:15] preeminence the only way he's going to
[2:36:17] have the preeminence in your life is by
[2:36:20] inspiration of the revelation of the
[2:36:24] prophecy and when that's revealed to you
[2:36:28] the word takes preeminence and when it
[2:36:32] takes preeminence to brings you to
[2:36:33] perfection he that receives a prophet in
[2:36:37] the name of a prophet receives a
[2:36:38] Prophet's reward what is it it's
[2:36:40] righteousness
[2:36:44] can you see where we're at but we're
[2:36:49] waiting for the dynamics to strike the
[2:36:51] mechanics so we're just gonna keep we're
[2:36:55] gonna keep walking with him in the light
[2:36:58] of this word he's gonna reveal it to you
[2:37:00] little by little anything that you have
[2:37:02] need of you need some spinach he's going
[2:37:04] to give it to you you need celery he's
[2:37:07] going to give it to you you need meat
[2:37:09] he's going to give it to you but it's
[2:37:13] not going to come in different forms
[2:37:14] it's going to come in the manner because
[2:37:18] everything you have need of is in the
[2:37:19] manner and that man is going to come out
[2:37:24] of the Bible how this message all these
[2:37:30] people these paranoid fantasy thinking
[2:37:36] people trying to discern the people all
[2:37:40] this old cloud that was a missile and
[2:37:42] had nothing to do with it and he made
[2:37:44] these mistakes he did that he did that
[2:37:46] and nothing but an AIDS virus in a
[2:37:50] different form
[2:37:52] on the people to neutralize to
[2:37:56] neutralize your immune system the Holy
[2:37:58] Spirit and the word it takes the Holy
[2:38:01] Spirit and the word
[2:38:05] we're alone ain't gonna do it but it'll
[2:38:09] take this word and the Holy Spirit at
[2:38:11] the entrance of thy word at the entrance
[2:38:14] not at the approach not to look at it
[2:38:18] not to hold it but at the entrance to
[2:38:21] eat the book at the entrance of thy word
[2:38:25] by the Holy Spirit it brings light walk
[2:38:29] in the light as he is life open their
[2:38:40] eyes of their heart Lord open my eyes
[2:38:43] open my understanding that when I opened
[2:38:46] the scriptures when I listened to the
[2:38:48] preaching when I look at the message
[2:38:50] open my understanding that I can
[2:38:53] understand because I'm your child and
[2:38:59] this this message is Bible there's my
[2:39:03] inheritance because the secret things
[2:39:06] belong to God and he revealeth at them
[2:39:11] to his children that they might fully
[2:39:15] obey his word his Commandments so he
[2:39:20] reveals it to us not to obey the voice
[2:39:24] of brother Branham don't wear pants
[2:39:28] sisters well that's part of it but why
[2:39:32] was Cornelius baptized to fulfill all
[2:39:35] righteousness if you're seeing what the
[2:39:38] Holy Ghost you can go out where all the
[2:39:41] pants you want to instill go in the
[2:39:42] rapture you know but he said you seal
[2:39:48] them to the day of your Redemption
[2:39:50] that's an unconditional covenant
[2:39:53] now you take a sister that she says well
[2:39:56] I can't wear pants because I know the
[2:39:59] word and the message says don't wear
[2:40:01] pants and if I wear pants
[2:40:03] I know one thing for sure I'm gonna I'm
[2:40:05] going to either go to hell or I can't go
[2:40:07] on the rapture so I'm gonna quit wearing
[2:40:10] pants you never quit wearing pants
[2:40:14] but now if you found out you could wear
[2:40:17] pants and still go on the rapture and
[2:40:18] choose not to wear pants now you quit
[2:40:20] wearing pants my son he had a nervous
[2:40:27] condition and and it's just nervous and
[2:40:30] anxious and sometimes he'd get in
[2:40:33] situations and when he try to eat the
[2:40:35] throat would would tighten up and it
[2:40:37] couldn't he couldn't swallow just nerves
[2:40:41] you know and and so he was taking the
[2:40:45] doctor giving him some valium so he got
[2:40:49] into this well now if I take medicine I
[2:40:52] haven't got any faith you know and I'm
[2:40:56] gonna show God I got faith daddy if I if
[2:40:58] I take that that sin I said mark if you
[2:41:00] take that that's not sin he said you
[2:41:04] gotta have faith okay dump them in the
[2:41:09] toilet
[2:41:11] okay now I got faith walks out of the
[2:41:15] house he says oh I better go get another
[2:41:19] prescription as I said mark that's not
[2:41:23] sin just take him if you need them we're
[2:41:28] not talking about abusing them just take
[2:41:29] him as you need it and then pray God for
[2:41:32] deliverance so he comes up maybe a month
[2:41:36] later he said daddy he said I just got a
[2:41:40] revelation I said what's that he said I
[2:41:43] can take those values and it ain't sin I
[2:41:45] said now you don't bend the toilet you
[2:41:51] understand he's working out on a job and
[2:41:54] I found out he's a Christian and because
[2:41:57] of the way that he structured he just
[2:41:59] tries to do everything so right and you
[2:42:02] know when you work out in construction
[2:42:03] that's basically with the government
[2:42:05] they got all these rules and regulations
[2:42:06] and Lord if you followed every rule and
[2:42:09] regulation you wouldn't be able to do
[2:42:10] nothing
[2:42:11] so here's Mark trying to follow every
[2:42:13] rule in every resident regulation and
[2:42:16] when he does you know you get a little
[2:42:17] cut he's working out there's a new
[2:42:19] killer pen he a little cut you got to
[2:42:21] report it you know that's what they do
[2:42:23] on the video right so he gets a little
[2:42:25] cut
[2:42:25] he goes and reports that everybody makes
[2:42:28] fun of him he just trying to do
[2:42:30] everything just it's right so he comes
[2:42:34] to me he's a daddy I'm quitting I'm
[2:42:35] moving out to New Mexico I've been I've
[2:42:37] instilled that in her heart that's where
[2:42:39] utopia is they all love it they are all
[2:42:43] born in Carolina or Georgia but they but
[2:42:47] they love it anyway so I've transferred
[2:42:50] that vision into their heart they said
[2:42:51] I'm gonna quit I'm gonna go to New
[2:42:54] Mexico go to work I said why you quit
[2:42:57] these people are just making fun of me
[2:42:59] and I just I just can't take it anymore
[2:43:01] now I'm quittin I said well Mart I said
[2:43:06] if you quit and go out there you're
[2:43:07] gonna face the same thing yeah I said
[2:43:10] I'll tell you what you do you work out
[2:43:12] there and you pray until that doesn't
[2:43:15] bother you anymore and when it comes to
[2:43:18] the time I don't bother you anymore quit
[2:43:24] you understand the principle we're not
[2:43:31] doing these things to be righteous or to
[2:43:33] go to heaven or be bribed we're doing it
[2:43:35] because we are bribed Jesus didn't need
[2:43:38] to be baptized but he did it to fulfill
[2:43:41] all righteousness the word because the
[2:43:44] sacrifice had to be washed the high
[2:43:46] priest had to be washed by the Prophet
[2:43:48] he said but to fulfill but the church
[2:43:51] watch him go down whoa
[2:43:53] you know the comforters he's got some
[2:43:55] sin he's going down there to get
[2:43:56] baptized you know he didn't even need to
[2:43:59] get baptized but he wasn't we didn't go
[2:44:01] down there it's like now Church I
[2:44:03] already been baptized in the titles I'm
[2:44:05] already saved the only reason why I'm
[2:44:06] getting baptized because the message
[2:44:08] says I got to and he wasn't trying to
[2:44:09] explain nothing because he didn't have
[2:44:14] any insecurities he knew who he was he
[2:44:18] knew why he was going down there and he
[2:44:20] didn't have to explain it to nobody
[2:44:23] he didn't have to apologize from nothing
[2:44:26] John being a province that I have need
[2:44:29] to be baptized v's and that's true but
[2:44:32] to fulfill to fulfill the work to
[2:44:35] fulfill all righteousness why do you
[2:44:38] live the way you are because of who you
[2:44:39] are because prophecy revealed inspired
[2:44:44] in the heart brings preeminence of the
[2:44:48] word the life of Christ anew that brings
[2:44:52] you to perfection not going out here not
[2:44:56] making no mistakes he don't need a man
[2:44:59] with no eraser because that's a man that
[2:45:02] doesn't need any blood some mark he
[2:45:09] tries not to make any mistakes and I
[2:45:13] said and I don't mean to say this this
[2:45:15] mark is a good boy he does her sound and
[2:45:17] I told him I said the things that you
[2:45:20] suffer you had to suffer because you are
[2:45:24] God's gift to me because when I came in
[2:45:27] this message I came in it at the college
[2:45:31] level you nursing I'm saying Seals
[2:45:34] Church ages but I was an atheist and I
[2:45:38] didn't know nothing about justification
[2:45:40] I didn't know nothing about
[2:45:41] sanctification and so I wasn't
[2:45:44] intimidated to preach to a crowd like
[2:45:45] this I thought I knew something but they
[2:45:49] didn't know nothing man that thinks he
[2:45:52] knows something then he looks out on
[2:45:54] people that don't know as much as he
[2:45:55] knows but when a man knows that he knows
[2:45:58] nothing then he looks up to other people
[2:46:01] because he knows it's Christ and so I
[2:46:08] was intimidated by going down into South
[2:46:11] America into the Amazon I thought well
[2:46:13] what do you do if you come to a person
[2:46:15] that's never seen a Bible they have
[2:46:18] never heard the name of Jesus Christ now
[2:46:22] you know you just think about this in
[2:46:23] your mind this person has nothing to
[2:46:26] know about the gospel just a raw even
[2:46:29] now you're going to bring them the
[2:46:31] salvation that's intimidating to me what
[2:46:34] are you going to relate to at least have
[2:46:38] they've been vag alized by the Catholic
[2:46:40] Church
[2:46:40] so you know about Jesus they know about
[2:46:42] the Bible they know about God they know
[2:46:44] something so you got certain to start
[2:46:46] with but if you don't know nothing but
[2:46:48] just an idol just a just a fire
[2:46:51] how you gonna relate to him and so and
[2:46:56] so God allowed my son to be in this
[2:46:59] condition and here by your same old
[2:47:03] thing would come up well I'm a son of
[2:47:05] God no I mean Jesus I have something I'm
[2:47:09] saying I'm not non well I it forced me
[2:47:13] to dig into this word to try to help my
[2:47:18] son I said mark you've had to suffer
[2:47:23] this in your life that God can use it to
[2:47:28] bring my ministry to a place that I can
[2:47:30] help people you had to suffer but if I
[2:47:37] didn't love my son it wouldn't have done
[2:47:40] a bit of good I said I haven't told you
[2:47:44] all I know usually I can get somebody
[2:47:46] else to help you but because I loved me
[2:47:49] it made me reach down into righteousness
[2:47:53] and justification sometimes God allows
[2:48:01] things into our lives and we may look at
[2:48:05] somebody and because we don't have the
[2:48:07] love for them to dig down into Christ to
[2:48:10] find what it would take to help them we
[2:48:15] can come no further in him
[2:48:20] is we by our heads Heavenly Father lord
[2:48:24] I thank you for this people I thank you
[2:48:29] for salvation and the Holy Spirit I
[2:48:31] thank you for my my children and my wife
[2:48:35] prayed it to be within the day Lord and
[2:48:40] they've suffered many things Lord
[2:48:43] because of man for me Lord that I might
[2:48:47] in turn what I've gained and benefited
[2:48:51] from their suffering Lord did I might do
[2:48:54] something to help them what we must
[2:48:58] suffer with you very people that you as
[2:49:01] crucified
[2:49:02] very soldiers that hated you was the
[2:49:05] very ones that you are dying for Lord
[2:49:11] teach this teach us to live teach us to
[2:49:15] care teach us to pray all God may we
[2:49:22] allow you to have a freedom in our lives
[2:49:26] may you bless this people for their
[2:49:29] patience and Lord for their
[2:49:31] long-suffering you know in the Lord in
[2:49:33] these services and Lord I've probably
[2:49:36] done very little trying to use very much
[2:49:39] but God you can take one word one
[2:49:42] thought our wall is to one individual
[2:49:45] and you can open up the fountain of life
[2:49:48] in their heart go out you can do much
[2:49:51] with little your create all Holy Spirit
[2:49:59] breathe upon your people breathe upon me
[2:50:05] open the eyes of our heart Lord and we
[2:50:09] might see thee father I ask it in the
[2:50:15] precious name that I son
[2:50:17] Jesus Christ amen brother lush if you
[2:50:21] come
[2:50:32] god bless you my brother amen
[2:50:36] the Lord bless you I trust that we have
[2:50:40] heard the word with the understanding
[2:50:45] that it is not a man intellectually
[2:50:51] expounding what's written in this book
[2:50:54] but it was God Himself a man he was the
[2:50:58] Lord Himself assigned the prophecies of
[2:51:00] this book it was the Lord Himself
[2:51:03] teaching us to what is to bring
[2:51:06] preeminence in our hearts to what's
[2:51:08] written in the book to give us
[2:51:10] understanding to bring us to perfection
[2:51:12] by the grace of God
[2:51:15] so I trusted we have not put the
[2:51:18] emphasis on our brother monk all jig
[2:51:20] today but we put the emphasis on Jesus
[2:51:23] amen but thanking God for our brother
[2:51:26] thanking God for the ministry and again
[2:51:29] he is sitting in the church for the
[2:51:31] perfecting of the Saints and for them
[2:51:34] and for what it is to expound and to do
[2:51:37] that you have to expound the prophecy
[2:51:39] you got to be taught to give preeminence
[2:51:42] to the prophecy to bring us to
[2:51:44] perfection by the grace of God so it's
[2:51:47] there for the perfecting of the Saints
[2:51:49] for the work of the ministry for the
[2:51:51] unity of the body of Christ to mature us
[2:51:54] by the grace of God so were not tossed
[2:51:57] about with every wind of doctrine a man
[2:52:00] because this is an hour when they wind
[2:52:02] it when we're when we are experiencing
[2:52:05] every wind of doctrine all around us but
[2:52:08] brother Dwight I trust you've heard the
[2:52:10] word and then it god has put it in your

[2:52:24] Lord receive the word of the Lord
[2:52:26] a man not just another sermon not just
[2:52:30] another thought not just another idea
[2:52:32] but it is God Himself getting us
[2:52:35] established in the present truth a man
[2:52:38] as her brother was ministering on the
[2:52:40] prophecy on preeminence and on
[2:52:42] perfection in order to come to
[2:52:44] perfection you've got to give
[2:52:46] preeminence to the prophecy a man by the
[2:52:49] grace of God and to do that you've got
[2:52:51] you've got a you've got a starter a baby
[2:52:54] see you got to repent you got to be
[2:52:57] baptized you got and God has got to
[2:52:59] recognize your faith they give you the
[2:53:01] Holy Ghost save man the bottle God said
[2:53:04] the first two steps are yours
[2:53:06] he says the third one is gods but he
[2:53:08] said God's not going to give you the
[2:53:10] Holy Ghost unless he recognizes your
[2:53:13] faith amen honest he deserves it
[2:53:16] receives your faith and he gives you the
[2:53:18] Holy Ghost and I need the Holy Ghost you
[2:53:21] need the Holy Ghost and amen
[2:53:23] what for because he's a certain teen of

[2:56:02] abba father father father father father
[2:56:05] and as I preached her a while ago we got
[2:56:08] our memories back maybe maybe with Jesus
[2:56:11] of how the God said jesus knew who he
[2:56:13] was he knew where he come from he knew
[2:56:15] why he was here knew where he was going
[2:56:17] hey man that's why he said I got power
[2:56:20] to lay my life down and power to pick it
[2:56:22] up again hey man but why because they
[2:56:25] brother father said he never bypasses
[2:56:27] theophany he said you and I by pastor at
[2:56:30] the hominy because of seeing and so God
[2:56:34] had a plan to bring us to bring our
[2:56:36] memories back hallelujah I Know Who I am
[2:56:40] I know where I come from I know why I'm
[2:56:42] here I know where I'm going amen
[2:56:45] and I recognize that I recognize that
[2:56:49] what we've heard preached in these last
[2:56:51] three services and then it was the word
[2:56:53] it was God speaking to his sons and
[2:56:56] daughters it was God giving us the
[2:56:59] greater faith and more faith and more
[2:57:01] faith of more feet and onto a order
[2:57:04] under what the pop of the gods have we
[2:57:05] got to come to and that is perfect faith

[2:57:11] come to this rub up the make-believe and
[2:57:14] he needs to see we come to this perfect
[2:57:16] faith to believe for the change of our
[2:57:18] bodies to believe Who I am where are you
[2:57:21] where I'm going by the grace of God so
[2:57:24] we got our memories back hallelujah so
[2:57:27] God was bringing again to our
[2:57:29] remembrance the Word of God oh yeah
[2:57:34] I know what you're talking about praise
[2:57:35] the Lord Amen I know it Lord that's
[2:57:40] that's that's on the inside of the
[2:57:42] inside it's in my soul praise the name
[2:57:44] of the Lord so brother I pray grace
[2:57:48] grace then we're understanding the
[2:57:51] prophecy giving preeminence of the
[2:57:53] prophecy being perfected by the word
[2:57:58] amen by receiving the word into our
[2:58:01] souls by the grace of Almighty God amen
[2:58:05] thank God for our brother Mike and thank
[2:58:08] God with the Ministry of the word thank
[2:58:10] God for taking us on higher in the Lord
[2:58:14] Brenna's and listen Saints it comes to a
[2:58:17] place it's the end of the road we say in
[2:58:21] the middle of the road but then it comes
[2:58:22] to the place you got to keep your eyes
[2:58:24] right there because that's the end of
[2:58:26] the road and we're gonna and there's a
[2:58:28] change coming amen brother it's nothing
[2:58:32] that never saw in Luther's day Wesley's
[2:58:34] day and but yet they were seeing more of
[2:58:37] it in the Pentecostal age but they
[2:58:40] refused the further revelation of it of
[2:58:43] how to get from here to eternity
[2:58:45] remember Pentecost believed that they
[2:58:48] were for running the second coming of
[2:58:49] Christ but they refused the messenger
[2:58:52] that was to introduce Christ
[2:58:55] so the grace of God to us thank God for
[2:59:00] the prophecy thank God for the for the
[2:59:03] power and anointing of the Holy Ghost in
[2:59:05] the ministry to leading us to get
[2:59:08] preeminence to the prophecy taking us on
[2:59:11] to perfection by the Word of God
[2:59:16] be perfect even as your father Nevin is
[2:59:19] perfect man oh well no no no no no I
[2:59:25] don't live that kind of life they've got
[2:59:27] nothing to do with that old flesh URI

[2:59:32] be mature as your father in heaven is
[2:59:36] mature hey man
[2:59:38] in the word believe in the word amen
[2:59:42] and yet people that lead people
[2:59:43] ministries lead people to think oh

[2:59:48] no mistakes you won't do this and do
[2:59:50] that and you know you're marina you're

[3:03:56] heads of understanding a man by the
[3:04:00] grace of God

[3:04:04] man to the world it's all a mystery to
[3:04:12] some believers it's all fake but to the
[3:04:15] bride
[3:04:15] this prophecy fulfilled and because the
[3:04:20] bright recognizes as thus saith the Lord
[3:04:22] it is the word full-fare but bride is
[3:04:25] gonna give preeminence man to the voice
[3:04:31] Atlanta our brother brought out the
[3:04:33] shout a man their Brides given Prima's
[3:04:37] to that and that takes rod to absolute
[3:04:40] perfection and the change of our bodies
[3:04:43] this Billy yeah by the grace of God
[3:04:47] brother
[3:04:50] you know if this was a spice ship or
[3:04:54] whatever then that's my ship but a
[3:04:55] spaceship whatever I said well I said it
[3:04:58] I said told one brother I said well I
[3:05:00] said I said God God can use the
[3:05:02] spaceship I said - I said to reveal
[3:05:06] himself he could use anything well we
[3:05:08] know we believe that it was the angels
[3:05:09] of God a man that had come down and so
[3:05:12] on and so forth and and the pillar of
[3:05:14] fire and again the altar of fire amazing
[3:05:22] the spaceship was this any man this come
[3:05:27] from eternity it wasn't in time it came
[3:05:31] from be turns the power of God sir where
[3:05:34] did where did they come from
[3:05:35] he said eternity he said where did they
[3:05:38] go he said they went to return
[3:05:41] hallelujah praise them it's tremendous
[3:05:44] it's wonderful
[3:05:47] our brother was talking about the AIDS
[3:05:50] virus and what was coming to my mind was
[3:05:55] what the Prophet said concerning the
[3:05:57] germ warfare
[3:06:04] we better recognize the prophecy God
[3:06:09] preeminence and that perfect faith our
[3:06:16] brother George the sister Rebekah did an
[3:06:18] article on it some years ago in there
[3:06:20] believers international magazine
[3:06:24] concerning the germ warfare
[3:06:26] and they said it's not the new virus new
[3:06:30] viruses and so on because you're gonna
[3:06:33] have to worry about that's what Satan is
[3:06:36] using why to make way for the old
[3:06:40] viruses to come back amen so your body
[3:06:44] won't be able to fight it off because of
[3:06:48] the AIDS virus your body won't be able
[3:06:50] to fight off so as you watch you watch
[3:06:52] the increase of the old the old diseases
[3:06:55] that that man fought and then used
[3:06:57] antibiotics for and he was right but the
[3:07:02] antibiotics were they had so many number
[3:07:04] of them maybe eight or nine or ten or
[3:07:06] twelve of them now they're down to two
[3:07:08] or three that really really worked and
[3:07:12] it's getting less and less and less but
[3:07:15] the problem of God said there's coming a
[3:07:16] germ warfare upon the earth about all
[3:07:19] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:07:24] that's the only inoculation it's gonna
[3:07:27] work
[3:07:28] [Music]
[3:07:32] who are you gonna believe man or God we
[3:07:40] better know the our were living all the
[3:07:46] vitamins in the world is not going to
[3:07:48] work all the good food in the world is
[3:07:51] not going to work
[3:07:52] not just the Holy Ghost eMac hey man
[3:07:59] it's like that Ezekiel 9 bread
[3:08:05] nice this funny that don't sound right
[3:08:08] to me
[3:08:11] and people think because oh that's
[3:08:13] Ezekiel 9s Bible oh that's good bread
[3:08:19] and I said no I got a funny spirit about
[3:08:23] it
[3:08:23] [Music]
[3:08:25] and I went back nice read the scripture
[3:08:28] and I said yellow that's right
[3:08:33] that's right
[3:08:35] [Music]
[3:08:36] and just because it's Bible you'll find
[3:08:39] millions of Christians of walking by
[3:08:46] but stop and consider what was in it all
[3:08:50] those in it was only two good things
[3:08:52] wheat and barley all the rest was animal
[3:08:58] food let's head to the animals
[3:09:04] they just think God wanted him God
[3:09:06] wanted him to cook it bake it I'm with
[3:09:09] human John but you gotta cut it you
[3:09:14] gotta stop and consider and the rest of
[3:09:15] it was it was animal food you got to
[3:09:19] stop and consider why God told is equal
[3:09:23] to do it do to consider what Ezekiel was
[3:09:27] doing he was promising he was outside
[3:09:32] the gates he was lying on one side for
[3:09:34] so many days ain't on the other side
[3:09:36] were so many days
[3:09:37] and so he was probably saying even the
[3:09:39] lady Israel know what was coming the
[3:09:41] Jews know what was sorry if they didn't
[3:09:43] line up with the word they were going to
[3:09:48] get the best bread in the world they're
[3:09:50] gonna get the worst now they got this
[3:09:57] sort of Bible product and that
[3:09:59] by-product they're just desperate to
[3:10:01] make money it's not your health they're
[3:10:05] interested in
[3:10:05] it's your money so don't go by that
[3:10:10] stuff there's a type of the judgment of
[3:10:14] God amen so remember that no don't don't
[3:10:20] get deceived or fooled by it there's
[3:10:23] many many men musters must bet deception
[3:10:26] up there when it comes to religion
[3:10:28] should I pray the grace of God help us
[3:10:31] so brother
[3:10:33] just make sure you got the spirit of the
[3:10:37] word that was preached this morning make

[3:11:40] continue to use it to build up the body
[3:11:44] in the most holy faith
[3:11:48] [Music]
[3:11:49] I'm just gonna read a few verses that I
[3:11:54] did mention to our brother last night to
[3:11:57] come to the brethren
[3:11:59] [Applause]
[3:12:01] and it's in Psalms 106
[3:12:08] and our brother started with praise ye
[3:12:12] the Lord it's good
[3:12:14] o give thanks unto the Lord for he is
[3:12:17] good for his mercy endureth for ever he
[3:12:28] said in verse 3 blessed are they that
[3:12:30] keep good that keep judgment and he that
[3:12:33] doeth righteousness at all times
[3:12:40] remember me Oh Lord with the favor that
[3:12:43] thou bear'st unto thy people or visit me
[3:12:47] with I salvation that I may see the good
[3:12:50] of thy chosen that I may rejoice in the
[3:12:53] gladness of thy nation that I make glory
[3:12:55] with thine inheritance for Israel for us
[3:12:59] as being part of the bride we have
[3:13:02] sinned with our fathers we have
[3:13:04] committed iniquity we have done wickedly
[3:13:06] our fathers understood not they wonders
[3:13:09] in Egypt they remembered not the
[3:13:13] multitude of thy mercies
[3:13:15] but provoked him at the Red Sea even at
[3:13:19] the Red Sea nevertheless he saved them
[3:13:23] for his namesake
[3:13:25] that he might make his mighty power to
[3:13:28] be known God has her predestinated
[3:13:32] purpose again our brother brought it out
[3:13:35] in the life of his son and the effect
[3:13:40] that would have in him and his
[3:13:42] relationship with the Lord but he said
[3:13:46] they say them for his name's sake that
[3:13:49] he might make his mighty power to be
[3:13:51] known and he rebuked the Red Sea also
[3:13:53] and it was dried up so he led them
[3:13:56] through the depths as through the
[3:13:58] wilderness and he saved them from the
[3:14:01] hand of him that aided them and redeemed
[3:14:03] them from the hand of the enemy and the
[3:14:06] waters covered their enemies and there
[3:14:08] was not one of them left then believe
[3:14:12] these words they sang his praise but
[3:14:17] notice verse 13 this is what happened
[3:14:21] out through the ages in the
[3:14:23] denominations
[3:14:27] the prophet of God said all messengers
[3:14:29] lived to see the decline of their own
[3:14:32] message
[3:14:35] in the beginning of their messages their
[3:14:38] ministries as says they believed his
[3:14:41] words they sing his praise but then they
[3:14:44] soon forgot his works and they waited
[3:14:47] not for his counsel they did what was
[3:14:51] right in their own eyes
[3:14:54] and they waited not for his counsel and
[3:14:59] now we're witnessing the same around the
[3:15:01] message
[3:15:03] amen
[3:15:07] but they lusted exceedingly in the
[3:15:09] wilderness and tempted God in the desert
[3:15:12] and he gave them their requests but said
[3:15:17] leanness into their soul because they
[3:15:20] were desiring natural things not
[3:15:23] spiritual it says verse 21 they forgot
[3:15:28] God their Savior which had done great
[3:15:30] things in Egypt
[3:15:34] therefore it said he would destroy them
[3:15:36] and not Moses as chosen stood before him
[3:15:39] in the breach to turn away his wrath
[3:15:41] lest he should destroy them but he did
[3:15:45] destroy them eventually they came to
[3:15:47] that hour at that time the Bible says
[3:15:49] again
[3:15:55] [Applause]
[3:16:00] I will therefore put you in remembrance
[3:16:03] though he once knew this how that the
[3:16:06] Lord having saved the people out of the
[3:16:09] land of Egypt afterward destroyed them
[3:16:12] that believed not amen
[3:16:18] that is God's pattern that is God's way
[3:16:22] grace to us brother that were numbered
[3:16:25] with those Joshua and Caleb that go in
[3:16:28] to possess the land not with those that
[3:16:31] are destroyed a man by the world and the
[3:16:34] things of the world god bless you let's

[3:18:10] at all with the revealed word to give us
[3:18:14] rap freeing faith the prophet of God
[3:18:18] said I have no message like Luther like
[3:18:24] mastered like Pentecost he said my
[3:18:28] ministry is ordained son of God he said
[3:18:32] to take it all and tie it together to
[3:18:36] show us the mystery of God to reveal the
[3:18:39] mystery of God to give us a faintly need
[3:18:42] for the resurrection and the rapture he
[3:18:46] said what I ministering on they have
[3:18:48] touched on and touched on and touched on
[3:18:51] down through the ages but now God's
[3:18:53] going to explain explain it and God's
[3:18:55] going to expound it and God's gonna tie
[3:18:57] it all together so that now we look back

[3:19:09] down through the ages now we know that
[3:19:13] it's the Lord not just another move not
