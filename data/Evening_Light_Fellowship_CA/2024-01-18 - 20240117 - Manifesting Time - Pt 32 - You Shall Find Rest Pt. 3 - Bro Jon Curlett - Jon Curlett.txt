me to pass on his greetings so God bless you from Brother Ed hammermeister and men never know we might maybe see them in the special meetings this year we'll see what happens but uh talk to a number of brothers that have said if I Don't Preach I might still just come and and listen to what goes on so hopefully we'll have a few visitors as we we come to that amen certainly want to uh remember the the meetings this weekend with brother Karma Mills that he'd travel safely there's also sorts of weather going on these days as we know so just trusting that uh he'll get here safely for Saturday and Sunday and then brother Paul will handle the Wednesday service next week as well with his adult Sunday school as we call it amen so just praying that the Lord will be with that and um Blanc and I aren't feeling well tonight I couldn't really sing much and so I'm just trying to get through the service here tonight so you just trust that my voice will hold out that God will grant us Grace there but certainly appreciate your prayers there it's been a it was a long weekend last weekend it's been a really busy week tomorrow we go visit that Pentecostal family and just try and be a witness to them so we've got a lot going on and then I fly out 5 amm on Saturday so just asking God's grace to be with me to to to keep my health and of course I've got to preach when I go over there as well and you don't want to show up and preach with no voice so just trusting God to touch me there amen remembering sister Jenna as well and is she out of the hospital or is she still in there she's out okay she's had a real rough time over the last couple weeks so we definitely want to keep remember remembering her in prayer as well amen God bless you 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse one says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God an house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we Gran earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon Palm with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we will be unclothed but clothed upon PA that mortality will be swallowed up of life this literally means that the mortality we have will be completely devoured by God's life if you're devoured there's nothing left to you and all that's left is the thing that devours you amen so that's the only thing is left he says the thing I desires that only God's life remains that everything else in me would be would be destroyed that would be devoured he says now he that hath wrought us for the self- saafe thing is God he says the one that's ordained this is God who had also given unto us the earnest the down payment of the spirit therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and I want to take a third and final service on this thought of uh you shall find rest and because I want to take us into maybe a bigger picture and the the full depth and breadth of what it means when we talk about this Capstone this charity this agape love this this perfect love this holy ghost that we've been talking about and we see here in Corinthians that Paul isn't talking about death in a in a in a in a in a sorrowful way in an unhappy way in a dreading way Paul's looking forward to passing on anden Paul's in a place where where he's looking and he he he's he he's in a he's in house you know he's in in a house uh he's kept in a prison in a home there for a while and and and he's he's got a death sentence hanging over him and he's he's got problems with his health and he doesn't get Fellowship the way he wants Paul didn't have a whole lot to stick around in this life for you know but yet so many times we look at death as a bad thing and no matter how bad it is here most people would rather be here than move on because they don't know what awaits them over there but Paul's got the earnest he says he says we have an Earnest he says and this gives us confidence that it's better to be over there than here because here we only get a taste we only get a sip we only get a little bit of it but over there we get the whole thing we get everything that God has promised for us amen and he says we Gran he said earnestly this isn't a put this isn't something that we we just say oh I don't want to be here anymore I wish I was you know I wish I was over there than here Paul says we earnestly grown it's a sincere thing it's a genuine thing he says Desiring to be clothed upon with our house our glorified body which is from Heaven Paul knew the last thing holding him back was this body his character had been developed God had put the the the the spirit of God inside of him he had eternal life inside of him but this stinking flesh was the last thing that was was holding them back and he says I want to be clothed upon with the glorified thing I want to get what God has waiting for me I don't want this thing that that fails and and causes problems Paul said in this dwells no good thing but he says if I can get rid of this then I can have what I've been looking for all this life I can lay my weapons down I can take my peace I can take my rest why because he had a foretaste and we know that Paul also went to go beyond the curtain of time and he saw what awaited there but even in the Holy Ghost as Believers we have a foretaste of what we're going to experience on the other side when we get there amen there's a simple contentment there's a simple rest that comes with knowing we're in his plan we're in his purpose we're in his will we're walking the road that he would have for us we're in his presence brother R would preach a message called the unrecognized presence of Jesus Christ just to know you're in his presence ought to bring us a special peace but when we get to the other side not the way they are now but when we all get to the other side we'll be in his presence and we never separate we're never separated from him ever ever more amen but why do we have this feeling why is it that we can feel at rest that that when a Believer is passing over they aren't freaking out they're not panicking they're not struggling they're not striving to hold on to that last breath or make this right or or try and do this or they're expressing all their regrets but why are they at peace because their lack of peace is here we're pilgrims and strangers here why because there's a Holy Ghost Inside of us that reminds us we're pilgrims and strangers we don't have have contentment the way the world has here we don't have peace the way the world has here we don't fit in here these ways amen if it's the holy spirit that makes the difference on whether we're satisfied here or whether we're satisfied somebody somewhere else because if we don't have the Holy Ghost we get satisfaction out of this we get fed by the things of this world we seek after the things of this world and if there's any contentment to be had we get it here because you're not going to be content over there as you face the Judgment amen so we have a discontentment here compared to the world in that the thing things that satisfy them don't satisfy us and the rest that they have whatever it looks like is not a rest that we're looking for because we're pilgrims and strangers there's something that's calling us out of this world and one day we were offered that opportunity and we took it and we said I'd rather what's over there like Moses that that he chose not to to to have the pleasures of sin for a season but he esteemed what the reproaches of Christ greater riches and there's something in us that that has cued us to that that has called us to that and we respond to that and in that there there's a rest that there's something better that awaits for us it's not here it's over there that we're going to get it amen but if we've got a thirst for the things of this world there's only one thing can satisfy it can only there's only one thing that can take that away and that's the holy spirit it's the only thing that can do it otherwise we're we're running to and fro we're we're we're chasing our tail we're we're always looking for that thing that's ever in front of us and we're never getting it because as soon as we get it there's one more carrot in front of us that we're trying to get and it's a constant one-upmanship of trying to get more and more and more and you're never satisfied you'll find people that finally decide to just lay everything down and say I'm happy with what I've got they are truly the happiest people in the world because they're not running after something that's unobtainable but we have our our treasure is not here our treasure is over there our rewards over there so we don't have to seek things we don't have to strive for things we don't have to push and pull we don't have to look forward to everything that's there our our great treasur is on the other side amen that's why I've said over this pulpit and and I I like like to say things about what I deal with so that it lets you know that if you deal with something it's okay and where I said that if I'm looking to make big purchases all the time it's because I'm falling away in my walk why because I'm seeking contentment where contentment can't be found and I know that by now I know that the big job the big pay the nice car the nice house the beautiful wife that is not where our satisfaction is our satisfaction is found when we find our place in Christ I am more satisfied working harder than I've ever worked here than I've ever been in my life why because I know I'm in his will I know that he's with me I know that he's helping me I know that he's walking with me he's teaching me he's training me and in that is the greatest peace I've ever had because I know that he's in it that's where it is amen but if I if I'm going and I'm always looking at this and I want this and I want that what is it because there's a satisfaction that hasn't been satisfied there's a contentment that hasn't reached inside of me and I need to satisfy that and for the believer the only thing that will satisfy is to get in the presence of God it's to find your place in his word amen and if I haven't been feeding my soul the way I ought to if I haven't been spending time with God what happens is I try and seek contentment elsewhere and all I really need to do is literally sit down read my Bible for a while and talk to God about some things and it'll all go away that's just me though that's just me so don't judge me if I buy a new car in the next few years okay my youngest car I told my wife my youngest car is 11 years old today I'm going to need one at some point the way Newland beats cars up you know but but my point is I can that's a trigger for me I know if I'm doing that then something's off and I find each of us tend to have triggers some of us eat a lot some of us read a lot of different books some of us will will go out and we'll we we'll play a lot of sports and we'll spend a lot of time with certain friends or we're always trying to keep busy or something it's because we haven't got that rest we're looking for but there's a rest for the believer amen but I I wanted to read this because I said that that phrase that if you've got a thirst for the things of the world the only thing that will overcome it's the Holy Spirit Jesus said love not the world nor the things that are in the world for If any man Lov the world the love of the father is not in him now that word love there is the same word as Charity in second Peter 1 and it's it means divine love it's agape love it's the Holy Ghost so he says if any man loves the world the Holy Ghost is not in him that doesn't mean you can't be tempted that doesn't mean you you know bright shiny things or fast things or be no no no that's not we're talking a love a seeking after something that you're chasing after after that's what we're talking about he says for all that is in the world all that's an absolute everything in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but it's of the world that's why I say when I'm looking at things that are in the world it means that I'm suppressing something else or I'm not feeding the right thing in my life and that's why I'm chasing after it that's why I'm looking after it and if I never buy it that doesn't change the fact that I'm seeking after it amen and I've got to get my priorities straight and I've got to get back to where my source of joy and contentment is but we're talking about the big picture this evening and I'm not going to keep you too long tonight but Paul said we only get the earnest here we only get the down payment of the holy spirit in this body and he said in Romans 8 he says not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body we're going to get into adoption when I come back from Vancouver Lord willing but he says even here we're still groaning he says we're we're we're sighing with grief we're saddened by our current state of affairs or life where we're at it's a sad State of Affairs why he says because I know what awaits us and I know what I have now and there is no comparison to be made amen he says Paul had had no nothing to look forward to in life except death he knew when he went to Caesar he was going to die he knew that but it took years and years years for that to happen he wrote beautiful letters and the Holy Spirit used them and and he got to still fellowship and he actually they believe got to leave prison for a bit and travel and then come back again and and these different things so he had some respit but in general he was he was bound by the the the issue he had in his body and they think he he had issues with his eyes and then he was limited in fellowship and he's always under that potential stress of of losing his head at any moment you know but Paul says I'm groaning for it I'm groaning for the change of the full adoption because the adoption we have here is only a taste it's only a little bit because our full adoption is the Redemption of our body it's when we lose this one thing that's really holding us back amen but I want to take it a take a look at the big picture because we're following the same path as Christ we started with Paul but remember the scripture says that Jesus was the firstborn among many Brethren that means we've got to follow his path that means as it worked for him so it's supposed to work for us so his experience is supposed to be our experience his Revelation is supposed to be our Revelation his path is our path how he did it is is how we're supposed to do it we're supposed to follow the exact same trajectory as Jesus Christ did on this earth now we know he was filled with the spirit at the Jordan River when he came to be baptized of John and the baptism of the Holy Spirit was the identification that he was the son of God that's when they knew without a shadow of a doubt that's when he knew without a shadow of a doubt cuz because Jesus had only believed unto this he said yes I have to be about the the my father's work but until there was a confirmation he was walking by faith and we have to do the exact same thing amen but there's an identification that's reserved only for the children of God and that's the baptism of the Holy Spirit remember the scripture says because ye are Sons because you are not you are because but because you are he says God has sent forth the spirit of his son in your heart crying Abba Father it's because you're a child of God that you can receive the Holy Spirit and that's the power of God in you to become a child of God to actually produce what's inside of you amen but under Christ on his walk in this earth we see there the path for a child for a son or daughter of God under the New Covenant of Grace and it's always by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit that's the grace of God to us is that we can have his Spirit he couldn't do it before because our sins were only covered they weren't erased but as we said last service he became our sin we are no more sin there's no judgment there's no condemnation there's nothing Satan can do there's nothing God can do to restore you back to a sinful condition you have already been replaced with Christ he died that's it there's nothing that can be done you're you're sinless this evening nothing can happen but something has to happen now to make you live because you're dead and yes you have no sin and these things but something's got to make you live the life that God wants you to live and that's under the Grace Covenant by the holy spirit so we see what happened to Jesus in Mark 1 it says and it came to pass in those days that Jesus came forth from Nazareth of galile and was baptized of John and Jordan and straight way coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him and there came a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased catch this this is for Jesus to know he didn't say he is he said Thou Art it's the identification for the son or daughter of God that you are a child of God I don't get the Holy Ghost so you know I get the Holy Ghost so I know it's my seal it's my Assurance it's my it's my settlement that I'm going to make it because he's identifying me with him he's not identifying me with you he's identifying me with him amen that's why he gives it so don't let anybody tell you you don't have the Holy Ghost it's your seal it's your experience it's your Assurance amen and if your life matches up with the word I don't care what anybody says you're going to make it why because the Life of Christ is rolling through you I was talking with somebody recently and a and they were saying you know it seems like we focus so much on getting our young people to shout and to dance and to worship and what about the hidden life what about the settledness what about the victory that happens when you walk out of those special meetings on the Monday morning do you still have the victory cuz if youve got the victory you'll have it in church and you'll have it outside of church amen that's what it is it's for you settle it in your heart make your calling election sure that's what Paul said and when you've settled it don't ever walk back on it you hold fast to that cuz that's God's seal that's God's Assurance to you that's God telling you you are my son you are my daughter and I've sealed you and you're going to make it all the way to the other side amen but we see that Jesus gets this clear statement and it's a it's a Vindication of who he is and what he is and he goes near through his Ministry them for about 3 years and we see near the very end now as Jesus is coming to the end of his ministry and there's this little verse that that that that's just the key to this whole thing because you got to see that What's Happening Here is not the big story it's what happens afterwards that's the big story this is all preparation for us to rule and reign with Christ you've got to have your character developed here you've got to be able to to to surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit here because we're going to to rule and reign with him for a thousand years and then we're going to be in eternity with him amen he's got to know that he can trust us so this is our proving time and it's our testing time and it's the holy spirit that does the complete work in The Believer it's a tutor and it's a seal and it's a guide and it's all of these things that we have need of Amen but this is Jesus now near the very end he's about to go in and be crucified in these things this is the upper room I believe it says Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands now catch this and that he was come from God and that he went to God Amen we're not just born by happen stance we're not here because Mommy and Daddy decided they wanted a baby we're not just here by luck we're not just here by by by some little event in the cosmos but we are foreordained to be here but we come from somewhere and we go from somewhere and it's the holy ghost that tells us where we come from and it's the holy ghost that tells us where we're going amen we come from God and we're returning to God and Christ as he nears the end of this ministry says I'm going to be returning back to God now I've got a work to do here he had a mediatorial work on this Earth he had a redeeming work but after that he's going to have a judging work and then he's going to have a kingly work so what he did here Was preparing him for the next stage and that'll take him into the next stage and it's no different for us that God is taking us through this to prepare us for the next stage of our life and the next life will be a thousand years it's a Time and then after that we really step into eternal life we don't die for a thousand years it's it's proving that we're restored Back to Eden but eternity really happens after the the the millennial Reign but Jesus is headed for crucifixion now and his understanding his Revelation is that he came from God and he's going back to God what's returning to God the holy spirit it's the holy spirit in that body that body is not returning to God that body's just it's just a body he could have used anybody that's not it but it's the holy spirit in him which is the god that made him the God man is now returning back to Heaven amen why he was here to pay a Redemptive price and then all that is of God has to come back to God because God doesn't die God doesn't diminish God doesn't scatter the pieces and just let them lay where they are everything that comes from God has to go back to God that's the principle that we're talking about amen God's Eternal God can't diminish or fade away everything he has has to come back to him everything he is has to come back to him that's why we know we have eternal life by the holy spirit is because we are going back to him we're a part of God Amen so we know that in the end Jesus is crucified and he dies and he's resurrected and he's taken back into heaven but before he leaves he gives the promise of a return and this is in John 14 the very next chapter and he says to the disciples let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me now you can't say they aren't one and read that scripture because you can't believe in God and another one God's the only one that's true You' got to believe what's there amen he says in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I personal pronoun will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also now that's the resurrection and the Rapture but he says and whether I go ye know the way you know how by the same experience by the same word by the same Holy Spirit we've got to go the same way he goes because we came the same way he came just we skipped our perfect body but we're still coming by the Holy Ghost and we're still going by the Holy Ghost amen we get the same take the same word put it with the same Spirit it gives us the same results eternal life amen restoration back in the presence of God then he jumps to verse 16 and says I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter there that he may abide with you forever see if the comforter comes that restores you back to Eternal Fellowship he says even the spirit of Truth see it sounds like he's talking about somebody else here even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him so the spirit of Truth he says the world doesn't know it but he says but ye know him for he dwelleth with you that's him right there at that moment this is him Christ the Holy Spirit embodied in flesh he dwells with you and future tense he shall be in you and then he makes it clear I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you it's one and the self-same person time and time again God above us God with us and then God coming back in US amen Jesus had read the word and he believed the word all the way up until this up until he got the Holy Ghost even before he was given the fullness of the spirit and yet he was sinless in all things before he got the Holy Ghost he was the second Adam and he may he had had the same choices and he made the right choices the scripture says he was tempted in all points in all ways as we were yet without sin he never gave in the temptation but the Temptation was there amen he lived a perfect life and it was by staying with the word amen now he's telling the disciples I'm going back to prepare for you and you've got to come the same way I've come don't worry about it he says I'm going to come and lead you back he calls it the spirit of truth but he says I'm going to come back I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you so it's him returning we know that the holy spirit is Jesus because when that Pillar of Fire knocked Paul off of his horse he said Lord who are you and he said I am Jesus why he had returned back to his original condition he had returned back to the pillar of fire it's what the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit the visibility of the holy spirit in a body of fire so we've got to walk the same road that Jesus did we've got to do it by the same revelation we got to see ourselves in the word we've got to believe it and then God confirms it in our life by the Holy Spirit to make it live within us amen that's the Dynamics that we've talked about so I want to take us back to the first experience of this when we go back to the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was given to the Believers and walk from there because again I'm trying to let us see the big picture of what it means to have the Holy Ghost not just in this life but the life to come now in Acts 2 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place brother B would talk about Unity Unity of purpose when we come here for the same reason we'll get the results because we'll come in the unity of the word we'll come here for the right reason and God can do these things and what is it they were there in obedience simple obedience brought the Holy Ghost there they stayed there until it did the work it promised it says and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now I want you to catch what brother brandham says here because it's the most beautiful thing I think if we can realize what it means when God gives you the Holy Ghost brother Ram says according to scripture in the upper room waiting suddenly a sound like a rushing wind that was upon them that was the Holy Spirit like a wind a supernatural wind then they noticed the wind not the wind caused them to notice what was happening it says and out in there was a little tongues of fire 120 of them and began to settle down and set upon each of them what was it he says the pillar of fire which was God himself dividing himself among his people coming into the people he said Jesus had the whole thing he had the spirit without measure we get it by measure cuz we're adopted children his life his eternal life was coming in now what happened he says then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost so we look at this drama in the upper room and this is not just a a good meeting this isn't just a big Revival this is literally the almighty God dividing himself into the believer's lives God taking what he is and pouring a little bit into each and every one of us that's what happens when you get the Holy Ghost God is placing a portion of himself in you and he says what was it it is eternal life coming into you thing about eternity is it doesn't go away you can cut eternity in half and it's still eternity you can cut eternity into a million pieces and it's still eternity there's no ending to it it's infinite amen God's putting a portion of himself he's separating himself out and he's putting it into people brother Braham says if we could only receive this truth now just a moment if we could realize what this scripture means that he that is in you is greater than he that's in the world we can't understand that yet we say we believe it he says and we know it's true but we really don't understand it isn't that interesting we can know something's true but we don't have the full impact of it we don't understand what it means he says what is in you that's greater it's Christ the Anointed God that was in Christ is in you what that means is you are no different than Christ except in the amount I want you to think about that because we would give anything to sit and have a conversation while Christ walked this Earth in a body amen I'd love to have a CH with brother brandham but I'd really want to chat with Jesus Christ because he makes all things clear and yet when you walk this Earth people have an opportunity to meet Jesus Christ just in a lesser form that's what he's saying he's saying God is walking the Earth all over again Heen he says then if he's in you it's not you anymore living it's him living in you see it's not you're thinking and what you think about this it's what he said about this then if he's in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep what he has said and he's trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through see he vindicates himself to so that he can vindicate through he's trying to find someone that will yield themselves he says now it's he that is greater than you is in you is greater than he that's in the world God in you like he was in Jesus Christ because what all God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church see that's God in you he that's in you it's not just an experience it's not just a a Hocus Pocus it's not just a a spiritual thing it is literally God in you living in mortal flesh again that's what we're talking about here people say I've got the Holy Ghost and nothing changes in their life I'm sorry you can't have it that doesn't make any sense because if almighty God I don't care about how small a portion is if it's just you know the the smallest amount of liquid you could get and you put that inside of you and that's almighty God it will change this Mortal body it will change your mindset it'll change your attitude it'll change your approach it'll change your words it'll change your desires it'll change the way you live your life there's no way you can have God inside of you and live the way you were you can't do it amen we better see a change and brother Bram saying that change is going to line up with the word of God 100% amen Holy Spirit can't deny the word of God now Paul comes along and the beauty thing with Paul is that he has the exact same experience without ever being in the room upper room he gets the same baptism of the Holy Ghost he prophesies he speaks in tongues signs and wonders follow him but yet he wasn't a part of the original group and what was it it was God proving once again that it's for as many as the Lord Our God shall call there's no time limit right there's no bloodline limit it doesn't matter where you are he can fill you with the Holy Spirit at any time it's his Sovereign will remember when I read that where where we went through and and some people got it before they were baptized some got it afterwards and all brother R would say is God is Sovereign it's up to him it's up to him we preach stature of a perfect man and then God will go and give it to Raw heathens like that right it's God's Sovereign Grace and his deciding time when he does it it's not up to me and it's not up to you amen but it has the same effect and that's the point is Paul had the exact same thing he had the same Revelations his life lined up with it he lined up with the word as soon as he got the Holy Ghost amen but Paul would say we've only got the first fruits that means we've only got the first portion of the big portion that's available that's all we've got here as great of a meeting as you could have the supernatural the healing the discernment the Deliverance the provision whatever we want to talk about however great it is here this is the smallest portion we'll ever have it only gets better from here it only gets better from here this is the least amount of the Holy Ghost we're ever going to have and what's happening as we walk towards the resurrection and the Rapture is that it's overcoming and it's filling up and it's pushing out and what we're seeing is a greater and greater manifestation of what's in us but the fullness of the manifestation is when we get a new body and that's really the peak of all of these things amen but what we have today is great as it may be it is the least that we're ever going to have you know addicts today when they're hooked on a drug or a habit they get a little bit and it makes them want just a little bit more and just a little bit more and a little bit more and a little bit more why because as soon as they lose that feeling they got to have it back again sometimes we get that way sometimes we get that way because we pull back and sometimes we get that way because God pulls back and what is it it's reminding you there's a satisfaction that's available there's something that's good for you there's something that gives you contentment there's something that feeds the inside of the Soul there's something that that quenches that thirst and that satisfies that hunger that's inside of us amen and then sometimes what happens is we pull back and then hard times hit and hard decisions hit and sickness hits and family issues hit and church issues issues hit and all these different things and all of a sudden we're we're screaming out oh there's a place where I can go there's something something I have and it reminds us that we're a child of God and we've got a source we've got a token that we can take into these things amen why because we've had it before and we know that it's available over and over and over again it's that refreshing that we talked about we're talking on you shall find rest and I'm trying to show you how great a thing it is when God gives you the Holy Ghost because it's a piece of himself and when you realize you've got the key to eternal life you've got the token for your healing you've got the token for the salvation of you and your family inside of you it changes the way we look at situations amen you know when somebody does something well the world would call it amazing but whatever you know you get some athlete that comes from St John's and he wins a Stanley Cup he comes back and they give him the key to the city there is no actual lock but they give him a key to the city and it's to signify the city's yours we're at we're we're here to do whatever you want to do when God gives you the Holy Ghost it's the key to every promise he's placed in the scriptures nothing held back nothing held back from the believer amen what is it it's a magnet that's what it is it's a magnet that's pulling us back and it's as it's as irresistible as a real magnet you know when when I was in high school Mr hotter he'd have this big magnet he had a big u-shaped magnet it had a little Gap about an inch wide then he had this little wing nut wasn't it Matt and he had a little w a big wing nut actually of some sort and the test was could you pass that piece of metal through that magnet without it going from side to side it was the most powerful magnet he had it could easily hold like 10 or 15 pounds of metal it was quite powerful and the thing is you had you're just your two little thumbs and you're trying to pass it through without it being drawn over to one side of the magnet or the other that's what the Holy Ghost is like there's something drawing us all the time amen that's what's pulling us back I want to take us back to Psalm 27 this is the rapture uh scripture that brother brandham used and he said the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid church this is perfect rest this is the rapture message this is the perfect rest why there's no fear because perfect love casts out all fear right if we could walk through life saying Who Shall I Fear and why should I be afraid life would change wouldn't it because we Know Who Holds Tomorrow we know whose Palm we're in we're in a place of perfect rest because he's given us his holy spirit he says when the wicked fell even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell doesn't stop the the event but it changes the attitude of the person in it he says though an host should encamp against me though an entire Army should Camp against me my heart shall not fear and though War should Rise Against Me In This Will I Be confident he said one thing have I desired of the Lord just one thing in my heart brother John that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple it's a beautiful thing when you've got one desire and the only person you can ask it for is God when you can go with a pure heart and you can say Lord this is my desire and it's to be in your presence it's to ask and be answered it's to see the beauty of how you do things that's a wonderful place to be when that is the one thing we desire above all else in our lives what's the effect of it he says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock this is the rapture message scripture that brother Bram used and this is the fullness of the rest that when all around my soul gives way he then is All My Hope and stay whether it's here or whether it's there whether it's now whether it's tomorrow whatever comes our way our rest is in him and what we have here is just a taste of that perfect rest when he takes us into his Tabernacle amen we go to dwell in his place right now he's dwelling in us but now we're going to be gathered back in Christ and that's going to be the Perfection of our rest Paul would talk about it in in in 1 Corinthians 12 he says for as the body is one and have many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ we look at our body I've got all these different parts I've got fingers and none of the fingers are the same some of them are left hand some are right hand and I've got feet and legs and organs and all these things but yet it's all one body he says the body of Christ is the same way it's a bunch of individual pieces but it's still one body he says for by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many and we saw that on the day of Pentecost when God took his body and he divided it out into individual members and he poured his Spirit out into each and every one of us God divided himself up into the body of Believers and they're now the word today they're Christ today and I've said that before it chokes some people but we are Jesus Christ being revealed today if they didn't recognize the fullness how many do you think are going to recognize the little bit that each one of us is it's not going to be many but the Chosen Few that do it realize it why because there's something inside of them that responds there's a word inside of them that when the Holy Spirit flashes across from your life your life it catches them and it Sparks something and they say huh what was that like the woman at the well doesn't matter the condition they're in if there's a seed inside of it when the Holy Ghost walking their way in your flesh comes it triggers something and they start to realize there's more and they start to ask and they start to dig into these things and all of a sudden what you have is what a child of God realizes who they are and it's because the Holy Spirit passed their away just like Christ did in his day and in his time he'd walk by he he walk by by Peter and Andrew and he said come follow me and they did why the word in them recognized the word there maybe not completely but something in them compelled them to go and in time they realized what had happened he walks by a tax collector and says come follow me and he just walks up and leaves why something inside of them responding to that it's a seed that's quickened when the word comes its way and it's the holy ghost that opens those things up amen the purpose of the holy spirit is to secure us to seal us to Anchor us to finalize the process to get our souls back to Eternity that's what God's interested in is the soul amen it's the down payment it's the earnest it's the security that keeps us until we cross over to the other side it's the assurance that we come from God and that we're going back to God but I want you to catch this because in Ephesians 1 it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself it's all in him it's his from start to finish it's his goodness it's his grace it's his will it's his purpose it's his word it's his calling it's his election I rest in that because that means I can't mess it up I can mess up my my dayto day I can mess up my experience but I can't mess up the effect because he's already declared it it's his purpose it's his will and he's determined it by himself he says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times when it's all said and done he says he might gather together in one all things in Christ so he's trying to take everything that was scattered and bring it back everything that's Christ he's trying to gather it back into one and catch what he says both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so there's a portion of Christ in heaven there's a portion of Christ in Earth and he says it's all part of one big body and he's trying to gather it all back together when in the dispensation of the fullness of times at the end times when time is no more that's when he gathers it all together it says in whom also we have obtained an an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so the purpose is to take us over the effect is to make us live this word amen it's the Dynamics it's the it's the life of this word to not only have the letter and the understanding in our mind but it's to have the life that lives it the revealing of the word through you and through I amen we don't just know the word but we have have to live the word we have to become the word we have to be the word amen because we're supposed to be the flesh the the word made flesh today that's that's a high order be the word made flesh today but that's what happens when Christ lives inside of you is you live the life that he did Brother Braham says this because God has a witness God always has a witness and people can like it or they can lump it but God always has a witness and they don't get to choose it God chooses the witness people can accept it or take it but brother R says you're believing unto eternal life this is as a you know you come and you get baptized he says but when the Holy Spirit comes it is eternal life you receive it right then and that's why Paul could say you know if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwells in you it'll Quicken this Mortal body it's already quickened because the Holy Spirit the eternal life of God is inside of you you know we speak of of Charity and and all these things and we know that's the Holy Spirit and we we know that the fruit of the holy spirit is joy and love and peace and all of these things but in its purest form the holy spirit is eternal life that's what it is and everything is contained inside of that it's God himself and therefore it cannot die cannot F fade away or or any of these things Paul would talk about it in Romans 8 he says for I am persuaded I don't care where you're at tonight I am persuaded Paul said and if you have the Holy Ghost be persuaded of the same thing that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come what you're going through today what you're going to go through tomorrow what the government does what your what Your Boss does what the ministry does what Satan does nothing is going to have an effect he says neither height nor depth whether you get high in God whether you go down Into the Depths nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord that word love literally is agapo love it's the Holy Ghost he says nothing shall be able to separate us from the Holy Ghost which is in Christ Our Lord You're sealed it's a finished work he doesn't take it back once you've got it you're good to go all the way through why why can't it separate us because once it's in us we're sealed to the day of our Redemption and it's taking us it made us a part of God it confirmed we were a part of God and whatever is of God has to return back to God now I want to show what this looks like when it's all said and done because I want us to have a rest about what happens when this all is over if we go by way of the grave of a if a truck runs us over on our way home tonight whatever it might be that there's a rest that waits for us and it's the most beautiful thing you could ever imagine now I shared uh the vast majority of this at at sister Edna Brenton's funeral some of you were there some of you weren't but I want to share this because this is the essence of what the Holy Ghost is and we know that brother bradam lost his wife at the the tender age of 21 she was in the Primal life newly married she had a two children there and she was dying in the hospital and I want you to see the state she's in because we got to remember she crossed over and brother brandham called her back so she's been over to the other side she knows what's waiting there amen we're talking about you shall find rest brother B says I walked to the door opened the door and there she laid all covered up like this a blanket sheet pulled up over her face I jerked the sheet down and my heart was just breaking I put my hand on her her perspiration on her forehead kind of felt sticky and I said hope hope honey I said speak to me once just speak one time won't you and I was shaking her he said friends if I live a hundred years I'll never forget what happened those two big brown eyes looked up at me she was so weak she couldn't say nothing she was smiling she took her finger and she motioned and I got down she said why did you call me honey she's leaving a husband she's leaving two children behind and all she's asking is why did you call me back in our carnality we would be striving to stay behind a mother does not want to leave her children she might leave her husband under duress but she'll never leave her children amen everything she had to live for was right here and she says 'why did you call me back and I said ' I don't know she said oh I was in another land it was so peaceful I wasn't suffering she said great big birds like a great Orion there was a man dressed in white one on each side taking me to my home he said oh friend there's a land somewhere she said Oh Billy I love you so much but that didn't hold her back she says I'm going away and I want you to be a good boy she was 21 I was 23 now watch what she tells him to do she says you know that Holy Ghost we've been talking about she said promise me something Billy that you will preach that message until you die she said for it's real she said it's wonderful she said I must go back don't think I'm beside myself for I'm not she said but I know what I'm talking about she said for Israel what the Holy Ghost she says keep preaching the Holy Ghost cuz it's real it's wonderful she had already crossed over and and then he calls her back and she has no fear about going back over again that's all she wants to do she's happy she's smiling she says I'm going back Bill keep doing what you're doing cuz it's worth it but I'm going back there it's way better there than it is here amen she had already tasted what the Holy Ghost was in a way that we only get to see on that other side watch he says will you promise me that you will preach the baptism of the Holy Spirit until you're gone from this Earth because the whole revelation of the holy spirit is found in eternal life I said I promis that she said take care good care of the children said take care of Billy catch that take good care of the children then she says take good care of Billy shanon Rose was about to go she kissed me and she said I'm going what happened she was stepping into the fullness of the new birth she was stepping into what she'd only had a down payment for before she'd only had a taste of the Holy Spirit she'd only had a taste of what it means to have eternal life inside of her she couldn't be there in this body that she had she had to go and get another body and she was a place where it's not just a down payment but she's she's drinking from the fountain amen she's got as much she's living in the Overflow as that song says now we know that settled brother Bam's heart and he was so you know at peace with where she was because of what she said but of course he'd lost his wife and there's nothing more brutal I think than losing a a young spouse like that and then a young child but we know God doesn't leave us comfortless and after a while what happens God takes brother brandom and he he takes them beyond the curtain of time and he gets to experience what she experienced before he ever goes over for real right and after he goes there all brother Brandon wants to do is get back there I told a story I think at sister Edna Brenton's funeral and it was brother Isaiah Brooks that experienced it and he got into a car wreck with other brothers in the car and he knew he was going to die and he says as we're rolling and going through the breakage of the car he said the the Holy Spirit just swept over me and he says and I was at perfect peace perfect rest and then the car came to AR restr and he didn't die and he was depressed if I've got the story right for weeks for months after that because all he wanted was to experience that perfect rest that he had had in that moment because it was a rest that was going to take him all the way into Perfection amen but brother brandom goes beyond the curtain of time and he comes back with this experience and he's so inspired he's so overwhelmed he he's so focused on it because it was such a revelation to him he was so he was en raptured with what he saw it was it was so amazing to him he said it was something that I have not got the vocabulary I haven't got the words to say perfection wouldn't touch it superb wouldn't even touch it he said you just have to be there scripture says I had not seen and ear had not heard neither has entered into the heart of the man the things that God has prepared for them that love him but what God sends a prophet over and now here's the spirit of God revealing to us as best we can have in our words and language what it looks like over over there he says I looked around and then I thought what is this okay here's the question what is this and then I looked real good and I said I can't understand this and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preached was what the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it why because this is a gathering together in one all that were in Christ that's only who it's for there's a Heavenly portion and there's an Earthly portion and over there's the Heavenly portion and they get the first taste but the scripture says they without us can't be made perfect because they need us to complete the body amen so Heaven's not just a place this paradise this this place of waiting is not just a place it's the Fulfillment of the fullness of the Holy Ghost amen it's the it's the mystical body of Christ waiting for the full adoption which is not just a a a Celestial body but it's a glorified body brother set up there they can't eat they can't do anything they're just in a in a state of perfection but we've got to come and get a glorified body so we can go to the marriage supper of the lamb and then we get to eat then we get to do things that that a natural body can Jesus had it remember he could eat and and he could do these things but he couldn't do it at first he could only do it later right but this is the Fulfillment of everything that we believed it's the fullness of the down payment we put a down payment on a house and when we pay the house off we get the whole house but we think we got the whole house no we don't we only own as much as we paid off and until we pay it off the bank owns it don't they but we've got a down payment here where God says I'm going to give you the house and then one day he gives us the house amen and it's a glorified body it's a full restoration it's a Perfection of our relationship with Christ brother brah says this now catch this okay this is in 19 this is in the fifth seal under the opening of the word the the full opening of the word brother brahs had signs and wonders brother brahs had experiences we couldn't even fathom W with angels with the supernatural with healings with discernment with prophecies all of these things and he says and I thought my if I had only knew this before I came here I would make people come here they can't afford to miss this it was beyond anything he'd ever preached beyond anything he'd ever imagined beyond anything he'd ever experienced we're talking about a man that has seen demons come and go that could see the supernatural in front of him that God Almighty stepped into and spoke into a microphone and said this is not William brandom that's how great his experience was and he says this is what it's all about he said now in here we neither eat eat drink or sleep we're all just one what is it it's the gathering together in one all that are in Christ he says well it isn't perfect it's beyond perfect it's not Sublime it's beyond Sublime there's no name that you can't think there aren't words in the vocabulary to say it he says you've just arrived that's all the world says you've arrived when you make you know $150,000 a year and your house is paid off and you have no debt and you've got a million dollars in your retirement account right you've arrived or you get that big promotion or you know you you sign your first big uh contract as a as a an athlete or something like that you've arrived right where you don't have to think about spending money you just spend it that's what they think you've arrived brother Braham says this is when you've arrived you've arrived you've made it this is it there's nothing better I thought my isn't this wonderful oh my and I was afraid of it why was I afraid of dying to come to this prophet of God said he was afraid of dying he says well well this is perfection plus Perfection plus Perfection oh he says this is wonderful notice he says over there we're all just one here we have our little divisions we have our little problems we have our little disagreements sometimes here we're big ones one here one there but he says there we're just all one amen if You' got the Holy Spirit and I've got the Holy Spirit we're both going to be there so we better start getting used to each other here Amen brother Bob sometimes we get so stuck on our differences but you know there's a special bond when we get together not just here you know when I was in when I was in in BC you know and it doesn't matter uh you when I was in BC there were so many Believers there that you'd go to the grocery store and you'd see somebody and you knew they were a Believer and you didn't even know them and yet you had an affinity with them you just love to see them and you see somebody from your church driving or anything and it made your day to see another believer why because you're coming from God and you're going back to God you're part of the same group you're part of the same family and there's a connection there whether you have the same Hobbies whether you have the same background it's why we can go all over the world and people from all over the world can come to us and we just fit why because we're of the same spirit amen that's why I can move to New fin land where I have no family and yet feel at home because I do have family brother Bob is as much my brother as Nathan is and I've got to look at it that way and that's why I can have the satisfaction of family and yes with family there are blood relationship and so it's closer but there's a satisfaction that comes with being around those that have the Holy Ghost because it's just a representation of what's about to happen up there as we go into Glory we get to experience that little bit of being one here that's what we get that's why we come to church is to get our licks of fire together and we get a taste of the atmosphere that awaits us when we cross over to the other side it's just a little part of Heaven that we get here amen and we can't get over there if we're separated here you know I I I think I said this in the in the in the funeral that brother Brandon was surprised at he says you're you'll be surprised who makes it over there and my feeling is he was surprised who he saw over there you know God judges the heart my discernment doesn't put you in or put you out and your discernment doesn't put me in or put me out amen but I'll tell you this if we've only got a taste of it over here that means we ought to have a taste of the unity that comes with the Holy Ghost as well amen that we ought to be able to look past our differences brother brah says we ought to be able to bitterly disagree with somebody and still love them that's what the little portion we have here Amen brother Bob was sharing a quote with me there a while back where brother Bram said that Above All Things he'd rather the church had brotherly love and never experienced Divine Healing in the service was it something like that now we don't have to pick and choose we don't have to pick and choose we ought to have healings in the church and we ought to have brotherly love but he says if I had to pick one I'll take brotherly love over the supernatural doing healings in the church that's an amazing thought why because that's what the Holy Ghost is is its Unity above all else it's Unity it's a Oneness because it's Eternal it comes from God and it goes to God Amen and so sometimes our flaw you know in in thinking and I've I've heard it preach for a lot of my life in different places is that this Capstone of Charity comes at the end of a believer's life how are you going to live a life of Christ if you don't have the love of Christ in you in really in hind side it made no sense everybody's waiting for the Capstone as if it's at the end of their life it's that if that's not in your life you're not going to live a Christian Life in the first place because you're not even going to have the love that is required to get you through the differences that's going to make you patient that's going to make you look past somebody that didn't go the same path you did that doesn't quite believe the way you do now listen I talk with a a very well-known Minister a while back he said John don't worry if you preach the wrong thing he says I did it he says don't worry if you make mistakes I did it he says don't worry about it God will straighten it out and there's Grace for it so you got to have patience for me and I've got to have patience for you but I'm looking at the Holy Ghost I'm not looking at the flaws and what happens is when we get cold and when we get away from God our way what we forget is we forget to see the Christ in others when we pull away from him we can't see him as well in others usually the most judgmental person is the one that's furthest away from Christ in their walk that's hard but it's true the most judgmental people are usually the ones that are coldest in their true relationship with Christ amen sometimes we want everyone else to be perfect as if we ourselves are perfect there's none perfect not even me as much as I'd like to think it that's right Amen brother Paul that Paul's confirming amen but we're judged by God it's him that decides and when he gives us the Holy Ghost that's all the Judgment I care about what he's judged us ready and so he gives it to us but after this is all said and done and brother bram's gone over and he's experienced what's over there he says I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there there is no jealousy why because the only thing you take is your character and jealousy is not found in the character of a son or daughter of God he says there was no tiredness praise the Lord I'm tired I'm tired here tonight he said there was no death sickness could never be in there mortality could never make you old he says over there they could not cry he says it was just one Joy we're talking about you shall find rest Church no jealousy no tiredness no death no sickness no mortality he says you can't even cry over there it's too wonderful he says it's just one Joy where's your rest church that he has confirmed himself to you and he who started the work will be faithful to complete it he doesn't finish something he's not going to he doesn't start something he's not going to finish and that's a satisfaction that comes with the believer amen when you're filled with the spirit and you know that you know and that's really that has to be settled you've got to know and when you know that you know that you know that you've got it everything else just starts to fade away and then when Satan Rises up when hard times come When Trials Come hard decisions come when the money leaves the bank when the sickness comes in whatever it is you say I've got a rest I've got a peace I've got a source I've got a life I've got a strength I've got a token I've got an assurance and all you do is brother Ram says you go back and you take that before God and you say I'm here standing on your word because you gave me a token that I could ride this train all the way to Eternity all the way to my healing all the way to my Deliverance all the way to my guidance all the way to my provision whatever it is you told me you chose me you confirmed me you gave me this token and all I'm doing is I'm reminding you of what you gave me and the purpose it's for and I'm here to claim what belongs to me brother Braham says and so it is with every believer in God the musicians can come if we have need of Salvation or healing we rest our Eternal Soul our body upon God's Eternal promise and just take a hold of God's word and perfectly satisfied and call those things which are not as though they were and nurse away on God's promise God you promised it I believe it he says and hold to it amen God bless you let's stand and me this Capstone we've been talking about for so long it's the Holy Spirit itself this isn't for the future it's for now it's for here and it's for you and it's your source of healing it's your source of strength it's your source of Joy love peace all of these things that we have need of in our lives that's what he gave us when he gave us the Holy Ghost but it's to take us to a place where there is only rest there is only peace there's only joy you can't even cry over there that makes me want to cry here that over there I won't be able to cry amen but there's a hunger for that there's a thirst for that Paul says I'm groaning for that but that means we got to get into his presence to remind ourselves to press daily as to why it is we do the things we do the life we live the words we say the words we hold back the way things go we've got to be reminded of what's coming and that comes by getting into his presence on a daily basis amen but I'm ready to go and lay my weapons down I'm looking for a day where I don't have to sit there and struggle and fight and wonder what's around the next curve I remember when I moved here I think I've said it before and things were real easy when I first got here work they said you got a real long Landing Strip take your time they didn't work me hard and brother jald wasn't working me hard and it was just easy going and brother Joe said John he says that light at the end of the tunnel he says that's a truck because it is day in and day out what is it God's bringing things our way to grow us to mature us to test us to prove us and to prove his word in our life sometimes it's light at the end of the tunnel and sometimes it's a truck amen but through it all he brings us to rest and then we can have rest in the time of the storm I've quoted that song before says sometimes he calms the storm and other times he calms his child amen amen let's enter into that rest Heavenly Father Lord what a promise you've given us Lord what a token what an assurance Lord what a seal what a promise you give us Lord when you give us your Holy Spirit and Lord Brother Braham says we believe it but we don't really understand it and Lord we're trying to get us our elv to see Lord by Your Word what it is you've given us when you gave us the Holy Ghost Lord that it can bring us into your presence Lord that it can bring us into your word it can bring us into the realities of the word in each and every one of our Lives Lord Lord we're seeking a greater reality Lord I'm seeking a greater reality Lord I'm seeking a greater baptism Lord I'm seeking a greater understanding a greater revealing of what it means to be a Son of God lord and I I pray for each one that's here Lord tonight and under the hearing of my voice Lord that you would help us to see what you've made us to be Lord that when you fill us with your spirit it's for a purpose Lord and it's to drive out every bit of evil it's to drive out every bit of sin it's to establish Dominion here Lord every sin that Satan could bring our way Lord It's to bring us into a place of belief Lord a place of rest Lord a place of healing Lord a place of total trust that you and your word do all things well well Lord would you give us a rest tonight Lord May our hunger and our thirst be to to get over to that other side Lord may we not cling to things that are here Lord and may things that are here not cause us to wonder or worry Lord but may our heart be set Lord on on making it to that place where brother Bram says it was perfect plus perfect plus perfect Lord would you just be with us now Lord bless our worship we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen bu land 10:27 but Bob you're going to have to lead it I don't know if I can sing so
