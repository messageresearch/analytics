[42:55] both the speaker and the hearer now Lord
[42:58] as we commit it all to you in Jesus
[43:01] Christ's name amen you can be
[43:08] seated I'm going to turn in just a
[43:10] second to Psalms 140 where we quoted in
[43:13] Brothers you can have the PowerPoint
[43:15] just ready uh you may just follow me uh
[43:18] here just for a minute with the
[43:19] scriptures as we're going to cover a few
[43:21] of them it's preaching to you tonight on
[43:23] the Real Enemy and 1 Timothy chapter
[43:27] 3:7 you don't have to turn here I'm just
[43:30] going to quote some of these they can
[43:31] throw it up on the screen if he would if
[43:33] they would want to uh but the Apostle
[43:36] Paul speaks of the enemy and he's
[43:39] speaking here even in Ephesians 6 of the
[43:42] enemy that we face and in first Timothy
[43:45] he says lest he fall into
[43:48] reproach and the snare of the devil and
[43:53] he gives us this word snare and what's
[43:55] amazing is this this word word means a
[43:58] strategy or a
[44:00] setup uh it speaks of the preparation
[44:04] like preparing for a trap and he speaks
[44:07] of Satan how that he would try to entrap
[44:09] us or to try to snare us uh he says in
[44:13] Psalms 140 this is David Psalms 140
[44:16] chapter 5 the proud have HIIT a trap for
[44:19] me they have set snares for me what you
[44:23] find here and we're going to read a lot
[44:25] of these scriptures is that the devil is
[44:28] a real person and it's not a it's not a
[44:33] we don't we don't use the word God as a
[44:35] sorry is we don't use the word the devil
[44:38] as a metaphor for evil all of us here
[44:40] could look at evil in the world and we
[44:42] could identify it you just can point
[44:44] your finger at uh just a multitude of
[44:46] things and you could easily identify
[44:49] that would be evil or that would be
[44:51] wrong you could look at just crime you
[44:54] could look at murder or or any kind of
[44:56] evil deed that you'd see in people and
[44:59] you would say that would be evil but
[45:02] evil the de the the Bible speaks of a
[45:05] person called the devil and when you
[45:07] give a person a name it speaks of a
[45:10] person or a personality all right and so
[45:12] Satan is a real person and as much as
[45:16] Jesus or we don't use God as a metaphor
[45:19] to describe everything that's good but
[45:22] God is a real person his name is Jesus
[45:25] he's a real person he has a real
[45:28] personality and so Satan has a real
[45:31] personality he's going to be held
[45:33] accountable as an individual yeah now
[45:37] not as not as a group of we see the the
[45:40] symptoms of evil or we see the results
[45:43] of evil and we see all the evil in the
[45:45] world but there's going to be a person
[45:48] who's held accountable for that evil
[45:53] amen there's going to be a a there's a
[45:56] real de and this the Bible speaks of him
[45:58] and this is going to be some of what
[46:00] we're covering here today you're going
[46:02] to recognize uh some of what we're just
[46:05] going to look at as things that we Tau
[46:07] on uh in his Sunday school I want you to
[46:10] follow me real closely here in with your
[46:13] Bible and they can keep it on the screen
[46:15] if you can't get there in 1 John 2: 18
[46:18] we're just going to read one verse and
[46:20] then we're going to go to 1 John chapter
[46:22] 4 1 John
[46:24] 2:8 Little Children it is the last time
[46:28] and as you have heard that Antichrist
[46:30] shall come even now are there many
[46:34] Antichrist whereby we know that it is
[46:37] the last time 1 John 4 chapter 4 two
[46:41] chapters over verse three beloved
[46:43] believe not every Spirit but try the
[46:46] spirits whether they are of God because
[46:50] many false prophets are going out into
[46:52] the world hereby know ye the spirit of
[46:54] God every spirit that confesseth that
[46:56] Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of
[46:59] God and every spirit that confesses not
[47:01] that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
[47:03] is not of God and this is that Spirit of
[47:08] antichrist now not speaking of the
[47:10] person but speaking of the spirit of the
[47:14] person remember brother Brandon would
[47:16] say if I had the spirit of bee toin I
[47:18] would compose music he said if I had the
[47:20] spirit of John Diller I would I would
[47:22] have a gun and he says and if I had the
[47:24] spirit of Christ then I would be Meek
[47:27] and humble like Christ I would produce
[47:30] Christ and so you have a person and then
[47:33] you have the spirit of that person and
[47:35] then you have the works of that person
[47:38] and so he speaks here and he says this
[47:40] is the spirit of
[47:42] antichrist where of you have heard that
[47:44] it should come and even now already is
[47:48] in the world and you see this all the
[47:51] way throughout the Bible you'll see
[47:53] these names that he's referred to and
[47:56] calling him by different traits of his
[47:59] character uh it's all different traits
[48:01] but it's speaking of the same individual
[48:04] Jehovah Gyra Jehovah Rafa Jehovah Nissi
[48:07] those are not different persons but
[48:09] they're attributes of one person all
[48:12] right they're attributes of Jehovah
[48:15] right follow and so the Bible speaks of
[48:18] traits and the same of the devil and it
[48:21] calls him in one place the son of the
[48:23] morning calls him the son of predition
[48:26] the of Darkness the man of sin the
[48:30] prince of the or the prince of the power
[48:33] of the
[48:34] air and so this is what the title that
[48:37] Jesus gives him that he's the prince of
[48:39] this world he's a real enemy and you say
[48:42] brother Matt why is that important
[48:43] because if you don't realize you're
[48:45] fighting a real person not a generic
[48:49] battle not just all of us in just a
[48:51] generic War but there's you've got a
[48:54] real person who is really fighting you
[48:57] really trying to destroy you really
[48:59] trying to corrupt you really trying to
[49:01] battle you it's who you face every day
[49:03] of your life as a Believer and he's the
[49:05] Bible speaks of that he's a he's a this
[49:08] the the Prince of Darkness in fact Jesus
[49:10] goes further and says he's the God of
[49:13] this evil age amen he's the man of sin
[49:16] the Bible refers to him as the anti
[49:19] chist and so what it speaks of is that
[49:22] uh in the Book of Revelations it says
[49:24] there's a a a a a a a real devil a real
[49:28] serpent a real enemy who has a real plan
[49:32] who has a real blueprint who has a real
[49:35] idea or a real purpose and Paul picks it
[49:38] up and says he's laid traps he has
[49:41] snares he studies you he watches you he
[49:44] knows how to ENT trap you or to entangle
[49:47] you he knows how to get at you more than
[49:50] anybody else can get at you the devil
[49:52] can yes
[49:54] amen and notice what he says here and
[49:57] I'm just going to take just a minute
[49:59] just to cover some of this just for
[50:01] foundation we know that there's the
[50:03] spirit of Christ that works in the world
[50:06] and he's working with a purpose in the
[50:08] body in the mystical body today he's
[50:10] working in our lives he's accomplishing
[50:13] a purpose we have a savior a a real man
[50:16] Christ Jesus the man don't ever think of
[50:19] him as some figment or some energy or or
[50:22] some good that you know that uh uh the
[50:25] the the modern spiritual world uh
[50:27] worships today as some energy or some
[50:30] supernatural being and and they they
[50:32] they believe in some superpower but he's
[50:35] more than just an essence or more than
[50:37] just a power more than just an energy
[50:40] he's a real man he's a real person yes
[50:44] amen and he's right now alive living in
[50:47] glory right now he's he's alive right
[50:50] now he's a living person and and and and
[50:54] and though we're though even though
[50:56] we're here on Earth his Spirit dwells
[50:59] within us that's why Galatians 4 says
[51:01] because you are Sons God hath sent forth
[51:04] his Spirit into your hearts whereby we
[51:08] cry Abba Father amen and so yet we know
[51:12] there's another Spirit at work just as
[51:14] much as this Spirit of Christ is at work
[51:17] there's an antichrist Spirit at
[51:21] work and just as much as the spirit of
[51:24] Christ Is possessing and residing in the
[51:27] temples of people the spirit of the
[51:31] Antichrist is living in temples of
[51:35] people amen you believe
[51:39] that he's living and possessing people
[51:43] some of them Christians and when we say
[51:46] Christian I'm speaking of a a person who
[51:49] just claims the name or goes to church
[51:52] uh the world system the whole world
[51:54] today thinks that they're saved and that
[51:56] they're Christians and born again
[51:58] because they go to church every Sunday
[52:01] right this is what John F 1 John 4:3
[52:04] says this is that Spirit of antichrist
[52:06] whereof you have heard that it should
[52:07] come and even now already is in the
[52:13] world yes so John is saying you've heard
[52:16] of the Antichrist coming it's been
[52:19] preached it's been T it's been spoken of
[52:22] uh and you've expected his arrival but
[52:25] beloved
[52:27] wake up amen because that Spirit of
[52:30] antichrist is not only here he's working
[52:34] yeah amen busy he's moving right now
[52:37] he's at work right now you're waging and
[52:40] fighting War
[52:42] now amen so we realize that that that
[52:46] Antichrist spirit is not we're not
[52:48] waiting everyone's waiting for this uh
[52:52] you know this um this uh figure to
[52:55] appear and and surely there will be a
[52:57] figure a false prophet an actual person
[53:01] who becomes Satan incarnate but that's
[53:03] not what I'm speaking of here what we
[53:05] what we have to understand is that it's
[53:07] we're not waiting for this sudden
[53:09] appearing or this person to come on uh
[53:12] come on the scene and then suddenly uh
[53:15] you know he overwhelms and takes over
[53:17] churches and takes over people and
[53:20] everyone's worshiping him but right now
[53:22] his his his workings are right now he's
[53:26] got a church right now he's got
[53:29] followers right now he's got cold
[53:32] apostate hearts that have given themsel
[53:35] whether they know it or not over to his
[53:38] purpose and his plans now so rather than
[53:41] his spir rather than in the future his
[53:44] Spirit as much as the spirit of Christ
[53:46] is at work his spirit is mysteriously at
[53:49] work now setting up his kingdom in cold
[53:54] hearts
[53:56] now
[53:57] yes you can you bear with me just a
[54:00] minute while I get through some of this
[54:01] before we get to our real
[54:04] thought and the it speaks of the man of
[54:07] sin when he appears and the Apostle Paul
[54:10] warns of this and he says beloved try
[54:13] the spirits see if they be of God or not
[54:17] amen because the Antichrist spirit is at
[54:19] work right now and so he said the last
[54:22] days there would come false prophets or
[54:24] false Christ false anointed ones and
[54:26] they would infiltrate the church
[54:29] preaching another
[54:31] Jesus one who we've not preached and and
[54:34] we've already seen the list of those
[54:36] false prophets who have you can look
[54:38] back and point even ones living now of
[54:40] false Christ and false anointed ones
[54:43] who's deceived many millions of people
[54:47] yes amen and they're deceiving many
[54:49] millions of people right now and people
[54:51] follow them blindly without any
[54:55] discernment at all or whatsoever there's
[54:58] masses and millions of people who are
[55:02] deceived yes amen thank God that the
[55:06] bride won't be deceived thank God
[55:08] elected the elected have their eyes
[55:11] open and while the rest of the masses of
[55:14] the world are being deceived God said
[55:16] the elect it wouldn't be possible for
[55:18] them to be amen deceived listen to this
[55:22] here let no man deceive you by any means
[55:25] for the day that day shall not come
[55:26] except there come a falling away first
[55:28] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[55:31] of predition who opposeth and exalteth
[55:35] himself above all that is called God
[55:40] Amen or that is worshiped so that he as
[55:44] God sth in the temple of God showing
[55:48] himself that he is God who these words
[55:51] here who opposeth and exalted himself
[55:55] above all that is called God so Satan
[56:00] opposes you yeah amen and Satan opposes
[56:04] me yeah and Satan opposes the true
[56:07] church right he goes after true worship
[56:12] that's what he wants as we said here
[56:13] before he's much more interested in
[56:18] corrupting the church than removing the
[56:21] church he's much more interested in
[56:25] corrupting your heart or your faith or
[56:29] how you view God or how you view the
[56:32] world he's much more interested in
[56:34] corrupting your mind and your spirit and
[56:36] keeping your faith in place then he is
[56:40] removing it all together because that's
[56:44] his desire that's his motive that's his
[56:48] purpose to shipwreck the faith of God's
[56:51] family and he has no more greater desire
[56:54] than to destroy pure worship he tries to
[56:58] destroy everything that's pure in the
[57:00] world he hates Purity all the while he
[57:04] loves religion oh yeah he loves church
[57:08] oh yeah amen he loves church more than a
[57:10] lot of church people come on come on
[57:13] Satan comes to church every Wednesday
[57:16] and every Sunday yeah amen he shows up
[57:19] every time the doors are open sure he
[57:21] loves church he hates Purity he hates
[57:25] pure worship but loves worship oh yeah
[57:28] amen he's all for it oh yeah he's all
[57:31] for it as as brother Jason preached on
[57:33] Sunday it was just absolutely awesome if
[57:36] you didn't get a chance to hear it go
[57:38] back and hear that by archive the the
[57:41] feminization of the church and worship
[57:44] he loves music he loves worship he loves
[57:46] church he loves people yeah but he he he
[57:51] despises
[57:53] Purity he despises sac sness Satan hates
[57:58] sacredness he hates
[58:00] Holiness despises it and he wants to Rob
[58:04] God of all Holiness and Purity and and
[58:08] and praise he and this is this is the
[58:10] the he uses the systems of the world
[58:13] that's why he's hijacked science he's
[58:16] hijacked education he's hijacked
[58:19] professors and colleges why do you think
[58:21] he doesn't remove them he would rather
[58:24] keep them in place to use them as tools
[58:28] to deceive masses amen he would rather
[58:32] much rather keep it even though it's a
[58:34] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and
[58:36] some of the things go against his
[58:38] purpose and his plans he'd rather keep
[58:39] it in place and he hijacks education he
[58:42] hijacks uh uh entertainment comedy sure
[58:47] yeah and he's and his purpose is to
[58:51] destroy all that's sacred you know I
[58:53] thought about this that it's going to be
[58:54] off topic but it was just incredible
[58:57] that you think of even the Ten
[58:59] Commandments that God gives the children
[59:02] of Israel he gives them the law and the
[59:03] 10 commandments you know one of the
[59:06] principles one of the overriding
[59:08] principles of the Ten Commandments is
[59:12] respect it's not all about respect but
[59:15] one of the overriding principles I
[59:17] thought about this the other day is
[59:20] respect good all of the Ten Commandments
[59:23] all of them all 10 of them could really
[59:26] come down to that principle that God was
[59:29] establishing if you want a whole society
[59:32] and you want a you want a wholesome
[59:34] society and a wholesome nation and
[59:37] wholesome families he gives them these
[59:39] 10 laws and it's all based upon
[59:42] respecting God and respecting each other
[59:45] amen respect for God respect for his
[59:49] name respect for his day the Sabbath
[59:53] it's all about respect it's all about
[59:55] keeping something pure sacred or holy
[59:59] and then he speaks of respect for people
[1:00:03] respect for family
[1:00:05] life right Satan has no respect for
[1:00:09] Family Life Christian family life that
[1:00:13] is honor your father and
[1:00:16] mother amen what is it it's respect for
[1:00:19] family life it's a sacredness uh respect
[1:00:22] for life itself don't murder amen
[1:00:26] he goes further than that respect for
[1:00:28] marriage don't commit adultery respect
[1:00:31] for people's property don't steal
[1:00:34] respect for people's reputation don't
[1:00:36] bear false witness respect
[1:00:39] respect a healthy whole society this is
[1:00:43] what God was given is build upon respect
[1:00:46] and first you respect God that's exactly
[1:00:49] what Hollywood in the world system is
[1:00:51] trying to destroy and trying to tear
[1:00:53] down is respect
[1:00:57] they hate anything sacred or holy or
[1:01:01] respectful even even a a popular
[1:01:05] comedian I I don't remember his name now
[1:01:07] he was just on on on on TV and and made
[1:01:11] a made a statement and said we intend we
[1:01:13] intend to leave nothing
[1:01:17] sacred and that's what they've done with
[1:01:19] comedy they've removed all sacredness
[1:01:21] out of everything they removed the
[1:01:23] sacredness of marriage that's why they
[1:01:26] attack marriage in the courtroom that's
[1:01:27] why they attacked marriage in their in
[1:01:30] in their agenda they they attacked
[1:01:33] relationships the sacredness of of a
[1:01:36] marriage being between one man and one
[1:01:38] woman amen amen they they they want to
[1:01:42] this is their this is what he said we
[1:01:43] intend to leave nothing sacred and I
[1:01:46] thought that if that isn't exactly what
[1:01:48] the devil's primary motive is to strip
[1:01:52] the world of all sacredness and naivity
[1:01:56] to to to take children and Rob them of
[1:01:59] their
[1:02:00] purity am and and and he uses TV he uses
[1:02:05] you say brother mdy doesn't come right
[1:02:06] out there and do it no but through all
[1:02:08] of the the different devices as Paul
[1:02:11] said well be not ignorant of his devices
[1:02:13] he uses television he uses YouTube he
[1:02:16] uses Facebook he uses movies and
[1:02:19] entertainment video
[1:02:21] games these are all devices that Satan
[1:02:24] uses to try to strip people's minds of
[1:02:28] Purity and respect amen and now they
[1:02:32] wonder why they've lost respect for
[1:02:35] police they've lost respect for
[1:02:37] authority they've lost respect for uh uh
[1:02:40] uh rules and regulations amen respect
[1:02:43] for the law what happens to a society
[1:02:47] when you lose the sacredness and the
[1:02:49] respect of God's word you want to know
[1:02:52] what happens turn on Fox News and you'll
[1:02:54] see yes amen
[1:02:56] don't turn on anybody else no I'm just
[1:02:58] kidding turn read your local newspaper
[1:03:01] read just look around you look at the
[1:03:03] world around you this is what happens
[1:03:06] when you remove respect and this is the
[1:03:09] purpose of the Antichrist Spirit but
[1:03:12] God's law is based upon respect love God
[1:03:15] love your neighbor respect God respect
[1:03:18] your neighbor keep things sacred a a
[1:03:21] loss of respect for God always leads to
[1:03:26] idolatry and immorality and Injustice is
[1:03:28] when you lose respect of
[1:03:31] that you could be educated fine
[1:03:33] education have a great education but
[1:03:36] lose your respect for God lose your
[1:03:39] respect for his word and you've lost all
[1:03:42] sacredness and Purity and Satan hates
[1:03:47] Purity are you
[1:03:49] here he hates it this is why Paul said
[1:03:52] in 2 Corinthians 2 lest we be ignorant
[1:03:56] of Satan's devices for we he says Les
[1:03:59] Satan should get an advantage on us and
[1:04:03] we become ignorant or he outwits us or
[1:04:06] he outsmarts us for we are not unaware
[1:04:09] Paul says of his schemes of his planning
[1:04:12] uh and that's why Paul says beloved try
[1:04:15] the
[1:04:16] spirits see if they be of God or not you
[1:04:19] know you should test everything we
[1:04:22] should as Believers and Christians we
[1:04:24] should have enough spiritual discern
[1:04:26] to test and try everything in our life
[1:04:29] that we take
[1:04:30] in all every every injust point should
[1:04:35] be guarded by the word of God right
[1:04:38] every injust point because it's an
[1:04:40] influence upon you it's an influence
[1:04:42] upon your family and you don't even
[1:04:45] realize sometimes the way that the
[1:04:47] devil's using something to just
[1:04:49] influence you remember he just comes to
[1:04:52] Eve and he gives one word just changes
[1:04:55] one little
[1:04:56] word and he uses the same exact schemes
[1:04:58] today he uses anything to get us and
[1:05:01] before we know it we're completely our
[1:05:03] mind how we View Church how we View
[1:05:05] Church habits how we view Christianity
[1:05:08] how we view dress code how we how we how
[1:05:11] we view these things it's incredible
[1:05:13] sometimes that a man of God can preach
[1:05:15] straight from the word of God and
[1:05:17] Believers get offended yeah amen amen it
[1:05:22] should it should be a wakeup call this
[1:05:24] man didn't give us a opinion I mean I I
[1:05:27] I'm just going to say it here you heard
[1:05:28] brother Jason preach straight from the
[1:05:30] Bible straight from the word of God it's
[1:05:33] incredible to me that anyone would have
[1:05:36] any hard time receiving amen something
[1:05:39] straight from the word of God yeah and
[1:05:42] we're Believers and this should be our
[1:05:45] appetite this this this we should be
[1:05:47] hungry for this hallelujah oh friends
[1:05:50] I'm not judging you or condemning you
[1:05:52] I'm saying God help us to to protect and
[1:05:56] make sure we try the spirits make sure
[1:05:58] we clean out all of our channels so that
[1:06:00] if anything that would block us from
[1:06:02] receiving the word of
[1:06:04] God Amen we should be able to receive
[1:06:08] that purely before you know it Satan is
[1:06:10] so used Hollywood and and and and
[1:06:13] whatever whatever venue you want to give
[1:06:15] cuz that's not and that's not
[1:06:16] everybody's battle but whatever way
[1:06:19] whatever Point Satan can give you before
[1:06:22] you know it he so clogs up the channels
[1:06:24] and deforms you and distorts your
[1:06:26] thinking that now you're hearing the
[1:06:29] word of God and and you're and and it's
[1:06:31] like a log Jam it's not it's not you're
[1:06:34] not taking it and it's like it's right
[1:06:35] here it's right in the P the most purest
[1:06:37] form yeah wow beloved try not this try
[1:06:41] not believe not every Spirit but try
[1:06:43] them see whether they be of God or not
[1:06:46] so we understand we're not contending
[1:06:48] against flesh and blood but against
[1:06:51] spiritual
[1:06:53] wickedness in other
[1:06:57] mentions for we wrestle not against
[1:07:00] flesh and blood but against spir against
[1:07:02] principalities and powers in high places
[1:07:06] spiritual wickedness in other dimensions
[1:07:09] not ones that you can see but ones that
[1:07:12] are very much real very much real listen
[1:07:16] friends we're in a real war and a real
[1:07:19] battle we don't say we're in a war I'm
[1:07:22] not speaking I I hope this sinks in here
[1:07:25] tonight tonight I don't use spiritual
[1:07:27] war as a metaphor to describe what we're
[1:07:29] in I mean it literally you're in a
[1:07:33] spiritual
[1:07:34] war it's a real battle
[1:07:38] amen if anything real war or going to
[1:07:42] Afghanistan or whatever you want to name
[1:07:44] or Wars upon Wars really that's only a
[1:07:47] metaphor to describe the real
[1:07:50] war if anything that's the that's just a
[1:07:52] metaphor to describe because human are
[1:07:56] only influence or or or happenings from
[1:07:59] spiritual
[1:08:01] WS or or or or or no matter what you
[1:08:04] want to name in a Physical Realm it's
[1:08:07] only an attribute of an influence from a
[1:08:10] spiritual realm amen and a real
[1:08:13] spiritual world I I read some I've read
[1:08:15] these before I just want to read them
[1:08:17] again Lord just put it upon my heart
[1:08:19] here at the end if you want to display
[1:08:20] that PowerPoint brother Josh listen to
[1:08:22] what brother randam speaks of and these
[1:08:24] are going to be familiar to you but I
[1:08:26] want you just to read them uh if you
[1:08:28] could you have that PowerPoint if not
[1:08:30] we'll just okay good now here notice
[1:08:32] what brother M says here here's two
[1:08:35] Spirits calling one to another I only
[1:08:38] wish that my lovely audience could be in
[1:08:40] this Dimension and see this this woman
[1:08:43] standing here is suffering with the same
[1:08:46] thing that woman sitting there with her
[1:08:47] hands crossed like that and he says
[1:08:50] here's a dark line because the spirit
[1:08:54] that's on this woman is calling to this
[1:08:57] spirit for help and it's both the same
[1:09:02] disease arthritis yeah which is a demon
[1:09:06] yeah as brother bam said what is a demon
[1:09:09] Spirit it means
[1:09:10] Tormentor so a demon is anything that
[1:09:12] would try to torment you and he uses
[1:09:16] arthritis to torment people amen he uses
[1:09:19] physical
[1:09:20] disease and he sends those to torment to
[1:09:23] torment you now we know that God uses
[1:09:27] that the same exact thing as Paul was
[1:09:29] given a thorn in the flesh to keep him
[1:09:33] humble so Satan God's purpose to give
[1:09:35] you a thorn remember this is never to
[1:09:38] torment you it's never a
[1:09:41] Tormentor it's never to give you
[1:09:43] bitterness it could be to keep you
[1:09:44] humble or to put something in the way so
[1:09:47] that you don't go the wrong way but
[1:09:49] anytime Satan gives you a sickness or
[1:09:51] attacks you in your marriage or
[1:09:53] relationship or your home or your health
[1:09:56] or no matter what area he attacks you in
[1:09:59] it's always to torment you because he's
[1:10:02] a Tormentor and brother brandom says the
[1:10:04] the the spirit that's on this woman is
[1:10:07] calling to this spirit for help and it's
[1:10:09] both the same disease notice that here's
[1:10:12] two Spirits now here's a prophet with
[1:10:15] the the vision to to be able to the gift
[1:10:17] to be able to see into another dimension
[1:10:21] that's as real as the physical Dimension
[1:10:24] these two women were in amen yet they
[1:10:27] couldn't see that there was something a
[1:10:29] spirit that was connecting with a dark
[1:10:32] line brother brandham said there was a
[1:10:34] spirit that was connecting them and they
[1:10:37] had no idea wow yeah had no idea that
[1:10:42] the same spirit that was on her was on
[1:10:44] her brother man says I only wish my
[1:10:46] lovely audience could see this listen to
[1:10:48] this is earnestly contending what if I
[1:10:50] told you that your heart trouble can be
[1:10:52] made well in jesus' name you believe it
[1:10:54] then go just a minute and then brother
[1:10:57] bandom says demons
[1:11:00] screamed something called for help demon
[1:11:04] power it come from the audience when
[1:11:07] this woman was healed that Spirit
[1:11:11] screaming to one another for help amen
[1:11:16] it's the spiritual World we're not
[1:11:18] talking about the
[1:11:20] outside it's the spiritual you know why
[1:11:22] we we display these things to give you a
[1:11:24] pece just into another dimension another
[1:11:27] world that is still here and is more
[1:11:31] active than it was in 1959 when brother
[1:11:35] Randon preached 1962 when brother Randon
[1:11:37] preaches this it's more active now more
[1:11:40] so than ever before because as time goes
[1:11:44] further and time goes further the Bible
[1:11:45] says he has great wrath and great Fury
[1:11:48] knowing that his time is short amen and
[1:11:51] so brother Adam says notice demons
[1:11:53] screamed they screamed out they cried
[1:11:56] out in another dimension yes Amen in
[1:11:59] another dimension listen to this friends
[1:12:01] they're just as real as your
[1:12:06] real and I see them many times when they
[1:12:09] leave right I've seen them leave right
[1:12:11] from this platform here I see them some
[1:12:14] of them in shape of bats look like long
[1:12:18] hairs hanging on their legs but an
[1:12:21] epileptic demon looks like a tortoise
[1:12:24] with round legs yeah some of us ought to
[1:12:28] be glad we can't see that other
[1:12:30] dimension oh yeah he says looks like a
[1:12:33] tortoise with round legs hanging up like
[1:12:36] that but usually a demon of
[1:12:38] Oppression seems to be more of a cloud
[1:12:43] form a demon of
[1:12:46] Oppression like a wave and it just makes
[1:12:49] a real funny sound when you're in that
[1:12:54] other dimension
[1:12:56] to see the spirit now these are just a
[1:12:58] few examples brother random gives here
[1:13:00] of demon powers just a few these are
[1:13:02] just a couple little
[1:13:05] Snippets notice what he says here he
[1:13:07] says now you may think that's wrong but
[1:13:10] some of these days you realize if you
[1:13:12] could only take a spiritual Looking
[1:13:15] Glass and look in your
[1:13:19] soul you doubt and you'd find out what
[1:13:24] it looks like
[1:13:26] and the greatest devil the chief of all
[1:13:29] Devils is
[1:13:32] unbelief incredible so Paul says there's
[1:13:36] beings they're they're real they're as
[1:13:38] real as you or I are they they're
[1:13:40] Angels uh of influence it's the who is
[1:13:44] it it's the Real Enemy yeah it's not
[1:13:46] your brother it's not your sister it's
[1:13:48] not your problem that you think is so
[1:13:50] great in your life right now that no
[1:13:53] matter who it is or who you want to name
[1:13:55] or what you want to name the real enemy
[1:13:59] is the devil and his real purpose is to
[1:14:03] defect you to destroy you to to distort
[1:14:07] you to deform you in any way that he
[1:14:11] can even if it's a small victory or a
[1:14:14] small way and Satan knows all he can get
[1:14:17] is just a small little level of victory
[1:14:20] in your life trust me he'll take it yeah
[1:14:23] amen he'll take it and it'll come in the
[1:14:25] form of a complex it'll come in the form
[1:14:28] of a fear it'll come in the form of a
[1:14:30] spirit of some of some activity or some
[1:14:33] Recreation or something any kind of
[1:14:36] foothold he can get in your life to trap
[1:14:39] you and to ins snare you and to entangle
[1:14:43] you real beings in a real Supernatural
[1:14:48] world that is there all the time you
[1:14:51] know it speaks of the devil and it says
[1:14:53] he's like a roaring lion
[1:14:55] seeking whom he may
[1:14:57] devour not that he's a lion but he goes
[1:15:01] about like a lion remember in job where
[1:15:04] have you been Satan oh just going to and
[1:15:08] fro yeah in all of the earth now
[1:15:10] remember the Earth is his kingdom this
[1:15:12] is his world right hello right
[1:15:17] hello Jesus says this is he's the God of
[1:15:20] this world he's the God of this age this
[1:15:22] is his kingdom remember Jesus said if
[1:15:25] this were my world if this was my
[1:15:27] kingdom my subjects would come and fight
[1:15:30] but that's that's that's coming but
[1:15:32] that's not now but now we're living in
[1:15:35] his world in his territory that's why he
[1:15:38] can control the White House that's why
[1:15:40] he can control politics that's why he
[1:15:42] controls the
[1:15:43] entertainment world of the of the world
[1:15:46] that's why he's the prince of the power
[1:15:48] of the air amen that fourth
[1:15:51] dimension and he he he he operates in
[1:15:55] that Dimension he operates in that
[1:15:57] Unseen World and he prays upon complexes
[1:16:01] where have you been oh seeking going
[1:16:03] about seeking whom I may devour this is
[1:16:06] his world this is this is what he uses
[1:16:09] this is his game this is his plan this
[1:16:12] is his purpose oh yes amen and he says
[1:16:15] he's seeking whom I seeking whom I may
[1:16:17] devour he's like a lion seeking whom he
[1:16:20] may devour the Bible speaks of him as a
[1:16:23] serpent I don't know I don't can't
[1:16:26] understand people who like snakes I know
[1:16:28] why I don't like
[1:16:31] snakes I just read my Bible and it says
[1:16:33] that old serpent called Lucifer and I
[1:16:36] hate the devil and so I hate
[1:16:39] snakes you may like them I don't I kill
[1:16:41] everyone that I see unless it's a good
[1:16:43] one that I know is going to you know
[1:16:45] kill rats and other animals there are
[1:16:47] there are I guess you could say I won't
[1:16:49] say there's good snakes but I'll say
[1:16:51] that there's snakes that serve a good
[1:16:53] purpose right
[1:16:56] and so but notice that it calls him a a
[1:16:59] snake he's a serpent he's like a pwing
[1:17:03] enemy the the the Bible speaks of him
[1:17:06] and calls him in one place that I think
[1:17:08] I have it here in my notes uh in one
[1:17:10] place he's called abadin let me just
[1:17:13] find it yes his names the Bible refers
[1:17:16] to him as Satan abadan you know what
[1:17:19] that means in the in in in Greek it it's
[1:17:21] apolon you know what it means destroy
[1:17:25] yeah amen
[1:17:28] Destroyer would you ever attribute God
[1:17:31] to a title like Destroyer no this is
[1:17:35] something this is a title given to the
[1:17:36] Devil he's like he's a destroyer he's
[1:17:40] beel
[1:17:42] abub if you knew what some of these
[1:17:44] names mean you would see how evil this
[1:17:47] is descriptors of how evil he is he's
[1:17:51] he's one place called
[1:17:53] bile you know his name
[1:17:55] Lucifer there's nothing good about those
[1:17:58] names he's the the
[1:18:01] descriptions of the of the of this man
[1:18:04] is subtle Wicked unclean evil lying
[1:18:10] proud he's typed as different animals
[1:18:12] all all throughout the Bible a serpent a
[1:18:14] snake in the grass a red dragon yeah
[1:18:18] amen cruel and Powerful a prow Lion now
[1:18:23] would you ever want to be locked up in a
[1:18:27] room a 10x10 room with a lion a snake
[1:18:32] and a
[1:18:34] dragon raise your hand young people
[1:18:37] would you ever like I know you think
[1:18:38] that'd be cool but really it wouldn't
[1:18:41] would you ever like to be in a room with
[1:18:42] a snake a lion and a
[1:18:46] dragon do you know that every time
[1:18:49] you're in your room and you pull up the
[1:18:50] internet and you pull up Instagram and
[1:18:52] you pull up your Facebook and do you
[1:18:55] realize that you're in that room with
[1:18:57] that
[1:18:58] dragon and that lion and that snake say
[1:19:03] brother the matter are you preaching
[1:19:04] again no I'm just I'm I'm not preaching
[1:19:06] that against that at all I'm I'm letting
[1:19:08] you know you should be on guard because
[1:19:11] you have a real enemy who will use any
[1:19:15] device or anything he can to destroy
[1:19:19] you Brothers do you know every time you
[1:19:22] go you you go to prayer and you you get
[1:19:24] on your knees and you bow your head and
[1:19:26] you say Jesus and you enter into another
[1:19:30] spiritual Dimension as much as there's
[1:19:33] as much as there's angels in a heavenly
[1:19:35] father there there's a there's a demon
[1:19:37] spirit and a destroyer trying to hinder
[1:19:41] you brother Matt why is it so hard to
[1:19:44] pray well let me tell you he's the
[1:19:47] prince of the and has the power of the
[1:19:51] air the atmosphere yeah amen so it's so
[1:19:55] hard to pray today because the
[1:19:58] atmosphere is against prayer it's
[1:20:01] against consecration it's against
[1:20:02] anything that's why you've got to
[1:20:04] sometimes you've got to labor you've got
[1:20:06] to you've got to work you you feel like
[1:20:07] you've got to really enter in or push in
[1:20:10] or pray through amen because this world
[1:20:14] is not my world it's not my home amen
[1:20:19] but you've got a real enemy do you
[1:20:21] realize every time I just want to bring
[1:20:23] clarification of that to go a little bit
[1:20:24] further every time you're in you're
[1:20:26] you're you're you're on your uh no
[1:20:28] matter where you're at whether it's on a
[1:20:30] phone or not that spirit that comes to
[1:20:33] you and starts whispering to you and
[1:20:34] talking to you and trying to discourage
[1:20:36] you and depress you and oppress you he's
[1:20:40] subtle he's wicked he's unclean so
[1:20:43] anything unclean that comes in your mind
[1:20:45] came from him amen
[1:20:52] amen this is this is what what the devil
[1:20:55] speaks of him he's an entrapper he tries
[1:20:57] to ins snare and tries to entrap
[1:21:02] us I just just struggling to know which
[1:21:05] way to go and I'll just I'll go this
[1:21:07] this way just for a
[1:21:09] moment he speaks of this and he says in
[1:21:12] 1 Timothy
[1:21:13] 3:7 let let me read 2 Timothy 2 if you
[1:21:16] have that pull it up on the screen 2
[1:21:19] Timothy Chapter 2 and if you have your
[1:21:21] Bible you can turn there with me too if
[1:21:23] they don't get it on the the screen in
[1:21:26] time 2 Timothy Chapter
[1:21:34] 2 let's just read one verse I'm just
[1:21:36] going to read this just to save time
[1:21:39] this is verse 26 and that they may
[1:21:43] recover themselves out of the snare of
[1:21:47] the devil who are taken captive by him
[1:21:52] notice that who are taken captive itive
[1:21:55] prisoner and snared by him at his will
[1:22:00] we we we read first Timothy where it
[1:22:02] says lest he fall into the reproach and
[1:22:05] the snare or the entrapment of the of
[1:22:08] the devil and so you notice that Satan
[1:22:11] is a schemer he's he's a planner you
[1:22:14] know many times Satan has trapped us if
[1:22:17] we'd be honest oh yeah amen I've been
[1:22:20] victim many times to his traps in my
[1:22:22] life am lose my my temper and then go
[1:22:26] back and lost my temper did something
[1:22:27] wrong and man I can just trace it after
[1:22:29] you get over it and you're done venting
[1:22:31] and you're repenting and your heart's
[1:22:33] humble again that's true you trace it
[1:22:35] back and look all the back and go oh
[1:22:38] that dumb
[1:22:40] devil and you you you notice you watch
[1:22:42] the way he SN snared you or ENT trapped
[1:22:45] you and sometimes intricate intricate
[1:22:50] traps well planned well devised well
[1:22:53] thought out
[1:22:56] and listen to me brother and sister it's
[1:22:58] not a trap to go oh I got you no it has
[1:23:02] nothing to do with haha I got you it's
[1:23:04] all trying to destroy you he's trying
[1:23:08] and if he can't destroy you and take you
[1:23:10] off the Earth he'll try to scar you or
[1:23:12] burn you or maim

[1:23:19] marriages maimed their took them in
[1:23:22] childhood as teenage years and lives
[1:23:24] through the rest of their days with
[1:23:26] because of traps and ins snars and
[1:23:29] places where Satan has trapped them and
[1:23:31] snared them and now they lived with live
[1:23:33] with some of those scars are you
[1:23:36] here the wicked notice this is Psalms
[1:23:39] 119 and you're going to have to be real
[1:23:41] good here with the um the scriptures I'm
[1:23:44] just going to go through them quickly
[1:23:46] Psalms chapter 1119 notice this here in
[1:23:49] verse 110 110 Psalms
[1:23:53] 119 this is what David says he says the
[1:23:56] wicked now who's the
[1:23:59] Wicked the devil let's go and give him a
[1:24:02] name because we're speaking of a person
[1:24:04] we're not speaking of a energy right
[1:24:07] we're not speaking of a metaphor to
[1:24:09] describe something
[1:24:11] bad but know your
[1:24:13] enemy call him out by name that's what
[1:24:15] brother brandham said to do he said call
[1:24:17] him out boo devil speak to him as who he
[1:24:20] is he's not just some some Wicked Force
[1:24:23] but David says the wicked notice this
[1:24:26] this is Satan have laid a
[1:24:29] snare for me yet I AED not from thy
[1:24:34] precepts notice Psalms
[1:24:37] 124 verse 7 our soul is escaped as a
[1:24:42] bird this is Psalms
[1:24:44] 124:7 our soul is escaped as a bird out
[1:24:48] of the snare of the fowers the snare is
[1:24:51] broken and we are escaped that's a
[1:24:54] testimony of a Believer we have we've
[1:24:57] escaped thank God so notice he says
[1:25:00] these are satanic setups these are
[1:25:03] snares or entrapments ways to entangle
[1:25:06] you and if any way that he can he'll try
[1:25:09] to entangle you and ENT trap you and
[1:25:12] he'll use anything in your life notice
[1:25:13] I'm just going to read this is a very
[1:25:15] familiar one be
[1:25:18] sober this is First Peter be vigilant
[1:25:21] yeah this is the warning to the Christan
[1:25:24] Christian be sober be
[1:25:28] vigilant you know that
[1:25:30] scripture he says because your adversary
[1:25:34] the devil 1 Peter 5 because your
[1:25:36] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[1:25:39] walketh about seeking whom he
[1:25:43] may devour that's right Feast upon feed
[1:25:49] upon seeking whom he may devour this is
[1:25:52] why Paul says don't be ignorant
[1:25:54] unless he get a an advantage on you
[1:25:57] don't be ignorant of his devices so
[1:26:01] Satan comes to us and listen to me our
[1:26:04] enemy will come to us at all seasons of
[1:26:07] our life oh yeah you think life is just
[1:26:10] particularly hard now it will be in the
[1:26:13] next season and it will be in the next
[1:26:15] season and it will be in your older
[1:26:17] season your younger season your
[1:26:19] middleaged season because you always
[1:26:21] have an enemy and at any season whether
[1:26:24] it's good times or bad times High Times
[1:26:28] or low times sick times healthy times
[1:26:32] Satan will attack you in any season low
[1:26:36] high good bad
[1:26:40] true and he traps us and snares us he
[1:26:43] uses
[1:26:45] camouflage amen he uses ways to disguise
[1:26:50] himself as maybe something that seems so
[1:26:53] harmless yeah uhhuh amen and and it
[1:26:56] doesn't seem like there's anything wrong
[1:26:57] with he'll use he'll use
[1:27:00] trickery he'll use good people yeah
[1:27:03] people that you
[1:27:05] love and he'll use bad people he'll use
[1:27:08] enemies good times and bad times and
[1:27:12] he'll try to track US try to trap us and
[1:27:15] ens snare us you say brother Matt then
[1:27:18] what do we do we pray for spiritual
[1:27:21] discernment yes amen Believers to try
[1:27:26] every Spirit see if they be of God or
[1:27:29] not let the word of God you know what
[1:27:31] will always expose the devil the word
[1:27:35] will always expose the enemy amen take
[1:27:39] it back to the word of God give it the
[1:27:42] word test as brother brandham says it'll
[1:27:45] always expose the enemy and one of the
[1:27:47] greatest things we could do by the
[1:27:49] preaching of the word of God is to
[1:27:51] expose the devil in your life I say Lord
[1:27:54] give us preaching give me give me the
[1:27:58] word of God that exposes the traps of
[1:28:01] the devil in my life and if he's trying
[1:28:03] to ENT trap me or ens snare me expose
[1:28:06] him Lord expose him for who he is don't
[1:28:09] let him hide under the cover of
[1:28:12] camouflage but expose him in my life in
[1:28:16] every area of my life oh I just want to
[1:28:18] ask you could you raise your hands and
[1:28:19] say Lord expose the devil and all of his
[1:28:22] workings in my life
[1:28:26] you know David walked right into a
[1:28:28] satanic trap and
[1:28:30] ensnarement I think we've learned more
[1:28:33] about the attack of the Enemy by through
[1:28:36] David's life than any other man in the
[1:28:39] Bible and David comes to a place in his
[1:28:42] life and you know the story very well
[1:28:45] when he walked right into a trap and he
[1:28:48] was called he was called and you notice
[1:28:52] that if you read all all the way through
[1:28:54] and this is this is this is important
[1:28:57] and I don't really have time to get into
[1:28:59] this here on a Wednesday night but if
[1:29:01] you look and you read through 1 Samuel
[1:29:04] before you ever read about the sin with
[1:29:06] bath Sheba you know what you should do
[1:29:08] is go back and read the leadup to the
[1:29:13] entrapment CU often times that's more
[1:29:15] important than the Trap itself when you
[1:29:17] ask what what happened how did you get
[1:29:20] to this place not just where you fell
[1:29:23] but what condition were around your life
[1:29:25] what was happening that that led you to
[1:29:28] this place and you know what happens to
[1:29:31] David and he was this was at a time when
[1:29:35] he was at he was he wasn't he wasn't in
[1:29:37] the caves he wasn't running he wasn't
[1:29:40] hiding he was well Todo he was well off
[1:29:43] he was healthy he was strong financially
[1:29:47] just fine or you could say he was on the
[1:29:50] high right he was he was on a high not
[1:29:52] on a low amen sometimes we're on a high
[1:29:55] and sometimes we're on a low this is
[1:29:57] David at a high amen remember he'll
[1:30:00] attack at any season of your life and he
[1:30:02] comes to David in what you could call a
[1:30:04] high time of his life to where he just
[1:30:06] seemed like he had everything he wasn't
[1:30:09] running no longer a fugitive no longer
[1:30:11] living in caves you know and and running
[1:30:14] from the enemy but now he's at a he's
[1:30:18] well established he's well he's he's
[1:30:20] he's secure he's solid his family his
[1:30:24] life his home I don't read anything that
[1:30:27] I could find that was necessarily what
[1:30:30] you could say is in disarray or out of
[1:30:33] order but David now he's not in
[1:30:36] depression he's not writing Psalms of
[1:30:40] discouragement he's he's not writing
[1:30:42] Psalms to you know of of of of ofy of
[1:30:45] enemies trying to destroy him but he's
[1:30:49] he's at a good time he's when life seems
[1:30:51] to just be flowing right and everything
[1:30:54] going
[1:30:55] good and and he's blessed and he's
[1:30:57] prosperous and he's loved and he's
[1:30:59] adored and he's the great king and then
[1:31:02] Satan comes right in the moment of that
[1:31:06] great Victory right in the right in the
[1:31:09] moment of the height of that great
[1:31:11] victory of what you could say for David
[1:31:14] would be a high time in his life and
[1:31:16] David is Victorious he's conquering he'd
[1:31:20] been fighting on the front lines you go
[1:31:22] read and in first Kings I think it's
[1:31:25] chapter 12 and David had been fighting
[1:31:28] chapters before that he had been
[1:31:30] fighting uh the Philistines and and and
[1:31:33] he had been getting Victory I forget the
[1:31:35] army that he had just defeated and he
[1:31:37] had not fully defeated them and he he
[1:31:40] had he had gotten Victory and they had
[1:31:42] almost wiped out the entire Army but
[1:31:45] there were some left over and so a
[1:31:47] season goes by in his life and then the
[1:31:49] Bible says and it came to pass at the
[1:31:52] time when Kings go to war yeah so here's
[1:31:57] a season of David's life when he's at
[1:32:00] War he's fighting and now winter comes
[1:32:02] and there's a time of peace and he's at
[1:32:05] home he's in the castle and there's no
[1:32:07] war and then it comes to pass at the
[1:32:09] times when every other year David would
[1:32:12] Saddle Up he'd get his armor he'd get
[1:32:15] his sword he'd get his shield he'd he
[1:32:18] we' wait for his leaders and his
[1:32:19] commanders and his captains and he would
[1:32:22] go to battle except this time he stays
[1:32:25] home yes amen except this time David
[1:32:29] decides for whatever
[1:32:30] reason to stay in
[1:32:33] Jerusalem and it's at this moment when
[1:32:35] the rest of the army are off battling
[1:32:38] and off to war that David finds himself
[1:32:41] in his castle not at War not fighting
[1:32:45] with his sword down remember not not
[1:32:49] necessarily backsliding I hope I can
[1:32:51] just say this here today I I I don't
[1:32:54] have the authority of the scripture to
[1:32:55] say this is ex we don't have the details
[1:32:58] to this but let me just just preach to
[1:33:00] you here for a moment to say wasn't
[1:33:02] necessarily a time of where David's
[1:33:04] backsliding or do anything necessarily
[1:33:06] wrong he's just not at his post of
[1:33:10] Duty amen and you know it's so important
[1:33:13] to be at our post of
[1:33:15] Duty doing what God has called us to do
[1:33:19] and not off on the sideline somewhere
[1:33:22] you say brother but I'm not doing
[1:33:23] anything wrong
[1:33:24] not necessarily didn't say you were but
[1:33:27] are you doing what the Lord has called
[1:33:28] you to do wow are you on the front lines
[1:33:31] when it's a time of War when God is when
[1:33:34] when God is expecting something and
[1:33:36] others are depending upon you on amen
[1:33:39] amen but I'm not I'm not brother you
[1:33:41] don't understand brother Matt I stream I
[1:33:44] still stream and I'm I'm I may not be
[1:33:46] there physically but I'm still streaming
[1:33:48] with you guys and I'm I'm still praying
[1:33:50] and I'm not
[1:33:51] backsliding I better preach is from down
[1:33:55] here they can still see me on the camera
[1:33:59] though but I'm I'm just but are are you
[1:34:01] doing what the Lord's called you to do
[1:34:04] that's question when you should be at
[1:34:05] War when you should be standing with
[1:34:07] your comrades amen question
[1:34:15] amen where you at David where what
[1:34:17] what's what's happening in your life
[1:34:20] wasn't necessarily he was backslid and
[1:34:22] off doing something that shouldn't be
[1:34:24] doing but he wasn't at his post of Duty
[1:34:28] when God had called him to
[1:34:31] war when God had called him and said in
[1:34:34] like Ephesians 6 Paul says put on the
[1:34:38] whole armor of God well why put on the
[1:34:40] armor if you're not going to war

[1:35:13] to have something to quench the darts of
