coming out I know it's been a long week and long work and all the cares of life that come up but we come in here to worship a prince of peace amen and almighty God that sees our lives and knows our thoughts and knows our needs it sees the inner things that we don't talk about to anybody else I mean I was praying with brother Dwayne in there and I believe God has sent us a gift does a man and that man is a gift and that man has a gift and the Holy Spirit will use him if you'll trust if you'll believe listen we'll get out what we put in we'll get out what we expect if we come here expecting nothing we'll get exactly that we'll get nothing except for the grace of God remember when we come in and we're pulling and we're drawing and we're expecting and we're saying Lord speak to me speak to my family speak to our situation that's when God moves on the scene amen he loves to hear his people cry out he loves a people that'll say his word back to him and say Lord we're depending on you Lord we're trusting you this evening and this weekend to use brother Dwayne to minister to our hearts and our lives so as he comes I want us to just sing that song Holy Spirit welcome welcome Holy Spirit do we know that one let's sing that and you just put your need before him don't look at the man don't look at the men I've talked with him for an hour today he showed up at 2 30. we talked for an hour and then he went downstairs and had quiet time and studied and prayed before the Lord he knows nothing he knows nothing about anything we caught up and we talked about the weather mostly and how it could possibly change for the better so he knows nothing absolutely nothing tonight so whatever you hear that's for you that's from God that's from God that's what we're expecting that's what the supernatural does in our midst is it sees the things that we don't talk about and it comes in and it touches us it encourages us and then I believe there's healing tonight I believe there's Deliverance I believe there's discernment I believe there's direction there's leadership whatever you have need of tonight encouragement whatever you have need of in this weekend I believe God's here to meet that need amen so let's sing that song Holy Spirit [Music] welcome me [Music] this very hour Holy Ghost we welcome [Music] back [Music] you know [Music] oh now come in power [Music] just one more time let's just sing it real prayerfully is that your desire tonight let's make him welcome I I certainly Jonathan's right don't look at the man he's just a little farm boy that's all he's ever been with no education it's nothing that I can present other than Lord here I am but if he's here as long as he's present I'll tell you what brothers he can meet he can exceed all of our expectations tonight and I believe that he wants to do that for us so let's just welcome now you welcome him to to your seat you welcome him right to your heart this evening don't just welcome him to the building but make them welcome right where you live let's sing it prayerfully together [Music] so now come in power this very [Music] oh holy ghosts [Music] Heavenly Father Lord how good it is to know that your God that keeps your word you said where two or three would be gathered in your name there you would be in their midst and when I look across this congregation father Lord hearts beating Souls filled with your spirit Lord men and women that have been gathered Here In Your Name Lord not in the name of a church but in the name of almighty God father I believe you love your family I believe Lord you're here to meet their needs Lord I pray I know you're here to walk amongst us Lord speak to us this evening Lord start with me tonight father Lord as I yield my being [Music] father [Music] control tonight and that Lord every aspect every life that's presence Lord may be some aren't here tonight maybe they're online Lord you know where they're at you know where we're living tonight you

found as a sweet smelling Savor in that nostrils Lord we love you tonight we want to commit the rest of the evening to you Lord be glorified in our midst is our prayer as we each one of us Lord as we humble ourselves Lord we ask that you would take complete control in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen and amen God bless you Saints thank you to the Musicians God bless you and you are a blessed people it is good to have good musicians so I'll just say I I had to go open my door back there I was enjoying it God bless you all excuse me sound tech I'll give you two seconds I call good sound man praise the Lord you know it's just uh you just excuse me I like I said I am brother Dale what are you doing here my goodness I mean I could see him coming God good to see you brother God bless you uh you know I I this is my of course my first time why don't you just take your seats for a minute we'll get acquainted and then we'll get into the word and of course first time on the east coast of Canada I've been since the Lord called me I have been blessed to have been in a lot of places and brother Dale we go back a long long long ways and of course brother Jonathan I do too but he's starting to get the same kind of haircut that I got but brother Dale and I kind of understand each other and you know we were all yeah I know you sisters you look at me and you know us old men now but we were once young like you guys you know we're here at Jonathan last time him and his wife were around my place you know here they had these couple of children about that big and you know just growing up and and kids and now I look at them and here's this beautiful young lady and and there's Jonathan and he's just about as big as I am of course that's no big accomplishment just in case you're wondering we got all the you know all the young people in our church all you know they all they like to come and shake my hand and they immediately look up to see you know where have I beat them have I got past him yet and and uh well I'm I would like to say if I could have had my way I would like to have been six foot you know you know big strap and handsome you know that's what my wife always wanted big strap and handsome rich I said I don't know what happened but somehow she got none of the above the only thing she got is a uh you know someone that's that the Lord has been able to mold a little character into along the way and I'm sure thankful she stuck with me through it all and I'm happy to have my wife sister Connie with me tonight and I shouldn't normally embarrass her but why don't you just stand so the people at least can have I know I know but we're just a handful and I'll just be honest you know if we're family of God then I just feel like family that's that's how I am and you know it's um I'm not maybe as friendly as her dad no maybe some of you know brother mental freeze and years ago there was a group called The Believers saying you know I'm saying all the gospel songs and and Ritz wrote so many of their own songs and you know for years they were probably one of the only message groups that sang and I just happened to marry um I want to say the main one's daughter but he wasn't he was just one of the singers but he became a pastor of course you many of you know him as a pastor brother mental Friesen from Saskatchewan I had the privilege of marrying his daughter he's pastored now for my 40 243 years something like that I'm guessing and and uh just this last year uh you know he said well you know what um I've put in a lot of time already and it's time for it's time for somebody else to carry the load and it's not like you know it's not like he's hanging up his coat so to speak we still use them still has a ministry that's one thing about you know some of the Saints we get a little older and we think well God's done with us now and and I'll say this um I don't is brother Lush here tonight he didn't come well I sure am looking forward to getting to meet him uh you know those men you saints that have put in I don't want to call it just put in time but it's been you brothers and sisters that have you know you're hewed down out here you blew up the rocks and pulled out the trees and and you made the roads and and now you've given us something to run on you know this glorious gospel what would it be I'll just say this you know there I I really feel this way in my heart there's nothing there's nothing more glorious than for a daddy to be able to look back and see his children following in his footsteps you know that's the desire of every every daddy is to see his children following in his footsteps and you know Brown makes a comment one time and of course I'm in a message church so I can say brother Brandon said I I think that's all right I I'll just be honest I believe that there was a messenger and I believe that we shouldn't be ashamed to use his name I don't believe that he came to point to himself he came to point us right back to Christ who is the word who is still alive tonight and I'm so thankful that he's given us something you know spiritually we have something to run on but but what would happen Brothers if that message never would have caught what would happen is if we would have just remained as a as a Baptist or a Catholic or or or a Pentecostal as lovely a people as they are and I'm not saying anything against the people but what would have happened if that message would not have caught and dropped into your life because it took I want to say this it took a fresh Flame it took a fresh flame Pentecost had already burned down and and when you begin to look at what that has produced in the last 50 years look at where it's gone maybe when it originally maybe it didn't get too far off but look what it's produced in the last 50 years and we look at their children and we look at at their families and we look at their worship and and the complete sodomy and the and the horrible things that we see right behind the pulpits in their churches and then we can thank God that God did send a message we can thank God that there was a that the light of God moved and there was somebody when the message came there was somebody that could receive that message and walked live that life live listen church I I don't know about you but I've I hear this spoken Lawson and now if I step on anybody's toes I certainly am not meaning to tonight I don't know anybody so I'm just going to be me if that's all right and and when you don't if you don't like it just send me home it'll be all right I'll love you anyhow and but but I hear this so often you know we get to preaching the message the message the message the message and I believe there's not one of us sitting here but doesn't believe the message uh but I'll tell you what the message is not just a word or a letter or a Doctrine the message is a life the message is Christ we have listen this is the Bible but it can sit on every shelf in this country in this part of the country and if it does not if the if the life of this word does not get into somebody it means nothing it's just a dead letter listen you can have all the tapes you want you can have we've got every message available to us we are the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth but if the life of the word does not find a being to live in this the Bible says the word was made flesh and you say well that was that was Jesus brother Dwayne but listen he also he went away but the body of Christ now lives and the word is still being made flesh you are the word of this age God you are the manifestation of the sons of God of this age and so what would it be if these brothers had not taken and received that word and their life had not come into it and lived in front of you come on brother some of you are some of you are younger than I and if you hadn't watched a life that you could look at and it wasn't like brother Branham said you know that that drunk man and his little boy how they went out at Christmas and he was you know he's just in all of his uh all he was he just went out to enjoy and and fellowship with the neighbors and he took his little son with him and and you know it went from house to house and and there they had a little you know they shared their cheers I know each each house got another cheer and then he had another drink and and then he got another drink and pretty soon you know he got walking along and you know he he just he couldn't quite he was trying to walk he thought he was walking straight but you know and then one at one point he looked back at his son and he watched his son doing the same things you know kind of he's like what are you doing what did little boy tell him Daddy I'm following in your footsteps I'm following in your footsteps now I thank God I want to rest my case I thank God for Godly men who didn't stagger this way and stagger that way but they walked a straight line so that you and I I'm not talking about these Elders here I'm going to look at the the younger generation sitting at the back sitting at the back my goodness only thing I can think is brother Jonathan warned you that that I drool and slobber and spit when I preach and that's probably why I told you it all sit at the back so you love the Lord tonight hey man I I certainly feel the same just let me bring you greetings from home from Saskatchewan in case some of you don't know that's still part of Canada we're kind of like tie everybody together and uh from the church back at home brother Meadow and the Saints there just uh you know I've I guess I've been I've been officially voted in to be their Pastor now and and so I'm realizing that the role as the role changes so does the responsibilities and and brother Dale of course you knew me when I've traveled much when I was on the Evangelistic field and so many years ago the Lord called me matters of fact um uh you know he I can I can tell this testimony now I told it I used to tell it I don't actually I didn't used to tell I only told it a couple times because it's an actual reality of my life and but of course you know young married and and um just happy you know I was a happy Christian happy in the Lord and had a beautiful wife and had a little family and then then the Lord you know you know how sometimes when when you when things start changing in your life you know you get unsettled and you don't understand why and nothing seems to be satisfying anymore you can't quite understand why and and I you know it's not sometimes sometimes it's not really anything except God trying to get a hold of you trying to trying to get your attention to do something and and so sometimes we get we struggle with those things and anyhow I had I had I had the Lord deal with me in a way you know I was Deacon in the church and my wife was the piano player and of course my father-in-law is the pastor and a I'm just a just an average working boy just the same as everybody else and and uh I was in one of those places where just something wasn't setting and I couldn't I just couldn't finally I told my wife uh you know all my buddies lived out in farming country and and there was a brother out there who sold farm equipment and he used to be a friend of my family and so he used to come all the time and every time he'd see me say brother Dwayne when are you coming to work for me when are you coming to work for me and I didn't I'm going to be honest I my dad had a couple cows when we grew up like 20 or 30 cows but I didn't know anything about farming or farming equipment or anything like that but I got to the place in my life where where I said you know what um honey if brother Dave ever asks I'm gonna go and of course she's a flat out City Girl you know that likes to shop and likes to go for tea and coffee and all those things and you know how God puts opposites together any of you married people ever understand anything about that yeah some of you under you know what you're talking about God you know what you know why because God knows that only love Only Love Will persist and anyhow the reality is brother Dave did come and ask me again I met him one time and and he asked me and I'm like oh my word that was about two months after I said that to my wife and I looked him in the face and I said oh my Lord Brother Dave that's exactly the same statement I told my wife two months ago and he just looked at me said well I want you to pray about it and I want you to then I want you to make your decision let me know because I'd like you to come so we moved to a we're about to move about two hours away from home and um I was going to work one morning and I was wondering Austin it just dawned on me I mean here's my family and all the people I love and my wife's family in the church and I'm going into the middle of nowheres to do something I know nothing about the people I love the church it was different than ours and and you know and sometimes we we struggle with things like that and I'm driving I'm driving out of my driveway and I'm thinking Lord what am I doing and God is my witness I'll tell you what I had this little old beater car and uh just driving it to work and I'm thinking Lord what am I doing two little kids a wife a church what am I doing and just as clear as I'm talking to you of voices to me you're going there to preach and then it made a statement you're going to be the new pastor I didn't have nothing like that even in my mind ever that was the furthest it never even entered my mind that I would be preaching the gospel and so I laughed out loud as awkward as this sounds I I literally I was in my car and I was like I actually said these words and Lord forgive me I I it was so loud it's so real to me and I I say it was allowed like this it might not have been audible but it was that loud in my car and it was that loud to me and I started I actually laughed out loud and I said that's ridiculous and I moved to conistino at some point that never left me at what that voice spoke to me never left me I could never get away from it and within a couple years in you know the man that was a pastor at the time or overseeing the congregation I mean this burden was just all over me and I thought this is ridiculous I I'm not a preacher I'm a I'm a farmer or I'm my dad was in all my dad's they're all in construction all my family is business people I'm not a I'm not a preacher I couldn't get away from funny one day I threw up my arms I said Lord I don't know what to do but if this is you calling me then you'll have to ask brother Dave to ask me because there's no way I'm going to go and ask him wouldn't you know it he has an accident on his four-wheeler and he ends up in the hospital and he's laying in traction whether he's my boss and he's a big man about 350 pounds and he's laying with his leg up in traction like this and of course we're very good friends so I I mean he's my boss but we're friends and so when I went into this hospital to see him I just stood at the door and I started laughing and of course you know he rode Polaris and I wrote something else and so I began to just banish her back and forth and he just stopped me just like that like we're just in the middle of it and he just looked at me says when are you going to preach for us I like to died 29 years ago he told me I'd be a pastor and today I am so that doesn't make me anything any different than anybody else all I'm saying is that what God speaks he keeps his word when God it doesn't make me any I'm just the same ordinary person that I've always been but when God speaks he keeps his word and so I told him I would never if he's calling me then I'm not the kind of person to go and you know it's really interesting I don't I don't even know why I'm saying this tonight this isn't I'm not I was never the kind of person that was afraid of anything except this to hold the purchase of God's blood in your hands scares me but the Johnson said you get nervous I said every time every time because I know that I don't know how to do this but I know he does so anyhow you uh I trust you came with expectation that the Lord will meet your need tonight and I didn't say all that I hope I hope I hope didn't sound like I was saying that to make me something I was just saying I didn't never expect to be behind the pulpit but if God ever speaks something you will never run far enough listen you might say well God only speaks to prophets no he doesn't no he doesn't only speak a prophet is the Divine interpreter of the word but God does not just only speak to prophets God speaks to people that little still Small Voice Samuel Samuel what was that that same God still lives that same God still lives I just believe that with all my heart and so tonight um if you got your Bibles with you I hope that was you got a little idea of who I am now and and how oh please don't I hope I didn't say it the wrong way I get I get all nervous when I say stuff like that that it makes me look like I'm oh you're I actually never I you know when I gave that testimony I told two different people this is terrible but in my journey I told two different people two different men that were pastors I didn't understand that I was just a boy and didn't understand what that meant and so I was I was only looking for Direction but every time I gave that statement it would be like and that would be the last and I would Minister very little after that so after that I just backed up and I thought well Lord I don't know what is going on but I know you're in control of my life and so anyhow I'm not afraid to give the testimony anymore because it's history and it's true and I think I don't know why I said all that tonight but I do want to read a scripture and it hadn't I see now it ties perfectly together and that wasn't in my notes at all so would you stand with me wow I'd rather I'd rather have just walk down and shaken all your hands and got to know you and I guess we'll get to do that this weekend anyhow if you got your Bibles with you turn over to First John chapter 3. first John chapter 3. why don't we start at verse one and brother have you got verse one there by any chance you do why don't we start at verse one I was asking the Lord trying to find the mind of the Lord for the weekend and for the services and sometimes that's just not so easy and you know your mind's going every time Lord no I just need a Direction Lord I need a direction and so um anyhow why don't we begin to read here first John chapter 3 behold what manner of love the father hath to bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God and therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not hold on you know Saints I I don't think we should just read over that I think we need to look at that really seriously tonight I believe this word of God brother I'm told us this is a love letter to us there's only going to be a certain elect group of people that are actually going to understand what the spirit is saying and so I I want to go back and just read that again and I want us to see how the wording is on it because this is if God is speaking to his elect lady then look at how he addresses her behold what manner of love father hath bestowed upon us that we now you can just put your name in there tonight that we should be called sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not verse Two Brothers beloved now I don't know about you but I think that's somebody that cares a lot for us beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is let's add a blessing add that God's blessing to the word tonight Heavenly Father once again Lord we just come again looking for your direction tonight father knowing Lord that your word is life and it is life to us father so ask the Lord that you would meet our needs according to your the great banquet table that you set in Jesus name amen and amen God bless you can take your seats tonight and yeah you know I I think when we get looking at the scripture sometimes you know I think our Humanity maybe uh gets the best of us we read these things and we we almost if we're not careful friends we get to looking at it we just read over it like it's a newspaper and you know and you know we just one page after another page and while I've done my devotions and I close my Bible and and away I go but but if we ever get into the spirit of the composer if we can ever enter into the spirit and I think it's so important when we're uh you know as as we're as we're walking with the Lord I think it's so important that that we take time to get in his presence uh you know I know there's times when life is busy for everybody but you know there's times when you're you're driving down the road and you've only got 20 minutes so you you know you push play or you turn on a Bible app and you listen while you're driving I think all those things are good I got nothing against any of my I believe God gives us these things because he knew we'd be in a busy world but there's times when you need to pull away I say this I don't believe just twice a week or three times a week I believe you need to do this on a daily basis we need to pull away and we need to get in the presence of God and just let the Holy Spirit begin to reveal himself to us just let them begin to to make himself known you you know what I'm talking about that real sweet presence of God when he comes down it just begins to bathe your soul and he begins to make himself and all of a sudden the word just becomes life it just becomes so real to us and I got to read in this scripture some time ago and and I got to thinking about you know we it's it's hard for us if we're honest it's hard for us because we look at this so much this flesh being has uh you know we're so we're so caught in these in these senses that we live in and everything about this world is tangible and if you were honest you got up in the morning and and you had a list that was that long to do your feet hit the floor and already you were engaged and I got to get this done and this done and this done because tonight he's got church coming and we've got to be ready for church and we got to leave at a certain time and we've got to have breakfast and dinner and supper you know our mind is just it's everywhere is right and and so and in that all of a sudden the pressures of it and we get under we get under pressure and then we find ourselves we slip and we say things wrong act wrong and and you know we respond wrong and then when we we hear the scripture speak like this and now are we the sons of God I'll tell you what maybe for a veteran it's not it's maybe not so hard but for for The Young and the middle age growing through finding that peace in God in in a time when you're wrestling with your flesh when you're fighting against listen all hell is against what we're standing for tonight all hell is against you tonight all hell is against you and I coming to the Revelation that right now we are the sons of God this it does not say anything about that you are going to be the sons of God listen church we are not waiting for a Rapture to make us sons of God we are sons of God right now and if you're like me you're going to struggle with that thought you're going to struggle with your flesh and you're going to look in the mirror and say oh God how could I be a Son of God and look at the way I am this this wretched vile person you know Paul said the same thing he said all this Wretched Man that I am we're not going to do good then Evil's present and what I want to do I don't do and what I shouldn't do I I end up doing but listen church that has nothing to do with your position in Christ or if we could just get if there's one thing that Satan doesn't want us to know it's the reality that right now this man right now despite every mistake I made this week has not one thing to do with the fact that right now I'm a Son of God right now you're a Son of God why because why because not just because he purchased you if you're a Son of God now you was always the son of God you would have had been in his thinking in order to be a son now you had to be in his thinking then so when we catch the reality of predestination you can say yeah thank God I'm a son thank God I'm a son why there's a blood sacrifice that stands in your stead don't you think Papa God knew what kind of condition you and I were going to be in when we got here don't you think he understood listen you and I might not have known this there was a time when the sons of God shouted for joy and and we might not have known this but listen God knew what sin was going to do and he knew what kind of a situation you and I were going to be in therefore the Bible says the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world he knew what kind of position he knew what kind of battles we were going to fight and the blood was slain then why so that you and I could completely go free you could say well brother Dwayne I don't feel free tonight that is not one thing to do with it the reality is the blood was shedded if you have one time been born again by the spirit of God then you are a free man either the blood of Jesus Christ is good for everything or it's good for nothing you can't say the blood is good for SIN number one and sin number two and sin number three and when it gets to sin number 10 oh my I don't think the blood covers that there's only one thing the blood doesn't cover and that's blaspheming of the Holy Ghost every other thing the blood covers and I'm not saying make Grace a disgrace tonight by no means I don't believe in making Grace disgrace God's given you Grace you walk in it but as a Son of God as a daughter of God you know you're going to fall you're going to make mistakes you're going to come up short and I'm here to encourage you tonight it has not one thing to do with your Redemption nothing listen if you're going to be judged if you are going to be judged as the elect lady I'm not talking about foolish virgin I'm talking about as the elect lady if you are going to be judged on your works the grace of God was nothing it's irrelevant uh if if you're looking somehow to work your way into heaven and if you and if you think that your good deeds or your bad Deeds are going to exclude you from Glory the grace of God becomes irrelevant as foolish virgin your Works will have a lot to do with it but as the elect Lady it's the grace of God and the blood covers it all oh my aren't you glad tonight he sees nothing all he sees you is is that brother Brown said this there's a blood covering around the world and God can all when he looks down at Red through red he sees white he sees white and it don't matter how often Satan comes and bangs on his door so to speak and begins to accuse you but says this he doesn't see any of it but he does hear your voice he does hear your voice he hears every time that you get down on your knees beside your bed or every time you get in your car and you're driving off to work and the spirit of God becomes and not to convict you he doesn't come to condemn you he just convicts us hey son that wasn't right hey daughter that was you you shouldn't have been there you shouldn't be in those places he only comes to convict us because he loves us Hallelujah you know what Saint John 14 says this at that day you shall know that I am in my father ye and me and I in you at that day you shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you you know what so many times we get I I maybe like I said I don't know what what's been taught or what hasn't been taught but I want to say this you know sometimes we we find we get to we get to hunker down on the godhead in different different types of doctrines and and you know I was visiting with the brother and you know He was discussing his point of view and I was like well you know what I don't quite see it that way brother Brown says it's different and so we're just back and forth a little bit and when I walked away it was like you know what here we are and and you know we we got this the Trinity Doctrine out there and and completely tells us to come out of the pits of hell right the Trinity doctor completely come out of the pits of hell I said this I said you know listen it doesn't matter if it doesn't matter if you believe that God himself Was Here and Now Jesus is here it doesn't matter as long as you don't catch the Revelation that Christ is in you it don't matter you can believe that all of God was in Jesus and Satan knows that but for you to accept that all that all of Christ has been poured into his bride Now That's what Satan doesn't want us to know that's what uh yeah we can have it here but when it sinks down to here now we have a problem because now he realizes he has nothing he has no hold on you anymore you realize I all at that day you will know that I am in the Father the father in me I you and me and I and you what day is he talking about when we get on the other side as you talk about when we get to Millennium this is that day this is that day there comes an hour when the sons of God actually recognize their position who they really are listening Brother Brad makes a statement I think in the church age book he says when she recognizes what she is you go look it up he's talking about the bride he says when she recognizes what she is well what is she what is she if she's part of him and he was God then what is she she's called too listen the god that is the god it is not one two three or or or a million or whatever it is he is one and we are part of that Oneness of God we're part of the Oneness of God so when we get to looking at these things we we you know we realize Satan doesn't want us to realize Who We Are Tonight I want to just jump down how many members of story a job job was the greatest man brother Brown talks about him highly the scripture says he was the greatest man that walked in the face of the Earth and we all know the story how one day Satan come out before God and said hey have you considered God said hey have you considered my servant job listen your trials are not about you tonight the troubles that you're going through are not about how do you know that God In His Infinite in the infinite Mind Of God how do you know that Satan himself didn't come walking before God and God said to him hey where have you been well I've been down on the earth walking to and fro and and just where have you been oh I've been down what they call Newfoundland I've been down on that well have you considered my servant Bob I was going to get it wrong I'm real good at getting it wrong Bob have you considered my servant Bob oh sure but you got them all hedged up oh he's a song leader he's got a good job I don't know if he does or not but he maybe he's retired by now he's got a great job you know he's got a lovely family I mean you've given him the desires of his heart of course of course he's going to serve you okay well you go ahead and touch them because I promise you the seed that I put in that man there is no way that he can ever deny me you can take his health you can take his family you can take his riches you can take everything about him but he will not deny me oh yeah watch just yeah just let me Adam listen Church we're like actors playing out this great drama of God we're like actors if we could step back before time began and maybe we were in the eternities and now I'm just this is just my own Imagination Running Wild so you just forgive me if it doesn't sound quite right but listen if we could step back into the eternities when God listen there was a time when the sons of God shouted for Joy come on and they shouted for joy and there they were the morning Stars sang together so there's this reality you know he said well where was I well I was just in the mind of God yes but the mind of God is as real then as you are now well I wasn't in a being nobody you were just as real in God's mind as you are sitting here tonight absolutely so so here we are we're in this great drama and job finds himself in the same position and I don't know if you all know what it's like to lose everything or awful close to it but I'll tell you what God knows how to take us listen the Bible says job was the greatest man on Earth the greatest man on Earth turn over Job chapter 30 if you got your Bibles I'm just going to take you to a situation where here's a man that I'd say this like this he loved the Lord he was in good standings with everybody around him God had blessed his life God had blessed his home God had blessed his family God had blessed his job he was he was a wise man he was respected by everybody I mean it's the kind of man that we all want to be that we all want to be and yet the day comes and God and Satan comes before God and he Taps him hey where you been oh I've been down there down on Earth well have you considered my servant job and we know the story literally God allowed everything we allow God literally some we get such crazy ideas in our head when things are going good we're saying well oh praise the Lord I know I'm a Son of God I know God loves me I know God cares about me but what about when things go wrong what about when things go wrong the love of God doesn't change but everything about how you feel and everything about your emotion and everything that thought that the enemy can put in your head it can all change the way you feel but it'll never change your Eternal destination now let's just jump into Job chapter 30 and here's a man that you know they used to wash his steps with butter if you go and read the rest of the book you'll find just how wealthy he really was we catch job at a low point in his life and he says this but now they are they that are younger than I have me in derisions whose fathers I would have disdained people are talking about the bottom of the barrel They're laughing at him now he says whose fathers I would have abstained I've set with dogs of my flock yea where to might the strength of their hands profit me in whom old age was perish was perished for want and famine they were solitary fleeing Into the Wilderness in former time desolate in waste who cut up Mallows by the bushes and Juniper roots for their meat they were driven forth from among men listen these people are this is like this can I is this the wrong word to use scum this is no I I don't this is like the lowest end of the Earth these people are the bottom of the barrel as far as the as far as their reputations are concerned and job was saying and now these people in my position these people laugh at me now that I've lost everything these people are laughing he says he says they they were driven forth among verse five they cried after them as a thief to dwell in this in the Cliffs of the valleys and caves of the earth and in the Rocks among the bushes they braid under the Nettles they were gathered together they were children of fools yea children of basement they were vile than the Earth now listen to this and now am I their song yeah I am their byword in other words they have made they have made job as nothing they talk about job like dirt and God spoke about job as the greatest man on the face of the Earth you see the two differences listen and and job is literally he's he's seeing what they're seeing God is already in in all of his derision in all of his and all of his losses and all of his and all of the hurt that job has been remember job job was saying oh man it's better if I wasn't even born he got to the place where his life wasn't worth living anymore where his wife was and here he's saying now they all are looking at me like this they had bore me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in my face because he had loosed my cord and Afflicted me they have also let loose the Bridle before me upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet they raise up against me the ways of their destruction as they Mar my path they set forth Calamity they have no helper They Came Upon me as a wide breaking in of Waters in The Desolation they rolled themselves upon me Terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and my welfare passes away as a cloud and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of my Affliction have taken hold upon me my bones are pierced in me in the ninth season my Sinners take no rest my great force of my disease as my garment changed it bindeth me about as the caller of my coat he has cast me into the mire and I am become like dust and Ashes now listen to this verse number 20. I cry unto thee and thou Dost not hear me I cry unto thee and thou Dost not hear me come on Church you ever been in a spot like that when everything has gone wrong and it seems like God is is so far away here we're talking about the greatest man on the face of the earth a friend of God and he's in the same position and he's saying hey I Cried unto you God and you don't hear I cry unto you and you know I stand up and you don't regard me at all that thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand though thou oppresses thyself against me thou lifteth me upon the wind thou causes me to ride upon and dissolve us my substance for I know thou will bring me to death to the house appointed for all living how be it he will not stretch out his hand to the Grave though they cry in there in his destruction did not I weep did not for him did not I weep for him that was in trouble now listen job was actually saying listen God did come on brothers did I not pray for them did not stand in the gap for them did I not help them financially and now they've turned their back on me listen my soul I did not I weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor when I looked for good then evil came unto me when I waited for light then came Darkness my bowels boiled and rested not the days of my Affliction prevented me I went mourning without the sun I stood up and I cried in the congregation a brother to dragons a companion to owls my skin is black upon me my my bones are burnt are burned with heat and my harp also is turned to mourning my organ into the voice of them that weep job's not in a good place is he job's in a hurting spot job's just a he's just a red-blooded man like we are and things listen just because things go wrong doesn't mean that God is angry I say that tonight just because things go wrong doesn't mean God is a just because things go wrong doesn't mean that you were wrong job wasn't wrong in his walk with the Lord job was right in his standing with God but still God was looking for a testimony that he would listen brother that whatever I did there's no way I can make that man curse me there's no way you'll make him curse me that man loves me and he will love me unto the end what a testimony I'll tell you what that's the kind of testimony we ought to have tonight that regardless of what goes on regardless of the Past come on Church you don't think brother Dwayne doesn't know what he's talking about rather right now I know what it's like to be in job's position I'm not job but as a young man I know what it's like to be covered with boils from top to bottom I know what it's like to not have nobody touch me because because my because I would bleed through I understand that as a married man I know what it's like to have all your substance taken from you he said what are you talking about brother Dwayne brother Dwayne was a farmer I was a farmer we had about 300 and said we raised what we raised elk we're game farmers one day I get a phone call from the government saying hey did you buy some animals from a from a certain Farm I said yes we did well that's unfortunate because they've been infected with chronic wasting disease now we've got to come to your farm I know what it's like to have my whole living destroyed right in front of my eyes and wonder how am I going to feed my family how am I going to pay my bills what am I going to do Lord I don't understand what did I do I know what did I do to deserve this Lord have I made a mistake have I done something wrong I know what it's like to go before God and wonder Lord what is it but just because these things happen doesn't mean that you've done something wrong don't let Satan stand and bang you up don't let them knock you on the shoulder don't let them whisper in your ear that this is your doing this is your cause how do you know that God doesn't have a greater plan I'll tell you this evening I know God had a greater plan he called me to preach the gospel and as long as I would feed those animals I would have been a happy man but I would not have gone and preached the gospel I would have stayed right where I was so he literally had to take it all from me what to get my attention now I don't believe he needed to get job's attention he was just testing job but I know what it's like I know what it's like to have my children taken from me I understand that not in the way job did but I understand this and Mom and Daddy it's not one thing you did if you've raised him as much as you knew how if you've raised them as good as you knew they still it'll take the the almighty power of God to save their souls you as a daddy will never save your children's Soul you as a mommy will never save it will take the grace of almighty God and Lord help me to walk a straight enough line that they can see it Hallelujah but I understand it and job sometimes you know sometimes you can just get so down in a pit in your own life that now everything you see above you is just darkness and gloomy and black and there's there seems like there's no hope there's no there's no encouragement there's there's no nothing nothing and job was at the same spot Lorna I'm calling on you Lorna Lord I'm looking to you lord lord where are you I need you to talk to me again sometimes the spirit of God leaves and he doesn't come back for a long time what's he doing he's testing you brother he's testing you to see do you really believe me even if I'm gone are you still going to believe me yes you're going to believe him why because the seed is in your heart you can't help not believe him you'll hang on you will still pray you will still worship even if you never felt God's move on your life you might have been sitting for five years ten years whatever but you will constantly look and say Lord I am waiting I'm still here Lord Lord I'm waiting on you to come back to me I'm waiting on you to deal with my life Lord I need another filling of the Holy Ghost Lord I need more of you in my life and you will hang on and hang on and hang on what are you waiting on you're holding on to the Word of Promise You are holding on to the Word of Promise and he's not a man that he should lie brother he's God and he keeps his word Hallelujah I believe that I believe that you just keep on knocking like that you don't like that little woman she just kept on knocking she didn't quit knocking we don't just go a day or two or three and say well I guess God doesn't love me oh no I'll be in church on Sunday I'll be back in church on Wednesday Lord you'll find me Bob on bed on Monday night on Tuesday night on Thursday night on Friday night every opportunity I get I'm gonna go I'm gonna live my life I'm going to be a testimony Lord if you never speak to me not one more time I will testify of the glory of God everywhere I go I'll sing of his glory I'll tell of his goodness I'll tell him his love I'll tell what God has done in this generation I'll tell him the message that's been said why because he'd done something for me and you can't deny it since you can't deny it not one of us can deny that God has changed our lives we heard Baptists were not we're not Catholics we're not methodists we're not Pentecostal the new age we're the old-fashioned Pentecostal right right there 120 that come out of the upper room we got that kind of God in our lives listen not everything goes good in our lives church so just because we're Christians let's don't get thinking that well God's just going to bless my life and I get to drive the new car and have the beautiful house and have the big you know the big business and the big job the big vacations and come on that's not being just a real Christian God can do all those things but if you live on Peanut Butter and crackers and you have to live in a stick house you would listen I got a brother at home right now God bless his soul boy been backslidden for years finally the Holy Spirit took his hand took his hand and put it on his life mommy and daddy don't you never quit praying for your children don't you never quit praying I got a young man standing a young man he's

you you be careful who you marry you be careful who you get who you who you uh associate yourself with the boys of this world pigs let me just say that they're pigs you might not believe that but it's truth they will whine you dine you make you feel like a princess and they will they'll take what they need and they'll leave you on the side of the road somewheres and then you'll wonder oh God whatever happened to me what here's this young man let me tell you the testimony of this young man what I'm thinking about here's a young boy walk away from the Lord years and years ago married you know he found a found a girl going he always wanted to marry a believer but he was kind of an awkward kid and had bad complexion and he just didn't know how to walked away from the Lord and one day he's in the grocery store and he sees this pretty young lady walking by she's got long hair she's wearing a skirt he marries her now he's good kids what are the old how is the oldest honey 12 something like that four beautiful kids this young man I say this in his upbringing his daddy taught him one thing that was important make sure you pay your ties son pay your tithes pay your off and that's the blessing of God in your life even as a ranked sinner he continued to pay his tithes and his offerings and God began to bless his life and I'll tell you what he would what we would say Brothers lived the American dream he had everything that you could have desired the cabin at the lake the big boats all the toys all the vacations the big house on the acreage everything to pristine and not owed a penny on nothing oh wow wouldn't we love to live like that right but this thing down here that one little part that God reserved from for himself was missing in his life and it didn't matter what he went where he went what he bought how far he how far down the tube of sin he slid it just kept getting more hungry and more hungry and more hungry a couple years ago we had a prayer meeting at church I don't know if I'm ever going to get my notes tonight but we had a prayer meeting at church a couple couple of the brothers were just real sincere his brother shows up at him just a handful of us there his brother shows up and he says brother Dwayne I have such a burden for my brother right now that had the dozen of us or whatever that were there we got together and we just began to call upon the Lord listen in two weeks time less than two weeks time I got a phone call from his daddy Who's down in the in the United States vacationing and he's just broken he says you'll never believe what's just happened to me to my son he said you will never believe what just happened to him literally the Holy Spirit come down made him so miserable he finally threw his hands in the air said Lord I don't know who you are anymore but I want that God living in here Lord I need you I need you and just like that listen Brothers listen just like that he tells me brother Dwayne just like that every filthy thing that I ever did in my life every filthy thing that that held me in bondage was gone and I had this peace and this joy and it just it began to Bubble he he went back to tell his wife that this big fight and and he goes back and tells his wife he says I'm done as of right now I'm giving my heart to the Lord Jesus and she looked at him said and you do and I'll leave you she wasn't a Christian and she's a nice little lady you do and I'll leave you he said well I am he said you can do whatever you want but I can't I can't turn down what just happened to me something has happened in my life and I can't deny it I can't run from it I'm going to face it he finds himself in church and there by the grace of God let me just tell you by the grace of God I'll tell you what that home has literally Satan has literally he made this statement to me when after he got saved brother Dwayne he said if I had to sleep in a cardboard box on the street if I can keep what I have

wise man and the princes of the Earth would come to job for counsel go back and read the book of Job the wise men of the Earth would come to him for counsel so job was a wise man and in all of job's learning and all of his wisdom and all of his understanding there is something that job did not know there's something that job did not know and you and I are sitting here tonight with the answers

will demand an answer a demand of thee and answer thou me where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth declare it if you have understanding you know what that Revelation wasn't given yet that Revelation wasn't giving but you and I are sitting here tonight under the sounding of the seventh Angels message with the revelation of God that has been broken and we could be asked the same question where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth and I would say I was in him then but job didn't understand that he didn't know anything about that here's God speaking to him where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth declareth thou Hast understanding who has laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon the Fastener the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy listen where were you job job you yeah yeah you you had it all and now you're complaining about the day you were born and you're complaining about how bad you got it you're thinking you're that somehow that that you're not a son anymore you're thinking I've turned my back on you so let's just have this little conversation I'm just going to impart a little Revelation unto you job listen you might be down and out but I still have never left you I have watched you walk through the valley of the shadow of death and I promised I'd never leave you and I wouldn't forsake you and here you are job now if you're so intelligent and you got so much Revelation then tell me where were you where were you at Brothers where were you at sisters tell me where were you when he laid the foundation of the world we can sing I was there Hallelujah I was there I was one of the sons of God that shouted for Joy I was one of the one of the morning stars that sang I was there Hallelujah no Ephesians 1 says this it's speaking of Paul says this in Ephesians 1 verse 3 said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen us as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world Karma Brothers Karma sisters that we should be holy and Without Blame that we should be holy and Without Blame this is so it doesn't matter how much Satan drags your past out and tries to haunt you with your past it is irrelevant the blood has already been shed he already ordained it that you and I could sit here tonight and be holy as he is Holy be perfect even as I am perfect he said Lord why would you ask me to be perfect look at my life I'm not yes you're perfect you're not perfect in your flesh you're perfect through the blood Hallelujah be recording as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah what an hour to live and listen brother Brown would say this he'd say speaking of I'm speaking of election predestination brother Brown would say this he said see how this works God is all has God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam has his thought Adam as his as his thoughts was yet unexpressed and Psalms 139 speaks of it I'll give you a little idea of this of this my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in the secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth that eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and the book uh and in thy book were all members written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet was none of them that as I've said I was not written about Adam I was not written about Adam but it gives you an idea the knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when Adam was formed of the Dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam listen close church then Adam became God's thoughts expressed then Adam became God's thoughts expressed and those Eternal thoughts were now manifested down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah a John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season God's Eternal thought expressed and when we come to Jesus the logos he was a perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as what we know as the word that is what he is and forever will be now in him now it says that he hath chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that that gives an eternal quality to the left Hallelujah brother says this he says he says now I don't care what my daddy done what my mama done what anything was all the father gives me will come to me and no man can come lest my father draws him Hallelujah why did he know them for I foreknew them before the foundation of the world when I slayed the lamb I slayed him with the lamb Amen brother Brown says I predestinated the church what's got for Destination the church how do you get into the church by one Spirit baptized into one body he knew before the foundation of the world that we would be there and those who he foreknew he has called those he is called he's Justified and those who he's Justified he's already glorified oh my he's already Glory what is Justified we sing that little song I'm sure you sing it here justify justify I haven't done it in the first place Justified why because God has never reckoned your sin not one of them he's not seen one of them because you're his children Hallelujah in God's book he said he'll done meet me right there there ain't enough Devils out of hell can ever keep him away uh keep him anywhere else but keep him from coming right there because God has said so and that settles it now listen he says if a hundred billion years before the world was ever formed the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy before there was a foundation in the world before there was a foundation and them angels and everything was happy shouting about it before there was a foundation in the world how is the devil ever going to keep me in the dust of the earth he just can't do it oh my I mean we might think of that as in a as you know when we're laying in the grave but but listen where's the real you anyhow where's the real me anyhow come on what is this what is this flesh being this this thing is the dust of the earth you are born Out of the Dust of the earth I was born Out of the Dust of the earth my whole makeup is from the dust of this earth and the god that listen the real you is not the flesh man the real you is on the inside it's that soul man that God put on the inside and what's going to keep it the dust the Earth your it don't matter it don't matter what kind of family you've been raised in it don't matter how wrong you went it don't matter what kind of uh uh I'm bringing you've come out of or or what kind of situation what's going to keep the soul of God from rising back up to where it came from nothing nothing there ain't nothing that Satan can put on you that will keep you from becoming what God has ordained you to become which is the sons of God listen we can't be something now we're not we've we've been told this over and over why be something that you're not don't never be a hypocrite be what you are all right well you're born to be sons of God you're born to be children of God daughters I'm a I'm a son of the king I'm a daughter of the king then let's act like Sons let's act like daughters let's conduct ourselves like Sons conduct ourselves let's talk like him let's walk like him listen if the genetics of God are inside of us why are we going to act we're going to act like father we're gonna walk like Father we're going to talk like father and listen does that mean that we're not going to fall down and make mistakes yes you're going to be why because you're battling this right here you're battling this flesh man but rise up sons of God rise up recognize what you are you're not I'm not just Dwayne fair that was born to Bill and Dawn Affair uh you know the contractor from Saskatchewan no I'm a Son of God I might have been born to a Contractor on this Earth but I was always a Son of God and I've got to come to the recognition that tonight right now I am a Son of God I'm not going to be I am already I'll tell you what sometimes we look at our our frailties and when you look at Noah man he was what a great man what a Godly Man and there he was you know God had spoke to him and said Noah I want you to build an orca I'm going to destroy the world here goes Noah and he's faithful landed for 120 years he's Faithfully building an ark born after board after all the ridicule all the people that turn against him all the you know all the the newspapers make fun of him and all the talk radio talk about him all his friends walk away from him what does he do brother take whatever you want but you can't make him deny me God's gave him a commission here's Noah building the ark building the ark building 120 years later standing faithful to the call of God what a man of God when God calls him in the ark Noah goes in the ark God closes the door and judgment strikes the Earth we say oh what a man what a man of God there he is and you know riding over the storms of life in this in this god-constructed bulk and Lord I did it just how you said Lord I brought the boards just how you said I pitched him the way you said and the storm that doesn't matter how great this storm of life is you you promised You'll Never Leave Me Lord you realize there was only one window in the ark you know God never put Windows along the side like we would do you know we want to watch what's going on God didn't put your window there I don't care what kind of storm you're in tonight God don't put Windows on the side of your Ark he put a window so you got one place to look and that's look up listen God don't get in one nor seeing what was going on because it was death it was destruction it was bodies floating and it was everywhere as you looked it was people screaming and crying and they were drowning and they couldn't walk they couldn't climb high enough animals were dying everywhere God didn't want us he didn't want Noah looking at death listen he don't want you watching what's going on around you either look up look up God's got a boat constructed it's called his word look up that's the only place we've got can you imagine this here's Noah this Gallant prophet of God that was so obedient to God and you know sometimes I I preach this at home sometimes you know we get this little picture of Noah we we we're so prone to to artists Renditions and stuff you know here that the Bible talks the flood is descended the Waters of it you know they've abated and of course the ark rests down on Mark on on air at Mount Ararat or whatever it is here's Noah puts the Gangplank down now what's the artist's rendition there's the beautiful rainbow oh my God's covenant promise and here's the Lush beautiful new Earth the green grass oh my the flowers blooming and how the sun is shining in the bright and Cloud listen it's gorgeous you know the big arcs ramp is down there stands Noah looking out over come on Church God had literally destroyed every living creature on the face of the Earth you think Noah was looking at a beautiful big you know a green plateau and and it was just the birds are chirping and singing it come on it's reality check dead bodies everywhere dead bodies ever you think I I used to own a meat shop so I have a little idea what dead animals smell like they stink till they make you throw up they may you want to vomit it gets so bad it's just man of God who has stood faithful God has carried them over there he is gets out he's heard the screams and the cries of his friends his family has the Boat Lifts off you think he's not a man like us you think that wouldn't torment them you think it wouldn't have bothered him that was his family his friend his community there he is gets over and the Gangplank lays down dead animals dead people dead oh my word and then we read the story about Noah there he is in his tent brother Brown would say this and Noah died a drunk and Noah died a drunk are you kidding me how does that work brother Dwayne this man of God this man of God who for 120 years stood faithful never wavered there he stood faithful God literally kept his promise to him gets on the other side and he dies a drunk let me tell you something Church Noah was no less a Son of God as he laid there in the tent that night maybe trying to drown his Sorrows maybe trying to call me I don't know for what reason but he was no less a Son of God than when he stood at the door of that Ark and said repent because God's going to bring a judgment on this Earth you're not a son of God today and not a son of God tomorrow if you are a son of God you are always a Son of God God will not listen God's not going to impute iniquity unto Noah why but blood is made a covering for him God knew he was always a son of God you cannot be a Son of God if you're if God's called you if God is if God has put the seed of God in your heart you are always a Son of God we look at it you look at Rahab the Harlot come on Church you look at Rahab the Harlan and they're the life that she was living and how awful that day after day and all the regrets and all the oh all the horrors she had to live with it she would have to hold her head down and she couldn't even walk and look at people she couldn't be in people's presence hardly you think that you think she was any less a daughter of God living in that condition than she was the day that that that that Joshua and his men came in and they rescued her God's Own word has her lineage her name written right in his word and here she was a come on a street prostitute a street prostitute trying to make a living trying to hold her whatever she had together it rejected by her own family and yet Gods would look from on high and say I see a seed in that little woman I place the seed down in the muck and it's going to come out the sound the words going to get through it all we've heard about you we've heard about the great Army of Israel and this God that always he's always there fighting their battles and there's fear over a whole land but listen I believe that message I believe what he told me God knew where she was all the time would make her a queen would make her a princess if I could say it that way Solomon's daughter Solomon would Solomon would take her as a as a wife and there they would establish and she would find her own name in The Very lineage of Jesus Christ come on you you can look at your own life tonight you can look at him you would don't look at what you're not don't look at what you're not look at what he is look at what he is there was a there was a bloodstream that she would hang down a little red scared according she would hang out of her window why she would Proclaim there's something between my sin and the Judgment of God and that's this bloodstream she could hold it there until she took on the very name of Solomon listen Church you're not your own tonight you didn't come here in the name of a church I don't care if it's evening like Tabernacle Saskatoon Tabernacle Church of God Tabernacle I don't care what the church name is you have one name and that is I no longer call you church I call you Mrs Jesus Christ why you are now the Bride of the Living God God's not looking at all your mistakes he's not looking at all of our shortcomings right now we are the sons of God we're not going to be we are right now oh you say brother Dwayne I know all about those all about those wonderful you know those wonderful testimonies but what you say well yeah but look at my life okay come on let's just let's just bring it home let's just bring it home where we live here we are preaching out of a message of a Vindicated prophet one that you and I would die we would die for this message you and I would hold the banner of it and say I believe God sent a prophet William Branham is his name not one of us is ashamed to make the proclamation we believe God sent a prophet and we would look at that man and you would look at his life and see a supernatural God how God would raise up the dead how God would call a little fish back to life how God would speak to a storm and we would uh you know third poem Ministry we would look at this man and we would so admire the life and how day after day night after night he would discern the thoughts that was in his heart discern this life tell her where she came from and what she'd done wrong tell them where he's living and what he needs to do and the we'd see the Holy Spirit use him in such a great way but well it's hard that's the Son of God that's a that we know that's a Son of God that's like the first not the first fruit but that's the wave sheep that that that's been waived over the congregation hey that's what all mature sons of God should look like we look at it we say oh I know that's the Son of God that's a manifested Son of God but look at my life Lord what am I but you just need to rewind the movie screen just a little bit and take his life as a boy born to a drunk a man who would murder take a little boy whose temper he gets so angry because somebody ran over his dog that he literally wanted to kill him a man who would get who's whose wife would be taken from him as children he gets so depressed he'd crawl up on the power pole and say God forgive me for this reach out his hand to take his own life so discouraged so discouraged the man would come by and said Billy what do you think of your God now that's your wife and your baby are gone he'd have to say it's not me keeping myself it's him keeping me talk about a young boy that would stand there after he got beat up stand in the face of a half a dozen young boys with his 22 rifle and say which one wants to die first I'm going to pull the trigger and literally pull the trigger not one shell goes off was he still a Son of God then come on he was always a son of God and it don't matter how low you get it don't matter where you have been it don't matter what you've considered it don't matter where Satan is dragging you to right now you're a Son of God you're not going to be sis you're not going to be a daughter you are right now A Daughter of God Hallelujah was so prone to look at our our natural being we're so prone to get caught and Satan has the access to this he has access to our mind so he can come when he just begin to the Warfare that goes on and not one of us is immune from it we all fight with it we all battle with it listen if a prophet of God battled with it how much more you and I he wanted to take his own life he wanted to take his own life it might not look like a Son of God but it was Son of God just the same now are we the sons of God Hallelujah it's okay what about Abraham this mighty man that God called a friend father of the faith well that's definitely a Son of God because God God come down right down and talked to him like Hebrew that's definitely a Son of God well it's easy to look in the book isn't it it's easy to go back and look in the Old Testament and say oh yeah that was the son of God yep that was a son that was a daughter of God yep that was a Son of God yep that was a daughter of God and a prophet would come to you and tell you this Old Testament was written for your admonition and for my admonition you know something about the Old Testament the Mighty Men the great man you can see all their faults the great women you could see all their mistakes but just run over to Hebrews chapter 11 once and not one of them is shown by faith why the blood was shed God seen none of it as long as the bulls and goats it could be written but once the blood was shed it couldn't even be written oh hallelujah hallelujah Church where does that make you tonight sons of God perfect in the sight of God Hallelujah but Brown would say this he said it he says if you got the Holy Ghost you're God's child your Abraham seed you've got an unconditional Covenant Written In Your Heart by God Almighty himself who can't take it back oh my he says you can't take it back amen he swore he wouldn't do it every promise in the Bible is mine every chapter every verse every line I'm trusting in he said there's not one of you deserves the grace of Jesus Christ none of us we're all together but God by Grace has did it anyhow that's right there's none of you deserve your healing every one of us ought to die me too all of us we're not we just we're not deserved to live on earth that's right we're not deserving to look at God's creation but God has promised us and he cannot lie he swore he would do it healing belongs to us amen salvation belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven belongs to us now we are the sons of God now we're sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there's nothing can harm us the same God now listen close the same God that was watching Abraham in his mistake he made Abraham pay for it don't think you'll get by with it but God did not cast Abraham out he just made him repent listen if the devil is hounding you tonight and telling you that you've done something and God can't forgive you for it let me tell you something The Amazing Grace of Jesus Christ is here today just as good as it was 2 000 years ago Hallelujah I like that now now now it's present church now is present tense don't don't wait to become a son or daughter of God right now we're Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah oh I'm so thankful tonight all right Brethren would say this he said I might have I'm a part of Charles Branham because I was born from Charles Brown and my daddy I'm a part of him I've got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I'm in nature like him because he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God nice and close deity dwells in the man what's deity Church that is God that is God and if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwells in the man Hallelujah you talk about blind eyes being opened they said nothing is impossible to God God said nothing is impossible with you if you believe it said not with God but you deity is in the man the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform the eternities and rolled the worlds off his hands created these things give you a privilege to be his son and you are part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Hallelujah Hallelujah that's hard for us to swallow we can looking at our flesh and say no brother Twain I just can't be I just yes you can you don't even use that word I can't God never uses the word I can't there's nothing impossible to God nothing he said I just don't see it brother doing them take it by take it by faith because he said so take it by faith because he said so deity dwells in the man God has become a many membered body where he can walk and talk and where he can where he can make up himself listen we all make up the body of Christ the many membered body of Christ he says there he says now listen he says he says you're part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Hallelujah he says there you are it might choke you but study over that a little while see is God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not him in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation Hallelujah I don't know about you but I get happy when I start reading stuff like that you know what that is that's thus saith the Lord that is not brother Dwayne's thoughts that is neither Dr Dobson's thoughts or or some other great man's thoughts that's not you know the president of the United States or the prime minister of Canada that is the thoughts of almighty God spoken through the mouth of his Prophet Hallelujah it might choke you but study over that a little bit a little while he says God dwells in man and man becomes a Son of God not him and himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with unwavering faith and ask what you will and it'll be done unto you there is their God is Hallelujah what's he trying to get to us what's this whole message been what's what's Christ been trying to do Christ the mystery of God revealed who is this little bride she's the mystery of Christ revealed she's the expressed image of God and Satan does not want you to recognize who you are where you've come from what you're doing here what God wants he doesn't want you to recognize the very power that's placed within you brother makes a statement he says you've got enough power in you to create worlds and go and live on them it's only harnessed by faith if you could believe it how what are we tonight Church what are we tonight now are we the son we're not going to be this is it's not some crazy Doctrine it's a reality of the age we're living in he said that she would become she would become so much like him she would be in his very image why the two shall become one the two shall become one says this he says you know what the problem is he says if you only know he says that's what the matter of the church is tonight it doesn't know its position if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes oh my oh my there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes he said the thing of it is you're looking off into a millennium for something to happen when it's all ready here now are we the sons of God when it's already here now we are the sons and all we will be we are right now when right now this night this minute we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ oh if you would only recognize that listen close the supreme authority that Jesus Christ has given to every believer mommy are you listening tonight Grandma are you listening tonight well just to the preach just to the prophet well that's what we said well then just to the ministry that's not what he said every believer every believer that means you Mama that means you Grandma every I can say that because I'm a grandpa now every believer every believer that means you sonny you're 10 you're 12 years old that means you the supreme authority is given to every believer whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it it'll be given unto you Mark 11 24 says whatsoever things you desire receive it why do we get so caught I'm speaking I'm speaking from myself tonight too I'm just like we're just all the same we're all the same we're all doing one thing fighting the good fight of Faith contending for the faith but lots of times we find ourselves like Gideon there we are you know we hear it we've been told over and over and over Gideon knew he was in Israel Gideon knew he was no he knew that he had a position he knew he would come from good genetics he could trace himself all the way back and say I know I'm in the line of God I know I'm a son of God I've been told my my pastors told me this for 30 years I'm a son of God and then something goes wrong pretty soon the amalekites move in or the midianites move in or whoever it is moves in and there you know uh you know all of a sudden the economy begins to change and things aren't happening and and now your very testimony is getting put on you know it's on the it's on the chopping block and pretty soon instead of standing bold you're you're you're all bowed down and and you're busy you know making your bread where nobody can see you or keeping your testimony to yourself because I I just don't I don't think anybody really I don't it's probably not that important anyhow and listen the Bible says they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their brother Dale their testimony they overcame by the blood of lamb and the word of their testimony young ladies your testimony not Mama's testimony not daddy's testimony not brother luscious testimony your testimony they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony there's there's you know Gideon there's hiding away he's doing what so many of us who so many of us do we get down and we get discouraged and instead of speaking the things of God instead of speaking the word of God speaking life we begin to speak all the wrong things uh forgive me for this but I used to have when I owned a meat shop a little little sister walked in one time she'd come to visit every occasion pick up stuff and every time I would ask her hey sis how you doing oh brother Dwayne just terrible oh I got this wrong with me I got that wrong with me every time she'd come in it was something different and would you pray for me I'd pray for her and I one day she walked in the shop and it was something different again she asked me will you pray for me I said no and she's like well why not come on Gideon come on Gideon why not because your confession you will never be healed because I've got tuberculosis well I got diabetes I got cancer I've got I've got I've got as long as you're come you're com you're claiming you're claiming or complaining about it guess what you own it you own it but when you begin to Speak Life hey I might this is what the doctor's saying God but by his stripes I'm Healed I'm not denying that what the doctors are telling me is true but I've got a God that heals all my diseases I go to God That Forgives all my iniquities I'm more than an overcomer in this life listen it's not gonna I'm gonna rise up above this and Gideon had to have somebody to remind him one day listen you don't belong now get what you're doing with your testimony why are you always testifying negative why are you always down why you know I'll tell you why I'll tell you why brothers and sisters I got in the truck one day and I got in this this pickup truck and a man I love dearly and I respect him to the uttermost jumped an instructor ride with him and I'm hanging out with him for the day and he stops to jump out of his truck to go get something in the store and I just I don't know why I did it but I did he jumped out and left the truck so I just reached over and pushed his radio button I want to know what he's listening to you know what he's listening to he is forever negative I've always got to be trying to encourage him and trying to encourage him and trying to encourage him and trying to I'm like man you know what he's listening to talk radio the prophets of Doom the prophets of Gloom because everything about talk radio is negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative and negative it's never positive and as you're going to feed on that you're going to what you eat is what you become I'll tell you what all you need to do is get you need to shut your radio off and go ahead and push play you've got almost 1200 different messages of God speaking to your heart and the voice of God how does faith cometh by hearing of what oh talk radio oh no it's portray no it doesn't come sports radio it comes by the hearing of the word well you know I have brother Dwayne I just encourage myself in good music good music is good the word brings Faith the word brings Faith the Holy Spirit only feeds on the word of God faith comes by hearing well brother Dwayne I come to church on Sunday morning and if I could make it Wednesday I show up and I don't know why I have all these problems in my life I just can't seem to get over it get over it sons of God guarantee you if this country would have known if I could if I could jump back 70 or 80 years and prophet of God would have been invited to this country you couldn't have got in this place early enough I heard him say on a message the other day they were there at three in the morning waiting for just the door to open just so they could get in and how do we do well I don't know what you hear but I know how they do at home and you could live next door to the church and they don't show up until just about five minutes before church we came expecting I can tell did you pay for that seat you know maybe we ought to you know back in I think it was Wesley's day or one of those days you know that that the rich used to pay to sit on the front seats I think we need to start charging again because now it's almost like they pay to sit the back seats that's being a little silly but we're sons of God we come to meet with the King we come to meet with the King this is this is Father we're talking about and regardless of what the devil is telling me about my life he's a liar he's a liar he can say but brother Jonathan it is true it is true I watched you do that I can tell you where you did it I can remind you of the details of what happened there I know you did that and Jonathan you can look straight up look him straight in the face and say I don't care what you're talking about it didn't happen what does Justified mean as though you've never done it in the first place it didn't happen Gideon had to be reminded that hey Mighty Man of Valor get in you mighty man of Valor who me

listen Brothers Satan will destroy your life he will try and destroy your life he will rob you of your testimony if he can just get you to believe his lie it's a lie Mighty Man of Honor Gideon the Mighty Man of Valor it's not grinding behind the bench no more he's right where everybody can see him well Lord but I want the whole congregation to go with me no that's not how it works Gideon I am your portion my Lord you don't understand I'm a poor man my brothers are poor my family is poor I I really don't got nothing to offer you I feel pretty comfortable behind my little my little my little bucket of stone and at least they leave me something what a shame on us brother Dwayne shame on you can I remind you something Gideon your children need Mighty Men of Valor because they're living in bondage and they need to be set free God's calling on you Daddy's it's calling on you who's going to save your children hopefully the preacher oh no oh no don't you expect the preacher to save your children you go after them yourself you go after them yourself the spirit of God raises us up sometimes we need to be reminded Gideon get out from your little block show yourself as a mighty man of Valor God take away the fear you know why the little church in the wise Church hasn't risen up like it ought to you because we're still afraid that God won't keep his word but he's not a man that he should lie God is God and he will keep his word listen we are not called here to be we're not called to be foolish virgin we're not called to be the ones that are left destroyed and this world burnt over we are right now the sons of God we're not waiting to be the sons of God we are right now the sons of God you know what that gives you dominion over girls that gives you dominion over everything that this world can throw at you every evil dirty thing that this world could throw in your face it gives you dominion over Brothers it gives you Dominion to live a life in front of your family that is such a I want to say this it's such a high calling such a high calling that your children can look and say I you know what I know my dad is a Christian I know my grandpa's a Christian I know they're sons of God if I could be in like anybody I want to be like them it's not a shame daddy listen it's not ashamed to Fall on Your Knees and take your children to prayer they ought to know that's how it works they ought to know that Daddy holds a sword in his hand he wields a sword and when he begins to pray that God begins to answer mama I always say it I'm going to encourage you the same Grandma you take those little children pull them around you you can still love them and you begin to take those advantages to talk to them about the things of the Lord every little opportunity you get and take them around and begin to pray and they'll say I know my grandma she talks to God and I know God hears her prayer why because right now right now we're sons of God we're not waiting to be we are now the sons of God God said just come speak come bring your burdens to me and I'll carry him for you why because he's a loving father just like you daddies do you carry your burdens for your children so does our heavenly father do you love him tonight I might as well just close right now I might as well just close right now if the if the musicians would take the the the instruments we've been called to a high calling Church we've been we've been called to a high calling we might have been you know Gideon might have he he might have got to the place where you know in all of his in all of his anger all of his anxieties and all of his fears he might he might have got cowered down and I say this sometimes Maybe maybe we've had things go so wrong in our lives too and it feels like God just doesn't speak anymore feels like I pray and there's a block and I pray and there's another block and I pray and there's another block and I can't just can't seem to break through and Lord what's the matter with me and don't you let that devil make you afraid remember Daniel remember Daniel I don't know why I'm here tonight but I am you remember Daniel he prayed earnestly and for 21 days he never got a reply 21 days he never got a reply but when the angel replied he said I heard your sis just whatever you have on your heart something soft he said as he says I heard you the first time I heard you the first time as soon as you prayed I heard and so did God hear your prayer the moment you prayed God heard your prayer the moment you prayed but we're not just fighting with the Demons of Daniel's day Daniel fought with the Demons of his day but this day the lid has been pulled off of hell and there's billions of demons out there I'll tell you what and almighty God will bankrupt heaven to keep his promise to you why because you're a son because I'm a son because you're Daughters of God not one time not one time I'll say it this way in closing when Adam fell in the garden nowheres do we read that Adam called though for God but we hear a prophet of God say this that when Adam fell that God literally instead of sending an angel so he had Mighty Man you talk about super beings you talk about incredible uh supernatural beings and here's a here's here's a son in the garden has fallen and God could have just said that he said any one wormwood go down and go on go to go down and rescue my son I'd say wormwood probably wanted to go rescue his son but you know God said no no this is my son I'll go take care of him I'll go take care of them and God came himself for his son God will come himself for his children tonight God will come himself for his children tonight get in what's your need tonight what's your prayer you think that the Holy Spirit isn't here right now he's here he's here the lid might have been pulled off hell but that wouldn't stop God from reaching out to you realize that ladies wherever you're at in your life God knows exactly where you are and he cares would literally bankrupt heaven savior to make sure that when this world is over that you've got joy unspeakable and full of Glory we come for you what's your need tonight Church mama daddy maybe it's the children and it's the grandchildren maybe for some of you it's health I wonder if we can pray tonight I'm sorry I'm not up there I I'm just getting comfortable when I'm not far away from people I mean you say when you love God's children when you love my children I believe he's here tonight to meet our needs you believe that tonight I don't know why I feel this way but I think as much as we can why don't you close maybe somebody that you love or something that somebody that we can do this with just reach over and get a hold of their hand your families Hallelujah let's bow our
