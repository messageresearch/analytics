[33:51] based on a finished
[33:53] work Lord we're already placed next to
[33:55] you as joint teirs
[33:58] Lord we just have to go through this
[33:59] little bubble of Time Lord I pray you
[34:02] just strengthen us this evening Lord
[34:04] that you'd encourage Us by seeing where
[34:06] we stand Lord in your presence Lord
[34:08] where our souls sit this evening Lord by
[34:11] the Heritage that we have as Sons and
[34:13] Daughters of God lord I pray that as the
[34:15] word would come forth Lord that it would
[34:17] Quicken our minds Lord it would change
[34:19] our thoughts Lord it would change our
[34:21] very bodies Lord and bring them into the
[34:23] subjection that your word offers
[34:24] Heavenly Father Lord Lift us up to
[34:27] higher Heights Lord anchor us a little
[34:28] deeper strengthen us encourage us Lord
[34:31] God I pray tonight we ask it in Jesus
[34:33] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[34:37] turn if you would to First Peter chapter
[34:39] 1 1 Peter chapter 1 good to be back in
[34:42] the house of the Lord we certainly have
[34:43] some New Finland weather going on and
[34:46] then I was saying I left to go to Ed to
[34:49] Montreal in Edmonton it was sunny and 20
[34:51] degrees and I came back and I don't
[34:52] think we've hit it since so I got the
[34:54] best before it left but we're certainly
[34:56] into uh the fall now amen couple
[35:00] announcements uh brother Mark will be
[35:02] taking the service on October 16th while
[35:04] I'm away in Charlotte Town PEI he'll
[35:08] probably finish up his redemption or or
[35:10] continue his Redemption uh teaching that
[35:12] he's been doing and I actually got some
[35:14] time to finish it myself there today
[35:15] really enjoyed it and had a number of
[35:18] scriptures already in here that we're
[35:19] going to touch on and maybe go into some
[35:21] more specifics than what he did but uh I
[35:24] just certainly enjoyed it and trusting
[35:25] that you all are as well I got good
[35:27] report
[35:28] anden sister Katrina but from Springdale
[35:30] sent us a letter uh this this week and
[35:33] and just wanted us to pray for her she
[35:35] said she she'd Fallen away and she's
[35:37] come back to the Lord and so she's
[35:39] living in Springdale and so I don't know
[35:41] if she's listening here tonight or if
[35:43] she'll listen but I say she's always
[35:45] welcome to come visit we have lots of
[35:47] beds available we have lots of houses
[35:49] available for fellowship and to host her
[35:51] so that all she has to do is get here
[35:53] and we can take care of the rest so God
[35:55] bless her amen I believe we're at the
[35:56] the very end of of time amen there's
[35:59] people that have to come back because
[36:01] when that last one's sealed then we get
[36:02] to go amen so just trusting that's one
[36:04] more that had to come in before we can
[36:06] get out of here so that means there's
[36:07] one less that has to come in church
[36:09] we're one less closer one more closer
[36:11] than we were before we uh before we came
[36:13] into service tonight amen so I think
[36:15] that's just a wonderful thing and I I
[36:17] just pray the Lord will bless her fill
[36:19] her with his spirit and just feed her by
[36:21] the word of God amen amen it's good to
[36:23] have sister Kimberly back with us I know
[36:25] she hadn't been feeling well good to see
[36:27] her back in church and of course young
[36:30] Wesley as well amen God bless you 1
[36:32] Peter 1 and22 we uh we read this last
[36:35] service and we're going to continue from
[36:36] here it says seen ye have purified your
[36:38] souls and obeying the truth through the
[36:41] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[36:43] Brethren see that ye love one another
[36:45] with a pure heart fervently being born
[36:47] again not of corruptible seed but of
[36:51] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[36:53] liveth and abideth forever amen God
[36:56] bless you you can have your seats this
[36:58] evening and we're continuing our series
[37:00] on the Holy Ghost and I I want to take a
[37:02] second one on what is the Holy Ghost and
[37:04] then a second or a a third on the Holy
[37:06] Ghost and then and then what is the new
[37:08] birth for a second service and we'll
[37:10] we'll kind of wrap this up this this
[37:12] evening on on what is the new birth and
[37:15] I I haven't gone exhaustively into it
[37:16] but I just want to cover this maybe more
[37:18] so for the young people in particular
[37:20] and and some of those that are listening
[37:22] online that wonder about this and we
[37:24] know we read last service when Nicodemus
[37:25] came to Jesus Jesus said the there's a
[37:27] requirement to be born again you have to
[37:29] have the new birth if you want to
[37:31] understand God if you want to understand
[37:33] the kingdom of God then you need to have
[37:35] the new birth it was a requirement and
[37:37] we know that the new birth is a a work
[37:39] of God from start to finish amen it's a
[37:41] work of Grace never think for a second
[37:43] that it's it's something you did or
[37:45] something that I did or anything like
[37:47] that we may have parts to play in it but
[37:49] I didn't find God God found me I didn't
[37:51] call to God God Called To Me amen I
[37:53] didn't reach out to God God reached out
[37:55] to me and then I just responded to that
[37:57] and that that's why I can have the new
[37:58] birth and that's why you can have the
[38:00] new birth today and and that's the
[38:02] security I have church that SEC security
[38:04] we have today is not that I started it
[38:06] it's that he started it because if I
[38:08] went to him then I can walk away from
[38:10] him amen if I reached out to him then I
[38:12] can pull back amen if I was the one that
[38:14] started it then I'm the one that can
[38:16] finish it but since he's the one that
[38:17] started since he's the one that called
[38:19] since he's the one that reached out then
[38:20] my security is in his actions not in
[38:22] mine amen cuz God never starts something
[38:24] that he's not going to finish we know
[38:26] Paul said in Philipp he says being
[38:28] confident of this very thing that he
[38:30] which had begun a good work in you will
[38:34] perform it until the day of Jesus Christ
[38:37] now that means the work isn't done till
[38:38] we get out of here me that means that
[38:40] until the day we go then he's continuing
[38:42] to work on us and he's continuing to
[38:44] refine us and mold us and shape us and
[38:47] test us and try us to produce that
[38:49] character that's required of that end
[38:51] time bride amen that day of Jesus Christ
[38:53] is the day when he's United with his
[38:55] Earthly bride with his Earthly bride and
[38:57] so that's the resurrection that's the
[38:59] Rapture and until that happens he's
[39:01] working on us day by day but as soon as
[39:03] we go then that's it the work is
[39:05] finished and we get to go reign with him
[39:07] eternally but I want to step back a bit
[39:09] this evening as we continue on this last
[39:11] service to see what it means when we
[39:13] receive the Holy Spirit when we have
[39:15] that new birth and I want you to see it
[39:17] from the from the standpoint of what God
[39:20] has done and then what God is going to
[39:22] do because it's representative of a work
[39:25] that's already done and then it's
[39:26] representative of a work that's ahead of
[39:27] you and it's two different parts to this
[39:29] so if we look in Ephesians 2 and this is
[39:32] where brother Mark had spoken a little
[39:33] bit I'm going to take quite a bit more
[39:34] time on it this evening he says and you
[39:37] have he
[39:39] quickened that word Quicken means Made
[39:41] Alive who were dead and trespasses in
[39:44] sins so this is our original condition
[39:46] every one of us it's without life we're
[39:49] dead we're we're lost in sins and and
[39:52] even as good as our nature might be it's
[39:54] not good enough to satisfy God but it
[39:56] says here he quickened why who were dead
[39:59] in trespasses and sins this is not the
[40:02] quickening of the Holy Spirit here
[40:05] that's going to come later because he
[40:06] says wherein in times past you walked
[40:08] according to the course of this world
[40:10] this happened way before we ever came to
[40:13] him and what is it it's a quickening
[40:15] it's a bringing to Life by the work of
[40:17] Calvary it's a it's a quickening by the
[40:19] by the resurrection of Jesus Christ and
[40:22] we'll see what happens here he says
[40:23] wherein in times past ye walked
[40:25] according to the course of this world so
[40:27] we live the way the rest of the world
[40:29] did amen according to the prince of the
[40:32] power of the air so who's the influencer
[40:35] of this world it's not God it's always
[40:38] satanic amen we've got to realize that
[40:41] because if we can realize that then we
[40:42] realize we've got to need to come out of
[40:44] it we got to realize why we can't think
[40:46] the way they do we can't talk the way we
[40:47] do we can't act the way they do we can't
[40:49] get involved in the things they do
[40:51] because they're under the the influence
[40:52] of the prince of the power of the earth
[40:54] it says the spirit that now worketh in
[40:56] the children of Disobedience among whom
[40:59] we also had our conversation our life
[41:01] our living in times past in what the
[41:04] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[41:07] of the Flesh and of the mind and were by
[41:10] Nature the children of Wrath even as
[41:13] others notice he says our nature is
[41:15] Children of Wrath we were under a
[41:17] judgment sentence from God bound to pay
[41:20] from from on what we did and who we were
[41:24] that's where we were sitting before we
[41:26] were quickened amen everything that
[41:28] comes naturally to us in this life
[41:30] displeases
[41:32] God even the good things that we do are
[41:35] not satisfactory to God that's not what
[41:37] he's looking for amen that's a hard
[41:39] thing to say but when you compare what a
[41:42] holy God is to everything we bring to
[41:44] the table it's never holy it's never
[41:46] pure it's never righteous it's never
[41:48] perfect it's always imperfect and
[41:50] therefore God can't accept it and so
[41:52] often even our good things are wrapped
[41:54] in selfishness or greed or a desire for
[41:56] rec recognition or influence or these
[41:58] different things and so it doesn't
[42:00] impress God and it certainly doesn't
[42:02] change him it doesn't incline his heart
[42:04] towards us those things won't do it but
[42:07] he says now but God who is rich in
[42:10] Mercy the start of our work is Mercy
[42:13] Church it's not good works it's not a
[42:14] heart turn toward him it says but God
[42:17] who is rich in Mercy for his great love
[42:20] wherewith he loved
[42:22] us where am I in this verse Church where
[42:25] are you recipient
[42:28] only he loved me when I didn't love him
[42:31] he loved me when I didn't know him he
[42:33] loved me before I came into natural
[42:36] existence well see amen I don't have
[42:39] anything to offer I'm a worm I'm a
[42:41] sinner there's nothing here that that
[42:44] brings me into this it's his love for me
[42:46] he says even when we were dead in sins
[42:50] have quickened us past tense with Christ
[42:54] he says by grace are you saved now
[42:57] notice we've talked about quickening
[42:59] power we're going to talk about that a
[43:00] whole lot more in a future service we
[43:03] talk about we're quickened we're Made
[43:04] Alive by the Holy Spirit but I want you
[43:07] to see something here because this is a
[43:09] quickening by the for knowledge of God
[43:12] Alone it says while we were dead in sins
[43:16] we were quickened we were made alive
[43:20] that's something that's already happened
[43:22] we sang that song this evening I'm going
[43:24] to make it this is saying you've already
[43:27] ready made it you were already made
[43:29] alive way back when there was a changing
[43:32] of your Soul's condition from dead to
[43:35] alive and that's right there right now
[43:38] amen when God raised Christ from the
[43:40] dead he raised you with him he raised me
[43:43] with him he positionally placed us as
[43:45] joint HS with Christ even while we were
[43:48] yet in our sins
[43:50] physically that's where we're sitting
[43:52] tonight amen you when Paul's writing
[43:55] this to the Ephesians you have to
[43:56] realize that some of them would have
[43:58] literally been alive when Jesus was
[44:00] alive and then when he died at the cross
[44:02] and rose again and he's saying you are
[44:04] literally living in sin and at that
[44:07] moment that he died and when he rose
[44:09] again you Rose with him and you were
[44:11] quickened and you were placed into a
[44:13] place right next to him and you were
[44:16] living there you were fornicating you
[44:17] were worshiping Idols you were doing
[44:19] this you were doing that you were
[44:20] completely separated from him and yet
[44:22] you are positionally placed right next
[44:24] to Christ right then what a wonderful
[44:27] thing to understand church is that we've
[44:29] already been placed where we're going to
[44:31] be we're already sitting there amen we
[44:35] weren't even alive yet but we were
[44:36] placed the same way by the forign
[44:38] knowledge of God he says and ha past
[44:41] tense raised us up together and made us
[44:45] sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[44:47] that means we were down here but now we
[44:50] come here amen we weren't in an elevated
[44:52] position but by the resurrection of
[44:54] Christ by his overcoming power we were
[44:57] raised with him and were placed with him
[45:00] and we're sitting now in Heavenly places
[45:02] right there with us amen church that's
[45:05] his work from start to finish I wasn't
[45:07] even there to do anything and yet there
[45:09] he says I was sitting there there I am
[45:11] sitting today right now that's where I'm
[45:14] sitting is in Christ amen it's not
[45:17] waiting on how good I'm going to perform
[45:19] it's not waiting to see how good a
[45:20] Christian I'm going to be I'm already
[45:22] sitting there in Heavenly places with
[45:24] Christ Jesus tonight amen church this is
[45:26] the not a physical work this is a soul
[45:28] work amen my soul is sitting there I was
[45:31] so blessed when brother Mark was talking
[45:33] about it brother Mark I don't know if
[45:34] you heard I listened to the last portion
[45:36] today and I got to where you're going
[45:37] I'm like he's already where I'm going
[45:39] but I'm going to go a little bit deeper
[45:40] this is a soul work your soul was what
[45:43] it was bound by sin it was bound by the
[45:45] Fallen nature but God when he Roose when
[45:48] Christ when he rose from the dead he
[45:49] took your soul and he took it out of the
[45:51] depths of where you were Bound by
[45:53] judgment and he placed it right up there
[45:55] with him and so I have representation
[45:58] you have representation by our soul
[46:00] sitting in Heavenly places in Jesus
[46:01] Christ today that's where you're sitting
[46:03] tonight church amen you're sitting here
[46:07] and you're saying how can that be but
[46:08] your soul is already elevated your soul
[46:10] is already resurrected your soul is
[46:12] already living in a place of faith in
[46:15] the presence of God and all that's
[46:17] happening by the new birth is this is
[46:19] being quickened to a work that's already
[46:21] done it's already finished that's the
[46:24] glory of this I can't lose I can't Can't
[46:27] Fail cuz I'm already sitting in a place
[46:29] where I've won I've already received my
[46:32] inheritance it's done that's the rest I
[46:35] have this evening is it's already done
[46:38] hallelujah whether I fall tomorrow
[46:40] whether I stand tomorrow whether I get
[46:42] the victory whether I fail and one more
[46:44] time I'm already there and I don't have
[46:47] to worry about
[46:49] it that's where you're sitting
[46:52] tonight and you've been sitting there
[46:54] for as long as you never knew
[46:57] when you were born you were sitting
[46:59] there when you fell you were sitting
[47:01] there when you received Christ you were
[47:02] sitting there and today you're sitting
[47:04] there and your position cannot change
[47:06] you're a part of him you Rose with him
[47:09] amen amen our soul has been redeemed
[47:11] already and it's this body that needs a
[47:13] change and it's this mind that is the
[47:15] conduit through which it's going to be
[47:17] changed because the spirit now starts to
[47:19] work in these different things amen
[47:21] Christ swapped places with you and I
[47:23] taking our sin he nailed it to the cross
[47:25] and he gave us his righteousness and our
[47:27] soul was now free to sit next to him in
[47:29] a place amen what a glorious place we're
[47:31] sitting in tonight Church Hallelujah but
[47:33] it's a soul work our body's here and our
[47:35] soul is there in terms of its
[47:38] representation in TS in terms of its
[47:40] Perfection that Soul as I said it's in
[47:43] the sphere of Faith it's in the sphere
[47:45] of love it's in the the very presence of
[47:47] God tonight but the body is stuck here
[47:50] in time remember what the scripture says
[47:52] it says the soul that sinth it shall
[47:55] die but then it says blessed is the man
[47:58] to whom the Lord will not impute sin
[48:01] that means there's a man there's a woman
[48:02] there's a child of God that he won't
[48:05] impute sin to and it's those whose souls
[48:07] are sitting right there next to him in
[48:08] his throne amen you see we we we're in
[48:12] this battle and we're in the Battle of
[48:14] Romans 7 and Romans 8 cuz Paul's sitting
[48:17] there seeing we're in these bodies don't
[48:19] you hate these bodies church I hate
[48:21] these bodies I don't like anything about
[48:23] these bodies they get in the way and
[48:25] Paul sitting there in Romans said and
[48:27] he's saying there there's this law that
[48:30] I found that when I would do good evil
[48:33] is with me and when I want to do good I
[48:35] do that which I don't want to do and
[48:37] when I do trying to do something good
[48:38] then I end up doing something bad and he
[48:40] says who will deliver me from this body
[48:42] of death what's he saying he's saying
[48:43] this body is unredeemed this body is
[48:46] sinful but then he steps right into the
[48:48] supernatural he steps right into the
[48:50] Heavenly spheres in Romans 81 and he
[48:52] says there is therefore now no
[48:54] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[48:57] why because he's saying it's already a
[48:58] finished work my soul has been judged
[49:01] I've received my Liberty in Christ it's
[49:03] a finished work and so I don't have to
[49:05] worry about what's happening here it
[49:07] doesn't mean this body gets to do
[49:09] whatever it wants by no means we've got
[49:10] to bring it into subjection we've got to
[49:12] keep it down but the soul Works done and
[49:16] that's what the baptism of the holy
[49:17] spirit is is it's a sealing of the Soul
[49:19] first and foremost and it's bringing you
[49:21] into a recognition that your soul is
[49:23] already seated in Heavenly places in
[49:24] Christ
[49:25] Jesus and so so now what happens the
[49:27] Holy Spirit comes in and it starts to
[49:29] bring this body into subjection it
[49:30] starts to change your mind it starts to
[49:32] change the way you think the way you
[49:33] approach things and all it's doing is is
[49:36] bringing this into subjection into
[49:37] what's already there that's it that's
[49:40] what's happening I say that's it as if
[49:42] it's something simple it is simple but
[49:44] it's amazing it's supernatural where
[49:45] we're resting
[49:47] tonight he says what is this all for
[49:49] verse 7 that in the ages to come he
[49:52] might show the exceeding Riches of his
[49:55] grace in his kindness towards us through
[49:58] Christ Jesus Remember Ephesians types
[50:00] the Book of Joshua so we're already
[50:02] sitting in Heavenly places but it's a
[50:04] spiritual
[50:06] place but we're stuck here with each
[50:10] other and he's saying it's going to be
[50:12] something it's going to take the
[50:14] exceeding Riches of his grace to
[50:16] transform this to what that is and so
[50:19] now he knows he's pointing he's saying
[50:21] there's a period of time here now where
[50:23] there's going to be a working of God and
[50:24] he's going to show his exceeding riches
[50:26] in you and you and you and you and every
[50:28] single one of us to bring us to the
[50:30] place where we are Body Soul and Spirit
[50:32] up there in his presence and seated in
[50:34] Heavenly places as a complete Unity amen
[50:37] it's seven Church ages is seen in
[50:38] Revelations 2 and 3 and those ages show
[50:41] the exceeding Riches of the grace of
[50:43] Jesus Christ amen why because his Works
[50:46] has to be done in an Earthly bride to
[50:47] reflect what she is spiritually in his
[50:51] presence he says for by grace are ye
[50:53] saved through faith and that not of
[50:56] yourselves it it is the gift of God
[50:57] Church don't ever forget that this is
[50:59] never earned you cannot earn
[51:02] it and you cannot burn it you can't push
[51:05] it away you can't add to it you can't
[51:07] take from it it is what it is and it's
[51:09] by his grace it's God's work alone he
[51:11] says not of Works L any man should boast
[51:14] that doesn't mean stop
[51:15] working it just means don't rest on what
[51:18] you're working
[51:19] on amen he says for we are his
[51:22] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[51:26] good Works which God had before ordained
[51:29] that we should walk in them we come to
[51:31] this place on this Earth where God
[51:33] starts to deal with us and he opens up
[51:35] his word to us and he starts to call us
[51:37] and he starts to woo us and he convicts
[51:39] us and he makes us unhappy with our life
[51:41] and the things that used to satisfy us
[51:43] don't satisfy us anymore and what's the
[51:45] purpose is to bring us out of those
[51:47] things he's trying to draw us out of our
[51:49] sinful sinful Natural State and bring us
[51:53] into a son and daughter of God's State
[51:55] that's what he's trying to do amen and
[51:56] he's supposed to trying to get us to to
[51:58] come to a place where we can live The
[52:00] Way We Were Meant to live to be what we
[52:02] were supposed to be not only that but
[52:04] here it says we've got a job to do where
[52:07] we are his workmanship in other words we
[52:09] what we will be what we're supposed to
[52:11] be is his work but he says we've been
[52:13] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[52:16] in other words there's something that's
[52:18] supposed to be
[52:20] done each of us we are his workmanship
[52:23] we're individually created for what
[52:25] we're supposed to do on this Earth
[52:27] there are things that sister Leah can do
[52:28] that sister Blanca can't do there are
[52:31] things that Lydia can
[52:32] do that Elsa can't do there are things
[52:36] that my sons can do that I can't do
[52:37] they're individually created for a good
[52:40] work which is according to the will of
[52:42] God Amen that's what adoption is all
[52:44] about as we preached over this last year
[52:46] is bringing us to the place where he can
[52:48] put us to work he can get us to doing
[52:51] his will and doing what he wants rather
[52:54] than what I want that that's that's what
[52:57] adoption is about is you lay down what
[52:58] you want to do so you can start doing
[53:00] what he wants you to do amen and what
[53:02] God wants to do is called good works
[53:05] that's the will of God is good works and
[53:07] we've been ordained to it the world says
[53:08] they're doing good things but that is
[53:10] not good works because it's not God's
[53:12] will that's what happens when they come
[53:14] to him they said we did all these
[53:15] wonderful works and he says depart from
[53:17] me you workers of iniquity I never knew
[53:19] you because they didn't do what he said
[53:22] what did what did Samuel say to Saul he
[53:23] said obedience is better than sacrifice
[53:27] and so people are there and they're
[53:28] saying I'll do this and I'll do that you
[53:30] know what it is it's not a sacrifice
[53:32] when you make the choice of what you're
[53:33] going to sacrifice church when you come
[53:35] into Christ he has you lay down things
[53:37] that you would never lay down on your
[53:38] own there's no way you lay down family
[53:41] you lay down friendships you'll lay but
[53:43] when we want to do our good works we do
[53:45] it on our schedule with our time the way
[53:47] it works well for us and that's not it
[53:49] Jesus said except you got to what lay
[53:51] aside everything pick up your cross and
[53:53] follow me and then you're on his road
[53:55] and not your road anymore
[53:57] amen obedience is greater than sacrifice
[53:59] and God's trying to get people to him
[54:01] that instead of making a sacrifice of
[54:02] their own choosing they'll obey him by
[54:04] the leading of the spirit this is like
[54:06] brother Hank Snow said to me so long ago
[54:08] he says we're in a movie script and we
[54:11] just got to live it out and God's trying
[54:12] to get us into the movie script so we
[54:15] can do our part and when the play is
[54:16] done then we all get to go that's the
[54:19] way it finishes up amen but the part of
[54:21] this is is what is so the question is
[54:23] what is the holy spirit doing this
[54:24] what's its part what is the holy or or
[54:26] the New Birth doing this equation
[54:28] because it by Nature we're sinful we're
[54:30] Bound for Destruction and yet God has
[54:33] already placed us as joint ears with
[54:34] Christ so we have this gap between who
[54:37] we are in the flesh and who we are in
[54:39] the spirit Who We Are by our natural
[54:42] birth and then who we are in Christ and
[54:44] what has to happen is that has to be
[54:45] closed and that's the new birth it's the
[54:48] changing of you from the natural to the
[54:49] spiritual in our lives and we said last
[54:51] service our natural birth has nothing to
[54:53] do with our spiritual birth amen
[54:55] Christians are born into Christian homes
[54:57] Christians are born into rock and roll
[54:59] homes Christians are born into partying
[55:01] and drinking homes Christians are born
[55:02] into atheist homes Christians are born
[55:04] into Jane
[55:07] homes they're born into all sorts of
[55:09] homes that has nothing to do with it but
[55:11] whether you're born into a Christian
[55:12] home or whether you're born into a home
[55:14] that worships rock and roll both of you
[55:16] need the new birth equally as much as
[55:18] the other there is no difference we're
[55:20] all born in sin shaped in iniquity but
[55:22] something has to take us from what we
[55:24] started out as in time and what what
[55:26] it's trying to do is blend us back into
[55:27] eternity like brother Mark was talking
[55:29] about it's trying to bring us back into
[55:30] that condition amen and that requires us
[55:33] to let go of something so we can receive
[55:35] something you know they tell that that's
[55:37] they talk about raccoons and if you want
[55:39] to trap a raccoon you put something he
[55:41] wants inside of a log and you drive
[55:43] these spikes down in it so that his hand
[55:45] can go in it but as soon as he grabs
[55:47] something that's too big and he tries to
[55:48] pull it out and he won't let go and it
[55:50] captures him you don't have to shoot him
[55:52] you don't have to do anything you can
[55:53] literally go up and grab him by the
[55:54] Scruff of the neck cuz he won't let go
[55:55] of what he wants God's trying to say let
[55:57] go let go there's something I've got for
[55:59] you that's worth more than what you've
[56:00] been holding on to so long but remember
[56:03] we're in this Plan of Redemption and
[56:04] that means we were something and we had
[56:06] something and we're going back to that
[56:08] the Redemption is only for the children
[56:10] of God you can only redeem somebody
[56:12] that's related to you and so he's coming
[56:15] back for a group of people amen and we
[56:17] lost it by sin the blood of Jesus Christ
[56:19] paid that price and now by the grace of
[56:21] God we're coming back to what we were
[56:24] brother bam says it this way he says
[56:25] what's the Holy Spirit trying to do
[56:26] today he says to cut off all that
[56:30] unbelief he says they shall lay hands on
[56:32] the sick and they shall recover it's
[56:34] trying to bring the people back to the
[56:37] unadulterated
[56:39] word cuz for 2,000 years see what
[56:42] happened over the first 6ou or 4,000
[56:45] years or really 3,400 I guess first
[56:48] 3,400 words years of the word of God
[56:51] what did they do they they preach for
[56:53] Doctrine the teachings of men and they
[56:55] brought them to the place where where
[56:56] they thought they were righteous by
[56:57] their works and then the word and flesh
[56:59] came in Christ and they rejected him and
[57:01] then now Christ comes and he gives a a
[57:03] new gospel he gives a New Covenant of
[57:05] Grace and he sends the five-fold
[57:07] ministry he sends a prophet Paul to
[57:09] preach it and then what happens is over
[57:11] the next 2,000 years what do the men
[57:13] what do the the the religious people of
[57:15] the world do they teach for preach for
[57:18] doctrines the teachings of men and what
[57:20] did they do they made the word impure
[57:23] they didn't make the word impure but
[57:24] what they preached was an impure word it
[57:25] was incomplete word and it had all these
[57:28] things added to it and blended into it
[57:29] and so many things got out of sink and
[57:31] so what God's trying to do is bring us
[57:33] back to the unadulterated word because
[57:35] that's where our Victory is that's where
[57:36] our overcoming power is is in a pure
[57:38] word he says where God said like it was
[57:41] in Eden before theology was ated bring
[57:43] it back to the way it was in Eden when
[57:45] man walked with God and if a treat
[57:47] didn't look right he said be thou
[57:49] plucked up and head over here the wind
[57:51] was blowing he said peace be still and
[57:53] it stopped whatever he was he could
[57:56] controlled all the animals everything on
[57:58] Earth it was his he was God over Earth
[58:01] he had controlling power in him now this
[58:04] is not the time where that is to be
[58:06] displayed we'll see elements of that
[58:08] we'll see portions of that and we even
[58:09] have testimonies of people that have had
[58:11] those experiences within this very
[58:13] church but our time is coming in the
[58:15] future this is a time for character not
[58:18] for display of big Power in this world
[58:20] Amen we got a new we've got a millennium
[58:22] coming then we've got a new heavens and
[58:23] a new Earth that's where the power will
[58:25] be displayed that's where it's meant to
[58:27] when we come back at the end of the
[58:28] Gentile or the Jewish dispensation these
[58:30] different things amen but now he's
[58:32] working on us in here it's a body work
[58:35] rather than an external work he says one
[58:38] came down
[58:40] sorry everything on Earth it was his he
[58:42] was God over the Earth he had
[58:43] controlling power in him that's our Eden
[58:45] condition that's what a Son of God a
[58:47] daughter of God is supposed to look like
[58:49] he says and then one came down from
[58:50] heaven in all this pollution and proved
[58:53] that that was God's plan for he was the
[58:56] son of God remember there was a first
[58:58] Adam and then there was the second Adam
[59:01] Jesus Christ for the first 30 years of
[59:03] his life had no advantage over
[59:06] Adam born
[59:08] sinless right in fact Christ was born
[59:11] into a worse place because he was born
[59:13] into pollution Adam was born into
[59:15] Perfection and still
[59:17] fell Christ came in and what did he do
[59:19] he proved that you didn't have to
[59:22] fall he made a choice he lived
[59:26] by the word and he overcame where Adam
[59:29] didn't and now what he's doing is he's
[59:30] got an eve that's got to overcome the
[59:32] same way but he realized there's got to
[59:34] be something different this time and
[59:36] what's it going to take it's going to
[59:37] take him inside of us it takes the holy
[59:40] spirit inside of every one of us but
[59:41] Christ he says was the firstborn among
[59:43] me many Brethren so our life is not
[59:45] supposed to be different than Christ
[59:47] that's one of the great failings I think
[59:48] of denominationalism is that they make
[59:50] us less than Christ and we are only Less
[59:52] in terms of the portion that we have but
[59:54] our life is supposed to reflect reflect
[59:56] exactly what Christ did it's the second
[59:58] manifestation of him in his bride he
[1:00:00] says and what did he do he died that we
[1:00:03] might come back and be purged through
[1:00:04] the righteousness of his blood and he
[1:00:06] represents us this morning so that's
[1:00:08] what the new birth is trying to do it's
[1:00:10] trying to bring us back to that Eed in
[1:00:12] condition but that's at the end of it
[1:00:14] all spiritually we're already there but
[1:00:17] this whole body and mind has to be
[1:00:18] brought into subjection and so that's
[1:00:20] what the new birth is doing is is it's
[1:00:21] Bridging the Gap between the natural and
[1:00:24] the spiritual man and woman in Christ
[1:00:26] amen and that's what so when we come to
[1:00:28] this and we talk about spoken word and
[1:00:30] we talk about all these different things
[1:00:32] that's where the mature son and daughter
[1:00:33] of God will be and that's near the very
[1:00:36] end if not at the End Amen but until
[1:00:38] then we've got all this time where we
[1:00:40] have to develop their character and
[1:00:41] these different things but we read this
[1:00:44] scripture last service and Paul said
[1:00:46] this he says therefore If any man be in
[1:00:47] Christ he is a new creature old things
[1:00:51] are passed away behold how much becomes
[1:00:54] new in the New Birth Church
[1:00:56] all Everything Changes you cannot keep
[1:01:01] anything it remember it has to be by
[1:01:04] fire remember what John said he says I
[1:01:06] baptize you with water but the one
[1:01:07] that's coming will do it with water and
[1:01:11] fire spirit and fire it's got to burn
[1:01:13] everything there's got to be a total
[1:01:15] Destruction there's got to be a total
[1:01:17] change amen and that's a dramatic event
[1:01:20] you know brother Barry coffee shared
[1:01:21] some photos and and I've been seeing
[1:01:23] different things my sister shared some
[1:01:25] things about all the impact of hurricane
[1:01:27] Helen and they got this this river that
[1:01:29] normally crests about 1.2 feet I think
[1:01:31] or 1 and a half ft in flood season and
[1:01:33] it went over 22
[1:01:36] feet 15 times 17 times more than it
[1:01:39] normally goes and wiped out everything
[1:01:41] in his path imagine a fire that destroys
[1:01:44] everything church it's
[1:01:46] dramatic the Holy Ghost when it comes
[1:01:48] into your life the New Birth when you
[1:01:50] experience it it's dramatic the way you
[1:01:52] think the way you act the way you talk
[1:01:55] your job how you spend your money your
[1:01:57] hobbies your friends your entertainment
[1:01:59] your music your dress everything it's a
[1:02:01] completely new way of doing things even
[1:02:04] if you've been raised in
[1:02:07] church because what happens now is the
[1:02:09] reason behind
[1:02:11] it makes what you're doing pure you can
[1:02:14] do certain things by obedience but now
[1:02:16] you'll do it because there's something
[1:02:17] in you that cries out for it and that
[1:02:19] alone is a huge difference that's the
[1:02:20] difference we want to do is where we do
[1:02:22] it by a heart's cry rather than by
[1:02:24] legalism
[1:02:27] amen that word creature he says if any
[1:02:29] man be in Christ he is a new creature
[1:02:31] that word creature means divine
[1:02:34] creation but remember what he said we
[1:02:36] were earlier he said we were children of
[1:02:37] Wrath we were Bound for judgment by our
[1:02:39] sinful nature and that wasn't of God's
[1:02:41] making or choosing but now of God's
[1:02:43] choosing is that we become a divine
[1:02:45] creature a Divine Creation in Christ
[1:02:48] amen and that's the way God intended us
[1:02:50] to be and it's a soul work that then
[1:02:52] starts to work its way out through our
[1:02:53] spirit and into our body amen and so
[1:02:56] we're trying to get back to that
[1:02:57] original image that he had for us and it
[1:02:59] comes by the new birth and we go from
[1:03:01] being a creation by the will of man to a
[1:03:03] Divine creation by the will of God born
[1:03:07] of the spirit of God born by the word of
[1:03:09] God and ordained to those good works
[1:03:11] that he talked
[1:03:12] about now in John 1 it says this but as
[1:03:15] many as received him to them gave he
[1:03:17] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:03:20] them that believe on his name and I've
[1:03:21] preached on this many times and it's an
[1:03:23] often misunderstood scripture because
[1:03:25] they say if you receive Christ then
[1:03:27] he'll give you power to become a child
[1:03:29] of God and that can't be further from
[1:03:31] the truth you cannot receive Christ
[1:03:33] unless you are a child of
[1:03:35] God because there's brother V and I were
[1:03:37] talking about this it's like we've got a
[1:03:39] tuner built into US built to hear our
[1:03:41] father's voice says my sheep hear my
[1:03:44] voice and another will they will not
[1:03:45] follow there's only one voice that
[1:03:47] synchronizes with our internal mechanism
[1:03:49] here and it's the voice of the word amen
[1:03:52] that's the thing we respond to amen you
[1:03:54] can't receive Christ unless you're a
[1:03:56] child of God and that's the power to
[1:03:58] become a child of God is to receive the
[1:04:00] word and only children of God can do
[1:04:02] that when you receive the word remember
[1:04:04] what Jesus said my words are there
[1:04:06] spirit and life you receive the word and
[1:04:08] what happens is the spirit comes behind
[1:04:10] it and it quickens it because there was
[1:04:11] a word seed already there in your life
[1:04:13] that's all that's happening is that
[1:04:14] there was something inside of you and it
[1:04:17] comes to life under the preaching of the
[1:04:18] word and under the presence of the Holy
[1:04:20] Spirit and that comes to life and when
[1:04:22] something Eternal comes to life when the
[1:04:24] word comes to life it never dies
[1:04:26] once it starts there's no putting it
[1:04:28] down that's why Paul says you can't fall
[1:04:32] away you can't fall away if you fall
[1:04:35] away it's because you never had it in
[1:04:37] the first place so when people come back
[1:04:40] they need to realize they never had it
[1:04:42] in the first place and they need to go
[1:04:44] through the full works of Grace to get
[1:04:45] there something didn't anchor them but
[1:04:48] once that work is started in your soul
[1:04:50] then it's a finished work it cannot die
[1:04:52] eternal life has sprung forth out of it
[1:04:54] and it can't die amen it's a part of the
[1:04:58] word he says which were born not of
[1:05:01] blood nor of the will of the flesh nor
[1:05:03] of the will of man but of God born of
[1:05:07] what born of whose will Mom and Dad see
[1:05:10] so often we look at that we say well
[1:05:11] that was just Mom and Dad we just
[1:05:12] happened to have these parents and they
[1:05:14] came together and they happened to have
[1:05:15] a child no we were born by the will of
[1:05:17] God and our mom and our dad might have
[1:05:19] thought they had a say in it but God was
[1:05:21] using them to produce this physical body
[1:05:23] but there comes a day where God says no
[1:05:25] no you need the new birth so you can
[1:05:27] realize who's your real daddy and that's
[1:05:29] what the new birth is is it's getting
[1:05:30] you to recognize that you are a child of
[1:05:33] God you always were a child of God you
[1:05:35] always will be a child of God and you're
[1:05:37] born again and it's by the will of God
[1:05:39] and that's the birth that counts more
[1:05:40] than any other birth Amen brother Brown
[1:05:44] would say this he says and if it's the
[1:05:45] word of the Lord then it's his
[1:05:48] premeditated thoughts amen that's how we
[1:05:51] have eternal life because we were spoken
[1:05:53] into existence by God not joined into a
[1:05:56] church but born by the word the original
[1:05:59] seed that God said let there be and
[1:06:02] there was that's what why you're sitting
[1:06:05] here this evening church he said let
[1:06:07] there be and you came out and you
[1:06:11] received him you heard him you received
[1:06:12] him and here you stand
[1:06:13] tonight he says amen that's the way God
[1:06:16] births his children today in the womb of
[1:06:18] their heart with his word and his word
[1:06:20] takes root and grows how can a spirit in
[1:06:24] a human heart say it's of God
[1:06:26] and deny this word when the very God
[1:06:28] word itself is what's in the human heart
[1:06:31] amen he says if it isn't it's something
[1:06:33] else and it isn't the holy spirit in
[1:06:37] there amen if you are born to a great
[1:06:40] family today thank God if you're born to
[1:06:43] a horrible family thank God because it
[1:06:45] doesn't matter you are where you are
[1:06:46] today by a birthing of the spirit
[1:06:48] according to the word of God Amen every
[1:06:51] one of us has to be born again to be
[1:06:52] anything worth talking about it's that
[1:06:54] new birth that counts above all else
[1:06:56] brother Brown would say Christians oh
[1:06:58] you must have a personal relationship to
[1:07:00] God in order to be a Son of God you must
[1:07:03] become relation to God he must be your
[1:07:06] father in order for you to be his son
[1:07:08] and only his sons and daughters are
[1:07:10] saved not the members of a church but
[1:07:13] Sons and Daughters there's only one
[1:07:15] thing that will produce that that's the
[1:07:18] new birth he says the new birth is the
[1:07:21] only thing that will produce
[1:07:24] relationship to God
[1:07:28] if you have something else then what
[1:07:29] will it produce relationship to the
[1:07:32] pastor the ministry the church the
[1:07:35] Christian Community all those things all
[1:07:38] good things but it's not Christ amen
[1:07:42] there has to be that one-on-one
[1:07:44] connection because there's going to be a
[1:07:45] day where the pastor isn't available the
[1:07:47] church isn't available the people in the
[1:07:49] church aren't available the five full
[1:07:50] ministry is not available and you're
[1:07:51] going to have to have a connection here
[1:07:52] that holds you we don't know how far
[1:07:55] it's going to go we don't know how far
[1:07:56] it'll go before they shut things down
[1:07:59] and I might not be able to come see you
[1:08:02] and we may not be able to have regular
[1:08:03] Services the way we do or we might only
[1:08:05] be able to have a few here and there we
[1:08:07] just don't know how tight The Squeeze is
[1:08:09] going to be we don't know if it's going
[1:08:11] to be political if it's going to be
[1:08:14] spiritual we don't know that squeeze is
[1:08:15] coming because there's a desperation
[1:08:17] that's needed to get us out of here I
[1:08:19] believe that church I don't believe
[1:08:20] we're desperate enough and I'm not
[1:08:21] saying that to put us down I'm saying it
[1:08:23] takes a time of desperation to draw
[1:08:25] people closer to
[1:08:27] God Amen but it'll be a relationship
[1:08:30] with Christ that holds us every time now
[1:08:33] we read this quote at the end of the
[1:08:34] service last time and I want to just
[1:08:35] start here for the last half of the
[1:08:37] service this
[1:08:39] evening just so we can see what it looks
[1:08:42] like when you receive the holy spirit in
[1:08:43] your soul and this is what happens when
[1:08:46] you can go out of church and the Holy
[1:08:47] Spirit stays with you when you can go
[1:08:50] beyond a feeling when you can go beyond
[1:08:51] an emotion where you can go beyond a
[1:08:53] church experience and you can walk out
[1:08:55] those those doors and live every day the
[1:08:56] same as if you were in here that's what
[1:08:59] a new birth will do because you pass
[1:09:01] from Death unto life now brother BR says
[1:09:03] we all know that any kind of a birth is
[1:09:05] a mess when a baby's born if it's on the
[1:09:07] floor if it's in a Shu pile or in a pink
[1:09:10] decorated hospital room it's a mess he
[1:09:12] says but it brings life and that's what
[1:09:16] the new birth is it's a mess but it
[1:09:18] brings life it isn't a style or a put on
[1:09:21] or a declaration of Creeds it's the
[1:09:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:25] and that's the secret of the real
[1:09:28] believing Church Born
[1:09:31] Again amen he says it's a mess we read
[1:09:35] acts 238 last time and it says you had
[1:09:37] to repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:09:40] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:09:41] and then you'll receive the gift of the
[1:09:43] Holy Ghost and he says this whole thing
[1:09:44] is a mess and you cannot repent truly
[1:09:47] and not cause a mess because we've got
[1:09:50] all these attachment to this world we've
[1:09:52] got all these relationship we've got all
[1:09:54] these Hobbies we've got all these ways
[1:09:55] that we spend our money and our
[1:09:57] interests and all these different things
[1:09:58] and you can't be a partyer and a smoker
[1:10:01] and a fornicator and a rock and roll
[1:10:02] listener and all these different things
[1:10:05] and then walk away from it and not cause
[1:10:07] some consternation and some issues anden
[1:10:09] if you got friends out there and you
[1:10:10] walk away you're going to offend them
[1:10:13] they're going to say oh you're too good
[1:10:14] to hang out with us now and they'll get
[1:10:16] personally offended because you've been
[1:10:18] called away from it it causes a mess you
[1:10:21] may lose family isn't that right you may
[1:10:23] lose family you may lose friends you may
[1:10:25] cause issues with your job and these
[1:10:27] different things your dress is going to
[1:10:29] change what you listen to how you how
[1:10:31] you talk your very nature is going to
[1:10:32] change and people aren't going to
[1:10:34] understand why and it's a mess and the
[1:10:37] thing is you don't often know like
[1:10:38] Abraham what you're walking into all you
[1:10:40] know is you got to leave where you are
[1:10:42] and that in itself can cause stumbles
[1:10:44] along the way and you don't know how far
[1:10:47] to go and in our Zeal sometimes we say
[1:10:49] things we ought not
[1:10:51] to you know and we when we repent we've
[1:10:54] got to go make things right
[1:10:56] and that's not always
[1:10:58] easy it just causes so many issues but
[1:11:01] the thing is this in the end your words
[1:11:03] aren't going to do you a whole lot of
[1:11:04] good it's your life that's going to make
[1:11:06] the difference in these things amen your
[1:11:09] life will do all the Talking for you
[1:11:10] when you're born again that's the simple
[1:11:13] truth you're Divine creation by the word
[1:11:14] of God Made Alive by the spirit and your
[1:11:17] life is going to show people What's
[1:11:19] happen more than any words you could
[1:11:20] ever say cuz you'll never be able to
[1:11:22] explain it you can understand where
[1:11:25] they're at and yet you can't explain how
[1:11:26] you got out of it all you know is
[1:11:28] something's changed Bram says this he
[1:11:31] says don't try to have any sensation or
[1:11:33] anything to take the place of the Holy
[1:11:36] Spirit you know our human nature is to
[1:11:37] want to feel
[1:11:38] it isn't it it's to want to feel it say
[1:11:42] I feel
[1:11:44] different but you don't have to feel it
[1:11:46] to get the Holy Ghost but let me tell
[1:11:49] you you're going to have some feelings
[1:11:50] at some point when it comes to the New
[1:11:53] Birth cuz you're going to have joy on
[1:11:55] unspeakable and full of Glory you're
[1:11:56] going to have love you're going to have
[1:11:58] peace you're going to have rest you're
[1:11:59] going to have faith you're going to have
[1:12:01] all sorts of things you didn't have
[1:12:03] before and guess what it's going to have
[1:12:05] an effect on these emotions and on this
[1:12:07] body but that doesn't mean it starts
[1:12:09] with those things he says when the new
[1:12:12] birth is come you
[1:12:15] are
[1:12:17] changed you don't have to do anything to
[1:12:21] prove it your life proves it as you
[1:12:25] you go to
[1:12:28] church as you
[1:12:30] testify as you shout and dance and speak
[1:12:33] in
[1:12:34] tongues as you walk as you live as you
[1:12:38] go day by day he says he doesn't say you
[1:12:42] have love he says you are love peace
[1:12:46] longsuffering gentleness meekness
[1:12:49] patience that's what you are and the
[1:12:52] whole world sees the reflection of Jes
[1:12:55] Jesus Christ in you you don't have to
[1:12:57] prove anything you know I I'm sure
[1:12:59] you've all had these experiences I've
[1:13:01] had many it seems like in the past while
[1:13:03] where people go through things in life
[1:13:05] and they'll go through a difficult life
[1:13:07] experience maybe they make mistakes
[1:13:09] maybe they backslide or fall away and
[1:13:11] what do they do they come back and they
[1:13:13] talk and they talk and they talk about
[1:13:16] how they're changed and how they're
[1:13:17] different
[1:13:19] now and you know what talk is cheap talk
[1:13:23] is easy and I don't care what you say
[1:13:27] what I'm looking for is the fruits meet
[1:13:28] for repentance I'm looking for the
[1:13:31] fruits of the holy spirit in your life
[1:13:33] if you're changed your life will say it
[1:13:35] I won't have to say a word you won't
[1:13:36] have to say a word we'll all see it and
[1:13:38] we'll all wonder what happened to her
[1:13:40] what happened to him and we'll know that
[1:13:43] there's been a change in their life amen
[1:13:45] the fact of the matter is if you didn't
[1:13:47] have it before and you have it now other
[1:13:49] people are going to do the talking for
[1:13:51] you they'll say boy have you seen how
[1:13:53] different she is oh she used to have
[1:13:55] that snarky attitude and she was always
[1:13:57] ripping people down and look at her she
[1:14:00] can't get enough Fellowship anymore and
[1:14:02] she just loves everybody she won't have
[1:14:04] to talk about
[1:14:05] it
[1:14:07] amen why because it's a dramatic thing
[1:14:10] the new birth is dramatic people might
[1:14:12] not agree with how you got it but
[1:14:14] they'll know you got it amen your life
[1:14:17] will be it amen so often that's what
[1:14:19] people get hung up on church is how we
[1:14:20] get it how we believe they don't
[1:14:23] understand they can't believe what we
[1:14:24] believe but they like the result results
[1:14:26] we ought to have a testimony that the
[1:14:27] results are there you know and this is
[1:14:29] just speaking for myself it's just an
[1:14:31] observation I find that the more that
[1:14:33] people change the less they talk about
[1:14:37] themselves that's just me that's just
[1:14:39] what I've noticed the people that have
[1:14:41] most of God they don't talk about it a
[1:14:42] whole lot because there's a humility
[1:14:45] that comes with the changing power of
[1:14:46] God because you realize what you were
[1:14:48] and you realize this is his work not my
[1:14:50] work amen and it humbles us and it makes
[1:14:53] us thankful and it makes us appreciative
[1:14:55] of what he's doing inside of our
[1:14:58] Lives John would say this for whatsoever
[1:15:02] is born of God overcometh the world and
[1:15:06] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:15:08] world even our faith I love that word
[1:15:11] overcometh because it doesn't say
[1:15:13] whoever is born of God will
[1:15:16] overcome or has overcome it says
[1:15:20] overcometh that means continuously
[1:15:23] overcomes I'm over coming now I'm
[1:15:25] overcoming now I'm overcoming now I'm
[1:15:28] overcoming now and the overcoming never
[1:15:30] stops this is when you're born again the
[1:15:33] overcoming never stops it doesn't dry up
[1:15:35] it doesn't run out it doesn't hit a peak
[1:15:37] it doesn't maximize itself it just keeps
[1:15:40] going it's like the Energizer Bunning
[1:15:42] there is no end to the overcoming for
[1:15:44] the child of God that's born again amen
[1:15:46] listen I may not have overcome
[1:15:48] completely today but I overcome more
[1:15:50] today than I did yesterday and tomorrow
[1:15:52] I'm going a little higher up and
[1:15:53] tomorrow I'm going up a little higher
[1:15:55] the day after that and the day after
[1:15:56] that and it's just one step a little
[1:15:57] higher day by day and what is it it's
[1:15:59] overcoming it's footsteps is possession
[1:16:01] there's one more devil under my feet
[1:16:03] there's one more habit that I've kicked
[1:16:04] there's one more uh way that I've
[1:16:06] controlled my
[1:16:07] tongue there's one more person that was
[1:16:10] unlovable that I finally got around to
[1:16:11] loving it's just a bit day by day it's
[1:16:14] not all big victories but it's
[1:16:16] continuous day by day we're overcoming
[1:16:19] amen how he says by Faith by believing
[1:16:21] the word of God that's our overcoming we
[1:16:23] take God at his word he says who is he
[1:16:26] that overcometh the world but he that
[1:16:28] believeth that Jesus is the son of God
[1:16:30] now be careful here because people will
[1:16:32] say that they'll say salvation is where
[1:16:33] you believe on Jesus but watch what John
[1:16:35] says here because you have to keep
[1:16:37] reading he says this is
[1:16:41] he so this is the one that believes that
[1:16:44] Jesus is the son of God this is he that
[1:16:46] came by water and blood even Jesus
[1:16:48] Christ so that's the first one he says
[1:16:50] not by water only but by water and blood
[1:16:53] and it's the spirit that beareth witness
[1:16:55] because the spirit of Truth he's all
[1:16:57] speaking of Christ here he says for
[1:16:59] there are three that bear record in
[1:17:01] heaven the Father the word and the Holy
[1:17:04] Ghost and these three are one the
[1:17:07] godhead is three offices it's all one
[1:17:09] and the same God you can't have one
[1:17:11] without the other amen they are the same
[1:17:13] being it's one God not three Gods under
[1:17:16] one framework or agreement that's what
[1:17:18] the Trinity doctr preaches is that you
[1:17:19] have three gods in agreement but we'll
[1:17:21] see here that the agreement is in verse
[1:17:23] eight on in the Earth the agreement's
[1:17:25] not in heaven they are one down here is
[1:17:28] where the agreement is but up there they
[1:17:29] are one it's amazing to me how they can
[1:17:32] take that and turn it into three persons
[1:17:35] and then somehow make them one again you
[1:17:36] can't make three one that
[1:17:38] wayen the scripture says they are one
[1:17:41] the agreement is down in our part he
[1:17:43] says and there are three that bear
[1:17:45] witness in earth the earth the spirit
[1:17:48] the water and the blood it says and
[1:17:50] these three agree in one so he that
[1:17:52] overcometh the world and believes in
[1:17:54] Jesus Christ has this verse eight it
[1:17:57] says there's an agreement there's a
[1:17:59] witness in the earth and it's the spirit
[1:18:00] it's the water and the blood it says
[1:18:02] they agree in one in other words they
[1:18:03] are not one and the same thing but they
[1:18:06] are complimentary they Point towards the
[1:18:08] same thing they're part of the same
[1:18:10] Works they're in agreement they're
[1:18:11] consistent they're in unity but they're
[1:18:14] not the same thing now brother BR would
[1:18:16] come and he would explain to us what
[1:18:18] this means he says in 1 John 5:7 he
[1:18:20] reads the scripture he says they're not
[1:18:23] one but they agree as one now you can't
[1:18:25] have the father without without having
[1:18:27] the son you can't have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:29] without having Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:18:31] they are one they're
[1:18:32] Inseparable he says but you can be
[1:18:35] justified without being Sanctified and
[1:18:38] you can be Sanctified without having the
[1:18:40] Holy Ghost you can be clean live a Pure
[1:18:42] Life have a form of godliness and deny
[1:18:45] the power thereof the scripture says he
[1:18:47] says it's the power of healing speaking
[1:18:49] in tongues and the great gifts of God
[1:18:52] and every one of them in there
[1:18:55] so you can have a Justified experience
[1:18:58] and not be born again you can have a
[1:18:59] Sanctified experience not be born again
[1:19:02] but when the spirit comes that's when
[1:19:03] the full New Birth is completely
[1:19:05] finished now we're talking about the new
[1:19:08] birth and we read that quote where
[1:19:10] brother Braham says it's a mess just
[1:19:12] like a natural birth and for those that
[1:19:13] have been there for a natural birth you
[1:19:15] notice that a new birth is not
[1:19:16] traditionally everything in one moment
[1:19:19] there are elements of that that is
[1:19:21] possible it's physically possible that
[1:19:23] you could have water blood and spirit it
[1:19:26] not instantaneously but very close but
[1:19:28] the water doesn't tend to break and then
[1:19:30] the blood come right behind
[1:19:32] it the water can break and it could be
[1:19:34] 12 hours before you really start to get
[1:19:36] into
[1:19:37] labor sometimes they have to induce it
[1:19:39] because the baby is in some distress so
[1:19:42] the water can break and then after a
[1:19:43] while you might have that blood come and
[1:19:45] then after that comes the baby and you
[1:19:47] may have 12 13 you may have 24 hours
[1:19:50] between the water breaking and that baby
[1:19:52] coming out the water breaking is a part
[1:19:55] of birth but it's not the birth the
[1:19:57] blood coming is the B part of the birth
[1:19:59] but it's not the birth but when that
[1:20:00] baby finally arrives that's when you
[1:20:01] have a birth but all of those elements
[1:20:04] agree that a birth is happening but the
[1:20:06] birth hasn't happened yet until the
[1:20:08] baby's out and a spirit enters into it
[1:20:10] amen so you can be birthing without a
[1:20:13] baby being born but when the baby's born
[1:20:16] that's when you finally have a new birth
[1:20:18] amen and I'm not going to go into all
[1:20:20] the Gory details but there's a reason
[1:20:22] why they have a janitor close by and a
[1:20:24] bucket and a mop and all these things
[1:20:25] readily available because it's hot it's
[1:20:28] sweaty it's loud it's stinky and it's
[1:20:30] really messy a new birth is a mess
[1:20:33] there's a lot of
[1:20:36] emotion a lot of emotion I'm glad sister
[1:20:39] Melody is not here tonight there's a lot
[1:20:41] of
[1:20:43] pain amen there's a lot of New
[1:20:46] Sensations but not a one of those is the
[1:20:49] birth it's just a part of the birth
[1:20:52] y'all remember this kind of a funny
[1:20:54] story when Samuel was about to be born
[1:20:56] and we went to the hospital and of
[1:20:57] course we're pros at this now you know
[1:20:59] our fourth child Blanca knows exactly
[1:21:01] how our body's going she knows when to
[1:21:02] go in you know that we don't spend more
[1:21:04] time than we have to in the hospital and
[1:21:05] all these different things and we go in
[1:21:08] and they we can't get the good room
[1:21:10] because there's a new mom in there and
[1:21:12] so we're in the smaller room with a
[1:21:13] smaller tub and these things and it was
[1:21:15] kind of a bit of a downer for us but
[1:21:16] we're in there and Blanca's just kind of
[1:21:18] doing her thing and no big deal you know
[1:21:20] and there are screams and yells going on
[1:21:24] and on from in this room and you can
[1:21:25] hear them all throughout the word I mean
[1:21:26] this and what it is it was a it was a
[1:21:28] firsttime young mother in there and she
[1:21:30] was letting us know this was not fun and
[1:21:33] then the nurse came in with kind of a
[1:21:35] smirk on her face and said she's at 2 cm
[1:21:38] dilated you know as most of you mothers
[1:21:40] would say it's like like it ain't even
[1:21:43] started honey like you're not even close
[1:21:45] to having a kid yet and you're screaming
[1:21:46] like that it's going to get a whole lot
[1:21:48] worse but she was convinced it's coming
[1:21:50] it's coming I'm going to have this baby
[1:21:52] soon we got to get it no she had had all
[1:21:54] the sensation she thought of birth but
[1:21:56] there was so much more coming and let me
[1:21:58] tell you I guarantee you she yelled a
[1:21:59] lot harder than she did when we were
[1:22:01] there what she thought the baby's
[1:22:04] coming cuz she had all the
[1:22:07] sensations but the baby wasn't being
[1:22:09] born yet I think in the end they sent
[1:22:11] her home that's how far away she was
[1:22:13] from having a baby they sent her home
[1:22:15] she wasn't
[1:22:17] ready we can be the same way with the
[1:22:19] new birth we can have all the emotions
[1:22:22] we can have all the sensations we can
[1:22:24] have all the jumping up down we can have
[1:22:26] pain we can have Elation we can have
[1:22:29] expectation we can have all these things
[1:22:30] but that is not necessarily the new
[1:22:33] birth it's just a part of it amen it
[1:22:35] makes us think it and the thing is we
[1:22:37] may be in a process of a new birth but
[1:22:41] that doesn't mean we're born
[1:22:43] again the scripture says the New Birth
[1:22:45] by water blood and spirit and they agree
[1:22:47] in one you don't have them all at the
[1:22:48] same time necessarily they don't come at
[1:22:50] the same time you can be justified you
[1:22:52] can be living above your conscience you
[1:22:54] can have your conscience that's been
[1:22:55] purified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:57] you can have a Sanctified life where
[1:22:58] you're staying away from the world and
[1:23:00] the things of the world and never have
[1:23:02] the Holy
[1:23:03] Spirit absolutely true absolutely true
[1:23:06] amen but when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:23:09] that's when life comes and that's what's
[1:23:11] going to make the difference amen it
[1:23:12] takes the spirit to bring life
[1:23:14] justification is just the F work first
[1:23:16] work of Grace of the Holy Spirit but
[1:23:18] it's not the receiving of the holy
[1:23:19] spirit it's a work of it but it's not it
[1:23:22] sanctification is a second work of Grace
[1:23:24] by the holy spirit it's the working of
[1:23:26] the holy spirit it's God working with
[1:23:28] you it's the god working with your
[1:23:30] conscience it's God bringing you under
[1:23:31] conviction it's God cleaning out your
[1:23:33] life it's a working of the spirit but
[1:23:34] it's not the spirit in you yet it's
[1:23:36] preparation for the entrance it's
[1:23:39] preparation for him to fill you you can
[1:23:40] have gifts and not have the Holy Spirit
[1:23:43] you can have gifts and not be justified
[1:23:45] or Sanctified because they're without
[1:23:46] repentance they're there whether you are
[1:23:48] in a right condition or not potentially
[1:23:51] now usually you don't realize what's
[1:23:52] really there until you come into a
[1:23:53] church situation
[1:23:55] you start to realize oh this is what's
[1:23:56] been going on my life and you start to
[1:23:58] sharpen and focus on these things amen
[1:24:00] all of these things agree that there's a
[1:24:03] birth coming but they're not the birth
[1:24:05] themselves they're part of the new birth
[1:24:08] but the birth part is the messy part the
[1:24:11] actual birth is the messy part and what
[1:24:13] is the messy part brother B says this he
[1:24:15] says the new birth brings a mess but it
[1:24:18] brings new life with
[1:24:20] it he says and that's right a plant
[1:24:23] anything a seed has to rot to bring out
[1:24:25] the new life of it a sinner has to die
[1:24:28] and rot to his own ideas this is the
[1:24:32] messy part his own life has to rot that
[1:24:35] the new life can grow out of it he says
[1:24:38] it's a mess but it's a glorious mess see
[1:24:41] here's the thing we are sitting there
[1:24:43] and we're holding so tightly to what we
[1:24:46] have and God's trying we're thinking
[1:24:48] I've got to let go and we think we're
[1:24:51] letting go we're not letting go what
[1:24:53] happens is going God is loosing us these
[1:24:56] are binding us we think we're holding it
[1:24:58] but in reality it's like this thing was
[1:25:00] wrapped all around me and it's binding
[1:25:02] me my thoughts my ideas my way of
[1:25:04] looking at things my personality
[1:25:06] whatever it is we think I've got to lay
[1:25:07] it down no what God's really doing by
[1:25:09] the spirit is he's loosing you from
[1:25:11] those things he's cutting them away
[1:25:13] we're thinking this is something good I
[1:25:15] need to hold on to it he's saying no no
[1:25:17] no once you let go of it you'll realize
[1:25:18] there's so much more than you ever had
[1:25:21] the new birth is loosing you and you
[1:25:24] think you're giving up something I think
[1:25:25] I'm giving up something I'm not giving
[1:25:26] up anything I'm being free from the
[1:25:29] thing that's held me back all this time
[1:25:31] that's what the new birth is that's why
[1:25:33] it's a glorious mess can you imagine if
[1:25:36] you were bound up in Chains and they
[1:25:37] were all R Rusty and you were holding on
[1:25:39] to those
[1:25:41] chains and you had to walk through life
[1:25:43] with these chains you you you've seen
[1:25:45] Jacob Marley you know in A Christmas
[1:25:47] Carol and he's walking he's walking and
[1:25:49] those chains are clanking and it slows
[1:25:51] him down and he can't move that's what
[1:25:53] we're like before the New Birth but we
[1:25:55] are somehow our mind has been warped by
[1:25:57] sin to think that those chains are
[1:25:58] helping us rather than hindering us and
[1:26:01] so when the spirit of Christ comes in
[1:26:02] our life and the word starts to work we
[1:26:04] start to realize that these are not
[1:26:05] things to hold on to they are things to
[1:26:07] get rid of because they're holding me
[1:26:09] back he says it brings new life that's
[1:26:12] what the church needs today but they're
[1:26:14] bypassing it with dogmas and so forth to
[1:26:16] try to escape the thoughts of dying to
[1:26:20] themselves they want to live to
[1:26:23] themselves he that lives to himself
[1:26:25] lives for himself and the devil that's
[1:26:30] it there's only two sides it's not
[1:26:33] Christ the devil and you you're either
[1:26:36] with Christ or you're against him and he
[1:26:39] says if you're living for yourself then
[1:26:40] you're living for the devil he says he
[1:26:42] that denies himself shall find his life
[1:26:44] in Christ and he'll be a new creature
[1:26:46] he'll be a new Divine creation he says
[1:26:49] that's the way you're a
[1:26:50] Christian that's how you become a
[1:26:52] Christian he says you are born a CHR
[1:26:54] Christian you're not joined into it
[1:26:55] you're born into it he says everybody is
[1:26:58] afraid of the
[1:27:01] birth again I'm glad sister Melody's not
[1:27:03] here because coming up to that I
[1:27:06] remember the first time and everyone's
[1:27:07] wondering is it going to hurt how bad is
[1:27:09] it going to hurt am I going to be able
[1:27:11] to take it how long is it going to be
[1:27:13] I've heard so many horror stories go
[1:27:15] talk to somebody that's had a new birth
[1:27:17] and they'll tell you it's a glorious
[1:27:19] thing but it ain't
[1:27:22] easy but after the pain over that's what
[1:27:25] the scripture says remember there's all
[1:27:26] this pain building up to the birth but
[1:27:28] once that child is born the mother
[1:27:29] forgets the pain cuz she's got life
[1:27:32] that's the way it is for us is we have
[1:27:34] something that's so much greater than
[1:27:35] everything we were so worried of Letting
[1:27:37] Go and we're happy even when it's hard
[1:27:41] we're happy because there's a
[1:27:43] satisfaction in our soul now he says
[1:27:45] they have some nice clean way of taking
[1:27:47] a little hand or signing a little card
[1:27:50] or a salt shake with some water in it
[1:27:52] that's not the birth a birth is a horrid
[1:27:54] thing a birth is an awful thing I don't
[1:27:56] care if it's in a pig pen a barn stall
[1:27:58] or in a pink decorated hospital room a
[1:28:00] birth is a mess and it makes a mess out
[1:28:03] of you have you been made a mess yet
[1:28:05] young
[1:28:07] people you ought to have been made a
[1:28:09] mess if you've received the Holy
[1:28:11] Spirit he says you don't want to give up
[1:28:13] you don't want this that or the other he
[1:28:15] says but the tears will wash the paint
[1:28:18] off your face and make you a different
[1:28:20] person if you're born again it'll make a
[1:28:23] mess out of you but you'll come forth a
[1:28:25] new creature see they don't want that
[1:28:27] they want some easy way you know and
[1:28:29] there are no easy ways as a song he said
[1:28:34] I'll take the way with the Lord's
[1:28:36] despised few he doesn't want to be a
[1:28:38] hothead plant you know we had a
[1:28:40] caterpillar that kind of uh nestled up
[1:28:43] in our front
[1:28:44] door and and he went in there as a
[1:28:49] caterpillar and it kind of you know he
[1:28:51] wraps himself in there and then there's
[1:28:52] some things happen in there and and then
[1:28:54] eventually we came and it was all gone
[1:28:55] but there was this pink goo there it was
[1:28:58] a mess but all that was left was the
[1:29:01] mess the mess is what you get to leave
[1:29:03] behind you come forth as a new creation
[1:29:06] you don't have to carry the mess with
[1:29:08] you you might have memory of it and
[1:29:10] Satan might try and put it on you but
[1:29:12] you get to say that mess is in the past
[1:29:15] it's a messy process but when you come
[1:29:16] out you're an entirely New Creation amen
[1:29:19] you know my wife and I were talking
[1:29:21] about a situation recently where where
[1:29:23] there were there there's a we we had
[1:29:25] there was a situation that needed help
[1:29:27] and support a and just some different
[1:29:30] things and in our heart we wanted to
[1:29:33] help but the thing is sometimes we've
[1:29:36] got to let people go through the hard
[1:29:39] work because otherwise we end up with
[1:29:41] what he calls here a hot bed plant if
[1:29:43] you make it easy it'll go easy as an
[1:29:47] easy come easy go that's what I mean
[1:29:49] there you make it easy for somebody then
[1:29:52] guess what they'll rely on you the next
[1:29:53] time and they'll rely on you the next
[1:29:55] time and they'll rely on you the next
[1:29:56] time but there comes a point where
[1:29:58] you've got to let somebody do the hard
[1:29:59] work so that they realize this is what
[1:30:01] it
[1:30:02] cost to get what we have here amen
[1:30:05] there's got to be an element of personal
[1:30:07] sacrifice at some point otherwise we
[1:30:08] don't grow in our character and we
[1:30:10] aren't strengthened and we aren't mature
[1:30:12] and we can't handle things and people
[1:30:14] get used to being given everything and
[1:30:15] they don't realize the effort that goes
[1:30:17] behind that gift every single time amen
[1:30:19] there's no free lunch and no matter what
[1:30:20] somebody gets somebody else has to pay
[1:30:22] for it I can't give you money that I
[1:30:24] don't work for I had to work for it if
[1:30:26] you want my money and I give it to you I
[1:30:28] have to work for it somebody has to work
[1:30:30] for it I don't just get to walk through
[1:30:32] the streets and gather money that's not
[1:30:33] the way it works I have to work for it
[1:30:35] everyone does I can't give you my
[1:30:36] vehicle to borrow without me paying for
[1:30:38] a
[1:30:39] vehicle amen I can't give you anything
[1:30:41] without paying a price of some sort and
[1:30:44] it's no different when we look at the
[1:30:45] new birth Christ paid the big price he
[1:30:48] paid the sin debt off he took care of
[1:30:50] that but there's a price to be paid amen
[1:30:53] and it shows that we value what he did
[1:30:56] and that's when we lay down our
[1:30:58] self-will that's the big price we're
[1:31:00] really talking about here amen it's our
[1:31:02] own thinking it's our thoughts we give
[1:31:04] up our fleshly desires all of those
[1:31:06] things but God doesn't just come and say
[1:31:08] make this heavy decision no that's why
[1:31:10] we need Ezekiel 37 he gives us a new
[1:31:12] heart and a new spirit that's what makes
[1:31:14] the transition from natural man and
[1:31:16] woman to spiritual man and woman easier
[1:31:19] is because he changes our desires he
[1:31:20] changes our mind he changes our way of
[1:31:22] thinking and that eases that transition
[1:31:24] from death into life and so we're
[1:31:26] willing to give it up because there's
[1:31:27] something inside of us that's calling
[1:31:29] for it in the first place you think a
[1:31:32] caterpillar wants to become a
[1:31:34] butterfly no but there's something built
[1:31:36] into it to go in and make itself
[1:31:39] uncomfortable and wrap itself up tight
[1:31:42] and sit still for a while and when it
[1:31:44] does that then there's a process that
[1:31:46] happens it has to pay a price
[1:31:49] though it has to pay a
[1:31:51] price and that's what we have to do we
[1:31:54] have to pay a price and it's laying down
[1:31:56] and dying completely and that means our
[1:31:58] self-will is the thing that we have to
[1:32:00] let go amen I'll tell you church when we
[1:32:02] put that down what are we doing we're
[1:32:04] putting our life in God's hands then you
[1:32:07] lay self-will down now somebody else has
[1:32:09] to lead now somebody else has to guide
[1:32:11] now somebody else has to provide and
[1:32:13] that's where Faith starts to rise up is
[1:32:15] because that's all we have left is when
[1:32:16] our self-will is gone we've just got
[1:32:17] faith in God's word and that's where
[1:32:19] we're proven and that's where we see our
[1:32:21] patience and we're trusting God to back
[1:32:23] up his word in our lives and fulfill it
[1:32:25] in our lives
[1:32:26] amen 1 John 5 says and this is the
[1:32:29] record that God ha given to us eternal
[1:32:31] life and this life is in his son he that
[1:32:35] had the son had life and he that had not
[1:32:38] the Son of God had not
[1:32:40] life has him not just accepts the worth
[1:32:44] of
[1:32:45] Calvary has him this is a personal
[1:32:48] possession this is a personal indwelling
[1:32:51] this is a total change of headship and
[1:32:53] life is when we change our headship from
[1:32:55] me to him amen it's Christ coming into
[1:32:59] the believer personally it's not the
[1:33:00] third person of the Trinity it's Christ
[1:33:03] himself coming in amen and we'll see
[1:33:06] we're going to talk about this more in a
[1:33:08] future service that when Jesus goes away
[1:33:10] then what does he say he says I'm going
[1:33:12] to send you a comforter I'm going to
[1:33:13] send you the Holy Spirit and then he
[1:33:15] says
[1:33:17] I he doesn't say he he says he but then
[1:33:20] he says I he and I are the same thing
[1:33:23] it's not a third person of the Trinity
[1:33:25] it's Christ coming back into the
[1:33:26] believer it's a personal one because
[1:33:28] we've got to have the son that's where
[1:33:30] life is from amen he says I'll be with
[1:33:32] you I'll be in you it's a personal thing
[1:33:34] not a third person of the Trinity thing
[1:33:37] but the the Christian world has come up
[1:33:38] with this idea that we can believe Jesus
[1:33:41] we can accept Jesus and yet we can
[1:33:43] reject his
[1:33:44] word that that that's the nominal idea
[1:33:47] of Christianity Today is that you come
[1:33:49] and you accept the finished work of
[1:33:50] Calvary he forgives you for your sins
[1:33:53] and yet you don't have to actually obey
[1:33:54] the whole word of God they'll let you
[1:33:57] get away with anything they have pastors
[1:34:00] that are divorced and remarried they've
[1:34:01] got people that are living common law
[1:34:03] going to church serving in the
[1:34:05] church you can live any way you want and
[1:34:07] go to a Christian church today you can
[1:34:09] live an alternate lifestyle you can cuss
[1:34:11] you can listen to rock and roll you can
[1:34:13] go out to you if you've got a good
[1:34:15] enough reason you can go into a Catholic
[1:34:17] Church wearing your bathing
[1:34:20] suit that's where Christianity has come
[1:34:23] because what they're saying is take
[1:34:24] Christ and they've separated Christ from
[1:34:26] the
[1:34:26] word amen but you can't get the full
[1:34:30] impact if you don't accept the full
[1:34:32] package you can't you can't get into
[1:34:34] heaven as a Halfway Christian you've got
[1:34:37] to be an all the way Christian and
[1:34:38] that's what the Holy Ghost is here to do
[1:34:40] and I've been been reading in the church
[1:34:41] age book where where where brother
[1:34:43] bram's talking about he says and he's
[1:34:44] here to take you from partial
[1:34:47] realization into full realization and
[1:34:49] that's what the new birth is doing is
[1:34:51] it's taking you from a place where you
[1:34:53] didn't have have what you needed to
[1:34:54] bringing you to a place where you've got
[1:34:56] what you need now amen it's giving you
[1:34:58] Victory where you never had enough
[1:34:59] Victory it's giving you love where you
[1:35:01] never had enough love it's giving you
[1:35:02] Faith where you just never had enough
[1:35:04] Faith to get the job done and what's it
[1:35:06] doing it's taking you from a partial
[1:35:07] reality into the full reality of the
[1:35:10] power of God in your life by the word
[1:35:12] that's what the new birth is supposed to
[1:35:13] do it's taking us from that that that
[1:35:15] miserable condition of being a halfway
[1:35:18] believer of having a church experience
[1:35:21] into a god experience into a sudden
[1:35:23] daughter of God experience
[1:35:26] amen remember what we they it says about
[1:35:30] the the people on the on the day of
[1:35:32] Pentecost there it says then they that
[1:35:33] gladly received what his word were
[1:35:37] baptized and the same day they were
[1:35:38] added unto them about 3,000 Souls it
[1:35:41] wasn't Peter's words they were receiving
[1:35:42] it was Christ the word see that's what
[1:35:45] we have to remember here is that we're
[1:35:47] not just reading a book we're receiving
[1:35:50] Christ the word there is no separation
[1:35:53] and they were receiving the word of God
[1:35:55] by anointed preaching and it brought
[1:35:57] them to the word of God indwelling them
[1:35:59] by the Holy Spirit they received the
[1:36:01] word and they became the word that's how
[1:36:03] it works people want to separate Jesus
[1:36:05] Christ in the work of Calvary from the
[1:36:07] word of God but Jesus said I am the word
[1:36:09] I'm the word made flesh so you can't
[1:36:12] separate those two things John 1 tells
[1:36:14] us that that he was and is the word of
[1:36:16] God from the beginning and we see at the
[1:36:18] very end here as it as time starts to
[1:36:20] wind down in Revelation it says and I
[1:36:22] saw heaven open
[1:36:24] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[1:36:27] upon him was called faithful and true
[1:36:29] and in righteousness he do judge and
[1:36:31] make war his eyes are as a flame of fire
[1:36:34] and on his head were many crowns and he
[1:36:37] had a name written that no man knew but
[1:36:39] he himself and he was clothed with a
[1:36:41] vesture dipped in Blood and his name is
[1:36:44] called the word of God people say Christ
[1:36:49] is not he's not a judge he's not hard
[1:36:52] he's loving he's kind Church what's he
[1:36:54] coming with he's coming to make war he's
[1:36:57] coming in judgment and what is he coming
[1:36:59] as he's coming as the word of God his
[1:37:02] name his identity is with the word time
[1:37:05] and time again it's Christ the word he's
[1:37:08] coming back as the word and people are
[1:37:09] saying I'm relying on the sacrifice of
[1:37:11] Calvary the sacrifice of Calvary was
[1:37:13] meant to take you into the word not to
[1:37:16] just wash you over and then walk away
[1:37:18] from you it was to make you come into
[1:37:20] the Plan of Redemption so that he could
[1:37:22] finish a work that he started
[1:37:25] amen you can't accept Christ and deny
[1:37:27] the word they're Inseparable Inseparable
[1:37:29] they're one and the same so when you
[1:37:31] receive the word of God well and truly
[1:37:33] that is the start of the new birth
[1:37:36] that's when life starts to come in and
[1:37:37] it turns your world upside down Church
[1:37:41] why because leadership has changed now
[1:37:43] it's not me it's Christ Living in me now
[1:37:45] it's not what I think it's what the word
[1:37:47] says and it completely changes the
[1:37:50] Dynamics because now there's a new
[1:37:52] person in the control tower and it's not
[1:37:53] Jonathan klette it's not the DNA of
[1:37:55] Lanny and Sandy klet now it's Christ the
[1:37:58] word in there and that's what's
[1:37:59] controlling me and it turns my entire
[1:38:01] world upside down it has to because It
[1:38:04] hasn't been working under my leadership
[1:38:05] that's for sure brother B talks about
[1:38:08] Paul Paul is the epitome of the
[1:38:10] religious
[1:38:11] person and he says Paul was down here in
[1:38:14] the natural realm with his PhD see he
[1:38:17] didn't know he had an intellectual Faith
[1:38:19] but he didn't have a Divine Faith
[1:38:21] there's quite a difference in me having
[1:38:23] intellectual faith and a Divine Faith he
[1:38:25] says that's where you my Baptist friends
[1:38:27] failed to go on you get the intellectual
[1:38:30] Faith by that but it must be a divine
[1:38:32] revelation of Jesus Christ to you that
[1:38:34] takes sin out of the heart intellectual
[1:38:37] Faith's not enough that's all right but
[1:38:39] it only brings you to the Holy Spirit he
[1:38:42] says the holy spirit is a personal
[1:38:48] experience not a church experience not a
[1:38:51] mommy and daddy experience it's a the
[1:38:53] personal experience of the new birth
[1:38:57] regeneration making a new creature in
[1:39:01] Christ the new birth is turning us into
[1:39:04] what we were before time began amen it's
[1:39:07] bringing us into the subjection of the
[1:39:08] word it's producing the word in our
[1:39:11] lives he said the working of the Holy
[1:39:14] Spirit the kingdom of God in you God
[1:39:16] sets on the throne of your heart in his
[1:39:19] control room controlling your emotions
[1:39:22] controlling in your powers controlling
[1:39:25] your conceptions and making you one with
[1:39:28] him in fellowship and in love he says
[1:39:32] and God fills you with love he fills you
[1:39:34] with power he fills you with the spirit
[1:39:36] he fills you with his own divine nature
[1:39:39] and he changes your carnal nature into
[1:39:42] his nature he says then in this you
[1:39:45] become a new creation in Christ
[1:39:50] hallelujah what a work he's done Church
[1:39:52] you say brother John I haven't
[1:39:54] recognized that yet in my life I'm
[1:39:55] saying it's available you may have it
[1:39:58] and not realize it you may have quenched
[1:40:00] it you may not listen there are
[1:40:02] sometimes things that we don't have
[1:40:04] because nobody's come and unlock them
[1:40:05] yet the word may not have unlocked it to
[1:40:08] you yet you may not have a revelation of
[1:40:09] it yet but as the Revelation comes as
[1:40:11] the word comes that's the day that's the
[1:40:13] day you get to say it's mine if you
[1:40:15] never knew it before but you know it now
[1:40:17] say today Lord I'm claiming it I've got
[1:40:19] the Holy Ghost I've received the new
[1:40:21] birth I'm claiming it for myself tonight
[1:40:26] as we start to
[1:40:27] close Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall
[1:40:29] pass away but my words shall not pass
[1:40:34] away when you become a part of the word
[1:40:37] you realize I can't
[1:40:40] fail when you realize you always were a
[1:40:42] part of the word you realize you never
[1:40:45] could fail in the first
[1:40:46] place Jesus said everything's going to
[1:40:49] pass away everything you see here is
[1:40:51] going to pass away except my words
[1:40:55] there's only one thing the word of God
[1:40:56] can do and that's be fulfilled that is
[1:40:59] the only Power it has is fulfillment it
[1:41:01] cannot fail it cannot fall away it
[1:41:02] cannot die out it can't time out it can
[1:41:05] only produce what it is amen that's
[1:41:10] what's holding me today church he says
[1:41:12] my words will never pass away I'm a part
[1:41:14] of it you're a part of it that's the
[1:41:16] security I have tonight is that when I
[1:41:18] beca when I was a part of his word that
[1:41:20] ensured nothing could happen to me
[1:41:22] except he allowed it
[1:41:24] and I've got a sure and faithful end
[1:41:25] that's
[1:41:26] coming he says now what is the word of
[1:41:29] God the word of God is God
[1:41:33] himself he says so God gave the believer
[1:41:36] himself it's God himself he gave the
[1:41:38] believer himself to attack the Enemy by
[1:41:41] in other words he's the father and the
[1:41:43] word is God then the word is our father
[1:41:45] we're born by the word and he's standing
[1:41:48] in the Forefront for his children amen
[1:41:50] he says there you are he's standing out
[1:41:52] there for his children
[1:41:53] what are we scared
[1:41:55] about if his words can't fail what are
[1:41:58] we scared
[1:42:00] about scripture says he's not given us a
[1:42:02] spirit to
[1:42:05] fear he says what are we scared about
[1:42:08] the Rapture is sure the coming is sure
[1:42:12] every blessing that's been promised is
[1:42:15] ours all belongs to us hallelujah what
[1:42:20] are we scared about church
[1:42:23] when doubt comes in that's when we get
[1:42:25] scared when we listen too long to the
[1:42:28] wrong thoughts when we feed too long on
[1:42:30] the wrong things what happens is fear
[1:42:33] starts to creep in and how do you push
[1:42:35] it back the word of God the word of God
[1:42:38] the word of God because he dwells in his
[1:42:40] word amen that's where your power lies
[1:42:42] is in the word quickened by the
[1:42:44] spirit last quote as we
[1:42:47] close he says the Holy Ghost is the
[1:42:50] action in you it's a life
[1:42:53] not an emotion not some sort of a
[1:42:56] fleshly evidence he says but it is a
[1:42:58] person Jesus Christ the word of God
[1:43:02] established in your heart to Quicken
[1:43:04] every word of this age he says watch the
[1:43:07] Holy Ghost In Action not so much in
[1:43:11] demonstrations he says but in action
[1:43:14] what it does according to the word amen
[1:43:19] God bless you let's stand together I
[1:43:22] love how he puts it there there because
[1:43:24] so often what we're crying out for is
[1:43:26] the demonstrations isn't it wouldn't we
[1:43:28] love it I think as a minister speaking
[1:43:30] for myself I would love it if great
[1:43:32] signs and wonders followed every single
[1:43:34] service we had here if it was just one
[1:43:37] sign and wonder after another if there
[1:43:39] was tongues if there was interpretation
[1:43:40] if there was healings if there was
[1:43:42] visions and all of these things wouldn't
[1:43:43] that be an amazing
[1:43:45] thing I'd love it and it is available to
[1:43:48] us it's been put into the church but
[1:43:50] brother Bram says it's not in demonst
[1:43:53] ations that's not what we're anchored in
[1:43:55] he says but what it does according to
[1:43:59] the word that's what we're looking for
[1:44:01] is for the word to be fulfilled see the
[1:44:04] flesh loves the demonstrations it loves
[1:44:06] the signs and the Wonders what the flesh
[1:44:08] doesn't like is living by the word it
[1:44:12] loves for all the action to be out there
[1:44:15] and making life easier and taking
[1:44:17] burdens away and all these things but he
[1:44:19] says it's the the Holy Ghost what it
[1:44:21] does according to the word quickening
[1:44:23] the word in your life that's what it's
[1:44:25] supposed to do what's the New Birth
[1:44:27] Church it's Christ the word quickening
[1:44:31] the word for your day in your life it's
[1:44:34] the person of Jesus Christ inside you by
[1:44:37] the Holy Spirit making you live the word
[1:44:40] that's it you say brother John how do I
[1:44:41] know I've got the Holy Ghost you're
[1:44:43] living by the word that simple it is
[1:44:46] that simple and when you are living by
[1:44:48] the word then you will produce the fruit
[1:44:49] of the spirit you will live a life that
[1:44:52] reflects the one that's living inside of
[1:44:54] you and that's it you may never raise a
[1:44:57] person from the dead you may never lay
[1:44:58] hands on the sick you may never speak in
[1:45:00] tongues but if you live by the word it
[1:45:02] shows that there's a word living inside
[1:45:03] of you
[1:45:05] amen Changes Everything About You
[1:45:08] changes your life changes your desires
[1:45:10] change your mind changes your focus
[1:45:12] changes your
[1:45:13] priorities changes your likes and your
[1:45:16] dislikes all by what bringing you
[1:45:19] subject to this one book amen makes it
[1:45:22] live in you that's what the new birth is
[1:45:25] amen it doesn't stop it doesn't stop you
[1:45:30] say well I've been born again yes but
[1:45:32] the effect of the new birth is going on
[1:45:34] day by day by day I trust by God's grace
[1:45:37] I'm not what I was yesterday and I trust
[1:45:39] by God's grace tomorrow I won't be
[1:45:41] exactly what I was today it's a new
[1:45:43] birth it's bringing us into that full
[1:45:44] realization of the full manifestation of
[1:45:47] the word in our life everything we read
[1:45:50] everything we hear that's a anointed by
[1:45:53] the spirit it's there to produce that in
[1:45:56] our lives cuz he was the firstborn of
[1:45:59] many Brethren we're the next one that
[1:46:01] can't fall we're seated with him joint
[1:46:04] AES in Christ and all we've got is we've
[1:46:07] got this little bubble of time we've got
[1:46:09] to go through like brother Mark was
[1:46:10] talking about to prove I'm going to stay
[1:46:12] there I'm going to stand with it and the
[1:46:14] only way we can do it is by a new birth
