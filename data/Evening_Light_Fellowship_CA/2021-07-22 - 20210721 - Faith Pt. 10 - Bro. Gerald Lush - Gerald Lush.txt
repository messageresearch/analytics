we're going to the word let's stand and let's sing only believe i think one of my brother jonathan's children there they like this well they like to sing it they like to sing only really amen like i think he's the young one there yeah amen so if if if if he can sing it then we ought to sing it amen and then maybe he needs us to teach him amen so let's be in prayer so the lord bless you and also uh to thank our brother jonathan for the ministry of the word and uh and we certainly look forward to hear our brother again in the future so the lord bless you and i also mentioned that our brother mark was going to speak to us for us but as i said maybe brother john is in five minutes maybe brother mark five weeks he needs he needs to get ready amen but brother johnson is ready amen so we pray the grace of god to brother mark so we'll see when the lord will maybe allow our brother to minister maybe uh once today wednesday sunday maybe next wednesday amen or and maybe and maybe next sunday so let's be in prayer amen because brother sister we're not living 50 years ago we're not living 40 years ago for sure we're not living you know when when luther preached what he preached wesley will preach what he preached the pentecostals preach what they preach brother we're gone far beyond we got that plus that plus that plus amen and brother it's a tremendous revelation that god's requiring of us a tremendous faith that god's required of us amen amen luther had the faith that god wanted wesley had what god wanted amen well god gave them the word to give them that faith exactly the pentecostals had the faith that well as a result of the message that god gave them and what about us amen well the bible god did say pentecost didn't recognize their messenger and pentecost really never really got the revelation of their their message they they didn't didn't realize what god was doing luther did this wesley did that all and then the all the anointing came down because why well even william booth the the old-fashioned salvation army and and the the early preachers in in the in the army they were calling for what they had on the day of pentecost amen see the problem of god said god always says the holy ghost to create in the hearts of his children he said for what he for what they want and what they need amen so you'll create a new a hunger and a thirst and a prayer and amen you're gonna you're gonna call for what what god wants to what you need really amen so brother god sent that call in luther's life for justification wesley sanctification the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen they began to call for it god sent it amen but brother sister what what is god putting us to call for what it was in your heart what's in your soul what's in your spirit amen what's in the message amen that god has given the end time bride brother again the end time faith that god's looking for is resurrection and rapture amen so i pray the grace of god that as a result of father of the prophetic ministry as a result of the ministry that that's carrying that message on whether it's our brother jonathan ourselves here amen brother sister in the ministries around the world brother amen i tell you what it's doing it's giving the bride faith amen look up amen brother is creating a greater and a greater and a greater faith for the resurrection and the rapture but unfortunately the number is getting smaller and smaller and smaller when it comes to the numbers that are going to have that faith i trust that we're going to be numbered with them because when he comes will he find that faith amen will he find that faith amen it's the faith that he had when he was there in the flesh himself now he said now now is the faith that that brother he's looking for when he's here in the flesh of his bride amen brother as i said it was the redemption of our souls and now brother is the redemption of our bodies he was made flesh to do that he's made flesh to do this so i pray grace that we're we're believing amen for the resurrection and for the rapture i pray grace we're believing for the change of our body amen let's sing and only believe all things are possible only believe [Music] oh believe all things are possible [Music] only be amen only baby [Music] all things are possible only [Music] lord i believe [Music] amen [Music] amen all things yes amen the resurrection the rapture hallelujah yes lord i believe with a complete belief amen amen [Music] [Applause] things are possible lord i believe jesus is here amen believe that jesus is here hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah the same yesterday today forever hallelujah the resurrection the life amen jesus jesus is here amen thank you jesus hallelujah [Music] amen all things are possible jesus is there and again lord i believe that we believe that jesus is here amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the lord because jesus is here amen worship him love him hallelujah with all your heart amen [Music] all things are possible lord i [Music] lord trusting by grace this is the faith you're looking for lord this is the faith we need the faith of the coming the fate of the resurrection the faith of the rapture lord we need the faith father the change of our bodies lord as you lay down yours you picked it up again in the glorified condition lord hallelujah that we would also have that faith lord that we're picking up our bodies in a glorified condition because you give us a promise lord hallelujah that we're going to have new bodies like unto your glorified body so lord help us to believe with a complete belief hallelujah that we'll have no question that we'll have no doubt but believe lord that we are living in that hour believing that we are living in that time hallelujah believing lord that you have done what you have prophesied what you have ordained to do to give us the faith that pleases you in these last days show grace to us lord that we committed into your hands and asking lord for the anointing of the holy ghost and we're asking for the moving of your spirit alleluia the holy ghost hallelujah in us with the word father hallelujah to make the word of more and more and more reality to us amen father is not a dead letter hallelujah but it's a living revelation hallelujah that you made the word flesh in jesus and thank you lord that you're making the word flesh in us hallelujah father that oh my lord hallelujah that he came and lord and he laid down his life he picked it up again praise the lord hallelujah and the word was made alive forevermore and he came back to share it with us oh glory glory glory hallelujah lord i pray in jesus name lord that we have the faith lord that pleases you we have the faith lord wherein that word can be made a life forevermore praise the lord and not a dead letter but the living revelation father of what you have done and the living revelation of what you are doing elvis i pray in the name of jesus let go and let you have your way amen let go and let you father have control to make the word flesh in us amen yes with the word of promise for the resurrection the word of promise for the rapture oh lord i pray father that you won't have to wait on us any longer amen praying grace that the dead in christ are not waiting any longer lord but lord we have been brought to that faith father that will bring them forth brought to thy faith will bring some manifestation lord the resurrection hallelujah changing us into a glorified condition for your glory your honor your praise praise the lord father grace that will enter into a oneness with you for the glory of god be with us tonight lord increase our faith father anoint the word father in the name of jesus father knowing that faith cometh by hearing the word of god and lord we're praying and believing lord that we're hearing the word that you've ordained for this hour hearing the word that you've ordained to give us the faith that pleases you so lord let us let go amen let us not be afraid but let us amen trust in you with all of our hearts and believe with all of our hearts father that the word of the hour the message of the hour is ordained predestinated to give us the faith for the rapture amen to give us the faith for the resurrection to give us the faith lord to bring father the saints who are

hallelujah lord i believe lord i believe lord i amen amen oh his question is love us thou believeth thou this amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah [Music] praise the lord amen lord i believe all things are amen yes all things are possible lord i believe amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah god bless you turn with me to the book of luke chapter 18. saint louis gospel chapter 18 praise the lord and the grace of god as we go into the word and again faith cometh by hearing the word amen the faith that god wants us to have in this hour brother he's ordained and predestinated the word to give us that faith amen not going back to luther not going back to wesley not going back even to the early pentecostals but brother into this end time word message hallelujah the mystery of god in these last days to give us the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture god help us to keep believing what he did in the past amen and brother he's going to add to that faith from saint justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but now we're going on further than that to the eternal life praise the name of the lord it's just not focusing on what god has done here amen and brother down through the ages no brother he's focusing on what god has did amen when he came in flesh amen in the flesh of jesus and now focusing on what what he's doing in flesh now that jesus is made flesh in us amen the word is made flesh again amen so let go and let god have his way by the grace of god amen and in the book of luke chapter 18 and beginning to read let's see let's maybe start to read at verse 1 and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint amen stay in fellowship with god stay in communion with god don't be afraid amen rebuke the devil amen and go and talk with the lord and it says saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man and there was a widow in that city and she came under him saying avenge me of mine adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god as the prophet said god doesn't fear himself and he said nor regard man and yet because this widow troubled me i will avenger amen lest by her continual coming she weary me brother through seven ages amen but in the last age he steps on the scene to provide what she had need of and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not god avenge his own elect amen which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them praise the lord and i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless he's going to avenge his elect amen nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and thank god that our brother scofield here the faith that he referenced is a hope is a belief in the whole body of revealed truth amen so brother sister that's what god's looking for now and that's what's going to please god now that's what's going to bring them on the scene with resurrection and rapturing faith amen is those that are believing in the whole body of revealed truth amen that was revealed in christ amen and he was the resurrection and the rapture and now he's revealed in his bride a man to express and reveal again the resurrection and the rapture amen praise the name of the lord god bless you so he said again in verse you may be seated he said again in verse 8 i tell you that he will avenge them speedily amen nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth because there's going to be so few that are left here believing there's going to be so brother time is going to go on to maybe the vast majority of so-called believers in what god has done and what god is doing they'll be going on amen well they'll they'll be taken off the earth amen and god is going to let it go on and on and on and it's been maybe what it's so many like 50 years or more since the prophet of god has gone it's been 50 years or more since the opening of the word the revealing of the mystery of god amen through through the opening of the word and through the prophetic ministry amen how much longer will it be amen because they and it's the truth because that's why that back then that after after in 1965 after the prophet of god was taken off the scene and and the believers back then who were in control they they had to go and they had to go and and oh yeah put guards around the grave william write them oh yeah because there were those that believed that after three days william branham was coming was going to be resurrected oh yeah that he was going to come back and then others believe oh well well it'll be it'll be seven days it'll be a week or it'll be this number and that number and and until finally brother sister got to the place where it was getting so so uh crazy there where there these ideas oh yeah and the and then this group was coming that group was coming to the grave another coming to the grave and well what were they going to do some of them were going to dig the grave they're going to dig it up because why they want they felt they wanted to prove that if they could open the coffin that the coffin would be empty oh yeah that's what they thought and so that went on for a number of years amen until finally of course you know now you know what they did what they had to do they had they had to put that pyramid over the grave amen because before there was just maybe just a marker right the grave and just the headstone whatever but now it got to the place where so that uh to just to discourage those believers and all all due respect for them you know and so on when it comes to they believe the problem of god went down but they also believed that after three days seven days a week whatever three years that he was resurrected so they kept going back because they wanted to be able to dig it up and prove that the coffin was empty well i think if you can go back and if you want to dig it up and open the coffin again he won't be empty not not by any means i i don't think brother brown was expecting that because i believe that that's the body that goes back to the dust amen and you're going to receive a glorified body you're going to say oh yeah amen because that one was born in sin shaped in iniquity and so on and so brother it was under the curse and thank god for the grace that that god gave our prophet amen and the faith that he had amen he was looking up amen and so he's not there any out amen if you went and dig the grave just just a day or two after after they buried him amen his body would still be in the in in the coffin but he wasn't there amen not by any means but he was in glory waiting on us by the grace of god amen because brother and sister you know what happened to him god showed brother branham what what happens when a person dies and of course and he was in it he was laying in his bed in his bedroom when he looked up no and he any any and the oh he got a he went into another dimension and oh yeah all his body was his physical body was still on the bed and he could look back and see it but he looked at himself going into another dimension amen where the saints of god were waiting for him amen right here and he went in there and he had fellowship and he met the angel and the angel told him this told him that and the angel showed him and showed him a a a young sister there and uh he always said you he didn't know her always said she was she was only just a young oh no she was not she was around 95 years old when he said you want you letter to the lord during your ministry and by showing he looked like a young woman and he said what yes he said but that's the whole she was back there but this is what she is here in this dimension amen and they were all having this and those that were under brother brown's ministry amen oh they were all get get together in that dimension those that had gone on amen brother they were fellowshipping one another and then over somewhere else with another group that was fellowshipping with one another amen maybe the pentecostals maybe the lutherans maybe the methodists and and this group or this revival or that revival amen and then there were those that were that came under the prophet's ministry and here they were in that dimension amen and they were in those theology bodies and they were philosophy one another amen praise the name of the lord but why oh yeah because they knew what what what they had well they agreed on the earth and what oh yeah they had this in common that in common they believed the message this this one believed the message and so on amen so brother sister when you die basically brother we can you me well whether it's me or brother mark or brother bob brother david here you know you know you know white hair and so on amen or the sisters amen but brother sister they can put that body down oh my now look look look they're old no they're not amen if we could look into that other dimension they're young amen they're they're they're oh their theophany bodies are young and then they're going to believe for the resurrection belief for the rapture when they'll have real bodies but they're still going to be young amen by the grace of god there's no old age there amen when i get if my grandfather is there he won't be 80 out of 90 years old like he was when he died not by any means and one of my grandfathers i might have been 92 no no not by any means they're going to be young praise the name of the lord and as i was thinking about one of my grandfathers that that went on and uh oh my he was he was very very very old but oh my he his air was still dark and he had very little you could almost count the the number of gray ones that he had in his head and the rest of it was still still almost black amen and he was around 90 years old oh what yes and and i remember too and i'll never forget that when i was in in the house where he was amen and he came out and he said oh he said brother gerald he said i got a question he said would you answer he said it's a bible question he said i want to know he said what what the bible but this means he said it describes our lord and he said this word and so on and he didn't understand that word and he thought oh it didn't mean good it didn't mean this and i said oh my i said grandpa i said i said in our language i said we just think it means this it just means that but i said let me explain it i said when it comes to the revelation of the word of god i said this is what that word means and i said concerning him concerning god concerning jesus oh well praise the lord and he was standing there in in the kitchen next to the stove as it were and he had his bible in his hand and he was reading the scripture and i explained to him oh wonderful he said thank you he said praise the lord he said that's wonderful he said i've been wondering about that for so long but thank god he said now i have peace amen praise the name of the lord so hallelujah so i believe by the grace of god because of his faith the brother easing glory in a young body amen he believed the word oh yeah but i'll tell you this he couldn't he couldn't they couldn't use him books he couldn't use any other book because why he couldn't read he couldn't read it no no you could give him this and give him that no i know i i can't read or or his son was there that he was living with his son and uh and and he he would not not bother to give him anything he always said he can't read he said there's only one book he can read and he said that's the bible i said what oh yes he said he said he'll read the bible he said day in day out amen he said he's going to read the bible in the morning read the bible in the afternoon he'll read the bible again at night amen oh i said because i thought he could read because he came out and he read a scripture that just said god was this god was that and he didn't understand that word amen so but he could read brother i pray god amen brother how much attention do we give to the word amen whether there's the the thus saith the lord the word the bible amen or whether it's the reveal the revealed word of god the revelation that god has given us to a prophet amen how much attention are we given to god i tell we're living in a world that's given a lot more and more and more and more attention brother to to the internet more and more attention whether to the foolishness of man but not god amen then i've given the attention to god and what god has done and what god has said amen brother sister but if you're a believer brother this is more important to you than the world amen oh can you did you read this no not interested in it amen brother sister is there ever an hour that we should have less and less and less interest in what the world is printing brother it's this hour amen because more and more now we realize that what we read in the word is becoming more and more reality amen it's recording more and more yes and not only that but it's becoming history and brother we're we're getting getting further and further away from time and we're getting closer to eternity oh please i pray god in the name of jesus give us the faith that god has ordained for us to get through the message of the hour amen brother i tell you this the faith that god that god was was was giving through the luther's age and your paul rather but luther amen through through justification amen they preached it morning noon and night and as i said to john wesley when he had the message of sanctification oh brother he would go even he would preach five times a day what oh yeah he would go to the to the minds there and he would preach to the soldier to the workers that were going into the mine amen and then he would wait for those that were coming out and then he'd be there to preach to them amen and then he gonna preach to that one then they go preach to somebody else five times a day he preached amen and then there's another time that he would go go to a cemetery amen he'd go to a church but brother he couldn't go preaching the church because there was too many amen the church wasn't big enough so that he would go out into the cemetery amen john wesley would and what he would do america he never had a pulpit oh so he found a he found a a headstone amen and he went and found a certain headstone there that he could stand on and he would get up and get up on the the headstone and preached amen and then the others would gather all around the cemetery and listen to john wesley preach amen just think five times a day amen and then one time oh yeah when it comes to church and services we'd have services maybe three four times a week amen some would have it five times a week in the times of revivals that happen almost every night amen and maybe sometime during the day and now it's down to two two times a week some maybe three times i don't know amen but i tell you it's going to get less and less and less because the groups are going to get smaller and smaller amen or and i'll tell you the groups that are going to get bigger brother forget it they're not amen the larger the group the further away from the faith they're getting amen because he said when he come will he find faith on the earth amen faith well you think it it oh the bigger the church and the bigger the number oh my they'll have faith no they might have an intellectual faith but they won't have a spiritual faith amen they might have they might as the prophet of god is i i just read it somewhere today there where he was saying oh yeah i said they're putting too much emphasis on it's on on the the dynamic dynamics to letter mechanics yeah that's right they started putting they're putting too much emphasis and more and more evidence on the mechanics of the word and not the dynamics amen that's the truth well one time the emphasis was on the dynamics the power of the living word and now it's just the letter of the word amen oh this doctrine that doctrine amen and as i said there's things that are eaten in this message it it oh this is this is our creed oh yeah oh we uh we believe this we believe that amen and as i said one night before i say when it comes to these these printed messages i should just say i i had to deal with a lot of believers over over the last you know number of years for me well say 50 years or more amen and i said you know i said when it comes to these books i said there's a lot of believers that i've dealt with i said you know what they should do i said they should start at the last page not on the first page or the last page why because all they're interested in was signs and wonders amen other interesting was god was what god was doing through william branham not the revelation of the word but the signs and wonders oh yeah the healing yeah amen and god did this and god did that the discernment and this is why a lot of churches this is why a lot of groups in the ministry of the prophet that's why they wanted william branham oh yeah and not only that it got to the place where where even all due respect to her brother oral roberts but he he called william ran him aside and he said uh brother branham and and he said we appreciate the ministry and we appreciate this we appreciate that but he said brother branham he said we want you to get up and do this and do this but he said you're going to have to stop preaching this oh yeah he was encouraging brother brown to stop preaching concerning the sisters and how they should act and how they should dress and he had to stop preaching concerning the brothers how they should act and how they should dress amen and about being spiritual and not religious oh yeah so that's why they wanted they wanted brother brown to stop they oh yes it was brother roberts they called him a sight and says your brother brown you'd have to stop it amen and because he wouldn't stop it they stopped him amen they never bothered to have him wouldn't wouldn't invite him in their services wouldn't have him to do this wouldn't happen to do that where as before before they came to that conclusion oh yeah oh yeah they they wanted william branham william branham wait a minute oh yeah and he'd come in and do this and show these signs show these gifts oh yeah because that's why a lot of a lot of so-called people will go go to old robbers meetings that's why they would go to te la altar meetings that's the way they would go to aal and meetings amen and me the other evangelists why signs and wonders amen and all and you know what they would preach signs and wonders amen they go in the bible and oh yeah in the bible and they would preach about jesus and his signs and wonders they preached the prophets and their signs and wonders oh yeah i i've been under those ministries i've experienced those ministries amen amen and and not not that i did it because i was young back then amen but i was associated with a lot of so-called uh uh pentecostals and well they they had a pentecostal experience and so on amen not necessarily denominational but they supported these evangelists they supported this avengers that evangelist that event oh yeah and i i remember going into a certain homes and brother and then there was a allen's uh magazine it was uh oral robbers magazine it was teal osborne's magazine amen oh yeah oh yeah signs and wonders god doing this god doing that amen but the emphasis was on the signs and the wonders but not on the word amen the only part of the word was the word that spoke about signs and wonders amen the the word that emphasized oh jesus did this god did this the prophet did this yeah but not what they said what they did amen but brother our emphasis is not what william branham did is what william branham said amen is what god said through the prophets amen and reporting our emphasis on the word amen and brother and god elvis that we're not going to put our emphasis on evangelists and preachers and pastors that might go around the world amen and they got signs and no wonders and they're doing this and they're doing that oh yeah with and they're message preachers oh yeah and urge and oh yeah and and and this church wants this preacher oh well come come visit us come visit us come visit us amen why because there oh we like this we like this we like that what what what about the word amen well they though they say oh well we like the preacher he's got a nice attitude he got a nice spirit oh my he can preach what did he preach amen that's something else what did he preach amen oh oh he just preached the word what well the devil preaches the word he always yeah who that was he was the father as i said in the bible there he was the first evangelist amen god gave the word and he came to eat with through to with the with the evangelistic ministry and say oh yeah yeah yes god said but all he had he quoted the word amen and all the way down through satan comes in quotes the word amen brother and then again outside there was there was cain and there was cain and abel praise the name of the lord amen there was something else that the lord was going to lay on my heart amen for the minister concerning concerning you know what was going on in the garden of eden outside the garden of eden amen there was cain there was abel amen but they were both believing the word oh yeah amen but brother do you look look how look in believing the word look at the effect it had on abel versus the affected arcade amen oh yeah they believed and mccain did this oh yeah the sacrifice sacrificed sacrifice amen oh oh oh i felt the lord's going to be like lord the lord will respect my sacrifice amen oh yeah a lot of as i said if oh my i said if we went into a church cage church and he had his sacrifice there oh my it looked beautiful oh my wouldn't that look it wasn't wonderful to think like what came they had on the altar outside the garden of eden and i oh we think that's wonderful amen but what if we went to keynes well we went to abel's church amen abel people what the world you're doing oh don't you respect god yes but god doesn't god respect you god respect you he respects your faith amen oh yeah that way god respects you it's your faith amen so i asked abel oh not many would go into that church what oh my you go in there he got he got a lamb killed in this and it's all cut and the blood is all over the altar every what oh yeah oh we don't want to go into that church that's a mess amen but brother it please god amen oh it please god because why because abel offered faith amen it was oh praise the lord brother oh no well cain he was worshiping god and only he was acknowledging god and and he felt this would be a good sacrifice to to give to god amen oh but cain went out and did this or abel rather went out and what abel abel what in the world are you going to offer that for that's a mess and you're killing that lamb and it's blood everywhere blood over here well i guess abel had a add a witness to give the cane the king didn't appreciate amen and cain killed him amen and you know king killed abel brother and there's believers today that kill one another they do not physically but they their their their reputations and so on oh yeah they kill one another so brother be on your guard amen by the grace of god amen and god because amen god called god called cain and said cain won't you be all right if you do well you do this do this you know and where's abel he tried to deny it but god knew amen what who what what cain had done brother i pray grace god help us we better every speck amen oh we think this we think that we're leaving with the lord and respect them amen and pray the grace of god cain wasn't or abel wasn't there to condemn cain he left that abel just well abel amen the fact that abel's life and and the blessings that god gave abel god god accepted abel's sacrifice amen that was a witness to cain amen so brother the life you live and god's blessing in your life will be a witness to others just go live it you don't have to show off no siree god let god be could control you amen and you'll have a right spirit and a right attitude right motives right objectives amen said it shows brother it's not you in control it's god it's jesus amen of your life you young sisters and brothers here amen the older brother yeah even even us older ones brother because again amen whether it's the younger ones whether it's the older ones we better make sure that is god in control and not us amen because we had the younger ones amen the devil is there to try to control you your your thoughts your motives your objectives your feelings amen and as you get older satan is still there to maybe get you to go on your feelings instead of your faith amen so brothers make sure as as you young brothers and sisters make sure you're going by faith amen faith amen and with you as you get older faith governs you faith controls you amen what you do lord i want i want to be controlled by faith what is your will amen by the grace of god so amen so what controls you you young people here what controls you how are you living how are you walking how are you talking is is god in control in your heart in your soul in your mind is god in control of your failings are you living for him or living for yourself are you living for him or your feelings are you living for him or for the devil amen brother brother if we're living for him oh yeah you do you don't forgive you always remember god amen as i said i i wasn't giving glory to myself but other others when i was younger they they were all they they were putting emphasis on on on on journal not necessarily brother jordan all the journal because that was the ones that i was raised with and family friends and wherever i went to school or whatever oh sure uh they felt that if there's any spiritual any religious they're all astral what why me because they felt oh well he's religious but i didn't know i was not then amen it was just the nature that what god was putting was emphasizing in me by the grace of god amen and it was there amen even though i wasn't given the absolute you know attention to it all but yet they knew there was a spiritual part there amen but again as you get older it takes control and god takes control amen praise the name of the lord as the seed of god on the inside of the inside in your heart why amen the engrafted seed of the word of god amen and it's in the heart amen and praise the lord amen and we come on down and i'll tell you this if there's anybody knows us there the devil knows it's there yeah he knows amen god knows us there amen and as you grow up god's going to work on it as i said i wondered i said why when it went in in our homes and why that when when something happened serious amen as i do recall this amen when my uncle died and it was my mother's brother and as i said it was my brother my mother said he had a stove there and oh she was oh absolutely oh right right right so sad and crying and so on and to the point where she had she had some dollar bills there in her hand and uh and she took it she opened the side of the stove there and threw it in amen and and those three or four dollars that she had her hand she said through the storm burned it amen or no you wouldn't do that but that showed that how much that she was she was so grieved amen and my father was there and then finally they both spoke up and says joel they said we need your help i said what i'm only maybe 10 years old i said what they said yes they said we want you to write and write a note so to put on these flowers that we're going to give to your uncle's grave what uncle's funeral i said me yesterday said we want you to do it amen so i had to go on right i wrote it and then oh they said wonderful they said we'll put that on the amen on the flower amen so again i was 10 years old not being religious altogether not being spiritual amen but again like i said i was raised in the salvation army amen oh yeah we were raised we like on sundays we went to church sunday morning we went to church again sunday afternoon for sunday school and went against church again sunday night oh yeah we we went there 10 30 or 11 o'clock sunday morning we were there again for three o'clock maybe sunday afternoon amen for sunday school oh yeah there well then we were back back there again versus oh i guess first the servant was usually seven o'clock on sunday night but we were there for a half hour before yeah but it's getting less and less and less now amen but there's fewer and fewer giving such preeminence to jesus give himself preeners to god so god elvis to be spiritual amen brother and until we become spiritual brother let it let amen let it be god christ in you pray lord let i prayed and anoint me anoint me and help me lord to stay with you and to stay with your word amen help me lord that i'm not going to compromise with the world the things of the world the pleasure of the world but lord i'll stay with you and your word and love you and serve you amen let me be a witness to jesus amen i pray the grace of god to you here today lord are those that may be hearing my voice that god is going to make you a witness a living witness a living testimony of jesus christ in these last days amen because again oh i pray grace because jesus said when he comes shall he find faith on the earth amen because the world is going to be so bad and the word's gonna be so unbelievable amen so much doubt there's gonna be little faith grace of god brother he's gonna have somebody that's gonna believe the word unto the resurrection and to the rapture amen oh but how many how many will he need only one is enough he had won 2 000 years ago amen and let that one be made flesh in you he'll do the same thing amen he's made flesh in the bread what for resurrection and rapture amen the word was made flesh two thousand years ago for the resurrection and the rapture they laid him down but he raised it up amen they put him into the turn but he came out amen praise the lord and now he is made flesh in the bright amen brother he went after his after his resurrection he ascended up amen as the prophet of god said where they were saying where is the body where's the body that jesus laid down his life for amen and raise it up again well he said he took it up and he said it before the throne amen and he said as a witness that the price was paid amen that he laid down his life he picked it up again amen by the grace of god and then he said what did he do he left the body there and he was in that body but then he got out of that body and then he came back down amen he said to be in you and with you amen to share the life with you amen the life that he that he that he that he did that he purchased amen in the body called jesus and laid it down picked it up again resurrected it raptured it amen and now he said it's up there yeah waiting for the resurrection and rapture of the bright amen and he said amen praise the lord he said no wonder it's the problem god said he said god is waiting on us amen what for the resurrection rapture and he said the dead in christ are waiting on us well god helped us brother have faith god elvis then oh yeah we believe what god has done god has done what do we believe what god is doing amen concerning the resurrection and the rapture they're waiting on us the dead in christ amen what for the resurrection rapture amen jesus is waiting on us because again the prophet has said he said what's going to happen for the resurrection rapture east of the dead in christ he said they're going to come forth amen oh glory glory but i'll tell you they're waiting on us to come to that faith resurrection rapturing faith amen to believe believe believe brother we got to be looking for him yeah we got to be expecting him amen not not just ignoring it and going on you know oh yeah i believe in the resurrection i go on no no if you believe in the resurrection you're sensitive to it in your soul and your spirit and amen lord the saints are right there oh my lord the the brothers and sisters that i that i was raised with the older ones or they're gone on and lord i believe that some of them are right there amen they went down with that resurrection and rapturing faith in them they went down with that anointing of the resurrection in them amen and oh yeah they just put the body down there but they went on into a in into into another dimension glory praise the lord over when that body is laid down that goes back to dust amen but they're going to come forth in a glorified body amen god elvis whether it be if there's ever an hour that we ought to be conscious and of it and more more aware of what god is doing it's this hour concerning the resurrection and rapture amen brother we've been believing jesus laid down his life raised it up amen the resurrection and brother jesus also demonstrated the example of the rapture amen he died he resurrected and he raptured that body amen and they come back in the bright you come back in the believers amen what for to share with us that that that experience amen so that because amen to those who also believe in the resurrection and the rapture amen by the grace of almighty god they're waiting on us amen and jesus is waiting on us because he said the prophet of god said and he said oh yeah he's waiting when we come to that place amen that faith and he said oh yeah on the dead in christ is going to appear to us praise the lord that's right the dead in christ are going to appear to us and he said oh hallelujah we're going to recognize oh grace that we're going to have the holy ghost so we'll recognize them we'll know who they are amen oh yeah and we're we're all thank god praise the lord moses was here today we're all going to go we're all going to go back to young bodies maybe 20 years old amen and our are our sisters and brothers here that are younger oh you you you'll step into a glo you'll step into a glorified body and you'll be around 20 years old oh yeah by the grace of almighty god amen praise the lord oh yeah and he said the dead in christ is going to appear to us because we're ready for them we have the faith for them with them amen praise the lord and they appear to us and he said then we we're going to go with them into into that into that dimension amen we're going to step out of this to mention brother sister at a time into eternity and we're going to have fellowship with them amen and he said then jesus hallelujah he said jesus he said he's going to go up he said the holy ghost he'll go up he said to the throne and he said he'll get into that body called jesus amen and then he'll oh oh after after we're fellowshipping with them oh we look up oh there he is there's jesus amen we have the holy ghost with us we have the holy ghost yes it is jesus in the form of the spirit with us in us amen but during the time of the resurrection rapture when we when you we unite with those that are gone on we get into that dimension and he said just after a while we look up jesus goes up to that throne gets into that body and he comes back down we look up there he is and we'll rise to meet him praise the lord hallelujah in eternity by the grace of god god help us to be laid brother concerning the ministries that god has sent and oh yes and we're in that christ has revealed himself christ has demonstrated his power brother right right from right here we can go right on back to the old testament amen and the power of god in the prophets the power of god in jesus hallelujah and the power of our lord jesus christ in the church ages amen and especially during the pentecostal age yeah and there was other church there was other ages there too there's other other revivals god sent and was what it was revealing the power of god resurrection of god hallelujah coming on down into the pentecostal revival on into the bright age amen for the rapture oh praise the lord oh god help us to believe brother it's not just going from you know going from one church to another one church age to another one age to another one age to another no no brother it's all moving up to the rapture amen brother as in the old testament it went from one prophet to another one prophet to another one private to another to finally it came to the god prophet amen the word was made flesh in christ and finally the word is fully made flesh in the bride this is jesus christ amen praise the lord hallelujah for the resurrection and the rapture amen brother what god never gave them that faith there or there or there but lord and brother and sister in the last hour in this hour through what he did in the ministry of william branham brother i tell you not just to get us out of the denomination it is to get us into the bride to recognize who we are where we are amen and what god is requiring of us amen brother god gave luther a revelation of what he hauled down through the ages he gave them a revelation of what he required of them amen and what do you want then to go out and preach now okay oh oh oh praise the lord and they went out and preached this went out and preached that went out and preached that and so on amen but now brother what god wanted us to preach what does he want us to preach that says that god sent a prophet yeah that was all right one time and we've gone beyond that oh yeah and we had to deal with that in the ministry because i came to the message in 1966 and i was baptized and i believe maybe august uh brother bill eggett baptized me in bishop falls in 1966 in august amen because amen because oh yeah i was going to pentecost in here but again we were not denominational and we we just believed that you know god was this was the the last great revival that god had was pentecost and we just stayed with them but we didn't we didn't support denomination and so on and finally for for me that was i was baptized in pentecost in 1965 yeah december 1965 and it was again in the early 1966 that i that i received amen because i used to still have fellowship with brother sister burns and the saints in gamble and finally it's in early 1966 i finally got witness from them that god has sent a prophet no they just mentioned to me about william branham and sister burns oh yeah she was that she she was listening to the records and not the tapes it was a record of william branham's life is is his life story yeah on a record and that's what's that's the first time that sister burns heard william branham amen and she was talking about always a tremendous brother tremendous amen wonderful wonderful ministry and again not recognizing the messenger to the ages or whatever but just recognizing that it was that it was god amen in the man and finally when i got there in the summer amen and i spoke to sister goldie she said brother i got great news and i said what's that she said god has set a prophet amen oh i said who's that and she said his brother william branham oh brother come we're going to have a wonderful testimony amen concerning what god has done and what god is doing oh yeah amen and again was in 1966 that that that the the brothers and sisters came from bishop falls amen the church there and we had we had a cottage meeting in gamble oh yeah sister barnes and brother and sister goldings amen oh yeah and the brother preached praise the lord god help us brother putting our attention not on pentecost not on the power not on the anointing for these gifts but brother we are moved beyond it to the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of almighty god amen god gave them faith amen faith luther's faith patience and says godliness brother kindness justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit now where do we now where are we amen god the faith that god gave them revealed that now what is the faith that god gave us revealing amen what what is it causing us to put our attention on what's it causing us to put our focus on amen what's it causing us to pray for hunger for amen by the grace of god remember they hungered and thirst for what god wanted to do now are you what are you on being thirsty for amen oh yeah luther wanted it and god gave it to him amen wesley one day god gave it to him they hungered they thirsted for it they went and they preached it amen and lived it so are we preaching it and living it the resurrection and the rapture amen sir are we being caught up amen into a spiritual dimension by the grace of god amen god help us amen that we're going to walk in the spirit amen we're going to live in the spirit amen as they did manifesting what god had revealed amen so let us do it manifesting and confessing what god has revealed to us in these last days amen and what is it it is the resurrection and the rapture and the prophet of god has told us he said all that god has done and revealed he said is to bring us to this place of rapturing faith amen the conclusion thereof is rapturing faith god has done this god has done that amen that's good praise the lord what what faith is it giving you oh they gave the others that faith they did this they did this they did that amen so what are we doing yeah but the faith that god has given you and brothers takes more than just coming to church oh yeah we're gonna we we oh we go to church because you know we believe this we believe that but again it's just doctrines of theology and so on but is it faith oh yeah to a lot of people it's just just a creed as i said this here is creed oh this is the part of their creed they or perfect faith and many many others oh yeah just the creed just the our creeds of when it comes to creeds they have a much larger creed than those in denomination because they got so many of these messages and so on but brother to the bride is not a creed it's a faith it's a resurrection and a rapturing faith if there's anything that god is making more and more and more real to us is the resurrection and rapture amen the end time faith is resurrection and rapture amen and brother it's not a personal faith or a personal belief in god no it is a belief in the whole body of revealed truth amen because it's ordained to give us the faith that god wants us to get the resurrection the rapture amen brother christ was the whole body of revealed truth in flesh now the whole body revealed truth is in the bride amen so brother the climax of the revelation for the elect in this hour is the resurrection and the rapture if then god is looking for anything in you and me as a result of the ministry of the word it is resurrection and rapturing faith amen brother and it is brother it is a life that is putting more and more emphasis on resurrection and rapture you're living for the resurrection you're living for the rapture by the grace of god you're hungry for the resurrection you're hungry for the rapture brother because i tell you this why did god do this for luther and wesley and and and those in the early early pentecostal age amen because this is what they were hungry and thirsting for amen brother because god revealed this and and brother where did luther where did wesley get the revelation of sanctification he got it in a lutheran cottage meeting he did yes he was in a lutheran cottage meeting when when a brother was preaching concerning they were sanctified by faith justified by faith justified by faith and he what god had revealed to do martin luther and john wesley was there and and and they were worshiping and he stood up and he raised his hands and he and he said he said he felt the anointing and he said from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet oh yeah and he said why because he said when he was preaching he said say justified by faith and this and this and this revelation that revelation it struck him concerning sanctified amen because amen because luther thought that he had they had to do this and do this and do this amen and god would justify him amen but god given the faith jesus justified him amen amen and john wesley amen and the methodists they thought they had to do this and do this and do this oh to live a sanctified life huh to be sanctified no until finally when he was in that country's meeting it struck him oh justified by faith or he said we're sanctified by faith thank you jesus you did it amen you did it lord amen oh and and and john wesley started to praise the lord and he said i felt the anointing of sanctification amen go from the crown of his head to the souls of his feet he said jesus sanctified me amen he didn't have to get up you know what five o'clock or four or five o'clock in the morning and pray for two or three hours and then they had to go through the day and do this and preach this often and then he had to pray so another couple of hours and he'd go pray another couple of hours before they before the night time oh yeah that's what they that's that's that's what they they were trusting for sanctification amen right and like i said luther thought he had to go here and go there and he'd walk and walk and making sacrifices why because he felt that's what he had to do for justification until god revealed that jesus justified him amen amen amen and wesley got the same revelation oh oh lord you've sanctified me all right already oh and if i really got the experience it'll go forward and live the sanctified life not that he had to sanctify this i had to think by that god sanctified him amen and brothers the same thing with the baptist of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit is not what we do it's what god does amen came with the resurrection rapture now what we've done is what god is doing amen he wants to he wants to reveal it in us make it flesh in us by the grace of god amen brother let god do it let god take control and brother by the grace of god that we're going to live higher and higher and higher till we get out of time and into eternity oh yeah live spiritual be spiritual talk spiritual think spiritual act spiritual amen you don't have to force yourself to do it if you got the holy ghost you will do it it's just automatic amen and see and what is it they were spiritual amen that's why luther he got the revelation and he went through he went forth amen with that faith and he lived that sanctif that justified life wesley lived that sanctified life and the pentecost went forth oh thank you jesus hallelujah the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen amen and they went forth and manifested it giving god the glory and now there's another group rising amen where are we going to go now praise the lord if god justified us sanctified us fill us with the holy ghost give us access amen the father god said what did god do now he said oh he said he's come down now and he said oh he's not going to do away with the pentecost he's not going to do away with the gifts he said he said there he got them on the shelf there and he said he said if you if any time you need the gift he said they're right there he said buddy god wants to move us on now he said to the resurrection and to the rapture amen praise the lord hallelujah brother if there's anything that the message ought to give and will give not will not to give it it will give it to bride is the resurrection and the rapture god help us brother jesus got to the place amen just think in his ministry after three and a half years he got to the place where he knew he's the hardcore for the to lay down his life and to pick it up again for the rapture amen by the grace of god and to finally say oh yeah there's going to be a tremendous sacrifice yeah and i'll tell you this the enemy is there to try to get us to compromise and you know with the world the things of the world oh he wants to he he wants this oh this is wonderful this is wonderful all you need to enjoy this you need to enjoy that yeah he wants to get us less and less attention on the spiritual and more on the natural brother let's put more more emphasis on the spiritual amen if we got the holy ghost and if we're receiving the word if we're believing the word amen it's going to produce that life it's going to produce that faith you you just go forth you just now oh it just becomes a natural thing to you oh you're going to go there and you're going to live looking up for the rapture expecting the rapture amen it's just like i said one time oh yeah that i was going through a mall one time and well it has happened a number of times for me and i i was looking down the mall and who's that boy that's brother so-and-so is that sister so-and-so i said lord i said is this the time of the rapture is this the time of the resurrection amen i've got to tell you when that hour comes they're going to start to appear as the prophet of god said amen they're waiting on us she said and he said amen when that hour comes and we're ready he said they're going to appear to us oh yeah but not but they're not going to be in if if they were 90 years old when they when when they went on when they come back to appear to us they're going to be in young bodies but we're going to recognize them we'll know them and they'll know us amen because we come from eternity and we're going back to eternity amen praise the name of the lord brother i tell you this if there's anything that this that being born in this flesh does it affects our our spiritual memory yeah oh it caused us to to be blind oh yeah it's blind to this we can't see this we can't see that the more of the holy ghost you get the more the more you're going to see amen amen the more that you're led by the spirit the more that you're living in the spirit and walking in the spirit the more you're going to see and recognize from god amen and oh yeah oh yeah we got to live in the spirit walk in the spirit amen by the grace of god so that when that resurrection takes place we're going to recognize those that are going to appear to us amen the prophet they're going to appear to us and amen we're going to recognize them we're going to be changed and we're going to go with them back into eternity and we're going to see jesus amen brothers to resurrection it's the rapture oh brother amen look what god has done so what's god doing amen we know god has done this god has done that amen down down through these seven church ages brother and concerning the prophetic ministry of this hour oh brother we are we are that we ought to have eyes to see ears to hear or in here not ears the ear of the soul amen i think brother jonathan brought that out single ear yes amen by the grace of god your all your your your hearing with your ears but i trust by grace that it goes when it goes into the heart it's it's the it's one ear amen amen you're going to hear with one revelation one understanding by the grace of god amen don't add to it don't take from it amen believe it take your stand for it amen brother because i tell you this they got to a place where where the luther's revelation wesley's revelation the pentecostal revelation just don't have the effect that it used to have oh yeah they'll go and preach what luther preached wesley preached to pentecostals yeah they'll preach it but they don't have it now it's it it's not it's not in affecting their lives like it used to be why because it's not by faith no and again it's it's the mechanics not the dynamics and brothers unfortunately there's too many now with the message and the revelation of what god has done and what god is doing for the prophet brother there's too many gotta got the mechanics but not the dynamics oh yeah prophet said this god said this god said that god revealed this god revealed that and it's all mechanics but where's the dynamics if god has revealed it to you he's going to live he's going to he's going to reveal it in your life amen soul body and spirit god's going to control you from the inside out amen a new creature inside and brother he's working out amen eternal life to take control by the grace of god god help us that we surrender to end time faith amen that we are laying ourselves more and more in control of end time faith of resurrection and rapture by the grace of god remember day and night martin luther was rejoicing in the faith martin luther was rejoicing in the in the revelation of the truth that god had given him or just think he went for so long figuring that he could do this and be justified do that and be justified but he still he wasn't he never had the peace of it still no matter what he did still he lacked that peace and and he and he had that conviction so lord what's wrong he said i'm doing this we're going here we're doing this we're preaching this we're you know what so finally the lord revealed it to him and you know what it was he went into the church i know that it was a catholic church and because they had and they had bibles in in what we call the portrait there and and and the catholics or whatever they could come in and not coming into the church but they could come over where the bible was and and read it amen and so luther did that one time he was so frustrated that he had tried and tried and tried and tried regarding all i'm doing this lord didn't justify me i'm still not justified still not justified and so on and finally he went into the church and he he opened the bible i think it might have been a book of romans there somewhere and it was opened and he read jesus justified us what lord what yeah we're justified in jesus well it's not what i did is what he did and he read it that read that again and he oh it struck him oh oh brother he had an experience what was it justification amen not conde no he wasn't condemned hallelujah he was justified amen he had the experience of justification thank you jesus oh yes oh he was such a glorious revelation amen and that's where revelation also struck john wesley concerning sanctification amen brother it's a revelation for the pentecostals the gifts the baptism and the gifts of the spirit and it's the revelation for the bride for the rapture they were justified they were sanctified they were baptized with the holy ghost and access to the gifts now were changed from creatures of time to creatures of eternity amen because god was taking control amen and we were getting more and more conscious of eternity and less conscious of time amen praise the name of the lord brother god help us that we're like luther like wesley like the pentecostals god help us to rejoice in the faith amen brother if you believe it you'll rejoice in it you'll thank god for it thank you jesus lord the rapture the resurrection we're believing for lord we want to get out of here the bride wants to go but if you're not bright you don't want to go you know why you'll get too caught up with what's going on in this world you're too caught up with with the natural things of life and you and you feel oh i've got to put the emphasis on this but dance on this on that on that but no and that's the devil and he's getting you more and more caught up with the natural things so you're less less and less caught up with the spiritual less and less conscious of the spiritual oh yeah brother but i pray but what the lord wants you to do is give more more attention to the spiritual and what he's doing and what he wants to do what he requires of us in our souls amen now he's not saying you shouldn't do this and shouldn't do that with natural he knows that as long as we're in this world praise the lord yeah we're we're going to put attention on this and i got to do this and i got to do that yeah but you're going to keep the balance in it you're not going to give the preeminence to the natural more than the spiritual you're going to give the preemis to the spiritual why so that you'll have the right control the the natural let the right control over you amen the spiritual will control you amen so keep the balance in the natural praise the lord and the trouble today is that more and more even a lot of believers brother they've they've they they've they're they have they've lost their balance when it comes to the natural things of life amen there's a lot of believers that are just caught up with the natural caught up with the natural that's truth amen i've dealt with that over the years well and many of them have gone on but i know that they were living just for the natural the spiritual oh i believe the message i believe god sent a prophet amen i believe this i believe this amen these doctrines and so on but still they put more and more answers on the natural things of life and less on the spiritual oh yeah they just caught up with the wit uh family friends neighbors and so on no i'll tell you this the bride is caught up with the spiritual family yeah amen the bride is caught up with the resurrection the rapture jesus amen that's right oh yeah you leave the leave it live leave the others with god oh yes but we just just we just gotta love love them yes love them but if you're gonna love them love them with the love of god amen you're loving with the love of god amen oh yeah you're going to live the life form you're going to live it live the word in your form reflect the word amen brother why you can love them with the love of god and there's too many loving them with just natural love physical love oh yeah all just just want to fellowship with them and do this with them and do that with them amen go and live the life of the christian live the life of the right oh yeah you don't have to be overly what you call just religious with them and oh tell them this until no live it live the life it's not what you say it's where you live there's too many go there and there and they just talk it talk it talk it no just leave it amen and so they'll know because again as i said we i haven't forced what i believe on family or friends or neighbors not by any means and and they've had they've had special gatherings and for this a special gatherings for that and a couple of times you know one of them had called me oh she's uh gerald we're having a gathering now and we we're expecting you and sister betty to be there but we're wondering uh uh can we do this and can we do that or would that be offensive to your faith because if it is they said we don't want to do it so god we want you but we want you and sister betty there and sometimes like i said it could be birthday gatherings for some brother you know and so on i said no i said that one that won't offend us oh okay he said good so that we will they said come on they said we watch us there and so on yeah so just keep your attitude right keep your spirit right and live the life yeah amen so they'll know oh uh they don't know what like they say oh that's brother gerald sister betty they believe this but they respect it why because we're not there to force it on them not by any means but they know that that that's the effect that what we believe has on our lives and they respect it and brother if you can go forth with that same faith they'll respect you oh yeah and i know there's sometimes there's gonna be some regardless they'll fight you but but still you take your stance but keep it right keep your attitude right keep your spirit right by the grace of god amen because brother because the hour is coming when there's going to be a where there's there's going to be a great problem to take your you know great temptation to maybe get into the temptation to to compromise no brother and god's allowing this to happen god's allowing that to happen just to see if you're going to compromise or see if you're going to still stay with the truth take your stand amen and don't be ashamed of it but the thing of it is like i've noticed them through the ages that there have been believers that that have been too too arrogant in taking their stand for the word and the message you know they just never had the right attitude and so on and uh and that's why they've turned turn people against them and against the message but keep your attitude right keep your spirit right and they'll respect you and respect the word by the grace of god amen god help us of course then of course there's going to be that hour too and that time when we do take our stand that we're going to be rejected some are going to reject us but again the prophet of god said he said there's god has got it god is good god is ordained he said uh friends he said for the bride yeah friends for the bride he said it's going to be there to protect you and there to help you amen to defend you thank god but again there's going to be there those here that are going to condemn you but just stay with the word by the grace of god amen so brother as i said day and night martin luther was rejoicing in the faith you rejoice in the revealed truth of justification wesley rejoiced in sanctification the pentecost has rejoiced in the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit the bride is rejoicing in the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture amen i pray grace that the revelation of the resurrection rapture is as real to us as justification was to luther amen as the gifts and the baptism was to the pentecostals amen god help us let go let god have his way not me that lives but christ that liveth in me amen bringing the word to pass in your life but whatever is prophesied for this hour he's doing it in you and in me weather morning noon and night do we think about the hour that we are living thinking that the resurrection of the rapture could happen any minute the whole body of revealed truth in this age is a sign that the resurrection and rapture is about to climax amen that's the truth by the grace of god and the prophet has said let me there's a couple of quotes on my didn't think i'd be able to get anything tonight and here nine o'clock i think brother brown said let me say something this uniting time he said to see churches uniting nations uniting it's a uniting time of god and his bride and i say this with reverence and respect i believe that the bride of christ is called i believe she is sealed in the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is there and they're waiting for the dynamics amen they're waiting for the dynamics that'll take her off the earth waiting for the dynamics that will take her into glory in the rapture he said i believe it with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he will do it e he is the dynamics he said we just become members of the machine of his body and forming ourselves into his image and see him uniting himself with us amen see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that amen the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in small measure and he said while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but he said when the head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost would raise her up amen he said just exactly like that and he said even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his holiness praise the lord amen and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the holy spirit praise the name of the lord grace grace grace that we have the dynamics the double portion of the anointing amen with us in us and around us amen what's it doing it's producing perfect perfect faith what's perfect faith the faith that believes no doubt you don't question it you don't doubt it you believe it what yeah you you preach it you teach it you live it but you look you're looking up every day lord you're on praise the lord amen brother i trust that we have such a personal experience and relationship with christ amen amen that we are conscious of him we can't forget him morning noon and night he's there and he's talking to us we're talking to him oh yeah as i said there's time when i'm just driving in my vehicle and oh yes yes lord thank you and and he'll say something and i'll talk to him and i said what about this what about that he's talking to me i'm talking to him amen oh brother uh praise the lord i'll tell you this the closer and closer we get to the resurrection rapture the more and more fellowship we're going to have with him more and more conversation we're going to have with him he's going to be more and more in control oh yeah amen he's going to control your thoughts your words your deeds he's in control so it's not oh praise the lord hallelujah which what the bible says is not me that lives it's christ that liveth in me oh amazing what can you i pray grace that god has given you that revelation that faith now that is not you that lives the life you live it's jesus that lives in you amazing because you can't live the life you live amen separated unto the lord for the glory of god without jesus it's got to be christ in you the hope of glory amen praise the lord hallelujah oh brother sister and again i don't think oh i got to be super spiritual i got to be super no i'm not trying to be super spiritual in that sense no because sometimes we can we can go forth and you know act spiritual talk spiritual but not not be spiritual in our souls amen oh yeah you can act it you can talk it but no is it is it in control of you your life your soul your spirit amen so again it's not me that lives is christ that liveth in me is christ doing this it is jesus christ in me saying this thinking this amen oh yeah thought word indeed is christ in control it's amazing it's a big statement but i trust we're more and more dead to ourselves and more and more alive to him amen amen the more we die to ourselves the more he takes control so i trust he's got more control not the devil satan is working in our flesh and again as the power of god is highlighted and he says satan has got got control here in your mind oh he's got this sense in this sense uh the seven senses and so on and of your flesh and so on and he's working in this working in that but he said god is in here he's got one sense faith yeah so i trust and whether as we feed on the word think on the word and think about the lord and pray the more and more this sense has got control yeah the less we pray the less we talk to the lord the less where we're thinking about the word the less we're thinking about the rapture less we're thinking about the end time oh yeah the the the less that god's got control the less faith got control but the more we're we're thinking about it the more he got control by the grace of god so again this is all that god uses is faith the prophet of god has brought out that he's highlighted it and he said now satan got seven sentences i think he said he said here in the mind he's working down through the census and he said of your flesh and of your your mind your thoughts your feelings and so on but he said god is in here working through the heart faith by the word amen so who was in control of your life today your attitude your actions your reactions who's really in control not that oh well you mean to tell me that i did this this was negative that was not yeah but but again just praying that the negative wasn't controlling you you were controlling the negative or maybe if the enemy was working out some negative feeling in your flesh it would only go so far amen oh yeah because the enemy will come down and he'll do this and do that and then then the holy spirit comes in to apply the token to give you give you power over the enemy amen so oh yeah what for so all you got god allows it to happen to let you know the revelation of grace amen do you need great oh that struck me one day was thinking about it dear a few days ago grace i said lord what's grace and okay we think we're religious we think we're good no not by any means any goodness it's jesus we got none amen that's that only ones we got brother the only thing we can have is jesus well not there's no i'm good i'm this and i'm that no no no no lord forgive me and i was thinking about a certain thing and it struck me oh i cried i said forgive me lord i i'm sorry i said lord i said you mean to tell me that by grace you did this for me and you're doing this for me oh it struck me oh i could almost fall down i said oh lord now i know what grace is this is it is amazing grace lord i said god bless the man that wrote it amen amazing grace not just grace but amazing grace i'll sweep this out and i'll tell you this brother look at yourself and yours and you'll see amazing grace amen amazing grace for me and that's why you'll pray for grace for your brother and sister amen amen mother no but not not by any means can we claim self-righteousness it's just his righteousness that's imputed to us jesus god bless our young brothers god bless our young sisters please please don't forget jesus amen don't forget what he's done for you don't forget what he's doing for you amen he's there defending you in the presence of god oh yeah yeah he's imputing your is righteousness to you thank god amen brother and with that revelation it ought to humble us keep us humble don't exalt yourself humble yourself thank you thank you thank you jesus amen grace he said in this message he that cometh to god must believe that he is he said it is impossible to please god without faith amen amen and he said you have never seen him so then he said you've got to believe it by faith and if you could see him it would be no more faith anything that the census declares is no more faith he said it's a scientific fact and it's not no more faith but you have to accept him by faith belief and he that cometh to god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word of god amen praise the lord through the hearing of the word tonight god has given you the faith to take you on amen god's given you the faith to keep moving on trusting believing thank you amen but with salvation amen you're going to get stronger and stronger and stronger in your salvation unto a resurrection on to the rapture amen praise the lord he said you must first believe that this is god's word for faith cometh by hearing the word and you must come to god by the word just take the word what it says he said everything else is contrary to it everything else contrary to it is not right and abraham had to believe just what the voice told him amen and when he was a hundred years old 25 years later he was stronger believing than he was 25 years ago amen and he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong giving praise to god knowing that he was able to perform what he had promised and that's the way everyone must be that way you must come with an unfailing faith believing that god made the promise but now he says you have to be in a position to have that faith and that's what we're going to talk on to receive that perfect faith amen i'll just finish with this quote he said now these are real deep lessons and i'll catch the top of it and then you dig down amen dig down amen not a form of godliness but knowing your heart is into it digging down into it and he said notice it is something that you possess not imagination if you really have it he said it's just as real as you know that you are writing an automobile it's just as real as you know that you're sitting in a church it's just as real as you hear my voice it is substance not an imagination not an emotion but something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of god he said faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god and he said that puts it back to where your faith is not some in some individual it's not in a man it is in the word of god your faith is in god amen praise the lord but when it is revealed to you it's a faith a perfect faith that cannot fail if god reveals it to you in your heart and in your soul it is a perfect faith on to eternal life amen god's grace be with us amen in the name of our lord jesus christ may we grow in that perfect faith the lord bless you amen let's say number four zero three amen lord bless you sing the wondrous love of jesus sing his mercy and his grace amen grace i'm mere to favor i'm merited have you stopped to consider you're on merited condition oh yeah lord
