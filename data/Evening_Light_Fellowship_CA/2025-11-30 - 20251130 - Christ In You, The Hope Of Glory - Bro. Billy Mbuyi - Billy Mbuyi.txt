It's good to see you this morning. Appreciate everyone coming out early morning like this. So, I thought, you know, if there's a time to ever allow coffee in the service, this would probably be it. Amen. But I'm trusting we're ready to go this morning. Certainly appreciate Brother Billy coming our way. He's got to he's got to preach and then get on a flight and head back home. So, we just want to say thank you so much for coming again. And we've uh my heart's full and we still got one service to go. So, very thankful for that. Excuse me. Amen. Let's just sing that song as we turn it over to him. Thank you, Jesus, for the grace that you have given us. Amen. And we'll give him his liberty again this morning. Amen. Thank you, Jesus, [music] for [singing] the grace that you have given us. though I can't repay. But from my heart, I'd like [singing] to say that [music] I thank you. [music] Thank you my Jesus for the gra. [music] [music] [music] Just sing it one more time. this morning. Oh, thank [music] you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; For the grace that [singing] you have [music] given my heart [music] from my heart. [music] Hallelujah. Amen. What can we say? It's all by his grace and mercy. Why don't we just bow our heads this morning? Our gracious father, Lord, your grace, it's unmmerited [music] favor that you've given us, Lord, for this. Truly this song encapsulate everything that we could say this morning. Father, what no matter what we do, we can never repay for the grace that's been extended. Father, it's an everlasting debt that we look and [music] Father, where we when we see where you've taken us and when we see, Father, our pathway and and and the mercies and grace that's been made known in our lives and Father, the things that [music] you've taken us out of and and Father, all the mistakes we've made and all the foolish things that we have done, [music] but yet your grace was there, Father, to just hold us in and bring us through, Father. Father, it's only in retrospective when we look back and see, Lord, and [music] something within our hearts just say thank you this morning. Lord, we pray that we may never get to a place where we think we do it by our own might or strength, but Father, that the grace that started the work, let it take it to the end, oh God. Father, that we may always rely upon the promised word that you have given and to know that you are faithful and just to keep your word. Lord, we are here once again this morning as your children. Lord, we can never get enough of you, Lord. No matter how much you feed us, Lord, we still want more of you, Lord. And we pray this morning, Father, once again, fill our cups, oh God, and until we overflow, Lord. Lord, our desire when all is said and done is that the world may not see us, that they may see you manifested in our bodies. We commit everything that we are into your hands. And father, we commit the service into your hands. And I pray that Father, if there be any need in the building or to those that are listening, Lord, may you just come and minister to the souls. And Father, that as your children, that we may receive our daily bread and the daily measure of what you have for us in this morning that we may go home satisfied that we've been in the presence of the Lord. We're committed to you and we pray that the uh grace and the mercy and the honor be up to you, Lord, [music] for all that we are. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and ask those things. Amen. Amen. You know, I just I I know brother Jonathan said his heart is full and I want to say my heart is full this morning. It's so amazing that you know, you go uh wherever you go, uh people from different places, but yet we are from the same place. And there's such a kind heart and the desire to see God manifest and the desire to see this end time message be manifested in the people and and and it's not something that you can make yourself become. It's a work that he has done and we want to fellowship on that. And I just want to apologize this morning for having you here so early and I trust that something may be spoken to just wake you up and you know get you going and and and you know our schedule was a little tight but you know uh we just wanted to be in fellowship with you and I must say so thank you very much. it so meant so much to us and and this has just been such a honor and and to just come and and and spend time with the bride in this part of the world. Thank you. God bless you. Let's open our Bibles this morning. And if we don't get to shake your hands this morning, we'll try to make sure we just leave enough time to go around and shake everybody hands. God bless you and the love of God be with you. Be praying for us. will pray for you until we meet again if the Lord will certainly enjoy our time here. So let's turn in Colossians chapter 1. Very familiar scripture reading. And we'll read just a couple of verses and we'll turn in um we'll turn again into another place. Uh Colossians chapter 1 verse 25. It says where whereof I am ministered. I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given unto me for you to fulfill the word of God. Even the mystery which was which has been hid from the from the uh from ages and from the generation but now is made known made manifest to his saints to whom he says God would make known what is the riches of his glory of the mystery among the gentile which is Christ in you the hope of glory also let's turn in Romans 8 we're going to read verse 15. Start from 15. And he says, "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage, again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, aba, father. For the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. And if children then hes of God and join heir with Christ. If if if so be that that we suffer with him, we may also be also glorified together. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. And I want to say this, this is not a future day event. This is now. This is this morning. &gt;&gt; This is this is not even 60 years ago. This is now the glory that is to be revealed in us today. And we'll Lord willing we'll we'll just try to get to what that glory is. And then it says, for I reckon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruit of the spirit, even ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to which to the redemption of our bodies. Our gracious father, we ask that you bless your word once again to us. We commit what we are to you, Lord. Father, we couldn't say thank you enough, Lord. Father, we want our lives to be a song of thanksgiving every day, Lord. Father, that we may not only say it from our mouth, but when people look at us that that they may see that we are a thankful people, Father, thankful for your grace, thankful for your salvation. Thank you for taking us out of sins. And thank you, Lord, and for making us a family of God. Father, thank you that we may be those that you have called and open our eyes that we may see this dark age. And not only that, but Father, that the thanksgiving may be extended to those that don't know you, Lord. That we may show them that there's a people that's on earth that are thankful and that they have received something and their lives are displaying the very things that they have received. We ask you right now that you take the service, Lord, and Father, speak your word to us. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray and ask. Amen. May I have your seats this morning? Certainly want to say I enjoy the specials throughout and all the songs and every I heard beautiful voices. I couldn't identify who was singing, who was not and but it was certainly a beautiful melody. God bless you for that. Amen. So I want to just like I said continue on the thought um and perhaps just bring it in a more general understanding and I want to speak on Christ in you the hope of glory. Um yesterday we talked about identification and we went right through into this but we want to just continue on where we left off. Christ in you, the hope of glory. And I just want to say for myself, I I had listened to the message Christ the mystery of God so many times and throughout the years of of being a a believer and a minister. And I thought I kind of had a grasp of it. But I tell you, it's just been opening more and more to even myself. And I'm looking, I'm like, I don't even understand what is it that he's talking about. And I'm realizing this message is an unfolding message. It's not a message that's already complete. No, it's the unfolding of your life. And God waits until you get to the stage where the next chapter needs to open. He opens it up to you. So, he doesn't give you as a whole package once and for all and you go into a repetition. No. but is a God who's walking with you and continually giving you what you need for the time that you are in. Opening the revelation for you to see where is it that you are and what is it that's unfolding at that time so you can grow in it. Because remember, it's a message that's good from the the new birth unto the rapture. So, it's not that is adding anything new, but it's what's been added is the revelation of that which was already spoken. And that's what we receive every day in our lives. That's why the prophet say revelation is so important because the revelation is what is when God is made a reality in your life. And I want to say this revelation is not your thinking. Revelation is what you live. &gt;&gt; Revelation is not you know we read the scripture we say oh I saw. Revelation is not something new that you come into, but revelation is the new light that gives you the ability to make a step forward. It's not an added intellectual understanding, but it's the opening up of what already existed because we understand God reveals himself in simplicity. The word is the already there. The word is already spoken. But God waits for the season and the time to open it up so you can see who you are. And that's why even in the church of God, we don't want to treat and and and consider everybody at the same level. God will unfold himself from the youngest to the oldest at the stage that you are in so you can receive the food that you need for that time. Because remember this is spiritual food in due season. In due season. So when you get in that season of your life, whatever season you are in, God will unfold himself in that season for you to receive the food that you need. So Christ, the mystery of God revealed it. It's to understand the very purpose of God from the beginning. And to understand, and I want to just say this, it's the the Christ, the mystery of God revealed. And I was talking to brother Jonathan about this. You read what we talked about was invisible union yesterday and it talks about who you are, where you came from, and all of that. But when you go back to Christ, the mystery of God revealed, God is showing you the unfolding of the whole mystery. How that you came to be sinless, how that you came to be perfect, how that how is it that all of that happened, it was all sealed in the single mystery. In Christ, the mystery of God revealed. So and I want to say this when you read this we we as believers as we read this we have to come to the understanding that Christ the mystery of God we are included in the very purpose the the the mystery is not about I want to just let me just say this you are the actual mystery Christ God creation the purpose what says he created the world so he can have a bride in You're like, "Well, I thought he created the world so he can have mountains and so he can have billions of people." No, he created all of that so he can come and get get a bride out of it. He created all of this things so he can come and have fellowship with you in you. You take him from the purpose in the beginning. You take the death of Christ on Calvary. You take all the sacrifice that's been happening. You take all the prophets and you take all the books of the Bible, it all comes down to one thing that God wanted a bride of his own choosing. It says be and then so we find out that before there was any creation. So therefore when he was uh talking about the planning when he when before there was anything before there was any creation God in the beginning he thought of you in the beginning and not that you were an afterthought or just part of the the whole creation but he made you as the central piece of the plan. You are the very central piece of the plan. And we'll read some of that. So God desired, as we said yesterday, his desire was to have a family. His desire was to have sons and daughters and uh born of his spirit, sharing his nature. Let me say this, God didn't create you just so you can come and say, "Oh Lord, I worship you as a servant." When he says that God was not God, when he was not God, he created angels for that. He created angels so he can receive worship. He created the trees and he created that so he can express himself. And if you go, you read it. He created you and you for the sole purpose of having fellowship. He had already the nature that worship him. He had angels that sing holy, holy three times every day and worshiping him and everything. He didn't create you so you can do what the angel was doing. No, he created you for a unique purpose that he can look at someone that was like him so he can look at you and have fellowship with him. God. Just like in in our lives, you know, you grow up and you're a young man and you are a a young kid and you have a family and all of the sudden you grow old and you get to a certain age. You want companionship. You want fellowship. You want somebody that you're going to spend life with you with and all of that. All of that is part of God's nature even being manifested in human being. God didn't want to be alone. He didn't want his glory to just be about him. He wanted to share what he was with somebody and that's the purpose of your creation. He created the world for the purpose of getting the bride out of it. God didn't want to dwell alone. His nature is a loving nature. And love requires an expression. &gt;&gt; You you you can't say you love out of the blue. Like you you can't. AND I WANT TO SAY THIS. That's why it's so important. I I I'm trying not to jump ahead of myself, but but if you could just bear with me for a second. So, love requires an expression. When you say your love, you can't say your love and it's empty word. Love is manifested in works. Love is manifested in you doing something. So if what God was a father, if God was a savior, if God was a a healer and all of those things, it required a place for him to express all of those things. And I want to say this, so God wanted to express his thoughts and his attributes that would dwelt in him, the father, the redeemer, and all of those things. And I want to say this, God's nature of expression, IT HAS NOT STOPPED EXPRESSING ITSELF. When that nature is manifested into THE SON OF GOD, THAT NATURE IS CONTINUAL. THAT'S WHY THE EXPRESSION NEVER STOPS. THAT'S WHY IT'S AN ETERNAL EXPRESSION. WHY? BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE a the desire to to to love and everything, when you become a son and a daughter of God, you have that same love into your heart. When you become a son and A DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU HAVE THAT SAME ATTRIBUTE to want to save somebody. YOU HAVE THE ATTRIBUTE TO WANT SOMEBODY HEALED. WHAT IS IT? It's the continuation of the expression. The expression didn't stay with him. He shared it with you as part of his attribute. And that same expression is continuing in you. &gt;&gt; That's why when you become a believer, you have a heart for the people and they lost souls. &gt;&gt; You can't SAY, "I'M SAVED. THANK GOD I'M SAVED." AND and the world is dying. No. When you see somebody struggling, YOUR HEART GOES after it. YOUR HEART GOES AFTER THEM. AND YOU SAID, "LORD, IF YOU CAN SAVE them and if you can do something." That's why WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY with purple hair or or green hair, don't just look at them and says, "Oh, look at the devil." NO, LET SOMEBODY SOMETHING in your heart call out and said, "OH, YOU KNOW, AND I WANT TO SAY THIS. I love to see people like that because I know at least they're fanatic for something, but oh, if they can be GET CHANGED, I KNOW THAT THEY will give 100% to God." So we the expression is not to be contained and be happy with and say oh I'm safe and I'm a Christian and that's the end of it. No, a expression IS TO BE CARRIED OUT. Is to be expressed INTO A DYING WORLD. IS to look at your neighbor, to look at your coworker, to look at the people AROUND YOU. THAT SAME expression is there. So when the need arises, that expression CAN CALL OUT. I'LL TELL YOU THIS, BUT when I'm says we worship him in many ways in churches and everything, but if you ever been around somebody who's constantly talking negative and everything, DON'T LET them escape from that. He he talks about I believe being in a museum I believe and this professor teacher he's walking around with kids and he goes to a fish and he said that oh look at didn't the Bible says that no uh uh Jonah was swallowed by the fish and he started taking measurements and say look he said how is it that a man can can pass through here you know and everything he said I was over there and I just couldn't hold my peace I love that. I couldn't hold my piss and then I just said, "Sir, that was a speciallymade fish." That was a speciallymade fish. And I'm not talking about being confrontational. You if you make somebody say, "Oh, I'm sick and such and such is going on and and everything." What is it? They're calling out to something. IT'S A CRY OUT. THE WORLD IS CRYING OUT, MY BROTHER, MY SISTER. BUT THE WORLD IS CRYING OUT. THEY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING. THEY REJECTED the message. THEY REJECTED THE PROPHET. THERE'S NOTHING out there. So the only hope they have is you that are sitting here this morning. It's you that have received this message. When somebody's crying out, DON'T LET THE CRY GO OUT. JUST SAY SOMETHING AND SAY, "OH, I KNOW A GOD who can save. I know a God who can heal. I know somebody THAT I CAN TAKE YOU TO. I know if I pray, I know he's given me the ministry of reconciliation. I know he's CALLED ME SO WHEN I SPEAK, HE CAN hear me. I KNOW I CAN COME, I CAN bring you, you can hear about THIS GOD AND WE CAN PRAY for you and see what he can do. If the doctors CAN'T HELP YOU, I know somebody who can help you. &gt;&gt; Don't Don't keep IT FOR YOURSELF. SHARE IT with somebody. &gt;&gt; The world is dying. So, oh my, if I don't get to finish, the Lord will have his way. Just allow me to just take my time. I don't want to go too fast and I don't want to go too slow. Just want to take my time and and you know, the world is eternal and the Lord will just fill up the rest. So the God the it's the understanding that God's nature is the continuation of the expression of revealing himself and it's not done. He's continually revealing and everywhere every form every form that he find himself it's his expression continuing. You see a tree, a tree will grow up and and it will produce folk the seed and the seed will fall into the ground and another tree will rise up. Job said, "I saw God in nature. I I was uh I've always wondered you know but when talks about the message the path of life and what's one of my favorite and he says how that God is the tree and we are the fruits hanging off of it and and you're like well I see a leaf fall and then it dies and I said well the leaf doesn't you know it actually falls so how is the process continue because the tree falls on the ground and then everything but but And if you go listen, what you'll understand is the the the the the leaf, it's not the leaf, the life when winter comes, the life is pulled out of the leaf. Are you with me this morning? It's the life when winter comes, the same life is pulled out of the leaf to go back into the root for the saving of the tree. The leaf fall and the leaf represent the flesh. But the life is not gone. When when the time for springtime comes, it's the same expression. It's not a different life. It's the same expression that comes back. That's why my brother, my sister, in the resurrection, it's not going to be a different you. If you went by the way of the grave or whatever, it's going to be THE SAME EXACT YOU sitting this morning. It'll be a different flesh because this this flesh is here. It's it's the down it's it's the the the the ground and it's going to go back to the ground. But the expression remains the same. It says resurrection is not replacement. IT'S NOT REPLACEMENT. IT'S THE SAME LIFE. IT'S THE SAME CHRIST WHO WENT INTO the ground is him that resurrected. &gt;&gt; And it's the same. That's why one of the things I I I one of my things I get especially on the young people is because I don't understand how they can see and and see that that God was in Christ. They can see the life of God in CHRIST BUT WHEN IT COMES to themselves they take that same life and they belittle it. All of the sudden when it's in Christ it can do all things. when he comes in you, he can't do anything. &gt;&gt; What a confusion. You know, and because remember what I'm says that what what God did in Christ, Christ does in you. Well, get there. What God did in Christ, Christ does in you. HE SAYS ALL THAT WAS INTO GOD, he poured into Christ. And all that was into Christ, he poured it into the church. So if IT'S THE SAME LIFE, IT'LL produce the same fruit. And I'm not saying that for you to look at yourself and say, "How come I'm not producing?" I mean, I'm saying that so YOU CAN KNOW THE FULLNESS IS THERE TO TAP INTO IT. &gt;&gt; It the fullness IS THERE FOR YOU TO WALK into it. and and and and you know the prophet will even talk how you know the the planter will go and plant and some will bring uh 40 and some will bring 50 and some will bring 60 and some will bring a 100fold my brother my sister if you bring in 6040 God that's not the END OF YOU GOD WANTS you to be at your full potential but when I'M SAYS THAT GOD DOESN'T MAKE halfway believers &gt;&gt; but the believer can be halfway the The reason we are halfway is because we don't go into the storehouse. We don't go into it to take all the fullness that's been made available to us because it's THE MORE WE DIE to ourselves. That's when we receive the more of God. It's the dying to the self. It's the DENYING OF THIS FLESH. IT'S THE COMING LIKE WE WERE talking about yesterday. It's the constant reminding OF YOURSELF THAT I'M NOT THIS FLESH. &gt;&gt; I can't SAY THAT ENOUGH. I'M NOT this flesh. This flesh you were first created in the nature and in THE IMAGE OF GOD. AND THAT IMAGE IS THE SPIRIT MAN. But the spirit man cannot express himself in the air. The spirit MAN NEEDS A FLESH by which the expression will come from. So you've been going to BATTLE FOR ALL YOUR life to bring out that expression. And let me say this, don't give up. NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, DO NOT GIVE UP. &gt;&gt; YOU CONTINUE TO BATTLE EVERY DAY. LET ME SAY THIS. If you fail, if your your flesh shames you, if your FLESH BRINGS REPROACH, DON'T STOP THERE. YOU CONTINUE. ONE DAY, GOD WILL BRING THAT FULL EXPRESSION OUT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about the woman at the well. She seen the body. Think about it. She couldn't even come to the well when everybody else came. &gt;&gt; She was known as a reproach into the town. Nobody would want to be associated with her. But one day, the time for the expression came. You know what the prophet said? Even though she was in that condition, she had a representation out there. Aren't you glad you have a representation, my brother, my sister? If it wasn't for the representation, we would all be lost this morning. But we thank God that there's an expression and a representation out there. So she came and she met a man, a different kind of man. And he talked to him and said, "Give me some water." And said, "Well, you know, how can you and asked me for water?" And he said, "You know, we know that the Samaritan and the Jews, they have nothing in common. How why would you ask me to drink?" where said, "Well, if you have if you know what I can offer this morning, I'll give you the water that never runs dry and I will just babble in your heart." And she looked at him and said, "You don't even have anything to draw with." Now, I want you to realize now until that time, but says Jesus was contacting a spirit. Here is Jesus speaking about spiritual things and where where she was sitting, she's taking everything and making it all natural. in church the word being preached and all it is is just adding and subtracting you know all of our lives all we do am I able am I capable is this for me is this not FOR ME THAT'S ALL she was doing JUST ALL THE WORD THE WORD TRYING TO CONTACT HER spirit and she's over there just plainly blank of what was happening it wasn't until and and I want to say this God knew exactly what she had need and he knew exactly how to get to her. And he does the same for every one of his children. He knows I don't care how you ready you find yourself and how quiet you are, how loud you are, how emotional, non-emotional, for whatever characteristics you have. God knows how to get to you. You don't have to be something that you're not in order for God to go. He knows. He's built you. He let you be in that flesh and he knows exactly what it takes. But has a quote. I don't have it with me. IT SAID THAT GOD KNOWS MEN. WE THINK WE KNOW MAN, BUT GOD knows man. He knows exactly how to get to you. &gt;&gt; So the little seed falling from the ground, it doesn't matter if he laid but say every form of life you he would take and it says you take a blade of grass and you put it under a concrete. It says it will find its way out. If it has to crack the concrete, it has to push its way out to the sidewalk. Why? Because there's a life. And wherever there's a life, there's always an expression. And and and and guess what we do? We take our nature. We post it for the reason why we can't express. Let me tell you if the life of Christ is in you that expression will come forth. Why? Because let me say this. It's the reason for that is because in every time the supernatural expresses itself, the supernatural is made to have dominion over the natural. &gt;&gt; The supernatural from the beginning. THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU go read even from from uh uh the beginning you read about the first Adam you read about the second Adam and even when you read we take it all the way to the manifested son in the end time you see the expression in the prophet but said that one of the things you realize is it was always the ability to take control of nature and I'm not just talking about nature out there even this very nature that you have why because when TIME FOR EXPRESSION COMES THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP IT. &gt;&gt; You don't have TO WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHY BUT WHEN SAYS, "OH, I'm just jumping. I'm sorry." He says, "WE WE WE STUDY TOO MUCH. WE DO TOO MUCH." HE SAYS, "IF YOU JUST FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM, MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, WHEN PETER came on the day of Pentecost, he didn't SEND THERE SAY STOP DRINKING AND STOP SMOKING AND STOP." I TELL YOU THAT LIST, YOU CAN NEVER FILL ALL OF IT. BUT ONE THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY SPIRIT, HE'LL TELL YOU WHAT TO DO. &gt;&gt; HE'LL SHOW YOU THE WAY. HE WILL GUIDE YOU AND HE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU FROM BEGINNING till the end. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry about that. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I do this wrong. I do." But sister, do not pay attention to the wrong that you do. Pay attention to the life of Christ this morning and let that life dwell in you. It will take care of all of those wrongs. So when we'll need help, so if it's time, somebody just wave me. I'm sorry. Yeah, just wave me so I know. I I feel like I'm just So when you talk about the three-fold purposes, one of the things you realize is these are connected purpose. These are not three distinct purpose. The barbam says it was for a purpose of revealing himself. And then the second purpose was for the purpose of having uh uh uh dominion or for him to be the headship. And then the the third purpose was of the purpose of restoration. But those are not three different because how can you have headship over somebody you don't know? The the purpose of expression was so that we can look and see that this is our bridegroom. The purpose was so in the revealing himself that the fellowship will be created so we can give him the proper place into our lives. And then when we give him the proper place he leads to the restoration of what was in the beginning. So it's not three what uh three distinct purposes where we go around and say oh God I just want you to reveal himself but to reveal himself for what what is the purpose of this man? Why did God open your eyes? It's not so we can sit and just say thank God you open. No he's doing that so you can understand that. But what I'm says that Christ is the center of the entire Bible. the center, the Old Testament. He's the fulfillment of all the prophecy of the Old Testament that was given. And when he comes and now in the New Testament, he it's not just Christ himself. Now he takes himself, he divides himself in the people and they become a continuation of what he was. That's why he says the book of Acts, it says THAT'S WHY IT'S CHRIST in it's not the act of of of the people, but it's the act of the Holy Spirit. It's the act of God himself dwelling in his people. And I want to say this, GOD WAS NOT HAPPY with the church where he would come. He's the beginning of the church. He's the one who started the first church. And and in the church, God didn't want to be Jesus didn't want to stand there because it did happen where the disciples will go and they'll do great miracles and he'll send them out. They'll go and come back. Oh, the devils were subject to as they say, well, you know, he says, rejoice not because the devil are subject to you, but rejoice because your name is written in the book. And but then there will go certain times and they will go and cast demons and they couldn't. And they'll come and say, "Master, we tried, we couldn't for some reason." He said, "Oh, you know, he says this one, there are some that you have to to to be in a certain condition in order for you to take care of her." So for and then there will be a woman come and they'll try to stop him and the master will say, "No, just let him come in." So they knew they were in such comfort that they knew that if we needed anything the master was just there to take care of it. Now I I I just want to say this not perhaps just as a somber thought. Imagine the prophet still being in town. I he couldn't live in the town big enough. But that's not the model of the church Jesus was looking for. He looked at them. He set them down and says, "It's expedient that I go." Now, I MEAN, THEY WERE PROBABLY LOOKING AND SAY, "THIS IS THE BEST CHURCH EVER. THIS IS THE BEST SERVICE EVER. WE KNOW IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM, the pastor is there. He's there to just take care of everything. All our needs, we just bring over to him." HE SAYS, "NO, THAT'S NOT what I'm looking for. The church that I'm looking for is for ME TO COME BACK IN THE FORM OF THE SPIRIT AND FOR ME TO DWELL IN EACH AND EVERY ONE of you." WHERE YOU BECOME A UNIT THAT ACTUALLY FUNCTION &gt;&gt; NOT LOOKING AT ONE BUT AS A PEOPLE each one playing its role in coming together that you may do greater works &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE CHURCH THAT JESUS HE SAYS ON THE DAY of Pentecost and I want to say this Christ in you that's why and yeah they are after they receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but says one place it says the man that was sitting at the gate. Beautiful. No doubt Jesus passed there time and time again. And every time your pastor says, "My boys are going to take care of you one day. &gt;&gt; Not today. Today is not the time. &gt;&gt; Just stay there a little longer." He will come and pass by the gate beautiful and say, "I know. I have just a vision of what exactly is going to happen." What did the Holy Spirit do? He brought them into the consciousness that they were already gods. &gt;&gt; That the works that I do, ye shall do also. When the Holy Spirit comes into the life of a believer, you no longer are your flesh and worry about the things of the flesh. Your focus is into Christ and you know that Christ in you, that same spirit in him will produce the same work. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said that father he went when he in John 14 and I'm just summarizing everything right now. In John 14, he prays and it says, "Father, I'm going to go to the cross and I'm going to give my life. But what I pray for is that the love, the the the union and the fellowship that I have with you that they may receive it also." Christ didn't pray for you to come under him. He prayed so that the same access, the same life, the same everything that he had, YOU COULD HAVE. THAT'S WHY WE READ THE SCRIPTURE. It says is a core air. We He didn't take YOU AND PUT YOU UNDER. HE MAKE YOU HE MADE YOU ONE WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; But we keep putting ourselves under. We keep choosing a different position than what he gave us. Let me say this. God loves for people to take him at his word and to approach him with the the identity that he has given you for the time. We're not building boats this time. We are not crossing the Jordan this time. We are not crossing the Red Sea this time. In this same time, he said, "I called you bride. And the boldness that I was talking about yesterday is to understand that I have been called to come. Now, I'm not saying that all of the sudden you feel deserving. No, perhaps for the rest of our lives, we'll feel undeserving all the time. But nevertheless, that's the position he's given us. We approach him with grace with the understanding that even though I'm undeserving but you still called me to do this. &gt;&gt; So it shows God was showing his original intention that his life was that he would uh that his life would one day live in the human flesh again. His original desire from the beginning has always to have fellowship not religion. No, that is not I I I preach back home a message. God is not interested in religion. He's interested in fellowship. Religion is when you come and you conform to a book. You you you hear what they said. Oh, you got to stop smoking. You got to stop drinking. You train your flesh into doing that. And I'll say this, perhaps you may be successful. There are good people out there that don't got the Holy Ghost, that don't smoke, that don't drink, &gt;&gt; but that's not enough. He says your righteousness is filthy rag. So, it's not about that. God desires fellowship. He created you for fellowship. So, it's not in trying to conform with the letter and say the letter does that. In fact, God, he said, but he we his promise in the scripture was that I will take away the stony heart. I will take away your heart. I will give you a heart of flesh. I'll give you a new spirit. I will put my spirit into your spirit and I will cause you to obey my commandment. Oh my, that's grace right there. You know why it's grace? Because some of us know WE WERE NOT DISCIPLINED ENOUGH TO STOP WITH our own self. WE KNOW IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM, WE WOULD HAVE FAILED. &gt;&gt; We know it. AND WE KNOW EVEN UNTIL NOW, IF HE JUST LETS US GO ONE MOMENT, WE'RE GOING TO BE A FAILURE. We need him every hour of the day. &gt;&gt; And every step of the way, we are reminded, Lord, if you don't do, I'm done. If you stop, I'm stopping. It's like Moses, he says, Lord, if you don't go before us, we won't go. Show us your glory. And his glory, he says that so where I am that ye may be also. And that place is positioning. He was at the place where Jesus was one that understood his position and what he came to do. So what the Holy Spirit does in you when you receive the Holy Spirit, it trains you so you can get into position and know who you are. So no not not coming into rituals and commandment and but it's a communion between the creator and his creation. But I want to say one place that the bridegroom created his own bride. I love that the bridegroom created his own bride in the beginning of creation. I love how the prophet said you will see that the description of the earth was without form and void. It says, "And then God said, let her be." And then he says, "The voice or the word that went forth took what was out of form and chaotic and all of that." He says, "Perhaps the clinker will fall for thousands and thousands and billions of years or whatever it will fall." He says, "What was he doing? He was creating you." And we put it into our mind as a creation being such a peaceful thing. No, there was thunders, there was earthquakes, there was shaking and things being brought out of foam. And my brother, my sister, your expression is no different. We see we want to have this where we say, "Oh, God, I want this." And then it happens. NO, GOD WANTS THAT BATTLE, that that raggedness. And I continue to say this because that's what life is all about. It's not a peaceful. It's bringing under subjection. &gt;&gt; It's holding forth and say, "I will not let go." &gt;&gt; It It's not a peaceful something where it just happened. No, it's you going on your knees and saying, "Lord, you give me life or I'll die." &gt;&gt; It's the dying. BUT PAUL SAYS, IT SAYS, "I I DIE DAILY. I I RING EVERY DAY. I STAND UP AND I DIE AND I DIE SO THAT CHRIST MAY BE GLORIFIED. &gt;&gt; Let me say death is not an easy thing. You got to look that man. How many times have you done something and you look at yourself, you just about to punch yourself in the face? I can't believe I did that. But what? IT'S THE DYING. YOU don't like what you see anymore. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BECAUSE the the SPIRIT IS NOW CALLING OUT FOR THE REAL EXPRESSION to come out. The spirit is LOOKING AND SAYING, "YOU'RE NOT doing what I want to do. EVERY TIME I WANT TO DO SOMETHING, YOU COME ALONG MY WAY AND YOU UNDERCUT ME. EVERY TIME I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING RIGHT, YOU PUT THE WRONG WORDS IN MY MOUTH. EVERY TIME I WANT TO SHOW LOVE, YOU SHOW HATRED AND EVERYTHING. YOU GO TO BATTLE WITH THAT PERSON, WITH YOURSELF." THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID, "YOU HAVE TO DOUBT YOUR OWN DOUBT. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT MAN AND KICK HIM out &gt;&gt; in order for the expression to come forth. When Jacob battled with an angel, the scripture says he touched the hollow of the tide and he came up limping. That's what happens when you fight with God. This flesh becomes so weak and you look there's no beauty to be desired of the flesh. That's the flesh that the expression will start to come out from. It's not when the flesh is strong and all well. No, it's when the flesh can stand there and say, "I can't do anything except the spirit come upon me. I won't speak unless he speaks for me." He says that's what the bride is in the end time. He says he says the brother the the bride says she won't say anything unless he says she's she speaks what he speaks. She's quiet when he doesn't speak. She doesn't have a mind of her own. She has the mind of Christ dwelling in her. So the same life that was in Christ flow through the believers. The complete cycle of redemption God manifested in flesh again. This time is not in one flesh and in many many members flesh but for the purpose of manifesting the same life. Why? Because we have an example. The she wave offering is that in the end time that we may know that once again the fullness will be manifested in the mankind. What was it? Vabanam is to us that she wave offering. Vabanam says what resurrection that was the first resurrection. What resurrection this is? What is it? It was Christ. Now it was uniting time and to that was the sign to us that this is the uniting time. What is it? God wanted to dwell in human being again. He will stand there and said, "Oh, I love some of the things he said." He says, "What if Jesus was standing here with this suit here?" And people will say, "Oh, are you saying that Venom was God?" No, he wasn't. He was a yielded vessel. And you know what? So are you. Your body is the temple of these hands were made to worship God. Your feet were made to go do good things, not bad things. Not to run after the things of the world, to run. Your body, this body here was made for you to speak the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. The heart that he given you is for you to love others, not to hate. &gt;&gt; He He came and he stood there. He was the she offering. He came and he created the squirrel. He shows us that God will provide for your need. Not that we need to go and create scrolls, but we know that when we have need of something, God will provide in that time. That we can speak the word and say, "Father, I have need of this and it's going to come to pass." Why? It was the same life. Now, you could say that was a prophet, but remember the prophet, you can't separate the prophet, the messenger, the messenger as it's been told to us. Why? because he can't just speak it and not show us what that is because his own life will also reflect what is it that he's preaching. But one says I believe in the rising of the sun or somewhere says you cannot be something that you don't know or you can only be what you are pointing to. We have to know what is it that we are pointing to and we are pointing to the Lord Jesus Christ. In fact, let me read this. Let me just uh skip you and read for the sake of time. He says this. He says in the message deity of Jesus Christ and I love this. He says and the same power the same Christ hallelujah the fundamentalist let them let them let let them people who deny the power of God say it's wrong. But the same power that spoke the world into existence in those people. It is in those people that's got the Holy Ghost. Same power. And it says, "That's right, men and women. It's time that we found out who we are." The devil is trying to hide you back and tell you that you are some uh little downtrodden something. You are not. You are sons and daughters of God. This isn't a message deity. Paragraph 80. He says, "Deity is not in heaven. It's in you." &gt;&gt; Oh my. I hope we caught that. Let me even continue on. It says, "I know." It says, "I know you think I'm crazy." But let me tell you something, brother. When you re, excuse me, when you realize the almighty God lives in you, immortal life, Zoe, I give you Zoey life, the life of God in a human being. It says, "And brother and sister, deities it is in you." the it says in a little while the world will see me no more yet you shall see me I'll be with you and even in you till the end of time now listen to this this is the part that I really want you so he says God is in you and now it says Christ in the manger no Christ in you hallelujah listen to this we are worshiping Christ we are not worshiping Christ in the manger but we are worshiping Christ in you says the Holy Ghost uh the hope of life, the creator, God himself dwelling in the human being. So when you actually worshiping, you're not worshiping some creature in heaven. You are worshiping that is that which dwells in you. &gt;&gt; This is the message of the hour. And that's why I started off with identity. My brother and my sister, we have received so much of the word that it's so important that we ask to put it in perspective. Otherwise, we we tend to take the message and dilute it back into the denomination where we keep putting Christ back in heaven, Christ back in the cross, Christ back here. The only place where he wants to be, we are not taking him there. In fact, we even come to service, we see Christ in the preacher. We see Christ in the person sitting next to you. And the only place you don't see him is Christ in you. What good is that for? I'm not here to give you some teaching or something you never heard. I'm here to emphasize who God has already made you to be. I'm just telling you. And you say, "How much do we need to hear it?" KEEP HEARING IT UNTIL YOU BELIEVE IT. Keep keep hearing IT UNTIL SOMETHING IN YOU GETS QUICKENED AND LIFE BEGIN TO MANIFEST. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE LAW OF identification says that if you tell a child something that one day they will become CALL YOUR SON A LIAR EVERY DAY DON'T be surprised one day if he lies. You're a liar. You're a liar. You're a liar. Well guess what? One day identification is going to happen. and they're going to come and they said, "Didn't you say I was a liar?" But I'm trying to say, the point I'm trying to make is it's not that we are becoming something we were not. He's just keep emphasizing so we can come into the realization of the work that's been made. Barbanam says it says if Jesus was here today he couldn't do one more thing except what he already promised to do. He talked about the artisian well. He said you can cry out and say oh water come up this way. Water is not made to go upstream. Water is made to come downstream. And what is that is that God will only do what he promised he will do. So as we said make for the expression God made in flesh and and and and and that because by deity nature dominion and expression has to come forth and so that's why we have to be to understand that that that our flesh and and and and you look around and everything you you realize what the Lord is doing from your your saving or even this morning if you are not saved and you haven't received the Holy Spirit but what God is trying to do is to bring you into the knowledge of himself and once you are saved what he's trying to do is to bring you into the expression of that which you already existed in that's why I called it it's the journey of self-discovery so it's not us discovering something that we were not but yet is that which is inside of us coming to the surface so we may know and understand that God was is in us and is becoming an expression that can be seen everywhere. So because remember he says the least of the desire that you have in your heart the least of the desire if you say if this morning you say oh I want to serve God that alone is enough to overcome every darkness that's a quote the least he didn't say the biggest the least of your desire to just say Lord I want to serve you with all my life. Say it in sincerity. That alone is enough power to overcome every devil and every darkness in your life. So that's why we don't we don't want to be a people that live under our privileges, but we want to come into the the the place where we we use that which has been given to us so we can overcome the darkness that we find ourselves. So Christ died. He didn't die to pay a partial payments and and pay and say, "Well, I'll pay this, but this you got to do on your own." No. The penalty of sin as far as the world is concerned, the scripture will say that Christ died for the sins of the whole world. So if anybody on the planet earth today will say that I want to serve Christ, they have the capability to do that. But what they lacking is the nature and the desire within them to seek Christ. That's why Brandham says only the elect will receive it. Because why? They were predestinated to receive it. And how do you know you are predestinated? If there's something in you that cries out for God, &gt;&gt; that means he's made you to receive it. And and I want to say this, you couldn't wake up in the morning 8:00 a.m. and and get right ready and do all of that you need to do to be here in church just so you can be. I believe with all my heart you here because there's something in you to receive him. It says look Christ in you makes you the center. Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. See, Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation. Christ in the bride makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you, not him, makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing. I can't wait till that day. You know, we sing that way that song, here comes the bride. I I tell you, all the ages, the bride of all the ages will line up and and they'll be walking and Christ will look and say, "This is what my blood is able to do. This is what I paid for. This is what I I I tell you, the bride is a special class of people. Will there be people saved?" Yeah, there will be people around the city as the prophet told us. But the only the elected of every generation are those that have been specially chosen for this. And I want to say this, I'm just thankful to be chosen. I I know I don't have any ability in me whatsoever. And often time, you know what what believers do is they take preachers and they elevate them. And there's nothing wrong with that in some senses. But let me say this. I still have to overcome in life just like you do. I still have to make wrong decisions and correct them and do all of that. I was sharing with the brothers and I remember just being a young Christian and and I went and and and I got a job. I I was looking for a job really desperate and I I got this job and they told me that I would work on Wednesdays. Well, you know, in my mind I'm like, well, I still come to church on w on on Sundays, so that should be fine. And then you know and then I knew that they told me that well uh you go to a probation period and after that you you you become full-time but but then after that you can switch. So I said okay I will I will do that. Then I took the job and and everything and and I took the job and I continue. So when the probation time came my desire was always to go back. So I went to my supervisor and said hey I want to go back and and everything. So they put my name on the waiting list and everything and all of the sudden the position opened. So I went and I took the position. I went. So I take the position. A day or two later my supervisor comes back and say, "Well, guess what? I need you back on the other shift." I said, "Oh no." And I said, "Well," and then in my heart I'm like, "Well, I already this is what my was my heart desire. What's going on?" And I like, "No, I can't take it." He's like, "Okay, I'll make you a proposition." He he came to where he offered almost close to double what I was making for me to take back the position that I had before. My my my you talk about cars breaking and and things going wrong and all of you all of the sudden realizing that you need money. I mean, you know, you want to do this and then in your ears you hear if you if you get that job, you could get money to do this. And you know, if you get that job, you'll get money to do that. And and all of the sudden and I and I went and I prayed about it and everything. And so and I said, "Okay, give me some time." And he gave me time and I said, and I called him. I said, "Can I talk to you?" I said, he said, "Yes." So I came and I walked in his office. He's like, "Okay, so are we ready to go?" I said, "Okay, here's what we'll do." So, we work from Monday through Friday, I believe, or Thursday. I don't remember. I said, "Okay, I'll come in Monday. I would come in early and I'll work till your shift and everything and I'll do that on Tuesday. I'll do that Thursday. I'll do that Friday. And what I want you to do is to get somebody else for that position and I will train them however long it takes until you feel comfortable that they can do the job." And then he looked at me and said, and I said, "But you know what? You don't have to pay me that extra money. Now, you talk about silence. You talk about awkwardness. He looked at me and he thought I was crazy. And you know what? I was. &gt;&gt; It's just I was crazy for Christ. &gt;&gt; I was crazy for him. Was I a preacher? No. This is a believer. It's just I wanted to be in church. I wanted to be there for Christ. I I made a mistake, but I I needed a way to figure out a way to correct it. And I asked God, I said, "If I get the opportunity, I will do it." And and I got the opportunity, right? When I get the opportunity, the devil was right there to bring me right back in. And I took And did things go wrong? Oh yes. Oh yes. I mean, you talk about the the battle. I mean, you woke up and every if you didn't get that money, you wouldn't have to worry about breakfast. If you got that money, you wouldn't have to worry about gas money. If you worry about money, you wouldn't have to worry about going out to eat. Now, everybody's going out to eat you here. And and and I constantly and I said, "You know what? It's already done." And that's all of it. Not even long after they opened a new position that never existed in the first shift that I was in. And that's the job I've had for over 20s something years. And I'm just saying it. I don't know who need it. I'm just here to speak and encourage somebody. You take God at his word, God will come through. &gt;&gt; You put him first. I don't care. He told that uh that that woman of serap he said he didn't say that the curse will grow, the oil will fill and the flower will fill. No, he said every time you reach in to get it, it will still be there. That's the kind of God we serve. I tell you, he's not going to take just care of your supernatural. He has to take care of the natural, both the spiritual. He's a provider. Let me say this. the earth that you see the grain grows by the word of God. &gt;&gt; You You remember there's times in Israel where it says it's not going to rain. He He can cause the grain not to come out. You can plant and nothing comes out. He still has control over even the natural. Even though men shall not live by bread alone, it's both the natural and the spiritual. &gt;&gt; It's by his word. So, if I can encourage you this morning, take God at his word. Don't never give up. If you really want to know who God is, he's looking for people that can stand there. Endurance is what's needed in this age that we are living in. This is not the age of babes. This is the age of maturity where we stand in the presence of the sun until all the greens is baked out of us. He says, "What's the new birth?" And I love this. You would say, "Well, brother Brennan, what is the new birth?" It says, "It's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you. Christ making himself known to you." And let me say this, that expression is tailor made to be individual. You can't compare it with any other expression. It produces the same Christ, but it's different. &gt;&gt; You can't look at an experience and say, "Oh, you know, this one was in the world. It did this and this. I need to go in the world so I can get the same experience." No. Whatever your upbringing is, whatever experience you've gone through, but Ranam says it's those deserts of experiences where righteousness, righteous men are molded into saints. In other words, he's making you a tailormade Christian in his own image. Not in the image of the pastor, not in the mean of any other minister, not in the image of of your parents. You are your own unique image that he can look and say, "That's me." And you know what? When that expression comes out, no matter who it is, you look at it, you say, "That's Christ manifested in many members body." It says, "But God's great mystery, what the eternal God had, he had a mystery that has been unfolding in Christ, then began right down to his church." What was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; There are no mystery left. You are the unfolding of the mystery in the end time. Jesus making love to the church, his bride, whispering secret to her. It's personal. is not remember in Laudian church ages Christ find himself outside of his own church outside of think about it he started the church but it got so bad towards all the way to the end by the time you get to the end he the creator he the beginner of the church he's actually at the outside but that's why says in the end time he's not knocking at the church as the building as the people as a group He's knocking at each and every individual door so he can come and s with you and you with him. Individual relationship with each one of us so we can know him. It's Christ. He was made the fulfillment of the prophecy that was concerning him in the Old Testament. He's here to express himself in the end time. And you get that's why it's important we come here. We say I'm not here to express darkness. Oh, no. I'm not here to express whatever the world is doing. I'm not here to be caught up in what the world is and everything. I'm here to express Christ in this dying generation. That's my mission. That's my life. And you have to believe that you and and I don't care like I said whether you make a mistake. You have to say I have been predestinated by God to shine light in this dying generation. Do I do it at every second and every moment? No. Sometimes you know you know we're talking you know they say misery love company. Somebody may be talking negative and it's easy with the flesh to just jump in in there and contribute. But that's the thing you got to look out for. You have to it can get negative, but you have to remind yourself that negativity and all of those and darkness will continue. I'm here to at least for the time that I'm here to shine light on this dying generation. But Ram says in the message, how can I overcome? He says it's just like the little uh uh given an example. He says that like the lily I think one that's one of the most prettiest flower. It's I'm very fond of those great color lily and the pond lily. And I think there's nothing as hardly as pretty as this great pond lily. Now I want to ask you what is it that makes the lily the most beautiful flower? He's going to tell us just a moment. He says, uh, and I think there's nothing as hardly as pretty as the pond lily. You call it water lily. It's radiant. Now, where does it come from? It says, now he's expressing the lily is the little seed down in the bottom of the muddy muck pond. that little seed yet all the radiance that it's ever had in it and is right in there when it's in the muck. But it has to strive daily knowing that there is something out there knowing it's black, it's dirty, it's mucky, it's limey, it's lime that it's living in. Yes, it presses its way through the mud, the muck, and the water and the stagnant places until it sticks his head above the light. That Let me say this. That's the description of your life this morning. That's the description of my life. We have to stick our hands up in the market. You know why we do that? The sun is calling. You know why the sun is calling and said, "Come, there's light on the other side." HE SAID, "YEAH, BUT I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING." IT SAYS, "KEEP pressing on, son. Keep pressing on. KEEP PRESS." OH, I DON'T SEE PROGRESS. YOU DON'T MEASURE YOUR PROGRESS BY YOUR OWN SELF. YOU JUST TAKE THE WORD AND CONTINUE TO PRESS ON AND PRESS ON. ONE DAY, YOU'LL COME OUT TO THE LIGHT. &gt;&gt; There's got to be a fight in you. &gt;&gt; You got to be like that. But whenam says it's not the size of the dog but it's the size of the fight in the dog. You know I'm a very you know you know lay down and but I have a lot of Christian fight in me. I I just I just love God. I was telling brother Jonathan I can talk about God from sunrise to sunset. There's just something in the hearts of the believer that rejoices to hear more about him. You can never hear enough about him. What is that? There's got to be a fight. He created you with a fight in you. Until he sticks his head up in the light, it says expressing what was hidden in her all the time. Journey of selfdiscovery, he said. And I think and let me just skip for the sake of time. It says God by predestination. See, he brought his seed. He brought he this seed of life and expressing itself. See, coming to the light. And now on top of all of that, it's an o it's an overcomer. It doesn't express itself down there. &gt;&gt; The expression is not down there. when you in says I'll read it when you were in the world you were not expressing Christ you expressing whatever the flesh wanted to you did whatever it says when you were uh uh uh you that were once in sin and trespasses you walk according to your the the the lust of the flesh and the lust of the world and all of those things you did all of that but within you there was the ability of expressing God and you didn't even know it some people had to call it out of you. Somebody even had to tell you, but somehow somewhere in due season when your time came, God came knocking at your door. It said, "Now it's your time. I want to s with you." Now, this expression is not going to come by your might and your power. It's going to come by his spirit working in you. And what one of them spoke in the masterpiece and if I could just what Jonathan here just if you could come I hope I don't embarrass you. Yeah just come for a second here. I hope this is okay. I hope I'm not embarrassing you. You're good right? Oh you look sharp. You look good. You look very great. I think about when talks about Michelangelo, the great sculptor, and he said that he had a vision of what the statue of Moses had to look like. And this stone or the rock or the marble that he used and I had a chance to see it. I was in California. I went to that cemetery place. I forgot what they call it. And I had a chance to to see this one replica. I don't know if it original or replica there that I was able to see. And the stone or the marble was predestinated. Are you with me this morning? I'm just hoping I go really slow so even the young kids can get it because I feel like sometimes we're pissed to the older, we leave the younger ones. So this is for you. And it didn't matter how much I told the stone about its predestination. It has no ability within itself to produce it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The word is not preached to your flesh. &gt;&gt; The word is preached to the soul because when the soul gets it, the flesh will will will come under the subjection. Don't forget that. So he he he had the vision and I love it because the prophet even doesn't say I don't even think he wrote it on paper and everything he had the vision and and if you know what an artist is artist is they are very obsessed people just want you very obsessed with details and the only way for that marble to bring out that image it was for it to submit itself to the author, the one who had the vision. So he can take the vision from his mind and bring out the expression out of the model. Butam says Moses Moses the parents told him he was called. He grew up all his life knowing that he was called to be the deliverer. But when he went in his own might, he failed. He had to meet the one who made the promise and called him to be the deliverer. Only then he could bring it to come to pass. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? So when we come to church and hear the word of God, we got to come in contact with Jesus Christ himself. The word will produce what he said. But there has to be a contact with that God of the promise and say, "I heard of your promise. I'm here so you can bring the promise out of me." &gt;&gt; The mistake we made is we take the promise and we go do our own molding. You know, we look at our imagine how strange that is. and you take the hammer and the chisel and you go, you know, you're making a monster. You may make something that look identical, but there's no life in it. There's no imprint of the master on it. There's no masterership. The scripture says that we are his workmanship. So the requirement what says he says the bride cannot even stand still long enough. We run over here. We run over there. I like this. I like that. Oh no. I'm not this anymore. I'm that. No. What he wants is for you to stand still and let him take the chisel and the hammer and begin to do the work. Now some of the pieces may be hard to take off. You know, when you get to the fingers and the details that has to go in the work, it's not the same as chipping the blocks that are on the side. When you come to the details of what that's supposed to be, it's not as easy as the others. But the trust is in that he has the image, but when I'm says the whole creation is like one piece of the the clay is just like one piece of a fabric. the God cut off the predestinated uh fabric. He decides which part of the fabric is predestinated. We don't we just take him as he says, but we have to stand still and let him do the molding. It may hurt. Sometimes we may be joyful about it but if we stand still when all is said and done we will come into the real image but calls it the living image of the living God. &gt;&gt; Thank you. The living image of the living God. Not a performance. Not what I can show forth. No, I I keep saying this true new birth gives you humility because you know you are undeserving. You know you are incapable. However long you walk with him, you still know that I'm not deserving of this. It says, it says, God by predestination saw and brought the seed to life and says coming to the light. And now on top of all of that, it has overcome. It has overcome. Has overcome. It says It it it doesn't it it says it doesn't have itself. It doesn't express itself down there. It gets up here and then express itself. Neither did you when you were in sin and adultery and everything that you lived in. You didn't express nothing. Oh my good. I mean in fact you thought you were it. I mean you know it's like being a teenager. You think you know everything. I mean it's like you think you know you all of the sudden your parents becomes dumb. and they don't know anything. All of the sudden you feel like I've acquired so much knowledge and I feel like we have to go through that journey so God can humble us somehow. And then you get old and then and then every day you walk and say, "Oh Lord, I have no nothing. Oh Lord, I know nothing." Because you realize the more you know, the less you don't know. The more you know, the more you realize, the more there is to know. And you realize the only thing to know really is to know that it's him that does all things. But there's a seed in there and you got a chance to express itself to light. And now you are pressing, you are in the presence of Jesus Christ, the sunlight. And it brought you out. It brought it brought out what you really was in the beginning. See what I mean? You saw the light. You bloomed out. You laid out your heart open. And now you are a lily. You saw the light. You bloomed out. You laid your heart open. And now you are a lily. The only way to express it is by him coming and [clears throat] making himself known making his light known unto you. He says in perfect faith, he says when we were in sin Elliot ended out of God. He says in the world in the muck and mud, he says as I talked this morning, God came to us. God sought us. You never sought God. No man can come to God except the father draws him first. God came down in the muck and you were that that uh what you were and he sought you out and brought you out to light. That ought to put perfect love into your uh perfect that that I create per uh perfect love. Look what what you was. Look what you are. What did that? He says somebody that loved you. Can't you have faith in what he's promised to you? Then really then real genuine love will create a confidence in his love in his word. Christianity is not built upon intellectual. You have to look at your life and lay it open and see what you was and see that something changed, something happened to you. to see that somebody somewhere put a different desire in you than everybody else. Somebody in you that loved you called you out. And let me say this, that's the foundation of Christian life. Anything you build, you build upon that. Because remember Peter says, "Who do men say that I am?" He says, "Well, the preacher told me you are this. The pastor told me you are this. That man said you are this." He looked at them. He says he didn't build this church upon what other people said. He says, "But who do you say that I am?" A personal identification. That's why he says the revelation up to you. The word was preached to you, but at the end it was what you heard him talk to you. Your own experience to know that God has talked to me. I'm here because I heard the voice of God. I love God. I love his word because there is something that's speaking to me. That's where you build upon. If you build upon intellect, you'll find somebody who knows more than you. You'll find somebody who knows better, who can explain better. And guess what? You will crumble your foundation and go build upon that. the only foundation that will last that he said that the gates of hell will will will that it will it will stand against the gates of hell and it's the revelation that you know within your own life that God saved me God spoke to me and if you don't know him that way he's giving you an opportunity this morning so you can hone him for yourself that you will know him for that personal experience with him you and him. He says, "He caught me when I was nothing, and I'm still nothing." But I'm in his hand. I love it. He says, "He caught me. He loved me when I was unlovable." Oh my. unlovable, rejected, left out. Nobody cared but he cared. And let me say this, don't ever look at your past as something to be frowned upon. I tell you, if you look at every single one of us, there's something in our lives that you can look and say, you know, I I don't know where that came from. I didn't choose the parents by which I would come from. You know, sometimes I talk about I remember being in college and I and I go to this interview with this professor. I'm talking about my own life and the prophet professor, he was white and he's turning red on my story. I mean, he's completely embarrassed and I'm the one telling the story. where you come, how you came to this world has no virtue at all. He chose to bring you that way so he can get the vessel that you are today. But what matters is what he wants to do with you. You can't dwell in the past. You can't drive a car every time looking at the past. Oh, I did that. I did that. The sin of the past, let me say this. It's either Jesus paid or he didn't pay for it. And if he paid for it, let's forget about it. In fact, the scripture says his mercies are new every morning. I was preaching at the church and I said, you can wake up today, you know, you have to be like I love the sport players and everything because they have such an attitude you won't understand. They will lose the game today and come up the next day. He says, "Oh, I forgot about all that happened yesterday." You're like, "You just lost a game yesterday." He's like, "Yeah." He says, "If I let what I lost yesterday, today, I won't be able to perform the way I should. I learn from my mistake, but I go forward completely. I know every day his mercies are brand new and and a new day." He's given me a brand new sheet of paper for me to express myself once again. As long as I have breath in my life, I want to take every opportunity of every day to express him. not to be caught up with what happened in the past. And let me say this, when God saves you, the past becomes just the history. I I can talk about myself as I was talking about somebody else. And people go, "Really?" I was like, "Oh, yeah. Aren't you ashamed of what?" Of the flesh, man. I mean, you haven't really seen what the flesh man can do. I guess this guy, he's no good. This guy, he's the one that you battle with. You are your own enemy. &gt;&gt; Let the light of Christ shine abroad your heart and what he has promised. I'm sorry. I feel like I'm just talking too much. Let me try to get to where I can close. It says, "I was unlovable." The love of God, it says he changed you. It says just like the color sister said that time it says it says in her testimony she said I'm not what I ought to be but I'm not what I want to be but I'm it says and I'm not what I want to be but then I'm also not what I used to be. I know I'm not what I know what I have in me as a desire today is not what I used to have. God changed me. He gave me a desire to be a Christian, to love him, to serve him. She says she know she knowed that she had she had come from somewhere. Something happened and that's the way it is. If God when I was an alien from him, he loved me and he still he stooped down to get me and picked me up. That gives me confidence that he wants to use me. But says God cannot build the house unless he wants to live in it. &gt;&gt; H how who who's one that builds a house so he can leave it empty? You build a house so you can live in it. He made you so he can live in you. He says that gives me confidence that he wants to use me. He's got a purpose. He's got a purpose uh in doing it. And he says he's seen something enemy. He seen something. He seen something in you. He had he had a reason to save you. Look at the people that are unsafe today. Look at a million that could have uh uh uh took beside you, but he took you. Amen. He says, "No one can take your place." Amen. You are in God's economy. No one can do it. That's the love of God to you. God calls you and you say, "Why don't you pick so and so? He's better. Look at him. He's better looking. He's more articulate. He can He can He has the charisma." No, no. It's you that is calling. Not your neighbor, not your mother, not your sister. It's you. Don't Don't ponder it upon somebody else. or don't don't take your Christian life and pawn it upon the preacher. No, he's called you to live. And he says no one can take your place. And let me say this, God called you to be here in New Finland in this place that you are here so you can be his expression and nobody else can do it except you that are sitting here. That's the truth. This is your responsibility of the expression of God in the area that you are living in. Everywhere he puts you, you automatically become the responsible party for the expression of God into that place. It sounds scary, right? No. But he said that the same way that God God sent Jesus, the same way Jesus sent you. And he asked the question, he says, "How did God send Jesus?" He said, "The father that sent him dwell in him." And the same God, the same way he's sending you, he's repeating the same exact process. And he that is sending you, he's dwelling in you. If I can just admonish you this morning, don't be fearful. Don't be afraid. His ever present. His pres presence is walking with you every day. He's there to walk alongside of you. Don't let the complexes of the flesh take you away from what God wants to do. He wants to use you. He wants to be for you to be a light in your community, your schools, and the places and the people that you fellowship with. He wants to see that light continue. He doesn't want that light to just come and be manifested in the church. What good would that be if we just come and shout and oh praise God and then we go out there. We are just like anybody else. Right? The Christian life is not made to be here. It's made to be lived out there. In fact, the scripture says, but Renham said that's the reason why when after the day of Pentecost, God didn't keep them together. He spread them across the world. Why? Because they had to go and the expression had to be lived in every part of the world. And he didn't want it to just be together. You know, I've met brothers that say, "Oh, you know, I wish I could get a job at the Christian place and do this and, you know, just be among brothers and every day." But that's good. But the expression is got to be lived out, too. The world has to see it on display, too. It's good to have a job in the Christian. It's wonderful. If I get one, would I take it? Yes. But that's not the end of it. He wants the expression to be lived in the dying world. He says that the works that I do, ye shall do also. Why? Because when you preach, those that believe, that's the ones that the signs and wonders are going to come for. when you hear when they hear the gospel. Now they may not be saved but when you preach or when you your life is preaching when your when your life is preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ somebody can get healed. They may not get saved but they can get healing. There's benefits. We want them to be saved. But whatever benefit they can get out of it let your life bring it about. That's how you're going to fill this building by the life lived by every single one of you. And he says he wants to mold our character. The he says this, I love it. He says your character is molded by the life that's in you. Now that's contrary to what I've always learned. You know, you know, I taught you your character is no, you know, molded in, you know, I went to school. I grew I I, in fact, I don't know if I say this, but I was born in the Congo. Um, and then I left when I was about 17, 18. I went to South Africa, went to college there, and then my uh immigrated to America. So I remember, you know, when we went to a a primary school and they the teachers were really hard on that. I grew up in the time where you get a spanking in school, you know what I mean? And and so to me, that's how you were molding characters. You know, they say we're trying to make you a better person. But the prophet is saying your character is molded by the life that's in you. So the life of Christ in you molds the character of who you're supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Well, I thought it was from outside in. No, it's from the inside out. He's here. The word of God is given to mold you by by the trials and the things that you go through. What is it? Is molding you. Now remember, we're going to a wedding supper and there's only one that knows what the requirements are for you to get there. And there's only one that knows in which shape do you need to be. And and his word when it comes forth the life that you are living in and the things that he's letting you go through, he's molding you so you can fit the characteristics of what existed. Because remember that person existed before this one comes. So this one has to be molded into the image of that. Remember it wasn't that uh that the robe that Elijah had had to be cut for the size that Elisha was. No, but it was that Elisha had to grow into the word that was already provided into the road that was already provided. I want to say this don't waste that opportunity. Barbanam talks about going to the wedding supper and and I don't want you to waste that opportunity. Barbanam says whatever you do don't miss it. Don't miss it. Don't don't let the busyiness of life the cares and the family and the things that sure we have to work. Sure we have to feed our family. Sure we have to do all of that. But don't let those things of the cares of life choke the life of Christ. No, make time for the life of Christ. Do feed the life of Christ. When you feed that life, that life will provide for both spiritual and even natural. Don't live by the provision of the devil. Live by the provision of God. Let him be the light for you. Let him be your guiding principle. Let him every decision that you made. But Baram says you always ask yourself, will Christ be okay with us? Will with will with will with will with will with will with will with will with will with will with will with will with will God be okay with us? Put him first. He says you seek first the kingdom of God and the rest will be given unto you. If that is a prophecy for everyone that puts the word first. If you put the word first, it doesn't come to pass, then God is a liar. But we know the scripture says that God is not a liar and he's not a son of man that he will change his mind. When he's already spoken, it will come to pass. He wants us to do that. I was thinking about even uh mentioned this, you know, talks about the the the wedding invitation that the scriptures in Luke 24. Now when you read it, the scripture says that when the servant went and I just want to set up the scene. I'm coming to a close and I really want you to pay attention for just a moment so I can finish it. He the these people had already received the invitation that there was a wedding and there was an event happening. says that the bride today has the material on earth to get ready. In other words, you already heard that there's a wedding supper coming. It's known. So were these people. But the scripture will go that when the servant showed up that those they begin to make excuses one to another. The scripture says that one said that he was going to get married. The other said he bought a mul of land and the other said that uh um uh that that he he he had bought five oxen that he couldn't come and everything. And I want you to hear what the prophet said in the message is your life worthy of the gospel. It says Jesus here is saying man has always tried to make excuses to not receive God's word of his invitation. and and and I want you to apply it to your own life and what you think is the reason why you cannot be the things that we just talked about yesterday and today. Some will say it's too high. Some will say it's too great that I can measure to it. whatever it is. And in in some cases, it's it's going in both directions. It's either some that are so overconfident that they have it that they don't even got it and some that they always belittle themselves at all times that they cannot attain to it. He's saying that this is men's kind always trying to make excuses for not receiving the God's word of invitation. He says, "Though it be firmly proven to them that his supper and his invitation, but man is constantly making excuses." And if you say you read St. Matthew 22, you will find out that the excuse were made also. And he's taking this the parable of the this two parable and he's putting it together. And it says another place it says, "So we see that when God gives a man an invitation to do something or to receive the invitation, he's giving him that is given him and he returns. He turns it down and there is nothing left after mercy is burned but judgment. If you step over the boundaries of mercy, then there's only one thing left and that's and that says that that's his judgment. And we found out that man has done that in all the ages. It happens most every age in the Bible. Now you can we could sit here and say well one got married, one bought an accent, one box bought a a piece of land and everything and who do you actually think had the better excuse to not be there? Right? You could say, "Well, I mean one got married. You got to give him a break." You know what I mean? Now I I I'm trying to show you how human mind works. We we weigh everything by our own level, right? Like well, you know, if this happened, then this is acceptable and but then the question is how do you pick one excuse over the other? Because when all is said and done, they all missed the benefit of what was provided. Whether the excuse fit the best or didn't fit the best, whether you felt like you were capable or incapable, whether it was your arrogance or it was your complexes. when it when it's all said and done, they missed the invitation. And some said, "I'm unworthy." But now look at what it does. Because they refused the invitation. He goes in the highways and the byways and everything. Now that and he calls all that were there. Remember now the invitation had everything that they needed to be ready. All the the master was looking for was just bodies to show up because when he called the people from the street, they didn't show up all cleaned up and dressed up. The invitation included the dressing. &gt;&gt; The invitation included the robe. The invitation included everything for you to make it. &gt;&gt; God's word has all the vitamins that you need. If you are not worthy, if you are unclean, if you've done this, whatever, the invitation has to has the power for you to sit on the table. Otherwise, it's not an invitation. You can't say, "Well, I want you to come to the party." It's not like, you know, not it's bad. You know, it's not a party where you say, "Oh, I want you to come, but I want you I want you to bring salad. I want you to come, but I want you to bring dessert. I want you to come back. No, this is a seven course meal prepared and everything is included. All he wants is you and your acknowledgement and your acceptance to the invitation. The moment you say I here I am. I'll come. He says okay from that moment on the responsibility is mine that you are seated at that table. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful thing. Now let me tell you in closing if the musician could come I'll tell you what the invitation include The invitation says, "The bride is the final voice to the final light." You're like, "That's pretty tall." Yeah, I know. I know. He's looking for badger skins. He's looking for a veil for him to hide himself behind. But says, "We in this generation, we have the devil's answer." &gt;&gt; The devil answer. Oh yeah. There is no tactics. There's no lies. There's no He's been exposed at every level. Now, how is he going to bring you to the supper unless he shows you what the way is and every trap that the enemy has laid to you? Now, he's because remember in the process of overcoming, you have to have somebody who knows the way, &gt;&gt; right? You have to have somebody. So, what he does, he goes to Calvary, he overcomes and he comes, he says, "Now I have overcome." Now, what he does is he says, "Okay, come put your arm across from me. I want you to walk side by side. I will now show you the way. Now, every footstep that he's making, he knows exactly where he's stepping at. Why? Because he's already overcame that. So, your your calling in your life, the only thing God is asking you is to accept and to walk with him the march of an overcomer. He says, "The bride is the continuation of the book of Acts." The invitation, "The works that I do, ye shall do." Also, he says, "The bride is a written epistle read of all men." The bride is the manifestation of the word of God in the age that we are living in. That's the key in the age that we are. There's so many people that try to interpret this Bible, but we have received, but says in this end time, we have received by God's grace a divine interpretation of the entire Bible. No, no, the interpretation is not the explanation. The interpretation is actually showing you what God has been doing. And but says God interprets his word by bringing it to pass. So God is here showing us every step of the way what he meant is in in his own word. &gt;&gt; We're not making these things up. This is him walking with you. &gt;&gt; He says the bride, he says she is him. Now this will take eternity, I believe, in my opinion for us to ever grasp these things. because he will continually unveil it and unveil it and unveil it and talk to us, talk to us until we get it. She is Christ in the bride form. It's the same anointing. I I said just a moment ago, if the spirit of Picasso was upon me, Barnam says you will draw paintings. If the spirit of Michelangelo was upon me, what I'll do? I'll do sculptural. I'll do whatever all of that. If the spirit Christ is in you, what is it? You'll do the works of Christ. He says she's the gene of God. That's your identification. So what God is, you are. What God is, you are. You can actually look at yourself in the mirror and said, "I am God." They said, "You say you are God." He said, "Well, don't you call them to them the word of God comes to? Don't you call them God? Why are you offended when I say I'm God?" He came to that place when they were lowering the men under. He looked at them, he says, "Oh, thy sin be forgiven thee." They were resentful. They said, "How can you say, who is he that he thinks that he can forgive sin?" He looked at them, he says, "Okay, which one is easy to say, thy sin be forgiven thee or take up thy bed and walk?" Because he can do both. We get caught up in the limitation of the flesh and therefore we try to limit God to our own flesh. God is bigger than our flesh and the only way we can know him is by the revealing of his own word. And I ask you this morning, don't take God and measure him by your mind. Measure him by the greatness of his word and the revelation he's given us. Then only you can live the life above what the flesh can offer. He says she has never done it in the first place. It says she's the gene bride of God in say in fact brother Vanam says she is his victory. We are the victory of Christ. He didn't want that life that was in him to remain in him. And the scripture says unless the seed goes into the ground it remains alone. But if it does, it will bring forth much more. And we are the much more that's been made on known. And we are here to continue, not to do new, but to continue the works of Christ. Why? Because the works that he did, we shall do also. But I said, not by our power, not by our might, but by the spirit of God dwelling in us. God bless you. Let's all stand. I just want to say this. I know I said much, but don't think this is one something that's going to happen in one day. This is the journey of your life. &gt;&gt; It's the journey of your discovery. What I try to do this morning is to paint you the map and the picture of what we are walking into. You may make a step forward and tomorrow you feel like you make a step for backwards. Don't let that discourage you. I want you to continue in the journey. Know that he's still doing the chiseling. He's still removing the pieces that are untowards because he the last thing that he has to do is to separate you. It says the scripture says in that day what he will do he will separate the sheep from the goat. He does the separation and the only way he does the separation is by taking you and removing everything that's not of him. It's like gold said it will take it. The gold will be beaten until the beer himself can see his own reflection. And the only way we can become gold is to lay in the presence of the one that's doing the beating. So all the impurity could be taken out. Brother, my sister, when the impurity is taken out, it will be glorious. And I love that he said, as Paul said, the suffering of this life will not even be close to the glory that awaits us. We're in Christ Jesus. Our gracious father, we thank you this morning. Father, I just poured my heart to this people. And father, my heart desire is that your word may be made on known unto us. And father, the only way we know how to is how your prophet taught us that faith comes from the hearing and the hearing of the word. Father, you said that we have to hear it first and to believe it and then it will drop into our hearts and then it will cause the whole body to obey the word. But say that it's the positive confession. He says if we have negative confession will bring it to come to pass. But if we confess the word every day, he says that you are the high priest of our confession. That you will take that confession and run it up to the father and make it happen. This morning we confess your word. What you say is what we say. What you say is what we believe. We don't want to be anything outside of what you claim us to be. We don't want to be anything outside of what you called us to be. When all is said and done, Lord, we want to be the living image of the living God manifested to this generation. I'm so thankful for these people. Lord, I commit them into your hands. And Brother Jonathan and Sister Blanca and the family down here, Lord, I pray that you keep them into your hands, Lord. Father, I know they have both individual and uh challenges as from the young to the old and and church challenges and all of that. But in all of that, we know that our father suppliers all our needs, Lord. That you be the supplier. You lead them. You grow them. Father, that this place even as the name that it may become a lighthouse to the generation and to the people living in this place that they may come to know that there's a living God among them that's manifested himself in the people. I commit them to you. I thank you for them. I ask that you be with them until we meet again. We love you and we say thank you, Father, for all things. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. You sing that song, I lift your name. Amen. What key I sing it in a &gt;&gt; Yeah. What do you sing it in? B flat. Lord, my heart can grow so [music] far away. Hallelujah.

Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. Amen. And then we'll uh we'll let you go. Remember, we've got a fellowship. We've got food waiting for us. So, please stick around if you can. Enjoy that fellowship with each other. I'm trying to get us out quickly enough so you can shake Brother Billy's hand as well and uh show your appreciation. Amen. Thank him for his efforts and for for sacrificing the way that he has. Amen. But let's sing this song. Amen. Let your word be born in my heart. Lord, produce what you said you were going to produce. Let me surrender enough that I could get out of the way so you can do what I want you to do. Amen. It's in my jacket. Um, amen. Let's sing this before we close. Brother Grant, I'm going to ask you to pray, but I'm going to ask you to pray a little shorter than you normally do, just so we have time to say goodbye to Brother Billy if that's okay, brother. Amen. Let's [music] sing this. It was a tiny [singing] simple stable all beaten [music] and [singing] worn. Oh, heartly a place for a king [music and singing] to be born. He didn't choose something [singing] special to reveal his majesty. [music] So I know if I give him control, he'll be born [singing] in me. [music] Let your [singing] word be born in the manger [music and singing] of my heart. Let it live [music] in me. Let it start. Live inside [singing] this [music] house of clay and mold it every day. Let your [music] word be born in the manger of my heart. [music] Well, outwardly I'm nothing. Not much to behold, unlikely a [singing] place for his word to unfold. But if [music] I just yield this vessel and I let him have his way from [singing] glory on to glory, he'll change me day by day. [music] Let your word be born [singing] in the manger [music] of my heart. Let it live in me. Let [music and singing] it start. Live inside this [music] house of clay and [singing] mold it every day. Let your word be born [music] in the manger of my heart. [music] Oh, outwardly I'm nothing, not much to [singing] behold, unlikely [music] a place for his word to unfold.

Let your word [music] be born [singing] in the manger of my heart. Let it live in me. [music] Let it start. [singing] Live inside [music] this house of clay and mold [singing] it every day. Let [music] your word be [singing] born in the manger of my heart. And let [music] your word be born in the manger [singing and music] of my heart. Oh, let it live in me. Let it [music] start. Live inside this [music and singing] house of clay and hold it every day. that your word be [music] born in the manger of my heart. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our hearts to him. Lord, we thank you for this morning. We thank you for our precious brother, Lord God, as he unveil his life, Lord. And Lord, you speak to him through our hearts, Lord God. Lord God, we ask even this morning, Lord, that the words that were said, Lord God, that will it will bring that Lord God, that experience, Lord God, where your life can be made expressed through us, Lord, Lord God, in this dark hour, Lord. And so we surrender oursel to you one more time, oh God, that you'll have the preeminence, Lord God, and that our lives will be a blessing to someone. Bless them, Lord God. Bless your people, Lord God. And Lord God, remember Lord God, all that we have need of, Lord God, we know God, it's a time of your expression. And Lord God, we ask for life, Lord God, this haze of life, bless us now. We pray, have thy own way, Lord. God, as we go to fellowship, Lord, bless each and everyone, we pray in Jesus Christ's name we say. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, hey. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Hey.
