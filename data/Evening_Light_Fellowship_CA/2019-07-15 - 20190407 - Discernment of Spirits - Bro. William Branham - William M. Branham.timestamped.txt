[39:26] [Music]
[39:37] Amen Lord bless you
[39:40] Lord willing this morning we're going to
[39:43] hear a tape
[39:44] by the prophet that we've heard
[39:48] before
[39:50] it's been a while and this was preached
[39:54] in 1960 and is called discernment of
[39:57] spirit and it was preached at Phoenix
[40:00] Arizona and it's
[40:03] it's it's a blessing because there was
[40:07] much there that I've underlined as much
[40:08] I've highlighted in the message and
[40:12] in going through it myself and
[40:17] as I said explain one time to it brother
[40:20] Danny Olsen's church and I said see I
[40:25] said the Prophet said as you read it the
[40:28] more we were revealed and that's the
[40:31] truth and I said you can take one of
[40:34] these books decisis messages that I have
[40:36] and I said it's orange
[40:40] and I said you take
[40:43] it's blue
[40:45] and now I said is yellow and I said is
[40:49] green I said that's that's the different
[40:51] times that I've read it and I said when
[40:54] I read it first time I highlighted it
[40:57] with maybe one color the next time
[40:58] another color something else struck me a
[41:00] man so we'll hear it again and see if
[41:04] there's anything else is gonna strike
[41:05] you a man so we prayed and
[41:09] brother/sister the words got a strike is
[41:11] every time we hear it amen that's the
[41:14] truth by the grace of Almighty God so
[41:17] god help us that it's just not hearing
[41:19] the letter of the word but getting into
[41:21] the dynamics of the revelation by the
[41:24] grace of God
[41:27] I've been struggling to determine
[41:31] exactly what to do and I didn't decide
[41:33] to play the tape until I was in my
[41:34] office there I was
[41:38] seeking the Lord as to what I should
[41:40] minister on of course we were going to
[41:43] have communion but we postponed it until
[41:45] our brother Chad gets back and the
[41:47] family from Central deferred land and
[41:51] and also there are other things that I
[41:54] was planning to have and that was the
[41:56] sermon that was but brother Matthew
[41:58] mentioned
[42:00] online
[42:02] and also a an article that our brother
[42:06] Alec mentioned so there's much on the
[42:10] list that on the agenda so let's be in
[42:12] prayer for one another and the grace of
[42:14] God be with us and I was just wondering
[42:17] if I should take another few thoughts on
[42:20] grace because I want we have preached on
[42:24] grace grace grace grace and
[42:27] but I wanted to take another thought on
[42:30] another subject on it to explain what is
[42:33] Grace
[42:35] we've seen the examples of it in the
[42:37] scripture God God given grace in the
[42:40] garden God into Genesis to Revelation
[42:43] but I was going to take Hayes take a
[42:46] sermon and just explain what is Grace in
[42:49] your life what is Grace in my life a man
[42:53] the grace of God
[42:56] and we we do have a an expression we
[43:01] believe that we've urged so many times
[43:02] on merited favor but it goes deeper than
[43:07] that so I wanted to want to take a
[43:10] message of actually lor lor willing on
[43:13] Grace and what is Grace amen we we see
[43:18] or that that was that was grace there
[43:21] that was grace there well this record
[43:23] let's recognize grace in our own lives a
[43:26] man this understand the depth of grace a
[43:29] man the revelation of grace so that we
[43:33] really really I tell you if you get the
[43:36] revelation of grace you home with you
[43:39] yeah you're you'll recognize and you
[43:42] realize that I I are absolutely nobody
[43:45] and I am absolutely nothing but for the
[43:49] grace of God amen it's not me no matter
[43:52] what I know no matter what I can do no
[43:56] matter not none of these things no no
[43:58] the important thing you know you know in
[44:00] all of our lives is Grace
[44:02] amen and what grace is doing God in
[44:07] simplicity by the grace of God amen so
[44:11] we'll hear the message on discernment of
[44:13] spirit
[44:14] and
[44:16] the Spirit says here of the by the title
[44:20] there's terminal spirit the spirit
[44:22] speaks through the Prophet amen Marcy
[44:26] 1960 a man I want you to turn with me to
[44:29] st. Matthew's Gospel chapter 24
[44:34] because I want to eventually get into a
[44:36] message that brother Brown uses this
[44:38] contest exon and
[44:41] it's the anointed ones at the end time
[44:44] the anointed ones at the end time
[44:48] and
[44:51] there's tremendous
[44:53] you better make sure you got the right
[44:55] anointing on you
[44:57] amen because they're going to be so
[45:00] close who would deceive the very elect
[45:01] if possible
[45:03] so make sure you got the it's the Holy
[45:06] Ghost not the hähnel the ghost make sure
[45:09] you in Christ and not not the twin
[45:13] because the father of God said that the
[45:15] Christ and Anti Christ are so close you
[45:19] know it would deceive the very elect if
[45:20] possible but he said they're like twins
[45:23] in the same church so let's just make
[45:26] sure that we that we were worshipping
[45:28] Christ not Antichrist and they can be
[45:31] religious and and all all these things
[45:34] but brother sister god have mercy on us
[45:37] because that's why there's oh well if
[45:40] you're a seen of God you want me to see
[45:42] he'll be there to help you but if you're
[45:45] not seed of God you'll be deceived you
[45:48] go you'll give yourself over to another
[45:50] spirit a man oh I I'm I believe God I
[45:54] believe this I believe that no no no
[45:56] there's let's make our calling and
[45:58] election sure because if if it is God
[46:01] you it's gonna reflect the life of Jesus
[46:03] amen the attitude of Jesus the spirit of
[46:07] Jesus amen and you want to add to the
[46:10] word you won't take from the word grace
[46:12] in Matthew chapter
[46:15] 24 and verse
[46:18] 15
[46:20] when you therefore shall see the
[46:24] abomination of desolation spoken
[46:26] of by Daniel the prophet
[46:29] stand in the Holy Place whoso readeth
[46:34] let him understand then let them which
[46:39] be in Judaea flee into the mountains
[46:42] let him which is on the housetop not
[46:45] come down to take anything out of his
[46:48] house they met
[46:51] neither let him which is in the field
[46:54] returned back to take his clothes and
[46:57] woe unto them that are with child and to
[47:00] them that give suck in those days but
[47:04] pray that your flight be not in the
[47:07] winter neither on the Sabbath day
[47:10] for then shall be Great Tribulation such
[47:14] as was not since the beginning of the
[47:18] world to this time we're not far from
[47:21] that Great Tribulation
[47:23] now the ride doesn't go into the Great
[47:25] Tribulation shoe but I believe that the
[47:28] bride's going to experience the the
[47:31] introduction of it amen as it were there
[47:34] as there's the manna lap over in all the
[47:36] church ages one H - another one H -
[47:39] another one age to another and in the in
[47:42] the last age and we have believer in the
[47:44] bride H there's you're going you're
[47:46] going to see the the Great Tribulation
[47:51] you're going to see it being it on its
[47:53] way coming as try it's right so but he
[47:58] promised he promised us in in in the
[48:00] sixth search H he said I'm gonna try the
[48:03] world he said I'm gonna do this I'm
[48:05] gonna do that but he said I'm not gonna
[48:06] let I gotta let you be there you won't
[48:09] be there a man he's gonna take the bride
[48:12] out Amen by grace but there's gonna be
[48:16] many there's 68 million and laid down
[48:18] their lives for
[48:20] Christianity in the last two thousand
[48:23] years
[48:24] sixty-eight million that's right now not
[48:28] all of them are going to be there
[48:29] because you can lay down your lives you
[48:32] can die for it but if you don't have the
[48:34] if you don't have divine love it's all
[48:37] in vain a man so we make sure that make
[48:41] sure that your life on the inside the
[48:43] inside brother that the roots of it all
[48:46] is divine love a man and you love him
[48:50] they man the grace of God brother and
[48:54] that by grace that will not be in the
[48:57] Great Tribulation but will go in the
[49:00] rapture by grace
[49:02] and again it's on merited paper you
[49:06] don't deserve it
[49:07] amen you acknowledge that it's all in
[49:11] Christ it's Jesus for then shall be
[49:14] Great Tribulation such as was not since
[49:16] the beginning of the world to this time
[49:19] no nor ever shall be what or not what a
[49:23] time it's going to be and brother we can

[49:45] be shortened and then if any man shall
[49:48] say unto you lo ears Christ or there
[49:50] believe it not a
[49:53] man this is the warning for there shall
[49:57] arise false Christ's or false anointed
[50:00] ones and false prophets false

[51:31] that I did play a DVD or whatever they
[51:36] had back then and I showed it to you and

[51:45] they do how they do it when they young
[51:47] when they're middle-aged when they're
[51:49] old how they act and so on and how the
[51:52] young treat the old legals a man when
[51:56] when when they get old do young
[51:59] recognize oh they're getting old so they
[52:02] want they want him to get strength so

[52:23] know too that
[52:25] hey the Eagles can do something no other
[52:27] bird can do
[52:28] of course eagles fly higher but Eagles
[52:32] can fly in
[52:34] towards the Sun that's right not all
[52:38] birds could do that
[52:40] but the Eagles can't well why does it
[52:43] why can't the other birds do that
[52:45] because it'll blind them because of the
[52:48] brightness of the Sun of blinding them
[52:50] but with the eagle the eagle can fly
[52:52] into the Sun and and its eyes adjust to
[52:55] the brightness of the Sun and I'll keep
[52:58] on going if there's the if there's any
[52:59] other birds after it are tried to fight
[53:01] it it'll go into the Sun the others got
[53:04] too far away but they'll keep going the
[53:07] Bride of Christ will fly into the Sun

[57:24] heart I filled
[57:26] towards one the holiest of holy coming
[57:32] down to the earth and to redeem a sinner
[57:35] like myself and I'm sure that these
[57:40] ministers it's present now can feel the
[57:44] same way that it was by your grace that
[57:48] we have been made the ministers of this
[57:51] covenant
[57:52] that thou has given with Adam's fallen
[57:56] race and we are here this morning father
[58:00] gathered for no other purpose but to
[58:04] know and to study to know rather the
[58:08] will of God and what we must do to make
[58:12] Christ real to the people of this
[58:15] generation
[58:17] knowing surely that in the day of the
[58:20] judgement we will be brought face to
[58:24] face with this generation and being
[58:27] ministers we will be judges and the
[58:33] people to which we have spoken to and
[58:36] their attitude towards the word that we
[58:38] bring them will determine their eternal
[58:41] destination
[58:42] therefore Lord in that day we would be a
[58:45] judge for our against the generation
[58:49] that we preached to father God please do
[58:53] Jesus name let us not say one word that
[58:56] would be wrong but may we have sincere
[59:00] hearts and open minds that we might
[59:03] receive the things that's yours that we
[59:05] might be able to go out into our
[59:08] different fields of work after today and
[59:11] and be better equipped because of our
[59:14] meeting with you this morning
[59:15] Granite Lord won't you come and be our
[59:18] speaker and our ears and our tongue and
[59:22] our thoughts let the meditation my heart
[59:26] thoughts in my mind all that is within
[59:30] me and within these my brethren and
[59:32] sisters may it be acceptable in thy
[59:35] sight Lord that we might be so filled in
[59:38] charge with our spirit of your present
[59:42] shear that the room would become the
[59:45] room not so much the building that we
[59:47] are sitting in but the building that we
[59:50] are living in become altogether a cloud
[59:53] of the glory of God we might leave here
[59:56] this morning so filled with the Holy
[59:58] Spirit that we would be more determined
[1:00:00] than ever before in life to carry the
[1:00:03] message to the dying generation that
[1:00:05] we're living in here is Lord and speak
[1:00:08] to us through that word far we asked it
[1:00:11] in the name of the son and our Savior
[1:00:14] Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:16] I

[1:01:41] done his wonders and the judgments of
[1:01:44] his mouth o ye seed of Abraham his
[1:01:48] servants eat children of Jacob is chosen
[1:01:52] he is the Lord our God his judgments are
[1:01:56] in all the earth
[1:02:01] he has remembered his covenant forever
[1:02:04] the words which he commanded to a
[1:02:08] thousand generations
[1:02:11] which covet he made with Abraham and is
[1:02:15] old unta dyzee and
[1:02:18] confirmed the same into Jacob for a law
[1:02:21] and the Israel for an everlasting
[1:02:24] covenant
[1:02:26] saying unto thee will I give the land of
[1:02:30] Canaan the lot of your inheritance
[1:02:33] when they were but a few man in number
[1:02:37] yay
[1:02:39] very few and strangers in it
[1:02:44] when they went from one nation to
[1:02:48] another and from one
[1:02:49] kingdom to another people he suffered no
[1:02:53] man to do them wrong
[1:02:56] yea he reproved Kings father's sake
[1:03:00] saying touch not my anointed and do my
[1:03:05] prophets no harm
[1:03:09] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:03:12] words I
[1:03:16] have a few scriptures written out here
[1:03:19] somewhere that I was going to refer to
[1:03:21] perhaps along the road I
[1:03:26] wonder today who's going to be the next
[1:03:30] president the elections coming up you
[1:03:32] know who's going to be President
[1:03:37] this next turn
[1:03:39] what if I knew there's only one that
[1:03:44] does know and that's God and
[1:03:47] what if God would reveal to me who's
[1:03:50] going to be the next president and I
[1:03:53] stood here in Phoenix and made a
[1:03:55] prediction that such-and-such a man
[1:03:58] would be the next president of the
[1:04:00] United States
[1:04:02] and they would place that in papers and
[1:04:05] so forth and I would hit it right on the
[1:04:09] dot it would be perfect
[1:04:12] and
[1:04:14] it would be all that I had said would
[1:04:17] come to pass but what good would it do
[1:04:21] what good is it anyhow if I if I should
[1:04:25] do such a thing
[1:04:27] the papers would advertise it and it
[1:04:30] would go out maybe if such a person
[1:04:32] could make such a prediction and it
[1:04:35] would be true all the newspapers and
[1:04:37] magazines would would pass on it
[1:04:41] but you know that God doesn't do things
[1:04:44] like that
[1:04:46] God doesn't use his power and his gifts
[1:04:50] for foolishness
[1:04:52] it's going to be whatever's president
[1:04:55] it'll be president and to know now which
[1:04:57] would be president wouldn't help us one
[1:05:00] penny
[1:05:02] it wouldn't do us one bit of good to
[1:05:06] know who's going to be President
[1:05:08] so therefore God doesn't do those things
[1:05:12] like that and then if I made such a
[1:05:15] prediction as that and it come to pass
[1:05:19] and the newspapers packed it and the
[1:05:21] magazines then it would be to my glory
[1:05:26] people would say look what a great
[1:05:28] prophet brother Branham is he told us
[1:05:32] long before it happened just who would
[1:05:36] be President and that would be to my
[1:05:38] glory
[1:05:40] but God doesn't want he's not interested
[1:05:43] in working things to my glory
[1:05:45] or to to any other man's glory he's
[1:05:50] interested to work things to his glory
[1:05:55] something that will profit like Paul
[1:05:59] said if we speak with tongues and do not
[1:06:02] have an interpreter what good does it do
[1:06:04] we only glory for ourselves and that's
[1:06:08] ready by ourselves that's
[1:06:11] counting out of the line for God
[1:06:15] God wants to be edified himself and
[1:06:19] we're not seek self edification but to
[1:06:23] edify God with all we do so therefore I
[1:06:28] believe this morning if I knew who he
[1:06:31] would be and exactly when he would be
[1:06:34] elected and all how many votes he'd be
[1:06:36] over under or whatever it might be it
[1:06:39] wouldn't do one bit of good to tell it
[1:06:43] it'd be best for me just to keep it
[1:06:46] still if I did know it not try to
[1:06:48] publish it because there would be there
[1:06:51] would be no reason for me to do it cause
[1:06:54] it's going to be anyhow and it doesn't
[1:06:57] make us that much difference
[1:06:59] who's going to be President but God when
[1:07:03] he uses his gifts he uses them for his
[1:07:09] own glory and for the glory of his
[1:07:14] people for the glory of his church for
[1:07:18] the edifying of the body of Christ and
[1:07:21] for the glory of the kingdom of God
[1:07:25] that's why he gives these things in his
[1:07:28] church why ask teachers prophets
[1:07:32] evangelist pastors they are for the
[1:07:36] edification of the church and for the
[1:07:41] glory of God the Prophet is not to get
[1:07:45] out and mingle with the world and try to
[1:07:47] take a gift like Balaam did and make
[1:07:50] havoc our our money out of it or
[1:07:53] something if he's a prophet he's
[1:07:56] supposed to reveal God to the church and
[1:07:59] stay out of the things of the world
[1:08:02] it's all for the glory of God
[1:08:05] now we do have and I think it's a good
[1:08:10] thing for us as ministers the father are
[1:08:14] our when we see such things in the world
[1:08:18] as we see today and we have an order
[1:08:21] from God is for the discerning of
[1:08:24] spirits trying the spirit I
[1:08:29] believe that that is a very great lesson
[1:08:33] for the church today is to try the
[1:08:36] spirit of anything have discernment of
[1:08:40] the spirit I
[1:08:43] do not think that we should ever by any
[1:08:47] means ever try to judge a person by the
[1:08:51] denomination they belong to or by the
[1:08:55] group that they are assembled with
[1:08:57] whether they be Methodist Baptist
[1:09:00] Presbyterian
[1:09:01] Pentecostal are or whatever they are we
[1:09:05] should never judge the man by the
[1:09:08] denomination that he belongs to
[1:09:11] we should always judge him by the spirit
[1:09:15] he has
[1:09:18] the spirit whether he's a
[1:09:22] Lateran or far marine or inner outer
[1:09:26] rain or no rain or whatever it might be
[1:09:28] we should never judge him by that but by
[1:09:31] his Spirit we are to discern spirits
[1:09:37] watch what the man has in mind
[1:09:40] what he has what he's trying to
[1:09:45] if the man buy a gift no matter how
[1:09:48] great the gift is
[1:09:51] now I want to get this to the church
[1:09:54] this morning which into the different
[1:09:57] denominations you are still the Church
[1:09:59] of the Living God together
[1:10:02] and this is the thing I want to get to
[1:10:07] you see that we are really not divided
[1:10:11] we are the stones that's cut in
[1:10:14] different forms all to the glory of God
[1:10:17] now there is so much in the day that we
[1:10:21] live in pertaining to gifts so many
[1:10:25] people judge people by gifts that they
[1:10:28] have well I believe that these things
[1:10:32] are gifts I
[1:10:33] believe that what we see take place is
[1:10:36] gifts and their god-given gifts but we
[1:10:42] if we do not use them in the right way
[1:10:45] that God intended them to be used then
[1:10:50] we can do more harm with the gifts than
[1:10:53] we could if we did not have the gifts
[1:10:58] the other night I made a statement at
[1:11:01] the pulpit saying this that I would
[1:11:03] rather see brotherly love existing among
[1:11:07] the church if we didn't have one case of
[1:11:09] healing or anything else
[1:11:11] we must know what these things are far
[1:11:14] now if a man comes and he has a great
[1:11:18] gift no matter if he belongs to our
[1:11:21] denomination or another denomination
[1:11:23] don't judge him but what denomination he
[1:11:26] come from how he dresses but what you
[1:11:30] want to see is what he's trying to do
[1:11:33] with that gift what purpose he has if
[1:11:37] he's trying to take his influence and
[1:11:39] build himself a great name out of it I'd
[1:11:42] have discernment of spirit up to know
[1:11:44] that's wrong no matter how greater
[1:11:47] teacher he is how powerful he is how
[1:11:50] intellectual he is or how his give
[1:11:53] operates if he isn't trying to achieve
[1:11:57] something for the benefit of the body of
[1:12:00] Christ your own spiritual discernment
[1:12:03] would tell you that that's wrong
[1:12:05] no matter how actor how perfect how it
[1:12:09] is it's wrong if it isn't used for the
[1:12:12] body of Jesus Christ to
[1:12:17] achieve something maybe he's got a great
[1:12:20] gift that he could draw people together
[1:12:22] with a great intellectual or a spiritual
[1:12:25] power that he could draw people together
[1:12:27] and maybe he's trying to take that gift
[1:12:29] and make yourself famous
[1:12:32] so do you have a big name
[1:12:35] so that other brethren will look up to
[1:12:37] him is some big person then that's wrong
[1:12:42] maybe he's trying to to edify a certain
[1:12:46] thing here that he wants everybody else
[1:12:49] to get out of the picture let him and
[1:12:51] his group be the picture that's still
[1:12:53] wrong
[1:12:54] but if he has a gift of God and he's
[1:12:58] trying to edify the body of Christ then
[1:13:02] I don't care what he belongs to you're
[1:13:04] not discerning the man you're discerning
[1:13:07] the spirit the life that's in the man
[1:13:10] and that's what God told us to do
[1:13:13] not one time was we ever Commission to
[1:13:16] discern that the man's group but we was
[1:13:23] constrained I'm commanded by God to
[1:13:26] discern the spirit in the man
[1:13:30] what he's trying to do what the spirit
[1:13:35] in his life is trying to lead him to and
[1:13:38] then if we can find out that he's trying
[1:13:41] to lead the people not to break them up
[1:13:46] but to bring them together and to bring
[1:13:49] the Church of the Living God not all to
[1:13:52] one denomination but to a understanding
[1:13:55] a
[1:13:56] fellowship a unity of spirit then if he
[1:14:02] is far marine or Lateran or whatever it
[1:14:04] is his spirit and he is purpose is right
[1:14:08] and the spirit that's any no matter what
[1:14:12] movie belongs to the spirit that's in
[1:14:15] him is trying to part the people to
[1:14:17] Calvary away from himself or away from
[1:14:21] anything else but is only achievement he
[1:14:24] has is to part them to Calvary he
[1:14:27] doesn't care whether he's even knowed or
[1:14:30] not he doesn't care whether he's even
[1:14:32] his own movement which is fine
[1:14:34] see it's good if he is a Methodist or a
[1:14:39] Presbyterian or a Roman Catholic or
[1:14:41] whatever he wants to be by denomination
[1:14:44] but what is he trying to do the purpose
[1:14:47] of his heart that he's trying to get
[1:14:49] then you can see what's in the man's
[1:14:51] life whether his motives as far as his
[1:14:55] denomination whether it's for yourself
[1:14:58] well there's far worthy fame whether
[1:15:01] it's for big names to say I predicted
[1:15:04] that come just exactly the path now I
[1:15:07] see that's wrong right there to begin
[1:15:09] with but if he's trying to use what gods
[1:15:12] give him as a teacher as a prophet as
[1:15:15] the seer a new testament prophet is a
[1:15:18] preacher we all know that just any
[1:15:20] minister that's a preacher is a prophet
[1:15:22] a New Testament prophet if he's
[1:15:24] prophesying
[1:15:25] preaching not to try to edify himself to
[1:15:28] make a big name or to edify his
[1:15:31] organization which he should be in an
[1:15:34] organization Here I am without one but
[1:15:36] yet preaching you should be that's right
[1:15:38] every man or to have a church home you
[1:15:41] ought to have a place not just to float
[1:15:45] about from pillar to post but have
[1:15:47] somewhere that you go to church and you
[1:15:49] call it your church somewhere you pay
[1:15:51] your time and somewhere that you help
[1:15:53] support the cause take your choice but
[1:15:57] then don't never just fellowship the
[1:15:59] other man because he don't belong with
[1:16:01] your group see discern his spirit and
[1:16:03] see if he's got the same purpose in
[1:16:05] heart then you got fellowship one with
[1:16:07] another you're working for one great
[1:16:09] cause that's the cause of Christ I think
[1:16:12] that is absolutely true now if we will
[1:16:16] notice the motives and objectives of the
[1:16:19] old Testament prophets
[1:16:22] damn man had one objective that was
[1:16:26] Jesus Christ they had one thing that
[1:16:30] their whole theme of the Old Testament
[1:16:33] was built around the coming Messiah
[1:16:36] they they did not go out and do things
[1:16:39] just for money or for fame they had one
[1:16:44] thing they were anointed with the Spirit
[1:16:47] of God and they predicted the coming
[1:16:50] Messiah and those men were so anointed
[1:16:55] with the spirit
[1:16:56] until they sometimes acted like the
[1:17:01] spirit that was within them they spoke
[1:17:04] seemingly all themselves
[1:17:07] watch how the Spirit of God made that
[1:17:09] man act will take for instance Moses the
[1:17:14] great prophet how that
[1:17:17] that man had no selfish objectives at
[1:17:20] all
[1:17:21] he could have been the king of Egypt he
[1:17:25] could have had the world under his feet
[1:17:27] but because that he was a prophet at
[1:17:32] heart
[1:17:33] he refused to be called the son of
[1:17:37] Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:17:39] rather to suffer the persecution and the
[1:17:44] trials of
[1:17:45] Christ esteeming the treasures of heaven
[1:17:50] greater treasures than them of Egypt he
[1:17:53] forsook and denied himself other worldly
[1:17:57] fame of the luxury and the things that
[1:18:02] Life offers
[1:18:04] he had to look beyond that
[1:18:09] see he could have been that just take
[1:18:12] the minister today if he has the baptism
[1:18:15] of the Holy Spirit and he knows that if
[1:18:19] he preaches that word it's going to cut
[1:18:22] his pain down it's going to put him in a
[1:18:25] little bitty church somewhere or maybe
[1:18:27] out on the street
[1:18:28] but he knows that something in his heart
[1:18:32] is
[1:18:35] he sees the coming of the Lord he
[1:18:38] doesn't care whether that he has a big
[1:18:41] church our little church he doesn't care
[1:18:43] whether he has today's food are not no
[1:18:46] food he doesn't care whether he has good
[1:18:48] closure doesn't have good clothes he's
[1:18:51] only a mindful of one thing and that's
[1:18:54] the very life with any crying out
[1:18:59] he's trying to achieve something for the
[1:19:03] glory of God and that man in doing so
[1:19:06] will act the very life of the Spirit
[1:19:09] that's any
[1:19:10] do you follow me he'll act it out look
[1:19:15] at Moses when it come to a time that he
[1:19:18] displayed all his life was the Spirit of
[1:19:21] Christ but Christ was any
[1:19:24] Christ was in Moses by measure
[1:19:28] now if we notice he was born in the time
[1:19:33] of persecution the children was killed
[1:19:37] to try to get him just exactly like they
[1:19:40] did
[1:19:40] Jesus and we find out that when it come
[1:19:45] to a place that the children of Israel
[1:19:48] had disobeyed in such a way until God
[1:19:52] was angry with them
[1:19:55] and he said to Moses step aside
[1:20:00] and I'll destroy the whole group of them
[1:20:03] and I'll take of you and raise up
[1:20:06] another generation Moses truest self in
[1:20:09] the path of God's judgment
[1:20:12] said take me before you take them in
[1:20:15] other words before you can get them
[1:20:17] you'll have to come over me that's
[1:20:19] exactly what Jesus Christ did
[1:20:23] when God would have wept the whole face
[1:20:25] of the earth off with these sinners you
[1:20:27] and i but Christ do yourself in the path
[1:20:32] the God could not do it he couldn't come
[1:20:35] over his own son and when God seen that
[1:20:39] spirit in Moses hanging in the judgment
[1:20:41] like a cross oh you can't come to him
[1:20:44] you'll have to take me first
[1:20:46] see the Spirit of God and Moses
[1:20:50] when he could been king of Egypt when he
[1:20:54] could have had every luxury in the world
[1:20:56] to be popular
[1:20:58] when he could have been the great king
[1:21:00] of the world at that time
[1:21:02] but he chose to suffer the persecutions
[1:21:06] and the affliction for he esteemed the
[1:21:09] reproach of Christ greater treasures and
[1:21:11] that of Egypt
[1:21:14] see he through his self in a way why it
[1:21:17] was God in Moses did that the normal
[1:21:22] thinking if directional man would never
[1:21:24] do that he would take the easy road so
[1:21:28] no matter how much of fanatic Moses
[1:21:30] seemed to be he was trying you see he
[1:21:32] was a true prophet of God because he was
[1:21:34] trying to achieve something for the
[1:21:36] kingdom of God
[1:21:38] now with his great gift of prophecy he
[1:21:41] might have been a wise man could have
[1:21:43] stood up in Egypt and said now wait our
[1:21:45] prophesy so and so I'll say so and so
[1:21:48] and as with his prophecy but it's and
[1:21:51] all you'd have been world famous
[1:21:54] but if that wasn't in his heart it
[1:21:57] couldn't be in his heart
[1:21:59] so if you see a person with a great gift
[1:22:02] trying to do something to glorify
[1:22:04] themselves your own discernment of the
[1:22:07] Spirit tells you that's wrong
[1:22:10] but Moses was trying to achieve
[1:22:13] something for the glory of God no matter
[1:22:15] how bad it was how evil it looked how
[1:22:18] much it was talked about the spirit in
[1:22:21] Moses directed him straight to the line
[1:22:23] of duty
[1:22:24] the spirit in him look at Joseph
[1:22:28] Joseph was when he was born he was loved
[1:22:32] of the Father and hated by his brethren
[1:22:36] perfect type of Christ and the only one
[1:22:40] to them the same father but the reason
[1:22:44] his brother hated him was about a cause
[1:22:46] because God had made him a prophet
[1:22:50] spiritual a seer and they hated him for
[1:22:54] that very purpose
[1:22:56] but Joseph could not help it because God
[1:23:00] had made him that way and what's the
[1:23:02] spirit of God in Joseph
[1:23:07] watch what he did he even acted the part
[1:23:11] of Christ
[1:23:12] he was hated of his brethren loved
[1:23:16] Darby's father because all the spirit
[1:23:19] made the difference he was a spiritual
[1:23:22] man
[1:23:23] he saw visions he interpreted dreams he
[1:23:28] did not do it for his own glory he did
[1:23:31] it because I was something in him the
[1:23:34] Spirit of God he wouldn't went out there
[1:23:37] by his own self and I've been throwing
[1:23:39] him to a ditch and have his poor old
[1:23:41] father to grieve all those years sold
[1:23:44] for nearly 30 pieces of silver taken up
[1:23:47] from the ditch and became the right-hand
[1:23:50] man of Pharaoh the king of earth at that
[1:23:52] time and in his prison house there was a
[1:23:56] butler and a baker and one was lost and
[1:24:00] the other was saved by his prediction in
[1:24:03] the prison house I did you notice Jesus
[1:24:07] when he came he was loved of the Father
[1:24:10] and
[1:24:11] the father gave Joseph a coat of many
[1:24:15] colors the rainbow a covenant and the
[1:24:19] Father God gave His Son Jesus the
[1:24:25] and then the Jewish brother hated him
[1:24:30] without a cause
[1:24:33] he had no reason to hate him he was
[1:24:36] spiritual and he was God's Word made
[1:24:39] manifest
[1:24:41] he come to do the will of the Father he
[1:24:44] come to fulfill the Scriptures he came
[1:24:47] to bring them peace
[1:24:48] but they misunderstood him and hated him
[1:24:51] without a cause they didn't stop to try
[1:24:54] to see what he was trying to achieve
[1:24:57] they just judged him because it he
[1:24:59] didn't agree with them they may he makes
[1:25:02] his self so and soul he makes himself
[1:25:05] God
[1:25:06] he was God God was in him the Bible said
[1:25:10] God was in Christ
[1:25:12] manifested himself to the world
[1:25:15] he was the god of glory
[1:25:19] manifesting the glory of God
[1:25:23] look at Moses he couldn't help throwing
[1:25:25] himself there
[1:25:27] he didn't do that hypocritically he did
[1:25:30] it because God was in him
[1:25:34] neither could Joseph help being what he
[1:25:37] was
[1:25:38] because it was God in him working or
[1:25:42] displaying himself through the man
[1:25:44] never did he do it for self glory any
[1:25:48] man that if those priests would only had
[1:25:50] the discernment of spirit as I'm
[1:25:52] speaking to you this morning regardless
[1:25:54] of how much the world talked about him
[1:25:56] they still would have known
[1:25:59] if they don't look to the word if they
[1:26:02] were seeing his purpose he was always
[1:26:05] doing that to glorify the father he said
[1:26:09] they said all this man's a great healer
[1:26:10] he does these things like that he said I
[1:26:13] can do nothing till the father shows me
[1:26:16] it is not me that doeth the works
[1:26:20] it's the father and that dwelleth in me
[1:26:22] he doeth the works
[1:26:25] never tucked the glory
[1:26:28] neither would any servant of God take
[1:26:31] glory neither would any servant of God
[1:26:33] take a gift of God and try to glorify
[1:26:35] himself or anything else but is Right
[1:26:37] achievement is to do something to the
[1:26:39] glory of God
[1:26:42] that's why I see the same thing today
[1:26:45] we must have discernment of spirits to
[1:26:49] see a person what they're trying to do
[1:26:51] or are they trying to glorify God or
[1:26:54] they're trying to glorify themselves now
[1:26:56] the Spirit of God working in man makes
[1:27:00] man act like God
[1:27:04] no wonder jesus said is not it written
[1:27:07] ye are gods
[1:27:10] and if they call them gods to whom the
[1:27:14] Spirit of God came to how can you
[1:27:16] condemn me that when I am the son of God
[1:27:19] if you could see the Spirit of God in
[1:27:22] Moses which he was gone Moses was a God
[1:27:27] Joseph was a God the prophets were gods
[1:27:30] the Bible said they were
[1:27:32] they were gods because they had
[1:27:35] completely surrendered themselves to the
[1:27:38] Spirit of God that they were working for
[1:27:41] the glory of God and when a man is so
[1:27:44] anointed with the spirit
[1:27:47] I'll let this go real deep under the
[1:27:51] fifth rib on the left side when a man is
[1:27:55] anointed of the Spirit of God his habits
[1:27:58] his actions and everything is God moving
[1:28:01] in him
[1:28:03] sometimes he's misjudged look at David
[1:28:06] in the 23rd psalm he cried my God my God
[1:28:10] why has thou forsaken me as if he was if
[1:28:17] David was the man all they that passed
[1:28:20] me by shoot to lip out at me he was so
[1:28:24] anointed with God he was so perfectly
[1:28:28] surrendered to God and the nor demons
[1:28:31] own even such a way are when he cried by
[1:28:33] the Spirit of God if somebody been
[1:28:36] standing there see why look he thinks
[1:28:37] somebody shoot her lip out of him why is
[1:28:40] God forsaken him it wasn't David he was
[1:28:44] a spirit crying out to David
[1:28:48] my God my God why has thou forsaken me
[1:28:52] my booms all stare at me they have
[1:28:55] pierced my hands and my feet well
[1:28:58] somebody said listen that hypocrite up
[1:29:00] there whose hands is pierced whose feed
[1:29:02] his Pierce that's the intellectual but
[1:29:05] one who had discernment of spirit knew
[1:29:08] that that was a Spirit of God him him
[1:29:10] crying out
[1:29:13] the Spirit of God he's got the action of
[1:29:16] God and the action of God is never to
[1:29:20] break us up the action of God is to draw
[1:29:23] us together for we are one in Christ
[1:29:26] Jesus and God's purpose is to bring us
[1:29:29] together
[1:29:30] love
[1:29:32] one another
[1:29:34] now that great prophets we see the
[1:29:38] spirit moving in them Jesus called them
[1:29:41] gods
[1:29:42] he said they were God now when the
[1:29:46] spirit come to them by measure but when
[1:29:50] he come on the one Jesus which was the
[1:29:52] son of God it come to him without
[1:29:54] measure the fullness of the Godhead
[1:29:58] bodily dwelt in him for he was the
[1:30:00] perfect example
[1:30:03] he was God of glory
[1:30:06] manifesting the glory of God to the
[1:30:10] people God in him going about watch his
[1:30:13] life all the Old Testament he was the
[1:30:17] theme of the Old Testament all the old
[1:30:22] prophets back in the Old Testament cried
[1:30:24] out not to themselves they cried out
[1:30:28] there the Spirit of God making an act
[1:30:30] like God in so much that they were
[1:30:31] called gods and then if the fullness of
[1:30:35] that spirit was manifested in Jesus
[1:30:37] Christ look at David when he was
[1:30:40] dethroned as the king of
[1:30:43] rejected by his own people going up
[1:30:46] mount Olive's north to jerusalem and he
[1:30:48] looked back over the city and wept
[1:30:52] because he was rejected
[1:30:56] what was it it was a spirit of Christ
[1:31:00] 500 years later the son of David Jesus
[1:31:04] said on the same mount looking over the
[1:31:07] city as a rejected King in credit
[1:31:10] Jerusalem
[1:31:13] what I have gathered you your different
[1:31:16] denominations and everything as a hen
[1:31:18] does her brood but you would not how
[1:31:22] offered I have did it now the same
[1:31:26] spirit that was in David that was
[1:31:28] manifested and fullness in Christ is in
[1:31:31] the church today crying to the peoples
[1:31:34] how would I have gathered you and when
[1:31:38] you see separations and and differences
[1:31:41] and and Brotherhood broken up and
[1:31:44] Christian life one against the other
[1:31:46] then it makes the Spirit of God in your
[1:31:49] heart proud
[1:31:51] you're trying to achieve something a
[1:31:54] true prophet of God a true teacher is
[1:31:57] trying to bring the church to a unity of
[1:32:00] spirit a unity of spirit that they might
[1:32:04] recognize God trying to achieve it no
[1:32:07] matter what denomination they belong to
[1:32:09] you or what about it we have discernment
[1:32:12] of spirit to discern the spirit that's
[1:32:14] in the man to see if it be the spirit of
[1:32:15] God or not
[1:32:17] now we noticed when he was here on earth
[1:32:20] how you went about doing good I noticed
[1:32:24] another thing had come to my mind did
[1:32:26] you notice when David was rejected as
[1:32:28] king he went out of the city and a
[1:32:31] little Benjamin mind Benjamin which was
[1:32:34] posed to have been a brother to him
[1:32:36] should have been sorry because he was
[1:32:38] rejected but what he was a crippled man
[1:32:42] and he drug along there with his
[1:32:44] crippled condition throwing dirt on
[1:32:47] David and
[1:32:48] calling him all kinds of bad names and
[1:32:51] cursing him
[1:32:54] in the name of the Lord
[1:32:56] cursing King David in the name of the
[1:32:59] Lord this little crippled up Benjamite
[1:33:02] what's the spirit of God in the spirit
[1:33:05] that ever working
[1:33:07] now if you notice he was crippled it
[1:33:10] represents the spiritual crippled nasaw
[1:33:13] the people today that would make fun of
[1:33:16] the true spirit of God in Christ
[1:33:20] manifesting itself that was a spirit of
[1:33:23] Christ and David being rejected as a
[1:33:25] king and
[1:33:27] today when the people make fun of the
[1:33:30] people who has received the Holy Spirit
[1:33:32] and trying to achieve something at all
[1:33:34] Methodists and Pentecostals and Baptists
[1:33:37] and Pentecostals and Presbyterians and
[1:33:39] all together as a unity as a body of
[1:33:42] Christ
[1:33:43] and
[1:33:45] they see the spirit where you say why
[1:33:47] look at the Pentecostal
[1:33:49] away with me I'm a one run off with
[1:33:52] another man's wife I know this and got
[1:33:54] drunk I know this who did this I know
[1:33:56] this and did that all that but they were
[1:33:59] big enough to hide their own things they
[1:34:02] can hide it but David was exposed
[1:34:06] why he had the Spirit of Christ in him
[1:34:11] that guard said shall I take the head of
[1:34:15] that dog that would curse my king what's
[1:34:19] the spirit of Christ and David let him
[1:34:21] alone for the Lord has told him to curse
[1:34:24] me
[1:34:32] the Lord has told him to curse me
[1:34:36] instead today we don't get up our fists
[1:34:38] and fighting
[1:34:39] chop his head off get him out he don't
[1:34:42] blowing us let him home
[1:34:44] the Lord has told him to curse me that
[1:34:47] little run longer throwing dirt
[1:34:49] on David that's what they do today on
[1:34:52] the Spirit of Christ they're a bunch of
[1:34:54] holy rollers but they're a bunch of this
[1:34:56] there's nothing to him
[1:34:58] to divine healing there's no such a
[1:35:00] thing as angels there's no such a thing
[1:35:01] as prophets all those things of days and
[1:35:04] miracles is past throw a dart but let
[1:35:05] alone
[1:35:07] but when David returned in power
[1:35:12] when he come back that was full king of
[1:35:16] Israel
[1:35:17] don't worry this Jesus whose Spirit we
[1:35:20] have today act in his part will return
[1:35:23] again in a physical body
[1:35:25] second time and glory and power and
[1:35:28] Majesty
[1:35:30] that little dirt thrower fell on his
[1:35:32] face and beg for mercy
[1:35:35] let him alone the Spirit of Christ in us
[1:35:39] don't excommunicating let's remember
[1:35:41] that all these things has got to come to
[1:35:43] pass we've got one thing to do move on
[1:35:47] God promised that he'd make everything
[1:35:49] work together for good to them at loving
[1:35:51] let's keep the discernment of spirit
[1:35:53] keep the objective right we're here to
[1:35:56] serve God each one fellowshipping going
[1:35:59] along and serving God if the man's got
[1:36:01] the wrong kind of am ejective then what
[1:36:03] will happen see now we find out that the
[1:36:07] Spirit of God was in him all the old
[1:36:10] prophets spoke of him all the spirits in
[1:36:13] potion ever little potion wasn't
[1:36:16] glorifying itself through prophets all
[1:36:19] the true prophets was manifesting him
[1:36:22] speaking of him and everything they said
[1:36:26] was fulfilled in him showed it was the
[1:36:30] Spirit of God in them it was fulfilled
[1:36:32] what was it God speaking of himself see
[1:36:36] God manifesting himself through these
[1:36:38] prophets not taking glory who will be
[1:36:40] the next president who will be this and
[1:36:41] hit you own head tell us you itching
[1:36:43] will believe you 10 isn't it it's
[1:36:46] something to manifest God it isn't
[1:36:48] something to make brother weathers here
[1:36:50] our brother chores or brother so-and-so
[1:36:53] out there a great man make him a greater
[1:36:55] than the rest and of his group making
[1:36:57] the greatest man in Phoenix is to make
[1:37:00] William Branham something great but what
[1:37:02] is to do it is to make or Robert
[1:37:03] something great mini-green something
[1:37:05] great but it's a heart
[1:37:07] we're trying to achieve something for
[1:37:10] the kingdom of God it's manifesting God
[1:37:13] all gifts and things doesn't make one
[1:37:16] greater than the other it just makes us
[1:37:18] all working together for the perfection
[1:37:21] of the body that bring us together as
[1:37:24] one people as a people of God but when
[1:37:28] you see them going contrary don't curse
[1:37:30] them Oh
[1:37:32] somebody has to do it
[1:37:34] but wait till Jesus comes in power now
[1:37:38] we see all those prophets peeking every
[1:37:41] one of them was glorifying God and the
[1:37:43] coming Messiah and when they got in the
[1:37:46] spirit they acted and spoke and live the
[1:37:50] life out just like the Messiah did if it
[1:37:54] did that side the cross speaking obvious
[1:37:57] coming how much more will it after his
[1:37:59] coming will put the Spirit of Messiah in
[1:38:02] the church to do work and live like the
[1:38:06] Messiah
[1:38:07] it's a Spirit of God
[1:38:09] discern that spirit see whether it is of
[1:38:12] God or not see whether it acts like you
[1:38:15] see if your emotions if somebody kicks
[1:38:17] up something issue of throws dirt upon
[1:38:19] your life when you know you're as
[1:38:20] innocent as you can be and you know if
[1:38:23] you've got the Spirit of God don't chop
[1:38:25] it separate yourself don't try to act
[1:38:27] mean towards him don't curse them just
[1:38:30] walk on or your God did that to give you
[1:38:32] a test to see how you take it
[1:38:35] he'll have to come to it anyhow as I
[1:38:39] said the other day I believe it brother
[1:38:40] Fuller's Church the bicycle rider in
[1:38:43] Canada wall I'm tall take it out ride
[1:38:45] this boy this little old and he's
[1:38:48] the only one couldn't hurry without
[1:38:49] holding the handlebars I'm glad I like
[1:38:52] to be well no handlebar riders take a
[1:38:54] hold of both sides of the cross and say
[1:38:56] nothing in my arms I brainy let me hold
[1:38:59] to the cross Lord I have no internet
[1:39:01] shows I had nothing let me just hold
[1:39:04] here look way out yonder and he had a 12
[1:39:08] inch plank my first city bump to get
[1:39:10] $100 swing bicycle all those boys you
[1:39:13] could arrive without holding go downtown
[1:39:14] get their mothers groceries and come
[1:39:16] back without even touch the handlebars
[1:39:17] they ever want to begin to look they
[1:39:20] wasn't used to holding to the hand of
[1:39:21] ours and they fell off but this little
[1:39:24] little boy got on there and helped the
[1:39:25] handlebars and ruled it to the end they
[1:39:28] asked him so how did you do it he says
[1:39:30] here's where you make your mistake
[1:39:31] fellas you're all better riders than I
[1:39:33] am but you were looking here and said
[1:39:35] makes you nervous to see what is trying
[1:39:37] to balance yourself and you fellow said
[1:39:39] I never looked here at all I'll watch
[1:39:40] the end and it's kept steady that's what
[1:39:44] we're to do don't look at these little
[1:39:46] things now did this one do this or that
[1:39:48] one do that what's the N and keep
[1:39:50] studying
[1:39:51] Christ is coming watch the end just keep
[1:39:55] steady don't notice what's going on now
[1:39:57] watch what's going to go on out down
[1:39:59] there at the end time when we're gonna
[1:40:01] have to stand and give an account for
[1:40:03] alive David wasn't watching that the
[1:40:06] little Benjamite throw dirt on his
[1:40:07] anyhow he never knows him he
[1:40:10] wouldn't he met the guard cut his head
[1:40:12] off the day my own God told him to do
[1:40:15] that God told him to curse me let him
[1:40:17] alone or David knew that Sunday
[1:40:21] he was returning in power
[1:40:23] that Benjamin did have his time
[1:40:26] yes that's it the church will rise a
[1:40:30] triumph I
[1:40:33] was just sent to pray for a sick
[1:40:35] children anyhow that's all I can do
[1:40:37] wherever they are in what church the art
[1:40:38] makes me no difference I'm trying to
[1:40:40] pray for his sick children trying to
[1:40:43] manifest a gift for his glory that's
[1:40:45] reason I never did belong to anything
[1:40:47] now remember that's alright see I'm not
[1:40:49] I'm not saying that now I won't you get
[1:40:51] to clear up even God's got Christians in
[1:40:54] ever Church his children he's never
[1:40:57] questioned me on that I just sent to
[1:40:59] pray for the children and to do these
[1:41:01] things and to manifest him now you see
[1:41:04] Jesus and these prophets everything that
[1:41:07] they spoke of had to be true for it was
[1:41:10] the power of God in them God Himself
[1:41:13] speaking through them of his own self
[1:41:16] coming to his own glory
[1:41:18] who's president who's gonna is they go
[1:41:22] to we're gonna have enough rain this
[1:41:25] year I don't mean nothing something to
[1:41:28] the glory of God something to set the
[1:41:30] church in order something for the power
[1:41:32] of God not to make yourself a name but
[1:41:34] to make the glory of God manifested now
[1:41:37] we noticed that all those prophets and
[1:41:40] all they said about him everything come
[1:41:43] to true because he was the theme of the
[1:41:46] Old Testament Jesus the Messiah coming
[1:41:49] Messiah was what every prophet looked
[1:41:51] from from Adam to my malachi every
[1:41:56] prophet spoke of the coming of the Lord
[1:41:58] each one putties party because he was
[1:42:01] anointed of God that's all he could
[1:42:03] speak of now
[1:42:05] wish we had more time on but watch
[1:42:07] everything that they said come to pass
[1:42:09] lookie here let's just take some of the
[1:42:11] things to the prophets that a virgin
[1:42:13] shall conceive and bear a child did it
[1:42:16] happen sure his name shall be called
[1:42:19] Emmanuel
[1:42:21] Prince of Peace mighty God everlasting
[1:42:23] father that's what he was exactly the
[1:42:27] everlasting father no man should be
[1:42:28] called father on this earth but God is
[1:42:30] your father all right now let's see
[1:42:32] again he was wounded for our
[1:42:34] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:42:36] iniquity the Chaston fire peace upon him
[1:42:38] with his stripes we were healed pilot's
[1:42:41] judgment Hall while the very man having
[1:42:44] his back blanks life get with a cation
[1:42:47] tailwhip didn't realize it the scripture
[1:42:49] said it would be that way they didn't
[1:42:51] have the sermon of spirit those priests
[1:42:53] you said away with him away with him and
[1:42:55] on the cross when he shot out their lips
[1:42:58] and things like that when he heard him
[1:42:59] crying my god Wow forsake me they didn't
[1:43:03] have discernment he they couldn't
[1:43:05] discern the spirit that's what David was
[1:43:07] speaking of in the twenty second sound
[1:43:09] they shot out their lip not knowing they
[1:43:11] were doing it just the same as that
[1:43:12] Benjamite did to David see he thought
[1:43:15] David is all wrong cause they didn't
[1:43:17] agree with him on his principles of
[1:43:18] running extinct him he didn't understand
[1:43:20] that it was the Spirit of God in David
[1:43:22] doing him that's where we must deserve
[1:43:24] today the spirit of the man what's he
[1:43:26] trying to do what getting it not what
[1:43:29] group he belongs to or what this that or
[1:43:31] the other well there's a white man black
[1:43:33] man yellow man or whatever he is let's
[1:43:35] see what he's trying to achieve and take
[1:43:37] that see what he's trying to do for the
[1:43:40] kingdom of God he's got our ideas to
[1:43:42] ours that's perfectly all right if he's
[1:43:44] trying to achieve something for the
[1:43:45] kingdom of God discerned that any if
[1:43:47] he's wrong and true in heart God would
[1:43:49] bring him around to the truth of the
[1:43:51] thing after a while let him alone they
[1:43:54] won't see what he's trying to do now we
[1:43:56] see here then we find out anything his
[1:44:00] death when he died at the cross and
[1:44:02] crying all the things the prophets spoke
[1:44:05] of him they pierced my hands and my feet
[1:44:07] there it was fulfilled the prophets is
[1:44:10] right they thought it was themselves or
[1:44:11] cried like it was himself but it was
[1:44:13] manifested in the cross he he was
[1:44:17] numbered with the transgressors
[1:44:18] that's what he was done he was with the
[1:44:21] transgressors in his death he made his
[1:44:23] bearer with the rich he did he was
[1:44:25] buried in a rich man's grave I will not
[1:44:28] leave his soul he will not leave my soul
[1:44:32] said David the Spirit of God in David
[1:44:35] speaking out he will not leave my soul
[1:44:37] in Hell neither will he suffer his Holy
[1:44:39] One to see corruption like as if David
[1:44:42] would be the holy one wasn't David it
[1:44:44] was the Spirit of God and David crying
[1:44:46] out
[1:44:47] see the Spirit of God in the man crying
[1:44:50] out some of them said listen that old
[1:44:51] hypocrite up there he wasn't it was a
[1:44:53] spirit of god in him crying out see the
[1:44:56] Spirit of God manifests itself not leave
[1:44:58] his soul in Hell neither go to suffer my
[1:45:00] Holy One to see corruption now brethren
[1:45:02] and closing may I say this our time gets
[1:45:05] away but look may I say this in closing
[1:45:07] but these scriptures here let's see if a
[1:45:11] man that all the Old Testament theme was
[1:45:14] about him all the holy prophets anointed
[1:45:17] with God's Spirit if all that in
[1:45:20] everything that they said was fulfilled
[1:45:23] to the letter exactly in him surely that
[1:45:26] great person called the Son of God ought
[1:45:29] to know how to set up the New Testament
[1:45:31] church
[1:45:33] don't you believe that
[1:45:35] he ought to have a conception to know
[1:45:37] how to set up the New Testament church
[1:45:39] the first thing I want to call your
[1:45:41] attention over here in Matthew sixteenth
[1:45:44] chapter that when he is speaking there
[1:45:46] when he come down was talking to the
[1:45:48] disciples he said who does man say I the
[1:45:50] Son of Man am
[1:45:52] and they said some say your lives and
[1:45:55] some say your so and so and some say
[1:45:57] your sewing sewing like that different
[1:46:00] one he said but who do you say that I am
[1:46:02] and Peter said thou art the Christ the
[1:46:05] Son of the Living God
[1:46:07] he said blessed art thou simon son of
[1:46:10] jonas for flesh and blood has not
[1:46:11] revealed its you but my father which is
[1:46:14] in heaven has revealed this to you and i
[1:46:17] say in any of the art Simon or art Peter
[1:46:19] and upon this rock I will build my
[1:46:21] church and the gates of hell can't
[1:46:23] prevail against it now there were
[1:46:25] speaking of the church now watch closely
[1:46:29] and if I'm wrong God forgive me and you
[1:46:31] forgive me now the Catholic Church says
[1:46:34] that that was a stone lay in there Peter
[1:46:37] and upon Peter he built the church now
[1:46:41] we know that that's wrong we Protestants
[1:46:43] disagree with it but we Protestant says
[1:46:45] it was himself that he built himself a
[1:46:49] church upon himself but if you'll notice
[1:46:51] I want to disagree with that friendly it
[1:46:54] wasn't that it was up on the spiritual
[1:46:57] revelation of himself
[1:46:59] flesh and blood you never learned this
[1:47:02] in a seminary as good as they are you
[1:47:05] never learned this for some church Creed
[1:47:06] as good as it is it's alright but flesh
[1:47:10] and blood has not revealed this to you
[1:47:12] it's not an intellectual conception of
[1:47:14] how you make your speech how you must
[1:47:16] bow yourself how what great thing you
[1:47:18] must do here in earth that isn't what it
[1:47:20] is it isn't build a great thing or do a
[1:47:22] great thing what it is is a revelation
[1:47:24] of the Word of God he was the word in
[1:47:29] the beginning was the word the Word was
[1:47:30] with God in the Word was God and the
[1:47:32] Word was made manifest and dwelt among
[1:47:34] us he was that was the revelation of the
[1:47:38] Word of God
[1:47:39] the spirit in Pete revealing by
[1:47:43] spiritual revelation that he was the son
[1:47:46] of God made manifest
[1:47:48] the god of glory manifesting the glory
[1:47:51] of God upon this rock
[1:47:54] spiritual revelation of the word I'll
[1:47:57] build my church why if them prophets was
[1:48:01] under God speaking by the Holy Spirit
[1:48:04] that that was the son of God the same
[1:48:06] spirit on this side reveals right back
[1:48:08] the same thing
[1:48:10] you see it
[1:48:13] flesh and blood you can't learn it in a
[1:48:15] seminary you learn your get your deed in
[1:48:18] your PhD in L hear that was alright what
[1:48:21] you had it that's right but still that's
[1:48:23] not it you don't have to have it yet
[1:48:26] it's good to have it you can be this
[1:48:29] plus
[1:48:30] but if you have to rub out the plus take
[1:48:33] this
[1:48:34] this is that if they say that
[1:48:41] this
[1:48:43] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:48:46] you you never learned through the
[1:48:48] educational line you never learn it
[1:48:50] through denominational lines they're
[1:48:52] fine education denominations find that's
[1:48:54] part of it but people are leave too much
[1:48:56] to that and they're leaving the
[1:48:58] spiritual discernment'
[1:49:00] the flesh and blood has not revealed
[1:49:03] this youth but my father which is in
[1:49:05] heaven has reveal this to you and upon
[1:49:08] this rock I'll build my church and the
[1:49:11] gates of Hell keeper veil against it
[1:49:14] we'll never be able to prevail show they
[1:49:16] would be against it now watch and see
[1:49:18] where the gates of hell is against it
[1:49:21] against to the denomination the
[1:49:24] government recognizes that
[1:49:26] it is the world recognizes our
[1:49:28] denominations all of them we have the
[1:49:31] rights each one of us as American
[1:49:33] citizens we have the rights of
[1:49:35] denomination which is fine we appreciate
[1:49:37] that but that's not what the gates of
[1:49:39] Hale's against it's against the
[1:49:41] spiritual revelation of Christ be
[1:49:45] [Music]
[1:49:48] that's what it's against
[1:49:51] the gates of hell shall be against it
[1:49:54] but it shall never prevail
[1:49:59] there you are spiritual discernment
[1:50:02] regardless of who it is is my brother as
[1:50:05] long as he's trying to achieve the same
[1:50:06] purpose that I'm working for let it be
[1:50:08] profit let it be pasture let it be
[1:50:10] deacon let it be so and so let God honor
[1:50:13] in this way that way whatever it is this
[1:50:14] army whatever he wants to do but yet
[1:50:16] that's my brother
[1:50:18] we're working for the same thing we're
[1:50:21] standing ark all of our works into the
[1:50:23] same kingdom yonder he's working for the
[1:50:25] same thing I am spiritual discernment
[1:50:27] spiritual revelation of God lookie here
[1:50:31] if you want Jesus I've preached the
[1:50:33] other night somewhere baby down there it
[1:50:36] wasn't so from the beginning we have to
[1:50:38] go back to the beginning to find our
[1:50:40] text now for just a moment at the
[1:50:42] beginning that was keen intellectual
[1:50:44] build a fine church we would say made a
[1:50:48] fine altar offered up a sacrifice prayed
[1:50:51] sincere gave thanks paid his ties
[1:50:54] everything just as religious is able us
[1:50:57] but Abel there was no Bible in their
[1:51:01] days but my spiritual revelation he's
[1:51:04] seen that it wasn't fruits of the field
[1:51:06] that caused us to sin it wasn't apples
[1:51:10] that to eat
[1:51:11] see it wasn't apples revelation totally
[1:51:15] net and it wasn't the fruits that caused
[1:51:18] him to come out of there it was life the
[1:51:21] separation of life so he went and got a
[1:51:23] lamb and offered it in his stead by
[1:51:25] faith which this spiritual revelation
[1:51:31] the revelation of God spiritual
[1:51:34] revelation it was revealed to him it is
[1:51:36] in the fruit it is Annapolis it isn't
[1:51:39] peaches plums and pears it was a
[1:51:41] separation of life so he went to God
[1:51:44] alive and offered it instead of fruits
[1:51:46] fruits is what your works on your own
[1:51:49] hand what you do that I'll go and fill
[1:51:51] this I'll go do this I'll support that
[1:51:53] it's good he had an all reduced the same
[1:51:55] as the other did both of them had always
[1:51:56] that was good but it was a real
[1:51:58] spiritual reveal truth of the thing for
[1:52:01] the Spirit of God revealed it Nepal that
[1:52:04] rock the rock that Christ died on the
[1:52:06] rock of ages' upon the rock that Abel's
[1:52:09] lamp I don't
[1:52:11] little Abel as he put his hands upon
[1:52:14] that little lamb and it's a little white
[1:52:16] wool being bathed as he took a rock they
[1:52:19] didn't have a lance in that day and
[1:52:20] chopped this little neck like gotten
[1:52:22] hammered it in the poor little thang
[1:52:24] dying the blood bathing his hands and
[1:52:26] his little wool old baby was bloody
[1:52:28] Laden he crying what did his speak oh
[1:52:31] the Lamb of God some four thousand years
[1:52:34] later spiritually revealed the church
[1:52:36] turning him down one of the people call
[1:52:38] him Beelzebub and a devil because all
[1:52:41] the prophets have spoke out they denied
[1:52:43] the prophets always said you build their
[1:52:46] sufferers and you put them in there you
[1:52:48] wanted walls he said to them without
[1:52:50] spiritual discernment not knowing that
[1:52:52] that was the Lamb of God that he was
[1:52:54] supposed to be that way and act that way
[1:52:55] because he was fulfilling the Word of
[1:52:57] God and the Holy Ghost church today
[1:52:59] acting the way that you doing the things
[1:53:01] they knew they're fulfilling the world
[1:53:04] see Peter said on the day of Pentecost
[1:53:07] this is that

[1:56:43] God and the glory of is coming to reveal
[1:56:46] and make knowing his soon appearing now
[1:56:49] in closing we want to think of this I've
[1:56:52] owned this rock I'll build my church
[1:56:54] correctly and then we find out over in
[1:56:56] John 14 seven he said this the works

[1:57:03] that I do what kind of works did he do
[1:57:05] to make yourself known you remember
[1:57:07] about Peter don't you what we've been
[1:57:09] talking about Philip the woman at the
[1:57:10] well predicted it not to go to the
[1:57:13] Gentiles but would be in the last days
[1:57:14] as I said is it one of the days of Sodom
[1:57:16] so shall it be in the coming of the Son
[1:57:17] of man there's a revelation written in
[1:57:20] mysteries like this to the outside world
[1:57:22] to the world it knows about but you
[1:57:24] precious brethren you precious sisters

[1:57:31] you're children of the light
[1:57:33] walking in the light as he is in the
[1:57:36] light then we have fellowship one with
[1:57:38] another while the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:57:39] God's Son cleanses all our sins from all
[1:57:42] of us there you are the servants of the
[1:57:46] Lord Jesus is a quote with scripture on
[1:57:48] here got mark 16 yes mark 16 he said go

[1:58:06] spiritual desert he that believeth and
[1:58:07] is baptized you never exactly say which
[1:58:10] way

[1:58:15] other thing say he that believeth and is
[1:58:17] baptized shall be saved
[1:58:19] whatever he wants to be baptized that's
[1:58:21] up to him if his achievements for the
[1:58:23] kingdom of God come on brother we're
[1:58:25] marching on with the same spirit if I'm
[1:58:27] wrong then you tell it'll come out that
[1:58:29] way if you're wrong gonna be that but
[1:58:31] our hearts and our motives and our
[1:58:33] objectives is for the kingdom of God you
[1:58:34] honor the honor we are we're apart into
[1:58:36] Calvary me and my ideas why I got a
[1:58:40] brother likes cherry pie as well as I do
[1:58:42] but we're brothers see none of nice to
[1:58:45] hunt and fish like I do but we're

[1:58:49] ideas but that don't make him not my
[1:58:51] brother his father's my father his
[1:58:53] families my family there you are the
[1:58:56] patriarchs all different one from
[1:58:58] another but there was one father and
[1:59:00] this should work to one thing and they
[1:59:02] rejected the main one in there because
[1:59:04] he was spiritual don't you see it
[1:59:06] brethren can't you see what I'm speaking
[1:59:08] of now notice we're closing go into all

[1:59:30] speak with new tongues if they take up
[1:59:31] serpents or drink deadly things that
[1:59:32] shall not harm them if they lay their
[1:59:34] hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:59:35] that was what the new church was that's
[1:59:38] the kind of Church of Jesus Christ this
[1:59:40] great one and all the prophets cried out
[1:59:42] what do we find his spirit comes over
[1:59:44] here and predicted his spirit and the
[1:59:46] people come right back and do the things
[1:59:47] that he did
[1:59:48] Mayock clothes wasn't saying this I got
[1:59:50] about a dozen more scriptures here but
[1:59:52] we haven't got the time the but listen
[1:59:54] to this may I close and saying this ever
[1:59:56] true barn again prophet of the Lord
[1:59:59] preacher Sunday school teacher seer
[2:00:02] apostle missionary whatever he might be
[2:00:06] his whole heart is set and he's so
[2:00:09] filled and anointed with the Spirit of
[2:00:11] God so anointed whatever his office is
[2:00:15] whatever it might be to preach are to
[2:00:17] teach are to analyze our to see visions

[2:00:22] kingdom of God and the Spirit of God
[2:00:24] will speak right back to the man and
[2:00:25] manifest it's the kingdom of God then we

[2:00:34] Baptist Church I did that's what we
[2:00:37] church ever did blown too as a Baptist
[2:00:38] Church but they don't stand in my way I
[2:00:40] see what the Spirit of God is with you
[2:00:43] I'll see what you're trying to do well
[2:00:45] if me a Baptist can feel that way surely
[2:00:47] the families the Church of God the
[2:00:52] United Pentecostals the independence and
[2:00:54] all of us brethren together ought to see
[2:00:56] that we're trying to work for one
[2:00:58] purpose let's have spiritual discernment
[2:01:00] now listen and closing I'll make this
[2:01:03] last remark many are sick and weakly
[2:01:06] among you and many are asleep
[2:01:09] spiritually dead because they don't have
[2:01:11] discernment of the body of Christ this
[2:01:15] sick body that we got god help us to
[2:01:19] have spiritual discernment of that
[2:01:21] revelation of the kingdom of God and now
[2:01:24] the love of God in our hearts shed
[2:01:25] abroad by the Holy Ghost to try to put
[2:01:27] our arms way out say we are brother so
[2:01:30] you ought to mean and every little gift
[2:01:32] that you have don't use it to try to
[2:01:34] make it some great something for
[2:01:36] ourselves
[2:01:37] let's make it for the kingdom of God to
[2:01:39] work with everyone to try to uplift the
[2:01:42] cause of Jesus Christ for his coming is
[2:01:44] soon do you believe it
[2:01:46] I'm so sorry to keep you so long brother
[2:01:49] David will be here tomorrow to teach you
[2:01:52] the scriptures but right now let's bow
[2:01:54] our heads just a moment
[2:01:57] [Music]
[2:02:00] Liyana of the cheetah Bay Area we are
[2:02:04] not a political movement is the Bootsy
[2:02:06] Collins booyah
[2:02:13] [Music]
[2:02:31] [Music]
[2:02:43] onward Christian
[2:02:46] soldier
[2:02:57] hey man
[2:03:00] as I said there was something there for
[2:03:03] every one of us
[2:03:05] because if there's anything that we need
[2:03:09] is the discernment of spirits
[2:03:13] because there are so many spirits that
[2:03:16] have gone forth into the world amen
[2:03:20] Satan has come down with great wrath
[2:03:22] knowing his time is short and with Satan
[2:03:26] comes many of his angels a man and
[2:03:30] remember that there's there's thousands
[2:03:32] of thousands of thousands that are
[2:03:34] loosed out of the bottomless pit are
[2:03:36] loosed out of their deliverer rather
[2:03:38] it's mentioned there in the book of
[2:03:40] Revelation that's why we're seeing what
[2:03:43] we're seeing we're seeing less of God
[2:03:45] when it comes to the anointing and the
[2:03:48] gifts of the Spirit what God has done
[2:03:49] down to the church ages and what God has
[2:03:52] done down to the last six thousand years
[2:03:54] we're seeing less and less of that and
[2:03:56] we sense less and less of that we feel
[2:03:58] less and less of it but we are seeing
[2:04:01] and feeling more and more of the evil
[2:04:04] spirits a man it's and it's not light
[2:04:07] its darkness amen that's why as whyever
[2:04:11] the darkness is covering the earth
[2:04:13] darkness is overcoming and taking
[2:04:16] control because because Satan has come
[2:04:19] down with great wrath but the grace of
[2:04:21] God is there just for the elect that is
[2:04:25] and it's very very few it's not as the
[2:04:28] prophet of God as prophesied after the
[2:04:31] opening of the word as he saw people
[2:04:34] getting less and less spiritual and more
[2:04:37] and more religious but not spiritual and
[2:04:40] he began to highlight the fact that he
[2:04:43] said there's gonna be very very few
[2:04:45] living Saints going the rapture I
[2:04:47] believe that as it was in the days of
[2:04:50] Noah well we say Noah and was just Noah
[2:04:54] and it's his family they were eight that
[2:04:58] went into the ark out of maybe eight
[2:05:01] million and but we can go back before
[2:05:04] Noah and there was Enoch that went into
[2:05:06] rapture a man Noah went in an ark but he
[2:05:11] not when interruption so he was just one
[2:05:14] but he knew what was coming concerning
[2:05:17] it - that's you and me I trust that we
[2:05:20] are we are it represented an Enoch but
[2:05:24] we are pointing to the days of Noah a
[2:05:27] man where there's a Great Tribulation
[2:05:29] coming and brother that's what it was
[2:05:32] when God when God did what he did upon
[2:05:34] the earth and he covered the earth with
[2:05:36] water a mad and just think that ever
[2:05:40] everything was was killed everything was
[2:05:43] drowned everything was lost except Noah
[2:05:46] and those that were in the ark that's
[2:05:48] the truth and even even after the flood
[2:05:51] there was
[2:05:53] remember serpent seed didn't come
[2:05:56] through the ark did comes through the
[2:05:58] flood India and there was a member of
[2:06:01] David's family that God cursed and God
[2:06:05] separated and and cast them away and so
[2:06:08] on so that was for that spirit would
[2:06:10] come right on down through the hour that
[2:06:12] you and I are living so there's more
[2:06:14] serpents eat and there's very little
[2:06:16] seed of God in the earth and as the
[2:06:20] problem of God as highlighted he said
[2:06:21] there might be a thousand it might be
[2:06:23] seven hundred there might be five
[2:06:24] hundred and he said there might be three
[2:06:27] hundred and as that sister told him
[2:06:29] about you know how many is going in the
[2:06:30] rapture he said well if God told me to
[2:06:33] go and pick out as this this and this
[2:06:36] for the rapture he said he said he feel
[2:06:38] bad because he's a he said I don't yeah
[2:06:40] I might might find a dozen
[2:06:43] because he was seeing less the people
[2:06:45] were less and less and less spiritual
[2:06:48] they had didn't never had only ghost
[2:06:52] discernment a man to discern what was
[2:06:55] right to discern what was wrong no no no
[2:06:58] my brother's sister we got to have that
[2:07:00] we got to have spiritual discernment
[2:07:02] not just it when it comes to the word
[2:07:04] the truth they said oh my
[2:07:08] Satan Satan is going Satan is preaching
[2:07:10] the truth saving it will give it to you
[2:07:13] 99% of it or as I said a hundred and ten
[2:07:16] percent Allah or five percent he'll add
[2:07:18] to it or you take away a word or add a
[2:07:21] word a man but as how deceiving the
[2:07:24] world is right now religiously and as
[2:07:26] and has gotten that way even around the
[2:07:28] message so I see as time goes on and I
[2:07:31] see the world getting darker and darker
[2:07:33] and darker I see Satan taking more and
[2:07:36] more more more control and he's got more
[2:07:38] and more influence upon the people and
[2:07:40] his spirits and all the spirits that
[2:07:43] have been loosed out of the head of the
[2:07:44] waters is there in the book of
[2:07:46] Revelation a man so the grace of God
[2:07:49] that he has he's got a rapture for is
[2:07:53] see just an editor who only gonna be a
[2:07:55] few but he'll rapture us before before
[2:07:58] the whole world comes under Satan's
[2:08:00] control a man so we're looking for the
[2:08:03] grace of God in it it's just it's
[2:08:05] serious
[2:08:06] but the thing of it is believers think
[2:08:09] I'm a believer so I'm gonna in rapture
[2:08:11] you got it you got it you got to be
[2:08:13] determined that make your calling and
[2:08:15] election sure by the grace of God a
[2:08:18] man
[2:08:20] and now I I didn't go through this
[2:08:23] message before I played it
[2:08:25] today I I bet I don't know I guess it
[2:08:29] was the Holy Spirit that caused me to
[2:08:32] just to I I had some message there I
[2:08:34] took looked at that one I took that one
[2:08:36] and I put it in my briefcase not knowing
[2:08:41] exactly what I was going to do with it I
[2:08:42] maybe just just quote from it but this
[2:08:45] as I got into the office here at the
[2:08:47] Lord laid on my heart to play the tape
[2:08:50] now I know why after hearing it again
[2:08:54] now I know why a man's because as I said
[2:08:57] we did play it before but there was
[2:09:00] something there for every one of us and
[2:09:03] if you got a if you've got a copy of it
[2:09:05] verbally go listen to it again if you
[2:09:08] got a copy of it in in a book form go to
[2:09:11] read it here or on the internet whatever
[2:09:14] and and see what God wants to reveal to
[2:09:19] you in this message on discernment of
[2:09:21] Spirit because if there's anything we
[2:09:24] need in this day an hour is a
[2:09:27] discernment of spirit what spirit is
[2:09:30] influencing me why spirit is influencing
[2:09:33] you what and the thing of it is not just
[2:09:37] influenced what spirit is controlling
[2:09:38] you
[2:09:40] is controlling me and many people think
[2:09:43] oh I'm under the Spirit of God and
[2:09:45] they're under the spear of the devil a
[2:09:46] man that's the truth you're lying again
[2:09:49] it's it's so close they could deceive
[2:09:52] the very elect if possible you go right
[2:09:54] back to to Genesis Adam and Eve you go
[2:09:58] right back to Genesis and Cain and Abel
[2:10:01] amen brother sister just just see the
[2:10:05] deception god help us brother god help
[2:10:08] us make sure that you got the right
[2:10:11] anointing on you that's influencing you
[2:10:14] to do this or do that or say this or say
[2:10:17] that you don't make sure it's make sure
[2:10:19] it's Christ in you the hope of glory a
[2:10:22] man not Satan and you remember again
[2:10:26] it's just there's
[2:10:28] there's only just one word if you if you
[2:10:33] turn aside from one word you turn aside
[2:10:35] from God and you bring the judgment of
[2:10:38] God upon you you man what you do you
[2:10:41] better have the Holy Ghost
[2:10:43] leadership Holy Ghost discernment you've
[2:10:45] got to do it for God and for the glory
[2:10:47] of God be led by the spirit sons and
[2:10:51] daughters of God are led by the Spirit
[2:10:53] of God
[2:10:54] but if you're not a son and daughter of
[2:10:57] God then you're led by the spirit the
[2:10:59] devil
[2:11:00] it's serious God help our young people
[2:11:04] got out bar or us older ones and so on
[2:11:09] and then all you brothers as hitches in
[2:11:11] between please let's be spiritual think
[2:11:15] spiritual experience or live spiritual
[2:11:18] walk spiritual amen be constantly
[2:11:21] conscious
[2:11:22] of
[2:11:24] who you are as a son and daughter of God
[2:11:28] of course if you are son dollar God you
[2:11:32] will be conscious you'll be very calm
[2:11:34] you'd be very conscious of
[2:11:36] God's will not my real father don't be
[2:11:40] done all brother that takes death to you
[2:11:45] to yourself a man and Jesus was facing
[2:11:49] death but before he experienced that
[2:11:52] death and laid down his neck for life on
[2:11:55] the cross it gets 70
[2:11:59] he died
[2:12:01] yeah oh no knows how the cross in
[2:12:04] Jerusalem no no he died and get 70
[2:12:08] why he died to thee knowing knowing what
[2:12:11] he was going to experience in the flesh
[2:12:12] he was God but still he was going to he
[2:12:16] was going to bear all of our sin he was
[2:12:18] gonna pay the price for all of us you
[2:12:21] and me you know the sins of the old
[2:12:23] world he was gonna pay the price for a
[2:12:26] man and he was sinless but he was
[2:12:29] tempted in all points like as we are
[2:12:33] what all we think he just he was just
[2:12:36] perfect he came and he did this did that
[2:12:38] he was God right
[2:12:41] right but he wanted to experience what
[2:12:43] you and I experienced he was one to
[2:12:46] experience what they--what what his sons
[2:12:47] and daughters experienced all down
[2:12:49] through all the ages hey man took four
[2:12:53] four thousand years and the two thousand
[2:12:55] years ahead of them oh yeah what what
[2:12:58] the sits does the seed of garbling
[2:13:00] experience in the church ages right on
[2:13:02] down to it to the Great Tribulation you
[2:13:04] using one experience at all
[2:13:06] tempted in all points
[2:13:10] yet without seeing and it came to get
[2:13:13] some money and knowing what he was going
[2:13:15] to suffer in the flesh be beaten a
[2:13:20] man and he would shed his blood not only
[2:13:24] by the soldier piercing him on the cross
[2:13:29] but he would be beaten and whipped til
[2:13:33] his blood would be shed now he that He
[2:13:36] shed his blood and gets M&E that's where
[2:13:38] it started his shed as it worked great
[2:13:41] he sweaters were great drops of blood
[2:13:43] his sweat oh
[2:13:47] what what a burden he was buried oh
[2:13:52] brother how did you do you feel that way
[2:13:54] sometimes I do many times oh yeah he was
[2:13:59] bearing the burden and the ministry
[2:14:02] ought to be bearing the burden the bride
[2:14:04] is bearing a burden because of the hour
[2:14:06] were living it
[2:14:07] this is not just when I live in a new
[2:14:09] Thursday wesley's day or the pentecostal
[2:14:12] day we're living in two bright bride age
[2:14:14] and brother there's less and less of the
[2:14:16] of the anointing now because there
[2:14:18] because the number of people that got
[2:14:20] the money is getting fewer and fewer
[2:14:22] fewer whereas ice as I said before one
[2:14:25] time the anointing in the atmosphere
[2:14:26] there in the world was different but now
[2:14:28] it's not it's different all right but
[2:14:31] it's not the Spirit of God it's not the
[2:14:33] anointing of God it's the anointing of
[2:14:35] spirit of the devil that is that's the
[2:14:37] truth because one time you you take
[2:14:39] Sundays and any even sinners you
[2:14:42] respected you our Sundays and even
[2:14:44] sinners respect his son these sinners
[2:14:46] wouldn't do this on Sundays or wouldn't
[2:14:48] do that unless they were something like
[2:14:49] a Roman Catholic because if we went
[2:14:51] around anywhere on a Sunday and we saw
[2:14:54] somebody doing this and doing that we
[2:14:56] was at all their Catholic you know I
[2:14:58] guess because because if they were any
[2:15:01] Lincoln's are methods United Salvation
[2:15:03] Army they would they wouldn't do
[2:15:05] anything even knowing if there weren't
[2:15:06] Christians they were so one one of this
[2:15:09] is Sunday so they wouldn't do it David
[2:15:12] dude it would rest for sure even though
[2:15:14] they didn't go to church but but then I
[2:15:17] I wish I would see people going to
[2:15:19] church you know and again look out the
[2:15:21] window see them walking to church and
[2:15:24] for years that I I walk to church and so
[2:15:27] on so but it was different and you go
[2:15:31] outside the atmosphere was different
[2:15:33] there was a greater light there is a
[2:15:35] greater anointing in the atmosphere and
[2:15:37] it was God because God was there was
[2:15:40] more and more saints there's more and
[2:15:41] more seat sons and daughters of God
[2:15:43] they're a man and you go to church you
[2:15:46] get your mind you open the door
[2:15:49] there was no loud noise no loud talking
[2:15:52] or passion brother
[2:15:55] sister
[2:15:57] just a whisper why because it was it was
[2:16:02] receding there not just that this is a
[2:16:04] church yeah and it shouldn't do this
[2:16:06] shouldn't do that it's just that the
[2:16:07] anointing influenced them not to do it
[2:16:10] it was just so it was just it was just
[2:16:12] so so natural you get into that church
[2:16:15] you sit down and and you and you
[2:16:17] wouldn't say anything you wouldn't do
[2:16:18] anything you just pray you know and
[2:16:20] we're of the Lord but now even churches
[2:16:24] are cold
[2:16:25] the atmosphere in the church is cold not
[2:16:28] like it used to be no no not by any why
[2:16:31] because the number of people with the
[2:16:33] anointing is fewer pure pure pure
[2:16:37] Amen Strait is the gate narrows the way
[2:16:40] and few there be that find it
[2:16:44] so grace of God to us and
[2:16:47] for those who experience that back in
[2:16:51] that day even when we first came when I
[2:16:54] first came to the message oh it's not
[2:16:56] like that now I
[2:17:00] prayed crying Kali Oh Don the Lord
[2:17:04] nor if you don't come soon there won't
[2:17:07] be no flesh Saint oh
[2:17:10] I don't want to be saved I hope so
[2:17:15] obregón in the rapture by the grace of
[2:17:17] God but I
[2:17:20] trust you realize that you've got to
[2:17:23] make your calling and your election sure
[2:17:27] gotta respond to
[2:17:30] - to what you're doing to make your
[2:17:33] calling and election sure God look down
[2:17:35] and see that you're serious a man you're
[2:17:38] sincere
[2:17:40] God's looking for anything is sincerity
[2:17:44] so God helped us to discern spirits
[2:17:48] because there's there's moral - spirit
[2:17:50] the devil around everywhere then then
[2:17:53] the Spirit of God
[2:17:55] Amen why because God is pulling away
[2:17:58] pulling away pulling away and Satan is
[2:18:01] taking control control control a man the
[2:18:05] grace of God
[2:18:07] I
[2:18:10] was struck by this here it's a
[2:18:13] tremendous
[2:18:15] responsibility on the ministry
[2:18:18] and again the tremendous responsibility
[2:18:21] to those under the ministry I did
[2:18:24] mention in the last service that this is
[2:18:28] a judgement seat
[2:18:29] but not I wasn't thinking about this
[2:18:32] quote where the prophet of God said the
[2:18:35] word going over the pulpit is easy to
[2:18:37] judging you and it is amazing
[2:18:41] yeah the judgment see and then he said
[2:18:45] right here and and it struck me when I
[2:18:47] ordered a guy I did I light it some time
[2:18:49] ago but I struck me when it when I heard
[2:18:52] the Prophet mention it again this
[2:18:54] morning he said knowing surely that in
[2:18:57] the day of judgment we will be brought
[2:18:59] face to face with this generation and be
[2:19:03] ministers we will be judges
[2:19:08] and the people to which we have spoken
[2:19:12] and their attitude towards the word that
[2:19:16] we bring them will determine their
[2:19:18] eternal destination
[2:19:22] amen
[2:19:24] it's unfortunate that most don't realize
[2:19:27] that
[2:19:28] well it's just me it's up to me
[2:19:31] no no
[2:19:33] no oh
[2:19:36] God have mercy on us
[2:19:41] Easter day will determine their eternal
[2:19:43] destination
[2:19:45] therefore Lord in that day we would be a
[2:19:47] judge or against the generation that we
[2:19:50] preach to
[2:19:51] father God please through Jesus name let
[2:19:55] us not say one word that would be wrong
[2:19:57] but may we have sincere hearts and open
[2:20:01] mind that we might receive the things
[2:20:04] that's yours that we might be able to go
[2:20:07] out into our different fields of work
[2:20:09] and be better equipped because of our
[2:20:13] meeting with you this morning and
[2:20:15] he said Lord
[2:20:18] that we might be so filled with and
[2:20:21] charged with thy spirit of your presence
[2:20:25] here that the room would become the room
[2:20:28] not so much the building that we are
[2:20:30] sitting in but the building that we are
[2:20:32] living in they come all together a cloud
[2:20:34] of the glory of God in the life that
[2:20:37] you're living in this body by the grace
[2:20:40] of God amen so god help us brother see
[2:20:44] he we don't realize how serious it is
[2:20:47] they just don't realize it
[2:20:53] he said I think it's a good thing for us
[2:20:57] as ministers to follow our order when we
[2:21:01] see such things in the world as we see
[2:21:02] today and we have an order from God it's
[2:21:06] for the discerning of spirit trying the
[2:21:10] spirit I believe that and that is a very
[2:21:13] great lesson for the church today is to
[2:21:16] try the spirit of anything have
[2:21:19] discernment of the Spirit I do not think
[2:21:23] that we should ever by any means ever
[2:21:25] try to judge a person by denomination
[2:21:27] well I've been preaching that for over
[2:21:30] 50 years because a lot of Labor's have
[2:21:33] been condemning people because they go
[2:21:35] to a denomination and as I said
[2:21:39] 50 years ago
[2:21:41] or 51 years ago I preached to a big
[2:21:45] church full of believers I said you
[2:21:48] better stop that I assess you but for
[2:21:51] the grace of God
[2:21:52] so I stole condemn them that's where you
[2:21:56] were God brought you over this pray God
[2:21:59] bring them out and so on and like I told
[2:22:02] you after I finished preaching God
[2:22:04] confirmed it when her brother student
[2:22:06] spoke in tongues and then another
[2:22:08] brother stood and interpreted and
[2:22:11] warned the people that there wasn't me
[2:22:14] they heard it was God
[2:22:17] it wasn't my words it was the Word of
[2:22:20] God warning the people because of their
[2:22:22] spirit and attitude
[2:22:24] see God judges your spirit oh
[2:22:28] yeah oh well no I I believe the word but
[2:22:31] if you believe the word to let the
[2:22:32] spirit of the word
[2:22:34] so that's what God's judging
[2:22:36] yeah it determines whether or not you
[2:22:40] really believe the Lord
[2:22:41] amen so brother discernment of spirit
[2:22:45] well this is what we need yeah some have
[2:22:50] a greater greater anointing and of the
[2:22:54] gift deserting spirits oh yeah just
[2:22:57] sometimes you could say something to
[2:22:59] other times you can
[2:23:00] you just hold your peace and go on by
[2:23:03] the grace of God oh yeah
[2:23:06] so goddess goddess blessing with that
[2:23:09] down through the years many times and I
[2:23:11] thank the Lord for that he's big grace
[2:23:15] so he said
[2:23:18] you don't judge him because he go to a
[2:23:21] church or denomination
[2:23:22] and so on
[2:23:25] it says I do not think that we should
[2:23:29] ever by any means try to judge a person
[2:23:31] by the denomination that belonged to or
[2:23:33] the group that they are assembled with
[2:23:35] whether they be Methodist Baptist but
[2:23:38] Presbyterian or Pentecostal or whatever
[2:23:40] as says we should never judge the man by
[2:23:43] the denomination we should we should
[2:23:45] always judge him by the Spirit that he
[2:23:47] has
[2:23:49] all right because you can have the word
[2:23:51] is still a wrong spirit on you oh
[2:23:54] yeah you can have the word the message
[2:23:57] and still haven't still ever wrong
[2:23:58] anointing on you yeah wrong motives
[2:24:02] wrong objectives yeah
[2:24:04] because you could be right in line with
[2:24:07] with the mechanics but not the dynamics
[2:24:12] Amen that the letter of the word
[2:24:14] doctrinally had creep decreed but not by
[2:24:18] the Holy Ghost living the word I would
[2:24:20] in you and through you as he did in
[2:24:23] Christ
[2:24:25] amen
[2:24:27] he said we should never judge a man by
[2:24:30] the denomination he belongs to we should
[2:24:32] always judge him by the spirit he has
[2:24:34] and that's true like I said you go and
[2:24:38] greet a brother sister and you you
[2:24:40] desert their spirit oh yeah definitely
[2:24:45] amen
[2:24:49] he's like one time we had a stranger
[2:24:51] come in
[2:24:53] and I preached
[2:24:56] and I said Lord I said
[2:24:59] he's not a believer
[2:25:01] but I said easily I said he's respecting
[2:25:05] the word and I said he's catching the
[2:25:07] revelation I
[2:25:08] sensed that Lord
[2:25:11] and after the service I shook hands with
[2:25:14] him and he said all we said that was
[2:25:16] wonderful he said I've never heard that
[2:25:18] before but he said it was the truth he
[2:25:22] said you're right oh I said good I said
[2:25:26] I I felt I said you were receiving it a
[2:25:28] man and we had a sister here and I now
[2:25:33] love you maybe a few months ago and she
[2:25:35] come in here and here she was she had
[2:25:37] her hair bobbed up she had shorts a
[2:25:40] slacks on and she was dressed just
[2:25:43] dressed worldly but professing to be a
[2:25:45] Christian brother you talk about
[2:25:47] somebody where the right spirit should
[2:25:49] judge a lot of believers she rises and
[2:25:51] gentleman he's a lot of believers but
[2:25:53] she come in here sent here and as 1st or
[2:25:55] 2nd seat there and well oh I see Lorna
[2:25:58] she's got a nice spirit
[2:26:00] why because she was worshiping she was
[2:26:03] praising the Lord she was responding to
[2:26:04] the word and all and she she was from
[2:26:09] Ontario and she's told us after that she
[2:26:11] felt in my spirit ear now there was a
[2:26:13] lot of women would come in here and to
[2:26:15] see you other sisters the way you're
[2:26:16] dressed and everything else they would
[2:26:18] feel uncomfortable and maybe someone
[2:26:20] would eventually get up and lead glow
[2:26:22] but she wouldn't do that she felt the
[2:26:25] presence of God here and she and that's
[2:26:26] what she wanted a man and as she saw it
[2:26:30] was wonderful she said and she was going
[2:26:32] to recommend to her grandchildren that's
[2:26:35] here somewhere that if they go to church
[2:26:38] they should come here a man god bless
[2:26:41] her god bless her for that her brother's
[2:26:44] sister their spirit was right not that
[2:26:47] she's bride but again also got to
[2:26:50] remember there there there there's many
[2:26:53] are called few are chosen so they're
[2:26:55] just made it than all the ones this call
[2:26:57] does not lost
[2:26:58] no no they're going to be there outside
[2:27:00] the city but the bride's gonna be in the
[2:27:03] city the New Jerusalem with the king to
[2:27:06] sit with him and his strong by the grace
[2:27:08] of God a man so brother keep your spirit
[2:27:12] right your attitude right and if you got
[2:27:15] to keep your spirit right Natalie right
[2:27:17] towards those that are out there how
[2:27:18] much more does God look for it among the
[2:27:21] Saints among them believers
[2:27:23] have a right mode and a right objective
[2:27:26] all for the glory of God amen
[2:27:29] so he said whether he's a latter rain or
[2:27:33] former rain and he said whatever it
[2:27:37] might be we should never judge him but
[2:27:39] by his Spirit he said we are to discern
[2:27:44] spirit a man and there's the trouble
[2:27:47] that people got today is they don't have
[2:27:50] discernment grace of God
[2:27:53] brother any evidence or proof of the
[2:27:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[2:27:59] that you're born again you're born again
[2:28:02] brother you you'll have you'll have Holy
[2:28:05] Ghost deserving it's Christ in me it's
[2:28:08] Christ in in in you amen giving you
[2:28:12] discernment of what you should do say
[2:28:14] you know and how you should treat this
[2:28:16] one treat that one and so on amen grace
[2:28:19] of God
[2:28:21] amen just won't not be long just a
[2:28:26] couple of minutes he said there's so
[2:28:28] much in the day we are living in
[2:28:30] pertaining to gives and so many people
[2:28:32] judge people by a gift that they have I
[2:28:35] believe these things are gifts I believe
[2:28:38] that we see what we see take place his
[2:28:41] gift and they are god-given gifts but if
[2:28:45] we do not use them in the right way that
[2:28:48] God intended them to be used then we can
[2:28:51] do more armed than with the gifts that
[2:28:54] we could do if we did not have the gifts
[2:28:56] yet I have a right spirit in the right
[2:28:59] attitude right motive right objective
[2:29:02] amen because people do have a gift but
[2:29:06] they got a wrong motive objective and
[2:29:08] they do more harm with it than they do
[2:29:09] good
[2:29:11] yeah and they'll be judged for that
[2:29:16] Easter the other night I made a
[2:29:18] statement at the pulpit saying that I
[2:29:20] would rather see brotherly love existing
[2:29:22] among the church if I didn't have one
[2:29:25] case of healing or anything else we must
[2:29:27] know what these things are for
[2:29:30] amen by the grace of God
[2:29:38] he said if a person had a real gift of
[2:29:42] God and he's trying to edify the body of
[2:29:44] Christ I don't care what he belongs to
[2:29:46] he said you're not deserting the man
[2:29:49] you're discerning the spirit the life
[2:29:51] that is in the man
[2:29:53] and he said and that's what God told us
[2:29:56] to do not one time was we ever
[2:29:58] commissioned to desert a man's group a
[2:30:01] group but we are constrained and
[2:30:03] commanded by God to discern the spirit
[2:30:05] that is in the man what he's trying to
[2:30:07] do what spirit is in his life is trying
[2:30:10] to lead him to and then if we can find
[2:30:13] out that he's trying to lead the people
[2:30:15] not to break them up but to bring them
[2:30:17] together to bring them the Church of the
[2:30:19] Living God
[2:30:22] not all to one denomination but to an
[2:30:25] understanding fellowship and unity of
[2:30:29] the Spirit
[2:30:32] whatever it is if he is former or latter
[2:30:36] rained his spirit and his purpose is
[2:30:39] right and the spirit that's in him no
[2:30:42] matter what movie belongs to the spirit
[2:30:45] that's in him is trying to point the
[2:30:47] people to Calvary amen
[2:30:51] praise the Lord let
[2:30:53] me finish with this
[2:30:55] he said every man ought to have a church
[2:30:58] home that's true you ought to have a
[2:31:00] place not just a float about from pillar
[2:31:03] to post but as somewhere that you go to
[2:31:06] church and you call it your church
[2:31:08] somewhere you pay your tithe and some of
[2:31:10] you help support the cause take your
[2:31:13] choice but then don't never
[2:31:15] disfellowship the other man because he
[2:31:17] don't belong with your group there's
[2:31:19] earn his spirit and see if he's got the
[2:31:21] same purpose in heart then you got
[2:31:23] fellowship with one another you're
[2:31:26] working for one great cause that's the
[2:31:28] cause of Christ and if you will notice
[2:31:31] the motives and objectives of the Old
[2:31:34] Testament prophets he said they had one
[2:31:36] thing that their old theme of the Old
[2:31:38] Testament was built around they did not
[2:31:42] get out and do things just for money or
[2:31:44] fame they did it for the Spirit of God
[2:31:47] and the glory of God

[2:31:55] have anything
[2:31:57] let's make sure we got discernment of
[2:32:00] spirit because that's as one guess that
[2:32:03] we do need we can route we can believe
[2:32:05] now I understand this message was before
[2:32:08] the open of the seals and after the
[2:32:11] opening of the seals
[2:32:13] God was calling us to a greater and
[2:32:16] greater separation unto Him amen
[2:32:19] and God is looking for a greater and
[2:32:21] greater
[2:32:24] anointing of discernment Oh mine see it
[2:32:29] more and more the word that God gives
[2:32:31] you it's more and more of the spirit
[2:32:33] discernment is you got to discern you're
[2:32:36] gonna discern what is contrary to the
[2:32:38] work counter to the word or discern what
[2:32:40] is the word and so on by the grace of
[2:32:42] God what is the will of God
[2:32:46] Amen so whatever you do make sure it's
[2:32:49] the will of God
[2:32:52] you young people whatever you do make
[2:32:55] sure it's the will of God a man you know
[2:32:58] doing what you'd like to do or want to
[2:33:00] do you got to do what what God needs you
[2:33:03] to do again sons and daughters of God
[2:33:05] are led by the Spirit of God so the Lord
[2:33:08] bless you with a greater and greater the
[2:33:12] spirit of discernment for the glory of
[2:33:15] God amen and hey if you want to start
[2:33:19] discernment you start with yourself
[2:33:22] yeah mr. Zurn your your thoughts your
[2:33:26] your words your deeds your motives your
[2:33:29] objectives your attitude Amen your
[2:33:31] actions your reactions you deserve that

[2:33:39] aside from the leadership of the Holy
[2:33:41] Ghost you'll convict you oh
[2:33:43] you shouldn't say that you shouldn't act
[2:33:45] like that you shouldn't have that
[2:33:47] attitude you shouldn't have that spirit
[2:33:48] god help us
[2:33:50] the proof will go forth as sons and
[2:33:53] daughters of God that we are born again
[2:33:57] oh I could have preached on it because I
[2:34:00] brought notes against a few notes on
[2:34:02] again to finish the grace and I also
[2:34:05] bought some notes on being born again
[2:34:08] they made and if you're born again
[2:34:10] you're a new creature
[2:34:12] and little by little by little the more
[2:34:16] you get and mature as a son of God
[2:34:18] daughter of God the less and less the
[2:34:21] old nature controls you less and less
[2:34:25] and less and more and more the spirit
[2:34:28] God controls you amen the nature of God
[2:34:31] controls you amen grace the will of God
[2:34:34] controls you not my will father don't be

[2:34:53] on the discernment of spirits because
[2:34:57] again as we read in the scriptures we're
[2:35:01] living in an hour that's so deceiving
[2:35:03] there's so many deceiving spirits would
[2:35:06] deceive the very elect impossible that
[2:35:09] brother that's pretty close isn't that
[2:35:12] is pretty close how are we gonna discern
[2:35:14] by the grace of God we need to hold a
[2:35:17] ghost discernment I was gonna desert

[2:35:21] twins in the same church well I got a
[2:35:24] spirit of the Spirit of Christ is here
[2:35:25] but the spirit of the Antichrist is also
[2:35:27] here oh yeah what for to get you to add
[2:35:31] to what's being ministered or to take
[2:35:34] away from what's being ministered a man
[2:35:37] so we better we need we need that
[2:35:40] discernment so are we gonna deserve
[2:35:42] between this this the Spirit of God and
[2:35:46] the spirit the devil
[2:35:47] amen judge it by the word
[2:35:51] Amen because if it's God he's going to
[2:35:54] keep you alive with the word and if
[2:35:56] you're in line with the word not just
[2:35:58] not just mechanically but dynamics the
[2:36:02] Holy Ghost you know that you will have
