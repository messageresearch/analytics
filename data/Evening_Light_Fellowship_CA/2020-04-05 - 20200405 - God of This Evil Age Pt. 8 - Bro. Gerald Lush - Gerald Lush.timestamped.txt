[46:02] just to thank the Lord for His grace
[46:05] again a man it's amazing that we're
[46:08] having a service with only four or five
[46:11] that would remind me of the of the
[46:13] cottage means we had fifty years ago oh
[46:15] yes said brother burns and sister
[46:17] Burgess a man absolutely amazing
[46:23] absolutely amazing and because we did we
[46:27] were totally standing on the scriptures
[46:30] where Jesus said where two or three are
[46:32] gathered together by name there are my
[46:34] anthem it's a man what because we went
[46:38] to this house to that house with another
[46:40] house and he's just two or three maybe
[46:42] four or five that that was that was it
[46:44] and I remember ministering to college
[46:47] meetings preaching and college meetings
[46:49] but we're now we come back to that again
[46:52] so the grace of God be with us brother
[46:54] amen and the grace of God be with those
[46:57] that are at home and to realize to we
[47:00] think this is just it's going to be
[47:01] until this thing passes well they've got
[47:04] no cures for it and they're still
[47:07] fighting it so and and brother as long
[47:09] as that's going on then then we're going
[47:12] to be out of the church as it were most
[47:14] of the Saints will had to be left at
[47:16] home so brother or mine what an hour
[47:19] that God is requiring us to make our
[47:21] calling and our election sure a man in
[47:25] times like this and in days like this
[47:28] when these things are going on we better
[47:30] make sure that we're the elect of God
[47:32] amen and then what's going on brother
[47:35] it's not it's not just it's for us not
[47:37] for us it's for the world but for us in
[47:41] a sense and as I said there in the last
[47:43] service it is to get us to look up a man
[47:46] if God is that God is expecting anything
[47:48] of the obvious seed of the Bride of
[47:51] Christ it is to look up a man because a
[47:55] man you're gonna you're gonna recognize
[47:57] in a scripture be fulfilled for the last
[47:59] days you're gonna recognize
[48:01] scripture being fulfilled prior to the
[48:03] rapture and the resurrection look up
[48:05] amen
[48:06] so we better get closer and closer to
[48:08] the Lord by the grace of God and die
[48:11] more and more to ourselves and become
[48:13] more and more alive to him oh yes
[48:16] we gotta become more and more sensitive
[48:18] to his leadership and his presence well
[48:21] God have mercy on us is my prayer and
[48:23] maybe maybe the prophet saw this before
[48:26] the Lord took him home because he said
[48:28] there's things in his heart that he
[48:30] wouldn't be able to tell us a man the
[48:33] things that God revealed to him but he
[48:35] could not reveal it to us so he knew and
[48:38] no doubt for some of the things that he
[48:41] was preaching they were that was the
[48:43] reason is because of the of the Spirit
[48:45] that we will be dealing with because of
[48:47] it because of what will be going on and
[48:49] even in the message that we've been
[48:51] dealing with the god of this evil age
[48:53] amen the Prophet was recognizing the
[48:56] beginning of it then what would he see
[48:58] today a man he would certainly see Satan
[49:01] as the god of this evil age because more
[49:04] and more are under Satan's influence
[49:06] their thoughts their words their deeds
[49:09] is the influence of Satan oh yeah
[49:11] religious and yeah decay can be
[49:14] identified as all that's the message
[49:16] yeah but it is Satan's influence why
[49:20] just look at their thoughts and look at
[49:23] their words look at their deeds and see
[49:25] if it's the Holy Ghost or see if it's
[49:27] another spirit a man you go so far but
[49:30] not all the way hey man y'all got all
[49:33] God's grace to his brother and this hour
[49:36] why because again and again and again
[49:38] the Scriptures warns us that it's gonna
[49:42] be so deceiving it would deceive the
[49:44] very elect impossible jesus warned about
[49:46] it oh yeah I said this is going to
[49:48] happen that's going to happen buddy so I
[49:50] want to warn you he said there are
[49:52] things are going to happen it's going to
[49:53] be so deceiving if possible it would
[49:56] deceit the very life any man why because
[49:59] it's going to be so close to the truth
[50:00] it's going so close to what God has done
[50:02] and what God is doing a man that people
[50:06] think well that's gone no it's the devil
[50:08] amen
[50:09] because he knows as I've said before
[50:11] he's come down with faith he's come down
[50:14] with great
[50:15] right knowing knowing knowing this time
[50:18] is short what do we know a man so I pray
[50:21] the grace of God we know our time is
[50:23] short a man we're going to Eternity but
[50:26] at the same time we also know what the
[50:28] devil amen
[50:29] and we're not going to be deceived
[50:30] whether it's our thoughts or words or
[50:32] deeds we're not going to be influenced
[50:34] by the devil it's gonna be under the
[50:36] influence of the Holy Ghost amen the
[50:39] grace of God be with us
[50:40] turn with me to the Book of Isaiah
[50:43] chapter 14 and the grace of God be with
[50:47] sister John Whitten been many years
[50:50] since we have been in contact with her
[50:52] and her family so no doubt I've been
[50:57] thinking about it I said Lord I said
[50:59] what's going on now in the earth I said
[51:01] it's going to it's going to shake a lot
[51:04] of people that were believers a man oh
[51:08] yeah it is and and maybe they'll come
[51:11] back but maybe too late
[51:12] grant God's grace to us and again the
[51:16] power of God did say and it's in the
[51:18] message on I believe was the seven
[51:21] Church ages and as many years ago and he
[51:24] said listen he said we won't reach
[51:26] everyone with this message
[51:28] he said only the elect only the right of
[51:32] Christ the message is sent to call it
[51:34] the bride the message is sent to give
[51:36] the bride rapturing faith a man so the
[51:40] message is sent to give us the
[51:41] revelation of the invisible union of the
[51:44] heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[51:46] bright a man he has come down to get the
[51:49] right and to give her faith to go up
[51:52] amen by the grace of God
[51:54] so god help us is my prayer and also to
[51:59] keep in prayer
[52:00] concerning the Easter meetings if this
[52:03] thing is going on and on and on then
[52:05] still the church won't be able to get
[52:07] together for Easter meetings and also
[52:10] it's been on my heart concerning the
[52:12] communion so we'd almost have to just go
[52:16] from house to house to serve communion
[52:18] so we pray the grace of God be with us
[52:21] and help us see it's coming to that
[52:24] place where you won't be able to believe
[52:25] what you believe it yes what you won't
[52:28] be able to
[52:28] live what you what you're living what
[52:30] you're believing you don't want to be
[52:31] able to do this won't be able to do that
[52:33] because of what's going on in the world
[52:36] and it may man and again we're under the
[52:40] understanding that we're not allowed
[52:43] together now only for just 5 or less in
[52:46] a church and knowing that we just saw it
[52:49] on the on the internet there was a
[52:51] request that that we closed all
[52:53] buildings including including churches
[52:55] yeah oh yeah they want this close that
[53:00] close that close they want churches
[53:01] clothes a man well what are we going to
[53:05] do I guess we'd have to meet in what
[53:06] would others house again and they back
[53:08] we're back to two or three again and
[53:10] then they don't want you to do that
[53:12] no don't want you to do that so it's
[53:15] amazing so we pray the grace of God that
[53:18] will make our calling and election shore
[53:20] amen and if you're not able to get
[53:22] together with the Saints you just go and
[53:24] it in your Claire your prayer closet and
[53:27] shut the door and talk to the Lord amen
[53:30] the grace of God brother it's come down
[53:32] to that now it's you and your faith
[53:35] what is that's what God's looking for
[53:38] now God has permitted this for a reason
[53:40] he's permitted this you know to to to
[53:43] bring out the manifests the negative
[53:45] attitude and spirit of the world but
[53:48] also to bring out the positive attitude
[53:50] and spirit of the bright of the true
[53:53] seat of God by the grace of God so God
[53:56] help us is my prayer to make our calling
[53:58] and election sure to make sure you're in
[54:00] the word and make sure your with the
[54:02] word to make sure that your thoughts
[54:04] your words your deeds is under the
[54:06] influence of the Holy Ghost not the
[54:09] devil amen
[54:10] so brace brother it grace grace grace
[54:13] make your calling and your election sure
[54:16] amen stayed with the word make sure
[54:20] every day in thought word indeed you're
[54:23] lining up with the word more and more by
[54:26] the grace of God amen
[54:29] so I want to share with you I was hoping
[54:32] to be able to bring it to a conclusion
[54:33] regarding the thought on the god of this
[54:36] evil age will sail far the Lord will
[54:38] have us to go or allow us to go today
[54:41] Amen I'll try not to be too long but at
[54:43] the same time I want to get the word out
[54:45] the thus saith the Lord in in the word
[54:48] it is written and also the the spoken
[54:51] word by the Prophet so we'll see
[54:53] as the Lord leads us but I want to share
[54:56] these scriptures with you and there's a
[54:58] number of scriptures and we'll try to
[55:00] get through all the scriptures and then
[55:02] get into some thoughts to bring it to a
[55:05] conclusion on the god of this evil age
[55:07] if there's anything that any revelation
[55:10] that we need to know any revelation we
[55:12] need to understand is the god of this
[55:14] evil age a man oh there are those who
[55:18] feel well we don't need to know this we
[55:19] don't need to know that that's the devil
[55:21] yeah but we need to know it so that
[55:23] we're not going to be deceived by it we
[55:25] need to know it so that we will be there
[55:26] and that's we'll know whether it's God
[55:29] or whether it's Satan a man and yet to
[55:32] be on our guard
[55:33] because it's going to be so close to
[55:35] deceive the very elect if possible so
[55:37] brother sister let's pray the grace of
[55:39] God that we want me to seat well yet
[55:42] we'll say oh I believe the message the
[55:45] devil does too I believe this I believe
[55:48] that so does the devil brother did the
[55:50] devil believes the message sometimes
[55:52] more than a lot of believers believe it
[55:53] that's the absolute truth he knows this
[55:56] is the truth he knows this is thus saith
[55:58] the Lord this is written and so on
[56:00] brother he knew it in the Garden of Eden
[56:02] yes God said and he knows that today

[56:49] is Christ in us not the devil
[56:52] influencing us in our
[56:53] mine's in our spirits in our feelings

[56:58] revelation in our hearts and in our
[57:00] souls God remembered through your new

[57:06] he fought the devil it could we were
[57:08] born with that born in sin shaped in
[57:10] iniquity come to the world speaking lies

[57:41] what is what kind of a witness is God
[57:43] expecting you to have them and to give
[57:45] to the world a man we got to realize we
[57:48] can understand that there there's many
[57:50] of there because that's gonna lay down
[57:51] their lives as the foolish virgins but I
[57:53] pray God that we are wise virgins a man
[57:56] and we know what to do we know what God
[57:59] wants we know why God is expecting of us
[58:02] grace to us a man so grace to us here
[58:07] grace to the state's online a man and
[58:09] those in DVD land to God be the glory
[58:13] so I want to share with you these
[58:14] scriptures and pray the grace of God
[58:16] give us the revelation thereof that we
[58:19] need to be on our guard amen I just take
[58:22] it for granted but to put it by word
[58:25] have I hid in my heart that I might not
[58:28] sin against thee a may grace of God so
[58:32] that we'd be on our guard and not be
[58:34] deceived by the devil it was in your
[58:36] head evil to Seaview you add to it
[58:40] you'll take from it oh yeah but it's in
[58:43] your heart he want to see you a man
[58:46] because God has given us power in our
[58:48] souls over the world the flesh and the
[58:51] devil amen
[58:53] my victory is on the inside of the
[58:56] inside we are more than conquerors in
[58:58] our Lord Jesus Christ in in Isaiah
[59:01] chapter 14 and I've got five maybe six
[59:06] or seven scriptures
[59:07] who will see in as Isaiah chapter 14 he
[59:16] said in verse 1 for the Lord will have
[59:21] mercy on Jacob and will yet choose
[59:24] Israel and set them in their own land
[59:28] and the strangers shall be joined with
[59:32] them and they shall cleave to the house
[59:34] of Jacob and the people should take them
[59:37] and bring them to their place and the
[59:40] house of Israel shall possess them in
[59:42] the land of the Lord for servants and
[59:45] animates and they shall take them
[59:47] captives whose captives they were and
[59:51] they shall rule over their oppressors a
[59:54] man God giving us power over the world
[59:58] the flesh the devil but also eyeing the
[1:00:04] devil highlighting the God of this evil
[1:00:06] age warning us concerning who he is and
[1:00:10] what he is trying to do in you and
[1:00:13] through you
[1:00:14] what did was he trying to influence us I
[1:00:17] was he in trying to influence you
[1:00:20] brother sister don't don't just take it
[1:00:24] for granted and don't assume no I'm a
[1:00:26] Christian so when the devil is not going
[1:00:27] to do this he can't do that oh yes he
[1:00:29] can no matter what God has done all the
[1:00:32] way down through the age of saints were
[1:00:33] there to challenge it st. Anna there to
[1:00:36] get the people to doubt it
[1:00:37] Saints been there to get to add to it to
[1:00:39] take from it so brother it's no
[1:00:41] different than the day we still have to
[1:00:44] be on our guard
[1:00:45] God has called us out but brother sister
[1:00:48] the devil's there amen
[1:00:50] he's watching what God is doing brother
[1:00:53] when God came in flesh himself Saint was
[1:00:56] there to tempt him a male and if he was
[1:00:59] here to tempt Jesus he's there to tempt
[1:01:01] us so brother sister let's not fall to
[1:01:05] Satan's temptation he's there to tempt
[1:01:07] us again in our thoughts he's there to
[1:01:09] tempt us in our words or our deeds and
[1:01:11] again don't think well I didn't do this
[1:01:14] so I didn't do that what did you think
[1:01:15] something God's okay's your thoughts and
[1:01:17] it's in your heart
[1:01:19] amen God Luke
[1:01:21] in the heart God deals with it with us
[1:01:24] in our souls on the inside of the inside
[1:01:27] so brother sister I trust by the grace
[1:01:29] of God that were not under under and led
[1:01:32] by Saint thoughts or Satan's words or
[1:01:34] Satan's needs and his influence in it
[1:01:36] what he wants to do with us but we're
[1:01:39] under the influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:40] amen
[1:01:42] so that we have given ourselves totally
[1:01:44] over to the leadership of Christ amen
[1:01:47] so it's Christ in me the hope of glory
[1:01:50] not the devil's influence Jesus
[1:01:53] influence a man let's be on our guard
[1:01:55] began because why it's going to be close
[1:01:59] close they would deceive the very elect
[1:02:03] they met and again in verse three and it
[1:02:08] shall come to pass in the in the day
[1:02:10] that the Lord will give thee rest from
[1:02:13] thy sorrow and from thy fear and from
[1:02:15] the hard bondage wherein thou was made
[1:02:18] to serve that thou shall make up this
[1:02:21] proverb against the king of Babylon and
[1:02:23] say at the the oppressor ceased the
[1:02:27] Golden City sees the Lord has broken the
[1:02:31] staff of the wicked and the scepter of
[1:02:33] the rulers a man and it says he who
[1:02:37] smoked the got people in raft with a
[1:02:41] continual stroke he that ruled the
[1:02:43] nations in anger is persecuted and none
[1:02:47] endureth it says the whole earth is at
[1:02:50] rest and is quiet and they break forth
[1:02:53] into singing but he said yea the fir
[1:02:56] trees rejoice at thee and the Cedars of
[1:03:00] Lebanon saying since thou art laid down
[1:03:03] the feller has come up against us hell
[1:03:08] from beneath is move for the to meet
[1:03:11] thee yet by coming it stirs up the dead
[1:03:16] for thee a man even though God was doing
[1:03:19] this and God was going to bring down his
[1:03:21] blessings and his anointing that we're
[1:03:23] going to be challenged by the devil
[1:03:25] amen no matter what God has done when a
[1:03:28] god is doing her will
[1:03:30] you can be rest assured you're going to
[1:03:32] deal with Satan amen because from the
[1:03:35] beginning God dealt with the devil even
[1:03:40] before he created the heaven and the
[1:03:41] earth God dealt with Satan in heaven he
[1:03:44] walked up and down in the coals of fire
[1:03:46] and until iniquity was found in him
[1:03:49] pride a man so the grace of God brothers
[1:03:52] that we're not going to have what was
[1:03:54] sake was guilty elf we're not going to
[1:03:56] be guilty of a Maya so that he's not
[1:03:59] going to he's not going to put it into
[1:04:00] into your life or into our into our
[1:04:02] lives into our souls no we're praying
[1:04:05] the grace of God the token life of the
[1:04:07] blood of Jesus is there to keep the
[1:04:09] devil out a man and the enemy comes down
[1:04:12] in our thoughts you go to your spirit oh
[1:04:14] and you rebuke him amen because God is
[1:04:19] there - were to reveal to you this is
[1:04:21] not me
[1:04:21] that's Satan amen and Jesus had to deal
[1:04:25] with it even in Peter until Peter
[1:04:27] received the Holy Ghost and a funny man
[1:04:29] Peter at what oh my oh he was taking his
[1:04:32] stand for Jesus but it wasn't according
[1:04:34] to the word well you can take your stand
[1:04:36] for Jesus it's got to be according to
[1:04:38] the word for your date ain't my it and
[1:04:41] Jesus was taking our Peter was taking
[1:04:43] his stand and Jesus said I'm going to do
[1:04:45] this I got to do this and this is going
[1:04:47] to happen that's going to happen and
[1:04:49] Peter said no no no Lord no no no Lord
[1:04:51] no no you it's good to stop it don't go
[1:04:53] to Jerusalem don't do this don't do that
[1:04:55] and what did Jesus say get thee behind
[1:04:58] me Satan why because he knew the Satan
[1:05:01] was influencing Peter salts same was
[1:05:05] imposing Peters words and deeds a man
[1:05:08] and as I said before and our brother
[1:05:10] George bottled out you know you know let
[1:05:13] me repeat it now that here was Paul and
[1:05:16] he persecuted the Christians he killed
[1:05:18] Christians and yet God met him on the
[1:05:21] road a man anyway and ordained him
[1:05:24] because he was the messenger of the age
[1:05:26] what he was absolute may a mystery to
[1:05:30] the people in that first stage Paul
[1:05:32] Young so a certain of the disciples had
[1:05:35] to go and say listen you got to listen
[1:05:37] to Paul you gotta listen this yeah
[1:05:39] because they were questioning Paul
[1:05:40] they're wondering is he of God you know
[1:05:42] is
[1:05:43] God servant after all he's did to the
[1:05:45] believers the early church and so on but
[1:05:47] he was God's choice a man and look at
[1:05:50] Peter and as I said Jesus had more
[1:05:53] problems with Peter than he did Judas he
[1:05:55] had more problems with Peter than he did
[1:05:57] the other disciples we haven't as I said
[1:06:00] we got no record of God dealing with
[1:06:02] with Judas except that does at the Last
[1:06:05] Supper yeah and he told they're gonna do
[1:06:07] what he had to do it do it quickly
[1:06:09] yeah but he had to deal with Peter this
[1:06:12] mirror this mirror this spirit a man and
[1:06:15] a funny as they get there behind me
[1:06:16] Satan what a Peter feel I don't think
[1:06:21] Peter felt bad or he's like that or you
[1:06:23] might have felt bad but he didn't
[1:06:24] question Jesus a man because Jesus but
[1:06:27] Jesus knew it was a spirit on Peter a
[1:06:30] man and brother he could and God has
[1:06:32] been dealing with that all the way down
[1:06:34] through the ages
[1:06:35] because God has moved God has called
[1:06:37] them out but Satan is there tried to
[1:06:39] influence them amen and brother again
[1:06:42] it's after three years and practically
[1:06:44] every age after three years they went
[1:06:46] from the leadership of the Holy Ghost to
[1:06:48] the leadership of the devil that's right
[1:06:50] and we wanted to do they made an
[1:06:52] organization they made denominations
[1:06:54] they organized their churches they put
[1:06:57] themselves under the control of man and
[1:06:58] not the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:01] so the grace of God brother to with this
[1:07:04] understanding this revelation that all
[1:07:07] the way down through God has moved but
[1:07:09] then Satan comes behind and God allows
[1:07:11] it and God permits it a man and it's to
[1:07:14] breathe where God permits the negative
[1:07:16] what for it is to get us to sea serpents
[1:07:20] eat a man and gotten to bring a what
[1:07:23] bring out the positive in the seat of
[1:07:25] God amen
[1:07:26] it's bringing out the serpent seat is
[1:07:29] bringing out the negative but at the
[1:07:31] same time it's going to bring out the
[1:07:32] true seed of God the positive a man
[1:07:36] there are those who have a negative but
[1:07:38] there those have a positive they stay
[1:07:40] with the word they stay with the truth
[1:07:42] the whole truth nothing but the truth
[1:07:44] amen so brother sister after all these
[1:07:47] years are we still staying with the
[1:07:49] truth that brought us out and we still
[1:07:52] stay with the truth that has kept us the
[1:07:54] truth that has taught us
[1:07:56] truth that has given us revelation
[1:07:58] understanding of God a man do we have
[1:08:00] the revelation we need of the of Satan
[1:08:03] and the understanding of Satan and what
[1:08:05] God does this God does that God did this
[1:08:08] and God did that and God is going to do
[1:08:10] this and God is going to do that a man
[1:08:12] but let's to understand Satan did this
[1:08:15] Satan did that and he deceived many they
[1:08:18] meant and he's doing the same thing
[1:08:20] today brother I'm not looking for the
[1:08:22] devil over there I'm not dealing with
[1:08:24] Satan over there indeed he was Satan
[1:08:26] around the word he's there to challenge
[1:08:29] your faith he's here to challenge your
[1:08:31] revelation is there to add to it is that
[1:08:34] or take from it amen brother and as it
[1:08:38] was in the days of Luther and Wesley all
[1:08:40] the emphasis they put on the word the
[1:08:42] word the word the word any man but Satan
[1:08:45] is there to weaken that dead emphasis or
[1:08:50] not not to take it away but just just
[1:08:53] not make it as important as what what we
[1:08:55] did I trust we do we got to make it all
[1:08:58] as important as we did personally come
[1:09:01] to this word this was important
[1:09:03] concerning God bringing the Prophet
[1:09:05] concerning the revelation of the mystery
[1:09:07] of God it's important a man but the
[1:09:09] enemy is there too to make it weaker oh
[1:09:12] yes he is
[1:09:14] oh well that's important yeah but but
[1:09:17] not as important as you think you can
[1:09:20] you can take this you can do that you
[1:09:21] can do that no God is doing is
[1:09:25] separating son to him brother and it and
[1:09:27] I told you if God wants to do anything
[1:09:29] in US and through us with us it's got to
[1:09:31] be a total separation to the Lord amen
[1:09:36] so we got no influence of the devil in
[1:09:39] our thoughts no influence of the devil
[1:09:41] in our words or our deeds a man but yet
[1:09:45] I met many a believer that Satan
[1:09:47] influences their thoughts their words
[1:09:48] and their deeds oh yeah
[1:09:50] why do they say that well that wasn't
[1:09:52] the Holy Ghost that was the devil a man
[1:09:55] why did they do this
[1:09:56] amen why are they thinking this it's not
[1:09:59] God it's the devil
[1:10:00] oh yeah he's there to bring the negative
[1:10:03] a man and to get do away with our faith
[1:10:06] or to weaken our faith a man God permits
[1:10:09] it
[1:10:10] God allows it to challenge RV a man and
[1:10:14] knowing that the challenge in
[1:10:16] strengthens our feet
[1:10:18] praise the Lord hallelujah so God
[1:10:21] promised he would do this with Israel
[1:10:22] for Israel but then he was warning them
[1:10:24] against the enemy and he said el from
[1:10:27] beneath his moved for thee to meet
[1:10:28] Liette thy coming and it stirs up the
[1:10:31] dead for thee even all the chief ones of
[1:10:34] the earth it has raised up from their
[1:10:36] thrones all the kings of the nations and
[1:10:39] he said again in verse 10 all they that
[1:10:43] speaketh say unto thee are they'll also
[1:10:45] become weak as we are they'll become
[1:10:47] like unto us the pomp is brought down to
[1:10:50] the grave and the noise of Avoyelles
[1:10:53] and the worm is spread under thee and
[1:10:55] the worms cover thee now we're getting
[1:10:59] into the power the anointing that's
[1:11:01] causing it Satan amen amen and he said
[1:11:10] our the fallen from it from heaven Oh
[1:11:12] Lucifer where'd he come from heaven oh
[1:11:16] yeah he was in heaven he was a covering
[1:11:20] cherub he walked up and down in the
[1:11:22] coals of fire and he took pride in what
[1:11:26] he was doing a man he took pride in the
[1:11:29] influence that he was having on the
[1:11:31] other angels a man and just think of the
[1:11:33] thousands of angels that followed him
[1:11:36] amen and he said I had fallen from
[1:11:40] heaven o Lucifer son of the morning
[1:11:42] now either cut down to the ground which
[1:11:45] did weaken the nation's they read it
[1:11:49] says for thou has said in thy heart I
[1:11:52] will ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:11:55] throne above the stars of God Oh amazing
[1:12:02] he's proving himself - and he's become
[1:12:06] the god of this evil age he exalted
[1:12:09] himself above the stars of God and I was
[1:12:12] set also upon the Mount of the
[1:12:14] congregation in the size of the door and
[1:12:17] I will ascend above the heights of the
[1:12:19] clouds I will be like the most I a man
[1:12:25] don't let him deceive you come on grace
[1:12:30] he said I will be like the Most High and
[1:12:33] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell a
[1:12:36] man that's where he's coming they may to
[1:12:40] the size of the pit and they that see
[1:12:43] thee shall narrowly look upon thee and
[1:12:45] consider thee saying is this the man
[1:12:48] that made earth to tremble that did
[1:12:50] shake kingdoms and that was but it was
[1:12:53] he also got the worship of the people oh
[1:12:56] yeah they focused on him thinking they
[1:13:00] were focusing on Jehovah that's right
[1:13:04] and again God allows us to bring out the
[1:13:07] unbelief and he saw that and he said
[1:13:11] that made the world as a wilderness and
[1:13:13] destroyed the cities there out that
[1:13:15] opened not the house of his prisoners a
[1:13:18] man God's grace blessings word to our
[1:13:22] hearts the understanding a man that God
[1:13:25] is giving concerning the devil where he
[1:13:27] Karim what he does and where he's going
[1:13:30] grace turn with me to 2nd Peter chapter
[1:13:33] 2 second Peter chapter 2
[1:13:49] and they start again at verse one but
[1:13:55] there are a false prophets also among
[1:13:56] the people even as there shall be false
[1:13:59] teachers among you who privately shall
[1:14:04] bring in damnable heresies even denying
[1:14:07] the Lord that bought them and bring upon
[1:14:10] themselves Swift destruction do not
[1:14:13] acknowledging the truth the whole truth
[1:14:16] about the message of the hour and really
[1:14:18] want it what it means and what God has
[1:14:21] done
[1:14:22] oh they'll believe God sent a prophet
[1:14:24] and God opened the mystery of the seven
[1:14:26] seals and we believe this we believe
[1:14:28] that what brother there's more to it
[1:14:29] than that
[1:14:30] oh yes because it has to do with the
[1:14:33] coming of the Lord it has to do with the
[1:14:35] brought with the with the bridegroom
[1:14:37] coming to unite with the right a man the
[1:14:40] father was was preaching on the
[1:14:42] invisible union of the hurt of the
[1:14:44] earthly bride and they have any
[1:14:46] bridegroom sir brother we had to be on
[1:14:48] our guard a man and we had pray God give
[1:14:51] us revelation of what he's doing a man
[1:14:54] not what he's done old God did this God
[1:14:57] did that in William Branham it's true
[1:14:59] William Branham well what was God doing
[1:15:01] a man himself what about the presence of
[1:15:04] God what about the presence of our Lord
[1:15:06] Jesus Christ do we have the revelation
[1:15:09] of him or is it just the revelation of
[1:15:11] William Branham is it the revelation of
[1:15:13] malachi for a man but we got to go
[1:15:16] beyond that because why because malachi
[1:15:19] for which they introduced jesus a man
[1:15:22] because john introduced jesus bo the
[1:15:24] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:15:26] the world and now in this hour in this
[1:15:28] age did the malachi for for this day
[1:15:31] brother because why john was turning the
[1:15:33] fathers to the children now in this hour
[1:15:35] the Malachi 4 is turning the children
[1:15:38] back to the father's a man that's right
[1:15:41] because why the the Jewish fathers they
[1:15:44] they had to be turned to the pentecostal
[1:15:46] children now the pentecostal father says
[1:15:49] the worst their arts can be turned back
[1:15:50] to their children a man so that we're
[1:15:53] going to go back as it started in the
[1:15:56] beginning take away all that's been
[1:15:58] added to it and you'll stay with the
[1:16:00] truth the whole truth and nothing but
[1:16:02] the truth ain't bad but that's what God
[1:16:04] has done in this hour in this age he has
[1:16:06] come down a man it is the coming of the
[1:16:09] Lord for the bride praise the name of
[1:16:12] the Lord
[1:16:13] so let's believe that he is here and
[1:16:16] again brother
[1:16:17] as brother Brown said I know he said he
[1:16:20] said you can't see the other angel and
[1:16:22] he said he said he said I I'm not the
[1:16:24] son of man he said I'm only a son of man
[1:16:27] revealing the son of man and he was
[1:16:29] trying to get us to see him amen brother
[1:16:32] but too many just just saw a son of man
[1:16:35] but they didn't see the son of man they
[1:16:37] would see William Brennan but we let him
[1:16:39] do this we don't rent him did that and
[1:16:40] there was there was evangelist are there
[1:16:43] oh my they they love to have William
[1:16:45] Branham in their meetings they love to
[1:16:46] have will around the area they are there
[1:16:48] and so on why because of the gift that
[1:16:51] was there but again that wasn't William
[1:16:53] Branham it was Jesus as again let me say
[1:16:56] it again because brother BAM said a
[1:16:57] number of times no he's and I can't do
[1:16:59] this
[1:16:59] he said that season's so he said I got
[1:17:01] to get myself out of the way so he can
[1:17:03] come and do it any man and brother that
[1:17:05] was a ministry beyond Oral Roberts that
[1:17:07] was a minister beyond Wyndham right or
[1:17:09] not William Branham but beyond single
[1:17:11] Osburn or Billy Graham it was beyond all
[1:17:14] the other evangelists most definitely a
[1:17:16] man this was a ministry not not of a
[1:17:19] gift of eating a man there was a
[1:17:22] ministry of the son of man the Prophet
[1:17:25] not a gift of prophecy it was a prophet
[1:17:28] a man and God was revealing himself
[1:17:30] through the Prophet Christ was revealing
[1:17:33] himself through the prophets a man and
[1:17:35] to finally he took the prophet of the
[1:17:37] way so we put our attention on him a man
[1:17:40] he took Jesus he took John the Baptist
[1:17:42] off the scene so that the emphasis will
[1:17:44] be put on Jesus a man he was the one
[1:17:47] that he was he was the one John was
[1:17:49] pointing to a man so he took me talk
[1:17:52] with him bring him out to say and now
[1:17:54] he's plenty us to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:55] our bridegroom amen because that's the
[1:17:58] one that he was pointing to a man but
[1:18:01] still the people are pointing to William
[1:18:03] Branham they're still talking about
[1:18:05] winning BAM they're still talking about
[1:18:06] this mystery in that mystery but they're
[1:18:08] not acknowledging Jesus direct Naurang
[1:18:12] brother you want to go into resurrection
[1:18:14] you want to be part of the right
[1:18:15] you got to acknowledge his presence amen
[1:18:19] not the presence of William Branham but
[1:18:21] the presence of Jesus a man that he's
[1:18:23] not coming he's calm
[1:18:25] he may it he has come and again because
[1:18:29] again the probably got elated concerning
[1:18:30] day mr. neither the the pub the pillar
[1:18:35] of fire and brother the pillar of fire
[1:18:37] wasn't william branham it was Christ a
[1:18:39] man and again the cloud of angels and
[1:18:42] again in 1965 he says see he said there
[1:18:45] he is he said in the cloud he said
[1:18:47] looking down at us because the Bible
[1:18:50] says he'll come the same way he went he
[1:18:53] was received up into glory in a cloud
[1:18:55] and he came back in a cloud a man praise
[1:18:59] the name of the Lord
[1:19:00] Baldwin brother we're looking at we're
[1:19:02] looking at we're going to cut out I meet
[1:19:03] Jesus in the air yes but he's here he's
[1:19:07] here and when we meet him in the air
[1:19:09] hallelujah the time with the
[1:19:11] resurrection the time of the rapture
[1:19:12] when that goes to take place he's going
[1:19:14] to incarnate in the body called Jesus
[1:19:16] and he'll be right there then we'll go
[1:19:18] up to meet him in that body well right
[1:19:20] now we're dealing with Jesus in the
[1:19:22] cloud of angels and in the pillar of
[1:19:23] fire amen
[1:19:25] it's Christ reveal himself to his bride
[1:19:28] a man and only the bride's gonna
[1:19:31] recognize it a man only the bride was
[1:19:33] truly recognized Christ 2000 years ago
[1:19:36] others all they saw was signs and
[1:19:38] wonders oh yeah yeah again brother
[1:19:43] oh yeah because Jesus when he left and
[1:19:45] he went over on the other side of the
[1:19:46] ocean to see and so on and the people
[1:19:49] who all came over there with him and he
[1:19:50] said why did you come far as they come
[1:19:53] because they recognized the Son of Man
[1:19:54] no he said no he said because he should
[1:19:58] because of the miracle he said I I did
[1:20:01] this with the with the bread and the
[1:20:02] fish and he said I fed 5,000 and he
[1:20:05] should you come again because they
[1:20:06] wanted something natural amen and they
[1:20:09] came to win a run and they came to his
[1:20:11] ministry they came to his marriage why
[1:20:13] because they wanted healing they wanted
[1:20:16] God to do this one of God to do that
[1:20:17] and I tell you in in or Roberts ministry
[1:20:20] it was healing until Osborne's ministry
[1:20:22] was healing a
[1:20:23] many many other evangelists a man I held
[1:20:27] over them for all their names now but as
[1:20:29] I said I experienced those ministries
[1:20:31] and so on and brother they wanted this
[1:20:34] they wanted that just alright we'll pray
[1:20:36] for you and you'll be healed yelling god
[1:20:37] alone but it was this ministry was
[1:20:40] different Oh at William Branham it was
[1:20:43] absolutely different
[1:20:44] he was discerning the thoughts and
[1:20:46] intents of the heart
[1:20:47] a male he was doing what Jesus did in
[1:20:51] his first coming now I was doing it in
[1:20:53] the second coming and again it wasn't
[1:20:55] William Branham it was Jesus amen so
[1:20:58] grace of God brother that were will let
[1:21:01] but we know been stayin Laurie stay in
[1:21:04] the other dimension but we're gonna
[1:21:06] worship Jesus amen and Jesus is going to
[1:21:09] take us back there by grace God elbows a
[1:21:12] man that we're going to recognize the
[1:21:16] God there Jehovah of this age a man not
[1:21:20] the God of the evil age we're going to
[1:21:22] surge over and not the God of the evil
[1:21:24] age but as too many serving the god of

[1:25:18] them into chains of Darkness to be
[1:25:21] reserved unto judgement and spared not
[1:25:24] the old world but saved Noah the eighth

[1:35:12] famous no no you take the ones at least
[1:35:15] least honored
[1:35:17] yeah afford to correct his sons and
[1:35:20] daughters what is it why because God is

[1:35:27] humility a man not oh oh not lift you up
[1:35:33] get your lift up you're here oh oh you
[1:35:34] and make you proud no humble yourself a

[1:35:42] turn with me to Revelation chapter 2
[1:35:56] not necessarily preaching but teaching
[1:36:01] and in Revelation chapter 2 and verse 12
[1:36:07] and on to the Angel of the Church of
[1:36:09] Pergamos write these things saith he
[1:36:12] which has the sharp sword with two edges
[1:36:16] I know thy works where thou dwellest
[1:36:20] even where Satan's seat is amazing and
[1:36:24] the holdest fast my name and has not
[1:36:28] denied my faith even in those days
[1:36:30] wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr
[1:36:33] who was slain among you where Satan
[1:36:36] dwelleth amazing but I have a few things
[1:36:41] against thee because thou as their them
[1:36:46] that old the doctrine of Balaam again
[1:36:49] yo permissive will not perfect will yet
[1:36:54] Balaam was a prophet yeah I mazing
[1:36:57] he was a prophet and as the enemy
[1:37:01] influenced the prophecy and he
[1:37:03] influences some of the fivefold ministry
[1:37:04] today make your call and election sure
[1:37:09] bring it back to the Word of God by the
[1:37:11] grace of God so again and again it is I
[1:37:16] not not going to read it but again I
[1:37:18] believe he mentions Balaam again in the
[1:37:19] book of Jude warning the people you know
[1:37:24] absolutely amazing see again and what I
[1:37:27] want to get across is that is so close
[1:37:28] it would deceive the very elect if
[1:37:30] possible that's gonna put you on your
[1:37:33] guard a man that's gonna make you to
[1:37:37] make sure that you make your calling and
[1:37:39] election sure I have a few things
[1:37:42] against thee because thou has there them
[1:37:43] that oh the doctrine of Balaam who
[1:37:46] taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block
[1:37:50] before the children of Israel to eat
[1:37:53] things sacrificed unto idols and to
[1:37:55] commit fornication
[1:37:57] so as though also them that oh the
[1:38:00] doctrine of the Nicolaitans which I also
[1:38:04] hate what is it it's the god of this
[1:38:08] evil age
[1:38:09] forcing them down through the ages a man
[1:38:14] not not denying the word not to deny the
[1:38:17] truth not to deny the message but to add
[1:38:20] to it take from it amen
[1:38:23] he's done it right from the beginning
[1:38:25] and brother even more so now in this
[1:38:28] hour in this hour in this hour in this
[1:38:31] aged is worse because why because the
[1:38:34] god of this evil age has deceived the
[1:38:36] people so much and he influences their
[1:38:39] thoughts words indeed so much in the
[1:38:41] churches that they put Christ out they
[1:38:45] didn't want the thoughts of Christ they
[1:38:46] didn't want the words of Christ or the
[1:38:48] deeds of Christ no no
[1:38:50] oh we're just being religious and just
[1:38:52] do this just do that we believe these
[1:38:53] mysteries no there's a life that you
[1:38:56] live to reflect the message amen
[1:39:01] and deliver sorry ideas just theirs even
[1:39:04] believers that they're reflecting in a
[1:39:05] certain life showing the influence of
[1:39:08] Satan that's true as I've said I know
[1:39:11] I've met a lot of people a lot of
[1:39:13] believers over the years I mean the
[1:39:16] message I'm in the message I'm in the
[1:39:18] message but I got it I've got to confess
[1:39:21] that the message wasn't and isn't in
[1:39:24] them thank God that brother BAM
[1:39:29] highlighted that I believe in this
[1:39:30] message called this evil age he said
[1:39:35] you're in the message but the message is
[1:39:36] not in you he was seeing that over fifty
[1:39:40] years ago what are we seeing today make
[1:39:44] sure the message is in you it's a
[1:39:48] message is in you Jesus is in you God is
[1:39:52] in you amen
[1:39:53] and you're going to add the thoughts of
[1:39:55] God the words of God and the deeds of
[1:39:57] God amen
[1:39:59] lord grace that were going to be like
[1:40:02] Abraham a man but not like baleine Grise
[1:40:09] Amazing Grace
[1:40:12] there's another couple of scriptures
[1:40:16] Deuteronomy chapter 6 the book of
[1:40:26] Deuteronomy chapter 6 and beginning read
[1:40:32] in verse 4 here o Israel the Lord our
[1:40:40] God is one Lord and thou shalt love the
[1:40:43] Lord thy God with all thy heart with all
[1:40:45] thy soul and with all thy might and
[1:40:48] these words which I command thee this
[1:40:51] day shall be in thine heart and thou
[1:40:55] shalt teach them diligently unto thy
[1:40:57] children be diligent in the way you
[1:41:01] raise your child be diligent in the way
[1:41:05] that you teach their child
[1:41:07] amen and thou shalt teach them
[1:41:09] diligently unto thy children and shalt
[1:41:12] talk of them when thou sittest in thine
[1:41:14] house and when thou walkest by the way
[1:41:17] and when thou liest down and when thou
[1:41:19] rises up he meant the word the word the
[1:41:23] word the word brother it was a time when
[1:41:27] when we met believers we talked about
[1:41:28] the word the word the word if we met on
[1:41:30] the street it's the word if we meant or
[1:41:33] just somewhere else in a store the word
[1:41:36] oh yeah no matter where we were admit we
[1:41:40] just couldn't get away from the word
[1:41:41] word was talking to word and we talked
[1:41:45] about the words oh yeah
[1:41:47] praise the name of the Lord but today
[1:41:50] believers are believers just like in
[1:41:53] denominations yeah so you you might talk
[1:41:56] about it when you go to church yeah you
[1:41:58] might talk about it when you do this
[1:42:00] when you do that but it's not like it
[1:42:02] used to be no Amen sister not like it
[1:42:06] used to be God have mercy on us
[1:42:08] glad to beyond a phone conversation
[1:42:11] where brother Bob yesterday I believe it
[1:42:13] was and talked about the word talk with
[1:42:16] Lord anybody talk with the revelation
[1:42:19] the revelation this the revelation that
[1:42:21] to God be the glory
[1:42:23] a man why that that's it's reflecting
[1:42:26] your faith faith comes by hearing the
[1:42:29] word Amen brother
[1:42:32] and what God has done through the
[1:42:34] opening of the word is to give a speech
[1:42:35] and you got faith where the Bible says
[1:42:37] that those in the in the early church
[1:42:39] today about are in the Pentecostal age
[1:42:42] they're the first stage oh my they went
[1:42:45] from house to house to house and that
[1:42:48] fellowship and talked about the word
[1:42:50] serve communion or did this or did that
[1:42:53] it was all the word the heard the word
[1:42:55] Amen brother they had to spirited the
[1:42:59] revival and the bride's got the spirit
[1:43:01] of the bride revival so brother you
[1:43:03] can't talk about anything else or the
[1:43:05] word you can start talking about this
[1:43:07] but it goes to the word you might go
[1:43:09] over to this and go back to the word any
[1:43:12] man because no matter what's going on we
[1:43:14] know it's the word
[1:43:15] it's prophecy being fulfilled amen amen
[1:43:19] even concern he was going on now bring

[1:48:37] but many a ring is so good but they all
[1:48:41] they if they were serious they would
[1:48:44] consult the Lord they would really be
[1:48:47] thankful to them thank you Jesus thank
[1:48:49] you Lord no matter what the blessing is
[1:48:51] you don't just take it for granted and
[1:48:52] go on no you say Lord thank you yeah
[1:48:56] but they were blessed but they forgot
[1:49:02] the Lord that blessed them and it says
[1:49:08] beware lest thou forget the Lord which
[1:49:11] brought the body forth out of the land
[1:49:13] of Egypt and from the house of bondage
[1:49:16] and thou shalt fear the Lord thy God and
[1:49:20] serve him and shall swear by his name
[1:49:23] and ye shall not go after other gods of
[1:49:28] the gods of the people which are round
[1:49:31] about you for the Lord thy God is a
[1:49:35] jealous god among you but there under
[1:49:40] the influence of the god of this evil
[1:49:43] age they under the influence not of
[1:49:46] Jehovah but of the devil amen though God
[1:49:50] bless them they forgot God the grace of
[1:49:53] God be with us let's go to another
[1:49:56] scripture here Luke chapter 4
[1:50:05] amen amazing
[1:50:16] new chapter for this not be ignorant of
[1:50:21] the word and verse one and Jesus being
[1:50:28] full of the Holy Ghost returned from
[1:50:31] Jordan and was led by the spirit into
[1:50:33] the wilderness being forty days tempted
[1:50:36] of the devil did we consider that we're
[1:50:42] tempted by the devil brother sister we
[1:50:44] need to get the victory constantly
[1:50:47] because there's not a day that goes by
[1:50:50] but Satan is there to tempt you he was
[1:50:53] there to tempt Jesus he's there to tempt
[1:50:55] you and me a man and sometimes the way
[1:50:59] that he tempted Jesus he's there to
[1:51:01] tempt you and me yeah he was tempted of
[1:51:09] the devil and in those days he did eat
[1:51:12] nothing and when they were ended he
[1:51:16] afterward a hungered amazing and the
[1:51:20] devil said unto him if thou be the Son
[1:51:23] of God command this stone did it be made
[1:51:26] bread Satan works on our weaknesses oh
[1:51:30] yes he does
[1:51:32] to try to get us to do this and do that
[1:51:34] o do this - no get to behind me Satan
[1:51:37] and Jesus was getting weak because he
[1:51:41] was getting hungry after 40 days if
[1:51:44] you're on a on a fast and you don't eat
[1:51:49] after 40 days after three or four days
[1:51:52] the hunger is gone after 40 days it
[1:51:58] returns you know and Jesus felt hungry
[1:52:02] and the devil was there to tempt him oh
[1:52:07] if you're this one if you're God
[1:52:09] if you're the Son of God command that
[1:52:11] this stone that be made bread what force
[1:52:15] will eat it and sometimes the devil is
[1:52:18] going to tempt us do this do this do
[1:52:19] this because you need this you need this
[1:52:21] get away Satan I'll do without it amen
[1:52:25] god help us
[1:52:27] we're gonna have the attitude Jesus in
[1:52:29] the spirit that Jesus a and jesus
[1:52:34] answered him saying it is written that
[1:52:36] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:52:39] every word of God a man shall not live
[1:52:42] by money alone no it's your faith in God
[1:52:46] hey man oh I want this and I want this I
[1:52:51] want this assurance I want this
[1:52:52] guarantee forget it
[1:52:53] serve the Lord amen
[1:52:57] that's right thank God because God has
[1:53:01] dealt with many one down through the
[1:53:03] ages
[1:53:03] for yeah oh but didn't God bless him
[1:53:07] with this blessing with that
[1:53:08] Saamy did somebody didn't that's right
[1:53:12] because no not everybody can handle it
[1:53:14] that's right
[1:53:16] some can handle it can supply but the
[1:53:18] Bible says that and others can't why
[1:53:22] some control it others it controls them
[1:53:26] yeah so let's make sure that we're in
[1:53:30] control no matter what's going on in
[1:53:32] your life you're in control amen
[1:53:35] and the control that you have over it is
[1:53:37] governed by the word and the power of
[1:53:39] the Holy Ghost it's not you lives crisis
[1:53:43] living in you he's controlling all these
[1:53:45] things amen and he said man shall not
[1:53:51] live by bread alone but by every word of
[1:53:55] God and the devil taking him up into a
[1:53:58] high mountain showed unto him all the
[1:54:00] kingdoms of the world in in a moment of
[1:54:02] time what power Satan got be careful
[1:54:08] there's again why the Bible says Jesus
[1:54:10] said they'll show signs and wonders well
[1:54:14] he showed Jesus signs and wonders he
[1:54:17] took Jesus up into a mountain he took
[1:54:19] him to the top of the temple he
[1:54:20] shortened this he showed him that yeah
[1:54:23] tempting Jesus so don't don't be tempted
[1:54:27] by signs and wonders no make sure it's
[1:54:30] the word amen
[1:54:35] the devil took him up into a high
[1:54:37] mountain and showed onto him and they
[1:54:39] all the kingdoms of the world yeah I
[1:54:42] just think showed him all the kings of
[1:54:44] the world in a moment of time so be on
[1:54:49] your guard
[1:54:50] cuz Satan got power too well you can do
[1:54:54] this and he can do that make sure it's
[1:54:56] God stay with the word and the prophet
[1:55:00] of God brings out in the end a message
[1:55:02] on the seven churches they preach in
[1:55:04] 1954 just one message and he brings out
[1:55:07] about the messenger to the seventh to
[1:55:09] the third church age a brother named
[1:55:12] Saint Martin yeah he was he was he was
[1:55:17] Catholic but he came out and he went to
[1:55:19] the word stayed with the word he had
[1:55:21] signs and wonders it was absolutely
[1:55:23] amazing at the ministry that he had oh
[1:55:26] yeah and and one point there he was
[1:55:29] sitting down he was doing this to it and
[1:55:31] he turned over all what's said there he
[1:55:35] saw this man rise up but a crown on his
[1:55:37] aide and he said Martin don't you know
[1:55:43] me I'm Jesus worship me and say Martin
[1:55:50] looked at him and he says he's funny
[1:55:51] no and again the man said look please
[1:55:57] worship me bow down before me I'm the
[1:56:02] Lord Jesus Christ I redeem you all the
[1:56:07] sudden is struck st. Martin he said get
[1:56:10] thee behind me Satan he said you're not
[1:56:14] Jesus he said you got a crown on your
[1:56:17] head and he said according to the Bible
[1:56:21] he said the Saints will crown him at the
[1:56:24] end of the ages he said he doesn't have
[1:56:27] a crown yet so he said get it get out of
[1:56:29] here and he disappeared oh yeah how many
[1:56:35] will be deceived because all I had this
[1:56:37] vision I saw this and I saw that
[1:56:40] but was it scriptural because the day
[1:56:43] that the devil can give you a vision the
[1:56:45] devil can show him something
[1:56:46] supernatural that's right he was showing
[1:56:48] Jesus all
[1:56:49] and he showed Martin st. Martin that oh
[1:56:51] yeah don't be deceived praise the Lord
[1:56:57] hallelujah and the devil said unto him
[1:57:03] all this power will I give thee and the
[1:57:08] glory of them for that is delivered unto
[1:57:10] me and to whomsoever I will I give it if
[1:57:14] thou wilt therefore will worship me all
[1:57:17] shall be dying worship the devil they
[1:57:23] didn't become God to Jesus that Jesus
[1:57:27] worshiped the devil
[1:57:29] no way oh yeah sometimes the devil is
[1:57:34] doing a lot of things to even believers
[1:57:35] out there and they're worshiping him
[1:57:37] thinking they're worshiping God and
[1:57:39] they're worshiping the devil that God of
[1:57:42] this evil age grace
[1:57:50] and he said that therefore they will
[1:57:52] worship me all shall be thine and jesus
[1:57:55] answered and said unto him get thee
[1:57:57] behind me Satan for it is written thou
[1:58:00] shalt worship the Lord thy God and him
[1:58:03] only shalt thou serve
[1:58:06] amen and he brought him to Jerusalem and
[1:58:10] set him on the pinnacle of the temple
[1:58:11] and said unto him if thou be the Son of
[1:58:13] God cast thyself down from it's for his
[1:58:16] written he shall give his angels charge
[1:58:18] over thee to keep thee and in their
[1:58:22] hands they shall bear thee up lest at
[1:58:24] any time thou dash thy foot against the
[1:58:26] stone
[1:58:27] and Jesus answering said unto Him it is
[1:58:29] said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy
[1:58:32] God amen
[1:58:35] praise the Lord don't you tempt God at
[1:58:41] the same time Satan shouldn't be
[1:58:42] tempting God he was when he was tempting
[1:58:44] Jesus he was God he was trying to tempt
[1:58:49] God to do this and do this do that did
[1:58:51] we get to behind me Satan thou shalt not
[1:58:54] tempt the LORD thy God and when the
[1:58:58] devil ended all the temptation he
[1:59:01] departed from him not forever but for a
[1:59:04] season amen
[1:59:07] as Satan is still there tempting now
[1:59:11] grace to us brother that we not be
[1:59:14] deceived amen there's a couple other
[1:59:18] scriptures or two or three others curses
[1:59:20] I had here but let me show you with a
[1:59:23] couple of boats and then we'll we'll
[1:59:26] have to dismiss or change the order god
[1:59:30] bless you
[1:59:35] again and the god of this evil age it's
[1:59:38] amazing we think of God we only think of
[1:59:42] Jehovah thing of God we want to think of
[1:59:45] Jesus but God through the prophet of the
[1:59:49] hour through the message of the hour has
[1:59:51] warned us that Satan is also a God you
[1:59:56] know he becomes a god to the people amen
[2:00:00] and he's worship as I should shared the
[2:00:03] quote with you two or three times where
[2:00:05] the prophet of God said he's me Satan is
[2:00:07] worshipped by millions and billions of
[2:00:11] people and he is Satan has been
[2:00:15] worshiped down through the ages for
[2:00:18] thick or 5,000 years and he's been is
[2:00:21] being worshipped in this last stage
[2:00:24] jesus said as it was in the days of Noah
[2:00:32] wherein eight souls were saved so shall
[2:00:35] it be at the coming of the Son of Man
[2:00:36] and in the days of lot where 3:3 was
[2:00:40] brought out of Sodom now there's already
[2:00:42] a group he said already out but as it
[2:00:45] was then when the Son of Man will be
[2:00:48] manifested look hard and look where we
[2:00:50] are living now and brother Brown did say
[2:00:53] listen he said I know what you're
[2:00:54] thinking he said that I'm covering a lot
[2:00:58] of territory we're covering a lot of
[2:01:01] Scripture yeah
[2:01:03] and more willing I'm covering a lot of
[2:01:06] territory and in the met in the Ministry
[2:01:09] of this message the godless evil age he
[2:01:12] said you say he said you're covering a
[2:01:16] lot of territory and he was he was going
[2:01:20] right back to eternity coming down
[2:01:23] through time and eventually go back to
[2:01:25] eternity to show us the god of this evil
[2:01:29] age the devil to show us the power and
[2:01:33] the influence the Satan has got on the
[2:01:36] people he's not out there trying to
[2:01:40] deceive the sinners they're already
[2:01:42] deceived their serpent seed but he's
[2:01:46] right here
[2:01:47] trying to deceive the seed of God yeah
[2:01:52] so he said look hard he should look
[2:01:56] where we are living they meant when it
[2:02:02] comes to this past week what power what
[2:02:05] anointing has influenced you in what you
[2:02:07] have done and what you're doing what
[2:02:11] power has influenced you in your
[2:02:13] thoughts your words and your deeds was
[2:02:16] it God or was it the devil did you deal
[2:02:20] with the devil are you conscious of that
[2:02:25] Saint Martin he was very conscious of
[2:02:28] Satan I'll tell you there's very few
[2:02:31] ministries like Saint Martin not many he
[2:02:36] had an absolutely powerful ministry and
[2:02:39] he stayed with the word he encouraged
[2:02:43] people stay with the word yeah so
[2:02:47] brother the grace of God be with us
[2:02:50] because the god of this evil age is
[2:02:53] influencing men women and young people
[2:02:57] to live to dress to act like the world
[2:03:00] and still think that they are Christians
[2:03:02] and many believers got his soul out to
[2:03:06] Satan not denying the message say more
[2:03:09] deny it he knows it was God but he's
[2:03:13] going to get you to compromise on
[2:03:16] certain things that the Prophet said
[2:03:19] grace of God to us
[2:03:24] amen he said notice the sons of God saw
[2:03:29] the daughters of men not the daughters
[2:03:34] of God the daughters of men that they
[2:03:39] were beautiful and it caused the sons of
[2:03:42] God to fall into this delusion and they
[2:03:45] took them kind of women and married them
[2:03:47] and it brought a haze of prostitution
[2:03:50] just like it is today he's like it was
[2:03:54] in Sullivan and he said like you
[2:03:55] predicted to be today yeah as it was in
[2:04:00] that day so it is in this day and he
[2:04:01] highlighted it in another way insane why
[2:04:04] was it then
[2:04:05] he said it is now he said there's a lot
[2:04:07] of common law relationships and there is
[2:04:10] it's getting worse you know marriages is
[2:04:14] becoming a historical thing ancient oh
[2:04:17] yeah it is more and more getting
[2:04:20] involved with common-law relationships
[2:04:23] he's that's the sign of the end and what
[2:04:27] and whose influences it is the god of
[2:04:29] this evil age Satan brother the world is
[2:04:33] under the control of a power the world's
[2:04:36] under control than anointing and it's
[2:04:38] not Almighty God it's not Jehovah it's
[2:04:41] the devil
[2:04:42] that's right and they are worshiping him
[2:04:45] all right
[2:04:46] they want to worship Him you know
[2:04:48] because why because of the compromise
[2:04:51] because they can believe this and
[2:04:53] believe that and still do this and still
[2:04:54] do that and not be convicted
[2:04:57] whereas if God is in control Joel was in
[2:05:00] control you're gonna be convicted you'll
[2:05:03] convict you if it's your thought is a
[2:05:05] word or deed no matter what it is he'll
[2:05:07] convict you that's not according to his
[2:05:08] will cause grace and he says it is
[2:05:14] predicted to me today that when man and
[2:05:16] women of this day swap wives and if they
[2:05:19] don't like this way they go over to the
[2:05:21] Nevada and get married and get a divorce
[2:05:24] that one and marry again and he said in
[2:05:28] women so pretty that they're almost
[2:05:30] irresistible and what is it the devil
[2:05:32] Satan is still in Beauty and
[2:05:37] notice the sin was never forgiven them
[2:05:40] and he said that pretty scientific age
[2:05:42] was very evil age that God destroyed off
[2:05:45] the face of the earth and he said that
[2:05:48] pretty scientific age and he said Jesus
[2:05:51] said it'll be that way again before the
[2:05:53] coming of the Son of Man and as it was
[2:05:56] in the days of Noah so will it be in the
[2:05:59] coming of the Son of Man when they all
[2:06:01] tried to be in - to marry watch the sons
[2:06:05] of God married the pretty daughters of
[2:06:07] man God never did forgive them God
[2:06:10] destroyed it all he meant why because
[2:06:14] they had turned themselves over to
[2:06:15] Satan's influence a man and God is going
[2:06:20] to destroy the world again
[2:06:22] he destroyed it by by water he's going
[2:06:25] to destroy it by fire and the fire is
[2:06:28] falling why because man has given
[2:06:31] themselves over to Satan's influence
[2:06:32] they made the god of this evil age God
[2:06:40] never did forgive them just the same as
[2:06:43] bailiffs teaching that he caused pretty
[2:06:45] intellectual scientific women he saw
[2:06:48] with their flirty eyes and their paints
[2:06:50] and powders their perfumes easy to
[2:06:54] entice the sons of God against their own
[2:06:57] women that worked and had calluses in
[2:07:00] their hands with no makeup entice them
[2:07:03] over let us marry one another because
[2:07:06] we're all the same people he said that
[2:07:08] was a lie it was a lie
[2:07:10] and Ana treatment of the devil to get
[2:07:15] the sons of God to marry the daughters
[2:07:17] of man yeah there's an intermingling and
[2:07:21] it's amazing believers that are caught
[2:07:23] up with those things I know there's a
[2:07:25] lot of believers caught up with with
[2:07:27] those things you know there I saw yes
[2:07:31] it's getting worse but they're not gonna
[2:07:34] listen to me definitely not they're
[2:07:40] gonna do what they want to do because
[2:07:41] they still believe they're believers
[2:07:43] they still believe they're Christians
[2:07:45] you know oh oh well I'm good good
[2:07:50] good for what as my father said you're
[2:07:53] good or good for nothing
[2:07:55] yeah so the people think they're good
[2:07:58] because I didn't do this I didn't do
[2:08:00] that I didn't do that yeah but did you
[2:08:02] do anything contrary to God's will God
[2:08:06] have mercy here with me
[2:08:14] he says Satan enticed them what let us
[2:08:18] marry one another because we're all the
[2:08:21] same people that was a lie
[2:08:22] it was the lie and an achievement of the
[2:08:25] devil to get the sons of God to marry
[2:08:27] the daughters of man it was the lie of
[2:08:29] the devil for Balaam that that false
[2:08:32] prophet to try to prophesy against Moses
[2:08:35] that tried to hold the race together and
[2:08:37] say well we believe the same God we
[2:08:40] offer the same offerings we had the same
[2:08:42] sacrifices we do everything just alike
[2:08:45] so close that they would deceive the
[2:08:47] elect if possible and come away from her
[2:08:50] people come away he said have nothing to
[2:08:53] do with her grace he said God is not
[2:08:57] foolish and he's the source of all
[2:09:00] wisdom so you see where that stuff come
[2:09:03] from
[2:09:03] it come from Satan and it's still Satan
[2:09:06] the church has believed it amen
[2:09:10] he said you women you see I'm trying my
[2:09:14] best to show you the word amen
[2:09:18] God's grace I'll finish with this quote
[2:09:20] here we still haven't finished the
[2:09:22] message he says Satan the god of this
[2:09:25] age by his knowledge giving people to
[2:09:30] eat from his mixed tree of good and evil
[2:09:33] and as I said the Internet is a tree of
[2:09:37] knowledge of good and evil and Satan is
[2:09:40] giving the people food to eat from the
[2:09:43] mixed tree of the knowledge of good and
[2:09:45] evil he's mixing it he says Satan by his
[2:09:51] knowledge causing the people of this
[2:09:53] evil age to eat from his tree and he
[2:09:58] says that he's building a greater
[2:09:59] Christian civilization by his knowledge
[2:10:02] of good and evil but Christ's little
[2:10:06] virgin Christ's word flock bride don't
[2:10:12] care for it Satan's knowledge she keeps
[2:10:15] free of him what is it she stays with
[2:10:18] the word the bride is going to stay with
[2:10:20] the word amen sort of right so as
[2:10:24] believers we're going to stay with the
[2:10:26] word by the
[2:10:27] race of Almighty God amen and not just
[2:10:32] saying I'm staying with the word we're
[2:10:34] we're not going to take the devil's
[2:10:36] revelation of it we're gonna stay with
[2:10:37] God's revelation of the word not the
[2:10:40] devil's brother Bram says our attitude
[2:10:44] towards Christ and His Word will
