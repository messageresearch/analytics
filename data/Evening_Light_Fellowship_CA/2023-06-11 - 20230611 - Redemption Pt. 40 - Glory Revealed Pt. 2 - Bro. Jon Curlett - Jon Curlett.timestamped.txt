[39:02] Lord we're thankful
[39:04] Lord to be in this wonderful atmosphere
[39:06] this morning
[39:08] Lord that there's a call in our heart
[39:10] that draws us
[39:12] Lord to come into your presence to seek
[39:14] the things of God
[39:15] Lord to seek out your will to seek out
[39:18] your way
[39:19] Lord to seek out your plan and your
[39:21] purpose Lord and then to walk in it Lord
[39:23] we can't just be heroes owner only but
[39:25] we want to be doers as well Lord not of
[39:28] our own will or desire or opinion Lord
[39:30] but that we fall right in line with your
[39:32] word Lord with your purpose for each and
[39:34] every one of us
[39:35] Lord we're thankful for your guidance
[39:37] this morning Lord the song leader Lord
[39:39] just a perfect song service Lord for the
[39:41] message we have this morning Lord we
[39:43] pray you speak to each heart and soul
[39:45] lord those that aren't here Lord those
[39:47] that have need of your touch Lord we
[39:49] pray your grace to them each one Lord
[39:51] that you've reveal yourself to them as
[39:52] well we pray Lord just speak to your
[39:55] people now we ask in Jesus Christ's name
[39:57] amen
[39:59] amen God bless you if you'll turn your
[40:00] scriptures to John chapter 17.
[40:03] then John chapter 17 is good to be home
[40:05] picked up a bit of a sore throat and
[40:08] cold while I was away but I think it
[40:11] just goes to show I meant to be here not
[40:13] elsewhere I'm a homebody I told my wife
[40:16] it's how I know I wasn't a missionaries
[40:18] because every time I go away I seem to
[40:19] get sick so
[40:21] I'm a homebody I like to stay where I am
[40:23] but it's uh it's good to be home welcome
[40:25] our brother Isaac Whitmire here with us
[40:27] he's going to be spending another week
[40:28] or so with us Lord willing it's good to
[40:30] see him
[40:32] I could see brother Paul and sister
[40:33] Michael back in our midst as well
[40:35] recovering from their pregnancy
[40:37] and good to have him back on the guitar
[40:39] as well from his his flesh wound on his
[40:42] hand as well so we're thankful for that
[40:44] brother Josh that was a wonderful song
[40:45] service this morning and I believe that
[40:47] was the leading of the Lord very good
[40:49] just listening to the different things
[40:50] there and the thoughts that the Lord's
[40:52] put on my heart for this morning I'm
[40:53] thankful for that
[40:55] just uh one prayer request some of you
[40:57] will know my uh one of my uh
[41:01] friends from school Lisa Lynn stockley
[41:03] her mother passed away from cancer
[41:04] yesterday or the day before so they're
[41:07] having a a visitation today and tomorrow
[41:09] so I'm hoping to go
[41:11] see her and and be with the family for a
[41:14] bit but just wanted to bring that need
[41:16] to the family it's uh it's a it's a
[41:18] tough thing I know and so just keep her
[41:22] in prayer I told her we would be praying
[41:23] for her so trusting that the Lord will
[41:25] be with them she's a Salvation Army her
[41:27] and her family so just trusting that
[41:29] they'll find a measure of Grace and
[41:31] comfort where they're at amen and then
[41:33] John chapter 17.
[41:35] and verse 1 says these words spoke Jesus
[41:38] and lifted up his eyes to heaven and
[41:40] said father the hour is come glorify thy
[41:44] son that thy son Also may glorify thee
[41:46] as thou has given him Power Over All
[41:49] Flesh that he should give eternal life
[41:51] to as many as thou has given him and
[41:54] this is eternal life that they might
[41:56] Know Thee the only true God and Jesus
[41:59] Christ whom thou has sent I have
[42:02] glorified thee on the earth I have
[42:04] finished the work which thou gavest me
[42:06] to do and now O Father glorify thou me
[42:10] with thine own self with the glory which
[42:12] I have with thee before the world was
[42:15] amen you can have your seats this
[42:16] morning God bless you we're going to
[42:18] continue on this thought of adoption
[42:19] inside of our series on Redemption and I
[42:22] just wanted to quickly thank brother
[42:23] Matt we've got the other screen up and
[42:26] we've got a bigger screen there that I
[42:27] can see so much more easily so it's
[42:29] wonderful to see these things that's
[42:30] really coming together we've got a few
[42:32] things left I know but it's it's just
[42:34] nice to be in a church that works and
[42:36] everything is kind of in its place so
[42:38] thankful for that and I know it's a lot
[42:39] of work we still have the sound booth
[42:41] going in over there and these different
[42:42] things we've got carpet coming in in the
[42:44] next few weeks but just thankful for
[42:46] that I think most of you would have seen
[42:47] the email from brother Mark sharing that
[42:49] our power bill went down by 55 percent I
[42:51] think month over month and some of
[42:53] that's because things got a little bit
[42:55] warmer not much but we're seeing just a
[42:57] big impact just from putting in the the
[42:59] HVAC system here the heat pumps and that
[43:01] so to those listening online I know
[43:03] there's some ministers listening that
[43:05] have that have supported us this is a
[43:07] benefit from from the money that we've
[43:09] received so we're so thankful for that
[43:11] amen so we're going to take a series or
[43:13] continue our series on Redemption and
[43:15] we've been speaking about adoption which
[43:17] is kind of the last portion of
[43:18] redemption because Redemption is
[43:20] bringing you back to your original
[43:21] position and that means adoption is
[43:23] putting you into it he brings you back
[43:25] to it and then he puts you into it and
[43:27] so I want to speak on this thought of
[43:29] Glory revealed just continuing from
[43:31] where we were last service and if you
[43:32] remember last service we spoke about the
[43:34] special robe for the adopted son and it
[43:36] was a robe that was built just for him
[43:38] and today maybe it would be a tailored
[43:41] suit or something like that as a son
[43:43] would come into the family business or
[43:44] come into his purpose in the family he
[43:46] would wear this special jacket this
[43:48] special robe that was given to him and
[43:50] it was specifically for him it wouldn't
[43:52] fit anybody else it wasn't built for
[43:54] anybody else but rather it was fitted to
[43:56] him and we won't go into it so much
[43:58] today but brother Brandon would talk
[43:59] about when Elijah and Elisha in that
[44:01] last scene and Elijah's taken up and
[44:03] that robe came down he says it fit
[44:06] perfectly on Elisha not because the robe
[44:08] was cut for him but he was cut to the
[44:10] robe amen we do not the word is not cut
[44:13] to fit us but we are cut to fit the word
[44:16] amen and so you'll see with this sun
[44:18] what had happened was he'd been trimmed
[44:21] he'd been shaped into what the father
[44:23] had in store for him and then he could
[44:25] wrap him in the robe of the word then he
[44:27] could wrap him in the fullness of his
[44:29] righteousness then he could wrap him in
[44:31] his purpose and his predestinated plan
[44:33] and the son would wear it because he was
[44:35] fitted to the robe amen the robe was
[44:37] already prepared he was waiting for the
[44:38] sun to be ready for those things and
[44:40] this robe was affirmation of what he had
[44:42] done the trials and the testing he had
[44:44] passed it was it was a confirmation of
[44:46] the witness of the of the Tudor of the
[44:48] Holy Spirit we would say and it was also
[44:50] representing what he was going to be
[44:52] because in adoption you are you are
[44:55] coming to the place where you're
[44:56] recognized for what you've done and
[44:58] you're recognized for who you are but
[44:59] it's to take you further into what
[45:02] you're supposed to do now it's taken you
[45:04] into the purpose of the father into the
[45:06] family business into the kingdom of God
[45:08] and it was pointing to the fact that not
[45:10] only were you good and were you affected
[45:12] but you were going to be even more
[45:13] effective and you're going to do more
[45:15] and more for the family and for the good
[45:16] of the family and these different things
[45:18] we talked about how Jesus had done most
[45:20] of his signs and wonders before he ever
[45:22] came to adoption and we wanted to remind
[45:25] ourselves that just because we're in a
[45:26] journey to adoption doesn't mean that
[45:28] God can't use us and God doesn't use us
[45:30] he absolutely does as he teaches you as
[45:32] you learn as you grow as you pass the
[45:34] test of this life then God can trust you
[45:36] in those areas and so he'll bless you
[45:38] with gifts he'll bless you with
[45:40] opportunity he'll bless you with people
[45:41] that can come in and he'll use you for
[45:43] those things but he's taking you to a
[45:45] place where there's a greater work and
[45:47] there's a final work that he's calling
[45:48] you to but after his Transfiguration
[45:50] Mount Transfiguration experience what
[45:52] did he do he started focusing now
[45:54] remember Elijah and Moses came and they
[45:56] talked to him about what was going to
[45:58] happen next and in the adoption ceremony
[46:01] is not just recognition but it's telling
[46:03] you here's your job now here's what
[46:05] you're supposed to do and Jesus focused
[46:06] after that was to get to Jerusalem and
[46:09] get into that final role which was
[46:10] Redeemer he had done all the signs and
[46:13] wonders and healings and miracles and
[46:15] all of those were wonderful and they
[46:16] proved who he was
[46:18] they proved who he was the training of
[46:20] the child proves who he was because he's
[46:22] got the DNA of the father inside of him
[46:25] he's got the DNA of the Overcomer inside
[46:27] of him he's got the DNA of the business
[46:29] owner inside of him he's got the DNA of
[46:31] the one that is successful and that
[46:33] training was to prove who he was and
[46:35] that's what Christ was doing he was
[46:37] proving he was the son of God he was
[46:39] proving he was the second Adam he was
[46:40] proving he had dominion over all these
[46:42] things but if all he did was signs and
[46:45] wonders we'd will we'd still be lost
[46:47] today
[46:47] if all he did was walk on water if all
[46:50] he did was cast out demons if all he did
[46:52] was heal the sick then we would still be
[46:54] lost today because the prophets did that
[46:56] men and women of God did those things in
[46:59] the past but that did not solve the
[47:00] issue brother Branham would say this he
[47:03] said all of his teaching
[47:05] he brought the word he was the word all
[47:07] of his teaching all of his works all of
[47:10] his miracles died with him if he didn't
[47:13] raise from the dead there had to be
[47:16] something Beyond works there had to be
[47:18] something Beyond just a life he had to
[47:20] give his life to restore us back amen
[47:22] the reason we can live today without
[47:24] guilt without fear without shame without
[47:27] these things in our life is because he
[47:29] died and the price was paid and then he
[47:31] sent back an overcoming life to us that
[47:34] would look past all those things that
[47:36] would take us practice Fallen flesh that
[47:38] would take us past our memories and our
[47:40] minds and our opinions and it would
[47:42] bring us into a Walk of Life where we
[47:43] could live in Victory we could live in
[47:45] peace we could live and rest we could
[47:47] live in the life of God Amen it was a
[47:49] life that would transform us from death
[47:51] into life he proved it because he died
[47:54] and he rose again and the scripture says
[47:56] if the same life that raised Christ from
[47:58] the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your
[48:00] mortal body right here today right now
[48:02] and it'll make you do the things that
[48:04] Christ did it'll give you the life it'll
[48:07] give you the signs and wonders it'll
[48:08] give you overcoming power it'll give you
[48:10] the mind of Christ it'll give you a
[48:12] heart to serve God and do the things
[48:13] that he has for you to do in this life
[48:16] brother Brandon would say this if he
[48:18] never performs any more Miracle on you
[48:21] but the great miracle and forgives your
[48:24] sin that's the greatest miracle that God
[48:26] ever performed was to forgive a human
[48:29] being it's sin take a man and convert
[48:32] him from the things that's changed his
[48:34] innermost being from the things that he
[48:36] once drank and gambled and done evil and
[48:38] things like that and all of a sudden he
[48:40] said it turns him right around to what
[48:43] to love God is love the defining future
[48:47] of God is love not this wishy-washy love
[48:50] but it's a love that's for our good
[48:53] he says it turns him right back to love
[48:55] and he goes home to his wife and says
[48:56] honey I'm sorry that I treated you like
[48:58] that picks up his ill children hold him
[49:00] in his arms daddy spent all of his money
[49:02] for whiskey and Daddy has done this I'll
[49:05] never do it again God forgive me he says
[49:07] how that testimony that's one of the
[49:10] greatest things there is all the
[49:12] alcoholics anonymous and all like that
[49:14] can never change like that did they can
[49:16] never do it for the person
[49:19] I believe in signs and wonders I've seen
[49:21] signs and wonders I've been a part of
[49:23] signs and wonders I've had signs and
[49:24] wonders in my life and my family's life
[49:26] and these different things but those
[49:28] things follow the believer they do not
[49:30] lead the way
[49:31] so often what I'm finding is being
[49:34] preached is that it's saying to do the
[49:35] Greater Works and the life isn't There
[49:38] Yet brother Brad I'm saying the greatest
[49:39] Miracle he does is he changes you from
[49:42] what you were what you are today to what
[49:44] you were before the foundation of the
[49:46] world he takes you back into the mind
[49:48] and the thoughts and attributes of God
[49:49] and he changes you into that and you
[49:51] walk in it willingly and there's no
[49:53] strife and there's no stress on the
[49:55] inner man because it's connected with
[49:57] God now and it's starting to grow out
[49:59] and the word is starting to come forth
[50:01] into your life amen you know when your
[50:03] life has been changed I say it so many
[50:05] times you know you know what your
[50:07] innermost thoughts are you know what
[50:08] your desires are you know where your
[50:10] head's at you know what your internal
[50:12] reaction is we only get to see the
[50:13] outside but you know when the Inner Man
[50:15] the inner woman has been changed and
[50:17] that's when you know you've passed from
[50:19] death into life is you see that you are
[50:21] not what you used to be you may not be
[50:23] what you're going to be but you're not
[50:24] what you used to be and that's what we
[50:26] can take rest in is that he's changing
[50:28] us from Glory into Glory line upon lie
[50:31] and word upon word don't get bogged down
[50:33] in the fact you're not there get get
[50:35] lifted up in the fact that you're not
[50:37] where you used to be that something has
[50:38] changed and you're walking and you've
[50:40] come from death into life amen what is
[50:42] it we sing that song it's Jesus on the
[50:44] inside working on the outside oh what a
[50:47] change in my life amen it's an outward
[50:49] expression of an inward work
[50:52] Brother Brad would say this when this
[50:54] body receives the spirit of God The
[50:56] Immortal Life inside of you it throws
[50:59] this body in subjection to God
[51:02] that means victory
[51:04] that means healing that means overcoming
[51:07] power that means your tongue is under
[51:09] control that means that your emotions
[51:11] don't Define how you respond to
[51:13] situations something is taken over and
[51:17] this thing that used to control us now
[51:18] no longer has control
[51:21] he says hallelujah he that's born of God
[51:24] did not commit sin he cannot sin Romans
[51:27] 8 1 there's therefore now no
[51:29] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[51:31] Jesus they walk not after the flesh but
[51:33] after the spirit there you are see that
[51:36] throws your body subject you don't have
[51:38] to say oh if I could just quit drinking
[51:41] or if I could just look you'll stop
[51:43] looking at that website or if I could
[51:45] just get away from these friends or if I
[51:47] could stop this and that all this temper
[51:49] if I could get away he says you don't
[51:51] have to do that but getting Christ and
[51:54] it's all gone see because your body is
[51:57] subject to the spirit it's not more
[51:59] subject to the things of the world
[52:00] they're dead they are dead your sins are
[52:03] buried in baptism and you are a new
[52:06] creation in Christ
[52:09] he says in your body becoming subject to
[52:12] the spirit tries to live a right kind of
[52:14] life and then when you become subject to
[52:17] that Spirit it throws your whole being
[52:20] not just your body your whole being
[52:25] your five outer senses your five inner
[52:28] senses your mind your thoughts your
[52:29] opinions your words everything gets tied
[52:32] in it throws your whole being subject to
[52:34] that spirit and that spirit is nothing
[52:37] in the world but this seed word made
[52:40] manifest or quickened and made alive and
[52:44] when the Bible says don't do this that
[52:46] body quickly turns to it
[52:49] quickly turns to it
[52:53] quickly turns to it
[52:56] there is no question and what is it it's
[52:59] the earnest of the Resurrection this
[53:02] body will be raised up again why because
[53:05] it's already started
[53:08] it was once subject to sin and mire and
[53:11] Corruption but now it's got the earnest
[53:12] it's turned heavenly
[53:16] that's why the scripture says you are
[53:18] now in Heavenly places in Christ because
[53:21] you have been turned into a Heavenly
[53:23] realm you've been turned into a Heavenly
[53:25] creature you're caught in time but
[53:27] you're a Heavenly creature we are
[53:28] supernatural creatures having a natural
[53:31] experience
[53:33] he says now he says that's the earnest
[53:36] that you're going in the Rapture let me
[53:37] encourage you this morning the reason
[53:39] you're going in the resurrection is
[53:41] because he's already started it in you
[53:43] that's why you're going is because he
[53:45] who started a work and you will be
[53:47] faithful to complete it that he's done a
[53:49] work he started a work and he doesn't
[53:51] start anything that he's not going to
[53:53] finish
[53:54] because why he's God he can't change his
[53:56] mind he can't start and not finish he
[53:58] can't say it's going to be and then let
[54:00] it not be he's come in and as soon as he
[54:02] starts working your life then he's going
[54:04] to finish these things amen and what did
[54:06] he do he took you to a place where you
[54:08] sat maybe for so long and you couldn't
[54:10] hear the word but then he opened your
[54:12] eyes to see and he opened your ears to
[54:14] hear and he gave you a heart that could
[54:15] receive it and as soon as you did that
[54:17] as soon as he did that in your life now
[54:19] something starts to Quicken and it
[54:21] starts to come up inside of you and once
[54:23] it starts coming up Church there's no
[54:24] way it can die why because he says it's
[54:27] right here it's nothing less than the
[54:30] seed of God the gene of God inside of
[54:32] you coming out what is it you're built
[54:34] for this you're made for this and that
[54:36] means you're going to do it
[54:38] he gave you the earnest the down payment
[54:40] he says that's the the down payment the
[54:42] earnest of the Resurrection The Rapture
[54:44] is the change he started in your life
[54:46] Paul said in Philippians he says being
[54:49] confident of this very thing that we he
[54:51] which had begun a good work in you will
[54:54] perform it unto the day of Christ Church
[54:56] be confident today be thankful be joyous
[54:59] be happy be at peace be at rest because
[55:02] if what your confidence is in what he
[55:05] has started if you know he started the
[55:07] work then you can be confident he's
[55:09] going to finish it but you've got to be
[55:11] confident he started it you've got to be
[55:14] confident he started not that you sit in
[55:16] church not that you hear the preaching
[55:17] of the word but that the word has come
[55:19] in and been quickened inside of you he's
[55:20] filled you with the Holy Spirit that's
[55:22] what you're confident in you've got to
[55:24] know that you've got the holy spirit
[55:25] because that is your typos that is your
[55:27] anchor your anchor is not God's son of
[55:30] prophet your anchor is God sent a
[55:31] prophet to me behold I send you Elijah
[55:35] and he has come to you and the Holy
[55:37] Spirit has spoken to the church and
[55:38] you've received the word you've you've
[55:40] done what Acts 2 38 says and that has
[55:43] made the word come alive in you not that
[55:45] you've heard it but it has made you live
[55:47] now and it's changed who you are from
[55:49] what you used to be how by the very life
[55:52] that was in him the eternal life that he
[55:53] laid down on the cross it's come back
[55:56] that life left that body and that body
[55:58] could die but that life could never die
[56:00] that Natural Body could go into the
[56:02] grave but that Life of Christ went into
[56:04] a theophany body when he died that life
[56:07] had to go somewhere and then and it was
[56:09] one it was a theophany like he had at
[56:11] the beginning and then what did he do he
[56:13] went down into hell and he preached to
[56:14] souls that are in prison and then he
[56:16] went down he took the keys of death and
[56:18] Hell In The Grave and then on the third
[56:20] day he rose again in that theophany
[56:22] merged with this flesh and it glorified
[56:24] that body and he came back and he
[56:25] started talking to us again
[56:28] brother I would say this he said this
[56:29] when a man is Born Again from heaven
[56:33] you've got an origin church you've got a
[56:35] place that you're coming from and if you
[56:37] have a place you're coming from then
[56:38] your Redemption is taking you back to
[56:40] that place origin is Destiny the prophet
[56:42] of God would say you've got to realize
[56:44] that you're going back to something that
[56:46] this is not your starting place
[56:48] this is just the middle of the journey
[56:50] he says when he a man is Born Again from
[56:52] Heaven he becomes a spirit babe in
[56:55] Christ and then when this robe of flesh
[56:57] is dropped there's a natural body a
[56:59] theophany that's your natural state
[57:01] church is in a theophany
[57:05] that's where you are when the sons of
[57:07] God shouted for Joy was in a theophany
[57:10] that's your real man that's the real
[57:12] woman that's the real child of God is in
[57:14] a theophan or brother Braham says that's
[57:16] your natural place
[57:17] so that means this is unnatural to us
[57:21] it's got to feel unnatural if it's
[57:23] feeling uncomfortable today that's good
[57:25] because guess what if you're a child of
[57:27] hell if you're a child of Satan this
[57:29] feels really normal
[57:33] he says there's a natural body a
[57:35] theophany a body not made with hands
[57:38] neither born of a woman that we go to
[57:40] then that body returns back and picks up
[57:43] the glorified body so you take a
[57:45] theophany and you put it in perfect you
[57:47] put it in sinless flesh and it makes a
[57:49] glorified body your theophonic body
[57:52] drops into a fleshly body but it's not
[57:54] like this body
[57:55] but it is flesh you can still eat and it
[57:57] can drink and when you put those two
[57:58] together you're glorified
[58:00] when your Heavenly Body merges with a
[58:02] flesh body you become a glorified body
[58:04] that's what he's saying he says that's
[58:06] the reason Jesus went to hell when he
[58:08] died and preached to the souls that were
[58:10] in prison he says he turned back into
[58:13] that theophany
[58:15] that's what he did
[58:17] now we're going to go back to our
[58:18] opening scripture to dig into this a
[58:20] little bit more today that's just
[58:21] setting a foundation for it so we go to
[58:23] John 17 and this is Jesus and he's in
[58:25] the Garden of Gethsemane remember
[58:27] it says in these words spoke Jesus and
[58:29] lifted up his eyes to heaven and said
[58:31] father the hour is come glorify thy son
[58:34] that thy son may also glorify thee
[58:37] remember Jesus has already had his
[58:39] adoption ceremony he's already had a
[58:41] glorification experience or taste on
[58:43] Mount Transfiguration but now he's
[58:45] stepping into a different glorification
[58:48] now he's stepping into a different level
[58:50] now he's stepping into a higher plane
[58:52] and he says its purpose is to glorify
[58:54] the father
[58:56] not to glorify me our glorification is
[58:59] not for ourself
[59:00] it's to glorify the one that gives us
[59:02] his glory he says as thou has given him
[59:06] Power Over All Flesh that he should give
[59:09] eternal life to as many as thou has
[59:11] given him you know the scripture brother
[59:12] Brown would say that we give eternal
[59:14] life to people
[59:15] we don't give eternal life to them he
[59:17] says what you do is you give them the
[59:18] opportunity you give them the word you
[59:20] give them your life you give them your
[59:22] testimony he says that's where the
[59:24] eternal life comes from that's how you
[59:25] impart eternal life is you give somebody
[59:27] the word and they accept it you didn't
[59:29] give it to them but you gave them the
[59:31] means to it the word is life
[59:33] amen the word is life and that's what
[59:35] we're giving to him but what Jesus is
[59:37] saying you gave me Power Over All Flesh
[59:39] to impart it he says and this is life
[59:42] eternal this is what he gave that they
[59:44] may Know Thee the only true God and
[59:47] Jesus Christ whom thou has sent he says
[59:49] I have glorified thee on the Earth
[59:53] so there's a glorification that happens
[59:54] down here
[59:56] and if he did it then we've got to do it
[59:59] and if he had it then we have it
[1:00:01] he says but but what I have finished the
[1:00:04] work which thou gavest me to do the work
[1:00:06] of an adopted son is to finish the work
[1:00:09] there's a work that's laid out after
[1:00:11] that ceremony and adopted Sons finished
[1:00:13] the work that they were given
[1:00:15] can you say this morning you may not be
[1:00:16] done it I don't believe any of us have
[1:00:18] done it but have you started your work
[1:00:20] is there something that he's asked you
[1:00:22] to do is there a place that he's asked
[1:00:23] you to be and are you stepping into that
[1:00:25] role into your adopted son role can you
[1:00:28] say God I'm not done but I'm started
[1:00:30] I'm started I'm doing what you asked me
[1:00:32] to do I'm doing it to the best that I
[1:00:34] know how
[1:00:35] let us at least be saying Lord we've
[1:00:36] started the work you've given us
[1:00:39] and then he says and now oh Father
[1:00:41] glorify thou me with thine own self with
[1:00:45] the glory which I have with thee before
[1:00:47] the world was
[1:00:49] what a request glorify me with thine own
[1:00:52] self
[1:00:53] what was it what was he saying he was
[1:00:55] taking it back to his origin he says
[1:00:57] before the world began there was a glory
[1:00:59] I had with you and that's what I'm
[1:01:01] looking for
[1:01:02] what is it it's a revelation of where he
[1:01:04] came from
[1:01:06] it's a revelation of who he was not just
[1:01:09] who he is
[1:01:11] what was he saying take me back he said
[1:01:13] take me back to my original place with
[1:01:15] you
[1:01:16] listen he was God incarnate he was God
[1:01:19] in flesh and Jesus was tired
[1:01:21] he was weary he was worn
[1:01:24] they said you're not a man of 50 Years
[1:01:26] yet but he looked 50 and he was 33.
[1:01:30] it was tough on Christ to be in that
[1:01:32] flesh body sinless though it was he was
[1:01:34] surrounded by unbelief he was surrounded
[1:01:36] by sin he was surrounded by Temptation
[1:01:38] and he's saying here God don't leave me
[1:01:41] here
[1:01:42] don't leave me in this condition take me
[1:01:44] back to my original place
[1:01:46] we've got to pray the same thing Church
[1:01:48] God don't leave me here
[1:01:51] even under the blood even with no
[1:01:53] condemnation this is a miserable place
[1:01:55] to be
[1:01:56] amen God take me back to where I was
[1:01:58] before the world began take me back to
[1:02:00] my position in you I know I've got a
[1:02:02] work to do here but when that's done
[1:02:04] Lord don't leave me here take me back to
[1:02:07] that place of perfect rest that perfect
[1:02:09] love that joy unspeakable amen he says I
[1:02:13] have manifested thy name unto the men
[1:02:15] which thou gavest me out of the world
[1:02:17] thine they were and thou gavest them me
[1:02:20] and they have kept Thy word now they
[1:02:22] have known that all things whatsoever
[1:02:24] thou has given me are of thee now I want
[1:02:26] to stop here real quickly because just
[1:02:29] touch on it for the second he says I
[1:02:30] have manifested thy name
[1:02:32] in other words he says I have revealed
[1:02:34] the very self of God that's what that
[1:02:36] means
[1:02:37] I personally have revealed you
[1:02:41] what a thing to say Church
[1:02:44] and he was the firstborn of many
[1:02:45] Brethren that we're going to reveal the
[1:02:47] very self-same God
[1:02:49] we're not just talking about Jesus we're
[1:02:51] talking about you and I because we're in
[1:02:52] him we're like him we're supposed to be
[1:02:55] like him we're supposed to be reflecting
[1:02:56] the things he went through amen it's
[1:02:59] critical That Glory that we understand
[1:03:00] this idea that glorification is God
[1:03:02] revealed in US
[1:03:04] that's what glorification is it's God
[1:03:07] stepping down into flesh it's God
[1:03:09] stepping down into this Earthly creature
[1:03:11] and manifesting himself showing himself
[1:03:13] that's the glorification of God and
[1:03:15] Jesus is saying listen I've proven you
[1:03:17] to be alive I've proven you to be well
[1:03:19] and we've got to be able to say the same
[1:03:21] thing he's alive and well living in me
[1:03:23] to tell the world that he is still the
[1:03:25] same amen
[1:03:27] again we're not going to spend too much
[1:03:29] time on this but the sun always takes
[1:03:31] the name of the father
[1:03:33] in God's line
[1:03:35] and we'll talk about how John didn't
[1:03:37] take his father's name
[1:03:38] and we'll see God Jesus gave Simon Peter
[1:03:41] a name change and these different things
[1:03:42] why to call them into a new line of duty
[1:03:45] to call them into a place that God had
[1:03:47] called for them amen but the son is
[1:03:49] always the reflection of the father
[1:03:51] there's no one else in there it's just
[1:03:53] the father it's his DNA it's the same
[1:03:55] thing and so if it's the same DNA then
[1:03:57] how can you be anything but but the same
[1:03:58] as your father you can't do it that's
[1:04:00] why brother Brown would talk about the
[1:04:01] seed of God the sea Gene of God inside
[1:04:03] of you how can you be anything less than
[1:04:05] God if that's what's inside of you you
[1:04:07] can't but that's what we're growing into
[1:04:09] amen
[1:04:11] but Jesus is looking back a long ways
[1:04:13] and he's looking back past time he's
[1:04:15] looking all the way back to Eternity and
[1:04:17] he's looking back to the very beginning
[1:04:19] of things to the very start of these
[1:04:21] things because Jesus was a lot of things
[1:04:22] before this
[1:04:24] here's a lot of things he was
[1:04:25] Melchizedek he was a pillar of fire he
[1:04:28] was a pillar of cloud he was a burning
[1:04:29] bush he was the angel of the Lord he was
[1:04:31] all these things but he's saying take me
[1:04:33] all the way back to the very beginning
[1:04:35] we have to remember though that he's got
[1:04:37] to fulfill every purpose before he can
[1:04:39] go back and you and I have to do the
[1:04:41] same thing we're being restored back but
[1:04:43] there's a work for us to do down here
[1:04:44] and we're going to talk about that a
[1:04:45] little bit but we see in Revelation that
[1:04:47] he was a very particular thing in
[1:04:49] Revelation 13 8 it says and all that
[1:04:52] dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him
[1:04:53] whose names are not written in the book
[1:04:55] of the life of the lamb slain from the
[1:04:58] foundation of the world Jesus is saying
[1:05:00] take me back but as God is folding him
[1:05:02] back up to his origin he's got to go
[1:05:04] through that manifestation because he
[1:05:07] was a lamb slain before the foundation
[1:05:08] of the world so before he can go back to
[1:05:10] what he was at the very beginning he's
[1:05:12] got to go through that land
[1:05:13] manifestation he's got to go through
[1:05:14] that that sacrifice he's got to go
[1:05:16] through that laying down of his life
[1:05:18] he's got to be the slain lamb before he
[1:05:20] can go back to his great original
[1:05:21] position he's got to fulfill it all
[1:05:23] before he can go back to his origin
[1:05:27] brother Brown would say this he says now
[1:05:28] God gave himself birth to this son
[1:05:31] he didn't say he gave birth to himself
[1:05:33] he said he gave himself birth to his son
[1:05:36] as in something came out of him it says
[1:05:39] which was before there was even heir to
[1:05:41] make an atom see Jesus said glorify me
[1:05:43] father with the glory that we have
[1:05:45] before the foundation of the world see
[1:05:47] way back Yonder in Saint John 1 he said
[1:05:50] in the beginning was the word the Word
[1:05:52] was God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:05:54] dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself
[1:05:58] down to a human being so he's pointing
[1:06:01] back to the beginning unfolding himself
[1:06:03] all the way down to humanity and then he
[1:06:06] rolls himself all the way back up to God
[1:06:08] again so he's revealing himself he's
[1:06:11] unfolding himself he's showing himself
[1:06:13] he's letting us know who and what he is
[1:06:15] and then the idea is to roll it all back
[1:06:16] up into one in Christ at the very end of
[1:06:19] these things
[1:06:20] what was it he rolled it right back up
[1:06:21] to the Ascension of Jesus and then that
[1:06:23] body went up and he went to sit on the
[1:06:24] right hand of the Throne of God Amen
[1:06:26] that's the same thing that he's doing
[1:06:28] with us
[1:06:30] brother Brown says there was a time that
[1:06:32] you knew
[1:06:34] that you knew what who you were what you
[1:06:36] were he says but your mind is darkened
[1:06:39] to that now there's only been one man on
[1:06:42] Earth that knew that he was before and
[1:06:45] that was Jesus notice he didn't say knew
[1:06:47] who he was before he says he knew that
[1:06:49] he was before knew that he had a
[1:06:51] pre-existence knew that there was
[1:06:53] something before he came into this
[1:06:54] Consciousness before he drew a breath of
[1:06:56] life here
[1:06:57] what's he saying there's a pre-existence
[1:06:59] and if you were before
[1:07:02] you weren't just somewhere
[1:07:04] or something but you were someone
[1:07:07] right you were you were a an attribute
[1:07:10] you were an expression you were a nature
[1:07:12] you were something before you ever came
[1:07:14] here
[1:07:14] he says and he said glorify me Father
[1:07:17] which the glory that I have with you
[1:07:19] before the foundation of the world he
[1:07:22] says he was the Incarnate God he could
[1:07:25] move back there and know what it was but
[1:07:27] our minds are blackened there
[1:07:30] we've got to go through something here
[1:07:32] to restore our minds back so that we
[1:07:35] understand who and what we were in the
[1:07:36] beginning amen we have to go through a
[1:07:38] transformation and what's it doing it's
[1:07:40] giving us eyes to see more and more
[1:07:41] remember the scripture says we see
[1:07:43] through a glass Darkly but then we'll
[1:07:45] see him and will be known as he is
[1:07:47] we'll have a body like his and these
[1:07:49] different things and it's giving us ears
[1:07:50] to hear the word and it's starting to
[1:07:52] bring back the mind of Christ because
[1:07:54] the mind of Christ knew who he was
[1:07:56] before he ever came into this existence
[1:07:59] the mind of Christ in you will get you
[1:08:01] to understand who and what you were
[1:08:02] before the existence that you have today
[1:08:04] as well it's the same thing we've got to
[1:08:06] be able to realize just like Christ did
[1:08:08] we come from God and we are going back
[1:08:10] to God and that's the path we're on
[1:08:12] today we're not going to this end of
[1:08:14] this life we're going back to God Amen
[1:08:16] and whether we go in Rapture whether we
[1:08:17] go in Resurrection however it works what
[1:08:19] is it we're restored back to our
[1:08:21] original position in Christ amen
[1:08:25] our minds can't really grasp that
[1:08:28] that's why it's got to be a revelation
[1:08:29] we can't stop and think we can't grasp
[1:08:31] this idea that we come from something
[1:08:33] but yet we've got to grasp it there's
[1:08:35] got to be a revelation of who and what
[1:08:36] we are and that there was something
[1:08:38] before this and it's just a little bit
[1:08:39] every day
[1:08:40] it's a little step every day you step
[1:08:42] into that word a little bit more you
[1:08:44] believe it a little bit more and you
[1:08:45] start to recognize things and how do you
[1:08:47] recognize it because the word starts to
[1:08:49] happen in your life
[1:08:50] and so if a little bit will happen then
[1:08:52] you know that the rest will happen as
[1:08:54] well and it starts to build your faith
[1:08:55] up build your faith up and pretty soon
[1:08:57] you have rapturing faith I say soon
[1:08:59] through this life you build up to
[1:09:00] rapturing Faith because the word has
[1:09:02] been made flesh and you over and over
[1:09:04] and over again like I said before I
[1:09:07] believe that last step will be the
[1:09:08] easiest one
[1:09:09] it'll just be like that
[1:09:11] Lord I'm coming home
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:15] we're ordained to be Overcomers here
[1:09:17] we're ordained to be Victors here we're
[1:09:18] ordained to go through the things we're
[1:09:20] doing amen but it's a finished work in
[1:09:22] God's eyes but we're creatures of time
[1:09:25] and so we've got to go through this
[1:09:26] trial process we've got to go through
[1:09:27] this this time of of proving who we are
[1:09:30] and what we are and letting us see what
[1:09:32] it is so that will recognize our place
[1:09:33] and recognize our family line but
[1:09:36] there's still a glory that's given to us
[1:09:37] here amen as Christ had a glory even
[1:09:39] before his adoption and there was a
[1:09:41] glory after his adoption we have it as
[1:09:43] well and it's been a revealing of God in
[1:09:45] his bride for over two thousand years
[1:09:47] but it was shown in the first church age
[1:09:49] with the apostles and the first you know
[1:09:51] the the day of Pentecost and these
[1:09:53] different things and then it went down
[1:09:55] into a valley and then it's coming up to
[1:09:56] this last stage and it's Omega Alpha's
[1:09:59] Omega and he's what he's revealing
[1:10:00] himself once more
[1:10:02] and so there's a glory that's being
[1:10:04] revealed in each every one of us and
[1:10:06] what does it do he gives us the Holy
[1:10:07] Spirit first to help us to believe the
[1:10:09] word
[1:10:10] than to act on the word so that we will
[1:10:12] live the word and when we live the word
[1:10:14] we become the word
[1:10:16] that's it it's a simple process
[1:10:19] it's a simple process you know I was
[1:10:21] thinking about this the other day
[1:10:22] Satan doesn't have to get his children
[1:10:25] to feed
[1:10:27] they feed very naturally on the things
[1:10:29] of this world on the mess and the filth
[1:10:31] and everything out there they feed very
[1:10:32] naturally and he's trying to cram that
[1:10:35] down our throats
[1:10:37] but the thing is as Sons and Daughters
[1:10:39] of God
[1:10:40] we ought to be able to feed just as
[1:10:41] effortlessly on the word of God
[1:10:44] that ought to be something that
[1:10:46] satisfies us in a way that nothing else
[1:10:48] can
[1:10:49] that ought to be something that draws us
[1:10:51] to it that there's our Natural Instinct
[1:10:53] our nature is to feed on the good things
[1:10:56] of God
[1:10:57] amen you can't express God and flesh if
[1:11:00] you're feeding on something else
[1:11:02] can't do it you can't do it
[1:11:05] brother Bram says this he says the great
[1:11:07] Fountain of all eternity was that Spirit
[1:11:09] of love joy listen to this that Spirit
[1:11:13] of honesty
[1:11:15] I'll tell you what church I need a
[1:11:17] spirit of honesty
[1:11:19] so that I can say Lord I'm not where I
[1:11:23] ought to be
[1:11:24] because that's the starting point
[1:11:26] remember we've spoken that this is the
[1:11:28] Zeal of this age is to repent and to
[1:11:30] repent means to say that I'm not where
[1:11:32] the word says I ought to be
[1:11:34] a spirit of Honesty will help us to look
[1:11:36] in the mirror of the word and say that's
[1:11:39] not me yet I believe I'm the word but
[1:11:42] Lord there's a work to be done
[1:11:44] and that Spirit Will Keep Us true to the
[1:11:46] word and it'll keep us coming back and
[1:11:48] checking up in our lives day in and day
[1:11:50] out amen it'll keep us in Fellowship
[1:11:52] it'll keep us with our brothers and
[1:11:54] sisters that can give us that honest
[1:11:56] feedback that'll help us to see when
[1:11:58] we're maybe turning a bit to the right
[1:11:59] or to the left a spirit of honesty the
[1:12:02] spirit of trueness in this Perfection
[1:12:04] and then out of the existence of the
[1:12:06] father went to logos which was the son
[1:12:09] which was a theophany which was the body
[1:12:11] of the great Jehovah God went forth in a
[1:12:13] Celestial body that's the logos the word
[1:12:16] spoke out of them great Fountains of
[1:12:18] life and went forth and there was the
[1:12:20] theophany which was God made into word
[1:12:24] then that theophany was made flesh in
[1:12:27] the person Christ Jesus and then all the
[1:12:29] fullness of the trinity dwelt in him
[1:12:31] both Father Son and Holy Spirit in all
[1:12:33] that I'm going to I'm going to explain
[1:12:35] this just in a second
[1:12:37] but I want to set the foundation
[1:12:38] scripturally here he says in John 4 it
[1:12:41] says God is a spirit and they that
[1:12:44] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[1:12:46] and in truth so what brother Brown I'm
[1:12:48] saying here I'll go back is he's saying
[1:12:49] in the beginning that God the Father the
[1:12:51] great Elohim the self-existing one he
[1:12:54] says he wasn't even God then because
[1:12:55] there was nobody to worship him because
[1:12:57] God is an object of worship he says he
[1:13:00] had these thoughts and he had these
[1:13:01] ideas and those ideas were what we call
[1:13:04] the word
[1:13:06] the word is the thoughts of God the word
[1:13:08] is the intentions of God the word is the
[1:13:10] will of God and and he says that word is
[1:13:12] the expression of God in thought form
[1:13:15] but then he says the word was spoken it
[1:13:18] was expressed within God he doesn't even
[1:13:20] say it was spoken it was expressed
[1:13:21] within God he says and then that life of
[1:13:24] God went out and it became the logos and
[1:13:26] the logos is just the form the shape the
[1:13:29] image of the thought
[1:13:31] it's a body it's a vessel if we could
[1:13:33] put it that way not a physical body like
[1:13:35] we have but it's a vessel for God to be
[1:13:37] in that's the logos that's the life of
[1:13:39] God coming out and forming this image or
[1:13:41] this vessel and then God stepped into
[1:13:43] that form and brother Abraham says that
[1:13:45] form now was the word of God expressed
[1:13:48] and he says that was Christ
[1:13:51] God is a spirit you'll never see God
[1:13:54] except in the expressed form of Christ
[1:13:57] and so what he was saying was he said
[1:13:58] God gave himself birth
[1:14:01] God brought something out that life out
[1:14:03] of himself and created a form Christ
[1:14:05] steps into it and now that is God
[1:14:06] incarnate in a body
[1:14:08] in a shell in a vessel if you want to
[1:14:10] talk about it that way it was visible it
[1:14:13] was light it could be seen
[1:14:15] you can see that in Genesis 1 it was a
[1:14:16] light it was it could be seen and it
[1:14:19] could be interacted with but not in the
[1:14:20] way we interact now it was a Celestial
[1:14:22] body it was a Heavenly Body it can be
[1:14:25] seen and we can recognize that it's
[1:14:27] there but it does not touch us or
[1:14:28] interact with us it would go through us
[1:14:29] if you tried to shake the pillar Fire's
[1:14:31] hand you would feel nothing in and of
[1:14:33] yourself there's no form to touch but
[1:14:36] yet it is the image of God it is the
[1:14:37] expressed image of God in these things
[1:14:39] it's like the burning bush experience
[1:14:40] with Moses that was the image of God in
[1:14:43] a burning bush and the bush burned but
[1:14:46] it was not consumed why because it was
[1:14:48] not interacting physically with the burn
[1:14:50] to cause it to burn it wasn't
[1:14:51] interacting with oxygen and these
[1:14:53] different things it was itself just
[1:14:55] sitting in that bush and it made it look
[1:14:57] like it was on fire it was theophonic it
[1:14:59] was a theophany body just hiding itself
[1:15:02] in that bush if we could put it that way
[1:15:05] brother Brown says this he says like
[1:15:07] someone was speaking the other day he
[1:15:08] said God what was he
[1:15:10] when he was back Yonder millions and
[1:15:13] millions of years ago you say we don't
[1:15:15] believe in that the Earth is millions
[1:15:16] and millions of years old all I can tell
[1:15:18] you is that brother Brown says that God
[1:15:20] was there millions and millions of years
[1:15:21] ago and whatever thing looked like
[1:15:23] through that time we don't know but
[1:15:24] listen to this he says and then he
[1:15:26] gathered up into the logos and then he
[1:15:28] came from the logos down into Christ
[1:15:30] Christ the flesh body
[1:15:33] he says and then he got down into Christ
[1:15:35] see it's just God coming down like this
[1:15:38] to the Earth and then going right back
[1:15:41] into God again God unfolding himself and
[1:15:44] then God rolling himself back up
[1:15:46] don't you see what I mean just revolving
[1:15:49] coming down from space from eternity
[1:15:51] rolling together coming down into the
[1:15:54] logos from the logos there into man then
[1:15:57] returning right back again for one
[1:15:59] purpose to redeem that man that had
[1:16:01] fallen now that's what he came for to be
[1:16:04] a redeemer that's why I say if he came
[1:16:06] down and he did signs and wonders and
[1:16:08] the prophet said did signs and wonders
[1:16:10] and he he did all his Doctrine and He
[1:16:12] restored the word but he didn't raise
[1:16:13] again then he missed out because he had
[1:16:15] to redeem us and Redemption requires
[1:16:17] blood
[1:16:19] he says now that's what he came for to
[1:16:21] be a redeemer and before God could be a
[1:16:24] redeemer he had to be according to the
[1:16:26] law a Kinsmen Redeemer he had to be Kim
[1:16:30] folks to us now we listen to that we say
[1:16:32] whoo that is wonderful that is amazing
[1:16:34] look at that revelation of God to see
[1:16:37] him in the plan and the manifestation of
[1:16:39] God but church you've got to see the
[1:16:41] purpose and you've got to see your place
[1:16:43] in all of that amen let's not just see
[1:16:44] the revealing of God through Christ
[1:16:46] we've got to see the revealing of God
[1:16:48] through us as well notice he said he had
[1:16:50] to be kin folks to us and we look and we
[1:16:52] say yes he became Kim Folks by becoming
[1:16:54] flesh but he had to be Kinfolk with us
[1:16:57] in the beginning to be Kim folk with us
[1:16:59] back here we had to be Kinfolk to him in
[1:17:01] the beginning so he could come down and
[1:17:03] become folk to us now
[1:17:04] amen we were kin folk with him because
[1:17:06] we were in Christ before the foundation
[1:17:08] of the world then we dropped into flesh
[1:17:10] and so he had to drop in the flesh to
[1:17:12] redeem us down here to bring us back to
[1:17:14] our Kinfolk relationship up there as
[1:17:16] well
[1:17:17] he's Kinfolk here because we were Kim
[1:17:19] folk back there
[1:17:20] he doesn't just magically become our kin
[1:17:22] down here but he was always our Kinsmen
[1:17:25] Redeemer he was always us amen we were
[1:17:27] always in him if he was then so were we
[1:17:30] if he is now then so are we and if he is
[1:17:32] going to be in the future so are we
[1:17:34] because we are kin with him we're tied
[1:17:36] to him we're a part of him in these
[1:17:38] things it's Jesus Christ the same
[1:17:40] yesterday today and forever all the way
[1:17:43] back to the beginning and going all the
[1:17:44] way into eternity amen
[1:17:47] our glory is in our origin
[1:17:51] that's why we shouted them in the
[1:17:52] beginning
[1:17:54] we're in glory
[1:17:56] we were glorified we were with him we
[1:17:58] were in full and open relationship we
[1:18:00] were in Perfection that's where our
[1:18:02] glorious so our goal has to be to get
[1:18:03] back to there and not try and do
[1:18:05] something here
[1:18:07] he says that's the very way we go
[1:18:10] so I said don't forget that you're a
[1:18:11] part of this we go Plumb back to the
[1:18:14] original beginning of God
[1:18:16] there we are born again not a flesh born
[1:18:19] again not of blood but Born Again by the
[1:18:22] spirit and in that
[1:18:23] eternal spirit of love and honesty it
[1:18:26] comes down to make its place in us here
[1:18:28] and now and then when we die from this
[1:18:31] life we go into the body he says which
[1:18:33] if this Earthly Tabernacles dissolve we
[1:18:36] have a theophany to go into a body
[1:18:38] Celestial that at the coming of the Lord
[1:18:40] Jesus this body is picked up from the
[1:18:42] Earth again and made in a glorified
[1:18:44] State what is it it's full of quickening
[1:18:47] power it's full of eternal life it's on
[1:18:49] hinder by anything it's without sin it's
[1:18:51] perfect we are made in a glorified state
[1:18:53] to live in his presence forever
[1:18:56] now brother Brown goes in to explain
[1:18:58] this in the message called who is this
[1:18:59] Melchizedek he says you came like Adam
[1:19:01] like me you became from the attribute so
[1:19:05] you came the ACT you were the thought of
[1:19:07] God the attribute of God you became the
[1:19:09] attribute to the flesh to be tempted but
[1:19:13] when this life is finished here if this
[1:19:15] Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have
[1:19:17] one already waiting that's where we go
[1:19:19] he says that is the word not just the
[1:19:22] word says it but that is the word we go
[1:19:24] back to being the word
[1:19:26] then when we go back we can look back
[1:19:29] and see what we did
[1:19:31] now we don't understand it
[1:19:35] you don't have to understand it all
[1:19:37] you can't you can't understand eternity
[1:19:39] we don't we're not built for that in the
[1:19:41] in the sense right now he says we have
[1:19:44] never become the word we've just become
[1:19:46] the flesh man not the word he says
[1:19:48] because Christ became the word and then
[1:19:49] the word was made flesh he says we
[1:19:50] dropped we skipped the word and came
[1:19:52] straight to flesh because of sin
[1:19:54] and so now we've got to be built back
[1:19:55] into the word
[1:19:58] he says but and look clearly makes it
[1:20:01] clear you will never be the word unless
[1:20:05] you were a thought at the beginning
[1:20:07] I've said this many times brother
[1:20:09] Brown's idea on predestination was very
[1:20:11] traditional very denominational if I
[1:20:13] could put it he said God knew what you
[1:20:15] would do and therefore he predestinated
[1:20:16] you but now after the seals opens up he
[1:20:18] comes back and he says no no no you are
[1:20:20] in the thoughts of God
[1:20:22] you're in the mind of God you are an
[1:20:24] attribute of God you are a part of God
[1:20:28] and because of that you will have
[1:20:30] eternal life you are eternal life
[1:20:33] you're part of God in these different
[1:20:34] things he says that proves the
[1:20:37] predestination of God see so he says
[1:20:39] predestination but look it is changing
[1:20:41] now he grew in his Revelation Church
[1:20:44] we're allowed to grow
[1:20:45] we don't have just put our foot down and
[1:20:47] say this is what I believe and that's it
[1:20:48] no we grow in Grace and Truth Christ did
[1:20:51] it we'll grow in Grace and Truth as well
[1:20:53] he says you can't be the word unless
[1:20:56] you're a thought
[1:20:57] you had to be in the thinking first now
[1:21:00] remember God never changes his mind
[1:21:04] that means if he thought you in the
[1:21:05] beginning
[1:21:06] you're going to make it
[1:21:08] if you're in his mind if you're in his
[1:21:10] thoughts if you're in his attributes
[1:21:12] then that has to be expressed because
[1:21:13] he's coming back to roll it back up
[1:21:15] again all the way back to him but you
[1:21:18] see in order to stand Temptation you had
[1:21:20] to bypass the theophany you had to come
[1:21:22] down here in flesh to be tempted by sin
[1:21:24] and then if you stand he says all the
[1:21:27] father had given me will come to me and
[1:21:29] I will raise him up in the last days see
[1:21:32] he says you had to be
[1:21:34] first
[1:21:36] you had to exist first you had to have a
[1:21:38] pre-existence you had to be somewhere
[1:21:39] else before you came here to go back to
[1:21:41] where you were
[1:21:43] the the children of this world the
[1:21:46] children of Satan a child of hell has no
[1:21:48] origin
[1:21:49] they're just here that's the effect of
[1:21:51] serpency that's the effect of of seed
[1:21:53] being sown in the field by an evil man
[1:21:55] they have nothing to go back to and so
[1:21:58] they go to destruction except for those
[1:21:59] that are granted eternal life based on
[1:22:01] what they do for the bride
[1:22:03] based on whether or not they make a free
[1:22:05] will decision to accept the finished
[1:22:06] work of Calvary they'll never get the
[1:22:08] Holy Ghost they can't because the Holy
[1:22:10] Ghost is eternal life and you can't get
[1:22:11] it unless you already had it
[1:22:14] but we preach it to all because we don't
[1:22:16] know who's in and we don't know who's
[1:22:18] out
[1:22:19] he says you had to be first and then you
[1:22:22] see he come right down the regular line
[1:22:23] from attribute to flesh before the
[1:22:26] foundation of the world his names put on
[1:22:28] the Lamb's Book of Life then from that
[1:22:30] he become the word the theophany that
[1:22:32] could appear and disappear
[1:22:33] that's what brother Brown says when we
[1:22:35] go back we'll be able to travel like a
[1:22:36] thought we can move from here to there
[1:22:38] because what we're in perfect form we're
[1:22:40] the word again
[1:22:42] he says and then he become flesh and
[1:22:43] return back again resurrected that same
[1:22:46] body in a glorified condition but you
[1:22:48] bypass the theophany and become flesh
[1:22:50] man to be tempted by sin and then at
[1:22:53] this Earthly Tabernacles the dissolve we
[1:22:55] have one already waiting we have not yet
[1:22:57] the bodies
[1:22:59] but look he says when this body receives
[1:23:01] the spirit of God The Immortal Life
[1:23:03] inside of you it throws this body in
[1:23:05] subjection to God and we read the rest
[1:23:07] of that quote a little earlier
[1:23:08] now remember in John 17 Jesus was
[1:23:11] praying In The Garden of Gethsemane and
[1:23:12] he was saying God take me back to where
[1:23:14] I was originally don't let me go through
[1:23:16] all of this and then leave me hanging
[1:23:19] take me back to where I was I've got a
[1:23:21] work to do but I've got to go back to my
[1:23:23] eternal glory My Cry is to go back to
[1:23:25] what I have with you in the beginning
[1:23:27] that's where I belong we sing that song
[1:23:29] in your presence that's where I belong
[1:23:33] I'm kind of homesick for a country
[1:23:36] Christ was singing his Beulah Land here
[1:23:39] he was saying take me back to where I
[1:23:41] had that complete and open Fellowship
[1:23:43] without any of this mess around me
[1:23:47] that's why you need a prayer Life Church
[1:23:50] to get away from the mess
[1:23:52] to get tied in to fall in love with the
[1:23:54] presence of God to fall in love with
[1:23:55] Christ where everything else disappears
[1:23:59] and you can have that communion that
[1:24:00] draws you in and once you get it you'll
[1:24:03] never ever enjoy the taste of anything
[1:24:05] else
[1:24:06] once you get it that Sweet Hour of
[1:24:08] Prayer when you learn what it means
[1:24:12] to have a Sweet Hour of Prayer
[1:24:15] to know that he's there
[1:24:17] to know that he's talking to you
[1:24:20] you don't ever want to go back
[1:24:23] you don't want to take anybody's word
[1:24:24] for it
[1:24:25] you want to take somebody's opinion for
[1:24:27] it
[1:24:28] you want to go back in his presence
[1:24:31] that's what Christ was saying
[1:24:34] what are we crying for today
[1:24:37] brother Brahm says he says there's one
[1:24:39] sign he says of the Holy Ghost he says
[1:24:41] and if there's sign and crying for the
[1:24:44] Abominations that are done in this world
[1:24:46] does it grieve us to be here
[1:24:49] does it Vex us to be here does it like
[1:24:52] you know not like lot who's whose
[1:24:54] righteous Soul was vexed but he wouldn't
[1:24:56] leave it
[1:24:57] but does it Vex Us in the way of vexed
[1:24:58] Abraham so that he stayed out of it
[1:25:00] completely
[1:25:01] that he wouldn't go into these things
[1:25:02] amen I I when I every time I travel
[1:25:05] because I get to work from home so often
[1:25:08] and I work with a pretty good group of
[1:25:09] people and I don't get to be out but boy
[1:25:11] when you're going out and you're sitting
[1:25:12] on airplanes and you're walking through
[1:25:13] airports and you're sitting in
[1:25:15] restaurants and
[1:25:16] Church where he Grieves me when I see
[1:25:18] what passes for clothing today
[1:25:20] it Grieves me what passes for politics
[1:25:22] it Grieves me what passes for
[1:25:24] entertainment it Grieves me what passes
[1:25:26] for sanity today and the more and it
[1:25:29] doesn't take long
[1:25:30] two and a half days out in the world
[1:25:32] and it ought to make it very obvious
[1:25:34] this world is not my home I'm a pilgrim
[1:25:37] I'm a stranger here there is zero draw
[1:25:40] for me here in this world if this is
[1:25:42] what the good life looks like kill me
[1:25:44] now
[1:25:45] it's not there people are striving and
[1:25:47] they're pushing and they're pressing
[1:25:49] into Insanity they're feeding on it
[1:25:52] they're gobbling it up because it's in
[1:25:53] their nature to do it
[1:25:55] and yet we've got to keep a right
[1:25:56] attitude towards them all because we
[1:25:58] don't know who is and isn't a child of
[1:26:00] God
[1:26:01] it out of Vex our righteous soul but not
[1:26:03] in a way that would tell us keep us away
[1:26:05] from being a witness keep us from being
[1:26:07] a testimony keep a keep us away from
[1:26:09] giving an expression of what Christ has
[1:26:10] done in our life we've got to be able to
[1:26:12] walk in it not lose our patience not
[1:26:14] lose our peace not lose our rest
[1:26:16] but to have a heart that's open towards
[1:26:18] people that we could tell them about a
[1:26:20] Christ that's changed our lives amen I
[1:26:22] want to get out of here
[1:26:23] I believe like Jesus Lord restore me
[1:26:25] back to where I'm supposed to be don't
[1:26:28] leave me down here don't let me just
[1:26:29] work down here and give of myself here
[1:26:31] and then leave me hanging but Lord take
[1:26:32] me back there's a cry for something
[1:26:34] that's greater than what I have right
[1:26:36] here
[1:26:37] but if there's a cry to have a greater
[1:26:39] relationship Lord there's got to be what
[1:26:41] a relationship developing here it can't
[1:26:44] all wait for over their Church
[1:26:46] there's an invisible Union that's
[1:26:48] happening with Christ and the bride that
[1:26:50] means there has to be moments of
[1:26:51] intimacy
[1:26:53] with just you and him
[1:26:55] where it's just you and Christ Alone in
[1:26:57] that room
[1:26:58] and you know that he's there and you
[1:27:00] know that he's working in your life amen
[1:27:04] Romans 8 23 says and not only they but
[1:27:07] ourselves also which have the first
[1:27:09] fruits of the spirit
[1:27:11] or the first fruits of the spirit love
[1:27:13] joy peace patience kindness goodness
[1:27:14] what all these different things he says
[1:27:17] even we ourselves grow within ourselves
[1:27:19] brother John you say that you're going
[1:27:21] to be groaning even though you have the
[1:27:22] Holy Spirit that's what will happen when
[1:27:24] you get the holy spirit is you will
[1:27:26] start to groan
[1:27:28] we sing that song thou Mighty Christ
[1:27:29] come forth in me
[1:27:32] my will my way I yield to thee the
[1:27:35] barren sing
[1:27:36] the travailing song
[1:27:39] why because pretty soon it won't be long
[1:27:43] because what there's something coming
[1:27:44] forth out of us Paul says you get that
[1:27:46] Spirit there's a groaning inside of us
[1:27:48] to get out of here to get back to what
[1:27:51] we are to get back to Who We Are
[1:27:53] he says we groan within ourselves he
[1:27:55] says waiting for the adoption
[1:27:58] because there's an adoption but there's
[1:28:00] a fullness of that adoption
[1:28:02] and the fullness of the adoption is when
[1:28:04] you've completed your work and you go
[1:28:05] back to him
[1:28:06] you and him become one he says waiting
[1:28:09] for the adoption he says to wit the
[1:28:11] Redemption of our body full Redemption
[1:28:14] is when we get a body change
[1:28:17] we're redeemed and we're given the Holy
[1:28:18] Spirit as an Earnest as a representation
[1:28:20] of what's going to happen we get a taste
[1:28:22] of it here we get a shadow of it here I
[1:28:24] don't doubt it for a moment even in
[1:28:26] adoption like I said before this is just
[1:28:28] me I believe it'll be a quick short work
[1:28:29] because with this world with social
[1:28:31] media and these different things you got
[1:28:33] manifested Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:34] walking around doing the things that
[1:28:36] they will do and they are doing
[1:28:38] when you get that in any sort of scale
[1:28:40] the world will see it at some point you
[1:28:42] won't be able to hide it
[1:28:43] you couldn't walk up and heal somebody
[1:28:45] in front of a temple or a gate or on the
[1:28:49] sidewalk without somebody videoing it in
[1:28:50] all probability or catching it on a
[1:28:52] closed circuit TV camera or something
[1:28:54] like that
[1:28:55] you can't do it
[1:28:57] but coming up to that
[1:28:59] there's something that's got to happen
[1:29:01] and that victory has to be over what
[1:29:03] this
[1:29:06] because in order for this to redeemed be
[1:29:08] redeemed it has to die completely
[1:29:11] die completely the biggest problem I've
[1:29:13] got today is Jonathan curlett the flesh
[1:29:16] that's the biggest thing I've got
[1:29:18] because it's on redeemed sinful body
[1:29:20] fights against my soul and the nature of
[1:29:22] God within me
[1:29:24] and so there's got to be a groaning that
[1:29:26] says get me out of this
[1:29:27] get me out of this battle get me out of
[1:29:29] this fight get me out of this pest house
[1:29:31] get me into that original rest amen what
[1:29:34] am I praying I'm praying Christ's prayer
[1:29:36] glorify me with the glory I had before
[1:29:38] the foundation of the world where I was
[1:29:40] right there with you and there was
[1:29:42] nothing in between
[1:29:44] you know I have a choice as to what gets
[1:29:46] between me and God
[1:29:48] you've got a choice as to what gets
[1:29:49] between you and God Church
[1:29:51] don't let it don't lay it on Satan sin
[1:29:53] say always he's done that we have a
[1:29:55] choice for everything we do in life
[1:29:57] everything we have if we let something
[1:29:59] get between us and God it's our choice
[1:30:01] God didn't put it there and Satan can't
[1:30:03] force it in there nothing can get
[1:30:05] between me and my wife unless I let it
[1:30:08] and nothing can get between me and
[1:30:09] Christ because we're in the same
[1:30:10] relationship unless I let it
[1:30:13] it's my choice
[1:30:15] whether it's work whether it's finances
[1:30:17] whether it's entertainment whether it's
[1:30:19] friendships relation whatever it might
[1:30:20] be whatever I get into if I let it get
[1:30:23] between him and me it's my choice
[1:30:26] so we can't go blaming it on somebody
[1:30:27] else
[1:30:29] we have a choice in those things so if
[1:30:31] we are surrounded by a mess
[1:30:33] let's clear out the mess
[1:30:35] that's our choice it's our choice it's
[1:30:38] our choice young people
[1:30:39] it's our choice what we have around us
[1:30:43] what am I praying for I'm praying Lord
[1:30:45] let me surrender
[1:30:46] let me die out let me give this up
[1:30:50] take me out of myself and take me back
[1:30:52] into you
[1:30:53] but Brian would say and now God in his
[1:30:55] great picture drama that we have under
[1:30:57] consideration this afternoon he brings
[1:30:59] in three Earthly Witnesses Peter James
[1:31:01] and John them from Heaven he brings
[1:31:03] three Heavenly witnesses to see what
[1:31:05] he's going to do he says oh I love to
[1:31:07] see Jehovah moving out to display his
[1:31:10] power and his grace oh it's so beautiful
[1:31:13] when you see him in his great power
[1:31:14] before he does it he will set on the
[1:31:18] sideline something some people some
[1:31:20] Believers to watch him display his great
[1:31:23] omnipotence
[1:31:25] did you know that we're spectators
[1:31:28] in the working of God in our lives
[1:31:31] because we know in ourselves there's no
[1:31:33] good thing we know that we can't do it
[1:31:34] and so we're literally Watching God do a
[1:31:37] miracle in our lives
[1:31:40] where I am today is a miracle compared
[1:31:43] to where I used to be
[1:31:45] and I believe the miracle is going to
[1:31:46] keep working until he takes me into
[1:31:47] Glory until he takes me into eternity he
[1:31:50] says God puts a witness there and you've
[1:31:51] got to be witness that something's going
[1:31:53] on
[1:31:54] he says and I notice him now as he
[1:31:57] brings from Heaven to watch The Scene
[1:31:58] Three Jesus Moses and Elijah he brings
[1:32:01] from the earth Peter James and John if
[1:32:03] I'm going to confirm this in the earth
[1:32:04] I'm going to confirm it in heaven also
[1:32:06] it's got to be a witness here on Earth
[1:32:08] and it's got to be a witness also in
[1:32:10] heaven notice now as he comes and then
[1:32:14] this had another meaning to it I know
[1:32:15] many of you my brethren you apply that
[1:32:17] to the coming of Christ he says that's
[1:32:19] right it was applied there the order
[1:32:22] excuse me of the coming of Christ now
[1:32:24] catch this
[1:32:25] it says as they looked they saw glorify
[1:32:28] Jesus we're talking about Glory revealed
[1:32:31] so the first thing they saw was glorify
[1:32:33] Jesus adoption is about glorification
[1:32:36] and we're seeing Christ glorified right
[1:32:39] there
[1:32:40] he says this is the order of the coming
[1:32:42] so if the coming of Christ looks the
[1:32:45] same as that then we've got to see a
[1:32:47] glory revealed in Christ
[1:32:49] in the second coming
[1:32:51] it's got to happen
[1:32:53] so it's only Christ though
[1:32:56] then he says and then they locked again
[1:32:58] and they saw Moses and Elijah the two
[1:33:01] witnesses revelation 11.
[1:33:05] what is it it's God going back to the
[1:33:06] Jews and the tribulation
[1:33:08] then they look back and seen Jesus only
[1:33:11] and this is the fully visible coming of
[1:33:13] Christ
[1:33:14] with his bride
[1:33:16] he says exactly the order the coming
[1:33:19] glorified Christ of preaching to the
[1:33:21] Jews and then Jesus coming with his
[1:33:22] bride exactly now catch this
[1:33:25] because he says there they saw a
[1:33:27] glorified Jesus first then they saw
[1:33:29] Moses and Elijah then they saw glorified
[1:33:31] Christ again
[1:33:33] so there's a glorified Christ that has
[1:33:34] to come he never touches foot on the
[1:33:36] earth in the second coming church he
[1:33:38] doesn't touch
[1:33:39] so how is he being revealed
[1:33:42] in flesh
[1:33:44] and you and me
[1:33:45] you and I are going to be the glorified
[1:33:47] Jesus Christ for this day
[1:33:49] not going to be we are
[1:33:52] and not everyone recognizes it and
[1:33:54] sometimes we don't even recognize it
[1:33:56] quite where we're at but we are the
[1:33:57] first glorification of his coming then
[1:34:00] he goes to the Jew or to the Gentiles
[1:34:02] and he's revealed in two witnesses
[1:34:05] and he seals 144 000 and then he comes
[1:34:08] back and it says then his glorified
[1:34:10] Christ again he says it's Jesus only the
[1:34:12] third time
[1:34:13] but scripture says he comes with Ten
[1:34:15] Thousand Times Ten Thousand of his
[1:34:16] Saints but it's Jesus only it's full
[1:34:19] unification it's perfect Unity now it's
[1:34:21] Christ and his bride are one and brother
[1:34:23] Branham I don't have the quote here
[1:34:24] we'll we'll maybe share it later he says
[1:34:26] it's full Unity perfect Unity Christ and
[1:34:28] his bride have become one
[1:34:30] so all they see is Jesus
[1:34:32] but it's in a multi-member body the
[1:34:33] second time
[1:34:35] but the glorification of Christ is in us
[1:34:37] today listen to this Ephesians 1 says
[1:34:39] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:34:41] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[1:34:43] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:34:45] places in Christ according as he has
[1:34:47] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:34:50] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:34:52] Without Blame before him in love
[1:34:54] that means we can ask him to glorify us
[1:34:57] this way church if he wrote this about
[1:34:59] us and we can say Lord restore us to
[1:35:01] that
[1:35:02] that's what Christ did Christ recognize
[1:35:04] his place in his position and he said
[1:35:05] restore me back to that so we can look
[1:35:07] at this in Ephesians 1 4 and say Lord
[1:35:10] take us back to this Lord take us back
[1:35:13] to being holy and Without Blame in love
[1:35:17] you can ask him to make you holy you can
[1:35:20] ask him to put the love of God in your
[1:35:22] life because he's already promised that
[1:35:23] that's where you were
[1:35:25] having predestinated us unto the
[1:35:28] adoption of children by Christ Jesus
[1:35:30] Christ to himself according to the good
[1:35:32] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[1:35:34] the glory of what
[1:35:37] his grace
[1:35:38] this is a Grace work glorification this
[1:35:41] is not works that any man should boast
[1:35:43] but this is Grace coming through us to
[1:35:45] glorify us to bring us into the statue
[1:35:47] of perfect men and women in Christ
[1:35:49] wherein he has made us accepted in the
[1:35:52] Beloved
[1:35:54] remember Psalms 102 16 says this when
[1:35:56] the Lord shall build up Zion he shall
[1:36:00] appear in his glory
[1:36:01] now brother Branham would say that in
[1:36:03] scripture Mount Zion is always the bride
[1:36:05] if you've ever noticed that Jerusalem is
[1:36:08] the city and that's the Jews but Mount
[1:36:10] Zion is inside Jerusalem
[1:36:13] we're a special Mountain inside of the
[1:36:15] Bride if I could put it that way we are
[1:36:16] the bride the Bride is a special group
[1:36:18] inside of the body inside of the
[1:36:20] original portion of Christ so he says
[1:36:23] when he shall build up Zion what when
[1:36:25] you're built up into the stature of a
[1:36:27] perfect child of God in Christ that's
[1:36:29] when he's going to appear in his glory
[1:36:31] because the Capstone coming down is the
[1:36:33] perfect glorification
[1:36:35] that's the finished work that's what
[1:36:36] makes us glorified is when the finished
[1:36:38] work is there when you're a mature
[1:36:40] believer and the Capstone comes down and
[1:36:42] it's the uniting sign of the end time is
[1:36:44] when Christ comes down and he caps off
[1:36:47] his bride and there's perfect unity and
[1:36:48] then we have that quick short work and
[1:36:50] then off we go
[1:36:51] that's when we see his full Glory
[1:36:54] Paul was or Peter would say this he says
[1:36:56] ye also as Lively stones are built up
[1:36:59] remember he says when he would build up
[1:37:01] Zion Peter says you are built up a
[1:37:04] spiritual house and holy priesthood to
[1:37:07] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[1:37:09] to God by Jesus Christ
[1:37:11] and then in Colossians Paul comes and
[1:37:13] says even the mystery which has been hid
[1:37:15] from ages and from Generations but now
[1:37:18] is made manifest
[1:37:20] made to appear to be revealed to be made
[1:37:23] alive to his Saints to whom God will
[1:37:26] make known what is the richest of the
[1:37:28] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:37:32] what is the mystery what is the glory of
[1:37:34] God
[1:37:35] it is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:37:39] Christ in you is what produces the
[1:37:42] glorification it says whom we preach
[1:37:44] warning every man and teaching every man
[1:37:47] in all wisdom that we may present every
[1:37:51] man perfect in Christ Jesus the
[1:37:54] glorification of God is in a perfectly
[1:37:56] unified word bride
[1:37:59] that's the only thing that we glory in
[1:38:01] that Gloria has shown it is when the
[1:38:03] word is made flesh that's what
[1:38:05] glorification is the word made flesh
[1:38:07] just like it was in Christ
[1:38:10] I want to quote this I quoted it I think
[1:38:11] last service of the service before but I
[1:38:14] want to read it again be put because it
[1:38:15] puts us in our proper place and it puts
[1:38:17] our focus in the right place and it
[1:38:19] helps us to understand where we are and
[1:38:21] it helps us to push out pride and Seth
[1:38:23] will and all these things when we see
[1:38:25] God's intentions for us brother I'm
[1:38:27] saying wait a minute Jesus said in Saint
[1:38:29] John 13 35 by this will all men know
[1:38:32] that you're my disciples when you have
[1:38:33] love one for the other the spirit
[1:38:36] revealed truth of the kingdom of God to
[1:38:38] come looking out to the end Yonder
[1:38:40] seeing what the prophets cried about see
[1:38:42] what Jesus spoke about and say hear the
[1:38:44] same Holy Spirit in you crying right
[1:38:47] back
[1:38:48] is something crying and you write back
[1:38:50] today that's right that's right what is
[1:38:53] it it's spiritual reveal truth I love my
[1:38:55] brothers regardless of where they go to
[1:38:57] church whether they're former or latter
[1:38:59] or no rain at all as long as they're in
[1:39:01] the body of Christ trying to achieve
[1:39:04] he says not something for a certain
[1:39:06] purpose to manifest yourself on Earth
[1:39:09] but the purpose for the kingdom of God
[1:39:12] and the glory of his coming
[1:39:14] to reveal and make known his soon
[1:39:17] appearing
[1:39:18] you're at church
[1:39:20] we're it
[1:39:22] the only Christ they're going to see is
[1:39:24] in you and I
[1:39:25] and that's a glory that he's given us to
[1:39:28] be revealed in this last age and it
[1:39:30] hasn't been seen since 2000 years ago
[1:39:33] it's it's on our shoulders
[1:39:36] it's a robe that he's put on us it's
[1:39:38] that code of adoption that he's put on
[1:39:40] us is the glorification of our bodies
[1:39:42] with the word for the hour I'm not here
[1:39:45] to make a name for myself I'm not here
[1:39:46] to build up some reputation but I'm here
[1:39:49] to reveal Christ
[1:39:51] and that ought to be our everyday
[1:39:52] purpose get up in the morning and say
[1:39:54] Lord let somebody see you and me
[1:39:57] we sing that song Let the beauty of
[1:39:59] Jesus be seen to me that ought to be our
[1:40:01] prayer it ought to be our hearts cry
[1:40:02] every morning what are we here to prove
[1:40:05] I'm here to prove that you can be filthy
[1:40:07] you can be lost you can be depressed you
[1:40:09] can be completely obsessed with the
[1:40:12] things of this world and then God can
[1:40:13] step into your life and turn you into a
[1:40:15] son or daughter of God that's what I'm
[1:40:17] here to prove I'm not here to prove I'm
[1:40:19] anything I'm here to prove that he's
[1:40:21] alive and well today in me and he can do
[1:40:24] the same thing in you amen I'm here to
[1:40:26] show that there's a remedy there's a
[1:40:27] cleansing there's a cleaning there's a
[1:40:29] changing power of God that's available
[1:40:31] to the people of this age
[1:40:33] that's what I'm here to prove
[1:40:35] we're here to let people know that God
[1:40:37] is real we're here to let people know
[1:40:39] God has thoughts and he doesn't just
[1:40:41] have preferences but he has good and he
[1:40:43] has evil
[1:40:44] that he has a word for this age we're
[1:40:46] here to let them know that God has
[1:40:48] outstretched arms and he's calling his
[1:40:49] people to him today that he's not a god
[1:40:52] of judgment yet that we're under grace
[1:40:54] that we're under a mercy seat that
[1:40:56] there's blood to cover these things we
[1:40:58] hear people to show people their sanity
[1:41:02] simple sanity
[1:41:04] the common sense of the Gospel we're
[1:41:07] here to show them people wonder it's a
[1:41:09] testimony to us how our families turn
[1:41:11] out the way they do you know how they do
[1:41:13] it it's the grace of God in us
[1:41:16] that gives us children that gives us
[1:41:18] families that can stay and hold on to
[1:41:20] the word of God even before they get the
[1:41:22] Holy Ghost they can be raised in a way
[1:41:23] that stands out even amongst professing
[1:41:25] Christians all over the world
[1:41:27] what is it it's the Hope Christ the hope
[1:41:29] of glory in US
[1:41:31] that's where all the credit goes Church
[1:41:33] but it's proof of something that's
[1:41:35] happened inside of us it's proof of a
[1:41:37] life that's there amen we're here to
[1:41:39] show you don't have to live for the
[1:41:41] weekend
[1:41:42] that you can live every day with purpose
[1:41:44] I was seeing something yesterday where a
[1:41:46] woman that was an atheist said there is
[1:41:48] no purpose to life
[1:41:51] and all I could think is well why are
[1:41:52] you alive then
[1:41:54] if there is no purpose then why would
[1:41:56] you keep yourself alive
[1:41:57] why would you do the things you do and
[1:41:59] she's an author and a writer and if if
[1:42:01] there is no purpose why would you
[1:42:02] express yourself in any way why would
[1:42:04] you put effort into it why would you
[1:42:05] stress yourself why would you do things
[1:42:07] that cause you discomfort if it wasn't
[1:42:09] for purpose
[1:42:10] and she can't answer that question
[1:42:13] because she's living with purpose
[1:42:15] what she doesn't realize is she's a
[1:42:16] child of hell
[1:42:18] and everything she does reflects that
[1:42:21] she's going to hell unfortunately unless
[1:42:22] God steps into her life
[1:42:24] and all she's doing is reflecting where
[1:42:25] she came from
[1:42:27] we've got a purpose is to reflect where
[1:42:29] we came from
[1:42:30] and maybe get somebody else to see hey I
[1:42:33] resonate more with that than where I'm
[1:42:34] at right now and it's the seed of God
[1:42:37] inside of them quickening amen
[1:42:39] brother Brahm says where are they at
[1:42:41] show me where they're at God calling his
[1:42:45] children aside by manifestation
[1:42:49] not just what you believe
[1:42:51] not just what you say by manifestation
[1:42:55] he says they don't have to say one word
[1:42:58] about it
[1:43:00] you see that Something's Happened
[1:43:07] I'm gonna have some musicians to come
[1:43:11] I want to ask you something this morning
[1:43:15] you've been struggling lately
[1:43:19] feeling overwhelmed
[1:43:22] feeling like you can't get ahead feeling
[1:43:24] like it's just
[1:43:26] I'm not a swimmer and so I feel
[1:43:27] overwhelmed when I'm in the water
[1:43:30] you know and I'm thrashing and I'm
[1:43:32] thrashing and I'm doing this and that
[1:43:33] and I'm hilarious to watch in the water
[1:43:35] because I don't swim very well and what
[1:43:37] I'm trying to do is survive
[1:43:39] and you ever see somebody that enjoys
[1:43:41] the water they're so relaxed
[1:43:44] they just lay there just to they don't
[1:43:47] have to move
[1:43:50] if I don't move I die
[1:43:52] in the water
[1:43:54] but sometimes we're in this life and it
[1:43:56] feels like we're thrashing and nothing's
[1:43:58] happening and all we can say is if I
[1:44:00] don't stop thrashing around I'm gonna
[1:44:02] die
[1:44:04] and we find that there's there's things
[1:44:05] that are so overwhelming and we get a
[1:44:07] bit ahead and then the next wave hits
[1:44:09] and we drop behind and pretty soon you
[1:44:11] feel like you're drowning and it's just
[1:44:13] thing on top of thing on top of thing we
[1:44:16] know God never promised a Bed of Roses
[1:44:18] he never promised us a life of ease but
[1:44:20] he did promise he'd never leave us or
[1:44:21] forsake us
[1:44:23] amen you want to know how to move
[1:44:24] forward
[1:44:26] do you want to know how to save your
[1:44:27] family do you want to know how to save
[1:44:28] your marriage do you want to know how to
[1:44:30] save your sanity do you want to know how
[1:44:32] to save
[1:44:33] and preserve the walk that you have with
[1:44:35] God
[1:44:37] do you want to get through it with your
[1:44:38] patients intact with your testimony
[1:44:40] intact
[1:44:41] I've got a couple quotes for you this
[1:44:43] morning
[1:44:44] God wanted to bless his children and he
[1:44:47] couldn't do it under the law neither
[1:44:49] could he under judgment and justice
[1:44:51] do you want a blessing this morning
[1:44:53] listen to this but the only way he could
[1:44:56] do it was under the love of his son
[1:44:58] Christ Jesus
[1:45:00] watch this love he said this is my
[1:45:01] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[1:45:03] hear ye him what is it all the laws
[1:45:07] finished all the judgments are finished
[1:45:10] this is my beloved Son hear him
[1:45:14] all those other things are done this is
[1:45:16] him
[1:45:17] today we want to hear everything else
[1:45:20] but him
[1:45:22] you want to hear rock and roll you say
[1:45:24] brother John I don't listen to rock and
[1:45:25] roll
[1:45:27] go take your music
[1:45:31] and crank it up to 10. and walk away
[1:45:35] that'll let you know if it's rock and
[1:45:37] roll or not
[1:45:39] I've been going through my music lately
[1:45:41] because what I've found is of so many of
[1:45:43] my songs I like they start good and they
[1:45:46] end bad
[1:45:47] but Church they don't end in rock and
[1:45:49] roll if they don't start in rock and
[1:45:50] roll
[1:45:52] and you hear something and sometimes it
[1:45:54] takes your children listening to it till
[1:45:55] you sit down you say what are they
[1:45:57] listening to and you realize that it's
[1:45:59] something that you've listened to
[1:46:00] you say I don't listen to rock and roll
[1:46:02] brother Branham said that end time
[1:46:04] Church of this age was walking to the
[1:46:06] beat
[1:46:07] of rock and roll
[1:46:09] the beat of rock and roll
[1:46:12] he didn't say she was it was rock and
[1:46:14] roll he says to the beat of rock and
[1:46:15] roll and what you'll find is they have
[1:46:17] worked it in especially over the last 10
[1:46:19] years they have worked rock and roll
[1:46:21] right into Christian music and it is so
[1:46:24] tough to find something that doesn't
[1:46:25] devolve into drums clashing banging
[1:46:30] screaming guitars and all these
[1:46:31] different things
[1:46:35] there's a song says I'm coming back to
[1:46:36] the Heart of Worship
[1:46:38] it's all about you
[1:46:40] and we've replaced him
[1:46:42] with heavy metal this and clashing this
[1:46:45] and banging that and jumping up and down
[1:46:47] and everything and where's Christ gone
[1:46:50] he says you want to listen to rock and
[1:46:52] roll you want to hear all these other
[1:46:54] things but you don't want to hear him
[1:46:56] that's what God Said hear ye him and I
[1:46:59] say to this group of people in this
[1:47:00] Arena tonight hear ye him
[1:47:03] I'm giving you a way out Church
[1:47:05] I'm showing you the way out
[1:47:09] and he said except a man be born again
[1:47:10] he will in no wise enter into the
[1:47:12] kingdom
[1:47:13] hear ye him
[1:47:15] he's the great physician
[1:47:17] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:47:19] with his stripes we were healed
[1:47:21] hear ye him
[1:47:23] if the doctor says you got a Cancer and
[1:47:25] you're going to die the man's honest
[1:47:26] that's all he knows about it all his
[1:47:28] medical Sciences prove that it cannot be
[1:47:30] cured they haven't got nothing to cure
[1:47:32] it with but hear ye him
[1:47:35] he said I'm the Lord who heals all your
[1:47:37] diseases if you're guilty and you've
[1:47:41] sinned and you've trespassed against
[1:47:43] God's Commandments and you don't know
[1:47:45] what to do it the Bible said hear ye him
[1:47:50] he took all our iniquity he took all our
[1:47:53] trespasses away
[1:47:55] here ye him
[1:47:58] Christ fulfilled everything under the
[1:48:00] law
[1:48:01] and now he comes under grace
[1:48:03] and God speaks from heaven and he says
[1:48:05] hear him
[1:48:06] that's where Grace is that's where life
[1:48:08] is that's where Deliverance is that's
[1:48:09] where healing is
[1:48:10] that's where preservation is it's where
[1:48:12] all of these things are that you're
[1:48:13] looking for and all you have to do is
[1:48:15] hear him
[1:48:16] all you have to do is hear him
[1:48:19] the only way you're going to get out of
[1:48:20] this is if you hear him
[1:48:22] you can't blend
[1:48:24] you can't blend and get out you've got
[1:48:27] to take him or nothing
[1:48:30] Psalms 107 says he sent his word
[1:48:35] that's why the hearing of the word is so
[1:48:36] critical that's why the reading of the
[1:48:38] word is so critical he sent his word
[1:48:41] and he healed them
[1:48:44] I would say brother Bram says that first
[1:48:46] healing is what your sin sick soul
[1:48:49] that's the first healing everything else
[1:48:51] comes after that he healed them and he
[1:48:54] delivered them from their destructions
[1:48:57] we've got lots of destructive ways about
[1:48:59] a Stoneway Church
[1:49:00] we've got inclinations from our our
[1:49:03] family DNA we've got inclinations in
[1:49:04] this body we've got it in our minds and
[1:49:06] these different things he says he sent
[1:49:07] his word and he delivered you out of
[1:49:09] your destructions
[1:49:11] get into the word
[1:49:13] hear Christ
[1:49:14] I think we're looking for so much and
[1:49:16] we're forgetting that it comes so simply
[1:49:19] so simply Church
[1:49:21] so simply
[1:49:24] remember what he said in Revelation 3.
[1:49:26] he said what hear what the spirit saith
[1:49:29] to the churches
[1:49:30] that's how you overcome that's how you
[1:49:32] get out of that age that's how you get
[1:49:34] out of that destruction that's how you
[1:49:35] get out of that judgment is here what
[1:49:37] the spirit says to the churches what
[1:49:39] church age are you in where are you at
[1:49:41] what is your message and are you feeding
[1:49:43] on that message and that message alone
[1:49:46] because remember what did he say to the
[1:49:48] Legacy in church age he says you are
[1:49:50] lukewarm
[1:49:52] he said you're not hot and you're not
[1:49:53] cold and I wish you were hot or I wish
[1:49:55] you were cold but you're lukewarm how do
[1:49:57] you get lukewarm water Church you blend
[1:49:59] it
[1:50:00] you blend it
[1:50:03] you blend the word you blend your music
[1:50:05] you blend your friendships you blend
[1:50:07] your influence and you try and Pull It
[1:50:09] in and that's what gets you lukewarm
[1:50:12] it's not that you don't have some hot
[1:50:14] it's not that you don't have hot it's
[1:50:16] not that you don't have the the burning
[1:50:17] fire of the word in your life but you're
[1:50:19] what you're deluding it
[1:50:22] I say you were
[1:50:24] we delude it
[1:50:26] by adding in things that aren't anything
[1:50:28] to do with the word
[1:50:30] we delude it by listening to those that
[1:50:33] aren't saying what the spirit said to
[1:50:35] this age
[1:50:38] you delude it
[1:50:40] by sitting still
[1:50:42] do you want to get lukewarm water
[1:50:46] when this came up this morning
[1:50:49] it was cold
[1:50:51] you know what it is now
[1:50:52] lukewarm why
[1:50:56] it sat
[1:50:57] too far away
[1:50:59] from its source of cold
[1:51:01] you want hot water you got to keep it on
[1:51:04] you got to keep it on the fire don't you
[1:51:05] you got to keep it on the on the oven
[1:51:07] you got to keep it where there's heat
[1:51:09] you got to keep it where there's warmth
[1:51:10] you got to keep it where there's fire if
[1:51:11] you let it sit still where there is no
[1:51:13] fire where there is no Refrigeration
[1:51:15] it'll come to a room temperature and
[1:51:17] that's lukewarm and almost nobody likes
[1:51:19] lukewarm water
[1:51:22] except preachers that are trying to keep
[1:51:24] their throats from closing up I know
[1:51:26] nobody likes lukewarm who likes lukewarm
[1:51:29] food go to a restaurant you want your
[1:51:31] lukewarm food
[1:51:33] how do you get there you let it sit too
[1:51:35] long
[1:51:36] you're not eating as it comes
[1:51:39] you turn away and say no that's not for
[1:51:40] me today
[1:51:42] my brother John's preaching no we'll
[1:51:43] leave that for another day it'll be
[1:51:44] lukewarming do you no good you got to
[1:51:46] eat it now you got to eat it today you
[1:51:47] got to be in the word you got to be in
[1:51:49] the presence today don't put off for
[1:51:50] tomorrow what you can do today
[1:51:52] amen
[1:51:55] stop blending the word of God with your
[1:51:57] feelings
[1:51:58] stop blending it with your opinions
[1:52:00] start blending it with your emotions
[1:52:01] stop blending it with the things that
[1:52:03] are not spoken by the spirit of this age
[1:52:06] that includes your inner voice
[1:52:09] let's stand together as we read this
[1:52:11] last one it says people come up and say
[1:52:13] I got the Holy Ghost too
[1:52:15] look the way they live
[1:52:18] notice this
[1:52:19] doesn't say they don't live holy he says
[1:52:21] they don't last from one Revival to
[1:52:23] another from one meeting to another it's
[1:52:25] made manifest that they haven't got it
[1:52:27] if a man is born of the spirit of God or
[1:52:31] a woman they have the fruits of the
[1:52:33] spirit
[1:52:34] they walk Godly
[1:52:36] they live that life
[1:52:38] it's not legalism
[1:52:41] it's not legalism
[1:52:42] remember legalism it's this we're
[1:52:45] talking about the life of God doing it
[1:52:47] legalistically means doing it because
[1:52:49] the word says and there's nothing in you
[1:52:51] that actually makes you want to do it
[1:52:52] that's what legalism is is obedience
[1:52:55] without the life inside you
[1:52:58] and that's a starting place
[1:53:00] simple obedience is what God is looking
[1:53:02] for
[1:53:03] but you can't stay in simple obedience
[1:53:05] there's got to be a life that comes
[1:53:06] behind it he says watch what they do
[1:53:09] they live that life
[1:53:11] a legalist has to be told to do it has
[1:53:14] to be forced to do it has to remind
[1:53:16] themselves to do it and somebody that's
[1:53:18] got the life will generally and
[1:53:20] naturally come to it on their own
[1:53:22] because there's a life in them that
[1:53:23] feeds on those things he says see how do
[1:53:26] they live that life they keep away from
[1:53:29] the things of the world
[1:53:31] God moves in them and makes himself
[1:53:33] manifest and proves that he's God
[1:53:36] working in there
[1:53:38] the other one is impersonating
[1:53:41] man let's close our eyes
[1:53:44] Heavenly Father
[1:53:47] Lord we want to choose life
[1:53:51] Lord you've given us life Lord but we've

[1:54:20] are we this way Lord help us to take
[1:54:22] inventory and say I know

[1:54:38] would see Jesus in me

[1:54:46] Lord help us to die out help us to
[1:54:48] surrender Lord help us to let ourselves

[1:55:18] that need it Lord May there be a cry
[1:55:19] that doesn't settle Lord that doesn't
[1:55:21] come Lord that doesn't go easily into
[1:55:23] the night until they've met that place
[1:55:25] Lord where they've met you and they know
[1:55:27] that it's a finished work in their life
[1:55:29] Lord we pray for our children
[1:55:33] Lord our precious young people
[1:55:36] Lord thrown into the midst Lord we get
[1:55:38] to stay away from it so easily Lord but
[1:55:40] they're thrown into the midst of it Lord
[1:55:42] and we know that Satan's going around as
[1:55:45] a lion
[1:55:46] Thor seeking whom he may devour Lord
[1:55:48] give them sane Minds give them Clear
[1:55:50] Eyes
[1:55:51] Lord let them separate themselves
[1:55:53] quickly and easily from every influence
[1:55:56] Lord let them trust Lord the work that
[1:55:58] you've started you're going to complete
[1:56:00] we pray
[1:56:02] Lord God we ask your grace this morning
[1:56:05] nor for me
[1:56:07] in order to pulp it all the way to those
[1:56:09] in the back
[1:56:10] from the oldest to the youngest Lord we
[1:56:12] pray your grace would be revealed Lord
[1:56:14] by Your glory in US
[1:56:16] Lord help us to be humble
[1:56:18] Lord help us to be quick to hear quick
[1:56:21] to obey we pray
[1:56:23] in Jesus Christ's name
[1:56:25] amen
[1:56:26] you know I went away
[1:56:28] and I left on Wednesday morning and when
[1:56:31] I went on Wednesday morning I looked at
[1:56:32] my lawn and
[1:56:33] there were maybe 30 or 40 dandelions and
[1:56:36] I said I've got time
[1:56:37] I can stop this
[1:56:40] I came back three days later and I had a
[1:56:42] thousand
[1:56:46] what are you saying Brother John
[1:56:49] settle it today
[1:56:51] clean it today
[1:56:53] get delivered today
[1:56:55] make a confession today
[1:56:58] let him do a work in your life today
[1:57:01] before the battle gets harder
[1:57:03] I spend more time yesterday trying to
[1:57:05] clean that lawn up
[1:57:07] it had grown some of my grass was a foot
[1:57:08] and a half some of the weeds were two
[1:57:10] feet tall
[1:57:11] I had to go through and I had to weed
[1:57:12] eat everything
[1:57:14] in the wet
[1:57:15] and then I had to mow everything in the
[1:57:17] wet my mower wouldn't do it I had to cut
[1:57:19] it down just to get the mower to the
[1:57:20] place where it could do a bad job
[1:57:22] because it would just clog up and die
[1:57:24] constantly
[1:57:25] I should have done it before I left
[1:57:28] that's going to take me days
[1:57:30] and with the weather here it may take me
[1:57:32] a week or two to get that lawn looking
[1:57:33] the way it's supposed to why because I
[1:57:35] didn't do it when I ought to have done
[1:57:37] it
[1:57:37] doesn't mean it won't be perfect
[1:57:40] just means I'm gonna have to fight that
[1:57:41] much harder to get it to where it ought
[1:57:43] to be
[1:57:44] that's what I'm talking about this
[1:57:45] morning amen
[1:57:46] is Glory being revealed we've got
[1:57:49] choices to make we've got decisions to
[1:57:51] make
[1:57:52] them
[1:57:53] don't put it off
[1:57:55] don't say I'm good
[1:57:57] there's only 30 dandelions tomorrow
[1:58:00] there'll be a hundred the day after 300
[1:58:02] the day after a thousand that's how
[1:58:04] quickly it multiplies amen start feeding
[1:58:06] on the word and watch that multiply
[1:58:09] start cleaning out your life and let
[1:58:10] that what make room for more of God
[1:58:14] and trust him
[1:58:15] and then trust him that he'll put the
[1:58:17] satisfaction there
[1:58:18] that he'll put the right Desires in
[1:58:20] there that he'll start to use you for
[1:58:21] these things amen

[2:03:10] Dave was a child of God David was an
[2:03:12] anointed Son of God
[2:03:15] they came to a place yet where he said
[2:03:16] Lord I need a clean heart
[2:03:19] there are things that are weighing on me
[2:03:20] there are things that are holding me
[2:03:22] back
[2:03:22] you got a wrong Spirit on him
[2:03:25] maybe you got cynical
[2:03:27] maybe you got stressed out I imagine he
[2:03:30] did run him for his life for as long as
[2:03:32] he did
[2:03:33] he got to a place where being in the
[2:03:35] presence
[2:03:37] he couldn't even maybe get there
[2:03:39] things were holding him back
[2:03:42] they said renew restore to me the joy of
[2:03:44] my salvation he says Lord It's not that
[2:03:46] I'm not saved
[2:03:47] I said I'm not enjoying my salvation I'm
[2:03:50] not enjoying my walk I'm not enjoying my
[2:03:52] relationship
[2:03:54] he said Lord restore that
[2:03:57] I know I'm sealed I know I saved I know
[2:03:59] I'm good in your sight but there's
[2:04:01] something missing today that I used to
[2:04:03] have
[2:04:04] and Lord I want to have that
[2:04:06] I got off the road a little bit here a
[2:04:08] little bit there Lord I don't know where
[2:04:10] I got off perhaps but I know I'm not
[2:04:12] where I used to be that I'm not enjoying
[2:04:14] the presence I'm not enjoying the word
[2:04:16] I'm not seeking after those things maybe
[2:04:18] in the way and Lord I want to go back
[2:04:20] lord I want to go back to where I was
[2:04:23] will you take me there and if you read
[2:04:26] later God took him back
[2:04:28] God doesn't God doesn't put the the
[2:04:31] thought of restoration without making a
[2:04:33] way to restore amen amen you're seeking
[2:04:36] more there's more to be had if you had
[2:04:38] something you can have it again
[2:04:41] amen if there's something you're there
[2:04:42] Desiring from God that means there's
[2:04:44] something of God to be had

[2:04:49] you gotta sigh and cry you've got a
[2:04:51] groan Paul said for what God has in
[2:04:54] store for you
[2:04:55] scripture says the Harvest is white
[2:04:58] he says and there's only a few laborers

[2:05:07] be a laborer in it
[2:05:09] pray that he'll make you a laborer pray
[2:05:11] that he'll make you a part of the work

[2:05:44] it
[2:05:46] if you're not feeling it say Lord I
[2:05:48] don't feel it I need to feel it but
[2:05:51] greater than feel it Lord I Need to Know
