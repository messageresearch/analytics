I want to welcome each one of you here tonight to our special program we're doing for Easter. And this has been certainly a long time in the making. I think it's three and a half almost four months since uh Sister Priscilla kind of put together a plan for what we were going to do here tonight. And as you can see, we've gone all out. Certainly for us, we've gone all out. Maybe hundreds of dollars spent. So I appreciate everything that's gone into this. This is a whole team effort that's come in. I think about half the church is involved in some way or the other. And uh certainly appreciate brother Matt, brother Vichel working on the audio visual. Uh we've really had to expand our system to allow everyone to be miked up the way they are tonight. So lots of hard work, lots of days and evenings and weekends and those sorts of things. So before it happens, we want to say thank you and we appreciate everything you've done. We appreciate the willing attitude, the vigorous cooperation that we've seen from each one and just trusting it'll be a blessing tonight. Welcome all of our visitors. I don't know all of you by name. I know we have some from Ankor Academy. I think the Collinses and the guys brought along a whole slew of people as well. So, God bless you. Marilyn Taylor's here with us again tonight and different ones. So, God bless you. Trusting this will be a a wonderful time as we we do this tonight. I'm just going to open with a word of prayer and then we'll we'll do our our song if that's okay. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, Lord, it's a wonderful weekend that we spend, Lord, to remember the price that you paid at Calvary, Lord. But we're not just here to remember the price, Lord. But we're here to remember the benefits as well, Lord. That when you rose again, Lord, that you said that spirit would come back and it would live inside each one of us and it would produce Christ and flesh all over again in just a little bit in each one. So, Lord, we're thankful tonight, Lord, that we have your spirit dwelling in us, Lord. And we're praying that as we do this for your glory and your honor, Lord, that you would minister, that you would speak, Lord, that you would touch our hearts and lives, Lord. that you would bring freedom and healing, Lord, to those that are here and listening and watching this today. Lord, bless those that are participating that have put so much effort in. Lord, may you pour out on them a wonderful blessing that they can't contain each one. Lord, just have your way now. We ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it. Amen. Amen. Let's stand if we would and we're going to sing that song, Marvelous Grace, before the play starts. [Music] Marvelous grace of our loveing Lord.

And this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. Harion is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. [Music] The cough that separated me from Christ my Lord. It was so vast the crossing I could never afford. From where I was to his domain it seemed so far. My cry dear Lord I cannot come to where you [Music] are. He came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. That's why he died on Calary when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. He came to me when I was bound in chains of sin. He came to me when I possessed no hope with him. He picked me up and drew me gently to his side. Where to take in his sweet love I now abide. He came to me. He came to me. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. That's why he died. Oh Calary, when I could not come to where he was, he came to me. He came to me. He came to me when I could not come to where he was. He came to me. That's why he died on Calary. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. When I could not come to where he was, he came to me. [Music] ation of Christianity. It's the mercy of God that bought you a Calvary and you are God's love gift to Christ. And if God gave a gift to Christ, Christ keeps his gift. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Ain't it a Christian? Ain't it be a Christian? [Music] on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and all day with a Christian. Ain't it grand? Your neighbor ate it. Ain't it your neighbor?

All my burdens have been lifted. Since the Savior brought me out, I will tell the world both far and near. as I travel here below. That I'd rather be an oldtime Christian than anything I know. I'd rather be an old time Christian than anything I know. There's nothing like an old time Christian with a Christian love to show. I'm walking in the grand old highway and I'm telling everywhere I go that I'd rather be an old time Christian than anything I know. Ah, Pastor David, I need to speak with you. Yes, Mr. Emanuel. I'd like you to open a variety store here for me, David. I'll send along some helpers for you and make sure you never run out of stock. It's not always going to be easy, but I'll be with you always. Yes, sir. I'd be happy to serve you here. [Music] heartache. broken pieces ruin when land are wide. You died on Calary. Your touch is what I long for. You have given life to me.

There's balming Gilead, honey from the rock, the sweet fruit of the spirit, the bread of life, and so much more. Welcome everyone. How can I help you today? Sorry. From the angel of the covenant. Oh, I tell you, Christians don't realize the privilege that we have. It's like we're going down here to a big arcade or going to a great big variety store. And you go into the variety store and you look over here. Here's some here. You like that? Now, when I get into a variety store, I like to look around a little. Don't you all? Especially if it was mine. And I see something up high. I'll get me a ladder and I'll go climb up, look at it, investigate it, see what it looks like. That's the way it is in Christ Jesus. By one spirit, we're all baptized into God's big variety store, Jesus Christ, wherever we have peace, joy, happiness, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, meekness, Holy Ghost, powers of God, speak with tongues, interpretation of tongues, divine healing, glory, shouts, and wisdom. Hallelujah. All these things are ours to every believer. It belongs to you. [Music] I like [Music] Come by here, my Lord. Come by here. [Music] Come by here, Lord. Come by here. [Music] Come here, my Lord. Lord come by ear. Oh Lord come my [Music] praying come by here. The lights bring by someone pray Lord come by Lord come. [Music] Excuse me, Pastor David. I've been struggling with fear. It's overwhelming and I rightly don't know what to do. Fear is a powerful force, but it doesn't have to control you. God's word says, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind." Let me introduce you to someone. Hello, Olivia. God's promises are true. You don't have to be afraid. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. I want to trust him, but it's just so hard. Ha! You think you can just trust and make me disappear? I've been with you far too long, Olivia. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is a stronghold of my life. Of whom shall I be afraid? Fear thrives in your doubt, but God's promises are stronger. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them. For the Lord your God goes with you. He will never leave you nor forsake you. I choose to trust Jesus. Thank you, Pastor David. I feel ladder. The truth will set you free, Olivia. Hold on to his promises. [Music] You have covered me with a melody. Ready. You surround me with a song of [Music] deliverance from my [Music] eneies. Till all my fears have gone. I'm no longer a slave. save to fear. I am a child of God. I no longer a slave to [Music] fear. I am a child of God. [Music] Pastor David, do you think I'm doing a good job? I mean, I try, but sometimes I worry I'm not hopeful enough. You're doing great, Andy. God has equipped you with everything you need. Just keep trusting him. Thanks, pastor. Uh, what do you think about my new haircut? Is it too short? Is it too long? I probably should just wear a wig, you know. Do you think I should wear a wig? It looks fine, Andy. Nel's keep helping those who come through that door. Thank you, pastor. from faith by experience. Now, faith is a substance. It's like this. What if you found me somewhere starving to death and I told you I was hungry and one loaf of bread would save my life and you would reach into your pocket and give me 25 cents and say, "Here, brother Brandham, you don't have to starve. I'll give you 25 cents to get a loaf of bread." Now, I'd be just as happy with the 25 cents as I'd be if I had the bread. Why? Because I've got the purchase power of the loaf of bread in my possession. Now, I cannot eat the 25 cents, but the 25 cents will buy the bread. And now, faith is the 25 cents. If you've got the faith in your heart, you're just as happy with the faith that your crippled hand will move as you would be if you were moving it. Because faith is the purchasing power of your healing. Now, maybe with the 25 cents, I'd be just as hungry as I was before I received the 25 cents. And I might have to go several miles before I could get the loaf of bread. I might have to go through the brier patch, up the mountains, cross over the bridge, wait through the water. But all the time I'm going, I'm rejoicing because I've got the purchasing power of that loaf of bread. [Music] All I have to do is stop. [Music] All [Music] afternoon strength for today for tomorrow. My go is follow my know. [Music] All I have to do is fall for today. And all I need for [Music] tomorrow is all I have to do is love. [Music] [Applause] [Music] What are you doing for brother? [Music] Pastor David, I've been holding on to a promise from God for so long, but my faith is weakening. I don't know if I could keep believing. Let us not go or we worry while doing good. For in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. God's timing is perfect. Mark, don't give up. You're wasting your time, Mark. Look. Why do you keep believing? Maybe the promise isn't for you. Maybe God has forgotten you. What if? What if it's not meant to be? [Music] Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. God's promises are yes and amen. Don't let unbelief steal your hope. You are wasting your time, Mark. Look around. Where's the fulfillment of a so-called promise? For we walk by faith, not by sight. Mark, remember that God's word does not return void. His promises will come to pass in his perfect time. You're a fool to keep waiting. I I want to believe. I do, but it's just so hard to wait. But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings like eagles. They shall run and not be weary. And they shall walk and not faint. God is faithful. Mark, don't lose heart. I will wait on the Lord. I will wait for the Lord. My soul waits and in his word I do hope. [Music] Thank you, Pastor David. Thank you, Faith. I won't give up. I'll keep trusting in God. Hold fast your confession mark. God is with you. [Music] I can hear my savior calling. I can hear my savior calling. I can hear my [Music] Savior calling. Take thy cross now. Follow, follow me where he leads me up. I will follow where he leads me. I will follow where he leads me. I will follow. All the wind all the [Music] way from the unconditional covenant that God made with his people. Then God appeared to Abraham. He said, "Come out and look around now. See what you own. Amen. Oh, I like that. Come out and look it over. Walk from the east to the west. It's all yours. You took your way with the Lord's despised few. Now you're heir of all of it. Amen. It all belongs to you now, Abraham. I give it to you unconditionally. You don't deserve it, but I give it to you anyhow. Amen. Oh, I don't deserve this, but he gave it to me anyhow. So, I'm going to walk east, north, west, and south, and see what I own in the kingdom of God. All things are mine. Amen. Let's get up and walk around. See how it looks. My, it feels good. Take God by faith. [Music] Oh, that rug cross, the selfless pain he bore. He breathed his final breath that I would be by his body that was broken. Precious blood freely shed. The spotless lamb of heaven has for ever conered death. Jesus is my healer. He is everything I need. He alone has triumphed over sickness and disease. Fear, where is your power? The cross is your defeat. Jesus is my healer. He has won the victory. Oh, how great a love I'm helping perfect peace. For he walks with me through valleyies, understands my suffering. Every joy and every sorrow, every triumph, every loss, I know everything is covered by the shadow of the cross. I know everything is covered by the shadow of the cross. Jesus is my healer. He's everything I need. He alone has triumphed over sickness and disease and fear. Where is your power? The cross is your defeat. Jesus is my healer. He has won the victory. Oh Jesus is my healer. He has won the victory. Everything bows at his name. Everything bows at his name. Sickness, darkness, chains break at the name of Jesus. Everything bows at his name. Everything bows at his name. Sickness, darkness, chains break at the name of Jesus. Oh, everything bows at his name. Everything bows at his name. Sickness, darkness, chains that break at the name. The name of Jesus. Everything bows at his name. Everything bows at his name. Sickness, darkness, chains, break at the name, the name of Jesus. Jesus is my healer. He's everything I need. And he alone has triumphed over sickness and disease. So fear, where is your power? The cross is yours to defeat. Jesus is my healer. He has won the victory. Jesus is my healer. He has won the victory. [Music] [Music] Pastor was just working in my barn just singing and praising the Lord as as I worked and God's prot and and praise the Lord I'm healed. Glory to God. That's wonderful, Mark. Thank the Lord. Would you like to give a testimony at our prayer meeting tomorrow? Oh, yes. I'd be happy to do that, pastor. It's a long time coming. I've walked through many valleys, as you know, but God has kept his word and been with me all the way. I just had to come and tell the good news. I better get back now. I left in such a hurry. I didn't tell Martha. Goodbye, pastor. Thank you. See you tomorrow. I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus since I found in him a friend so strong and True. I would tell you how he changed my life completely. He did something that no other friend could do. No one ever cared for me like Jesus. There's no other friend so kind as he. No one else could take the sin and darkness from me. Oh, how much he cares for me. Oh my life was full of sin when Jesus found me. All my heart was full of misery and w. Jesus placed his strong and loving arms around me and he led me in the way I ought to go. Thank you, Lord. No one ever cared for me like Jesus. There's no other friend so kind as he. No one else could take the sin and darkness from me. Oh, how much he cares for me. Every day he comes to me with new assurance. More and more I understand his words of love. But I'll never know just why he came to save me. Till someday I see his blessed face above. No one ever cared for me like Jesus. No other friend so kind as he. No one else could take the sin darkness from me. Oh, how much he cares for [Music] Pastor David, I've been struggling. I walked away from this place years ago, thinking all of this was a waste of time. But I was wrong. Come to me all you who labor and are laden. And I will give you rest. It's never too late to return. Judy, I've been so bitter, angry at God, angry at you. It's been eating me up inside. I don't want to live like this no more, pastor. [Music] There ain't no fear in love, but perfect love cast out fear. God's love can heal your heart, Judy. Will you let him in? I don't deserve it, but I want to come back. I want to be free. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. God's grace is greater than your past, Judy. [Music] I need his cleansing blood. I [Music] know now I'm coming home. Oh, wash me wer than the snow. [Music] Lord, I'm coming home. I'm coming home. Never more to open wide. I armed the Lord. Lord, I'm coming home. [Music] Thank you, pastor. I feel free. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things are passed away. Behold, all things have become new. Welcome back, Judy. from Abraham and deceited after him. Do you see it? Don't look yourself. Look at your sacrifice. God doesn't look at you. He looks your sacrifice, which is Christ. Don't look at yourself. I'm not worthy. You're not worthy. Nobody's worthy. But he is the one. I'm not counting on what I've done, what I am, or I'll never make it. But I'm looking at what he's done. That's where I'm trusting what he's done. He's my sacrifice. I'm not worthy of healing. No sir, Lord. I ought to have died long ago. Never even been born. But I live. I got eternal life. I'm going to heaven. Why? Because he's because he's done it for me. He was the one. He took my place. So he makes me a perfect son of God, perfect daughter of God. His sacrifice did it, not mine. I had nothing to do with it. I was born all out of shape anyhow. But I tr But I don't trust in what I've done. I trust in what he's done. See what he was. That's what did it. [Music] Amazing love that always was has ransom. on this heart of mine. The light of the whole universe gave his life so I could shine. I said, "Lord, I'm not worthy that you should die for me. He said, "Child, don't you wory. I formed your destiny. You are [Music] blameless. Blameless. For I have paid the price." Shameless, inocent, filled with the life I gave. Me thought he had you bound, but the evidence was never found. You are beautiful. [Music] and blame [Music] blessing love with his own blood has washed my sins away. The perfect lamb was crucified that I might stand justified. I said, "Lord, I'm not worthy that you should die for me." He said, "My child, can't you see? You are a part of me. And you are blameless, blameless, for I have faith Christ. [Music] Shameless, [Music] innocent, filled with the life I gave. Never thought he had you bound, but the evidence was never found. You are beautiful. and [Music] blameless. Accusers rise on every side and demand justice be served. But the mighty judge with his own blood has sovereignly declared. You are blameless. Blameless for I have paid the price. Shameless, [Music] inocent, filled with the life I gave. Meyer thought he had you bound, but the abotence was never found. You are beautiful. and blameless. [Music] I want [Music] I believe I believe God. I believe God. It shall be done even trust and oy. I believe God. [Music] Hey. [Music] Oh my god. [Music] Enough variety Lord, get away, boy. I'll tear this door out my bare hand. Burns. I've had enough of this hogwash you call hope. You and this store and that you make there are ruining everything. Satan, you're not welcome here. This door is belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ. And you have no power here. I don't need your permission to be anywhere. Do you really think that those promises there could stop me? Do you really think your little God's words could undo the power I have over every one of these people? The power you have is nothing good compared to the power of God. His promises are true and his word is a sword that cuts through all your lies. Lies. Look around you, boy. This whole world is full of suffering and pain and despair. I have more power than you could ever imagine. Yet you think a few little words can make a difference. It's not just words, Satan. It's the truth. And the truth sets people free. The power of God's promises is in his love, his grace, and his faithfulness. Your power is built on fear and deception. But it crumbles in the face of God's light. But I've already claimed so many lives. I fill them with Well, let's see. Yes. I fill them with doubt and sickness of every kind and and despair. What I'm trying to say, boy, if you can follow me, these people, they belong to me. You may have them for a moment, but they belong to God for eternity. And he is calling them back to himself one by one. Right? The Lord is not slow in keeping his promises as some understand Sonus. Instead, he's patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance. are lonely. You have said your peace, boy. Now I wish mine. I'll make them forget every last promise of your little god. I'll drain them of every last drop of hope. I'll bring them to their knees, begging for a mercy that'll never come until their breath slips from their sorry frame and their bones rot in a desert far from the reaches of mortal kin. Submit yourselves then to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Right? You have no authority here, Satan. I do. The store is a place of God's light and you cannot extinguish it. Who are you? The joy of the Lord is your strength. Satan, you can't stand against the power of God's promises. These people are weak. They doubt. They fear. Come on. M for this purpose the son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. Your lies have been exposed. Satan Jesus has already won the victory of Calvary. [Music] For I walk by faith and not by sight. God's people are stronger than you think, Satan. Their faith in God's word is steadfast. Right. joy and peace and believing that you may abound in the Holy Ghost. Now, there is no fear in love, but perfect love cast out fear. God love drives out your target, Satan. You are defeated. Get out. [Music] Hear me now. This isn't over, pastor. I'll find a way back into their lives. I always do. For the light stands the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. You may try but God's light will always prevail and so will his promises. No they won't. Oh no. Oh no no [Music] no. Not him again. And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony. Satan, you're done here. The blood of Jesus has already sealed your fate. What are you going to do? [Music] [Music] The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed. Keep up the good work, Pastor David. The harvest is great and the laborers are few. Can't believe I forgot my David. Did you see that? Satan didn't even stand a chance. That's right, Andy. Jesus already won the victory. We just need to stand firm in his promises. I know I wasn't in the battle, but I was praying really, really hard. I wasn't praying on my knees. Should I have been praying on my knees? Please tell me if I messed up, pastor. You did great, Andy. Prayer is powerful and your support means everything. Now, let's keep this door open for those who need it. Remember, Jesus paid it all at Calvary. His love is unmmerited and unconditional, for he met God's requirements as the lamb of God. God's promises and grace are unlimited. We only need to believe and have the faith and patience of Abraham. Keep holding on to his promises. No matter what, God keeps his word. [Applause] [Music] for our God promises his children. He will find another brokenhearted. Oh, he will. Oh, he will. He'll set captives free from darkness. Oh, he will. Oh, he will. He'll bring hope into the homeless. Help a restless soul be still. Oh. Oh. He will. [Music] He came to walk in truth and grace. Men of sorrows entered all our pain. On the cross he took our place. Then he rode him up out of the grave. Whether I'm in want or plenty, whether I'm in health or ill, God promises his children. He will. He will. He'll by God the brokenhearted. Oh, he will. Oh, he will. He'll set free from darkness. Oh, he will. Oh, he will. He'll breathe hope to the homeless. Help the restless. So be still. Oh. Oh. He will He will He'll find beauty for our ashes. He'll restore the oil of badness. We will praise him through our sadness till the promise is fulfilled. Oh. Oh, he will. He will. He'll bind up the brokenhearted. Oh, he will. Oh, he will. He'll set his free from darkness. Oh, he will. Oh, he will. He'll breathe all to the homeless. Help a restless soul be still. Oh. Oh. He will. He will. [Music] Oh. He will be. [Music] is tremendous. Our God is tremendous. me. Yes, he helps me. Is faithful and true. Won't forget his own. Won't forget it all. My companion, my best friend, the only Jesus, the Lion of Judah. Oh, God is tremendous. His strength never fail. He'll go through the fire just to save a sinner. Yes, he is almighty. And he sends his angels to guide me. There is no song too powerful. Our God cannot handle. Our God in simplicity. He revealed in you and me. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest love story. over. His banner over me is love. Our God is [Music] tremendome. God Almighty will fight your battles. Glorious. He will stand for you. He will stand for you. Your victory will come not the way you think it should, but my great Jehovah just of paradise to stand in your position and watch your miraculous into action. My God is your strength never failing. He'll go through the fire just to save a sinner. His are his angels to guide me. There is no storm too powerful. Our God cannot handle. Our God is simplicity. He revealed in you and me. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest of story. Our God is tremendous. His king never fails. He'll go through the fire just to save us here. Yes, he is almighty. And he sent his angels to guide me. There is no stone too powerful. Our God cannot handle. Our God is simplicity. He revealed in you and me. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest of came down from his glory and gave us the victory. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. Came down from his glory and gave us the victory. The greatest love of story. [Music] Amen. Wasn't that wonderful? Amen. I love the progression there of taking some notes as we went through and started with he came to me. You know, scripture says, "No man has sought God." He says, "He seeks us and then we seek him." It's his call that brings us to him. And you notice that when they were portraying the different ones. He didn't go for the strong. He didn't go for the powerful. He didn't go for the faithful. He didn't go for the smart. He went for the weak. He went for the broken. He went for the the horrible. those that were just couldn't they just couldn't get out of their own way. That's the ones that he came to. You know, Paul the Apostle, he said, "I'm the chiefest of sinners." And that's the one that God picked to lead that first church age to to bring the majority of the New Testament was a man that had persecuted Christ himself. So, it's not based on what we do. Everything that we have here today as believers is because of what he's done. Amen. And that's what we're celebrating this weekend is what he did. And what he did paved the way for his spirit to come back so he could do it all over again through you and I. Because he said, "The works that I do, you shall do also." And we heard here, he said that the works of Christ is to destroy the works of the devil. And that's what he's doing here today is he's destroying the works of the devil in your lives. He's bringing us out of a life of sin. He's bringing us out of a life of self. He's bringing us out a life of fear and despondency and despair and all these things that this world has built up because Satan is the the god of this evil age. But he has a bride that he has prepared. He's got a bride that he has called. And he's got a bride that he's working in by the power of his Holy Spirit to have an overcomer in this age. Amen. That's what this is about. It's not us. It's Christ in me, the hope of glory that finishes his works and take us takes us all the way into eternity. Amen. God bless you, Sister Priscilla. Everyone that helped. I'm in the back watching the whole time and I see what Brother Matt's back there doing with the helpers on the audio visual and the running back and forth and checking and fixing. I say God bless you. What a tremendous, tremendous job. I think we should give them all a hand. [Applause] Amen. May maybe we'll do a matinea tomorrow again. probably not. We're just going to sing one more song and then we're going to have a word of prayer and we've got some refreshments out in the in the fellowship hall. If you just go out to the sanctuary, turn right, you can go in there. You're welcome to stay. We'd love to have anyone stay and talk and just meet the meet the cast and shake their hands, get their signatures maybe, and uh and just enjoy some food afterwards and some fellowship. So, we're going to sing this song, Oh, How He Loves You and Me, and then we'll pray. If we just stand [Music] together. Oh, how he loves you and me. Oh, how he loves you and [Music] me. He gave his life. What more could he give? Oh, how he loves you. Oh, how he loves me. Oh, how he loves you and me. Jesus to Calary did go his love for sinners to show. And what he did there brought hope from despair. Oh, how he loves [Music] you. He loves you and me. Amen. Let's bow our heads, Lord Jesus. Lord, how thankful we are, Lord, that we don't have to worry, that we don't have to fear, Lord, when the trials of this life come against us. Lord, you've given us a spirit that conquers all fear. Lord, it's a spirit of love and of a sound mind. Lord, of faith in your word. And Lord, we're walking by faith tonight. We're trusting in your word, Lord. We're not trusting our feelings. We're not trusting what we can see. We're not trusting the evidence around us, Lord, but we're declaring by your word those things that which are not, it seems, as if they are. Lord, I pray you help us to trust in the finished work of Calvary. Lord, that when you sent your spirit back, you sent it to finish that work in our lives, Lord Jesus. Lord, we're thankful for the sacrifice that you paid. Lord, we're thankful for the blood that covers us, Lord, that the we've taken on your righteousness as you took away our sin, Lord. And we stand before you as we heard tonight, blameless, Lord. Sinless, spotless, Lord. You start a work, you always finish it, Lord. And we're trusting you to take us all the way through to the end, Lord. You see every heart here. You see every life, Lord. You see the needs that we have everyone. Lord, we ask that your spirit would move by your word, Lord, to heal us, to cleanse us, to sanctify us, Lord, to deliver us, Lord, to draw us to you, to save us to the uttermost, each one we pray. Lord, thank you for this group. Thank you for this people, Lord, that so faithfully put their effort forward for your glory and for your honor. Lord, I pray you bless us now. Bless these refreshments that we eat, our fellowship, and time together. for each one. We pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. [Music]
