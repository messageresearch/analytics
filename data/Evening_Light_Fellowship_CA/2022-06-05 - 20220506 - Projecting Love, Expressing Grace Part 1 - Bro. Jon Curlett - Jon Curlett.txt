armor down a little bit and just let you talk to us lord to bind our wounds lord to address our lives our situations lord to come in and clean out the rooms of our lives lord to just drop in and have a loving chat with us this morning lord god lord we know it's a house of correction lord but lord sometimes that correction is to just heal the hurts that have been caused by outside things lord so lord whatever your spirit would have this morning lord for each heart and each soul each life that's here this morning lord may they look past the man to see the great god that wants to have a talk with them this morning lord may your holy spirit just have freedom to speak lord to touch each one lord so many needs have been brought before us this morning lord some not here lord we pray your ministering grace to them body soul and spirit lord as brother mark prayed may you forgive us lord lord for where we fall short lord where we put our trust in something else lord may we come back to that refuge that strength that is your name that is your word in jesus christ's name we ask it this morning amen and amen thank you musicians i mean god bless you this morning if you'll turn your bibles to first john chapter four in first john chapter four and we'll start at verse seven amen certainly good to be in the house of the lord this morning to to enjoy the praises and just be in his presence amen it's good to be here this morning and then just before we start i wanted to make a couple announcements we've got a prayer request from dear friends of ours back in british columbia sister lynn frangos and her and her husband are an older retired couple and she's she's not the world's most active woman she's somewhat frail but she loves to be outdoors and work in her gardens and those sorts of things and and she's been knocked on her back and she can't stand for about more than 10 minutes before she has to lay down so she's spending most of her time these days laying down and she's got a uh an appointment with a neurosurgeon or a specialist this week or early next week so we want to remember her her husband's having to do basically everything around the home and whatnot and he's got the energy for it so we thank god for that he provides him in but we just want to hold her up before the lord in prayer also some of you may have noticed we don't have an organ here anymore and so we put a chair over there and that's for the minister if he wants to go after the service so if i'm over there brother gerald's over there that's that if you need to come up for prayer you know we don't call prayer you know lines or invite people up very often but we're there so that if you have need of us then we're there to pray with you and talk with you after the service or while they're singing or those different things so you feel free to come up at any time and and you can just go right over there and talk to the minister you don't have to do anything special but we do that for you so that you have access and and if you have a need then we can hopefully minister to that amen amen first john chapter 4 and verse 7 says beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love amen you can have your seats this morning may god bless his word it's uh brother jason watkins says to be a to be a pastor or you know a regular minister you got to be a preaching machine and uh brother gerald calling me to come right back he took one and then he said you're up for the next two and so you're sitting there and you're saying lord what am i going to do you're not sure sometimes you know and i've got a lot of notes i've got a lot of notes but preaching isn't about notes amen i can have lots of ideas and good things written down but you've got to try and find the mind of the lord and so i've had this some of this probably for eight or nine months and i'll be frank i thought it was for a different place a different time and not necessarily for this church not that it wouldn't be good for this church of course but um anyways god just started dwelling with me on that and and dropping some things in so i said okay and here we are this morning amen so just trusting that the lord will be in it and i want to bring a a just a little mini series two services tonight and wednesday or this morning and wednesday of projecting love and expressing grace amen and this is going to be down home where you live preaching this is going to be right in your kitchen right in your living room this is going to be rubber meets the road very pastoral type of message this morning so it's not all going to be mysteries i mean it's not all going to be mysteries we're not going to be necessarily getting into the deep things where we're drilling down into scripture amen but we want to be revealed mysteries amen we don't just want to read about mysteries we don't just want to hear about mysteries but we want to be mysteries it's kind of like somebody says that they've got a treasure map and they say i've got the treasure map figured out and you say do you have the treasure and they say no then you know there's something wrong with their interpretation that treasure map because if you knew where it was you'd have it by now amen and it's the same thing for us as believers we don't just want to know the truth we want to be the truth we want to have the truth we want to know the we want to be the expression of god just know about god but we want to be god expressing him through our lives amen let's go back to that original scripture and if you'll hold your bibles in first john 4 we're going to stay there the entire service i'll go off a few different ways but you'll want to stay there amen this morning but verse 7 says beloved let us love one another for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god and he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love and i want to stop here and start with this and it's what what john is saying here is he's saying if you don't have god's love you're not a part of god it's very simple this morning he says if you don't have the love of god then you don't actually know god and you can't even say you're a part of god you might be inclined towards god right you might have a leaning towards it you might have a an understanding of what truth is but he says if you don't have the love of god then you have no part of god so we need to know what that love of god is amen but he says he goes so far as to say you don't know god you haven't met god and more importantly you haven't had an intimate relationship with god if you don't have his love that's right that's how that's how straight the line is this morning he says if if you haven't experienced the love of god then you don't have any part of god you say i know what's under the seven seals doesn't matter right i dress right i dress according to the scriptures that doesn't matter if you don't have love amen i attend church every time the church door is open it doesn't matter if you don't have love and then he's it's a simple line that we're drawing this morning that said you've got to be able to express god's love in order for you to be a part of god and then as we start to get into this we'll we'll look at some of these different things and don't stop dressing right don't stop understanding the things of the scripture don't stop coming to church those are attributes of a child of god amen but that doesn't make you a child of god that comes out of a child of god but that's not what makes you a child of god it's the love of god that'll make you do those things it's the love of god that will give you revelation and understanding in the scriptures you i could say it this way you can believe this message of the hour and if you don't have the love of god it doesn't matter because what i'll tell you is that you don't understand what the message is if you don't have the love of god because then it just becomes words it just becomes doctrines it just becomes sermons that a prophet brought to us but if you don't have the life of that message if you don't have the love that brought us that message then you don't really understand what the message is about because in the end the message is a person it's not just things on a page it's not just sermons on a tape it's a person so that message you have to become the message you don't if you've received it you will become it and if you've received it and you haven't become it then it you can't have received it because the receiving of the word always has an effect in a person's life amen you've got to you can't get stuck on the mysteries you can't get stuck on the depth of the scripture and not have that same depth in your life expressed through the things that you do listen you say brother john that's blasphemy to say that you can believe the message of the hour and not be saved or that you don't have a part of god let's go back to the original prophet in first corinthians 13 he says though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries mysteries under the seven seals mysteries of godhead mystery of serpenty mysteries of marriage and divorce all of these things if i understand all those mysteries and have all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing i am nothing you say i would listen if i walked through there and i s if i if i could say that i jonathan corlett have a gift of prophecy understand all mysteries and all knowledge and that i have faith enough to move great mountains as jesus told us we could have if we believed i would say i'm an amazing christian and then paul says and if you have not love you're nothing so you can have all of those gifts you can have all of those things from god but he says if you don't have the love of god then you are nothing you are nothing as a believer you are nothing as it represents a child of god amen we talked a lot about faith recently and paul says look you can have the greatest faith on earth but if you can't love the way christ's love then you're nothing you have no place you have no position you have no standing in the kingdom of heaven what's he saying he's saying you can have all of that and you you won't have even experienced god in your life men the rain falls on the justin the unjust you can sit in a service you can have tremendous anointing on you you can have an anointing and speak as a prophet a gift of prophecy and never have the baptism of the holy spirit absolutely you can because what it falls on the just and the unjust people have an inclination towards it i know people personally have people in my family that have spoken things in the name of the lord and they never had the holy ghost but yet god operated through them right why because it's without gifts and callings or without repentance right god will use anybody if they're willing but that doesn't mean they're saved it doesn't mean they're a child of god it just means they were willing and they were in the right place at the right time and they were open to what god was wanting to do amen but paul says listen the defining attribute and john john confirms it the defining attribute of god is love when you say god is love that encompasses all of god and everything flows out from that love of god everything that we have whether it's revelation whether it's understanding whether it's faith is an attribute of the very love of god that's working inside of our life amen and he says you can see it recognize an expression of god and that's what all these things are in verse two but he says if you don't have the love of god then you've just got an expression rather than the reality of god in your life what's a reveal mystery anyways that's just god showing his love to you it's giving you a revelation it's giving you an understanding so that you can take a look through things the way god sees it and you can start to move into the things that god wants you to have but he opens it up for you out of love right because that's remember when the the disciples are talking to him he says it's hidden from them it's hidden from them but you're my friends you're the ones i love and that's why i show it to you it's given unto you to understand these things because what you're a part of me because i love you that's why he did it in the first place right but there's a mystery here there's a mystery here but it's a mystery of experience it's not our mystery of words right and that's what we're looking for as we just take these next two services is that we want to be the mystery of love reveal we want to be the mystery of the expression of grace revealed not only for us but for those that are around us if we go back to first john 4 and verse 9 it says in this was manifested the love of god towards us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him so he says the manifestation the proof of god's love was that he sent somebody to take our place that's what god's love does is it takes the place it takes on the burden of somebody else and he says herein is love not that we love god but that he loved us that's a special kind of loves that love somebody when they don't love you and in that love he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins so god's love was and is so great that he loved us when we didn't love him not only did he love us but he made a way for us he removed the barrier he took he tore the veil in half right he took uh something out of the way he looked past our carnal carnality pos passed our human thinking past our faults past our failures and in that he sent somebody to pay our price so that we could approach him what love comes down and what does it do it makes a way and then grace comes and it takes us into his presence love makes a way grace takes us into his presence and that's a theme we'll see throughout this but what did we do to deserve it what did we do to deserve his love it says while we didn't love him yet he loved us so there's nothing we did to deserve it there's nothing listen if there's nothing we did to deserve it then there's nothing we can do to deserve it so don't start trying to get into what a christianity a performance it'll never work you'll never perform your way into the kingdom of heaven you'll never perform your way into a place where god loves you where god gives you gifts that has nothing to do with it while we were yet sinners he gave his life for us amen so don't try and perform your way into this body of christ it is a love gift it is given free you didn't deserve it it is unmerited favor and mercy in your life accept it and receive it and move on in newness of life amen there's nothing we can do we give our lives back but we don't give our lives back as what a try to repay him we give it back as a love gift to him it is a sign of our appreciation for what he did but we can't ever get in our heads that because i give it back to him i'm worthy no your life is unworthy for him what i offer him is worthless that's why i give it to him is because it's worthless i lay it down and then he can burn out all of me and turn it into something that is of use to him that's what we're here for say we say lord i'm useless you died for uselessness but if i give it to you maybe you can turn this piece of trash into something that can be a a sign something that will stand for your kingdom amen we can't do anything first peter 2 says for this is thank where's the if a man for conscience toward god and your grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when we be when you be buffeted for your faults you'll take it patiently or if when you do dwell and suffer for it you take it patiently this is acceptable with god he says so when you've messed up don't pat yourself on the back when you take your beating well that's what he's saying he's saying listen you did wrong doesn't matter how good your response is to your to your your your spanking he says you did wrong so don't sit there and say well i endured the the difficulties of making things right that has nothing to do that he says you messed up except that you messed up and stop messing up and forget about how good you are there's no reward for doing wrong and then holding back when you get the spanking that your mother or your father is giving you right there's no reward in that you've done wrong you're paying a price so don't say well i took that beating so well it doesn't matter how you took the beating you did wrong right but he continues he says for even here unto were you called or in other words he's saying where you are now is for a purpose just like christ was you're in this experience and you're what you're about to go through is for a reason he says because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow that so catch that the love of christ makes us act the way christ did and the things that we go through we go through for the same reason and purpose that christ did amen so you look at the way that christ did it what he acted based on who he was not on what we were as in he was not defined by our response or our lack of response right they were mad at him it didn't change what he did they slapped his face they told him to prophesy they crucified him they whipped him they put a crown of thorns in his head none of that had anything to do with it he says i'm here to do my father's will and guess what you're going to receive what i have for you regardless of what you want he's going to offer it up he's going to say i'm not going to let your actions determine whether or not i give you what you're supposed to get why they didn't know what they needed and so he's coming to them in love and he's giving his life for them and they're sitting there and they're crucifying the prince of glory because they have no idea that he's offering what they have need of and for many of them they didn't realize it until later on the day of pentecost and there's 3000 realized holy cow we just killed the king and their hearts were pricked and they repented for and they got the holy ghost and god started to move there but they had to do it because he had to die but then they come around and they receive the very thing that they they sacrifice and they take his he they they take the the the gift that he's given them amen but he acted on his liberty not on their bondage right he's not defined by what the other person by what we were doing at the time he was operating based on a perfect love that's not looking at the other person there amen he was not bound by our problems or issues so if that's the way he acts then paul's saying that's the way you act now so when you're going to give love it's not going to be whether or not brother david accepts what i need him to accept and when i say accept when brother david's wrong are you ever wrong brother david i don't know i've never caught you in the wrong but when brother david's wrong if i go to him and talk to him and he starts to flash up at me and rail back at me i don't get mad and rail back at him now do i because christ didn't do that what is it i'm gonna go pray for brother david right i'm gonna say well he needs what i've got so i'm going to keep giving it no matter what i'm not going to let brother david define what my message is nor how i respond to him when he comes back at me amen but listen to this it says who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth now none of us can claim that christ could justly say i've done no wrong we can't do that no matter how good we are no matter how good our intentions are we can't go to verse 22 and say that's me so that ought to bring some humility into us every time we enter a situation verse 23 says who when he was reviled reviled not again and when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judges righteously so he could have righteously and correctly spoken up and he could have discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart he could have projected a vision in front of him he could have done whatever it took to prove that i haven't done what you've said i've done he could have righteously and justly done that he could not be blamed for any of these things and be found guilty because he didn't do any of what they said but in that place because he's acting in love he's got to do something for us he did not respond back right he didn't revile back he didn't go back at them with the same attitude that they brought to them what he committed those things to god and he kept his focus on his kingdom purpose who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye are healed for ye as she she ye were a sheep going astray but this is the effect but are now returned under the shepherd and bishop of your soul so he did all that he held himself back he bit his tongues ten thousand angels are sitting there saying let us adam let us at them and he said no no i've got to take this because i've got a love purpose for the people that are even doing this very thing to me amen why so that we can return ourselves to our rightful place rightful meaning where we're supposed to be not because we deserve it but where he said we had to be that's what he had to do to get us back to the shepherd and bishop of our souls this morning amen now paul now john is he's pushed all this on christ and he said this is what christ did right and then paul's doing the same thing here but watch now as john starts to bring it down to us in first john 4 and 11. he says beloved if god so loved us we also ought to love one another now i want to break that down a minute because so often what we there is we say if god loved us we also ought to love one another but there's a very special little word in there that says if god so loved us in other words if god loved us this particular way then we ought to love one another in this particular way the way that god did it is the way we've got to do it so it wasn't that god just loved us it's the way that the way that god loved us is the way that we're supposed to love one another amen so whatever he did were supposed to do the way he did it is the way we're supposed to do it the motive with which he did it is the motive we're supposed to have and the objective for which he had is the same thing that we're supposed to have if we're going to love amen this is a particular way of loving and it is not i'll tell you this it is not the way the world loves today amen the way that he loved is the way he we have to love and there's no variableness neither shadow of turning in christ amen and god there's no change so i don't get to love brother david one way and then brother mark gets a lesser dose of it right because god loves us all equally doesn't he right there's no variableness no shadow of turning so whether brother david is shaking my hand or not shaking my hand that doesn't change my love it shouldn't change my love for brother david does it if we were honest probably if brother david stopped shaking my hand i'd probably say we've got some issues right maybe with me maybe with him but guess what in humanity we'd back away wouldn't we but he's saying no no no that's not the way we do this we've got to love everybody the same way and in the same way so with the same regard with the same amount if i could put it that way and in the same way that christ loves each and every one of us amen amen we give each other the same grace and latitude no matter whose family they're in right no matter whose church they're in no matter which pastor they're under we ought to be able to give every single one the same amount of love and grace and latitude that we give our best friends right because our best friends we're good with best friends but what about our worst friends what if you're number 10 on the ladder right brother paul right what if you're number 10. i got to love number 10 the way i love number one i don't have it here but remember in john he says by this jesus said this to his disciples he says by this shall all men know that you're my disciples if you understand the revelation of the seven seals if you prophesy if you cast out devils if you heal the sick that was not what he said he says by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one to another the defining feature of believers always to love as god did and that will show you how you're going to act in every situation amen and here's the kicker is that what he didn't just love the people that agreed with him at that one particular moment listen jesus came to a world that didn't even realize they needed him they knew that they needed him but they weren't ready for what he had and he preached the message that most of them except 120 refused initially everybody else walked away he lost the majority of his disciples people walked away from him he got accused by church leadership all of these things everything that he brought was what they needed and they turned him down and yet he still loved them for god so loved the world that he gave and gave and gave and gave and gave until he gave his life amen that's what we're talking about is this kind of love amen he didn't love just the ones that were cleaned up because he came to a filthy world we were filthy we were filthy when he came to us amen he came to me right when i could not come to him he came to me so he comes to those that aren't cleaned up he comes to those that don't look like believers doesn't he because guess what before you're a believer you've got to be an unbeliever and guess what unbelievers look like unbelievers right he doesn't come to the ones that have the right doctrine up front speaking to the catholics in the group he didn't come to you because you had the right doctrine did he he came to you when you had the wrong doctrine right he didn't come to the people that dressed right he didn't come to the people that had the right attitude he didn't come to the people with perfect marriages with perfect kids he didn't come to the perfect ministers what did he do he came to those who had a need amen and so your love's got to be able to look to the need and look past what's in front of that need the facade that's there the prickly spines that are there the armor that's built up the the fortress that is trying to hold it back and love's got to look to what's beyond that to say there's something in there that i need to come to amen you say they don't believe like i believe what does it have to do with anything listen when the prophet came nobody believed right because he had to come back and restore them to the truth so that he can restore them to the faith you've got to be restored through truth before you can come to faith and so he's coming and he's preaching to all of them he's preaching to assemblies of god he's preaching to pentecostals he comes out of the baptist church he said all of these people and he's putting all of his energy and time into people that don't agree with him and yet we'll sit here in the message and we'll say well that brother doesn't agree with me so we're just going to put him out listen that's never been the way of christ amen that's never been what we saw in in the life of a prophet here either we ought to be praying for those people we ought to be fellowshipping with those people if you have what they need how are they going to get it unless you'll come and take it right listen if i have to go only to where people will accept my message then i'm not much of a preacher amen you've got to be able to go where it's needed not where it's going to be accepted because how can they come unless they hear the truth right they can be sitting in a cold dead formal message church and think that they're living and they need a they need a life preached to them and unless you come and preach a life to them then they're never going to get it sitting where they are and then you've got to be able to go whether they receive it or not you've got to be able to preach and love regardless of whether the people will take it amen listen i resisted truth until i gave into truth some of us came in easy i didn't come in easy and i'm glad that brother gerald sat or stood and he preached the truth and he preached the truth and he preached the truth why because until i could take it he still had to keep going and still had to be laying in there there has to be a buildup because he's convicting us he's drawing us to him and all he was doing was building up a tsunami of what god's love that would eventually topple over the tower of jonathan corrects humanity and desire to control his life and then that love flows in and in a moment it's done and it's never going to be rebuilt again right jonathan curlett's gone and in that place it stands now jesus christ working in my life what it's a love gift amen it's it's an act of love love love doesn't defeat by by control it defeats by what breaking down what you have and letting you see that there's something bigger than what you've got holding on into in your hands amen brother brown would say it this way he says a few weeks ago in phoenix when i preached on sunday afternoon where there's divisions and men wouldn't hardly speak to one another i've seen around 200 ministers or better walk down to the altar and shake one another's hands and cry over one another's shoulders and say they'd never fuss or be different with one another again he says let that great church of god take that attitude tonight and i'll show you a revival that'll sweep this nation and tear down every nest of hell there is truth no love brother we can preach it till we're horse and our lungs fall out but until the people make a move you'll never do nothing so now he's taking it off the pulp and he's put it in your laps and he's saying you got to do something now we preached it now you got to do something with it that's right you've got to make them move and believe it brethren do it tonight do it tonight stand up for the words stand up for the living word of the living god and god will manifest today men i was talking to some brothers outside church there a while back and i said how should we act if an unbeliever comes into our church if we get a woman walks in here and she's showing some skin what are we to do the guy walks in and he's got tattoos all over and piercings and you know he's got a muscle shirt on what should we do what is the church the church is always a hospital right amen it's always a hospital we bring the sick in and we heal them don't we and so it doesn't matter what they look like now we wouldn't put that sister up at the front of the church now would we our deacons would have some wisdom but listen i don't care how they're dressed you bring them in if you got to cover them up a bit then cover them up a bit but we want them to come in the way they are if we force them to conform before they're convicted then all we're turning them into is legalistic christians and no life comes out of that no life comes out of that amen we ought to be able to bring them in the way they are and let the holy spirit work on them and it will then be a love affair with god rather than a legalistic affair with the man behind the pulpit most often we can't bring them in that way we've got to be a hospital to what the dying to the hurt and half the time they don't even know they're sick until they come in here how many times have we gone to a doctor and he says you got something wrong you say i feel great but he says look your blood work says you got something wrong we got to deal with it they come in here and what under the anointing of the holy spirit which is god's love to us he reveals that they need to make a change and that's what draws them to what living a life for christ it's not because we tell them to do it's because god's drawing them to himself brother braham says in the midst of a perishing dying people a perishing dying nation god so loved the unworthy look how unworthy they were oh if it wasn't for the love of god he'd destroy the whole world tonight but he can't do it his love won't let him do it amen that's me that's me right there unworthy unworthy as all get out amen and i will say that when i walked up to that altar and gave my life to him the only thing i could say is i'm unworthy i'm dirty there's nothing i can do to deserve it i cried and i cried and i cried because i knew i wasn't worthy for his love and grace amen and that's what repentance is is i'm not worthy it's not just i'm sorry but i'm not even worthy that's how that's how much i realize my humanity and and the lack of the of the holiness of god in our lives is that i've got nothing here and that's why i'm coming to you is because i am nothing absolutely nothing he says so he so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but could drink the waters of life freely whosoever will may come just enough of bountiful blessings pouring out he that believeth on me in other words take it like this he that believeth on me shall have a great big gusher right in the middle of his soul bubbling up into everlasting life oh he says what a beautiful thing a great big gusher can you say you've got a great big gusher this morning sometimes we've got a little dribbling stream if we were to be honest sometimes we're pretty dry aren't we sometimes we get there me and brother gerald the only two with our hands up and brother joe there we go and blanca but we do we get dry don't we amen we're going to talk about dryness a little bit tomorrow or on wednesday lord willing but i want you to hold that in your heart are you a great big gusher because that's what we ought to be to a world that has no pure clean living water we got to be a gusher because there's a lot of people need it and there's very few sources for them to get at this work in this world amen we need to have a to give a lot and guess what to give a lot you got to get a lot and that's where we're really going with this is you got to be full before you can give out you can't just be full you've got to be overflowing i like what brother joe adams said i don't know if he told me uh privately or over the pope but he says we need to preach out of the overflow that's really what we're coming is there's something in us bubbling up that's coming out and you say lord we gotta share that with the people and that's what god's doing is he's filling you up with something and it's coming out of your life and you say this is what they need it's so good for me it'll do them some good as well and that's what we're trying to bring this morning is an overflow and listen i'm not preaching from a place if i have it this morning i raise my hand we get dry we get dry but look this is where i want to be right brother gerald this is where we want to be the ministry will face it the toughest and and those that have serving gifts and whatnot because why you're always giving giving giving and you rarely get as much as you give and you know what that means is that you've got to get back in the presence of god every single day to have something to give otherwise you get drawn out and dried out and we turn into legalistic preachers every single time every single time why because you're not preaching out of the overflow and when you lose the overflow is grace and love and when you lose those two things you go straight to the legalistic side of the word and you'll beat the people with it so that's for me and brother gerald to remember that's for us amen now watch the progression now as john starts to move and he's really starting to get onto love with us and he says no man has seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us his love is perfected god's love is perfected he didn't say god's love is perfect in us he says god's love is perfected you know what that means it means there's a progression it means that there's a growth it means that he puts something in and in you it comes to perfection it comes to maturity it comes to completion amen we are an expression of his love and he's bringing us to a place of perfect love that reflects christ perfectly amen now each one of us is going to have a portion of that and it's going to be expressed a different way that's why we have different gifts and different roles and different positions in the body because guess what brother mark has a different role than brother david has a role has a different one than brother joe and brother kingsley brother bob and brother chad and guess what sister betty's different than sister kim and sister leah and sister rebecca ask what we're all going to express it differently but it'll be perfected through you in the vein that you're supposed to to put it out to the rest of the world amen now listen the fruit of the spirit is required of all of us right but love's at the top and that's because the holy spirit dwells in each one of us and that's got to be there no matter who you are but it'll still be displayed in certain ways for each and every one of our lives amen but it's perfected in us it comes to a place of maturity it comes to a place of completion inside of us and that's that great big gusher we're looking for is that you build it up enough that you've got something to give to everybody else that it doesn't just keep you but now it goes out and starts to keep other people as well brother brown says brother sister that's what the world needs today is some more love of god that's what the world's hungry for today is more love of god try and tell them that though try and tell them that but they need it even if they don't realize it you go to a doctor and he says you're short of iron you're short of calcium you're short of this and that and the other thing and you don't know it but as soon as you take it you realize that's exactly what i needed they don't know what they need but we've got what they have need of amen he says if we'd show a little more love to one another a little more love towards god how much better are churches and individuals and how much better we'd be if we just love one another if we love one another then we can love god for god is love and i've been thinking on this for a while months months actually in different situations and different people and they they talking you know what do we do and how do we handle this and what are we going to go and do and i thought you know what if we look at what god's love would do in that situation we probably get a lot of clarity many times now the thing is god's love has a lot of different facets to it right it's not all lovey-dovey right a hug doesn't resolve every situation but that's what the world will say if you give him a hug then everything will be okay listen a hug's no good to somebody that's been abused they don't want a hug they won't take a hug they need something else you know but god's love is perfect because it is god god himself is love that's what the scripture says god is love this is the defining attribute of god so in that love is power there's direction there's provision there's healing everything that is god is baked into that idea of love amen so if you can say what does god's love look like in this situation how did christ love in a situation like this you know how you need to love in that situation now right sometimes it's a word fitly spoken sometimes it's a word fitly unspoken sometimes we need to be quiet sometimes we need to talk sometimes you need to hug sometimes you need to sit back sometimes you need to let people go sometimes you need to pull them in right god's love works in different ways in different situations amen but what he showed his his love on calvary but what he gave his love on the day of pentecost that's what we're looking at he showed his love he proved his love when he gave his life but then he gave his love on the day of pentecost because what he gave us the holy spirit which is god's life which is god's love and that's why it's at the peak here is because this is where love can only come in is when you have the holy spirit inside of you that is the pinnacle of your relationship it's the pinnacle of your christianity is what love but the thing is it starts with love you've got to have that love inside of you otherwise you're not a believer in the first place we read it if god if the love of god isn't in you then you have no part of him right you're nothing you don't have a part of it amen we each one of us if we have the new birth if we have the holy spirit literally have the love of god available to us and to those that are around us in each and every situation now listen to this this is uh this is an interesting thing brother branham said here he says that's the real thing about divine healing and the people know whether you really mean it or not they can tell it and i have learned that in my life walk of life to know that you cannot get by impersonating something you've got to be just what you are how would you like just before i start my sermon if i will give you a little insight of something that's a real secret just to me about healing powers and so forth like that would you like to know a little secret by the way i'm saying you want to know the secret to divine healing you want to know the secret to the gift that he had he says all right here it is friend the secret of the whole thing is divine love divine love is the secret to his ministry he says that's the secret of every bit of it is love now listen to this he says you can't make yourself love you've got to have love so something you possess not something you create you have it you just have it and it will flow out when it needs to flow out if you're submitted to the holy spirit he says love is something that'll work on animal life and it'll work on human life and it works before god that's pretty amazing you say well it was the visions that did it no he says that was the love of god moving out into the people that did all of those things he says i believe paul said in first corinthians 13 do i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not love or charity it profited me nothing though i have all the knowledge to understand all the mysteries of god and have not love though he could do it it profit me nothing and though i have faith to move the mountains and have not love it profit me nothing where there's tongues they'll cease where there's prophecies it'll vanish and where there's these things will all pass away but when love has come it endures forever he says love i have seen its power what all of those things fade when perfect love comes that's what the scripture says there right now he's talking about god's love not love god's love you've got to make a strong distinction there amen human love will get you what the world has today and that ain't what we want if you look at the the world's love it's variable inconsistent prone to emotions prone to hormones prone to moral change but god's love is always absolute and in line with the word it never changes amen god can't love you in a way that's contrary to his word so don't ask him to act in love in your behalf if you're going against the word of god because he can't do it and love you his love will bring you back to the word it won't support you while you're outside of the word and then brother eugene taught me a few things and there's a couple key phrases that that will always stick with me and he said that agape love or god's love is based on spiritual growth meaning that love has a purpose and god's love has a purpose and it is to grow you spiritually first and foremost amen i've said it before god doesn't care about your house god doesn't care about your car doesn't god doesn't care about your health god doesn't care about any of these things if you're not spiritually where you need to be so you ask him and you say lord bless me with this bless me with that bless me with this bless me with that and he says son daughter you're not even talking to me you're not even walking with me you're just doing your own thing and now you're asking me to bless you no no no i'm not going to do it my love is based on growing you spiritually growing you into the image of god that is meant for you and that's the only thing that i care about and everything else will have to go to the side until you come in line with that brother brown would say god will get you to the place where he's got to lay you flat on your back looking up at him with nothing you can do about it to get you in back into that relationship with him to get you where he needs you to be so that he can start moving and walking into your life and he'll take everything away from you and what he'll do is he'll pass everything through the fire until all that's left is you and him now if you commit it to him if it's built for his kingdom purpose it'll stand guess what if you've committed your life to him if you're walking with him your business will stand the pandemic won't it brother joe well you watch if it's not it'll go down into the dust you watch your marriage do it watch your family do it watch your career do it whatever it is if it is not in line with your kingdom purpose then god will say i'll burn it every single time scripture talks about it says every man's good his works are all going to be judged and if they make it through the fire they'll stand and he'll have a reward you'll never lose your soul if you're a son or daughter of god but you lose your reward and what you're doing here can be a reward because you can be a witness for god in your career and your education and these different things that you do but if you're not in line with his word then he can't do anything with you so he's going to bring you back to his place before he ever starts to bless you in those things what he's trying to get you where you say lord i'm sorry i'm not doing what i need to do i need to submit my life to you and let you work through these things and commit it into you the same way that christ did now i've read this next quote before but it stuck with me ever since i read it for me personally and he says jesus in his prayers said father i sanctify myself jesus became sanctified to the church he could have gotten married but he didn't do it he'd be some come sanctified he said sanctify them father through the truth thy word is the truth now let's lay aside every weight you got to wait this morning this is the kind of weights he's talking about you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you ought not to talk he says oh god lay it there now lay it there and watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away watch the love of god lick it up what consume what you're dealing with with love and let that now burn inside of you amen right because the love of god is unquenchable the fire of god is unquenchable once it starts burning it'll keep burning until that's gone right it'll keep burning until it's gone if you'll let it if you don't douse it he says watch all that old selfishness the way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way you've talked about the people in the church lay it on the altar this morning and the fire of god will come down and take it right away and divine love will burn in its place that's how you know that god's done a work is when love replaces everything else that you've had right when that irritation when that frustration when that pain when that hurt when that offense of nature whatever it might be when that is gone and you've got love residing in its place that's when you know the god the working of god is complete in your life amen he finishes with this he says you got sickness lay it on the altar and say lord here it is created me a clean spirit create in me a healing power see what god will do and god will do it this morning you know this is from the message enticing spirits how do you get rid of a spirit you like yeah that's right listen we like some of our spirits it's why we still have them okay this is in our this is in our kitchen now we like it don't we sometimes our carnality likes it guess what i'm built a certain way i got half of my dad and half my mom in here and guess what genetically we like certain things and guess what i can let a spirit get in and start to feed on those things i've talked about i love motorcycles i love cars anything with an engine i can get a spirit on me real quick if i start to dwell on those things right and it'll pull me down a rabbit hole that i don't need to go down right and each one of us has these things whether it's genetic whether it's sometimes we have family traditions sometimes we have church traditions sometimes we have those little besetting sins that we just got something in us likes to do it and guess what that's an enticing spirit because there's something in you that likes it brother brahm says you got to let the love of god overcome that and burn it out of your life until there's nothing left and he says that'll go all the way down to the healing of the sickness in your body let the love of god burn it out amen listen he didn't say love will gently emit a soft heat did he listen he's a he's a raging fire right this is this is not a god that just you know you can kind of just cup your hands around this right we're talking about a raging fire that destroys the carnality of our very lives that's the kind of fire i want and that's the kind of love i want working in my life amen it's something that'll burn out every enticing spirit that's in me or that wants to get around me that that love will overcome it in my life that my love for him will reach out and meet with his love for me and that'll allow him to do the work of me that i need done in my life amen what does it do this is not a fire that just sits there and puts out a bit of heat amen it consumes right it makes you stand back six feet anybody ever built a bonfire that was so hot you couldn't really get close that's that's the love of god amen it reaches out a long ways it hasn't affected man it creates light doesn't it fire creates light it exposes the other things that need to be burnt up in your life and what does it do it creates a warmth that'll draw other people to god as well that's when you know you got the love of god is when you got something that the world wants and people will respond to it and guess what believers respond to it too that's why people can come into our church that have never been here before and we can have immediate relationship with them is because they've got the love of god in their life the same way we do and it is not the love of god like the way the world would explain it but it's the living holy spirit in their lives that connects with us and brother brown remember he's up there in the prayer line he'd say you're a believer why'd he say that because they had the holy spirit he'd say your spirit you've got a warm spirit he says i can work with this now we can talk now we've got a connection he says now we can do something together because i recognize that you got the same thing that i've got and if we put both of it together then something's going to happen here today that's the kind of love we're talking about that's the fire we're talking about amen the love of god's supposed to have the same effect on us amen it's not just lovey-dovey hug your sister hug your brother but it's a love that's effective on you and on those that experience it coming out of you listen to this brother brown says take the man or woman that would put himself down into some cellar and would not see the sunshine the natural sunshine that god has provided for him but he refuses to believe it and because of selfishness he shuts himself off catch that now selfishness is what drives people away from god they don't want what he offers or more importantly they don't want to give up what they have to take what he offers right we're holding tightly to things we need to hold loosely everything in this world we need to hold loosely he says that man will soon become anemic he'll become pale he won't have good strength he won't have health and soon because he has shut himself off from the very privilege that god gave him that's right he did it willfully now he's talking about an unbeliever here but watch this he says then if we shut ourselves off from the glory of god from the baptism of the holy ghost or the fellowship of the spirit the first thing you know we become pale sickly christians now he says you shut yourself off god doesn't turn off the taps folks we turn it off he says our experience is growing out dim and when the great great trials come we shrink and go back it takes that soldier who has lived in the sunlight of god it takes that spirit who knows god where there is not a wave of doubt they can stand in the midst of trouble and cry out my redeemer liveth hallelujah that's it see we shut ourselves off he says we shut ourselves off how do you shut him off turn on something else what are you turning on they do it automatically he's talking about the unbelievers we read in the in the previous paragraph we do it because we want to do it you say brother john a believer shuts off the presence of god yep get hurt bad enough one time you'll shut off the presence of god get offended bad enough one time you'll turn off the presence of god right see god not answer a prayer once or twice and you turn off the presence of god there's all sorts of ways to turn off the presence of god and it's because we get selfish or we get offended usually amen us christians we have to choose to turn off that presence right brother brown said that what the crying of a baby in the service can impact and push away the holy spirit for the next service amen if it's that sensitive then what are we doing in our lives that would turn him off right anything that feeds on belief anything that's of the world anything that is an enticing spirit or has potential to be it that's going to push him away that's going to turn it off and sometimes we don't turn it off what we do is we turn it down to a trickle and guess what a trickle will keep you alive but that's about it that's about it if you had to if you couldn't turn on your tap and get a glass of water every time you needed but you had to sit there and wait for it to drip out one drip at a time you had to sit there for three hours to get a cup full of water guess what you'd get real sick real quick wouldn't you because it's not gushing out it's not coming out right when you need it it's the same thing sometimes it's not that we turn him off it's that we turn him down to such a level that he really can't do anything for us and we're barely staying alive in our christian walks amen but listen to this this is beautiful but god is good he provides it for us too many today don't want to get into that healthy place with god a healthy christian and have a healthy spirit you certainly would rally for a healthy body anybody would sure he says well that body no matter how much health you put in that body it's going back to the dust but oh my brother that soul cannot get too healthy and every time it grows it grows in the strength and the grace and the power of god we need to walk in the sunlight of god because he is good good he's always good how many times have we heard it how many times brother joe say all things work together for the good to them who are the called everything about god is good for you even when it doesn't seem like it anybody ever been through a trial in their christian walk everyone except brother gerald this time we are the trial we've all been through a trial how many of us said this is fantastic loving this trial said nobody ever i'm loving this trial right but still for your good and guess what every one of us if we're believers we can look back on that trial and say praise the lord like job my redeemer liveth amen right marva didn't relevant he did what he said he was going to do he brought me to a place i couldn't get unless i went through that trial you praise him after but it's really hard to praise him going through it but everything about god is good we have a great heritage he says a sacred trust that's been given to us what keep the taps on stay in his presence was that what was that that pamphlet or that little book called practicing the presence practicing the presence is what a believer of this day ought to be doing every single day we ought to be going into the presence of god every single day not a here i lay me down to sleep pray the lord my soul that's not going into the presence right but dedicating time to talk to him and let him talk to you to get into his presence it changes you it changes you amen and hold on to it and hold on to it and seek it and guess what you dwell on him he draws near to you right scripture says draw near to him and he'll draw near to you right dwell on him think about him you want god in your life think about him dwell on him meditate on him that's what david did david was great at meditating wasn't he dwelling on the things of god and that's when god would come to him each and every single time praise the lord first john 14 13 says hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he had given us of his spirit you can't have it without the holy spirit you cannot have it the new birth is the holy spirit it is not a name on a book it's not signing up for something it's not the sinner's prayer it is the holy spirit dwelling inside of you your proof of god's love is that he gives you something capital s and that something causes you to live and love the way he did amen right this is something capital s something that the world can't give and the world can't take it away amen this is brother brahman he's talking about the church on the original day of pentecost he says look they were full of the new wine that's right the wine that come from god out of heaven did you ever see a drunk man he's just in love with everybody you see he don't care that's the way a man is when he gets drunk on the spirit the bible said be not drunk on strong drink with excess but to be drunk on the spirit the spirit of god makes you so drunk you forget all your enemies and everything everybody is in love with you how many of us could say that everybody's in love with you i don't even think we can say within the church much less everybody else amen we're being honest this morning the spirit of god makes you so drunk you forget all your enemies starts with you he says in everything everybody's in love with you i look at that more if i can put my interpretation to it this is us thus saith jonathan corlett what he's saying is that the spirit of god makes you so drunk that you look at everyone as if they're in love with you you know that you'll say they love me even if they don't act it they love me even if they don't realize it potentially they love me that's usually where we end up potentially they love me but what he's saying is you look through you look through drunk goggles that think everybody likes you because what you're so full of love that it just overwhelms anything that anybody else might throw your way he says you don't care who's standing around you you're the biggest man in the country right then those are strong words strong drink strong meat for us amen that we would look at everyone and say i love them so much that it that i think they love me that's a powerful love that says they love me because i love them i don't know much about drunks never been drunk i probably run into a couple you know on the street occasionally but i've heard there's two kinds of drunks brother brahms talking about the friendly drunk and that's supposed to be people that are drunk on the spirit amen everybody is their friend everything's good everything's happy everything's gonna be good that's what he's talking about but there's another kind of drunk and that's a mean drunk again i haven't experienced that one but i've been told about them and that's a drunk that's got a chip on their shoulder when they're normal when they're not drunk they may be the nicest person on the planet but when they get drunk they turn mean and they've got a chip on their shoulder they're looking for fights they're looking to take offense they're looking to get people riled up they're looking for any reason to start a fight right they refuse to give way to allow somebody you're walking down the aisle of the bar or walking down and they're there and they'll put their shoulder out there just to bump you just to say you bumped me right they'll put something out there to get you to what flashback at them and then they say all right it's on the next thing you know you're breaking bottles over their head and you're you're punching them and everything like that that's what a mean drunk is right the only reason they'll start a conversation with you is in hopes of getting into a fight with you right that's a mean drunk amen that satan's kind of drunk that's not the kind of drunk a believer supposed to be if they're in the holy spirit they're not out looking for fights right that's the last thing we're doing is looking for fights guess what the fights are going to come to us no matter what we don't need to go looking for them that's the last thing we need to do is go looking for fights speaking of fights james 4 says from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not thence even of your lusts that warn your members what's he saying carnality is what causes problems in the church right it's not god it's human human tendencies it's when you want what you want more than preferring your brother and sister amen he says you lust and you have not you kill and desire to have and cannot obtain you fight in war yet you have not because you ask not so you're doing all these things to get something and he says you still don't get it listen it says that last bit says yet ye have not because you ask not why because you're trying and you're trying and you're trying and you're trying to do it your way and you're going to do with your gifts and you're going to do with your education your business smarts and you're going to do with your relationships and your contacts and your influence in the community and all these different things and he says all you're doing is causing fights and you're killing your testimony and you're killing your effect on the people around you as a believer and then he says you're wrong because you have not because you don't ask for it you're supposed to ask god commit it to god and then just keep moving he says that's how a child of god gets things is they go to the provider amen the problem is so often we're trying to provide for ourselves he says stop trying to do it yourself ask him trust him commit it to him and keep walking on if you're gonna try and do it all on yourself get ready for a fight because guess what you're going to do it the human way and you're going to get a fight every single time because somebody else is going to want the same piece of land you want somebody else to want the same piece of business you want somebody else going to want the same relationship you want you're going to get into fights and he's saying these are the reasons you have fights amongst you he says you ask he says then when you finally say okay i've had enough it's not working out then he says you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you may consume it upon your lust so when you've done everything you can it doesn't work out then he says you go to god and you ask and then you don't get it because you're still asking for for selfish reasons for carnal reasons rather than for kingdom purpose reasons and god says sorry i can't give that to you because you're my child i won't give it to you specifically because you're my child if it was anybody in the world they'd just get it satan will give it to him but i won't give it to you because you're asking it for the wrong reasons he says you adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god why is he calling them that he's saying you're cheaters why because you're blending what the world and the word he says you're blending your christianity with your carnality and all that's coming out of it is fights in the church knock it off he says whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god wow the enemy of god he says do you think that the scripture says in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lester's envy listen in this body we've got three realms right we've got body soul and spirit the spirit potentially and certainly the body that's that's satan's realm so he says naturally in this body the spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy envy is to want to have what somebody else has he says that's the nature that's human nature you get people saying human nature is kind and good in love no no scripture says the spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy that's natural for us he says oh this is beautiful but he giveth more grace i can say that for me he gave more grace and he gave more grace and he gave more grace and he's still giving more grace because what he's trying to drive that out completely that he's spirit of that so that the holy spirit can have what total preeminence in my life and that's the grace of god that allows us amen he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the unto the humble amen now he'll let us fall and get messed up time and time again that's no problem to god gotta let us fall but he'll pick us up and that's the grace side bring us back in say you want to try this again yes lord let's go again you fall you want to try it again yes lord and he'll keep doing it until you learn your lesson he keeps picking you up and bringing you into his presence that's his grace to us his grace is always there to receive us back he says submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to god and he will draw an eye to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded what's he saying make up your mind and stick to it now this christian walk is not a make up your mind type of thing it's a new birth type of thing make up your mind to get the new birth is really what he's saying and then when you got it stick with it don't go back and forth remember what we talked about the one the one that's sitting on the fence is the most miserable of all because they're not committed either side and it really hurts in their mid region right you don't want to stay on the fence he's saying get off the fence get to one side or get to the other get out of our way or get with us right cleanse your hands get out of whatever it is that's causing you these issues and get on the right side he says be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness and everybody said no thanks how many would read that verse verse nine be afflicted mourn weep let your laughter be turned to mourning your joy to heaviness and say yes please i'd like some of that give me a big plate of verse 9. no we don't want it we don't want it but if you don't do it you don't get verse 10. humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up he'll lift you up if you can only humble yourself yes my speak not evil of one another brethren he that speaketh the evil of his brother and judges his brother speaketh evil of the law and judges the law but if thou judge the law of thou art not a doer of the law but a judge what's he saying don't be a mean drunk so he's saying don't be a mean drunk don't go around picking fights don't go around talking right don't go back to the law let's move to grace listen we're under a covenant of grace now the law is supposed to be dead you can go to the law you want to go the law god will let you go to the law but you don't want to be under the law you believe me you want to be under the covenant of grace right now that's for sure amen now you say well brother john he's wrong she's wrong have to do with anything listen if somebody's genuinely wrong and you have a burden a burden for them go talk to them but don't go talk to them because they're wrong go talk to them because you have a burden for them amen because what love has a purpose and that purpose is to do something is to help them be restored to the word of god amen what don't talk about them go talk to them in love and they'll recognize if you're coming in love now let me stop right here and say this if you're dealing with a child a scriptural child they're not going to recognize love most times because guess what your kids recognize love when you're hugging them they don't recognize love when you're spanking them okay so there's going to be difficult times if you're dealing with an immature believer it's not going to go over so well is it and that's when you got to have maturity to be able to walk away because they're not your kid they're not your kid right they're a child of god and you say lord i'm going with the right attitude going with the right spirit i'm going to go talk i'm going to go try and help them but if they don't take it lord i'll walk away and it will have nothing to do with me not gonna get offended i'm not gonna get hurt i'm not gonna go tell brother so-and-so not gonna tell sister so-and-so i'm just gonna take it to you and leave it with you and commit it in prayer and let you work with them where is hands and feet where is mouth guess what the holy spirit doesn't get up here and without a man here and speak to the church that's not the way it works whether we like it or not you're stuck with brother gerald and i speaking for the holy spirit that's literally what we've got to believe you got to believe that that's what's happening up here will never be of help to you but guess what in the end it's between you and god whether you accept it it's that simple and that's it and guess what we're not going to beat down your doors to try and force it right we don't want legalistic believers right but we don't get into a big fuss about because when you get into a fuss that's when satan has a door to get in when you start fussing about things that's when satan has an open door to come into the situation why because you you know why we fuss it's because we're caught up in who's right rather than the purpose of the conversation or the issue which is to get you back to the word it becomes about you rather than the word and that's when the fussing starts let me give you a quote for it brother brown says this now i said to brother schism and brother ness to answer your question i said now i do not take either side with you brethren and i know as long as you fuss you both are wrong fussing is what he's talking about what back and forth back and forth he said she said he said he said back and forth he says that's never going to be right let your yay be a your navy nay and then walk away if you can't if you can't resolve it he says because i would rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my heart see i said after all it's your heart's condition so what god looked at look god looked past a lot of david's flaws david was far from perfect david had some pretty big hang-ups if you look at you talk about adulterers and adulteresses david was one of them a murderer an adulterer right this was not a man that was perfect but god looked at his heart and david got away with things that nobody else got away with because god looked at his heart now david still got correction right we don't get away we pay for what this flesh does right right be not mocked god is not mocked right whatsoever man souls that shall he also reap grace does not do that grace is what allows us to reap what we sow so we learn the lesson grace is what allows us to see the lesson so that we don't do it again as well amen but you're going to pay for what you do in the flesh but god's looking at your heart and you ought to be able to say lord i did it but i really didn't i didn't mean to do it and that's not the way i it's not the way i lean lord i got caught up in something right i got caught up in something went down a dark path i shouldn't have walked down but lord you know my heart what is it we got dry usually very few people have been in the presence of god and then go get caught up in pornography go out and cheat on their wife right that doesn't happen you get dry and then god takes then you go a place that's what your lust leads you there and all of a sudden you're in a place where you're in problems it's not because god left you it's because you turned off god and walked away and now you've got a problem right but your heart is still right your heart's still right you just got dried out a little bit that's all we don't beat ourselves up just get back into the water get back into the presence get back into the love of god amen brother brown continues he says even if we can disagree with a person if we can't do it in a brotherly way see if christ is in the heart if christ is in the heart then no matter how much you disagree with the men you've still got love and for him and respect that's a tough one i think us ministers can be the worst of that will absolutely destroy a man from this pulpit because he doesn't believe the way we believe listen you had the prophet of the age and almost nobody had the truth and you don't see him destroying men over the pulpit like that right now listen sure you probably aren't going to send people to a brother's church if you don't think he's preaching right you got no no right to true him down over the pulpit that's not what this is for we're here to preach the word right not to preach it out of somebody else he says i disagree with many men many times that's putting it lightly but still i've never seen one yet i disagree with that i ever thought of any more than put my arm around him and call him my brother and try to help him the best i could i disagree with him because i think that maybe upon disagreeing that what he believes that i might not believe just like him and so forth but now i might try to project my way to him as he projects his to me and get them together and comb out and see what we got but disagreements like that just as far as it comes to we should never get angry or want to hurt or destroy or anything we should always be trying to build up amen amen i believe brother bryant said something to the this will be a massive paraphrase but he says add to what they have don't destroy what they have find the truth they've got and it might only be that jesus saves and build off of that don't destroy their their baptist background don't destroy their catholic background build on the one thing that you can find and it may only be one thing build on the one thing they've got that's true and build on that and the rest will crumble because it's not a part of the building anymore and they're not going to keep building on it if they accept the truth that'll fall away in time build on what is solid in their life and leave the rest to god and let him take it out amen praise the lord what never get angry or want to hurt or destroy or anything we're talking about god's love now he says a little brother come not long ago a little church of christ brother and oh he stood up there and he said this guy's a devil brother branham said he says of the holy ghost he says there's no such a thing well only the 12 apostles have received the holy ghost and divine healing was only given to those 12 apostles and went on about a half hour and i said just a moment brother i think you ought to give me a chance to defend this see then brother brown kind of gives a rebuttal i left it out for the sake of time but then he continues and he says but after it was over he said but i said i forgive you for calling me a devil because i know you didn't mean that and then when he got finished he come and he said there's one thing i can say you have the spirit of christ i said now brother which am i a devil or of christ how can i be how can i have the spirit of christ and not actually preach of christ it's impossible right he can't deny himself so there's a problem i'm sure that brother maybe walked away a little stumped with it especially when you have a man that's healing the sick amen and he's saying he doesn't believe it and it's happening in front of him he says see but i tell you see because that man he could tell that i loved him no matter he was disagreeing and horribly disagreeing and lambasting we don't use that word lambasting basically means just hitting you over and over and over again verbally he says he did all that to me but in the end he said he had the brother abraham you've got the spirit of christ i'll give you that much don't agree with you still but i'll give you this much you got the spirit of christ he says if you can't disagree with a man and things and then shake his hand and still have the same feelings toward him then there's something wrong with you if i can't disagree with a man bitterly from one side to the other what he's saying if you can't have a conversation and you don't agree on anything anything and still think of much as much of him as christ would then there's something wrong with my spirit he says i haven't the spirit of christ see if he says well brother brahma i believe you're teaching is this that all right brother let's come together to reason you and i will take it ourselves we'll go over in the room to ourself and we'll reason it out he said if you've got a disagreement go sort it out don't talk to the pastor don't talk to the deacon don't talk to mom don't talk to dad go sort it out let's sort it out amongst ourselves if we can now listen to what happens in that room and he just cuts me to pieces and i have to say things back to him oh this is going to be a lovey-dovey conversation no sometimes it's a hard conversation isn't it he says he cuts me to pieces now i don't believe brother brad and ryle back at him but brother brown probably had to say things back that weren't easy for that man to hear he says if in my heart i can't feel the same about him that he's still my brother and i'm trying to help him then i'll never help him there's no way for me to help him if i don't love him what's the use of going over there wow but you're right brother brown doesn't matter if i don't have the right spirit tell him the first place brother i don't love you and let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because i can't help you until i love you wow wow that's tough preaching i'm glad it's not me saying it that's tough preaching where you wouldn't even have a conversation over a difficulty with somebody if you couldn't go in first and say i love you but i'm saying i have to get that out of me before i can even go and have that conversation because i can't help him if i don't love them if i don't love them then my motive and objective is wrong regardless of if i'm absolutely correct on my doctrine on my position everything else if i can't love that person before i go in there i'll never help them what's he talking about he's talking about how to keep your spirit right even if you bitterly and completely disagree with another brother or sister wow romans 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith unto this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of glory of god verse 5 says and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given to us that phrase shed abroad means it's poured out it's gushing it's spilling so the love of god is poured out it's gushing it's spilling in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given into us so if it's gushing into us it ought to be gushing out of us that's what he's saying is he's saying if it's given freely you've received freely give right if if you're saying i've got a gushing christian experience then we ought to be seeing it come out of our lives right it can't be filling you up and it not be overflowing eventually we ought to see the overflow eventually amen amen don't let what's he saying don't let the love of god just be for you amen let it be for everyone else that comes into contact with you because if it's shed abroad it's going to overflow because the love of god never just gives you a little bit it overflows you that it's got to conquer it's got to conquer you it's got to overflow it's not just pressing out right but it's gonna overflow if the blessings of god are pressed down shaking together and coming out then guess what the blessing of the holy spirit and your life ought to be doing the exact same thing right it's got to be flowing out of you it's something greater of you it's a wellspring of the very life of god that rises up to meet the challenges that you face brother batman put it this way he says if i have found grace in your sight through god you take my word for this brothers if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely done you wrong and you know he's done you wrong he's done you evil now catch the distinction here he's not just saying somebody's done you wrong he's saying somebody's done you evil what is evil evil is the absence of god he's saying somebody's really put one on you somebody's done something that has no place in the life of a christian to you he's not talking about somebody that's done it and then asked forgiveness or tried to make it right he's talking about somebody that has done something completely off the word to you and they don't recognize it and they're not doing anything about it listen to this he says don't mention that take him to prayer before god and oh don't take it in just a selfish way and say well i'm supposed to do this this is my christian duty to take brother chad before the lord in prayer because once again he forgot to mow my lawn whatever it is that's not evil brother chad what's he saying you don't say it's my christian duty now this is what a christian does so i'm going to do it ouch that's what he's saying don't be selfish it's selfish because what you're propping yourself up to say well this is what a christian does so i will do it everybody watch me as i do what a christian ought to do in this situation no no no no no no you need to repent that's our attitude we need to repent he says but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of god our father way a prayer should be made in the presence of god and say father here's my brother and he justly deserves punishment because he has done the evil and i don't see why he did it that's the most difficult prayer to praise when you don't even understand why they did it in the first place watch this remember he says stand in the presence of god the way a prayer should be made in this situation you've got to get into the presence of god this ain't a casual prayer this is in the prayer of five minutes this is going and laying before the presence of god until he comes down and does something and this is what he does he says then let god go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through maybe he didn't say you would he said maybe he says god will show you what that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of god you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother now listen to this he says and when you get back to earth again that's why i said this isn't a prayer five minutes this is a prayer that takes you somewhere and it's a prayer that takes you into the presence of god where he changes your complete approach and thoughts about this situation that's how you know you've been the presence says you've caught his mind now and not only with his mind but you've now caught what you need to do the way he would do it that's what we're looking for that's the kind of presence we're looking for is that it changes us and puts us now into his role instead of in our carnality he says and when you get back down to earth again you'll go over to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of god and condemn anybody i don't believe no sir even if he's a rank sinner i want to say this as we start to close we don't i i'll speak for myself there are moments in life where you know god is there it's it is very real it is it you know it and you can't barely move i can't at least you just sit there and you're still and that love and that presence of god washes over you and when you're in that situation i'll say for myself if you've had any issues with people in myself i'll say this when i'm in that presence all i'm thinking is forgiveness and restoration because i'm sitting there and i'm sitting in the sovereign holy presence of god and guess what that levels us all that levels us all right there's no good ones there's no big ones there's no great ones we're all dead flat wrong in that presence and it's only the blood of christ that allows you to sit there and enjoy it in the first place and so the same blood that covers my sins covers brother chad's sins amen when he doesn't mow my lawn right it's the same blood it's the same thing for him and i and so it doesn't matter does it so i'm sitting there and you went brother brandon's saying when you get in that presence he says you won't condemn you won't throw an accusation there's only one that can accuse in the presence of god not satan scripture says he's the accuser of the brethren in that presence you can't do anything but what look for restoration and forgiveness for that person he says you'll come out he says and you'll go to that brother you'll go that sister you'll put your arm around him and you'll say what i love you right shake his hand because you know what he's been through amen right what is it you know when you're in that presence that you can't do anything that would make you right that would make you good that would make you acceptable in the beloved it's all through christ and so all you're saying is lord let him let her get in the same presence that i'm in so they'll realize what they need to do and they need what they need to move into amen that's all we're trying to do what are we doing here we're creating an atmosphere aren't we when we're in a service we're creating an atmosphere for what people to be changed it's a hospital right and every one of us is still sick because we're in this body every one of us is sick so when we're coming in here we're looking for not just brother chad to get better right we're not just looking for brother gerald we're not just looking for sister lydia we're not just looking for brother kingsley but we're coming in we're saying lord as long as i'm in this body i'm sick and i need an overflowing i need a gushing of the presence of god in my life to wash those wounds out to take away the genetics to take away the traditions to take away the false religion all of these things to get it out of our lives and let your love take over amen first peter 4 says but the end of all things is at hand is the end of all things at hand we're at the end we're we're we're we're seconds to midnight on the on the the doomsday clock right it is so close it is so close it says but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sail sober and watch unto prayer and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins now this word fervent here is not what we normally think no for us fervent would typically be you know hot or boiling or zealous that's what we use and every other instance of the word in the scripture that says fervent refers to that hot boiling zealous this fervent charity is a completely different word and it's the only place that's used in the entire bible right because that fervency fervency tends to fizzle out the way we normally talk about it right it's only good for a while brother brahma i was listening to a tape the other day and he says you gotta you know he says you're pentecostals he says you blow it all out the chimney when you're in service and then you've got nothing left for the rest of the week he says you can't even put your shoulder to the wheel because you blew all your praise and all your energy and all your love out the pipe in the service he says and you walk out and you got nothing to give that's usually the fervency we're talking about hot boiling and then they walk out the next day and they just fall flat on their face because they have nothing left but this fervent charity this word fervent means this is this is amazing stretched strenuous continuous and earnest and when i was looking at it they say that the kind of the the phrase that covers all of this is that this is the maximum potential so if you take a an elastic band this is elastic band love where it's pulled tight and it's it's just quivering you ever pull an elastic band you ever see that maybe people have been around construction you get pulling on a cable so tight you get a cable to its maximum tightness and it'll just sit there and it'll vibrate it so tight that's the maximum love that we're talking about where that love is so tight where there's so much energy in it that it will vibrate that's the kind of thing we're talking about he says this is the kind of love that i'm supposed to have for you and you're supposed to have for me is that it's the maximum potential you give everything that you have inside of you to what meet the needs of the body to cover a multitude of sins that's a lot of sins it's not just the one-time sins it's the multitude of sins that's a that's a bundle as we would say that's the kind of love that that will cover a multitude of sins is one that's at its maximum potential it's giving every bit it's got every fiber is straining to let that love come out and do the work that it has to do in our lives and let's stand together if we would maximum potential love is what we're talking about amen why because it's got to be god's love and god's love is the only thing that'll conquer it's the only thing we'll conquer our human love will conquer guess what our marriages don't stay together because of human love right our marriages stay together because we have the god's love inside of us that's the only thing that'll do it right people will stay together in life but they won't love each other through life they'll stay together because they have nobody else better to go to they're too old or too poor whatever it is but we stay together wide because we've got god's love in us and it binds us together and it's no different with the body a man it's got the maximum potential it'll do what's required for the situation you can't overcome god's love it overcame us to overcome everything that the devil's thrown at us so there's nothing we should face amongst ourselves there's nothing we should face in our families nothing we should face in the church body that can't be overcome by looking at it through the lens of god's love amen that's the kind of love that's going to cover every fault every failure that comes over this pulpit that resides in the pews from
