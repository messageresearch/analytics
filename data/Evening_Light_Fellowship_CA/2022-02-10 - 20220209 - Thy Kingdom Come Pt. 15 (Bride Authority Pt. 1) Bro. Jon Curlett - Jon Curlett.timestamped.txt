[41:04] lives and into our situations lord daily
[41:07] lord with the promise of your word going
[41:09] before us each time lord god

[41:41] amen if you can turn in the scriptures
[41:42] to esther chapter 8.
[41:44] esther chapter 8 it's good to be back in
[41:46] the house of the lord once again amen
[41:48] certainly looking forward to sunday
[41:49] where we'll have
[41:51] uh if if not all of us certainly the
[41:52] majority of us here again
[41:54] and then certainly looking forward to
[41:55] that i did want to thank brother bob and
[41:58] the musicians that have stayed true to
[41:59] their commitment and they're staying at
[42:01] their post of duty and it's not easy i
[42:04] know from a preaching standpoint it's
[42:05] not easy to come up here when it's a
[42:06] much smaller crowd and we certainly like
[42:09] to have lots of people in the seats
[42:10] pulling and and doing their part it's
[42:12] always tougher or often it's tougher
[42:14] with a smaller crowd but certainly feel
[42:16] for the musicians because they kind of
[42:17] can feel alone up here i think minister
[42:19] always speaks alone but with the the
[42:21] singing and the plane they can feel a
[42:22] little more isolated so i certainly
[42:24] appreciate that
[42:25] from them amen
[42:27] amen esther chapter 8 verse 1
[42:30] says on that day did the king of
[42:31] hajwaris give the house of haman the
[42:33] jews enemy unto esther the queen
[42:35] and mordecai came before the king for
[42:37] esther had told what he was unto her and
[42:40] the king took off his ring which he had
[42:42] taken from haman and gave it unto
[42:44] mordecai and esther set mordecai over
[42:46] the house of haman and esther spake yet
[42:48] again before the king and fell down at
[42:50] his feet and besought him with tears to
[42:52] put away the mischief of haman the
[42:54] agagite and his device that he had
[42:56] devised against the jews then the king
[42:58] held out the golden scepter toward
[43:00] esther so esther arose and stood before
[43:03] the king and said if it please the king
[43:05] and if i have favor in his sight and the
[43:08] things seem right before the king and i
[43:10] be pleasing in his eyes let it be
[43:12] written to reverse the letters devised
[43:14] by haman the son of hemadatha the
[43:16] agagite which he wrote to destroy the
[43:18] jews which are in all the king's
[43:19] provinces
[43:21] for how can i endure to see the evil
[43:22] that shall come unto my people or how
[43:25] can i endure to see the destruction of
[43:27] my kindred
[43:28] then the king ashware said unto the
[43:30] esther the queen and to mordecai the jew
[43:32] behold i have given esther the house of
[43:34] haman and him have they hanged upon the
[43:36] gallows because he laid his hand upon
[43:38] the jews
[43:39] write ye also for the jews as it liketh
[43:42] you in the king's name and seal it with
[43:44] the king's ring for the writing which is
[43:46] written in the king's name and sealed
[43:48] with the king's ring may no man reverse
[43:51] amen god bless the reading of his word
[43:53] you may have your seats tonight
[43:55] and then we're continuing on with our
[43:57] regular scheduled program on the series

[44:13] will to just speak to the church as a
[44:16] totality to the full bride of christ the
[44:17] men and the women both alike amen so i
[44:20] want to take this this idea of bright
[44:22] authority and we've talked a lot about
[44:23] the position of women about what god
[44:25] says makes a godly woman about where
[44:27] their their beauty is and where their
[44:29] strength is and we've covered the
[44:31] respect and the consideration that these
[44:33] women are due when they're in alignment
[44:34] with the word of god and we've taken a
[44:36] look at what god thinks of those women
[44:38] that do that amen and he puts them in a
[44:39] high position
[44:41] we've talked about the right attitude of
[44:42] a woman and that attitude is of always
[44:44] of submission amendment of respect and
[44:47] we know that that's reflective of our
[44:48] walk as believers amen it is always one
[44:50] of submission to the word of god and it
[44:52] is one of respect to the god that has
[44:54] called us to serve him and to love him
[44:56] amen
[44:58] and we know that if we're in a
[44:59] relationship with god it comes with
[45:00] great benefits and then there's a great
[45:02] benefit package to the bride of christ
[45:04] but she's not there for the benefit
[45:06] package she is there for the benefactory
[45:08] men she is there because she loves him
[45:10] not because of what he has but she
[45:12] certainly enjoys what he has and we want
[45:14] to take a another service maybe as we go
[45:16] into some of those things
[45:18] but i want to review first how we got to
[45:20] this scripture and esther because we see
[45:22] here that the king gives esther great
[45:23] authority that esther is given the
[45:25] opportunity to write whatever she would
[45:27] want written and the king would enforce
[45:29] it but she didn't just get there when
[45:31] she became the queen and if we look in
[45:33] the scriptures we'll see that she did
[45:34] not get the authority of a queen as soon
[45:36] as she became queen but rather there is
[45:38] a period of time there that there's a
[45:40] relationship that's built up between her
[45:42] and the king before he would ever say
[45:44] something like what she gets here and
[45:45] before he ever gives her the authority
[45:47] to use the full power of his kingdom in
[45:50] something that she would require to have
[45:51] done amen and we know that it's no
[45:53] different for the bride of christ that
[45:54] you do not become a believer that you do
[45:56] not just get the holy spirit and then
[45:58] whatever you say and whatever you want
[46:00] god will do and then if we look in the
[46:01] scriptures we always see that there's a
[46:03] progression that there are tiers or
[46:05] levels of authority within the bride of
[46:06] christ within the believer's ranks and
[46:09] we know that god has to take us to a
[46:11] place where we are proven where he
[46:13] trusts us where he can give us full
[46:15] authority and we won't abuse it for our
[46:17] own purposes amen now we know redemptive
[46:19] blessings are always available to us if
[46:21] you are a believer then you have
[46:22] blessings of healing of salvation of
[46:24] deliverance of provision all these
[46:26] different things amen and that has
[46:27] nothing to do with your maturity as a
[46:29] believer that has nothing to do with
[46:30] your relationship except that you are a
[46:33] child you are a son you are a daughter
[46:35] of god if you are saved by the blood of
[46:37] christ you have access to the redemptive
[46:39] blessings that he gave us when he died
[46:40] on the cross for us amen but when we
[46:42] start to talk about authority now we're
[46:44] talking about something different this
[46:46] is not just because you're saved but
[46:48] this is because you've been
[46:49] brother bam speaks in the in the message
[46:51] on adoption but you've come to a place
[46:53] where you do the thing that he would do
[46:55] in that situation even if he hasn't told
[46:57] you what to do remember you have the
[46:59] character of christ where you have the
[47:00] nature of christ and in that proving
[47:02] comes the authority that he wants to
[47:04] give the bride man it's like the
[47:06] military we have men that are generals
[47:08] we have men that are colonels we have
[47:09] men that are captains we have men that
[47:11] are privates at the very bottom don't we
[47:13] and each and every one of them has
[47:14] different levels of authority but nobody
[47:16] steps into the army and becomes a
[47:18] general that day and nobody comes in but
[47:20] they have to prove themselves and how do
[47:22] they prove themselves they proved
[47:24] themselves by what perfect and full
[47:26] obedience to the orders they were given
[47:27] to carry out what they've been told to
[47:29] do and as long as they've been given the
[47:31] tools as long as they've been given the
[47:32] weapons as long as they've been given
[47:34] what they need to get the job done
[47:36] anybody that gets anywhere in the
[47:37] military does it and then they they
[47:39] achieve what the goals and the tasks
[47:40] that they've been given you don't get
[47:42] promoted in the military by being
[47:44] incompetent or disobedient amen and it's
[47:46] no different when it comes to the
[47:48] christians and and the kingdom of heaven
[47:50] you don't get to a place of full
[47:52] authority if you are incompetent or
[47:54] disobedient amen in disobedience means
[47:56] that you're taking things in the way
[47:57] that you want to take them and you're
[47:58] applying them in the way you want to
[48:00] apply them and they're doing things that
[48:01] you want done rather than what god wants
[48:03] you to do amen and we see that as we
[48:05] look through the scriptures as we look
[48:06] at great men and even great women we see
[48:08] that no men were given great
[48:10] responsibility without a time of proving
[48:12] without a time of training in the time
[48:13] of testing you look at moses we look at
[48:16] joshua we look at joseph joseph the
[48:19] closest type of christ in the bible and
[48:20] he put him through jail for how many
[48:22] years and had him unfairly accused and
[48:24] all these different things to test his
[48:26] attitude to see what he would do amen
[48:28] you look at david david
[48:29] anointed king didn't ask for it and then
[48:32] he has to run around for 10 or 15 or 20
[48:34] years uh trying to save his life from
[48:36] the very one that he respected so much
[48:38] in and wouldn't take the life of in king
[48:40] sully man but what is it god trained
[48:42] them until the point that he could trust
[48:44] them to do the job that he had anointed
[48:46] them to do in the first place amen i was
[48:48] listening to the service that brother
[48:49] joe had sent out to the to the group on
[48:51] whatsapp and he was talking about
[48:54] the these men and and god has to bring
[48:56] them to a place where he knows what
[48:58] they're going to do before they ever do
[49:00] it and not just because he's god but
[49:01] because they've proven it time and time
[49:03] again amen god puts them in a position
[49:06] of great authority where they know what
[49:08] god's purpose and will is and they will
[49:09] do only that with that power and
[49:11] authority that he's given amen it
[49:13] reminds me of when you get married and i
[49:15] can say for myself and i'm sure many of
[49:17] us do when a man marries a woman he adds
[49:19] her name to the bank account doesn't he
[49:21] and she has full access to every cent
[49:23] that he has in that bank account it's a
[49:25] joint account if she wants to go into
[49:27] that bank and empty that account she
[49:29] does but i would guarantee that most of
[49:31] us when we give that card to our wife
[49:33] the first time or we give her the credit
[49:35] card the first time we say this is tied
[49:37] to my accounts you can buy whatever you
[49:38] need with it but we don't tell her she
[49:40] can go buy a car if she needs right we
[49:43] put a limit on what she can buy we say
[49:45] this is for you to buy groceries this is
[49:47] if you're an emergency and you need food
[49:48] or you need clothing or something but
[49:50] everything else i need you to talk to me
[49:52] about and even groceries for a while
[49:53] let's discuss that i have a budget i
[49:55] have a type of a way i need things done
[49:57] so let's talk that over but as she
[50:00] starts to grow and as the relationship
[50:02] starts to grow and as she spends more
[50:03] time with her husband and she knows the
[50:05] way he thinks and she knows the way he
[50:07] likes things and whatnot then soon that
[50:09] starts to relax just bit by bit and bit
[50:11] and pretty soon she can go out and just
[50:12] buy something and she doesn't have to
[50:14] text or call her husband before she buys
[50:16] it why because she has his vision
[50:19] embedded in her and she knows when she
[50:20] sees something that he would
[50:22] automatically say yes or no to that and
[50:24] based on what he would do she does the
[50:26] same thing so my wife if she knows i'm
[50:28] looking for a generator and she sees one
[50:30] in costco for 30 percent off and it's
[50:32] the last one there she knows that she
[50:34] can buy that and when she brings it home
[50:36] i'm not going to tear her head off for
[50:37] spending a thousand dollars why because
[50:39] i've told her i need to get a generator
[50:41] and i'm looking for a good deal she sees
[50:43] it and gets a great deal for me i'm
[50:44] gonna be happy and i'm gonna be glad
[50:46] that she took that initiative why
[50:47] because she's tied into my vision she's
[50:49] tied into the needs of the family and
[50:51] she's not putting herself above it but
[50:53] she's using what i've given her for the
[50:55] kingdom purpose and then she's using it
[50:57] for the good of the family and whatnot
[50:59] there the money is there the needs there
[51:00] and so my wife would buy it and so would
[51:02] yours i would imagine amen but on the
[51:04] flip side as things grow and as the
[51:06] relationship matures she can look for
[51:09] something for a long time that she would
[51:10] like and she can go buy it eventually
[51:13] and the same thing she doesn't come back
[51:15] and
[51:16] and the husband would say what are you
[51:17] doing with this but he knows that she
[51:19] would never spend the money frivolously
[51:21] until all the needs of the family are
[51:22] met and then she's not going to endanger
[51:24] the finances of the family she's not
[51:26] going to endanger the needs of the
[51:27] family to get what she wants him and
[51:29] she's not going to go out and buy
[51:31] gucci purses and and fancy jimmy choo
[51:35] shoes and and chanel numbers one two
[51:37] three four five six and seven for her
[51:39] perfume counter right if the family
[51:42] doesn't have groceries there he trusts
[51:44] what she's going to use that money for
[51:46] and she has full access and the greater
[51:48] the trust the greater that he the
[51:50] greater latitude he gives sir amen
[51:52] so it's the same thing with god with us
[51:54] is that he gives us a little bit and he
[51:56] sees if we'll use it according to his
[51:58] purpose his kingdom purpose or will we
[52:00] take it and run to create a name for
[52:02] ourselves to create a life of ease or
[52:03] luxury for ourselves if we'll try and
[52:05] prop ourselves up or will we give the
[52:07] glory to him and it based on how we use
[52:09] what he gives us then he decides whether
[52:10] to add to it or take away from it or
[52:12] maybe hold us steady for a while to
[52:14] teach us a little bit more amen it's
[52:16] that trusting and proven relationship
[52:18] brother bob that we know so well isn't
[52:20] it it's a trusting relationship where he
[52:22] knows that you are not going to abuse
[52:23] what he's given you
[52:25] amen what is it we've tempered our
[52:27] inclinations that are there naturally to
[52:30] align with what he wants us to do
[52:31] spiritually amen brother braham says it
[52:33] this way he says god has to find someone
[52:35] that he can trust somebody that he can
[52:38] have confidence in
[52:40] and can have confidence in god that can
[52:42] believe him so this is a two-way street
[52:44] god's looking for someone that can trust
[52:46] him but he's looking god's looking for
[52:48] someone that he can trust but he's also
[52:50] looking for somebody that will trust god
[52:52] because it's no good if he trusts you
[52:54] but you don't trust him and then it's a
[52:55] two-way street you've got to be trusting
[52:57] him as much as he is trusting you he
[52:59] says you believe that don't you sure god
[53:02] has to find somebody who he can put his
[53:04] confidence in and then when he finds
[53:06] such a man that he can put confidence
[53:08] and his power in
[53:10] a man that will follow the road that
[53:12] will stay right on the map see and go
[53:14] right on till he comes to the place of
[53:16] power
[53:17] faith will lead him to that because he's
[53:19] got faith in the word and it'll lead him
[53:21] to the promise he'll lead him to power
[53:24] and power will lead him to the promise
[53:26] notice there he says the power of god
[53:28] will lead you to the promise of god we
[53:30] don't run around like a chicken with his
[53:32] head cut off using the name of jesus
[53:34] christ to get ourselves out of
[53:35] situations to try and address every
[53:37] single thing that we get into where we
[53:38] have a need where there's a bit of
[53:40] discomfort or anything we don't go there
[53:42] flashing the name of jesus like an
[53:43] unlimited credit card do we that's not
[53:46] what he gives it to us for but we have
[53:47] trials we have tribulations and we have
[53:49] difficulties for a purpose and we aren't
[53:51] going around trying to use the name of
[53:53] jesus as a get out of jail card at all
[53:54] amen what we look to the word and see
[53:57] where our authority is to use the power
[53:59] of the authority that he gives us amen
[54:01] that's what he's saying a man that's
[54:02] following the leading of god a man that
[54:04] or a woman that god has confidence in
[54:07] will take whatever power authority he's
[54:09] given and he'll go to the word and say
[54:11] what does the word say that i'm allowed
[54:13] to do with this or what does the word
[54:14] say i'm supposed to do with this you get
[54:17] men that have a gift of healing and
[54:18] they'll sell it out won't they they'll
[54:20] go and you get this guy like peter papa
[54:22] of her one off and he starts selling
[54:24] miracle healing water for 25 for a
[54:26] little bit right that has nothing to do
[54:28] with the gift of god but maybe he's had
[54:30] some success in healing and he uses it
[54:32] to monetize it and make himself a
[54:34] wealthy man god's not going to honor
[54:36] that man for very long and he's going to
[54:37] go into destruction eventually amen but
[54:40] god's looking for somebody when they
[54:41] find themselves with a gift when they
[54:43] find themselves with authority when they
[54:45] find themselves being inclined to do
[54:46] something they go to the word and say is
[54:48] this right before i do it and then
[54:50] they'll apply it in that way
[54:52] brother banham says in adoption he says
[54:54] god knows how much he can trust you he
[54:56] knows how much he can trust me
[54:59] he says listen to this could you imagine
[55:01] a little mouse about that long under the
[55:04] great garners of egypt saying i just
[55:06] better eat two grains a day it may not
[55:07] last through the winter and then when
[55:09] joseph built those great big garners for
[55:11] the wheat that were supposed to last
[55:12] seven years he's saying you got a little
[55:13] mouse under there and he says i can only
[55:15] eat two grains a day otherwise i might
[55:16] run out
[55:18] when you've got tons and tons of it
[55:19] above he could eat every day all day and
[55:21] he'd never run out he says oh my he
[55:24] wants you to ask abundantly so that your
[55:26] joys could be full don't be afraid to
[55:28] ask god for anything for he's willing
[55:30] more willing to give it than you are to
[55:32] receive it if we just get that little
[55:35] shadow wiped away to know he's willing
[55:37] to do it
[55:39] you've got to have a revelation that god
[55:41] wants to give you what you're asking for
[55:42] if you can have faith in it you've got
[55:44] to have faith brother brahm says faith
[55:46] is a revelation of the will of god
[55:48] you've got to believe that it's god's
[55:49] will for you to receive what you're
[55:51] asking for otherwise you're asking what
[55:53] in doubt not in faith he says you're his
[55:56] children he loves you you know how you
[55:58] like to minister and do good things to
[56:00] your children
[56:01] that very strain of fatherhood of a
[56:03] parent to your children comes from god
[56:05] because he's the father of us all and he
[56:08] loves us and he wants to do for us now
[56:10] watch this it says if he can just get us
[56:13] lined up with the blessings and so forth
[56:15] now that's great we want to get lined up
[56:17] with the blessings but watch what he
[56:18] says next and he can trust us
[56:22] then the heavens is open to all of us so
[56:25] we got the blessings here but he says
[56:27] he's getting us to the place where he
[56:28] can trust us to actually receive the
[56:31] blessing again we're not talking about
[56:32] redemptive blessings now but we're
[56:34] talking about kingdom authority we're
[56:36] talking about the the ring of uh and the
[56:38] seal of god amen of the king as well
[56:41] amen so we read that esther had this
[56:43] great deal of authority in this opening
[56:45] scripture in esther eight but she did
[56:46] not get there just by marrying the king
[56:49] but there's something that happened
[56:50] along the way to bring her there and i
[56:51] want to go back a bit and bring us
[56:53] through this to set the type and this is
[56:55] just a type it's a shadow it's not a
[56:57] perfect type of shadow but it gives us
[56:59] an idea of how we're supposed to
[57:00] approach god when it comes to this thing
[57:02] called bright authority
[57:04] esther 2 and verse 12 says now when
[57:06] every maid's term was come to go to go
[57:08] into king of hegeweris after that she
[57:10] had been 12 months according to the
[57:12] manner of the women for so were the days
[57:14] of their purifications accomplished to
[57:16] wit six months with oil of myrrh and six
[57:19] months with sweet odors and with other
[57:21] things for the purifying of the woman
[57:23] you know why he said other things is
[57:24] because he couldn't list them all
[57:26] right we know how women are with their
[57:28] beauty regimens don't we there's too
[57:29] many things to put a name on and that's
[57:31] why he says just all the other stuff
[57:33] there's a lot guys we know what went
[57:34] into this amen but i want you to
[57:36] understand that before the any woman
[57:39] went into the king to be presented as to
[57:40] whether he would choose her his queen
[57:42] queen she had to go through 12 months of
[57:45] work
[57:47] and the first six months were with the
[57:49] oil of myrrh
[57:50] now i looked it up and that oil of myrrh
[57:52] has a number of wonderful properties for
[57:55] for for a person's body especially for a
[57:57] woman it is called the world's greatest
[58:00] exfoliation regimen is the oil of myrrh
[58:03] and when they talk about this it's a
[58:05] it's a scraping and a rubbing that they
[58:08] do with this so it's not just simply
[58:10] they pour the mirror on and it does its
[58:12] work but it is scraped and rubbed over
[58:14] their body and it was for the women it
[58:16] was to help heal the dry cracked and
[58:18] skin that was damaged by the wind and
[58:21] dust in the sun
[58:22] so it was it was curing the issues that
[58:24] they had on the outside first of all
[58:27] and then it is anti-bacterial
[58:29] anti-fungal
[58:31] anti-cancer and it's an astringent so it
[58:33] cleans and it purifies and draws out all
[58:36] the things that are causing your skin to
[58:38] have problems amen so in essence the
[58:41] first six months was getting the woman's
[58:42] body to its healthiest natural state it
[58:45] was cleaning up all the stuff that
[58:46] didn't look so good when she went into
[58:48] the king she couldn't have skin problems
[58:50] she meant she couldn't have open wounds
[58:51] she couldn't have acne she couldn't have
[58:53] cracks all over the place
[58:55] right she had to have this natural
[58:57] beautiful tone the first thing they'd do
[58:58] was get out everything bad and then they
[59:00] were going to put in everything good and
[59:01] so for the second six months the first
[59:04] six months was a cleansing ritual it was
[59:06] getting everything out amen it was
[59:08] taking away your flaws but after and and
[59:10] that wasn't fun
[59:11] that's not fun when you're getting all
[59:13] of this stuff pulled out it's a type of
[59:14] sanctification right
[59:17] but after that is six months of pure
[59:19] beautification and it was meant to
[59:20] enhance the natural beauty of the women
[59:22] this wasn't cosmetic surgery but this
[59:24] was meant to enhance who and what they
[59:26] truly were in the first place so with
[59:28] her body in good health and her skin
[59:29] cleared up the focus now was to get her
[59:31] looking as good as she possibly could so
[59:34] they had massages they had hair
[59:35] treatments they had facials they have
[59:37] bubble baths with soft music every day
[59:39] and it was capped off every day by
[59:42] cleansing and perfume so that that
[59:44] perfume was not just something that you
[59:45] sprayed on but it so enveloped you that
[59:48] pretty soon your skin itself became
[59:50] perfume
[59:51] right she didn't have to get up after
[59:53] the end of six months of this
[59:55] of this beauty regimen she didn't have
[59:56] to go
[59:58] every morning because by then she was
[1:00:00] perfume she had been so infused with
[1:00:03] this that everywhere she went people
[1:00:04] could smell the perfume that she'd been
[1:00:06] bathing in for six months she had a
[1:00:08] natural
[1:00:10] odor a natural scent to her that was
[1:00:13] beautiful
[1:00:15] right by the time this was done was she
[1:00:17] had a completely different
[1:00:19] essence around her if we could put it
[1:00:20] she'd been completely transformed into
[1:00:22] the best that she could possibly be amen
[1:00:25] and then when it's all done she's
[1:00:28] brought to the king now listen to this
[1:00:29] it says and thus came every maiden under
[1:00:31] the king whatsoever she desired was
[1:00:33] given to her to go with her out of the
[1:00:35] house of the women into the king's house
[1:00:37] so when it was all said and done and
[1:00:38] she's looking as good as she possibly
[1:00:40] can she smells amazing her hair is
[1:00:42] beautiful her skin glows
[1:00:46] she says she gets to go and whatever is
[1:00:49] in the the women's house
[1:00:51] she can take she can take any jewelry
[1:00:53] she can take any shoes she can take any
[1:00:55] dresses she can take any hair clips any
[1:00:57] accessories the most beautiful purse it
[1:01:00] doesn't matter what she wants anything
[1:01:02] that's there she can take it
[1:01:04] to what try and impress the king so that
[1:01:06] he'll make her queen
[1:01:08] so every woman gets the same thing and
[1:01:10] it's her choice not the kings what she's
[1:01:12] going to wear the king will either like
[1:01:14] it or he won't but she gets to choose
[1:01:16] how she's going to present herself to
[1:01:17] this king
[1:01:19] it says now when the turn of esther the
[1:01:22] daughter of abihal the uncle of mordecai
[1:01:24] who had taken her for his daughter was
[1:01:25] come to go into the king
[1:01:28] she required nothing but what haggai the
[1:01:30] king's chamberlain the keeper of the
[1:01:32] woman appointed and esther obtained
[1:01:34] favor in the sight of all them that
[1:01:36] looked upon her so esther didn't choose
[1:01:38] her style no doubt esther had a style
[1:01:40] but she knew if she was going to please
[1:01:42] the king she needed to dress the way he
[1:01:44] wanted her to dress and look the way he
[1:01:46] liked
[1:01:48] so that she would be accepted as the
[1:01:49] queen and so she didn't go and say well
[1:01:51] this is the way i think i look best she
[1:01:53] went to the king's men to the
[1:01:55] chamberlain and said what does the king
[1:01:57] like and whatever he told her the king
[1:02:00] like was what she dressed as so whatever
[1:02:02] the outfit was whatever the shoes were
[1:02:04] maybe whatever it was the accessories
[1:02:07] maybe he had a really simple taste maybe
[1:02:09] he just liked a simple tunic with no
[1:02:11] real jewelry or anything maybe he liked
[1:02:13] a natural looking woman maybe he liked
[1:02:15] one with tons of jewelry whatever it was
[1:02:17] whatever the king likes she said you
[1:02:18] tell me what he likes and i'll put that
[1:02:20] on it says when she did she obtained
[1:02:23] favor in the sight of everyone that
[1:02:24] looked on her they recognized there was
[1:02:26] something special about the way she
[1:02:27] looked
[1:02:28] brother bam says this way he says esther
[1:02:30] purged her heart before god and walked
[1:02:33] up with a meek and humble spirit why she
[1:02:36] wasn't walking up the way she thought
[1:02:37] she should she walked up the way he
[1:02:39] wanted her to
[1:02:41] and the church that's going to be the
[1:02:43] bride of christ now remember esther
[1:02:45] refused the worldly adornment she took
[1:02:47] the spirit in her heart to go before the
[1:02:49] king what she went before the man that
[1:02:52] knew the king best and let him tell her
[1:02:54] how to do it
[1:02:55] the scripture continues it says so
[1:02:57] esther was taken under king of hajjuris
[1:02:59] into his royal house in the 10th month
[1:03:01] which is the montebeth in the seventh
[1:03:03] year of his reign and the king loved
[1:03:05] esther above all the women and she
[1:03:07] obtained grace and favor in his sight
[1:03:09] more than all the virgins so that he set
[1:03:11] the royal crown upon her head and made
[1:03:14] her queen instead of vashti
[1:03:16] so out of all of them and we don't know
[1:03:17] how many went we don't know how many
[1:03:19] went in it could have been dozens could
[1:03:21] have been hundreds maybe there were
[1:03:22] thousands that went in before her but
[1:03:24] the queen loved her more than all and he
[1:03:26] made her the queen almost immediately
[1:03:29] amen so we see there's something that
[1:03:31] happens when we commit ourselves to
[1:03:32] pleasing god and god alone amen that her
[1:03:35] focus was to do what the king would love
[1:03:37] and that was it she didn't add anything
[1:03:39] she didn't take anything away she went
[1:03:41] in the way that she was told that he
[1:03:42] would love and it's no different than
[1:03:44] ourselves amen when we're more concerned
[1:03:46] about what he wants when we're concerned
[1:03:48] more about what he likes that's when
[1:03:50] we're going to find favor amen we get
[1:03:52] promoted quickly when our greatest
[1:03:54] concern is does what i'm doing please
[1:03:56] god does the life i'm living please god
[1:03:58] does the things i'm saying please god
[1:04:00] does the way i'm spending my time please
[1:04:02] god rather than sitting back and doing
[1:04:04] what we think will make us look best
[1:04:05] amen when we put the kingdom purpose
[1:04:08] first and we choose something that's
[1:04:09] going to make him smile we'll find will
[1:04:11] get promoted in authority in the in the
[1:04:13] kingdom of god a lot more quickly amen
[1:04:15] now we know shortly after this haman
[1:04:17] gets mad at mordecai esther's uncle
[1:04:19] because he refuses to bow to haman and
[1:04:21] so haman goes in and he he tricks the
[1:04:23] king and he says there's these bad
[1:04:24] people in there and they don't respect
[1:04:27] your your law and they don't respect
[1:04:29] me and they don't you know they're
[1:04:31] really we need to get rid of them the
[1:04:32] king says whatever haman i trust you and
[1:04:35] he signs into law a decree that will
[1:04:37] allow haman to kill all of the jews
[1:04:39] and then so now mordecai finds out about
[1:04:41] this
[1:04:42] and the king doesn't know esther's a jew
[1:04:44] she's been she's hidden this from him
[1:04:46] because mordecai told her to so she is
[1:04:48] her life was forfeited as well if haman
[1:04:49] knew about it as well and wanted to kill
[1:04:51] her and then it says here this is this
[1:04:53] is the law that the king signed into
[1:04:56] into law he says and the letters were
[1:04:58] sent by posts into all the king's
[1:05:00] provinces to destroy to kill and to
[1:05:03] cause to perish that's legalese there no
[1:05:05] one would say you can kill anybody but
[1:05:07] they said it three different ways as to
[1:05:08] how you can kill them
[1:05:10] all the jews both young and old little
[1:05:11] children and women
[1:05:13] in one day even upon the 13th day
[1:05:16] of the 12th month which is the month
[1:05:17] eight are and to take the spoil of them
[1:05:19] for the prey so we see the effect we
[1:05:21] know the story we've read the book of
[1:05:23] esther and as soon as this hits what do
[1:05:25] they all do they go into sackcloth and
[1:05:27] ashes they start mourning woe is me woe
[1:05:29] is me we're all gonna die
[1:05:31] and they don't know what they can do
[1:05:32] about it
[1:05:34] but then mordecai sends a copy to esther
[1:05:36] and he asks her he says you need to go
[1:05:38] to the king and get this changed you
[1:05:39] need to get it reversed and you need to
[1:05:41] save your life and you need to save our
[1:05:42] life and esther said unto them when she
[1:05:45] gets the message and she said under
[1:05:46] haytak and gave him commandments on the
[1:05:48] mordecai all the king's servants and the
[1:05:50] people of the king's provinces do know
[1:05:52] that whosoever whether man or woman
[1:05:54] shall come into the king into the inner
[1:05:56] court who is not called there is one law
[1:05:59] of his to put him to death except such
[1:06:01] to whom the king shall hold out the
[1:06:03] golden scepter that he may live
[1:06:05] and i have been not called to come in
[1:06:07] under the king these 30 days so if the
[1:06:10] king didn't ask you to come into his
[1:06:11] court and you showed up the king could
[1:06:14] kill you not only that the king would
[1:06:16] kill you and the only thing that would
[1:06:17] keep you from death is if he reached out
[1:06:19] with his golden scepter towards you that
[1:06:21] was the only thing that would stop him
[1:06:23] from killing you was if he reached out
[1:06:24] his scepter otherwise it was death to
[1:06:26] enter the king's inner court without an
[1:06:29] invitation and esther says look
[1:06:31] it's one thing for me to go in but he
[1:06:33] hasn't called me into his court for 30
[1:06:35] days i haven't seen him in 30 days
[1:06:38] i haven't been in his presence for 30
[1:06:40] days i haven't talked to him i haven't
[1:06:42] texted with him nothing i haven't been
[1:06:44] around the king for 30 days so there's
[1:06:46] some danger here because he hasn't been
[1:06:48] calling me to him there's been a
[1:06:50] separation between us
[1:06:53] it says and they told then they and then
[1:06:55] they told to mordechai esther's words
[1:06:57] and then mordecai commanded to answer
[1:06:59] esther think not within thyself that
[1:07:02] thou shalt escape in the king's house
[1:07:03] more than all the jews in other words
[1:07:05] your jew too if they if they find out
[1:07:07] they can kill you as well
[1:07:08] for if thou all together hold us thy
[1:07:10] peace at this time then shall their
[1:07:12] enlargement and deliverance arise to the
[1:07:14] jews from another place but thou and thy
[1:07:16] father's house shall be destroyed and
[1:07:19] who knoweth whether thou art come to the
[1:07:21] kingdom for such a time as this
[1:07:24] sometimes we're put in tough places
[1:07:26] purely because we are a child of god and
[1:07:29] we have access to one who can change the
[1:07:31] situation and it's not always about us
[1:07:33] often it's about somebody else that has
[1:07:35] nobody to go into the presence of the
[1:07:37] king for them to ask for favor
[1:07:40] now esther she could stay nobody would
[1:07:42] know she was a jew he says look yes you
[1:07:44] may you may get away with it he says but
[1:07:46] we'll all be destroyed if we don't but
[1:07:48] he says maybe this is the very reason
[1:07:50] that you've been made a queen in the
[1:07:51] first place is so that you can save your
[1:07:53] people from an evil man like this and
[1:07:55] it's no different from us brother joe
[1:07:57] and i were talking about the opportunity
[1:07:59] and the mindset we ought to have when
[1:08:01] people meet us when we get into
[1:08:03] situations with people it is not by
[1:08:05] chance amen they have an opportunity to
[1:08:07] meet a living god when they come in and
[1:08:08] they talk to us and they see the way we
[1:08:10] live and there's an opportunity for us
[1:08:12] to intercede for those people to have an
[1:08:14] impact in their lives if we can have the
[1:08:16] right attitude in the right spirit amen
[1:08:18] we're in a special place and he's saying
[1:08:19] look esther you're in a special place
[1:08:21] and guess what this is probably the
[1:08:23] reason for it
[1:08:24] then esther bade then returned mordecai
[1:08:26] this answer she said go and gather
[1:08:28] together all the jews that are present
[1:08:30] in shushan and fast ye for me and
[1:08:33] neither eat nor drink three days night
[1:08:34] or day i also and my maidens will fast
[1:08:37] likewise and so will i go in unto the
[1:08:39] king which is not according to the law
[1:08:41] and if i perish i perish so mordecai
[1:08:44] went his way and did according to all
[1:08:46] that esther had commanded him
[1:08:48] now i want to
[1:08:49] stop here for a second because sometimes
[1:08:51] we can get mixed up in our in in our
[1:08:53] understanding
[1:08:54] of relationship and position and
[1:08:56] authority because many of us in esther's
[1:08:58] place might have said listen this is a
[1:09:01] this is this is coming against my life
[1:09:03] i'm his wife i can just march down there
[1:09:07] walk right through those doors and go
[1:09:09] right up to him and get him to fix it
[1:09:11] i'm the queen he loves me he wants me to
[1:09:14] do this i should just walk in and do
[1:09:16] this many of us would perhaps say that
[1:09:18] wouldn't we it's mine by right he
[1:09:20] married me he put me in this place it's
[1:09:23] a threat against my life i have a right
[1:09:24] to go in and talk to him immediately
[1:09:27] maybe others of us would say what well
[1:09:29] let's go talk to the general and let's
[1:09:31] tell them we need a hundred thousand
[1:09:32] troops in the jewish quarter here and in
[1:09:34] all the cities of the land so that my
[1:09:36] family can be protected
[1:09:38] right he'll obey me because he knows i'm
[1:09:41] the queen and he knows if he doesn't
[1:09:42] he's good he's gonna get into some hot
[1:09:44] water right
[1:09:45] she could have risen up in the authority
[1:09:47] of her position
[1:09:50] and tried to force these things to go
[1:09:52] her way
[1:09:54] she could have went there and tried to
[1:09:55] say hey come on
[1:09:58] i know you're doing something right now
[1:09:59] but you need to listen to me whatever
[1:10:01] you're doing is less important than me
[1:10:02] because i'm your i'm your queen i'm your
[1:10:04] wife right and she'd force him to choose
[1:10:07] and possibly embarrass him in front of
[1:10:09] his uh of the other people and these
[1:10:11] different things but there's a reverence
[1:10:13] there's a respect there's a carefulness
[1:10:15] towards the king that esther exhibits
[1:10:17] here she doesn't just march in and it's
[1:10:20] not just because she's afraid of the law
[1:10:22] though that's certainly there
[1:10:24] but there's a carefulness because she
[1:10:25] knows that he doesn't separate himself
[1:10:27] from her for no good reason she's his
[1:10:30] wife she's the love of his life she's
[1:10:32] the one that he prefers above all the
[1:10:33] other women in the kingdom so if he's
[1:10:35] separated himself for a while it's for a
[1:10:37] purpose
[1:10:39] right
[1:10:40] and so she knows that she shouldn't just
[1:10:41] go in there because he only separates
[1:10:43] himself for a reason amen
[1:10:45] brother branham says how many times that
[1:10:47] god will step away from a situation just
[1:10:50] to see what you will do
[1:10:52] right what do we see here he separated
[1:10:55] himself now he doesn't know what's going
[1:10:56] on but there's a reason for it and
[1:10:58] esther is going to have to prove to
[1:11:00] herself that she values the relationship
[1:11:02] more than she values her own life amen
[1:11:04] she knows her husband the king does
[1:11:06] things a certain way and she's going to
[1:11:08] respect that she's not just going to
[1:11:09] barge herself but i want you to see what
[1:11:11] she does she doesn't just barge in and
[1:11:13] say all right you convinced me i got to
[1:11:15] go in so i'm going to go in but what
[1:11:16] does she do she says everybody fast and
[1:11:19] pray
[1:11:20] right they don't just fast jews don't do
[1:11:22] just fast they fast and pray there's a
[1:11:24] reason to fast and that's to dedicate
[1:11:26] yourself to getting close to god to get
[1:11:28] a focus on what you're needing an answer
[1:11:30] for to get serious to sanctify your life
[1:11:33] to get all of the distractions out and
[1:11:35] then after that time of fasting it's
[1:11:37] supposed to bring the answer that you're
[1:11:38] looking for so she gets her to so esther
[1:11:41] says i'm gonna fast my servants are
[1:11:43] gonna fast all the jews i want all of
[1:11:45] you to fast and pray for three days and
[1:11:47] then after that
[1:11:49] i'm gonna go in and what's esther doing
[1:11:50] in that time she's praying lord how do i
[1:11:53] do this how do i approach it amen how do
[1:11:55] i approach my husband the king so that
[1:11:58] he'll save our lives
[1:11:59] that's her only focus is to go in there
[1:12:01] and her life will be spared so that she
[1:12:03] can make a request to the king to do
[1:12:04] this
[1:12:05] brother abraham says it this way he says
[1:12:07] now all things ought to be considered
[1:12:09] prayerfully first
[1:12:11] you're making a decision pray about it
[1:12:13] amen there's nothing that we should have
[1:12:16] to make a decision on where we don't
[1:12:17] have time to pray first there's always
[1:12:20] time to pray and seek the will of god
[1:12:21] amen if it's god's will he'll make a way
[1:12:24] no matter how long we wait
[1:12:26] seek ye first the kingdom of god and his
[1:12:28] righteousness and all these other things
[1:12:29] will be added i am positive sure this
[1:12:31] morning if men and women could only get
[1:12:34] into the position of where their soul
[1:12:36] their thinking and their attitude will
[1:12:38] be perfect in the sight of god that
[1:12:40] would be one of the most powerful
[1:12:42] churches that ever existed i want power
[1:12:45] what does he say get in line with god's
[1:12:47] word get your attitude your thinking and
[1:12:50] your soul perfect in the sight of god
[1:12:52] amen get yourself aligned don't seek
[1:12:54] power seek alignment and the power and
[1:12:56] authority will follow after that amen
[1:12:58] that's what esther did and we see the
[1:13:00] results that brought him in she didn't
[1:13:01] just step up and ask but she prayed and
[1:13:04] fasted before the approach to the king
[1:13:06] and we know that her approach was
[1:13:07] perfect
[1:13:08] so i want you to see how she does this
[1:13:10] as she goes in
[1:13:12] esther 5 1 says now it came to pass on
[1:13:14] the third day that esther put on her
[1:13:17] royal apparel jin just put on her nice
[1:13:20] clothes but she put on her royal apparel
[1:13:22] she dressed according to her position
[1:13:24] she put on the clothes that the king had
[1:13:26] given her she wasn't scared to go in in
[1:13:28] her position and neither are we to be
[1:13:30] amen we don't have to go into the
[1:13:32] presence of the lord pretending we're
[1:13:34] nobody if he has made us his queen we
[1:13:36] dress like his queen we act like his
[1:13:38] queen amen there's nothing wrong with
[1:13:40] going in knowing your position but in
[1:13:42] knowing your position don't forget the
[1:13:44] respect and reverence that's due him
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:47] she stood in the inner court of the
[1:13:49] king's house over against the king's
[1:13:50] house and the king sat upon his royal
[1:13:53] throne in the royal house over against
[1:13:54] the gate of the house and it was so when
[1:13:56] the king saw esther the queen standing
[1:13:58] in the court that she obtained favor in
[1:14:01] his sight she didn't obtain favor by
[1:14:03] talking she got favor by waiting for his
[1:14:06] acknowledgement amen
[1:14:08] and the king held out to esther the
[1:14:10] golden scepter that was in his hand so
[1:14:13] esther jr and touched the top of the
[1:14:15] scepter
[1:14:18] then said the king unto her what wilt
[1:14:20] thou queen esther
[1:14:22] he's reminding her of her position there
[1:14:24] it's not just esther he says queen
[1:14:26] esther he's acknowledging her position
[1:14:27] he's acknowledging that she's come in
[1:14:29] dressed in it and he's giving her
[1:14:30] respect for her position as well
[1:14:33] what will thou queen esther and what is
[1:14:35] our request it shall be given thee even
[1:14:38] to half of the kingdom now put yourself
[1:14:40] in her position you've fasted for three
[1:14:42] days you've prayed your fellow believers
[1:14:44] have all done the same you're in the
[1:14:46] presence of the king he's extended the
[1:14:48] scepter of grace to save your life he's
[1:14:50] called you forward and he's offered you
[1:14:52] everything up to half of what he has
[1:14:55] and then he trusts his queen
[1:14:57] right his relationship with her is still
[1:14:59] strong he hasn't seen her in 30 days but
[1:15:01] that doesn't mean he doesn't trust her
[1:15:03] hey man he hasn't lost his love what
[1:15:05] would you do
[1:15:06] you prayed about this situation for
[1:15:08] three days you prayed for an answer to
[1:15:11] gain grace in the eyes of the king and
[1:15:13] what would you do
[1:15:15] what would you do in that what would we
[1:15:17] say praise the lord this is what we
[1:15:18] prayed for i don't have to do anything i
[1:15:21] walk in i find grace and favor in a
[1:15:23] sight i can ask what he wants because
[1:15:25] he's telling me i can have whatever i
[1:15:26] want up to half of his kingdom isn't
[1:15:29] that what we do most of us i can say
[1:15:31] that's what i do you go into the
[1:15:32] presence of the king and you'd start
[1:15:34] asking as soon as he gives you the go as
[1:15:36] soon as the green light comes on
[1:15:37] whatever you want up to half the kingdom
[1:15:39] you say i got a i got a need
[1:15:41] i got something i need to talk to you
[1:15:42] about that's what most of us would do
[1:15:45] right what would we say
[1:15:47] lord i want the salvation of my kids i
[1:15:49] want a new job i want a new house i want
[1:15:51] a new car i want this trial to go away i
[1:15:53] want my healing whatever it is we'd
[1:15:55] start asking for that immediately as
[1:15:58] soon as the presence comes down we start
[1:15:59] asking
[1:16:01] watch her learn and listen brothers amen
[1:16:03] how often we miss the greater blessing
[1:16:05] because we're so focused on getting the
[1:16:07] blessing for ourselves
[1:16:10] esther answered if it seemed good unto
[1:16:13] the king
[1:16:14] let the king and haman come this day
[1:16:16] into the banquet that i have prepared
[1:16:18] for him
[1:16:19] lord come to my house
[1:16:22] i made a welcoming feast for you i've
[1:16:23] got the best food i've got everything
[1:16:26] that you love i've got air conditioning
[1:16:28] i've got it laid out so that you just
[1:16:30] have to come in and you can eat and
[1:16:32] relax i haven't seen you in 30 days i
[1:16:35] know that you only do that when you have
[1:16:36] things to do you're busy you're probably
[1:16:39] stressed you need a place of comfort and
[1:16:41] quiet lord i've got a place to bring you
[1:16:43] out from all of what you've been doing i
[1:16:46] have a place of rest for you prepared
[1:16:48] where you can enjoy where you can be the
[1:16:51] focus of people
[1:16:52] remember you can get away where you can
[1:16:54] have some time away and be refreshed
[1:16:56] amen in her great needs she still knew
[1:16:58] that she needed to refresh the
[1:17:00] relationship before she moved into what
[1:17:02] she was going into amen and what is she
[1:17:04] doing here she's reminding him of the
[1:17:06] very reason that he picked her in the
[1:17:07] first place and that's because she's
[1:17:09] more intent with pleasing him than she
[1:17:11] is about getting what she wants and then
[1:17:13] she's more focused on what he thinks and
[1:17:15] what matters to him than what matters to
[1:17:17] her
[1:17:18] amen the very thing of this series on
[1:17:20] thy kingdom what come is what when we
[1:17:22] look at the lord's prayer we are always
[1:17:24] looking to what he wants before we look
[1:17:26] to our own need amen we say lord thy
[1:17:28] kingdom come thy will be done on earth
[1:17:30] as is in heaven and then we say give us
[1:17:33] this day our daily bread amen amen
[1:17:35] healing finances provision direction
[1:17:38] whatever it is that comes after we say
[1:17:40] lord what does your kingdom need first
[1:17:42] amen what can i do for you lord before i
[1:17:44] ask you to do something for me amen
[1:17:48] amen when we first look to his kingdom
[1:17:50] to his purpose to his will to his needs
[1:17:53] before we ask our own that's where we
[1:17:54] start to get into an authority position
[1:17:56] amen call it selfish of god if you want
[1:17:58] but he's god amen god is an object of
[1:18:00] worship god is an object of praise and
[1:18:02] he expects it from us amen and it's not
[1:18:04] something that we do out of out of rote
[1:18:06] or because we have to but we do it out
[1:18:08] of a willing heart because of who he is
[1:18:10] amen because of what he's done
[1:18:12] and then it we see the same thing and
[1:18:14] and this might sound a little crass when
[1:18:15] we compare it to god but they say the
[1:18:17] way to a man's heart is through his
[1:18:18] stomach
[1:18:19] and really what that's saying is when
[1:18:21] you fulfill the need of that man he's
[1:18:23] never more willing to do something for
[1:18:25] you than when his needs been met as well
[1:18:27] amen and it's no different with god is
[1:18:29] that when you've done what he has asked
[1:18:30] you to do then he's never more willing
[1:18:32] to give you something that you've asked
[1:18:33] for as well amen
[1:18:35] brother braham said seek ye first the
[1:18:37] kingdom of god have you ever witnessed
[1:18:39] that to be the truth
[1:18:40] put god first
[1:18:42] pay your tithes first do you want
[1:18:43] financial blessing pay your tithes first
[1:18:45] don't wait for the blessing to pay your
[1:18:47] tithes pay your tithes first every time
[1:18:49] pay everything first pay god pray first
[1:18:52] morning pray all through the day give
[1:18:54] god the first place and everything and
[1:18:57] you'll be a witness what of the good
[1:18:59] things of god
[1:19:00] esther looked to her husband the king's
[1:19:02] need first and she put his needs ahead
[1:19:03] of her own even with her life hanging in
[1:19:05] the balance she still put his needs
[1:19:07] ahead of her own
[1:19:09] then the king said
[1:19:11] cause haman to make haste that he may do
[1:19:13] as esther has said so the king and haman
[1:19:15] came to the banquet that esther prepared
[1:19:17] the king was perfectly willing to drop
[1:19:19] all of his special things that he was
[1:19:20] doing to go relax with esther
[1:19:23] amen
[1:19:24] she met the need he loved what she
[1:19:26] proposed
[1:19:27] right there was something that she said
[1:19:29] there that drew him in that made him
[1:19:31] willing to leave everything behind all
[1:19:32] the rules of court and all the different
[1:19:34] needs that were there all the
[1:19:35] politicking and this and that he left
[1:19:37] all of it to go do what she wanted
[1:19:40] then the king said unto esther at the
[1:19:42] banquet of wine what is thy petition and
[1:19:44] it shall be granted thee and what is thy
[1:19:46] request even to the half of the kingdom
[1:19:48] shall it be performed now if we were
[1:19:50] sitting next to esther we'd say this is
[1:19:52] the time esther this is what we prayed
[1:19:54] about you've done your part now now you
[1:19:56] get your part talk to him he's in a
[1:19:58] great mood he's full of food
[1:20:01] he's relaxed he's smiling he's happy
[1:20:03] he's air conditioned
[1:20:04] now now esther this is a time you've
[1:20:07] done everything you've done everything
[1:20:09] he could ever expect now's the time to
[1:20:11] ask esther
[1:20:14] save yourself esther
[1:20:16] what does esther say then answered
[1:20:18] esther and said
[1:20:20] my petition and my request is
[1:20:22] if
[1:20:23] i have found favor in the sight of the
[1:20:25] king
[1:20:25] and if it pleased the king to grant my
[1:20:28] petition and to perform my request let
[1:20:30] the king and haman come to the banquet
[1:20:32] that i shall prepare for them and i will
[1:20:34] do tomorrow as the king has said she's
[1:20:37] still looking to do something for her
[1:20:39] king before she ever asks him to come
[1:20:40] out and do what he needs she needs him
[1:20:42] to do amen though her life is still in
[1:20:44] the bounce yet she is still staying true
[1:20:46] to her purpose and that is what to do
[1:20:48] something for him before she asks him to
[1:20:50] do something for her
[1:20:52] speaking of the widow woman and the
[1:20:53] prophet elijah brother brown says this
[1:20:55] he says the widow woman said i have just
[1:20:58] enough for me and my little starving boy
[1:21:00] and i'm out here getting these two
[1:21:01] sticks i've just mixed it together and
[1:21:03] dressed it now i've got these two sticks
[1:21:05] to make a fire to make the cake and he
[1:21:07] and i will eat it and die
[1:21:09] she started to turn again and she heard
[1:21:11] a voice saying but bring me one first
[1:21:16] what do we learn here
[1:21:18] seek ye first the kingdom of god
[1:21:20] how will i meet it how will i do what i
[1:21:23] need to do how will i live lord if i
[1:21:25] give everything to you
[1:21:27] he says i can't tell you but you put god
[1:21:30] first
[1:21:30] seek ye first the kingdom of god in his
[1:21:32] righteousness and all these other things
[1:21:34] will be added
[1:21:36] but bring me one first
[1:21:39] look she didn't have to go down and get
[1:21:41] her last penny
[1:21:42] she had to go down and get her last
[1:21:44] piece of bread
[1:21:46] she didn't have to go for this or that
[1:21:48] or maybe change doctors or so forth some
[1:21:50] little insignificant thing but she had
[1:21:52] to go to the only thing that stood
[1:21:54] between her
[1:21:56] and death and her child
[1:21:58] bring me a little cake first in your
[1:22:00] hand i can see her not her head obedient
[1:22:03] that's what god requires you get the
[1:22:05] word and the spirit mixed together
[1:22:07] self-sacrifice and obedience
[1:22:10] he says when god's prophet says a
[1:22:12] certain thing do it
[1:22:14] hold on to it
[1:22:16] he says how do we get there
[1:22:17] seek ye first the kingdom of god and his
[1:22:19] righteousness and all other things will
[1:22:21] be added
[1:22:22] how do i know brother branham how do i
[1:22:24] know
[1:22:25] the only thing i know
[1:22:27] put god first and move on sacrifice mix
[1:22:31] the oil mix the word and the spirit
[1:22:33] together lay yourself upon the cross and
[1:22:35] say here i am lord put god first in
[1:22:39] everything
[1:22:40] what about that to do to our lives amen
[1:22:42] are we always pushing ourselves to the
[1:22:44] front and claiming our position
[1:22:46] i hear it preach so often that you've
[1:22:48] got to speak the word and you're this
[1:22:50] and you're that and the other thing but
[1:22:51] how many of us have the relationship
[1:22:52] that esther's showing us behind the
[1:22:54] speaking of that word amen you can't be
[1:22:57] in a position until god puts you there
[1:22:58] and you can speak the word all day long
[1:23:00] but if he doesn't trust you by
[1:23:02] relationship he's never going to promise
[1:23:04] meet the promise of his word to you you
[1:23:05] can do it till you're blue in the face
[1:23:06] we see a million denominationals out
[1:23:08] there doing it every day and he doesn't
[1:23:10] honor his word because they're not in a
[1:23:12] relationship with him
[1:23:14] esther's proving here
[1:23:15] the widow woman proved that she would
[1:23:17] put god above all else even to the point
[1:23:20] where obedience would mean death within
[1:23:22] the next couple of days
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:25] are we so focused on ourselves that we
[1:23:27] forget that we need to worship and
[1:23:29] praise the god that we ask so much of
[1:23:31] amen
[1:23:33] amen our actions reveal our attitude to
[1:23:35] what's first in our life and too often i
[1:23:37] fear we are number one in our own lives
[1:23:40] and by that i mean we're always asking
[1:23:41] but we're not giving
[1:23:43] right we're always requesting but we're
[1:23:44] never offering
[1:23:47] amen esther proves here the attitude to
[1:23:50] get to a place of authority and that is
[1:23:51] first by sacrifice
[1:23:53] and second
[1:23:55] by proving in a trusting relationship
[1:23:57] amen don't get me wrong this is not just
[1:23:59] for the women tonight this is for men
[1:24:00] and women like i said i'm preaching to
[1:24:01] the bride of christ collectively here we
[1:24:03] ought to look to the needs of our spouse
[1:24:05] a wife is not only obligated to look to
[1:24:07] the needs of her husband the husband is
[1:24:08] absolutely required above and beyond
[1:24:10] that to look to the needs of his wife he
[1:24:12] is the great provider amen
[1:24:14] we're all supposed to be looking at that
[1:24:15] but if we're focused on christ the truth
[1:24:17] and the principle still stands though
[1:24:19] he's supposed to look out for us there
[1:24:20] is a response that we are supposed to
[1:24:22] have and it is always to put him in a
[1:24:24] position that is first in our lives and
[1:24:26] that means he's ahead of us even amen
[1:24:29] if you want authority you're going to
[1:24:30] have to come by the way of focusing on
[1:24:32] the purpose of your husband christ
[1:24:34] rather than your own every time it's got
[1:24:36] to be that amen you don't get authority
[1:24:38] so that you can do your own thing
[1:24:40] so often that's what we want is we want
[1:24:41] a third authority that gives us
[1:24:43] permission to do what we wanted to do
[1:24:45] all along and god will never give you
[1:24:47] authority if that's what you're looking
[1:24:48] for but he gives you authority so that
[1:24:50] you can do what he wants you to do and
[1:24:52] then he's giving you the authority to
[1:24:53] use the power of the kingdom of god to
[1:24:55] achieve his purpose not to achieve your
[1:24:57] own
[1:24:58] amen there's no time that i'm so willing
[1:25:00] to spend money is when my wife comes to
[1:25:02] me with a a plan or a purpose that
[1:25:05] aligns perfectly with mine
[1:25:07] why because the purpose is supported by
[1:25:09] the cost the cost is supported by the
[1:25:11] purpose
[1:25:12] what she's asking me to spend money on
[1:25:14] what she's asking me to put time into is
[1:25:16] align perfectly with the vision that i
[1:25:18] have for the family and when she does
[1:25:19] that i have no problem spending money
[1:25:21] and god's the exact same way he's
[1:25:22] written blank checks but he honors the
[1:25:24] ones that are aligned with the kingdom
[1:25:25] amen
[1:25:28] esther 7 we see what happens it says so
[1:25:30] the king and haman came to the bank with
[1:25:32] esther the queen and the queen king said
[1:25:34] again under esther on the second day of
[1:25:36] the banker of wine what is thy petition
[1:25:38] queen esther and it shall be granted
[1:25:40] thee and what is thy request and it
[1:25:42] shall be performed even to the half of
[1:25:44] the kingdom
[1:25:45] then ants then esther the queen answered
[1:25:47] and said if i have found favor in thy
[1:25:50] sight o king and if it please the king
[1:25:53] let my life be given me at my petition
[1:25:56] and my people at my request now i love
[1:25:58] this part because esther doesn't say
[1:25:59] lord i put so much time and effort into
[1:26:02] this i've made this beautiful spread for
[1:26:04] you i've slaved for two days to make it
[1:26:06] perfect i brought in things from all
[1:26:08] over the kingdom from all over the world
[1:26:10] to give you just the food
[1:26:12] and the feast that you wanted lord i've
[1:26:14] done all these things i'm a great
[1:26:16] christian i'm a wonderful person i've
[1:26:18] kept all the rules and i've believed
[1:26:19] everything you've said and i've gone to
[1:26:21] church every service
[1:26:22] esther does not say what i've done is
[1:26:25] worthy of my request she says if what
[1:26:28] i've done
[1:26:29] is of worth to you
[1:26:31] then
[1:26:32] give me my life
[1:26:34] she says lord you be the judge of what
[1:26:37] i've done for you
[1:26:39] she doesn't sit there and say i'm the
[1:26:40] best i'm amazing lord i'm the greatest
[1:26:42] christian in your kingdom she says if
[1:26:45] there's anything i've done that has
[1:26:46] pleased you
[1:26:47] let me have my life
[1:26:51] she says let your response be a
[1:26:53] reflection of your appreciation
[1:26:55] don't let me tell you what you like god
[1:26:57] let you express what you like based on
[1:26:59] how you answer me
[1:27:01] she says for we are sold i am my people
[1:27:03] to be destroyed to be slain and to
[1:27:05] perish but if we have been sold for bond
[1:27:08] men and bond woman i had held my tongue
[1:27:10] although the enemy could not countervail
[1:27:11] the king's damage and the king of
[1:27:13] hashwares answered and said unto esther
[1:27:15] the queen who is he and where is he that
[1:27:18] does presume in his heart to do so show
[1:27:20] me the man that did this
[1:27:22] let me adam is what he's saying this is
[1:27:24] not a happy husband this is not a happy
[1:27:25] king and let me tell you when a king
[1:27:27] gets unhappy you don't want to be in the
[1:27:29] same room with him amen but i want you
[1:27:31] to catch here that god opens up a hedge
[1:27:34] of protection around us to train us and
[1:27:36] to teach us and to cause us to grow
[1:27:38] because the only reason that haman has
[1:27:40] access to esther is by one thing and
[1:27:42] that's the law of the king
[1:27:44] did you notice that the king is the one
[1:27:46] that gave him the law that could destroy
[1:27:48] did you know christ did the same thing
[1:27:51] he said the day you eat thereof is the
[1:27:52] day you'll die what did he do he gave
[1:27:54] power to satan to bring death on there
[1:27:57] right in the first it's the law of the
[1:27:59] king that gave satan power in the first
[1:28:01] place
[1:28:02] but when he extends the scepter of grace
[1:28:04] what is it it overrides the law doesn't
[1:28:06] it and allows her to now come back with
[1:28:08] something that doesn't undo it but it
[1:28:11] gives him a what a weapon a defense
[1:28:13] against it so that it has no effect on
[1:28:15] them anymore amen
[1:28:17] you could preach that for a service i'll
[1:28:18] tell you
[1:28:19] amen
[1:28:20] the king gave power to
[1:28:22] to haman that could potentially destroy
[1:28:24] esther
[1:28:26] but it was all for a purpose
[1:28:29] amen don't look where you are now by
[1:28:30] eyes of flesh lies of carnality by your
[1:28:33] emotions and concerns and worries look
[1:28:35] to what god has said amen i like what
[1:28:37] brother gerald read there in the last
[1:28:39] service where he says what that god is
[1:28:41] not taken by surprise god is not fooled
[1:28:44] right the devon's lesson get one over on
[1:28:46] god when we go into hard times but
[1:28:47] rather god allows it for a purpose and
[1:28:50] it is to draw us into a closer
[1:28:51] relationship with him amen
[1:28:54] and esther said
[1:28:56] the adversarian enemy is this wicked
[1:28:58] haman then haman was afraid before the
[1:29:01] king and the queen i would imagine he
[1:29:03] was very very very afraid amen and the
[1:29:06] king arising from the banquet of wine in
[1:29:09] his wrath went into the palace garden
[1:29:11] and haman stood up to make requests for
[1:29:13] his life to esther the queen for he saw
[1:29:15] that there was evil determined against
[1:29:17] him by the king very perceptive man then
[1:29:19] the king returned out of the palace
[1:29:20] garden into the place of the banquet of
[1:29:22] wine and haman was fallen upon the bed
[1:29:25] where esther was
[1:29:26] then said the king will he force the
[1:29:28] queen also before me in the house and as
[1:29:31] the words went out of the king's mouth
[1:29:32] they covered haman's face the servants
[1:29:34] grabbed him and covered his head and
[1:29:36] prepared him for death
[1:29:39] he says will he force him he he
[1:29:40] literally climbed on her to plead for
[1:29:43] his life and the king took it as a sign
[1:29:45] that he was trying to force her
[1:29:48] it says in harbonah one of the
[1:29:49] chamberlains said before the king behold
[1:29:51] also the gallow 50 cubits high which
[1:29:53] haman had made for mordecai who spoke
[1:29:56] good for the king standeth in the house
[1:29:58] of haman then the king said hang him
[1:30:00] thereon. so they hanged haman on the
[1:30:02] gallows that he had prepared for
[1:30:04] mordecai then was the king's wrath
[1:30:06] pacified now you'd think that'd be the
[1:30:08] end of it haman's dead who's going to
[1:30:09] enforce this law
[1:30:11] but the thing is this went out to all of
[1:30:13] the kingdom and everybody was told the
[1:30:16] jews are there's open season on the jews
[1:30:18] on this one day you got one day to take
[1:30:20] them out but whoever you kill you can
[1:30:22] take their property
[1:30:24] so everybody knows on that one day
[1:30:27] they get to have a heyday with the jews
[1:30:28] and they can take all of the things that
[1:30:30] they've ever gathered together they can
[1:30:31] take their houses they can take their
[1:30:33] their wealth they can take their porsche
[1:30:34] they can take their rolex watch whatever
[1:30:36] it is they've got they can go in and
[1:30:37] take it so even with haman dead the
[1:30:39] danger is still there amen
[1:30:41] and that's what brings us to the
[1:30:43] scripture that we opened up with amen
[1:30:45] but as we read it i want you to put it
[1:30:47] into the place that brought esther to
[1:30:49] the place where the king's going to give
[1:30:50] the ring of power to her because look at
[1:30:53] her mindset look at her approach look at
[1:30:55] her attitude in this it is not one of
[1:30:57] presumption it has never won a
[1:30:58] presumption it is always one of
[1:31:00] relationship and respect and reverence
[1:31:02] for her husband
[1:31:04] so we're going to read esther 8 again
[1:31:05] and it says on that day did the king of
[1:31:07] hegewears give the king of haman the
[1:31:09] jew's enemy unto esther the queen and
[1:31:11] mordecai came before the king for esther
[1:31:14] had told what he was unto her and the
[1:31:16] king took off his ring which he had
[1:31:17] taken from haman and gave it unto
[1:31:19] mordechai remember the king had given we
[1:31:21] didn't read it but the king had given
[1:31:22] his ring to mordecai or to haman to
[1:31:25] write the other law and haman had had it
[1:31:27] until that point the king takes it back
[1:31:29] and now he gives it to mordecai and
[1:31:31] esther set mordecai over the house of
[1:31:33] haman and esther spake yet again before
[1:31:36] the king and fell down at his feet and
[1:31:38] besought him with tears to put away the
[1:31:40] mischief of haman the agagite and his
[1:31:42] device that he had devised against the
[1:31:43] jews
[1:31:44] then the king held out the golden
[1:31:46] scepter toward his toward esther so
[1:31:49] esther arose and stood before the king
[1:31:51] now watch and learn again watch her
[1:31:53] attitude
[1:31:54] and said if it pleased the king
[1:31:57] and if i have found favor in his sight
[1:31:59] and the things seem right before the
[1:32:00] king and i be pleasing in his eyes let
[1:32:04] it be written to reverse the letters
[1:32:06] devised by haman the son of hamadatha
[1:32:08] the agagite which he wrote to destroy
[1:32:10] the jews which are in all the king's
[1:32:11] provinces for how can i endure to see
[1:32:14] the evil that shall come unto my people
[1:32:16] or how can i endure to see the
[1:32:18] destruction of my kindred amen we're so
[1:32:21] often certain of the path that we need
[1:32:23] to walk down to get things done we've
[1:32:26] got the answer and we bring it to god
[1:32:27] and we say lord this is what i'm praying
[1:32:29] for lord this is the way this needs to
[1:32:31] happen
[1:32:32] esther doesn't show us that she says
[1:32:34] look i've got an idea lord
[1:32:37] but if it pleases you and if i found
[1:32:41] favor
[1:32:42] and it's right
[1:32:44] and i'm pleasing
[1:32:46] then please do this
[1:32:48] she puts it right back on him and says
[1:32:49] lord i've got an idea i don't know if
[1:32:52] it's right or wrong you're the king
[1:32:53] you're the one that knows best i'm
[1:32:55] giving you the suggestion now you do
[1:32:57] whatever you want to do in this
[1:32:58] situation amen
[1:33:00] sometimes our prayers are too focused
[1:33:02] and that we're telling god what to do
[1:33:04] rather than saying lord here's the need
[1:33:06] and you do it the way you feel best amen
[1:33:08] sometimes we miss that perfect will
[1:33:09] because we're so insistent that we found
[1:33:11] the answer instead of letting the great
[1:33:13] god that knows all things and sees all
[1:33:15] things bring the answer our way
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:19] what are we doing we're saying god i'm
[1:33:20] offering a solution but i'm letting you
[1:33:22] make the call that's just what she's
[1:33:24] teaching us to do
[1:33:25] amen what an attitude she's in the
[1:33:27] driver's seat he's given her everything
[1:33:28] she wants
[1:33:29] he says you can do it and she still
[1:33:31] comes back and says lord i'm gonna let
[1:33:33] you tell me
[1:33:34] if this makes sense if this is something
[1:33:36] that you're going to put your stamp of
[1:33:37] approval on and then she deferred right
[1:33:39] back to him every time
[1:33:41] it says then the king of hajj where said
[1:33:43] unto esther the queen and to mordecai
[1:33:44] the jew behold i have given esther the
[1:33:46] house of haman and him have they hanged
[1:33:48] upon the gallows because he laid his
[1:33:50] hand upon the jews
[1:33:52] this is the authority she gets now right
[1:33:54] ye also for the jews as it liketh you in
[1:33:58] other words you do whatever you want
[1:34:01] write whatever you want decree whatever
[1:34:03] you want put it down and i'll enforce
[1:34:06] anything that you write
[1:34:10] she's given him a solution he says
[1:34:12] you're good to go
[1:34:13] write whatever you want i'll enforce it
[1:34:17] she's got full of thing she's got full
[1:34:20] kingdom authority everything in the
[1:34:22] kingdom is behind her at this point
[1:34:23] whatever she writes the king's gonna
[1:34:25] support it
[1:34:28] he says what
[1:34:30] right ye also for the jews as it liketh
[1:34:32] you in the king's name
[1:34:35] and seal it with the king's ring
[1:34:38] for the writing which is written in the
[1:34:40] king's name and sealed with the king's
[1:34:42] ring may no man reverse who's writing it
[1:34:46] esther
[1:34:47] who's signing it the king
[1:34:49] it's not esther that's going to make it
[1:34:51] happen it's the king that signs it
[1:34:52] that's going to make it happen amen now
[1:34:55] she has it now she has the ring of
[1:34:56] authority she has a seal of the king she
[1:34:58] has his name behind anything she writes
[1:35:00] down and we know what she writes is that
[1:35:01] we are allowed to defend ourselves
[1:35:03] against anything that comes towards us
[1:35:06] right god couldn't undo the law
[1:35:09] but he fulfilled the law and then he
[1:35:11] gave us what by grace he gave us
[1:35:12] something to defend against every enemy
[1:35:14] that the
[1:35:15] every weapon that the enemy could bring
[1:35:16] against us amen he couldn't stop the
[1:35:18] enemy because the enemy still had the
[1:35:20] law
[1:35:21] right under sin he's allowed to attack
[1:35:23] right but he gives us grace and he gives
[1:35:24] us the holy ghost and he gives us the
[1:35:26] word to fight against him so that
[1:35:28] anything that comes against us we have a
[1:35:30] right to stand up against it amen that
[1:35:32] we can push back and keep him off of
[1:35:34] ours you'll notice and just for the sake
[1:35:36] of time i didn't put it in here when
[1:35:38] they wrote it that the jews they fought
[1:35:41] and they killed everyone that came
[1:35:42] against them but they didn't take a
[1:35:43] single thing from them
[1:35:46] it's a type for us
[1:35:47] we're not there to take anything from
[1:35:49] this world they come against us what
[1:35:51] we're doing is defending our property
[1:35:52] and then we're not going to take theirs
[1:35:54] they have nothing that we want amen but
[1:35:56] when they come for something that we
[1:35:58] have we say you can't have it and we
[1:35:59] take care of business with anybody that
[1:36:01] comes our way amen they took no spoil
[1:36:03] from them but they killed everyone that
[1:36:05] came against them amen
[1:36:06] and they hung his sons
[1:36:08] haman had nobody left after this
[1:36:10] heyman's family was completely destroyed
[1:36:12] by the time the jews got through with
[1:36:13] them brother brown says this he says
[1:36:15] when all hell turns loose
[1:36:25] what's turned loose on you
[1:36:28] what are you fighting
[1:36:30] what's the situation
[1:36:33] feels like all hell sometimes doesn't it
[1:36:36] you get to focusing on the wrong things
[1:36:39] seems like everything's weighing you
[1:36:40] down
[1:36:42] all hell's against you the prophet said
[1:36:43] when all hell turns loose all heaven
[1:36:46] turns loose also
[1:36:49] he'll give you everything you need to
[1:36:51] win the victory
[1:36:53] i'm reminded of daniel when he prayed
[1:36:55] and he was looking for an answer
[1:36:57] and he got delayed by three weeks the
[1:36:59] answer took three weeks and the angel
[1:37:01] when it finally came says
[1:37:02] you got heard on the first day
[1:37:04] the answer was given
[1:37:06] but i ran into trouble
[1:37:08] i there why because it's a spiritual
[1:37:10] battle
[1:37:11] right we we think that god is
[1:37:13] all-powerful and so he just zips things
[1:37:15] around here but there is a kingdom
[1:37:16] outside of this that we don't see
[1:37:18] there's a spiritual warfare that's going
[1:37:20] on and that that messenger angel that
[1:37:23] came to daniel was delayed and he needed
[1:37:25] help to get the message through
[1:37:27] but the message was coming no matter
[1:37:29] what and the victory was coming no
[1:37:31] matter what but there was a delay
[1:37:33] between the answering and the receiving
[1:37:35] of the answer amen
[1:37:36] but what heaven was turned loose until
[1:37:39] the answer came amen when help was
[1:37:41] needed help was provided and daniel got
[1:37:43] his answer
[1:37:44] but daniel didn't run away did he
[1:37:46] daniel didn't falter back and say the
[1:37:48] answer's not here yet i guess i'm wrong
[1:37:50] i guess i i guess i should start being
[1:37:52] worried i guess i should fall back on
[1:37:54] the arm of flesh no daniel stayed in
[1:37:56] prayer until the answer came amen he
[1:37:58] trusted his god would come all the way
[1:38:00] through when the enemy comes in like a
[1:38:03] flood the spirit of god raises up a
[1:38:05] standard against it and these two forces
[1:38:07] is always showed at the junction it is
[1:38:10] not a natural battle we fight it is not
[1:38:13] a battle for finances it is not a battle
[1:38:15] for health it is not a
[1:38:17] one for for strong emotions for great
[1:38:20] relationships
[1:38:21] it's a spiritual battle that we fight
[1:38:23] and you've got to recognize that all of
[1:38:25] heaven is behind you to make the victory
[1:38:28] come to the bride of christ amen
[1:38:30] but you've got to have a relationship
[1:38:32] before he's going to give you the
[1:38:33] authority to use it all
[1:38:36] but ram says
[1:38:37] i said
[1:38:38] if god speaks
[1:38:41] or sends you
[1:38:45] he backs up what you say
[1:38:48] see notice if you're an ambassador from
[1:38:52] heaven
[1:38:53] all of heaven is behind you and heaven
[1:38:55] is consisted of the word take it back to
[1:38:58] the word every time if you've got a word
[1:38:59] promise if you've got a word unction if
[1:39:01] you've got a word that's pushing you
[1:39:04] then you can know that heaven is behind
[1:39:05] every one of us amen
[1:39:07] look at esther she didn't walk up and
[1:39:09] wrench authority out she didn't seduce
[1:39:12] it out she didn't manipulate it out but
[1:39:15] she showed reverence and respect for the
[1:39:17] things of her husband for the kingdom of
[1:39:19] her husband and in that she gained a
[1:39:21] position where he trusted her to do the
[1:39:23] right thing with his authority amen she
[1:39:25] humbled herself to the kingdom need
[1:39:28] and he gave her everything that her
[1:39:30] heart desired in response to that amen
[1:39:32] let's bring it down to our doorstep and
[1:39:34] we'll be closing and then this will be
[1:39:36] where we'll start the next service lord
[1:39:37] willing matthew 18 says verily i say
[1:39:40] unto you
[1:39:41] whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
[1:39:43] be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye
[1:39:45] shall loose on earth shall be loosed in
[1:39:47] heaven
[1:39:48] is that our scripture
[1:39:50] that's our scripture amen
[1:39:53] again i say unto you that if two of you
[1:39:55] shall agree on earth as touching
[1:39:57] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[1:39:59] done for them of my father which is in
[1:40:00] heaven you notice that the king had two
[1:40:02] there he had mordecai and esther
[1:40:05] he didn't have one he had two
[1:40:07] he trusted mordecai and he trusted
[1:40:08] esther put them together and he knew
[1:40:10] that they were going to come up with
[1:40:10] something good
[1:40:12] he said that if two of you shall agree
[1:40:14] on earth as touching anything that they
[1:40:15] shall ask it shall be done for them of
[1:40:18] my father which is in heaven for where
[1:40:20] two or three are gathered in my name
[1:40:23] amen you got to have the name you've got
[1:40:25] to have the seal of that name the holy
[1:40:26] spirit there am i
[1:40:29] in the midst of them
[1:40:31] one last quote as we close
[1:40:34] it says but in obedience this little
[1:40:36] faith woman that lives by faith the
[1:40:38] bride
[1:40:40] the person here there here off somewhere
[1:40:42] else some other church some other
[1:40:44] denomination whatever it is she believes
[1:40:46] the word of god
[1:40:48] obedient
[1:40:50] waiting in love for the promise of the
[1:40:53] age to be confirmed
[1:40:55] she's watching for it she's part of that
[1:40:57] word and she is watching for her life
[1:41:00] to manifest
[1:41:02] that word
[1:41:03] amen musicians if you would come amen
[1:41:05] i'm looking for this
[1:41:07] i'm looking for this with expectation
[1:41:09] i'm looking for for matthew 18 with
[1:41:12] expectation that when we ask in his name
[1:41:14] where two or three of us agreeing at
[1:41:16] that he answers amen that he gives us
[1:41:18] what we're seeking amen but i want to
[1:41:20] check up and say am i approaching it the
[1:41:22] way that esther did because if she got a
[1:41:24] response we'll get a response amen that
[1:41:27] we can't presume to venture without
[1:41:29] authority but the authority has to be
[1:41:30] given to us so that there's no
[1:41:32] presumption in our actions amen and the
[1:41:34] question i'm asking is am i seeking his
[1:41:36] kingdom or am i seeking my kingdom
[1:41:38] amen am i seeking the benefits
[1:41:41] why am i seeking the benefactor
[1:41:43] you know that song help me want the
[1:41:45] healer more than the healing help me
[1:41:47] want the savior more than the saving
[1:41:49] these different things i want to ask you
[1:41:50] is there a relationship there that's
[1:41:52] keeping you tied regardless of whether
[1:41:54] he says yes or no to your request
[1:41:56] because whether or not i say yes or no
[1:41:58] to my wife she's still going to love me
[1:41:59] isn't she
[1:42:00] and whether or not
[1:42:02] that that relationship will be built to
[1:42:03] the point where what it doesn't matter
[1:42:06] what my answer is she's still going to
[1:42:07] want to be around me
[1:42:08] and i'm going to want to be around her
[1:42:10] and then because we're loving him based
[1:42:12] on who he is not what he provides us
[1:42:13] every time amen we've got to come to the
[1:42:16] place where we have a relationship i
[1:42:17] like what brother branham said you know
