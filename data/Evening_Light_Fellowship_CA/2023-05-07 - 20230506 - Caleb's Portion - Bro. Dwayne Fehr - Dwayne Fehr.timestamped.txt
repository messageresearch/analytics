[1:06:17] you and uh Shake I want to say shake
[1:06:19] your hands on this side of Glory
[1:06:22] I I'm I'm a lover of music and
[1:06:27] um you know we can't be something that
[1:06:29] we're not
[1:06:30] and you know I got I got a brother that
[1:06:32] come to fellowship with us back home and
[1:06:35] he says to me brother Dwayne he said um
[1:06:38] he said were you ever out in the world
[1:06:40] I said no sir
[1:06:42] not that way you know God's grace to me
[1:06:45] kept me and I was I was sharing with
[1:06:46] brother Gerald today I said you know
[1:06:48] many have wonderful great testimonies I
[1:06:50] said but listen young people
[1:06:52] it's a tremendous testimony to be able
[1:06:55] to tell the world God kept me in lady
[1:06:58] osia God kept me
[1:07:00] and anyhow the you know the brother he
[1:07:04] kind of would look at me funny and he
[1:07:06] said what kind of music did you listen
[1:07:07] to when you were growing up
[1:07:11] and I have to be honest you know brother
[1:07:13] Brown makes a statement unless you get
[1:07:14] the Holy Ghost rock and roll music will
[1:07:16] get you
[1:07:17] it's got such a power music has such a
[1:07:20] power to it of course Satan was you know
[1:07:22] he was the Archangel he was the exalted
[1:07:24] cherubim and brother Brown would say
[1:07:26] this that he actually he was the leader
[1:07:28] of worship so he understands the power
[1:07:30] of music and that's why Everywhere You
[1:07:31] Go I mean he bombards you with it
[1:07:34] because it has an anointing it has a it
[1:07:35] has a power it has a way of getting into
[1:07:37] your innermost being and of course you
[1:07:39] know we grew up on the believer's music
[1:07:41] and and uh when we're at breakfast this
[1:07:44] morning brother Dale put me on the spot
[1:07:46] and he said brother Dwayne would you and
[1:07:48] sister Connie at least sing once while
[1:07:49] you're here and and I I'm honestly not
[1:07:52] much of a singer but she's a good piano
[1:07:55] player and so how but but I'm so simple

[1:12:51] and you ministers know what I'm talking
[1:12:53] about but
[1:12:54] there's something about asking the Lord
[1:12:57] to speak and we realize real quickly
[1:12:59] that it it's not us
[1:13:01] it's not us you know how many times
[1:13:04] yeah I have an interpreter back home not
[1:13:07] that he interprets at home but he is in

[1:13:25] know I can be with you and I'm like and
[1:13:27] he's a tremendous good interpreter he's
[1:13:29] just really A Gifted Man and and uh so I
[1:13:32] would email them off my notes you know
[1:13:33] all this digital stuff and and he'd go
[1:13:36] through them and
[1:13:37] you know we get to preaching at the end
[1:13:39] of the service he just look at me and go
[1:13:40] why

[1:13:44] said
[1:13:45] well yeah we read the scripture but then
[1:13:47] you didn't preach anything in your notes
[1:13:49] I'm like
[1:13:50] I'm sorry
[1:13:51] that's just how it works
[1:13:53] you know but isn't that isn't that how
[1:13:56] we want we want the Lord to we we just I
[1:13:59] you know I I just feel this way it's

[1:14:47] I uh
[1:14:48] I said usually I I get all nervous and
[1:14:51] uptight and you know my stomach is in
[1:14:53] knots and I I don't know the atmosphere
[1:14:56] brother Bob the atmosphere was just set
[1:14:57] so good last night it yeah you get the
[1:15:00] cower behind here but just for a little
[1:15:02] bit and then I was free and uh you know
[1:15:04] I I'm not a
[1:15:07] I have nothing against these preachers
[1:15:08] that have you know glass pulpits it's
[1:15:10] all fine for them but but I I really
[1:15:13] truly is in my nature I'd rather just
[1:15:15] hide behind it you know like Gideon did
[1:15:16] I'd like to hide behind it but when he
[1:15:18] comes by I feel so free I feel so
[1:15:21] liberated and then I feel like I'm too
[1:15:23] far from the congregation then I need to
[1:15:24] be I need to be right where they are at
[1:15:26] and and so you forgive me for my my
[1:15:29] silly little ways or whatever but
[1:15:32] you know if God could use a
[1:15:35] a dumb animal to speak I I trust if I
[1:15:38] can just let go he could use me too so

[1:17:41] you know I think there's something about
[1:17:42] not just reading the word of God but you
[1:17:44] know sometimes we sometimes we just um
[1:17:47] you know we just pick up our Bibles we
[1:17:50] in our we've got eyes to read and we you
[1:17:52] know we just consume it but we don't
[1:17:53] read it out loud but listen there's
[1:17:55] power in the spoken word
[1:17:58] as long as God had his thoughts and they
[1:18:00] were in his mind nothing happened
[1:18:02] but the Bible says when he spoke
[1:18:05] and said let there be light
[1:18:08] something happened
[1:18:09] and so when we brother would say this
[1:18:11] when you put the word of God on your
[1:18:13] lips it's not you speaking but it
[1:18:15] becomes him so Philippians chapter 4
[1:18:18] verse 13.
[1:18:20] let's read it together
[1:18:22] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:18:26] strengtheneth me can we do it again
[1:18:29] I can do all things through Christ which
[1:18:33] strengtheneth me
[1:18:35] and I I just want you to take that as
[1:18:37] your portion tonight
[1:18:39] I can do all things all things are
[1:18:41] possible all things belong to me because
[1:18:44] I have a father that left me in
[1:18:45] inheritance and in that inheritance
[1:18:48] every part of it is mine
[1:18:52] every part is mine God bless you can
[1:18:53] have your seats you'd open up your
[1:18:55] Bibles again to the Book of Joshua
[1:18:57] tonight
[1:18:58] I want to take a little thought and I
[1:19:00] want to I want to call it Caleb's
[1:19:03] portion
[1:19:04] Caleb's portion and uh you know we look
[1:19:08] at the scriptures and and this is our
[1:19:10] life I mean I I mean we yes many of you
[1:19:13] know many people we have to work and we
[1:19:14] have to make a living and we got
[1:19:16] families and we got friends but this is
[1:19:19] life this is life and uh and so if we
[1:19:23] just turn over the Book of Joshua with
[1:19:24] me and I'd like to just lay a little
[1:19:26] background as I get started tonight
[1:19:31] starting in verse one it says and these
[1:19:33] are the countries which the children of
[1:19:35] Israel inherited in the land of Canaan
[1:19:38] which Eliezer the priest and Joshua the
[1:19:41] son of none
[1:19:42] and the heads of the fathers of the
[1:19:43] tribes of the children of Israel
[1:19:45] distributed for inheritance to them
[1:19:49] by law was their inheritance as the Lord
[1:19:52] commanded by the hand of Moses
[1:19:54] for the nine tribes and for the half
[1:19:56] tribe
[1:19:57] for Moses had given the inheritance of
[1:20:00] two tribes and a half tribe on the other
[1:20:02] side of Jordan but unto the Levites he
[1:20:03] gave none inheritance among them for the
[1:20:06] children of Joseph were two tribes
[1:20:07] Manasseh and Ephraim therefore they gave
[1:20:10] no part unto the Levites in the Land
[1:20:12] save cities to dwell in with their
[1:20:15] suburbs for the cat for their Catalan
[1:20:17] for their substance as the Lord
[1:20:19] commanded Moses so the children of
[1:20:22] Israel did and they divided the land
[1:20:24] verse 6.
[1:20:26] and the children of Judah came unto
[1:20:28] Joshua in gilgal
[1:20:31] and Caleb
[1:20:32] the son of Jefe
[1:20:34] the canizite said unto him thou knowest
[1:20:37] the thing that the Lord said unto Moses
[1:20:39] the man of God concerning me and thee in
[1:20:43] Kadesh bernia
[1:20:44] 40 years old was I when Moses the
[1:20:47] servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh
[1:20:48] burnia to spy out the land
[1:20:50] and I brought him word again as it was
[1:20:53] in my heart and I just I so appreciate
[1:20:57] that I you know listen to the way this
[1:20:59] man of God is speaking I want us to
[1:21:01] remember something Joshua we're and We
[1:21:03] Know by Prophet that Joshua was actually
[1:21:05] a type of the Holy Spirit
[1:21:07] listen Joshua was the type of the Holy
[1:21:09] Spirit Ministry but Caleb was actually a
[1:21:11] type of the Bride
[1:21:13] so now watch how watch how this is being
[1:21:15] watch how Caleb is beginning to speak
[1:21:18] here he's reminding he's going to Joshua
[1:21:21] who is uh you know who is in command and
[1:21:23] tell me you know again we say this
[1:21:25] little congregation right who is
[1:21:27] actually in charge of this congregation
[1:21:28] well brother Jonathan is you know he's
[1:21:30] the pastor here but who's really the
[1:21:32] pastor
[1:21:33] who's really the pastor yes God needs
[1:21:36] flesh and blood but listen this is not
[1:21:38] the work of man that we're that we're
[1:21:40] enjoying right now it's not it's not
[1:21:42] though it's not the work of a church
[1:21:43] organization it's not the work of uh you
[1:21:46] know a certain group or a certain
[1:21:48] denomination but this is unadulteratedly
[1:21:51] the work of almighty God for for I
[1:21:54] believe it was Zechariah said not by
[1:21:56] might and not by power but by my spirit
[1:22:00] saith the Lord and so so we look at this
[1:22:03] and here's you know you know if we would
[1:22:04] just jump back into into Caleb's day
[1:22:07] here we we look at Caleb and and he's
[1:22:09] been given something as he was in his
[1:22:12] journey
[1:22:13] as he was in his journey and we all know
[1:22:16] the story how how the 12 surprise went
[1:22:18] over into the other land they began to
[1:22:20] spy out the promised land and when they
[1:22:21] when they came back into uh you know
[1:22:24] before Moses they began to give a a
[1:22:27] report about what they had seen and how
[1:22:29] this land was oh it was such a wonderful
[1:22:32] land it was going to be an absolutely a
[1:22:34] beautiful place to live and everything
[1:22:36] that you had need of everything your
[1:22:39] heart desired it was it was already
[1:22:41] there it was already there listen
[1:22:44] Brothers let me just drop this into a
[1:22:46] natural into a natural level right now
[1:22:48] but but here you're sitting here and
[1:22:50] this building has already been here you
[1:22:53] you never had the labor to build the
[1:22:55] building you never labored to buy the
[1:22:57] property you never you never labored to
[1:23:00] to make this what it is it was already
[1:23:02] here you have walked in and just
[1:23:05] inherited you you kicked out all the
[1:23:07] trash that was in here you know all the
[1:23:09] idols and all the monuments you got rid
[1:23:12] of that and you begin you begin to you
[1:23:14] know clean up the walls as it were but
[1:23:15] but it was already here for you to enjoy
[1:23:19] for your blessing so yeah I mean you
[1:23:21] didn't have to you didn't have to spend
[1:23:23] two million dollars to build a building
[1:23:24] and then and then be strapped with
[1:23:26] payments for the rest of
[1:23:28] Eternity before God comes it was already
[1:23:30] here and God added it you see how good
[1:23:33] God is I'm just using a natural a very
[1:23:36] natural uh perspective of this but they
[1:23:40] went into the promised land and
[1:23:42] everything they needed
[1:23:44] everything for their life every detail
[1:23:47] of their life was going to be taken care
[1:23:49] of
[1:23:50] and God had promised them I'll be with
[1:23:53] you it's your land
[1:23:55] and 12 go in
[1:23:58] and when they come back out what's the
[1:24:00] report
[1:24:02] one by one they begin to say hey
[1:24:05] tremendous land
[1:24:07] it's amazing
[1:24:09] look at the size of the vines look at
[1:24:11] the grapes they're carrying look at look
[1:24:13] at what it's been but we got a problem
[1:24:19] the inhabitants of that land
[1:24:21] make us look like ants
[1:24:24] they're huge
[1:24:26] these are giants
[1:24:29] these are giants how are we ever gonna
[1:24:31] how are we ever gonna take that land
[1:24:33] against them
[1:24:36] and God was angry with them
[1:24:40] that's that's Paramount to calling the
[1:24:42] blood of Jesus Christ tonight
[1:24:43] insufficient
[1:24:46] because God had given them a promise
[1:24:50] he had said I will go before you
[1:24:53] I will go I will the one I'm the one
[1:24:55] that's going to go before you
[1:24:57] this is your land I'm giving you this
[1:24:59] land and they literally took the promise
[1:25:01] of God and said ah the I can see it the
[1:25:04] land is good I know it's good man we got
[1:25:07] the fruits of it come on Brothers we
[1:25:10] literally had a prophet messenger uh
[1:25:12] another Joshua Ministry go over to the
[1:25:16] land and come back with fruits of Vine
[1:25:18] we saw the dead raised you saw you saw
[1:25:21] the lame walk you saw Hearts being
[1:25:23] discerned listen we have we have had the
[1:25:25] the fullness of the word given back to
[1:25:28] us in its entirety
[1:25:30] and what's your report tonight
[1:25:33] what's your report tonight because
[1:25:34] because 10 of them came back
[1:25:37] with the report that hey we believe what
[1:25:39] we hear on tape we believe God sent a
[1:25:42] prophet we believe that there's a land
[1:25:43] that's promised and we we want to go
[1:25:46] take the land but but we just can't it's
[1:25:49] it's just too great though the obstacles
[1:25:51] are too great I don't think I got enough
[1:25:53] faith for that
[1:25:55] and God was angry with their report
[1:25:58] and then you hear what Joshua the
[1:26:01] Joshua's report 40 years old was I when
[1:26:04] I went to when I was uh when I went was
[1:26:07] I when Moses the servant Lord sent me
[1:26:09] from kadish barnia to spy out the land
[1:26:11] and I brought him word again as it was
[1:26:15] in my lips
[1:26:18] oh because somebody told me so
[1:26:21] no listen Joshua Caleb had a revelation
[1:26:26] as it was in my heart
[1:26:28] listen the word has got to drop from
[1:26:30] here down to here I I remember hearing a
[1:26:33] brother preach a little message
[1:26:34] something about being 18 inches short
[1:26:36] one time he said that's about how far it
[1:26:38] is from your head to your heart just
[1:26:40] about 18 inches but that Journey going
[1:26:42] from here down to here can take a long
[1:26:45] time sometimes but when Caleb came back
[1:26:49] he come back with a testimony hey that
[1:26:51] land is that land is exactly what God is
[1:26:54] from that land is more than we deserve
[1:26:56] that that land is phenomenal when do we
[1:26:58] get to go when can we get it
[1:27:01] and meanwhile all the rest of them are
[1:27:03] saying hey Hey listen listen we're in
[1:27:06] the same land you you how we agree that
[1:27:08] that God the power of God is there we we
[1:27:10] agree that God God is more than able to
[1:27:13] take care of us but we've got a problem
[1:27:16] it's the Giants
[1:27:18] I'm afraid of the Giants
[1:27:20] I don't think I can quit I don't think
[1:27:22] I've got what it takes I don't think I
[1:27:23] don't think I'm a man enough to to fight
[1:27:25] with the Giants I don't think we're
[1:27:27] capable isn't that a shame the same God
[1:27:31] that had led them for 40 years in the
[1:27:34] wilderness the same God that had brought
[1:27:36] them out of the land of Egypt and they'd
[1:27:39] watched the pillar of Fire come on
[1:27:40] Church they had watched a pillar of Fire
[1:27:42] by day and they seen by night and A
[1:27:46] Cloud by day and if we haven't seen the
[1:27:48] very same thing and they followed a
[1:27:51] Moses over a Moses Ministry uh through
[1:27:54] the land and here's God showing himself
[1:27:56] on a daily basis not just feeding them
[1:27:58] you know not just giving them uh uh you
[1:28:01] know the the the the the the stuff they
[1:28:03] ate in Egypt but literally God would
[1:28:05] rain down Manna out of heaven and then
[1:28:07] they begin to complain and God would
[1:28:09] literally give them Quail you would give
[1:28:11] them their harsh desire here we are
[1:28:13] church here we are God has literally
[1:28:17] take from the time that you gave your
[1:28:19] heart to the Lord Jesus God has
[1:28:21] literally taken care of you your whole
[1:28:23] life your whole life but he ain't
[1:28:25] wanting us to stay here I don't care how
[1:28:28] long you've lived here he might like you
[1:28:31] right here as far as your natural body
[1:28:33] is concerned but your spiritual man the
[1:28:36] innermost being God has got something
[1:28:38] more for you listen where God is never
[1:28:41] done this great Book of Revelation this
[1:28:44] this great this great God who keeps
[1:28:46] unfolding himself he is never done and
[1:28:49] he wants to unveil himself and express
[1:28:51] himself he wants to become so real to
[1:28:54] you
[1:28:55] that when you speak
[1:28:57] something happens
[1:28:59] When you pray something happens when you
[1:29:02] know that you know listen Caleb wasn't
[1:29:04] standing there quaking and shivering he
[1:29:07] was like I know that I know that I know
[1:29:10] that I know that I know it had become
[1:29:12] real to him
[1:29:14] that's what we need Church
[1:29:16] Revelation is the children of gods I've
[1:29:19] been preaching on this thought at home
[1:29:20] Revelation is the children of God's
[1:29:22] inheritance
[1:29:23] because when it becomes real nothing can
[1:29:26] take that from you nothing as long as
[1:29:29] it's not Revelation as long as it's only
[1:29:31] head knowledge or hopes those people can
[1:29:33] comment and circumstances can happen and
[1:29:36] it takes it away from you
[1:29:37] but when it drops into your from your
[1:29:40] head to your heart no devil in hell just
[1:29:42] like we preached last night nothing
[1:29:44] can take that from you
[1:29:46] Hallelujah
[1:29:49] Moses okay
[1:29:50] uh verse 7 40 years old was I when Moses
[1:29:53] the servant of the Lord sent me from
[1:29:55] canish Barney to Aspire to land and I
[1:29:57] brought him word again as it was in my
[1:29:59] heart
[1:30:00] nevertheless
[1:30:03] my brethren that went up with me
[1:30:06] made the heart of the people
[1:30:08] to melt
[1:30:11] my
[1:30:13] God made the heart of the people what
[1:30:15] kind of ministry was there that wasn't
[1:30:16] willing to take the whole word it wasn't
[1:30:19] willing to take God out his word you
[1:30:21] know it's one thing to it's it's one
[1:30:23] thing to say this you know I believe God
[1:30:25] sent a prophet and I know that God
[1:30:27] worked in that man and he did and we
[1:30:29] believe that and we follow that man like
[1:30:31] like they followed Paul
[1:30:34] but we're not following the man we're
[1:30:36] following the god that's in the man why
[1:30:38] because that God Was the Same God that
[1:30:40] walked the shores of Galilee and he did
[1:30:43] the same things then in his Earthly
[1:30:45] Ministry to the Jewish people now he's
[1:30:47] doing the same to the gentile people and
[1:30:50] here we are recognizing hey it's God
[1:30:52] manifested again of course we're going
[1:30:54] to follow him of course we're going to
[1:30:56] follow him but listen it's one thing to
[1:30:58] say yeah I believe that God was in that
[1:31:00] man it's another thing to say you know
[1:31:02] what I'm brother Gerald can a pastor
[1:31:04] here for 40 plus years I know he's a man
[1:31:07] of God I know that God speaks to him I I
[1:31:10] just know that I know I could go to him
[1:31:12] and he'll pray and God's Gonna but what
[1:31:14] about you
[1:31:16] what about you as long as it's just
[1:31:18] somebody else I mean we all got a place
[1:31:20] a part to play in this but as long as
[1:31:22] it's just somebody else
[1:31:25] we're missing something
[1:31:27] because when it hits our doorstep all of
[1:31:29] a sudden fear comes in and all of a
[1:31:31] sudden we're not sure anymore and that's
[1:31:33] exactly what God wants to do away with
[1:31:36] take the fear out of the people
[1:31:38] Hallelujah
[1:31:40] so amazing
[1:31:43] here's 40 years
[1:31:45] 40 Years of wandering in the wilderness
[1:31:48] and Caleb is standing there him and
[1:31:50] Joshua standing there and 40 Years of
[1:31:53] listening to people Grumble and complain
[1:31:56] and Grumble and complain nothing's ever
[1:31:58] good enough nobody they're never
[1:32:00] satisfied they're never happy they're
[1:32:01] never content reminds me of some
[1:32:03] Believers nowadays everything is just
[1:32:05] always wrong it's just never right and
[1:32:07] it just hey come on Church
[1:32:10] come on God didn't put us here to
[1:32:11] Grumble and complain if we want to see
[1:32:14] change you've heard this little
[1:32:16] statement if you want to see change then
[1:32:17] be the change that you want to see
[1:32:20] in other words we want to put it off on
[1:32:22] the pastor whether you know if brother
[1:32:23] Jonathan would just if he'd just do it
[1:32:25] this way or if he could just if he'd
[1:32:27] just preach this way no no if you just
[1:32:29] get down on your knees and start to pray
[1:32:31] I'll tell you what the gift of God has
[1:32:34] nothing to do with the man
[1:32:35] the gift of God when you get to pulling
[1:32:37] on the gift of God regardless of who's
[1:32:39] standing there if you pull he'll move
[1:32:43] he'll move he'll start to say things and
[1:32:45] preach in ways that he never even knew
[1:32:47] was possible and I know that from my own
[1:32:50] experiences
[1:32:52] when going the people of God go to
[1:32:53] pulling you you you do things that you
[1:32:55] never thought you would ever do you
[1:32:57] don't even understand why you're doing
[1:32:59] why because he's God
[1:33:01] because you operate the gift you operate
[1:33:04] the gift here's this whole generation of
[1:33:07] complainers and complainers and and in
[1:33:10] it all Joshua and Canaveral still

[1:34:20] up the next morning singing the Praises
[1:34:23] of Jesus Christ
[1:34:25] why because he's still Hebrews 13 8 he
[1:34:28] is still Jesus Christ the same and I'll
[1:34:31] tell you what when we go to putting him
[1:34:33] back somewhere else we're missing out
[1:34:35] we're the ones losing out as long as
[1:34:37] they wanted to leave him on their
[1:34:38] journey in the desert yeah he was God
[1:34:40] and he fed us with the bread and he fed
[1:34:42] us with the coal the quail and we got
[1:34:44] the water from the Rock and they still
[1:34:46] murmured and complained and he healed
[1:34:48] our diseases but when it comes to going
[1:34:51] over
[1:34:52] come on church he doesn't call you out
[1:34:54] unless he's ready to call you in
[1:34:57] the only person that can keep you from
[1:34:59] going in is you
[1:35:01] that's the only person God's already the
[1:35:03] door is already open
[1:35:05] absolutely the door is already open
[1:35:07] there was a door open in heaven
[1:35:08] Revelation chapter four and a voice said
[1:35:10] come up hither
[1:35:12] come on what's he doing he's calling us
[1:35:14] out to call us into Heavenly places in
[1:35:16] Christ
[1:35:17] and here's here's Caleb and Joshua
[1:35:20] standing there and they're looking at
[1:35:21] this promise that that God has made and
[1:35:23] I I want you to consider this this is
[1:35:25] Caleb's portion Caleb and literally when
[1:35:28] he spoke to to to Moses he said when we
[1:35:31] get over there I want my portion
[1:35:34] he'd already went and scoped out the
[1:35:36] land and when he came back to Moses he
[1:35:37] said when we get there I would like this
[1:35:40] I would like Mount Horeb
[1:35:43] and Moses had given it to him
[1:35:47] listen the Holy Spirit has this the word
[1:35:49] of God has given you everything
[1:35:51] it's not law no more it's Grace it's
[1:35:53] been given to you amazing grace Amazing
[1:35:57] Grace
[1:35:59] verse 9.
[1:36:01] Moses swear on that day saying surely
[1:36:03] the land where on thy feet of trod and
[1:36:05] shall be thine inheritance and thy
[1:36:07] children's forever

[1:39:40] you willing to take the word of God
[1:39:41] claim it for your very own you're not

[1:39:45] Lord if you have to you're going to
[1:39:46] stand there you know toe-to-toe with the
[1:39:48] Enemy and you're you're just gonna hack
[1:39:50] away until the enemy Falls why because
[1:39:52] it's not by might and it's not by your

[1:39:57] Lord here's you know there's your pastor
[1:39:59] all these years 42 years and now here's
[1:40:02] Caleb standing there here's Caleb saying
[1:40:05] that said Lord you need Joshua you know
[1:40:07] I'm here to remind you of a promise that
[1:40:09] Moses gave me 40 years ago when we
[1:40:12] entered into this land Moses told me
[1:40:15] that that was my mountain
[1:40:17] that was my mountain and I we're just
[1:40:19] going to read it because I think it
[1:40:21] doesn't get said much better than the
[1:40:22] scripture can say it
[1:40:24] watch his watches verse 10 he says and
[1:40:26] behold the Lord hath kept me alive and
[1:40:29] he said these 40 and five years ever
[1:40:31] since the Lord spake this word unto
[1:40:33] Moses while the children of Israel
[1:40:35] wandered in the wilderness now lo I am
[1:40:39] this day for score and five years old
[1:40:42] I'll tell you what that does good for
[1:40:43] some of us old folks for 80 and 5 years
[1:40:46] old 85 and yet I am as strong this day
[1:40:51] as I was in that day that Moses sent me
[1:40:54] as my strength was then even so is my
[1:40:57] strength now for war
[1:41:00] come on Church
[1:41:02] listen Caleb is already in the Promised
[1:41:06] Land
[1:41:06] don't you ever get to think something
[1:41:08] you know so I hear I hear a lot of
[1:41:10] preaching sometimes about about you know
[1:41:12] we're just kind of where we were in the
[1:41:13] capsule we just relax now and God's got
[1:41:15] it all you know we're just waiting for
[1:41:17] the Rapture and I'll tell you what
[1:41:19] brother Brown said you will fight every
[1:41:21] day of your yes I believe we're away I
[1:41:23] believe in absolutely in the rest of God
[1:41:26] I but I believe in the Shalom I believe
[1:41:29] that since this message has come it's
[1:41:31] called Shalom rest little bride rest why
[1:41:34] because your judge has become your jury
[1:41:36] you have already been proclaimed
[1:41:38] innocent you have nothing against you
[1:41:41] but you are in the greatest battle that
[1:41:44] has ever been fought brother round says
[1:41:46] that Holy Ghost Land was like and unto
[1:41:48] Canaan land he said it was not a
[1:41:50] millennium he said it was a it was a
[1:41:52] land that they fought for it was a land
[1:41:54] where they have struggles and troubles
[1:41:56] it was a land where they fought for
[1:41:58] their promise
[1:41:59] when you're done fighting we're going to
[1:42:01] be in the Millennium but until then
[1:42:03] you've got to promised land and it's in
[1:42:05] a spiritual world and you're gunning for
[1:42:07] it I tell you what I mean you look at
[1:42:10] the sons of anaca you keep your eyes
[1:42:12] focused on them and commit yourself to
[1:42:14] taking them down we all got to Goliath
[1:42:16] in our life we all go to Goliath in our
[1:42:19] life we need to take the same attitude
[1:42:20] that David took which was a third full
[1:42:22] attitude he looked at the man and he
[1:42:24] said this day this day I'll take your
[1:42:27] head off
[1:42:28] what is that speaking the word
[1:42:31] while everybody else stood there and
[1:42:33] trembled at all of his you know all of
[1:42:36] his great uh
[1:42:37] um all of his great threats and you know
[1:42:40] he had his his name and all his ribbons
[1:42:43] up there and I'm sure the newspaper it
[1:42:45] they'd spread every fight around the
[1:42:47] world I think that's probably what a lot
[1:42:48] of Saul's problem was they spent too
[1:42:50] much time listening to the news reading
[1:42:52] about all of his Great accomplishments
[1:42:54] and and how great this man was and how
[1:42:57] many great men he had defeated and David
[1:42:59] spent his time with the greatest of all
[1:43:01] Warriors back in the backside of the
[1:43:03] desert somewhere it's come on church you
[1:43:06] can spend the same time with him in your
[1:43:07] car going to work you can spend the same
[1:43:09] time with him on your knees beside your
[1:43:11] bed you can spend the same time in your
[1:43:13] easy chair as David spent out there in a
[1:43:16] nice little uh nice little Meadow
[1:43:18] somewhere as well he was feeding
[1:43:19] father's sheep
[1:43:21] he knew the power of God
[1:43:23] and he heard the same thing that that
[1:43:25] whole Army heard including Saul who was
[1:43:28] the pastor he heard the same thing
[1:43:31] and he said you're kidding me
[1:43:33] you're going to let that thing defy the
[1:43:37] army of the Living God
[1:43:39] what was he hearing that they weren't
[1:43:41] hearing I'll tell you he was hearing a
[1:43:43] different sound he was hearing a
[1:43:45] different sound he was looking at a God
[1:43:48] that that he so loved and so cherished
[1:43:50] and knew that he was the god of Cree
[1:43:52] David knew he was the son of God
[1:43:55] he looked at his giant and he said no
[1:43:57] way if nobody else will fight him I'll
[1:43:59] go fight him now that's what God wants
[1:44:02] he wants you to be a David tonight he he
[1:44:04] wants you to to unsheet your little
[1:44:06] sling maybe you maybe you don't got the
[1:44:08] sword in your hand but but you got a
[1:44:10] little slingshot called faith
[1:44:12] f-a-i-t-h
[1:44:14] and you know David didn't just stand on
[1:44:16] this bank and say hey I think that's
[1:44:18] close enough buddy I'll just throw it
[1:44:19] from here oh no you go read the story
[1:44:22] David looked at that man and he made his
[1:44:24] Proclamation this day this is the last
[1:44:27] day you're going to make your threat
[1:44:28] this day this day I'm gonna take your
[1:44:31] head off this day you're gonna die

[1:45:09] one comes from eternity this one says
[1:45:11] Son of God lineage of God almighty
[1:45:15] and I hear a prophet say that if you are
[1:45:18] the bottom of the feet of the body of
[1:45:20] Christ you're still on top of Satan
[1:45:22] you're still greater than what he is
[1:45:25] you know we we we we look at ourselves

[1:46:17] have trod and and how long that you've
[1:46:19] professed the name of Jesus Christ how
[1:46:22] weary you've gotten from Battle after
[1:46:23] battle after battle left God knows we go
[1:46:26] we got it it's one battle after another
[1:46:29] God knows it

[1:46:43] I'll tell you something saying you're
[1:46:45] looking at the body that's failing but
[1:46:46] the man on the inside he can still take
[1:46:49] down mountains he can still take down
[1:46:51] mountains he can still slay Giants
[1:46:54] hallelujah what an hour to live in
[1:46:57] sitting he says in as I was in the day
[1:47:01] that Moses sent me as my strength was
[1:47:03] then even so is my strength now for war
[1:47:05] both to go out and to come in notice his
[1:47:08] confession
[1:47:10] verse 12.
[1:47:13] now therefore now you make this your
[1:47:15] confession tonight
[1:47:16] now therefore
[1:47:18] what's that what's Caleb asking for
[1:47:21] his portion
[1:47:23] what's Caleb asking for
[1:47:25] his portion
[1:47:27] what did you come for tonight
[1:47:30] it's because it was church
[1:47:33] because it was church
[1:47:36] you came with the wrong attitude
[1:47:39] well because there was a special speaker
[1:47:41] here
[1:47:42] came with the wrong attitude
[1:47:44] Caleb had a purpose
[1:47:48] Caleb said now therefore give me this
[1:47:51] mountain
[1:47:52] give me this mountain Joshua you heard
[1:47:56] the promise
[1:47:57] you were there you witnessed this
[1:47:59] promise that Moses gave Now give me this
[1:48:01] mountain
[1:48:02] Kenneth will you talk about man
[1:48:05] rather we fought for years the good
[1:48:07] fight of faith that mountain has got the
[1:48:09] biggest giants out of this whole land
[1:48:12] that man that's the most infested
[1:48:14] mountain in the whole land
[1:48:17] and you buddy
[1:48:19] you're 85 years old
[1:48:23] what do you mean can't take something
[1:48:26] else
[1:48:27] anything
[1:48:30] notice how the devil wants to do to you
[1:48:31] tonight
[1:48:33] wants to give you a substitute
[1:48:35] just take something else now you know
[1:48:37] you don't really need it you'll be okay
[1:48:38] without it there's other things that are
[1:48:40] good
[1:48:41] come on Caleb
[1:48:44] push those shoulders back
[1:48:46] suck your chest up
[1:48:49] put your sword in the ground or your
[1:48:50] spear in the ground and look that devil
[1:48:52] in the eye and say that's my mountain
[1:48:54] and I'm going to take it that's my
[1:48:57] mountain and I'm going to take it says
[1:48:59] therefore give me this mountain that the
[1:49:02] Lord spake in that day for thou hers in
[1:49:04] that day how the anakms were there and
[1:49:07] that the cities were great and fenced if
[1:49:09] so be the Lord be will be with me
[1:49:12] then I shall be able to drive them out
[1:49:15] as the Lord said
[1:49:18] I'm reminded of a scripture if the Lord
[1:49:20] before us
[1:49:23] what's the rest
[1:49:25] who can be against us
[1:49:28] if the Lord before us who can be against
[1:49:31] us
[1:49:33] they gotta say what can be against us
[1:49:36] because you might take the Who as a
[1:49:38] person or a personality or or something
[1:49:40] like that but let me say what
[1:49:43] can be against you
[1:49:46] who is Satan but he comes in many forms
[1:49:50] if the Lord before us which we believe
[1:49:52] he is tonight
[1:49:54] then who can be against me
[1:49:57] verse 13.
[1:50:00] and Joshua blessed him
[1:50:02] and gave unto Caleb the son of jephnah
[1:50:05] Hebron
[1:50:07] for an inheritance
[1:50:09] Hebron therefore became the inheritance
[1:50:11] of Kayla the son of Jeff not the case
[1:50:13] night unto this day because he holy
[1:50:16] followed the Lord God of Israel
[1:50:20] amen I think I'll just stop it right
[1:50:22] there as far as that scripture is
[1:50:23] concerned you know there's a
[1:50:26] I want to take this little thought on on
[1:50:28] Caleb's portion
[1:50:31] now you can just take Caleb's name out
[1:50:33] and just drop your name in there
[1:50:35] Lord what's my portion tonight what's my
[1:50:37] portion tonight you know what you're
[1:50:40] here for but sometimes we you know we
[1:50:41] get to looking at our our carnality and
[1:50:43] and we just think well it's just I just
[1:50:45] don't got it I just don't God but God
[1:50:47] doesn't want you looking at you
[1:50:50] boy if we could just take the mirror the
[1:50:52] mirrors off of the walls of our bathroom
[1:50:55] and off of the walls of our bedroom and
[1:50:57] we could place this mirror
[1:50:59] this picture in the mirror
[1:51:02] because this is what God wants you
[1:51:03] looking at he wants you to look at the
[1:51:05] all sufficient like we heard that little
[1:51:08] song the All sufficient sacrifice the
[1:51:11] one that came not just to pay the whole
[1:51:13] price but to make sure that you and I
[1:51:16] would make it he promised I would come
[1:51:18] and live in you to make sure you're
[1:51:20] going to make it over
[1:51:22] you don't want you looking at you he
[1:51:24] wants you looking at him
[1:51:25] he wants your eyes focused on the word
[1:51:28] of God and there's a little there's a
[1:51:30] little fella you'll find over in the
[1:51:31] book of of Chronicles and you know what
[1:51:34] Chronicles it's kind of almost a boring
[1:51:35] book to read if you if you that are
[1:51:37] Bible students or or study the
[1:51:39] scriptures at all you get to you get to
[1:51:41] looking at it and it's just like all
[1:51:42] these genealogies this man was this
[1:51:44] man's son and it all just goes on and it
[1:51:46] just you just get lost in it all and I'm
[1:51:49] not very good at all that kind of stuff
[1:51:50] but there is something that did catch my
[1:51:52] attention if you turn over the book of
[1:51:54] Chronicles First Chronicles chapter four
[1:51:55] and just keep it on your lap for a
[1:51:57] moment I want to look at a little man by
[1:51:59] the name of Jabez
[1:52:01] not very much a set about him not very
[1:52:04] much as spoke about him you don't hear
[1:52:06] about him much but I'll tell you what if
[1:52:08] God was God if God thought enough of him
[1:52:10] to put him in his word then there was a
[1:52:11] value to him being there
[1:52:13] and when we begin to look at this this
[1:52:15] young man I I tell you what the more I
[1:52:18] begin to study his little life what
[1:52:20] what's there and and you know you got to
[1:52:22] basically read into it but when you
[1:52:24] start looking at what's there I'll tell
[1:52:25] you what he ought to be such an
[1:52:27] inspiration to each one of us
[1:52:29] we ought to be able to look into the
[1:52:30] word of God and say Lord that's me Lord
[1:52:33] that's what I want in my life and and
[1:52:35] First Chronicles chapter 4 and verse 9
[1:52:37] it starts out like this it says in Jabez
[1:52:40] was more honorable
[1:52:42] than his brethren
[1:52:45] and his mother called his name Jabez
[1:52:47] saying because I bear him with sorrow I
[1:52:50] don't know about you but you know
[1:52:52] brother Brown makes a statement like
[1:52:53] this he says he says you know he says a
[1:52:55] name the value in a name and he gets
[1:52:58] talking to parents he says now be
[1:52:59] careful what you name your children
[1:53:02] you know what I I have to be honest you
[1:53:05] know I I got a family and I got kids and
[1:53:07] and they're having kids and some of the
[1:53:09] names I'm scratching my head thinking oh
[1:53:11] my word where did you pull that out of
[1:53:13] it but but today's world there there's
[1:53:16] names that are being spoken and brother
[1:53:18] Brown makes a comment he says you know
[1:53:19] how he says don't name your kid Ricky
[1:53:21] and don't name him Elvis and and he
[1:53:23] makes that he makes those comments for a
[1:53:25] reason he says now he says as you speak
[1:53:27] that name
[1:53:28] every name comes with a character
[1:53:31] and you might not realize what it is but
[1:53:33] as you speak that name Johnny do this
[1:53:36] Johnny do that Johnny I need you to do
[1:53:38] this John I need you to do that John I
[1:53:40] need you to I'm not picking on John
[1:53:41] because I have a John but but as you as
[1:53:44] you speak that name a characteristic
[1:53:46] gets molded into that being because you
[1:53:49] call him that name
[1:53:51] Now read the scriptures
[1:53:53] and his mother named him Jabez
[1:53:59] because
[1:54:03] I bore him in sorrow
[1:54:09] wow
[1:54:11] how do you like a name like that who
[1:54:13] doesn't sound that bad
[1:54:16] it expresses the woman's pain not her
[1:54:18] Joy
[1:54:19] the pain
[1:54:22] that she went through maybe maybe her
[1:54:24] husband died maybe things went wrong I
[1:54:26] don't know what happened but but for
[1:54:27] whatever reason she was in a lot of
[1:54:29] Sorrow when she bore this young and she
[1:54:31] calls him that and every time somebody
[1:54:33] calls him that that's what's going to be
[1:54:35] imparted into his life
[1:54:37] excuse me brother Joshua it is right we
[1:54:39] gotta we have a brother back at home
[1:54:40] that come over from oh I forget what
[1:54:42] country it was
[1:54:44] uh brother lucky
[1:54:46] his name is lucky
[1:54:49] and
[1:54:50] and you know it wouldn't be something I
[1:54:52] would have named my child and maybe his
[1:54:53] mom and dad didn't see it any different
[1:54:55] but but but he is
[1:54:57] seems like whatever he touches it just
[1:54:59] works
[1:55:02] here's Jabez how would you like to be
[1:55:03] called Jabez that's almost
[1:55:06] kin to be calling loser
[1:55:08] hey Loser come on upstairs
[1:55:10] loser it's supper time loser how did you
[1:55:13] do at school
[1:55:14] loser
[1:55:18] how would you like it if it was your
[1:55:19] name
[1:55:22] Jabez
[1:55:24] oh yeah all the all the sorrow my mother
[1:55:26] was in Jabez all of this is being
[1:55:29] implanted into this young man
[1:55:31] but I want you to notice
[1:55:33] look at the young man here's his
[1:55:35] situation
[1:55:37] he's come out of Sorrow
[1:55:39] he's been raised in a home that's full
[1:55:41] of Sorrow
[1:55:42] and now he hears as a young man but but
[1:55:44] Jabez has got something inside of him
[1:55:46] he's got he's got a hold of a revelation
[1:55:50] he's got a hold of a revelation that God
[1:55:52] literally stops the chronicler and he
[1:55:55] begins to expound on this one young man
[1:55:58] by the name of Jabez and if you get to
[1:56:00] looking at him he says at verse 10 says
[1:56:02] in Jabez called on the god of Israel
[1:56:04] saying oh that thou would bless me
[1:56:07] indeed
[1:56:09] and enlarge my coasts that thine hand
[1:56:12] might be with me that I that thou
[1:56:14] wouldest Keep Me From Evil that it may
[1:56:16] not grieve me and God granted him
[1:56:19] that which we which he requested
[1:56:23] look at Jabez Jabez had he caught a
[1:56:25] revelation
[1:56:27] I'm an Israelite
[1:56:28] I don't care what it what people say
[1:56:30] about me I don't care where you come
[1:56:32] from I don't care what your background
[1:56:33] is some of you are like me raised in a
[1:56:35] message home and that's a wonderful
[1:56:37] blessing but listen there's many that
[1:56:39] God's raised up like Rahab the Harlem we
[1:56:41] heard of her last night like uh like
[1:56:43] Ruth the moabitus and how many of our
[1:56:46] generation how many of the people we
[1:56:47] know literally have come out of the we
[1:56:50] call it the bottom of the barrel
[1:56:52] but Satan will be there to remind them
[1:56:55] constantly of where they come from what
[1:56:58] they were how they were raised the
[1:57:00] mistakes they made and how they could
[1:57:02] never get any closer but if you catch
[1:57:04] the same Revelation Japan's caught as a
[1:57:06] born-again Son of God you can say the
[1:57:09] same thing Jabez is saying here he said
[1:57:11] he was more honorable than all of his
[1:57:13] Brethren but he wasn't looking at his he
[1:57:15] wasn't looking at his problem he wasn't
[1:57:17] looking at his circumstance he wasn't
[1:57:20] acknowledging what the world was calling
[1:57:22] him but he said you know what I have an
[1:57:24] inheritance
[1:57:25] I'm an Israelite I was a born Israelite
[1:57:29] and brother Brown would use this little
[1:57:30] illustration
[1:57:32] he would use this little illustration of
[1:57:33] a you know of a he called it a
[1:57:35] knock-kneed little donkey or a a horse
[1:57:38] or whatever it was and how two farmers
[1:57:40] were side by side and you know and they
[1:57:43] would they each had animals and he got
[1:57:45] to talking about the one farmer had just
[1:57:46] this great farm and and and he raised
[1:57:49] pedigreed animals and here comes this
[1:57:51] one little horse that comes out in the
[1:57:53] spring and the poor little thing is just
[1:57:55] it's it's just decrepit it just really
[1:57:57] it's it's it just doesn't look like it's
[1:57:59] going to amount to anything you know
[1:58:01] it's all not need and its tail is bent
[1:58:03] and you know maybe the ear is hanging
[1:58:05] low and and and beside him are these
[1:58:07] beautiful young prancing horses and and
[1:58:10] and he gets to looking at himself and
[1:58:12] he's like well I know what I know what's
[1:58:13] going to happen to me
[1:58:15] I look in the mirror and I know what's
[1:58:16] going to happen to me he's just going to
[1:58:18] put me on the ax you know on the
[1:58:19] chopping block and that'll be the end of
[1:58:21] me
[1:58:23] there was one problem
[1:58:25] brother Brandon would remind us his
[1:58:27] mother would say no you don't have to
[1:58:29] worry about that because you have a
[1:58:33] pedigree
[1:58:34] a pedigree not a pedicure girls a
[1:58:37] pedigree
[1:58:39] you have a pedigree
[1:58:41] Brothers we have a pedigree tonight
[1:58:43] sisters we have a pedigree tonight we
[1:58:45] have a lineage that comes from God
[1:58:47] himself and God himself is going to
[1:58:50] finish that which he has started here's
[1:58:52] his little man jabezen and you know he
[1:58:55] he maybe didn't have much to star with
[1:58:57] in life and he maybe wasn't he wasn't
[1:58:59] looked at but he was not afraid to call
[1:59:01] on God and say Lord bless me
[1:59:04] bless me
[1:59:05] I believe that here we are tonight and
[1:59:07] regardless of where you're walking with
[1:59:09] the Lord why don't you just get down and
[1:59:10] say Lord bless me I'm not talking about
[1:59:13] tonight Lord bless my life Lord make my
[1:59:16] life a blessing take me and make me what
[1:59:18] you want me to be why because I am a Son
[1:59:21] of God I'm not going to be I am tonight
[1:59:23] I'm a Son of God Lord bless my life and
[1:59:26] and you know the Bible would say a
[1:59:27] sincere prayer of a righteous man a
[1:59:30] veilth much
[1:59:31] and you say well I believe that brother
[1:59:33] Johanna and I believe Jonathan's a
[1:59:35] righteous man and brother Cheryl's a
[1:59:36] righteous man brother Bob's your
[1:59:38] righteous man and you know brother Paul
[1:59:40] is a righteous man I believe all those
[1:59:42] things I believe those are righteous men
[1:59:43] and but you know what the problem is
[1:59:46] you say but me I make so many mistakes I
[1:59:49] I
[1:59:51] can't really call myself righteous
[1:59:53] that is a lying devil
[1:59:56] because the prophet would come down and
[1:59:58] give us the definition
[2:00:00] of righteous which you won't find in the
[2:00:03] dictionary
[2:00:05] he would say a righteous man is not a
[2:00:09] perfect man
[2:00:11] a righteous man is a forgiven man
[2:00:15] that's the difference
[2:00:17] I'm righteous he's he I'm righteous
[2:00:18] because he's righteous
[2:00:20] I'm perfect because he's perfect
[2:00:22] Hallelujah
[2:00:24] so you know the bible say that that God
[2:00:26] is a rewarder of those that diligently
[2:00:28] seek him
[2:00:29] diligently seek Him and when we look at
[2:00:31] jabez's life when we look at the
[2:00:33] proclamation he's made Lord bless me
[2:00:36] Lord I don't got much going for me and I
[2:00:38] I'm not nothing but the Lord blessed me
[2:00:40] anyhow
[2:00:41] I'm I'm an Israelite Lord I I've got a
[2:00:44] lineage I've got a genealogy and Lord I
[2:00:47] want you to bless my life
[2:00:51] well you might even be afraid to go to
[2:00:52] God and ask him that tonight
[2:00:55] you may say well brother Dwayne that's
[2:00:56] that you know I'm not preaching
[2:00:59] Prosperity Gospel I hope you I hope you
[2:01:01] catch this
[2:01:02] I'm not preaching Prosperity Gospel but
[2:01:04] I do believe that God wants his children
[2:01:06] happy
[2:01:07] I do believe he wants him happy I do
[2:01:10] believe he wants him to he wants to meet
[2:01:11] their needs I I believe that we can be
[2:01:13] happy in the good times and we can be
[2:01:15] happy in the bad times
[2:01:16] because he is our portion
[2:01:19] you know it's a so you know Caleb wasn't
[2:01:22] afraid to go and make his Proclamation
[2:01:24] hey you promised me that land
[2:01:27] Jabez is not afraid to go to God under
[2:01:29] the circumstances and say Lord
[2:01:32] I can show you that I'm an Israelite
[2:01:35] here it is I can follow all my lineage
[2:01:37] all the way back to my great great great
[2:01:38] great I know that my greatest of great
[2:01:41] grandfathers was Abraham I know I lay in
[2:01:44] the promise
[2:01:45] he could say that
[2:01:47] sometimes you've got to go back and
[2:01:49] remind God
[2:01:50] and you really need to remind the enemy
[2:01:53] of whose son you really are whose
[2:01:55] daughter you really are
[2:01:57] so there's there's lots of times you
[2:01:58] know Jabez might have thought you know
[2:02:01] he could have been like we are so many
[2:02:03] times and just even been afraid I don't
[2:02:05] know if I'm asking too much Lord
[2:02:07] listen the Bible says ask abundantly
[2:02:10] that your joy would be full
[2:02:13] the problem is that we are we're afraid
[2:02:16] I touched on this last night we're
[2:02:18] afraid to ask
[2:02:19] we're afraid God won't answer our
[2:02:21] prayers Satan brings something to our
[2:02:22] mind and a little fear comes upon us and
[2:02:24] and we get afraid
[2:02:25] brother Brown would say that this is
[2:02:27] what's the trouble of the church today
[2:02:28] says you're afraid
[2:02:30] you're afraid when you ask
[2:02:32] you won't receive
[2:02:35] he says that's the reason you don't
[2:02:37] receive don't be don't be scared excuse
[2:02:40] me
[2:02:41] ask
[2:02:45] and then believe you're going to get it
[2:02:48] you'll get it
[2:02:50] bro
[2:02:52] Matt you heard those testimonies you
[2:02:54] were telling on dinner at breakfast this
[2:02:55] morning you get it
[2:02:58] he said God will give it to you
[2:03:01] now we know there's only two faculties
[2:03:02] there's there's only two forces that you
[2:03:04] and I are contending with this evening
[2:03:06] one is Faith and one is fear
[2:03:09] there's no there's no in between you
[2:03:11] it's either Faith or it's fear it's
[2:03:13] either life or it's death it's either
[2:03:14] God or Satan there's not an in-between
[2:03:18] he is life
[2:03:20] and he brings peace
[2:03:22] and he is faith
[2:03:24] Satan is death he brings fear and he
[2:03:28] brings sorrow
[2:03:30] brother Ryan will make the statement he
[2:03:31] said there's only two faculties that
[2:03:33] govern a human and that is either Faith
[2:03:34] which brings results
[2:03:37] Faith brings results
[2:03:39] or fear
[2:03:41] which has no value in it at all
[2:03:44] I had a brother at home and I think he I
[2:03:46] think he said it this way he said you
[2:03:47] know I hope I get the word rated acronym
[2:03:50] maybe that's the word I'm looking for
[2:03:52] you know the word fear f-e-a-r
[2:03:56] you know what actually
[2:03:57] speaks about you I I'm real bad at this
[2:04:00] my education isn't good enough for This
[2:04:02] Acronym I think is that the right where
[2:04:04] you it is John help me out here because
[2:04:06] I know he's smart
[2:04:09] Faith or fear
[2:04:11] is false
[2:04:13] evidence
[2:04:14] appearing
[2:04:16] real
[2:04:19] f-e-a-r false evidence
[2:04:23] but not just stick tonight
[2:04:25] whatever your situation is let it stick
[2:04:27] false evidence
[2:04:29] if it it listen this is the only truth
[2:04:31] there is
[2:04:32] and if what you got or what I got is
[2:04:34] false I got a couple boys that are
[2:04:36] Wayward it's false evidence it appears
[2:04:39] very real
[2:04:40] I contend with it I look at it I battle
[2:04:42] with it I talk to the Lord about it all
[2:04:44] the time but it is false evidence
[2:04:46] because I have a promise that those are
[2:04:48] my children and they're my inheritance
[2:04:51] so I'm not going to look at what I see
[2:04:53] I'm going to look at the word of God
[2:04:55] because the rest is a lying vanity just
[2:04:57] just like no uh Noah just like Jonah was
[2:05:00] in the bottom of that big fish he had to
[2:05:02] fight his way through and say it's all
[2:05:03] lying vanities
[2:05:05] I look towards that Holy Temple and I
[2:05:08] Call On Your Name Lord the rest is all
[2:05:10] lying vanities
[2:05:11] that's the same thing you and I got to
[2:05:13] do tonight
[2:05:14] so we realize that it's fear that keeps
[2:05:16] you wondering and fear that makes you
[2:05:18] anxious and fear that that gets you all
[2:05:20] upset
[2:05:22] listen fear is fear is not our Master
[2:05:25] tonight
[2:05:27] fear is not our master
[2:05:29] because when Jesus would come he would
[2:05:31] speak peace
[2:05:33] every time an angel of God would come
[2:05:35] and step out of that Dimension into this
[2:05:38] Dimension and meet somebody face to face
[2:05:40] what's brother Brown say the first thing
[2:05:42] that the angel of God would do is say
[2:05:43] fear not
[2:05:44] I'm sent from the presence of God
[2:05:47] why because it would be so it would be
[2:05:49] so uh says you you think you want to see
[2:05:52] angels that you don't think you don't
[2:05:53] know nothing about what you're talking
[2:05:54] about it's a it's a it's a fearful thing
[2:05:56] to stand in there in that Holy presence
[2:05:59] I believe him
[2:06:01] I believe him but when the spirit of God
[2:06:02] comes it comes to do what
[2:06:04] bring peace
[2:06:06] civil it
[2:06:09] now Satan's got a job
[2:06:11] now we know he's got a job
[2:06:13] and his job is to keep you afraid
[2:06:16] and if we be honest there's been times
[2:06:18] in our lives where he's done a good job
[2:06:19] of his job
[2:06:20] I'll tell you what he's been promoted to
[2:06:22] the to the highest promotion or lowest
[2:06:24] promotion that hell can offer if I could
[2:06:26] just call it that way
[2:06:28] he's good at what he does
[2:06:31] but you and I
[2:06:33] are not subject to him
[2:06:35] we are the sons of God
[2:06:38] what brown would say now listen he says
[2:06:40] he says listen to me the only hope there
[2:06:42] is today is the thing that people are
[2:06:44] afraid of
[2:06:46] it's that old-time Saint Paul's Revival
[2:06:49] and the Bible Holy Ghost back again
[2:06:53] that's what Satan's scared that's what
[2:06:55] people are afraid of oh I just I don't
[2:06:57] know if I can just let go I just don't
[2:06:58] know Lord I I don't wanna I don't want
[2:07:00] people to think I'm crazy listen I'd
[2:07:02] rather they think I'm crazy here as long
[2:07:04] as he's happy with me amen he says don't
[2:07:08] he says the Holy Ghost back again don't
[2:07:10] think it'll make you misbehave yourself
[2:07:13] that's the devil's business to keep you
[2:07:15] afraid of Christ
[2:07:17] but it's the only salvation left for any
[2:07:20] nation is the Lord Jesus and the power
[2:07:22] of the Resurrection
[2:07:24] people are afraid of it
[2:07:27] you say well brother Dwayne we've moved
[2:07:28] on we've moved I hear these things often
[2:07:30] we've moved on we're past that you might
[2:07:32] be past that as far as the revelation of
[2:07:34] the word is concerned we're past that as
[2:07:36] far as as where we're living but Satan's
[2:07:39] greatest attack is going on right now
[2:07:41] and you and I are fighting every day
[2:07:43] that we live
[2:07:44] we are fighting every day that we live
[2:07:47] brother Brown would come again he says
[2:07:48] the trouble with man tonight says the
[2:07:50] trouble of the people tonight is you're
[2:07:51] scared
[2:07:52] the biggest curse there is in the Full
[2:07:55] Gospel people I don't believe he's
[2:07:56] talking to Pentecost
[2:07:58] I believe the holy spirit is letting us
[2:07:59] know because we believe the Full Gospel
[2:08:01] they didn't believe it we believe it
[2:08:03] the Full Gospel people or any other
[2:08:04] people is because they're afraid
[2:08:06] God has made the provision
[2:08:09] but you're afraid to take his word for
[2:08:12] it
[2:08:12] if you wasn't afraid tonight why you
[2:08:15] would take your healing by faith and
[2:08:16] know that God promised it and the thing
[2:08:18] would just Plum leave you
[2:08:21] he said afraid scared
[2:08:23] I've noticed that that's the reason he
[2:08:25] said I'm such a believer in healing I
[2:08:27] know if you can get away the people away
[2:08:29] from the scare get Love in This Place
[2:08:31] something is going to happen
[2:08:34] Hallelujah you know the scripture just
[2:08:36] says ask abundantly that your joy would
[2:08:38] be full
[2:08:39] you know you have not because you don't
[2:08:40] ask and you don't ask because you
[2:08:43] don't believe
[2:08:46] well then whatever I'm feeling is going
[2:08:48] to be a lying vanity
[2:08:50] and I'm going to make the same
[2:08:51] Proclamation that Caleb spoke I'm going
[2:08:54] to make the same Proclamation that Jabez
[2:08:56] spoke Lord bless me
[2:08:58] Lord bless me I'm a Child of God Lord
[2:09:00] bless me Caleb give me this mountain
[2:09:03] give me this mountain
[2:09:05] Lord you promised me this mountain you
[2:09:07] Lord I'm coming this is my inheritance
[2:09:09] I'm coming for it now I want you to give
[2:09:11] me this mountain
[2:09:13] and God heard it and was pleased
[2:09:18] we say well brother Dwayne
[2:09:20] now listen the Bible speaks this way it
[2:09:22] says
[2:09:23] I said ask abundantly that your joy
[2:09:25] might be full and he says but then the
[2:09:27] scripture says if your heart condemn you
[2:09:29] not
[2:09:31] ask what you would
[2:09:33] that your joy might be full
[2:09:35] if your heart condemn you not
[2:09:38] ask what you would
[2:09:39] that your joy might be full
[2:09:42] and then we say well
[2:09:44] hey I'm gonna say if you're like me
[2:09:48] you know we
[2:09:49] we look in the mirror of God's word
[2:09:50] sometimes and we say ah Lord
[2:09:54] such a failure
[2:09:56] Lord I come so short of what I see in
[2:09:58] the word and I come so short of you know
[2:10:01] something the pressure gets on remember
[2:10:02] brother Brown
[2:10:04] when he's got that tax case going on and
[2:10:06] and he's in the house and he's got all
[2:10:08] this pressure of having to pray for
[2:10:09] people and Ministry and and meetings and
[2:10:12] and then the tax thing going on on top
[2:10:14] of it all and finally the tax man calls
[2:10:16] him and his wife answers the phone and
[2:10:18] says honey
[2:10:19] it's him again
[2:10:21] and he grabs his coat and makes a bolt
[2:10:23] for the door and he says honey tell them
[2:10:25] I'm out
[2:10:27] and runs through the door
[2:10:33] and then a little later he gets a phone
[2:10:37] brother random I got a boy that's dying
[2:10:39] I've got a girl that's dying I forget
[2:10:41] which one it was would you come pray for
[2:10:43] him
[2:10:44] certainly he'll come pray
[2:10:46] he goes
[2:10:49] Gets In The Presence gets ready to pray
[2:10:50] for the little boy
[2:10:52] and all of a sudden
[2:10:54] that condemnation settles down on his
[2:10:56] heart
[2:10:58] but you lied
[2:11:02] I know Lord but it's just under pressure
[2:11:04] no but you lied
[2:11:08] you know battle with it and I'm going to
[2:11:10] pray
[2:11:12] but you lied
[2:11:14] listen I'm so in let's all just say this
[2:11:16] church I am so thankful
[2:11:18] I say it this way I I am so thankful
[2:11:21] that the prophet that God sent
[2:11:23] was seventh grade educated
[2:11:26] that he was so transparent
[2:11:29] that he would tell you and I
[2:11:31] I lied
[2:11:34] I lied he would he would begin to
[2:11:36] express his weaknesses he'll begin to
[2:11:38] express his shortcomings he would show
[2:11:41] you and I that he was a man born in sin
[2:11:43] shaped and iniquity like you and I
[2:11:47] many times as we get you know we have
[2:11:49] pastors or preachers to get up behind
[2:11:50] the pulpit and they're just so perfect
[2:11:52] and they never would admit to making a
[2:11:54] mistake they'd never show a flaw they're
[2:11:56] just and you think oh my he's just such
[2:11:57] a man of God he is just as frail as you
[2:12:00] are he has made so many mistakes he has
[2:12:02] just got this facade going on and God
[2:12:04] forgive me I don't I'm not thinking or
[2:12:06] pointing at any man but but I've seen it
[2:12:07] where there's just they just they just
[2:12:09] show no weakness no no human they're
[2:12:11] just they're almost like God to the
[2:12:12] people and it's like shame on them
[2:12:14] we're just Flesh and Blood dirt just the
[2:12:17] same old just like everybody else you go
[2:12:19] home you make mistakes you rely you tell
[2:12:21] stories you fall down but
[2:12:24] but you never say it about yourself
[2:12:25] because you don't want anybody to think
[2:12:27] that you could be that kind of person
[2:12:28] I'm a I'm a I'm a Jonathan I'm a pastor
[2:12:31] I'm a Son of God yeah you're nothing
[2:12:33] more than a lump of dirt with a gift in
[2:12:35] it that's all you are
[2:12:37] no disrespect
[2:12:40] here's the man that has the most
[2:12:41] Revelation out of any man that you and I
[2:12:44] have ever known
[2:12:46] standing there saying I lied
[2:12:49] sir
[2:12:51] here's this boy dying sir
[2:12:54] would you excuse me for a minute
[2:12:57] I've got to go make something right
[2:13:01] there he goes
[2:13:03] except the phone
[2:13:04] calls the
[2:13:06] whatever office it was
[2:13:09] sir I got to talk to you for a minute
[2:13:11] when you called the other day I just got
[2:13:13] to make something straight when you
[2:13:15] called the other day
[2:13:16] and asked if I was in the house
[2:13:19] I lied
[2:13:22] and sir I want you to forgive me for
[2:13:24] that
[2:13:27] and the attorney on the other end says
[2:13:28] brother Branham
[2:13:30] I had such high regard for you
[2:13:33] all these years
[2:13:36] and now
[2:13:38] it has even gone to another level
[2:13:41] my respect for you has risen even the
[2:13:43] more so
[2:13:45] amen thank you sir
[2:13:47] where he goes
[2:13:49] straight back to that little boy that's
[2:13:50] dying sir do you still believe me that
[2:13:53] if I pray for this little boy that God
[2:13:54] would raise him up
[2:13:56] absolutely brother random
[2:13:58] Heavenly Father
[2:13:59] what now my heart is clean
[2:14:02] no condemnation
[2:14:04] no condemnation what's brother Dwayne
[2:14:06] trying to say listen sir brother Brown
[2:14:07] says
[2:14:08] sometimes this is how we get we're just
[2:14:10] like oh Lord I I feel so ashamed I've
[2:14:13] done this I've fallen again and Lord I
[2:14:15] I'm so ashamed brother Brown makes a
[2:14:17] statement now you take this home and you
[2:14:19] put it right in your top pocket by your
[2:14:20] heart
[2:14:21] he makes a statement
[2:14:25] he said you say brother Branham
[2:14:28] I'd done something the other day
[2:14:30] I'm afraid the Lord won't heal me
[2:14:32] tonight
[2:14:35] oh yes he will
[2:14:37] don't you get scared
[2:14:39] you're a Christian
[2:14:41] just sit still
[2:14:43] now listen close
[2:14:45] repent for what you've done wrong see
[2:14:49] that's right see
[2:14:50] well well I backslid brother he said
[2:14:52] that don't make any difference
[2:14:55] it's powerful Church
[2:14:57] this is meat for your walk
[2:15:00] that don't make any difference repent
[2:15:04] and go on
[2:15:06] he said you're scared
[2:15:08] he said the first little thing comes
[2:15:10] along you you turn your head one and you
[2:15:11] and you think God's Gonna condemn you he
[2:15:14] said repent that's all
[2:15:16] get right
[2:15:19] you know
[2:15:20] oh
[2:15:22] it's okay just to be me isn't it
[2:15:25] you know we're just we're just all
[2:15:26] natural we're you know we all got
[2:15:28] different lineages and we all got
[2:15:29] different backgrounds and you know some
[2:15:31] of us are German and and Germans have
[2:15:33] their own way and you know sometimes we
[2:15:34] get pretty hard-headed and and we get
[2:15:37] things pretty set and you know it's got
[2:15:39] to be my way or it's the highway and and
[2:15:41] you know we we all got our little things
[2:15:43] about us and but the reality is that
[2:15:45] we're all just flesh and blood
[2:15:47] that we're all flesh and blood and we're
[2:15:49] all contending for the faith that was
[2:15:51] once delivered to the Saints
[2:15:54] and we all
[2:15:55] come up short
[2:15:57] and we all make mistakes
[2:15:59] and we all fail and the grace of God and
[2:16:02] the blood covers it all
[2:16:05] I think Lord help me
[2:16:07] because sometimes we find ourselves in
[2:16:08] this position you know it's not like
[2:16:10] it's unusual we just you go back and
[2:16:12] look through the scriptures and you find
[2:16:13] you know great men that God has raised
[2:16:16] up and I'm just reminded of Samson right
[2:16:18] now
[2:16:19] you know here's this great man of God
[2:16:20] and he's he's been raised up to destroy
[2:16:22] a nation
[2:16:24] literally God has raised them up and and
[2:16:27] and and he goes wayward
[2:16:30] he actually notices he actually
[2:16:31] recognizes the power of God on his life
[2:16:33] I mean he walks out in the in the
[2:16:36] battlefield one day and and he kills 600
[2:16:38] Philistines with a with a Jawbone of a
[2:16:41] mule the power of God comes upon him but
[2:16:42] but he's got this weakness in his life
[2:16:45] he's got this weakness in his life and
[2:16:47] and you know what and and then he'd go
[2:16:49] and he'd fall into his trap again and
[2:16:51] listen brother Brown said each one of us
[2:16:53] has a weakness
[2:16:55] well Lord I don't want that weakness no
[2:16:57] brother Brian said this you all have a
[2:16:58] weakness now guard that spot
[2:17:01] put a guard at that spot because we
[2:17:04] listen a prophet of God himself
[2:17:06] being a red-blooded man would hang a
[2:17:08] cross in his car
[2:17:11] off of the mirror
[2:17:12] and some man would make a statement to
[2:17:14] him say brother Bradham isn't that a
[2:17:16] Catholic
[2:17:17] symbol
[2:17:19] and he would look at him and say what
[2:17:21] right does the Catholic have to the
[2:17:23] cross
[2:17:24] the cross is to every born-again Son of
[2:17:26] God the cross is for the children of God
[2:17:28] then he would tell you and me
[2:17:31] when I'm driving down the road and I get
[2:17:33] stopped at an intersection or I'm
[2:17:35] driving along and some half-dressed
[2:17:37] naked woman comes walking out come on
[2:17:39] brothers
[2:17:40] now sisters maybe maybe you don't
[2:17:42] understand this but it'd be good for you
[2:17:43] to understand it because uh you know
[2:17:45] that is a part of a of a of a genetics
[2:17:49] of a man if I could say that without
[2:17:50] going into too much that's part of a
[2:17:52] genetics of a man that is not up to him
[2:17:55] it was there all along that's part of
[2:17:56] the Fall
[2:17:58] the problem is that Satan puts a trap
[2:18:00] out in front of him
[2:18:02] and he does it to the sons of God like
[2:18:04] he does it to the men on the street
[2:18:08] and a prophet would say I have that
[2:18:10] cross hanging there so that when they
[2:18:12] come out the first reaction is to look
[2:18:14] and he says and I immediately look back
[2:18:16] at the cross
[2:18:18] what's he doing he's taking dominion
[2:18:21] over this vessel right here
[2:18:23] because this thing will lead him astray
[2:18:26] this thing is something that he's got to
[2:18:28] contend with on a daily basis he said so
[2:18:30] I look at the cross
[2:18:33] he says and I feel sorry for that woman
[2:18:35] because she doesn't know what kind of
[2:18:36] spirit is on her
[2:18:39] you know he the Lord is so gracious he's
[2:18:41] given us so much to contend with him
[2:18:43] that's why God would come right down and
[2:18:45] begin to speak to you know he began to
[2:18:47] speak to someone we don't have it so
[2:18:48] much amongst the message people but the
[2:18:50] Pentecostal women and say hey you don't
[2:18:52] dress like that
[2:18:54] don't dress uh you know I heard him say
[2:18:56] no I hope I'm not going to step on
[2:18:57] anybody's toes tonight but I heard him
[2:18:59] say the other day I say you know a
[2:19:01] number of years back when we were young
[2:19:02] there was these skirts or dresses or
[2:19:04] whatever they were knit
[2:19:06] you what I mean you pour yourself into
[2:19:08] him
[2:19:10] back
[2:19:11] and I it always bothered me and I I you
[2:19:13] know I thought Lord that's not right
[2:19:15] because
[2:19:16] because those are there's other men well
[2:19:18] I'm still wearing a dress no that's not
[2:19:20] it it's a form-fitted and it would cause
[2:19:22] a man
[2:19:23] in his weakness to think the wrong
[2:19:25] thoughts not because he wants to but
[2:19:27] because the enemy
[2:19:29] would use I'm I'm not now why I'm on
[2:19:32] this right now because the enemy would
[2:19:34] use it
[2:19:35] and it would become a trap to that man
[2:19:38] and he said and then he would remind
[2:19:39] those sisters he said now listen sisters
[2:19:42] God will hold you responsible
[2:19:45] for that man's thoughts
[2:19:48] and you know what the women of today
[2:19:49] would say
[2:19:51] get over it
[2:19:52] grow up
[2:19:54] who what kind of pervert are you
[2:19:56] what kind of sick being I don't know why
[2:19:58] I'm on this right now what kind of a
[2:19:59] sick being are you
[2:20:01] here's the reality
[2:20:04] that men were made the way they are made
[2:20:08] and a woman is made the way she is made
[2:20:11] let me tell you something sis
[2:20:13] if you don't understand your husband
[2:20:15] and he doesn't understand you there's a
[2:20:17] reason for it
[2:20:20] after 36 years she's still a mystery
[2:20:23] I'm only starting to kind of figure it
[2:20:25] out
[2:20:28] you know what she tells me
[2:20:30] honey
[2:20:32] I wish when God took me out of you
[2:20:36] he would have left a little piece of me
[2:20:38] in you
[2:20:39] then you would understand me
[2:20:43] but brother Bob
[2:20:45] he took her
[2:20:47] all out
[2:20:48] and made her a completely different
[2:20:52] individual
[2:20:55] and it's only the love of God that can
[2:20:57] keep you together
[2:20:59] it's only the love because you listen
[2:21:02] let me tell you something what's this
[2:21:05] if you haven't got one already you'll
[2:21:07] get one it'll just be a short little
[2:21:09] time and then Mr Wright you know
[2:21:11] handsome strapping kind of like your dad
[2:21:13] he's just gonna show up you're saying
[2:21:15] not me I'm not gonna bear a man like my
[2:21:16] dad oh yes you will
[2:21:18] when you do remember you'll be reminded
[2:21:20] what brother Dwayne told you yes you
[2:21:21] will
[2:21:23] it's gonna show up and he's going to be
[2:21:25] handsome and you're going to get
[2:21:27] together and you're going to think oh my
[2:21:28] man we just love each other so we're so
[2:21:31] much alike we are so we think alike we
[2:21:34] do the same we're so excited and then
[2:21:35] you get married and guess what
[2:21:37] in three months time you wonder who is
[2:21:39] this man that I married
[2:21:41] who is this guy this isn't the man I'm
[2:21:44] married
[2:21:49] it's God created men different
[2:21:51] and he created women
[2:21:53] different
[2:21:54] now let me just talk to your mom and dad
[2:21:56] for a minute I don't even know why I'm
[2:21:57] on this how did Samson get to this
[2:22:01] because he's a man like you and me
[2:22:03] because he has struggles like you and I
[2:22:06] because listen the very first thing what
[2:22:09] was it I am so far off right now what
[2:22:12] what did what did man fall to in the
[2:22:14] beginning
[2:22:15] the very first thing where did Satan lay
[2:22:19] his trap
[2:22:23] very first sin that was committed
[2:22:25] outside of not believing the word of God
[2:22:28] the manifestation of that was a sexual
[2:22:30] act
[2:22:32] that's the truth
[2:22:35] why do you think
[2:22:37] that everything that you see every sign
[2:22:40] you read every song you listen to
[2:22:43] everywhere as you go every place you
[2:22:46] look why is it every man listen Brothers
[2:22:48] When We Were Young Brothers When We Were
[2:22:50] Young I can't talk about these young
[2:22:51] guys but I can talk about when we were
[2:22:53] young
[2:22:53] brother Dale the magazines that you
[2:22:55] shouldn't have been able to see were
[2:22:56] hidden behind curtains
[2:22:58] now they're placed right here where
[2:23:01] young boys that are six seven eight
[2:23:02] years old they can watch they can look
[2:23:04] right at it as their mom walks through
[2:23:06] the store and pays for the groceries
[2:23:08] it's right there for them to look at
[2:23:10] why is it
[2:23:12] because the very thing that caused the
[2:23:14] fall in the beginning is what Satan is
[2:23:16] trying to use to finish his work
[2:23:19] to destroy man but listen Church there
[2:23:21] is a bride of Christ in this age that is
[2:23:23] not going to fall to that she's going to
[2:23:25] rise up that was a that was a natural
[2:23:27] type of something spiritual
[2:23:30] and there was a there's also a spiritual
[2:23:32] adultery that was going to be committed
[2:23:34] but the Bride of this age is going to
[2:23:36] stand in the middle of Satan's Eden and
[2:23:39] she's going to be able to look straight
[2:23:41] at every vile and filthy thing and God
[2:23:44] is going to hold the holy veil in front
[2:23:46] of her and she'll be able to look and
[2:23:47] turn her head and look and turn her head
[2:23:49] and when she does look too wrong she's
[2:23:52] too long she will he will immediately go
[2:23:54] back and say father forgive me I didn't
[2:23:56] mean to do that Lord You Know My Heart
[2:23:58] Lord give me Grace give me listen mama
[2:24:01] you ought to I'll say I don't even know
[2:24:02] where I'm at tonight but you ought to be
[2:24:04] praying for your husband from the time
[2:24:06] he leaves home in the morning and when
[2:24:08] he gets back home at night you ought to
[2:24:10] have the table spread you ought to have
[2:24:12] the the nicest dress on and and the
[2:24:15] sweetest smelling perfume he likes and
[2:24:17] you ought to be there to embrace him and
[2:24:19] say honey I am so glad you're home you
[2:24:22] ought to make home such a sanctuary that
[2:24:24] where that he wants to come home at the
[2:24:26] end of the day
[2:24:27] I honestly I know Brothers precious
[2:24:30] Brothers Precious Precious Brothers ah
[2:24:33] man I'm so far off my notes Lord what am
[2:24:35] I doing right now brothers that
[2:24:37] literally
[2:24:39] wonderful men Godly men Godly wives you
[2:24:43] know what they could never I know homes
[2:24:45] that have been totally blown apart
[2:24:47] because a wife refused to acknowledge
[2:24:49] that her husband didn't think the way
[2:24:50] she did or that a man would refuse to
[2:24:52] think that her husband or what his wife
[2:24:54] would think different no she just thinks
[2:24:56] the same as I do no she does not
[2:24:58] Brothers
[2:24:59] let me take it from you tell you she
[2:25:01] does not think the way you do
[2:25:03] and neither does he think the way you do
[2:25:05] sis
[2:25:06] it's completely different and that's why
[2:25:09] the Bible would say learn to uh live
[2:25:12] with them according to the knowledge
[2:25:15] of Grace
[2:25:21] I'm so far off my topic right now
[2:25:24] listen
[2:25:25] Brothers you go
[2:25:26] brother Bob you told me a little bit
[2:25:28] about what you did
[2:25:30] but you didn't just come out of school
[2:25:32] do that
[2:25:34] and when you got the job you didn't know
[2:25:36] everything
[2:25:39] you studied it and studied it and
[2:25:40] learned and studied learned and studied
[2:25:42] any anybody that's good at what they
[2:25:43] does but they they they go through and
[2:25:46] they learn and they study and whether
[2:25:47] they're trying to grow and they're
[2:25:48] trying to understand more
[2:25:51] so why is it that when we get back to
[2:25:52] our our hometown right
[2:25:54] to our own people our wives and our
[2:25:57] husbands
[2:25:59] we don't do the same thing we just
[2:26:00] expect
[2:26:01] brother Dwayne are you listening right
[2:26:03] now
[2:26:05] we just expect them
[2:26:08] just expect her to understand what I
[2:26:10] mean why didn't you just say what you
[2:26:12] mean I did well no I didn't hear it that
[2:26:14] way
[2:26:15] well I did say what I meant
[2:26:18] well honey why don't you just say what
[2:26:19] you mean I did tell you that no you
[2:26:21] didn't you told me this no no honey I
[2:26:24] told you this well I didn't hear that
[2:26:27] what's Satan trying to do
[2:26:37] the spirit said dad has got to contend
[2:26:39] with when he walks out the door
[2:26:43] it's almost too much
[2:26:46] for a mortal man
[2:26:50] you maybe don't understand this but this
[2:26:52] is truth it's almost too much for a
[2:26:53] mortal man
[2:26:55] that's what brother Adam says when he
[2:26:57] gets home
[2:26:58] make sure that you know you're you're
[2:27:00] not still in your host coat from this
[2:27:02] morning and just make sure the house is
[2:27:04] clean make sure make sure the meal is
[2:27:05] right I thought you're looking at your
[2:27:07] mom some of you got all these kids and
[2:27:08] my wife had four too and I know what
[2:27:10] it's like and it
[2:27:12] and Dad

[2:27:21] you take care of the kids for a week and
[2:27:23] see how you do

[2:27:27] you would have less hair than you have
[2:27:29] right now if you had to take care of
[2:27:31] your kids for a week
[2:27:32] you know it and so do I well I don't
[2:27:35] know about your kids but I know my kids
[2:27:39] I don't think I could handle it
[2:27:41] we got the most
[2:27:46] I'm talking about I'm talking about
[2:27:48] character I'm not talking just about
[2:27:49] looks I'm taught we got the most
[2:27:51] beautiful women on the face of the Earth
[2:27:54] girls
[2:27:56] don't you belittle yourselves by
[2:27:57] allowing some man from out there
[2:28:00] somewheres
[2:28:01] to convince you you're cute and you're
[2:28:02] pretty and that you ought to marry him
[2:28:04] or you ought to hang out with him don't
[2:28:05] you don't you go there
[2:28:08] don't you go there
[2:28:10] you just give it to the Lord
[2:28:12] say Lord where's the at
[2:28:15] send them to me Lord show them show me a
[2:28:18] quizzy
[2:28:19] I I've seen I've seen girls leave oh I
[2:28:22] am so far off my nose Lord what AM where
[2:28:24] am I
[2:28:25] I've seen girls leave home
[2:28:28] because home life they didn't like home
[2:28:30] life so they found somebody that made
[2:28:32] them feel good and
[2:28:33] decided that would be a good life to
[2:28:35] live and find out a year later they're
[2:28:36] living in hell
[2:28:40] don't jump
[2:28:43] can I go back to my notes I don't know
[2:28:44] how I got away here
[2:28:46] but I did
[2:28:51] we're talking about backsliding and I
[2:28:52] don't know how that happened but we were
[2:28:54] there anyhow
[2:28:57] brother Brown would make a statement
[2:28:59] like this he said what are you afraid of
[2:29:01] what are you afraid of he said the very
[2:29:03] thoughts
[2:29:04] of people is so scared now we're talking
[2:29:07] about taking God at his word Caleb's
[2:29:09] portion I'm sorry I got distracted there
[2:29:11] no I'm not I take that back I'm not
[2:29:13] sorry I I the brothers that at home give
[2:29:16] me give me a they give me a lecture
[2:29:18] every time I say that so I'm just going
[2:29:20] to take it back and they say just leave
[2:29:21] that alone when God does that he's doing
[2:29:22] that for a purpose so the very thoughts
[2:29:25] of people is scared oh brother Brown and
[2:29:27] the doctor told me I just can't get well
[2:29:31] there's an atonement
[2:29:33] laying Yonder for you
[2:29:36] sure well brother Branham I've done so
[2:29:38] much sins
[2:29:42] there's an atonement
[2:29:45] waiting for you
[2:29:46] there's someone who loves you
[2:29:49] don't be scared
[2:29:51] the constant words of Jesus are fear not
[2:29:55] I'm he that was dead is alive again and
[2:29:57] Alive forevermore fear not
[2:30:00] listen get that atmosphere
[2:30:03] around you
[2:30:05] know I believe that's that that's why we
[2:30:07] worship right
[2:30:08] that's why the musicians come up here
[2:30:10] and they begin to play ahead of time
[2:30:12] they begin to set an atmosphere but the
[2:30:14] Bob comes up here he begins to all that
[2:30:17] he's filled up with the gift that's in
[2:30:18] him it begins to pour out
[2:30:20] what's it doing it's creating an
[2:30:22] atmosphere and then the worshipers arise
[2:30:25] they enter in and they begin to pour out
[2:30:27] their heart what are they doing pouring
[2:30:29] out what are they doing sweet smelling
[2:30:31] Savor unto the Lord
[2:30:32] and then what does Father do he's got a
[2:30:34] big smile on his face and say wait what
[2:30:36] do you want son what do you want
[2:30:37] what do you want
[2:30:40] you know Brothers said he's not come to
[2:30:41] bring us fear and failure right
[2:30:43] he's not come to bring us fear and
[2:30:45] failure so let me go back to Jabez I I
[2:30:48] got so sidetracked there you know Jabez
[2:30:50] chapter 10 uh in first Chronicles not
[2:30:52] chapter 10 chapter 4 verse 10 I think it
[2:30:55] is in first Chronicles uh and the next
[2:30:58] part he says and enlarge my Coast
[2:31:01] now here's a young man
[2:31:02] again here's a young man that you know a
[2:31:05] Son of God that that that has recognized
[2:31:08] hey I've got a portion I'm a Son of God
[2:31:11] and I've got a portion and and the word
[2:31:13] says ask so I'm asking Lord
[2:31:15] and I I love this I love his Zeal this
[2:31:18] young man Zeal you know he kind of
[2:31:20] reminds me a little bit like Peter here
[2:31:21] he is and and this young man and he says
[2:31:24] now Lord Lord I know that you've
[2:31:26] allotted me this much
[2:31:28] I I know that I've got that this is my
[2:31:30] portion but but Lord enlarge it
[2:31:33] enlarge it I want more
[2:31:35] Lord You're a god of yeah you you know
[2:31:38] you said that the bank of Heaven is is
[2:31:40] never empty and and I as a Son of God I
[2:31:43] I have the ability to take your credit
[2:31:45] card and just swipe it whenever I need
[2:31:46] it Lord all my needs supplied isn't that
[2:31:49] what he said I'll take care of all your
[2:31:51] needs Brothers you're right your witness
[2:31:53] is just like I'm a witness how many
[2:31:55] times have we got to that place and yeah
[2:31:57] you know we got to a place I remember in
[2:31:59] my own life you know I told you my
[2:32:02] animals when they went down and I got to
[2:32:03] a place I didn't know how I was going to
[2:32:04] make my land payments and I how I mean I
[2:32:07] was just down in a bad Strait and of
[2:32:09] course we don't We're Men we don't talk
[2:32:10] about these kind of things you know
[2:32:12] that's one of those things we don't talk
[2:32:13] about and and so I'm praying and asking
[2:32:15] the Lord and I'm you know the payment
[2:32:17] date is coming closer and I don't I
[2:32:19] don't even make enough money hardly to
[2:32:20] put food on the table and I'm thinking
[2:32:22] Lord how am I going to come up with four
[2:32:24] thousand extra dollars I don't even have
[2:32:25] money for my own family
[2:32:27] praying I'm praying and one day I get a
[2:32:30] little knock on my door
[2:32:31] my brother that I mean I know him I love
[2:32:34] him and we've been friends but we lived
[2:32:36] out in the boonies not too many people
[2:32:37] came to visit us out there and all of a
[2:32:40] sudden there's a knock on my door in the
[2:32:41] evening here's his brother and his
[2:32:42] sister standing there and I'm like Oh

[2:33:03] word of prayer and we begin to pray and
[2:33:04] when you know when we get done praying
[2:33:06] he he gets up to leave when he takes an
[2:33:08] envelope with his pocket and he sets it
[2:33:10] down on my coffee table and I looked up
[2:33:11] and said oh no brother no no I didn't
[2:33:13] know what was in the envelope but I
[2:33:14] thought it may be a little bit of money

[2:33:17] no no thank you I appreciate it God
[2:33:19] bless you you know God is my portion he
[2:33:22] looked me in the face and he said
[2:33:22] brother Dwayne
[2:33:24] he said before I left home God told me
[2:33:26] to leave this envelope here
[2:33:28] he said it's staying right here what you
[2:33:31] do with it is up to you but God left us
[2:33:33] and I'm told to leave this envelope here

[2:33:51] my payment was maybe four thousand and
[2:33:53] seventy dollars it was four thousand

[2:38:01] me but Lord bless me lots

[2:38:05] I I don't know about you but that's how
[2:38:07] I feel Lord I don't want just a little
[2:38:09] bit of this Holy Ghost Gospel I Want It
[2:38:11] All Lord I want lots of it I want I want
[2:38:14] the Holy Ghost and Fire to keep me alive
[2:38:16] I don't want to burn out down the road I

[2:38:21] the what the the original Pentecostals

[2:38:27] this Bride Can Have I want my new body I
[2:38:30] want the New Jerusalem I want it all
[2:38:33] sound like a spoiled kid now you see
[2:38:35] Satan's copy of today
[2:38:37] now you see Satan's copy of today where
[2:38:39] kids think they just deserve everything
[2:38:41] just because I'm your kid
[2:38:43] well that is there's a reality that
[2:38:44] we're sons of God and we do deserve
[2:38:47] everything
[2:38:48] not that we deserve it but he said he
[2:38:50] give it to us because we're part of him
[2:38:52] but he'll give it the right way
[2:38:55] when your character can handle it
[2:38:58] Hallelujah look at this and that's your
[2:39:00] hand might be with me
[2:39:04] and that your hand might wait hold on
[2:39:06] Lord enlarge my Coast
[2:39:07] and just let me know that you're here
[2:39:09] that you've never left me that you
[2:39:11] haven't forsaken me Lord Lord and
[2:39:13] whatever I'm putting my hands Lord I
[2:39:14] want you to bless it but let me know
[2:39:16] that you're in it
[2:39:19] let me know you're in it
[2:39:21] because many times we can jump into
[2:39:23] things just in our flesh and find out
[2:39:24] you know what he wasn't in it at all
[2:39:27] cost us a whole lot
[2:39:29] ended up costing us years of our life
[2:39:31] because we jumped into something that we
[2:39:33] thought was a good thing
[2:39:34] without praying
[2:39:38] Hallelujah
[2:39:40] I like this last little part
[2:39:43] that thou words keep me
[2:39:45] from evil
[2:39:48] that thou woulds what a request
[2:39:52] what a request
[2:39:54] that thou wouldst keep me
[2:39:56] from evil
[2:39:58] well Lord what do you mean
[2:40:01] Japan's what are you saying
[2:40:04] telling you Brothers
[2:40:06] that this is hell
[2:40:09] Satan's Eden
[2:40:11] and the gate has been pulled off hell
[2:40:14] and every filthy vowel evil spirit has
[2:40:19] been loosed
[2:40:22] it just so happens that you're the
[2:40:24] target
[2:40:25] you're the target
[2:40:27] and here's Jabez before the blood of the
[2:40:30] Lamb
[2:40:31] is saying
[2:40:33] Lord keep me
[2:40:34] Keep Me From Evil there's gonna be a lot
[2:40:36] of Temptations I'm gonna be I'm gonna be
[2:40:38] enticed in a lot of different areas of
[2:40:39] my life there's going to be times that
[2:40:41] I'm attempted in business there's gonna
[2:40:42] be times I'm gonna be tempted in my
[2:40:44] marriage there's going to be times that
[2:40:45] I'm going to be tempted to do this and
[2:40:46] tempted to do that Lord Lord keep me
[2:40:48] from the evil that's surrounding me
[2:40:51] isn't that exactly what he wants to do
[2:40:53] isn't that exactly what he wants to do
[2:40:55] keep you from evil
[2:40:56] I believe that was on my heart
[2:40:59] I believe it'd be a good thing for us to
[2:41:01] just pray this way sometimes
[2:41:03] remind the Lord
[2:41:05] I'm heading out Mama
[2:41:07] pray for your husband when he walks out
[2:41:09] the door
[2:41:10] father keep them
[2:41:12] keep them from those spirits that are
[2:41:13] out there because that's what they are
[2:41:15] spirits
[2:41:17] keep them from those spirits
[2:41:20] Our Father
[2:41:22] which heart in heaven
[2:41:24] Hallowed be thy name
[2:41:27] thy kingdom come
[2:41:30] thy will be done

[2:41:38] but in Earth
[2:41:41] as it is in heaven
[2:41:46] what does the rest say
[2:41:48] and God granted him
[2:41:51] that which he requested
[2:41:55] as a Son of God he wasn't afraid to ask
[2:41:58] as a daughter God you don't have to be
[2:42:01] afraid to ask

[2:42:07] burdens and I'll carry them for you just

[2:42:11] well brother Dwayne but I
[2:42:14] I
[2:42:16] feel like I'm lacking faith
[2:42:19] then should we ask for faith
[2:42:22] should we not be asking for faith
[2:42:25] Lord you promised me the faith
[2:42:27] you didn't promise me a faith you
[2:42:29] promised me the faith
[2:42:31] and you told me Lord that the faith of a
[2:42:34] mustard seed
[2:42:35] if I had the faith of a mustard seed
[2:42:38] the smallest of all the seeds of the
[2:42:40] earth if I had that faith you say well
[2:42:43] brother Dwayne you're saying if I had
[2:42:44] that Faith you have that faith
[2:42:46] that small little seed if it would just
[2:42:48] let if you'll just let it Bloom if
[2:42:50] you'll just let it grow
[2:42:52] watch what it'll become
[2:42:54] and become a great tree
[2:42:56] watch watch what it'll produce in your
[2:42:58] life
[2:42:59] just keep watering
[2:43:01] it by the word of God
[2:43:06] Hallelujah
[2:43:12] in closing if the musicians would come
[2:43:17] around speaks this they told me
[2:43:25] says they told me the same thing you're
[2:43:27] sure he says I worked 17 years till God
[2:43:30] got me out
[2:43:32] and built me around this he's talking
[2:43:33] about his ministry let me just back up
[2:43:34] he says some of you preachers now that's
[2:43:37] that's too scared to take your stand
[2:43:39] afraid they won't let you come in into
[2:43:41] the organized organization he says what
[2:43:44] else are you going to do to them what
[2:43:46] else are you going to do then they kick
[2:43:48] you out he says I feel sorry for you
[2:43:50] first sing your weakness that's right
[2:43:52] now brother let me just say this he said
[2:43:53] where's your faith in God
[2:43:56] they told me the same thing sure worked
[2:43:58] 17 years to God until God got me out and
[2:44:01] built me around this and I thought now
[2:44:04] Satan you come now
[2:44:06] see where it's at when you really
[2:44:09] realize that God has revealed to you the
[2:44:12] truth
[2:44:13] of the thing there's nothing in the
[2:44:16] world that's going to defeat you in it
[2:44:21] that's all you're absolutely
[2:44:23] undefeatable
[2:44:25] absolutely undefeatable
[2:44:28] but he says not you
[2:44:31] but God that's in you but God that's in
[2:44:34] you he says not the body but the word
[2:44:37] that was in him not Mary but the word
[2:44:40] that was born in her
[2:44:44] what was Mary
[2:44:46] can I say this
[2:44:48] I believe Mary got her portion
[2:44:50] because she said be it unto me
[2:44:53] when the angel spoke to her said be it
[2:44:55] unto me according to Thy word she got
[2:44:57] her portion
[2:44:59] she got to bring forth the very the the
[2:45:01] very life of the Living God

[2:46:15] you tonight
[2:46:16] are you convinced that what you've been
[2:46:18] asking the Lord for is on its way

[2:46:23] that it's on its way
[2:46:24] listen sometimes we're we we do the same
[2:46:27] thing in our prayer life we we put in
[2:46:29] our order so to speak God's not just an
[2:46:31] order taker by the way
[2:46:33] God wants to be loved and he wants to be
[2:46:36] adored he wants to be Fellowship he
[2:46:38] wants to sit down at the table and he
[2:46:40] wants to love you and and talk it over
[2:46:42] with you and he wants to tell you how

[2:48:39] needed their portion filled and just
[2:48:41] just my Ministry and song Just My just
[2:48:44] the spirit of God singing forth from me
[2:48:46] would be enough to fill their cup
[2:48:49] now when the word come it would just
[2:48:50] overflow their being and they would just
[2:48:52] say Lord I I'm going I'm so full I'm
