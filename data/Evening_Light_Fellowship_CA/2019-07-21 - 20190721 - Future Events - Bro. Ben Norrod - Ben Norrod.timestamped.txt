[1:08:01] III enjoy preachers that know how to

[1:08:10] Spirit of the Lord just gets so good I
[1:08:12] can't hold still and I'm thankful for

[1:08:26] usually you know it's about a two and a
[1:08:28] half hour time difference for us and
[1:08:30] then coming from the field coming in and
[1:08:32] then usually takes a couple days to kind
[1:08:34] of get adjusted and all of that and so
[1:08:36] we're today's the first day I kind of
[1:08:39] felt normal a little bit as far as that
[1:08:40] goes now it's time to go home maybe
[1:08:42] that's not the way it goes so I
[1:08:43] appreciate your prayers and we
[1:08:45] appreciate the Lord allowing us to be
[1:08:47] able to come this way as always we'll
[1:08:49] say thank you to brother Gerald and amen
[1:08:51] the church body for allowing us to come
[1:08:53] by and for all of your kindness to us
[1:08:55] and your hospitality it means the world
[1:08:57] to Samantha and I and this is our last
[1:09:01] meeting before you go back to school and
[1:09:03] she gets a little bit of a break in
[1:09:05] August yeah tear that's for sure and
[1:09:07] she's my buddy we travel all over the
[1:09:10] place together and I like her being here
[1:09:12] to do this
[1:09:13] singing part you'd be surprised
[1:09:14] sometimes we go into a church and you
[1:09:17] know just me coming up and preaching it
[1:09:19] might be a blessing to some people some
[1:09:21] people you not so sure what it is you
[1:09:23] know whether you did good or not but you
[1:09:25] know I've found that a lot of times with
[1:09:28] the singing a lot of times you know if
[1:09:29] we take a couple songs sing a few songs
[1:09:31] something like that
[1:09:32] the Holy Spirit seems to kind of break
[1:09:34] up all that ground and then we've been
[1:09:36] able to dig right in there and do some
[1:09:38] preaching so I want to say this you know
[1:09:41] with us doing our singing part it's not
[1:09:44] that we don't enjoy everything that
[1:09:46] y'all do here we Sam and I we love to
[1:09:48] hear you folks saying I love to get in
[1:09:50] that back room and just it's like one
[1:09:51] big choir you know just this I just love
[1:09:54] to hear it and I love the music I love
[1:09:56] all the plan and everything like that
[1:09:58] and so we we we do this part as a
[1:10:01] blessing to you not to break up ground
[1:10:03] not to get you ready you're already
[1:10:05] ready hey man I I know that you were
[1:10:07] ready when we come in and so we we just
[1:10:09] like to do this for the glory of God and
[1:10:12] to be a blessing to people and sir trust
[1:10:15] that you'll continue praying for us in
[1:10:17] the ministry got a couple of things
[1:10:19] coming overseas not exactly sure how
[1:10:21] it's all going to work out the Lord
[1:10:23] spoke to me about all the turn of the
[1:10:25] year that there be about three places
[1:10:27] that I need to try to get to this year
[1:10:29] and I've been to one it was in Africa
[1:10:31] February that's where I met brother
[1:10:32] Isaac I was telling about last night and
[1:10:35] and as he sent his greetings to the
[1:10:38] church and met him I go to brother Sam
[1:10:41] sent a when I get to Ghana there if you
[1:10:43] know brother Sampson oh he's a fine
[1:10:45] brother and he's a wonderful host and we
[1:10:48] go into that place and he takes us all
[1:10:49] over the country a lot of times you'll
[1:10:51] preach many many services in a row this
[1:10:53] year we went and just in the convention
[1:10:56] and there were pastors that come in and
[1:10:58] I like that when they come in like that
[1:10:59] in one spot you can just preach it to
[1:11:01] them and then they take it out to those
[1:11:03] countries like that and it's a whole lot
[1:11:05] easier trying to make the travel you
[1:11:07] know so there's a couple places land
[1:11:09] before us where they are at right this
[1:11:12] point right now I couldn't tell you what
[1:11:14] it's going to be but I feel like somehow
[1:11:16] the Lord has got a couple spots for us
[1:11:19] coming in the mission field so I want
[1:11:21] you to be praying about that if you will
[1:11:22] for our behalf and for the saints of God
[1:11:25] that you know whatever it is the Lord
[1:11:26] have for us we want to be ready when the
[1:11:28] time comes to be able to go I kind of
[1:11:30] got an idea about where they may be but
[1:11:32] I'm just kind of waiting for things to
[1:11:34] fall in place because one thing's for
[1:11:36] sure when it comes to supporting
[1:11:38] missionary work or doing missionary work
[1:11:39] or being involved in missionary work one
[1:11:42] thing is you can't just jump into it you
[1:11:43] got to know who it is you're dealing
[1:11:45] with you know who it is you're talking
[1:11:46] to because you can have somebody invite
[1:11:48] you to come over and preach and they got
[1:11:49] one little Hut in the middle of nowhere
[1:11:51] then got Internet or running water and
[1:11:53] then like at but they got Facebook I'll
[1:11:55] never understand that how that works you
[1:11:57] know everybody got a cell phone they
[1:11:59] don't have electricity but they got a
[1:12:00] cell phone and so they make connections
[1:12:02] sometimes and you really got to know who
[1:12:04] it is that you're dealing with for you
[1:12:06] go into them places and so I like to
[1:12:08] make sure that my contacts are solid and
[1:12:11] the people that I'm working with and I'm
[1:12:12] dealing with have got Solid Works and
[1:12:14] have been established and what they're
[1:12:16] doing you know is something for the
[1:12:17] kingdom of God and not just to bring
[1:12:20] somebody over they kindly attach
[1:12:21] themself to your name and it might make
[1:12:23] them look like they're credible when
[1:12:25] they're really not
[1:12:25] so there's a lot involved and then on
[1:12:28] top of that you get to bugs and the
[1:12:29] waters and all those other kind of
[1:12:30] things and the foods that you got to
[1:12:32] deal with so you be in prayer force if
[1:12:34] you will as we ask you every year always
[1:12:36] keep us in prayer and of course our
[1:12:38] ministry as we go around the country and
[1:12:40] North America and I somebody said to me
[1:12:42] the other day they said you're Canadian
[1:12:44] aren't you I said I spend enough time in
[1:12:46] Canada I probably ought to be here hey
[1:12:48] man I preached a lot in Canada so we got
[1:12:51] a meeting coming in Ottawa here just a
[1:12:53] little while then back into Toronto and
[1:12:54] the different places in the provinces
[1:12:56] and so we just covet your prayers
[1:12:58] because you know I go 365 days a year
[1:13:02] 16 years full time like this on the road
[1:13:06] nearly 300 days out of the year as I
[1:13:08] told you the other night you know we've
[1:13:09] gone almost 2,000 miles in just the last
[1:13:11] couple weeks traveling and preaching
[1:13:14] different places and all of that and so
[1:13:16] this is not only our livelihood but this
[1:13:18] is our life this is what we do for the
[1:13:20] kingdom of God and somebody asked me how
[1:13:22] in the world do you do it I said because
[1:13:24] there's people everywhere I ask them
[1:13:26] pray pray pray pray pray and I know
[1:13:29] that's the reason we're able to make it
[1:13:31] through it and then one little tiny
[1:13:33] favor I'd like to ask of you we all help
[1:13:36] me pray I can get through this doctorate
[1:13:37] stuff this doctoral thing
[1:13:39] I've been in a battle with it and I just
[1:13:41] got over a major major major hurdle but
[1:13:44] the fight ain't over yet will you just
[1:13:46] pray the Lord help me get through this
[1:13:47] hey man I appreciate it I as I told you
[1:13:50] the Lord led me to do it when I first
[1:13:53] finished my first degree back in 2010 I
[1:13:55] said to the Lord well you wanted me to
[1:13:56] do this now what amen and he come to me
[1:13:59] again and he said keep going so I did I
[1:14:01] finished my master's degree in 2012 and
[1:14:04] then I said okay you want me to do this
[1:14:05] now what he said keep going so here we
[1:14:07] are seven years after that and you know
[1:14:10] I just don't know what all it means
[1:14:12] somebody asked me what am I gonna do
[1:14:14] with it I said I have absolutely no idea
[1:14:17] all I know is the Lord said do it so
[1:14:19] that's what I'm doing I'm just being
[1:14:20] obedient amen and I don't know maybe
[1:14:23] it's just because I needed to be smarter
[1:14:24] I don't know you know I ain't got no
[1:14:26] idea but anyhow we're just gonna trust
[1:14:29] the Lord in them things and so I just

[1:27:38] a little concerned I I don't like to

[1:27:45] occasion and I I hate to rush it and try
[1:27:47] to cut it off and chop it out and I

[1:28:00] to speak to you this morning on future
[1:28:01] events future events amen and by the
[1:28:06] help of the Lord I want to try to cover
[1:28:07] everything that is laying for us in the
[1:28:09] future is the body of Christ a man I
[1:28:12] believe we got a great future ahead of
[1:28:14] us don't you a man I got several places
[1:28:18] I want to look at in the Bible so make
[1:28:19] sure you keep your Bible real close to
[1:28:21] you and you that take notes and I've
[1:28:23] noticed you've been marking things down
[1:28:25] which i think is lovely I like to see
[1:28:28] that amen
[1:28:29] and I'm gonna give you a lot of
[1:28:30] scriptures to write down this morning
[1:28:31] won't be able to read everything of
[1:28:33] course because if I did that we would be
[1:28:35] here a half the day and and I know we
[1:28:38] got chicken at mark so every what's
[1:28:40] coming on in a little bit and I don't
[1:28:41] want people to be too tired where they
[1:28:43] can't fellowship either that's part of
[1:28:45] the weekend and we're gonna get down
[1:28:47] there and do some eatin and playing and
[1:28:49] pickin and grinnin as we say down south
[1:28:50] and and we enjoy that part as well and
[1:28:53] and sure look forward to the fellowship
[1:28:56] this
[1:28:56] afternoon haven't had too much
[1:28:58] fellowship with you folks this weekend
[1:28:59] as you know I just been trying to go
[1:29:00] back and forth but I look forward to
[1:29:03] getting a chance to talk with you a
[1:29:04] little while all right 1st Thessalonians
[1:29:06] chapter 4 verse 15 now trust you're not
[1:29:09] no hurry this morning that you're just
[1:29:11] ready to settle into the Word of God a
[1:29:13] man for sessile ins 4:15 for this we say
[1:29:16] unto you by the word of the Lord that we
[1:29:19] which are alive and remain unto the
[1:29:22] coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:29:23] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:29:27] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[1:29:29] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[1:29:31] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[1:29:33] in Christ shall rise first now notice
[1:29:37] the order the resurrection then we which
[1:29:40] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:29:42] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:29:45] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[1:29:48] be with the Lord wherefore comfort one
[1:29:51] another with these words you notice in
[1:29:53] verse 17 that the clouds is the same
[1:29:56] reference as it was in the book of Acts
[1:29:59] when Jesus is ascending in acts 1 a
[1:30:01] cloud grabs him and receives the amount
[1:30:04] of his side so you notice when the Bible
[1:30:06] said we will be caught together with
[1:30:08] them notice it was being caught in the
[1:30:11] clouds or in the cloud is where we'll be
[1:30:14] caught together so there'll be a
[1:30:16] spiritual parallel of that that will
[1:30:18] take place with the coming of the white
[1:30:20] wig 1 the great authority Jesus Christ
[1:30:23] in the form of the cloud we will be
[1:30:25] caught up in that revelation and then
[1:30:27] that revelation will catch all of us
[1:30:29] Paul and everybody up into the clouds
[1:30:32] eventually down the road now that is the
[1:30:34] rapture as brother brems says here in
[1:30:37] things that are to be he said now we
[1:30:39] know there's going to be a rapture that
[1:30:41] is in the future to be lets pray over
[1:30:44] the Word of God Lord Jesus we thank you
[1:30:46] this morning for the opportunity Lord to
[1:30:48] come into your house father we feel
[1:30:51] sobered by the things that you've done
[1:30:53] for us and our hearts are just mellowed

[1:31:11] it down for us this morning and I trust
[1:31:13] Lord that you'll give us revelation and
[1:31:15] understanding and that you'll allow me
[1:31:17] to get out of the way Lord that I can be
[1:31:19] used of you bless the people now open
[1:31:21] their hearts that they might receive and
[1:31:23] give us strength and the ability Lord to
[1:31:25] dive into this this morning that you can

[1:31:29] minister to us the things you'd want us
[1:31:31] to hear and to know and we love you and
[1:31:33] we thank you for this weekend of
[1:31:35] services we thank you for the little

[1:31:57] sister Betty and the Deacons trustees

[1:32:02] just bless us all as we thank you love
[1:32:04] you and appreciate you for all things in
[1:32:06] Jesus Christ's name a man and a man you
[1:32:12] all know your part you done missed it a
[1:32:14] man eyes all right now you may be seated
[1:32:17] that was that was that was all right too
[1:32:19] little shaky I'll let you make up for a
[1:32:20] little bit later a man a man I'm glad
[1:32:25] y'all like to laugh I'd be in trouble up
[1:32:27] here if you didn't hey man hey man now I
[1:32:30] want to just take for just a little
[1:32:31] while and I want to try to give you an
[1:32:33] outline of what the future is going to
[1:32:35] look like for us as the children of God
[1:32:37] one thing that we have to realize is
[1:32:39] that with the restoration of the message
[1:32:42] of the hour and with the restoration
[1:32:44] work at brother Branham did there is a
[1:32:46] belief among the Bride of Christ that
[1:32:50] all things would be restored to get us
[1:32:53] ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:54] but yet we know at the same time it is
[1:32:57] not only the coming of the Lord that we
[1:32:59] are under expectation for there are many
[1:33:01] future events that are laying ahead of
[1:33:03] us as the children of God that if we
[1:33:06] could kind of tap into the understanding
[1:33:08] of it I believe that it would maybe
[1:33:11] excite our hope and excite our
[1:33:13] expectation of what lays beyond this
[1:33:16] life today because if you're anything
[1:33:18] like me I don't like to look at things
[1:33:20] just as they are today but when
[1:33:23] I'd like to do something a project
[1:33:24] everyone I'm trying to tackle I like to
[1:33:26] see everything that lays out ahead of me
[1:33:28] that's what excites me when I see the
[1:33:30] goals and I see how it's going to help
[1:33:32] somebody or how it's gonna benefit down
[1:33:34] the road that's the motivation that I
[1:33:36] have to keep going with whether we'll
[1:33:38] thing I try to put my mind to and I
[1:33:40] believe spiritually it's the same way I
[1:33:41] believe it's a child of God I believe
[1:33:43] that when we look into the Word of God
[1:33:45] and we see what is laying ahead of us
[1:33:47] that it kindly gets our mind as it were
[1:33:50] this morning off of today and off of the
[1:33:52] events around us and life as we know it
[1:33:54] and it helps us to kind of shut away and
[1:33:57] get ourself in a position where that we
[1:34:00] can have a hope and an expectancy for
[1:34:02] what lays ahead of us because one thing
[1:34:05] is evidently clear to every Bible reader
[1:34:07] if you believe the Bible and you believe
[1:34:09] what's to happen in this last day and
[1:34:11] what's been spoken in this last day one
[1:34:13] thing is abundantly clear and
[1:34:15] transparent to every child of God and
[1:34:17] that is that life as we know it today
[1:34:20] this is not the end of what we had
[1:34:22] Noah's Christian is is Christian people
[1:34:24] Christianity and the life we live today
[1:34:27] this is not the end of it there is so
[1:34:29] much more laying ahead of us as the
[1:34:31] children of God that if we could just
[1:34:33] kind of sink our teeth into that
[1:34:35] revelation we would understand that this
[1:34:37] is only a blip on the radar as they say
[1:34:39] this is only a little spot in time that
[1:34:43] a little parenthesis if you will in time
[1:34:45] that we were just going to experience
[1:34:47] here for maybe 30 or 40 or 90 years or
[1:34:49] ever how long the Lord lets us live and
[1:34:51] then after all of this is wrapped up
[1:34:53] there's going to be tens of millions of
[1:34:55] millions of years beyond us of this part
[1:34:58] of this little parenthesis of life us
[1:35:00] and that 10 millions of millions of
[1:35:02] years is going to be so much more vast
[1:35:04] and so much greater than what we're
[1:35:06] living here today I mean when you think
[1:35:08] about it what is a 40 year old lifetime
[1:35:10] or an 80 year old lifetime compared to
[1:35:12] the first 10,000 years it will spin what
[1:35:15] is a 90 year old lifetime compared to
[1:35:17] the thousand-year millennium that lays
[1:35:19] ahead of us so what I believe it does
[1:35:20] brother Marcus I believe it gives us an
[1:35:22] expectancy and a hope for the things
[1:35:25] that lays out ahead of us now I want to
[1:35:28] just lay out for you the future events
[1:35:30] in the order of how they're supposed to
[1:35:32] occur now you that are writing things
[1:35:33] down this is a good time to ride so that
[1:35:35] you can study this later
[1:35:36] first of all we know that there's got to
[1:35:39] be a couple things happen in the lady of
[1:35:41] sin Church age and we know that in the
[1:35:43] late eocene church age that first of all
[1:35:45] God has to send elijah the prophet
[1:35:47] that's Malachi for then when God sends
[1:35:50] Elijah he has two missions that is to
[1:35:52] restore all of the truths that was hid
[1:35:55] down through the Bible or the lost down
[1:35:57] through the Bible down through the
[1:35:58] church ages and I'll restore all of
[1:36:00] those mysteries and things that Paul
[1:36:02] talked about and then take those
[1:36:04] mysteries that have been hidden and
[1:36:06] revealed them to the elect of the last
[1:36:08] day now when it comes to salvation I'll
[1:36:11] just put this in real quickly a lot of
[1:36:12] people seem to think that in order to be
[1:36:14] saved you got to come to the message
[1:36:15] that ain't true
[1:36:16] to be saved you have to know Jesus
[1:36:18] Christ and him crucified
[1:36:20] anybody could be saved but when you're
[1:36:22] talking about rapturing faith that's an
[1:36:25] entirely different ballgame as the
[1:36:27] expression goes then rapturing and then
[1:36:29] then then salvation alone rapturing
[1:36:31] grace rapturing faith can only occur in
[1:36:34] this message the message wasn't sent to
[1:36:37] save us necessarily Jesus done that over
[1:36:40] 2,000 years ago on Calvary and us
[1:36:42] accepting that atonement brings us into
[1:36:45] salvation and brings us into the saving
[1:36:47] knowledge of Jesus Christ but the
[1:36:49] message was sent to positionally place
[1:36:52] us and get our garments washed and get
[1:36:55] us clean so that we can get ready for
[1:36:57] the met for the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:59] Christ for the wrapped string of the
[1:37:01] church so Malachi 4's got to come first
[1:37:03] in order to restore what was lost down
[1:37:06] to the church ages to reveal those
[1:37:08] hidden things in the Book of Revelations
[1:37:10] that's what the sounding of the seven
[1:37:11] thunders was that's what the opening of
[1:37:13] the seventh seal was that's what the
[1:37:15] blue sing of the seals inclusive was all
[1:37:18] of those things was to reveal the hidden
[1:37:21] parts in the book of Revelation those
[1:37:23] things that nobody knew not ascribed not
[1:37:25] a scholar and on a prophet not nobody
[1:37:27] the lamb alone held the secret that was
[1:37:30] in that book of Revelation so then after
[1:37:33] the message comes then there's a people
[1:37:35] that's going to be made ready by that
[1:37:37] message for the rapture and the
[1:37:40] resurrection you remember last year when
[1:37:42] I preached to you here about the purpose
[1:37:44] of the mighty angel a member hai told
[1:37:46] you that without us without us Paul and
[1:37:49] the rest of
[1:37:50] would lay in the ground because Paul's
[1:37:52] message could not produce rapturing
[1:37:54] faith Paul had everything that God
[1:37:57] wanted him to have in that first church
[1:37:58] age he laid the foundation for
[1:38:00] everything that we would ever believe as
[1:38:02] Christians but without the loosing of
[1:38:04] the seven seals without the revealing of
[1:38:07] the book of Revelation
[1:38:08] there was no rapturing faith for the
[1:38:10] church to take a body change everybody
[1:38:13] understand that say hey man all right
[1:38:15] without that message they could not
[1:38:17] complete it just like in the capstone
[1:38:19] when the capstone was established at
[1:38:21] faith Paul said that no other foundation
[1:38:24] can be laid then that which was laid
[1:38:26] which was Christ Jesus now when you look
[1:38:28] at the photo one brother brand puts in
[1:38:29] there's a little spot right underneath
[1:38:31] faith there that's the foundation of
[1:38:33] Jesus Christ then Paul said in
[1:38:35] Corinthians he said I as a wise
[1:38:37] masterbuilder
[1:38:39] I have built upon that foundation he
[1:38:42] said with Jesus Christ being the chief
[1:38:44] Cornerstone all of these ages as they
[1:38:46] come up down through 2,000 years all of
[1:38:49] these ages are completely incomplete
[1:38:51] absolutely incomplete altogether without
[1:38:54] this capstone right here so the capstone
[1:38:57] not only completes this whole thing but
[1:38:59] brings it in to come into perfection and
[1:39:02] brings it into maturity where everything
[1:39:05] that Paul and Wesley and Luther and all
[1:39:07] the rest of them preached a man would
[1:39:09] come to its fullness in other words
[1:39:11] Martin Luther preached justification the
[1:39:13] just shall live by faith
[1:39:15] but when the capstone come it revealed
[1:39:17] to us that justification was not only
[1:39:20] being forgiven for your past sins Amen
[1:39:22] hang on they hand the horses out to gate
[1:39:25] you're almost left in the saddle but
[1:39:26] hang on a man and you realize that
[1:39:29] justification was not only just being
[1:39:31] forgiven of your past sins but to be
[1:39:33] justified men in this hour that you were
[1:39:36] forgiven as though it never took place
[1:39:38] in the beginning Amen somebody say man
[1:39:41] and then all of this comes into its
[1:39:43] perfection way the capstone was a
[1:39:45] perfect pyramid within itself Jesus
[1:39:48] Christ lived a perfect life for thirty
[1:39:51] three and a half years they took him to
[1:39:53] Pilate Hall as it was the sacrifice they
[1:39:55] examined the sacrifice for four days
[1:39:58] after four days that there was no
[1:40:00] blemish then they would sacrifice it for
[1:40:02] the sins of Israel Jesus for four
[1:40:04] Corday's was in pilots Hall they found
[1:40:06] no fault in the Lamb of God hallelujah I
[1:40:09] still find no fault in him amen he's
[1:40:12] still the sentence perfect son of God
[1:40:14] amen to get to atone for our sins to
[1:40:17] intercede for our sins so he is the
[1:40:20] perfect capstone if that capstone cannot
[1:40:23] sit on the rest of this body Paul and
[1:40:25] the rest of them would lay in the ground
[1:40:26] there's no rapturing faith in their
[1:40:29] message it puts them in the body of
[1:40:31] Christ but it cannot put them in the
[1:40:32] rapture the resurrection will be called
[1:40:35] after the message has been completed and
[1:40:38] has been finished remember that was the
[1:40:40] mystery at the ministry rather of the
[1:40:42] mystery of the seven things remember
[1:40:44] revelation 10 7 when he shall begin to
[1:40:47] sound the mystery shall be what finished
[1:40:49] or completed as he's builded all the way
[1:40:51] up through these ages the Ministry of
[1:40:54] William Branham wants to finish
[1:40:56] everything that Paul and the rest of
[1:40:58] them at left loose ends on oh it's a
[1:41:00] plane of your child you could see it if
[1:41:02] you want to see it amen now we've made
[1:41:04] this so mysterious that people just
[1:41:06] don't understand what's laying ahead of
[1:41:07] us quite simply the message has prepared
[1:41:10] us for what Jesus Christ expects out of
[1:41:13] our life how do I know how to worship
[1:41:15] how do I know how to live how do I know
[1:41:17] what kind of a Godhead he is or what
[1:41:19] kind of power Authority all I got to do
[1:41:21] is press play and obey I'll agree with
[1:41:23] them there hey hey hey man all I got to
[1:41:26] do is read the message of the hour and
[1:41:27] out of that message the Holy Spirit will
[1:41:30] interpret his word to my heart to let me
[1:41:32] know what things are pleasing what
[1:41:34] things aren't pleasing as the ministry
[1:41:36] preaches the gospel the ministry will
[1:41:38] dig into that truth and they'll tell me
[1:41:40] things like for example you may not have
[1:41:42] known if you're riding down the road and
[1:41:44] somebody's got their brights on and you
[1:41:46] flash them flashing flashing brother
[1:41:48] branham called that Pentecostal cousin
[1:41:50] amen aren't you glad you come to church
[1:41:52] this morning
[1:41:53] amen stay with me a little bit amen
[1:41:56] so the Future event that lays before the
[1:41:58] body of Christ as we read Paul in first
[1:42:00] essence for here he said we say unto you
[1:42:02] by the word of the Lord that we which
[1:42:04] are alive and remain unto that doesn't
[1:42:07] mean it's here but we're moving unto
[1:42:09] that onto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:42:11] not prevent or hinder
[1:42:13] them which are asleep for the Lord shall
[1:42:16] do three things and prevent Ellison here
[1:42:18] in the rapture do a shout a voice and a
[1:42:20] trumpet and he does all three as he's
[1:42:22] descending now we realized that the the
[1:42:25] the dissension of the mighty angel in
[1:42:27] revelation 10:1 when the mighty angel
[1:42:30] comes down he's got a book open in his
[1:42:32] hand look at it in Revelation chapter 5
[1:42:34] whenever the lamb is going to take this
[1:42:36] book the book is still closed but when
[1:42:38] it comes to the ministry of revelation
[1:42:40] 10 notice the book is open it's open and
[1:42:44] now it's time to reveal whatever was
[1:42:46] hidden in the contents of that book and
[1:42:49] where does he come to he's a mighty
[1:42:51] angel come since his foot on the earth
[1:42:52] foot on the sea takes that book hands it
[1:42:55] to the seventh angel the seventh angel
[1:42:57] breaks the mystery and then there's
[1:42:59] another ministry that follows that what
[1:43:01] was it the Prophet will now change his
[1:43:04] attraction to the prophecy which is you
[1:43:07] that was your cue to say amen and
[1:43:09] hallelujah glory to God a man and now
[1:43:11] revelation 10 8 is okay John now the
[1:43:14] mystery is broke you come now you take
[1:43:17] this book you eat this book you to be
[1:43:19] sweeten your mouth it'll be bitter in
[1:43:21] your belly
[1:43:22] but you'll prophesy again hallelujah
[1:43:24] amen and that's what's going on now the
[1:43:26] ministry of the bride a member of the
[1:43:29] Branham with the bride have a ministry
[1:43:30] said that's what's going on now apostles
[1:43:32] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:43:33] pastors not everybody stand up read
[1:43:35] pushing a tape-recorder
[1:43:36] but preaching the gospel amen so the
[1:43:39] rapture is a combination of the message
[1:43:42] it is it is a gathering together of what
[1:43:45] the message has brought is that don't
[1:43:47] you understand brother sister whenever
[1:43:49] the devil uses individuals to try to
[1:43:51] discredit this message the devil knows
[1:43:53] what he's doing he knows that if he can
[1:43:55] rob you from the benefit of receiving
[1:43:58] the message in the right way he knows he
[1:44:00] is robbing from you rapturing faith and
[1:44:02] my Bible tells me the devil came to
[1:44:04] steal to kill and destroy amen any true
[1:44:08] godly servant of God even brother
[1:44:10] Branham knowing what kind of man that a
[1:44:11] ally might have been knowing what kind
[1:44:13] of men these other guys were but you
[1:44:15] never heard brother Branham destroying
[1:44:17] another ministry you never heard him
[1:44:19] running down another individual he would
[1:44:21] call him brother he would call them
[1:44:23] Christians
[1:44:24] when identifying the servants of God and
[1:44:26] I don't care who they are any website
[1:44:28] any preacher any individual that tears
[1:44:31] another one down he don't even have this
[1:44:33] first base of holy ghost teaching in his
[1:44:35] heart a man who don't even know what
[1:44:38] he's talking about because any true
[1:44:39] servant of God will never do another
[1:44:41] servant of God that way
[1:44:42] Amen there's a difference in calling out
[1:44:44] the devil and then trying to destroy
[1:44:45] somebody's influence to me it goes to
[1:44:48] show that the spirit behind a lot of
[1:44:49] this stuff when people start tearing
[1:44:51] things down like turn preachers down and
[1:44:53] tear and brother branham down and all
[1:44:55] the thing about the bridge and the thing
[1:44:56] about the cloud and all these other
[1:44:58] things like that to me it goes to show
[1:45:00] that there's an evil spirit somewhere
[1:45:03] amen because if you could follow around
[1:45:05] some of the lives of these critics and
[1:45:07] you could tape-record 1,100 times they
[1:45:09] had set out and down and how to talk
[1:45:11] with somebody I imagine you could
[1:45:12] nitpick them about things to a man but
[1:45:15] I'll say it like a friend of mine said
[1:45:17] it locked me in a room with some devil
[1:45:18] possessed person locked them in a room
[1:45:20] let's see who comes out at the end of
[1:45:21] the day Amen that's exactly right hey
[1:45:24] man you got to know where you're
[1:45:25] standing in the last day so the message
[1:45:27] gave us position on authority did you
[1:45:31] hear that the message gave us positional
[1:45:33] Authority what we need to understand is
[1:45:36] that salvation and the baptism of the
[1:45:38] Holy Ghost is only the first baby steps
[1:45:41] in being what you're supposed to be in
[1:45:43] Christ we've got to grow up into all
[1:45:46] things we've got to come up into greater
[1:45:48] things greater revelations greater than
[1:45:50] ik how does it come it comes by
[1:45:52] suffering it comes by hardships it comes
[1:45:55] by trials it comes by death to self
[1:45:57] delft to this death to that amen until
[1:46:00] that's something that Christ be formed
[1:46:02] inside of you and then all of these
[1:46:05] characteristics all of these qualities
[1:46:07] have got to be in the elect of God
[1:46:08] before we go out of here because this is
[1:46:11] adoption time Paul spoke of that he said
[1:46:14] this is the hour the manifestation of
[1:46:16] the sons of God so after the message
[1:46:18] comes the book of Revelation is revealed
[1:46:21] it's opened up to us we can look at this
[1:46:23] revelation in this book here we can open
[1:46:25] up any chapter there and we can say I
[1:46:27] get it I understand it no other age
[1:46:30] could say what we can say about the book
[1:46:31] of Revelation I mean if you took Paul
[1:46:34] himself inside him down and talked to
[1:46:35] him about it he couldn't have understood
[1:46:36] it
[1:46:37] because it wasn't revealed to Baal but
[1:46:39] you and I have the revelation of what
[1:46:41] lays in the book of Revelation we do you
[1:46:44] say well I don't understand it all but
[1:46:45] daddy because you can't
[1:46:46] then ain't because it ain't laying in
[1:46:49] there for you to understand all you got
[1:46:50] to do is start reading the message it's
[1:46:52] already been interpreted for us so we
[1:46:54] don't even have to do the hard part we
[1:46:55] just got to read a man just read the
[1:46:58] book as he said it and then let the Holy
[1:46:59] Spirit interpret it to us from what the
[1:47:01] prophets had a meant so here we have a
[1:47:04] lion show now the message comes open now
[1:47:06] we have the sons of God daughters of God
[1:47:09] taking the word becoming the book
[1:47:11] sweeten your mouth bidding your belly
[1:47:13] bit bitter in your belly and now they're
[1:47:15] manifesting in adoption placing
[1:47:18] positional Authority somebody asked me
[1:47:21] the other day he said well he said you
[1:47:24] know the message he anybody can get
[1:47:25] saved you said a Baptist can have the
[1:47:27] Holy Ghost I said you're wrong
[1:47:29] I said you're talking about being born
[1:47:31] again as Peter said by incorruptible
[1:47:33] seed I said tell me how a Baptist can
[1:47:36] have incorruptible seed doctrine tell me
[1:47:38] how any organization can produce
[1:47:40] incorruptible seed whenever they mix the
[1:47:43] Word of God with their own ideas they
[1:47:45] change the Godhead to suit them they
[1:47:47] change membership to suit them they
[1:47:48] interpret baptism in any way they want
[1:47:51] and so tell me how that can produce the
[1:47:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't say
[1:47:55] that God can't move on them and God
[1:47:57] can't deal with them but it's just like
[1:47:59] when the angel would stir the waters at
[1:48:00] Bethesda as long as the angel was in
[1:48:03] those waters there was virtue in those
[1:48:05] waters Amen Luther got in the water and
[1:48:07] stirred it up and there was virtue in
[1:48:09] his message but when the angel left
[1:48:11] Luther's message there was no virtue in
[1:48:12] Luther's message when the life is he
[1:48:14] told to seed not err at the show moved
[1:48:16] on to Wesley's day moved on to Pentecost
[1:48:19] as long as the angel of the age was
[1:48:21] standing in the water stirring the water
[1:48:23] there was life in those waters but when
[1:48:26] the mighty angel comes out he pronounces
[1:48:28] by raising his hand to heaven and
[1:48:30] swearing by him that lived
[1:48:32] ever and ever that these denominational
[1:48:35] ages has run out you can no longer be a
[1:48:38] part of an organization and make the
[1:48:40] rapture the resurrection that can't
[1:48:42] happen amen and I don't care if that
[1:48:45] denominations in a message denomination
[1:48:47] I'm a man you've got to be in the
[1:48:50] revelation for the hour you say well
[1:48:52] what is a revelation I'm glad you asked
[1:48:54] me I'm gonna tell you Christ is a
[1:48:56] mystery of God revealed but the bride is
[1:48:58] the mystery of Jesus Christ revealed
[1:48:59] it's you it's you you are that
[1:49:02] revelation the whole purpose of all of
[1:49:03] this aridity last night was for God to
[1:49:06] share eternal life with you you are the
[1:49:08] mystery of every bit of this
[1:49:10] I mean interpreted how you ever want to
[1:49:12] interpret it call it a white horse call
[1:49:13] it a seven sealed call it a thunder at
[1:49:15] the end of the day it all spells out 1
[1:49:17] subtitle y-o-u every bit of it comes
[1:49:21] back down to God did every bit of this
[1:49:24] for you
[1:49:25] amen that's what the rapture the message
[1:49:27] is all about God is not coming to
[1:49:30] rapture a book or a tape library or an
[1:49:32] mp3 player
[1:49:33] he's coming come on he's coming to
[1:49:36] rapture individuals the rapture is not
[1:49:39] an event the rapture is a body hey man
[1:49:44] don't don't let this shake you down but
[1:49:45] I'm already in it
[1:49:48] how can you say that would that bald
[1:49:50] spot on the back of your head I'm not
[1:49:51] talking about my body my body will catch
[1:49:53] up after a while but my soul has already
[1:49:55] entered into heavenly places I have
[1:49:59] already been ended up in the New
[1:50:01] Jerusalem I'm already moving in heavenly
[1:50:04] things the revelation has caught me up
[1:50:06] just like with Elijah and Elijah if
[1:50:08] Elijah would have never saw Elijah
[1:50:11] caught up he would have never got the
[1:50:12] mantle you've got to see the same thing
[1:50:15] you've got to see brother Branham caught
[1:50:17] up into the third pool or the revelation
[1:50:19] of the hour or when these denominational
[1:50:21] things have run out you've got to see
[1:50:22] that caught up to get another the second
[1:50:24] anointing that comes with this message
[1:50:26] if you want to be Messiah 'it's you got
[1:50:29] to leave first and second pool is a
[1:50:34] holiday man out a nanny well the first
[1:50:37] and second pool was good for its time as
[1:50:39] long as the angel was stirring the water
[1:50:41] it was good for its time but you can't
[1:50:43] be a first and second pool Christian to
[1:50:44] make the rapture you've got to be in the
[1:50:47] revelation for this day and that was all
[1:50:49] revealed in them seven seals you cannot
[1:50:52] have positional Authority as long as
[1:50:54] what you are has to depend on a prophet
[1:50:57] telling you what you ate for breakfast
[1:51:00] hey man I'm just gonna say two now hey
[1:51:03] man you can't have positional Authority
[1:51:05] if it takes a man to lay his hand on you
[1:51:08] to discern from his hand what's going on
[1:51:09] with your life you've got to leave first
[1:51:11] in second pool you got to leave all of
[1:51:13] that charismatic and all that
[1:51:15] neo-pentecostal and all of that worldly
[1:51:17] updated type stuff and you've got to
[1:51:20] enter away from all of that system and
[1:51:22] you've got to come to the message of the
[1:51:23] hour which is the third pole of this day
[1:51:26] amen a lot of these people that was
[1:51:28] around brother Branham they all call him
[1:51:30] a prophet I'm sure he was a prophet then
[1:51:32] all of a sudden he the seals come open
[1:51:34] and they say well that's where he got
[1:51:35] off to us that's where he was getting on
[1:51:38] hey man that was the best part of the
[1:51:41] message for us look at that brother BAM
[1:51:43] changed as his language he starts saying
[1:51:44] Jean C to God again and again and again
[1:51:46] and again and again start something out
[1:51:48] all these different things you know why
[1:51:49] he was no longer preaching to the Full
[1:51:51] Gospel businessman in the Pentecostal
[1:51:53] Methodist and to badness and having
[1:51:54] healing revivals he was now preaching
[1:51:56] the Shekinah glory food
[1:51:58] oh how they lujah to God he was
[1:52:02] revealing to us the things that had been
[1:52:04] hidden in God's mind since the
[1:52:06] foundation the world you remember we say
[1:52:07] Christ is the mystery he said God had a
[1:52:09] secret in the back part of his mind and
[1:52:11] he was something he wanted to reveal
[1:52:14] well now the back part has become the
[1:52:15] forward part hey man we're not no longer
[1:52:17] reading in the back part of it we're not
[1:52:19] reading in the back side of the book
[1:52:20] where the seal was that it's been broke
[1:52:22] now we're seeing the revelation clearly
[1:52:24] so here's your order future events
[1:52:26] Elijah's got to come that's first thing
[1:52:28] a lot just got to restore life just got
[1:52:30] to reveal the mystery has got to come
[1:52:32] open the sons of God have got to receive
[1:52:34] the word they've got to receive the
[1:52:35] revelation which gets them ready for the
[1:52:37] rapture gets them ready for the
[1:52:39] resurrection as we come to maturity as
[1:52:41] the sons of God come into their adoption
[1:52:44] once the capstone sets down on your life
[1:52:47] once you are a mature manifested Son of
[1:52:50] God daughter of God and the capstone
[1:52:52] sets on you your life your influence
[1:52:56] will be like a great magnet to them in
[1:52:57] the resurrection and your life here will
[1:53:00] dovetail with Jesus Christ up there and
[1:53:03] when the shout or the message or the all
[1:53:06] of that is completed here on earth then
[1:53:08] the voice of the resurrection will speak
[1:53:10] right out of the electorate of God right
[1:53:12] out of Jesus Christ and your life will
[1:53:15] call for the resurrection you won't even
[1:53:18] have to speak it you won't even have to
[1:53:20] say time for the resurrection your own
[1:53:22] life will testify to God she's ready
[1:53:25] everybody's waiting on that moment where
[1:53:27] God hollers down okay you're ready now
[1:53:29] hey listen when you show up you ain't
[1:53:30] nobody got to say a word about it it's
[1:53:33] just like when you become a Christian
[1:53:34] you don't have to tell nobody you're a
[1:53:35] Christian they automatically notice
[1:53:37] something's different about you come on
[1:53:39] somebody and then when this bride is
[1:53:41] ready to go out of here God don't have
[1:53:43] to call out of heaven hear ye hear ye
[1:53:45] all ye people of Earth the bride is now
[1:53:47] ready her life will testify
[1:53:51] but she's ready to call ready to get out
[1:53:53] of here and like a magnet her power of
[1:53:56] influence will draw the rest of him
[1:53:58] right out of the ground and pull him
[1:53:59] right up for the resurrection amen
[1:54:01] notice the order of the Resurrection God
[1:54:03] comes first he takes those out of that
[1:54:05] sixth dimension those theophany bodies
[1:54:07] will then come down to earth to pick up
[1:54:09] glorified bodies the other they said
[1:54:11] there they'll appear on the earth it
[1:54:13] might be just be for a few moments of
[1:54:14] time but like my brother Carol used to
[1:54:17] say this a lot but as mom was long red
[1:54:20] hairy just a redheaded girl and he said
[1:54:22] I might be going out to the mailbox he
[1:54:24] said there mama would be standing here
[1:54:26] and he said I'll know right then it's
[1:54:28] time to go as brother and said your
[1:54:31] loved ones will appear to you first you
[1:54:32] might be standing in the mirror all of a
[1:54:34] sudden you know you're looking at that
[1:54:35] head you don't come out Chad we two
[1:54:38] fellas in the same boy anyway
[1:54:41] hallelujah and and all of a sudden you
[1:54:44] blink your eyes like that remembers a
[1:54:46] moment in the twinkling of an eye and
[1:54:47] you're looking at right you blink your
[1:54:48] eye like that next thing you got a full
[1:54:50] head of hair and you're about 18 to 21
[1:54:51] years old glory Oh hallelujah amen
[1:54:56] you'll know the change is on you'll know
[1:54:57] it's time to get out of here now
[1:54:59] remember the order of future events is
[1:55:01] that when the bride goes up now Satan
[1:55:04] must come down all right I want you to
[1:55:07] catch this if you want to write this
[1:55:08] down we're gonna look at the Tribulation
[1:55:10] Period which is the next part of this
[1:55:11] and I want you to notice there are two
[1:55:14] witnesses Revelation chapter 11 3 4 and
[1:55:18] 5 there's three verses in that
[1:55:20] revelation I want you to understand
[1:55:21] that's a three and a half year time
[1:55:23] period
[1:55:23] I'm assumed brother Jared believes that
[1:55:26] here other brothers they believe seven
[1:55:28] years but I read him in the turn the
[1:55:30] question is if a guy wrote me the other
[1:55:31] day and he said I was privileged he said
[1:55:33] to you know to understand that it's
[1:55:36] seven years left he said after wait
[1:55:37] brother Branham tated I thought they
[1:55:39] ain't never read question answers on the
[1:55:40] seals because when they asked him they
[1:55:42] said on Daniel tape did you mean to say
[1:55:44] seven years he said no no no no no no no
[1:55:47] that's what I've been saying for the
[1:55:48] last ten years trying to explain to
[1:55:50] people when I preach this it's not seven
[1:55:52] years can they say oh yes it is I said
[1:55:53] no no no no no no no I'm just saying
[1:55:56] what he said a man
[1:55:57] a man that's three and a half years
[1:55:59] because remember Daniels 70th week is
[1:56:02] the last week of prophecy each day
[1:56:05] represents a year so that week would be
[1:56:09] seven years and that seven years
[1:56:11] remember the sacrifice or Messiah was
[1:56:14] cut off exactly right in the middle of
[1:56:16] the week it's like God had a great
[1:56:18] stopwatch like this and it was running
[1:56:20] time and he come to the 69th week he got
[1:56:22] right down through the half of that and
[1:56:24] he hit his stopwatch like that and the
[1:56:26] time of the Jews had stopped all of that
[1:56:29] prophecy to Israel as a nation had
[1:56:32] stopped remember a Jew can get saved
[1:56:34] today if they're considered a Gentile
[1:56:36] body you can be Jewish they can be
[1:56:39] absolutely Jew born but that doesn't
[1:56:41] mean we're not talking about the 144,000
[1:56:43] because remember Israel is saved as a
[1:56:45] nation a man that's just scripture amen
[1:56:49] they're not saved as individual they're
[1:56:51] saved as a nation don't forget the first
[1:56:53] Gentile body that was saved and received
[1:56:56] the Holy Ghost was a hundred and twenty
[1:56:58] Jews in the upper room but they were not
[1:57:01] saved as a nation a man they were saved
[1:57:03] as individuals
[1:57:05] amen are you with me Amen him from a
[1:57:08] hundred and twenty Jews came three
[1:57:09] thousand more and now whether they're
[1:57:12] Arimathea whether they're Greek whether
[1:57:14] I don't care what they are
[1:57:15] Amen what a nationality is there saved
[1:57:18] as an individual but when the bride goes
[1:57:21] up that ends now God is going to turn
[1:57:24] his attention over to 144,000 Jews Oh
[1:57:28] God let me look over the banister time
[1:57:31] on that revival strikes
[1:57:32] can you imagine 144,000 I'm shouting and
[1:57:36] praising the Lord and getting the Holy
[1:57:37] Ghost in one hour in one day and one
[1:57:39] time but y'all think you're loud noisy
[1:57:42] you they got noise they wait til you see
[1:57:44] that revival break wide open Amen when
[1:57:47] they're standing there than two prophets
[1:57:49] Moses and Elijah look at their
[1:57:51] ministries Elijah shut the heavens up
[1:57:53] that's what one of these witnesses does
[1:57:54] Moses you know and so forth like that
[1:57:56] brother Branham said that the sixth seal
[1:57:59] is the tribulation seal and he said
[1:58:01] Moses and Elijah will be the ones in
[1:58:04] that tribulation time you said there's
[1:58:06] three phases in that sixth seal now and
[1:58:09] all of this tribulation time when Moses
[1:58:11] and a lie
[1:58:11] just standing there they will have the
[1:58:13] power of the spoken word you say how is
[1:58:15] that possible
[1:58:16] because remember everything that laid in
[1:58:19] the grave all the way up to this time
[1:58:20] was waiting on the manifestation of the
[1:58:23] sons of God when the manifestation of
[1:58:25] the sons of God occur and the capstone
[1:58:28] sets down every one of us become to our
[1:58:30] maturity in Jesus Christ we'll be able
[1:58:32] to speak creation we'll be able to move
[1:58:35] trees around move mountains around walk
[1:58:37] on the water change dimensions travel
[1:58:39] like a thought nothing will be
[1:58:41] impossible to use a child of God amen
[1:58:44] and when Moses and Elijah are sent back
[1:58:46] to this earth ever how they come amen
[1:58:48] that same anointing that same revelation
[1:58:51] that same Authority that same power of
[1:58:54] God will transfer to us and it will move
[1:58:56] right over on the I mean they'll have
[1:58:58] the same power that we've got here on
[1:59:00] the earth
[1:59:01] amen them homosexuals that are living on
[1:59:04] the earth at the time they'll speak hail
[1:59:05] balls out of the heavens don't kid
[1:59:08] yourself when God said stone on the head
[1:59:09] until dead that was his belief in gay
[1:59:11] rights you have a right to be stoned to
[1:59:14] death that's the way God looks at gay
[1:59:15] rights hey man that's Bible a man who
[1:59:20] said a man that lays with a man as he
[1:59:21] would with a woman and vice versa he
[1:59:23] said they ought to be stoned without
[1:59:24] mercy under two or three witnesses Amen
[1:59:27] God will hold that word true you ain't
[1:59:28] changed his word I'm not preaching hate
[1:59:31] speech I know them the cameras on I'm
[1:59:33] not trying to bash against homosexuals
[1:59:35] I'm trying to say you better get saved
[1:59:36] before God's judgment has something to
[1:59:38] say about it
[1:59:39] amen that's exactly right they'll call
[1:59:41] hail balls that are a hundred pounds of
[1:59:43] peace and they'll stone him like they
[1:59:45] did Sodom and Gomorrah like they did in
[1:59:47] the Old Testament and if they try to
[1:59:48] hurt one of them prophets Holy Ghost
[1:59:50] fire
[1:59:51] remember fire proceeds out of their
[1:59:52] mouth that's Holy Ghost fire will
[1:59:55] precede spoken word will proceed out of
[1:59:57] their mouth and anyone that tries to did
[1:59:59] to to molest them during that three and
[2:00:01] a half years
[2:00:02] amen they'll speak the word and they'll
[2:00:04] turn the thing around it'll be such a
[2:00:06] horrible time that the people will cry
[2:00:08] for the rocks and the mountains to fall
[2:00:10] on them the caves and things they'll
[2:00:13] hide in caves trying to escape the
[2:00:15] judgment of God some I said well I'll
[2:00:17] just I'll stock up on water and rations
[2:00:19] and all these kind of things and I'll go
[2:00:21] hide in a cave somewhere another I said
[2:00:23] yeah you could do all of that
[2:00:24] physically you might be alright for a
[2:00:26] few days I said but what are you going
[2:00:28] to do whenever the grace of God releases
[2:00:30] off of humanity and your imagination and
[2:00:33] your mind is released and loose any old
[2:00:37] devil that wants to torment you any old
[2:00:39] thing that wants to plague you the blood
[2:00:41] ring around this earth to keep it away
[2:00:43] brother
[2:00:43] the Bloods didn't demand taking officer
[2:00:46] she's called the bride a man at that
[2:00:49] hour that three and a half year
[2:00:50] tribulation Satan will sit out there in
[2:00:52] that Vatican City
[2:00:53] he'll thrown himself in the heart of
[2:00:55] that Pope and they'll worship this man
[2:00:58] like he's God sitting in the temple of
[2:00:59] God showing himself that He is God at
[2:01:02] that time he will control the world's
[2:01:04] commerce he'll control politics
[2:01:05] he'll control everything else and guess
[2:01:07] who he is he's an American you say how
[2:01:11] do you believe that acts of the Holy
[2:01:12] Spirit 1954 brother BAM said remember
[2:01:15] according to prophecy this revelation
[2:01:17] 13:11 remember revelation 13:1 the first
[2:01:21] Pope came out of the waters which was
[2:01:23] the multitude and thickness of people
[2:01:24] and nations and so forth but when
[2:01:26] revelation 13:11 when the Beast raises
[2:01:29] up he comes out of the earth which
[2:01:31] brother branham identified as the United
[2:01:33] States I can't help it it's just what he
[2:01:36] said friends a man and you imagine how
[2:01:38] is that going to work we'll usually
[2:01:39] understand that it's not Canada it's not
[2:01:42] Mexico it's not Trinidad it's not
[2:01:44] Australia not a - nations were
[2:01:46] prophesied to be an image unto the Beast
[2:01:49] but the Bible said brother Branham said
[2:01:51] that the United States would becoming
[2:01:53] the image under the beast and speak with
[2:01:56] all the same power where do you think
[2:01:58] she gets her power her Pope is sitting
[2:02:00] over there and wrongness got all the
[2:02:01] power to back her all he has to do is
[2:02:03] holler from Vatican City and tell us
[2:02:05] Americans what we're supposed to do and
[2:02:07] how we're supposed to do it and shut
[2:02:08] down churches and shut down this and
[2:02:10] open up that and pull this thing and
[2:02:13] that thing and you think we're going to
[2:02:14] defy the Pope he's got all of the money
[2:02:16] we're broke anyhow amen come on somebody
[2:02:20] a man and a stupid Americans God forgive
[2:02:23] me but a stupid Americans will sell out
[2:02:25] our mother if it meant getting out
[2:02:29] all you got to do is just look at the
[2:02:31] way they vote elections forget politics
[2:02:34] you want to see how presidents elected
[2:02:36] the United States you know what I'm
[2:02:38] talking about you Americans sitting in
[2:02:39] here they vote these guys based on
[2:02:42] whether or not they're gonna make them
[2:02:43] any money or not at the end of the day
[2:02:45] don't matter about their politics amen
[2:02:48] all they might carry on about abortion a
[2:02:50] few things like yet oh I've never voted
[2:02:51] a Democrat blah blah blah and all that
[2:02:53] kind of stuff like that at the end of
[2:02:54] the day the majority I mean the moral
[2:02:56] majority call the moral majority to me I
[2:02:58] call it the immoral majority amen but
[2:03:01] the majority of people the United States
[2:03:02] you know what they look for they look
[2:03:04] for the guy that's going to make their
[2:03:05] gas prices low and put money in their
[2:03:07] pockets at the end of the day that's
[2:03:09] what politics amounts to so when Mama
[2:03:12] comes over here to buy us out of our
[2:03:13] debt you think we're going to say no to
[2:03:15] that what are we gonna do all right a
[2:03:18] mess now or trillions and trillions of
[2:03:20] dollars and we want to live like kings
[2:03:22] instead I'll make it
[2:03:23] mommy looked down said I'll make you I
[2:03:25] got the pocketbook I'll pay you out of
[2:03:27] debt son and she'll sell her birthright
[2:03:30] out and when the moment she does she'll
[2:03:32] take the mark of the beast and you can't
[2:03:34] buy nor sell unless you got your name
[2:03:36] associated with that system out there
[2:03:37] and here's the sad part about it many of
[2:03:40] the little local churches little
[2:03:42] independent nondenominational type
[2:03:43] independent churches and so for like
[2:03:45] that to keep their doors open they'll
[2:03:47] just go along with the framework brother
[2:03:49] Bentham said they'll agree with the
[2:03:51] framework of it and said well well you
[2:03:53] know we don't have to agree with one
[2:03:55] another we'll leave you alone and you
[2:03:57] just leave us alone
[2:03:58] we'll go on serving God and brother BAM
[2:04:00] said when they do that they are selling
[2:04:02] out their birthright amen and even the
[2:04:04] foolish virgin he said in questions and
[2:04:06] answers will recognize that they've been
[2:04:08] trapped up into that system and when
[2:04:10] they get trapped up into it being the
[2:04:12] bride type hallelujah he said they'll
[2:04:14] come find out of there with everything
[2:04:16] they caught that's when they give their
[2:04:18] life and the Catholics will hunt him
[2:04:19] down and take their head from their
[2:04:21] shoulders kill him in the streets like
[2:04:22] dogs amen but God will give him white
[2:04:25] robes amen gotta wash them they men wash
[2:04:29] their robes because of the persecution
[2:04:31] because of the purging of it by this
[2:04:33] time the bride is already gone okay
[2:04:36] during this three and a half year time
[2:04:37] we're at the wedding supper
[2:04:41] hey man hallelujah we're enjoying heaven
[2:04:44] now members the type was in Genesis
[2:04:47] member 1 Joseph when Joseph is in the
[2:04:50] palace revealing himself to Benjamin
[2:04:52] remember his wife this is Joseph this is
[2:04:55] a Joseph yes
[2:04:57] Genesis 45 12 through 14 12 13 14
[2:05:00] chapter 45 Genesis 45 12 to 14 when
[2:05:03] Joseph is revealing himself to his
[2:05:05] brethren remember his wife is in the
[2:05:08] palace when he's down at the other side
[2:05:10] there might have been the palace or in
[2:05:12] some kind of a room everywhere he was
[2:05:13] his wife is in the palace when he slips
[2:05:15] himself down and he makes himself known
[2:05:18] to Benjamin remember up to this time he
[2:05:21] had spoken to them through an
[2:05:23] interpreter he had spoken to him in
[2:05:26] another language Oh hallelujah but now
[2:05:32] it was time to reveal the unknown tongue
[2:05:37] amen didn't you say in mark chapter 16
[2:05:39] you'll speak with new tongues amen and
[2:05:42] Benjamin or Israel 144,000 will receive
[2:05:46] the same revelation that you and I are
[2:05:49] enjoying this morning they will
[2:05:51] understand water baptism in the name of
[2:05:53] Jesus Christ they will understand the
[2:05:54] oneness of the Godhead they will not
[2:05:56] look at Jesus Christ as being a second
[2:05:59] person of the Godhead they sure won't
[2:06:00] say what this guy said the other day
[2:06:01] that Jesus will never be God they'll
[2:06:03] look at him and say my Lord and my
[2:06:05] Savior amen my Lord and my god they'll
[2:06:08] understand that Jesus was on the second
[2:06:11] person but he was the person hey man he
[2:06:13] was car wrapped and skinned God wrapped
[2:06:15] in flesh they'll receive it they'll
[2:06:18] understand the whole revelation of where
[2:06:20] we are today and what positional
[2:06:21] Authority God has given them now
[2:06:23] remember while we're at the wedding
[2:06:25] supper now they're all making themself
[2:06:27] ready for the Battle of Armageddon
[2:06:29] alright there's two major battles and
[2:06:31] you can write this down
[2:06:32] the Battle of Armageddon and Gog and
[2:06:34] Magog it's real simple to remember the
[2:06:37] Battle of Armageddon takes place before
[2:06:39] the millennium Gog and Magog takes place
[2:06:41] after the millennium it's real simple
[2:06:43] it's real easy now when you take the
[2:06:45] Battle of Armageddon during that time
[2:06:47] remember the plagues out of Revelation
[2:06:49] will begin to fall okay got your pencils
[2:06:52] ready I'm gonna give you some Scripture
[2:06:53] these plagues all right Revelation
[2:06:55] chapter 9 and verse 20 now when these
[2:06:58] plagues begin to fall remember the
[2:07:01] reason the plagues are falling is
[2:07:04] because the mystery has already been
[2:07:07] broke all right remember he said every
[2:07:09] time a mystery would broke break rather
[2:07:12] he said that a thunder would sound he
[2:07:14] said a beast would ride out and start a
[2:07:16] war and so but he said when that mystery
[2:07:18] broke you said a plague would fall so
[2:07:20] down through each Church age there's
[2:07:22] been a plague fall upon each of these
[2:07:24] ages in the last day our plague is
[2:07:26] spiritual death that's why people can
[2:07:29] sit right in the church house and die no
[2:07:32] other age couldn't have been just like
[2:07:33] what it is today they can sit right here
[2:07:34] in the house of God and hear the word of
[2:07:36] God and hear everything's being preached
[2:07:37] all the way around and met and fall on
[2:07:38] deaf ears that we preach Friday night
[2:07:40] and die sitting right there in the
[2:07:42] church and brother if the blood of Jesus
[2:07:43] Christ is not applied to your soul
[2:07:45] you'll sit right in a message church and
[2:07:46] die because death don't discriminate so
[2:07:49] a plague falls at the opening of the
[2:07:52] mystery but remember when the plagues
[2:07:54] fall in the tribulation period it is
[2:07:56] because the cup of the iniquity of the
[2:07:58] amorite cement wood said about that he
[2:08:00] said that the cup had to be full before
[2:08:02] it could be poured out some people
[2:08:04] wonders I said it to you before when I
[2:08:07] was preaching here last year about
[2:08:08] Timothy there we said some men's sins go
[2:08:11] before and some to the judgment remember
[2:08:12] the message last year well that's the
[2:08:14] way this is all of these plagues God is
[2:08:16] waiting some I said to me the other day
[2:08:18] why does so-and-so get away with what
[2:08:20] they get away with I said because the
[2:08:21] cups got to be full so God allows things
[2:08:23] to keep filling until the cup of
[2:08:25] iniquity gets full well now as these
[2:08:27] church ages come to a close as the bride
[2:08:30] goes up and Satan comes down then the
[2:08:32] plague I'm not going to pour it out but
[2:08:34] I'm just going to simulate it
[2:08:35] aim at then the plagues all of the cup
[2:08:37] of everything is poured out in that
[2:08:39] tribulation period brethren I want to
[2:08:41] say to you sister I want to say to you
[2:08:42] don't be caught when this cup gets
[2:08:44] emptied out in that tribulation period
[2:08:45] because you think it's bad in this day
[2:08:47] and age imagine when an entire cup of
[2:08:49] years and generations of sins and
[2:08:51] iniquity and things that's gone on
[2:08:53] before God amen has poured out upon this
[2:08:55] lady you see in time
[2:08:57] imagine when an angry God looks at all
[2:08:59] of the homosexuality and all the
[2:09:00] adultery and all the murder and all the
[2:09:02] molesting and all the killing and the
[2:09:03] thieving and everything
[2:09:04] and all of that's been filled up with
[2:09:06] six billion people just in our
[2:09:08] generation upon the billions that God's
[2:09:10] had to contend with over 2,000 years
[2:09:13] over all of the history of these church
[2:09:14] ages imagine what that Tribulation is
[2:09:17] gonna look like when an angry god pours
[2:09:19] out the cup of his wrath on it
[2:09:21] Oh God hide me in the rock Lord don't
[2:09:23] let me be there amen hide me in that
[2:09:25] place that is higher than I Amen hide me
[2:09:28] in the cleft of the rock a man and then
[2:09:30] rock just hide on me
[2:09:32] Amen keep me safe from all of these
[2:09:34] plagues amen to Revelation chapter 9
[2:09:37] verse 20 the rest of the men which were
[2:09:38] not killed by these plagues yet repented
[2:09:40] not of the works of their hands that
[2:09:43] they should not worship devils and idols
[2:09:45] of gold silver and brass stone of wood
[2:09:47] which neither can see nor hear nor walk
[2:09:50] neither repented they of their murders
[2:09:51] of their sorceries or fornication nor of
[2:09:54] their thefts then God pours out all of
[2:09:57] these things upon these unbelievers do
[2:09:59] you realize a person's worshipping the
[2:10:00] devil many times they need a devil
[2:10:02] worshiper like we think a lot of times
[2:10:05] when we think of a devil worshiper we
[2:10:06] think of some guy with horns and a
[2:10:07] pitchfork you know I'm gonna say
[2:10:10] something to you and I hope this don't
[2:10:12] spook you a little bit but as a minister
[2:10:15] I study all kinds of things and I read
[2:10:16] the book of Satan I've read Satanism
[2:10:19] doctrine Satanism Church I'm gonna tell
[2:10:21] you what it is they simply believe in no
[2:10:24] devil they don't believe in no God you
[2:10:27] know what the theory and the real basis
[2:10:29] of Satanism is you are your own destiny
[2:10:32] you are your own creator you are your
[2:10:35] own maker you are the one that
[2:10:36] determines everything yes well brother
[2:10:38] if they don't sound like what we hear in
[2:10:39] the message of the hour in the last days
[2:10:41] what is it we hear and if it don't sound
[2:10:43] like you like Catholicism and
[2:10:45] Catholicism excuse me and all of that
[2:10:47] out there what's this satellite amen
[2:10:48] you're the one we worship you you've got
[2:10:51] the power you're the one that does it
[2:10:52] the prophets the only one that can it
[2:10:54] ain't nothing but just the devil in
[2:10:55] another form amen any time anybody puts
[2:10:59] any emphasis upon flesh in any way
[2:11:00] whatsoever they're just as much a devil
[2:11:02] worshippers these guys out there have
[2:11:04] been black goatees a man we don't
[2:11:07] emphasize flesh we emphasize Christ
[2:11:11] right because all flesh has come short
[2:11:15] of the glory of God all of us as none of
[2:11:17] us can stand up here and say oh you know
[2:11:19] and you that spooky little feeling oh
[2:11:21] you the Church of Satan the Church of
[2:11:23] Satan that don't scare me you know what
[2:11:24] scares me some of these guys walk around
[2:11:26] brother Browns books under their arms
[2:11:28] and brother brems said brother Brendan
[2:11:29] said brother Brent that's more spooky to
[2:11:30] me than somebody with a bald head and a
[2:11:32] goatee amen because the devil don't hide
[2:11:35] in the dark things like we think he does
[2:11:37] the devil hides in religion a man as for
[2:11:40] Satan dwells eiders and religious things
[2:11:42] remember Satan is the worship person of
[2:11:45] today and he is worshipped through
[2:11:48] religion amen look at him in God to this
[2:11:51] evil age what he's talking about that he
[2:11:53] said he is the worship Percy's that
[2:11:55] worshiped by millions and billions of
[2:11:56] people on this earth today he not
[2:11:58] talking about a bunch of people out
[2:11:59] there cutting the CAF's from throat or
[2:12:01] or taking a goat horns and taking a
[2:12:04] little mouse tail and putting it in a
[2:12:05] cauldron boil bull trouble in trouble
[2:12:07] everything he talking about a priest
[2:12:10] walking to the platform and saying that
[2:12:12] open up the book we're gonna talk to you
[2:12:13] about such and such thing we're gonna
[2:12:14] talk to you about the the Trinity the
[2:12:16] Blessed Holy Trinity amen that's more
[2:12:18] scary to me that Anton LaVey that's the
[2:12:22] head of the Church of Satan if you
[2:12:23] didn't know that Amen anyhow a man
[2:12:26] that's exactly right so these plagues
[2:12:27] will befall upon all that would worship
[2:12:31] anything except for Jesus Christ
[2:12:33] remember not even a prophet would except
[2:12:36] worship you want to get tetanus in
[2:12:39] Revelations warning when he fell down
[2:12:42] before the feet of him he said see that
[2:12:44] do it not for am i I am of thy brethren
[2:12:47] the fellow servants the prophets hey man
[2:12:50] he said he said don't don't fall down to
[2:12:52] me he said don't fall down to me he said
[2:12:54] worship God he's the one
[2:12:56] now notice after the Tribulation Period
[2:12:58] now comes the Battle of Armageddon in
[2:13:02] Revelation chapter 18 1 through 11 and
[2:13:04] also verse 21 he talks about the
[2:13:06] merchants of the earth will get rich
[2:13:09] because the Antichrist will cause craft
[2:13:12] to prosper upon this earth everybody
[2:13:15] will be getting rich everybody will be a
[2:13:16] bit make it be making money
[2:13:18] everybody will be will we call it
[2:13:20] walking on high street
[2:13:22] hi cottons they say down south they'll
[2:13:25] have all this money laying before I man
[2:13:27] they'll think boy we've never had better
[2:13:29] times peace peace
[2:13:31] and all of a sudden here comes sudden
[2:13:32] destruction amen but the bride will be
[2:13:35] in the palace while Joseph is revealing
[2:13:37] himself to the hundred and forty four
[2:13:39] thousand I remember they kill these two
[2:13:41] prophets in the street CNN Fox News
[2:13:43] MSNBC and all these guys have their
[2:13:45] cameras out there and they have so
[2:13:48] tormented this bunch let me get this I
[2:13:50] can't leave this they so tormented this
[2:13:52] group of people that when the Romans
[2:13:55] will win a victory they take a little
[2:13:56] white stone and pass it to one others
[2:13:58] like a sign of victories and they give
[2:14:00] gifts to one of the things of that
[2:14:02] nature that had this little stone that
[2:14:04] have a name of the victory and so when
[2:14:06] these two prophets are killed in the
[2:14:07] street they start celebrating oh my let
[2:14:10] me tell you something Mardi Gras ain't
[2:14:11] got nothing on what they're getting
[2:14:12] ready to throw when they kill them two
[2:14:14] prophets I said if two men can torment
[2:14:16] billions of people on this earth I said
[2:14:19] what would come one child of God full of
[2:14:20] the Holy Ghost due to the devil every
[2:14:21] day of his life hey man let me tell you
[2:14:24] when we leave this earth the devil or
[2:14:26] throw a party he'll be so happy we get
[2:14:29] out of his face because remember the
[2:14:31] only thing that is stopping him from
[2:14:33] taking his throne I'm looking at part of
[2:14:35] him right now you're the only reason why
[2:14:38] Satan cannot move on they'll be so happy
[2:14:40] they'll throw a party about that time
[2:14:43] within three days the spirit of life
[2:14:44] will catch these two prophets and
[2:14:46] they'll be caught up if you want to read
[2:14:48] that in revelation 11 they're caught up
[2:14:49] into a cloud amen because that's where
[2:14:52] the revelation was revealed that in a
[2:14:54] cloud no wonder the devil tries to throw
[2:14:56] it off like his rocket ship smoke they
[2:14:57] don't want to admit the fact that
[2:14:58] everywhere you look in the Bible there's
[2:15:00] a cloud as the cloud as the cloud as the
[2:15:01] cloud as the cloud as the cloud not a
[2:15:03] forward missile but good cloud Amen
[2:15:06] that's right now the merchants of the
[2:15:08] earth they'll get rich but now watch in
[2:15:10] Zechariah chapter 14 verse 2 he said I
[2:15:12] will gather all the nations together
[2:15:15] against Jerusalem to battle the four
[2:15:17] winds that have brought in Armageddon
[2:15:19] came World War one and so forth like
[2:15:22] that but remember though four winds had
[2:15:25] the ability to destroy the earth
[2:15:28] world war one remember that brother been
[2:15:31] taught it like this he said that the
[2:15:32] Armageddon would have taken place in
[2:15:34] World War one but the angel of God in
[2:15:37] the eleventh month the 11th hour of the
[2:15:38] 11th day reached out and stopped the
[2:15:40] four winds and said stop right there
[2:15:42] don't you go no further
[2:15:43] hey man you Canadians remember Flanders
[2:15:46] field
[2:15:46] I meant the Holy Spirit Armageddon would
[2:15:50] have felt or on this nation on this
[2:15:52] world right at that moment but God
[2:15:54] couldn't do it you know why there was
[2:15:56] some sons that needed to be sealed there
[2:15:59] was some daughters that needed to
[2:16:00] receive the Holy Ghost hey man there was
[2:16:03] some redheads and brown heads and
[2:16:05] whatever more heads that needed to get
[2:16:06] the Holy Ghost
[2:16:07] so God held back the winds of war and he
[2:16:11] said don't you touch him until the
[2:16:12] servants of God are sealed in their
[2:16:14] forehead and then has been held off
[2:16:17] waiting for you to get your baptism of
[2:16:19] the Holy Ghost hey man you think God
[2:16:23] don't love you brother you need to take
[2:16:24] another look at it
[2:16:25] amen now all of that power that's been
[2:16:28] held back by this angel in World War 3
[2:16:31] it will be released upon the entire
[2:16:34] earth remember there's three woes for
[2:16:36] war one world war two World War three
[2:16:38] the third world war will be a nuclear
[2:16:41] battle but remember the sixth seal opens
[2:16:45] with an earthquake anybody know where
[2:16:49] the earthquakes supposed to take place
[2:16:50] do you know oh oh that's like I've said
[2:17:03] many times I said like when they slap
[2:17:05] Micah the Prophet and it walked himself
[2:17:07] wide the Spirit of God he said you wait
[2:17:10] and go up to battle you'll see where the
[2:17:11] Spirit of God was at I say to the
[2:17:13] critics if they hear me on YouTube or
[2:17:15] they hear me anywhere in the world I
[2:17:16] don't care where they're at I say to the
[2:17:18] critics you think that we don't have the
[2:17:19] message of the hour you wait till Los
[2:17:21] Angeles's underneath the sea amen and
[2:17:23] you'll find out where the Spirit of God
[2:17:25] went when this message was the truth or
[2:17:27] not
[2:17:28] hey man we won't have to say a word a
[2:17:30] minute a file in the ocean amen now
[2:17:41] after combination of the Battle of
[2:17:43] Armageddon all nations will gather
[2:17:45] against Israel this is where in the
[2:17:47] Bible that the blood in the valley of
[2:17:49] Megiddo run to the horse's bridle
[2:17:51] they'll fight and they'll kill one
[2:17:54] another remember the prophecy questions
[2:17:55] answers his Catholics and his
[2:17:57] Protestants will gather in that valley
[2:18:00] to fight it's a religious war they're
[2:18:03] trying to squash out and stomp out
[2:18:05] anything that's against Jesus Christ and
[2:18:07] the only thing that's left representing
[2:18:10] him is that little nation of Israel
[2:18:11] sitting over there a man who said Israel
[2:18:13] I can't forget you he said you're
[2:18:16] engraved on the palms of my hands
[2:18:18] amen out of billions of people a hundred
[2:18:21] and forty-four thousand is what God
[2:18:23] remembers to some of us we think I'll
[2:18:26] just forget about it and ain't worth the
[2:18:27] time but brother to God 144,000 is more
[2:18:30] precious to him than 144 billion a man
[2:18:34] and a Nathan ninety-nine he said he
[2:18:35] leaves out ninety-nine he goes after
[2:18:37] that one mile sheep there's that lost
[2:18:39] sheep at Israel sitting up there waiting
[2:18:41] on the message of the hour to come her
[2:18:42] away amen and that prophet of God will
[2:18:44] reach out there and he'll start speaking
[2:18:46] these mysteries of God and Moses will be
[2:18:48] taking care of nature Elisha oh shut -
[2:18:50] heavens up my they'll carry on hey man
[2:18:53] we gotta get rid of these guys and
[2:18:55] they'll try to put everything there is
[2:18:56] to put on these two prophets maybe on
[2:18:58] nuclear warhead but come over their head
[2:19:00] and Moses flick it off like he'd be
[2:19:02] flicking off a fly off his shoulder he's
[2:19:04] got the power of the spoken word nothing
[2:19:06] can hurt him Amen until God releases
[2:19:09] their lives to be killed on the street
[2:19:11] but the show that it is the resurrection
[2:19:12] because remember we're in the third
[2:19:14] showdown by this time by the time the
[2:19:16] bride leaves here it is the showdown
[2:19:18] between Jesus and denominations these
[2:19:21] two men though that you're showing great
[2:19:22] powers of God remember as it was with
[2:19:25] Jesus it wasn't the blinded eyes coming
[2:19:27] open it wasn't the speaking to the
[2:19:29] squirrels it wasn't all these other
[2:19:30] things that would brother branham but
[2:19:32] the real proof of the message of the
[2:19:34] hour lay
[2:19:35] in the resurrection Amen Jesus done many
[2:19:38] great works but if he'd been dead in the
[2:19:39] tomb today he was just a man with an
[2:19:42] anointing on him amen but because he's
[2:19:44] alive forevermore and sits at the right
[2:19:46] hand of the Father resurrection proves
[2:19:48] amen that he is our message of the hour
[2:19:51] and light these two prophets they'll do
[2:19:54] great and mighty works the devil can do
[2:19:56] great and mighty works but when the
[2:19:57] resurrection speaks in their body and
[2:19:59] they step up there and receive in the
[2:20:01] cloud resurrection will testify of who
[2:20:03] they really are just like you and I we
[2:20:06] which are alive and remain rapture
[2:20:08] resurrection will speak of who the
[2:20:10] Apostle Paul was a man it'll speak of
[2:20:13] who Wesley was let the critics raise up
[2:20:15] then say well he hated the Jews well I
[2:20:17] guarantee when the revelation opens up
[2:20:19] to Luther he ain't gonna hate him
[2:20:21] amen he'll understand what the message
[2:20:23] was all about why did he do what he did
[2:20:25] because there was no seals open there
[2:20:28] was no truth revealed how could he
[2:20:29] understand that but he couldn't you
[2:20:30] don't know what you don't know amen
[2:20:33] that's right now once you look at this
[2:20:36] now coming in to the valley of megiddo
[2:20:39] they'll be trapped the Catholics and the
[2:20:42] Communists will all be trapped down in
[2:20:45] this valley of megiddo remember the
[2:20:47] Battle of Armageddon will be fought
[2:20:49] right at the gates of Jerusalem well you
[2:20:54] say communism yeah who knows who the big
[2:20:59] bear of the north is as Russia Russia is
[2:21:03] a tool in the hand of God they've got a
[2:21:06] specific purpose you know what their
[2:21:08] purpose is God is going to use them to
[2:21:10] reap judgment against the Catholic
[2:21:11] Church they will drop a bomb on Vatican
[2:21:15] City and destroy it in one hour
[2:21:17] that's thus saith the Lord I just quoted
[2:21:21] to you a man you'll find that in mark of
[2:21:23] the beast' 1956 he also said that
[2:21:26] they're called of God as Nebuchadnezzar
[2:21:28] was is a tool in the hand of God to
[2:21:30] destroy the United States there'll be
[2:21:33] only a small population left on this
[2:21:35] earth after California hits the ocean
[2:21:37] amen and all those waves that tsunami
[2:21:39] will flood right back up into Kentucky
[2:21:42] up through there and then finally
[2:21:43] they'll get Ohio cleaned up
[2:21:46] forgive me amen that wash all the way
[2:21:50] back up amen the deserts will be weeping
[2:21:53] and so forth that water will sweep right
[2:21:55] up in there and then a nuclear bomb will
[2:21:57] attack the United States all of them
[2:21:59] pressure points there'll be just a small
[2:22:01] population of them left W people may be
[2:22:04] living scattered here and there
[2:22:05] amen and what's left they'll gather
[2:22:07] together to go into that valley of
[2:22:09] megiddo and they'll surround themselves
[2:22:11] and that time Russia will be bottleneck
[2:22:13] down inside of there he said remember
[2:22:14] when they go down to get that oil he
[2:22:16] said watch out and be careful is it any
[2:22:18] wonder that today's battle over all of
[2:22:20] these political listen what they're
[2:22:21] talking about more than anything else
[2:22:22] oil oil oil oil oil oil oil
[2:22:25] why that's a prophetic timepiece it's a
[2:22:27] mile marker for us it's a marker on the
[2:22:30] side of the road to let us know that
[2:22:31] when that hour remember Jesus also said
[2:22:33] that the generation that saw Israel
[2:22:35] become a nation will not pass away
[2:22:37] before the coming of the Lord glory to
[2:22:40] God nations are breaking Israel is
[2:22:43] awakening amen the signs that the
[2:22:45] prophets foretold
[2:22:47] hallelujah Gentile days are numbered
[2:22:49] with Horus encumbered return disperse to
[2:22:53] your own Amen come back little bride

[2:22:57] truth father fall in step for the hour
[2:23:00] is almost here amen he said I saw her
[2:23:03] marching as a masterpiece bride walking

[2:23:07] the very end that got out of step it's
[2:23:09] when that voice cried out get back in
[2:23:11] step Amen I kind of believe that's
[2:23:12] what's taking place now amen as always
[2:23:15] see everything scattered every which the
[2:23:16] direction the people being shook every
[2:23:18] which direction
[2:23:19] I believe the voice of God in the
[2:23:20] ministry that voice of many waters is
[2:23:22] after a call and the people of God say
[2:23:24] and stay in line stay in step keep
[2:23:26] sincere don't bow down to these titles
[2:23:28] and things around the message stay with
[2:23:30] the word amen so when he comes to the
[2:23:33] valley of magetta remember the nations
[2:23:35] that stand for Israel will be receiving
[2:23:38] eternal life at the Day of Judgment all
[2:23:40] of those those are the ones in the new
[2:23:42] city that he said took their swords and
[2:23:44] plowed him in the period to beat him
[2:23:47] into plowshares hey man these are the
[2:23:49] ones that stood remember the souls under
[2:23:52] the altar was those Jews killed down
[2:23:53] through World War two but this group
[2:23:56] they're the ones that will stand with
[2:23:57] his
[2:23:58] when all nations will surround against
[2:24:00] him hey man let me tell you something
[2:24:02] brother whoever blesses Israel will be
[2:24:04] blessed whoever curses Israel be cursed
[2:24:07] that holds all the way through to the
[2:24:08] Battle of Armageddon
[2:24:10] now we come into the set that - there's
[2:24:13] three comings of the Lord all right the
[2:24:15] first one to redeem his bride the second
[2:24:17] to receive his bride that's the second
[2:24:19] coming of Jesus Christ then the third he
[2:24:21] comes back with his bride now the hour
[2:24:24] that Israel is going to be challenged
[2:24:26] revelation 19 the bride will come out on
[2:24:29] white horses somebody said to her the
[2:24:31] Brenin one time about seeing his horse
[2:24:33] in heaven hey I made no horses and
[2:24:36] things in heaven and then he said Billy
[2:24:37] Paul wrote him a letter back and said
[2:24:39] then it's plain Revelation 19 he said
[2:24:40] where did they get to him horses riding
[2:24:42] out of Heaven's and I want to explain
[2:24:44] something to you brother I don't know
[2:24:45] brother Branham will be on prints or who
[2:24:46] would be riding but brother amen the
[2:24:48] bride will come out on revelation 19
[2:24:50] should be on white horses that's
[2:24:52] vindicated word she'll be riding in
[2:24:54] Jesus Christ leading the battle and just
[2:24:56] as them nations surrounded or the
[2:24:58] prophet of God said that God will fight
[2:25:00] for Israel like he did in the Old
[2:25:02] Testament hallelujah everything will go
[2:25:04] down in the tribulation and all right ad
[2:25:07] 144,000 and that reelect a group they'll
[2:25:09] enter into the Millennium amen down
[2:25:11] through that thousand-year reign but
[2:25:13] everything goes down at Armageddon
[2:25:16] everything is killed this is Malachi 4
[2:25:18] remember it when he said that the
[2:25:20] righteous shall walk out on the ashes of
[2:25:22] the wicked that takes place right there
[2:25:24] and that's whenever we step out on the
[2:25:26] ashes of the wicked entering into the
[2:25:28] Millennium and the bride will rule with
[2:25:30] a rod of iron
[2:25:31] there'll be nations in the Millenium or
[2:25:33] toward the end of the millennium that
[2:25:35] have never had a chance to hear the
[2:25:36] gospel they were blinded or they were
[2:25:38] you know just every how it was and
[2:25:40] brother branham's son of a his questions
[2:25:42] answers 59 he said that they will preach
[2:25:44] to those nations somewhere toward the
[2:25:46] end of the millennium time will preach
[2:25:48] to those people Amen that that have
[2:25:50] never had a chance and they'll have
[2:25:52] their chance in the Millennium to be
[2:25:53] able to receive it or turn it down you
[2:25:55] say where do you get that Adam and Eve
[2:25:57] did the same thing in God's Millennium
[2:25:59] they had an opportunity to accept or
[2:26:01] reject the gospel
[2:26:02] amen and Eve turned down the gospel for
[2:26:04] Satan's lie in God's Millennium time
[2:26:06] remember a day with the Lord is a
[2:26:08] thousand years thousand years a day so
[2:26:10] there we are in that millennia
[2:26:11] time amen and there as the bride goes
[2:26:15] into the millennium time there'll be a
[2:26:17] thousand year millennial reign now
[2:26:18] remember there's a chain that set around
[2:26:22] Satan The Binding not a long chain now
[2:26:25] like you take your chain up your your
[2:26:27] gear on the back of your truck but it's
[2:26:29] a chain of circumstances Satan has
[2:26:32] nobody he can work through remember last
[2:26:35] night when I thought about self
[2:26:37] deception unless you allow it the devil
[2:26:40] can't harm you will have ain't nobody
[2:26:42] there for the devil to influence he's
[2:26:44] chained I say we put a few chains on him
[2:26:47] today
[2:26:48] amen not allow him to have the ride away
[2:26:51] Amen that's right
[2:26:52] then the Holy Spirit will allow us to
[2:26:56] rule with a rod of iron as we go through
[2:26:58] the millennium time now at the end of
[2:27:00] the millennium we'll take another
[2:27:01] resurrection Jesus spoke about this and
[2:27:04] Saint John when he said all will come to
[2:27:05] all that are in the graves will hear the
[2:27:07] voice of the Son of God and they'll be
[2:27:09] raised son to life and some do damnation
[2:27:11] on the church age book brother BAM goes
[2:27:13] back to Matthew chapter 25 and he speaks
[2:27:15] about it as a shepherd that would divide
[2:27:18] sheep from goats and he said it wasn't
[2:27:19] that they were sheep and he said it
[2:27:21] wasn't that they were goats necessarily
[2:27:22] and that he was a shepherd but he said
[2:27:24] the parable the type is that these are
[2:27:27] the righteous ones that never you know
[2:27:29] done things that would cause him to lose
[2:27:31] life he said well how is it he said well
[2:27:34] when I was in prison you visited me when
[2:27:37] I was hungry you fed me when I was sick
[2:27:39] you come and saw about my needs all
[2:27:42] right I want you listen to me if that is
[2:27:44] the bride of Jesus Christ show me one
[2:27:46] place in the scripture anywhere I
[2:27:47] challenge you to come bring it to me
[2:27:49] showed me one place in the Bible the
[2:27:51] bride has ever saved based on her works
[2:27:54] is there anywhere that Paul ever taught
[2:27:58] your works is what gives you salvation
[2:28:00] you're saved by grace of God you're
[2:28:03] saved as a gift of God but when
[2:28:05] revelation 20 opens up and the books are
[2:28:08] opened up and another book is opened up
[2:28:10] and the white throne judgment opens up
[2:28:11] remember he said the dead are judged
[2:28:13] according to the works of what they did
[2:28:16] that's all they've got left so friends
[2:28:19] don't don't turn down people being good
[2:28:20] to you it might be their only
[2:28:21] opportunity
[2:28:23] I don't know who they are I don't know
[2:28:24] where they come from or what they're all
[2:28:26] about and I can't judge whether what
[2:28:27] they do to me good or ever what it might
[2:28:30] be I can't say well that's gonna give
[2:28:31] him eternal life
[2:28:32] brother Bama said they wasn't even
[2:28:34] conscious of it themself read him on
[2:28:37] that day on Calvary when he was talking
[2:28:38] about eternal life living for others he
[2:28:40] said these people didn't even realize
[2:28:42] they were doing that to Jesus they just
[2:28:45] did it out of the goodness of their
[2:28:46] hearts amen and now they're receiving
[2:28:49] laughs all right so at the end of the
[2:28:50] thousand year millennial reign now
[2:28:52] there's a resurrection that takes place
[2:28:54] this is the second resurrection the Dead
[2:28:57] which go down in that tribulation time
[2:29:00] will be raised in the same body they
[2:29:02] went down in every way they looked
[2:29:04] whatever their situations was every what
[2:29:07] it is they come out in the same body
[2:29:09] they go down in anybody know why cuz
[2:29:12] they ain't got no word body to go to
[2:29:15] there of the earth and they're raised of
[2:29:18] the earth they don't have no glorified
[2:29:20] body amen but here's the bride now
[2:29:23] remember when this resurrection takes
[2:29:25] place at that time the white throne
[2:29:27] judgment begins to set in and the Bible
[2:29:29] said the earth and the heavens fled from
[2:29:31] the face of him that sat on that throne
[2:29:33] he sets that white throne down on this
[2:29:35] earth
[2:29:35] remember judgment takes place here he
[2:29:38] said how do you know that because where
[2:29:40] did it take place the first time God did
[2:29:41] it when Adam and Eve sinned where God
[2:29:44] come to come right to the earth that was
[2:29:48] the first judgement seat of Christ when
[2:29:50] he brought Eve and Adam in the serpent
[2:29:52] before mmm before him and said what
[2:29:54] would you do this for what I the serpent
[2:29:56] gave and I ate and I gave to my husband
[2:29:58] he ate also and he looked at the serpent
[2:30:00] and cast him to the ground all these
[2:30:01] things that was the first judgment seat
[2:30:03] of Christ took place on the earth
[2:30:04] remember any time God does one thing any
[2:30:07] time it all he does anything he always
[2:30:09] keeps it the same way all the way to the
[2:30:10] end and listen they didn't do the Senate
[2:30:12] in the solar system they did the sending
[2:30:14] on the earth so where are they judged at
[2:30:17] in the very place they'd done the
[2:30:18] sinning why are they embodies they went
[2:30:20] down in because that's the bodies had
[2:30:21] done the sinning in their gonna be
[2:30:23] judged in it now let's look up in the
[2:30:25] attorneys box the heaven and the earth
[2:30:28] are scared to death of him it sits on
[2:30:30] the throne but there's one group and at
[2:30:31] whole bunch that ain't flee and
[2:30:34] she ain't scared she ain't worried she
[2:30:36] ain't fearful you know why because she's
[2:30:38] his sweetheart sitting up there in that
[2:30:40] attorney's box glory amen she's not
[2:30:45] afraid of judgment cuz she's already
[2:30:47] took it
[2:30:49] [Applause]
[2:30:50] amen she's already passed judgment she's
[2:30:53] already went to her purgatory she don't
[2:30:55] need to wash her robes it's already been
[2:30:57] washed for her remember revelation 19
[2:31:01] when it said the wife hath made herself
[2:31:03] ready remember she couldn't make herself
[2:31:05] the wife but she could make herself
[2:31:07] ready God's the one made her what she is
[2:31:10] Amen if you got a touch of that in your
[2:31:12] heart right now you ought to be the
[2:31:14] happiest person ever walks she 11 so the
[2:31:16] judgment will be set God will stand
[2:31:18] there on the throne the bride will stand
[2:31:20] there and judge all because you imagine
[2:31:22] say sets his television screen in the
[2:31:23] sky a man he said he says got a tape
[2:31:27] recorder brother Joseph Brenham talked
[2:31:29] about this other day talking about God
[2:31:31] plays tapes you know and and I
[2:31:34] appreciated his thought but I got to
[2:31:36] laughing a little bit and I thought well
[2:31:37] well Joseph that's probably true God
[2:31:40] does have a tape recorder but the
[2:31:41] redness said he records all this stuff I
[2:31:43] thought but who are them preachers
[2:31:45] standing in that attorney box rather
[2:31:46] when that tapes being played what do
[2:31:47] they do a man they're not just up there
[2:31:50] push and play but brother Branham said
[2:31:52] they're standing there judging the
[2:31:53] nations or judging angels they're
[2:31:55] judging things rememeber he said will
[2:31:57] Paul's group be judged remember that
[2:31:59] will Paul he said then my group will be
[2:32:01] judged the same way and they'll make it
[2:32:03] like Paul's group will because I preach
[2:32:05] not played the tape I preach what Paul
[2:32:07] preached amen not being offensive
[2:32:10] brother branham I'm just served brother
[2:32:12] Joseph Brenner but I'm just saying it's
[2:32:13] more than playing tapes when we're
[2:32:16] standing there that attorneys box every
[2:32:17] girl that's ever laugh you've met every
[2:32:19] boy somebody's ever made fun of you
[2:32:20] girls with your long hair you'll be
[2:32:22] standing up there in that attorney's box
[2:32:23] and you'll be able to show judgment I am
[2:32:26] a Christian I am a daughter of God I've
[2:32:28] got to Holy Ghost you not stand there
[2:32:30] bragging you're just telling the truth
[2:32:32] what I always like to you know we've
[2:32:34] always been friends he said all right
[2:32:35] roll the tape and then right there their
[2:32:38] very thoughts are very actions of your
[2:32:40] life and everything they ever thought or
[2:32:41] spoke about she's right here before they
[2:32:42] can't deny it because it's them on the
[2:32:44] tape and listen God don't have altering
[2:32:46] equipment up there
[2:32:47] in heaven amen to alter somebody's face
[2:32:49] or imager and then like at what you see
[2:32:51] is what you get now at that hour
[2:32:53] remember it'll be during the time of
[2:32:55] that white throne judgment there'll be a
[2:32:57] combination of people start gathering
[2:32:59] together and Satan will start gathering
[2:33:01] together a group to rise up against
[2:33:03] Jesus Christ and the new city which is
[2:33:05] the bride at that time there'll be a
[2:33:08] lake of fire remember the lake of fire
[2:33:10] is on this earth it is a natural lake
[2:33:12] that burneth with fire and brimstone
[2:33:15] Jesus spoke about it when he said fear
[2:33:17] not him that have power to kill body
[2:33:20] remember that all right well if the body
[2:33:23] is going to be destroyed remember Hades
[2:33:25] or hell is what we saved the grave so
[2:33:27] when death and hail are cast in the lake
[2:33:31] of fire this habit of the REM said Hans
[2:33:32] future home the fire of God comes out of
[2:33:35] heaven it descends down into this earth
[2:33:37] mingling with this earth down here so
[2:33:40] then death and Hell or what we would say
[2:33:42] the grave or all of these principles of
[2:33:45] of death that we know of there'll be a
[2:33:47] great ball of fire burning around this
[2:33:50] earth and then all of the wicked will be
[2:33:53] cast into that lake of fire to burn for
[2:33:55] billions of years maybe you know brother
[2:33:59] Han said one time he said they could
[2:34:00] burn for a hundred billion years so how
[2:34:05] mean of God it wasn't God that put him
[2:34:07] in that situation the Lord Jesus through
[2:34:10] every roadblock in front of him he could
[2:34:12] possibly do to keep him and forbid him
[2:34:13] from that horrible place they're the
[2:34:15] ones that spit in the face of God and
[2:34:17] said I don't want nothing to do with him
[2:34:18] Amen these many of these people friends
[2:34:21] that are claiming you know I thought
[2:34:23] that snot with the mat and I on the way
[2:34:25] back to the room and you know we was
[2:34:27] talking about people being self deceived
[2:34:29] and I like the comment he made he said
[2:34:30] you know people try to do something
[2:34:32] wrong they won't repent because they've
[2:34:33] justified their own self and the self
[2:34:35] justification why they won't repent they
[2:34:38] won't I'm okay you know everybody sins
[2:34:40] everybody does oh they'll understand
[2:34:41] they justify themselves and the truth of
[2:34:44] the matter is a person knows when he's
[2:34:46] crossing the line between mercy and
[2:34:48] judgment they know their own conscience
[2:34:50] tells them that they're disobeying the
[2:34:51] word
[2:34:53] and yet they're standing right there in
[2:34:55] front of God Oh God Lord I prophesied I
[2:34:58] preached you that's a last-ditch effort
[2:35:00] to try to make one little last cover up
[2:35:02] before God has to tell him the thing
[2:35:04] they already know depart from me because
[2:35:06] I never knew you but they're still even
[2:35:09] if the white throne judgment memory said
[2:35:10] the greatest disappointments will take
[2:35:12] place at the white throne he said
[2:35:13] they'll be standing there he said
[2:35:15] looking at Oh God I was this I was that
[2:35:17] I was the other and got to say none of
[2:35:19] that matters because of this white
[2:35:21] throne and then how good you've lived
[2:35:23] and how wonderful and while these type
[2:35:25] of things
[2:35:25] it's what did you do with your
[2:35:26] opportunity that I gave you I was here
[2:35:28] in this life a man and they squandered
[2:35:30] it they traded it all for a fleet of
[2:35:33] Cadillacs like Elvis or some other thing
[2:35:35] like that amen
[2:35:36] they they they're standing there at this
[2:35:38] white throne judgment and and and hear
[2:35:41] the Spirit of God will begin to descend
[2:35:43] as Satan will beginning to rise up
[2:35:44] that's the Battle of Gog and Magog and
[2:35:46] as he begins to rise up holy fire will
[2:35:49] come out of heaven whoosh write down
[2:35:51] this whole earth and it'll burn and it
[2:35:53] will burn and it'll burn you say well
[2:35:56] that scares me where am I gonna be at
[2:35:57] sea that's the beautiful thing
[2:35:59] there's Jupiter and Saturn and Mars and
[2:36:01] all these other places and we can travel
[2:36:03] like a thought we can go anywhere we
[2:36:04] want to Lydia we just go sit on Mars for
[2:36:06] a little while
[2:36:07] hey man hey man we'll just go hang out
[2:36:09] and and relax and rejoice and just
[2:36:12] praise the Lord for a hundred billion
[2:36:13] billion billion years somebody said well
[2:36:16] I could never enjoy heaven knowing that
[2:36:18] my mama's burning the hell don't forget
[2:36:19] what he said he said when he comes out
[2:36:21] across that table
[2:36:22] he said he'll take his little maybe take
[2:36:24] his garment as he'd wipe the tears out
[2:36:27] of your eye you know dim tears represent
[2:36:28] that amendment they represents your
[2:36:29] memory Amen God will wipe your memory
[2:36:32] I've ever haven't been associated with
[2:36:34] people in time like that amen how could
[2:36:36] you enjoy it knowing that your loved
[2:36:38] ones never made it knowing that people
[2:36:39] you love never made it but he said I'll
[2:36:41] wipe the remembrance of it out of your
[2:36:42] eyes
[2:36:44] hallelujah amen and while you're there
[2:36:46] enjoying heaven you won't think about
[2:36:48] the former things because the Bible said
[2:36:50] the former things will not be remembered
[2:36:53] [Applause]
[2:36:53] [Music]
[2:36:55] now at this time the lake with fire and
[2:36:59] brimstone it burns it kills body but it
[2:37:02] breaks up the spirit and it also breaks
[2:37:04] up the soul until they're completely
[2:37:06] annihilated as though they never began
[2:37:08] in the first place
[2:37:09] God suggests God what they're paying for
[2:37:12] is not his fault he's tried to help and
[2:37:14] try to make him see what's right they're
[2:37:16] paying for it because they chose to be
[2:37:18] this way amen I know people don't
[2:37:20] believe that some people say well no God
[2:37:22] has every right right in the world
[2:37:23] he can force him he could make him but
[2:37:25] prin that's not just if God has to make
[2:37:27] him do anything then that's not justice
[2:37:30] how could he judge him at a white throne
[2:37:32] if he had to force him to live right and
[2:37:33] force them to read their Bible and force
[2:37:35] you to come to church and force you to
[2:37:37] pray that's what I said when we start
[2:37:38] falling under sicknesses and and trials
[2:37:41] and tribulations and people coming
[2:37:43] against us don't be so quick oh this is
[2:37:45] God making me God don't make us do
[2:37:47] nothing brother
[2:37:48] everything we fall in is for the
[2:37:50] perfecting of our character that's the
[2:37:51] only reason he's done it amen at the end
[2:37:54] of this thousand-year millennium comes
[2:37:56] the resurrection second resurrection the
[2:37:58] white throne judgment gog and magog and
[2:38:00] now after all of this has been purified
[2:38:02] and remember Hebrews 11 tells us that
[2:38:05] the worlds were framed by the Word of
[2:38:07] God so the earth is an attribute of God
[2:38:10] hey man I ain't got time to get to it
[2:38:13] but I'm gonna get him on catch a high
[2:38:14] spot amen but when he's when he comes

[2:38:28] earth will be completely renovated all
[2:38:31] together it will not be destroyed the
[2:38:33] earth is an attribute of God at its core
[2:38:37] there is a core in the earth that has
[2:38:40] spoken Word of God just like God can't
[2:38:43] burn you away because that's your core
[2:38:44] his spoken word of God hallelujah amen
[2:38:50] how could God get rid of his attributes
[2:38:52] he can't get rid of the earth he can't
[2:38:53] get rid of you amen the reason all of
[2:38:56] these planets and all this stuff will

[2:44:45] marvel at them but let me tell you
[2:44:48] something brother
[2:44:48] five minutes of having to suffer
[2:44:50] torments of the body ain't nothing
[2:44:52] compared to having to deal with what we
[2:44:54] deal with on an everyday basis this is
[2:44:57] the greatest battle ever fought we are
[2:44:58] assaulted in a way that they could never
[2:45:00] understand never experienced but let me
[2:45:02] tell you the overcoming power is in this
[2:45:04] bride amen to not just save her but the
[2:45:07] entire world in future events all depend
[2:45:10] upon us making our capstone adoption
[2:45:14] we are the link if there was a missing
[2:45:17] link we are it oh we are the missing
[2:45:25] link of everything that lays out there
[2:45:27] we are the link between the generations
[2:45:30] past and for the generations future it
[2:45:32] all rides upon what we do no wonder they
[2:45:38] ask for the Brennan or he made it you
[2:45:40] know almost like a is a query you know
[2:45:42] brother ham what age would you have

[2:45:45] day he should have been this day oh and
[2:45:51] I Got News for you I'm not a brand
[2:45:55] ambassador like some people are I'm
[2:45:58] proud of brother branham cuz I gots I
[2:46:01] Got News for him will tell you something
[2:46:02] brother branham said that whenever Jesus
[2:46:05] comes to this earth he said he'd go to
[2:46:06] brother Brennan first he said and then
[2:46:09] brother Brennan would come back with all
[2:46:10] them Saints and we would meet every
[2:46:12] single one I'm because see God will come
[2:46:14] to the messenger of the age the leader

[2:46:37] corner and getting on an airplane and
[2:46:38] flying around amen all about your
[2:46:41] man-made doctrine we are the reason that
[2:46:44] Jesus would even send him back to this
[2:46:46] earth in the first place
[2:46:48] because once the bride comes to her
[2:46:50] place once she comes to her position
[2:46:52] then like all Eagles do we gather with
[2:46:54] our leader on the other side these
[2:47:00] future events now I don't mind telling

[2:47:07] message they're only looking through a
[2:47:09] keyhole of what is truth they only see a
[2:47:12] small little spot of what they think
[2:47:13] this age is all about but I'm gonna tell

[2:47:30] that because they won't be one Bob here

[2:47:34] one cigarette sucking gangbanger over
[2:47:36] there but there Chad there won't be none
[2:47:38] of them Hindus over there brother Faisal

[2:47:47] fighting there won't be none of these
[2:47:48] critics over there brother jail Amen

[2:48:09] that new city won't be nothing but young
[2:48:11] people there hey man I might even get to
[2:48:13] keep my beard hallelujah hey hey oh
[2:48:21] thank you Jesus
[2:48:23] nah listen to this 2nd Thessalonians 2:9
[2:48:26] the Bible said that he would consume him
[2:48:28] with the spirit of his mouth revelation
[2:48:31] 19:15 out of his mouth when a two-edged
[2:48:33] sword is that any wonder that he says in
[2:48:36] the last day he said she the bride under
[2:48:39] her messenger will be the final voice to
[2:48:42] the final age everything depends on how
[2:48:45] you talk to get your talking straight
[2:48:48] you got to get your thinking straight to
[2:48:50] get your thinking straight you got to
[2:48:51] get your heart straight it takes
[2:48:53] preachers to get that it takes you
[2:48:56] reading your Bible praying and lame
[2:48:57] before the presence of God takes you
[2:48:58] coming to church and having prayer
[2:49:00] meetings and listen to your pastor and
[2:49:01] obeying the teachers and digging in the
[2:49:03] revelation takes you obeying God
[2:49:05] submitting yourself surrendering
[2:49:07] yourself cuz once your heart gets right
[2:49:09] then your thinking can get right amen as
[2:49:11] I told you Friday night you just don't
[2:49:13] realize who you are yet Church a me
[2:49:15] because if you realize who you are
[2:49:16] you'll come to a spot to where that you
[2:49:18] won't take no prisoners and you won't
[2:49:20] take no for an answer
[2:49:21] amen and you will not let the devil stop
[2:49:23] you because brother Branham said when we
[2:49:25] come to adoption
[2:49:26] he said the sons of God will stop had a
[2:49:28] drink I'm back that the devil's taken
[2:49:31] from them they'll take this world back
[2:49:32] in their hand because the Bible said the
[2:49:34] meek shall inherit this earth
[2:49:36] amen the spirit of their mouth what they
[2:49:39] speak is gonna be backed up by Almighty
[2:49:42] God that's why one of these days I'm
[2:49:44] gonna raise up and I'm gonna be looking
[2:49:47] in the mirror I'm gonna feel a little
[2:49:48] something from heaven and I say okay
[2:49:51] buddy you you tormented me enough you've
[2:49:54] aggravated me enough time for you to get
[2:49:56] down to business change amen brother
[2:50:00] Branham said we would speak our own
[2:50:01] resurrections that's what he said he
[2:50:05] said we would speak to our bodies you
[2:50:06] say well ain't possible
[2:50:07] innit whenever you're sick and you got a
[2:50:10] sickness in your body brother brems said
[2:50:11] you dismiss that sickness in about like
[2:50:13] a general would dismiss his troops I
[2:50:15] dismiss you from my body a man you say
[2:50:18] well what if you don't go the orders
[2:50:19] still given a man it's just a matter of
[2:50:23] time for the Holy Spirit to do what he's
[2:50:24] got to do amen the body will have to
[2:50:27] obey the spoken word of the bride of
[2:50:29] Jesus Christ remember you're hunting you
[2:50:31] want game yes Monica lips but I've
[2:50:33] always said it's your word he said but
[2:50:34] whatever you say he said Lord is that
[2:50:37] what that meant all these years could
[2:50:38] this be that third Pole he said glory to
[2:50:41] God hallelujah amen what is it all about
[2:50:45] brother it's about you coming to your
[2:50:46] position of authority it's about you
[2:50:49] recognizing the vision that this whole
[2:50:51] thing is not about you understanding
[2:50:52] what a white horse looks like or what
[2:50:54] our plague looks like the whole thing as
[2:50:57] we say on home the whole enchilada
[2:50:59] hallelujah amen it's all about yeah
[2:51:02] that's what it's all about it's about
[2:51:03] you the reason Christ came the reason
[2:51:07] Christ condescended the reason Christ
[2:51:09] died the reason Christ was buried the
[2:51:11] reason Christ resurrected the reason the
[2:51:12] message was sent the reason we're going
[2:51:14] to a new city you you you you praise God
[2:51:20] future events amen
[2:51:24] well I can't say I'll have to close
[2:51:27] because I've got nothing else to preach
[2:51:30] I've got hours here amen but let you get
[2:51:34] to jest to the message Amen I believe it
[2:51:37] with all my heart
[2:51:38] one last thing I'm gonna tell you for we
[2:51:40] quit one last thing
[2:51:41] first Thessalonians 5 verse 2 he tells
[2:51:45] us that he'll come to us as a thief in
[2:51:46] the night
[2:51:48] remember the rapture itself will not be
[2:51:50] a public show twist about the third pool
[2:51:53] so it won't be an open show won't be a
[2:51:55] published show the rapture he said will
[2:51:57] be like Romeo and Juliet he said one day
[2:52:00] he said Romeo put his ladder up at her
[2:52:03] window amen Romeo Romeo wherefore art
[2:52:07] thou Romeo and see the bride speaks out
[2:52:11] Here I am Here I am and it'll be the way
[2:52:13] he'll come as a secret catching away
[2:52:17] it'll be such a secret that the whole
[2:52:19] world will miss it when it happens and
[2:52:21] it'll be done in such a manner that the
[2:52:24] only ones that receive it
[2:52:25] are the ones that are looking for it
[2:52:28] well how do you know what to look for if
[2:52:31] there's no message to show you how to
[2:52:33] see it that's why we've got a message
[2:52:36] today so that we can see what God's
[2:52:39] gonna do it's a lens if you will
[2:52:42] it's binoculars into the future we can
[2:52:45] see everything every move that God's
[2:52:47] gonna make we know I removed the devil's
[2:52:49] gonna make you realize the Satan is
[2:52:52] Satan the devil himself Satan cannot
[2:52:54] Bluff us when the whole world rumor
[2:52:56] revelation 12 the whole world wonders
[2:52:58] after the Beast the whole world is
[2:52:59] deceived remember that he deceives the
[2:53:02] whole world there not a one of them that
[2:53:04] don't fall under his devices but there's
[2:53:06] a little group but don't you know why
[2:53:09] she's done read the back of the book she
[2:53:13] knows how it ends so well the Pope we
[2:53:17] worried about no Pope
[2:53:18] World Council of Churches hey no problem
[2:53:21] me Oh aren't you afraid about took about
[2:53:24] people tell me all the time aren't you
[2:53:26] afraid about the economy collapsing then
[2:53:27] shutting our doors and that's having to
[2:53:29] live on the streets and that's how I
[2:53:31] said I don't believe the bride will see
[2:53:32] a bit of that I believe about the time
[2:53:34] that squeeze goods are coming on have
[2:53:36] you ever been in the shower please tell
[2:53:37] me you have been at some time in your
[2:53:38] life have you ever been in a shower and
[2:53:41] you got a bar of soap in your hand you
[2:53:42] know Tom mountain and your hands all wet
[2:53:45] and the soaps all lathery and we're so
[2:53:47] good you try to give her a good squeeze
[2:53:49] like that you pop you ever had that
[2:53:51] happen to you Paul come on yeah he
[2:53:53] showers don't he please tell me he does
[2:53:55] all right
[2:53:56] Laurie that's why I believe it'll be
[2:54:00] with the bride now we may see pressure
[2:54:02] come that's true but remember the bride
[2:54:04] is not purified by shutting doors and
[2:54:06] bombs dropping and all this other stuff
[2:54:08] I believe this squeeze will get like
[2:54:10] that it'll squeeze squeeze squeeze
[2:54:11] squeeze squeeze and before the devil can
[2:54:12] really clench this grip will put right
[2:54:14] out of here in a moment and the twinkle
[2:54:18] and I I've been waiting all in my life
[2:54:20] to say this to the devil now you see me
[2:54:22] now you don't so we'll come to the spot
[2:54:34] where our Romeo will call us out of here
[2:54:37] we got to be ready we got to be ready
[2:54:40] our garments have to be washed we have
[2:54:42] to be ready it's like you know we've
[2:54:44] told the story a million times as
[2:54:46] preachers and people we've talked about
[2:54:47] that story of the rancher and how she
[2:54:49] couldn't wrinkle her dress and she was
[2:54:50] standing waiting on him I always love
[2:54:53] this part whenever he shows up he comes
[2:54:55] with his wagon and you know have you
[2:54:57] ever seen a wagon in the Old West
[2:54:59] I do a little work seasonally every now
[2:55:03] and then for some of the third graders
[2:55:04] third fourth and fifth graders in
[2:55:05] California and they do their state
[2:55:08] testing and it's just for a few weeks
[2:55:10] out of the year and I grade their
[2:55:12] testing we do a holistic type grading
[2:55:13] where you just say you don't say like an
[2:55:16] ABCD F but you you kind of give them a
[2:55:18] grade where okay this was pretty good
[2:55:20] this is you know and then have ten other
[2:55:21] people look at it and that's how they do
[2:55:23] their testing and so to be able to get
[2:55:25] an idea about how you're supposed to
[2:55:27] grade them they give you about all I
[2:55:28] could give you about five or six pieces
[2:55:30] information and they give you all these
[2:55:31] little prompts that you got to follow
[2:55:33] and a couple years ago they started in
[2:55:36] on stage coaches and I've never even
[2:55:39] thought about this until I started
[2:55:40] reading that little prompt and said that
[2:55:42] the stage coaches they had to perform in
[2:55:44] a certain manner when they was
[2:55:45] approaching to see you're getting ready
[2:55:47] to make a stop because there was a dust
[2:55:48] cloud that followed that stagecoach
[2:55:50] whenever it showed up and I thought oh
[2:55:53] god I thought one day our ranchers going
[2:55:56] to come amen and when he shows up he's
[2:55:59] going to have a cloud around him
