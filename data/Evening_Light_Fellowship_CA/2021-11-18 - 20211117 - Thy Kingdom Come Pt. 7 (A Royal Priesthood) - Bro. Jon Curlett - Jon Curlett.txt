changed heavenly father lord to build up line upon line and word upon word lord until we reach that stature of a perfect man and woman in christ our god so we pray you'd have your way this evening lord i'm sure many are tired lord this evening but lord we ask your grace your presence to be with us lord to anoint the speaking of your word lord in the hearing of your word alike heavenly father we pray ask in your grace lord many serious needs brought before us tonight lord god may your holy spirit just move on lives and embodies lord in situations lord we're trusting your grace in each one now in your name we ask and pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians that'll be it my voice is still quite gone from all the singing we did this weekend so i don't want to sing any more than i have to because i still have to preach yet amen god bless you if you'll turn the scriptures to first peter chapter two first peter chapter two amen certainly want to add a couple more prayer requests uh some of you probably heard brother gerald had shared it with me and of course with brother stephen hannah here sister hannah here they've had quite a bit of flooding in bc and i the update i got last is that nobody none of the believers have been hurt but uh and none of their properties have been damaged yet but certainly some of them have been evacuated so we'll see what goes there but certainly want to remember them and of course brother stephen's sister hannah's they're traveling brother merle and sister roberta i'm not sure if they've reached home yet or not they left pretty early this morning so yeah okay all right so their chances are they're fine amen amen praise the lord for that and wanted to bring greetings of course uh brother matt and i returned from our hunting trip successfully by god's grace um brother matthew only hunted for 45 minutes and i took a little longer to to do it amen but we had our moose in in record time i think and so we're very thankful for that i bring greetings back from uh brother tony and his wife brother eugene and sister millie young brother chris and sister ruth wells brother barry's sister darlene and you know a number of others that we met there so and then wanted to mention that over the pulpit before we start this morning amen or this evening first peter 2 verse 9 it says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light amen may god had the may god had the his blessing to the reading of his word man it's a it's been a long week amen and it's been a long time since i've preached it feels like you get used to kind of cruising along up here every week and all of a sudden you go away and you you don't know which which which one's the new testament which one's the old testament i think amen amen it has been some time since i preached and so god grant me grace this morning like i said my voice is a little out of it this this evening as well and just trusting that um trusting that he'll be with us amen amen we i thought we were done with the men when i last spoke and i was talking to some of the brothers outside and i said you know there's a couple things kind of that have just been lurking in the back of my mind and not sure what would happen with that so um the way it is is we're going to keep talking to the men for a little bit no but again as usual what we're talking about tonight is not just for the men it's very much a part of the sisters and we'll see that more as we start to to minister to them a little bit later amen but tonight i want to take a a title of a royal priesthood amen and when we start talking about priesthood we automatically start thinking about men but when we look at this royal priesthood we'll say it's not exclusive to men but certainly if the men don't have it then we're going to see a very big struggle with the woman amen amen and last two services we spoke on if you remember the jehovah gyra attribute of god and how that needs to come into the man and he has to take seriously that that that provision for his family for the local body for the ones that are around the needy and these different things like that and then we see that every man no matter how great he is no matter how gifted he is no matter how strong he is no matter how intelligent he is or how educated he is he gets to a place if he's a real believer and he says lord i don't have what i need amen i've come to a situation i've come to a realization that what you're looking for in this situation i don't have amen i don't have the intelligence i might have some thoughts i might have some ideas i might have some inclinations but lord i don't have a clear vision i don't have a clear idea i don't have a clear understanding of what it is that's required in this situation and so lord i'm asking you to come into my situation and i'm coming to you and as james said i'm going to ask you for wisdom on how to deal with the things that are going on in my life amen and it can range all the way from the most carnal things of of you know where do i live and what house do i buy and what car do i buy all the way up to where do i attend church what ministry do i support where do i pay my tithes you know what kind of hobbies do i have how do i raise my kids how do i discipline my kids what wife should i should i marry you know what husband should i marry for the women of these different things like that amen but we had to recognize in those situations that we do all things through christ who strengthens us amen and when if we could come to that place of realizing that a lot sooner i think in situations we'd probably get through the the the things that we face in life a lot quicker because all he's looking for so often is for us to realize that we don't have what it takes outside of him and meant so often what he's doing is he's putting situations in our lives so that we'll realize that we've got to be reliant on him because he is the great husband he is the great provider he is the great bridegroom in our lives amen but so much of what we've been talking about i guess it's a bit ironic that we're in church and we're preaching and we've covered a lot of things about the physical we've talked about the you know the way the man has to be a provider and he has to be able to work and he has to take the responsibility of the family on his shoulders and these things but we know that that is not the the most important thing amen it does it's no good the scripture says what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world but lose his soul amen so if he makes all the money in the world if he provides a great home if he if he takes his family on good vacations they have all the clothes and food that they could ever imagine but if their souls are not taken care of then he still failed in his jehovah gyra attribute amen he has failed in that idea of being the head of the household that's supposed to provide all of those needs amen or facilitate it we know a man cannot do it a husband cannot provide every need for his wife or for his children amen but he is supposed to be under the authority of one that can provide all of those needs but he's supposed to be bringing us to the place where god can meet us amen he's supposed to be pointing the family in the direction of the word of god so that when they come into their needs then they know that he's not looking to himself but he's looking to god and he's looking to the word for those things amen what we want to get to is a place where we're living by divine decree amen where we're not living by our own thoughts we're not living by what the world tells us that we should do but we're living by the divine decree which is what it is the word of god amen brother steve and i were talking and we were talking about the simplicity of god's leadership and we were talking about you know some of the more supernatural things dreams and visions and that you know and and he was saying you know he said i'm so glad we have the word he says because most of what we need is right here in fact all of what we need is right here god never promised that you'd have to have a dream or a vision in your life but he did say i've given you a word that'll take you in a rapture amen and so so often what happens is we over spiritualize something and we're looking for something that's hidden in here in plain view if we'd only just get in there meditate on it and that's what brother steve was talking about was that need to meditate and dwell on the things of god and give god a chance to come in and speak to you and show you a direction in your life amen amen we talked last time about how in the the old testament the decree was be fruitful and multiply and then we see in mark 16 where it went from be fruitful and multiply physically and have lots of children and become a great nation he said now go you into all the world and preach the gospel amen and it was now about bringing in spiritual children not about bringing in physical children amen which was a great relief to fathers in this generation because you can't have children all the time and make it through and then it's too difficult to do it so now we have a commission to go in and get the the spiritual children get the spiritual seed of god that are in the earth and that's our great goal now is to bring forth spiritual seed not physical seed in our lives amen but we started with this scripture here in first peter 2 9 for a reason because we see here a beautiful picture of the role of the bride of christ i mean this is a beautiful picture of what her purpose is of what she is what it is that she has and then the effect of what she she uh of what comes out of her if she's found in this sort of thing you know and peter says but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation and a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light so he's not talking to the jews here now peter's talking to the gentiles only these are people that are not jews they are not supposed to be a part of the priesthood amen this is a big picture of you like we talked about and he says the first thing we are is a chosen generation and then before you or anything else he says you're a chosen generation and we read this in ephesians when we were doing our series there and he said blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ amen what a place for the believer to be is that every spiritual blessing that god has is available to you there is nothing held back from the children that he has today there's nothing held back from the bride of this age but it says now in verse 4 according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be two things holy and without blame before him in love what what peter's saying here is he says you are chosen for a purpose and that purpose was to be holy and that purpose was to be blameless and it was under the umbrella of god's love amen it is always god's love that brings us to these things it is not our action it is not as our idea amen we did not choose god god chose us and because he chose us we could respond to him when he called us amen you had to have something inside of you david called it the deep color to the deep there had to be something inside of you to respond and that inside of you that responds is of god's choosing and then it was of god's placing it was of god's thinking in in before things were ever uh coming into creation before the world ever began amen it was god's choosing that brought us to this and it's grace that brings us to this place every single time and he said i won't lose a one jesus said all that you've given me i won't lose any of them amen so it's his choosing that brings us to a place of being holy and blameless amen so it's his whole his choosing that makes us holy amen we are not holy again because of our actions we sit here and we say i've got the holy ghost i've got the the message of the hour that is not wake what makes us holy amen it will never make you holy what makes you holy is that he took on your unrighteousness so that you could have his and he gave you his place when he took yours amen so our holiness is through the shed blood of christ and the holy spirit that is within us that gives us the very life that we're looking for amen and the thing that brings us there like i said is what it's his love it's his elective love it's his predestinated love that that elected us before the foundation of the world but then it's his sacrificial love that provides the blood that covers us and makes us holy amen that there is nothing that he can see he can't see anything we do as long as we're under that blood amen as long as we stay there as long as we apply that token to our lives he can't see our sin but it's been put in the sea of our in god's forgetfulness from the very beginning and we just have to keep on in our mind that we shouldn't be bringing it up amen once we put it under we don't bring it up we say lord i'm sorry i repent i'm putting it under the blood and then we don't bring it up again because when you bring it up again he doesn't remember it and he says what are you talking about my son what are you talking about my daughter amen it's in the sea of his forgetfulness and it's a supernatural thing that you're going against when you try and bring it up to him he can't remember and you're reminding a supernatural god of something that he knows nothing about if he can't remember it it doesn't exist so don't talk about it amen put it under the blood that's true justification is when you realize you didn't do it right when he can't remember it that means you never did it in the first place as brother branham said amen amen but beyond that we were a chosen people but then he says you're a royal priesthood now that's no small thing for a jew because the priesthood was special and then the priesthood came from a special line of people they had to have special qualifications you could be born into the tribe of levi but that didn't automatically make you a priest that could handle the word amen they had to have what they had to have a an unblemished body they couldn't have you know missing fingers they couldn't have a stub arm they couldn't have one side shorter than the other they couldn't have large moles in these things on their on their faces they they had to be a representation of holiness but they weren't holy in and of themselves and they absolutely weren't royal there was nothing royal about the levitical priesthood they were just a priesthood that was there to represent the people before god amen they were chosen but they weren't royal and peter says you're chosen but he says you're a royal priesthood and believe me there's a difference between a priesthood and a royal priesthood as we'll talk about it a bit but when we look at the levitical priesthood in numbers 18 it says and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land that's the land of israel neither shalt thou have any part among them everybody got land except for the levites but he says i am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel so we see a type here remember the old testament is always a type and the new testament is fulfillment to that type amen we see a shadow testament so the old testament type is that you don't have an inheritance except the god that you serve but they never had the god that they served right everything they had to go through a veil to get to him and they only could come into his presence one time a year and only one man could go into that presence one time a year so it was very much elective it was very much selective it was very much elite but it was not universal by any means but there's a special thing there because he said i am your inheritance so when we look for our type we're going to see that that has to be our inheritance as well if we're a priesthood amen brother braham says this he says in the old testament there was a veil that hung between the holy place and the holiest of holies only aaron alone was to go in there once a year now the high priest went in he's talking about aaron because in it you know early on aaron was the one that went in but later on what happened was every year they'd have a different high priest and so they'd have a chance to go in and so every man had the opportunity by lot yo so basically they do a lottery and a man and get picked and he was a high priest for the year right so that man could go in but he says but every man that became a priest could have a bite or a taste of the original manna that moses and aaron picked up that first day that the manna began to fall from heaven he says when they crossed the red sea their enemies was killed they were behind them and the next day they went out and all over the ground laid little wafers god rained it down out of heaven they called it manna and it tasted like honey sweet in your mouth but sour in your belly and the peop and the people were just supposed to pick up enough to last them for that one day if they kept it over it contaminated and god told moses and aaron to go out and pick up several overflows of it great baskets and take it by the ark in the holy place so they did this as a commemoration of god's provision and he said gather it up and put it in a pot in the holy place and leave it there but remember he says outside of the holy place it would get brother brahm says he'd get worms in it right it would go bad it'd get maggots in it right it was no good the next day but in the presence of the holy of holies he says and there every time after that generation not after that day he's pointing down generations of priesthoods every generation following that long as long as that levitical priesthood would last i suppose that every man that was eligible to become a priest when he was ordained a priest he had the perfect right to receive a mouthful of the original manna think of it what a privilege that the men thought they would have when a man know that he was coming into the priesthood he was going to get a mouthful of supernatural baked supernatural stirred up supernatural food that came from god out of heaven that had been kept supernaturally everything about this was supernatural it was god's supernatural provision and then it was god's super vigil super natural refrigeration if you could put it to keep it fresh to keep it from going bad in there amen they could always go back to the original that's what we want to talk about here is they could always go back to the original manner from the original source when everything else had gone bad if they were in the presence of god what they got was the original and it never went bad and it never ran out that's the beauty of it is it kept full it kept filling the pot right they didn't eat a wafer and then there was no more left and after a couple years it was all gone god kept it continually refreshed and fresh in his presence and as long as they came into the presence where it was just him and god then that was fresh and he could eat it every time and every man that came in there had the same opportunity amen now peter takes us and he's pointing to this and he says now you are not just a priesthood you're a royal priesthood now what is it that makes us royal we can see priesthood because we can see what we're doing and we're handling the word of god and we're doing the different things maybe that a priest would do is certainly in tight but what makes us royal priesthood we go back to what peter said to what they said in the book of numbers and he says i am your part and what happened on the day on the day of pentecost was peter comes out and he says now we are part of a royal priesthood why because he has experienced the reality of the i am your part and i am your portion because he's had what he's had an infilling of the very life of god and the first things he comes down to he comes out and does is he starts to handle the word of god and he starts to do what he starts to intercede with the people he starts to bring forth a sacrifice out of his mouth he starts to preach the word of god and he's not even a priest what is it he's a royal priest now he's got the king in the camp of his own life and now that makes him royalty because he has the royalty inside of him amen amen when the holy spirit fell then all of a sudden there was a change in their position and they weren't just uh you know fishermen that could barely write their name if they could write it at all they weren't unlearned men but now they were experienced men by the holy spirit and they started to do things that they never thought that they could do before it was what the ordination of the royal priesthood coming out of the coming out of the upper room amen brother braham says this he says the whole ministry is a supernatural he's talking about the ministry of the bride here he says the whole ministry is a supernatural how can people ever say that they are christians and deny the supernatural i don't know how they do it myself look but a supernatural he got a swallow of the supernatural as soon as he became a priest what a beautiful type of now that every person he says them days they had to be born in a certain lineage a levite before they become a priest but now it's whosoever will let him come in he says see and as soon as they come though they must he says a birth is considered in it also you must be born again and every man or woman that's born again of the spirit of god has a right for this day the manna he says this manna is the holy spirit amen amen remember what brother steve was talking about he said remember jesus was saying unless you eat my breath eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life you have no life inside of you amen you're dead in your sins you're dead in your religion you can sit in here in church all day long you can play the tapes you can read the books but until you have the life until you have the manna until you have the holy spirit inside of you you're not a part of this royal priesthood he says and you have no access now you have no access because only the priesthood has access to the holy of holies if you'll remember amen and he says what every man or woman we're talking to the men because men are in leadership positions in the church and in their homes and they're the ones that take the forefront of it but he says every man or woman can be a part of this priesthood amen there's no limitations on it you don't have to be an adult to be a part of this priesthood all you have to do is have a taste of the manna of the holy spirit in your life amen amen so if that's the original manna he's pointing us to is the very life of christ it's the holy spirit the question is what do we do with supernatural food amen we eat natural food and then what are we supposed to do with it we're supposed to put it into action and then sometimes we do what we sit on the couch and we do nothing but when we see this supernatural manner when we see the holy spirit falling down and the word becoming a reality are we supposed to sit on the couch and do nothing with it no we're supposed to put it into action amen we're supposed to take it and leverage it into doing something for the kingdom of god that's what we saw happened on the day of pentecost amen when we eat natural food we do natural things when we eat supernatural food we're supposed to do supernatural things amen we're supposed to do things that are relating to a supernatural kingdom not to a natural kingdom amen so if you're eating something supernatural then you're going to be doing something supernatural if you're eating of the supernatural word if you're living by the supernatural power of the holy spirit in your life then as a priest you're going to be doing supernatural things relating to god amen it's not going to be carnal it's going to be not it's going to be supernatural amen remember brother steve said he says you can't live unless you eat so the thing is what are we eating today are we eating from the supernatural source of the holy spirit and the word of god or eating from the the natural things of life because what we do in our lives will reflect what we've been spending our time in amen we'll be reflected in what we eat will be what we're doing because if you're not eating supernatural food you're not going to be doing supernatural things that's for sure and then so if we're carnal it's because we've been doing carnal eating and if we're being spiritual then it's because we've been doing spiritual things amen we've been eating from us a spiritual buffet if we want to put it that way amen steve talked about that you remember he was talking about join he talked about that story that brother braham spoke of this spring and he says little spring why are you doing this why are you so bubbly why is there something that just you never stop and he was talking about the joy of the lord and it's because there's more in you than you can contain and so it has to come out somehow and he says this is what we're talking about is when you eat of the supernatural it cannot be contained in the natural and so it's got to keep coming forth out of you and that's what people see in your life is the outflowing of the supernatural holy spirit in your life that you can't contain right and why would you want to contain it i loved your prayer brother dave where he said what he was talking about you are what epistles you're seeing of all men what is it it's the supernatural holy spirit that's bubbling up inside of you and you can't keep it from coming out no matter what our situation is you can't keep it from coming out amen that's how we're supposed to be spiritually is that there's a bubbling it's not always a geyser it's not always this big eruption but it's always going amen there's always something that's coming out of our life and it's something that people can look at and see they're different no matter what's going on they're different amen they don't go up and down with the way things are going they aren't pulled to the left they're pulled to the right they're not easily swayed they've got a focus they've got a purpose and no matter what comes their way no matter what you say to them they always respond kindly they always respond with patience you can't get them worked up you can't make them talk bad about other people amen jesus said in john 4. he's talking to the woman at the well and he says jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life and the woman said unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw amen amen you'll amen so many times we're talking to the men tonight mainly but this is not exclusive to the men how many times in jesus life when he walked on this earth was he talking to women it was always a type showing that this is not about gender anymore and we'll see that when we get into the sisters that he was bringing them to a place that they had never been allowed to before through the jewish religion and the jewish traditions amen he was bringing them to a place where they could be heard where they could be recognized where their faith could be put into action and where they they were not identified only by their husbands it meant that they could be spiritual that they could have an effect in the local body in these things but here you have a woman of ill repute and he comes to her he goes out of her his way he says i must needs go by samaria to speak to a woman that's going to respond to my word amen amen this is a far bigger royal priesthood than what they had in the in the levitical times amen this is way bigger than what they had and it's because they're a royal priesthood they have so much more power than they ever did everything for them was just tradition it was tradition and the only thing that wasn't tradition was when they went into the presence of god because that's where you had to be careful but everything else it was just by rote we do this and we do this and we do this we do this but when you went into that presence of god that's where the supernatural was occurring amen it was a special time it was a special place but when christ died that veil was torn and it represented access to all men women children boys girls didn't matter who you are the when the veil was torn everybody had full access to this priesthood amen amen and then we come into the book of acts and it wasn't just a type anymore it wasn't just for particular people it was for every single one it wasn't theoretical anymore everything was theoretical to that point wasn't it they're always looking for something guess what we don't have to look for something anymore it's here right now it's been here for for two 2000 years ever since the day of pentecost he meant that we have a reality of god amen we have moved into the reality where he is our actual portion it's not just a promise that i'll give you a land and i'll give you a home and i'll keep your enemies off you but now we have a god that we pray to it one on one we don't have to go through a man we don't have to come to a pastor we can go directly to god we don't have to come to jerusalem we don't have to come to church we don't have to go and lay ourselves at a ministry but we have access to a god because he has put himself directly inside of us and we carry him everywhere we go amen we don't have to look to some place we don't have to pray to jeffersonville we don't have to pray to jerusalem right we don't have to look towards this place we can reach we could we don't even have to drop to our knees we can just talk to him anytime we want and we have 24 7 access because we are a royal priesthood amen and like we said you became royalty when he came into you but the thing is you always were royalty it's because you were royalty that he came into you in the first place amen because you were a child of god you always were a part of god and all he's doing is confirming to you he's letting you know you always were a part of me amen and that's why you have access today amen even simeon who recognized jesus and blessed him didn't have the holy ghost it said the holy spirit was upon him it was an anointing but it was not an indwelling and he was a priest he was a priest he worked there but he didn't have it in him he just had it on him and it was enough for him to recognize and that was all he had but now we have a reality that even simeon didn't have in his great revelation and recognizing god peter had a greater revelation than simeon ever did because it was in him and he was doing things in peter that peter knew he could never do by himself amen now you say so what it's great brother jonathan we're royal we're a priesthood we're a royal priesthood so what what does that do for us how do we apply it does it even matter today whether you know if you're a part of the royal priesthood does it matter if a man knows if he's a member of the royal priesthood well absolutely he does amen brother brahm said this he says did you ever know what a priesthood is what his office is he says a priest is to make sacrifice and to make intercession and over in hebrews it said that we the church is the royal priesthood a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people see a holy nation peculiar people royal priesthood he says offering here it is now he says offering spiritual sacrifices every man and woman that comes into the comes to god enters into the veil i did a little bit of study on the veil that hid the holy of holies from everything else and we know it had the badger skins on it we think that's really what damped the sound do you know how thick the veil was we tend to think of it was just a badger skin and with a you know maybe some backing cloth on or something do you know how thick it was it was three feet thick and what they did is they had it wasn't one curtain you had the badger skins on here and so you'd have the badger skins like this and then what they'd have is they'd have a curtain that went like this then you'd have a curtain that went like that and then one that went like that and then one that went like that and that and they overlapped it's what we in in seals in engineering it's called tortured path and the idea is the sound can never get through because there's never a straight path through it so a priest to get in there he had to fight his way to get into the holy of holies it didn't just part it wasn't just like okay guys pull back on the strings and let me in he had to go through three feet he had to go through this pulpit of of interlocking cloth to get into there and once he was in there that's why he couldn't hear anything else was because it was draped all the way to the ground all the way to the ceiling and he had to fight his way through all of these cloths that were just lapped one over the other deeply so that no sound could ever get through that's what that's what christ that's what god tore when christ died he tore three feet of cloth right that's like that's like 10 phone books that he tore so that we could have access amen you had to fight to get into it and guess what you still have to fight in it might be open but you've still got to fight in we'll read a quote where brother brown talks about it amen but what he says a priest offers sacrifice and he makes intercession for those that are under his care amen amen what does it mean to make intercession it means they stand between judgment and those that are supposed to be judged what is it they say lord here is an atonement here is a sacrifice here is proof that the price was paid and because of that you can't touch them amen it's not that you're denying god but you're putting in front of god the very thing that he said would put him off that would hold him back from judging the one that's standing there amen and it's not that we're saying they're not deserving lord doesn't mean there isn't a penalty be paid but the priest makes intercession by showing proof that the price is paid and that's the thing that makes him an intercessor is that he or she has something that they can hold up and say lord you cannot touch them there's a price that's been paid here and we're standing in there and we're interceding and we're atoning there's blood on the mercy seat as brother steve said and you can't touch them just yet you haven't get you've allowed us to do that amen but remember you couldn't intercede for someone else until you you felt you yourself were first accepted remember the priest had to go in by himself with the blood and that had to be accepted and he had to come out alive and forgiven and then after that he'd go in back in with the blood and the sacrifice for the congregation and then they could be forgiven but he had to go in himself he had to go in and he had to make sure that hit the token was applied to him before he went and applied the token to somebody else amen and you'll see these things today where people get into a bad spot you'll see people in the world maybe co-workers even family members that aren't serving the lord and they get in a bad spot they get into a health situation they get into a job crisis they get into a marital crisis something bad happens what happens they go when they pray to god and all of a sudden they're going before the throne and they're trying to come into the presence of god and what usually happens god turns a blind eye why because they didn't come his way and what they're doing is they're coming in and they're saying i want you god and he's saying but you didn't come my way and you don't have a token so all that's here for you is judgment so why do they end up coming to us folks because we've got a token why does god hear your prayer and not theirs because you've got a token to take before him amen that you've been called into a royal priesthood and you have access to that holy of holies and he will not do it if you ask him you've got something you can hold back he's given you that power he's given you that power amen he's given you something to hold back the judgment until we're gone and when we're gone there's no holding it back but as long as we're here there's mercy amen and that's why you've got to make sure that you've got the atonement amen amen listen faith is what touches god desperation does not touch god you know what desperation doesn't bring god into your home you know what desperation does it brings you to god instead amen it takes you from your stupid thinking from your blind ways from your insistence on having your own way and it takes you out of that because you say this isn't working lord so i've got to come to you i've got to return back home like the prodigal son i've got to come back to where you're standing and waiting and then when it gets that bad that's what you're doing and you're giving god access to your situation when you say i'll come to you right because too often what we're doing is we're standing in our own decision in the filth of our own thinking and then we're saying god come in and he says i can't come in there you've got to come into the holy of holy son you've got to come into the holiest place daughter you've got to come to me and you've got to show me that you're willing to make a change here as well i'm not coming in to change you you've got to come out of your mess and let me now take it and make something out of it amen we've got to come to him so what happens what people come to us and they say pray your children come to you and say daddy i'm feeling sick your spouse comes to you and she's saying i'm not doing so well there's something going on in my body dad's husbands you better have your atonement sorted out when that happens amen you better make sure you got the token when they come into your room because you're going to be the one that has to lay hands on them and take them before the throne of grace and say lord i've got what you've given me and that's the holy spirit and you said if i waved that over them then you'd give me what i asked for right where two or three one or two if they'd agree on it two or three would agree on it if we'd agree on it we have those tokens and he said he'd do it because the holy spirit will never pray against the will of god right but he says you've got to have a token you've got to have something that you bring and if you don't you have no right being a husband you have no right being a father and then you've got to make sure you've got that token because they're going to rely on it in your family and in your household amen you don't step behind a pulpit without a token you don't step into a church role without a token none of those things can happen until you've got a holy ghost token inside of you that brings you into the presence of god and it gives you access to it whenever you have need of it amen that's what a royal priesthood has amen why you're ordained to do this we talk about ordaining of ministers you have to be ordained into the priesthood amen by fathers and husbands you're ordained into those roles and it is to take a position of spiritual authority in your household and if you're not doing that it doesn't matter how much money you're bringing in doesn't matter how big your house is or how many cars you have you're still out of your position and you're not in balance amen you've got to have that position of spiritual authority in your house where you can take your family to the throne of god not just on a need basis but on a daily basis because that's your role is to bring them before the throne of god every single day amen amen you're interceding and you're not a priest if you're not interceding for others the priest was not there for himself he had to go in and make sure that he was right with god but the priest was there for everybody else that was under his under his responsibility under his authority and these different things amen so what are they doing look at moses moses he was the great interceder wasn't he was moses was standing in the gap remember and god's ready to destroy them and moses says lord don't do it don't do it and guess what they were a thorn in moses side all of his time they were whiny they were childish they were rebellious they were idolatrous they were adulterous they were everything that you wouldn't want in a congregation brother gerald right they were the worst church ever and he stood there and he said lord don't do it don't do it even though it drove him nuts yet his great love for them he said lord don't do it and he stood in the gap and he stood in the gap and he said don't do until god backed off and god heeded it psalms 106 you it's weird to find something about this in the book of psalms rather you know in exodus or these different places but psalms 106 23 says therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them notice that we read earlier that we are a chosen generation here's a different version of chosen this isn't just predestination this is predestinated to take a place to be destinated to stand in the gap predestinated to intercede on behalf of others and hold back judgment until they can come to a place where they can they can stand before god on their own two feet amen this is a chosen and royal priesthood is that they are there to intercede amen to stand there and say lord have mercy lord restore them lord be gracious to them lord heal them yes i know they're not serving you yes i know they're not in the right place but lord for your glory do this that they might see that you're still alive and well amen you are chosen to intercede not just chosen to be yourself a child of god but you are chosen to intercede on the needs of others not only for children of god but those that maybe aren't yet because we don't know who is and who isn't amen but we're there to intercede as god lays on our hearts and as god puts people into our spheres of influence and under our households and these different things he puts them there so that you can intercede on their behalf amen amen so my question is this when somebody does wrong when somebody messes up when somebody's walking down the wrong path when somebody makes a decision we don't agree with then are we taking them before the throne of mercy or are we taking them before the throne of judgment because a priest will always take you to the mercy seat he doesn't take you to the judgment seat he goes in with blood he goes in with a token that the price was paid beforehand so that god can bring mercy to that person and per chance they should come and realize how foolish they're being amen so as priests as royal priests that ought to be the way we respond when things don't go the way we think they should and then as we go and we take that person before the throne of grace with our token they may not have their token but you're taking your token you're saying lord move on their behalf show them grace open their eyes help them to see what's going on help them to see the damage they're doing to themselves help them to see the damage they're doing to their family to the local body in their job whatever it might be you have your own situations you might know about but we're in and we're supposed to be bringing them to the mercy seat because that's what a priest does the priest never stood in judgment the priest was always there for mercy amen the question is when someone's in need whether or not they realize it because they don't always realize it do they whether they realize it or not are we the ones that are first in line to take him before the throne of grace amen are we quick to put our token on display and say lord i'll stand for them lord i'll put my token on the line for them and ask your grace and mercy and favor that they could see where they need to be that they could come to a real realization of the reality of god in their life amen said this he said nathanael said to him to david do all that's in your heart david for god's with you and then brother braham says well this is in what's what's in my heart lord to pray a prayer of faith for these poor sick people will you receive me lord he says i put myself in the channel here to intercede through jesus christ for these people the good shepherd who stands there striped and wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed and father i come with his blessings for the people i come with his spirit with his anointing with his words and there oh out over the people now as it was like grains of food and they've received that he says oh god may they take root right now may life begin to spring may the seed begin to break open life begin to raise up strength begin to come into weak bodies sight begin to come into blind eyes and strengthen the feeble knees oh god may it start growing the holy spirit purging it purging it on and on and on until one great victorious stream of god and every sick person be healed right here tonight he says oh blessed god hear the prayer of your profitable servant through jesus christ's name that's intercession brothers and sisters amen now you say well i'm not brother branham i'm not a minister i'm not a man i'm not a prophet i don't have this ministry listen i don't care how old you are i don't care what your gender is i don't care what you look like i don't care what ministry you have i don't care what ministry you don't have when you are a part of the royal priesthood you have the same access that he did to the supernatural god you have the same access to deliverance you have the same access to healing you have the same access to guidance you have the same access to direction you have the same access to peace and rest and not only for you but for those that are of your household amen amen we're talking to the men primarily again today but this is for the women amen the women have so much in that that they have available to them as a mother as a wife as a prayer warrior amen don't let look at the men tonight let's look at everyone and say we all have access we all have a token if we have the holy spirit to do everything amen everything that god has given us in terms of the spiritual gifts and the redemptive gifts of christ on the cross amen listen brother branham follows it up he says do you believe in this building all of you just now do we all believe he says the lord jesus christ is here to make well to make whole to heal every person in divine presence if you do he says if you do believe i want you to do something for me i want you to look this way now and put your hands over on one another just a moment all the sick and needy lay your hands on each other i tell you you might not want to believe me but there's dozens of you healed right now i've seen him something happened he says you're anointed with the holy spirit now and the gift of god is in the building amen he doesn't differentiate between men and women he doesn't differentiate between young and old he says if you believe then you lay your hands on the situation you lay your hands on the person and you pray believing and he says it's already happening in the midst of you and you don't even know it why because it's a royal priesthood and they're going and they're interceding for each other and the presence of god moves through and he's answering the token applied and all of a sudden healing is going through the building it wasn't his prayer it was their prayer it was in his hands it was their hands why they were giving a sacrifice and interceding on behalf of others and god respected it and healing moved through the building amen we don't have to call a pastor to pray for us he's here if we need them but we don't have to call a pastor i mean we have a god that's not even right here he's right here and we can talk to him and we can go right to him we have 24 7 access we have a direct line to the holy spirit amen and he can answer our prayer anytime we need it i like what brother steve said i quote brother steve a lot tonight he said next time you get a toothache pray first next time you get a headache pray first because what we want the supernatural in our midst and what do we do we go straight to practical you want the supernatural you got to let the supernatural have a chance that means you've got to step back from the practical you've got to step back from the logical and if the word says he'll do it then you've got to give him a chance to do it otherwise you're never going to see the supernatural in your midst amen we've got to give the word a chance we've got to give the holy spirit a chance to move and see what he does and see if he's not faithful to what he said he would do amen but remember what he says do you believe if you don't believe go straight to practical amen if you don't believe go straight to practical go straight to the advil go straight whatever but if you do believe take it before him and let the word have an action in your life amen amen practical is too often code for i don't want to trust god or i don't trust god amen we want to be practical in our christian walk don't we but when it comes to the supernatural there's nothing practical about it you have to believe and you have to act and you have to wait and let god move on that amen amen now it's not just interceding the prophet said we also offer sacrifices and he pointed us to hebrews 13. he says for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come and then we remember we spoke on the royal seat we are abraham's royal seed and now we are the royal priesthood and we're not looking to fix the kingdom we're in we're looking for the kingdom that is to come remember the kingdom to come is here it's already here jesus said the kingdom of god is within you it's here right now it's not in its fullness and it's not in its earthly manifestation but the kingdom of god is here amen so is our priesthood being focused on fixing the kingdom we're in or is it focused on bringing to fruition the kingdom that we're supposed to be a part of already and that we're looking forward to come in the future amen we're supposed to be acting now to bring the kingdom of heaven into place not to fix the one we're in now amen he says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god occasionally no no no he said offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name what does that sound like that sounds like thank you jesus praise the lord right that's what it sounds like let's not be silly about it thank you lord thank you jesus that's constantly what he's talking about that's what coming out of our lives our lips that does he say in the good times he says continually i'm reminded of what brother ron spencer said he says i don't want you to pray for my healing he said i want you to thank god for my healing that's what it's supposed to look like in these situations is you don't look to the symptoms you don't look to the difficulty but you thank god that he's promised an answer and that all things would work together for your good no matter how hard it looks right now amen brother brown says this this is tough this is tough let's be honest continually giving praise when the bank account doesn't look so good when the health is failing when we're getting up in age amen when our job isn't so great when our marriage is struggling when we've got a kid that's showing inclinations toward the world right this is not an easy thing to do but paul peter says or paul says to do it continually no matter what right this is a test of your faith is will you continue to say praise the lord when it looks like there's nothing to praise him about amen what is it it's a wellspring springing up within you and it cannot be quenched by circumstance amen brother branham he's speaking now of peter on the day of pentecost and he's talking about receiving the promise of the holy spirit he says what was god saying there he said the same thing he said to moses in other words this holy ghost manna that began to fall on the day of pentecost was to sustain the church and the church was to live only by the holy spirit until the day we enter the millennium he says hallelujah what is it he says it's the same holy spirit he's talking about now he says now notice it was for everyone that was a priest in the old testament he says everyone in the new testament that becomes a christian born again becomes a priest to god and we are priests and we are kings a priest is to make sacrifice and we give to god the sacrifice of our lips giving praise to his name you say i don't feel like it he says do it anyhow that's a sacrifice hallelujah say i feel too tired listen to this i feel too tired the devil will tell you that until he takes you to hell whoa i feel too tired to praise the lord he says the devil will tell you that and take you all the way to hell with that attitude amen wow we ought to be careful about how we let our our our human energy come sometimes get us down amen that it would hold us back hold us back from church attendance hold us back from devotions hold us back from prayer hold us back from giving time to god and showing him that we're going to give him praise amen he says that's right you're to make a spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name priests and kings unto god the bible said we were that he made us priests and kings unto god now listen to this next quote he says eating what what is it that's going to give you this continual praise he says living alone because remember in the holy of holies who are you with there's only one in there when you're eating from the hidden manna there was only you and one other person you were in there alone it was an unseen presence but it was a presence nonetheless but it was just you it wasn't anybody else in there right so what he's saying is don't go find an alternate diet don't add somebody else into the mixer he says eat alone israel didn't go out and try and get some wild oats and break them up and make some corn cakes they didn't blend other foods with manna they just ate the manna straight he says that's what's the matter with the church tonight they've got too many wild oats and that's your diet you're not eating from the original manna he says you've blended something in to make it taste a little different to make it a little more interesting to make it a little more palatable he says don't do it he says you need a good old-fashioned bible diet is what you need he says this the pastor will tell you the truth about the bible he says thank god we got plenty of them amen the pastor will tell you what you need i like how brother steve brought it out this weekend where he talked about people treating their ability to stream services as a spiritual buffet you know what struck me when he said that is that i have never seen a healthy person at a buffet that eats at a buffet all the time you ever notice that the biggest people are at the buffets why because they can eat as much of the uh they can eat as much as they want of whatever they want amen now you say well it's a word buffet brother jonathan you can't eat too much of that guess what what you can do is eat everything that you want and nothing that you don't and that's what makes it a spiritually bad buffet because what happens is you'll turn that stream on and then the brother will start stepping on your toes and so you'll turn it off and you'll go to the next brother and you'll turn it on until he steps on your toes and then you'll go and you'll turn it on till the next one does it and so you're just going and what you're doing is you're eating steak and donuts instead of the fresh greens and the the broccoli and all the disgusting things that we're not supposed to like but we're supposed to eat right i'm speaking from personal experience here right all the things that i'm supposed to eat are not delicious and all the things that i'm not supposed to eat are delicious and do you think for a second that spiritually you're going to go for the things that you don't like the taste of you're not when you get to sit at home and choose who's going to preach to you today you're always going to pick what you like rather than what you need and it's no different at a buffet who has gone to a buffet and said i'm going to eat half a plate of things that i don't like because that's the healthy thing to do we have one person that claims it and we're going to examine his claim after service amen nobody goes to a buffet to eat things they don't like you go there because they have something for everybody and you focus on what you like and that's what brother steve was getting at was if you're going to stream chances are you're going to stream only what you like and you're never going to get what you actually need amen can you imagine if all the ministry did up here was affirm you you're right brother bob you're right sister maureen you're right brother mark you're right brother jonathan you're right brother paul you're right sister justine you're right selena you're right sister rebecca and all he did was stand up here and tell you you're right you're perfect your your mindset's amazing your attitude's great your hair is the right length your skirts are the right length your sideburns aren't too long right you showed a great attitude this week i liked your social media feed this week right boy you really helped your wife this week and your husband is so no if all we did was that why would we call this the house of correction it'd be the house of affirmation amen we're not here for a house of affirmation guess what brother steve had some pretty hard things to say this weekend for me at least right now he affirmed me in a few ways but he definitely stepped on my toes in a few ways amen and you know what if he didn't step on my toes i questioned where the holy spirit was in those meetings because we're not here to just be affirmed we're here to be corrected and when correction comes it's not judgment it's god letting you know i love you and i don't want you to get into things that are going to draw you away from me right we look at correction as a bad thing but it's not it's god's love scripture says if he doesn't do it then you're a bastard that you're not even a child of his and yet when it comes then we say what's he doing what's we're not supposed to be doing this i don't want to hear that no no no it's a house of correction it's a house that's doing it out of love for you amen paul said this if we had a what happens is when we say something that isn't enjoyed people say well it's just his opinion or he knows about this situation or he knows about that amen that's what happens isn't it so often you got to be careful when you do that because if it was the holy spirit you just blasphemed the holy spirit by saying it was a man rather than the holy spirit amen you got to be very careful what's coming over this pulpit as a minister but you got to be very careful how you judge what comes behind the pulpit because if the holy spirit's speaking and you say that's just a man you blaspheme the holy spirit he says there's no forgiving that it's a dangerous thing we ought to do it we ought to be careful of amen paul said it this way in galatians 4 16 he says am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth paul was a hard man paul did a lot of cleaning up paul did a lot of correcting he was setting the entire church in order for the next two to uh two thousand years he had a big job to do so paul didn't pull any punches did he and he said am i become your enemy because i'm telling you the truth i'm just trying to help you amen listen to what brother brahms said this is an amazing quote he says you are a peculiar people a separated people a holy people and a royal priesthood this is not a random side okay we'll see why i'm talking about this because we're going to get to verse 17 here in a second you'll see why we're talking about it he says you are all together different from the world you don't act like them dress like them talk like them you are a called out separated that's right he says now you see what i mean and we say amen i'm called out i'm separated right we all say it don't we listen to the next portion he says if you refuse to be separated peculiar he says you'll just go away and say that preacher's just popping off that's the action of an unseparated person that's that's the action of somebody that is not a part of the peculiar people he says am i he says am i popping off this is the prophet speaking not me he says am i popping off he said it's the scripture and then it's the scripture popping off he says if i brought it through the word then it's not me popping off it's the scripture popping off as you put it popping off right he says then if you've got your ears so bored that you've listened to the devil and you can never know more hear the gospel truth and walk in the light that's the mark of the beast amen it's serious it's serious when you judge what comes over a pulpit you better apply it by the word and not by your opinion because otherwise he says your ear is bored and you can never hear the word of light amen he says you refuse to hear truth and liberation that christ has made you free from those things what when he steps on our toes right we're supposed to be free from it and when it comes over the pulpit that's god saying i want you to be free i want you to be free because it's holding you back amen amen if you want to channel surf different mystery ministries have at it but i don't believe that's what god has for his bride amen he gave them pastors to anchor them and he gave him the rest of the fivefold ministry to come in and feed them as it was needed amen so you've got an angry ministry and then you've got one that comes in and does all those things if you're listening to five pastors how is that ever gonna work pick five pastors and try and sit under five pastoral ministries at the same time you can't do it because they've got different visions they got different anointings they got different gifts they got different issues in the local assembly you're sitting home at your computer and you're trying to feed off five pastors right can't do it god doesn't have five pastors ordained for you he's got one ordained for you find them and get under them amen but paul or he's talking about in and brother babs talk about the sacrifice of our lips right and we talked about what was it it was praise the lord thank you jesus and these different things but the question is what is it that's been coming out of your lips in your situations is it praise the lord is it thank you jesus thank you for the word thank you for the promise amen or is it what about my lack is it about the drought is it about difficulties is it about your needs is it about pain or frustration or disappointment amen is it disease is it about impossibilities is it about criticism is that the sacrifice of the lips we've been making amen but are we stepping into satan's jobs because that's his job his job is to tell you everything that's wrong right i say it all the time satan is the accuser of the brethren amen so that is satan's job is to point you to the negative amen what do brother brother steve talk about he talked about what the positive word that we've been given it's to point us to what god has offered us and satan's trying to point us to what we have right and the thing is are you pointing to what you have or you point to what god has offered right that's where your sacrifice of your lips is going to prove itself amen amen because if what we're doing is we're spending time sharing and testifying about the things that satan's accusing the brethren of then we've got a spirit on us and we need to repent and we need to get the cast out of us because that's what it is it is a spirit on us that's getting us to testify the things that satan talks about rather than what the bride of christ talks about amen then when brother when brother uh steve was talking i wrote down this little phrase because i was thinking forward to this service here and he was talking about the way that we speak in these things and what i wrote down was this phrase and it said the language of the bride is the word for her day the sacrifice of your lips ought to be the word for your day it ought to be speaking of the things that god has promised that god has done and that god is doing and that god is going to do that ought to be the language that we have amen that ought to be the testimony remember we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony amen so what is your testimony is it of the bad things or is it of the good things because if you're testifying of the bad things what are you going to get more of the bad things if you're going to testify the good things then guess what now you've got you've given god something to work with because he is what the high priest of our confession so if we confess good things we've got a high priest that is christ we confess bad things who's our high priest it's certainly not christ is it there's only one other power folks and it's satanic so if you're if your testimony is negative if your confession is negative then you're under a satanic priesthood that's where you're at that's stark but that's the way it is because you've got to be giving the right sacrifice and that right sacrifice is what in his name according to his word amen brother brahm said this he says what is a spiritual sacrifice he says that's what these sons and daughters do which are kings and priests yet not in full possession we're not we don't have it all yet do we we have the earnest of it all but we don't have it all but he says they're not yet in full possession but they're making sacrifices offering to god spiritual sacrifices the fruit of our lips giving praise to him the fruit of our lips you say brother branham i just don't feel like praising him he says that's the time to make the sacrifice praise him anyhow kings and priests sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifice the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name he says while we're groaning veiled in this tabernacle of humiliation has anybody had some humiliation recently i have he says while we're gr brother mark while we're groaning veiled in this tabernacle of humiliation we have the earnest of our perfect complete redemption back like we were in the beginning when god created adam in the garden of eden he says we have a foretaste of glory divine by the baptism of the holy ghost the refreshment coming from the presence of god to water the church to make it grow in grace and when we're sick we have redemption the blessing the attributes of the death of christ divine healing as a foresight to us that someday this mortal will take on immortality he says yes sir amen oh my marvelous he's here to do it glory man amen that's what our we're supposed to be doing we're supposed to be taking that earnest and pointing to the fullness amen we're supposed to be taking what we have and saying that just means there's more to come that i don't have it but it means because i have a portion of it then the rest of it has to come because he never starts a work that he's not going to finish amen he who started the work we'll be faithful to complete it so if you have the earnest that means you are guaranteed to get the fullness amen amen i want to finish off as we start to close hebrews 13 because remember he pointed us there and we stopped there and we say well that's all brother branham said he was just talking about the praise of our lips and that's a spiritual sacrifice that's not the only thing a spiritual sacrifice is that's what he focused on but if you go to the next two verses then he starts then paul starts to show us what other spiritual sacrifices look like amen so he says here this is one of them it says but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased so it's not just what you say brothers and sisters it's what you do that's a sacrifice as well isn't it in the amplified it says do not forget or neglect to do kindness and good to be generous and distribute and contribute to the needy for such sacrifices are pleasing to god amen we don't get just to sit here and say we have the greatest message to hit this planet we have to do what the greatest message of this planet tells us to do and it points us back to the word and the word says don't be weary in well-doing and then paul says these things that you do they're pleasing to god amen we had the church here this weekend it was i was so proud of everybody because nobody was doing nothing we had people that after the services were running around cleaning up we have the musicians playing we have people preparing specials we have people hosting we have people making food we have people helping people bring food in we have people moving furniture we have people setting things up taking things down going here there what was it everybody was doing what putting their shoulder to the wheel and it's a sacrifice and out of the sacrifice comes what a beautiful thing right we can't lay it all on one one family on one household on one person on one ministry but when we all get in there all of a sudden we have this sacrifice that turns into praise in action praise comes forth amen but listen to this next one because this is a doozy i'm warning you before i read it it's a doozy and it's a doozy to me as a minister and it's a doozy to me when i'm sitting in the in the pew with the rest of you are you ready obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you the amplified says obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them continually recognizing their authority over you for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual warfare as men who will have to render an account of their trust every man has to answer do your part to let them do this with gladness and not with sighing and groaning brother gerald for that would not be profitable to you either he says he says if they're unhappy and doing it because you're making their life so difficult he says it's not good for them and it's not good for you so what's he saying he's saying obey those that have the authority over you don't make their life difficult just for the sake of being difficult don't be that guy don't be that girl that just wants to stand up and always have things their way right don't be the one that always makes a fuss he says what let it be simple for them so that they're not signing and groaning for the work that they have to do with you this is a sacrifice that gives praise right because what remember what he said he says these people draw nigh to me with their lips but their heart is where far from me oh we talk a good talk but paul says now are you going to walk a good walk and he says will you do good things and will you submit to authority that's going to be the proof in the pudding of whether or not you're truly willing to give spiritual sacrifices because spiritual sacrifices are not just spiritual they come down and they have a physical manifestation amen it always comes out in your life in some way amen now this takes humility because guess what we've got imperfect ministry we got imperfect deacons we got imperfect song leaders we got imperfect trustees and you've got a scripture says obey him and submit yourselves to them well that's never going to work paul says if you do spiritual sacrifices you'll make it work because there's a blessing in it amen now remember this they are not imperfect because you disagree with them so often we think we disagree with them therefore they're wrong no no no no you have to disagree with the word not with the person so the person could be right and just because you don't want to obey you say they're wrong but let it be that they're wrong because they're off the word not because you just don't want to do what they want you to do amen that's what he's saying here right you've got to submit to them if they're guarding your souls and if you have authority if you are a husband if you are a father if you are a minister if you are a deacon you have authority as a man and we're supposed to be looking out for their souls that are underneath our authority we're supposed to be looking out for them not making things easy for ourselves and that is the sacrifice that we have to prove out is are we doing it for them or are we doing it for us because if we're doing it for us then praise of god will never come out it'll just build up kingdoms and then it'll crumble and fall and it'll turn into a denomination every time amen so this is what spiritual sacrifice is supposed to look like is that you're looking out for those that are beneath you and the ones that are beneath you they submit to it but you're looking out for their sake not for yours so like i said if you could take care of all the physical needs but you're not providing spiritually then there's a problem and i've seen it on the other side and it's honestly just as common as you have men that are so spiritually aware that they're of no physical use right you've got to have these things in balance you've got to be able to be a spiritual provider and not just a physical provider for your family amen amen i like what brother steve said you know because what pastors and ministers are supposed to be looking out for the laity we're not supposed to be up here to make money to have an easy life you know to gain respect or or popularity or anything like that we are supposed to be looking out for your souls to take you all the way to the statue of a perfect man or woman in christ that's what we're supposed to be doing and we're to supposed to put your needs above our own needs amen but remember what brother steve said is he said sometimes what he's got to do something to you that doesn't feel so good the pastor the great shepherd we can put it that way amen and what's that he says is if you won't take his guidance if he won't take his food if he won't stay close to the shepherd then what does he do he breaks your leg do i guarantee you brother gerald you don't like breaking legs do you because after you break the leg then you've got to do all the work of carrying that sheep around for a while and guess what the ministry doesn't like breaking legs any more than anybody else does the shepherd doesn't enjoy breaking the leg because that's only more work for him not less right he's got to carry that sheep everywhere he's got to hand feed that sheep he can't let it walk around and be with the other sheep he's got to give it so much one-on-one attention that it exhausts him so why would he do it he'd do it because he loves it it's certainly not for his sake that he break a leg he do it because he's trying to help that sheep out amen and sometimes that's called hard preaching isn't it when you say things that you know are going to be difficult for someone to swallow but what are you doing you're hoping that they'll take it and if they don't the leg is broken and then they'll come back and hopefully god can work with them but even more difficult is when they walk away and you've got to pull your hands off and say lord i can't do anything and now you commit them into the hands of the great shepherd and that's a far worse thing isn't it because it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living god amen taking your hands off whether it's your kids amen whether it's your kids and you have to pull your hands off we don't want to do that do we we want to keep them close we want to be hard because we know if we don't then god's going to be even harder right we're trying to do it for their sake we're not trying to do it to make our lives easy we don't discipline our kids just to make our lives easy we discipline them so that they can be pleasing to god and they can learn what it is that pleases him amen so often what we do is we're disciplining because we want people to like our kids or to look up to us as a family no no you're doing it for the kids good not for yours that's that's what that's what discipline is supposed to be about is for their good not for yours it's the same for the ministry it's not about making life easy for us it's about bringing you into a living god in a relationship with them and anything that would come contrary to that we want to get it out of your way amen brother stevens drew said something we're talking about remember being difficult for the sake of being difficult paul said don't do it but stephen stru said something he said people have forgotten the difference between a belief and an opinion he says if someone puts a gun to your head and you are willing to take the bullet ensure death rather than change your mind that's a belief everything else is in an opinion and it's not worth fighting about he says if you wouldn't die for it it's it's an opinion is that the truth or is that the truth how many of us would die for our constitutional rights most of us wouldn't she's like eh whatever but we would die for the word if we have the holy ghost we would die for the word amen but yet we let what we let politics we let economics we let church situations get in there and we do what we get into fights and we separate and we cause issues and we do this and that and the other on the basis of what on opinion and we wouldn't even die for it we say we would we act like we would but if somebody actually held a gun to our head we wouldn't do it would we what is it we're making things difficult for the sake of what an opinion right it's not a belief it's not a word belief usually it's an opinion because if somebody put the gun up we'd say oh i'm good we'll do it your way right so why don't we leave the guns out of it and say let's keep it to the word and be able to agree to disagree at times you know these different things amen paul's saying don't be the person that's dying over opinions if we can put it that way amen amen we're about to close we've got two things remember so we covered a a chosen a chosen people a royal priesthood and then he said what you were a holy nation i'm just going to read a couple quotes so that we can we can close out he says and until you come in behind that badger skin now remember what we said that's three feet thick not just the bad your skin but all the the linen and everything behind it three feet thick until you come into that isolation chamber until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old creeds and come into the presence of god then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the shekinah glory and then the bible becomes a new book and then jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he says you're living in his presence eating the show bread that's only provided that day for believers it's for priests only and we are priests a royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to god but you must come in to behind the veil to see the unveiled god and god is unveiled and that's his word may manifest let put this way you can't be holy and stay the way you were born amen that's one of the greatest traps you'll hear today is people say god made me this way therefore i should stay this way listen we are born liars we are born thieves we are born lustful we're born selfish we're born weak we're born strong we're born rebellious we're born proud we're born born boastful we're born unthankful any of us sitting here saying that that's the way god made me and yet we'll take other attributes that we have and we'll say well god maybe that so therefore that's what i'm going to be and we don't run it through the word amen men are supposed to have certain characteristics and men are not supposed to have certain characteristics amen women are supposed to have certain characteristics and they're also not supposed to have other characteristics so if you have something you're not supposed to have you don't say god maybe this way you say no let me subject it to the word and let god do a change in me to bring it subject to him because even the best things we have even the best things we have still have to be purified isaiah goes before the throne of god and in his presence he said i am a man of unclean lips he's born a prophet and he says i'm a man of unclean lips but when the coal of fire touched his tongues he says here i am send me why he needed the power of the holy spirit he need the cleansing fire of god to clean the thing that was literally built for god to use and then from there he could step out into his prophetic role but until that happened to him he couldn't speak amen so whether we have good things or bad things we don't get to say this is the way god made me no we say lord be it unto me according to your word and let me be changed into the image that you had of me don't let me stay where i am but as brother steve was talking about let us be transformed into what god has called us to be amen there's a transformation that we're looking for and that's a supernatural thing amen brother brad said this he says oh it's the new birth they're afraid of that the new birth is like any other birth it's a mess i don't care what kind of birth it is it's a mess if it's in a pig pen if it's in a barnyard or a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess so the new birth is a mess it'll make you do things you didn't think you'd ever do but out of that mess comes life he says hallelujah it that's it out of a mess comes life life comes out of a mess and then he says life comes out of death except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abides alone but as long as it dies and rots then out of that rotten mess comes forth life until a man or a woman is ready to die to themselves die out to their creeds die out to their own ideas and out of that rotten mess bring forth a new birth of glories and shouts and praises of god that makes him act different changes his nature changes his life changes his motives and changes his objectives that's a beautiful thing sometimes we have a changed life and we're still doing things for the wrong reasons he says no no let's get the whole package here amen he says but they're afraid of it afraid it'll make them cry and ruin the makeup on their face the women afraid it'll spoil the appetite of the cigar for the man see they're afraid of it they don't want it afraid that somebody will call them a holy roller or fanatic amen we're talking about a holy people here he says if they called the master of the house beelzebub how much more will they call them of his disciples sure if they didn't call me that i'd get down and pray and say lord what's the matter with me the world knows its own but you are bought with a price you are different people a holy people a royal priesthood a holy nation and then he says you are a kingdom you are a kingdom you are the kingdom of god so he says you've got to be that holy nation you've got to be that peculiar people that royal priesthood that chosen generation amen then we're supposed to be what a peculiar people brother brahm says this he says after the church takes its position we're called to the adoption of sons by the holy spirit and when each man takes his position what god has called him to do and stand to the end of the road going after the lost remember we said we went from be fruitful and prosper to go into all the world and preach the gospel right every man's purpose is to bring in the spiritual souls that need to be in the kingdom of god that's the only thing we've got to do that's our sole purpose here is to get the souls into the kingdom to find that last seed so we can get out of here amen amen right we have children why because we're trusting they're part of that seed right we don't have children just to have children we have children because we believe that that's a child of god and we're bringing the child to god into the world amen he says now first paul takes all the scare out of it he says so now if you're called if you're not just worked up in your mind by some kind of theology this message has some kind of theology around it doesn't it you want theology this message has a ton of theology it has a ton of ideas has a ton of doctrine you can get so intellectually stimulated with this that you won't know what to do with yourself amen but he says that's not it don't get worked up in it he says if you're really born of the spirit then god predestinated you before the foundation of the world not because you heard the message he says if you've had that real birth put your name on the lamb's book of life and now we come together to sit in heavenly places in christ jesus a holy people a holy nation a peculiar people a royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices unto god that is the fruit of our lips giving praises to his name he says when that's done listen to this he says people come in and say them people are crazy we're crazy if people came in and saw what was going on in these services they'd say you're crazy the very idea of coming in here and singing and praising and praying and shouting and crying and snotting and bubbling and repenting and getting down in an altar and shouting and dancing and bellowing amen you're crazy and then you go out and you live a life and you're not chasing the things of the world and you don't drink and you don't get worried about this and you don't get caught up in that and you dress sanely you speak sanely your words are good your words are kind you you're crazy they say you ought to be up in arms you ought to be you know mad you ought to be frustrated with what's going on and we sit here and we say we're at peace we're at rest brother joe was sharing it with a with with a lady that he was working with and she was talking about all this and he's like i'm at rest i'm at rest i'm not caught up in this i'm not worried about my business i'm at rest and she's like i wish i had that but you're crazy brother joe you're a crazy man because you believe this amen and then people come in and say you're crazy them people are crazy he says sure they are the wisdom of god is foolish to man and the wisdom of man is foolish to god they're contrary one to the other people ought to believe that we're weird not because we're weird but because we stick to the word the word's supposed to make us weird listen you look around there's a lot of people in the world that are weird for the sake of being weird right now you got weird haircuts you got weird hair colors you got tattoos you got piercing you got clothes you got men looking like women women looking like men and then people looking like nothing right you got all sorts of weird out there and they're weird for the sake of being weird we're not called to be weird for the sake of being weird we're called to be what weird because we follow the word amen that's supposed to be our testimonies we're weird we're odd because we are believers we're a part of that royal priesthood amen we're called to be different and that calling is what makes us peculiar because it has an effect on us it has an effect on our lives it has an effect on our family it has effect on our careers has effect on the way we spend our time amen as we close peter said this he says you're our chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people why why are we all of this he says that you should show forth the praises of him who have called you out of darkness in to this marvelous light into his marvelous light amen the purpose of all of this strangeness is to give praise to god amen so if what's coming out of our lives is not praising god then we are not acting according to a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people why because god's got to get praise out of what we're living god's got to get praise out of what we're doing god's got to get praise out of how we're acting where we're going all these things are supposed to bring praise to god right and that's the sacrifice not only of your lips but your life and then so i want to ask you this this evening what is it that's coming out of your life amen is it the praises of god or is it something else right is it unrest is it criticism is it fear is it depression because that's not what he's looking for here he's looking for praise something that reflects him that glorifies him amen so it's going to start where it's got to start in the heart right of the abundance of the heart a man speaketh and then out of your mouth has got to come words that are what a spiritual sacrifice giving praise to god through his name amen and then out of that it goes into action your faith what it what it what did james say show me your faith by your works right faith without works is dead brother branham preached amen so all of it has to trickle down we can't just be great talkers we have to be great walkers amen and that's where the sacrifice is proven is when we walk the way that we say we talk and and that talk is supposed to reflect what we believe inside ourselves amen amen let's all stand together if we would amen i want to ask you is your life bringing praises to god because that's what the royal priesthood is doing is they are making a sacrifice that brings praise to god and they are interceding for the needs of those that are around them amen that's what royal priesthood looks like this isn't fun and games is it that that wasn't a a a bunch of fun to listen to was it we've got work to do and then we've got a role we've got a position we've got a responsibility for those that are around us amen we're not just here to be a christian we're here to be a royal priesthood we're here to have an effect we're there to stand between judgment and those that rightly deserve it because what he did it for us i'm here because what he stood between judgment to me and said i'll take the i'll take the price and guess what that may mean that you spend many hours on your knees it may mean that you lose sleep because so somebody else can sleep soundly right it may mean that you have to lose some money it may mean that you have to lose a bit of the things that we so enjoy so much why because you're putting it on the line for somebody that needs it more than you and then you're taking what he's giving and you're saying as he gave for me i'm going to give it off to somebody else and i'm going to intercede on their behalf now i'm going to be a sacrifice for them amen god help us god help us it's a serious thing amen it's tears right it's not all happy joy joy and dancing around the church in that amen i wish it was i wish it was an easy thing but it's not it's work it's getting down there and it's getting serious with god and saying lord i've got a token you know you have a token amen you got to be able to hold that up and you go to him and say i'm bringing the token tonight because there's a need for somebody that's next to me amen let's bow our heads amen heavenly father lord first and foremost we are so thankful that you took our place lord
