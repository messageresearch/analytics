[40:21] [Music]
[40:22] [Applause]

[40:28] [Applause]
[40:29] [Music]
[40:30] again
[40:32] [Music]
[40:40] [Applause]
[40:42] [Music]
[40:43] [Applause]
[40:47] [Music]
[40:55] what
[40:58] praise the Lord wonderful to see such an
[41:02] audience hey man
[41:04] praise the name of the Lord I trust the
[41:06] others are tuned in by the grace of God
[41:09] a man I'm praying also for the other
[41:12] ministry brethren and I guess across the
[41:14] cattle united states maybe around the
[41:17] world there's got a minister of the same
[41:18] way a man and again as I said our
[41:21] brother Donny Reagan felt bad because he
[41:24] was missing the people in the
[41:26] congregation and and I feel the same way
[41:29] a man I I come expecting to see
[41:32] everybody but then when I come out it's
[41:34] different that's the truth I I leave
[41:38] home thinking well well I'm gonna preach
[41:40] this to to everybody but thinking that
[41:42] I'm going to be looking at them but
[41:44] again I trust by by the by the grace of
[41:47] God that God is looking at them a man
[41:50] and I was expectancy sister Maureen I
[41:55] guess we were satisfied with the guitars
[41:57] a man so God God's grace to us in the
[42:02] land the Lord's blessings be upon us as
[42:04] we go into the word this evening and so
[42:07] they just to ask you to keep of course
[42:10] the prayer requests the ones that
[42:12] brother Mark requested tonight and also
[42:15] to keep sharing our daughter in prayer
[42:18] she's been having pain and she was due
[42:23] to see a doctor earlier but because of
[42:25] what's going on it was postponed until
[42:28] September it's a long time so unless of
[42:32] course maybe something comes up and that
[42:33] she's really got to to see it or
[42:36] something got to be done we pray the
[42:38] grace of God to step in
[42:40] amen so the Lord Lord be with her amen
[42:44] and we with the Saints again that are
[42:46] not here but with saints that are online
[42:48] and but even if brother Chad's online we
[42:53] won't hear is a man's or Alleluias if we
[42:56] do I guess somebody be complaining in
[43:00] in his neighborhood any man so the Lord
[43:03] bless him a man and the Lord blessed the
[43:05] other Saints as well our brothers and
[43:07] sisters the grace of God be with a man
[43:11] there might be some here or locally and
[43:13] there could be others across the island
[43:15] and the Lord blessed them and also just
[43:19] to remind you that we were hoping maybe
[43:22] to get our brother Carmen Carmen Mills
[43:26] to minister for us sometime
[43:28] and he's ministers in New Brunswick but
[43:31] when we'll be able to get a minister I'm
[43:33] not sure because he usually ministers in
[43:36] New Brunswick on Wednesdays and brother
[43:39] Carr ministers on Sundays so we pray
[43:42] there the grace of God to work it out
[43:45] for us and maybe if if we would like to
[43:49] get him the minister for us on a Sunday
[43:50] that he would be able to do it even in
[43:52] New Brunswick so and again the situation
[43:56] here of course is the same there that
[43:57] they they can't have the many in in the
[44:01] audience as well so I don't know if
[44:03] things are changing in New Brunswick or
[44:05] not they were I think Andrew Bosley was
[44:07] trying to change it so we'll see what
[44:10] what happens and the grace of God be
[44:12] with us and I don't know how much longer
[44:14] this is going to continue here where we
[44:17] won't allow people to come so we leave
[44:20] it with the Lord and to see what the
[44:22] Lord will will arrange we know that
[44:24] we'll just be on our guard
[44:26] let's be on our guard because this is
[44:29] this is a sign of the end and these
[44:32] things are going to increase more and
[44:34] more and more this is going to happen
[44:36] well after this is over something else
[44:38] could happen that's right so I pray the
[44:41] grace of God to to give us his wisdom
[44:44] and his leadership and we're going to
[44:46] take our stand for the truth they'll
[44:48] still take our stand for the word of God
[44:50] and again there were certain churches
[44:52] that though they were not allowed to
[44:55] meet inside there and I'm not sure what
[44:58] what kind of a church it was but they
[45:01] got the people to gather outside in
[45:03] their cars and in their vehicles in the
[45:06] parking lot and the preacher of course
[45:08] stood on the on the steps outside and
[45:12] ministered to them yeah and I notice
[45:14] also that there was a young sister that
[45:17] went up on the steps on this on the
[45:19] bridge we call it the deck as she played
[45:22] to get to her thing and the others were
[45:24] just sitting in their cars in the
[45:26] parking lot
[45:27] so God blessed them for taking their
[45:30] stand a man so we pray the grace of God
[45:33] be with us and I'm be honest
[45:35] praying grace at the Lord Allah will
[45:38] allow the Saints to get back into the
[45:40] into the assembly get back into the
[45:42] church amen for the glory of God so God
[45:45] be with us and the Lord help us in these
[45:48] last days we're living at the closing
[45:51] time so let's be on our guard
[45:53] amen they're saying only believe all
[45:56] things are possible only believe praise
[45:59] the Lord

[49:08] again Lord that it's not me that lives
[49:10] but it's Christ that living in me father
[49:13] it is the word that's being lived out in
[49:15] us that while there were Alleluia as
[49:18] Jesus was the word in flesh so now now
[49:21] we believe more that we are the word in
[49:24] flesh because of your anointing because
[49:26] of your presence because of the baptism
[49:29] of the Holy Ghost
[49:31] Alleluia more than you have promised
[49:33] Lord to make us and the word 1 so what I
[49:36] pray grace father that we'll have that
[49:39] understanding that revelation Lord and
[49:41] that we're going to yield continually
[49:43] father to let the word of preeminence in
[49:46] our lives that the word have preeminence
[49:49] Lord in our thoughts our words and our
[49:51] deeds so again that is not me it's Jesus

[50:15] in us a man who is not our ideas is not
[50:18] our thoughts is not our motives not our
[50:20] objectives milord is Jesus father as he

[51:50] no Billy amen hallelujah all things are
[52:00] possible now I believe
[52:12] daily No
[52:17] we hope things are possible
[52:26] now I be a man preach the Lord God
[52:33] lishus turn with me to Genesis chapter 4
[52:37] the book of Genesis chapter 4 as we go
[52:41] into the word and again I want to go in
[52:44] and highlight what you heard during our
[52:47] last service as we heard the tape on
[52:50] Satan's Eden I wanted you to hear it but
[52:54] at the same time I want to highlight
[52:56] certain things that the prophet of God
[52:58] said and I trust that his that God has
[53:01] written it in your heart and in your
[53:03] soul so that we're not going to forget
[53:05] it but what I want yeah we need to
[53:07] understand this why we need we need to
[53:09] catch this because that's the enemy that
[53:12] we are dealing with it is Satan well
[53:14] we're so glad for the revelation of the
[53:17] word in flesh our Lord Jesus Christ but
[53:19] then there's the impersonation of that
[53:21] word and that's the devil a man and we
[53:24] go from and many are going from
[53:26] worshiping Jesus to worshiping Satan but
[53:29] they think that this is the deceit of
[53:31] the age they think they're worshipping
[53:34] Jesus they think they're worshipping
[53:36] Jehovah but they are worshipping the
[53:39] devil and millions as the prophet of God
[53:42] and I highlighted that quote to you in
[53:44] the in the previous message that the
[53:46] problem of God said there are millions
[53:48] and billions worshiping the devil so
[53:52] brothers sister and not only that just
[53:54] think if they're worshiping the devil
[53:55] they're just not up there there there
[53:58] are so-called religious people then they
[54:00] may be going to a church attending the
[54:01] certain church but and worshiping and
[54:04] think the worshipping Jesus they think
[54:07] the worshiping Jehovah but my wonder
[54:10] what reality it's absolutely amazing to
[54:14] think that they're worshipping Satan
[54:16] just think of that the Satan has so
[54:18] deceived the world and Satan as know not
[54:22] just the world of there but brother I
[54:24] know that Satan is deceiving
[54:26] a believer professing believer that says
[54:29] he believed this message to believe this
[54:30] they believe that but instead they're
[54:33] worshipping Jesus to worshipping Satan
[54:35] amen and they said that they're going to
[54:38] discover it at the end of the age
[54:40] when what when they missed the rapture
[54:42] and again they questioned the rapture I
[54:45] thought there was to be a rapture yeah
[54:47] how does anyone that's believable
[54:48] rapture those around this message and
[54:51] there's something we know of course
[54:52] there are those out there when it comes
[54:54] to Pentecostals or the my I can't the
[54:59] wonders of Pentecost out there United
[55:01] Pentecostal and so on but again there's
[55:04] going to be many many around the message
[55:06] that are going to ask the question and
[55:08] he's going to say to them what do you
[55:09] say to others he said yeah it's already
[55:12] caught me you didn't know it a man they
[55:15] failed to recognize and will bring that
[55:16] out eventually
[55:17] because there are some quotes that the
[55:19] property Lord has showed me regarding
[55:21] the rapture what the part of God was
[55:23] trying to remind us up and and bring to
[55:26] our attention that the rapture is not
[55:28] there the rapture is here and the
[55:30] rapture is not going to happen the
[55:32] rapture is going on now and he brought
[55:35] this out there even during the
[55:36] revelation of the seven seals and he
[55:39] said what was God doing he said he's
[55:41] giving us wrap through faith and what is
[55:43] right through faith it is the revelation
[55:45] of the rapture a man and it was
[55:48] tremendous
[55:49] some of the things that God reminded us
[55:51] of through the Prophet when he said the
[55:53] rapture is going on the rapture is
[55:56] taking place now a man just think that
[55:59] was over fifty years ago maybe fifty
[56:02] five years ago so I pray God we're not
[56:04] going to miss the rapture and brother
[56:07] when I said not miss the rapture let's
[56:09] not miss the revelation of the rapture a
[56:11] mayor
[56:12] Ezra's Luther caught the revelation of
[56:15] justification the other sanctification
[56:17] the bastion of the Holy Ghost the gifts
[56:19] of the Spirit grace that we're not going
[56:21] to miss the revelation of the rapture
[56:24] amen
[56:25] and this is way many are going to mister
[56:27] rapture because they missed the
[56:29] revelation oh they got a doctrine they
[56:31] got the religion but they don't have the
[56:33] spiritual faith for the rapture amen
[56:36] and the thing that not that we aren't
[56:38] going to be raptured
[56:39] I am being raptured more and more and
[56:42] more in more and more easier given turn
[56:45] it over to God God has taken control
[56:47] until eventually he was changed in a
[56:51] moment in the twinkling and I so God
[56:54] Elvis brother that we're not going to be
[56:56] deceived by the devil a mayor and a
[56:59] brother that we're going to be in God's
[57:00] Eden not Satan seed by the grace of God
[57:04] and in Genesis chapter 4 and I'll try
[57:10] not to be too long but again as I was
[57:12] thinking don't hold your breath
[57:13] he met and in Genesis chapter 4 and
[57:17] verses 1 to 4 PI and Adam knew his new
[57:22] Eve his wife and she conceived and bare
[57:27] Cain and said I have gotten a man from
[57:31] the Lord but she had twins and this
[57:37] first one wasn't Adams it was a serpent
[57:40] and she again bare his brother Abel but
[57:45] just saying she said I gotten a man from
[57:47] the Lord well Satan was was was that
[57:52] there were her God because she believed
[57:55] him more than G OVA she allowed him to
[58:00] cause her to doubt what G / said they
[58:03] meant and it says an improv time know as
[58:08] she again bare his brother Abel and Ava
[58:12] was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a
[58:16] tiller of the ground and in process of
[58:20] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[58:23] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[58:25] unto the Lord and Abel he also brought
[58:31] of the firstlings of his flock and of
[58:34] the fat thereof and the Lord had respect
[58:38] unto Abel and to his offering but under
[58:42] Cain and is offering he said he had not
[58:47] respect does God have respect unto our
[58:50] offering
[58:52] God ever expect unto your offering god
[58:56] grace to us amen
[58:59] again but under Cain and his offering he
[59:02] had not respect and Cain was very wroth
[59:05] and his countenance fell
[59:08] god bless his words you may be seated
[59:10] and turn with me to the book of Romans I
[59:13] share with you the scriptures then get
[59:16] to some of the thoughts and the quotes
[59:18] again on the message
[59:21] Satan's Eden and in Romans chapter 8 and
[59:33] verse 1 to 4 and there is therefore now
[59:42] no condemnation to them which are in
[59:48] Christ Jesus
[59:50] if you are in Christ Christ in you and
[59:53] it says who walk not after the flesh but
[59:57] after the spirit we're not walking from
[1:00:02] the outside we're walking from the
[1:00:03] inside a man walking in the word for the
[1:00:09] law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:00:12] Jesus has made me free from the law of
[1:00:16] sin and death for what the law could not
[1:00:20] do in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:00:24] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:00:27] of sinful flesh a mayor and for sin
[1:00:33] condemned sin in the flesh made in the
[1:00:37] likeness of our flesh a man and God in
[1:00:41] him and through him condemned sin in the
[1:00:44] flesh praise the Lord
[1:00:51] verse two again with the law of the
[1:00:55] spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made
[1:00:57] me free from the law of sin and death
[1:01:00] grace thank God for what the law could
[1:01:05] not do in that it was weak through the
[1:01:07] flesh God sending his own son in the
[1:01:10] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:01:13] condemned sin in the flesh a man it is
[1:01:18] tremendous that he has forgiven our sins
[1:01:21] but as even more tremendous that he has
[1:01:24] forgotten them a man I don't know if
[1:01:28] you're aware of the young preacher not
[1:01:32] necessarily a message preacher but he's
[1:01:35] been preaching for a number of years but
[1:01:38] he was born without arms and without
[1:01:41] legs and he is on the internet and on
[1:01:45] YouTube and people are amazed that he
[1:01:49] would be a preacher people are amazed
[1:01:52] that he would believe in God being born
[1:01:55] without arms being born without legs but
[1:01:58] yet he's preaching the gospel amen and
[1:02:02] he believed that he is called of God and
[1:02:05] he travels around the world this is
[1:02:08] absolutely amazing because there's many
[1:02:11] a preacher brother that God has given
[1:02:12] arms God has given legs and brother they
[1:02:15] just not interested really and in going
[1:02:18] around the world not interested in doing
[1:02:20] this or doing that for God but this
[1:02:22] young man he is I would assume that he
[1:02:24] would be in his 30s now but he
[1:02:27] ministered one point there administered
[1:02:30] in a prison and that is online and he is
[1:02:36] ministering to prisoners and the chapel
[1:02:39] or the area where they gathered there
[1:02:42] are many many many prisoners and he well
[1:02:47] he can't stand behind a pulpit so they
[1:02:50] have to put a table on the platform and
[1:02:53] they place him on the table and he and
[1:02:57] brother and he doesn't have arms or
[1:02:59] hands to open his Bible so the only
[1:03:02] thing you God basically is one for
[1:03:04] well and it's not really a full foot but
[1:03:07] it looks like something sticking out
[1:03:09] there on and on the bottom but he used
[1:03:11] it as a foot and that's the thing that
[1:03:13] he that he uses to move his Bible around
[1:03:16] and the hope in his Bible
[1:03:18] yeah amazing absolutely amazing that he
[1:03:21] that he that he's there in such a
[1:03:23] condition
[1:03:24] but he's still preaching the word as God
[1:03:26] has revealed to him and and well as it
[1:03:30] was preaching all mine he struck them
[1:03:32] many many times and it cause of the just
[1:03:36] to applaud and clap and clap and clap
[1:03:39] and shout prisoners but the thing that
[1:03:43] really struck them was a statement that
[1:03:47] he made concerning forgiveness he said I
[1:03:50] want you to know he said that when you
[1:03:53] receive Christ as your Lord and your
[1:03:55] Savior
[1:03:56] he forgives your sin but he said I want
[1:04:00] you to know he said that he not only
[1:04:02] forgives your sin he said he forgets
[1:04:05] your sin he said you remember your sin
[1:04:08] but he doesn't well it struck them and
[1:04:11] then they just wanted to applaud and
[1:04:13] give God the glory praise the Lord
[1:04:16] hallelujah wonderful they had not heard
[1:04:18] it before he said your sin is forgiven
[1:04:21] and forgotten he said but it's it's in
[1:04:25] your mind it might be in your flesh but
[1:04:27] he said has gone from God a man because
[1:04:31] he said it is forgotten so it's again to
[1:04:34] remind us concerning the forgiveness in
[1:04:37] our Lord Jesus Christ why he condemned
[1:04:40] sin in the flesh a man and in the eyes
[1:04:44] of God according to your faith he
[1:04:46] doesn't remember seeing oh my lord I
[1:04:49] pray amen I pray that we got their faith
[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:53] then with all praise the Lord what I
[1:04:55] have confessed what I sought forgiveness
[1:04:57] for that he has forgiven and he met and
[1:05:00] he has cast it into the sea of his
[1:05:02] forgetfulness praise the name of the
[1:05:05] Lord
[1:05:05] Alleluia I'll tell you this the devil
[1:05:07] won't do that but God does it take the
[1:05:10] Lord the devil wants to remember but God
[1:05:12] doesn't want to remember so I pray grace
[1:05:15] as we approach God in prayer
[1:05:17] a man no matter what the need is there
[1:05:20] you go there with that revelation he has
[1:05:23] forgiven and he has forgotten and he
[1:05:25] doesn't look down at you and see that
[1:05:28] all your you did this you did this no no
[1:05:30] if you if you had faith it's gone he
[1:05:34] doesn't see it any man he sees all the I
[1:05:37] tell you what he sees he only sees the
[1:05:39] righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:41] amen because according to your faith
[1:05:44] he has imputed the righteousness of
[1:05:46] Jesus to you he took your sins I put in
[1:05:49] the sea of forgetfulness amen and took
[1:05:52] the righteousness of Jesus and placed it
[1:05:54] in your life amen this was absolutely
[1:05:56] wonderful
[1:05:57] thank God for that faith ain't man so
[1:06:00] the grace of God there brother that we
[1:06:02] are righteous in his in his presence we
[1:06:05] are righteous in the kingdom of God by
[1:06:07] the grace of God and he said why he
[1:06:09] condemned sin in the flesh and verse
[1:06:11] four that the righteousness of the law
[1:06:14] might be fulfilled in us
[1:06:17] amen and he should have walked not after
[1:06:22] the flesh but we walk after the spirit
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:26] I pray the grace of God than what you do
[1:06:29] whether it's your thoughts your words
[1:06:31] and your dates you're led by the spirit
[1:06:34] it is the will of God that you're
[1:06:37] expressing God in your thoughts you're
[1:06:39] expressing God in your words and your
[1:06:42] dates really you're expressing Jesus
[1:06:44] that's right when it comes to the
[1:06:47] thought you think you're going to
[1:06:48] express now and to think and the words
[1:06:50] and the deeds a man it's reflecting
[1:06:53] Jesus what it's why the same way that
[1:06:56] Jesus would walk the same way that Jesus
[1:06:58] would think what Jesus would do in the
[1:07:01] flesh
[1:07:01] 2,000 years ago now he's doing it in you
[1:07:04] amen amen
[1:07:07] he laid down his life now we lay down
[1:07:09] our lives praise the Lord

[1:09:07] till one day we let go Alleluia faith
[1:09:09] takes control and we're gone amen and
[1:09:12] we're gone in the resurrection were gone
[1:09:14] in the rapture by the grace of Almighty
[1:09:18] God brother he got control of Luther and
[1:09:21] yet we know Luther still did this and
[1:09:23] still did that but he knew he was
[1:09:24] justified oh yeah many of many today
[1:09:28] they today Christians today wouldn't do
[1:09:30] certain things that Luther did I won't
[1:09:32] mention what it was but Luther T there's
[1:09:34] something to that
[1:09:35] but yet he went forth and he was
[1:09:37] praising God and preaching the justified
[1:09:41] by faith
[1:09:42] he was justified he had that faith amen
[1:09:45] my brother but then God went on a little
[1:09:48] further with John Wesley amen because
[1:09:52] amen
[1:09:53] the justification is good but now
[1:09:55] sanctification that's good that they
[1:09:58] said to separate you from their separate
[1:10:00] you from that
[1:10:01] amen to get you ready for the baptism of
[1:10:03] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:10:05] so he would take this away take that
[1:10:07] away to desire for this the desire for
[1:10:09] that take it all away sanctification
[1:10:11] amen amen then you're ready for the
[1:10:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[1:10:17] of the Spirit amen
[1:10:18] CEI will restore said the Lord and
[1:10:21] beginning with Luther you were going on
[1:10:22] - Wesley going on - the Pentecostals
[1:10:25] well that's good
[1:10:25] but as I said previously that it that he
[1:10:29] didn't stop with the Pentecost amen and
[1:10:32] the Father God said this is the problem
[1:10:34] he's a Pentecost he said doesn't read
[1:10:36] doesn't recognize the crowning of the
[1:10:38] Pentecostal message amen and it's them
[1:10:41] it was the Mary was the the ministry of
[1:10:43] a prophet wherein God came to crown the
[1:10:46] Pentecostal message
[1:10:47] now listen they oh yeah brother Aeterna
[1:10:50] this that even under the Pentecostal
[1:10:51] message they knew that the next thing to
[1:10:53] happen was the rapture oh yeah they
[1:10:56] believe the Pentecostal message was
[1:10:58] going to put them in the rapture but no
[1:11:00] the Pentecostal actually gave him the
[1:11:02] bed they give their faith for the
[1:11:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts
[1:11:06] of the Spirit but not the rapture amen
[1:11:08] because the probably God highlights us
[1:11:10] what they got a what God's through the
[1:11:13] revelation of the mystery of God and of
[1:11:16] the opening of the seven seals he said
[1:11:18] God is giving the bride the revelation
[1:11:20] of the rapture giving the bride he's a
[1:11:22] rapturing faith Amen or brother gaga did

[1:12:37] first when I come to this word and only
[1:12:39] that they're believers are still doing
[1:12:41] and they look down their noses at this
[1:12:43] is their you know the Lutheran's and the
[1:12:45] Methodists and the Baptist they look

[1:13:51] thought we'll just get a greater and
[1:13:52] greater anointing no no amen it went
[1:13:55] through what God had done God was going
[1:13:58] to take him on to the opening of the
[1:13:59] word God would take a bird to the
[1:14:02] revelation of the mystery of God amen

[1:14:34] million the play went okay a guy a went
[1:14:37] to a climax and there was a tremendous
[1:14:39] Lutheran revival a greater Wesleyan
[1:14:42] revival and then there was a greater and
[1:14:45] a greater and a greater Pentecostal
[1:14:47] revival a man that went around the world

[1:15:11] the message revival for the opah the
[1:15:13] word to gave us a man give us faith not
[1:15:16] just for right or justification to give
[1:15:18] us faith not just with the baptism of

[1:17:56] from the dead and he and treaty turned
[1:17:59] him over to his mother amen
[1:18:01] there's no indication of no testimony

[1:18:06] or or that they were you know back in
[1:18:07] that day that they were going to follow
[1:18:09] Jesus they just went on rejoicing and
[1:18:13] praising God because why because too
[1:18:16] many back in that day Jesus was a
[1:18:17] prophet now that he was Messiah but they
[1:18:21] even though they though they didn't
[1:18:22] believe in VMs

[1:20:00] believe in the message but they're not
[1:20:02] in the message whatever either the

[1:20:15] but Pentecost is not in them brother I
[1:20:18] experienced that when I when I was
[1:20:19] associated with Pentecost amen and as
[1:20:23] time went on it was getting more and
[1:20:25] more and more that were Pentecostal but
[1:20:27] Pentecost wasn't in them that's the
[1:20:30] truth and they were getting away and
[1:20:31] more for further and further away from
[1:20:33] the Spirit he wasn't controlling that it
[1:20:35] was really
[1:20:36] they were religious but they weren't
[1:20:38] spiritual oh yeah I began to see this
[1:20:41] happening you know when I was racing in
[1:20:43] the end a certain sand in a certain
[1:20:45] church and they were they were there
[1:20:48] were more spiritual people there oh yeah
[1:20:49] yeah when I mean I was just young and I
[1:20:52] was in in the church that I was raised
[1:20:54] in or mine
[1:20:55] the denomination and I and what was
[1:20:58] going on they were spiritual but it got
[1:21:01] to the place where they got more and
[1:21:03] more religious and less spiritual amen
[1:21:07] I recognized the day and as he as a
[1:21:09] young boy I recognized it as a teenager
[1:21:12] in Pentecost a man now I'm beginning to
[1:21:14] see it even around the message they are
[1:21:16] religious but they are not spiritual
[1:21:19] amen if they're spiritual than Jesus is
[1:21:22] in their thoughts
[1:21:23] Jesus is in their words and Jesus in
[1:21:25] their deeds and not just in your words
[1:21:27] amen there are those that can talk this
[1:21:30] and talk that but what about thinking
[1:21:32] what's your what's your thoughts a man
[1:21:35] and what about your deeds oh well I'm in
[1:21:39] the message yeah but the message is not

[1:21:43] believers out there I'm in the message
[1:21:45] I'm in the message I'm in the message
[1:21:47] well the message not in them how do you
[1:21:48] know that because why because of their
[1:21:50] thoughts words and especially not just a
[1:21:53] word but their deeds thoughts and deeds
[1:21:56] anything is not Christ not reflecting
[1:22:01] Christ
[1:22:02] anyway it's reflecting more and more
[1:22:05] reflecting their human physical feelings
[1:22:09] their physical emotions amen do not does
[1:22:14] not the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:22:15] their heart in their hearts amen they
[1:22:18] might add the bathroom of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:19] in their flesh but not in their hearts
[1:22:22] probably God said you can be healed and
[1:22:24] go to hell yeah and you can add the
[1:22:27] bastion of the old it goes in your flesh
[1:22:29] and go to hell god help us brother that
[1:22:32] we can amen that people can be in the
[1:22:36] message and go to hell because the
[1:22:39] message is not in them amen why they're
[1:22:42] not spiritual if the message is in you
[1:22:44] your spiritual and the messages at us we
[1:22:48] are spiritual in our
[1:22:49] Saltz we are spiritual in our words and
[1:22:51] we are spiritual in our deeds not not

[1:23:03] discern spiritual from read religious
[1:23:06] grace of God give us the Holy Ghost in
[1:23:10] our sin our souls so that would deserve
[1:23:13] spirits probably God discerned it oh
[1:23:16] yeah he would get in in the anointing of
[1:23:19] the Spirit and let the smitten let it
[1:23:21] take control and he would discern
[1:23:22] whether this person added in their flesh
[1:23:24] or just in in or in their soul we knew
[1:23:28] he knew no wonder that the Prophet was
[1:23:33] disappointed no whether he felt grieved
[1:23:35] sometimes during prayer during a prayer
[1:23:40] praying for the sick grace of God to us
[1:23:44] amen let the spirit and will of God be
[1:23:49] in our thoughts our words and our deeds

[1:24:54] eight again but as verse 14 for as many
[1:25:00] as are led by the Spirit of God

[1:25:07] Spirit of God is controlling your
[1:25:08] thoughts words and dates amen
[1:25:11] you are the son of God you're a daughter
[1:25:13] of God for ye have not received the
[1:25:17] spirit of bondage again to fear but yet
[1:25:21] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:25:23] we cry Abba Father amen you look at that
[1:25:29] God is your heavenly father God is your
[1:25:31] father
[1:25:31] amen amen and because he's your father
[1:25:34] he's really truly sincerely your father
[1:25:37] by the Holy Ghost that's why you go and
[1:25:40] you all you think like your father you
[1:25:43] act like your father and you talk like
[1:25:44] your father
[1:25:45] that's why Jesus he talked like his
[1:25:48] father act like his father a man a man
[1:25:51] he walked like his father praise the
[1:25:54] Lord
[1:25:55] oh yeah I sometimes I can I can see your
[1:26:00] your natural natural parents in you oh
[1:26:03] yeah in the believers not just here but
[1:26:06] I talked to those at home as well amen
[1:26:09] oh yeah I see I see the the nature of of
[1:26:13] the natural mom the nature of my natural
[1:26:15] dead or grandma or grandpa yeah see that
[1:26:19] well what I'm looking for is the nature
[1:26:22] of Jesus the nature of God in control
[1:26:25] amen all that nature is still there but
[1:26:29] if you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:30] you're born to get your new creature in
[1:26:32] Christ amen the nature of God the nature
[1:26:35] of Jesus takes control
[1:26:37] a man got more preeminence than that
[1:26:40] worldly nature grace for as many as are
[1:26:46] led by the Spirit of God they are the
[1:26:48] sons of God for year not received the
[1:26:51] spirit of bondage again to fear but you
[1:26:54] see the spirit of adoption whereby we
[1:26:56] cry Abba Father amen brother the new
[1:27:02] birth puts us in God's Eden religion
[1:27:06] puts us in Satan seen a man as spiritual
[1:27:10] experience with God is God's Eden a man
[1:27:14] religious experience
[1:27:16] Satan's Eden and if you're in God's Eden
[1:27:19] you're worshipping God if you're in
[1:27:22] Satan's Eden you be worshipping the
[1:27:24] devil this is on mothers is almost
[1:27:29] unbelievable but it's true
[1:27:31] no wonder Jesus would say certain things
[1:27:34] and then he said believe us though this
[1:27:37] what well I'm this and I'm there
[1:27:42] believest thou this what you're asking
[1:27:46] me to believe that
[1:27:47] yeah god help us do you believe who you
[1:27:52] were
[1:27:54] grace of God mother
[1:27:59] let's make sure we're not where we are
[1:28:02] in Satan's Eden but make sure we're not
[1:28:04] worshipping Satan as many many minutes
[1:28:08] unfortunate on our to believe isn't it
[1:28:10] we wouldn't believe that if we were in
[1:28:13] in in a denomination of church this
[1:28:16] church or that church disti nomination
[1:28:18] that denomination not years ago we
[1:28:21] wouldn't believe this we wouldn't
[1:28:22] believe that oh oh this is Satan's e and
[1:28:25] Satan is the god of this denomination
[1:28:27] they're worshipping Satan we wouldn't
[1:28:29] believe it
[1:28:31] they thought they were worshipping God
[1:28:34] well it's unfortunate again that it's
[1:28:37] even around the message some think
[1:28:39] they're worshipping Jesus but they're
[1:28:41] worshiping the devil why because they
[1:28:44] got a religious spirit and again this is
[1:28:46] why the proud of God I lights these
[1:28:48] sermons before the Lord took him home he
[1:28:52] was nearing the end of his journey but
[1:28:55] he wanted to leave these these thoughts
[1:28:56] with us amen
[1:28:58] he wanted to leave it with us he said
[1:29:01] now he said there's certain things he
[1:29:02] says not striking me the way that it
[1:29:04] should not striking you the way that it
[1:29:06] should but he knew that down the road it
[1:29:08] was going to strike them there was a
[1:29:10] generation coming and it was
[1:29:11] strengthened the way that it should
[1:29:13] grace of God to us it's is striking us
[1:29:16] the way that God intends were to strike
[1:29:19] us amen so that we recognize it and
[1:29:23] we're on our guard
[1:29:25] and maybe this is why the Lord is
[1:29:26] leading me to to take so much time on
[1:29:28] the god of this evil age and now Satan's
[1:29:31] Eden amen
[1:29:32] is to put us on our guard a man to be on
[1:29:37] our guard when it comes to the different
[1:29:38] spirits that are moving in the air
[1:29:40] remember he said there's going to be
[1:29:41] false Christ's false anointed ones yeah
[1:29:45] false this all false this one and then
[1:29:49] the prophet of God said remember it's
[1:29:50] not a false Christ it's false Christ he
[1:29:55] said anointed preachers yeah and they're
[1:29:59] trying to get to getting control over
[1:30:01] this one control over that one god help
[1:30:03] us that Jesus got control over us amen
[1:30:08] Jesus brother Brown said that's your
[1:30:10] problem he said you can't see the other
[1:30:13] angel he said I am NOT the son of man he
[1:30:17] said I am a son of man revealing Dees on
[1:30:21] me any man but he knew that they were
[1:30:24] focusing on him they saw him but they
[1:30:27] didn't see Jesus brother
[1:30:30] I trust by grace that they that was that
[1:30:33] we're witnessing to the world that we're
[1:30:35] living in is going to see Jesus in us
[1:30:38] amen there's a prophet as I lighted that
[1:30:41] we go in we get into glory amen and
[1:30:44] we're going to judge those out there
[1:30:47] that refuse to believe and all that I
[1:30:49] didn't see Jesus I didn't see this and
[1:30:51] he said he will reflect you on on the
[1:30:53] screen and him why he lived in you amen
[1:30:59] you expressed his thoughts his words and
[1:31:02] his deeds it was Jesus God help us Amy
[1:31:10] let's be on our guard by the grace of
[1:31:14] God in Satan's Eden be on your guard
[1:31:17] let's make sure we're not worshiping
[1:31:19] Satan thinking we're worshiping Jesus
[1:31:26] do i brother this is not coming that bad
[1:31:31] as a brother journal it's gonna be worse
[1:31:33] because jesus said if he didn't shorten
[1:31:36] time to be no flesh saved because he
[1:31:40] said it's going to get so bad it would
[1:31:42] deceive the very elect if possible it's
[1:31:46] a bad it is deceive the very elect
[1:31:49] brother had to be close to the truth
[1:31:52] it had to be close to the likeness of
[1:31:56] Jesus yeah religious or we believe this
[1:32:01] we believe this we believe that you know
[1:32:03] oh my or they must be Christian no the
[1:32:06] devil believes it but he's not Christian
[1:32:12] god help us as many as are led by the
[1:32:18] Spirit of God they are the sons of God
[1:32:20] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:32:23] bondage again to fear no God help us but
[1:32:29] you ever see the spirit of adoption
[1:32:30] whereby we cry Abba Father a may and our
[1:32:34] father father father the spirit itself
[1:32:37] bears witness with our spirit that we
[1:32:40] are the children of God not the children
[1:32:44] of the devil but his Spirit bears
[1:32:46] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:32:49] children of God by the grace of God
[1:32:52] we're born of God and if children that
[1:32:56] heirs and heirs of God and joint-heirs

[1:35:56] I trust you didn't hold your breath
[1:36:01] amen just share with you a couple of
[1:36:05] thoughts because one of the Brethren
[1:36:09] felt it was good that if I if I did God
[1:36:13] of this evil age and then Satan's Eden
[1:36:15] that if I went on to the anointed ones
[1:36:18] at the end time oh that's good that's
[1:36:20] good
[1:36:21] I said well praise the Lord we'll see as
[1:36:24] that see what the Lord lead us to do a
[1:36:26] man because the next mr. got here is 90
[1:36:29] was at the end time brother it's a
[1:36:32] revelation of the what we're dealing
[1:36:34] with in the last days not in Luther's
[1:36:37] day not in Wesley State oh they had to
[1:36:39] deal with it but not on the measure that
[1:36:41] you and I got to deal with it
[1:36:43] no no because they knew Thursday was so
[1:36:46] small but God gave him the faith to
[1:36:48] overcome that and Wesley Said's the same
[1:36:51] thing the Pentecostal age more and so on
[1:36:54] but now rather we need it now under the
[1:36:57] resurrection and the rapture God's
[1:36:59] looking for more than justification
[1:37:01] sanctification and the baptism and the
[1:37:03] gifts cause looking for they perfect day
[1:37:07] yeah perfect faith amen
[1:37:11] what what do we need perfect faith for
[1:37:14] the rapture and Jesus needed to lay down
[1:37:17] his life and pick it up again now we
[1:37:19] need it to lay down our lives and pick
[1:37:20] it up again in the rapture and the
[1:37:24] resurrection amen why God's waiting on
[1:37:28] us now and the dead in Christ are
[1:37:30] waiting on us what for for the
[1:37:35] resurrection amen
[1:37:38] and the rapture are you ready
[1:37:43] are you getting ready are you spiritual
[1:37:46] or religious pray God that you don't
[1:37:49] have a religious spirit that you got the
[1:37:52] Holy Ghost amen and if the Holy Ghost in
[1:37:56] you he's bringing forth the word that we
[1:37:59] need for to give us rupturing faith amen
[1:38:03] what's ordained of God in these last
[1:38:05] days and it's it said that most
[1:38:08] believers brother are not conscious of
[1:38:10] what God's doing they know what God did
[1:38:13] but what's God doing oh well God brought
[1:38:17] us out of denominations into the message
[1:38:20] yeah but what what's he doing now oh
[1:38:22] we're in the mercies now yeah but what
[1:38:26] faith do you have the messages ordain
[1:38:30] predestinated to give us rapturing faith
[1:38:33] look like man look what Luther's message
[1:38:35] give him look what but Wesley's message
[1:38:40] give him the Perry castles work or what
[1:38:41] look what I give them
[1:38:42] what's he giving us grace to us amen

[1:41:00] second time you read it something else
[1:41:02] is striking amen and the third time and
[1:41:05] go on or not why a Amen got us free

[1:41:10] it to strike you a man as the powder
[1:41:12] gasa dis is not striking him the way it
[1:41:14] should never never struck them the way
[1:41:16] that it should
[1:41:17] but its generation coming that it would
[1:41:20] what for because that generation didn't
[1:41:23] have to go into rapture they'd be
[1:41:25] waiting on us to come to resurrection
[1:41:28] reffering faith amen brother Branham is
[1:41:31] waiting on us grace of God amen
[1:41:35] so brother god help us again like I said
[1:41:39] I won't be able to go in her and read
[1:41:40] all all of these things
[1:41:42] we'll see what the Lord will give just
[1:41:44] briefly
[1:41:50] he said I want to speak to you something
[1:41:52] to bring something easier to enlighten
[1:41:54] you
[1:41:55] he said the promise of God for this age
[1:41:59] meaning tell me in 1965 August that he
[1:42:04] hadn't preached enough to enlighten us
[1:42:07] concerning the resurrection concerning
[1:42:10] the rapture concerning his ministry
[1:42:11] because during the opening of the seven
[1:42:13] seals and so on no he said I want to
[1:42:16] speak to you something to bring
[1:42:19] something to enlighten to you the
[1:42:21] promise of God for this age what's the
[1:42:25] promise that he's going to highlight
[1:42:28] it's the rapture he says something he
[1:42:32] said not that somebody else in some
[1:42:35] other day but something for this day and
[1:42:38] he said those things are all right we
[1:42:40] all refer to those things but I thought
[1:42:43] I would try to bring something to your
[1:42:44] mind he said with these scriptures I've
[1:42:47] got written here and that would
[1:42:48] enlighten you easier to know and to make
[1:42:51] you a better soldier amen what after the
[1:42:57] opening of the after the preaching of of
[1:43:00] the series on Daniel as they're
[1:43:02] preaching of the series on the church
[1:43:03] ages preaching the seven seals
[1:43:05] he's now he felt that he had to preach
[1:43:08] this Satan Vidan that he had to preach
[1:43:15] this to enlighten us and I'll tell you
[1:43:18] this brother a lot of believers need to
[1:43:20] read it and read it and read it and read
[1:43:22] it and let it put them on their toes put
[1:43:25] him on their guard amen
[1:43:27] unless they be deceived by the devil
[1:43:30] lest they be in Satan's Eden more than
[1:43:33] in God's Eden lest a be worshiping the
[1:43:37] devil thinking they're worshiping God so
[1:43:41] he said I want to bring this to you and
[1:43:43] he said I would try to bring something
[1:43:45] to your mind with these scriptures and
[1:43:48] I've got written here that would
[1:43:50] enlighten you to know and to make you a
[1:43:53] better soldier in the field that you're
[1:43:56] fighting in now
[1:43:59] if we need to be enlightened then how
[1:44:01] much more do we need to be enlightened
[1:44:03] now and it's getting more deceiving and
[1:44:05] especially in the light of what's going
[1:44:07] on around the world I tell this bringing
[1:44:12] out a lot of things oh yeah in a lot in
[1:44:17] a lot of countries oh my oh my oh my
[1:44:20] where is faith well Jesus was right that
[1:44:27] it was so little he said when the Son of
[1:44:30] Man comes will he find date belief in
[1:44:36] the whole body of revealed truth you
[1:44:39] will find that much V very little of
[1:44:42] that could that that's what our brother
[1:44:44] highlighted here and in his notes he
[1:44:47] said when he can't really find faith and
[1:44:49] he said what faith is that he said it
[1:44:51] said belief him the whole body of
[1:44:53] revealed truth yeah
[1:44:57] no he's not gonna find much faith in
[1:44:59] that I tell you there's a lot of
[1:45:02] believers don't really believe believe
[1:45:04] the revelation of the whole body of
[1:45:05] reveal truth because it's why is there
[1:45:08] it's theater separator separate us
[1:45:10] separate us more and more from the world
[1:45:11] and the things of the world a may and
[1:45:13] make us more and more conscious of God
[1:45:15] but Jesus is in control of our thoughts
[1:45:17] words and dates more and more and more
[1:45:19] until finally we're spiritual from the
[1:45:23] inside out
[1:45:25] amen brother we wanted to separate they
[1:45:30] they'll separate from us their brother
[1:45:34] brother Brown did say the bride will
[1:45:36] have will have some friends oh yeah and
[1:45:39] Carlos ordained some friends there for
[1:45:41] the bride but it's not you're going out
[1:45:43] to them they'll be there to respect you
[1:45:45] oh yeah not believe what you believe but
[1:45:48] they'll be friends yeah but most people
[1:45:51] are pull away pull away or they're
[1:45:53] religious to religious no or not or
[1:45:55] spiritual or spiritual spiritual in our
[1:46:00] thoughts spiritually in our words

[1:46:07] thoughts okay with the devil is there to
[1:46:09] give you a wrong thought about your
[1:46:10] brother give a wrong thought about this
[1:46:12] sister wrong
[1:46:13] this one I thought of a Donald forget
[1:46:14] div segment those Sabres not the things
[1:46:18] that be of God get away she again has
[1:46:20] been on my mind concerning where the
[1:46:24] Lord told brother branham don't condemn
[1:46:26] that woman he said you can condemn what
[1:46:29] she does but don't condemn her he said
[1:46:32] some of them are my children amen
[1:46:39] he's called it a bride for the rapture
[1:46:41] but again they're not all lost God help
[1:46:45] us keep it right at it to keep the right
[1:46:47] spirit
[1:46:47] amen there's gonna be friends of the
[1:46:50] bride grace of God well one of these
[1:46:54] days we're gonna need them oh yeah we're
[1:46:57] gonna need him most you're going to walk
[1:46:58] away from us but there's gonna be a few
[1:47:01] there still respect us grace of God
[1:47:05] three siddhattha scripture said got
[1:47:08] written here that will enlighten you to
[1:47:10] know and to make you a better soldier
[1:47:13] grace God a better soldier the message
[1:47:17] Satan seen make you a better soldier so
[1:47:20] you'll know your enemy you have a
[1:47:22] greater revelation of your enemy your
[1:47:25] enemy won't deceive you grace a man he
[1:47:31] said better soldier in the field that
[1:47:33] you're fighting in now he said that you
[1:47:39] will learn the tactics of the enemy amen
[1:47:42] and there's a lot of believers have been
[1:47:45] deceived by the devil they never learned
[1:47:48] the tactics of the enemy and he says you
[1:47:52] can block everything before he gets to
[1:47:54] you he said that is the main thing to
[1:47:58] learn to keep the punches off you as
[1:48:00] much as you can amen god help you then
[1:48:05] when the devil punches you you'll punch
[1:48:08] him back get behind me Satan you can
[1:48:11] have that back but don't don't turn
[1:48:14] around and punch somebody else punch the
[1:48:17] devil
[1:48:19] too many punching this one punching that
[1:48:21] one punches this brother function that
[1:48:23] sister punching this this person that
[1:48:25] person no don't do that keep your
[1:48:27] attitude right keep your spirit right he
[1:48:33] said I don't believe there ever was a
[1:48:35] day that I had ever read in history
[1:48:37] there has been greater days of
[1:48:39] persecution when the children of God
[1:48:42] were put to death on every hand but to
[1:48:45] see the deceitfulness of the enemy we
[1:48:49] never had a day like this day we're now
[1:48:51] living it is the most cunning and the
[1:48:54] most deceitful day and when I see that
[1:48:56] it brings this that the question has to
[1:49:00] be more on his toes today than ever in
[1:49:03] any age why because the enemy is there
[1:49:10] with a religious spirit you take you
[1:49:12] take what you believe no matter how
[1:49:14] right it is in your doctrine and instead
[1:49:16] of a spiritual you make your religious
[1:49:19] it becomes a religion not a spiritual
[1:49:22] experience so the brother branham is
[1:49:26] warning us warning venom tabernacle of
[1:49:29] the age that we're living in of the
[1:49:34] deceitfulness of the if there's ever an
[1:49:35] hour that we needed to have the
[1:49:37] revelation of the sequence is this hour
[1:49:39] that we be not deceived please don't let
[1:49:45] the disc devil deceive you and your
[1:49:46] thoughts your words your deeds you can
[1:49:49] think wrong act wrong or or talk wrong
[1:49:52] you and then again you might see more
[1:49:55] this is all right that's all right no no
[1:49:57] it's it's not the will of God is it the
[1:50:00] will of God in your thoughts
[1:50:04] is it the will of God in your words is
[1:50:09] it the will of God in your deeds because
[1:50:11] we think oh well I I can do this I can
[1:50:14] do that I guess and they say that we say
[1:50:17] this we say something to be careful you
[1:50:21] could condemn yourself you know caught
[1:50:25] up mercy on us
[1:50:28] see God told the Prophet be careful what
[1:50:31] you're saying about that person because
[1:50:34] some of them are my children
[1:50:36] what yes not bright but they're gonna be
[1:50:40] there and again it's just like that in
[1:50:42] the restaurant you know you know the
[1:50:44] story that he was sitting there and he
[1:50:47] looked over and saw that woman sitting
[1:50:48] there at the table and I think her hair
[1:50:51] was dyed maybe and chopped off and
[1:50:53] wearing worldly clothes and she was and
[1:50:56] he was criticizing her yeah and that's
[1:51:00] when the angel called him aside and
[1:51:01] showed him the vision and brother Braun
[1:51:05] saw his mistakes going on what he made
[1:51:08] when he was young and he saw them going
[1:51:10] up and Jesus caught him it would have
[1:51:14] condemned him and brother Brown and the
[1:51:17] Lord told brother Brown we said there
[1:51:19] goes you but for the grace of God he
[1:51:22] said don't condemn her
[1:51:23] you can condemn what they do but don't
[1:51:26] condemn them god help us keep your
[1:51:31] spirit right keep your attitude right
[1:51:32] any man let's reflect salvation reflect
[1:51:36] redemption in our thoughts words and
[1:51:40] deeds a man he said now he said the
[1:51:46] cunningness of the devil makes people he
[1:51:48] should believe their Christians when
[1:51:51] they are not and makes them believe
[1:51:54] they're believers when they're not
[1:51:55] believers god help us that we love the
[1:51:59] Lord we love his word and we're living
[1:52:02] for Jesus we're living for his word
[1:52:04] thank you Jesus this is wonderful the
[1:52:06] Blessed hope that your word gives me of
[1:52:09] the resurrection the rest thank you
[1:52:11] Jesus
[1:52:12] don't leave me behind lord please I pray
[1:52:16] Lord that I want missed the rapture by
[1:52:18] the grace of God he said the cunningness
[1:52:24] of the devil makes people believe that
[1:52:26] they're Christians when they are not it
[1:52:30] is a more cunning day than it would be
[1:52:32] when you had to seal your life away with
[1:52:36] your testimony oh yes it's more cunning
[1:52:38] more deceitful now
[1:52:39] than it was back there when people laid
[1:52:41] down their lives physically God's asking
[1:52:44] us to lay down our lives spiritually
[1:52:46] mentally emotionally lay it all down and
[1:52:49] let's reflect Christ the most deceitful
[1:52:55] day that ever lived
[1:52:57] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:52:59] elect of God if it were possible for him
[1:53:02] to deceive is a world that is lovers of
[1:53:06] pleasures more than lovers of God I'll
[1:53:11] finish with this quote here and it's
[1:53:16] only page five amazing listen he said

[1:58:06] brother Matthew did it or not that he
[1:58:09] did text me a paragraph and the
[1:58:13] challenge was finds was it's 1616 Bible
[1:58:17] words in in the paragraph I found all 16
[1:58:22] now and there were something that wasn't
[1:58:25] so easy to find so I would I was child
[1:58:29] as a brother to send it to all the
[1:58:31] believers a man see if you can find the
[1:58:33] 16 Bible books of the Bible and that's
[1:58:38] what it is 16 books of the Bible and
[1:58:40] there is one there that you should have
[1:58:43] no problem finding and that is job a man
[1:58:48] but you got to know the difference
[1:58:49] between job and a job a man so you'll
[1:58:53] find that that book it was good it was
[1:58:55] really really good it was a challenge
[1:58:57] it's very in a sense of this challenge
[1:58:59] to our faith when it comes to believing
[1:59:01] the Word of God
[1:59:03] a man and of course the first one the
[1:59:07] first book it you will find all due
[1:59:09] respect but is mark and I said I said
[1:59:16] brother Mark is the first one so so
[1:59:19] you'll find that one for sure no problem
[1:59:22] so with the others it's a to be a
