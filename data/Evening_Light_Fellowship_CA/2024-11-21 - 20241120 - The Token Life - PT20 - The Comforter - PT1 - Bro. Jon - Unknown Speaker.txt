want to remember brother vichel of course as he's TR traveling brother Dale as well in particular amen that God's grace would be with them both as you can see I'm dealing with yet another eye infection so as brother Chad says at least now I look like a real Pastor so so I think that's what matters most is if you look like one right no no that's not what matters most amen amen I sure appreciate you brother Chad that's okay that's okay amen it's good to be back here tonight though just trusting the Lord I'll just speak and encourage amen I know it's a very familiar scripture we've read it so many times but like I said before when you're preaching on something like the Holy Ghost well scriptures about the Holy Ghost you tend to read them a lot because they have so many different angles and and thoughts that you could focus on so we're going to take a different thought this evening than we have for a while amen John 14-6 says this and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you let's jump down to verse 26 it says but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things into your to your remembrance whatsoever I have said to you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth I give it give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid let's continue on verse 28 he says ye have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you if you loved me ye would Rejoice because I said I go unto the father for my father is greater than I and now I have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing our series of course on the Holy Ghost on the token life and I want to preach on the comforter tonight and we're going to take at least a couple services on this there's a whole lot to dig into amen but you know as I was thinking about this and I was sitting down in my office I thought what does comfort mean to us and you know we all have our own little definition of comfort but I think as new finlanders and people living in New Finland at least um we we have probably a common version of comfort and the comfort is usually when the wind is howling outside and it's either raining or snowing or both simultaneously and there's roads are slick or wet and nobody wants to go outside our our our picture of comfort is to sit in our living room with a fireplace on if we have it with a hot drink next to us and some snacks on the coffee table in front of us and we just relax we don't have to go do anything we don't have to we have no obligations we just get to sit there and we get to enjoy the comfort that we have amen we've got a roof over our head we've got warmth we've got heat we've got food we've got good Fellowship we've got our family around us and and everything is good we don't we aren't forced to go out into those sorts of things amen and then when we're all done with it all there's a warm bed waiting for us that's a comfort for us amen especially in a place that has a climate like we have here in newf land but you know for some of us our comfort may be different it may be that our bank account has thousands of dollars in it rather than the hundreds it used to and see once you get the thousands then your comfort becomes the tens of thousands and then maybe as you're getting close to retirement by God's grace you might have hundreds of thousands in there and your comfort is not so much in the money but what the money represents as you come to another place in your life and another season in your life some of us are Comforts are family that we have a closeness around us we have a family that's tight-knit we have a a church body we have a Ministry perhaps those sorts of things and we have all that comfort and support that we need and that's a great comfort to us you know when we went through covid-19 I I I guess it ought not to amaze me but I I there were so many people and talking to them at work and and covid-19 was so difficult for them and for me it honestly didn't have much of impact in some ways it was much better because what I got was all of my time was spent around Believers and that was a wonderful thing I didn't have any real loss of friendship or or spending time with people but that was the comfort that I needed at that point was the thing that's always with me which is the church body the body of Christ and so it was a great time for me in many ways you know we had Samuel born just three or four weeks before they shut everything down and it was one of the greatest things in Blanca's life I think was when the world shut down so she she could stay at home with her new baby it was a great comfort she didn't have to go around like that amen but the danger always comes when we focus on Comfort rather than growing and maturing amen when we focus so much on comfort and ease we tend to go two directions we either go overboard to try and get the Comfort or we stop trying in the first place to retain our comfort we rarely stay right in the middle because we don't want to be stretched to apply ourselves and we don't want to to to relax too much either brother brah said something very interesting when I was studying on this he says now we find all those things are because people are trying to find Comfort he was talking about alcohol he was talking about sensuality he was talking about all the pleasures of the world and the things that people do with their time and their money he says all those are because people are trying to find comfort and he says remember your comfort is your religion he says and you make those things your religion because people you find what they shift themselves to what they look for what they seek on a daily basis that is their comfort and it becomes their religion it becomes their belief system it comes the thing that drives them to get up in the morning or to not get up in the morning as the case may be it becomes a way of life it becomes a belief system for it but there Comes A Time there Comes a Day there comes a season where your comfort is going to be taken away where it's not going to do what it always did before amen the bank account starts to go down instead of up your health starts to fade sickness starts to come in families start to have internal feuds churches split Ministries fall they may fail they may leave all these things we there's no guarantee to the Christian uh to the believer that all of these things are always going to be there in the way that we want them amen and so what happens is when those things go down that's when we need a real Comfort because a real Comfort can't be lost when the circumstances change that's the that's what a real Comfort is is that it's there so that no matter what the circumstances are you're in a place of peace and rest and you're trusting and you're believing amen you look at Paul Paul never said that we'd never have hard times but Paul said I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread and yet Paul's testimony was full of times where he was scared for his life and he was being rejected and he was being beaten and he was being put in prison and yet Paul knew what it meant to have a comforter so the comforter is not there to keep you from those situations it's to take you through those situations that's why we need a comfort amen that's the contrast to the hardship or the difficulty that we're going through when the sun is shining and the weather's nice and and there's lots of things to do kids don't need comfort kids don't come running to Mama when everything's good when do they come running to Mama when they're hungry when they've fallen down and scraped their knee or or falling off their bike and bang their head on the sidewalk like ours have done that's when they come running in for comfort and they're and what do they do they come up to Mama or daddy and they wrap them up in their arms and they hold them close and they they murmur soft and loving and soothing things to them or they give them the food they need and they bandage them up that's what Comfort is for it's not for the good times it's for the hard times amen comfort's always there for the difficulty time for the difficult times and so when Jesus said the comforter is coming what was he telling us good times are ahead no he's saying you're going to need a comforter that's why it's coming is because tough times are ahead hard times are ahead trial times are ahead and the whole church said I can't I'm so happy brother John's preaching on trials and tribulations tonight but the fact is if you've got a comforter it's for a reason and it's because times are going to be tough amen Jesus had told them all these things listen we we we read this before but he said these things have I spoken you he's told them all sorts of things good and bad he says these things have I spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace and then he says in the world you shall have tribulation see there's two places there's a place of peace and there's a place of tribulation and they are not one in the same place in him is peace and in the world is tribulation and you can be in those two places simultaneously he says but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world he's told them good things he's told them bad things amen but it look look he's telling them all these things he says cuz there's going to come a time where things look so bad and you don't know what's going on he says you're going to be you need to remember what I've told you when things look dark when things look like there's no way to come through them when everything is shattered you know when they're at that day of Calvary perhaps their entire Faith was shattered because everything they thought he would be everything they thought he would do he hadn't done it maybe the way they thought and he says you got to remember when that time comes there that your peace is in me it's not in what's happening in the world but look at his final words there he says be of good cheer Encourage Yourself when these times come when the good times come have the same attitude as when the bad times come that you can be at peace when these things happen that's what he's saying no matter what's happening be of good cheer amen we know that life isn't easy but sometimes we need a reminder that we're told it's not going to be easy for the believer in this world we've got to know what's coming down the road and it's not always going to be easy it's not always going to be simple amen why cuz God's developing character in you and I and character only comes through T trials and testing remember we we preached last service I think it was on the leyan church age the remedy that they were given was Godly character and that only comes through testing it comes through purification amen it's not easy here because we're pilgrims and strangers We Don't Belong we don't fit in and that makes it difficult amen but our comfort as he gives it here is that he's already told us it's coming and then he gave us a promise at the end what's his promise I have overcome the world whatever you've dealing with whatever you're facing whatever your struggles are whatever your sickness is whatever your hardship is I have already overcome it so what ever you're going through you can have rest that I will take you through it because I've already overcome like you said we're in time he's speaking from eternity but he pulls us through that time into eternity by a victory he's already given it's a finished work amen our comfort is that he told us it's coming and there's already a victory promised for it that's our comfort not that we're going to go through it easy but that when we go through it there's already a victory waiting for it brother R had this beautiful quote got just a couple little hooks this evening for this he says God has not promised a flowery bed of ease he says he promised a battle yes but he promised Victory that's the thing amen I don't want to spend this evening talking about the battles even though we will certainly for some time but the comfort for us tonight is that there's always a victory at the end of the battle no matter what it is whether it's sickness and whether it's financial hardship or marriages Church issues family issues whatever it might be there is Victory awaiting for us whether we go by way of the Grave or whether we continue here with the breath of life that he's given us he said you'll be in for a battle but there's always a victory that's waiting for the believer at the end of this amen he has already overcome those things you say well that's good for him what about me well he said you've got to be in me to get the victory you've got to be in me to have the peace it's in Christ that we have these things my rest is in Christ my peace is in Christ my joy is in Christ my victory is in Christ on my own I have no good thing here I'm not going to make it through but in him is where my peace and rest is amen I've got the victory through Jesus Christ my Lord he's the comforter he already declared that watch how Jesus phrases this statement as we go back to our scriptures that we started with because I want you to see how the Holy Ghost Will Comfort you amen mamas do it with hugs and they do it with kisses and they do it with treats and and bandages and these things but let's see what the comfort will do for us he says in John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said to you so he I I'm not here to say that the presence of God isn't to comfort it is I'm not here to say that the emotions and the and the feelings of the presence of God are are not of comfort they absolutely are amen I'm but what I'm telling you is that we've got to go to what the word says would be his comfort and his comfort here it comes two ways the comfort of the Holy Spirit comes I sorry I didn't click that maybe I went too far yes there we go he said what I will teach you and I will remind you that's the comfort of the holy spirit amen what will he teach you and everything that Jesus said and what will he remind you of everything that Jesus said and mean that is the comfort that we have if you want to know if the holy spirit is speaking he'll take you back to what Jesus said and if you want to know what to do in the situation he'll remind you of what Jesus said amen and he'll stir up your pure what Minds by way of remembrance amen but I want to say this tonight before we go too much further and brother Brandon would warn us of it that sometimes the worst inspiration comes in the most spiritual place places I can't tell you the things that I have people tell me come not necessarily here but I've come out of service and people have listened to the same sermon that I have and they come out with an idea and it's absolutely contrary to the word why because Satan is sitting in these pews trying to influence us because we know that Satan is a religious spirit to the believer and so everything he's doing is to get you just slightly off the word of God and so his inspiration will seem spiritual it will seem religious it will seem right amen he's trying to get us off of the track amen he's trying to get a wedge in there amen and we know that his inspiration will be so close that it will deceive the very elect if it were possible it won't deceive us but it's going to be so close it's almost impossible to discern it's going to take the Holy Spirit to do that and so that means that everything we hear everything we're inspired to do everything we have an unction to do we take it back to the word of God listen John said this he says beloved believe not every Spirit he says but try the spirits whether they are of God that means there are those that are and that means there are those that are not whether we like to believe it or not even within the church he says because many false prophets are gone out into the world see we look at that as Lord pre preserve us from the false prophets but what he's saying is you've got to realize those false prophets believe that they are true prophets others have not tried the Spirits by the word and they've got a Ministry now and it's taking not only them to hell but it's taking the people under their Ministry to Hell people got pulled away because they didn't test the spirit of their Revelation or their inspiration by the word of God we always check it with the word of God and you know so many times I know I've said this before it Bears repeating people people will say well the word doesn't say I can't do what I'm going to do and that may be true but you have to see what the effect of what you're going to do has because if it gets you into a place where you stop doing what the word says you're ought to do then that cannot be of God it cannot be the Holy Spirit leading to leading you and if it's changing you from what you ought to be into what you ought not to be again it cannot be of God Amen don't just look for the do Nots look for the dos and make sure that what you're doing doesn't keep you from doing what the word says for you to do as well Paul said this to Timothy he said all scripture is given by inspiration of God that means you can't throw one scripture out and it also means you have to take every single scripture into account amen that word inspiration it's funny because it's not actually the correct word inspiration means to take in but that word inspiration is actually supposed to be spiration in other words it's the breathing out of God in other words every the scripture is the breathing out of God Amen it's not breathed in by God it's breathed out by God it's his literal Breath of Life and then it is inspired into us he breathes it out and we breathe it in amen that's what it really is you know we sing that song this is the air I breathe that's literally what the word of God is it is the breath the life of God that's what it's saying right there amen he he breathes it out we breathe it in he says all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be what perfect thoroughly fished unto all good works we preached last service we we preach all the time really that the holy spirit will only point you back to the word of God it will point you to thus sayith the Lord every time because that's what it is amen it'll take you back to the absolute that's what Jesus said the comforter will do it'll take you and it'll teach you and it'll remind you of what Jesus said but what's this effect of when he comes and teaches you and reminds you we read it in the opening scripture he said this peace I leave with you he says my peace my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you he says the world can give you peace and then I can give you peace and they are not the one and the same thing he says look when I give you my piece this is the effect let not your trouble let not your heart be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid remember we read in this in the opening scripture he says when it comes to pass ye might believe Church By the time it's happened whether you believed or not is irrelevant so what's he trying to tell us he's saying when what I told you would happen happens let that Inspire your faith for the rest of the things that I told you were going to happen let your faith be built on faith let your faith be built bu on the experience of the reality of the word coming to pass so that for the next stage of your journey you'll believe for that and the next one and the next one so you can build line upon line word upon word here a little there a little and keep growing and maturing so that you can be perfect and thoroughly furnished amen when it's already happened that's not the time for Faith that's there to give you faith for the next time it's supposed to happen for the next stage of your journey amen you know it's amusing these days now that the election in the United States is is over we're facing one for Canada how people are so caught up in the great changes that have been promised make America great again make Canada great again pick your pick your slogan pick your politician amen people look at the changes that are happening and some see great destruction going to happen and some see like everything that they've ever dreamed is going to happen and they're so caught up in that amen but I'm telling you tonight and the scriptures tell us that peace that rest has no basis for the believer there is nothing in it amen there may be some things that improve for the better for Christians I'm not saying it wouldn't but what I'm saying is the system is broken the system is rotten and yes I believe in democracy and there is no better system for this world as it is today but we know there's a new system coming in that's a theocracy where God himself is the king he's the light he's the judge he's the ruler amen that's the only way it's going to work amen this world is broken all of its systems are broken there's nothing good in it amen Jesus said the peace I'm giving you isn't the peace that the world is going to give you why because the Peace of this world isn't even real it's temporary it's not even real it's a sham remember what Paul said in Thessalonians he says but of the times and the seasons Brethren Brethren ye have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety when they shall shall say Trump is going to make it all better when they say PV is going to make it all better pick your poison pick your politician he's saying then sudden destruction comes upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape in other words when things look like they're getting better that's the time they're going to get worse and not only that it's going to happen like this sudden destruction like a woman having a baby one minute you're sitting there and the next the contractions hit I've heard and you say oh my goodness here it comes you may have had a few little things happen but when it really hits there's no go there's no going back after that point it's started and there's nothing coming back and everything comes crashing down and nobody will see it coming and nobody will escape that judgment amen but we're preaching on the comforter tonight are you feeling comforted yet remember he's for the bad times not just for the good times amen the comforter is the only way to escape what first Thessalonians 5 is talking about that's the only way we're going to get out amen that's the Comfort we have is that we have him indwelling inside of us that's our eternal life that's our peace and rest and joy but brother bam he's talking about the condition of the world and he's talking about how people are trying to be how people are influenced and he says this he says you can't believe nothing hardly but the Bible you know we we've had such a a backlash against media in these days and again I I don't want to speak about politics I don't believe the pulpit is a place for it but we've seen how they've the world has turned on them because they don't believe they can trust them but what's amazing is where they run with their trust now they run to people that agree with them regardless of what the data and the facts may say everybody's running for the sides nobody's running for the truth brother says you can't believe nothing hardly but the Bible we still have Christ thank to God he says for instance when you turn your television off you that have such and see the commercials well if a person tried to live by 100th of those commercials you'd die in a week if you look at everything they're telling you to put on your skin put down your your to to eat to drink to not eat to not drink you'd either be full of food or you'd have no food you you'd look like a clown he says and the very thing that some company will break down like a product and say this is the thing here and don't have this one over here the same company sells the same product then another commercial will come out and say take this on this side and not that and it's the same company somebody's selling you two things that are completely opposite and they're selling you both and saying take them both talking out of both sides out of their mouth he says the American people fall for such stuff as that you know what it's not just the Americans sisters sister Amber sister Blanca sister Priscilla it's not just you it's everybody it's everybody till the whole thing has become rotten until there's no hope at all I'm trying to show you why we need a comforter nobody knows what to believe listen I don't care how objective it comes across the news I don't trust any of it anymore unfortunately even when they're objective I wonder if they're hiding something behind their objectivity cuz I don't know what I don't know he says nobody knows what to believe the people they lie they cheat they steal to you almost have to have a bond of security to borrow $5 from somebody you know the Bible speaks that there be no love in the last days but just amongst the elect people that's right the scripture speaks of that that the husband will be against wife wife against husband and children against parents can I tell you the most crazy thing I've heard of children's against parents a woman has sued her parents for not getting her consent to conceive her grown woman okay that doesn't even make sense and if she feels so strongly about it she has options but she sued her parents because they didn't ask her permission to conceive her it it makes no sense I agree sister it makes no sense the world is insane that's where we're at I'm trying to tell you it's it's closer than you think okay it's closer than you think he says just among the elected of the Lord will there be any love left he says now we find out that the churches too are always promising something like television and so forth that they never get to the thing they promised as I have often said an old quotation man is always praising God for what he did praising God for what he will do looking forward to what he will do and then ignore what he's doing see they fail and that's the way they become polluted history after a while is because they fail to re recognize now they are they fail to recognize what's going on in the here and now and I want to stop there because we'll see this issue coming up time and time again as we go through this little portion on the comforter amen because our comfort comes for not just looking as to what will be or what has been but the purpose of the comforter is for the Here and Now what's the purpose of a comforter in the future I need the comforter now I need it for what's going on in my life amen and we need to see where we are by the word of God Amen if I can find my position if I can find my time my age my season my test my trial and it lines up with the word of God then I've got reason to say I can have the comforter cuz I see where I'm at amen but the challenge is always brother BR saying will we recognize what's going on as we're going through it rather than with perfect 2020 hindsight what's the point of realizing what you've been through if you didn't have the Comfort to go through it we want it when we're going through it amen remember you know was I as I was studying this because what happens is we set our our minds on a thing and we say this is the way it's going to be this is the way it's going to happen this is the way it's going to show it and then when it doesn't happen the way we think it does we miss what really happened and I there's lots of examples of this in the scripture but it it struck me as I was studying that when Jesus was coming into Jerusalem his Triumph entry he's riding on a cult and the scriptures said exactly how he would come in and he's riding in on the cult and they don't recognize what's happening the disciples don't the people don't but then it says in John 12 it says these things understood his disciples not at the first he says but when Jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him see the hard part is when the word is happening in front of you both the good and bad can you re recognize where you're at can you recognize what's going on that's what the word is supposed to do that's what the holy spirit is supposed to do is to open our eyes of Revelation so that we can understand the season we're in so we can catch the word for That season so we can have a comforter to take us through to the other side that's what he's supposed to be doing amen we read before a couple Services ago we're not the children of Darkness we're the children of light that means we're supposed to see and understand clearly what's going on around us how by the word of God and even then church I'll say it again it's later than you think even when we think we've got it all figured out I'm telling you it's later than we think not just politically not just socially not just religiously not just economically amen we can see those things clearly but the challenge is to see where I am in all of those things happening amen when I'm facing hard times when you're facing battles when you're struggling things are tough that's when we're looking for the light and the comfort of the Holy Spirit to let us know what's going on in our lives amen that we can see there's a purpose for it in these things and when we do that what we see is our response will show us where we are at anden we're we're a bride that's supposed to be getting ready to go in a Rapture that means our our maturity ought to be changing our response our way of reacting to things ought to be changing how I reacted last year to something should be completely different from what I did this year if I was immature in that area maybe I'm mature that's okay but the thing is we ought to be able to see that our response is improving by the word as we grow in life and that things that used to knock us back things that used to hold us back things that used to hinder us now they don't hinder us anymore why because we're growing in Grace in the word of God day by day by day is it Faith or doubt when things don't go the way we wanted it to go what comes up Faith or doubt when we don't know what to do is it the word or is it worldly wisdom that'll tell you where you're at in the word cuz we ought to see ourselves there says it this way he says you can talk of the Comfort Christ gave once and say that a comfort he will give in the ages to come but refuse the comfort that he's got here now for you he says see it's on the same basis that we find that how do we find comfort in the things that are to come by the word we see it coming how do we see on the things that are passed by the word so how do you have comfort in the things that are here by the word amen we read last service in Revelation 3 of the leosan church age and we saw they were spiritually delusional we saw that they had a religious spirit of self-deception and it's only by the mercy and grace of God that we can come out of that because there was no merit there was no goodness in that last Church nothing there it was the only one that God had nothing good to talk about amen but we saw that remedy was three things it was the character of God so that means you had to lay your own down it was the righteousness of God so you had to lay your self-righteousness down and then the third thing was the revelation of God the IAP for your eyes that you could see and everything everything there goes hand in hand because God's calling out a bride that's without spot without wrinkle Washed by the word matured by the tutoring of the Holy Spirit adopted into the body of Christ by that same spirit and that's what's happening here tonight whether you can feel it or not whether you can see it or not whether you can recognize or not the word that is quickened by the holy spirit is doing that work in each and every one of our Lives tonight just a little bit sometimes sometimes we get a big leap God does a real work for for us in a service or something but it's just a little bit here a little there a little line upon line as we were talking about earlier amen but it's happening nonetheless but Jesus said in John 15 he says when the comforter has come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning now we said earlier that the Holy Spirit Comforts by two things teaching and reminding us and Jesus says here that in verse 26 the comforter will testify of me he'll testify of Jesus Christ now that's a wonderful thing and I'm thankful for that but it does me no good for him to testify if I don't get into verse 27 because verse 27 is what makes me a part of it rather than me just seeing it or me just understanding amen our comfort is complete when we have the experience of verse 27 that says and ye shall also bear witness amen the testimony can't be out there the testimony can't just be in brother Chad it's got to be in me it's got to be in you it's got to be something that we're a part of Amen we've got to be a witness of the teaching and reminding effect of the Holy Spirit and the comfort that comes from those things watch how the prophet of God explains it he says but then if we'll just live close to him he'll provide something else for us you get close to God and what will he provide he said he'll provide you an Insight that we can see what the ordinary person never sees when we're born again we see him see he says you know him you've seen him he'll abide with you forever oh he's a good father he's a fountain of goodness the great resource of all goodness and fatherhood belongs in our God he is so good to his believing children so what is the what is the Insight that he's given us it's the realities of God in our personal lives amen it's the reality of the word amen that we could find comfort in it the Holy Spirit can't just be an emotion it can't just be a church experience it's got to be the living proof of the word in our lives for this day amen our witness is that we have the Holy Spirit is when he takes the word and it comes down and takes hold of our life and produces that word in you and in I amen that's our Insight that's our advantage that's that's our Assurance that's our comfort amen and if we won't limit the word of God the word of God will give us the reality of Jesus Christ theive and well today let me say that again if we won't limit it it'll give us the realities of Jesus Christ in our lives today amen that's what the word the the world is saying that's what the church world is saying is they're saying the days of Miracles are passed they're saying that only the disciples had it they're saying the Holy Ghost is not what they say it is they're saying it's only for the ministry whatever they might do and they limit it they limit the healing of the word they limit the the the direction of the word all of these different things and their unbelief limits the holy spirit because their eyes aren't open to it they can't see it they can't receive it and therefore it can't do anything for them amen they come and they put a cap on what Christ has said by their own doctrines by their own Traditions by their denominations whatever it might be their human understanding and when they do that they lose the opportunity for the reality of Jesus Christ in their life today they may have a reality but they'll lose the full reality they'll never go all the way Amen brother says it this way he says it's our privilege it's this sacred trust that God has put to his church God gave his word to his church and that sacred Heritage is ours it's a gift from God not to just compromise on this and cut this out and throw this out and add this in to suit our own taste but to preach the full word the whole gospel he says we are Duty bound as Christians to take it and believe it and he says when we know if our hearts condemn us not then we know that we have favor with God and if we ever expect this word ever to ever come to pass if we ever expect God to keep his word we've got to do one thing stay with it just the way that God wrote it and mean God help us not to change it for our situations amen he says that's the reason if you stay with it the way God wrote it there will be all kinds of things happening among you every word will be fulfilled if you'll stay with it exactly the way it's written he says I'm under expectations just now myself I've seen a shaking power come that will shake the Nations pretty soon after everything that happened in this ministry he says I believe there's more why cuz the word said there's more that's why he believed it he says if God can ever get a people under his own control if he'll get a man or a woman that won't compromise on his word but will stand there like the Rock of Ages that will believe every word of it and believe that he is behind it he says and a man who believes it you must act like it if you don't act like it then you don't believe it that's the great test will you act on it he he says but if you believe it act like it and you can put it to work and the word will live and the word will be in you he says we lost our heritage because we just compromise now see we when we look at compromise compromise means to put one word out or add one word in that's all compromise is and what you do when you do that then that gives you the right to act the way you act but the compromise is to take something out of the word or add something in of your own choice he says and when we compromise then we cannot expect God to keep his promise to us because we have broken the sacred trust and defile the trust that God gave us he says let us keep that trust keep it sacred keep it holy keep every word of it and compromise nowhere take God at his word and believe it act like it stand on it don't move that's what we must do that's what God is looking for you'll see this service this sermon he preach is called the comforter and we're going to be quoting a lot from that as we go through the rest of this service amen the comforter and you'll notice how he's setting us up for the comforter as he's saying you've got to take him at his word no matter what take him at his word it struck me as I was studying that and just looking back at my own life even and the lives of others that we say we're a child of God and I believe we are but it seems like when the word is just getting good that's when we pull back and when I say getting good I mean when it's getting personal when it's getting real when the light is shining where light has never Shone before then what do we do we pull back why we compromise on the word why we don't believe it it hasn't struck us yet hey I said I looked at my life I'm not putting this on you I why because this flesh is not it's not redeemed this flesh doesn't want those things but it's the soul inside that starts to pull on that word by the grace of God that takes us into where we need to go but our nature is to pull back in those things cuz this flesh does not believe that's why we need to keep it under subjection to the spirit amen is to make us believe the word amen doubts and fears hold us back cuz we're not convinced that God will back it up and that the end result is not worth the difficulty of the battle that we're facing but when we pull back what do we do we step out of the light and once you step out of the light you can't grow you can't mature you can't you can't grow in Christ you can't do it that's a bad place to be if you're trying to grow mature is in darkness yo we've got uh plants all over our house but we've got some in our bathroom our master bathroom and and I noticed that as I've been going in in the mornings now that the shades are pulled down we've got a shade that can go down from the top or it can go up from the bottom and I noticed it's pulled down and and uh I I put it back up one day at the end of the day thank God and uh my wife said when did you put that up and I said well I put it when it got dark so people couldn't see into the house and she said good cuz the plants in there need light there's light from the ceiling but that's not the light they need they need sunshine and as soon as you take them out of the sunshine then what happens they start to deteriorate that's just the way it is they need the sunlight brother Brown puts it this way this is from the comforter most of these are you'll see if a man will shut himself from God's spiritual Sunshine there's something wrong with his spiritual condition when a man refuses to walk in the leading of a good god like our God who is our comfort and our strength he says and to live in his Sunshine is spiritual growth it's spiritual strength to live in his Sunshine The Shining of his glory why it's the greatest privilege that we have to live under the sunlight of God's glory he says look at the good healthy Christians he he says take the man or the woman that would put himself down into some Sellar and would not see the sunshine the natural Sunshine that God has provided for him what he refuses to believe it he says and because of selfishness he shuts himself off now for context there he's talking about a man or a woman that doesn't want to grow that don't want to change that don't want to be responsible for what they've heard and what they've seen and so they say I'm just not going to listen to it what out of selfishness because once you hear it once you know it god holds you accountable so what do they do they say I'm not just not going to go I'm not going to go to church I'm not going to go hear that Ministry I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that I'm going to pull back selfishness you want to stay where you are you don't want to grow he says that man will soon become anemic he'll become pale he won't have good strength he won't have health because that he shut himself off from the very privilege that God gave him he says that's right he did it willfully then if we shut ourselves off from the glory of God from the baptism of the Holy Ghost or The Fellowship of the spirit the first thing you know we become pale sickly Christians our experience is growing dim he doesn't say you're not a son of God he doesn't say you're not a Christian he says you start to fail in your Christianity and when the Great Trials come we shrink and go back it takes that soldier who has lived in the sunlight of God it takes that Spirit who knows God where there is not a wave of doubt they can stand in the midst of trouble and cry out my redeemer liveth he says hallelujah that's it see now catch this we shut ourselves off he doesn't say God turns it off he says we shut it off he says and they he's speaking of the world do it automatically why they're built that way they're built to reject God they're built to reject the light of the word he says we do it because we want to do it he's talking to Believers and he's saying the reason we don't live in the light is because we don't choose to live in the light we back away when hardship comes we back away when hard decisions come we back away when things don't go the way we want and he says you turn off the light because the light's always there you back away it ain't God that's pulled away it's you that pulled away but catch this this is so beautiful but God is good he provides it for us he says but too many today don't want to get into that healthy place with God a healthy Christian and have a healthy Spirit now catch this he says you certainly would rally for a healthy body anybody would hey we'll eat the craziest diets we'll do the craziest exercise programs we'll go through the craziest regimens to get a healthy body to get the muscles to get the slimness to get the health whatever it might be well do crazy things he says well that body no matter how much health you put in that body it's going back to the dust but oh my brother that Soul cannot get too healthy and every time it grows it grows in the strength and Grace and power of God he says we need to walk in the sunlight of God because he is good he'll withhold no good thing from his children and everything he has is for our good and when I was reading this it struck me about that rich young ruler that came to Jesus and I want you to realize that when he came to Jesus he had done everything he knew to do to receive eternal life he had followed the Commandments he had lived a clean life he had treated people properly and he was sincere in his belief and in his actions but yet in all of those things when a push came to shove there was a lingering doubt in his mind as to whether he was going to have eternal life when he passed from this life into the next he didn't know what was going to happen and there was something about Jesus that made him think that that man had the answer Church what was he looking for he was looking for Comfort he was looking for Assurance he was looking for confirmation he was looking for his soul to have comfort perhaps everyone around him was saying listen you live a good life you pay your ti you help pay for the church building you're always doing good things what are you worried about man you got this in the bag you're going to receive eternal life but there was something in his Soul his heart that wasn't settled amen and when he came up to Jesus and he said what must I do to receive eternal life and Jesus said live by the word he said live by the word he said do the Commandments and he started listing them and look what this young man says and he says the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up I've done that I've lived that kind of Life Jesus exactly what you're talking about I've done it since I was young enough to know what to do but then he said said these words what lack I yet he knew there was more to it he knew there was more to this walk and Jesus said unto him if thou wil be perfect see he says I'm lacking he knows he's lacking Jesus words there that word perfect means complete finished full grown mature lacking nothing so Jesus said if you want to lack nothing he says what lack I yet Jesus says if you want to be without lack he says go and sell that thou Hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me and when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions remember we said last service that the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen and that young man could do everything the word told him to do except trust it completely he couldn't trust it he could do it by law but he could not trust his very life amen he could perform the requirements of the law but when Jesus said give me your life he said I can't do it amen if Jesus had asked him go spend a bunch of money on the local Tabernacle give the money give some of your money to the poor give half he might have done it but Jesus said you got to give it all you got to give it all and you got to follow me and he walked away why the price was too high he wasn't convinced that that what he heard was true and so it had no comfort for him amen he just knew that hardship was going to be too much the word was getting personal now the word was Discerning what was in that young man's heart and that's when he backed away and that young man went away with the same issue that he came in with his heart was not settled but you know brother Braham said this he says you know that story of the rich man that built the Barns and then had to build bigger barns what did he say at the end Soul take thine knes brother Braham says it's this young man what happened after that his conscience was seared and he walked into judgment thinking that he had the greatest life ever and that night he died and he went to hell when it was all said and done he didn't have the comforter that he needed amen he never got his rest he never got that anchor in his soul but he got a searing of that thing and he thought that he had made it through we can look at people all down through history through the scriptures and particular that had the same opportunity as this young man and the choice is always one of two things do it or don't do it it's that simple it's yes or no I'll go with the word or I'll go my own way amen but when they accepted the word of God when they said I'll do it they had to go all the way they had to be fully committed there was no halfway you look at somebody like Abraham Abraham's halfway uh commitment to God never got him anywhere it never got him anywhere it was only when he went all the way that the promises started to come to pass and me you can't go halfway it was all or nothing so if there's one thing you grasp tonight it's that this comforter only comes to somebody who's all in it won't be halfway amen it can't be a halfway life a halfway Faith a halfway commitment a halfway sanctification it's all the way or no way you're better off not starting cuz you'll just be me even more miserable if you go half the way because you never get the promise and you can't go back to what you were either now that young man that Rich Young Ruler by his reasoning might have said you know I can do a lot of good with my wealth I can pay for church after church I can I can provide for the poor for the rest of my life instead of spend it all in one shot by Logic and reasoning he could come up with all sorts of reasons for why he shouldn't do it for things that were good for things that would benefit the local body and these things but remember the word is a discerner and Jesus saw something in that young man's heart that was going to be bound by that money Jesus didn't tell everyone to give up their money by no means you can go through the script ures and while while wealth was not the Hallmark of the believer you can find wealthy people job was the wealthiest man there Abraham was a man of great wealth Solomon was the the the the wealthiest of them all we believe but you'll find that their wealth did not control them remember Abraham Abraham left everything he had established to follow God job lost everything he had and he said the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord and Solomon didn't even ask asked for wealth he asked for wisdom and God said I'll give you everything else because you asked for the right thing it could not dominate him it didn't have a hold on him this man was held by his wealth and the word said you've got to lay it down listen the Holy Spirit can go through this church and one of you can hear one thing and it'll tell you to lay it down and it has no effect on the other you know why because you're bound by it and they're not that's why we don't do things because others do them and it's why we don't do things because others don't do them some people have weaknesses and some have strengths and some of us have to lay things down that others don't and that's the personal effect of the Holy Spirit coming into your life it's to save you from yourself that's what he's trying to do amen God's trust God's requirement is that we trust him absolutely and completely amen he knows where we're reliant on things and he comes in and he just Yanks that right out from under our feet pulls the rug out from under our feet time and time again to teach us your rest and your hope is in me I'm your comfort not your bank account not your health not your intellect not your job prospects whatever it might be he says your hope and your trust has to be in me that's why he's our comforter but I want to look at just a few people that had to stand this way as we start to close just a couple more pages he said Noah had a consolation that while he was making this Ark he knew that he was comforted because he had the word of the Lord that told him that's the instructions Church we're on a path to get out of here and we've got a message to take us there and we have to trust it absolutely and more and more people are start starting to not trust it because they're sick of waiting for it to do what it said it would do but the believer sticks with it no matter what he says what if somebody would have said say Noah what do you mean by building that out of gopherwood why you know that would if there would be water it would be the first thing to think see gopherwood was porous goer wood is not what you build a boat out of church if you're looking for a material it's not waterproof on its own but remember God had told him how to transform that into something that would stand the test am then by using pitch to coat it inside and out he says but you see Noah was following the instructions he had the word of God which was his comforter the word was his comfort I don't understand why God is making me build it like this but this is what he said to do you know I can imagine the experts were critiquing him you know those Engineers those trades people coming by and saying Noah if we're ever going to build a boat it's not going to be out of that material it's too long it's too narrow its slenderness ratio will not hold up to what you're talking about you know the world has said that today the world has said that the dimensions of the Ark would cause it to break break and then what they did is they got a supercomputer that could actually handle everything and they said it's an ingenious design and it's probably the only thing that would not break isn't that amazing see today we build things so strong that design was made flexible enough that it could handle all of this great tumult that was going on in the world and see they couldn't figure it out God knew what he was doing amen our decision ision are going to be challenged they're going to be criticized they're going to be critiqued people are going to say how in the world do you think that's going to work out and the only answer we have the word of God said so that's it that's all we have to stand on Amen Satan's job is to criticize to try and drive a wedge between us and the word he's been doing it since Eve came and that's all he's trying to do is get us in there to doubt what God has said and when we doubt what God has said then guess what what we don't get the benefit we don't get the Comfort we don't get the rest we don't get the peace we don't get the promise we've got to be able to trust it absolutely amen our faith in the word is going to be challenged by somebody else's knowledge logic and reason and our faith has to be able to stand up to those things why because it takes time for the fruit of a right decision to show listen Noah had 120 years of criticism 120 years of people telling him that ain't going to to work and guess what when the trial came who was proven right not Noah the word was the word was proven Noah was with it so he got the he got all the credit but he built it according to the word his life was in the hands of the word and he put everything he had into it to stay with it and when the time came when the trials and tribulation came like God had said there was his faith would stand because he'd placed it completely in the word of God God remember what Jesus said trials and tribulations are coming your peace is in me you got to be in me amen you'll be in me I'll be in you and it'll all work out but Braham said this he says Christ the chief captain of our Salvation there he stands the great conqueror he rent the veil in two and took down all the middle walls of partition and invited whosoever will to come and partake of his life to be cover with his Divine blessings that there will be no judgment strike you and if judgment strikes it can't hurt you you may be sick for a little while you may have to go through something for a little while but remember he says Christ is at the end he never said this Ark will sit in a little pool like that where it'll be just as calm as it can be no sir he never carried a flowery bed of ease he never promised things easy but he promised Grace to sustain you in the time amen we've been talking about the comfort and the time we need the comforter is times like this when times are tough we don't need the comforter when times are good we need it when times are weighing us down when decisions are difficult when it seems like everything is bearing down on us that's when we need the comforter when we're hurting when we're not sure of what's going on when we can't see so far ahead we've got to have that comforter to say it's okay I'll be with you even in you that's our rest that's our trust amen look at the Hebrew children he says the Hebrew children when they were walking to the fiery furnace to give their life they had made their stand but what happened to them they said our God is able amen right there they stood they stood on what what was their comfort in a few minutes they would be burnt to Pieces the furnace was heated seven times hotter than it ever was heated but they had Comfort we don't see them freaking out we don't see them quivering we don't see them fighting to be held back from those flames they walked willingly towards it he says why knowing this that our God is able to Deliver Us from that angry fire they their comfort was resting upon the ability of the god that they served he says that's my hope and stay I'm resting upon his ability remember what he says in me is your peace I'm resting upon his ability I'm rest in upon his grace not upon what I am what he is I'm resting upon his promise because he made the promise and he swore to the promise and I know that we have eternal life that's right the Hebrew children said he is able to deliver us nevertheless if he doesn't do it will'll never bow to your image church I'll tell you this they didn't get to that trial without having passed through some to prove the reality of God in their life remember he had spared their life multiple times he had given them favor in a place where they weren't supposed to have favor he had changed the entire process of how those young men were D dealt with how they were fed how they were housed how the king managed them it was all fitted to allow them to continue to serve God and he he made them wiser he made them smarter more intelligent more gifted than anyone else in the Kingdom why because they stayed with his word no matter what and so when the time came what happens as their faith grows the trials grow with it and when the trial comes of their actual life where he says it's bow or die they say that ain't even a choice that's what they said we don't have we don't have to stop and think about it oh King we know our answer we will not bow we will not do what you say We'll choose death they didn't have to stop and think about it their faith was such that they knew the realities of God that if they died they would go to a place that was better than where they were amen they knew that God was faithful isn't that our rest is that he's faithful that he doesn't forget his promises though he carries at times yet he never forgets his promise amen scripture says he'll never leave us or forsake us he'll be with us even to the End of the Age through good and bad through ups and downs and all of these things amen that's our comfort he said he'd always be there last section of quotes he said Moses knew when Moses had that responsibility of 2 million people when he led them out of Egypt how is he going to feed them 2 million people with the women packing a little bunch of needed Bread on top of their head for 40 years of Journey how is he going to feed them how many babies can be born each night in a group of people like that how many old and infirmed how many clothes will they wear out where will I get the clothes where will I feed them I've got to I've come to them as a leader how will I be able to do it as a pastor those thoughts come to me at times how can I do this I've got to be able to do it the way Moses did has nothing to do with me it's not my call it's not my people it's not my flock amen he's the great Shepherd he's the great provider he's Jehovah Gyra he says this Moses rested upon this because God said surely I'll be be with you that's his comfort surely I'll be with you that's all he needed Moses rested upon the comfort of God's promise I'll be with I'll surely be with you Moses so then it's not up to Moses to see how they're fed how you going to do it Lord Moses didn't ask that question now catch this as we start to close it's not my business to ask the questions it's not your business to ask the questions it's our business to believe him and Obey him and feel comfortable while we are resting upon his promise God said so that settles it someone said to me once brother bradam aren't you afraid when you go to the pulpit there and are called to a showdown aren't you afraid sometimes standing in that line there will be a mistake he says no sir I'm not afraid because I solemnly rest upon his word I'll be with you he says when he said to me that night no man shall stand before you all the day of your life he said I'll be with you and he has cut off every enemy catch this next line he says he has stood by me when I wasn't deserving to be stood by Hallelujah if he'll do it for a prophet he'll do it for any other child of God Amen when I don't deserve it yet he's faithful scripture says though we deny him he cannot deny us because he cannot deny himself when I I can't stand he stands anyways when I can't take it he props me up when I can't do it he does it for me and when I fail he picks up the pieces and he gets me going again but because that he promised it because of his grace I've rested solemnly upon that word right because he promised it he promised it he's able to keep what he has promised that's right he says don't you never forget the Comfort the stream of all my comfort the stream of my comfort tonight is I know that God keeps his word now I want you to notice something as we read this last portion because it's not that just God keeps his word for her or God keeps his word for him or that group listen I've got family that knows that God keeps his word but that hasn't done anything for them they know it but that hasn't done anything for them that's not enough it's not enough to know that God knows his word or God follows his word and and fulfills it brother B says this I know that something happened to me why the word has to be born in me the word has to be born in you it's not just enough to say God keeps his word you need to have a revelation that he's done it in you and he's done it in me I know I have passed from Death unto life I know that I keep his Commandments he said if you love me keep my Commandments he said if you love me do what I tell you to do let every man's word be a lie and let mine be true don't follow what man said follow what God Said and there you find the comforter and the Comfort brings you the satisfaction of knowing it's thus saith the Lord amen God bless you let's stand if we would amen amen isn't God good amen we've been promised trials and tribulations and I know we don't like it nobody likes it but we've been promised a comforter to take us through those trials and testings amen and for us they have a wonderful effect they make us Rapture Ready they make us Resurrection ready they make us ready to go to that marriage supper of the lamb and there he'll be the ultimate comforter scripture says he'll wipe the tears from our eyes there'll be no more pain there'll be no more sorrow there'll be no more death there'll be no more sickness Amen in this world we have trials and tribulations but we're going to a place that is perfect peace perfect rest and perfect Comfort amen amen God grant us to

word of God in a way that we haven't in this life Lord Jesus Lord and it takes you to do that in our lives Lord it takes your strength it takes your grace it takes your mercy takes your courage it

things look tough when things look dark they could go back and say he didn't start with us to leave us by the wayside amen if you're feeling a little down this evening if you're not sure of where
