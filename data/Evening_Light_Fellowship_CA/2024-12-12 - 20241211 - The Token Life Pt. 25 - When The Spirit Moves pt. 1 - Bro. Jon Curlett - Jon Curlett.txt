would encourage us and strengthen us this evening Lord for those that aren't here Lord I pray your grace to them each one in Jesus Christ's name we ask and pray amen then God bless you turn if you would to Genesis chapter 1 again Genesis 1 and one and good to be here again this evening Blanc and the boys got back just a couple hours ago so they're mostly sleeping I would imagine but uh we're thankful that they had a good trip and they came back safely I know brother Grant's got multiple exams this week so we want to remember him in prayer as well I I still remember those days even though it was 20 years ago 20 odd years ago amen it's never easy to go through exams in University and these things so we trust God will be with them and continue to bring him through amen Genesis chapter 1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening we're taking or continuing our series on the Holy Ghost but I want to start a another subtopic if you will on when the spirit moves and I'm sorry that I keep reusing so many script rures I feel like we've worn out John chap 1 already and now we're wearing out Genesis 1 but I believe that God's word just keeps opening up and it keeps opening up and you can read one portion it it means one thing and then you go focus on another portion it opens up another area and so I haven't been able to leave this and so until I can I'll I'll stay here amen but the word of God is Rich amen the word of God is Rich and so I believe we can keep coming to those things amen but you know I as I was studying in in Genesis 1 it always struck me how that this thought of how God moves into position when God gets ready to move it was in chaos it was in disorder it was in darkness it was when nothing was happening or moving and that's usually when God starts to move is when things look a little rough you know we can see that in the scripture so many times that God will let things get down to the very last moment to the very last day to the very last minute to the very last person and then he moves you I was talking with brother Ron Spencer this week and and he went on a 10-day hunting trip and he got his deer in the last 30 minutes of the last day that's kind of the way God tends to work in my case he didn't give me anything maybe he'll give me something later but isn't that just the way God moves God likes to wait until it looks like nothing can go the way he said it looks like nothing's lined up it looks like nothing's moving nothing's shaping nothing's molding nothing's changing and it's been that way for far too to Long everything is grafted it's grounded it's tied down nothing's going to change and then God steps on the scene and what happens is things change and and you know what he's doing amen God has this principle that he waits until it's obvious that there's nothing we can do and then he says now I'm here and so we can see that it's God that's doing the work not us that's doing the work amen and if we look at you know we would call that perhaps the trial of our faith but in the original in the origin of creation there was nobody to have faith there was no not nothing there was no person there was just stuff and so there was nothing to have faith and so whatever came out of that had to be the faith of God it had to be the work of God because they couldn't do anything for themselves and so God literally created the Earth for human life and if you look at verse two it doesn't even look remotely what God intended it to be it says God created the Heaven and the Earth and his intentions were for that Earth to produce life life to sustain life so that Humanity could be there and enjoy it but what God created is not reflected in what's there when you look at the Earth and you look at the heavens it does not look like what God intends it to be God's created way of bringing it into being in no way is what he intends it to be when he's finished with it that's not the way that God works amen and so it comes into existence and it's not in its final shape or condition God created it out of order in darkness and in chaos and without life why so that he could have a reason and purpose of being did you know that because God's not just a Creator but he's there to produce something he's there to to change it into something of his own thinking and of his own making and what was it that changed it it was the moving of the spirit on the face of the waters now we know that Waters always represents people so when you see this don't just think about the Earth but think about the way he works with us but what happens is that spirit of God moved on and it changed the atmosphere and then after that the word of God came forth we can see amen it came forth as a thought then it was spoken and it became the spoken word and then from there it became the reality of the word in creation amen but I I I touched on this last service and I want to reemphasize this I was joking a bit with the deacons did you did you catch last service that God is all about processes everything's a process and that's what I'm trying to really anchor down is that God does not look at time and God does not look at situations the way that we do we get in a hurry God's not in a hurry God's Got A Plan God's got a word he thinks it he speaks it and then he sits back and the Holy Spirit makes it happen God goes to work the power of God is behind his word but it's a process of time almost always now the actual event that we're looking for may happen in a split second but it takes a time and God allows it to be a time of waiting and a time of faith and these different things so that we grow and mature as we're going through this life amen but God had a work to do and that was part of his purpose and part of the reason for being in that beginning and now we'd think perhaps if we were God and we had all power and authority now this is just me maybe you'd be different but if we saw that Earth in its chaotic dark condition we wouldn't sit there and do a work of a thousand years we'd do a magical work of an immediate landscape plan that just went and Bam the Earth would be exactly the way we want we wanted it and the fiords would be there in Norway and we'd have the rugged coastline we'd have the beautiful Plains and everything and we just say we boom we'd speak it into existence that way we want it to happen immediately but God doesn't work that way amen maybe we we we go and we just snap our fingers and the animals would all come into existence but that's not the way that God said that he did it amen watch how God does it because God does it in a very particular process as the spirit of God moves it starts to show the process of how God works with us and with his people and we'll see that it happens all time and time time again through the Bible and so it ought to be the way that he's working in our day and I believe we can see that but the first thing that happens is the spirit of God moves and it moves over the waters that covered the Earth and then Watch What Happens it says God said let there be light so the spirit moves and then after the spirit moves the spoken word comes forth amen that's what happens now there's no declaration here when he says let there be light that light just went poof and came in into existence in fact quite the contrary there's a full hole in there that means there's a period there's a pause there's a time that's there where nothing happened or where things were happening but the effect wasn't completed immediately amen it says and then there was light so God says it we have a period of time and then there was light and I talked about this last service how when that light came into being and everything was dark in the universe there was no light and there was nothing and yet out of that there came just this one little spark and when that one spark came out Darkness lost the victory it only took a little spark to defeat Darkness it only took a a little spark to erase Darkness at least in that little bit but it started to whirl and it started to collect and it became the fullness of God it became the pillar of fire The Dwelling Place of God but it started with just that little tiny spark now the prop of God talks about this and I I want to just read this this evening he says now notice now he's look talking about in the beginning there's nothing there's just space there's no light there's no dark there's no nothing it just seems nothing but in there is a great supernatural being Jehovah God who covered all of space of all places at all times he was from Everlasting from Everlasting he's the beginning of creation that's God but he says you can't he see nothing you can hear nothing there's not a move of an atom in the air not nothing not no air no nothing but yet God was there he says that was God no man had seen that now that's father that's the father that's God the father but he says then after a while I begin to see a little sacred light begin to form there's a waiting and then there's a process of forming he says like a little Halo or something but you could only see it by spiritual eyes but look now while we're looking the whole church now we're standing on a great big banister watching what God's doing now no one has seen God and now the next thing we begin to see by eyes of Supernatural looking that's what matters Supernatural IE not naturalize Supernatural IE this is not the light that caused everything to come to life by sunlight this is the supernatural light of God you got to see it through a different set of eyes he see a we he says we see a little white light forming out there what is that he says that's called by Bible readers the logos or the anointed or the anointing the part of God begin to develop catch this phrase begin to develop it's just starting it's like a baby if you want to call that it's starting to form he says into something so human beings could have some type of an idea what it was it was a little light moving that was the word of God so a light begins to form it doesn't just bam and all of a sudden there's a pillar of fire is there that's not the way he says it happened it doesn't Thunder its way into reality it just after a period of time starts to happen and it happens as a process one minute there's nothing then the next minute there's a little bit of something but it's not the full thing yet and it just continues to slowly build and build and build into this Halo into this Pillar of Fire forming it self up the way that God had intended in his mind just one spark at a time one element of a time one piece at a time forming up into the picture that God saw then brother Bram says this he says God said over this dark and gloomy dismal Mossy world that stood here without light he said let there be light he said and it wasn't light until that word was manifested then it was light now in other words God said let there be light and maybe again we don't know maybe a lot of other things happened maybe there was this Supernatural wind that started to blow maybe there was great surges of electricity that that started to flow maybe there were loud booms but that wasn't light we might have thought that's light because light to this point hadn't existed if we were there in our humanity and we'd hear and see those things moving or or feel something we might say well that must be what he's talking about cuz there's an effect that's going dumb but that's not light what's light is when there is light and only God knows what light is because he's the one that had it in his mind and then he spoke it so when light comes he's the only one that can declare this is light he's the only one that gets to do that if I told you this evening to build me a multiphase bifurcated induction loop with a harmonic balancer for dynamic thermal load control you wouldn't know what that means to be fair I don't because I made it up that's why I had to read it off but I have something in my mind and even brother Matt with all his skill I could say brother Matt go build me that thing in your machine shelf and brother Matt would take everything he knows about all of those words I just put together and he might come out and then he would lay something on here and he'd say brother John there you go there it is but guess what he doesn't get to say that that's a multi face B for yeah whatever I said I get to say it because it's in my mind not in his mind I'm the one that defines what that thing is amen he might present me with his interpretation but that's not the truth I am the only one that knows what it is so when God said God's the same way God's like me no that's not what I'm saying but that's the way God is amen God saw in his mind what light was and what his interpret interpretation of what light is and he declared when light came actual light came he says there it is that's light and from that moment on that's what defin light we don't get to sit here and say no that's light or that's light or that's light God determined what's light and we have it today though we have this problem where people are determining who God is what God is what Christianity is what the word is what the word says and brother Bron would say God interprets his word how by bringing it to pass so that's the interpretation the interpretation is not what I think by all of my study and all of my prayer the interpretation is what God vindicates by bringing it to pass so when he said there was light that was God saying there's it that's exactly what I was talking about the scripture says that God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness so God puts his creation into work now and it's to separate light from darkness and God called the day the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day one day done and all God's done all God's done has created a supernatural body for himself to live in brother Braham says it might have taken a thousand years he says might have taken 800 years for that first Spark to come in remember the scripture says a day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day we don't know the actual span of time for this amen we don't know when that little light started to form but when it Formed it was formed perfectly and it was exactly as God has intended that's the way it happened amen but it's all a progression of God's plan amen God said that's good and then he got ready for day two and it was a progression of his plan he's just going one step at a time he's got a picture in his mind he's speaking it to produce the reality and then the brooding of the Holy Spirit now brings the reality of the word into the spoken word amen everything he does is with purpose it's according to a plan God doesn't just talk we've talked about this before God doesn't chitchat God God speaks with care and with wi wi with specific intent because everything he says is the word and it's got power behind it so whatever he says is going to happen brother Brown would say this he's talking about the the Reason God does things he says the spirit of God moved upon that water and said let there be lights God had a reason to do that for he's talking about lights now not the light the supernatural light now he's talking the sun moon and stars God had a reason to do that why because down beneath that water there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live see God's not just making light for the sake of light God's making light because there's a need for the light for the rest of creation he says the first light that was ever given in the Earth was God's spoken word he says the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light and that turned Darkness into light in order to bring forth the creation of joy and life upon the Earth God's word is given and the spirit follows to bring creative power he says then the spirit of God as it moved with love and compassion he says at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun Rose and swept AC cross its rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for the first time it was to bring joy and life to the Earth by a seed he says that was a great hour now this concept of seeds is critical to understand the word of God and brother Brandon preaches on this so many times amen he say he talk about the spoken word is the Original Seed and things like that but when you understand why a seed is critical to thinking it's because the seed is something that has potential that's all a seed is it's something that has potential when you have a seed you have nothing and yet you have everything when you have a seed amen You' take a little sunflower seed and there's a bunch of them in a person's hand maybe 10 or 12 sunflower seeds there and they're little tiny things little striped things but the potential for that seed is huge anybody here ever been to a sunflower plant farm no they had them in BC we've seen them when you look at what that sunflower can be it's huge they could be 12 14t tall and it starts with just that little tiny seed in your hand the seed is all about the potential amen but if you know what you have Hallelujah if you know what you have in your hands then you know that's all that's required for that potential to come out is for it to be placed in the right conditions that's all you know but if you can know what that is and you know what those conditions are you can have joy with the seed before the plant ever comes forward because you know that you know what the conditions are going to be and therefore you know the seed that you have will come to life amen there you can have great expectation you can have great joy you can have anticipation you can talk it up you can tell the kids wait till you see what this is going to be this is going to be as tall as our house and they say Ain't No Way mama ain't no way Daddy no believe me this is just a tiny sea but wait till you see what happens when it fully matures when it's put in the right conditions bam says this he says when God speaks anything he means it then there'll be so many things and such things and it was God said let there be light and light sprang from somewhere from the Creator God said let there be this and it was this let there be that and it was that he says what God Said is seeds and he says God's in his word now natural seeds have potential but it's a maybe or it's a maybe not I don't know if you've ever bought seeds from Dollarama they're definitely maybe or maybe not we planted a bunch of them but only some of them came out there's no guarantee they might have given you bad seeds but he saying God's seeds are different the word of God is different because they're not just potential they're certain they will come to life they will produce what God has said they'll produce the words can never fail they're yay and amen amen he's saying that God's in his word God's words are seeds that means those seeds cannot fail and we see what happens as we go through creation that there's this progression and on the second day he rolls back the waters and he creates an atmosphere to protect the Earth and that's so that when the sun rays come in then the heat can stay inside and the oxygen is there and it makes it stable and life sustaining without an atmosphere this world would be incredibly unstable but that atmosphere that's there now helps to lock in what's needed here and everything is in stages properly to sustain life God as he does one part it's for the next part and as he does the next part it's for the next part and he's doing it all because once God does something he doesn't tend to kill it or undo it it's there to produce a particular effect amen and as he creates things the moving of the Spirit by the word of God brings each stage managed Le to or it stag perfectly to its intended place and position and then God can move forward day after day after day what is it it's the spirit of God moving by his word that's what he's doing to produce the thought to produce the reality to produce the image that's in God's mind that's the purpose of the holy spirit it's the power it's the enforcer it's the creation of God that's what it's there to do it's to produce what the word says you ought to know why you have the Holy GH this evening is to produce what the word says yeah there's lots of benefits there's lots of gifts there's lots of U moves there's lots of emotion and all those things but the purpose of the holy spirit is to change things it's to mold things it's to grow things it's to mature things it's to shape things to bring them into what God has declared it takes the picture from God's mind and it produces it down here that's what the Holy Spirit does so when you have the Holy Spirit what's it trying to do trying to get you to catch the thought and the image of God by his word so that it can produce it in your life that's what he's supposed to be doing he's supposed to be bringing the reality of the word now the scripture says the spirit of God moved on the face of the waters and we talked about that word move a couple Services ago and it means to relax to brood to grow soft and to hover and that word move has the same meaning as that word overshadow of when the Holy Spirit overshadow Mary to produce Jesus Christ in her womb now when the Holy Spirit overshadow Mary what did it produce did it produce a man did it produce a a 9-month-old baby said it could be born immediately no what did it produce It produced a word seed and It produced a fertilized egg and it took it and it placed it inside of Mary but notice when it did it the scripture says when the fullness of time in other words when God decided Now's the Time that's when it happened and until the fullness of time the Holy Spirit did not move there were lots of virgins around there was lots of Israelites around there was lots of good girls around but the Holy Spirit wasn't brooding because the word was not ready to go yet but as soon as God said it's time to go he sends forth his Spirit now and what does it do it goes and it starts brooding over the Earth and it finds a ground for that seed to be placed in amen and it doesn't create it like I said as a full grown man rather it it goes and does exactly what the word said what did the word say a virgin shall conceive so what does the Holy Spirit go and do it goes and looks for a virgin so there has to be a virgin there right the God says it's time the holy spirit says okay it starts to brood over the Earth because it's looking to produce the word of God in human flesh and so it goes looking for human flesh that's ready for the word to be produced in it now I want you to notice something cuz Mary is everything the word said she would be what did the word say she would be it would be a she it would be a virgin and it would be a woman of Israel okay that was a requirement so everything the word declared of Mary was in Mary she had never been intimate with a man she was not yet fully married amen and so she has the potential by her characteristics to produce the word everything the word needs is in Mary except that seed amen but until the spirit of God God moves on her she cannot produce a messiah she is no less qualified the day before as it was the day of and she's no more qualified the day after it happened than the day that it happened she was the same all the way through the potential was there but it took the moving of the spirit for her to be the Virgin that shall conceive everything was in her amen her attitude was right she was exactly what the word required her attitude was right her spirit was right her body was right her life was right her Doctrine was right everything about her was perfect to produce the word but no matter her sincerity no matter how much she read the Torah no matter how much she went to church no matter how hard she prayed she could not produce the Messiah until the spirit moved are you catching the message this evening everything can be in place but it takes the moving of the spirit of God to produce the word amen but all she was doing yes she read the Torah yes she went to the synagogue yes she kept her life clean but what was that doing it was getting her in a condition and then maintaining her in a condition to receive the word when the spirit of God moved that's what was happening amen and when the spirit of God moved in her It produced the word in her flesh she had made herself ready but that was just preparing for it amen that wasn't the Dynamics that's not the Dynamics amen this is not the Dynamics necessarily we're setting things in order we're getting ready when we read our Bible when we pray when we go to church when we're under the hearing of the word yes the Holy Spirit can be moving but the Dynamics is the life of it not the letter of it amen so all that she was doing was getting herself in a place where she could receive what the word had for her amen that's what we're trying to do we're trying to get ourselves in position so that when God moves in our midst we can believe it we can receive it we can accept it we can act on it we can let it change us because it's trying to produce the word in our life amen we can look at the creation story and it's a wonderful thing but in the end of it God wanted a man to be a part of it remember Adam was in spirit form he was outside of it but God after that seventh day came down and he created a body for that man so could have a part in the reality of creation and then God said go down there take Dominion take control you're made in my image you're meant to rule this Earth and he made man a God on this Earth but man fell from that and if there's one thing we can see today after 6,000 years it's the depravity of men we have completely Fallen mankind has fallen completely from those things and we have so many dreams and hopes and good intentions and all of these things but no matter how much we're thinking we're getting ahead we're always shooting ourselves in the foot that's just the way it seems to work amen listen you want to look at at Good Intentions look at Israel Israel is the epitome of Good Intentions in sinful flesh good intentions don't get us anywhere Church why cuz it's mechanics it's not Dynamics amen you want to see the realities of human nature look at Israel they were a chosen people a chosen lineage came from a man chosen by God grew through the families God said that you are you have been chosen to serve me I've picked you I love you I'll protect you I'll give you a land where you can worship me I'll give you Victory I'll give you healing I'll keep all of these things that everyone else suffers with away from your door if you'll just stay with me and you know what they did everything but what God told them to do with all of the Good Intentions they just went to hell in a hand basket because what they started looking around at what what everybody else had they started looking at other religion other gods other political systems other entertainments other ways of worship they went looking for something that was more fun that was more sensual was more pleasing to their mind more pleasing to their body and all it did was it took them completely out of the will and the word of God and they lost every single blessing that they had you know it was amazing I was listening I don't know why I do this I've been listening to some of these cessationist preachers and they said it's clear as you look through history that the Holy Spirit backed away from the church and what they do is they say that's because God didn't want it to continue can you believe that that's like going and looking at Israel and saying they lost the blessings because God didn't want them to continue God gives all the blessings on the day of Pentecost he gives his very life to the church his power his authority his leadership and they say God didn't want that because all they're looking at is the signs and wonders and they forget how those signs and wonders came it was by the leadership of the holy spirit in the local congregation and so they look and they say it's clear by history that God pulled away but they say that's the will of God rather than looking in the word and saying what does the word say happened because you can go in Revelation 2 and it says they left their first love that wolves have come in in sheep's clothing that they have put the Holy Spirit out of the church and because they put him out he could do no Works in their midst but that doesn't mean he didn't have a work and it doesn't mean signs and wonders weren't there it was just in such small portion that they can't see it but God always had a witness God always had somebody full of the Holy Ghost but they can go and they can see in Revelation 2 and Revelation three why God pulled back from the church and why those signs and wonders weren't there why cuz they booted him out and so today they sit there and they say absolutely it is not there anymore why because Christ is completely outside of the church knocking trying to get back in but all they can say is that's the will of God rather than saying how did we lose what God gave freely they can't see it but they could look at Israel and they can say well Israel they lost it because they walked away from the word but they come to their lives and their denominations and they say no no we haven't walked away from the word therefore it's God's choosing to pull away his Spirit from us what nonsense what nonsense amen they had forgotten how good they had it can you imagine they came into the land of Canaan and they say it took about 10 seven or 10 years to wipe out the whole thing and then there was peace in the land and all they had to do was keep doing what they were doing that's all God said keep doing what you're doing follow my word and you'll you'll have the land forever and they just wouldn't do it and we can look in the Book of Ezekiel and we can see God showing his Prophet the condition of the people through his eyes I was studying this I thought you know it's good for us to see things through God's eyes sometimes sometimes we need to lift our eyes a little higher Amen to see the big picture sometimes we need to be humbled sometimes we need to be humbled we need to step back and say okay I'm going to be me and I'm going to let God be God because we're so dialed into things that we think we're going to make it happen but we need to step back and see it the way that God does humility gets us a lot further with God than our big visions and ideas that's for sure but in Ezekiel 37 remember Ezekiel 36 is where he saysi give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and I'll place my spirit within you he gives those that that wonderful promise and then look at what he shows the prophet Ezekiel he shows him the true condition of the people and it says the hand of the Lord was upon me this is Ezekiel the prophet and it carried me out in the spirit of the Lord so the spirit of the Lord moves on the Prophet The Prophet doesn't move himself he can't make this happen but it takes the spirit moving for this to happen he says and he set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry very many very dry and he tells Ezekiel go walk in them so we get this this wonderful picture of Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones now if we're looking at that picture Church where's the Hope where's the life there's none we're not talking about people that are starving people that are thirsty people that are weak we're talking about people that are not just dead they've dead they've been completely decayed and their bones are scattered they're all mixed up they're all jumbled up there's no Discerning what bones belong to which person anymore they're dead and there's a lot of them there's very many of them and they're very dry they've been in that condition for a really long time no hope amen and yet these people have a promise of God being their God of being his chosen elect people with a land where he would show them that he was their God and look at their condition do you see a disconnect no hope these aren't people that are sleeping these aren't people that are sick these aren't people that are dying these are people that are dead and they've been dead for a a long time no hope amen they're in a completely lifeless hopeless condition and they're the opposite condition of what God told them they should be they're also the opposite of what God said they would be now Watch What Happens watch how this unfolds cuz what hope do they have church none there is no hope in their condition they're lost and it seems there's no coming back but God said unto him son of man can these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest that's the right answer God you know I can't tell you Church how many things I've prayed about and I'm praying about and I know for a fact that I don't have the facts I don't know the root of the issues I don't know what's going on in people's lives and in the end I have to just back away and say God you're the one that knows cuz I'm not looking to change the situation I'm looking to find the will of God because when I can find the will of God I can have peace and rest no matter which way it goes amen I'm not here to try and change the mind of God I'm trying to catch the mind of God and sometimes that starts with me saying I don't have a clue I have I can I can honestly say I've prayed at times I've said Lord here's what I see here's what I think but I have no clue if this is right so I said Lord would you show me what's going on show me what you want me to do show me how this is supposed to play out and guess what he works he works when I say I don't know I think I do I think I might but I don't really know but now Ezekiel he's smart enough here he says listen God I have no clue you know again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord Church they don't have any ears they don't have ears they don't have a brain to receive it I don't care how great that Bell tones heing AIDS are it won't work on Bones but yet he says bones hear it anyways why cuz God's looking at this a different way than we do he's not relying on their ears he's relying on something Supernatural to happen when he speaks amen but watch what happens when the spirit of God moves what does it do it brings the word of the Lord somebody can come in and they'll say the God is has given me a gift that God has told me to do something let me tell you this when God sends a person he sends them with his word he always sends a message he doesn't send Just A Sign he sends a message with the sign amen we know that's the way go that God works amen but it's there to make the word a reality amen it's bringing the word of God in power now there are benefits and gifts that come with this but that is not life that is not life amen if all we want from the holy spirit is signs and wonders and dancing and tongues and emotion we're missing out on the main event because what he's come to do is bring life abundantly right not just noise not just benefits not just gifts amen Paul said signs or tongues will end he said prophecy will end he said gifts will fail he says but there's only one thing that won't fail and that's the word of God that's what the spirit of God always comes with is the word of God because it's the only thing that can't fail and he says thus sayeth the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live who are we going to believe tonight church if we look at this picture that's what our eyes are going to tell us when our kids leave the church when our spouse is struggling when our health is failing when our finances are rough when our job isn't working out we can look and we can see dry bones but that's not what God's looking at we got to see it through his eyes we've got to see it through the seed potential of the word of God not through what we see visually amen he says I I will come cause breath to enter to you and you shall live how is God going to do this he says I'm going to make you live I'm going to put my breath but watch what he says I'm going to do it through a process I'm not going to just snap my fingers and it's going to happen I'm going to do this in stages see the problem we have so many times is we know what's coming at the end but we wanted at the beginning that's not the way God works amen God works to build to edify to mature to establish and that's to make sure that when we get to the end and the life is there we've got the character that's required to use that character or to use that power we cannot jump to the front of the line that's why a pastor can't be a novice that's why we don't put people into positions of authority with no experience they're trying to do it today with all these initiatives at work in that and all it does is destroys a group it destroys a company it destroys an organization cuz you got to be proven before you can get there God's trying to do a work amen God wants us to get to the end and have a sure foundation with a proven character and a faith that trusts his word that's what he's trying to do amen otherwise you can walk in with a natural desire for the things of God Cain had a natural desire for the things of God and guess where he got nowhere it takes a work of faith that takes God to come into our lives amen and watch this process he says yes I'm going to put breath in you but I will lay Senus upon you and will bring flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and you shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord why because when we started out we couldn't do anything and in the end we're a living breathing epitome of the word of God and we know it's his work not mine cuz when he started I didn't have life I didn't have breath I didn't have skin I didn't have flesh I didn't have muscles I didn't have organs I was nothing when he started with me and now I'm something I'm alive why it's his work I know that he's the Lord Ezekiel says so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone church that's a miracle that's a miracle when the bones come to his bones not just to the right one but to the right place this whole valley of Bones is being put into order now what's the skeleton of a Believer it's always Doctrine amen Doctrine is the foundation it's the structure of a Believer amen that's what keeps us in line it's the truth and letter form but remember the skeleton is not life nor is it a body it's just something that keeps everything together Doctrine doesn't make us a Christian doesn't make us a Christian but it sets us in order it puts us in line with the word of God Amen now notice the moving of the spirit is not life notice when the spirit moves here there is a noise and a shaking lots of things are happening when the spirit moves but that's not life I was just listening this this uh this morning to brother bradam on on the Mighty God unveiled and he's telling that story about that Lutheran Minister maybe it wasn't in that it might have been something else I was studying either way and that Lutheran Minister comes to him and he's pointing at the Pentecostals and and they're hooping and they're hollering and they're dancing they're running up and down the aisles and that and he says brother Bram do you believe that's the real Holy Ghost and brother Bram said yes he said cuz when the bones come together there's a noise and there's a shaking he says that doesn't mean that all of it is but there's always a noise when he moves don't throw out the noise don't get cold and starchy and formal amen we ought to rejoice when the spirit of God moves but that is not life it's just evidence of his presence potentially potentially amen so we have this wonderful thing and what happens is the church is coming into order the word is being restored but they're just skeletons it's a it's in a way better condition than it was but it's not alive yet it says and when I beheld lo the Senus and flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above so now these skeletons have become bodies they've got Senus they've got muscles they've got skin they've got organs now these things look like bodies they look like real people they've been restored to their original condition they've got hair and skin and all of these things everything's in order everything's in place these are men and women and children and there's potential there for life but they are not yet alive and yet the spirit is moving this is absolutely a work of a spirit amen there's set and they're ready to be quickened to life it's a sanctification process we could say they're ready to go but being set in order is not life it just means you're ready for life it says then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayeth the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may left that they may live now watch how the word is coming now does Ezekiel have anything here of his own when life comes it has nothing to do with Ezekiel his thoughts aren't present his opinions aren't present all that he is is a microphone for what the spirit of God is saying he repeats it exactly as he is told to do it amen he is fully surrendered to what God tells him the spirit's moving and he's repeating it and notice even as these things start happening he knows what's going to happen but he never jumps ahead of the spirit he stays right in line with it time and time again there's three phases amen there's three poles and he never gets ahead he stays with the spirit every single time amen he staying with God's timing he's not trying to get ahead even though he knows what has to happen he doesn't get ahead it says so I prophesied as he commanded me he says and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up up upon their feet an exceeding great Army then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say these are our words Church our bones are dried and our hope is lost and we are caught cut off for our parts isn't that our testimony sometimes when we look at the situation and we say it's hopeless it ain't happened yet it's not going to happen nothing's changing in fact I'm getting more dry my bones are getting more scattered it seems like nothing's happening that was their testimony but that was not God's word he said therefore prophesy and say unto them thus sayeth the Lord remember there's what we say and there was what he says Church what holds the power here the power is not in what I think about myself the power is not in my condition the power is not in my failures and faults the power is in thus saith the Lord he says thus sayith the Lord God behold oh my people oh my people and they're scattered they're dead their bones are spread all over the place there's no life in them he says they're still my people they were his people when they were in their fallen condition and they're his people when they're in their living condition they were his people all along he says oh my people I will open your Graves and cause you to come out of your Graves and bring you into the land of Israel and ye shall know that I am the Lord when I have opened your Graves oh my people and brought you up out of your Graves and I shall and shall put my spirit in you and you shall live and I shall place you in your own land then ye shall know that the Lord have I the Lord have spoken it and performed it sayeth the Lord now we look at that story and we say that's for Israel and it is for Israel amen but we also know it hasn't happened yet this has not been fulfilled in isra and then we know that on the day of Pentecost a select few of the Israelites of the Jews got the promise of this because the promise of this is really the Holy Ghost that's the spirit of God Amen that's what it was intended for but they have not had that mass acceptance they do not have a great Army yet that's going to happen in the tribulation that's going to happen in the Millennium that's when they're going to have this this grand time they don't have it yet we're the ones that have this because remember we are Abraham's seed by faith and so the thing is what they are to receive we are to receive but if that means that we also must be in the condition they are in in order to receive the promise that there's to receive because we have to start out the same way that they did amen if we are going to receive the same promise we must be in the same condition if they need this to happen then we need this to happen if I can put it that way amen we might not need it now but we needed it at some point amen they were dead dried out scattered lost completely unable to change their situation and guess what we are the exactly the same way Paul would say in Ephesians 2 he says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sin now we got to get past this idea of life means having breath that is not what this means it doesn't say who are who are who are not breathing because of trespasses and sins amen you can be alive and dead at the same time listen before the New Birth we are alive but we're dead and after the New Birth we're dead but alive you can unpack that later when you have some time right now if we're unsaved then we are alive but dead and then after the New Birth we're dead but we're alive amen but what's Paul saying here he's saying every single one of us are born under conditions that are not conducive to life not a single one of us not a single one of us amen doesn't matter how religious amen we are it doesn't make a difference this is our without form and void condition just like the world was there's nothing there that's alive amen it was like the Earth in the beginning everything that needs to be there is there but there's no life yet the conditions aren't right he says wherein in time pass ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience I remember as a young man before I gave my heart to the Lord I was sneaking at things and I was listening to things and I was watching things I shouldn't hey I was a good little Christian boy but I was still a child of Disobedience Church and don't believe me I understand with my children and you ought to understand with yours until they receive the Holy Ghost they're here so don't fool yourself into thinking your kids are good kids they are under a spirit of Disobedience to the word of God I know that by experience it takes the Holy Ghost to change that amen he says among whom also we all that means there's no exceptions no it doesn't matter how religious we are it doesn't matter how Holy Ghost filled our parents are we all had our conversation we all had our way of life in Times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the Mind notice there's a twin there the Flesh and the mind amen the desires of this flesh our body craves certain things you get a taste of sugar you get a taste of chocolate sometime guess what it wants it I love my Donuts I love my chips I love my cookies I love my cake I love my icing why I got one taste of it and I love it that's just the way the body works but he says you got to watch out for your mind because your mind works the same way you get a taste of something your mind likes and what does it do you dwell on it and you dwell on it until you get this body to produce it for you don't ever forget we've got to protect this as much as we've got to protect what goes in here amen our mind is the battlefield it's where the greatest battle ever fought is he says and we were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us remember brother Bram said he moved with love and compassion on the world when the spirit of God moved he says for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins that's our value of dry bones experience dead in sins no hope he has quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved how was Christ quickened that body laid in the ground for three days how was it quickened the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit dropped back down into that body and it raised it up again that's the same thing that he does to us he does it by the holy spirit amen he says and he has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Israel gets a physical land what do we get we get an A Spiritual inheritance we're with Christ today that's where we are we're the fullness of the open word is that's it today later on we get a new Heaven and a new Earth and we will get a physical land as well amen but we are HS of him according to eternal life to rule and reign with him that's our promise we're coair with Christ but watch this verse 7 it says that in the ages to come uhoh time process patience faith not going to happen overnight there's a process of this church being built up there's a timeline for a bride to be prepared he says that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of any works not of Works rather lest any man should boast remember that valley of dry bones had no Works in their restoration to life it was completely a work of God the Amplified says here for this verse it says it is not the result of what anyone can possibly do so no one can Pride him himself in it or take glory to himself in other words it's a work of God from start to finish it's his plan it's his word it's his life it's his breath it's his power it's his choosing it's his timeline it's all him from start to finish amen he says for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them what's it going to take it's going to take what it did to Christ it's going to take a moving of the spirit amen it's going to take the holy spirit in your life it's going to take the holy spirit in my life not in a moving in the church there's lots of movings in the church that's not what's going to do it it's got to be in our inividual lives it's does it does us no good if you're ready and I'm not or and does you no good if I'm ready and you're not and it does us no good if we can live the life in here but we can't live the life out there amen it's got to be something that's in us when we leave the church not just something that's with us when we're in the church absolutely amen Bram says this and we're starting to close he says now when he said let there be light there may have been hundreds of years maybe 800 years before there ever was a light but it came to pass because God said so remember he says God's words are seeds and God is going to have a church I don't care how many Dark Ages we go through and whatever more he's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle whether we are part of it or not because he has already said it was going to happen it's going to be there hallelujah what a place we're sitting in this evening he has declared it the seed has been sown the spirit is brooding and when he comes to the fullness of time he'll make it happen it's happening all along but it'll happen and we'll see the full evidence of it amen we read that scripture I think last service of the service before in Zechariah 14:7 where it promised a day that was gloomy it was dark it was neither day nor night it was gray but he said in the evening time it shall be light what is light it's always the word of God with the presence of God to go with it that's what it is amen so how is God going to do this great work how is God going to take a people that are dead that are lost that are bound and bring them into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he's going to do it the same way he did it with Christ's own body by the spirit amen he's going to do it by his word and then the spirit goes to produce what the word says I was just watching a bit of a certain brother's sermon this last week or two ago I'm not sure when it was and his title was only God can move a mountain you know there's there's this pressure that can come because we believe in the spoken word we believe in Bride Authority and these different things but he was reminding only God can move the mountain we can do the speaking but we can't do the doing Ezekiel spoke but Ezekiel did not make the life go into the bones he didn't bring them together but he spoke the word and what happened is the spirit moved and it caused that to happen and he was reminding the greatest Mountain we have is our own sin that's the greatest Mountain God has to move we have mountains in our life we have mountains in our jobs mountains in our families and these things but it's going to take God to move the mountain because I can't do it and you can't do it physically we can't do it we have no power to do it and we know so much today we know so much today I believe we know the beginning to the end by the word of God we've had a Prophet come he's comeing he's opened the word he show us a message for our day amen by the grace of God and that in itself was a working of the holy spirit that was a moving of the Holy Spirit to bring the word to us but what happens after the word is given the spirit moves to make it a reality and that's what's going on now God is called out a bride and now he's preparing a bride that's without spot or wrinkle can you make it happen can I make it happen brother M can you make it happen this evening no I can't make it happen I can preach to on blue in the face listen church I will preach the power of God from this Pulpit I will preach every bit of the word of God I will preach on signs and wonders I will preach on healing I will preach on the greatness of God I will preach on all of the good things that God has for us but I can't produce it I can't do it it takes the spirit to produce it the fruit of the spirit is of him not of me the life of the spirit is of him not of me the truth of the word is him it's not me it's got to be him from start to finish amen I long for the day where he could move so powerfully that I wouldn't even have to speak but yet I know he's ordained the five-fold ministry to speak but if I speak of my own accord that's going to do us no good it takes him to speak it takes him to discern it takes him to go into our lives to do those things otherwise I'm wasting my time up here I'm putting on a show and not much of one that's just the way it is amen but we know that after the word has gone forth what happens the spirit moves isn't that what happens at the end of a service that's why we don't sing a song in close because after the word has gone forth what happens is the spirit goes behind the word to make it have an effect that's why we linger it might be a Wednesday night we might be tired the kids might have to get up in the morning we might have to get up in the morning but we linger to let the spirit of God have an effect on the word that's been given amen because I don't know what's going on in your life I don't know what you need in in specifics I don't know you know I preached something the other day and on the way home my wife said but John she said I just appreciate that so much but she told she told me what God had been dealing with her on and it was completely different from what I had said but what it did was it got her into a place where God could move in her life in a particular way and so she started telling me I said that's wonderful I wish I would have preached it that way but all it did was it took the word to go forth and the spirit to come behind it and all of a sudden he's working in her life in a way that I don't know about that's why we do it because it's going to take the spirit I can't make it happen you can't make it happen I want to go home not not my literal home I want to go home that is my heart's cry this world is so dark it's tiring it's wearing this is the only good time I'm having these days I can't even get a moose anymore when I'm with Believers that's my joy everything out there it's it's it's so a total waste it's a worry it's a stress there's nothing that adds to me anymore and it never added a whole lot but this this world is absolutely not my home and I want to get out of here but guess what I can't make it happen but you know what I can do and you know what you can do sister Lydia you can make yourself ready to go that's one thing the scripture says the bride has made herself ready why we've got an open word we've got a message that tells us where we need to look what we need to do and how we need to do it we can dress ourselves in his Robes of righteousness we can find ourselves in obedience to his word we can listen to his message we can read his Bible amen we can keep our lives clean we can prepare ourselves like Mary for the word to come forth in its reality that's what we can do we can get ready that's all Mary could do get herself ready but it's just preparation it's not Dynamics it's not Dynamics brother Brown would put it this way he says friends only by the brooding or the cing of the Holy Spirit can you ever do it he says will God ever promise to raise you up as you listen to his voice that still Small Voice that speaks in the depths of your soul but until he speaks until he moves I can't do a thing all I can do is get ready be prepared scripture says that in the fullness of time God sends forth his son made of a woman and until it's the fullness of time for this bride I can't make it happen but I can get ready that's my part be ready scripture says those that are what looking looking the only reason you're looking is two things you want it and you expect it remember brother Ram tells a story of that that that young woman that was at that ranch and the that that rich uh young man went there looking for a wife and she was a dishwasher and he saw her and he watched her and he'd seen all these rich girls parading around and all their gowns and plating themselves and everything but he noticed her and he liked her character and he promised her he says a year from today I'll come back and so she went and she told everybody she says I'm going to be his bride he chose me and they said are you kidding me you have nothing you're nobody she said but he promised I know what he told me and he promised and on the day that he said he would come what was she doing she was dressed in her wedding dress she was standing on the porch and she was waiting for him to come why the bride had made herself ready and just about before the sun went down they said they heard the sound of him coming and he drove up she got in the car or the wagon and off they went everybody sat there and said are you kidding me she knew that's why she made herself ready want to know if you're really believing what you believe are you getting ready to go are you getting ready to go one more quote before we call close says this see how perfect the scripture is a day that won't be called night day or night fruit cannot ripen unless the sun ripens it no matter how much you preach whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be Vindicated only by him who said I am the light of the world the word he says so there has to come forth a power the Holy Spirit himself to ripen or to vindicate or to prove or to make manifested that what he's predicted would happen in this day he says the evening light produces that what a Time amen God bless you let's stand I say tonight let's stay in the light amen that's how we get ready we stay in the light all that happens at the end of that season that growing season when it comes to the light then it comes to maturing there's no more growth it's just seasoning it's just maturing everything that's in it's there the corn the wheat whatever it is it's all there it's not pulling up up anymore it's just staying in the presence of the Sun and it's becoming what it always was that's all he's asking us to do stay in the light stay in the word stick with it let it ripen us amen that's the work it's supposed to be doing and that's the work of the holy spirit is to mature a bride that stayed with the word I wonder how's it going to happen I wonder how are we going to take a Rapture you think about it you think about that sister Brenda that just one day we may be sitting in this service you know we're we're the start of the E Eastern Seaboard it's got to start with us right it's a process we may be sitting together in this church and all of a sudden brother Chad will give the loudest shout he's ever and he'll fire up through that roof how's it going to happen I don't know but brother bradam said that we will call the saint out of their grave man we've lost some precious people Nan I always believe Nan's going to be the one that knocks on my door can you imagine if we were I don't know if we'll even have church then brother Bob I mean it's done the door's closed that he that's filthy be filthy and let he that's holy be holy still but whatever we're doing I think we'll be having some fellowship and we'll sit there and all of a sudden we'll look each other and we'll say it's time to go and we'll know not cuz I said it because the spirit that's in you and I says it's time to go but let me tell you Church before it says it's time to go it'll say it's time to separate it's time to get real it's time to be serious anden we're not going to get to that that that portion if the spirit isn't moving on the face of the waters beforehand I say God help us this evening to be serious to be serious say Lord where am I at if the Rapture were to happen in the morning am I ready to go has the spirit moved to prepare my conditions of my life so that I'm ready to go I say God help me God help you it is his grace alone it is his Mercy alone but he gives it and we have to take it amen I I want to see Nan I want to see Aunt stie dicks again brother Gerald brother I know you'd love to see brother and sister Barnes again wouldn't that be a wonderful time are we ready to see him scripture says they without us cannot be made perfect they're waiting on us I say Lord let us get ready move your spirit in our lives amen amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus
