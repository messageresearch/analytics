hour does anything we need is Grace amen so Lord bless and to bring you greetings from our brother car in New Brunswick he called last evening and looking forward to fellowship really on the phone called me from his church because they have they have services on Saturday usually a prayer service I believe on Saturday night and they have services Wednesday and and again on Sunday so so he sends his greetings to the Saints here and he also informed me that there is a couple another couple from British Columbia that will be traveling to Newfoundland and to st. John's and I understand that they are not Canadians they are the man I think is from Australia so right now they're just travelling across Canada I believe I guest visiting different churches they were not able I don't think to to get to other cars of 70 or service but he did meet the brother somewhere and he told him that he was on his way to Newfoundland but I think right now they might be in in alle facts Nova Scotia so I am not familiar with their name but but someone had told him about us and the church here so he said he was planning on visiting with the Saints here in st. John's but eventually I think you're later on this summer or this year they're planning on moving back to Australia so we pray the grace of God to be with that couple whoever they are and wherever they are at this time a man and again let's be in prayer for our brother car and also pray for sister car I understand according to what he explained that sister car a few days ago had accidentally fallen and she had tripped in something and fallen down and hurt her and and she's having much pain in in one of her hands so we pray the grace of God whither and the doctors apparently couldn't do anything with it or about it and so on so we pray grace to be with our sister cart this time and encourage her and also we thank the Lord for the visit of our brother Rumpke and brother and sister wonky and oh brother Matthew got two and sister amber got to meet the met brother Bob's I believe that was good and I think brother Mark was talking to him amen so what we took them out for a lunch yesterday or not yesterday Friday and it was very spiritual and we talked mainly about the Lord and the things of the Lord and at one and two finally when we're getting close to the end we all joined hands around the table in the restaurant and and he prayed so we thank the Lord for that and we pray god bless brother rocky and we really appreciated the the spiritual part of our conversation talking about the Lord and the things of the Lord and of course the things that we believe he wanted to know who we were where headquarters was when our headquarters is in glory amen most churches got headquarters somewhere in a city on down the earth but I said no we don't have any quarters not it not it not around here and every Church I said is independent by the grace of God so I did say there was a there was a group by city in Indiana and I said they usually do the printing and and published the messages and so on for the for the believers to read or to hear and so but again it was good and we kept the right spirit one toward another so I pray god bless our brother romkey and again sister romkey and she had thanked me for prayer and it was something that happened many many years ago because there was 1995 when the the Adventist school are yes and the other two church run schools when they closed and because the government stopped supporting the teachers and because the government was paying the teachers in the Salvation Army in the Adventists in the Pentecost and he and another in Catholic schools but then the salvage then the government stopped doing that and a lot of the so-called church schools closed so and it was 1995 may even back then when she had mentioned that I had prayed for her and that the Lord had responded practically immediately and she was healed and she was given that all she said I thank you for that I said well I said thank the Lord I said to God be the glory so that's good I do remember that the last graduation ceremony they had in the event of skadam II they did call on me to close in prayer and I do remember praying for a sister who was sick at the time and so I said the Lord might have been her maybe another sister but the Lord did answer prayer and he will that sister thank the Lord so to God be the glory we discussed some other issues but again thank God for the grace of God keeping the right spirit and a right attitude respecting one another and of course he brought he brought off of those students that he taught and he knew the parents Bob and Brendan Marcum pouring and they were bringing them up and so on then he mentioned the students and I think about maybe brother Matthew and I know if they were top of mr. rocky or not you okay there were others our daughter Sharon was taught by mr. Anki amen so we really appreciate we appreciated the did Venice school we did yeah when we moved in here in 1960 and from Paradise to st. John's in 62 my parents put us in church Ron schools they put some of my family in The Salvation Army booth Memorial High School and then they put some more of us into the seventh-day Adventist Academy a man and it was good and brother you don't find schools like that today not by any means because during the break or during the lunch hours they would play gospel music over the PA system now you're not like not even allowed to read the Bible in a school that's right so we thank God for the influence that they had on our young people amen and they respect us thank the Lord and also I believe that maybe you are familiar with mrs. Pierce II she was a principal I think of the elementary school when they built the elementary and understand that she's having physical problems as well and her husband I think is in right now it's in the Millers in in the L Science Center so and because he's had problems also with his with his back so and then infection so we pray the grace of God to mr. mrs. Pierce E and they've been good to us to a man if they met us out there anywhere sauce they come right to us they they they they appreciated the fellowship amen so thank God we were we were witness to them and so the grace of God be with them any man so also there be more of these books out there healing thoughts by the they were printed by believers International and they're put together I guess my sister Rebecca some years ago and brother George Smith so and also a brother called me and he asked for the article on the cremation and so I'll put more of the books out there on cremation is it Christian now of course we know that it is not Christian a man but it's getting to the place where her brother approached me from another denomination out there and he said always said what do you think of cremation he said because even our clergy is getting cremated and so on well I gave him the thoughts on it and he agreed he's I agree he said they shouldn't be doing that because cremation is not Christian and of course I've been approached as well all due respect by a believer who stated that that's what he was going to be he was going to be cremated a message believer I know message believers have been cremated and I said no it's not Christian is not and I said the Prophet said concerning cremation their prophet said that that the righteous are going to walk it on the Astra's of the wicked he said because God is going to cremate the wicked amen so brother sister barbarously would go back to dust not to ashes a man dusted us by the grace of God amen so god help us to stay with the truth and stay in line amen by the grace of God so listen this not get caught up with the world or the things of the world not the way the world is doing things just the way God wants us to do it amen and I want to emphasize some of these sauce this morning from a message that the Prophet preached in 1965 and is entitled I have heard but now I see a man so it's hearing it and seeing it by the grace of God and by the power of the Holy Ghost you seen it as God sees that hearing it as God would want us to hear it by the grace of God so there's a reason that our brother preached this in November 1965 just shortly before the accident and it was in Shreveport our brother Jack Norris assembly that he had preached six sermons one right after the other one day after another six services right during the evenings and I believe it was during this time that he had preached one of the sermons and after he preached the sermon there are some people called that it herded on the edge of telephone woke up and it was people called and told brother Jack Moore they said listen don't get William Branham to preach anymore there don't let him preach the morning and so on but brother brother Jack Moore went looking for brother Branham and couldn't find him he went to this hotel that hotel couldn't find willing Rena and so he just went on back and brother bound he showed up at the service and preached again a man because the Lord didn't want brother Jack Moore to stop the Prophet he knew my brother Jack more anyone to stop the message so god help us mother that says I have heard but now I see this hear it the way God wants us to hear let's see it the way that God wants us to see it a man by the grace of God this stand again and sing only believe all things are possible only believe amen so again be in prayer for the brothers sister romkey they they're leaving to go back to Alberta on Tuesday and this might be their last trip here and I assume this is why they made contact with our brother mark sister Maureen and our brother Bob and sister Brenda he did say that he may not be back again so he just wants to greet greet those that he knew and and those that know him amen so God's grace and when we were even fellowshiping with him fighting that I did show them the pictures of the church and the brothers and sisters in the church and some of some of you of course he recognized and he knew amen so I certainly thank God for his spirit and his attitude amen so this saying only believe all things are possible Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Oh oh Jesus it was anyone we need is Jesus [Music] we need the Great's of these presents we need the anointing of the branches of our Lord Jesus Christ amen he touches here chair to meet your need he's here

name of our Lord Jesus grace grace in Jesus name hallelu thank you Jesus now I really all [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] a man praise the Lord god bless turn with me to st. Mark's Gospel chapter 4 st. Mark's Gospel chapter for the grace of God be with us in the going forth of his word a man it's been a battle spiritually trying to determine what God would have me to minister on and it's been up and down and in and out of course being busy with others as well and other others situations other circumstances so I've been in prayer and I said Lord I said please I said give me direction and leadership and I was thinking about maybe our brother LaFontaine and ministry on some of the things that he was talking about and our brother being nor odd but the Lord had me to lay it aside and to get to come to this message right here I have heard but not I now I see a man maybe we can also apply that to our brother for the fontains messages and all sort of other Ben Norris messages and the other message that we've heard so far this year so we pray the grace of God that we will hear as God wants us to hear it and we're going to see it as God wants us to see it a man and the Prophet is highlighting it how we're going to hear it how are we going to see it what are we going to hear and what are we going to see and we would surely we've got to make sure that we're right in this hour we're in the Bible says it's going to be so if it's so close it would to see the very elect a man there's going to be that there's going to be the truth the absolute truth and there's going to be a another truth that is so close that it's there it's just one thing wrong with it maybe they've added something or took away something a man but there's many a believer being deceived a man because they think it's the message they think it's what the Prophet said they think is what God has said or what I heard this and I see this but let's make sure that we're going to see as God wants us to see and not as what the devil wants us to see a man sir I understand that where we we but we got a battle on our hands a man now that it's not just fighting with our flesh and ourselves it's the anointing that comes in our flesh a man because we are born in sin is Satan working on our minds is Satan working in a you know in our in our physical means and so on and the poverty lights those things right here and we'll get to it and show you that one one of the characters that in the scripture that the part of God I lights in the message I have heard but now I see a man and he said he takes his tax from that from the book about that brother a man and not only that that book was is the oldest book in the Bible and that's not Genesis no no no this book was not before Genesis a man because this brother was in existence before before Moses and so on but God ordained that he would have a part in in the word God ordained that is his testimony would be in the word and the power of God goes back to that brothers testimony and he takes the text there and he highlights it and he said now we want to see what our God looked at this brother how God looked at this man any man so I was God looking at you and that was God looking at me a man and what does God see when he looks at you when it's God see when he looks at me brother and the Prophet our light so this is what God saw when he looked at this man and this is what God heard when he went when he when he paid attention to this man this is the response that God got when God did this to this man and God allowed this happen to this man and so on and he how I guess you maybe you know some of you only know who it is it's joke a man and brother it's amazing that God let the devil do this to JoVE let the devil do that to joke but God had a reason because God wanted wanted wanted to bring out job's confession jobs faith and job's belief what joel had heard and what he saw a man and brother joke joke makes that confession of what he had heard and what he said what he saw a man and it pleased the lord so so what god what we have heard and what we see does it please God but we got to hear it God who the way that God wants us to hear it we got to see it the way that God wants us to see it a man and it so that it pleases God and this is this is what the Prophet is a lady because again he knew he was coming to the end of his ministry he knew that he was coming to the end of his physical life because he mentions it again that he may not be here for this he may not be here for that but he said you will some of you will a man so and indeed we are and we are seeing the things that he's warning about because people are not hearing it the way they should hear it and they're not seeing it the way they should see it a man no no no no no there there there they got into the dynamics but not in the mechanics rather but again not the dynamics and again he highlights that in the end the message on I have earned and now I see a man what is that some people are hearing that the mechanics but they're not seeing the dynamics they're not seeing it as God is revealing it then I've seen it as God is doing this and as God is doing that that I've seen when God is trying to reveal to them a man so I pray grace in the name of the Lord that we're going to see as God wants us to see and we're going to hear it as God wants us to hear it now I'm by the letter but by the dynamics of the revealed word and in st. Mark's Gospel and in verse 13 and he said unto them know ye not this parable and out of then will he know all parables and the sower soweth the word a man and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard Satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts so we have to be on our guard we have to make our calling and election sure a man they were born of God we're not under the influence of the devil but under the influence of Jesus and it says after he said these are they that by the way sight where the word is sown but when they have earned it says Satan cometh immediately a man so Satan is here he's here to cause us to doubt the word that is going forth he's here to cause us to question the word that is going forth he's here to get us to hand to it or to take away from it so the grace of God be with us brother there leave it the way that it is that the Papa said now he said don't make it any bigger than what it is don't make it any smaller than what it is he said leave it the way that it is a man because it is God in and God revealed in simplicity a man so he said these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word I have heard but do you see a man who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness a man and have no root in themselves and so endure but for taught for a time afterward when affliction or persecution arises for the words sake immediately they are offended a man so they have heard the word but they're not really going to respond to it the way that the believer responds the way that God wants us to respond a man to the word and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word a man you can hear it you can say you see it but if you've got to see it the way God wants you to see it you've got to hear the way that God wants you to hear a man and it says and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word so what in your life and what is in my life that is choking the revelation of the word that God has given us a man preventing us from scene of the way that we shouldn't see it a man preventing us from recognizing it the way that we should recognize it Amen why because we're allowing the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of others things Adrian they're loaded to choke the revelation of the word a man or we believe Garson a prophet we believe God opened up the seven seals we believe a God called us out of denominations and we're out we're in the message we're going into the resurrection rapture there's more to it than that a man God wants to manifest himself in you God wants to reveal himself in you and through you amen the same yesterday today and forever is more than just the mechanics of the word God wants to make the word flesh in you a man not knowledge in yuba flesh in you a man not in your head but in your heart so that is not a let us not allow the cares of this world or the deceitfulness of riches or the lusts for other things in the world entering in earth and choke the message a man and he becometh unfruitful and many a believer as allow these things to happen in their lives and they still profess to be believers but they are not and these are they which are sown on good ground such as again hear the word then one of the prophets that i have heard now I see a man but again you guys you got to hear it the way of a seat of God you're going to hear what God wants you to hear how God wants you to hear and you're going to see what God wants you to see there's many a man and a woman out there today and the message so called and brother they're not hearing what God wants them to hear and they're not seeing where God wants them to see amen because the devil is interpreting it and causing them to believe this and believe that this is what it means is what it means brother God is gonna make it flesh in you a man and there in little it will declare itself in the life that you live it'll declare itself in what God does for us and what God is doing for us amen and he said again and he said it becometh unfruitful cerissa is amazing is the message fruitful in your life amen are you there is it in control of your life isn't in control of what you do how you do it when you do it where you do it a man so is it the message in control are you Ewing you controlling the message oh I control this doctrine I control this I control that no it's got to be in you controlling you a man and these are they which are sown on good ground and such as hear the word of God and receive it and bring forth fruit you got to bring forth the fruit of the revealed Word a man is not just to say I believe this and I believe that I got a knowledge of this and I got a knowledge of this I got understanding of this understanding of that no no it's gotta be the word in place there's going to be you the Word made flesh a man if you're if you're a part of the invisible union of Christ and by the prophet of God also preached this message in in brother Jack Morris Church in Shreveport in concerning the invisible Union so brothers sister I pray grace that we're bringing for the fruits of those that are in the invisible union with the heavenly bridegroom amen praise the name of the Lord that you are the bride he's the right room you're going to go and you're going to hear the word as the bride will hear you're going to see it as a great season and you're going to live it as the bride leaves it amen you talk about separation it is an absolute total separation onto the Lord as to the total separation under the break room that's the total separation onto the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture we're caught up with this we're not caught up with anything else a man and then they're going to wonder about us and all what's wrong with you what's wrong with you you don't have nothing to do with this one or this one or this one or that one are there so they're no longer cut off with him up with a with a revelation in another world a man in another realm in the world to come a man god help us that were going to be as Christians we're going to be christ-like and that's what a Christian is this crates like a man bringing for the fruit of Christ in us and he said but he said now he said some dirty fall and some sixty and some hundred well brother down through the ages there was some thirtyfold and some sixty my God's looking for a hundred percent in the right for the rest a man as it was in the prophets in the Old Testament it was made manifest a hundred percent in Christ a man may manifest said portions down through the church ages but now it is absolutely made flesh in the bright mrs. Jesus Christ a million that's a tremendous revelation what that's Jesus Christ yeah but you're a missus Jesus Christ what a position to be in god help us amen that we're going to hear the way we should hear it and we're gonna see it the way we should see it and know who we are amen by the grace of God so in praying God that we're on numbered with those that receive it and hear it and see it a hundred full amen god bless you may be seated so the grace of God if we go further into these thoughts concerning I have heard but now I see hearing is one thing but seeing is another amen there are those that hear this and hear that but they don't see it there are those that are there to hear this and hear that and they know this they know that but they don't understand it a man even even in the natural and as it is in the natural Saudis and the spiritual so hearing is one thing but seeing is another there are those that have heard the message those that are hearing the message but they're not seeing the message because if they're going to see it it's going to reflect itself in them and through them a man it's good it's going to God is going to make it flesh in that brother in that sister in that son and daughter a man if not it's not God is not just calling us to say well now I want you to hear the message and I want you to go ahead and be a witness for the message and we're good and we'll tell tell somebody this will tell somebody that no no yeah what do what God the way that God wants you to reveal it to it to others it's or the life that you live it's through your spirit and your attitude your motives your objectives a man they're going to see that in you a man there's many a believer out there that that's instant in season had a season as it were but not for the right thing but for the wrong there is an in season at a season to tell somebody this to tell them this to tell them that and to condemn this and to condemn that no no don't do that as opposed they as God correct you the Prophet concerning the Rickey's and rec hadiths and he said don't call him Ricky's don't comprehend us and don't look at him with this attitude in that spirit he's because some of them he said are my children amen but see they are self righteous and then they feel that they're they're better than them they feel that they know more than them yeah yeah well they don't know it as they ought to know it if they're going to condemn that person amen no no because if you're gonna know it as you ought to know it brother it's going to take effect in your life any man is going to you're the one that's Korea is going to line up with it it's going to have control of you it's not you controlling them it's neither you controlling that and you controlling something else it's against the word controlling you amen and it's Jesus in you by the grace of Almighty God amen brother sister this is what Jesus wanted when he was in the flesh 2,000 years ago Alleluia he wanted them to submit to him and submit to his leadership to hit to the revelation of the word a man they they they wanted them to hear it the way that they they needed to hear anyone to see it the way they needed to see it but all they were seeing with signs and wonders they might but they were not seeing the revealed word as the God wanted them to see it they were not seeing that God was making his word flesh in Jesus Christ a man oh they they they had the revelation like us today brother the Old Testament Saints they are not old the Old Testament they had a revelation of Messiah Messiah God's going to do this God's going to do that amen and when God did it they didn't hear it the right way and they didn't see it the right way amen but they they they recognize signs and wonders well you know a man the same thing they said about went around they said about Jesus well you know I what kind of man do this and do this and and then preach the way he's preaching we're going to have those signs and then teach what he is teaching amen oh they wanted to sign the one of the they wanted healing they wanted the miracles but they didn't want the word amen why because to hear it the way they needed to hear it and to see the way they needed God wanted them to see it was going to change their lives it was going to change their attitude it was going to change their spirit a man and brother their their emphasis wouldn't be put on this wouldn't be on that no no no and that was going to be on Christ now there's going to be on Redemption now it's going to be a million on the finished work of Calvary praise the name of the Lord but brother they they were under the law so much and they had their the mechanics of the law but not that they're really the dynamics of it they didn't have the spiritual revelation of what God was revealing in the Old Testament they just as you said the the mechanics the the natural oh I heard this I heard this but they didn't see what God wanted to see in it a man Cain never saw what it what Abel saw all my brothers sister Cain saw this they came to when I went out he did this and did that they and he did it for the Lord a man but it didn't please God a man it wasn't the more excellent sacrifice but evil aid the more excellent sacrifice a million because he heard of the way that God wanted him to hear and he saw the way that God wanted them to see it any any win any manifested it a man and he put his life I right brother on on that on that revelation he was willing to is willing to sacrifice his life for that revelation because could because when he did what he did and God Hannah and our brother some years ago the room highlighting the scriptures and he said brother he said we know it's not right there in the Bible but he said I believe this is what happened and he said he said when he come in it when Abel offer his sacrifice he said God came down in fire and consumed it amen just like he did when Moses went up on the Mount and he had those others there you know and they were offering this sacrifice the sacrifice the false gods to false gods and he proposes would I be with their sacrifice and they built an altar and he surrounded it by water a man and the sacrifice was will mine it was water everywhere a man but he knew God was going to answer by fire praise the Lord hallelujah brother God does that sometimes too so that the challenging our faith you know you make it well naturally to us in our natural sight and our feelings well no no no God can't do that because of these God wouldn't do can't do that because of the old man oh my brother you got too much water you think God's going to answer by fire and he said with all the water you got on the sacrifice all the water you got around the altar and Moses knew God was going to answer a million Moses just stood there and waited to their to the others that offer their sacrifices to their false gods and he said always say and then there was no response and what did he say always say they says your God must be asleep he won't be taking a nap and he just highlighted that he was making light of their God and and of what they believed because there was false amen so he waited and they when the our come and the time came for him a man he called on the Lord and the fire came down and brother the fire consumed the water the fire consumed the sacrifice and the fire was all around and over the altar a man see it's hearing it the way that God wants to stare is seen of the way that God wants us to see it and God is going to do it the way that he wants to do it amen it's hearing this word and this message the way that God wants us to hear it has seen us seeing the message the way God wants us to see it and brother God is going to make it flashing you the way that he wants to do it he's gonna he's going to manifest it in you and through you a man the way that he is prophesied a man this has got to be according to the word a man not not like they did in previous ages not under Cain did what he did but let's let's see what Abel did and Cain killed Abel a man because Abel did it according to a God wanting to do it Ava thought the way that God wanted the same but Cain would not accept it and brothers the same thing today it has been in every age God has revealed it this way God has done it this way amen but they but the enemy is there or to say this to say that and to get people to turn away from the truth to get the people to turn away - and not to not to hear it the way that God wants them to hear it not to see the way that God wants them to see it a man so I pray God in the name of the Lord now pay attention to that word hearing and seeing a man because we're coming to a revelation about we're going to hear and how we're going to see by the grace of God the way that God wants us to hear and the way that God wants us to see it a mad and again there's going to be very very few when it comes to the time of the resurrection the time of the rapture there's going to be very few that hear it the way that God wants them to hear it and there's very very shoe that are seen it the way that God wants them to see it a man well they recognize the the the prophet they recognize Jesus they recognize the whole you know as surely a man you got to have gotta be with God and gotta gotta be from the Lord to do what he's doing ain't man brother sister what what about what he was saying whatever the message he was preaching there right there to believe this we believe these signs and wonders but they're not there to believe the word amen oh they'll believe the mechanics of it and they'll believe this portion this portion but they're not going to believe all of it amen do not let go let God have his way in their everyday living everyday living every minute every second of the day oh Lord oh I'll do this and I'll do that Cain was willing to do this came with willing to do that for Berta but for a believers everyday living any needed that you need a fellowship with God he won a fellowship with God not just not just for that day that he offered the sacrifice amen but he won he won the revelation that God was going to accept it and God was going to be there amen even even after the sacrifice a man goggles could be with evil hey Manny God was going to direct him God was gonna lead him God was going to go him and brother and God did a man and it was for a witness to you and me a man and he gave what happened there outside the garden as a witness for you and me because they're their abode they both believe in God can't believe than God Cain talked with God a man he will believe in God able to talk with God a man and yet Cain was serpent seed he was absolute servants II and Abel was the seat of God and came with the seat of the serpent and yet they they they're both but worshiping God but again they're there one was under the right influence the other was under the wrong influence we got to make sure we're under the right influence not the wrong influence under they word of the anointing of the right spirit and not the wrong spirit amen because there's the Spirit of God the spirit of the devil but there's that spirit anointing on Cain and there is a spirit of 90 on yon table this is absolutely amazing amen bye brother and again many are deceived today by their by their false anointing that was on Cain is are many many today not just hardened denominations brother but it's it's denomination nondenominational interdenominational and even a message to churches amen there are those that are under the same spirit that Cain was under under the same anointing that came was under amen remember when the prophet of God preached the message on the indictment he just didn't indict the the denomination struck the second crucifixion of Christ he indicted a non-denominational Zana denominations a million and brother he would indict message believers for crucifying the the Word of God a man because they were doing that back in back in name when before God took the Prophet off the scene he knew what was going on amen like I explained in the message how can I overcome and he preached it in its own tabernacle why because there was many professing believers there that were not overcomers and he said you still want to live like those out there in denominations he says you want to believe this and believe that but live like them and he said no he said you got you got you knew they needed to be born to gain he knew they need to become overcomers amen brother Nigel's overcoming the letter the word but the diner now we're coming to dynamics rather but the mechanics a man she got overcome the mechanics to get to the dynamics brother their name but but Cain he didn't want to overcome the the mechanics but he wasn't interested in the dynamics God said if you do right what you will also be accepted but he wasn't interested he felt that he was right a man he was persuaded himself everything is I did this I did that look at look at his altar and all that he offered on his altar compared to what Abel offered on is a man oh my Cain had a big altar and he offered all of this all of this all those things that was growing in the field and here's Abel out there he got he got one altar and he brings him one lamb and kills it they do you don't just put the living lamb on it he puts a dead lamb on it there's not a living Laham it's a dead lamb and it's a lamb that it's full of blood amen and I think Abel is going to identify with that lamb and he's going to he's going to get blood on himself a man so brother/sister see you got to enter into that oneness with your sacrifice it covered Abel saying a man but God respect respected Abel and God honored Abel and accepted the sacrifice amen and God come down and consumed the sacrifice with fire but brother Cain didn't one that no no because he fell to this he did that so so God said to God should accept that no no no but that wasn't going to cover see him not by any means nor there was no blood in it as it was enable sacrifice a man but a brother how they live yeah brother Abel had a revelation something maybe they then Adam and Eve and explained outside the garden with it we're not we're no we don't have the record of it in the in Genesis all that happened when God came down and put them out of the garden but Abel got the revelation Abel heard what God wanted him to hear and Abel heard of the way guy wanted to hear and Abel saw it the way that God wanted him to see it hey babe boy that's why that's he brought that sacrifice cane didn't hear the way God wanted it here and cane didn't see it the way God wanted to see it because look at the sacrifice that he brought a oh he was pleasing to man he was pleasing to the church or to a human being it looked good it looked good but again it was just a brain a man he was going by his natural sight but not its virtual sight a man became but he was going by his spiritual sight to see it the way that God wanted to see it a million and a Harrod the way God wanted him to hear a man and and what he did proved it what he did it proved he heard it right what he did proved that he saw it right amen and God respected and God honored it and God responded to it with the fire of the Holy Ghost amen but you became was was absolutely upset because God never responded to him not in the way they responded to Cain now God came down and talked to him just saying hold I talk with God yes so did the devil I talk with God so he came a million and his believers feel that I had done this and I did this and I did that's right but again but again Saudi King are you going to do what you able did a man are we going to walk with God as Enoch walked a man brother you talk about hearing the word it Wade the way that God wanted him to hear it and seen it the way that God wanted him to see it brother Enoch saw it Heena heard it because the Bible says he had the faith that plays God a Marian and he was not because God took you anybody God took him into into it you do right bring glory amen so he's there waiting on us by the grace of Almighty God old brothers sister I have heard but now I see Cain heard but didn't see anybody the way that God wanted to see it okay they evil heard it and got and Abel saw what God wanted see a man and his worship reflected what he saw amen does your worship not just there in this building you worship God 24 hours a day a man you're constantly constantly in fellowship with God constantly 24 hours a day amen he never leaves you he never forsakes you he's there but they that yeah when we when we stumble and fall yoke Invictus yeah oh yeah he said he said we haven't where he said if we sin we ever we have a sacrifice we have the we have a mercy seat amen and it's Christ he's there amen the probably God said when we see him he said well it's Christ in the theophany form and he'll pull away and convict us then when we repent it comes very close to us again amen praise the name of the Lord the probably God oh yeah he preached it and even when he was preaching did the he felt the presence of obviously often Eeyore of Christ me get close to him sometimes he walk away from a man and and it was at the profit or somebody else that would was preaching and and everyone said well they turn around go back and shake brother Rams hand and they preached more come back and shake his hand why because the the anointing was pulling away and he wanted more of the anointing amen so Christ would come closer to him by the grace of God so brother it's airing there the way God wants us to hear it and seeing the way God wants to sash it and brother it'll produce the light that God is looking for in you amen hey man so it's a 24-hour worship a 24-hour fellowship a man is there constantly a man but he's dealing with us in our souls the devil is dealing with us in our flesh he's there but so is the devil a man so the grace of God so that we're going to hear what God wants us to hear it and we're going to hear the way he wants us to hear we're going to see it the way that he wants us to see amen how does God want me to hear how does God want me see it amen well he brings that out in in the message here he brings that out in the scripture that he uses and what I read it was in the book of Job a man so he said he's hearing it this way is seen it this way a man so he said as God dealt with job God deals with us God wasn't punishing job God was purging him hey man there are those thing old God was punishing Joel and God was trying to correct job for this and Craig job for that amen and he said God was purging job he wondered was it gonna want to purge out purge out anything of the flesh hey man God want to purge I mean you know anything that's selfish purge it out so that the Holy Ghost is in control amen purge out the influence of this and the influence of that in your life so that the Holy Ghost in your soul is in control the devil is there in your flesh the devil is there in your mind amen brother listen okay is the same thing that K that Cain was dealing with it was it was the devil influencing his thoughts his words his deeds a man but look at another influencing enable influenced his thoughts his words his deeds God accepted him but he had to make the end of more just think the Bible says he had the more excellent sacrifice but Cain's was excellent well see how close it is it would deceive the very elect in this day this our brother has it started so it's going to finish amen there are two spirits back there in the outside the Garden of Eden and in the garden now there's two spirits and at the end where God is going to take us back into the heavenly Eden amen as it was a Cain and Abel there there's a Cain and Abel now a man brother now I tell you the heap in this hour is not gonna be deceived by the devil a man because why she's United with the second Adam a man our Lord Jesus Christ not the first Adam the second Adam remembering again Enoch was the first from the first Adam was the seventh from the first Adam and he said we're the seventh from the second Adam hey man and whether we're gonna have the deal and we are they're not going to we are dealing with the devil the ladybugs are dealing with the devil Shane has got the influence on a lot of lives our so called believers yeah do not live for God they're not loving God they're loving this and loving that oh well thank the Lord for the message and now I'm going on yeah no it's not you got to come to the place where it's not me leaves no more Lord the message thank you for the message thank you for the revelation now Lord let it control me amen I have heard it I say it and I'm gonna yield myself to it a man so it's it's the message in me now and it's it's you Lord living yourself out through me amen brother it's got to be God in control because he is the resurrection in their Upshur a man and we're looking for the resurrection rapture and he's going to make it flashing you and Nate so it's gotta be Christ in me the hope of glory praise the Lord hallelujah brother Aaron is one thing seen is another Amen hear it the way God wants you to hear as it was more excellent in cable and it was very very very very very excellent more excellent any knock hey man because he God took him home praise the Lord what the life that he lived he says he walked with God and was not because God took you praise the Lord but he prophesied after his going there was going to come destruction another man walked with God aybe Adam and Noah rather he walked with God and he heard the way God wanted him to hear it and he saw it the way God wanted him to see it and his life reflected it why he was building a boat on dry land it's amazing will you get this to it Noah well the Lord told me to do this the Lord told me to do this guy came spoke say Adam I know I want you to do this I want you to do that because I'm gonna do this and brother like I said as I was then sold is now and did God just destroy did God say just to say no on his family yes and yet there were sons of God that were destroyed in the flood because right the sons of God never heard it the way they should have heard it never seen it the way they should have seen it ain't man no no and they were controlled by their flesh and they went out and that's where I brought in just recently concerning where bla bla God said they took of themselves wives and all which they chose the prophesied India in the original strands scriptures he said it said that they took unto themselves women he said common-law relationships this is st. you gotta take your stand against those relationships not against a person no no but you cannot you know it go along with common all relationships no no God Goddard judge you for that oh yeah the Bible says you know II that looking at the woman so on and the lost after commits adultery with her in the eyes of God so brother you're looking after looking at after and going along with and encouraging you know common-law relationships God's gonna require that of you you know no you got seeing him it's hearing it the way you should seen it the way you should amen and you'll go and reflect it the way you should but there's too much compromise you talk about compromise today and it's just because their family or their friends or whatever doesn't make no difference I've been born again I got a different family a million and my heart goes out to my new family now why because that relationship is eternal the other one is just natural as the prophet of God said even met about his own family he said after his after sister after his mother passed away and always said he said we're not going to see each other now he said like we used to he said we all come back home he said see mom and he said we see each other but now he said we're not we're not going to come to see see one another and he didn't and there was only one I think brother bounce brothers that was a believer we refer to his doc Branham now and another one he went out to this cult he joined that cult and that's where I asked where he asked where he was buried yeah they went to that to the particular Church see so the brother Brown put the emphasis on the spiritual family not the natural oh yeah the but he was caught up with the spiritual family and even to the point where even sister Rebecca she acknowledged that in in in some of her writings and she says cuz and maybe even brother Billy Paul she's all we were we were we were jealous because God was so caught up with this one on this one and this one but not his natural family brother you got the Holy Ghost you're caught up with a spiritual family most definitely oh you got to do this oh my cupboard the devil deceiving people when it comes to the natural things of life be careful beyond your guard amen well let's let's see how God ordered it in the scriptures God do this God God did this God wanted us to do this God want us to do that amen brother if you're hearing it the way you are here you're gonna see it the way you see we should see it you're gonna reflect it and live it the way you should you're going to take your stand a man you're going to keep your attitude right you're not gonna hold nothing against them but you're gonna take your stand says now listen if they if they question it you tell them and say well you should get married tell you should get back don't do this don't do that's not right yeah cuz we had that problem now and we took our stain and the believers we took our stand against that and the believers took their stand again against us oh let's say somebody said oh brother you know we don't agree with what you're what you're doing what you did I swear that makes no difference to me I says long as God agrees amen and knowing that sometimes calls waiting for you to take your stand and then got a movie in in that son in that daughter in that in that brother in that sister whoever is some family member you got to move in that person but he's waiting for you take your stand and just think your compromise might hinder the moving of the Spirit of God in their lives amen brother that's the truth god help us we're born again amen by the grace of God so hearing is one thing but scene is another brother I hear the message I see the message and if I hear the way I should see the way that I said then it's going to reflect itself in these kind of God's gonna make it flesh in me and in you whoa probably God said your life will testify in the judgment against those that didn't believe it's your life oh they didn't witness to me and the probably God did say he or showed under on the sky there this person and a believer that came by and reflected the life of Christ to them and they ignored it now sometimes you don't have to say anything is what you live it's not what you say it's what you do so they recognize you as having a compromising spirit or a Christian spirit that takes your stand for the truth but you're stupid you've got a right attitude oh yeah we've taken our stand even among other family members are there and then in such situations change they respected us they never held anything against us they knew it was our faith and they respected us I said well Lord thank you you're dealing with them Thank You Lauren so if I compromise maybe the Lord would not have the opportunity to deal with them that's the truth so brother that's here at the way that God wants us to hear and then see it the way God wants us to see it amen and it'll reflect in us oh yes there's a sacrifice there's persecution yeah the Bible says when it comes to the Christian life my minister on that sometime what what does God say it's going to Christian life it's going to be persecutions they says you're going to endure this because it's part of the Christian life you're going to endure a rejection you can be put down criticized yeah and all but I I don't want to endure that so what they'll do what they compromise on the word do I still think they're Christians were compromising on the word yeah no no take you're staying rather and they say it again hearing is one thing scene is another especially in this age we're in the false anointing is so close to the true noting that it would deceive the very elect if possible it is absolutely necessary to make your calling and your election sure and to make sure you hear and see the message the way God wants you to hear it and the way God want you to see it a man turn with me to 2nd Peter chapter 1 2nd Peter chapter 1 and verse 1 Lord that we're going to read the way we should read we're going to hear it the way we should hear it and see it the way we should see it here in the Bible amen that God apply it to your life amen and he said in verse 1 Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ amen grace is the righteousness of God and it says Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things and it's all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue Curitiba thumbed Anita not called just to believe in the mechanics of the word but the dynamics Amen we have been called unto glory and virtue it's amazing anything oh it's like I said when I was at that altar praying and that person next to me praised it all Lord thank you for delivering us out of denominations now we don't have to be subject to any man well they weren't right they never heard the way they should never seen it the way they should because God was gonna bring him out of the nomination they come subject to 5 min 5 ministries and you man oh yeah the minister God has set them in the church for the perfecting of the saints amen don't think well I don't have to do this I don't have to thank God knows what you need God God does it this way amen brother we got to hear it the way God wants us to or see it the way that God wants us to say it a man revealing the will of God and the plan of God the pattern of God this is why the worlds in the message said because they don't recognize God's plan it doesn't recognize God's purpose and it doesn't recognize God's pattern that's the truth that's why there's such a confusion of their because they don't see that that there is a plan here and there's a pattern here and there there's a purpose no they just think this is God did this and the devil to this God did this devil to that and we got to do this no let's get into the pattern let's get into the pan plan and it's getting to the purpose of God amen so it's not you lavinius in your living out your plan and your purpose in your pattern your living out God's plan for your life God's purpose and cause pattern for your life a night as our brother Barry coffee and again of let me remind you of what he said when he was here and he ministered and he said he said every area of your life is predestinated Amen everything in your life is for destinated basically we don't get it all sometimes we do what we want to do and and by god oh god will forgive us and move us on to the next phase by grace thank the Lord for that all type of grace a man it's amazing grace when I count to the two they say this to two of the greatest hymns in the world amen some more than any other hymns in the world he said they said it so I'll great thou art and Amazing Grace a man a man a man what makes him great it's his grace amen praise the Lord hallelujah for God the creator of the ends of the air to do what to sue to do this for you and me and we were born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies and for God to do this God to do that God is with us to help us to encourage us to strengthen us amen to give us wisdom a man did that we all hear the word the way we should hear it and see it the way we should see it oh my brother sister god help us amen a courtier again as his divine power as given unto us all things all things that pertain unto life and godliness we're without excuse and he says through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue we have been called to glory and virtue where is it it's in Christ and if Christ is in me and in you then you got it that glory is in you that virtue is in you but and he said whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these we might be partakers of the divine nature they may praise the Lord hallelujah oh brother there's no excuse for us because God has provided us with everything we need hairy man he knows our weaknesses he knows our problems our struck our stress and our troubles and everything else and a straight provides the answer to everything will every need a man hallelujah a man there are those here to criticize there are those to put down but he's there to lift you up yeah a man that's there those you know they're those among the believers that are weak and they're down here there's those ear there those they're all on different levels but we think everybody got to be on our level no no it's the grace of God you're on the level you're on hey man so pray the grace of God to that brother to that sister that the Lord will be with them in the level they're on amen amen praise the name of the Lord got to require this of them but he Creek where's this of you and then requires that of somebody else amen oh brother sister hallelujah this is given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature see no matter what the need would be no matter what the need is God's provided the answer amen praise the thank you Lord for your love God is love and what what's next grace why because divine law projected divine grace amen and well it's grace - grace gives us the faith to help us and what we need hallelujah to please God God's working in you and bring up this life the bring up this life - this attitude this spirit what for then it pleases God not what pleases you see what the trouble is we're living in a world and then a generation is doing was right in their own eyes oh they're professing to be Christians they're professing to be this and persistent that but they're instead of doing what's right in the eyes of God you're doing what's right in the eyes of Maine yeah oh I think this I think this no don't think let him think that it's this thoughts being you've let his thoughts control amen so he said have except that by these promises might be partakers of the divine nature that's wonderful so what nature is you reflecting the nature you're partaking off is the nature you're reflecting the attitude you're reflecting the spirit you're reflecting look at King what he was reflecting and look unable what he reflected and he laid down his life for it when Cain killed him and he said having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust oh my brother Todd Buddhist partaking of the divine nature the life of we live will reflect that we're protecting of a divine nature yeah and all brother that means I'm not gonna have no mistakes oh yes but you'll be convicted there's many not convicted but if you're a seed of God brother you're going you're going to recognize your mistakes you're going to be convicted of your mistakes convicted of this convicted of that oh yeah yeah and you know what conviction does if your seed of God it probably brings repentance forgive me Lord amen you point you to Calvary I've give you the promises I've given you the power a man I give you the virtue the virtue of Christ who someone look at this one say that was oh that's a perfect son and son or daughter there Oh what they're not perfect oh yes there you look at them through the eyes of God see them as God sees them oh yeah so I said don't don't condemn this one condemn that one brother BAM said the angel the angel told brother round don't condemn this one that one condemn the sin but don't condemn the person yeah it's just like I sometimes that brother takes grace takes grace to do that because even when I was out there while ago and I saw this woman door and she was I guess maybe 70s or close to 70 years old for short-haul woman and here she is in a pair of shorts tight shorts and tight sweater and you look at her legs well they were agent oh yes they were turning purple you know the they were they had these spots on them and these spots on them I said Lord I said help me to keep my attitude right and my spirit right I said I said because that that is the insanity for for a woman that old who want to expose her body like that you know and you could see the agent part of the of the of the legs getting big and fat and so I'm pushing out here and pushing out there and I was oh my lord I said lord I spiced an order to convict her I said I don't I don't know but I said she needs conviction so I said so she's gonna she's gonna dress right you know I said that's not normal for a person or her age because if she was a just a young woman and she had a nice body and all that then she'd be there too old to show off her body but I said for a woman that old I said that don't make sense and the slacks were so tight and not only that of course even the young now today of course when it comes to the girls nothing one time they wore slacks but it wasn't taped it was just like the bad pants that a man would wear or something but there wasn't tight but now it's tight everything is so tight yeah perfect gonna cuff too tight that they were perverted yeah that's the enemy brother that's insane insanity one time they would never wear it like that they wear slacks will do would were tight like that but now it's gone and when I saw that dead lady on I pray God convict her lashes that don't make sense I said for your your grandmother or your great-grandmother to be out there like that you know and there's just very few mothers that would even go out like it you know but they're not now but one time it was a man because again it was rare that I even seen my mother in slacks I once or twice you know even went berry picking she never wore slacks eyes it isn't amazing you know today it's it's everywhere but you notice that it's mostly women that's going to the extremes when it comes to the clothing they wear not the men yeah so I pray the grace of God to that woman and I pray God convict her oh my god they just didn't like they just didn't look good you know because like I said to my father I wrote my father if my father saw that he was what would he say he would say well she belongs into Waterford yeah and and he's right well the whole world he belongs in the Waterford most of the world ain't not all of them but most of them well we pray grace of God to them Lord it was grace to us His grace to them amen good they're good there goes auspi for the grace of God amen praise the name of the Lord so brother we need his virtue amen and he said besides this verse fine giving all diligence add to your faith virtue now watch these things we'll be closing shortly like I just started it says now you should add to your faith virtue a man and a virtue knowledge but it's got to be the correct and vital knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now he said to the knowledge temperance hmm and a temperance patience anything we need is patience with one another I got patients with us we're gonna have patience with one another amen and add to your patience godliness attitude and spirit conversation godliness and a God of this brotherly kindness old brother these our brother Scofield says this is the Christian virtues this is the Christian nature a man if you got Christ in you and you're born again you're going to manifest these attributes a man and this is to godliness he said brotherly kindness a man brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness divine law terribly a man and God oh brother what does God expect now he expects add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and God crowded with divine law amen in the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride brother if there's Lord forgive us and lord help us is our relationship with the Lord crowned with divine love yes a man brother that's a challenge I have heard faith I've heard about virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness hey man and I see it but lord I heard about the crown of divine love do I see that do I see that in my brothers and sisters are they seeing that in me divine love Lord that the God that loved you a man that through you he would love one another just thinking that is serious a man the stature of a perfect man and this was again preached by the ministry of our brother branham some years ago the statue of a perfect man and he and he drew it out and so on and again down through the ages all the messengers they were they were fighting the devil in every age they were fighting the devil andhe finally in the last age looking for brotherly kindness and he was put out of the he was put out of the church amen but he made flesh in his bride by the grace of God he said opened the door and he said I'll come in and sup with you and you with me brother what door is it not the door of the church at the door of our hearts hallelujah so that he could make himself flesh in his bride praise the Lord amen and so he said had to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness he said charity for these things be in you if these things be in you and abound not just in you but they're bound in you oh they're on fire they're they're full of life amen it says they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ and is the correct than vital knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but it's built on this if these things be in you by the grace of God they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ not just mechanics not the letter of the word but the Spirit amen praise the Lord but either lack of these things is blind and cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins yes god help us wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for did he do these things he shall never fall if you do these things add to your faith a crown with divine law you shall never fall for so an entrance should be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ tremendous let's make sure we hear it like Joel heard it let's make sure we see it like Jobe saw it and how did he hear it they're at revelation there how did he and what did he see how did he see probably I'll highlight sit amen he heard it through the year of the soul not through his ears but warned ear of the soul that ended up in here hear what the Spirit is saying amen and how did he see it he saw it with the eye one eye I'll be soul he did yes he did so it's not what your your your herring with your ears there's watcher your you are hearing with the year that end that at the near Oh Lord we all got ears no he said I'm talking about the year one in your soul a man and how do you see it oh I see with my eyes no Kane saw it with his eyes but Abel sought with his eye the eye of faith a man oh yes now put your eyes now with your mind is with the eye of the soul the year of the soul it's single a man by the grace of God turn with me and we'll finish with your scripture job 42 hallelujah job 42 praise the Lord verse 1 then job answered the Lord and said I know that thou canst do everything and that no thought can be with olan from thee who is he that I did counsel without knowledge therefore every other that I understood not and things too wonderful for me which I knew not we're guilty of that we got to get in the spirit get in the Holy Spirit amen so we're going to stalk let's talk in the spirit not intellectually spiritually he said here I beseech thee and I will speak I will demand of thee and declare thou unto me notice I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear not ears warning here I have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now mine eye not mine eyes mine I see at thee amen just the text the Prophet brings out so brother I have heard not by these years but hear of the soul one ear now I see not with these eyes or the understanding of the mind but the revelation in the heart amen so he said I have heard of thee by the hearing of the year but now mine I see thee praise the Lord it is singular not plural wherefore I bore myself and repent in dust and ashes amen reading the text in 1965 the Prophet said let's take a little of job's life he said job was a prophet he was a man that lived back before the word the Bible was written and it's been taught that Joel was one of the oldest books of the Bible because it was written before Genesis was written and he said job this great warrior and prophet no doubt that he had been brought up and had served the Lord all of his life and had lived such a gallant life to the people all had respects for him just think that somebody before Genesis had this revelation of God yeah before Abraham before Moses before Noah they had this revelation of God Joe said buddy come to a place where he calls it here being tempted of the Lord but I'd like to use the word being tested by the Lord and truly every Sun that cometh to God must first be tested tried and child trained and then he said if the testing gets hard and we think it's too heard and won't listen take heed he said we become as illegitimate child not a child of God because there is nothing can move a real born-again child of God away from his parent he says see he's part of him you heard it ministered recently concerning all babies go to heaven no they don't good remember when they sent the soul out to destroy the Amalekites someone said to brother Ram you mean this remedy gonna destroy the babies yes he said they did they killed the babies why he said because they were growing Amalekites and it was in their heart against Israel he's again the part of God said he said serpent seed can give serpent seed parents can give birth to a seed of God and he said Christian parents seed of God parents can give birth to a serpent seed and that's true as a couple that we met and they told us about their family they're not serving the Lord that mom and daddys but there's maybe a certain son or a certain daughter's not and not interested in them why his servants eat so he said God knows the heart we looked and we see a baby God looks and sees he's a full-grown child brother Brennan went beyond the curtain of time after he had lost his wife and his daughter amen and he saw Sarah and she said he said who are you she's you don't know me she said I'm Sarah Kevin he buried her she was just a baby just a baby he witnessed her death and he buried her with sister Branham he's first wife and so on and she said oh I'm Sarah she says you know there's no babies here she said and he knew that and like I said there was a magazine from an evangelist that sister Byrne said their magazine and I don't know where it is now but that evangelist was testifying about beyond the curtain of time and they were certain person was saying or beyond the curtain of time the children are raised you know and they go from this to this to this to this and he said I don't agree with that he said I'll be honest he said I believe boys and Branham more than I believe what she was saying he said William Betty and he give the testimony of Willie Browns experience beyond the curtain of time he said I believe that now he wasn't believing in the message but he respected brother Brown yeah and brother Brown when he got beyond the curtain of time there were Sarah hey man we will be on the curtain of time we're surprised that Jenna and sisters and sister Justine my hard to believe that they're that they're this big now yeah well beyond the curtain of time there might be a little bit bigger might be a little bit taller and the others were we do they're full grown but you're gonna be around 20 years old yeah by the grace of God a man that if you were if you were to accept from here beyond the curtain of time you see yours you see yourself you know as adults but I only run 20 years old if brother Bob spent beyond the curtain of time I guess he'd have his hair back and it wouldn't be white or gray amen no no yeah and he wouldn't have no wrinkles so so well amar Singh so we'd be all all freeze the Lord would be all young he meant for we'll step from time to Eternity by the grace of God wonderful and explaining to our brother romkey concerning death we're talking about that and so on I said well I said when you when you get over there I see you're going to go into another body the oppening body I said the Bible refers to and I should you as you can see one another talk to one another but you can't touch one another you can't touch one another I said but I said but I said you're you can really you really talk and I said you can do you want you can't eat unless you're not in a glorified body yet you're in a theophany body the Bible refers to that and I give examples in the scripture and so on and let him know amen so even her brother Ravi and sister Rafi coming back young you know because they because the certain church feels that when you die you're dead you don't know nothing you're not gone anywhere you're just aired an Indian degree no no no no no that's not it so I've brought up many a scripture and so on so I said you go from can go up from time to eternity actually if this body be destroyed we have one already waiting eternal in the heavens amen so as that's the scripture that's thus saith the Lord amen but again this does a lot of churches believe that you're all the data sore out during the cemetery's know if they're righteous they're not they're in the cemetery thank God that he gave us a problem I we believe sister coffee is not there yeah as when we were at sister coffees wake and brother guy was there and he looked he said mother he said that's not sister copy he says she's not there in the box no he says she's in glory and he says she's got it she's got a young body now he says thank the Lord he said she's with the Prophet now she says she's with those of this dissertation now or the bride aids amen she's fellowshiping with them praise the name of the Lord trusting and believing that that's where sister done pretties there fellow should be with it with the Saints a man from this age they're waiting on you and me amen because when we get ready to go donors step into glorified bodies amen and we'll go in 35 bodies thank God please I pray grace that God makes these things more real to us than the natural things of life because the be honest the world were living in is gone people people know that the world's come to an end they do well it's like that scientists that just died did a while ago I don't know when maybe a year ago and he said he told what he's told all the other scientists he said get Mars ready to live on he said because the earth is coming to an end he says he's vanishing away he knew that and he felt that and there's there's many other scientists believe the same thing has come to an end and there's a tremendous climate change going on we know that you know well the prophet of God said nature will take a tumble and it and it is taking a tumble but I pray grace we're not going to take it for granted I pray grace we're going to take it serious and look pop a mint for our change he says there's nothing more real than a born-again child of God away from his parent see he's part of him you can no more deny it you deny yourself you've had the experience you've been trained and tested and now he said this man he said been a prophet he had access he said to God's grace thank God that's true Christ we have access to grace but it's a joke didn't have a Bible to read and he said but he had access to God by revelation and by vision why he said even everybody respected him even to his wisdom had become so great and his inspiration from God had vindicated him to be God's servant so plainly until people come from everywhere to hear him and then he says Satan began to accuse that man and that's the way he does every inspired servant of God Satan is always there to accuse him of everything that he does that's not right and now we find out his life and trials amen and is great faith and even Jesus when he came on the earth he referred to the patience of Job and he said have you not rid of the patience of Job and faith waits with patience for the promised word to be fulfilled amen and were waiting with patience for the fulfillment of the resurrection and rapture and notices it air that job after he went through his trials he had a lovely family and they were taken from him he had a good elf and it was taken from him everything that he owned in his life was taken and he had a ash heap with a piece of crock scraping his boils and even to his own wife spoke against him why not curse God and die and he said those because like a foolish woman and he said the Lord gave and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen now he says Satan had come up before God and he could come before God and accuse the Cris accused believers all the time he said I want you to notice that the confidence that God had in a believer God said not said to Satan he says you can't do it job is a just man job is just a fight he is a good man and there's not one like him in the whole earth all what a man that God Himself would say to his enemy my servant is so perfect there's not another man on earth like him oh if we could only be that kind of a man that God could bestow that confidence upon us that know that we're not twisted from his word or is being anyway stay exactly and he said he can put his trust in us amen he could trust job oh yeah he wasn't correcting job he was purging him to purge out cleanse him perfect bring him to a more greater and greater perfection but job still held right on there was no turning back no matter what happens we don't turn back no matter what happens we're not going to accuse God no no God you shouldn't have done this you shouldn't have done that God does what he you know feels is necessary for you for me in your life in our lives why this Lord why that what is the reason for it amen job was respected people come from everywhere to get jobs counsel and advice grace to his brother he said you see when a man or a person has once really come into contact with God with that genuine revealed faith that God is there is nothing no time nowhere can ever separate that man from is God no he says Satan thought he could twist him around a little bit cuff him up make him do this but you see Joel with his perfect revelation of God and who God was and how God loved him and he waited no matter what the circumstances was he waited for his faith to be confirmed because he had a grip on God a revelation amen and when you can get that type of revelation that you are justified when you are exactly justified in asking the thing that you're asking and believe that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him there's nothing ever separate you from that faith that anchored to you first it has to be revealed to you I have heard Lord job said now I see a man I have heard by the airing of my ear but now mine I not mine eyes mine I see at thee job was in contact with God job was in fellowship with God he didn't know why the Lord permitted this and why the Lord permitted that but he he went along with God and brother it's a lesson to us to go along with God let's not tell god what to do let God tell us what to do amen by the grace of God he said see I'll finish with this quote here we don't use the gift of God for commercial no no no he could tell me where it was at but I don't have any need of it I wouldn't even have faith enough to ask him if I had a need of I believe if I'd asked him he tell me but first see your motives and objectives as to be right you have to have reasons for this and God don't go and give you those things just because you ask you ask in faith unless there's a real objective to be in the will of God and if you want to be well what do you want to be well for if you want to be healed what's the reason you want to be healed what are you telling God what do you want to do with your life when you get ield you've got to have a motive a right motive and a right objective and they have to be right according to the will of God and theirs when the faith is revealed to you and God by his Sovereign Grace places that faith India amen remember he said no selfish work will work it won't work your motives and objectives are to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith there if our hearts condemn us not then have we confidence toward God and we've got to have confidence I want this to to the honor and the glory of God then faith a channel to move into if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith and not genuine faith from God the intellectual faith will get you nowhere might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for amen brother we got to have a right attitude right spirit we got to hear it here the right and we got to see it right we got to hear it in our souls see it in our souls amen by the grace of Almighty God a man and heard our motive and objective is for the glory of God amen I have heard but now I see and it's for the glory of God that I do what I do say what I say amen go where I go sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God a man why sure that we're going to see as God wants us to see and hear it as God wants us to hear it amen and don't let the devil interfere with your your hearing and your Z don't let the devil put his ideas and his thoughts in there amen no no that God be in control by the grace of God amen god bless you list and praise the Lord this thing hold the fort oh my comrades see the signal waving in the sky reinforcements now appearing victory is nigh amen hold the fort for I am coming Jesus signals still wave the answer back to heaven by his thy grace we will non Donna says fierce and long the battle rages but our help is near on where comes our great commander cheer might come rich cheer amen god bless you and give us the the year of the soul and the eye of the soul and so we're going to hear what God wants us to hear and see what God wants us to see amen not what man wants us to see what God wants to see amen and it's got to be according to the scriptures but you know it's gonna be God in simplicity because people are making it bigger than what it is but leave it the way that is as I said resurrection is resurrection we know what a resurrection is Jesus was the example of it so we know what resurrection is don't try to make it any bigger than what it is we know what rapture is so don't make it any bigger than what it is just just believe it and pray God God's grace that we're going to we're experiencing them that we are resurrected and we are raptured than we are we are being resurrected and we are being raptured by grace amen let's sing [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
