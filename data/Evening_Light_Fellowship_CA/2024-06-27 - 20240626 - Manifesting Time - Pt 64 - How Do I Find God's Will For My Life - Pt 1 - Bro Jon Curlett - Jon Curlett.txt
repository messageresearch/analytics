your word foundation is salute Lord It's the rock that is a shelter in a in a weary land lord it's a an Ever flowing Fountain Lord that feeds us and satisfies our thirst every day Lord help us this night strengthen us Lord correct us where we need it Lord have your way in your people we ask in Jesus Christ's name we're praying it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians chapter 1 Ephesians chapter 1 amen it's exciting to receive the email today from the deacons reminding us of the special service is coming up next week so we want to keep that in prayer amen we'll have four Services as we know brother Jerry take the first two and then brother Paul aonan will take the last two and then we'll see if maybe we might even have a guest Wednesday lead but uh keep that in prayer amen that God would move and invite someone to church you know it's a great time to lots of people have asked about services and what are you doing there it's a great time to say hey we're having a dedication set meetings this weekend come out and see what it's about come in and enjoy the spirit of God and maybe he'll do and so forward to that I also received a number of books when brother George Smith was here of course he's he he helps run Believers International books out there on the uh the shelves out there and these reformatted versions that have been cleaned up and grammar IED a bit and made a little uh easier then we have as well um so the church ages we haven't put out the Seven Seals ones we have but we have plenty of the church age books if you're looking for the newer ones and the Beautiful leather covers and whatnot um I've been going through it some others I know are going through it and it's just a wonderful wonderful thing for a Believer we encourage that have um the book on music and that uh there's enough I think for one per family so if you want that take it we have a healing thoughts so they're there for if you want them they're not assigned to anybody once you're done with it maybe you could bring back since we only have a few and then there lots of witnessing tracks there as well on baptism and these different things if them out of the church and whatnot which is nice because the church age books big and thick and expensive resume of the church ages if they like that then you can give them the full Church age book later or something like that as well for the children and uh sister Blanca and and sister Priscilla will probably manage handing those out as well but by all means take what you want they're there to be used and to others that might be interested in this end time message amen God bless you Ephesians chapter 1 and verse three I feel like we've read Ephesians so many times and so it's the Joshua of the New Testament and it's our book amen that's the it's the book for those that were sitting directly under the prophet's message this was Paul's Church in Ephesian uh the in Ephesus and and this was his body of Believers and we see they're the greatest of all of them if you want to compare the descriptions between the Corinthians and the Hebrews and these different things the Ephesians were the best of the best and they're they're put in alignment and and all the things of God are are discussed with the Ephesian Church age so this is our amen this is a a portion that's dedicated certainly the elect it's it's to the Saints it's not those that are out and those that are in no it's it's for those that are hidden in Christ I want us to really focus on that this evening and in verse three it says blessed be the God and Father of who blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will we're going to be speaking on how do I find God's will for my life here's God's will for your life the adoption of children by his good pleasure amen it says to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times that's when it's all wrapped up he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in Earth even in him so we see that his will leads us into full Redemption full restoration and relation with him so if you want to know what is the mystery of God's will is this it will bring you in closer relationship with him and his people time that is the purpose of God it's to bring us back into what we have before the foundation of the world Amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and I'm taking the next few Services as I said I want to just entitle this how do I find God's will for my life and this is a massive top Johnson and Calgary like nine services in on this and he hasn't finished it yet and take I think one or or two Services probably on it and so we we we won't hit the depths of it certainly but we want to pre in the in the perspective of adoption because we can look at adoption and the placing of children we say well what's the will of God have to do with that the will of God has everything to do with adoption in fact you cannot come into adoption unless you learn how to find the will of God that's what is that's what makes known an adopted child is when they can find the will of God and they can stay stay in it amen so we've got to be able to find God's will for our lives and we see here even as we've read we're going to talk tonight about the general the big picture the prophetic view if you want to look at it this way and then on Sunday Lord willing down to where the rubber meets the road and our day-to-day lives but we see here that Paul talks about the revealing of the mystery of God and in verse five he talked about adoption and then now he down into verse 9 he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure where he already told us what that was he says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will his will is to bring us into spiritual maturity amen John would say in third John he said that what I would that thou wouldest prosper and be in good health even as what even as thy soul prospers amen the the purpose of God is to bring us to spiritual maturity it is to bring us into what we are supposed to be as children of God as Sons and Daughters of God and so in doing that we've got to be able to find God's will adoption hinges on finding God's purpose and God's will for our lives and so we've got to be able to find it we've got to learn how do I find God's Will and then when we find it we've got to learn how to stick with it amen we've got to learn that once God shows us what he wants done we don't move off that for anybody though Paul said remember though any like to have been there with him wouldn't you now he said he has made known to us a mystery remember it cannot be taught in any Seminary it's a mystery you cannot by theology you cannot know it just by good message teaching if I could put it that way but it's a personal revelation to you of what God wants done in your life he says it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God so the mystery of God's will is dependent upon us coming into maturity it's all all tied together adoption and his will because his will is for us to come into adoption and in there we start to do the Greater Works which is the Fulfillment of Christ uh Christ's Ministry in this day then he says now tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God were ever to be manifested outside of this time now when was there ever a time in history they were to manifest the time to deliver all Nature Nature Nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifest station why before the atona was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out before all the Old Testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestations they couldn't have the full manifestation of the sons of God in those days he says it had to wait till this time you're in a very special time tonight Church you're in a time when God is looking to fulfill the totality of his word to the Gentile bride he says now all things have been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ till it will join him and his church together now catch that says their ministry will be so close what a statement what a promise their Ministry this is a multi-member bride he's talking about it's not just a prophet it's not just the men that are in the fivefold ministry but this is the complete Ministry of the Bride in this age that he's talking about but we can take something like that and we can look at it and we can stare at it and we can make it so big that it becomes Pie in the Sky for us it's unobtainable it's unachievable how in the world could we ever have a Ministry you mothers you sisters maybe say how can I have a Ministry like Christ I'm not even a man but he says their ministry will be so close like Christ till it will join him and his church together amen it's a body of Believers coming into Union with Christ but we can put these things so high that they that that we can't even comprehend how we get into that but if we want to look at us continuing the works of Christ we have to look at what the works of Christ were and remember we talked about this earlier so I'm not going to dwell on it too much today but his Works were to fulfill the word of God that were written about him that's what it means to continue the work of Christ is not to go out and do what he did he turned the water into wine he raised the dead yes he healed the sick he walked on water he did all of these things but that's what was written of him that's what was shown to him that's what was revealed to him so it was for him to do that doesn't mean that's for me to do there are elements of that that as a minister I'm told to do and that means it's part of God's will for my life but God has not called me to walk on the water but if he does call me to walk on the water he'll get Give Me Faith to do it and he'll change all of nature to make it happen because he obligates himself to his word and he will not give you his will without a means to Pro to to fulfill his will he's not a God that leaves us hanging amen he'll provide a way for us to do these things Jesus was ordained to do one thing we're ordained to do something and his was to show the potential of God in flesh but it was the full potential there was no limitation on him I've only got a portion you've only got a portion and the works are commensurate with the portion he's given and the role that he's given us amen but his purpose was to do the father's will that was what he was there to do that's the key if you're going to have a Ministry like Jesus Christ you've got to be able to find the will of God for your life that's all of this amen but I want to set a General tone this morning because the the will of God is first and foremost to have the preeminence in his bride remember brother Bram in the Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said it was Christ to reveal or God to reveal himself in Christ and then to have the preeminence as in his bride and then to restore us to our un condition his will for this age is for him to have the preeminence in my life and in your life that's what he's trying to do is get the preeminence amen and the that means that the littlest the youngest the weakest Christian in here can have a Ministry just like Jesus Christ purely by finding the will of God for their life that's what it comes down to it doesn't have to be rocket science if you can find the will of God you can walk in confidence because what's going to happen is every time that we come up to something when we stand on the will of God Satan comes behind it to try and knock us off our pins try to take us off our foundation and we've got to be able to stand there and say I know that this is his will because when the storm comes up you've got to have an anchor and the anchor is I'm standing on his will which is his word amen now brother brandham will continue in this adoption number four series and he does something really strange because he's talking about the mystery of God being revealed to the children of God and then he just takes his corner and he turns and he starts talking about melchisedek and Abraham and and he jumps into David and it just seems like it's unrelated but I want to read it as we we set a tone here this evening and then he says now that's Abraham returning now from the slaughter of the kings came back on his rad back bringing back lot all the people that have been taken away and he says all because a child of God in their position is all about souls it's all about preservation of life amen Abraham's not just running around with blessings for himself but being under the blessings of God it gets extended to those that are under Abraham's care and concern amen he says like David what did David do he took the little slingshot went out and grabbed this little lamb out of the lion's mouth think of a slingshot going after a lamb who in the world would do that he says tell me what man in here will do and raise up your hand I'll tell you right quick you're wrong you don't put mine up no I wouldn't go after him with a 30 out 6 hardly he wouldn't go after him with a high-powered rifle line but he says David went out with a slingshot he says but he went after him with a slingshot a little piece of leather two strings on it wind it around and when it come time for Goliath to make his boast he went after Goliath and said the god of Heaven has led me deliver a lamb out of the mouth of a lion and out of the mouth of a bear he knew it wasn't a slingshot see we're talking about adoption in the mystery of his will we've got to realize this is not about me this is not in my strength this is not in my power it's not in my intellect it's not in my study but it's in something and it's a revelation that I'm with God and therefore God is with me he says it wasn't the slingshot it was the power of God that went with him he was the one that brought the land back it wasn't David that got that land back it was Christ working through David that brought that land back then then that went and killed that lion that killed that bear when it turned on him he says that's what we say today God's got David sticking around yes sir that's feeding the father's sheep and once in a while a tumor will come or a cancer will come or something and jump Plum out of the hands of the doctor that won't stop that David he'll go right on out there after that fellow with a little slingshot of ask anything in my name and it shall be given I don't care the doctors can laugh everyone can make fun of him he'll go go after him anyhow and bring that sheep back to the fold yes sir he'll say he's God's child take your hand off of him knock this lion down then the lion rose up and he grabbed him by the beard and killed him a little bitty Ruddy boy probably weighed 80 or 90 lbs what's the point he's making it's not about how big you are it's not about how great you are it's not about everything you've done but it's whether or not you're in the will of God Amen if you stay there then it's not about you it's the behind you that's going to make the difference in these things he says notice this MDC as soon as he met Abraham coming from the slaughter of the Kings he says the mystery of God now being made known who was he nobody they can't find any history of him because he didn't have any father he didn't have any mother he never never had any time he began he never had any time he'd ever die so whoever he was is still alive he never did have a beginning so he couldn't have been nobody else but L El him self-existing self abiding almighty God God came to Abraham and met him on the road he said Jesus had a father Jesus had a mother Jesus had a beginning of days Jesus had an ending of Earthly life but this man had neither father nor mother amen no father or mother Jesus had both father and mother this man had neither amen and what did he do after the battle was over after Abraham had took his position we're talking about the mystery of his as well we're talking about adoption he says after the church takes its position we're called to the adoption of sons by the Holy Spirit he says and when each man takes his position what God has called him to do and stand to the end of the road going after the Lost adoption is about souls it's about preservation of life it's about putting the Dominion of God over the Dominion of Satan it's taking back what belonged to you that's what this is about and he says when he stands in his position and he's not standing out there saying I'm blessed of God I've got all this money I've got all these sheep I've got all these cattle lot made a bad decision it's on him no he took all of his servants and he said let's go get lot lot can't help himself let's go help lot let's preserve his life peradventure he will come back around to what he needs to believe amen put himself out there for that and then brother R steps into this beautiful quote he says now this may just choke you to death he says but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods Hallelujah this evening you're an amateure God if you are a child of God that's born of the Holy Spirit he says how many know that Jesus said so Jesus said did not your law say itself that you are gods and if you call them Gods who the word came to is what it means he says when God said in Genesis 2 that they were Gods because they were they had full domain over the Dominion of the world he gave them dominion over all things but he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain and Satan took it over God's will is for us to take it back that's what he's talking about here he says but brother we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to to the top when the false sons of God will be manifested when the power of God will walk out and will take every Power that Satan's got away from him he says yes sir it belongs to him it belongs to you brother it belongs to you sister is what he's saying God gave it to you in the beginning and in this end time in the wrap up of the dispensation of the Gentile Church he's giving it back to his bride to take spiritual dominion over Satan we do not take control of the Earth this is a spiritual warfare we're not going to take over politics it doesn't matter who gets in as prime minister it doesn't matter who wins the US election that is not our battle but our battle is to take back that which we have lost by Satan that's what we're looking for amen he says go right back to Genesis to the original what is it now the world and nature is groaning crying everything's moving what for for the manifestation of the sons of God when true Sons born Sons filled Sons speak and their word is backed he says I believe we're on the border of it right now yes sir say to this mountain let it be so now I want to be very careful here as we read this next quote he says brother I desire so and so a certain thing done I'm a Believer in Jesus Christ and he says I give it to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a manifestation oh brother my crops are burning up out yonder I haven't had any rain I'll send you a raining in the name of the Lord and there shall come oh waiting groaning all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God God ordained it at the beginning and he gave man the domain but see this is where we trip up sometime because there's this is an amazing quote and and we have a real tendency to dwell on this portion of it amen you preach that in any convention and people will be running and hooping and hollering but the problem is is after they go out then they start speaking and nothing happens and then they get disappointed and then they fall away and then they start to B doubt their relationship they start to doubt their experience and they say but the brother said if I say it then God will back it up this is why I've said in recent Services we do not make this message an absolute we do not make brother Bram an absolute because if you take this quote out of context you'll get into a place where God won't back you up because you've got to take it to the absolute and the absolute will put it into perfect context so that you can take this quote and you can stand on it because the word puts it right where it needs to be amen that's what the word is there to do let's take it back to the word because if what happens if people won't read the entire message they'll take just quotes of it they'll fail time and time again because they won't run it through the filter of Genesis to Revelation what did John say he says this is the confidence that we have in him how many want to be confident when you ask God for something he says here's the confidence that if we ask anything he heareth us no see you got to take everything he says Jesus said if you ask anything in my name I'll give it to you but you run that now through 1 John 5:14 that's a very different scripture Now isn't it and it cannot contradict you got to take it all together and that gives you the full recipe to come out with a son and daughter of God that's been adopted he says if you ask anything according to his will he heareth us that means he'll listen and then it says and if and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him we have to tie this quote of brother Brams back to scripture amen we can't take that quote and run with it but we run it through this and now we can say what is God's will for me cuz listen God will put hard times on us at times God will use these things to produce a certain effect in our life to draw us closer to him to show himself great to show himself Mighty but also to bring us back into line sometimes we've got to know what we're doing with these things amen what is the key that makes that quote from Brother brandham absolute the key is if it's according to his will that is always what it's going to be as if it's according to his will because remember what uh Jesus said ask abundantly that your joy may be full but the thing is to seek what that would look like don't limit God by your request that's what we do so many times Lord I want this certain car Lord I want this and that say Lord give me a car and whatever he gives you will be the best that he could give you sometimes we say I want this I want that say Lord this is my need would you provide it that's how you get above and beyond is because he wants to do above Beyond and sometimes our request limits him rather than it opens him up to do whatever he wants to do amen the key to the confidence in your prayers and asking God for things is in seeking his will first and spending that time in doing it amen that takes time that takes waiting on God that takes that takes putting yourself uh aside it takes humbling ourselves it takes patience amen when you look at the scripture how many times do people have to wait for an answer from God time and time again time and time again and sometimes they've got the promise and then they've got to wait on that they get the answer but the answer doesn't necessarily come into full manifestation right then amen it takes dying out to self to wait on God that's what it does because we're time bound creatures and especially in this day and age with all the technology we have everything is now now now and God says my time my time my time that's the way that God works on these things amen the greatest thing we can ask for is the will of God that is the best thing that you can ever ask for and if you can sit there and wait on that then you'll learn real fast that's the way to go through life is in his perfect will amen otherwise we get into what permissive will and that's balam's way permissive will is not the way we want to walk we want to find his perfect will and stay there brother Bram continues and he says he gave Jesus Christ and Jesus gave it in his name with this assurance ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it he says it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the position the church as I said the book of Ephesians is the Book of Joshua and Joshua is placing the people where they belong now if they wouldn't stand still and he put Ephraim here and over on manasseh's land and this one would come back fussing and stewing how they ever going to get along when one is saying I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a Pentecostal I'm Oneness I'm tunist I'm thus so and so now we say that doesn't apply us well what about when we say well I'm brother I go to brother so- and so's Church we've got it all this man is the best in the business this is the greatest preacher in the message this one's that it's the same denominational attitude it's a body of Believers it's a fivefold Ministry and that means there's at least five ministers out there that have what we need because there's five roles you got brother Bram you got four others so that means there's got to be four god-ordained men out there at the very minimum but listen it's a bunch there's a bunch of out there most of them are just little nobodies and that's who God's using in these situations he says how are you going to do it how are you ever going to get along how are you going to ever come into this place of adoption how are you ever going to come into God's will he says stand still God is wanting to place his church the Sons and Daughters of God he says God let me live to live to see it is my prayer so close till I can just feel it with my hands almost look like it's right there he says that's what I've longed to see waiting for the time when they walk down the street and there lays a laying there from his mother wombs mother's womb and he says Silver and Gold Have I None he says oh we're waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God hallelujah when God will make himself known when they'll stop sickness they'll stop cancer and they'll stop diseases stand still don't run around don't chase the latest Doctrine don't chase the latest fad stand still and look at what has been proven look at what has been stable through all of this how many times I'm young in the message but I'm sure brother Jerald and brother Mark and brother Bob could probably point to things that went through you know you had the Thunders movement you had the two Souls movement you had the this movement and that movement and we got them today and the funny thing is the old-timers say that's already been through once and it didn't work there's nothing new Under the Sun but stand and sit on that perfect word don't get drawn by emotion don't get drawn by movements but stay with what has worked with what you've seen stick with people through their entire life that's why we have older people in this church that can show us the consistency of staying with the Simplicity of the gospel of Christ amen you know I was I was thinking his brother Jim was talking about this and you know he was talking about that that road and you know what this place of the will of God is a narrow road I had already been studying on this and as he was talking you know it struck me that that narrow road is a separated road because as he read the Scripture it says it it it's narrow and few there be that find it but wide is the way that leadth to destruction all the all the traffic's on the way to destruction but there's just one here and one there that you meet that's on that narrow road and why are they there it says they find it they're looking for it they're seeking it and the scripture says seek and you will find knock and it'll be open to you it's those people that are looking for the will of God and for the word of God for their day that's the ones that are going to find it cuz there's a deep that's calling to the deep inside of them that won't be satisfied on the wide easy roads amen it's not an easy road walking in the will of God it's not an easy road walking in the word of God but it works and it takes you to your destination Amen brother BR would say this he says you know the easy Road's not always the best road the best road is find the will of God and then travel it he says amen that's right find the will of God no matter how hard it is just raise up your hand and say I'll take the way with the Lord's despised few started in with Jesus now Lord I'm going through he's repeating that song you know Abraham got into trouble when he left what God told him to do it was a hard Road he left when there was a famine he left when there wasn't water he left when there was fighting and all he had to do was stay with what God told him to do and God would have taken care of him God blessed Abraham in a place where everybody else wasn't having the same BL blessings he prospered when nobody else was prospering and yet he walked away when circumstances got bad and every problem we have in the Middle East comes from Abraham trying to get out of God's will not trying to get out of will but actually getting out of it trying to make it happen himself trying to take care of himself it's not an easy road but it's a road that leads you to a promised destination amen God said walk around in the land I've given to you see what it's all about Abraham this is what I've given to you it's for your children stay there stay there until I give you the promise child and he dart out and then he come back in he dart out and get in trouble and then come back in stay with the path that God has shown you so we've read all this to set up the question what is God's will for us today and we're talking big picture God's will for us today is comeing to a place of adoption Amen to manifest the word Christ in our daytoday lives it's a day-by-day walk it's a day-by-day victory it's to overcome the age Rin it's to hold on to the word that we've been given hold fast to that which we've been given amen and to give God the preeminence in our lives but then within that we each have a role as Holy Ghost filled Believers and that's our day-to-day job it's it's the responsibility it's the authority we've been given in the body of Christ and your adopted position as we've talked about may be as a mother it may be as a wife it may be as a minister it may be as a song leader it may be as a help it may be to have one of the gifts of the Spirit in the local body it may be Outreach it may be inreach it may be Hospitality all all these things but in it there's a a leading that has to happen this is one thing that my mom taught me my mom is generous she's a giver and she taught me that you don't just give because there's a need you don't just do because you can but you're to be led in how you do it and when you do it and to whom you do it amen and I think the older ones here probably know that better than some of us younger ones we're still learning these things amen but how we spend our time our actions how we spend our money where we go the Ministries we sit under the Ministries we bring in who our friends are what relationships we have what we say what we don't say that's a dayby day overcoming and it's a day byday seeking of the will of God for our lives amen Paul would say this he says ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are Gods we can't do that in our own self the carnal thoughts the carnal nature that's here to find the will of God it will never match up with those but if we can seek and say Lord I know your way is the best way and we can daily put this aside and say Lord I want your will I want your way today and keep that in the front of our mind then that's when God can work with us amen why because we've learned to trust that his way is the best way for our lives amen David would say this in Psalms show me thy ways oh Lord teach me thy paths Lead Me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on thee do I wait all the day I wait on him half the struggle is the wait isn't it if you've ever sought God and had to wait you know that's the trial of your faith is the waiting period he says but I'll wait on the all day he says the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth it's a good path mercy and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant and his testimony you know I was thinking about that and I thought sometimes the truth hurts we think because it's God it's always going to be good in a lovey-dovey Feelgood way but we are talking about this at the supper table today that sometimes the mercy and the and the love of God and the truth of God is that he opens our eyes to our present condition amen how many times reading my Bible and devotions and I read something and I say oh my goodness Lord that's me that's my attitude that's the way I'm thinking come on now come on you can sit there and you when you read your Bible if all you can think about is somebody else in that scripture then you're reading your Bible wrong amen amen the we are changed by the washing of the water of the word me reading the word doesn't change somebody else it changes me and I've got a serious attitude problem if all I can think about is somebody else whenever I read my Bible this is supposed to be changing me it's supposed to be aligning me it's supposed to be bringing me into a reflection of Christ in my day-to-day life amen and so I say God forgive me amen that's there's a repentance that comes with reading this book because when I compare the carnality that I have with this it falls short so many times and so there's a daily repentance when I come in and read my Bible because I say Lord I don't see that right now in certain areas of my life don't get buried in that cuz Satan will do that to you but amen when we see that say Lord lift me up and let me stand a higher plane than I found to to date in my in my relationship with Christ amen David was all about finding the will of God and he was known for perfect leadership and it's because he went in and he didn't leave until he found the will of God and he would not move until he knew what God wanted him to do amen David wasn't just a a a battle Warrior he was a prayer Warrior and that's what made him a great warrior when it came to battles amen he didn't just wait on God to come to him he sought God sometimes we're waiting for God to come to us no let's seek him cuz when we seek him that's when we find him and when we're knocking that's when he opens up the door of his will amen why was David always in prayer because the situations that look so similar are often completely different the root issue the underlying problem the thing that's going on there is so different many times you run up against one person with a temper you can't treat them the same as the next one with a temper one of them might be hormones the next one might be family issues the next one might be Financial issues the next one might be just they cold and bitter because they haven't had time in the Lord's presence and you got to treat every single one of those people differently and that comes by prayer that comes by seeking and we see this in 2 Samuel when David's dealing with the Philistines David's anointed to kill Philistines Church there's no doubt we're anointed to overcome Satan's Dominion but how we do it comes by leadership and listen to this it says when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David King over Israel all the Philistines came up to seek David and David heard of it and went down to the hold the Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of reim and David inquired of the Lord saying shall I go up to the Philistines and wilt thou deliver them under mine hand see David's checking up David's saying God are you with me David had moments where God wasn't with them remember when he numbered the people when he's down in fisa and he's got to pretend to be he a crazy man to get away from that it's God's grace he got out but it wasn't God's will he was in when he did those things David's learned I got to check up yes I'm I'm anointed for my position but I've got to stay close to God and sayl are you with me in this we cannot presume say Lord are you with me it said' and the Lord said unto David go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand and David came to B peris them and David smote them there this was a straight up battle two armies head-to-head standard Warfare and he beats them and David said the Lord ha broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters like a dam burst he says it just destroy them blew them away in front of me he says therefore he called the name of that place Bel parison it says and there they left their images and David and his men burned them then the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of reim church it's the exact same enemy in the exact same place doing the exact same thing now we would say David go up you've been here before God's With You Go destroy them no David's a Son of God what does he do he says sons of God are led by the spirit of God God I'm going to check with you I'm not going to presume I'm not going to assume it's the same as last time amen it's easier to find God's will than to learn afterwards that you paid a price you didn't have to he says and when David inquired of the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up don't do it the way you did it before in other words you got to fight this battle differently he says but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees God tells them to set an ambush and hide in the mulberry trees he says and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a Goin In the tops of the mulberry trees that thou shalt bester thyself for then for then and only then shall God go out before thee to Smite the host of the Philistines David's got to wait for a sound of marching and stirring in the trees and then when he hears that then he's supposed to go out and Ambush them and God will God will give the enemy over to him in battle it says and David did so as the Lord had commanded him and he smot the Philistines from giba until Thou come to gazer see the first time he destroyed them there the next one he not only destroys them but he chases them right back into their own country same people same enemy same place different tactics different result a victory but a greater Victory why because he sought God's leadership amen we can't presume based on our experience that we know what to do every time amen it's that day toay checking up with God to ask for his provision to ask ask for his guidance to ask for his Direction his leadership ask for his attitude am me how hard is it every day my wife shared a story and I won't share it because I don't you know I didn't ask her permission beforehand but how hard is it sometimes to project that right attitude in a situation when you know you're going into potential conflict when you know that you're going to have a certain conversation say Lord help me to speak with your love and your attitude and bring your approach to this situation cuz with some people you have to be firm and stand your ground and with some people You' got to be soft and meek and then there's all sorts of a spectrum in between those things amen but like I said earlier when you make a Godly decision Satan's going to come after you with guns blazing and so you got to be prepared in the Lord for how you're going to defeat him because remember we wrestle not against flesh and blood this is spiritual warfare and we can't go at it the way our friends do it we can't go do it the way that people at work do we can't do it the way that a psychologist would you ever have somebody try psychology on you it just makes you more mad if you know what they're trying to do but when you can approach it the way that God knows to do it comes out right every time amen and you can walk away saying Lord I did your will otherwise what you don't have faith in where you're standing and you just get run Pillar To Post and they run you right out of the room we've got to find his will but look what Jesus key was we talked about this and we're going to settle down here for the last quarter of the service he says I can of my own self do nothing he said but as I hear I judge my judgment is just he says why because I seek not mine own will but the will of the Father which has sent me Jesus Faith was in knowing that he had found the father's will for each and every situation and he says I'm confident in what I'm saying I'm confident in my judgment I'm confident in my actions I'm confident in my reactions I'm confident in the things I do and say why because I took the time to seek and find God's will amen he didn't seek to inject himself into the situation I'm the Son of God I should just do this I no no no this was flesh and subjection to the spirit of God and it's no different than you and I it's flesh in subjection to the spirit of God we just have the sinful part that he didn't amen but he was seeking the will of God for him every day you know we Face tough situations and and if we let it happen we can get our backs up and we can get pushy and we can get prickly and we can get defensive and we can get run all over the place amen but if we can set ourselves aside and say God this is in your hands I'm your child I'm walking in your will day by day as best I know how and so my life is in your hands this circumstance this conversation whatever it is that we're seeking lord it's in your hands and stand there and just project his love every time amen what that gives us a supernatural confidence when you know that you're walking with him it ought to give us confidence that no matter what the situation is there's a victory to be won and there's a testimony to be given amen he doesn't bring us in to lose he brings us in to win but remember what we said before winning is not about you it's about the soul it's about what bringing that person into a place where they could potentially receive eternal life but you know the other thing I was thinking on this sometimes that tough situation is Temptation and the Temptation is to make ourselves something and I speak this as a minister maybe this evening there's that temptation to make ourselves spiritual to try and make something happen to to to make it look like we're a child of God to make it look like this because there's times I can say this as a minister I see situations and you want to go over and you just want to take care of the situation remember what brother BR would say he says I can't heal you if I could heal you I'd just go out and I'd heal everyone' because our human nature is to try and resolve situations but God sees all things and he has a purpose and a plan and he sees the root of the issue and sometimes the root of the issue is not the sickness it's not the depression it's not the lack of money but there's a spiritual issue that he's trying to produce in that person's he's trying to get rid of and he's trying to bring them to a place where they're closer to him and they can he can deliver them from that thing that's causing them those issues the issue sometimes is not sickness it's a heart issue it's a spirit issue been there done that still getting it done to me Church the issue is not that I need an answer to my prayer the answer is I need Deliverance first and then he'll give me what I have need of anden I'll pray for anyone anytime but it's like I said before my prayer may be a little different than what you were expecting because I've got to follow the leadership of God in those situations and until I do I can only pray with a certain level of faith and confidence I can commit you to him but there's a difference between committing you to him and speaking the word and that takes very very tight leadership amen you know sometimes the temptation as a believe as a minister is to get the people worked up to bring a message that'll just do something for the congregation to get those quiet new finlanders to finally shout and dance and run around now I'm not a dynamic preacher but here's the thing a message has to have substance not volume come on right it's not about how much I yell I was telling brother Mark the other day I feel like I'm yelling a lot more I'm speaking more and I don't know what it is because I used to be so relaxed behind the pulpit now it's it's not so relaxed you know but I'm not yelling for the sake of yelling I'm yelling because there's something in me that makes me yell amen but here's the thing if I preach a message that makes you feel good then what's going to happen tomorrow is Satan's going to preach you a message that makes you feel bad and he'll take the victory right out from under you amen but what we have to do is preach something that will actually do something for you and in you and that comes by inspired preaching of the the word of God Amen brother Bram dealt with this he says now you can imagine the responsibility to speak to a group that would lay on to every word you say and then you'll have to answer for what you told them at the day of judgment brother randam could say go out and wear a purple pants the rest of your life and there's people would do it CU he was their absolute they wouldn't go look at the word and say where is that they do whatever he said there's a an authority that comes with the ministry that we have to be so careful not to abuse absolutely because souls are hanging on it and when I start to use it for my benefit rather than yours it's satanic that's hard but it's true I'm here to serve above all things he says because through that little humble Ministry it gives people Faith to know that a human being cannot do these things he says it has to come from God therefore that they lay on to every word that you say so I never try to build something thinking or writing down script scriptures and notes that it would be something that would I that would make the people all elated he's saying I don't bring a message to work the people up he says see I try to pray and to think of something that would be constructive to you that would help you cuz remember what was his problem with Pentecost is whatever they get they blew out of their Smoke Stack during the service and when they walked out they had no Victory the rest of the week you need something to dwell on you need something to chew on you need something that's got some real protein in it not just the feeling of the word but you need the reality of the word amen I can't preach for reaction I need to preach for Revelation that's really what we're talking about amen we got to be so careful how we do that I can't focus on response how you talk how you might shout or stand up or Bellow amen or hallelujah or something that's not what we're looking for we're looking for a settled heart on the word of God that's what we need because that's what's going to hold you tomorrow when the feeling of your salvation when the when the joy of it walks away when Satan's knocking on your door with sickness or Temptation or torment or these things you need something that's been settled in your heart not something that's been settled in your emotions amen you know I was talking to a brother and he's one of the best known ministers and one of the greatest preachers in this message I do believe very popular and he said I've got to be careful how I preach because I know how to get the people worked up he says but that won't do the job I have to give them a solid foundation for their response because that's what's going to do the work is the solid foundation of the word of God he says and when they respond to the word by the Holy Spirit that's something that's going to hold them throughout the week I had so much respect for him admitting that he could do it and then saying and I've got to guard against it amen because why we're preaching for response rather than revelation we can't do it you know I was I've read through the the scriptures and we're looking to when we see the preaching of the word what's it supposed to do Faith cometh by hearing we're trying to instill faith in the people of God that's the purpose I come in here every service and preach is to put faith in your heart to inspire the word to your life so that you'll take it but you know you look at all sorts of preachers in the Bible and what I love is we have all sorts of them with Moses Moses stuttered Moses needed somebody else to preach for him that's how bad a preacher he was and yet the word of God was behind him and God he he he was the the the the blueprint for Jesus Christ a prophet like unto Moses and yet he stuttered then you go to Jonah the disobedient Prophet but such power in his ministry that he brought an entire city to repentance then you go over to to to Peter and John ignorant and unlearned their hints and their ains amen a great six education from k a kid from Kentucky and yet what the power of God was behind them in everything they said and did you look at Jesus the greatest anointing ever on a man in this earth and he sat down and precious words proceeded out of his mouth then you look at Paul I just read this in in in the Bible this morning and he said my words are weighty and Powerful Paul was a tremendous writer he could have been a copywriter and then he says but my delivery my preaching and my appearance in person is weak and contemptible Paul wasn't a good preacher in terms of his delivery he was weak and contemptible then you have Steven powerful convicting Fearless to the point that he would preach all the way to his dying breath you have a whole spectrum of deliveries but what's the commonality the spirit of God is behind that man that's what makes the difference I'd love to be Mr Dynamic I truly would but that's never going to do the job it's finding the will of God for the people and him coming behind it and vindicating it that's going to do the job amen nothing about me amen the resting place has to be the word of God you can't rest even on my experience you got to rest on your own experience and then what God's done in your life he says this okay he says without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God Must Believe first that he is and you do that by experience that you've tasted and seen that the Lord is good that you've taken him at his word and you see that he responds to it and he and he fulfills it he says we must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him in other words he makes it worth your while to seek him out it's better to seek him than it is to not seek him what you get when you seek Him is better than what you get if you don't seek him see faith has to have a resting place brother brandham said it has to have an absolute it has to have a foundation and the foundation is not the gift of men it's not the the delivery of the ministry it's it's not the experience of those men but it's solidly on that word of God that when they preach that word in Simplicity it anchors in your heart and deep calls to the deep and the Holy Spirit anoints it and all of a sudden you've got faith to move in your life brother B puts it this way he says the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing he says it doesn't lay in man to do these things so don't try and do it in yourself he says it's saying God Alone can do it and not what men does oh you can be mentally worked up you can be in Emotion but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a faith that was once delivered to the saints that settled something no matter how you felt or what sensation you have you have any or have none it's settled on God's Eternal Word he says that's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now catch this he says not that that brother this brother prayed for me and this one cast The Devil out and this done that and the other he says mental emotions can do that he says but when the real genuine faith that God spoke the truth it's settled in the person's heart it's Eternal feeling has nothing to do with it no more God said so then that faith is stabled and no matter what takes place how you feel whether you get sick or whether you do or not that has nothing to do with it he says it's that faith that was once delivered to the saints that they believe that's what we're looking for that's what the ministry is looking for is a people that will rest on the word of God and the word of God Alone Brothers let me talk to you we've got to be men of God we've got to be led by the spirit first and foremost amen here's the here's the thing we can't become spiritual when the moment comes we need a daily experience in the presence of God we need to know where we're standing remember what brother Bram said about David I read the quote a couple Services ago he said David was prayed up when the situation arose David didn't have to go make it right David didn't have to check him with God he knew his anointing he knew he was called and he stepped into the breach and he took care of the situation we can't get spiritual when sickness hits we need to be spiritual before it hits so we know what to do with it when the Tormentor comes when he starts to try and put his claws and his hooks into somebody in our family when he's knocking on the door we've got to open that door with a heart of faith that says you have no right here out you go we cannot act spiritual we have to be spiritual it has to be a day-by-day experience why because we've got to be able to say I'm in his will and I'm in his presence therefore I know he's got my back why because I put him in preeminence in my life I put him at the Forefront therefore I know he's with me David will put this this way wherewith all shall a young man cleanse his way in other words how can he be right with God how can he walk pure before God David says by taking heed thereto according to Thy Word with my whole heart have I sought thee we're talking about how do I find the will of God in my life how do I know I'm in the will of God he says with my whole heart have I sought thee oh let me not Wander from thy Commandments Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee Samson such a a sad character and I've just been reading in judges and I just finished up with Samson and Samson had that moral failure of being caught up in women but what a man he was what a man he was what a judge he was and for 20 years he judged Israel Faithfully he got caught up in these little things and it's because he didn't have a whole heart of seeking God he let himself get LED away brother Braham says Samson had stood in that place one time himself and he knew the power of God but now he had been shaven of those privileges he was just as big as he ever was but God wasn't there he says we've got a lot of that today it's too bad we have it but we have it but it doesn't bring back the spirit of God he says now the thing of it is the people are not willing to pay the price to get back to that am You' got to have it to know you've never that you've lost it sometimes we've lost it and we aren't willing to pay the price to get back to where we stood before and continue on with God he says I believe that God just Remains the Same as he ever was but the thing of it is the people have got so wound up into the world and the world and them till they got just God enough just religion to make them miserable he says not enough to really turn loose to God and give your whole heart unto him he says but enough yeah I go to church certainly I enjoy good singing and clapping hands yeah I love that see what a church experience but not a god experience he says they're not willing to pay the price and put everything they've got into it he says you got to stay right with the word and believe it not just slip over here this way and that way and say I'll Peck and try what tentative half in half out not committed not uncommitted like a buffet I'll take a little bit a little but you won't sit down and just eat I'll try it see if I like it see if it works he says you don't do that no no you've got to come with a whole heart it's your word Lord I believe it he says God will make it it'll go to work right there we're going to get into this in more detail on Sunday Lord willing but how do you find God's will for your life seek it seek it with your whole heart give it everything you got amen don't seek to confirm yourself that's the greatest danger of a of a of a Believer is that you're trying to confirm rather than get his will see we we seek permission rather than submission that's really what it is we're not yielding oursel we're saying Lord am I right rather than saying Lord what is your will because sometimes we haven't even thought of what we need to do and we're so busy getting confirmation that we can't hear the direction that he's looking for amen don't seek permission seek submission and how do you do that read your Bible every day pray every day stay in his presence stay in his word and Things become strangely clear clear when you start reading your Bible and the more you read the more you understand and if you can take the word and you can place it clearly into your situation then you don't have to wait around that's the joy of having an absolute is that you can place it if you can place your situation perfectly into it then you don't have to wait around you can say thus sayeth the Lord because thus sayeth the Lord you've got it right there you know it's so easy to just say well I had my devotions and I prayed today and that's it no we've got to take it we've got to take what we've read we've got to take what we've heard we've got to stay in a place of prayer until he comes and he meets us and that takes time and what is the last thing that we have these days time quiet time it is so hard it is so hard to get that quiet time I force myself to get it in the mornings meaning I force people to stay away I go down in the mornings I've got my earplugs to put in that do almost nothing to keep the sound of the boys fighting above my head regularly but I do everything I can to get that quiet time but sometimes it means we may need to just walk off somewhere and just spend some time with God turn the music off in the car spend some time with God Amen not just a token prayer so we can say I prayed about it not just a token yeah yeah I asked the Lord about it and I feel this is his will no seek Him truly seek him and say Lord I want your will I want your way and not let go until we get it amen as we close brother says you want to belong to heaven in heaven he says that's where your affections ought to be on things above Jesus said set your affections on things above not on the things of the earth they're going to fail stay with God stay with realities God is a god of reality he has always been in all ages and any time that man ever walked with God God became a reality that performed signs and wonders and miracles with his people he says it's God's purpose to do so surrender all amen God bless you let's Stand Together am man the nice thing about having lots of notes is you can break it up so as not to tire out the people this is the way the Lord's leading me on some of these things and I was telling someone before service we're going to do some more services like this on how do I this and how do I that and and and some of the rubber meets the road and Lord willing on Sunday we'll get into this about okay brother John you told us he wants to bring us to a place of spiritual maturity he wants to bring us to a place of adoption but how do I actually do it and then how do I know when I found it and that's a that's a challenge I know for I think it's a challenge for all of us but especially for our young people is how do I know what God's will is for my life because we got all sorts of different personalities we've got boys we've got girls we've got all sorts of families and and different things and histories and how do I know what's God's will for my life do I follow in Mom's footsteps do I follow in Dad's footsteps do I follow in this one or that one Lord what is your will for my life and to be able to go to him and find confidence in the answer that he gives one to get an answer and then two to have confidence in it because if we lack confidence then Satan's got a he's got access to us that's the in the armor that's the the thing that puts a hole and and allows him to get through amen so I want to do this with the church over the next couple services and certainly over the next couple of months as we start to wrap up this adoption Series so maybe in in in July or August we'll start to do this but to to come to a place where we we say how do I do this what does this walk look like what does it look like day by day and and what do I do and how do I feed my relationship with God and how do I know I've got the Holy Ghost how do I get the Holy Ghost how do I know what it's going to do in my life all these sorts of things so I ask you to keep in prayer as we go into some of these things and yes we'll do some doctrinal teaching and these things but I really want to get down to where we live because what good is a God that isn't in our day-to-day lives anden he wants to be he's seeking to be in our day-to-day lives the greatest thing that God could do is come down into our life on a daily basis to know that he's with us to know that he's leading us to know that he's guiding us to know you've been sealed to know that you're full of the Holy Ghost and you're you're settled and you're sealed to your Eternal Destin ination with him what a wonderful place to walk in confidence every single day to know that he hears your prayer and that you're walking in his will day by day amen so you keep that in prayer and if you've got questions by all means send it out send me an email or something and say brother John I've always wondered about this and could you do that and maybe it's something quick and easy I can just send you an answer but if it's a bigger one then I'm more than willing to take a service and do that because I know it would benefit you know brother Mark did a lot of teaching in Sunday school and he covered a lot of things and brother Gerald was quite a teacher in his early days as as well and so I know the benefit of of a solid bible-based teaching where you can go to your your Bible and you can say I know what I believe and I know why I believe it amen so let's keep that in prayer over the coming weeks and months certainly that the Lord would lead me and guide me in those things but you take your need you take your need and say God would you just answer it show me as I'm reading the Bible it doesn't have to come from this Pulpit amen God wants a personal relationship with each and every person in this church and that comes by reading his word because he identifies himself in and through his word amen and when you start to lay hold of that you'll start to find that other things come into place as well amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're hungry people Lord we're hungry for your presence Lord we're hungry for your touch Lord we're hungry for your promises each one and so Lord I'm asking Lord as we preach on this Lord not just today Lord but as we preached it Lord but on Sunday and as we move forward Lord that you would just move in your people's midst Lord you see the needs you see the hearts Lord you see the lives you see the questions Lord and I pray that your spirit would just move to discern these things Lord it would answer questions that it would settle doubts Lord that it would cast out fears Lord that your love would fill every Poe and every Lord portion of our being each one Heavenly Father Lord I pray that we'd be of people that seeks your will Lord and in our seeking Lord we'd have the promise that we would find it Lord that if we call on your name that you'd answer Lord and if we knock that you'd open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing Lord that we can't contain Lord I pray you bless your people this night Lord be with us throughout the rest of the week Lord I pray your ministering Grace to each heart and soul that's here in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen show me your way 11:57 show me your way that I may walk with you show me your way I put my hope in you for the my heart is to love you more to live with the touch of your hand stronger each
