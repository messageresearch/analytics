[38:04] amen amen amen
[38:07] praise the lord
[38:08] again i trust him we've turned our eyes
[38:10] upon him
[38:11] amen is not this doctrine or that
[38:13] doctrine it's christ
[38:15] amen because he's the center of it all
[38:17] right by the grace of god it says again
[38:20] a certain brethren want this certain
[38:22] look for this ministry that ministry
[38:24] and i said brother i said the ministry
[38:26] we're looking for him and he's the one
[38:27] that's in us and we're in him and he's
[38:29] in us
[38:30] amen he said i'll pray the father you'll
[38:32] send you another comforter
[38:34] another comforter
[38:36] ah he said that oh yeah that proves the
[38:38] trinity he said just three persons he
[38:40] said god's gonna send another comforter
[38:43] and uh i said brother you'd better go on
[38:45] that another four or five verses he said
[38:47] i'll not leave you comfortless i'll come
[38:49] to you amen
[38:51] so i said who said that i said jesus
[38:52] said it
[38:54] amen so brother we just need the
[38:56] revelation we need the the love of god
[38:58] we need the the presence of our lord
[39:00] jesus christ in us
[39:02] with us and around us amen so god be
[39:05] with us brother and especially we need
[39:08] it in these last days
[39:10] considering all that's going on in the
[39:12] world and all that's going on around the
[39:14] world brother there's nothing normal
[39:16] anymore everything is insane
[39:19] insanity has taken over the world and
[39:21] that is it is that's right but the
[39:24] problem of god warned us that the world
[39:26] was going to go insane well you and i
[39:28] have witnessed it and we are witnessing
[39:30] it we are living in that kind of a world
[39:33] and again
[39:34] like i said if the old brothers and
[39:36] sisters were to come back my and
[39:38] consider all that's going on in the
[39:40] world all that's going on around the
[39:41] world
[39:42] they would
[39:43] where are we
[39:45] they were thinking oh
[39:46] we better get out of here amen this is a
[39:48] crazy place we've come back to amen they
[39:51] would oh yes most definitely because
[39:53] they look out and i trust by grace
[39:55] brother that that we see what they would
[39:57] see
[39:58] and oh yeah and they would consider it
[40:01] and understand it to be insane
[40:03] the way the people are acting the way
[40:05] they talk and you know whether it's
[40:06] religion whether it's politics no matter
[40:08] what it is it's not normal anymore no
[40:11] one time people they would think normal
[40:13] they would act normal they would talk
[40:15] normal but not anymore ain't no
[40:17] definitely not because there's another
[40:19] spirit upon them and as i've already
[40:21] ministered a number of times concerning
[40:23] the god
[40:24] of this evil age
[40:26] amen and it is the devil oh yeah the
[40:29] problem of god said that he's the god of
[40:31] this evil age brother i trust he's not
[40:34] your god he's not influencing you he's
[40:36] not controlling your thoughts no no not
[40:39] by any means but i trust by the grace of
[40:42] god that you do have the revelation so
[40:44] that you recognize the devil when he's
[40:46] moving
[40:47] you know what is god and you know what
[40:49] is the devil be on your guard because
[40:51] it's going to be so close it would
[40:53] deceive the very elect if possible so
[40:56] the grace of god that we're not going to
[40:58] be deceived by what the devil is going
[41:00] to do to challenge our faith and
[41:03] understand this too and brother it's not
[41:05] out there just outside the message he's
[41:07] right he's in the message as i said oh
[41:09] there's a lot of so-called believers or
[41:11] not in the message but i tell you this
[41:12] the devil's in it
[41:14] oh yeah but the message is not in him
[41:17] not by any means but he knows the word
[41:19] he knows the message he knows what god
[41:21] has done he knows what god is doing and
[41:23] he knows what god will do but he's there
[41:26] to challenge our faith he's there to get
[41:28] us to doubt
[41:29] amen in some regards to doubt they doubt
[41:32] doubt certain things that god has done
[41:35] and maybe to doubt what god's doing and
[41:38] definitely confuse you when it comes to
[41:40] what god will do oh brother
[41:43] i pray the grace of god that we're going
[41:45] to have that simple holy ghost faith
[41:48] that believes god
[41:50] amen that holy ghost faith that believes
[41:53] the word amen what god has done and what
[41:56] god doing amen and what he's doing is to
[42:00] get us ready for what he's going to do
[42:02] amen to move us on
[42:04] grace to have that faith
[42:06] brother if there's anything god did in
[42:08] this hour through the ministry of a
[42:10] prophet and the opening of the word is
[42:12] to give us the faith that pleases him
[42:14] not only please him yeah but it's for
[42:17] you and me it's the faith that we need
[42:20] oh yeah
[42:21] and again there's not all believers got
[42:22] that faith that they need amen oh yeah
[42:25] they got the faith of what god has done
[42:27] but they don't have the revelation what
[42:29] god's doing and oh yeah but he'll do
[42:32] this and he'll do that but he's already
[42:34] doing it
[42:35] and they're missing that oh yeah and
[42:37] again that's why the problem of god
[42:39] warned us to be on our toes he said
[42:41] because one of these days you'll wonder
[42:43] oh where's the rapture it already
[42:45] happened he said you didn't know it oh
[42:47] yeah so grace that brother getting into
[42:49] the word preaching the word ministering
[42:51] the word hearing the word amen we're
[42:54] getting more and more into the
[42:55] revelation of what god is doing amen oh
[42:59] what do we will do well well brother
[43:01] what he's doing leads into what he will
[43:02] do amen amen and then that gets that
[43:05] comes back to oh that's what he's doing
[43:07] yeah praise the lord we're believing by
[43:10] the grace of god
[43:11] amen
[43:12] that we're not going to miss
[43:14] what's in the future
[43:16] amen when we're moving into it we're
[43:18] walking into it amen brother tomorrow is
[43:21] the future within the next hour next
[43:23] second is the future amen but are we
[43:26] still in the will of god in the future
[43:29] amen within the next minute within the
[43:31] next hour is your thoughts motives and
[43:33] objectives all audrey's will is
[43:35] according to his will and his leadership
[43:38] in your life amen brother so that we can
[43:41] truly absolutely completely say
[43:44] is not me that lives
[43:46] is christ living in me is that true that
[43:49] the life you live today that the life
[43:51] you're living tonight is that the life
[43:53] you live after this service and tomorrow
[43:55] oh yeah you go out and it's christ in
[43:58] flesh again amen the word made flesh in
[44:02] you and in me amen and i'll tell you if
[44:04] it is you're going to reflect jesus
[44:06] you're we're going to reflect christ
[44:08] you're going to reflect what god yes
[44:10] what he's done but you're going to
[44:11] reflect what he's doing and that's and
[44:13] brother that's that's moving us into
[44:15] what he will do
[44:16] but he's given us the faith to recognize
[44:18] it as we keep
[44:20] marching on
[44:21] so grace to help us lord brother and i
[44:23] tell you we're being challenged and many
[44:25] believers being challenged brother so
[44:27] that the word is not faith the word
[44:29] might be knowledge but not faith
[44:32] and the proud of god understood that now
[44:34] i am warning the people over and over
[44:36] and over because he said you're in the
[44:38] message but he said the message is not
[44:40] in you
[44:41] oh yeah he knew that and brother sister
[44:44] i i know that even back then
[44:47] but over 60 years ago that when the
[44:49] prophet was preaching even in his own
[44:51] church they didn't all believe
[44:53] because as i said if they believed them
[44:55] to be a prophet if they believed that he
[44:57] had thus saved the lord why in the world
[44:59] would they leave the church his church
[45:01] and go to another one because he
[45:02] preached church order
[45:05] something wrong somewhere
[45:07] amen but brother they separated from
[45:08] jesus when he when he endeavored to set
[45:10] this in order that in order amen
[45:13] according to the word and according to
[45:15] what god was doing in that day 2 000
[45:18] years ago amen jesus was there and and
[45:22] he would drop the hint as to what's
[45:23] going on and what will happen what's
[45:25] going on what will happen but the
[45:27] disciples they tried to stop it no no no
[45:29] no no we don't want that to happen even
[45:32] jesus going down to jerusalem and he
[45:34] said they were going to be
[45:35] going to be deceived or betrayed and he
[45:38] would be crucified and so on no no no
[45:40] they definitely didn't want that to
[45:42] happen no
[45:44] but they never had the revelation that
[45:46] they needed it
[45:48] yeah and he was the only one that could
[45:49] lay down his life pick it up again
[45:51] amen to redeem you and me
[45:53] and to give us the blessed hope take us
[45:56] back home
[45:56] amen by grace brother he was pointing it
[46:00] out pointed it out amen all through the
[46:02] prophets then he came the god prophet
[46:05] praise the lord then he moved on in the
[46:06] church through the baptism of the holy
[46:08] ghost amen not just in this one this one
[46:11] but he's in the bride
[46:12] he's in every member of the bride
[46:14] of the lord jesus christ amen keeping us
[46:17] what in the words with the word
[46:19] to what for to mature us to rapturing
[46:23] faith
[46:24] oh i believe god for this i believe god
[46:26] did this i believe god's doing this yeah
[46:28] but what what else is there in the
[46:30] scripture
[46:31] what else is there in the word that oh
[46:34] we're supposed to oh i believe this it's
[46:36] all past tense he did this he did that
[46:38] but what's he doing
[46:40] do you have you had the revelation of
[46:42] the present tense
[46:43] amen
[46:45] amen of what he is now doing
[46:49] grace brother that we're going to be
[46:51] under the ministry that's focusing on
[46:53] what god's doing
[46:54] amen thank god for what he did but focus
[46:57] on now what he's doing in you
[46:59] what he's doing in may amen what's he
[47:02] doing in the bride and brother
[47:04] is our lives evidence
[47:07] that what he's doing oh yes that's me
[47:09] he's doing it in me i know lord this is
[47:11] what you're doing
[47:12] so there's too many believers as i said
[47:14] they know what he did they know what he
[47:16] will do but they ignore that he's trying
[47:18] to he's trying to do it now in you and
[47:20] me
[47:21] amen surrender brother sister to him
[47:24] amen brother let's not live for
[47:26] ourselves or the foolishness of this
[47:28] world let's live for jesus
[47:31] amen and you're living for jesus you
[47:33] want you're going to live for what he
[47:34] wants to do
[47:36] and what he's doing and if there's
[47:38] anything that he's doing in this hour
[47:40] this late hour
[47:43] concerning all that's going on in the
[47:44] world brother there's a few and it's
[47:47] going to be very few
[47:48] because he said it's going to be so
[47:50] deceiving to deceive the very left if
[47:52] possible
[47:53] amazing
[47:55] amazing be on your guard stay with the
[47:57] word amen god in simplicity
[48:01] amen and let's recognize
[48:04] again
[48:06] the ministry that god wants to put us
[48:07] under
[48:08] whether it's the someone in the fightful
[48:10] ministry you know the prophetic ministry
[48:12] just make sure we're under
[48:14] the influence of our lord jesus christ
[48:17] amen to god be the glory
[48:20] and again i shared this with you a
[48:22] number of times quite a while ago
[48:26] but
[48:26] it's a
[48:28] it says it's a pastor's shirt search
[48:30] committee
[48:32] amen report amen and again it goes
[48:35] through the scriptures
[48:37] amen looking for the correct pastor
[48:39] looking for the correct ministry
[48:41] in the word of god
[48:43] but he said these
[48:45] oh these are the the ones that they
[48:47] thought about
[48:48] and they maybe they should be this one
[48:51] that one but then this is the excuse
[48:53] that a lot of people feel
[48:54] that this this brother has and that
[48:56] brother has this prophet god and so on
[48:59] yeah
[49:00] and this brother said oh
[49:02] what what if we chose noah as our pastor
[49:05] oh
[49:07] and he said no
[49:08] why not
[49:09] he said well
[49:10] could you consider noah
[49:12] this says he preached for 120 years and
[49:14] had no converts
[49:16] yeah they want they want you to preach
[49:19] in such ways to increase the sizing to
[49:21] church
[49:22] no no brother brother branham preached
[49:24] in such a way that his church didn't
[49:25] increase the numbers decreased oh yes
[49:28] definitely because you want you're
[49:30] laying in the word laying in the word
[49:31] amen
[49:32] not compromising well they said we'll
[49:34] take moses as our pastor no no he said
[49:38] no that we don't want a pastor like that
[49:40] for sure because he said moses stutters
[49:43] and he did well that's why god sent
[49:46] joshua with him because moses said lord
[49:48] i can't go and preach i can't do this he
[49:50] said i said i stutter i do this well he
[49:52] said i'll send joshua that's what joshua
[49:54] with him i believe he was and he said he
[49:56] oh he stutters and his former
[49:58] congregation says he loses his temper
[50:00] over trivial things
[50:02] yeah
[50:03] amen and then they said abraham oh he
[50:06] took off to egypt during the hard times
[50:09] and we heard that he got into trouble
[50:11] with the authorities and then he tried
[50:13] to lie his way out
[50:15] he told a lie concerning his wife he
[50:18] yeah he left them with their impression
[50:19] this impression they said oh yeah she's
[50:21] this she says no he said she's this amen
[50:24] it wasn't to a certain extent it was the
[50:26] truth but he was denying
[50:28] that she was also his way
[50:30] yeah
[50:31] so what about david he is an
[50:33] unacceptable moral character he might
[50:36] have been considered for the ministry of
[50:38] music and he not fallen
[50:40] now
[50:41] oh well let's choose solomon
[50:43] well he has a reputation for wisdom but
[50:46] he fails to practice what he preaches
[50:49] amen god help us
[50:52] amen
[50:53] well what if we choose elijah
[50:55] uh no they wouldn't have elijah as their
[50:58] pastor because he proved to be
[51:00] inconsistent and is known
[51:02] to fold under pressure
[51:05] oh yeah
[51:06] he put him under pressure and he humbled
[51:08] down
[51:10] well what about having oseah as our
[51:12] pastor well his family life is in a
[51:14] shambles he's divorced and remarried to
[51:17] a prostitute well
[51:20] somewhere he was following god's
[51:21] leadership
[51:22] amen
[51:24] but man looks at the natural
[51:26] god help us
[51:28] and again there is john and he said he
[51:30] says he is a baptist but he lacks tack
[51:33] and dresses like a and he said
[51:35] would not feel comfortable at a church
[51:38] at a church potluck supper
[51:40] john wasn't into those things
[51:42] he was just out in the wilderness in
[51:44] eating this and eating that amen nature
[51:47] but he wouldn't get into this and get
[51:48] into that no they didn't want him as
[51:50] pastor
[51:52] what about paul or peter
[51:54] they said well peter had a bad temper
[51:56] and he was urged to have even denied
[51:59] christ publicly oh yeah peter was with
[52:02] him and tried to stop jesus from doing
[52:03] this don't do this don't do this yeah
[52:06] brother let god do what he wants to do
[52:08] amen
[52:10] you need you need that kind of a
[52:11] ministry by the grace of god
[52:14] well paul
[52:16] we found him to lack tech and he is too
[52:19] harsh and his appearance is contemptible
[52:22] and he preaches far too long
[52:24] i must be related to paul
[52:26] amen we're brothers
[52:28] by the grace of god
[52:29] amen but they wouldn't have paul because
[52:32] of this
[52:33] no
[52:34] but timothy well he has potential but
[52:37] he's too much young for the position
[52:40] well what's god's choice
[52:42] and again there's jesus and it says he
[52:45] tends to offend church members with his
[52:47] preaching
[52:48] especially bible scholars
[52:51] and he is also too controversial
[52:54] and he even offended the search
[52:55] committee with his pointed questions
[52:58] yeah they didn't believe jesus
[53:01] god help us i mean say you wouldn't have
[53:04] jesus as your pastor
[53:05] they wouldn't have him as their pastor
[53:07] back 2000 years ago
[53:09] no
[53:10] grace of god
[53:13] well they said there's a final choice
[53:17] if you don't want the others would you
[53:18] choose this one
[53:20] and who's that
[53:22] judas
[53:24] judas oh yes they said judas he's very
[53:28] practical
[53:29] amen
[53:30] and he is very cooperative and he's good
[53:33] with money
[53:35] yeah
[53:36] brother
[53:37] good with money
[53:39] all god helped us in these last days
[53:41] amen
[53:42] and it says he cares for the poor and he
[53:44] dresses well
[53:46] yeah
[53:47] they thought he was a good pastor
[53:49] and it says we all agreed that he is
[53:51] just the man we are looking for
[53:54] to fulfill the vacancy of our senior
[53:57] pastor
[53:58] amen god help us that we're going to
[54:00] have holy ghost leadership
[54:02] amen not intellectual leadership amen
[54:05] not emotional leadership but spiritual
[54:08] leadership so the grace of god be with
[54:10] us brother sister lord bless you amen
[54:12] let's stand and turn to saint matthew's
[54:14] gospel chapter 16.
[54:18] god bless us
[54:20] amen
[54:22] i thought the building be full tonight
[54:23] considering all the cars in the driveway
[54:26] amen because the driveway is full
[54:28] so uh we pray the grace of god to those
[54:31] with us and we pray the grace of god to
[54:33] those online
[54:34] amen
[54:36] and i understand too that they're online
[54:38] it's not only through around
[54:39] newfoundland but it's in other parts of
[54:41] the world that we have email and add
[54:45] emails
[54:46] that where they have indicated that they
[54:49] are online with us amen even in africa
[54:53] so we pray the grace of god to bless the
[54:55] saints around the world
[54:58] and also to ask you to keep sister betty
[55:00] in prayer
[55:01] uh because of her situation and she is
[55:05] hopefully
[55:06] recovering little by little and she's
[55:09] hoping that it's not the cobit 19 issue
[55:11] but she she does experience what we
[55:14] refer to as flu-like symptoms and so on
[55:18] and uh and she's also
[55:21] experiencing whatever it is in her lungs
[55:23] and she is coughing it up so we pray the
[55:26] grace of god to be with her
[55:28] amen
[55:29] and also to be with our brother vicer in
[55:31] india and he's there now for a few days
[55:34] so but i understand he'll be there for
[55:36] at least 29 days so god bless brother
[55:39] visual and his testimony
[55:41] by the grace of god
[55:44] amen so in matthew chapter 16 and
[55:47] beginning to read at verse 13.
[55:51] when jesus came into the coast of
[55:53] caesarea philippi
[55:55] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[55:58] men say that i the son of man am
[56:02] and they said some say that thou art
[56:05] john the baptist
[56:06] some elias and others jeremiah
[56:10] or one of the prophets
[56:12] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[56:16] that i am
[56:17] and simon peter answered and said thou
[56:20] art the christ
[56:21] the son of the living god
[56:25] amen what revelation do we have of
[56:27] christ today grace
[56:31] and jesus answered and said unto him
[56:33] blessed art thou simon barjona
[56:36] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[56:38] unto thee
[56:39] but my father which is in heaven
[56:42] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[56:46] and upon this rock
[56:48] i will build my church
[56:51] and the gates of hell
[56:53] shall not prevail against it
[56:56] it is the rock of the revelation of our
[56:58] lord jesus christ
[57:00] amen
[57:02] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[57:05] the kingdom of heaven
[57:07] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[57:10] shall be bound in heaven
[57:12] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[57:15] shall be loosed in heaven amen so be
[57:18] take
[57:19] take care of your witness to the world
[57:23] of what you do what you allow what you
[57:25] don't allow amen let's make sure it's
[57:27] the word and we're giving the glory to
[57:30] jesus
[57:31] amen
[57:32] verse 20 then charged he his disciples
[57:36] that they should tell no man that he was
[57:38] jesus the christ
[57:40] amazing
[57:42] amen brother again even with the
[57:44] revelation of the word for this hour the
[57:46] message for this hour brother let's keep
[57:48] it within the ranks of the right
[57:51] amen and you most certainly would only
[57:53] give witness as god would lead you
[57:56] amen
[57:58] let's not cast our pearls before swine
[58:00] amen
[58:03] so verse 21 from that time forth began
[58:06] jesus to show unto his disciples how
[58:08] that he must go unto jerusalem and
[58:12] suffer many things of the elders and
[58:14] chief priests and scribes and be killed
[58:18] and be raised again the third day
[58:20] but then peter took him and began to
[58:23] rebuke him
[58:25] that's right
[58:27] and there are believers that take him
[58:29] and through the ministry and rebuking
[58:31] the ministry not realizing rebuking
[58:33] jesus
[58:34] be careful amen
[58:39] and it says he rebuked him saying be it
[58:42] far from the lord this shall not be unto
[58:45] thee
[58:47] but he turned and said unto peter get
[58:49] thee behind me satan
[58:51] amazing
[58:54] amen
[58:55] for thou art an offense unto me
[58:58] for thou savrus not the things that be
[59:00] of god
[59:01] but those that be of men
[59:04] amen
[59:06] oh he was looking at things through
[59:07] natural eyes
[59:09] nature of human but not holy ghost
[59:11] nature
[59:13] and then said jesus unto his disciples
[59:15] if any man will come after me
[59:19] amen
[59:20] let him deny himself
[59:24] so are we denying ourselves amen our
[59:27] personal interests and our personal
[59:29] nature
[59:30] amen let us deny what it's influencing
[59:33] us to do amen so we're under jesus
[59:36] nature
[59:37] if any man will come after me let him
[59:39] deny himself
[59:42] amen and take up his cross
[59:45] and follow me
[59:47] amen
[59:49] for whosoever will save his life shall
[59:52] lose it
[59:53] and whosoever will lose his life for my
[59:56] sake
[59:57] shall find it
[59:58] amen god bless his word you may be
[1:00:00] seated
[1:00:04] so the lord willing i want to try to
[1:00:06] bring some of these thoughts to a
[1:00:07] conclusion
[1:00:08] concerning end time evangelism
[1:00:11] because the prophet of god ministered on
[1:00:13] it in 1962
[1:00:16] a man 59 years ago
[1:00:19] and it was in the month of june
[1:00:22] and brother he felt bled of the lord to
[1:00:24] minister on the subject concerning
[1:00:27] end-time evangelism because there was a
[1:00:29] generation that never had the revelation
[1:00:32] truly of what god was doing amen what
[1:00:36] was god doing through the evangelists
[1:00:38] what was god doing through oral roberts
[1:00:40] what was god doing through billy graham
[1:00:42] and what was god doing through william
[1:00:44] branham amen there are
[1:00:47] many many many that were that identified
[1:00:50] with william branham back in those days
[1:00:52] and in those years and brother they look
[1:00:55] back even now
[1:00:56] and they are absolutely amazed when they
[1:00:59] consider the ministry of william branham
[1:01:02] the signs and the wonders
[1:01:04] and they even included it in the in an
[1:01:06] internet
[1:01:07] link
[1:01:08] concerning william branham
[1:01:10] and they were expressing the thoughts
[1:01:12] that concerning what he did was
[1:01:15] tremendous what he did was like the
[1:01:17] ministry of jesus that when jesus was
[1:01:19] here 2000 years ago and he went forth
[1:01:22] performing these signs
[1:01:24] amen and just think two thousand years
[1:01:26] later that he went forth in the ministry
[1:01:28] of a prophet doing the same thing amen
[1:01:32] ministering the same signs and wonders
[1:01:35] to the extent that many a religious
[1:01:37] person even in this day was
[1:01:39] acknowledging yes yes we can't deny but
[1:01:42] it's god but they said ow do we how do
[1:01:45] we reconcile the the the teachings of
[1:01:47] william branham with you
[1:01:49] well when it comes to the yo no the
[1:01:51] signs and the wonders with his teaching
[1:01:54] is that his teaching we know is
[1:01:56] absolutely the truth but it signs and
[1:01:58] wonders where rather it is god because
[1:02:00] god said he would do this he would do
[1:02:02] this he would do that but it says when
[1:02:04] it comes to william random's teaching
[1:02:06] how do we reconcile the teaching versus
[1:02:08] the signs amen but you and i recognize
[1:02:11] it as what god did the signs was there
[1:02:13] to get our attention amen because the
[1:02:16] proud of god in the cave
[1:02:18] he was said now this is you're going to
[1:02:20] have this sign you're going to have that
[1:02:21] sign and it says but he said get the
[1:02:23] people to believe amen and it wasn't
[1:02:26] just to believe the sign it was to
[1:02:28] believe the word amen by the grace of
[1:02:32] god because it was great all this was
[1:02:34] going to point to the word
[1:02:37] amen and we're here tonight because we
[1:02:40] believe the word we recognize the signs
[1:02:42] and wonders that god did in the ministry
[1:02:44] of william branham but praise the lord
[1:02:46] we didn't ignore what he was preaching
[1:02:49] we didn't ignore what he was teaching we
[1:02:51] didn't fail to recognize amen what the
[1:02:54] ministry in the word
[1:02:56] that it was according to what amen jesus
[1:02:59] pointed them to it alleluia to his
[1:03:01] ministry 2000 years ago amen but he also
[1:03:04] reminded them that there was that that
[1:03:07] that same
[1:03:09] ministry that was in john the baptist he
[1:03:12] said that ministry would also be in the
[1:03:13] last days amen now he said this this
[1:03:16] ministry you're talking about the
[1:03:18] ministry you're looking for 2000 years
[1:03:20] ago he said it's already come but i say
[1:03:23] under yay as god said he's going to do
[1:03:25] this and he's going to do that and amen
[1:03:27] he was referring to the latter days if
[1:03:29] returning to referring to the age which
[1:03:31] you and i are living amen
[1:03:33] and why because we will be looking for
[1:03:35] our lord jesus christ again we're
[1:03:37] looking for his presence looking for his
[1:03:39] anointing looking for his deliverance
[1:03:41] amen but jesus is highlighting that
[1:03:44] before that you recognize the presence
[1:03:47] of jesus you had to recognize the
[1:03:49] presence of the angel of god or the
[1:03:52] prophet of god amen
[1:03:54] through malachi 4 jesus referred to
[1:03:57] malachi 4 amen concerning that it would
[1:04:00] come in the last days he referred to
[1:04:02] malachi 4 saying that it was already
[1:04:04] happened in the day that he was made
[1:04:06] flesh amen surely he said he's done this
[1:04:09] and he's done that amen and yet he said
[1:04:11] i say unto you that he will do this and
[1:04:13] he will do that why another ministry
[1:04:16] amen in the in the revelation of the
[1:04:18] word in the restoration of the word the
[1:04:20] ministry of malachi 4 2000 years ago
[1:04:23] amen was pointing to the word made flesh
[1:04:25] then now the ministry of malachi 4 amen
[1:04:29] in this hour in this age is pointing to
[1:04:31] the revelation of the ministry today
[1:04:33] amen as i said he redeemed our souls now
[1:04:36] he's redeeming our bodies hey praise the
[1:04:38] lord jesus came down in flesh and
[1:04:41] redeemed us and he promised he was going
[1:04:43] to come back
[1:04:44] amen and he was going to receive us unto
[1:04:46] himself
[1:04:47] amen by the grace of god but he would
[1:04:50] also send a messenger amen prophesy
[1:04:53] again in malachi 4. because malachi 4
[1:04:56] talks about amen turning to turning the
[1:04:59] the faith
[1:05:01] of the church in that one but it was all
[1:05:02] focusing on signs and wonders amen but
[1:05:06] we came to the revelation of the
[1:05:08] prophetic ministry of good and brethren
[1:05:10] amen oh yes we are focusing on the signs
[1:05:13] and the wonders of that prophetic
[1:05:15] ministry but amen god brought our
[1:05:18] attention to the revelation of the word
[1:05:20] amen and again there's many oh yeah that
[1:05:22] was good he was great he was a
[1:05:24] tremendous servant of god amen amen amen
[1:05:27] amen they went on with his signs and his
[1:05:29] waters but when they struck the word no
[1:05:31] they couldn't accept it this is amazing
[1:05:34] they couldn't accept
[1:05:36] what winter man was teaching this is
[1:05:38] amazing considering all the signs and
[1:05:41] the wonders which he did that he could
[1:05:42] discern by the grace of god he could
[1:05:45] deserve the thoughts and intents of the
[1:05:46] heart he knew this he knew that amen no
[1:05:49] hiding from him
[1:05:51] he did
[1:05:52] send his word with jesus but he denied
[1:05:54] jesus and crucified him amen savage was
[1:05:57] with christ in this hour they denied him
[1:05:59] and crucified him again
[1:06:02] it was as it were the second crucifixion
[1:06:04] of our lord
[1:06:05] amen so brother amen two brother bound
[1:06:08] three son
[1:06:09] the crucifixion yeah this hour they say
[1:06:11] amen denominationals religious people
[1:06:14] amen they they oh they recognize the
[1:06:17] signs and the wonders thank god for the
[1:06:18] signs and the weathers but they
[1:06:20] shouldn't come to the teaching no no
[1:06:22] they didn't believe that was god but it
[1:06:24] was god
[1:06:25] amen and brother again as the prophet
[1:06:28] said the signs and the wonders that the
[1:06:30] first poll the second pool of his
[1:06:31] ministry was only to get our attention
[1:06:34] amen get our attention and brother when
[1:06:36] he when he got the attention of the
[1:06:37] bride amen and those knowing they are to
[1:06:40] come for the opening of the seven seals
[1:06:42] revealing the mystery of god amen and
[1:06:45] it's a revelation of the end time by the
[1:06:47] grace of god hallelujah and brothers lay
[1:06:50] in this word lay in that word lay it in
[1:06:51] amen no they didn't want that
[1:06:54] god bless lord brother
[1:06:56] in his signs and wonders but lord not
[1:06:58] his teaching and major that's where they
[1:07:00] stood
[1:07:02] but as believers and again let me
[1:07:04] emphasize that i was part of the
[1:07:06] fellowship in gamble and i did attend
[1:07:08] the pentecostal church in here and i was
[1:07:11] baptized there but again
[1:07:13] we were
[1:07:14] non-denominational because god had set a
[1:07:17] problem and a prophet but a but an
[1:07:19] evangelist oh yes there was an
[1:07:20] evangelist and his wife from either nova
[1:07:23] scotia or new brunswick amen and they
[1:07:25] came to newfoundland in the early 1960s
[1:07:28] and oh they laid in the word laid in the
[1:07:30] word amen now yeah they had camp
[1:07:33] meetings i was i was one time i remember
[1:07:35] being in their tent meeting in
[1:07:38] gamble and it was at the very lower part
[1:07:41] of gamble amen and we and i can remember
[1:07:44] now that he had a tent set up there and
[1:07:47] i remember as a young boy that i was
[1:07:49] with other young young young brothers
[1:07:51] there and oh we never had room in the
[1:07:54] tent for us to sit because the tent was
[1:07:56] full
[1:07:57] and but they had the size of the tent
[1:07:59] pulled up
[1:08:00] amen and so
[1:08:02] with a number of other young people i
[1:08:04] was i was laying on the ground
[1:08:06] oh yeah laying down underground and
[1:08:08] looking into the tent and looking up to
[1:08:10] the platform amen this woman was going
[1:08:13] to sing that one was saying then they
[1:08:14] then they then they sang this for the
[1:08:16] congregation and this or the
[1:08:18] congregation and then this brother or
[1:08:20] sister got up and preached oh i remember
[1:08:23] that amen
[1:08:24] this is absolutely amazing i can take
[1:08:26] you right down to that place now and
[1:08:28] show you on the left side where there
[1:08:30] was some vacant vacant land there and
[1:08:32] they had this tent set up amen but that
[1:08:35] ministry for the most part that ministry
[1:08:38] even back then they weren't preaching
[1:08:40] william branham they weren't preaching
[1:08:42] what he called the message and you know
[1:08:44] of the prophet no no he did reference
[1:08:46] just once amen when he was preaching he
[1:08:49] did reference that that the the ministry
[1:08:52] of willing ran the signs and the wonders
[1:08:54] and he was saying this is absolutely
[1:08:55] amazing but he says we remember the the
[1:08:58] ministry of william branham and what god
[1:09:00] was doing through william branham the
[1:09:03] signs and the wonders deserting the
[1:09:05] thoughts and entrance of the heart he
[1:09:06] did this he did that oh they
[1:09:09] but again he didn't emphasize the
[1:09:11] teaching of william branham
[1:09:13] and again the exact year that was i
[1:09:15] don't know but it was sometime in 1960
[1:09:18] amen and it was even before the the
[1:09:21] cottage meeting in gamble and the
[1:09:23] brothers of citrus and gamble even
[1:09:25] before they recognized william branham
[1:09:27] as the prophet oh yeah but we can we
[1:09:29] continued on non-denominational because
[1:09:32] why we're under that teaching under that
[1:09:34] influence of that ministry amen that god
[1:09:37] wasn't in denominations god wasn't
[1:09:41] controlling his word denominations amen
[1:09:43] that's manmade
[1:09:45] and they said not god made amen so he
[1:09:47] said that brother was preaching that
[1:09:49] sister was preaching and they said let
[1:09:51] us stay with the leadership of the holy
[1:09:53] ghost so there's not you living not me
[1:09:56] living he says the holy ghost living in
[1:09:57] us amen so brother sister for
[1:10:01] uh but again i'm not sure how many exact
[1:10:03] years it was not many from there on that
[1:10:05] eventually we came to hear the prophet
[1:10:07] of god amen and recognize the proud of
[1:10:10] god amen and we became believers amen
[1:10:13] amen and oh i still gathered together
[1:10:16] with the saints and gamble and what do
[1:10:17] we do what were we doing we were
[1:10:19] listening to the prophet's tapes
[1:10:21] oh yeah i was very young but they we
[1:10:24] went in and we had this song service and
[1:10:26] we worshiped praise the lord hallelujah
[1:10:28] amen and then when we come to the
[1:10:30] hearing of the word brother jewel would
[1:10:32] sit down and put on a tape of william
[1:10:34] branham and again it was one of those
[1:10:35] big tapes yeah and after after a few
[1:10:38] months i believe or maybe a year or two
[1:10:41] that the saints said no brother girl now
[1:10:44] we want you to do it
[1:10:46] we want we feel that god has got a call
[1:10:48] in your life and so we want you to
[1:10:50] minister to us so i was for a while
[1:10:53] refusing to do it but again eventually i
[1:10:55] did step in it says okay we'll see what
[1:10:57] the lord will do amen and that was the
[1:10:59] beginning of my ministry when it comes
[1:11:01] to the message of the hour amen so
[1:11:04] instead of playing tapes they said
[1:11:05] brother we want you to come minister now
[1:11:07] amen you can preach whatever the prophet
[1:11:09] prays but brother grace of god
[1:11:12] amen that we're not just listening to a
[1:11:14] tape
[1:11:15] amen praise the lord but we're hearing
[1:11:18] the word of god amen and that's where i
[1:11:20] started when it comes to ministering the
[1:11:22] message of the hour brother and that's
[1:11:24] been over 50 years ago
[1:11:27] amen but brother where are we now
[1:11:30] what are we believing now what are we
[1:11:32] taking our stand for now amen it was
[1:11:34] absolutely tremendous back then and we
[1:11:37] were experiencing that under that
[1:11:38] anointing experiencing that that that
[1:11:40] bright revival back there in man coming
[1:11:44] into the word and identifying with what
[1:11:46] god had done with what god was doing
[1:11:48] amen then what identifying that it was
[1:11:51] absolutely the end of all things amen
[1:11:54] that's right so that that finally the
[1:11:57] ministry was revealed the ministry was
[1:11:59] manifested in the last days amen what
[1:12:02] for to give us the faith that we need to
[1:12:04] get through
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:07] god sent this evangelist that and that
[1:12:09] brother yes and i have to admit that it
[1:12:11] was a sister amen they both preached
[1:12:14] amen but
[1:12:16] under their ministry oh yeah we we we
[1:12:19] came to
[1:12:21] freedom from the control of man in the
[1:12:23] church
[1:12:24] the control of man in a denomination
[1:12:27] amen so and we were focusing mainly on
[1:12:30] on the pentecostal revival the
[1:12:32] pentecostal move
[1:12:34] but we got to the revelation of the
[1:12:37] right move amen that what god had done
[1:12:40] and what god was doing was sort of
[1:12:42] calling out of the bright
[1:12:45] amen brother this message is not for
[1:12:47] everyone up there the problem of god
[1:12:48] said jesus is going to be preached all
[1:12:50] over the world but he said they're not
[1:12:52] all they want all hear the message he
[1:12:54] said because this is only for the bride
[1:12:57] amen thank god you heard it
[1:13:00] thank god i heard it amen
[1:13:02] amen i've been having a confirmation in
[1:13:05] in us that we are a part of the bride of
[1:13:07] the lord jesus christ
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:10] because he's not going out there well
[1:13:13] god bless them that's fine you know and
[1:13:15] i'm not going to condemn them they're
[1:13:16] not going to do this because brother
[1:13:18] it's god that that reveals it
[1:13:21] amen many are called and he god called
[1:13:24] them all but few were chosen he chose
[1:13:26] the bride amen but he saw that nature in
[1:13:30] in you he saw a nature in me saw nature
[1:13:32] in the bright oh yeah that's mine
[1:13:35] amen and and he could do this oh he knew
[1:13:38] that you believed the word
[1:13:39] he knew you would stay with the word
[1:13:41] amen so the grace of god is with us here
[1:13:44] amen after 50 years we're still staying
[1:13:47] with the word amen after 50 years we're
[1:13:50] still believing god after 50 years we're
[1:13:53] still looking for the resurrection
[1:13:55] and for the rapture because amen end
[1:13:58] time evangelism is putting our emphasis
[1:14:00] on the resurrection it is putting our
[1:14:02] emphasis on the rapture
[1:14:04] because this is what god wants to do and
[1:14:07] this is what god is doing amen as i said
[1:14:10] down through the years god did this god
[1:14:12] did that god did that amen and he put
[1:14:15] their emphasis on justification he put
[1:14:17] their emphasis on the baptism of the
[1:14:19] holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen
[1:14:22] but brother then he came on the scene in
[1:14:24] the prophet to put our emphasis on the
[1:14:26] word to give us resurrection and
[1:14:28] rapturing faith amen brother pentecost
[1:14:31] oh yes the prophet ohio uh prophet
[1:14:33] highlighted it and because why pentecost
[1:14:36] he said thought he said that the
[1:14:37] pentecostal message he said would bring
[1:14:39] the rapture
[1:14:40] amen the pentecostal message would do
[1:14:43] this and this but no he said god had
[1:14:46] predestinated god had for ordained he
[1:14:48] said this prophecy concerning the
[1:14:50] calling out of the bright
[1:14:52] amen and he said the revelation of the
[1:14:54] mystery of god to give her resurrection
[1:14:57] and rapturing faith amen not a
[1:14:59] pentecostal faith not by any means no no
[1:15:02] no but brother it is a faith hallelujah
[1:15:06] of the revelation of the son of man and
[1:15:08] it's in the in the son of man is the
[1:15:10] revelation he said i am the resurrection
[1:15:13] and the rapture
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:16] oh yeah that's when he like i said when
[1:15:17] he raised lazarus from the from the dead
[1:15:19] and
[1:15:20] martha didn't believe it didn't all that
[1:15:23] the resurrection is up the road rather
[1:15:24] than amen but she failed to comprehend
[1:15:27] the resurrection with withering flesh
[1:15:29] in jesus amen and brother
[1:15:33] that same attitude that same spirit amen
[1:15:35] is among a lot of people today amen they
[1:15:38] recognize this they recognize that but
[1:15:40] they don't recognize that god what is
[1:15:43] here in the revealing of the word to
[1:15:46] give us the faith for the resurrection
[1:15:48] and the faith for the rapture
[1:15:51] oh my brother sister and many of us are
[1:15:53] focusing on the resurrection how many of
[1:15:56] us are focusing on the rapture and many
[1:15:58] of us are looking for the resurrection
[1:16:00] rapture any moment now to get out of
[1:16:02] here but there's too many still focusing
[1:16:04] just on this mystery this mystery this
[1:16:07] doctrine this doctrine and so oh yeah
[1:16:09] god uh what are you believing this for
[1:16:11] well god god said the prophet to reveal
[1:16:13] this reveal that yes he did that's the
[1:16:15] truth but
[1:16:16] is he giving you the faith that he's
[1:16:18] looking for
[1:16:19] amen not to believe this doctrine that
[1:16:21] doctrine this doctrine that doctrine
[1:16:23] amen brother believe that plus and we're
[1:16:26] believing it the way we should i tell
[1:16:28] you this
[1:16:29] god
[1:16:30] is focusing on in your life and in mind
[1:16:33] morning new tonight he's focusing on the
[1:16:35] resurrection rapture amen because he
[1:16:38] said when this happens this happens this
[1:16:40] happens amen look up
[1:16:42] how many believers are looking up
[1:16:44] how many believers they feel like
[1:16:46] they're moving at a time and into
[1:16:48] eternity how many are really really
[1:16:50] concentrating on heaven
[1:16:52] not this whole earth
[1:16:54] just till too many brother that are
[1:16:56] focusing on
[1:16:58] the natural
[1:17:00] oh yeah they're living for the natural
[1:17:02] they're controlled by the natural
[1:17:04] not not being led by the spirit why if
[1:17:08] any man can come after me he said let
[1:17:10] him deny himself
[1:17:12] amen and to deny himself
[1:17:15] by the grace of god
[1:17:18] brother
[1:17:19] it it is to ignore self
[1:17:22] amen looking for the revelation that i
[1:17:24] had written down concerning to deny self
[1:17:27] amen brother is to ignore self amen and
[1:17:31] let oh yeah to deny self
[1:17:33] is to deny your personal interests
[1:17:37] yeah
[1:17:38] to deny that because that's what the
[1:17:39] devil is working on
[1:17:41] in our brains in our minds in our
[1:17:43] feelings amen he's trying to get us to
[1:17:45] focus more and more on our personal
[1:17:47] interests and our natural things of life
[1:17:50] amen but hallelujah but what god did
[1:17:53] oh my brother sister he did it for this
[1:17:56] reason to get our attention from the
[1:17:57] natural to the spiritual
[1:17:59] amen praise the name of the lord by the
[1:18:02] grace of god god help us that we're not

[1:32:04] it's the coming of the lord
[1:32:06] there's an atmosphere
[1:32:08] and it depends on what you're looking at
[1:32:11] for the lord has strictly told us just
[1:32:13] what was going to happen at that time
[1:32:15] and we don't know the minute or the hour
[1:32:17] but we know that we are nearing
[1:32:20] something now

[1:32:24] and you know a sheep cannot find his way
[1:32:26] back wherever he come from is lost

[1:32:32] lord likens us unto sheep
[1:32:34] and we're lost there's only one thing
[1:32:36] can bring us back
[1:32:38] the shepherd

[1:32:47] and he said a lamb or a sheep doesn't
[1:32:49] smell its enemy
[1:32:51] and he said like the other like a deer
[1:32:53] or something like that and he could he
[1:32:55] could sense that death was near and
[1:32:57] there was a lion coming slipping up
[1:32:59] coming easy and he could smell the sheep
[1:33:02] so he was coming you see to get the lamb
[1:33:06] amen and the little fellows become
[1:33:08] nervous and you couldn't see the reason
[1:33:10] why but it was death was lurking so near
[1:33:14] that he was nervous
[1:33:16] well brother we're not nervous
[1:33:18] but we're encouraged
[1:33:20] in our faith why because we see that the
[1:33:24] well the resurrection the rapture the
[1:33:26] change is is so near right now
[1:33:29] i pray grace that we're that we're
[1:33:31] experiencing it

[1:33:35] it's pulling on you pulling on the alert
[1:33:37] to pull us out of time into eternity
[1:33:40] how many want to go
[1:33:42] i trust we're not not satisfied with
[1:33:44] this this
[1:33:46] dimension we're in
[1:33:48] oh yeah i believe
[1:33:51] you know let let us take
[1:33:54] certain one of us and let us put us into
[1:33:57] a you want to go to africa you want to
[1:33:58] go to north africa do you want to go to
[1:34:00] russia
[1:34:01] oh it's a different atmosphere there
[1:34:04] want to go to china different atmosphere
[1:34:06] there
[1:34:07] oh yeah when it comes to spiritual
[1:34:10] because i know that in those countries
[1:34:12] where there's a few believers here and
[1:34:13] there and what do they do
[1:34:15] they they go good into the wilderness
[1:34:18] to worship
[1:34:21] oh yeah
[1:34:22] some go into the wilderness and others
[1:34:24] oh yeah they get together a few in a
[1:34:26] house and like i said they'll set the
[1:34:28] table with a meal and and have it all
[1:34:30] there and then they'll go into the
[1:34:32] living room as they were wherever it is
[1:34:34] and they'll start to worship the lord
[1:34:35] and pray and sing amen and hear the word
[1:34:39] and but if there's any knocks come down
[1:34:40] the door or they'll run and sit down at
[1:34:42] the table
[1:34:44] amen pretending to eat natural food
[1:34:48] oh yeah
[1:34:50] i pray god grace brother thank god for
[1:34:52] the revelation that we have the freedom
[1:34:54] we have but brother i trust we're not
[1:34:56] going to be so free that we forget
[1:34:58] who we are
[1:35:00] where we come from why we're here and
[1:35:02] where we're going
[1:35:05] amen
[1:35:07] brother
[1:35:09] please
[1:35:10] let's be spiritual
[1:35:12] by the grace of god
[1:35:15] he said the world is such in a neurotic
[1:35:17] shape right now
[1:35:18] he said he'll drive you down the street
[1:35:20] 90 miles an hour and he's sit in a beer
[1:35:23] joint drink two hours before they go
[1:35:25] home
[1:35:26] yeah speak to someone oh my they blow up
[1:35:30] yeah
[1:35:31] well it's getting worse and worse now in
[1:35:33] the last few months they're in
[1:35:34] newfoundland
[1:35:36] i trust you're not ignoring the news
[1:35:39] oh my they're crazy yeah it is but you
[1:35:41] better look up
[1:35:44] it's not crazy it's insanity
[1:35:46] it's the devil's influence
[1:35:48] satan is the god of this world
[1:35:54] trust he's not the god of your life
[1:35:57] amen
[1:35:59] and well i thought what's the matter
[1:36:01] they said everybody just letting all
[1:36:02] pressure
[1:36:04] but the doctor the psychiatrists are
[1:36:06] doctoring the psychiatrists
[1:36:08] oh he said but there is a way out that's
[1:36:11] christ
[1:36:12] and he said the christians should not be
[1:36:13] in that condition and we should be happy
[1:36:16] waiting for the coming for it is close
[1:36:19] it was close back in 62 how close would
[1:36:22] he consider it now
[1:36:24] i trust by grace we're not going to miss
[1:36:26] it
[1:36:29] he said we know that redemption is nigh
[1:36:32] something is fixing to take place and
[1:36:34] the world doesn't see
[1:36:36] that
[1:36:37] they laugh at it because they did it did
[1:36:39] in other days but we know that it is
[1:36:42] coming near
[1:36:44] amen
[1:36:45] and the reason i chose today this
[1:36:47] subject he said for my last for a while
[1:36:50] for the tabernacle on end time
[1:36:52] evangelism and when we are doing mission
[1:36:55] work or foreign missions with the word
[1:36:57] of god we know we're always in the will
[1:37:01] of god
[1:37:02] why stay with the word of god you're in
[1:37:03] the will of god
[1:37:05] amen
[1:37:06] because he said jesus first commission
[1:37:09] to his church was go out and preach the
[1:37:12] gospel
[1:37:13] the last commission was to preach the
[1:37:16] gospel
[1:37:17] amen
[1:37:18] the first time to the jews only and he
[1:37:21] said the last commission is to all
[1:37:23] nations
[1:37:24] amen by the grace of god
[1:37:27] and brother
[1:37:29] he said he
[1:37:31] and them that had seen jesus after he
[1:37:34] was risen from the dead
[1:37:36] he said see they had a testimony that
[1:37:38] they seen the lord and others didn't
[1:37:41] believe it
[1:37:42] and he uprated them because of the
[1:37:44] hardness of their heart and they didn't
[1:37:46] believe these people who had seen
[1:37:49] this that he was not dead he's alive
[1:37:52] brother i pray grace they had that
[1:37:55] revelation that he was alive i pray
[1:37:57] grace we have that revelation that he's
[1:37:58] here with us tonight the resurrection
[1:38:01] and the rapture
[1:38:03] the rapture is not up there the rapture
[1:38:04] is here
[1:38:06] amen
[1:38:08] same thing today and he said when you
[1:38:10] see his work and he said now he said we
[1:38:12] have already seen and are witnessing the
[1:38:15] appearing of the lord amen
[1:38:18] and remember appearing and coming is two
[1:38:20] different words to appear and then to
[1:38:23] come
[1:38:24] now is the appearing and he's already
[1:38:26] appeared in these last days and right
[1:38:28] here with us in the last few years now
[1:38:31] it's a sign of his coming
[1:38:34] this was 1962
[1:38:37] amen he came down in 63 with the opening
[1:38:40] of the word
[1:38:41] praise the
[1:38:42] lord and remember he said it spoke both
[1:38:45] places appearing and coming
[1:38:48] amen and today we try to take the
[1:38:51] written word we have in letter form
[1:38:53] creed form and so forth to all the world
[1:38:57] and he said there's been missionaries
[1:38:58] gone everywhere but what we do find what
[1:39:01] we get there he said a native that can't
[1:39:03] read his name holding a track in his
[1:39:05] hand and he knows no more about it than
[1:39:08] he does which is right and left hand but
[1:39:11] when jesus said go
[1:39:13] and preach the gospel he never said
[1:39:16] teach the word he said preach the gospel
[1:39:19] and the gospel came not in word only
[1:39:22] but through the manifestation of the
[1:39:24] word for the only way that it could be
[1:39:27] done was to make his promise come to
[1:39:29] pass
[1:39:30] amen
[1:39:33] brother grace but now
[1:39:36] preaching the word now is to make the
[1:39:38] word flesh in us
[1:39:41] by the grace of god
[1:39:43] he said in this case god comes among the
[1:39:45] people proves that his word is made
[1:39:47] manifest and the only way you can do
[1:39:49] that is not by a tract
[1:39:51] but by the holy spirit
[1:39:53] working through you
[1:39:55] amen
[1:39:56] praise the lord what god has done what
[1:39:58] god is doing he's revealed it in you
[1:40:02] and through you your life
[1:40:04] your life is bearing
[1:40:06] witness why are you doing this why are
[1:40:09] you doing that why do you go to this
[1:40:10] church why do you go to that church and
[1:40:12] so on well
[1:40:14] because you want to get in want the lord
[1:40:16] to increase your faith
[1:40:18] amen
[1:40:19] in what he has done
[1:40:22] he said your life becomes his life yes
[1:40:25] he said it is
[1:40:26] god in you
[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:30] praise the lord
[1:40:32] brother
[1:40:33] all down through the prophets to
[1:40:35] prophets the prophets to finally does
[1:40:37] the god prophet
[1:40:38] jesus
[1:40:39] it has been all the way down through the
[1:40:41] messengers to messengers to messenger
[1:40:43] amen to finally it is
[1:40:46] christ the messenger
[1:40:48] not william branham no no
[1:40:52] see the problem of god said see that's
[1:40:54] your problem
[1:40:55] he said you don't see the other angel
[1:40:58] he said you see me
[1:41:00] he said oh yeah i said that he said
[1:41:02] that's your problem he said you
[1:41:03] recognize me but you don't see him
[1:41:05] he said he's right there behind me
[1:41:08] amen
[1:41:09] oh he is yes he is
[1:41:14] they saw william branham but he said
[1:41:16] what about behind me

[1:41:23] hallelujah
[1:41:24] oh yeah he said i'm not there

[1:41:35] oh brother it ought to give us faith
[1:41:37] lord we're coming home
[1:41:39] lord we know it was you
[1:41:41] we know that it wasn't will and brown
[1:41:43] doing this willing down doing that lord
[1:41:45] we recognize you as the other angel that
[1:41:47] was there

[1:41:55] finished
[1:41:57] god help us
[1:41:59] amen
[1:42:01] he said your life becomes his life
[1:42:04] and he's in you
[1:42:06] and jesus said you must be born again in
[1:42:10] order to be born again is letting
[1:42:11] yourself go and die and the spirit of
[1:42:14] christ come into you and then you're no
[1:42:17] more yours it's christ in you
[1:42:19] amen and paul said i die daily yet i
[1:42:23] live
[1:42:24] not me but christ liveth
[1:42:26] in me
[1:42:27] amen
[1:42:29] is christ living in you
[1:42:32] in your home in your job among family
[1:42:35] friends and neighbors are you religious
[1:42:37] are you are you spiritual
[1:42:40] amen not reflecting religion
[1:42:44] but we're reflecting
[1:42:45] the holy ghost
[1:42:47] christ in us
[1:42:51] if i tell you i'm a christian and the
[1:42:53] spirit of christ is in me or in you then
[1:42:56] we do the works of christ because jesus
[1:42:58] said
[1:42:59] he that believeth on me the works that i
[1:43:02] do shall he do also
[1:43:04] and then he said here these signs shall
[1:43:06] follow them that believe
[1:43:08] and now he said through the age there
[1:43:10] has been a time that these signs as not
[1:43:12] followed believer
[1:43:14] and he said there would come a time
[1:43:16] that could not be called day nor night
[1:43:19] but in the evening time it shall be
[1:43:22] light
[1:43:22] amen
[1:43:24] he said everything that's going on he
[1:43:26] said denotes is coming we are at the end
[1:43:30] time amen
[1:43:32] and the prophet said
[1:43:36] and he said
[1:43:37] it's exactly what it says it shall be
[1:43:40] light in the evening time
[1:43:43] and then the same sun that come up upon
[1:43:46] the eastern people and showed his works
[1:43:48] and his blessings it was prophesied that
[1:43:51] there would be
[1:43:52] a dismal day
[1:43:54] amen
[1:43:55] it would not be day or night that's a
[1:43:58] gloomy day
[1:43:59] amen but in the evening time the same
[1:44:03] great power of god would come upon the
[1:44:05] church
[1:44:06] amen
[1:44:08] and he said just like it did back there
[1:44:10] on the eastern in the western it would
[1:44:12] be the same and that's why i want to
[1:44:14] speak on evening time evangelism
[1:44:17] amen i'll finish with these quotes and
[1:44:20] he said each age
[1:44:22] has had its message and its messengers
[1:44:25] all through the times every age has
[1:44:28] packed its message with a messenger
[1:44:30] and god in every dispensation has sent
[1:44:33] for someone
[1:44:34] anointed with the holy spirit to bring
[1:44:36] forth his message for that age
[1:44:39] every time
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:43] and he said god was the messenger at the
[1:44:45] beginning to tell adam and eve you shall
[1:44:48] eat this but you shall not do this
[1:44:51] that was the message
[1:44:53] and when man stepped across the message
[1:44:55] of the hour it brought death and chaos
[1:44:57] to the whole human race and now that's
[1:45:00] how much the message means amen
[1:45:03] that's right brother sister
[1:45:06] and remember that it wasn't just a
[1:45:07] complete blank denial of what god said
[1:45:10] that he believed it was taking what god
[1:45:13] said and whitewashing it over
[1:45:16] he said misconstruing it
[1:45:18] just a little bit
[1:45:20] or taking a little bit away from it
[1:45:23] leave it the way that god said it
[1:45:26] amen and concerning what god has done
[1:45:28] and what god is doing leave it the way
[1:45:30] that god is doing it
[1:45:32] amen right now let's recognize it let's
[1:45:36] believe it and leave it amen and thank
[1:45:39] god for it
[1:45:40] by grace amen and let's keep moving on
[1:45:44] remember
[1:45:46] end time evangelism is to get us to
[1:45:48] focus on what god's doing
[1:45:50] amen
[1:45:51] as i said before he brought us out
[1:45:54] amen from organized religion
[1:45:56] and that's why we're here
[1:45:58] but do we have the faith of end time
[1:46:00] evangelism to rapture us
[1:46:03] because that's what god's looking for in
[1:46:05] us now
[1:46:07] brother not just say well i believe this
[1:46:09] i believe that all right he said where's
[1:46:11] the faith
[1:46:13] where's the faith that it's ordained to
[1:46:14] give you
[1:46:15] amen
[1:46:17] through the ministry of the word
[1:46:20] whether it's

[1:46:26] focusing on what he has done yes and
[1:46:29] what he is doing
[1:46:31] and what he will do
[1:46:33] amen because brother the word
[1:46:36] god in the word god through the word is
[1:46:38] endeavoring to do it
[1:46:40] endeavoring to bring it to pass
[1:46:42] endeavoring to make the word flesh
[1:46:44] endeavoring to make the prophecy
[1:46:46] fulfilled amen completely
[1:46:48] brother this prophecy is fulfilled
[1:46:50] that's fulfilled but brother concerning
[1:46:52] the prophecy of the resurrection and
