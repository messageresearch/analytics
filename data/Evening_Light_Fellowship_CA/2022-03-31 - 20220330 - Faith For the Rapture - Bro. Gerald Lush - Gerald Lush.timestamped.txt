[1:10:06] into heaven by a whirlwind
[1:10:09] that elijah
[1:10:11] went with elisha from gilgal
[1:10:15] and elijah said unto elisha
[1:10:18] tarry here i pray thee
[1:10:21] for the lord has sent me to bethel
[1:10:24] and elisha said unto him as the lord
[1:10:27] liveth
[1:10:28] and as thy soul liveth
[1:10:31] i will not leave thee
[1:10:33] so they went down to bethel
[1:10:37] and the sons of the prophets that were
[1:10:39] at bethel came forth to elisha
[1:10:43] and said unto him
[1:10:45] knowest thou

[1:11:32] that were at jericho came to elisha
[1:11:36] and

[1:11:47] where'd they get that revelation
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:51] praise the lord
[1:11:52] amen knowing the ministry of elijah
[1:11:56] knowing that maybe that he had come to
[1:11:57] the end of his ministry knowing that
[1:12:00] what god had promised god had done
[1:12:02] through his servant elijah and it was
[1:12:04] finished amen

[1:12:15] that he's rapturing a bride
[1:12:17] amen and believing that we are part of
[1:12:20] the bride
[1:12:21] so the sons of the prophets that were at
[1:12:23] jericho came to elisha and said unto him
[1:12:27] notice now that the lord will take away
[1:12:29] thy master from the thy head today
[1:12:33] and he answered yea i know it

[1:12:47] and he said as the lord liveth and as
[1:12:50] thy soul liveth
[1:12:51] i will not leave thee
[1:12:54] and they too went on
[1:12:56] amen
[1:12:58] he stayed with elijah

[1:18:13] amen the revealed word and the faith
[1:18:16] amen praise the lord the faith that he
[1:18:18] was that it was ordained that he was
[1:18:20] ordained to give us through the revealed

[1:18:30] that he was preaching and wesley and the
[1:18:31] message that he was preaching amen and
[1:18:34] moving it on to pentecost amen but
[1:18:36] pentecost brother brother
[1:18:38] god crowned it with them with the
[1:18:40] prophetic message
[1:18:42] god crowned the pentecostal revival with
[1:18:44] the prophetic
[1:18:46] ministry
[1:18:47] oh yeah or the pentecost taught that
[1:18:49] they were going to take us on to the
[1:18:50] coming of the lord amen oh yeah
[1:18:53] they for years or years pentecost
[1:18:56] thought you know well we're going to
[1:18:57] this is going to go into the rapture
[1:18:59] this is going to the rapture yeah yeah
[1:19:01] but the thing it was according to the
[1:19:03] word god had ordained and god had
[1:19:05] prophesied the ministry of a prophet to
[1:19:08] give us resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:19:10] amen brother with the faith that god
[1:19:12] gave the pentecostals a hundred years
[1:19:15] ago over a hundred years ago amen they
[1:19:17] went and they did what god wanted to do
[1:19:19] amen but brother it wasn't going to give
[1:19:22] us resurrection it wasn't going to give
[1:19:23] us the rapture amen because
[1:19:26] in that pentecostal revival out of it it
[1:19:29] would come the ministry of a prophet
[1:19:31] that would give us the faith for the
[1:19:32] resurrection the faith or the rapture
[1:19:35] amen
[1:19:37] amen we thank god for the faith that he
[1:19:39] has given the given his children all the
[1:19:41] way down through the ages amen
[1:19:43] increasing our faith increasing our
[1:19:44] faith amen and brother what was the
[1:19:47] result of god increasing our faith
[1:19:49] remember it started it was good down
[1:19:51] here
[1:19:52] faith
[1:19:53] amen in the first age paul was the
[1:19:55] messenger amen and we were in a oneness
[1:19:58] with the body of christ the body was in
[1:20:00] oneness with jesus that's right
[1:20:02] but brother the thing went into a
[1:20:04] darkness amen and then god had just
[1:20:06] delayed started laying the word again
[1:20:08] the revelation again what for to bring
[1:20:10] us out of that darkness and the more
[1:20:12] into the greater and greater revelation
[1:20:14] of god amen so god was adding to it here
[1:20:17] adding to it there adding to it there
[1:20:18] amen until he would bring us to that
[1:20:21] what right stream faith praise the lord
[1:20:23] hallelujah
[1:20:25] luther went forward with this faith and
[1:20:27] wesley went forward with that faith
[1:20:28] justification sanctification and the
[1:20:30] pentecostals the baptism of the holy
[1:20:32] ghost amen brother amen and they thought
[1:20:35] that was it you know yeah but it was
[1:20:37] what they needed praise the lord they
[1:20:39] had the revelation of the baptism of the
[1:20:41] holy ghost amen god entered into a
[1:20:43] oneness with his seed with his sons and
[1:20:46] daughters amen through the baptism of
[1:20:48] the holy ghost that's good wonderful a
[1:20:50] relationship with god and god of
[1:20:52] relationship with us but it was to move
[1:20:54] us on to a greater faith for the
[1:20:56] resurrection and the rapture amen and
[1:21:00] brother what god gave pentecost way back
[1:21:02] on just over a hundred years ago brother
[1:21:05] it gave them that it restored the gifts
[1:21:07] and restored this and restored that but
[1:21:09] brother it it didn't give us right free
[1:21:12] faith
[1:21:13] it wasn't ordained to give us rapturing
[1:21:15] faith they gave them faith for the gifts
[1:21:17] they gave them faith and for the
[1:21:18] miracles and the signs and the others
[1:21:20] amen but god had to bring the prophet on
[1:21:23] the scene amen with the revealed word to
[1:21:26] give us the faith for the rapture
[1:21:28] amen oh praise the lord and again
[1:21:31] understand the faith that the the
[1:21:33] luther's message gave his generation
[1:21:35] wesley's
[1:21:36] message gave his generation the
[1:21:38] pentecostal message gave that generation
[1:21:40] amen but there was rising a generation
[1:21:43] for the resurrection rise in a
[1:21:45] generation for the rapture amen rising a
[1:21:48] generation to get out of time and into
[1:21:50] eternity and but brother the pentecostal
[1:21:53] message oh that was good but
[1:21:56] and all that they felt good and they're
[1:21:57] wonderful yeah but now

[1:22:01] god was looking for resurrection
[1:22:03] rapturing faith

[1:22:09] justification bear with me and when it
[1:22:11] comes to satanification oh they felt
[1:22:13] good they felt better and they felt even
[1:22:15] greater and with the anointing of the
[1:22:16] baptism of the holy ghost and pentecost
[1:22:18] amen but but together it was what god
[1:22:22] was doing amen
[1:22:24] amen but what is god doing
[1:22:28] in you and me amen what's god revealing
[1:22:31] in you and me amen what faith is god
[1:22:33] giving you and me amen are we focusing
[1:22:36] like pentecost on the feelings and on
[1:22:39] the gifts and on this and on that no the
[1:22:41] right is focusing we believe it but god
[1:22:44] is focusing on resurrection
[1:22:46] the right is focusing on the rapture
[1:22:49] amen
[1:22:50] brother that's that's that's that was
[1:22:52] the predestinated purpose and plan of
[1:22:54] god amen concerning malachi 4

[1:28:39] and in second peter
[1:28:42] chapter 3.
[1:28:57] and beginning to read at verse 1
[1:29:00] this second epistle beloved i now write
[1:29:03] unto you in both which i stir up your
[1:29:05] pure minds
[1:29:06] by way of remembrance
[1:29:09] that ye may be mindful of the words
[1:29:11] which were spoken before
[1:29:14] by the holy prophets
[1:29:17] and of the commandment of us the
[1:29:19] apostles of the lord and savior
[1:29:23] knowing this first
[1:29:25] that there shall come in the last days
[1:29:27] scoffers or mockers
[1:29:30] walking after their own lusts
[1:29:34] and saying
[1:29:35] where is the promise of his coming
[1:29:39] for since the fathers fell asleep
[1:29:42] all things continue as they were from
[1:29:45] the beginning of the creation
[1:29:48] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[1:29:51] that by the word of god the heavens were
[1:29:53] of old
[1:29:55] and the earth standing out of the water
[1:29:58] and in the water
[1:30:01] whereby the world that then was
[1:30:04] being overflowed with water perished
[1:30:07] but the heavens and the earth which are
[1:30:09] now by the same word are kept in store
[1:30:13] and reserved
[1:30:15] unto fire
[1:30:17] against the day of judgment and the
[1:30:19] perdition of ungodly men
[1:30:22] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[1:30:25] thing that one day is with the lord as a
[1:30:28] thousand years
[1:30:30] and a thousand years as one day amen
[1:30:36] considering that the earth would go on
[1:30:39] time would go on for seven
[1:30:42] seven days
[1:30:43] or seven thousand years
[1:30:46] one day with the lord as a thousand
[1:30:47] years amen
[1:30:50] verse 9
[1:30:51] the lord is not slack concerning his
[1:30:53] promise
[1:30:55] as
[1:30:56] some men count slackness
[1:30:58] but his longsuffering to us word not
[1:31:00] willing that any should perish but that
[1:31:03] all should come to repentance
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:09] brother if the revelation of what god
[1:31:11] has done brings us to anything it will
[1:31:13] bring us to repentance
[1:31:15] amen alarm will us to acknowledge that
[1:31:17] we are sinners saved by the grace of god
[1:31:20] amen brother sisters who acknowledge
[1:31:23] amen sent her saved by grace but
[1:31:25] predestinated for ordained
[1:31:27] amen to enter into the rapture
[1:31:30] by the grace of god
[1:31:32] brother for generations right from the
[1:31:34] beginning from the fall of man to the to
[1:31:36] the full redemption of man amen brothers
[1:31:40] the promise of being caught back into
[1:31:42] eternity it's the promise of being cut
[1:31:45] back into the presence of god again amen
[1:31:48] because ever since the fall in the book
[1:31:50] of genesis
[1:31:52] brother in the true seed of god the true
[1:31:54] elect of god has been the earth the
[1:31:56] hunger and the thirst to get back
[1:31:59] to glory
[1:32:00] is to get back with god again amen we
[1:32:03] were cut off as it were when it comes to
[1:32:06] god dealing with the sin in the in the
[1:32:08] in genesis god dealing with cain and
[1:32:11] abel oh my lord my lord brother
[1:32:14] abel or cain
[1:32:16] thought he could do this cain thought he
[1:32:18] could do that and cain yeah he had faith

[1:44:23] said praise the lord i said she's a lot
[1:44:26] better off now than she was in that body
[1:44:30] he said what
[1:44:32] what do you mean oh i said you don't
[1:44:35] understand i said if this tabernacle be
[1:44:37] dissolved i said we got one already
[1:44:40] waiting
[1:44:41] i said eternal in the heavens
[1:44:44] oh
[1:44:45] praise the lord i said in this body i
[1:44:47] said she was feeling weakness in this
[1:44:49] body she was feeling pain she was
[1:44:51] experiencing this experiencing that amen
[1:44:54] but i said when death took over i said
[1:44:56] she just moved and moved out of this
[1:44:58] body and into another body
[1:45:00] oh said i said the bible does refer to
[1:45:02] it as a theophany body but it's going to
[1:45:04] come one day into a glorified condition
[1:45:07] amen praise the lord and so i explain it
[1:45:10] and oh see that is tremendous thank you
[1:45:12] never he never heard that before
[1:45:15] he never he never thought that he never
[1:45:16] experienced that oh i said oh yes i said

[1:45:22] because she is resting with him amen

[1:57:02] and he said that's the way christ is
[1:57:04] doing to his church
[1:57:05] he is beating it and he is turning it
[1:57:08] and beating it and beating it
[1:57:11] and he said how dare a preacher to be
[1:57:14] enough not to tell the word of god

[1:57:19] these immoral clothes it's wrong to to

[1:57:51] no no
[1:57:52] that'll get pretty quiet
[1:57:55] oh yeah
[1:57:56] but he said so he says wrong
[1:57:59] he said
[1:58:02] he said he's beating it and turning it
[1:58:04] and he said out there a preacher to be
[1:58:06] enough not to tell the word of god

[1:58:37] way the church is doing today and he's
[1:58:40] playing lotteries and things he said god
[1:58:42] forbid when i have to do that he said

[1:58:58] in your spirit and your motives are your
[1:58:59] objectives
[1:59:03] is that jesus
[1:59:05] where is that brother so-and-so

[1:59:17] he said god forbid when i had to do that
[1:59:21] and he said jesus beats it with the holy
[1:59:23] ghost until he sees his own reflection
[1:59:26] and then you can see the works of christ
[1:59:28] being performed in the church
[1:59:31] then she's ready for the rapture
[1:59:36] are you ready
[1:59:40] amen

[1:59:44] you
[1:59:45] he said the holy spirit is giving the
[1:59:47] church its last call now
[1:59:50] and he said doing exactly what the bible
[1:59:52] said it would do and the pentecostal
[1:59:54] people are groping over the top of it
[2:00:00] he said listen
[2:00:01] if you're if we are expecting christ to
[2:00:04] come he said do you believe
[2:00:06] that
[2:00:08] he said then let's act like we believe
[2:00:10] it
[2:00:12] amen
[2:00:13] he said how can we expect christ to come
[2:00:16] and putting six million dollars in a
[2:00:18] building
[2:00:20] he said how you can get these great big
[2:00:23] things talking about christ coming
[2:00:26] he said brother we ought to be making
[2:00:28] ready for the rapture
[2:00:30] not for another 500 years here on earth
[2:00:37] we'll have to put a lot more money into
[2:00:38] the church so that
[2:00:41] it'll be still be here
[2:00:43] 500 years
[2:00:46] no

[2:00:51] amen leave it with the lord the lord
[2:00:54] here today gone tomorrow
[2:00:56] by the grace of god
[2:00:58] amen
[2:01:02] he said listen the holy spirit is giving
[2:01:04] the church the last call
[2:01:09] and doing exactly what the bible said it
[2:01:11] would do
[2:01:13] again let me say this he said do you
[2:01:14] believe and he said let's act like it
[2:01:17] how can we expect christ to come and put
[2:01:20] six million dollars into a building he
[2:01:23] said how can you get these big things
[2:01:25] take talking about christ coming
[2:01:29] well brother we ought to be making ready
[2:01:31] for the rapture not for another 500
[2:01:33] years on earth
[2:01:35] he said there's something wrong
[2:01:37] he said you might say it with your lips
[2:01:40] but by your heart
[2:01:43] he said oh you say oh yeah i believe
[2:01:46] christ is coming but your action proves
[2:01:49] you're different
[2:01:52] amen
[2:01:53] grace
[2:01:59] he said we are at the homeland
[2:02:02] he said i don't know whether you're
[2:02:03] going to believe it or not but i've got
[2:02:05] to say it
[2:02:07] i believe
[2:02:09] he said the jews are in a homeland and
[2:02:11] we're at the end of the age ready for
[2:02:13] the rapture
[2:02:14] and he said the rapture comes and the
[2:02:16] church goes up and we are cut up to meet
[2:02:19] him in the air and we all know he said
[2:02:22] the stone that was cut off and cut out
[2:02:24] of the mountain is ready to come at any
[2:02:27] time
[2:02:28] and he said when it comes what does it
[2:02:30] do
[2:02:31] said it does away with the gentile age
[2:02:34] it's all over
[2:02:36] and god completely quits dealing with
[2:02:39] them
[2:02:44] that's serious
[2:02:47] that when god stops dealing with the
[2:02:48] gentiles
[2:02:51] we know there's coming an hour that when
[2:02:53] god is going to want to leave the
[2:02:55] gentiles and go back to the jews
[2:02:58] has he done that is he doing it
[2:03:05] i'll tell you the only way that and the
[2:03:07] only place that god is moving among the
[2:03:09] gentiles is in the bride
[2:03:12] is in the elect that's ordained and
[2:03:14] predestinated for the resurrection or
[2:03:16] dangerousness for the rapture that's the
[2:03:18] only ones god's dealing with right now
[2:03:20] through the message to the revealed word
[2:03:22] of the hour to give us faith for the
[2:03:24] rapture
[2:03:26] amen faith
[2:03:29] god help us
[2:03:38] listen
[2:03:44] he said
[2:03:50] and if i read this we see it again we're
[2:03:52] at the homeland
[2:03:54] the jews are in a homeland we're at the
[2:03:55] end of the age ready yeah ready for the
[2:03:57] rapture
[2:03:58] and he said concerning what god has done
[2:04:00] what god is doing and he said it does
[2:04:02] away with the gentile age it's all over
[2:04:05] and god completely quits dealing with
[2:04:08] them
[2:04:09] why let him that's filthy be filthy
[2:04:12] still
[2:04:13] and let him that's holy be holy still
[2:04:15] see what does he do then he takes his
[2:04:18] church the holy ghost filled
[2:04:21] he said what's the filthy he said that's
[2:04:24] the sleeping virgin
[2:04:25] and them that comes up for judgment
[2:04:29] and has to be judged by the redeemed
[2:04:33] and paul told us to take a matter to
[2:04:35] court because the saints would judge the
[2:04:37] earth not to take a matter to court he
[2:04:39] said because the saints would judge the
[2:04:41] earth
[2:04:42] he said we are at the end time
[2:04:45] and again in 1962
[2:04:48] he said where we are in the end time
[2:04:51] coming from the east and the west the
[2:04:53] north the south
[2:04:55] what are we doing we are getting ready
[2:04:58] for that rapture
[2:05:00] how many are getting ready for the
[2:05:02] rapture
[2:05:06] how many are really on a daily basis
[2:05:08] considering the rapture
[2:05:12] lord
[2:05:15] if the rapture is today i trust lord by
[2:05:17] grace i won't miss it
[2:05:21] i would say most believers around the
[2:05:23] world they don't even stop to consider
[2:05:25] that
[2:05:27] it's just a doctrine oh we believe
[2:05:29] there's going to be a rapture
[2:05:31] no we believe we're being raptured
[2:05:35] we were being raptured
[2:05:37] yes
[2:05:38] because by the by the preaching of the
[2:05:39] word the ministry of the word of the
[2:05:41] holy ghost in the word amen that we are
[2:05:43] being more and more caught up to the
[2:05:45] spiritual things and the word and we're
[2:05:48] less cut into the things of the world
[2:05:52] by the grace of god that's right
[2:05:54] amen brother
[2:05:59] how many are more spiritual
[2:06:01] and less carnal
[2:06:03] how many are more caught up with what
[2:06:04] god's doing and less caught up with
[2:06:06] what's going on in the world
[2:06:11] how many really really
[2:06:13] you live
[2:06:16] the bible says as a pilgrim and a
[2:06:18] stranger
[2:06:20] in the earth
[2:06:26] he said what are we doing he said we are
[2:06:28] getting ready for the rapture
[2:06:30] he said holding ourselves steady for a
[2:06:32] few minutes till every fiber is filled
[2:06:36] with the holy ghost
[2:06:38] then
[2:06:39] she'll go up
[2:06:40] oh my is it calling his people together
[2:06:44] to himself in the true oneness with
[2:06:46] himself because it is one holy spirit he
[2:06:50] said by one spirit are we all
[2:06:53] individually baptized into one body
[2:06:56] collectively the body of jesus christ
[2:07:00] and jesus christ is living with his
[2:07:02] spirit in our flesh
[2:07:04] oh
[2:07:05] he is
[2:07:10] jesus is living with his spirit in your
[2:07:12] flesh
[2:07:12] in your life
[2:07:14] he said and he is serving the church and
[2:07:16] doing the same things he did as an
[2:07:19] ensign to the world that we're in the
[2:07:21] last days getting ready for the rapture
[2:07:26] he said i love him don't you
[2:07:29] god helps to love jesus
[2:07:34] not the world or the things of the world
[2:07:36] but love jesus
[2:07:39] he said i'm looking for him today and if
[2:07:41] he isn't here today i'll be looking for

[2:08:55] of the seals is revealed
[2:08:57] i said they'll be still preaching the
[2:08:59] rapture
[2:09:00] but it'll be over with
[2:09:02] god and they missed him
[2:09:07] yeah
[2:09:08] the prophet god said when that rapture
[2:09:10] takes place he said there's going to be
[2:09:11] a generation there's going to be those
[2:09:13] here and he's still going to say
[2:09:15] they went to the rapture oh yeah he said
[2:09:17] i there was yes i knew there was going
[2:09:19] to be a rapture
[2:09:20] and he says happen
[2:09:22] he said it happened they didn't know it
[2:09:25] the prophet of god said it happened and
[2:09:26] they didn't know it
[2:09:29] god helped us
[2:09:30] that we're going to be well very well
[2:09:32] aware of the rapture
[2:09:35] that we're not going to be left behind
[2:09:38] to recognize something that's happened
[2:09:40] and we've missed it
[2:09:52] he said listen there is not nothing in
[2:09:54] the world can comfort you now but the
[2:09:57] word of god
[2:09:58] that's the truth
[2:10:00] there is no other hopes your nation
[2:10:02] nowhere else
[2:10:04] he said we are worm heaton to the core
[2:10:07] and he said communism has worm heating
[2:10:09] the thing it's got to be that way and
[2:10:12] you ain't going to stop it the bible
[2:10:14] said it was going to be that way and he
[2:10:16] said listen
[2:10:17] get ready for the rapture
[2:10:20] that's the only thing to do
[2:10:23] let's focus on what god's doing
[2:10:36] he said again
[2:10:40] he said listen
[2:10:44] there's a baptism going on here
[2:10:47] all the time
[2:10:49] he said ministers methodists baptists
[2:10:51] presbyterian church of god lutheran
[2:10:54] whatever it is are coming and being
[2:10:56] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[2:10:58] christ
[2:11:00] this is 1964.
[2:11:05] he preached it in jeffersonville
[2:11:08] in his own church
[2:11:15] as i said
[2:11:17] after the bride's gone they were still
[2:11:18] preaching the message
[2:11:20] after right has gone they were still
[2:11:23] god preaching
[2:11:23] a prophet
[2:11:25] yeah
[2:11:28] oh yeah there would still still be
[2:11:30] message churches
[2:11:31] i pray god
[2:11:34] why
[2:11:36] why why is a messy church can be left
[2:11:38] like that because they become
[2:11:39] denominations denominated
[2:11:42] you got a denominational spirit
[2:11:47] they don't have the hunger they don't
[2:11:48] have the thirst
[2:11:50] for the resurrection and the rapture
[2:11:51] they just got as part of their doctrine
[2:11:53] they believe there's going to be a
[2:11:54] resurrection believe there's going to be
[2:11:55] a rapture amen but they're going to miss
[2:11:58] it
[2:12:05] he said before god when i have to stand
[2:12:07] at the judgment bar i've got to answer
[2:12:09] for this and if if i was just as clear
[2:12:12] in my thoughts of being justified in
[2:12:14] everything in my life
[2:12:16] he said i'd be ready for the rapture
[2:12:18] right now for i know that is the gospel
[2:12:21] truth the rapture
[2:12:23] god help us
[2:12:28] in 1964 he said this is the third poll
[2:12:31] and he's speaking the word amen it seems
[2:12:35] entirely possible for you to speak the
[2:12:37] word and one would be completely and
[2:12:40] fully restored placed entirely ready for
[2:12:43] the rapture in the resurrection the son
[2:12:46] of man
[2:12:49] and he said and you would do this if you
[2:12:51] if properly pressed upon he said would
[2:12:54] you not escape all these things
[2:12:56] he said amen and stand before the son of
[2:13:00] man
[2:13:01] amen what for for the resurrection for
[2:13:05] the rapture
[2:13:06] amen
[2:13:07] brother
[2:13:09] thank god for what he has done when it
[2:13:11] comes to the mysteries and the doctrines
[2:13:14] the corrections here they corrected this
[2:13:15] corrected that but brother
[2:13:18] thank god for that
[2:13:20] but
[2:13:22] what's the purpose in doing what he did
[2:13:25] the purpose was to get us away from
[2:13:26] those things and to get us into the
[2:13:28] revelation of the word regarding the
[2:13:30] rapture but there's too many stutters
[2:13:32] just focusing on doctrine
[2:13:34] they're focusing on this doctrine that
[2:13:36] doctrine like the the trinity and and
[2:13:39] this one and that one and the water
[2:13:40] baptism and this one and
[2:13:42] we should preach it yes and highlight it
[2:13:45] yes
[2:13:46] but not keep focusing on it keep
[2:13:47] focusing on keep knowing why because god
[2:13:50] did that to bring us into a greater
[2:13:52] revelation of the rapture
[2:13:55] amen god did that what for to move us
[2:13:58] away from this and what for to get us
[2:14:01] ready for the rapture
[2:14:05] amen
[2:14:06] but there's too many focusing on the
[2:14:07] doctrine this doctrine this doctrine
[2:14:09] this doctrine but brother god didn't
[2:14:12] mean for us to do that not to focus on
[2:14:14] it
[2:14:15] god ordained for that that faith that
[2:14:17] revelation that revelation another of
[2:14:19] another revelation to give us the faith
[2:14:21] for what god is doing
[2:14:25] the purpose of why is god doing this why
[2:14:27] is god doing that
[2:14:28] well number one he did this in luther
[2:14:31] because he wanted he wanted to bring
[2:14:32] them to the revelation of justification
[2:14:35] and he wanted to bring them to the
[2:14:37] revelation of sanctification or
[2:14:40] and he wanted to bring to the revelation
[2:14:42] of the baptism of the holy ghost the
[2:14:43] gifts of the spirit amen but then he
[2:14:46] sent the messenger
[2:14:48] to give us the faith for the
[2:14:49] resurrection and the rapture
[2:14:52] and there was that generation that
[2:14:55] didn't think they needed it
[2:14:59] no they didn't think they needed that
[2:15:01] that that message or the messenger of
[2:15:03] prophet no they felt oh we're
[2:15:05] pentecostal god's blessings with the
[2:15:06] holy ghost so we won't miss the reverend
[2:15:09] we won't miss the rap she won't miss the
[2:15:10] resurrection we got the holy ghost
[2:15:12] we got the gifts of the spirit
[2:15:16] no
[2:15:17] they missed it
[2:15:19] grace of god to us
[2:15:24] he said listen
[2:15:28] you young people
[2:15:29] and or he said you old
[2:15:33] you god help you friends
[2:15:36] this is the hour
[2:15:38] if you haven't got the holy ghost
[2:15:39] receive it now
[2:15:41] for those that are in christ will god
[2:15:43] bring with him the rest of them will go
[2:15:45] under the judgment
[2:15:47] but he said if you are not in christ
[2:15:49] tonight hear my word
[2:15:51] for only those that are in christ will
[2:15:54] go in the rapture
[2:16:01] brother
[2:16:03] is christ in you and you in christ

[2:16:30] rapture amen

[2:16:40] healer

[2:16:43] god's attitude towards the people to get
[2:16:46] you people back to believe in god
[2:16:48] because he said if you haven't got faith

[2:25:45] oh
[2:25:46] 1956 he did make this statement
[2:25:49] statement
[2:25:53] concerning the rapture
[2:25:57] he said how do you know the rapture is
[2:25:59] not going on all the time
[2:26:04] first thing you know it'll be past
[2:26:06] and one disappearing here and one
[2:26:08] disappearing there it'll be gone and the
[2:26:11] first thing you know judgment will
[2:26:13] strike the world
[2:26:15] amen
[2:26:16] remember they didn't know it until the
[2:26:18] day they entered into the ark
[2:26:21] and then it was too late
[2:26:24] he said the foolish virgin didn't know
[2:26:26] until she come back and found the wise
[2:26:28] virgin gone
[2:26:30] and then she was left for the
[2:26:32] tribulation period
[2:26:34] god help us amen
[2:26:37] to get ready
[2:26:39] amen
[2:26:40] the bride is forgiven
[2:26:42] and she's going straight to glory in a
[2:26:46] rapture
[2:26:47] amen
[2:26:48] it is the secret catching away
[2:26:51] by the grace of god
[2:26:53] amen
[2:26:55] that's just
[2:26:56] again there's still a lot more quotes
[2:26:58] here on the rapture the rapture of the
