[40:14] people this morning bless us each one
[40:16] Lord may your presence your love just so
[40:19] flow through this building heavenly
[40:20] father that it'll change us Lord in a
[40:22] way we've never been changed before Lord
[40:25] let us go out better than we came in
[40:27] Lord let us go out more like you than we
[40:29] came in we pray Lord we're asking these
[40:31] things in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[40:35] amen God bless you this morning turn if
[40:37] you would to 1 Corinthians
[40:39] 13 amen good to see brother Gerald and
[40:41] sister Betty back with us amen God's
[40:44] mercies to them as they traveled and
[40:46] Blanca and the boys made it to
[40:47] California safely yesterday with minimal
[40:49] delays so we thank the Lord for that and
[40:51] they're enjoying the sunshine and warmth
[40:53] while we enjoy the well the the warm
[40:56] warmth and the wind amen but uh
[40:59] certainly glad that they've made it safe
[41:00] and trusting the Lord will continue to
[41:02] be with them spoke with Brother David
[41:03] Nash this morning he sent some pictures
[41:05] so I just added them to the slides
[41:06] quickly this morning this was a they did
[41:08] a a TV he preached on TV there and
[41:11] that's the green screen they fill it in
[41:13] with something else when he's when he's
[41:14] preaching but he spoke and they enjoyed
[41:16] it enough that they asked him to come
[41:17] back and preach again so he did two uh
[41:19] television uh broadcast for his
[41:21] preaching then he went to katakam and
[41:24] this is a a new church that they've just
[41:26] built there and I commented on it to him
[41:27] I said that's a pretty nice church for
[41:29] for where they are there and and he said
[41:31] yes he says that's the new building they
[41:33] have and then he sent me this he said
[41:34] and that's the old building and they
[41:36] built the new building around the old
[41:37] building and so that they wouldn't be
[41:39] disrupted at all cuz it in there they
[41:41] don't have money to do it all at one
[41:42] time so they literally sometimes they'll
[41:44] buy one two 3 four five bricks at a time
[41:47] put them up and then they go on and they
[41:49] they save up some more and they build it
[41:50] up so they kept the old church inside
[41:52] the new church and then built up the
[41:53] whole new church all the way around it
[41:55] and then he shared with the brothers
[41:57] it's a a brother uh Eli the pastor and
[42:00] then a brother Eric who's a pastor in
[42:01] the middle in the translator and then
[42:03] brother Eric's father there is the
[42:04] driver that that takes them around and
[42:06] whatnot so he said this was last year
[42:08] and he says they grown and and they so
[42:10] they had to build a new building so
[42:11] that's what it looked like beforehand
[42:13] then he sent me this one at uh pomaro
[42:16] pomarola and this was a full house that
[42:18] they had there and so he he just wanted
[42:20] to share kind of what it looks like
[42:22] there when they're when they're
[42:23] preaching and then he had a wedding and
[42:25] preached two services as well so uh on
[42:28] that day so uh God he just wanted to
[42:30] share that with the church so you can
[42:31] see of course we supported him in this
[42:32] Honduras trip and he just wanted us to
[42:35] to see what he's doing and what the
[42:36] conditions are like and the people he's
[42:38] dealing with and those different things
[42:39] so he sends his greetings and his
[42:41] appreciation this morning he's
[42:42] ministering a couple Services again
[42:44] today Lord willing amen let's turn to
[42:47] the scriptures now to 1 Corinthians 13
[42:49] chapter 8
[42:50] and we're continuing with the same
[42:52] thought as the last couple of services
[42:54] Paul said charity never fath but whether
[42:57] there be prophecies they shall fail
[42:59] whether there be tongues they shall
[43:01] cease whether there be knowledge it
[43:03] shall vanish away for we know in part
[43:05] and we prophesy in part but when that
[43:08] which is perfect is come then that which
[43:10] is in part shall be done away when I was
[43:12] a child I spake as a child I understood
[43:15] as a child I thought as a child as a
[43:17] child there's nothing mature that's what
[43:20] makes you a child as there's no maturity
[43:21] in there he says but when I became a man
[43:24] I put away childish things amen God
[43:26] bless you you can have your seats this
[43:28] morning and we're taking a third and
[43:30] final service on this thought of coming
[43:32] into Perfection and and I want to kind
[43:34] of start off just where we finished last
[43:35] service and we looked at these the we've
[43:38] looked at these attributes that Peter
[43:39] talked about that that would make us
[43:41] brother Bram said a dwelling place for
[43:42] God and the first seven of Faith all the
[43:45] way through brotherly kindness they're
[43:46] in you because you're a child of God and
[43:48] we have them in varying measures you
[43:50] know you look around this church and you
[43:51] look around your family and you look
[43:53] around Believers you know and there's
[43:54] some people have more than others but
[43:56] each one of us has exactly the amount
[43:58] that God has ordained for us to be where
[44:00] we are and the position we're in there's
[44:02] some places you know if you're if you're
[44:03] a mother you got to have a lot of
[44:05] patience and you'll see mothers have a
[44:07] lot more patience than the fathers many
[44:09] times because they're with the kids all
[44:10] day and when you're dealing with
[44:11] children all day you need patience the
[44:13] fathers are usually out dealing with
[44:15] adults and so maybe it's not not so
[44:17] necessary but then you get into things
[44:18] like wisdom and and knowledge in these
[44:20] things well maybe the father has it more
[44:22] or maybe a minister would have it more
[44:24] than a member of the lady or maybe a a
[44:26] Deacon would have it more than another
[44:27] brother in these different things but
[44:29] each one of us has it by the working of
[44:30] the holy spirit in our life for the
[44:32] condition we're in for the place we're
[44:34] in for the purpose we're in and so we
[44:36] don't look and say well why do they have
[44:37] more than I God's given you what you
[44:39] have need of and he gives them what they
[44:40] have need of and sufficient for the day
[44:42] is what he's given us amen but but it's
[44:44] the working of the Holy Spirit to draw
[44:46] those things out of us we don't have the
[44:48] Holy Spirit when we have those
[44:49] necessarily but it's to draw them out of
[44:52] us and to prepare us now for the
[44:53] dwelling place of God but as we said
[44:55] said last service and the service before
[44:57] when when we come to that eighth
[44:58] attribute this charity this agape love
[45:00] this Divine love this isn't an attribute
[45:03] but this is now a person this is a life
[45:05] this is a personality that's inside of
[45:07] us and so we don't we don't have that
[45:09] we've got to get it and when Paul said
[45:11] to add it to you you don't get to add it
[45:13] as if it's it's something that you can
[45:15] develop in yourself but it's something
[45:16] you got to receive you don't earn it but
[45:18] you can receive it it's it's not it's a
[45:20] it's a free gift that's given to us it's
[45:22] not something that that we're owed in
[45:24] any way but we've got to follow a path
[45:26] to get it amen acts 238 is the simple
[45:28] path that we're supposed to follow
[45:30] repent be baptized and you shall receive
[45:33] the gift of the Holy Ghost amen and it
[45:35] reminds me we talked about Revelation 3
[45:38] where there's a people in this age and
[45:40] it's it's our age that think they're
[45:41] rich and increase with goods and have
[45:43] need of nothing and the prophet of the
[45:45] age the seventh angel speaking by the
[45:47] holy spirit is to remind them you don't
[45:50] have anything you're miserable you're
[45:52] poor you're wretched you're blind and
[45:53] naked and the worst thing is that you
[45:55] don't even know your condition that's
[45:57] why the prophet had to come was not to
[45:59] tell you your condition but to let you
[46:00] know you don't even understand you're in
[46:02] that condition and to try and open their
[46:04] eyes so they could see their condition
[46:06] and then what follows after that is
[46:07] zealous repentance not just repentance
[46:10] but zealous repentance to really be
[46:12] serious about it you know I remember
[46:14] when I gave my heart to the Lord and it
[46:15] was a zealous repentance because even
[46:18] being raised in a message uh family and
[46:20] a message church and these different
[46:22] things you're raised around the truth
[46:23] you think that you're all right but when
[46:25] you come into to the presence of God
[46:27] that first time in true repentance all
[46:29] you can say is I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[46:32] sorry I was wrong I am wrong there's
[46:35] nothing here I had didn't have what I
[46:38] thought I had and then all I could say
[46:41] in that presence was forgive me forgive
[46:44] me you couldn't even raise your hand
[46:46] couldn't even raise your eyes you
[46:47] couldn't even raise your head because
[46:48] you were so aware of your own inability
[46:52] to get anything right that's the way it
[46:54] was amen and that's the way we we've got
[46:56] to come today is is with a zealous
[46:59] repentance because otherwise we'll get
[47:00] stuck in Tradition you can be in
[47:03] Tradition in a message church you can be
[47:05] stuck in the teachings of man in a
[47:06] message church you can get stuck in cold
[47:09] formality in a CH Message Church being
[47:11] in a message church is not what makes us
[47:14] a member of the Bride but having the
[47:16] message living in Us in the person of
[47:18] Christ The Living Word for our day
[47:20] that's what makes us a member of the
[47:21] Bride of Jesus Christ
[47:23] amen amen when we can recog I we're
[47:26] nothing that we bring nothing to the
[47:28] table except a vessel all we are is a
[47:32] vessel and it's up to him to turn it
[47:33] into a vessel of Glory and Honor and
[47:36] these different things but I want to
[47:38] take us back to our opening scriptures
[47:39] we settle into this thought this morning
[47:41] and Paul said this charity never faileth
[47:45] but whether there be prophecies they
[47:46] shall fail whether there be tongues they
[47:48] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[47:50] it shall vanish away and we know that
[47:52] this agape love this charity is
[47:54] Supernatural because it never fails and
[47:57] we spent time in the last Services
[47:59] talking about man's failures and
[48:00] everything we do still fails everything
[48:03] we make still corrodes and rusts and
[48:06] breaks and fractures and it's uncertain
[48:09] and we don't know when it's going to
[48:10] fail all we know is that it's going to
[48:12] fail you know it's amazing how you can
[48:14] be driving your car for 150 or 200,000
[48:18] kilomet and nothing's going wrong and
[48:20] then it seems like in a day you've got5
[48:22] or $10,000 in repairs why because men's
[48:25] things break doesn't matter how well it
[48:28] was put together doesn't matter the
[48:30] level of quality control whatever man
[48:32] comes up with it's got flaws it's it's
[48:35] got an it's got a finite life to it and
[48:37] things fail and they break amen but
[48:39] there's only one thing that never fails
[48:41] and that's Divine love because what it's
[48:43] the Living Word Christ in you that's
[48:45] what makes it not fail is that it's
[48:47] Christ The Living Word remember the
[48:49] scripture says in Matthew 24 it says
[48:51] Heaven and Earth shall pass away that
[48:54] means everything from the heavens and
[48:55] and the Earth will pass away but it says
[48:57] but my words shall not pass away so when
[49:01] we come into this Capstone of of Charity
[49:04] when we're sealed by the Holy Spirit
[49:05] we're not coming so much to Perfection
[49:07] but Perfection is coming to us amen it's
[49:10] a person of Christ that's coming to us
[49:12] because nothing in my life nothing in my
[49:14] hand I bring only to thy cross I cling
[49:16] we read those words last service amen
[49:18] the simple fact is that God makes
[49:20] himself small enough that we could
[49:22] actually receive him makes himself small
[49:24] enough that we could accept him and
[49:26] understand him in a way that makes him
[49:28] live inside of our lives that we can
[49:30] that he can be revealed to us and he can
[49:32] pour himself into us and he can actually
[49:34] manifest himself through us in our
[49:37] little lives in our little vessels in
[49:38] these Earthly vessels that we have what
[49:41] a thought this morning can you imagine
[49:43] think this morning the great Eternal God
[49:47] if you've got the Holy Spirit has made
[49:48] him SM self small enough to live inside
[49:50] of
[49:51] you I I don't think we understand this
[49:54] morning what we have in inside of us if
[49:56] we've got the Holy Ghost it is the great
[49:58] Eternal Jehovah living inside of us this
[50:01] morning and we're going to get into what
[50:03] that means in the next couple of
[50:04] services about what it means when he's
[50:06] on the inside when you've got a strong
[50:09] man in the house when you've got the
[50:11] great Eternal God living inside of you
[50:13] resident in this domain what is possible
[50:17] what is possible for you and what is
[50:18] possible for those that you come in
[50:20] contact amen but Paul says after this
[50:23] charity though it never fails he says
[50:25] but right now we know in
[50:27] part and we prophesy in part he's not
[50:31] saying we don't have knowledge he's not
[50:33] saying we don't have prophecy he's
[50:34] saying we don't have preaching in
[50:36] fullness but we've got it we've got a
[50:38] portion we've got these things you know
[50:40] and as we come up to this charity
[50:42] everything we've had to this point is a
[50:44] foretaste it's a shadow it's a spoonful
[50:47] of the great picture of the great water
[50:49] that's available to us it's just a
[50:51] little bit he says you've got something
[50:53] good am mean this is a whole process of
[50:55] God and if God's working in your life
[50:57] and you don't have the Holy Ghost and
[50:58] you know you don't have the Holy Ghost
[51:00] don't don't ignore the little things
[51:02] that God's doing in your life there's
[51:04] great things that are that are going on
[51:05] in a person's life when they come to
[51:07] Christ and they receive salvation amen
[51:09] there's deliverances there's Miracles
[51:11] there's provision you know you look at
[51:13] the the life of the Apostles and the the
[51:16] disciples and before they ever got the
[51:17] Holy Ghost there were signs and wonders
[51:19] and healings and great demonstrations of
[51:22] of God in their life but it's all in
[51:25] part it was all in part Peter had it in
[51:30] part he had wonderful things but he had
[51:32] it in part and Peter kept failing he
[51:35] kept failing why because he didn't have
[51:37] it in full but you'll find when Peter
[51:40] comes in full now when he gets the Holy
[51:42] Ghost and things change in Peter's life
[51:43] and he never he never goes back on those
[51:45] things Paul's saying until we get
[51:47] charity until we get Divine love until
[51:49] we get the Holy Ghost everything we have
[51:52] is in part it's a bit it might be
[51:57] 95% it might be
[51:59] 95% remember brother Braham said he says
[52:02] those those those um those make
[52:03] Believers they'll walk right up to
[52:05] Jordan they'll do the entire Journey but
[52:08] they won't Cross Jordan into Canaan 95%
[52:11] 99% of the way there they might have had
[52:14] 100t 150 200 ft to cross of water at
[52:17] that time and they stopped short having
[52:20] walked maybe hundreds and thousands of
[52:22] miles in the desert over 40 years they
[52:24] stopped short over the last couple
[52:25] hundred feet they won't go in brother
[52:27] bam says they see the Holy Spirit they
[52:29] see the full word and they refuse it to
[52:31] go back to where they're comfortable
[52:33] amen but brother Brandon would go so far
[52:35] as to say until you get the Holy Ghost
[52:37] things are out of order you might have
[52:39] everything but it's out of order it's
[52:42] not in the place it's supposed to be
[52:43] it's not set up why because they're
[52:45] perfect gifts and we're going to get
[52:46] into this in a bit they're perfect gifts
[52:48] and perfect gifts need a perfect one to
[52:50] operate them and guess what I'm not the
[52:52] perfect one and unfortunately you're not
[52:53] the perfect one either so we've got to
[52:55] have somebody else come into US amen the
[52:57] problem with having something that is
[52:59] not not not that is in part is that it
[53:01] never just works right do you ever see
[53:03] in Canadian Tire or Princess Auto
[53:05] they'll have a a rack there that's got
[53:08] parts or or or things that are written
[53:10] down marked down they'll give you 50%
[53:12] off and they'll say missing this part
[53:15] and if you know anything about that that
[53:17] instrument or that that that tool you
[53:19] know it won't work without the part so
[53:22] it's worth nothing without that part but
[53:23] they're willing to give it to you at 50
[53:25] % off in the hopes that you don't
[53:26] realize because it says as is where is
[53:28] no returns no nothing they're hoping
[53:30] that you think you can make that thing
[53:31] work the way it's supposed to even
[53:33] though it doesn't have a critical part
[53:35] and you know what happens when you buy
[53:37] something or you have something that
[53:38] isn't quite the way it's meant to be it
[53:40] never works right you know what we do
[53:43] don't we brother Matt we jury rig it we
[53:45] jury rig it and the whole time you're
[53:47] using something that's jury rigged I'm
[53:49] seeing some smiles here I think some of
[53:50] us have spouses that jury rig from time
[53:52] to time when you jury rig it you're
[53:54] always waiting for it to break for it to
[53:57] snap for it to fail for it to cause
[53:59] damage cuz you know you know it's not
[54:03] right you know it's not right and all
[54:07] you're doing is hoping it holds on long
[54:09] enough to get the job done so you can
[54:11] get it out of the way turn it off unplug
[54:12] it or do whatever it is you need to do
[54:14] throw it out maybe the case is you're
[54:16] just trying to get it there you're just
[54:17] trying to get it to do what you need it
[54:19] to do but the thing is we're in a walk
[54:21] to eternal life and it's not going to
[54:23] work with a jury riged life it's got to
[54:25] have the full picture it's got to have
[54:28] the full assembly there amen amen we
[54:30] talked about La last service how Paul
[54:32] realized early on that charity never
[54:34] fails and he said everything I had all
[54:36] the knowledge I had it was but dun I'm
[54:38] bringing nothing to the table amen and
[54:41] Paul knew his ways weren't perfect Paul
[54:42] knew that he would fail Paul knew that
[54:44] he had faults but Paul realized early on
[54:47] that it's got to be Christ that lives in
[54:48] me we read that scripture in Galatians
[54:50] where he said I'm crucified with Christ
[54:52] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[54:54] lived liveth in me and the life which I
[54:56] now live in the flesh I live by the
[54:58] faith of the Son of God Paul knew Paul
[55:00] was the weak link Paul knew that he was
[55:03] a thing that was going to hold back the
[55:05] working of God in his life and if he
[55:07] could get himself out of the way then
[55:08] God could work in him in a proper way
[55:10] amen we're talking about a dwelling
[55:12] place for God this whole series is on
[55:14] being the dwelling place of God and the
[55:16] simple truth is until God comes in and
[55:18] seals this house the house is open for
[55:22] visitors listen God can come into an
[55:25] unbeliever life he can absolutely he can
[55:28] we see it but guess what Satan can too
[55:33] demons can too because what the house is
[55:35] not
[55:37] sealed anybody can walk in and use it
[55:40] demons live rentree in a lot of homes
[55:42] today if I can put it that way in a lot
[55:43] of bodies and a lot of Lives why because
[55:46] their soul is not sealed but until it's
[55:49] sealed then I can have
[55:52] control and that's as bad as a demon
[55:55] cuz I'm in a fallen condition so until
[55:58] I'm sealed until this Capstone of love
[56:00] comes down then there's going to be
[56:02] problems because the house is not full
[56:04] the house is not complete it doesn't
[56:06] have what we need we need Christ The
[56:07] Living Word inside of us and if we don't
[56:09] then failure is inevitable brother Brown
[56:11] would put it this way he says let God
[56:14] add to the church let God give to the
[56:17] church see those gifts are in the church
[56:19] right in here this morning there Gifts
[56:20] of speaking in tongues there's Gifts of
[56:22] Prophecy there's Gifts of everything
[56:24] setting in here in here today he's not
[56:28] just talking to them in every Church of
[56:30] True Believers the gifts are
[56:32] available he says but if you'll just not
[56:34] go to hanging after that gift he says if
[56:37] you do you're going to get the gift
[56:38] without the giver see the thing of it is
[56:42] seek after
[56:43] God and then he says seek after love of
[56:46] God in your heart and then as God wants
[56:49] you he'll move you into whatever he
[56:51] wants you to do see that's it he says
[56:54] that's how the church is put in
[56:56] order then he says so friends find
[57:00] Divine love and favor with God then God
[57:05] if he finds favor with you will give his
[57:07] gifts unto you but first find The Giver
[57:10] seek the giver and then the gifts will
[57:12] come as God sees fit to give it to you
[57:14] do you believe that he says so now when
[57:16] you go around like this and different
[57:18] people are seeking all night for gifts
[57:19] and things like that he says go back
[57:22] till you find love he says till you
[57:25] shake hands with your brother across the
[57:27] street then then we'll talk about more
[57:29] more about getting gifts in that's right
[57:31] when you love the love when you get the
[57:34] love of God in your heart then you talk
[57:36] about gifts you say brother John I want
[57:39] spoken word Authority I want third pole
[57:42] I want signs and wonders I want Miracles
[57:44] get Divine
[57:45] love because without Divine love the
[57:48] only thing that will operate those gifts
[57:50] is you and that will cause them to fail
[57:54] amen and you'll just just make a bigger
[57:55] mess Paul had experienced the Living God
[57:57] and a God that dwell in him and he's
[57:59] bringing this great Revelation to us and
[58:01] he's saying what you have is good but
[58:04] it's still imp part until the god of
[58:05] those gifts comes inside of you and
[58:07] starts to operate them amen if you don't
[58:09] have the giver then the gifts are of no
[58:12] use because you'll turn them into
[58:14] edifying instead of edifying the body
[58:16] you'll start to edify yourself we're
[58:18] selfish creatures unregenerated we
[58:20] beasts and beasts are
[58:23] selfish beasts are selfish
[58:25] and that's what happens to us every time
[58:26] amen unless God lives in us the gifts
[58:29] will never be perfect or mature that's
[58:32] what that word Perfection means it means
[58:34] it means it means complete or whole amen
[58:37] James said
[58:38] this do not Heir my beloved Brethren he
[58:41] says don't make a
[58:42] mistake he says don't don't be mistaken
[58:45] every good gift and every perfect gift
[58:48] is from Above That Word Perfect means
[58:51] mature complete full grown
[58:55] honorable you know what that tells me it
[58:57] tells me there can be an immature gift
[58:59] then there can be an imperfect
[59:02] gift he says and it cometh down from the
[59:05] Father of Lights with whom is no
[59:06] variableness neither shadow of turning
[59:09] now notice the gifts are good and
[59:11] perfect but the Perfection is in The
[59:13] Giver of the gifts not in the gifts
[59:15] themselves he says he explains the the
[59:17] Perfection of the father because the
[59:19] Father of Lights he says there's no
[59:21] variableness there's no changing and
[59:23] then he says there's no sh shadow of
[59:25] turning it means there's no darkness in
[59:27] God and nothing can cast a shadow on God
[59:30] nothing can cast a shadow on the
[59:33] sun the sun will pass light over
[59:36] something else and that will cast a
[59:38] shadow on something else but you can't
[59:39] cast a shadow across the source of light
[59:42] try putting take a light bulb and try
[59:43] and cast a shadow over a light you can't
[59:46] do it you can cover it up you can
[59:49] surround it with something but the light
[59:51] never gets a shadow because it's the
[59:52] source of light a shadow means there is
[59:54] no light he says in God there is nothing
[59:57] that can overshadow him there's nothing
[59:59] that can change him amen he's the source
[1:00:02] of all light there's nothing can put God
[1:00:03] Into Darkness he says of his own will
[1:00:06] begat he us with the word of Truth so we
[1:00:09] were created we were be birth we were
[1:00:11] born by the word of truth and that's why
[1:00:13] we are what we are cuz it was true and
[1:00:16] so what comes out of it is truth as well
[1:00:18] amen we come from truth we're living in
[1:00:20] truth and we are Truth for the world to
[1:00:22] see how by the word of God God living in
[1:00:25] us the word of Truth is living out
[1:00:26] inside of us he said of his own will
[1:00:28] beat us with the word of truth that we
[1:00:30] should be a kind of first fruits of his
[1:00:33] creatures a specific kind is what that
[1:00:35] means cuz we're the only kind like us
[1:00:39] there's no other children of God except
[1:00:42] us he says you're showing something in
[1:00:45] these perfect gifts he says now
[1:00:47] wherefore my beloved Brethren let every
[1:00:50] man be swift to hear slow to speak and
[1:00:54] slow to wrath so James pointing out God
[1:00:57] is the author of every good gift every
[1:00:59] perfect gift every mature gift but as we
[1:01:02] said there there are not just good gifts
[1:01:04] but that means there must be not good
[1:01:06] gifts and there must be immature gifts
[1:01:08] as well as mature gifts because if you
[1:01:11] don't have God that's what happens is
[1:01:13] you're going to have imperfection there
[1:01:15] we'll talk on those a bit later in the
[1:01:16] series when we we talk about being
[1:01:18] fitted into the body of Christ but make
[1:01:20] no mistake there is such thing as an
[1:01:21] imperfect gift and I'm going to tell
[1:01:23] talk about myself even this morning
[1:01:24] morning about what that looks like but
[1:01:27] Paul says this he says but when that
[1:01:29] which is perfect is come then that which
[1:01:32] is imp part shall be done away with that
[1:01:33] means there's a time for the impart and
[1:01:35] then there's a time for the
[1:01:37] perfect
[1:01:39] amen there's a time of growing and then
[1:01:43] there's a time of maturity there's a
[1:01:45] time of development and then there's a
[1:01:47] time of perfection you can't come to
[1:01:49] perfection without the development time
[1:01:52] you can't come to perfection without the
[1:01:53] impart time time and I think it's the
[1:01:56] greatest danger we have in the message
[1:01:57] is that we're preaching perfection
[1:01:59] without reminding the people that
[1:02:00] there's an inart time as well we we look
[1:02:03] at you know we've heard it so many times
[1:02:05] over this Pulpit from Brother Gerald and
[1:02:06] he talk about Luther and justification
[1:02:08] and Wesley with sanctification and we
[1:02:10] put that back in those days but that's
[1:02:13] not what happens we've got to go through
[1:02:15] the exact same thing just cuz we're at
[1:02:17] the peak cuz we're at the Pinnacle at
[1:02:19] the Capstone does not mean we don't go
[1:02:20] through the entire process we've got to
[1:02:22] go through that entire thing and because
[1:02:24] we we have an understanding of what the
[1:02:26] word is doing and where God's going and
[1:02:28] how he's done things we think that we
[1:02:30] can just jump to Perfection but we've
[1:02:31] got to go through the impart to get to
[1:02:33] the perfect that's why I Don't Preach
[1:02:36] from 1963 John word only CU that's the
[1:02:40] Perfection point but everything leading
[1:02:42] up to that was the impart point and
[1:02:44] there's truth there and there's growth
[1:02:46] there and there's a development that's
[1:02:47] going on there and you've got to go
[1:02:48] through the same path that that prophet
[1:02:50] of God did that Paul went through that
[1:02:52] Peter went through that all of them went
[1:02:53] through to come to a place of perfection
[1:02:55] to come to a place of maturity to come
[1:02:57] to a place of adoption we don't get to
[1:02:59] skip to the end because we're in the end
[1:03:01] time age but rather we have an
[1:03:03] accelerated growth through that to get
[1:03:05] us to what rapturing condition in about
[1:03:07] 70 years give or take
[1:03:11] amen but I want to talk about this this
[1:03:13] part that when that was it perfect is
[1:03:16] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:03:17] away because I I'm going to talk about
[1:03:19] my own life because I believe I'm called
[1:03:20] to preach I believe that God has given
[1:03:23] me a gift to minister to the people of
[1:03:25] God I believe I'm anointed to do it and
[1:03:27] that's something I never wanted and I
[1:03:28] definitely never
[1:03:29] expected but let me say this did you
[1:03:32] know that I preach at
[1:03:34] work I
[1:03:36] do I I'm asked to speak on a regular
[1:03:38] basis both regionally both nationally
[1:03:41] and and when I do those things I'm using
[1:03:44] the gift of
[1:03:46] preaching amen and because we got to
[1:03:48] realize when it comes to preaching
[1:03:50] there's two elements there's a gift to
[1:03:52] present
[1:03:53] information and that's one element and
[1:03:55] the second is the gift to be
[1:03:58] yielded it's two things because you have
[1:04:01] to study remember what the apostles did
[1:04:03] they studied and prayed that was that
[1:04:06] was why they brought in De deacons so
[1:04:08] they could study and pray you I I was
[1:04:10] talking I won't I won't name names but I
[1:04:12] was talking to some ministers and you
[1:04:14] know or a minister and and and they said
[1:04:16] you know you you can't go up there with
[1:04:18] notes you you you can't go up there with
[1:04:20] an idea of what you're going to say
[1:04:23] because the anointing is going to tell
[1:04:24] what to
[1:04:25] say Well then why did the apostles have
[1:04:27] to study and
[1:04:30] pray because you got to have something
[1:04:32] that
[1:04:34] outflows something's got to build up
[1:04:36] this has to be quickened but unless you
[1:04:38] read it what's going to be quickened
[1:04:40] without this the only thing that be
[1:04:42] quickened are my thoughts and what does
[1:04:43] that do it leads the people to death so
[1:04:46] you got to come with a thought the
[1:04:47] prophet of God would come to the pulpit
[1:04:49] with a set of notes whether he got
[1:04:51] through them or
[1:04:52] not that was up to to the Lord but he
[1:04:55] would come up with those things so you
[1:04:57] got to study and you got to prepare and
[1:04:58] you got to have something there so
[1:05:00] there's a gift to
[1:05:02] prepare and then there's a gift to
[1:05:04] deliver and the gift to deliver has to
[1:05:07] be him not
[1:05:09] me that's where the real gift is but
[1:05:11] when I'm at work I can speak as if I'm
[1:05:14] preaching and I I I've realized what's
[1:05:17] going on and I know it sounds weird but
[1:05:19] I just relax when I get into speaking
[1:05:22] mode and I I had to do a national um
[1:05:26] presentation here not too long ago and
[1:05:28] there's a director on the team and we
[1:05:29] were going through the the slide deck in
[1:05:31] that and she said she she expressed
[1:05:33] uncertainty about what I had there
[1:05:36] because most people when they do a
[1:05:37] PowerPoint presentation they load it up
[1:05:39] with text they put all this information
[1:05:42] on there one I know that's not effective
[1:05:44] but two that's not the way I work and so
[1:05:46] I had minimal text on there and she
[1:05:48] expressed uncertainty but she said it's
[1:05:50] your presentation you do what you want
[1:05:52] so I did and I spoke and she listen to
[1:05:54] the whole thing then afterwards we had a
[1:05:56] conversation she said Jonathan I don't
[1:05:58] know how you do it but it just works she
[1:06:01] said I didn't think it was going to work
[1:06:02] well based on how you'd set it up it
[1:06:04] wasn't going to work but she said it
[1:06:05] just works why because I'm using my gift
[1:06:08] I literally I I I know exactly what's
[1:06:10] going on when I do it I know exactly
[1:06:13] what's going on when I do it
[1:06:15] amen but that's the imperfect cuz that's
[1:06:18] just me with a gift and I've had it for
[1:06:22] a long time if even through high school
[1:06:24] and in the University I wanton an award
[1:06:26] in University for speaking but that's
[1:06:29] not the gift of
[1:06:31] preaching that's a gift of
[1:06:33] speaking but a gift of preaching is a
[1:06:35] gift of speaking yielded to the holy
[1:06:37] spirit so when I'm at work I'm not
[1:06:38] yielding to the Holy Spirit I believe
[1:06:41] I'm a a holy ghost filled man and I
[1:06:43] believe God can lead and bless me in
[1:06:44] these things but I'm not anointed to
[1:06:46] preach about clean tech that's just my
[1:06:49] job I can get a benefit from the gift
[1:06:53] but that's not the real gift that's the
[1:06:55] imperfect that's the
[1:06:57] impart okay but what happens now is is
[1:07:01] we come up here to to a service and I've
[1:07:04] got my 15 pages of notes you know you
[1:07:07] know what the scariest part of the
[1:07:08] service is for me the first five minutes
[1:07:12] because I don't know where it's going to
[1:07:13] go I I write a I write a paragraph here
[1:07:17] to give myself something to
[1:07:19] say cuz you got to start somewhere but
[1:07:22] then after that I don't know what's
[1:07:24] going to happen now V show back there
[1:07:26] him and I chuckle sometimes because
[1:07:27] he'll look and he'll see I've got 35
[1:07:29] slides and I'm 40 minutes in and I've
[1:07:30] only done 12 and he knows he's off his
[1:07:32] notes and then sometimes I can rip right
[1:07:35] through it that's just the way God does
[1:07:36] it different times but this the the I
[1:07:39] don't want to call it the scariest
[1:07:41] moment but but I would maybe call it the
[1:07:43] the the most curious moment is what's
[1:07:46] going to happen in those first five
[1:07:47] minutes because I'll get up with an idea
[1:07:49] of what what's going to happen and it
[1:07:50] doesn't it doesn't even
[1:07:52] happen and that's why we've got to be
[1:07:54] yielded that's the thing is to yield now
[1:07:58] everything I've done and say Lord here's
[1:08:00] my part this is my part I I've spent the
[1:08:04] time I put in the effort I've marked it
[1:08:08] down I've developed a path of thought
[1:08:10] and idea now you take it and turn it
[1:08:13] into whatever you
[1:08:15] want that's the gift the perfect is the
[1:08:20] yielding
[1:08:22] amen what is it
[1:08:24] it's matured because now instead of me
[1:08:26] using it it's him using it the
[1:08:29] difference between an impart gift an
[1:08:31] immature gift and a perfect gift a
[1:08:33] mature gift is the user not the gift
[1:08:36] it's the user if the perfect one is
[1:08:39] using it it's a perfect gift if the
[1:08:40] mature One is using it it's a mature
[1:08:42] gift but if it's me or you using it what
[1:08:45] is it flawed failed bound to
[1:08:49] selfishness that's the way it works amen
[1:08:51] I I'm not I'm not trying to make myself
[1:08:53] look good here this morning I I I
[1:08:55] consider myself the least of preachers
[1:08:57] you I tell that story about Wendy
[1:08:58] Bagwell and the sunlighter he was a
[1:09:00] gospel uh Christian gospel singer and he
[1:09:04] said Lord give me a great voice you know
[1:09:07] that I can I can you know just just just
[1:09:09] Bless the people and he said and the
[1:09:10] Lord said no but I'll give you an
[1:09:13] audience that doesn't know the
[1:09:15] difference that's the way I look at it
[1:09:17] that's the way I look at it cuz who am I
[1:09:20] I me I know my own inclinations I know
[1:09:22] my my my own of doing things and I've
[1:09:25] said it before when God called me to
[1:09:26] preach I said I don't think this is a
[1:09:28] good idea because of my weaknesses
[1:09:31] because of my inclination my need for
[1:09:33] Perfection my need for practice my my
[1:09:35] need for all of those things to to to to
[1:09:37] come and do the best at things and you
[1:09:40] can't do that in preaching the harder
[1:09:42] you try the worse it gets I imagine it's
[1:09:45] the same for worship for whatever it is
[1:09:47] the more you try and Lead God the worse
[1:09:50] it gets and so that's been a real that's
[1:09:52] been a real test for me it's it's been a
[1:09:54] real growth for me amen the prophet of
[1:09:56] God would bring notes to the to the
[1:09:57] pulpit and how many times would we hear
[1:09:58] him he'd say you know I've got I I'm not
[1:10:00] even a third of the way through I'm on
[1:10:02] page two and I've got 15 and he's three
[1:10:03] hours into a message why a perfect gift
[1:10:07] brother brandham got to the place he had
[1:10:10] a gift to to speak I believe because he
[1:10:11] could bring things in such Simplicity
[1:10:14] it's not hard to understand what brother
[1:10:15] Brandon was preaching amen but that
[1:10:17] second gift was to take that and now be
[1:10:19] used of God and brother BR was so gifted
[1:10:21] that he didn't often even know what he
[1:10:23] was saying
[1:10:24] saying remember when he get into the
[1:10:26] Visions when he get under that specific
[1:10:27] anointing he'd say now was what he said
[1:10:30] true cuz he doesn't even know who he
[1:10:31] said it and if you ever watch the the
[1:10:33] videos of him doing the discernment
[1:10:35] lines he'll say now is this the patient
[1:10:37] is this the patient is this the person
[1:10:39] he doesn't know who went who's come and
[1:10:41] gone in that moment he doesn't know if
[1:10:42] this is a new one the one he just prayed
[1:10:44] for he doesn't know anything because
[1:10:46] he's so completely yielded to the Holy
[1:10:48] Spirit and that's Perfection that's
[1:10:50] maturity and what is it it's total
[1:10:52] surrender to let God use you
[1:10:54] that's what we're talking
[1:10:55] about but I want to take a quick dive
[1:10:57] into this thought on US versus God
[1:11:00] because remember what we read There He
[1:11:01] says when I was a child I spake as a
[1:11:04] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:11:08] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:11:10] away childish things Paul points to
[1:11:12] three elements that are childish I spake
[1:11:14] I understood I thought see now we focus
[1:11:17] on the spake understood and thought but
[1:11:19] the childish is the ey I thought I
[1:11:23] understood I spake that's the thing that
[1:11:27] makes us childish amen it's us using it
[1:11:30] that makes us
[1:11:31] childish and it's when God uses it that
[1:11:33] it steps into maturity brother B talks
[1:11:35] about this he's talking in this is
[1:11:37] church order after the seals he says now
[1:11:40] I'm telling you all see now a few years
[1:11:42] ago you were children with these gifts
[1:11:45] remember the things got out of order in
[1:11:46] the church and they actually had a
[1:11:48] church they had the church split away
[1:11:49] after this because the people with gifts
[1:11:52] didn't want them in order
[1:11:54] they didn't want them in subjection to
[1:11:55] the Holy Spirit real gifts unyielded
[1:11:59] vessels he says you were children with
[1:12:02] these gifts playing back and forth you
[1:12:05] had it therefore you used it he says but
[1:12:08] you've been to a long school now and
[1:12:09] it's time to be men and not use them
[1:12:12] just to play with they gifts they're
[1:12:16] sacred they're of God and you don't play
[1:12:18] with them he says let's let God use them
[1:12:22] that's what your min
[1:12:24] wants to be in other words Perfection is
[1:12:26] when God steps into you and uses you
[1:12:30] uses your gifts uses your life uses your
[1:12:32] access uses your opportunity uses your
[1:12:34] career your job whatever it might be
[1:12:36] when God steps in and using us uses us
[1:12:39] that's when Perfection comes in it's not
[1:12:41] just floating
[1:12:43] around it it's not just happen sense
[1:12:45] it's not just well I can do this
[1:12:47] therefore I will that's not going to
[1:12:49] work he says you've been playing around
[1:12:51] too much he says but now you've been
[1:12:53] through a long school and now you know
[1:12:55] that God's got to set them in order and
[1:12:56] you got to let God start using them and
[1:12:59] how many times a brother Bown say the
[1:13:01] the the spirit of the Prophet is subject
[1:13:02] to the prophet he says you might have a
[1:13:05] gift to speak in tongues but you got to
[1:13:07] be able to hold that until the
[1:13:09] preaching's
[1:13:11] done he's not saying your your your gift
[1:13:13] is not right or real he's saying it's
[1:13:15] got to be put in order and it's the same
[1:13:17] thing for every portion of our life
[1:13:19] every gift we have whether it's tongues
[1:13:21] whether it's helps whether it's
[1:13:22] preaching whether it's laying on of
[1:13:24] hands healing knowledge whatever it
[1:13:25] might be it's got to be put in order
[1:13:28] that God can use it cuz otherwise we get
[1:13:31] ourselves into situations where we ought
[1:13:32] not to be and we tend to make a mess of
[1:13:34] these
[1:13:35] things and man if we can just recognize
[1:13:38] the idea that lord I can't do this so if
[1:13:41] you'll step in it'll work its way out
[1:13:44] cuz charity never faileth amen my wife
[1:13:48] and I I think I've mentioned this before
[1:13:50] we know a man that had a gift of
[1:13:51] discernment and he was a preacher and
[1:13:53] you know you know he used that gift
[1:13:54] regularly in the services and even her
[1:13:55] own family experienced it at times that
[1:13:58] man when he was in university was
[1:13:59] unconverted of course but he still had
[1:14:01] that gift and he knew what everybody was
[1:14:03] holding at the card table you can't beat
[1:14:05] a man that knows every card at the table
[1:14:08] CU he knows when to fold and when to
[1:14:10] hold then he comes into the church and
[1:14:12] he he he has a a salvational experience
[1:14:14] he gives his life to the Lord and he's
[1:14:16] preaching doing all these things but
[1:14:17] what happened eventually was that man
[1:14:19] was not sealed by the Holy Ghost and
[1:14:21] today he's living out in the world and
[1:14:22] he's a dog trainer
[1:14:25] that's
[1:14:26] it it never came to maturity the gift
[1:14:29] never came to maturity and what you
[1:14:31] would see was he started to use it to
[1:14:34] embarrass
[1:14:35] people to put people in a
[1:14:38] corner rather than doing what doing it
[1:14:41] for edification for the glory of God to
[1:14:44] help the
[1:14:45] body brother Brown he's bringing around
[1:14:48] this idea of gifts versus versus a
[1:14:51] surrendered life and a and a life
[1:14:52] according to the word he says so all of
[1:14:55] these little things of jumping up and
[1:14:57] down like a kid trying to talk in
[1:15:02] tongues I mentioned how many many of
[1:15:04] these denominational Services I've kind
[1:15:06] of scanned through in the last time and
[1:15:08] you know what I've under come to realize
[1:15:10] most of them are saying more or less the
[1:15:12] same thing when they speak in tongues
[1:15:14] they have a common thing that they say
[1:15:16] and do and people just say the same
[1:15:17] thing over and over
[1:15:19] again it makes no sense it's just people
[1:15:22] making noise
[1:15:23] noises he says and all these other
[1:15:25] things he says when that which is
[1:15:27] perfect he says and we do have today by
[1:15:30] God's help the perfect interpretation of
[1:15:33] the word with Divine Vindication brother
[1:15:35] say God interprets his word how by
[1:15:38] bringing it to pass that's Divine
[1:15:40] Vindication God comes behind the word
[1:15:42] and he says this is my word and I'll
[1:15:44] show you because I'm here and I'm here
[1:15:46] in your midst and he do signs and
[1:15:47] wonders and signs and wonders and signs
[1:15:49] and wonders and me Perfection can come
[1:15:51] outside of the full word of God we're in
[1:15:54] the Omega Church the alpha church had it
[1:15:57] and they fell away and then we had a
[1:15:58] restoring Prophet came back to us and
[1:16:00] what's he doing he's restoring the full
[1:16:02] word so that we can have the full
[1:16:03] benefit the full effect of that word
[1:16:05] inside of our Lives brother Adam was
[1:16:08] basically saying you you came all the
[1:16:09] way up to the you did the you came to
[1:16:11] the fun part the gifts are the fun part
[1:16:13] that's the blessings the outpouring of
[1:16:15] the spirit on the out outside you can
[1:16:17] come into a service you can shout You
[1:16:19] Can Dance you can see all the effects of
[1:16:21] the spirit of God that's it's fun it's
[1:16:25] fun you go into a service like that and
[1:16:27] you're you come out you're like
[1:16:29] whoa but then you fall flat on your face
[1:16:31] on
[1:16:33] Monday and he says you never came to
[1:16:35] Perfection because you didn't get the
[1:16:37] giver you just got the gifts you got the
[1:16:39] blessings without the
[1:16:41] blesser
[1:16:42] amen but I want to come back to that
[1:16:44] part about I spake I understood and I
[1:16:46] thought because as we come become an
[1:16:48] adult in Christ those things start to
[1:16:50] fall
[1:16:50] away and you start to realize your lack
[1:16:52] of of understanding like we talked about
[1:16:54] job you start to speak less you start to
[1:16:57] listen a bit
[1:16:58] more James said this we just read it
[1:17:01] wherefore my beloved Brethren let every
[1:17:04] man be swift to hear slow to speak slow
[1:17:07] to wrath I've heard it say God gave us
[1:17:09] two ears and one mouth that means we
[1:17:10] should listen twice as much as we
[1:17:12] talk I think that's pretty good for a
[1:17:16] Believer amen listen more talk
[1:17:21] less brother Brown says this I believe
[1:17:23] that every Born Again member of the body
[1:17:26] of Christ is a paradox in themselves I
[1:17:29] believe each one of you Methodist and
[1:17:31] Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had
[1:17:33] experienced the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:34] Spirit was in some formal church that
[1:17:36] did not believe in the genuine New Birth
[1:17:39] and has now received the baptism of the
[1:17:41] Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a
[1:17:45] paradox now don't put it on them you can
[1:17:48] sit in a cold and formal condition in a
[1:17:50] message Church we've got churches where
[1:17:53] all they preach is
[1:17:54] Mysteries and they tend towards colder
[1:17:57] and more formal and then you got ones
[1:17:59] that preach all about the blessings and
[1:18:01] the moving of the Holy Spirit and it's
[1:18:05] hot you can be in any condition in a
[1:18:08] church in a message
[1:18:10] church but watch what he says he says
[1:18:13] but because something happened to you
[1:18:15] that changed your whole being and anyone
[1:18:18] could look at that and know what a
[1:18:20] paradox is a miracle you might be the
[1:18:23] only miracle that people will ever
[1:18:27] see they may never see anything else but
[1:18:30] you and let me tell you if you go in one
[1:18:33] day and you're an unbeliever and you
[1:18:34] come in uh the weekend after or the week
[1:18:37] after and you've had an experience with
[1:18:38] Christ you'll be different and they'll
[1:18:39] say what happened to you and we've seen
[1:18:42] it we've seen it I remember when I got
[1:18:45] baptized and gave my heart to the Lord
[1:18:46] and I went back to school I was
[1:18:48] testifying to everybody everybody knew I
[1:18:50] got baptized and every everybody saw a
[1:18:54] difference but that's got to
[1:18:56] continue not just a one day a one week
[1:18:59] experience but something that continues
[1:19:00] and grows from there on
[1:19:02] in brother Braham says unless that
[1:19:05] happens you cannot be a Christian you
[1:19:07] cannot come to Christ and Christ cannot
[1:19:08] dwell in you and nothing change it makes
[1:19:11] no sense because Perfection has come and
[1:19:14] if nothing changes that meant you
[1:19:15] already were perfect and we know that's
[1:19:18] impossible he says there must be a
[1:19:20] paradox for you to become a Christian
[1:19:22] because no one can change a spirit in a
[1:19:24] man and give him a new birth outside of
[1:19:26] God God Alone is the only one can do it
[1:19:29] he says and it's a miracle how that God
[1:19:31] can take a man's thinking and his ways
[1:19:34] and his life and everything and change
[1:19:37] it from what it was to what it can be
[1:19:41] what he can make it that's the Paradox
[1:19:44] that's the miracle what it was to bring
[1:19:47] it now into its full potential what he
[1:19:49] can make of it I want to add this very
[1:19:52] familiar scripture before we push into
[1:19:53] this a little more Paul said I can do
[1:19:56] all things through Christ which
[1:19:59] strengtheneth me what get out of our
[1:20:01] childish
[1:20:04] behavior slow to speak quick to hear
[1:20:08] slow to
[1:20:10] wrath see we think it's about the big
[1:20:13] things but before the big things happen
[1:20:16] the little things have to happen that's
[1:20:18] it we're we're looking for the
[1:20:20] supernatural without the supernatural
[1:20:23] it's all got to happen inside of here
[1:20:25] first we want the supernatural to be
[1:20:27] operating but in order to for the
[1:20:29] supernatural to operate the natural has
[1:20:31] to die out that's the simple truth the
[1:20:33] natural has to die out for the
[1:20:34] supernatural to have preeminence in our
[1:20:36] life you know when when John had his
[1:20:39] ministry but as soon as Christ comes on
[1:20:40] the scene he says he must increase and I
[1:20:43] must decrease he knew where he stood in
[1:20:45] the equation and it's no different for
[1:20:47] our lives when Christ comes then there
[1:20:49] must be an immediate decrease and a
[1:20:50] continuous decreasing of us so that the
[1:20:52] supernatural can come in brother B puts
[1:20:55] it this way he says God can do without
[1:20:57] you he can do without me but we can't do
[1:21:00] without him we've got to have him for he
[1:21:02] is life and he alone not to know his
[1:21:05] book not to know this or know that or
[1:21:06] know the Creed but to know him as life
[1:21:08] know him as the person Christ in you the
[1:21:12] word made flesh in you the key there is
[1:21:15] made flesh because otherwise it can be
[1:21:17] up here and we think we've got it but
[1:21:19] it's got to be manifested every
[1:21:21] revelation God gives us is for
[1:21:24] manifestation it's to change us not just
[1:21:27] to know but to be that's what we're
[1:21:29] looking at he says that's knowing him
[1:21:31] when he you and he become one like I
[1:21:34] said last night in the super sign he has
[1:21:36] got to come in you you God and man must
[1:21:40] come one he says then you're conscious
[1:21:43] of your
[1:21:44] littleness that is the great dying out
[1:21:47] experience is you are conscious of your
[1:21:50] littleness and the more that God uses
[1:21:53] you the more little you
[1:21:56] become it's the only way God works
[1:21:59] humility is power with God the prophet
[1:22:00] of God said amen when we realize our
[1:22:04] littleness and his
[1:22:07] greatness that's when things really
[1:22:09] start to happen that's when you're
[1:22:10] cooking with gas as we say when he is
[1:22:13] increased and you are
[1:22:15] decreased I want to drop into the
[1:22:17] Practical side of this for a little bit
[1:22:18] as we go into the second half of this
[1:22:20] service because like I said last time we
[1:22:22] can't have a supernatural experience in
[1:22:24] an Earthly body and not have changes in
[1:22:26] the Earthly amen when the supernatural
[1:22:28] comes down it's got to have an effect
[1:22:29] here and we've read all about what
[1:22:31] charity does and how it was kind and
[1:22:33] forgiving and it Bears all things and
[1:22:35] these different things but the main
[1:22:37] thing is is that we're here to manifest
[1:22:38] God we're here to manifest the word for
[1:22:40] our day and that means that everything
[1:22:42] that God does everything the Holy Spirit
[1:22:43] does is to manifest the word through
[1:22:46] us that's what God's trying to do is
[1:22:48] produce Christ in US Little Messi hates
[1:22:51] brother Brandon will call call us the
[1:22:53] anointed ones that's what we're supposed
[1:22:56] to be he says this Paul said he could do
[1:22:59] all kinds of things even move mountains
[1:23:00] and still he's nothing where there's
[1:23:02] tongues it'll cease where there's
[1:23:04] knowledge it'll vanish where there's
[1:23:05] prophecies it shall fail but when that
[1:23:07] which is perfect has come it shall
[1:23:08] endure forever he said and love is
[1:23:12] perfection he says God so loved the
[1:23:14] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:23:16] that whosoever Shivers whoever s shakes
[1:23:18] whoever speaks who so he says no
[1:23:21] whosoever whoever believeth in him
[1:23:23] should not perish but have eternal life
[1:23:26] he says believe that
[1:23:27] children I'm coming back to Simplicity
[1:23:30] here he says they try to make it so
[1:23:33] complicated these things and them things
[1:23:36] he says it boils right down to one thing
[1:23:38] your personal faith in God that's it he
[1:23:43] says that tells it for by faith not by
[1:23:45] Feeling by faith not by Emotion by faith
[1:23:49] not by sensation but by faith are you
[1:23:51] saved and that by he says because you
[1:23:54] sought the Lord because you were a good
[1:23:56] person because God by Grace fornew you
[1:23:59] and ordained you to eternal life so in
[1:24:03] all of this I love Simplicity and we see
[1:24:06] Simplicity here and brother Bram says
[1:24:08] faith is the key faith is the key that
[1:24:10] unlocks the door it's the starting point
[1:24:11] it's the foundation and everything in
[1:24:13] your Christian walk is built on that
[1:24:15] Faith amen you'll get virtue knowledge
[1:24:17] patience and all these things but faith
[1:24:19] is the key that opens up the Christian
[1:24:21] walk it doesn't have to be complicated
[1:24:24] and I hope I'm not complicating it with
[1:24:26] this service I I'm showing you the
[1:24:27] intricacies of the process of God but
[1:24:30] let me tell you for many of us we'll go
[1:24:34] through this entire statue of a perfect
[1:24:36] man and only have glimmers of the fact
[1:24:38] that we're actually going through a
[1:24:39] school of
[1:24:40] training because for us it's just normal
[1:24:43] life life as a child of God is different
[1:24:46] as Life as a child of Satan cuz God's
[1:24:48] growing and he's training and he's
[1:24:50] teaching us and that's just life to us
[1:24:52] us that's normal for us to go through
[1:24:54] things and to deal with things and half
[1:24:56] the time we don't even realize what
[1:24:57] God's done in our life until we come to
[1:24:59] the trial we come to the test and we
[1:25:01] pass it and we say how did that
[1:25:04] happen God have been putting you through
[1:25:06] normal life which is the raising the
[1:25:09] training the development of a child of
[1:25:11] God and then you came to a test and
[1:25:12] realized that you've been going to
[1:25:13] school the entire time you've been going
[1:25:16] to church you've been sitting under the
[1:25:17] hearing of the word you've been having
[1:25:19] your devotions you've been humbling
[1:25:20] yourself to the word of God and it's
[1:25:22] having this big effect and you don't
[1:25:23] even realize it until the test comes and
[1:25:25] you pass with flying colors and you
[1:25:28] realize oh my goodness God's working
[1:25:30] with
[1:25:31] me the test is when you realize God's
[1:25:33] been working with you so often cuz the
[1:25:35] day today is just a little bit here and
[1:25:37] a little bit there but when the test
[1:25:38] comes it all gets put into action and
[1:25:40] you realize oh my goodness I have more
[1:25:41] than I
[1:25:45] thought you know my wife and I were
[1:25:47] talking about Simplicity the other day
[1:25:49] and you know when we had this big
[1:25:50] believe the sign movement and there were
[1:25:52] some people that were talking to to to
[1:25:55] my wife about it and they were they had
[1:25:57] this they they they gone and found this
[1:25:59] it's been around a while I'm sure this
[1:26:00] new fangled way of of of studying your
[1:26:03] Bible and linking this to that and you
[1:26:05] had to do this and you had to do that it
[1:26:06] was very technical and they said that's
[1:26:08] the way that that you're going to go
[1:26:10] into Rapture that's the way that you're
[1:26:11] going to come to Christ and my wife said
[1:26:14] if that's the case then my parents could
[1:26:16] never be
[1:26:18] saved right she said cuz they don't have
[1:26:21] that technical knowledge to put things
[1:26:23] together the way you're saying they have
[1:26:24] to they they don't have that intellect
[1:26:26] to put together things in study the way
[1:26:28] that you're saying is required to come
[1:26:30] to
[1:26:31] Christ it's simple it's got to be simple
[1:26:35] amen had he right had no clue about what
[1:26:39] the Seven Seals were but she had faith
[1:26:42] in the word of God and she believed it
[1:26:45] Peter and
[1:26:47] John the when the priesthood saw them
[1:26:49] they said that they were ignorant and
[1:26:52] and unlearned men
[1:26:55] uneducated but they said but they saw
[1:26:57] they knew that they had been with
[1:26:59] Jesus they had a life they had a
[1:27:01] demonstration that far surpassed the
[1:27:03] priests now the priests had the
[1:27:05] intellect that we're talking about to
[1:27:06] put things together in the Deep study
[1:27:08] and all these things but Jesus said you
[1:27:10] are of your father the
[1:27:13] devil just listening I've been listening
[1:27:15] to God in Simplicity and I just wrote
[1:27:17] this in my notes here this morning
[1:27:18] brother bradam said he reveals himself
[1:27:21] and works in simp it real simple so that
[1:27:25] everybody will understand
[1:27:27] it there isn't a test to get into the
[1:27:31] Gates of
[1:27:33] Glory it is not based on your knowledge
[1:27:35] of Doctrine or your understanding of the
[1:27:38] Bible the question is if thou can't
[1:27:41] believe all things are possible do you
[1:27:45] believe do you believe do you believe
[1:27:48] and if you say
[1:27:50] yay you enter in cuz it's by faith that
[1:27:55] we enter in amen it's not by study but
[1:27:58] we ought to study it's not by
[1:27:59] understanding though we gain
[1:28:00] understanding it's not by knowledge
[1:28:02] though we have knowledge amen but it is
[1:28:04] by the receiving of the word of God by
[1:28:07] Revelation you can't get a revelation
[1:28:09] unless you read
[1:28:11] it or hear
[1:28:14] it you got to hear it to get a
[1:28:16] revelation of it but you can study
[1:28:18] yourself until you're blue in the face
[1:28:20] and not catch it and know if God gives
[1:28:22] it to you though no amount of study will
[1:28:24] ever remove
[1:28:26] it if God gives you a true Revelation it
[1:28:28] cannot change because God doesn't give a
[1:28:31] revelation that changes because God
[1:28:32] doesn't change so if he gives it to you
[1:28:35] by Revelation the gates of hell can't
[1:28:37] Prevail against it because it's the word
[1:28:39] revealed in
[1:28:40] you and after that no amount of study
[1:28:43] can take it out but here's the thing no
[1:28:45] amount of study can put it in either
[1:28:47] God's got to reveal it to you amen and
[1:28:50] when he reveals it it'll go into your
[1:28:52] your life and it'll have an effect and
[1:28:53] it'll change the way you think and the
[1:28:54] way you look at things and the way you
[1:28:55] do
[1:28:57] things brother B says God so loved you
[1:28:59] that he gave his son that you might be
[1:29:02] saved and filled with the spirit and
[1:29:04] have his love projected in Your Heart by
[1:29:06] the Holy Ghost he says it makes you love
[1:29:10] everybody
[1:29:12] oof everybody brother John
[1:29:16] yep that's the reason Christians have
[1:29:18] their ups and downs the way they do
[1:29:20] while you could be on a Housetop no
[1:29:22] matter what condition you're in he's
[1:29:24] talking about a light on a house he says
[1:29:26] if you love God you know where you
[1:29:30] stand why if you love God it's because
[1:29:33] he first loved you you recognize your
[1:29:35] position in Christ you recognize that
[1:29:37] you were called before the foundation of
[1:29:38] the world you recognize your security in
[1:29:40] him you know when I I I Marvel and I've
[1:29:45] met men like this that not just Jesus I
[1:29:46] Marvel at but Jesus response to people
[1:29:48] and situations always makes me Marvel
[1:29:51] because he he never gets
[1:29:53] flustered he never gets worked up he
[1:29:56] never gets reactive he's always calm
[1:29:59] cool and Collective why he knew where he
[1:30:03] stood he knew who he was he knew his
[1:30:07] purpose he knew his leadership and
[1:30:09] because of that he didn't have to react
[1:30:11] to anybody he's just doing and being
[1:30:14] what he is amen when you know who you
[1:30:18] are you have no reason to try and be
[1:30:20] what somebody else wants you to be
[1:30:23] it doesn't play in you don't have to
[1:30:25] worry about it I I mentioned brother
[1:30:26] Phil mugby and and he he lived in
[1:30:28] Calgary I think he's gone back out out
[1:30:30] to uh somewhere outside of Africa I
[1:30:32] think now but he he was the most calm
[1:30:34] Collective man I've ever talked to and
[1:30:36] and I marveled and I said Lord I need
[1:30:38] some of what he's got because he would
[1:30:40] stand there and people would just be
[1:30:42] giving him the gears and he is so calm
[1:30:45] and cool and then he respond in love
[1:30:48] every time not flare up not get worked
[1:30:53] up he just speak back the word in
[1:30:57] kindness and in love time and time again
[1:30:58] I marveled that I talked to him about it
[1:31:00] and he gave me some insight on how he
[1:31:01] got there amen but I want you to
[1:31:04] understand if faith is the key then love
[1:31:05] is the Conquering weapon love is the
[1:31:08] Conquering weapon faith is the key but
[1:31:09] love is what God has given us for the
[1:31:11] believer because it's the Holy Ghost
[1:31:14] making the word work then James said be
[1:31:16] quick to hear slow to speak slow to
[1:31:18] wrath then Paul says I put away childish
[1:31:20] speaking understanding and thinking so
[1:31:22] what do we have to do we have to be
[1:31:23] quick to hear the Holy
[1:31:26] Spirit not ourselves slow to speak why
[1:31:31] lest it be our own
[1:31:33] words slow to anger lest it be our anger
[1:31:38] and not righteous
[1:31:39] anger what and in that take on the mind
[1:31:42] of
[1:31:43] Christ brother Bram had an experience
[1:31:46] with that demon-possessed man in Oregon
[1:31:48] if you remember and I want to read the
[1:31:49] story this morning we're talking about
[1:31:51] what this looks like practically cuz
[1:31:52] we're coming to Capstone we're coming to
[1:31:54] adoption uh we're coming to uh the the
[1:31:57] the Apex the highest point of the
[1:31:59] Christian
[1:32:01] Life and we tend to think it's this big
[1:32:03] signs and wonders thing and I'm not
[1:32:05] saying it's not there but those things
[1:32:07] follow they don't lead us but I want you
[1:32:10] to look like we see what this looks like
[1:32:12] in the prophet's life he says you notice
[1:32:14] at the first part of Portland Oregon
[1:32:15] that night I was standing on the
[1:32:16] platform and that Maniac ran to the
[1:32:18] platform to kill me he said I was just
[1:32:20] speaking like I am now this fell run
[1:32:22] down through a crowd of people thousands
[1:32:24] and they were standing in the street his
[1:32:26] eyes bulged way out and he was making
[1:32:27] his hands go up and down he ran up to
[1:32:29] the platform I thought maybe somebody
[1:32:31] was sick and he was coming after them he
[1:32:33] said it was about 150 200 ministers
[1:32:35] sitting behind me I looked at him and he
[1:32:37] run up that way and the preacher
[1:32:39] scattered like flies he says he just hit
[1:32:42] a preacher that day he was out of the
[1:32:43] insane institution and broke his jaw his
[1:32:45] collar bone and the police were after
[1:32:47] him the man had a reputation people knew
[1:32:49] what was
[1:32:50] coming he says and at the platform he
[1:32:53] runs straight up to me and blow real big
[1:32:55] like a goose pushed out his chest great
[1:32:57] big arms I weighed 128
[1:33:00] then 128 lbs I won't ask the sisters to
[1:33:04] tell me their weight but I guarantee you
[1:33:06] brother Brandon weighed more than a lot
[1:33:07] of
[1:33:08] sisters I don't think we realize how
[1:33:10] small he was a lot of God's Great
[1:33:13] preachers tiny little men we met him
[1:33:17] tiny little men 128 lbs I think my lower
[1:33:22] half weighs 128 lb that's a tiny man
[1:33:28] folks brother Bram knew how to box
[1:33:32] though he says he weighed about 250
[1:33:35] about 6' 4 in or something and he said
[1:33:37] you hypocrite you snake in the grass
[1:33:39] standing up here imposing yourself as a
[1:33:41] servant of God I'm going to take you
[1:33:43] apart right on this platform he says you
[1:33:45] better know what you're talking about
[1:33:47] when it's a maniac I just kept still and
[1:33:49] looked at him remember what we just read
[1:33:52] you have to know where you
[1:33:54] stand he said calling yourself a man of
[1:33:57] God rolled his arm up said I'm going to
[1:33:58] knock that little frame of yours Plum
[1:34:00] out over that audience there won't be a
[1:34:02] piece of you together when you land now
[1:34:04] put put yourself in the prophet's place
[1:34:07] he's ordained a prophet he's got a gift
[1:34:11] to preach he's got a calling to preach
[1:34:13] he's got signs and wonders following he
[1:34:16] said every Miracle you can think of
[1:34:19] replicated Jesus Christ in every way in
[1:34:22] signs and wonders he's been sent by the
[1:34:25] Holy Spirit to preach in Portland
[1:34:29] Oregon now listen in our Humanity what's
[1:34:33] our
[1:34:34] inclination Force Has Come What do we do
[1:34:38] match force with
[1:34:39] Force he brings a wrecking ball we bring
[1:34:42] a wrecking ball he brings an axe we
[1:34:45] bring an axe he brings physical threats
[1:34:48] we bring physical threats right we try
[1:34:51] and match up to what Satan's bringing
[1:34:53] the problem with that is we start using
[1:34:55] Satan's tools and as soon as I pick up
[1:34:57] Satan's tool I've got no
[1:34:59] Victory if I respond with what's being
[1:35:03] taken to me I'm going to
[1:35:06] lose weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:35:10] carnal natural human
[1:35:14] beastly what is it we'd be up there
[1:35:19] maybe and in our heads we'd be saying
[1:35:21] I'm the prophet I'm the seventh Church
[1:35:24] age messenger glory to God I'm here by
[1:35:27] his word and we go after him we do our
[1:35:29] best shamgar interpretation wouldn't we
[1:35:32] we'd pick up whatever we had and we'd
[1:35:33] start wailing into him until he was dead
[1:35:35] or out cold maybe we do our best Sons
[1:35:38] the Thunder of
[1:35:39] impression what childish speaking
[1:35:43] thinking and
[1:35:45] reacting using
[1:35:47] Authority where it's not needed in a way
[1:35:50] it's not meant to to be
[1:35:52] used look at Elisha remember brother
[1:35:55] Bram has the same spirit that Elisha
[1:35:58] does right Elisha had an Elijah spirit
[1:36:03] in double
[1:36:04] portion and Elisha got mad and got
[1:36:07] caught up in protecting his name and
[1:36:10] Elijah's name and he killed 42 children
[1:36:13] with
[1:36:14] it under the prophetic authority of his
[1:36:18] life brother bradam could have done it
[1:36:24] watch this because that's not
[1:36:26] Capstone judgment comes after we leave
[1:36:29] church not while we're here Mercy is
[1:36:32] always the first
[1:36:34] option brother Ram said I knew he was
[1:36:37] well able to carry his threats out he
[1:36:40] said I just looked at
[1:36:43] him didn't spring into
[1:36:46] action not forced with Force he said I
[1:36:49] just looked at him not a preacher said a
[1:36:51] word they were gone and I looked and
[1:36:53] here come two police I just LED them to
[1:36:55] Christ one of their mothers was healed
[1:36:57] the Night Before Good Presbyterian woman
[1:36:59] he says they run out there to grab him
[1:37:00] and I said this is not a flesh and blood
[1:37:03] Affair brother just a moment thank you
[1:37:07] church when you're dealing with
[1:37:09] situations we've got to recognize we
[1:37:12] wrestle not against flesh and
[1:37:16] blood flesh and blood is hiding the
[1:37:20] supernatural element that inside of that
[1:37:21] person amen it's not just people it's
[1:37:26] not just events it's a battle between
[1:37:28] the supernatural good and the
[1:37:30] supernatural evil playing out in the
[1:37:33] natural realm amen you have to realize
[1:37:36] what's going
[1:37:38] on that's what Ephesians 6 says for we
[1:37:41] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[1:37:43] against principalities and powers and
[1:37:45] darkness and these different
[1:37:47] things brother Braham says notice he
[1:37:51] said says just a moment thank you calm
[1:37:54] cool
[1:37:55] unruffled those little fellas backed off
[1:37:58] stood there a minute I just kept real
[1:38:01] still I'd be preparing
[1:38:04] myself he said I kept real
[1:38:07] still and I was going to tell him I'd
[1:38:09] say sir what's the matter and he spit
[1:38:11] right in my face he said you snake in
[1:38:13] the grass he said tonight I'm going to
[1:38:15] break every bone in your body and I was
[1:38:18] going to say I hope you
[1:38:20] don't that was brother bram's human
[1:38:22] response even in his Humanity brother
[1:38:24] bram's response would have been just
[1:38:25] fine I hope you don't I really don't
[1:38:27] want every bone in my body
[1:38:30] broken but listen to this as I started
[1:38:34] to say that God in his sovereignty the
[1:38:38] Holy Spirit came down and he said just
[1:38:42] spoke they thought it was me speaking
[1:38:45] but it wasn't no more than it is in the
[1:38:48] vision he said because you've challenge
[1:38:51] the spirit of God tonight you'll fall
[1:38:53] over my feet he says there's both
[1:38:56] prophecies now it had to be shown why he
[1:39:00] didn't speak the Holy Spirit spoke and
[1:39:02] God's words can't return to him
[1:39:04] void he said it said fall over your feet
[1:39:08] said you hypocrit said I'll show you
[1:39:10] whose feet I'll fall over Drew back his
[1:39:13] arm and run at me real hard and he
[1:39:15] started to hit me and I said now the
[1:39:18] Holy Spirit has spoken catch now brother
[1:39:21] bram's back in it and he says Satan come
[1:39:24] out of the man and his arm was up he
[1:39:27] went M and rolled over like that and
[1:39:29] fell down right across my feet and
[1:39:31] pinned me there till the police had to
[1:39:33] roll him off my feet they said is that
[1:39:35] man dead I said no sir he worships that
[1:39:39] Spirit they pulled him
[1:39:42] out that man loved what he
[1:39:47] did that man woried the demon that was
[1:39:50] inside of him he loved to dominate he
[1:39:51] loved to bully he loved to wreck things
[1:39:53] he loved to break things up he was a
[1:39:55] dwelling place for a demonic spirit and
[1:39:57] when that demon went out of him he lost
[1:39:59] his strength as big as he was that demon
[1:40:01] was his
[1:40:04] strength he loved that feeling of coming
[1:40:06] in and just wrecking things like I said
[1:40:09] our inclination would meet his Wrecking
[1:40:10] Ball with our Wrecking Ball but we can't
[1:40:13] do that we've got to come with the
[1:40:14] weapon that God has given us rather than
[1:40:17] react to Satan the way he does Amen
[1:40:19] otherwise we're playing his game we've
[1:40:21] got to meet Satan with God's weapon and
[1:40:22] that weapon is love it's the Holy Spirit
[1:40:25] operating in love watch this brother
[1:40:28] says let me give you just a little
[1:40:30] inside of my life he's saying you want
[1:40:31] to you want to understand what happened
[1:40:32] here here's it is he says I'm going to
[1:40:34] tell you my brethren don't make any
[1:40:36] difference how emotional you try to be
[1:40:38] that's good anything without emotion is
[1:40:40] dead you can scientifically prove that
[1:40:42] so if your religion ain't got a little
[1:40:43] emotion about it you better bury it get
[1:40:45] some that's got some emotion but look
[1:40:48] brother the main thing if all your
[1:40:50] emotions is in sealed by the Divine Holy
[1:40:52] Spirit love it won't do you any good he
[1:40:55] said you know how I've had success in
[1:40:57] this one thing I contribute to it
[1:41:01] love that's right do you know Love Will
[1:41:04] Conquer anything no matter what it is
[1:41:07] why charity never
[1:41:10] faileth he says what was it did I hate
[1:41:13] that
[1:41:14] man I loved him he says a poor mortal in
[1:41:19] that condition ever have somebody just
[1:41:22] giving you the
[1:41:25] gears and you something just comes over
[1:41:28] you and you think what a horrible
[1:41:31] condition to be
[1:41:32] in and you're actually feeling sorry for
[1:41:35] them because of how bent out of shape
[1:41:37] how worked up how stressed how negative
[1:41:40] whatever it might be that person is I've
[1:41:43] dealt with it at work many times and
[1:41:44] sometimes you got negative NES
[1:41:46] everywhere and no matter what happens
[1:41:48] they've got a negative spin on it and
[1:41:50] you just sit there and say what a
[1:41:51] miserable life you must
[1:41:54] live nothing brother Braham says that
[1:41:57] poor mortal in that condition that
[1:41:59] wasn't that man speaking that was the
[1:42:01] devil he was possessed of the devil and
[1:42:03] the devil made the challenge and who
[1:42:05] challenged him back the Holy Spirit
[1:42:09] challenged him back if I challenge him
[1:42:11] watch out he'll beat me every time he'll
[1:42:15] beat me every time remember they had
[1:42:16] people that were going around and saying
[1:42:17] in Jesus name and in Paul's name and
[1:42:19] they said in Jesus name Jes Jus we know
[1:42:21] Paul I know but you sons of CA who are
[1:42:23] you and they ran him out and stripped
[1:42:25] them
[1:42:26] naked one man seven
[1:42:29] guys why they were trying to use
[1:42:32] somebody else's
[1:42:34] Authority I try and use something I
[1:42:36] don't
[1:42:37] have just Falls flat he says the Holy
[1:42:41] Spirit challenged him back and you know
[1:42:42] what happened now watch this church
[1:42:45] watch what happens when you defeat with
[1:42:46] love real love divine love he says there
[1:42:49] were wheelchairs Cs and stretchers you
[1:42:51] know how it was in The First beginning
[1:42:53] when that happened he says when he was
[1:42:55] speaking you could have heard a pin drop
[1:42:56] as the old saying
[1:42:59] is I I don't know how I'd how I'd act if
[1:43:02] if some man ran up and brother Matt or
[1:43:04] brother Joel wasn't able to tackle him
[1:43:05] and he came up and he fell at my feet I
[1:43:07] tend to think we'd have raised our hands
[1:43:08] and just started worshiping and praising
[1:43:10] the
[1:43:11] Lord Watch What Happens we're talking
[1:43:14] about perfection versus impart now he
[1:43:18] says but when all that Legion saw that
[1:43:20] their chief man had been slain every
[1:43:23] sick person Rose to their
[1:43:27] feet remember we read that quote last
[1:43:29] service where brother Bram says I
[1:43:30] believe there's a higher standard coming
[1:43:32] where the Holy Spirit would just come in
[1:43:35] love and sweep over the
[1:43:39] congregation and do what needs to be
[1:43:42] done he says every C was
[1:43:47] empty every wheelchair emptied up and
[1:43:51] the whole group was healed at one time
[1:43:54] and walked out because the power of
[1:43:56] hatred and the Power of Love had met
[1:43:58] together and love will overcome hatred
[1:44:01] every time he says love your enemy why
[1:44:06] Perfection had
[1:44:07] spoke perfect results followed listen
[1:44:12] laying on of hands is
[1:44:14] imperfect it's ordained but it's
[1:44:18] imperfect but now Perfection comes and
[1:44:20] nobody has to touch them because the
[1:44:23] perfect one is there love is there and
[1:44:25] it swept through the building and
[1:44:26] freedom everyone where the spirit of the
[1:44:28] Lord is there is
[1:44:31] Liberty can you imagine you're having a
[1:44:34] healing service all you got to do now is
[1:44:36] finish your preaching and go cuz the
[1:44:38] job's done why the Holy Spirit responded
[1:44:41] in
[1:44:42] love
[1:44:44] love not Authority not a beating of the
[1:44:48] chest not I'm this and I'm that the Holy
[1:44:51] Spirit spoke through 128 pound 5 foot
[1:44:54] nothing
[1:44:55] preacher and took the devil right out of
[1:44:57] the situation
[1:44:59] completely listen we might hate Satan
[1:45:01] but we've got to be able to work with
[1:45:02] people that have him in them all the
[1:45:04] time we've got to be able to deal with
[1:45:07] situations in love to
[1:45:10] wait to hear to speak slow to anger slow
[1:45:16] to respond not be reactive brother
[1:45:20] wasn't up there trying to prove anything
[1:45:22] brother brandham was just doing his job
[1:45:26] not confrontational not looking for a
[1:45:28] fight but then the Holy Spirit spoke and
[1:45:30] now brother brandham gets
[1:45:33] involved he walked out of that meeting
[1:45:35] without a scratch on him including no
[1:45:36] hatred in his
[1:45:38] heart because what what happens when
[1:45:40] we're dealing with hatred the danger is
[1:45:41] that you get nicked with the sword
[1:45:42] that's poisoned by it and that person
[1:45:45] that hates you that person that's
[1:45:46] bringing something against you you walk
[1:45:48] out with something against that person
[1:45:49] the same as they've got to against you
[1:45:51] and you didn't win that fight cuz you
[1:45:53] walked out scarred you walked out with a
[1:45:54] poison you walked out with a demon on
[1:45:56] your shoulder and your head that put
[1:45:58] Hate in Your Heart why cuz love didn't
[1:46:00] come into the
[1:46:02] situation brother Braham says this where
[1:46:06] there is prophecies it'll fail where
[1:46:08] there's tongues it'll cease and where
[1:46:10] there is knowledge it'll vanish away but
[1:46:12] when perfect love has come into the
[1:46:14] human heart all demons in hell will
[1:46:18] never be able to upset
[1:46:21] it what's Satan trying to do Church
[1:46:24] upset
[1:46:25] us what does it mean to upset get out of
[1:46:29] balance or get you off your foundation
[1:46:32] if I stand this up and I found a way and
[1:46:34] there is a point where I could get this
[1:46:36] to stand up there's a center of gravity
[1:46:38] mixed with where it rests and I could
[1:46:40] get this thing to stand straight up
[1:46:41] maybe I could do it this
[1:46:43] way maybe not hard to do let's go here
[1:46:49] it's imbalance
[1:46:51] surface is
[1:46:53] flat still good but if I give it a big
[1:46:56] knock gets out of balance and it starts
[1:46:58] rolling there's no coming back Satan's
[1:47:00] trying to get us out of balance
[1:47:02] reactive stand still brother brah said
[1:47:05] through all this all he did was Stood
[1:47:07] Still looked watched and waited for the
[1:47:09] Holy Spirit to speak and then stepped in
[1:47:12] he says when perfect love is coming to
[1:47:15] the human heart all demons in hell will
[1:47:18] never be able to upset it
[1:47:21] as we start to close we know that story
[1:47:22] of that gery bull that was in the field
[1:47:24] on the farm and it was a killer bull
[1:47:26] that had already killed one man and
[1:47:27] brother Brandon was doing out on patrol
[1:47:30] um for wildlife services I think at that
[1:47:32] time and he had he said oh I'm close I'm
[1:47:34] going to go pray for that man and he
[1:47:35] took a shortcut through the field and he
[1:47:37] got halfway through the field and the
[1:47:39] blll rose up and he realized he was in a
[1:47:41] pickle he said I was too far from the
[1:47:43] fence to go run and there was no tree
[1:47:44] around I'm in the middle of the field
[1:47:46] and I got nothing nowhere to go nowhere
[1:47:49] to hide but brother says well I was
[1:47:51] supposed to have a gun but I didn't have
[1:47:53] one and so I looked back to the fence it
[1:47:55] was too far to run no tree to get into
[1:47:57] so I thought this is probably the end
[1:48:00] then you ever get in a situation you
[1:48:02] think this is the end it's the end of
[1:48:04] the relationship it's the end of the job
[1:48:06] it's the end of the
[1:48:10] road he says so I looked at him you know
[1:48:13] he says now this is not a joke when I
[1:48:15] looked at that bull and he lowered his
[1:48:16] head and threw his horns on the ground
[1:48:17] threw the dirt back over him and he
[1:48:19] started coming
[1:48:21] what do you do when somebody with bad
[1:48:22] intentions Comes Your Way
[1:48:24] Church here's an
[1:48:26] example he says now instead of hating
[1:48:29] that bull I was glad I didn't have no
[1:48:32] gun brother saying you know we talk
[1:48:34] about spoken word authority and we want
[1:48:36] power and those different things brother
[1:48:38] brah saying I'm glad I didn't have any
[1:48:39] natural power to kill that bull CU
[1:48:42] otherwise what would he have done killed
[1:48:44] the
[1:48:46] bull what had the bull done wrong
[1:48:49] Church
[1:48:52] nothing was what the bull doing worthy
[1:48:54] of death no he's just being a
[1:48:58] bull our desire for power is easily
[1:49:01] manipulated to become abuse of power and
[1:49:05] a gun is one of the most absolute ways
[1:49:06] to abuse
[1:49:08] power just because you can doesn't mean
[1:49:10] you should that's what he's saying he's
[1:49:12] saying I'm glad I didn't have a gun cuz
[1:49:15] why now something greater than a gun
[1:49:17] could step
[1:49:18] in amen and anger is not the tool of God
[1:49:21] in a believer's life he said I loved him
[1:49:25] now that seems strange this is the same
[1:49:27] service that he's he just talked about
[1:49:28] the the maniac in in Oregon he said I
[1:49:31] want you to remember this I love that
[1:49:33] fellow I thought poor fellow I'm in his
[1:49:36] place I'm on his territory he was
[1:49:39] sleeping and I woke him up just got him
[1:49:41] roused up Church like I said before a
[1:49:44] beast can't help itself a beast has an
[1:49:46] ingrained response it's instinctive they
[1:49:48] can't choose I remember when I was at
[1:49:50] the San Diego Zoo and they let out the
[1:49:52] lion cubs to play with the dad and one
[1:49:53] of them bit down a little too hard well
[1:49:54] what did he do he turned around he
[1:49:56] swatted it hard and he growled at it why
[1:49:59] it's just a kid didn't really hurt the
[1:50:01] big bad 400b lion in that way but his
[1:50:05] instinct is to react the way he did what
[1:50:09] force and swatted him right off they
[1:50:12] said that actually they'll often eat
[1:50:14] their children in anger or to preserve
[1:50:17] the pride too many mouthe to feed
[1:50:20] beasts have no choice they do what they
[1:50:25] do when you're dealing with unconverted
[1:50:27] people they're in a beast nature a man
[1:50:30] or a woman without the Holy Ghost is a
[1:50:31] beast and we've got to be able to
[1:50:33] recognize that beasts act a certain way
[1:50:36] because they're a beast and they can't
[1:50:37] help it and it's up to you as a
[1:50:41] converted soul to act different than the
[1:50:44] Beast that you're dealing with
[1:50:47] amen he says just got him roused up up
[1:50:50] and I said to him not knowing what's
[1:50:53] happened the holy spirit's entered now
[1:50:54] slow to speak quick to hear he I said
[1:50:58] creature of God he's a fallen
[1:51:01] creature but he's still a creature of
[1:51:04] God he says I am the servant of God I'm
[1:51:07] on my way to pray for one of god- sick
[1:51:08] children now you can't bother me because
[1:51:11] I'm God's servant now I'm sorry I
[1:51:14] Disturbed you church sometimes our
[1:51:17] apology is for
[1:51:18] disturbing sometimes our apology is for
[1:51:21] making people act the way they
[1:51:23] are brother Braham didn't do anything
[1:51:26] wrong sometimes we don't do something
[1:51:28] wrong and the apology still has to be
[1:51:29] made because it caused a reaction not
[1:51:32] because you did something wrong because
[1:51:35] you caused a
[1:51:36] reaction that's a weak point in that
[1:51:38] person's life maybe they're unconverted
[1:51:40] sometimes we've just got to apologize
[1:51:42] why to let them know we value their
[1:51:44] soul their life their Eternal
[1:51:48] destination our apologies for for their
[1:51:50] sake not for
[1:51:51] ours our our our heart may not condemn
[1:51:54] us but we can apologize for their sake
[1:51:58] he says you can't bother me because I'm
[1:51:59] God's servant now I'm sorry I Disturbed
[1:52:01] you in Jesus name go lay down he says I
[1:52:05] was not a bit more afraid of that bull
[1:52:07] than I was the man that night or my
[1:52:09] brethren sitting here he says and that
[1:52:11] bull ran right to
[1:52:14] me you spoke the word brother brother
[1:52:16] John I spoke the
[1:52:18] word stand
[1:52:22] still remember when the Holy Spirit
[1:52:25] speaks it never
[1:52:28] fails he says till he got within about
[1:52:31] 10t of me he was a ways away I think
[1:52:33] brother bam said 30 or 40 feet so he
[1:52:35] covered 2/3 or 3/4 of the distance he
[1:52:38] ran from Brother Paul to this front
[1:52:41] Pew I'd have been getting ready to
[1:52:44] run he said I just stood there he says
[1:52:47] he came right close to me soorry say
[1:52:50] till he got about 10t of me and I wasn't
[1:52:53] no more afraid than I am what than I am
[1:52:56] now why perfect love casts out
[1:53:01] fear he says and he got right close to
[1:53:03] me and he stopped and he looked this way
[1:53:06] and that way so
[1:53:09] depleted he had started out angry he's
[1:53:13] charged 20 or 30 ft and then he gets
[1:53:16] close and everything that's made him run
[1:53:19] is
[1:53:21] gone the wind have been taken right out
[1:53:23] of his sails he's got nothing left to
[1:53:26] keep him running at brother
[1:53:27] brandham why love has defeated his Beast
[1:53:31] nature he said so depleted sitting there
[1:53:34] confused standing there confused all
[1:53:36] snorting and ready to go and then 10
[1:53:38] feet away he doesn't even know why he's
[1:53:39] doing what he's doing why he's heaving
[1:53:41] and frothing and all of these things why
[1:53:43] am I so tired why am I so worked
[1:53:46] up he says and I just looked at him and
[1:53:49] I thought poor
[1:53:50] fellow what pity and Sympathy for the
[1:53:53] Beast he turned right around walked over
[1:53:57] laid down and I walked right on by him
[1:53:59] brother Bram says he never even that
[1:54:01] bull never even looked at him again
[1:54:03] that's how completely conquered he
[1:54:06] was not with a bullet with
[1:54:10] love he says Love Will Conquer anything
[1:54:14] where there's tongues they shall cease
[1:54:16] where there's prophecies it shall vanish
[1:54:19] but when comes it conquers everything
[1:54:21] God so loved the world there's your
[1:54:23] great conquering right there he says
[1:54:26] that's where you're failing friends
[1:54:28] don't practice so much of whether you
[1:54:29] got gifts or not but practice that one
[1:54:32] real gift of love he says then you'd be
[1:54:34] better what is it love conquers all
[1:54:36] things love the Lord with all your heart
[1:54:39] with all your soul and with all your
[1:54:41] mind with all your strength and faith
[1:54:44] will accompany that love Faith to what
[1:54:48] stand having done what you've been told
[1:54:51] to do stand wait trust
[1:54:56] believe what hold
[1:54:59] fast let God do the
[1:55:01] rest amen the musicians could come if
[1:55:03] they want you know as I was going
[1:55:05] through this and we we've talked about
[1:55:07] the childish side versus the mature
[1:55:11] side and as a man with children I have a
[1:55:13] firsthand look at what children look
[1:55:15] like and the younger the child is the
[1:55:18] more focused they are on the elves and
[1:55:20] they're very much about the here and now
[1:55:22] if you've ever seen they do these tests
[1:55:23] where they tell children okay I'm going
[1:55:25] to put a marshmallow or two in front of
[1:55:27] you and if you can and they'll leave
[1:55:29] them in a room alone for 30 minutes and
[1:55:31] they'll say if you don't eat it we'll
[1:55:33] give you 10 at the end and they'll give
[1:55:35] the children a choice you can have one
[1:55:36] or two now or you can have 10 at the end
[1:55:39] and almost none no children make it
[1:55:40] through to the end they can't handle
[1:55:42] that Temptation they can't they can't
[1:55:44] look to the Future and ignore the
[1:55:46] present I'm hungry it smells so good it
[1:55:49] looks so good good I've wanted a
[1:55:50] marshmallow our day whatever it is they
[1:55:52] can't do it you know and and every
[1:55:53] morning I make a smoothie and and Jensen
[1:55:55] and and and and Samuel wants some every
[1:55:59] time and so I've had to make more and
[1:56:00] more every morning but when I do I I
[1:56:02] pour mine in and I fill mine up and then
[1:56:04] I take whatever's left and I put it into
[1:56:06] two
[1:56:07] glasses but you know what if I give them
[1:56:10] the choice they'll inspect them closely
[1:56:13] for just the millimetric difference
[1:56:16] between which one has more and which one
[1:56:17] has less and they'll take that one every
[1:56:20] single
[1:56:21] time what is it me me me I I I now I try
[1:56:26] and pour them exactly the same but it's
[1:56:29] never exactly the same and so they'll
[1:56:31] look and they want the bigger one every
[1:56:35] single time and Samuel is is especially
[1:56:37] obvious about it the other day Blanca
[1:56:38] gave me some some
[1:56:40] chocolate and uh Samuel came in and he
[1:56:44] said can I have some so I cracked it in
[1:56:46] half but it was a it was an odd-shaped
[1:56:47] piece and so one side was obviously
[1:56:49] bigger than the other and he said dad
[1:56:51] can I have the bigger peace no shame no
[1:56:54] no no anything about him that would say
[1:56:56] you know maybe dad you're the bigger
[1:56:57] person you could have it no he wanted
[1:56:59] the bigger
[1:57:00] piece you know he's a child and he's all
[1:57:02] about himself and if can you imagine if
[1:57:04] I gave Samuel
[1:57:07] Authority he'd be a dictator everything
[1:57:10] for him everything for him we're talking
[1:57:13] about perfect love
[1:57:15] now who's got the authority in the house
[1:57:19] I do
[1:57:21] and then my wife has Authority because
[1:57:22] I've given her
[1:57:23] Authority and how are we supposed to act
[1:57:26] in
[1:57:28] love every
[1:57:30] time I'll be the first to say I
[1:57:34] don't but we're supposed to act in
[1:57:36] perfect love for their benefit not just
[1:57:40] for ours but there's times where
[1:57:42] frustration makes me say and do things
[1:57:44] that I maybe don't want to do there's
[1:57:46] times where maybe I'm selfish and I just
[1:57:48] want some peace or a break or whatever
[1:57:49] it might be and so I get them to do
[1:57:51] something that keeps them out of my hair
[1:57:53] or lets me sit back and relax for a
[1:57:55] little bit but that's not
[1:57:58] Perfection Perfection is when the holy
[1:58:00] spirit's moving for their benefit for
[1:58:02] their good according to what the word of
[1:58:04] God says and then Paul's talking about
[1:58:07] getting us to the place where Divine
[1:58:08] love dwells in US day by day and
[1:58:11] expresses itself that way that every
[1:58:14] action every
[1:58:16] reaction every move every word
[1:58:20] has love all over it that love is what
[1:58:24] prompts it to come out of us amen it
[1:58:26] helps us keep our mouth
[1:58:29] shut helps us keep our mouth shut helps
[1:58:32] us keep our anger in
[1:58:34] check amen and helps us to speak for the
[1:58:37] benefit of a soul that's worth 10,000
[1:58:40] worlds cuz we're talking about souls
[1:58:42] that hang in the
[1:58:44] balance listen we're
[1:58:47] sealed we're sealed
[1:58:50] if I drop dead right now I know where
[1:58:52] I'm going church but when we're talking
[1:58:55] to people that are still in their Beast
[1:58:57] nature and sometimes it's still our
[1:58:59] children not all of our children have
[1:59:01] the Holy Ghost our co-workers definitely
[1:59:04] don't have the Holy Ghost everything we
[1:59:07] do has to be for the benefit of that
[1:59:09] Soul because that's the only thing that
[1:59:13] matters and you'll see that in the lives
[1:59:15] of Christ you'll see that in the lives
[1:59:17] of the the apostles you'll see in
[1:59:18] brother life you ought to see it in each
[1:59:20] and every one of our Lives we're dealing
[1:59:22] with the Eternal balance of a soul based
[1:59:25] on what we do what we say let's stand
[1:59:29] together if we
[1:59:31] would we read that quote the other day
[1:59:34] where brother R said we are the only
[1:59:36] Bible that many people will read I want
[1:59:38] to close with this one quote because I
[1:59:41] want to ask you today are they seeing
[1:59:42] Divine
[1:59:44] love the Holy Ghost seals you till the
[1:59:47] day of your Redemption but brother Ram
[1:59:49] says when you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:59:50] start seeking other
[1:59:52] Souls you want them to get what you've
[1:59:54] got you want them to experience what you
[1:59:56] have you want them to be where you
[1:59:59] are brother Braham said this he said I
[2:00:02] think we need the Christ the only way we
[2:00:05] see Christ is when he reflects in each
[2:00:07] other I see Christ in you you see him in
[2:00:11] me he says that's how we watch
[2:00:14] Christ
[2:00:18] amen
[2:00:20] I've got a ways to
[2:00:21] go we look at this I sayl help me help
[2:00:26] Jonathan klette to die out amen help me
[2:00:29] to be slow to
[2:00:31] speak quick to hear slow to wrath even
[2:00:36] righteous indignation needs to be
[2:00:38] slow so we can make sure it's truly
[2:00:41] righteous slow to speak have the mind of
[2:00:45] Christ so that the words that come out
[2:00:47] are covered in love
[2:00:50] not in Revenge not in hatred not in
[2:00:52] spite not getting back but for the sake
[2:00:55] of that person's soul amen you know
[2:00:59] there's going to be offenses come the
[2:01:00] scripture says and it says woe to them
[2:01:01] that are offended woe to them that cause
[2:01:03] the
[2:01:05] offense sometimes our reaction can
[2:01:07] determine whether that's an offense or
[2:01:10] whether that's
[2:01:12] forgiven if we don't get offended
[2:01:15] where's the
[2:01:16] sin our reaction could could determine
[2:01:20] brother Braham said the Eternal
[2:01:22] destination of the people we're dealing
[2:01:24] with on a day-to-day basis you know what
[2:01:26] that tells me we need perfect love every
[2:01:30] day of Our Lives flowing through us not
[2:01:34] authority to speak things in and out of
[2:01:36] existence cast this out and cast that
[2:01:38] out Lord take out the me first take out
[2:01:41] the me in the equation and then we'll
[2:01:43] see what we can do with the rest amen
[2:01:45] amen let's bow our heads each
[2:01:47] one heavenly
[2:01:50] father Lord talk about a higher
[2:01:53] standard Lord where every word every
[2:01:57] deed every step every thought Lord
[2:02:02] brought subject to the Holy Spirit by
[2:02:03] the
[2:02:04] word Lord we're preaching a high
[2:02:07] standard
[2:02:08] here Lord and we know we still fail Lord
[2:02:13] we're in frail
[2:02:14] vessels but Lord our desire is for
[2:02:17] victory victory in the love
[2:02:21] divine Lord that victory in the love
[2:02:23] divine put Souls on the other side Lord
[2:02:27] it brought people to you Lord it
[2:02:29] declared your word it manifested your
[2:02:31] word it made Christ Jesus Christ the
[2:02:33] same yesterday today and forever in the
[2:02:35] eyes of the people Lord we desire to
[2:02:38] Glory you to glorify you Lord that our
[2:02:42] lives would be a a book that people
[2:02:44] could read Lord that they could see Lord
[2:02:46] a word that's living outside of each and
[2:02:48] every one of of us Lord God lord would
[2:02:51] you help us Lord even as we come to this
[2:02:54] table today Lord if we have odd against
